2500|$|In a CounterPunch {{article in}} August 2005, Cockburn {{referred}} to Hitchens as: [...] "A guy who called Sid Blumenthal {{one of his}} best friends and then tried to have him thrown into prison for perjury; a guy who waited til his friend Edward Said was on his death bed before attacking him in the Atlantic Monthly; a guy who knows perfectly well the role Israel plays in US policy but who does not scruple to flail Cindy Sheehan as a LaRouchie and anti-Semite <b>because,</b> <b>maybe,</b> she dared mention the word Israel." [...] In response Hitchens stood by his standpoint on the deposition he made to prosecutors regarding Sidney Blumenthal during the impeachment of Bill Clinton and his critical review of Edward Said's book Orientalism (1978). He stated that the review was determined by the 25th anniversary of the book's original publication and not by the state of Said's health. On Cindy Sheehan, Hitchens backtracked [...] "On consideration, I would take back the word 'LaRouchie', which I applied not to her but to the words she said she didn't utter (but did)." [...] Cockburn comments, [...] "Six hundred and twenty nine words into a seven hundred and eighty-two-word letter Hitchens addresses the very first point I raised, slipping us the news that he takes it back." ...|$|E

The incident attracted media interest two weeks following its occurrence {{after it was}} first exposed during an interview by the 2016 Spanish Eurovision entrant Barei, who described the details she witnessed at the airport. Hovi Star stated that he didn't discuss the incident because he preferred not to attract negative stories to himself. During his appearance on the Maltese talk show Xarabank on 22 April, Hovi Star commented: [...] "In Moscow, people have a rough time with people like me, <b>maybe</b> <b>because</b> I'm gay, <b>maybe</b> <b>because</b> I dress like this, <b>maybe</b> <b>because</b> I wear make-up, I don't know.

We had all bought store clothes where we stopped last; and now the king put his'n on, and he told me to put mine on. I done it, of course.

Well, I knowed a potato would do that before, but I had forgot it.|$|E
