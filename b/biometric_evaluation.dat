40|$|Abstract—Template update allows {{to modify}} the {{biometric}} reference of a user while he uses the biometric system. With such kind of mechanism we expect the biometric system uses always an up to date representation of the user, by capturing his intra-class (temporary or permanent) variability. Although several studies exist in the literature, there is no commonly adopted evaluation scheme. This does not ease the comparison of the different systems of the literature. In this paper, we show that using different evaluation procedures can lead in different, and contradictory, interpretations of the results.

The significance of analyses has been underlined by both therapeutic and noxions effects of magnetic field therapies to the living organism.

The exact effect mechanism of electromagnetic field therapies is not quite clear. The oxygen uptake of cells is supposedly increased by the induced magnetic field [18]. Electromagnetic field therapies in human and veterinary medicine are primarily used for treating soft tissue lesions [8], and bone and joint disorders [9]. There are some new investigations trying to explain the effects of the treatments for positive and negative stress sensibility.

40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} development and testing of the Human-Biometric Sensor Interaction Evaluation Method that used ergonomics, usability, and image quality criteria as explanatory variables of overall biometric system performance to evaluate swipe-based fingerprint recognition devices. The HBSI method was proposed because of questions regarding the thoroughness of traditional testing and performance evaluation metrics such as FTA, FTE, FAR, and FRR used in standardized evaluation methods; questioning if traditional metrics were acceptable enough to fully test and understand biometric systems, or determine if important data were not being collected. ^ The Design and Evaluation of the Human-Biometric Sensor Interaction Method had four objectives: (a) analyze the literature to determine what influences the interaction of humans and biometric devices, (b) develop a conceptual model based on previous research, (c) design two alternative swipe fingerprint sensors, and (d) to compare how people interact with the commercial and designed swipe fingerprint sensors, to examine if changing the form factor improves the usability of the device {{in terms of the}} proposed HBSI evaluation method. ^ Data was collected from 85 individuals over 3 visits that accounted for 33, 394 interactions with the 4 sensors used. The HBSI Evaluation Method provided additional detail about how users interact with the devices collecting data on: image quality, number of detected minutiae, fingerprint image size, fingerprint image contrast, user satisfaction, task time, task completeness, user effort, number of assists; in addition to traditional biometric testing and reporting metrics of: acquisition failures (FTA), enrollment failures (FTE), and matching performance (FAR and FRR). ^ Results from the HBSI Evaluation Method revealed that traditional <b>biometric</b> <b>evaluations</b> that focus on system-reported metrics are not providing sufficient reporting details. For example, matching performance for right and left index finger reported a FRR under 1 % for all sensors at the operational point 0. 1 % FAR: UPEK (0. 24 %), PUSH (0. 98 %), PULL (0. 36 %), and large area (0. 34 %). However, the FTA rate was 11. 28 % and accounted for 3, 768 presentations. From this research, two metrics previously unaccounted for and contained in the traditional FTA rate: Failure to Present (FTP) and False Failure to Present (FFTP) were created to better understand human interaction with biometric sensors and attribute errors accordingly. The FTP rate accounted for 1, 187 of the 3, 768 (31. 5 %) of interactions traditionally labeled as FTAs. The FFTP was much smaller at 0. 35 %, but can provide researchers further insight to help explain abnormal behaviors in matching rates, ROC and DET curves. In addition, traditional metrics of image quality and number of detected minutiae did not reveal a statistical difference across the sensors, however HBSI metrics of fingerprint image size and contrast did reveal a statistical difference, indicating the design of the PUSH sensor provided images of less gray level variation, while the PULL sensor provided images of larger pixel consistency during some of the data collection visits. The level of learning or habituation was also documented in this research through three metrics: task completion, Maximum User Effort (MUE), and the number of assists provided. All three reported the PUSH with the lowest rates, but improved the most over the visits, which was a function of learning how to use a “push”-based swipe sensor, as opposed to the “pull” swipe type. ^ Overall the HBSI Evaluation Method provided the foundation for the future of <b>biometric</b> <b>evaluations</b> as it linked system feedback from erroneous interactions to the human-sensor interaction that caused the failure. This linkage will enable system developers and researchers the ability to re-examine the data to see if the errors are the result of the algorithm or human interaction that can be solved with revised training techniques, design modifications, or other adjustments in the future. ...|$|R

A total 150 males and females birds were distributed in a completely randomized design with three treatments (0, 10 and 20 % acerola meal) and five replicates. The productive performance was assessed by weighing the feed and poultry.

40|$|PURPOSE. Visualization of the {{anterior}} segment and <b>biometric</b> <b>evaluation</b> {{of the entire}} crystalline lens pose significant challenges for imaging techniques because of tissue-induced distortion artifacts. The present {{study was conducted to}} demonstrate the advantages of high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (micro-MRI) for visualizing {{the anterior}} segment. METHODS. High-resolution MR ocular images were acquired on an ultra-high-field MR unit using a two-channel coil with four coil elements and T(2) -weighted turbo spin echo sequences ex vivo in pig, rabbit, monkey, and human donor eyes and in vivo in rabbits. Tissue heating, reproducibility, and signal-to-noise ratio were investigated in vivo. Monkey eye lens thickness (LT) was also measured using A-scan ultrasonography (US). RESULTS. Anterior segment details of phakic eyes were obtained ex vivo (pig, rabbit, monkey, and human donor eyes) with pixel matrix size 512 x 512 (in-plane resolution 80 x 80 mu m) and in vivo (rabbit eyes) with pixel matrix size 320 x 320 (in-plane resolution 125 x 125 mu m). Complete quantification of lens dimensions as they correlate with the sulcus-sulcus and angle-angle plane can be performed. In LT determinations in monkey eyes, no significant difference was detected between micro-MRI and A-scan US (P > 0. 05, Mann-Whitney U test). Biometric analysis of one pseudophakic monkey eye confirmed the absence of relevant distortion artifacts. CONCLUSIONS. Micro-MRI allows ex vivo and in vivo visualization and quantification of the spatial arrangement of the anterior eye segment. Imaging of the retroiridian region, including the entire crystalline lens, overcomes a number of major limitations in the quantitative evaluation of the anterior segment.

Then we took the strongest predictive value and added all history-related and ultrasound factors to run a stepdown multivariate logistic regression. All the variables were then dichotomized and sensitivity models only for statistically significant parameters were calculated. We identified the following predictive factors for each outcome: for severe SGA: EFWc with p< 0. 001, uterine artery pulsatility index (UtA PI) with p< 0. 002. For moderate SGA: EFWc with p< 0. 001, UtA PI with p< 0. 004, maternal preeclampsia p< 0. 002. For moderate and severe LGA: EFWc with p< 0. 001. We can detect in a low-risk population a group at risk of growth deviations. Adding Doppler velocimetry to 30 - 32 weeks EFWc improves the specificity (84 %) regarding SGA newborns, maintaining a good sensitivity (71 %), and reducing the population to be re-screened from 27 to 17 %. An ultrasound examination at 34 - 36 weeks or the clinical assessment of maternal risk factors remain the best tools for LGA newborns...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{quality of}} a {{biometric}} sample is one ofthe main criteria having a direct influence on the overallperformance of a biometric system. There are many existingresearches focusing on biometric sample quality assessment,but different evaluation approaches measure different qualityattributes {{and most of them}} focus on measuring modalitybasedattributes. Meanwhile, different biometric modalitiesseem to be isolated from each other in the image qualityevaluation process. Quality metrics that can evaluate multimodalitybiometric sample quality is rarely considered. Thelink of sample quality evaluation between different modalitiescan be established by using image-based quality metrics, whichare able to assess image-based quality attributes. This couldbe the solution of developing multi-modality <b>biometric</b> samplequality <b>evaluation</b> approaches especially when the fingerprintacquisition sensor becomes contactless. In order to investigatethe common framework of biometric sample quality assessmentbetween contactless fingerprint, face, and iris, we will firstreview the commonly used image-based quality attributes forthree modalities by surveying existing literature. Based on thesurvey, we identify and categorize these attributes to propose arefined selection of important ones for the assessment of multimodalitybiometric sample quality...|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{compare the}} dynamic changes of {{anterior}} segment parameters especially iris morphology induced by pharmacologic mydriasis between angle closure suspects and normal controls. METHODS: The study group comprised 19 eyes of 19 angle closure suspects and 19 eyes of 19 age- and sex-matched normal open-angle eyes. Pentacam and {{optical coherence tomography}} measurements before and 30 min after instillation of compound tropicamide eye drop were performed and compared. <b>Biometric</b> <b>evaluations</b> of iris tomography and anterior chamber angle were estimated by a customized image-processing software. RESULTS: Baseline axial length, iris cross sectional area and volume {{did not differ significantly}} between angle closure suspects and normal controls. Angle closure suspects had smaller pupil size, narrower anterior segment dimension and axial length, thinner iris with greater curve in comparison with normal controls. Pharmacologic mydriasis led to significant increments in iris thickness at 750 μm, anterior chamber depth and volume, whereas significant decrements in iris curve, cross sectional area and volume in both groups. Angle opening distance at 500 μm was increased significantly in normal controls (from 0. 465 ± 0. 115 mm to 0. 539 ± 0. 167 mm, P = 0. 009), but not in angle closure suspects (from 0. 125 ± 0. 100 mm to 0. 145 ± 0. 131 mm, P = 0. 326). Iris volume change per millimeter of pupil dilation (△IV/△PD) decreased significantly less in angle closure suspects than normal controls (- 2. 47 ± 1. 33 mm 2 vs - 3. 63 ± 1. 58 mm 2, P = 0. 019). Linear regression analysis showed that the change of angle opening distance at 500 μm was associated most with the change of central anterior chamber depth (β = 0. 841, P = 0. 002) and △IV/△PD (β = 0. 028, P = 0. 002), followed by gender (β = 0. 062, P = 0. 032). CONCLUSION: Smaller iris volume decrement per millimeter of pupil dilation is related significantly with the less anterior angle opening in angle closure suspects after pharmacologic mydriasis. Dynamic iris change may be as a prospective indicator of iris compressibility and angle closure glaucoma...|$|R
40|$|The {{notion of}} quality in <b>biometric</b> system <b>evaluation</b> {{has often been}} {{restricted}} to raw image quality, with a prediction of failure leaving no other option but to acquire another sample image of the subject at large. The very nature {{of this sort of}} failure prediction is very limiting for both identifying situations where algorithms fail, and for automatically compensating for failure conditions. Moreover, when expressed in a ROC curve, image quality paints an often misleading picture regarding its potential to predict failure. In this paper, we extend previous work on predicting algorithmic failures via similarity surface analysis. To generate the surfaces used for comparison, we define a set of new features derived from distance measures or similarity scores from a recognition system. For learning, we introduce support vector machines as yet another approach for accurate classification. A large set of scores from facial recognition algorithms are evaluated, including EBGM, Robust PCA, Robust Revocable PCA, and a leading commercial algorithm. Experimental results show that we can reliably predict biometric system failure using the SVM approach. 1. ...|$|R
