"Apart from you, mother, {{and knowing}} you now indeed to be widowed, and {{with on the}} one hand such {{contradictory}} commands from the Emperor as made me sorely ashamed of myself, of my nation, and of the man whom I loved and esteemed personally the most on earth, yet bound there by his express command, while I saw my tender wife's health wasting in the climate day by day! Yet still, while most she gasped for a breath of Swabian hills, she ever declared it would kill her outright to send her from me. And thus it went on till I laid her in the stately church of her own patroness. Then how it would have fared with me and the helpless little ones I know not, but for thy noble godmother, my Vittoria, the wise and ready helper of all in trouble, the only friend thy mother had made at Rome, and who had been able, from all her heights of learning and accomplishment, to value my Thekla's golden soul in its simplicity. Even then, when too late, came one of the Kaisar's kindest letters, recalling me,--a letter whose every word I would have paid for with a drop of my own blood six weeks before! and which he had only failed to send because his head was running on the plan of that gorgeous tomb where he is not <b>buried!</b> <b>Well,</b> at least it brought us home to you again once more, mother, and, where you are, comfort never has been utterly absent from me. And then, coming from the wilful gloom of Pope Leo's court into our Germany, streamed over by the rays of Luther's light, {{it was as if a}} new world of hope were dawning, as if truth would no longer be muffled, and the young would grow up to a world far better and purer than the old had ever seen. What trumpet-calls those were, and how welcome was the voice of the true Catholic faith no longer stifled! And my dear old Kaisar, with his clear eyes, his unfettered mind--he felt the power and truth of those theses. He bade the Elector of Saxony well to guard the monk Luther as a treasure. Ah! had he been a younger man, or had he been more firm and resolute, able to act as well as think for himself, things might have gone otherwise with the Church. He could think, but could not act; and now we have a man who acts, but WILL not think. It may have been a good day for our German reputation among foreign princes when Charles V. put on the crown; but only two days in my life have been as mournful to me as that when I stood by Kaisar Max's death-bed at Wells, and knew that generous, loving, fitful spirit was passing away from the earth! Never owned I friend I loved so well as Kaisar Max! Nor has any Emperor done so much for this our dear land." ...|$|E

50|$|It is {{unlikely}} that a reactor's fuel elements would be spread over a wide area because the fuel elements in solid-core nuclear thermal rockets are designed to withstand very high temperatures (up to 3500K) and high pressures (up to 200 atm): they are composed of very strong materials such as carbon composites or carbides and are normally coated with zirconium hydride. Conventionally, the solid core NTR fuel itself is {{a small percentage of}} U-235 <b>buried</b> <b>well</b> inside an extremely strong carbon or carbide mixture. The radioactivity of these elements is quite low and would pose a minimal hazard unless the physically small reactors have been run for an extended period.|$|E
50|$|The Thistleton {{area has}} shown {{evidence}} of Romano-British occupation including a large temple precinct {{and a possible}} small market settlement. To {{the north of the}} village there has been extensive mining for ironstone, a stone that has featured very prominently in the building of many churches and other buildings in the area for centuries. It was thought that the mining had obliterated evidence of the former greater extent of the village but much archaeology has survived showing that the original Romano-British settlement extended some 100 acre at least. Extensive surveys, brought about by the planning of a haulage road to the quarry to pass through the site of the ancient township, revealed features including a well preserved Roman road and the skeleton of a child <b>buried</b> <b>well</b> away from the cemetery. The archaeology is ongoing as the mining continues.|$|E

5000|$|Douglas Corporation, {{the local}} {{authority}} {{responsible for the}} area, persuaded the Isle of Man Tramways & Electric Power Company to build a line serving the hilly area of Upper Douglas in return for an extended franchise to operate the horse tramway. The line was built to [...] narrow gauge. Douglas Corporation acquired the tramway in 1902 {{after the collapse of}} Dumbbell's Bank and the section south of the depot in York Road was closed as it was felt that the gradient made it too dangerous to operate. The service was downgraded to seasonal in 1922. After the line closed, the tracks remained in place until they were lifted in 1932. (in contradiction to this source however road works in the past - 1980's - revealed some of the rails <b>buried</b> <b>well</b> under the modern road surface, in addition in Waverley Road on the Depot Entrance a set of tramway rails and points remain, however this may actually be from the time that the depot was used to service the horsetrams - they were towed up to the depot using double decker buses).

5000|$|The Kanangra-Boyd Wilderness {{is among}} {{the largest and most}} rugged {{wilderness}} areas in New South Wales. Situated to the south of [...] in the Blue Mountains and the Kanangra-Boyd National Parks, this folded belt or [...] "Rim Rock" [...] area is markedly different from the Permo-Triassic sandstone dominated landforms which comprise the rest of the Blue Mountains. There are isolated residual cappings of Permian sandstone in a few places but here the Palaeozoic basement rocks, which are elsewhere <b>buried</b> <b>well</b> below the Permo-Triassic Measures, are on the surface as high land. Rock types include quartzite, diorite, Devonian rhyolites, rhyo-dacites, Silurian phyllites, slates, siltstones and tuff limestones. The Boyd Plateau comprises a dome of Devonian granite intruded into Devonian quartzites and sedimentaries. There are also intrusive igneous rocks from the Carboniferous period. Kanangra Tops at the south-eastern end of the Plateau is one of the Permian outliers. Its fringing fault scarp - Kanangra Walls - comprises Permian sedimentaries of the Capertee Group which rests unconformably on a Devonian Lambie Group Basement. Nearby Kanangra Gorge is cut 600 - 900 m deep in rocks of the Lambie Group, and is one of Australia's deepest gorges. Cloudmaker and Guouogang are eroded remnants of Ordovician quartzite. Further east, in the Coxs River area, is the large Kanimbla granite batholith, implaced during the Carboniferous period. Colong Caves is another outstanding feature of the area. The main Upper Silurian limestone belt, in the Jenolan River valley to the north-west, is 300 m thick, 8 km long and located in a valley 460 m deep. This karst topography, created by the Jenolan and its tributaries, is one of the least understood in Australia.|$|E

40|$|Use of paleosols as {{the source}} of {{material}} for industries and handcrafts in past and present is one important aspect of applied paleopedological research. We studied in Tlaxcala State, Mexico, a stratum mined for traditional ceramic production to determine whether it is a paleosol and which properties made it appropriate for this handcraft. Morphological, micromorphological and pedochemical data showed that this stratum has properties of a <b>buried,</b> <b>well</b> developed Luvic Andosol. It has much higher clay content than overlying soils and sediments, due to pedogenetic processes: weathering of primary volcanic minerals (especially volcanic glass) and clay illuviation. We suppose that the suitable ratio between amorphous components and crystalline clay provides the combination of properties desirable for elaboration of ceramic. Kew words: applied paleopedology, buried paleosol, clay accumulation, weathering, illuviation, ceramic production.

40|$|Abstract: The {{signals from}} L 1 -band global {{positioning}} satellites {{are among the}} weakest in commercial and private wireless applications. The received power at the antenna of a GPS receiver is <b>buried</b> <b>well</b> below the integrated thermal noise floor. To successfully recover such weak signals, the receiver must have sufficiently high sensitivity, while rejecting out-of-band interferences. The {{purpose of this article}} is to describe the key system parameters that should be considered when designing a low-cost, lowcomponent-count, unassisted commercial GPS receiver. This system targets a received sensitivity of- 139 dBm. The Global Positioning System (GPS) is an elaborate satellitebased navigational system designed and funded by the United States Department of Defense. The system consists of 24 satellites that continually broadcast their positions and time around the Earth. These satellites travel in one of six orbits, usually with four satellites in each orbit. GPS receivers on earth can receive between five and twelve satellite signals. To acquire a position fix on earth, a minimum of four satellite signals is required—three ar...|$|E
40|$|To handle {{death may}} be a {{difficult}} task for the living. The deathof a person creates a turbulent situation {{that needs to be}} resolved. Ritual actions and burial practices performed within the frameworkof the prevailing social norms are {{a way to deal with}} conflictsand changed power relations. This paper deals with such issuesexemplified by the Pitted Ware burial practices seen in theburial ground at Ajvide, Eksta Parish on Gotland. The burial expressionsobserved from this site indicate the use of different ritualsin the treatment of the dead.
