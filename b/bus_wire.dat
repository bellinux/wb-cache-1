5000|$|There {{is a way}} of {{affecting}} {{this free}} motion of electrons, which is by use of an electric field. This process is known as electrical conduction. An electric field provides a potential difference along a wire of electrons, which creates a force, , where [...] is the charge of an electron and [...] is the magnitude of the electric field. That force accelerates the electrons, as expected by Newton’s second law. The electrons are given a velocity away from the (negative source of the) field, which leads to these collisions with the fixed ions. The collisions rid the electrons of their kinetic energy momentarily, transferring that energy to the ion lattice in the form of heat, until the field again provides this sort of [...] "push" [...] to the electrons. The net result of all of this pushing and stopping (or gaining of kinetic energy and then a release of it), is a small value called drift velocity. To better understand this concept, one could picture a busload of kids (electrons), who are energetically moving about on the <b>bus</b> (<b>wire).</b> The kids have instantaneous velocities, but after colliding with each other and bouncing back to their seats the average velocity of the kids is zero. However, as the bus moves forward, the kids have a small drift velocity {{in the direction of the}} motion of the bus. The drift that is opposite of the electric field is in fact an electric current.|$|E

Photolithography is {{undoubtedly}} {{the most widely}} used patterning method for the fabrication of micro- and nano- features, despite the recent development in some unconventional fabrication techniques that are poised to take over certain applications. But photolithography is still the main fabrication method in industry. To step forward in many applied areas, however, large-area, continuous fabrication system needs to be developed. However photolithography has not been extended to large area continuous patterning like other printing technologies. Photolithography is currently based on wafer scale fabrication and metal deposition process is performed under high vacuum condition. Here we report the development of continuous roll type contact photolithography which is termed photo roll lithography (PRL) and vacuum-free metal filling method. Continuous patterning is achieved was by employing a flexible photomask with Al patterns, which was fabricated by conventional photolithography method.

40|$|Many {{times there}} is a need to {{establish}} ratio communication between the surface and a beam enclosure. When one solicits communication companies for solutions, the answer is often to purchase expensive communication equipment such as repeaters or radiax type cable which can cost in the tens of thousands of dollars. This TM will describe an inexpensive solution to this problem and the results that can be expected. The cost of a passive repeater is $ 100 [...] $ 200 depending on how elaborate one wants to be. A passive repeater system consists of two antennas connected together with a transmission line. When using VHF or UHF transceivers, one can use 5 / 8 wave mobile antennas, such as the Larson NMO 406 -CK for the 400 [...] 420 MHz range, with the antenna connected to a 19 inch square piece of aluminum to act as a ground plane. This type of antenna has reasonably good gain, seems to be adequate, and is inexpensive. Another antenna choice is to cut a dipole out of <b>bus</b> <b>wire</b> and solder this wire to a female N connector. Using a dipole seems to work OK in the tunnel and avoids the problem of having a wire sticking down for people to poke their eye with. The cable connecting the antennas should be of good quality so that the signal lost in the cable is minimal. The authors chose Belden 9913 coax.

40|$|Abstract—A {{crosstalk}} effect {{leads to}} increases in delay and power consumption and, in the worst-case scenario, to inaccurate results. With the scale down of technology to deep-submicrometer level, the crosstalk effect between adjacent wires {{becomes more and more}} serious, particularly between long on-chip buses. In this paper, we propose a deassembler/ assembler technique to eliminate undesirable crosstalk effects on bus transmission. By taking advantage of the prefetch process, where the instruction/data fetch rate is always higher than the instruction/data commit rate, the proposed method incurs almost no penalty in terms of dynamic instruction count. In addition, when the bus width is 128 b, the required number of extra <b>bus</b> <b>wires</b> is only 7 as compared to the 85 extra <b>bus</b> <b>wires</b> needed in the work of Victor and Keutzer.

50|$|These cables use two {{parallel}} <b>bus</b> <b>wires</b> which carry electricity {{but do not}} create significant heat. They are encased in a semi-conductive polymer. This polymer is loaded with carbon; as the polymer element heats, it allows less current to flow. The cables are manufactured and then irradiated and by varying both the carbon content and the dosage then different tape with different output characteristics can be produced. There is then an inner jacket which separates the <b>bus</b> <b>wires</b> from the grounding braid. In commercial and industrial cables, an additional outer jacket of rubber or Teflon is applied. The benefits of this cable are the ability {{to cut to length}} in the field, It is more rugged but not necessarily more reliable than series or zone heaters, it cannot over-heat itself so in theory it can be crossed, but it is bad practice to install tape in this way. Self-regulating heating cables have a specific maximum exposure temperature based on the type of polymer which is used to make the heating core which means that if they are subject to high temperatures then the tape can be damaged beyond repair. Also self-limiting tapes are subject to high inrush currents on starting up similar to an 'induction' motor so a higher rated contactor is required.|$|R

Introduction As feature size of CMOS technology decreases, the balance between gate and wire delays is going worse, with wiring delays moving into dominance. The dominant wire delay causes many troubles in synchronous designs: since wire delays depend on the final physical design, the system performance strongly depends on physical implementation, so many design cycles are needed to obtain a correct circuit. Delay-insensitive asynchronous communication can simplify design, reducing sensitivity to circuit delays; nevertheless, conventional delay-insensitive techniques (i. e. dual-rail coding) are expensive in terms of energy [1] [...] ...|$|R
