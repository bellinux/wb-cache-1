50|$|The railway opened using {{conventional}} four-wheel and <b>bogie</b> <b>coaches.</b> The {{tare weight}} of these coaches meant that {{only four of}} the <b>bogie</b> <b>coaches</b> could be hauled by the 2-6-2T locomotives. In an effort to increase loadings in 1908, the entire coaching stock was rebuilt as <b>bogie</b> <b>coaches</b> 33 ft long by 7 ft wide using steel frames and bodies. To further save weight the roofs were constructed using aluminium. Savings in weight meant the locomotives could now haul six of the larger coaches, significantly expanding capacity. This was an early example {{of the use of}} aluminium in construction of coaches to reduce the coaches' tare.|$|R

50|$|CarriagesThe railway {{originally}} {{had a total}} of eight four-wheeled coaches delivered in three batches; three were delivered in 1896 {{for the opening of}} the railway followed by one more shortly thereafter to cope with passenger demand, and a further batch of four arrived in 1905 with the second locomotive. Several parts of these vehicles were saved from the site after closure resulting in ultimate restoration of many of the coaches both on the railway and off-island. The restored railway now operates with a set of three <b>bogie</b> <b>coaches</b> that were built between 1985 and 1994 by the railway's volunteers on two second hand underframes from Doddington and a new steel underframe constructed in 1993. The railway also has a restored set of four of the original four-wheeled toastrack coaches which are used for special services. In 2014 it was announced that the railway's three main <b>bogie</b> <b>coaches</b> built in the 1980s/90s were becoming life expired and beyond economic repair, so thanks to Lottery Funding three new <b>bogie</b> <b>coaches</b> have been constructed on new frames and incorporate facilities for wheelchair passengers.
