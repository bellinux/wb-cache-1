5|$|The fruit <b>bodies</b> <b>are</b> used as {{a primary}} food source by the red {{squirrel}} Sciurus vulgaris, and have a higher protein content than the other mushrooms typically consumed by this species.

5|$|Geastrum triplex is a {{saprobic}} fungus: it derives {{nutrients from}} decomposing organic matter. The fruit <b>bodies</b> <b>are</b> usually found growing singly or more commonly in groups in hardwood forests where much humus has accumulated; in Mexico, {{they have been}} collected in tropical deciduous forest. Fruit <b>bodies</b> <b>are</b> often found around well-rotted tree stumps; they are initially almost buried in the loose duff, but emerge during maturity as the downward curling of the rays exposes the spore sac. Old fruit <b>bodies</b> <b>are</b> persistent, and may survive the winter to be found the following spring or summer. A Dutch study reported a propensity for G.triplex to grow on soil made calcium-rich from washed-out chalk of crushed shells on bicycling paths. It is described as common in North America and Europe. One author states it is commonly found under beech trees.|$|E
5|$|Growing in {{woodland}} among moss, {{plant detritus}} or other habitats, the L.lubrica fruit <b>bodies</b> <b>are</b> typically found in large numbers, though they can grow in tight clumps or even individually. The species feeds as a saprotroph. The youngest fruit <b>bodies</b> <b>are</b> small and conical, but the fertile head quickly grows from the stalk. It {{is often described}} as inedible, despite its common name, but has also been reported as edible and even good. L.lubrica has been recorded in Europe, North America, Asia and Australasia.|$|E

5|$|Mycena clariviolacea {{is known}} only from Kanagawa, Japan. Fruit <b>bodies</b> <b>are</b> found growing solitary or scattered, on dead fallen twigs in forests that are {{dominated}} by oak and chinquapin trees. The mushroom fruits from June to September.|$|E
5|$|Mycena fonticola {{is known}} only from Kanagawa, Japan. Fruit <b>bodies</b> <b>are</b> found solitary or scattered, on dead leaves and twigs in low-elevation forests {{dominated}} by the oak species Quercus myrsinaefolia and Q.serrata.|$|E

5|$|Mycena lanuginosa {{is known}} only from Kanagawa, in Honshu, Japan. Fruit <b>bodies</b> <b>are</b> found solitary or scattered, on dead leaves and twigs in lowland forests {{dominated}} by the oak species Quercus myrsinifolia and Q.serrata. Fruiting occurs from March to November.|$|E
5|$|Phellinus ellipsoideus {{has been}} {{recorded}} growing on the fallen wood of oaks of the subgenus Cyclobalanopsis, {{as well as the}} wood of other flowering plants. The species favours the trunks of trees, where it feeds as a saprotroph, causing white rot. P.ellipsoideus fruit <b>bodies</b> <b>are</b> perennial growers, allowing them to, in the correct circumstances, grow very large. The species is found in the tropical and subtropical areas of China; it {{has been recorded}} in Fujian Province and Hainan Province. It is not a common species, and fruit <b>bodies</b> <b>are</b> only occasionally encountered.|$|E
5|$|Promyelocytic leukaemia bodies (PML <b>bodies)</b> <b>are</b> spherical bodies found {{scattered}} throughout the nucleoplasm, measuring around 0.1–1.0 µm. They are known {{by a number of}} other names, including nuclear domain 10 (ND10), Kremer bodies, and PML oncogenic domains. PML <b>bodies</b> <b>are</b> named after one of their major components, the promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML). They are often seen in the nucleus in association with Cajal bodies and cleavage bodies. PML bodies belong to the nuclear matrix, an ill-defined super-structure of the nucleus proposed to anchor and regulate many nuclear functions, including DNA replication, transcription, or epigenetic silencing. The PML protein is the key organizer of these domains that recruits an ever-growing number of proteins, whose only common known feature to date is their ability to be SUMOylated. Yet, pml-/- mice (which have their PML gene deleted) cannot assemble nuclear bodies, develop normally and live well, demonstrating that PML <b>bodies</b> <b>are</b> dispensable for most basic biological functions.|$|E

50|$|Chassis {{numbers for}} the DC 27 {{ambulance}} went from 54000 to 54499. The <b>bodies</b> <b>were</b> first built by Barker & Co.; some later <b>bodies</b> <b>were</b> built by Hooper & Co..

25|$|The <b>body</b> <b>was</b> {{first put}} {{on display in}} the Eden Museum. Because it drew such large crowds city {{authorities}} insisted that the <b>body</b> <b>be</b> moved and closed the exhibit. The body then became part of a freak show in a Montreal circus. When the show went bankrupt the <b>body</b> <b>was</b> abandoned and left in a warehouse. In 1907, the <b>body</b> <b>was</b> found by a group of children. It was subsequently claimed by the University of Montreal for research purposes. The <b>body</b> <b>was</b> later mummified and put on display in a glass case.|$|R

5000|$|After the sinking, 57 <b>bodies</b> <b>were</b> {{retrieved}} and identified; 66 <b>bodies</b> <b>were</b> retrieved {{but were}} unidentifiable. A number of <b>bodies</b> <b>were</b> trapped inside the sunken wreckage, and these <b>bodies</b> <b>were</b> left in place: [...] "A {{decision was made}} to leave the boat and entrapped bodies undisturbed" [...] notes Arthur Anslyn, Captain of the Caribe Queen, who was hired by the Commission of Inquiry to dive the site after August 1".|$|R
5|$|The fruit <b>bodies</b> <b>are</b> {{typically}} found growing in large numbers, sometimes in clumps, though solitary specimens are occasionally encountered. Several bodies can be connected at their bases, or younger bodies can {{grow out of}} the bases of older ones. The youngest fruit <b>bodies</b> <b>are</b> conical in shape. When the body reaches around 2mm in length, {{the tip of the}} cone begins to expand, forming the head. This is the stage at which the hymenium becomes differentiated {{from the rest of the}} body, and the bodies quickly reach their mature form, maturing only through growth after that point. Fruit bodies can be infected by the mould Hypomyces leotiarum.|$|E
5|$|The ketone <b>bodies</b> <b>are</b> {{possibly}} anticonvulsant in themselves; {{in animal}} models, acetoacetate and acetone protect against seizures. The ketogenic diet results in adaptive changes to brain energy metabolism {{that increase the}} energy reserves; ketone <b>bodies</b> <b>are</b> a more efficient fuel than glucose, {{and the number of}} mitochondria is increased. This may help the neurons to remain stable in the face of increased energy demand during a seizure, and may confer a neuroprotective effect.|$|E
5|$|The mycelia of M.stylobates, when {{grown in}} pure culture, is bioluminescent, a {{phenomenon}} first reported in 1931. The fruit <b>bodies</b> <b>are</b> {{not known to}} be bioluminescent.|$|E

5|$|A {{saprobic}} species, Entoloma murrayi derives nutrients {{by breaking}} down organic matter.

5|$|Agaricus hondensis {{mushrooms}} are toxic, and consuming the fruit bodies causes gastroenteritis. Some fruit bodies smell of creosote, an odor that {{becomes even more}} prevalent if the {{mushrooms are}} cooked. Cooking also introduces an unpleasant soapy-metallic flavor. The fruit <b>bodies</b> <b>are</b> used as food by the vagrant shrew (Sorex vagrans) and the American shrew mole (Neurotrichus gibbsii). Relatively high levels of the chemical hydroquinone are present in fruit bodies.|$|E

40|$|The {{endoplasmic}} reticulum (ER) <b>body</b> <b>is</b> a characteristic structure derived from ER and {{is referred to}} as a proteinase-sorting system that assists the plant cell under various stress conditions. Fluorescent ER <b>bodies</b> <b>were</b> observed in transgenic plants of Arabidopsis expressing green fluorescent protein fused with an ER retention signal. ER <b>bodies</b> <b>were</b> widely distributed in the epidermal cells of whole seedlings. In contrast, rosette leaves had no ER bodies. We found that wound stress induced the formation of many ER bodies in rosette leaves. ER <b>bodies</b> <b>were</b> also induced by treatment with methyl jasmonate (MeJA), a plant hormone involved in the defense against wounding and chewing by insects. The induction of ER <b>bodies</b> <b>was</b> suppressed by ethylene. An electron microscopic analysis showed that typical ER <b>bodies</b> <b>were</b> induced in the non-transgenic rosette leaves treated with MeJA. An experiment using coi 1 and etr 1 - 4 mutant plants showed that the induction of ER <b>bodies</b> <b>was</b> strictly coupled with the signal transduction of MeJA and ethylene. These results suggested that the formation of ER <b>bodies</b> <b>is</b> a novel and unique type of endomembrane system in the response of plant cells to environmental stresses. It is possible that the biological function of ER <b>bodies</b> <b>is</b> related to defense systems in higher plants...|$|R
