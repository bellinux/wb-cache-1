5|$|Shortly {{after being}} hired {{he was taken}} aside by the news {{producer}} and asked to read the on-air bulletin for the nightly broadcast. He read the news for three months until one night when he condensed a six-minute bulletin into three minutes. He attributed this to stage fright, which caused him to speak too fast. The rest of the production crew were not {{ready to move on}} to the next news items, leaving Harries standing in silence for several minutes. Harries recalled in a 2007 interview that Steve Morrison, the producer of the bulletin, called him into his office and berated him, telling him he did not deserve to be on television and that he would no longer <b>be</b> <b>reading</b> the news. Morrison's remarks angered Harries to such a point that he assaulted the man. Aware that he was going to lose his job, he contacted a Granada colleague who got him a new job at Granada's London centre, which he took up at the age of 23.|$|E

25|$|The Kangxi Emperor was a workaholic, rising {{early and}} {{retiring}} late, reading {{and responding to}} numerous memorials every day, conferring with his councilors and giving audiences– and this was in normal times; in wartime, he might <b>be</b> <b>reading</b> memorials from the warfront until after midnight or even, as with the Dzungar conflict, away on campaign in person.|$|E
25|$|After singing The Star-Spangled Banner, {{while the}} {{opposing}} team is being introduced, members of the student section take out {{a copy of the}} student-run newspaper, The University Daily Kansan, and wave the paper in front of their faces, pretending to <b>be</b> <b>reading</b> it in an effort to show lack of interest in {{the opposing team}}. After the opponents are introduced, a short video is shown, detailing the history and the accomplishments of Kansas basketball. As the Jayhawks are introduced, the students rip up their newspapers and throw the confetti pieces of paper in the air as celebration. Whatever confetti remains is typically thrown in the air after the first basket made by the Jayhawks.|$|E
25|$|Schorr {{attracted}} {{the anger of}} Richard Nixon's White House. In 1971, after a dispute with White House aides, Schorr's friends, neighbors, and co-workers were questioned by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) about his habits. They were told that Schorr was under consideration for a high-level position in the environmental area. Schorr knew nothing about it. Later, during the Watergate hearings, {{it was revealed that}} Nixon aides had drawn up what became known as Nixon's Enemies List, and Daniel Schorr was on that list. Famously, Schorr read the list aloud on live TV, surprised to <b>be</b> <b>reading</b> his own name in that context. Schorr won Emmys for news reporting in 1972, 1973, and 1974.|$|E

25|$|Descartes saw his Meditations as {{providing}} the metaphysical underpinning {{of his new}} physics. Like Galileo, he sought to overturn {{what he saw as}} two-thousand-year-old prejudices injected into the Western tradition by Aristotle. The Aristotelian thought of Descartes' day placed a great weight on the testimony of the senses, suggesting that all knowledge comes from the senses. The Meditator's suggestion that all one's most certain knowledge comes from the senses is meant to appeal directly to the Aristotelian philosophers who will <b>be</b> <b>reading</b> the Meditations. The motivation, then, behind the First Meditation is to start in a position the Aristotelian philosophers would agree with and then, subtly, to seduce them away from it. Descartes is aware of how revolutionary his ideas are, and must pay lip service to the orthodox opinions of the day in order to be heeded.|$|E

He also said that the film will be a two-hour representation of a twenty-four-hour time frame. Sutherland described the film production as [...] "exciting" [...] because, [...] "It's going to be a two-hour representation of a 24 hour day, so {{we were not going to}} be restrained by the real time aspect of the TV show." ...|$|E

500|$|Connelly gained public {{recognition}} with Jim Henson's 1986 film Labyrinth with David Bowie, {{in which}} she played Sarah, a teenager on a quest to rescue her brother Toby {{from the world of}} goblins. Although a disappointment at the box office, the film later became a cult classic. The New York Times, while noting the importance of her part, panned her portrayal: [...] "Jennifer Connelly as Sarah is unfortunately disappointing. ... She looks right, but she lacks conviction and seems to <b>be</b> <b>reading</b> rehearsed lines that are recited without belief in her goal or real need to accomplish it." [...] Two years later, she starred as a ballet student in the Italian film Étoile, and portrayed college student Gabby in Michael Hoffman's Some Girls.|$|E
500|$|Franco {{developed}} an aptitude for art—painting in particular—during {{his high school}} years while attending the California State Summer School for the Arts (CSSSA). Franco has said painting was the [...] "outlet" [...] he needed in high school, and he [...] "has actually been painting longer than he has been acting". His paintings were displayed publicly {{for the first time}} at the Glü Gallery in Los Angeles, from January 7, through February 11, 2006. He launched his first European art exhibition in 2011 at Peres Projects in Berlin. He enjoys reading on the set of his films. Pineapple Express producer Judd Apatow has said of him: [...] "He's a very education-minded person. We used to laugh because in between takes he'd <b>be</b> <b>reading</b> The Iliad on set. We still haven't read The Iliad. It was a very difficult book. With him, it was always James Joyce or something".|$|E

500|$|Halfway {{through the}} casting process, Cardiac Arrest actress Helen Baxendale became available. BAFTA Scotland award-nominated Baxendale {{was seen as}} a coup, though she was {{hesitant}} to audition as she believed that she could not do comedy. Harries persuaded her that she was more than qualified, citing her comedic performance in Cardiac Arrest. She was cast as Rachel on the basis of her chemistry at the audition with Nesbitt. Fay Ripley assumed that she would <b>be</b> <b>reading</b> for the role of Rachel, and was surprised to be auditioning for Jenny. Many of the actresses seen for the part were [...] "finger-wagging" [...] and [...] "predictable", an approach Ripley did not take. Raised in Surrey, Ripley had to adopt a Manchester accent for the part. She [...] "managed to bodge together a sort of Manchester accent" [...] for the audition, assuming that she would not get the part. When she was cast, she worked on improving the accent by spending time talking to local people.|$|E
500|$|The {{income from}} the concerts did not permit generous {{rehearsal}} time. Wood had nine hours to rehearse all the music for each week's six concerts. To gain the best results on so little rehearsal, Wood developed two facets of his conducting that remained his trademark throughout his career. First, he bought sets of the orchestral parts and marked them all with minutely detailed instructions to the players; secondly he developed a clear and expressive conducting technique. An orchestral cellist wrote that [...] "if you watched him, you couldn't come in wrong." [...] The violist Bernard Shore wrote, [...] "You may <b>be</b> <b>reading</b> at sight in public, but you can't possibly go wrong with that stick in front of you". Thirty-five years after Wood's death, André Previn recounted a story {{by one of his}} players who recalled that Wood [...] "had everything planned out and timed to the minute ... at 10a.m. precisely his baton went down. You learned things so thoroughly with him, but in the most economical time." ...|$|E
500|$|Kim Newman and Alan Jones {{suggest that}} the mysteries of Arthur Conan Doyle, Rex Stout and Agatha Christie were all obvious {{influences}} on Tenebrae, {{and there are many}} references to these authors throughout the film. One example is the use of a quote from Sherlock Holmes in Conan Doyle's novel The Sign of Four (1890): [...] "How often have I said to you that when you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth?" [...] A variation of this quote is delivered many times in Tenebrae. Another reference is the dog attack: as something of a non sequitur, the scene is thought by Newman to be a likely nod to Conan Doyle's The Hound of the Baskervilles (1901–1902). Neal is seen to <b>be</b> <b>reading</b> this novel in an early scene. The imagery in the beach flashback references the American mystery film Suddenly, Last Summer (1959), especially the scene of Eva Robin's wearing white while kneeling in the sand, which is a direct reference to Elizabeth Taylor in that film.|$|E

500|$|The band {{contacted}} local Toronto artist Oli Goldsmith {{who happened}} to <b>be</b> <b>reading</b> the same book, to create the artwork for the upcoming album. In total, he made around 200 paintings relating to the project, {{many of which were}} used for the album art, promotional singles and the band's website. Based on the success of that commission, the record label asked him to also create and direct music videos for the singles [...] "In Repair" [...] and [...] "Right Behind You (Mafia)", which took his paintings and brought them to life with animation and stylized live motion. His artwork was described as [...] "Integrating photographs, logos, television images, signs, as well as a variety of written forms, such as epigrams and poetry, Goldsmith's art juxtaposes the unexpected, resulting in pieces that are bold, colourful, and energetic." [...] When the album insert is unfolded, it reveals a surrealistic panorama that appears to be set in a hospital. The official photo shoot for Spiritual Machines took place on October 7, 2000 on the sixth floor of St. Joseph's Health Centre in Toronto, formerly an intensive-care unit.|$|E
500|$|Stephen King {{called the}} series [...] "a feat of which only a {{superior}} imagination is capable", and declared [...] "Rowling's punning, one-eyebrow-cocked sense of humor" [...] to be [...] "remarkable". However, {{he wrote that}} despite the story being [...] "a good one", he is [...] "a little tired of discovering Harry {{at home with his}} horrible aunt and uncle", the formulaic beginning of all seven books. King has also joked that [...] "Rowling's never met an adverb she did not like!" [...] He does however predict that Harry Potter [...] "will indeed stand time's test and wind up on a shelf where only the best are kept; I think Harry will take his place with Alice, Huck, Frodo, and Dorothy and this is one series not just for the decade, but for the ages". Sameer Rahim of The Daily Telegraph disagreed, saying [...] "It depresses me to see 16 and 17 year-olds reading the series when they could <b>be</b> <b>reading</b> the great novels of childhood such as Oliver Twist or A House for Mr Biswas. What that says about the adults who are fanatical fans I’m not sure – but I suspect in years to come people will make a link between our plump, comfortable, infantilising society and the popularity of Potter." ...|$|E
500|$|His biographer Suetonius, {{writing about}} {{a century after}} Augustus' death, {{described}} his appearance as: [...] "...unusually handsome and exceedingly graceful at all periods of his life, though he cared nothing for personal adornment. He was so far from being particular about the dressing of his hair, {{that he would have}} several barbers working in a hurry at the same time, and as for his beard he now had it clipped and now shaved, while at the very same time he would either <b>be</b> <b>reading</b> or writing something... He had clear, bright eyes... His teeth were wide apart, small, and ill-kept; his hair was slightly curly and inclined to golden; his eyebrows met. His ears were of moderate size, and his nose projected a little at the top and then bent ever so slightly inward. His complexion was between dark and fair. He was short of stature, although Julius Marathus, his freedman and keeper of his records, says that he was five feet and nine inches (just under 5 ft. 7 in., or 1.70 meters, in modern height measurements), but this was concealed by the fine proportion and symmetry of his figure, and was noticeable only by comparison with some taller person standing beside him...", adding that [...] "his shoes [...] somewhat high-soled, to make him look taller than he really was" ...|$|E
