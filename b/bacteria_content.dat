Populations of mesophilic, lactic acid, coliform, and psychrotrophic bacteria were recovered from cantaloupe, tomato, pepper, spinach, endives, and parsley, {{and the effect}} of environmental and agricultural conditions toward epiphytic <b>bacteria</b> <b>content</b> was evaluated. The epiphytic <b>bacteria</b> <b>content</b> was variable by commodity, with cantaloupes and spinach being the most populated commodities. The environmental temperature and the irrigation method also affected the epiphytic <b>bacteria</b> <b>content.</b> To determine the inhibitory effect of epiphytic bacteria toward Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 and Salmonella enterica serovar Saintpaul, 9, 307 isolates were evaluated in vitro. In total, 2. 6, 0. 7 and 6. 4 % of the isolates were antagonistic toward E. coli O 157 :H 7, S. Saintpaul, or both pathogens, respectively. Most antagonistic isolates were psychrotrophs and lactic acid bacteria. Overall, more antagonistic isolates from fruits were found in samples collected in the fall than the summer. Further biochemical identification revealed that most of the antagonistic psychrotrophs were Alcaligenes faecalis sbsp. faecalis. In fruits, most of the antagonistic isolates were Leuconostoc, Enterococcus, and Streptococcus species. Furthermore, the effect of epiphytic bacteria toward S. Saintpaul growth in fruits and toward E. coli O 157 :H 7 growth in leafy green leaves was studied in the plant surface. Enterococcus kobei and Enterococcus casseliflavus from cantaloupe, and of Staphylococcus hominis subsp. hominis from tomato inhibited S. Saintpaul on cantaloupe rind, and tomato skin, respectively. Similarly, Enterococcus faecalis affected S. Saintpaul on peppers and Gemella morbillorum, Enterococcus gallinarum, and Bacillus mycoides affected E. coli O 157 :H 7 growth on parsley. The effect of Streptococcus alactolyticus, Bacillus licheniformis, Gemella bergeri, Staphylococcus sciuri, and Enterococcus gallinarum toward E. coli O 157 :H 7 growth and stomata invasion in endives was observed using confocal microscopy. After 24 h, E. coli O 157 :H 7 growth was moderately inhibited by all epiphytic isolates tested. However, after three days, treated and control samples presented similar pathogen growth. The results from this study demonstrated that some epiphytic bacteria from fruits and leafy greens are potential biocontrol agents, able to reduce the proliferation of E. coli O 157 :H 7 and S. enterica in fruits and vegetables...|$|E

Usually, biological treatments are used to degrade a great quantity of these substances. However, most of the time, the microorganisms are not adapted and the treatment can be blocked. Therefore, the first step to make a continuous reactor operative is the acclimation, i. e., the adaptation of the microorganisms to a specific substrate. During this particular step of the process there is a selection and a multiplication of specialized microorganisms and physiological transformations can occur in their metabolic system. Furthermore, combining image processing techniques have already been successfully used to elucidate the activated sludge morphological changes for both aggregated and filamentous <b>bacteria</b> <b>contents,</b> during such processes. The experimental set-up is composed of an aerated reactor and a clarifier. The sludge is recycled from the clarifier by a peristaltic pump. The complete mixing inside the reactor is guaranteed by the diffusion of air from its bottom. The reactor was inoculated with biomass collected from a wastewater treatment plant and fed with an artificial wastewater based on meat extract. During acclimation, chemical parameters were measured in the influent, reactor and effluent, in order to verify the stability of the process. To complete the evaluation of the process, microscopy acquisition and image processing and analysis techniques were performed for aggregates and filamentous bacteria characterization for bright field, Gram and poly-β-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) staining images.

However, depending on the process operation conditions, several malfunctions could take place, in which filamentous bulking and deflocculation processes, such as pin-point flocs, are the most common problems, causing the sludge settling ability decrease and effluent quality deterioration. Bright field Image analysis is nowadays considered a powerful tool to quantitatively characterize aggregated and filamentous bacteria. Furthermore, the use of epifluorescent staining techniques, coupled to image analysis, presents a promising method to determine bacteria gram nature and viability. Encouraged by the success of image analysis procedures over the last years, the present work studied a lab-scale activated sludge system, under operation conditions causing filamentous bulking and pin-point flocs phenomena. Sludge settling ability and turbidity values were measured verifying the nature of the settling problem. COD contents, as well as nitrogen contents, in terms of N-NH 4 +, N-NO 3 - and N-NO 2 -, were surveyed in the feeding effluent, reactor bulk and settler. Regarding the biomass characterization, four major morphological descriptors groups were studied, covering free filamentous <b>bacteria</b> <b>contents,</b> aggregates contents, aggregates size and aggregates morphology.

As a result of that, in this work, image analysis routines were developed in Matlab environment, allowing the identification and characterization of microbial aggregates and protruding filaments. Moreover, the large amount of activated sludge data collected with the image analysis implementation can be subsequently treated by multivariate statistical procedures such as PLS. In the current work the implementation of image analysis and PLS techniques has shown to provide important information for better understanding the behavior of activated sludge processes, and to predict, at some extent, the sludge volume index.

Large variability in emission of all parameters was observed across the 21 vacuums we assessed, which was largely not attributable to the range of determinant factors we assessed. Vacuum cleaner emissions contribute to indoor exposure to non-biological and biological aerosols when vacuuming, and this may vary markedly depending on the vacuum used...|$|E

A modified direct contact {{test was used to}} evaluate the antibacterial properties of four commercially available dental luting agents (RelyX Unicem, Ketac Cem, Ceramir Crown & Bridge and Harvard Cement) and two reference materials (glass-ionomer cement and calcium aluminate cement) compared to a negative-control material (PMMA). Streptococcus mutans bacteria were placed in direct contact with specimens that had been aged for 10 min, 1 day, and 7 days, in order to test the antibacterial properties of the materials. A metabolic assay containing resazurin was used to quantify the amount of viable bacteria remaining after the direct contact tests. The effects of pH and fluoride on bacteria proliferation were also evaluated. Strongest antibacterial properties were found for calcium aluminate cement, followed by Ceramir Crown & Bridge and RelyX Unicem. Ketac Cem, Harvard Cement, and the reference glass-ionomer cement showed <b>bacteria</b> <b>content</b> either higher than or not significantly different from the PMMA control in all instances. pH levels below 6. 3 and above 9. 0 were found to have negative effects on bacterial proliferation. No correlation between either acidic materials or fluoride release and antibacterial properties could be seen; rather, basic material...|$|E
40|$|Neonatal thymectomy in BALB/c mice {{has been}} {{described}} as a model of gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma (GML). By using this experimental system, we screened, for the first time to our knowledge, Helicobacter pylori GML-associated strains for their capacity to promote disease. A cohort of BALB/c mice underwent thymectomy at day 3 after birth (d 3 Tx). Successful thymic ablation was evaluated by the degree of lymphopenia in blood samples collected at 4 weeks of age. d 3 Tx and non-thymectomized controls were infected with either GML strains (B 38 or B 47) or control strains (SS 1 or TN 2 GF 4). Gastric samples collected at 6, 12, and 18 months after infection were studied for <b>bacteria</b> <b>content,</b> and submitted to histological, immunochemical, molecular, and immunological analyses. Severe gastric inflammation was only observed in d 3 Tx mice. In these animals, the gastric lamina propria was infiltrated with lymphoid cells organized in follicles composed of B cells with few infiltrating T cells. PCR of D/J IgH gene segments proved the monoclonality of infiltrating B cells, which strongly correlated with the presence of lymphoepithelial lesions. B-cell infiltrates were particularly prominent in mice infected with the B 47 -GML strain. No pathological changes were detected in noninfected d 3 Tx mice. We identified new H. pylori isolates adapted to the mouse stomach with high potential of GML development, which is only revealed in hosts rendered lymphopenic by neonatal thymic ablation...|$|E
40|$|Glutathione and soluble thiol content were {{examined}} in {{a broad spectrum of}} bacteria. Significant soluble thiol was present in all cases. The thiol compound was glutathione in most of the gram-negative bacteria but not in most of the gram-positive bacteria studied. Glutathione was absent in four anerobes and one microaerophile but was present in a blue-green <b>bacterium.</b> The glutathione <b>content</b> of Escherichia coli increased significantly during transition from exponential to stationary phase...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the quality of thermoduric bacteria and chemical quality of pasteurized milk stored with different time periods. The material was milk from the farmers that was pasteurized at 950 C for 21 seconds. The research Method used completely randomized design. The variables observed were TPC, Koliform, Kapang, E. coli <b>bacteria,</b> fat <b>content,</b> protein content, lactose content, total solid, and solid non fat (SNF). The results of the study showed that E. coli and Koliform were not found in pasteurized milk, but a number of thermoduric microbes were  found. Pasteurized milk has a shelf life of 30 days under 40 C ± 10 C conditions and has no significant changes in fat content, lactose levels, non-fat dry matter content and protein content...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT In this study, {{the effects}} of {{ultrasonic}} treatment and storage temperature on egg weight, spe-cific gravity, shell strength, albumen height, Haugh unit, color, pH, water activity, total mesophilic aero-bic <b>bacteria,</b> mineral <b>content,</b> and sensory properties were investigated. Ultrasonic treatment was used to improve egg properties. The lowest weight loss values were obtained with eggs treated with 15 min of ultra-sonic treatment and stored at 5 °C for 10 d. The higher specific gravity, shell strength, albumen height, and Haugh unit were observed in ultrasonic-treated eggs. The egg quality was significantly improved with ultra-sonic treatment (P < 0. 01). The total mesophilic aero-bic bacteria values of yolk and albumen decreased with increase in ultrasonic treatment time from 5 to 30 min. Ultrasonic treatment improved the sensory properties of egg shells. Effects of ultrasonic treatment and storage temperature on egg qualit...|$|R
