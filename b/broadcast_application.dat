30|$|For the Pinus radiata trial, <b>broadcast</b> <b>application</b> of CTH {{in spring}} of years 1 and 2 was most effective, with mean stand volume (m 3  ha− 1), at 2.5  years, {{exceeding}} the weed-free control and operational treatment by 8 and 11 %, respectively, although these {{differences were not}} statistically significant at the 5 % level. Use of the operational treatment as a spot in the first year, followed by <b>broadcast</b> <b>application</b> of CTH in the second year, was moderately effective when used with or without oversowing.

40|$|Land {{application}} of manure may produce unacceptable odors. Field experiments in undisturbed (no-till) soybean and corn residue {{were conducted to}} evaluate six liquid swine manure application/incorporation methods. The methods were injection with a commercial (1) chisel or (2) sweep, (3) incorporation with tandem disk harrow after <b>broadcast</b> <b>application,</b> (4) <b>broadcast</b> <b>application</b> with no incorporation, (5) injection with a narrow-profile knife, and (6) surface application behind row cleaners. The row cleaner and all injection treatments used spoke-covering wheels. Air samples over the soil surface were obtained immediately following and one day after manure application, and odor level was measured by olfactometry (i. e., the amount of air dilutions to reach odor threshold). Residue cover and yield were also measured. Incorporation techniques typically reduced odor level {{by a factor of}} three to ten as compared with a <b>broadcast</b> <b>application.</b> One day after application, odor was greatly reduced and often indistinguishable from that of untreated soil (no manure application). Residue cover differences among application methods were more pronounced in soybean residue. Application by the narrow-profile knife, row cleaner, and chisel maintained soybean residue cover better than other incorporation methods yet limited odor similar to these methods. Although cover was reduced over winter, greater soybean residue cover remained after planting with fall than with spring manure applications. Differences in odor level and residue cover among methods were less in corn than soybean residue. All incorporation techniques reduced odor levels, and chisel incorporation maintained corn residue cover after planting similar to <b>broadcast</b> <b>application.</b> For both crops, <b>broadcast</b> <b>application</b> maintained the greatest residue cover but had the highest odor level. Incorporation of manure generally reduced odor, reduced residue cover, increased corn yield, and did not affect soybean yield...|$|E

40|$|Primary non-target hazard {{assessment}} can be separated into two basic components: bait acceptance and toxicity. This bait acceptance study investigates the potential primary non-target hazard (direct consumption of bait pellets) that the <b>broadcast</b> <b>application</b> of rodenticide bait may pose to non-native feral cats and mongooses The {{study was conducted}} in 4 different forest habitats in Hawaii using 2 different commercial formulations of placebo bait pellets. We documented vertebrates that came to placebo bait pellets at bait monitoring stations to assess bait acceptance. Bait pellets were monitored at each site using 40 infrared (IR) monitors/data loggers and weatherproof automatic cameras. During the 80 days of the study, cameras operated for 76, 800 hours and recorded 21, 211 slides of vertebrates at bait stations. Rodents, the target species, were the largest group, documented at stations in 98. 98 % (n = 20, 994) of these photographs Feral cats were detected in 0. 09 % (n = 20) and mongooses in 0. 46 % (n = 97) of the slides of vertebrates at bait pellets. The 117 photos of feral cats and mongooses represent 44 occasions where these predators encountered bait pellets; in 14 of these the bait was eaten. These data suggest that the primary hazard to non-native feral cats and mongooses from the <b>broadcast</b> <b>application</b> of pelletized rodenticides is very low.
