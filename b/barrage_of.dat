5|$|General Clinton began {{movements}} {{to cross over}} to {{the northern end of}} Sullivan's Island. Assisted by two sloops of war, the flotilla of longboats carrying his troops came under fire from Colonel William Thomson's defenses. Facing a withering <b>barrage</b> <b>of</b> grape shot and rifle fire, Clinton abandoned the attempt.|$|E
5|$|According to Herodotus, Pausanias {{refused to}} advance because good omens were not divined in the goat sacrifices that were performed. At this point, as Greek {{soldiers}} {{began to fall}} under the <b>barrage</b> <b>of</b> arrows, the Tegeans started to run at the Persian lines. Offering one last sacrifice and a prayer to the heavens {{in front of the}} Temple of Hera, Pausanias finally received favourable omens and gave the command for the Spartans to advance, whereupon they also charged the Persian lines.|$|E
5|$|The {{economic}} {{policies of the}} New Deal leaders were often aligned with ACLU goals, but social goals were not. In particular, movies were subject to a <b>barrage</b> <b>of</b> local ordinances banning screenings that were deemed immoral or obscene. Even public health films portraying pregnancy and birth were banned; as was Life magazine's April 11, 1938 issue which included photos of the birth process. The ACLU fought these bans, but did not prevail.|$|E

5|$|After an {{hour and}} a half had gone (and twenty minutes had passed since the second attack) the Indonesians {{launched}} a third and final attack up the slope towards the base, which the British responded to with artillery and grenade fire. This defence was remarkably effective, and eventually the <b>barrage</b> <b>of</b> Indonesian rocket fire halted and the few remaining British soldiers rose from their hideouts and began to clear the perimeter. Soon afterwards, Gurkha soldiers and medical staff arrived at the base by helicopter, leaving the soldiers behind to secure the area and airlifting the wounded to a nearby hospital. By this point, however, Indonesian forces had withdrawn, effectively ending the battle.|$|E
5|$|Born {{and raised}} in Llandudno to Fred and Rose Southall, he was the middle child of three boys. Southall played youth {{football}} for his school team and the Llandudno Swifts, where he played alongside Joey Jones. He was educated at Ysgol John Bright, though left without any qualifications at age 16. At age 14 he toured Germany with the Llandudno Swifts and was offered {{a chance to play}} for the youth team of Bundesliga outfit Fortuna Düsseldorf, but decided against the move to Germany. The Swifts were a poor side that were regularly beaten heavily, though the near constant <b>barrage</b> <b>of</b> shots he faced enabled Southall to improve on his shot-stopping skills.|$|E
5|$|His next {{opponent}} was unbeaten West Ham-based fighter Kevin Lear on 1 June 2002, {{again in}} Manchester, on the undercard of the Ricky Hatton vs. Eamonn Magee fight. Lear, a former Amateur Boxing Association of England (ABA) champion, kept a one-dimensional Gomez at bay with his sharp jab {{from the outset}} of the fight. Gomez took several punches to the face, and his nose began to bleed heavily starting in the sixth round. By the eighth round Gomez was slowing, suffering the effects of Lear's continuing <b>barrage</b> <b>of</b> combinations. At the end of the eighth round Gomez's trainer Brian Hughes retired his fighter, giving Lear a surprise victory.|$|E
50|$|In May 1994, Israeli commandos kidnapped an Amal leader, Mustafa Dirani, and in June, an Israeli airstrike {{against a}} {{training}} camp killed 30-45 Hezbollah cadets. Hezbollah retaliated by firing four <b>barrages</b> <b>of</b> Katyusha rockets into northern Israel.|$|R

40|$|Neocortical neurons spontaneously fire action {{potentials}} during {{active network}} states; how are dendritic synaptic inputs {{integrated into the}} ongoing action potential output pattern of neurons? Here, the efficacy <b>of</b> <b>barrages</b> <b>of</b> simulated EPSPs generated at known dendritic sites on the rate and pattern of ongoing action potential firing is determined using multisite whole-cell recording techniques from rat layer 5 neocortical pyramidal neurons in vitro. Under quiescent conditions, the somatic impact of proximal (253 � 15 �m from soma; n � 28) dendritic <b>barrages</b> <b>of</b> simulated EPSPs was 4. 7 -fold greater than identical <b>barrages</b> <b>of</b> EPSPs generated from distal (572 � 13 �m from soma) sites. In contrast, <b>barrages</b> <b>of</b> proximal simulated EPSPs enhanced the rate of ongoing action potential firing, evoked by somatic simulated EPSPs, by only 1. 6 -fold more than distal simulated EPSPs. This relationship was apparent across a wide frequency range of action potential firing (6 – 22 Hz) and dendritic excitation (100 – 500 Hz). The efficacy of distal dendritic EPSPs was formed by the recruitment of active dendritic processes that transformed the ongoing action potential firing pattern, promoting action potential burst firing. Paired recordings (n � 42) revealed that patterns of action potential firing generated by concerted somatic and distal dendritic excitation reliably and powerfully drove postsynaptic excitation {{as a result of}} enhanced reliability of transmitter release during bursts of action potential firing. During active states, therefore, distal excitatory synaptic inputs decisively control the excitatory synaptic output of layer 5 neocortical pyramidal neurons and so powerfully influence network activity in the neocortex.

5|$|Ip {{figures out}} that Lin was beaten {{and killed by}} the Japanese after an earlier fight. Barely able to contain his rage, Ip demands a match with ten karateka at once. Despite having not practiced Wing Chun since the Japanese {{occupied}} their town (to conserve energy and thus food for his family), he mercilessly defeats all of them with a brutal and effective <b>barrage</b> <b>of</b> blows, showing none of the restraint he exhibited in earlier matches. His skill arouses the interest of General Miura, who wants {{to learn more about}} Ip and watch him fight again.|$|E

Homer keeps his {{anonymity}} while posting more rumors and finds out Mr. Burns plans to sell plutonium to terrorists and is later arrested by the CIA. Eventually, Mr. X wins the Pulitzer Prize for his journalistic achievements, despite nobody knowing who he is. When he hears that the prize money will be given to starving children, Homer reveals that he is Mr. X.|$|E
5|$|Miller {{played a}} vital role in the side's success in the Test series, {{particularly}} with the ball. Despite a back injury which meant he passed one Test without bowling, he took 13 wickets in the series at an average of 26.28, and also contributed 184 runs at an average of 23.15. He {{played a key role in}} subduing England's leading batsmen, Len Hutton and Denis Compton, with a <b>barrage</b> <b>of</b> short-pitched bowling, troubling Hutton to such an extent that he was dropped for the Third Test. In all first-class matches on the tour, Miller scored 1,088 runs at 47.30 and took 56 wickets at 17.58. Bradman gave him a light bowling workload during the tour matches, to keep him fresh for the Test matches.|$|E
50|$|The Koreans {{were unable}} to prevent the Japanese from {{draining}} the moat and thus having {{direct access to the}} defensive walls. The Japanese used siege towers, ladders, and the cover of arquebus-fire to scale the defense against <b>barrages</b> <b>of</b> arrows and rocks launched by the Koreans.|$|R
50|$|In September 2004 at 40 {{years of}} age, Thompson boxed the up-and-coming David Haye {{in a classic}} 'youth vs experience' matchup.

5000|$|Konovalov's {{submarine}} also laid five mine <b>barrages</b> <b>of</b> 52 mines {{during the}} war, {{one of which}} sunk a ship Henry Lütgens measuring 1141 GRT on January 29, 1945. A torpedo boat T 34 was also possibly sunk on mines laid by the L-3, on November 20, 1944.|$|R
5|$|On 19 and 20 October, the 4th Armoured Brigade was {{involved}} in its first action as a brigade in an attack towards the Savio River, with the 20th Armoured Regiment on the left flank. This was primarily a tank action, in contrast to previous battles in which the armour supported the infantry. Having advanced seven miles to complete its objectives, the regiment supported the 2nd Canadian Infantry Brigade in making its own attack across the river {{on the evening of}} 21 October. The regiment's Shermans fired an hour-long <b>barrage</b> <b>of</b> high explosive shells along their front to create a diversion, under the cover of which the Canadians made their own landings on the far bank of the Savio.|$|E
5|$|On July 29 the 1st Battalion {{suffered}} {{about 60}} casualties from North Korean mortar fire. As {{the men were}} preparing their perimeter defense for the night, a general panic arose, {{for reasons that are}} still unclear. Most of them deserted their positions in a state of alarm. Colonel White found himself, the 77th Combat Engineer Company, and a battery of the 159th Field Artillery Battalion all that was left in the front line. He had to personally reorganize the battalion as many of his officers were unable to get the men to listen to them. As White tried to rally his men, the field artillery maintained a sustained <b>barrage</b> <b>of</b> fire to slow the North Koreans advance. That night alone the artillery fired 3,000 rounds in holding back the North Koreans.|$|E
5|$|President Bill Clinton {{proposed}} a healthcare reform bill in 1993 {{that included a}} mandate for employers to provide health insurance to all employees through a regulated marketplace of health maintenance organizations. Republican Senators {{proposed a}}n alternative that would have required individuals, but not employers, to buy insurance. Ultimately the Clinton plan failed amid an unprecedented <b>barrage</b> <b>of</b> negative advertising funded by politically conservative groups and the health insurance industry and due to concerns that it was overly complex. Clinton negotiated a compromise with the 105th Congress to instead enact the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) in 1997.|$|E
25|$|Later that year, in his {{eleventh}} pro fight, {{he fought}} 40-year-old former WBO champion Carl Thompson in a 'youth vs. experience' match-up.

5|$|Rufus's {{gameplay}} {{has been}} compared to the fighting styles used by Street Fighter III characters Yun and Yang by the development team, notably in regards to his diving kick attack, and emphasized mobility while attacking. Other attacks were designed as a means to negate enemy offensives, such as the Galactic Tornado, which destroys enemy projectiles while drawing the opponent closer to Rufus for a final strike. His Ultra Combo, Space Opera Symphony, is a <b>barrage</b> <b>of</b> attacks that requires close proximity to the opponent, dealing several blows and ending in a final upwards blast.|$|E
5|$|Saumarez {{immediately}} {{moved to}} engage the French ship and managed to isolate the frigate and subject it to a fierce <b>barrage</b> <b>of</b> fire {{for more than two}} hours. Captain François A. Dénian on Réunion responded, but aside from inflicting minor damage to Saumarez's rigging achieved little while his own vessel was heavily battered, suffering severe damage to rigging masts and hull and more than 80 and possibly as many as 120 casualties. British losses were confined to a single man wounded by an accident aboard Crescent. Eventually Dénian could not hold out any longer and was forced to surrender on the arrival of the 28-gun British frigate HMS Circe. Réunion was later repaired and commissioned into the Royal Navy, while Saumarez was knighted for his success.|$|E
5|$|The 3rd Baltic Front {{commenced}} their {{offensive in}} the early morning of 17 September. After the German II Army Corps were subjected to an artillery <b>barrage</b> <b>of</b> 132,500 shells, the three leading rifle corps crossed the Emajõgi River in the 25km long section of the front east of Tartu and breached the defence. The 2nd Shock Army forced its way through to the German divisional headquarters and artillery positions. Only Kampfgruppe Rebane, stationed near Tartu, held their frontage, albeit with heavy losses. Army Detachment Narwa and XXVIII Corps, the northernmost elements of Army Group North, were at risk of getting encircled and destroyed. General Ferdinand Schörner ordered II Army Corps to abandon the defence of the Emajõgi and to move quickly around the northern tip of Lake Võrtsjärv to Latvia.|$|E
5000|$|British fighters {{attempted}} to destroy V-1 [...] "buzz bombs" [...] in flight prior to impact, with some success, although concentrated <b>barrages</b> <b>of</b> heavy anti-aircraft artillery had greater success.

50|$|<b>Barrages</b> <b>of</b> rockets {{were fired}} at Beersheba and Ashkelon. Half {{of them were}} intercepted by the Iron Dome. Mortar shells fired at {{farmland}} in the Eshkol Regional Council contained phosphorus, {{which is designed to}} create a more intense fire after detonation. 40 rockets were fired on Sunday. Several structures were damaged and a car caught fire after two rockets were fired at Ashkelon. A three-month-old infant was injured by glass splinters.|$|R
5|$|The Maratha cannonade {{intensified}} as the British redeployed. Although British artillery {{was brought}} forward to counter, it was ineffective against the mass firepower of the Maratha guns and quickly disabled through {{the weight of}} shot directed against it. British casualties mounted as the Maratha guns {{turned their attention to}} the infantry and subjected them to a <b>barrage</b> <b>of</b> canister, grape and round shot. Wellesley decided that his only option to neutralise the artillery and get his men out of the killing field was to advance directly into the mouth of the Maratha artillery. He ordered his cannon to be abandoned and gave the command for his infantry to march forward with bayonets fixed.|$|E
5|$|The V-2 rocket was one {{of several}} {{innovative}} long-range weapons developed by the Germans after the failure of the Luftwaffe to strike a decisive blow against Britain. It was a revolutionary weapon – the world's first operational SRBM – that had been developed in a secret programme begun in 1936. The German leadership hoped that a <b>barrage</b> <b>of</b> rockets unleashed against London would force Britain out of the war. Although Adolf Hitler was at first ambivalent, he eventually became an enthusiastic supporter of the V-2 programme as Allied air forces carried out increasingly devastating attacks on German cities.|$|E
5|$|The {{record was}} {{released}} in July 2009 and peaked at No.137 on the Billboard 200. Critics praised the title for its <b>barrage</b> <b>of</b> heavy rock and spiritually minded lyrics.
