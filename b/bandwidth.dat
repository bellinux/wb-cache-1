5|$|USB2.0 devices use {{a special}} {{protocol}} during reset, called chirping, {{to negotiate the}} high <b>bandwidth</b> mode with the host/hub. A device that is USB2.0 High Speed capable first connects as a Full Speed device (D+ pulled high), but upon receiving a USB RESET (both D+ and D− driven LOW by host for 10 to 20ms) it pulls the D− line high, known as chirp K. This indicates to the host that the device is high <b>bandwidth.</b> If the host/hub is also HS capable, it chirps (returns alternating J and K states on D− and D+ lines) letting the device know that the hub operates at high <b>bandwidth.</b> The device has to receive at least three sets of KJ chirps before it changes to high <b>bandwidth</b> terminations and begins high <b>bandwidth</b> signaling. Because USB 3.0 uses wiring separate and additional to that used by USB2.0 and USB1.x, such <b>bandwidth</b> negotiation is not required.|$|E

Version 3.0 increased the <b>bandwidth</b> to 6 Gbit/s to support 4K Ultra HD (3840 × 2160) 30Hz video, and also changed from being frame-based, like HDMI, to packet-based.|$|E
5|$|A {{symmetric}} multiprocessor (SMP) is {{a computer}} system with multiple identical processors that share memory and connect via a bus. Bus contention prevents bus architectures from scaling. As a result, SMPs generally do not comprise more than 32processors. Because of {{the small size of}} the processors and the significant reduction in the requirements for bus <b>bandwidth</b> achieved by large caches, such symmetric multiprocessors are extremely cost-effective, provided that a sufficient amount of memory <b>bandwidth</b> exists.|$|E

30|$|The most usual working {{modes of}} LTE {{are based on}} the 5 and 10 MHz {{operating}} <b>bandwidths.</b> These configurations can be identified as typical modes because they are specified for most of the LTE bands, as it is shown in Table 5.6. 1 - 1 of [6]. The signal <b>bandwidths</b> associated to these modes are 25 RB (i.e. 4.5 MHz) and 50 RB (i.e. 9 MHz), respectively. Thus, the ETU model is applied with these typical <b>bandwidths</b> in order to represent usual LTE positioning conditions.|$|R

5|$|The {{doubling}} of lane rate and increasing of data lanes from 3 to 4, raises the effective <b>bandwidth</b> to 48 Gbit/s (i.e. 18 Gbit/s * 2 * 4/3). On using DSC, it {{has got a}} maximum compression of 3:1 and this effectively increases the <b>bandwidth</b> to 144 Gbit/s (i.e. 18 Gbit/s * 2 * 4/3 * 3). This much <b>bandwidth</b> {{can be used for}} sending up to 10K/60 Hz video in 4:4:4 format with 24-bit color (i.e. 4K/60Hz * 4 * 16/9). Using a different chroma sub-sampling format (4:2:2 or 4:2:0) enables to use even higher refresh rates (e.g. 10K/120 Hz in 4:2:0 format) or higher color depths (e.g. 30/36/48-bit).|$|E

The eDRAM internal logic to its internal memory <b>bandwidth</b> is 256GB/s. The high <b>bandwidth</b> is used primarily for z-buffering, alpha blending, and antialiasing; it saves time and space on the GPU die.

25|$|Note that BITS {{does not}} {{necessarily}} measure the actual <b>bandwidth.</b> BITS versions 3.0 and up will use Internet Gateway Device counters, if available, to more accurately calculate available <b>bandwidth.</b> Otherwise, BITS will use the speed {{as reported by the}} NIC to calculate <b>bandwidth.</b> This can lead to <b>bandwidth</b> calculation errors, for example when a fast network adapter (10 Mbit/s) is connected to the network via a slow link (56 kbit/s).|$|E
25|$|For work at high {{frequencies}} and with fast digital signals, the <b>bandwidth</b> of the vertical amplifiers and sampling rate must be high enough.

40|$|Abstract—A {{new method}} for {{broadening}} the impedance and the axialratio (AR) <b>bandwidths</b> of circular polarized microstrip antennas (CPMAs) is proposed. It has improved the <b>bandwidths</b> of a reference antenna greatly without enlarging the antenna size or deteriorating circular polarized radiation characteristics by placing four sequentially rotated parasitic split-ring resonators (SRRs) around {{the patch of}} the reference antenna and embedding four defeated ground structure (DGS) elements on the ground plane. Improvements of 51. 3 % and 49. 8 % in the impedance and the axial-ratio <b>bandwidths</b> of the antenna are achieved in simulation, respectively. The simulated − 10 dB impedance and 3 dB axial-ratio <b>bandwidths</b> of the antenna have been improved from 101. 1 MHz (4. 12 %) to 153. 0 MHz (6. 26 %) and from 25. 1 MHz (1. 02 %) to 37. 6 MHz (1. 54 %). 1...|$|R
