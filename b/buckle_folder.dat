50|$|Adjusting {{the paper}} stop in a <b>buckle</b> <b>folder</b> determines where the fold will be placed. Also, a <b>buckle</b> <b>folder</b> may contain only 3 rollers, with one shared {{by both the}} input rollers and the nip rollers.|$|E
50|$|The fold type in a <b>buckle</b> <b>folder</b> is set by {{adjusting}} folding plates. Most paper folders {{allow for a}} wide range of fold types. Right angle folds require the paper to rotate 90 degrees also known as an 8-page or a right angle. More folds can be accomplished by the use of a 16-page and 32-page unit.|$|E
5000|$|In a <b>buckle</b> <b>folder,</b> {{the paper}} is first passed through 2 {{spinning}} rollers, which feed the paper {{into a pair of}} guide plates that redirect the paper at a slight angle, bending the paper. At {{the far end of the}} guide plates is a [...] "paper stop". As the rollers continue to spin, the paper continues to slide in between the guides until it hits the paper stop, then, having nowhere else to go, buckles at the interface between the rollers and the angled guides. As the rollers continue to spin, the buckle increases, until it is eventually caught by a pair of [...] "nip" [...] rollers, which pull the buckle in and compresses and flattens it into a neat crease.|$|E
50|$|Two main {{types of}} {{mechanisms}} are commonly employed in folding machines: <b>buckle</b> <b>folders</b> and knife folders.|$|R
50|$|Although <b>buckle</b> <b>folders</b> are fast, simple, efficient, {{and have}} small folding tolerances, {{they are not}} {{suitable}} for substrate of very low (<40g/m²) or very heavy paper grammage (>120g/m²).|$|R
50|$|Although {{the knife}} folder is slower than <b>buckle</b> <b>folders,</b> {{it is more}} precise and can handle extreme grammages very well. It also has small folding tolerances, but is a more complex machine.|$|R
50|$|Folder inserters are {{designed}} for mailing bills, checks and other material. Folder inserters take paper, fold it, insert it into an envelope and seal the envelope. Folder inserters are available in several designs, many equipped with multiple feed trays for several sheets of paper. Many {{have the ability to}} include inserts and return envelopes. These are mixtures of knife and <b>buckle</b> <b>folders.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Buckle</b> <b>folders</b> work {{by feeding}} the paper {{at high speeds}} until it can move no further; the {{reaction}} of the paper is to buckle. High friction rollers then grip the paper and push it through, folding the paper, which is squeezed between the rollers, in the process. Attached rubber provides the rollers with the required grip. The front edge of the paper is then finally placed into a [...] "pocket"—a result of the rollers pressing together {{with the aid of a}} spring.|$|R
5000|$|A {{folding machine}} is a machine used {{primarily}} for the folding of paper. Paper can be folded with either a buckle or a knife; thus, there are generally three types of folding machines: <b>buckle</b> <b>folders,</b> knife folders {{or a combination of}} these two types. Whilst buckle folding is the more popular of the two methods, knife folding is sometimes preferable. Folding machine models vary in sophistication, with [...] machines capable of processing more complex folding jobs and unusual paper forms (in terms of density and size). Organizations required to undertake mass mail-out campaigns often employ folding machines to improve efficiency.|$|R
