Siberian and Central Asian subspecies have grey and white plumage, the North African race is dark grey-brown, and South and East Asian birds have barred, not striped, underparts, and fine lines around the facial disc. The Siberian and Scandinavian subspecies are 12% larger and 40% heavier, and have 13% longer wings than western European birds, in accordance with Bergmann's rule which predicts that northern forms will typically <b>be</b> <b>bigger</b> than their southern counterparts.|$|E

40|$|In this dissertation, {{we study}} the partial and generic {{uniqueness}} of block term tensor decompositions in signal processing. We present several conditions for generic uniqueness of tensor decompositions of multilinear rank (1, L 1, L 1), [...] ., (1, LR, LR) terms. Our proof {{is based on}} algebraic geometric methods. Mathematical preliminaries for this dissertation are multilinear algebra, and classical algebraic geometry. In geometric language, we prove that the joins of relevant subspace varieties are not tangentially weakly defective. We also give conditions for partial uniqueness of block term tensor decompositions by proving that the joins of relevant subspace varieties are not defective. The main result is the following. For a tensor Y belong to the tensor product of three complex vector spaces of dimensions I, J, K, we assume that L 1, L 2, [...] ., LR is from small to large, K <b>is</b> <b>bigger</b> or equal to J, and J <b>is</b> strictly <b>bigger</b> than LR. If the dimension of ambient space is strictly less than IJK, then for general tensors among those admitting block term tensor decomposition, the block term tensor decomposition is partially unique {{under the condition that}} the binomial coefficient indexed by J and LR <b>is</b> <b>bigger</b> or equal to R, and I <b>is</b> <b>bigger</b> or equal to 2; it has infinitely many expressions under the condition IJK is strictly less than the sum from L_ 1 ^ 2 to L_R^ 2; it is essentially unique under any of the following there conditions: (i) I <b>is</b> <b>bigger</b> or equal to 2, J, K <b>is</b> <b>bigger</b> or equal to the sum from L 1 to LR (ii) R is 2, I <b>is</b> <b>bigger</b> or equal to 2 (iii) I <b>is</b> <b>bigger</b> or equal to R, K <b>is</b> <b>bigger</b> or equal to the sum from L 1 to LR, J <b>is</b> <b>bigger</b> or equal to 2 LR, the binomial coefficient indexed by J and LR <b>is</b> <b>bigger</b> or equal to R...|$|R
25|$|The {{discriminant}} of K can {{be referred}} to as the absolute discriminant of K to distinguish it from the relative discriminant of an extension K/L of number fields. The latter is an ideal in the ring of integers of L, and like the absolute discriminant it indicates which primes are ramified in K/L. It is a generalization of the absolute discriminant allowing for L to <b>be</b> <b>bigger</b> than Q; in fact, when L=Q, the relative discriminant of K/Q is the principal ideal of Z generated by the absolute discriminant of K.|$|E
25|$|Rank {{and status}} are fixed from birth. There {{is no way}} in Tongan society to climb up in rank. A low ranking chief will always remain the lesser of a high ranking chief, even though his lands may <b>be</b> <b>bigger</b> and richer and so forth. But he can try to marry a high ranking woman, for {{instance}} if she is interested in his rich lands, and so increase the rank of his children. Status on the other hand, although usually fixed too, can have some vertical movement. The second son of a noble, normally not in line for his father's title, may get it after all if his older brother dies prematurely. In addition to this sometimes, but very rarely, the king may elevate some person to high status.|$|E

25|$|This {{view point}} is {{rejected}} {{or at least}} controversially discussed by {{those who want to}} preserve the “pure” dingo. Here for instance the molecular biologist Alan Wilton from the University of New South Wales argues that a maximizing of the “genetic purity” is an essential aspect of the dingo conservation. Dingo-hybrids would supposedly increase the predation on native species, because they would have more litters per year and therefore would have to raise more pups and some of them would <b>be</b> <b>bigger</b> than the average dingo. He also argued that it is, for instance, not sufficient to regard a wild dog with a little non-dingo-content as a “pure” dingo if it more or less acts the same way. Wilton was of the opinion that the scale had to be set higher when “pure” dingoes are available. Corbett and Daniels agreed that it is practical and desirable to minimize the effect of other domestic dog genes. By this it would first be possible to find areas were the process is slower {{and to be able to}} limit it later; and second the populations would be able to develop accordingly to their natural environment. Furthermore, hybrids and other feral domestic dogs would probably not have the same tourist effect, because they don’t correspond with the current expectations on wild dingoes.|$|E
