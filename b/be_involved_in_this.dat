5|$|The Mysore {{painting}} {{style is}} {{an offshoot of}} the Vijayanagar school of painting, and King Raja Wodeyar (1578–1617 CE) is credited with having been its patron. The distinctive feature of these paintings is the gesso work, to which gold foil is applied. Mysore is known for rosewood inlay work; around 4,000 craftsmen were estimated to <b>be</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> art in 2002. The city lends its name to the Mysore silk saree, a women's garment made with pure silk and gold zari (thread). Mysore Peta, the traditional indigenous turban worn by the erstwhile rulers of Mysore, is worn by men in some traditional ceremonies. A notable local dessert that traces its history to the kitchen in the Mysore palace is Mysore pak.|$|E
5|$|The {{obligation}} {{of a professional}} medical care provider to alleviate suffering may occasionally come into conflict with the obligation to prolong life. If a terminally ill person prefers to be painless, despite {{a high level of}} sedation and a risk of shortening their life, they should be provided with their desired pain relief (despite the cost of sedation and a possibly slightly shorter life). Where a person is unable to <b>be</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> type of decision, the law and the medical profession in the United Kingdom allow the doctor to assume that the person would prefer to be painless, and thus the provider may prescribe and administer adequate analgesia, even if the treatment may slightly hasten death. It is taken that the underlying cause of death in this case is the illness and not the necessary pain management.|$|E

25|$|Recent {{findings}} suggest that PLSCR3 is involved in regulation of biosynthesis of cardiolipin in mitochondria, and its overexpression in cultured cells resulted in increased cardiolipin synthase, activity. As cardiolipin is synthesized in the luminal side of inner mitochondrial membrane, a major fraction of this newly synthesized pool of cardiolipin has to be translocated from the inner to the outer mitochondrial membrane. PLSCR3 has been proposed to <b>be</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> translocation from the inner to the outer membrane that is essential for maintaining the mitochondrial architecture, mass, and transmembrane potential.|$|E
25|$|The {{idiopathic}} scoliosis {{accounts for}} 80–90% of scoliosis cases. Its pathogenesis is unknown. However, {{changes in the}} vestibular system, a lateral shift of the hand representation and abnormal variability of erector spinae motor map location in the motor cortex may <b>be</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> disease. Besides, idiopathic scoliosis being more frequent in certain families, it is suspected to be transmitted via autosomal dominant inheritance. Estrogens could also play a crucial part in the progression of idiopathic scoliosis through their roles in bone formation, growth, maturation and turnover. Finally, collagen, intervertebral disc and muscle abnormalities have been suggested as the cause in idiopathic scoliosis, although these are perhaps results rather than causes.|$|E

25|$|Apoptosis. During {{programmed}} {{cell death}} the ICE/ced-3 family of proteases (one of the interleukin-1β-converter proteases) degrade actin into two fragments “in vivo”; one of the fragments is 15 kDa and the other 31 kDa. This {{represents one of the}} mechanisms involved in destroying cell viability that form the basis of apoptosis. The protease calpain has also been shown to <b>be</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> type of cell destruction; just as the use of calpain inhibitors has been shown to decrease actin proteolysis and the degradation of DNA (another of the characteristic elements of apoptosis). On the other hand, the stress-induced triggering of apoptosis causes the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton (which also involves its polymerization), giving rise to structures called stress fibers; this is activated by the MAP kinase pathway.|$|E
500|$|After The Game {{signed with}} the G-Unit, he {{recorded}} nine songs with fellow American rapper 50 Cent in his home studio in Farmington, Connecticut, {{and then went back}} to Los Angeles, California to complete the album with American record producer Dr. Dre. While continuing the recording sessions on the album, he began working with rapper and record producer Kanye West on a song, where Kanye did the chorus. However, the song was left on the cutting room floor. The Game also was working on the album for his inspiration goals about reviving {{what it felt like to}} <b>be</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> whole hip hop scene in the West Coast, which was overshadowed over these past few years by these artists between the East to the South. In 2005, in the interview with Vibe magazine, 50 Cent stated that he was brought in by the Interscope Records to work on the album, claiming that was on the verge of being shelved and The Game was being dropped from the label. However, in the interview with Funkmaster Flex, The Game said that his status was never uncertain that he would be dropped from the label. 50 Cent also claimed that he wrote six songs of The Documentarys eighteen tracks—"Hate It or Love It", [...] "How We Do", [...] "Church for Thugs", [...] "Special", [...] "Higher", and [...] "Westside Story"—and didn't receiving any proper credit for his work. The Game denied those claims, saying that 50 Cent only wrote two songs on the album.|$|E
2500|$|In 1976, SEM images {{showed that}} there were homing receptors on microvilli-like tips on leukocytes that would allow white blood cells {{to get out of}} the blood vessel and get into tissue. Since the 1990s the {{identity}} of ligands involved in leukocyte extravasation have been studied heavily. This topic was finally able to be studied thoroughly under physiological shear stress conditions using a typical flow chamber. [...] Since the first experiments, a strange phenomenon was observed. Binding interactions between the white blood cells and the vessel walls were observed to become stronger under higher force. Selectins (E-selection, L-selection, and P-selectin) were found to <b>be</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> phenomenon.|$|E
