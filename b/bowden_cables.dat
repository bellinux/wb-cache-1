40|$|PurposeA {{straight}} thoracic {{stent graft}} often complies poorly with the {{curvature of the}} aortic arch. We have previously reported an in vitro model of a modified stent graft that can be bent in situ after deployment to improve conformance to the aortic arch. We now report the first clinical experience with this technique in three consecutive patients. MethodsBetween September 2007 and August 2008, three patients were treated for different pathologies of the aortic arch with a modified thoracic stent graft that was fitted with a sliding self-locking knot and a detachable <b>Bowden</b> <b>cable.</b> Transfemoral traction on the <b>Bowden</b> <b>cable</b> enables controlled shortening of the proximal part of the stent graft at the inner curve after deployment. The stent graft is thereby directed to allow for better apposition to the aortic wall. ResultsThe modified thoracic stent grafts were correctly orientated and deployed in all patients. Transfemoral traction on the <b>Bowden</b> <b>cable</b> successfully bent all stent grafts and improved vessel wall apposition without a residual gap on the inner curve. The <b>Bowden</b> <b>cable</b> was successfully released and withdrawn in all patients. ConclusionIn situ bending of thoracic stent grafts with a sliding self-locking knot is feasible and improves proximal apposition of the device at the inner curve of the aortic arch. More data and longer follow-up are required to confirm the applicability of this technique...|$|R

5000|$|He {{lived at}} 35 Bedford Place, London, W.C. [...] His first patent (English Patent 25,325 and U.S. Pat. No. 609,570) was granted in 1896. [...] The {{principal}} {{element of the}} <b>Bowden</b> <b>cable</b> is a flexible tube containing a length of fine wire rope that could slide within the tube, directly transmitting pulling, pushing or turning movements on the wire rope {{from one end to}} the other without the need of pulleys or flexible joints. The cable was particularly intended for use in conjunction with bicycle brakes. The Bowden Brake was launched amidst a flurry of enthusiasm in the cycle press. Sir Frank Bowden, the founder and owner of the Raleigh Bicycle Company, was reputed to have started replacing the rigid rods used for bicycle brakes with a flexible wound cable around 1902. This may be the reason the invention of the <b>Bowden</b> <b>cable</b> has been popularly attributed to him. In any case, the origin and invention of the <b>Bowden</b> <b>cable</b> is open to some dispute, confusion and popular myth.|$|R

50|$|An {{electronic}} gear-shifting {{system is}} a method of changing gears on a bicycle, which enables riders to shift with electronic switches instead of using conventional control levers and mechanical cables. The switches are connected by wire or wirelessly to a battery pack and to a small electric motor that drives the derailleur, switching the chain from cog to cog. An electronic system can switch gears faster, and because the system does not use <b>Bowden</b> <b>cables</b> and can calibrate itself, it may require less maintenance.|$|E
50|$|A {{flexible}} bronchoscope {{is longer}} and thinner than a rigid bronchoscope. It contains a fiberoptic system that transmits an {{image from the}} tip of the instrument to an eyepiece or video camera at the opposite end. Using <b>Bowden</b> <b>cables</b> connected to a lever at the hand piece, the tip of the instrument can be oriented, allowing the practitioner to navigate the instrument into individual lobe or segment bronchi. Most flexible bronchoscopes also include a channel for suctioning or instrumentation, but these are significantly smaller than those in a rigid bronchoscope.|$|E

Increasingly, the side mirror incorporates the vehicle's turn signal repeaters. There is evidence to suggest mirror-mounted repeaters may be more effective than repeaters mounted in the previously predominant fender side location.|$|E

50|$|The {{braking system}} was also typical; the front brakes were disc brakes, using a solid iron disc and a single-piston sliding caliper. The rears were drum brakes (a {{technological}} backwards step from the 124, which used discs all round), utilising leading and trailing shoe design {{operated by a}} dual piston fixed slave cylinder. They were operated hydraulically, with a tandem master cylinder assisted by a vacuum servo using two separate circuits. A rear-mounted load sensing valve varied the bias of effort applied to the rear brakes, dependent on the load being carried (and also the pitch dynamics caused by braking effort and road levels). A centrally located floor mounted handbrake operated on the rear axle using <b>bowden</b> <b>cables.</b>|$|E
