5|$|Mining {{disasters}} in Leigh included {{the explosion of}} firedamp which caused the deaths of 38miners at Bedford Colliery on 13 August 1886. There were several accidents at Bickershaw Colliery, but the most serious was in 1932, when 19men were drowned in the sump at the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shaft</b> after an overwind of the cage.|$|E
5|$|Calhoun regains {{consciousness}} at the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shaft</b> {{and begins}} to fight {{his way to the}} surface to escape. Emerging near Black Mesa's classification yards, Calhoun learns that Dr. Rosenberg and his colleagues plan to escape the facility using teleportation technology. After freeing Rosenberg from the captivity of the US Marines detachment sent to silence the facility, Calhoun escorts him to a decommissioned prototype teleportation laboratory, where several Black Mesa employees have already gathered. Rosenberg then teleports Calhoun to the Xen border world to calibrate research equipment needed to pinpoint a teleport destination outside of Black Mesa. Upon his return, Rosenberg informs Calhoun that the teleporter's battery power has been exhausted, and contact has been lost with a team sent to acquire a new power cell.|$|E
5|$|Cully and his thugs arrive as the McCoys try to leave. A violent gunfight ensues in the halls, stairwell, and {{elevator}}; all Cully's men {{are killed}} but one, who Doc allows to run away. Cully himself dies when Doc shoots the cables {{of the elevator}} he is in and it crashes to the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shaft.</b> Rudy comes to his senses, follows Doc and Carol outside onto a fire escape, and shoots at them. Doc returns fire and kills him. With the police on the way, the couple hijack a pickup truck and force the driver, a cooperative old cowboy, {{to take them to}} Mexico. After crossing the border, Doc and Carol pay the cowboy $30,000 for his truck. Overjoyed, the cowboy heads back to El Paso on foot, while the couple continue into Mexico.|$|E
50|$|Byzantine pottery {{found at}} <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shafts</b> in <b>the</b> yard and two crosses {{engraved}} on <b>the</b> wall <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main room, show that use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cave continued until the Byzantine period.|$|R
50|$|Around 200 shafts were {{dug into}} the Cissbury hill over around 900 years of use. Shafts were up to 12 m deep with 7 m diameters at the surface. Up to eight {{galleries}} extended outwards from <b>the</b> <b>bottoms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shafts,</b> often interconnecting with one another.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> site <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fort {{contains}} a Neolithic mine, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first flint mines in Britain. Around 200 shafts were dug into Cissbury hill over around 900 years of use. Shafts {{were up to}} 12 m deep with 7 m diameters at the surface. Up to eight galleries extended outwards from <b>the</b> <b>bottoms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shafts,</b> often interconnecting with one another. There is concern that the site is being irreversibly damaged [...] "by illicit use of metal detectors", police say.|$|R
5|$|With the {{inclined}} plane, {{the problems}} {{stemmed from a}} mis-calculation. Power was provided by a large tank, filled with water, which descended in a shaft, raising one boat on a trolley and allowing another to descend as it did so. When the tank reached the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shaft,</b> the water discharged, and the second tank was used to reverse the process. Green had been the engineer on the Bude Canal, where this design had been used successfully, but {{the size of the}} tanks at Wellisford were much too small. On the Bude Canal, a tank holding 15tons of water was required to raise a boat weighing six tons. The Grand Western Canal used boats holding eight tons, but the tanks only held ten tons of water, whereas tests indicated that about 25tons was needed. It was for this reason that the steam engine was obtained to supply the power.|$|E
25|$|The {{action of}} Asip can be {{observed}} in horses which have their winter coats clipped. When shaved close, the black tip is shorn off leaving the phaeomelanic <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shaft.</b> This produces a dull, orange-gold appearance on the body coat which is lost with the spring shed. This is not usually seen in dark bays, which have little red in the hair shaft.|$|E
25|$|In the 1860s, when trains {{started running}} through the tunnel, the shaft was used for ventilation. The {{staircase}} was removed {{to reduce the risk}} of fire. In 2011, a concrete raft was built near the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shaft,</b> above the tracks, when the tunnel was upgraded for the London Overground network. This space, with walls blackened with smoke from steam trains, is accessible from Railway Avenue, and functions at times as a concert venue and occasional bar. A rooftop garden has been built on top of the shaft. In 2016 the entrance hall opened as an exhibition space, with a staircase providing easy access to the shaft for the first time in over 150 years.|$|E
40|$|Multiaxial fatigue {{failures}} of welded coupling flanges of stirrers in a fertilizer plant required an investigation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{reasons for the}} failures and <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> an improved design. Strain measurements carried out at <b>the</b> <b>shaft</b> showed that <b>the</b> stirrers experienced fluctuating torsional loads due to upward and downward driving from the gearbox and bending loads due to the viscous fluid stirred by impellers at <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shafts.</b> <b>The</b> analysis <b>of</b> this variable-amplitude loading resulted in two particular cumulative frequency distributions for torsion and bending which then had to be combined to a single equivalent loading spectrum and extrapolated to <b>the</b> estimated period <b>of</b> usage. When using this spectrum for the combined multiaxial loading <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shafts</b> and an appropriate damage accumulation hypothesis, <b>the</b> failures <b>of</b> <b>the</b> welds could be explained and redesign and optimization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shaft-flange connections achieved...|$|R
50|$|The {{explosion}} caused {{significant damage}} to mine’s roadways and to <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main <b>shaft.</b> Several fires ignited the coal seams and supporting timber structures filling the mine with smoke.|$|R
50|$|Whorls can {{be located}} near the top, middle or <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spindle <b>shaft.</b> Whorl {{location}} {{can have an impact}} on <b>the</b> stability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spindle, with <b>bottom</b> whorl spindles being considered more stable.|$|R
25|$|The way windcatchers work is {{that the}} moving air masses (wind, breeze, etc.) {{at the top of}} windcatchers create a {{pressure}} gradient between the top of the windcatcher and its base, inside, at the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shaft.</b> This pressure gradient sucks out rising hot air from inside the shaft while the colder dense air remains. The superb heat-resistant material of the walls of the ab anbar further create an insulating effect that tends to lower the temperature inside an ab anbar, similar to a cave. The ventilating effect of the windcatchers prevent any stagnant air and hence any dew or humidity from forming inside, and the overall effect is pure, clean, cold water all year round.|$|E
25|$|How {{the brush}} is held {{depends on the}} {{calligrapher}} and which calligraphic genre is practiced. Commonly, the brush is held vertically straight gripped between the thumb and middle finger. The index finger lightly touches {{the upper part of}} the shaft of the brush (stabilizing it) while the ring and little fingers tuck under the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shaft,</b> leaving a space inside the palm. Alternatively, the brush is held in the right hand between the thumb and the index finger, very much like a Western pen. A calligrapher may change his or her grip depending on the style and script. For example, a calligrapher may grip higher for cursive and lower for regular script.|$|E
25|$|A pump drill is {{a simple}} tool used to make holes in light {{materials}} by hand {{and has been in}} use for centuries. The drill itself is composed of: the drill shaft, a narrow board with a hole through the center, a weight (usually a heavy disc) acting as a flywheel, and a length of cord. The weight is attached near the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shaft</b> and the hole board is slipped over the top. The cordage is run through a hole {{near the top of the}} shaft and affixed to either end of the hole board so that it hangs just above the weight. The end of the shaft usually has a square hole made to fit certain sized auger bits or a simple triangular bit made to cut while rotating in both directions.|$|E
50|$|A {{descending}} cage {{carrying the}} men failed {{to slow down}} as it approached <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mine <b>shaft</b> and 18 miners {{were killed by the}} impact. The accident was caused by fracture <b>of</b> <b>the</b> brake-rod, when a slowly growing fatigue crack reached a critical size and the brake-rod parted.|$|R
25|$|The molten corium {{settled in}} <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reactor <b>shaft,</b> forming {{a layer of}} {{graphite}} debris on its top. Eight days after the meltdown the melt penetrated the lower biological shield and spread on the reactor room floor, releasing radionuclides. Further radioactivity was released when the melt {{came in contact with}} water.|$|R
5000|$|Basket: Near <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shaft,</b> {{designed}} {{to stop the}} pole from sinking significantly into deep snow. These can range from being small, aerodynamic cones used in racing, to large snowflake shaped baskets which are used in powder skiing. Many poles feature methods of easily switching between baskets, such as threading on the basket and pole.|$|R
500|$|The {{entrance}} immediately {{leads to}} a [...] long steep stairway and then down on to a corridor which heads west. The corridor ends in a straight vertical shaft, {{at the top of}} which is the so-called upper corridor, an unfinished passage which goes south {{toward the center of the}} pyramid. At the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shaft</b> is a T-shaped crossway. To the left, this crossway leads south to the lower corridor, half-way of which is a narrow stairway, so narrow that a sarcophagus could hardly have been passed through it. The lower corridor then finishes in the king's burial chamber. In this area of the stairway, Barsanti drew another gallery leading above the burial chamber, but this gallery is absent in Reisner's and Fisher's notes. To the right of the T-shaped crossway is a U-shaped gallery system. The ground plan of the gallery system resembles that of a comb, comprising rows of chambers, totalling 32, which were possibly destined to be storage rooms for the gravegoods. The gallery proved to be [...] "clean and empty, as if the workmen had only left".|$|E
500|$|The preacetabular (i.e. {{located in}} front of the hip socket) process of the ilium bears a {{horizontal}} [...] "boot" [...] which forms an obtuse angle with the bottom of the process. Additionally, the top edge of the bone projects outwards to form a rim located above the ilium-ischium articuation on the bottom edge of the bone. These traits are also seen in Probactrosaurus and other iguanodonts. The hip socket itself is quite large relative to the ilium for an iguanodont. A distinctive flange is present along the top surface of the ilium, a trait which is shared with an unnamed hadrosauroid from the Woodbine Formation. The postacetabular (i.e. located behind the hip socket) process of the ilium tapers at its rear with no break in its top margin. On the pubis, the forward-projecting process expands towards the front, like Probactrosaurus, Gongpoquansaurus, and other iguanodonts. The shaft of the ischium is characteristically straight in adults (juveniles have a curved shaft, which is more common among iguanodonts), and the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shaft</b> bears a compressed [...] "boot" [...] that is expanded forwards.|$|E
500|$|Dibnah {{had another}} course of chemotherapy, {{but this time}} the {{treatment}} was unsuccessful. [...] Undeterred, he began to dig a replica coal mine in the back garden of his home. [...] Although the sight of pithead gear may have been considered by his neighbours to be unusual, as a child raised in Bolton he had been surrounded by pits such as Ladyshore Colliery and had long harboured an interest in mining. [...] He had already assembled the wooden pithead gear and was planning to sink a [...] brick-lined shaft below this into the hillside. [...] At the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shaft,</b> a horizontal tunnel would have led out to the steep side of the valley above which his garden sits. [...] The intention was to have a narrow gauge railway running along the tunnel, back up the hillside on a rope-hauled inclined plane, returning to the pithead. [...] The ultimate aim was to be able to demonstrate the basic working of an early colliery. [...] Seven years before his diagnosis, therefore, Dibnah had sourced drawings of suitable pithead gear and built a frame from timber and iron bolts. [...] He had applied for and was given planning permission to erect the structure, but made no mention of his wish to dig a shaft underneath it. [...] The BBC decided to make a documentary on Dibnah's proposed mine, which would entail his once again travelling around the country, visiting working collieries and heritage mines. [...] Filming started late in 2003, by which time Dibnah and his friend Alf Molyneux had already made a start on the shaft.|$|E
50|$|Whittle's {{body was}} found on 7 March 1975, hanging from a wire at <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{drainage}} <b>shaft</b> where he had tethered her in Bathpool Park, at Kidsgrove, Staffordshire. The subsequent post-mortem examination showed that Whittle had not, in fact, died slowly from strangulation, but instantaneously from vagal inhibition. <b>The</b> shock <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fall had caused her heart to stop beating.|$|R
5000|$|Bruno Goergen - Murdered by Basil, {{pushing him}} on <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{elevator}} <b>shaft</b> {{because he was}} threatening to put word in Oz that Basil was an undercover cop, and also so Basil gets in good with Enrique Morales, Chucky Pancamo & Simon Adebisi if he killed someone in Oz so he continues to bust the drug trade in Oz.|$|R
50|$|Bursledon mill is a five storey tower mill with a {{stage at}} first floor level. The boat shaped cap is winded by a chain and wheel.

500|$|Station {{reconstruction}} {{to accommodate}} the Victoria line was described as the most time-consuming for the Victoria line project. To handle the additional Victoria line passenger loads, a new ticket hall was constructed directly under the road junction. Separate banks of escalators to each line were to be built, with the existing structure {{to be used as}} exits with The lifts to be removed. A new one-way interchange subways system was to be built between the Bakerloo/Victoria lines and the Central line. To excavate the new ticket hall below the roadway, traffic was diverted for {{five and a half years}} (August 1963 to Easter 1968) onto a temporary bridge-like structure known as the [...] "umbrella" [...] covering the Regent Street/Oxford Street intersection. It consisted of 245 pieces of separate prefabricated steel work. The deck plates were placed on top of a system of steel girders which in turn rested on 25 cylindrical 3ft diameter concrete foundations, sunk from 43 up to 73ft deep at night. The cylindrical piles had to clear the sites of the main and secondary roof beams of the new ticket hall and various low-level obstructions. The piles had to be built with wide footings to avoid them from collapsing. Service tunnels were constructed to carry water mains and telecom cables past the new ticket hall. The umbrella deck was extended eastwards along Oxford Street to facilitate the construction of a connecting passageway between the old and new ticket halls during the weekend of the August Bank Holiday in 1966. Construction of the Victoria line station tunnels with their platforms, the new escalator shafts and the linking passages to the Central line platforms was carried out from access shafts sunk from nearby Cavendish Square, Upper Regent Street and Argyll Street. For the construction of the southbound Victoria line platform tunnel, a special design of tunnel segment, fabricated with mild steel was adopted as there was limited space available for the construction of the platform tunnel. A pre-stressed concrete raft was constructed below the Peter Robinson's third basement level as an extra precaution against settlement before driving the platform tunnel. The interchange passageway between the Central line and the Bakerloo line in the area of the former junction with the Bakerloo line lift landing was replaced by the southbound Victoria line platform tunnel. From there, a pilot tunnel Ventilation systems were rearranged with a new ventilation plant installed in the former Bakerloo line lift shaft. A new substation for the Bakerloo line was built at the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shaft.</b> With the additional escalators in place, the one-way circulation scheme was introduced and the remaining lifts were removed.|$|E
2500|$|In 1880 the Low Level Shaft was {{extended}} to the Lucy Tongue Level. The company employed an outside contractor to do this work. Warsop and Hill used their own rock drills and the more powerful blasting gelatine. Impressed by this technology, the company installed an air compressor in 1884 and bought {{a number of the}} rock drills from the contractors. These contractors also drove the crosscut which was needed to connect the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shaft</b> to the Lucy Tongue Level. This crosscut, [...] long, was known as Warsop's Crosscut ...|$|E
2500|$|The Massacre Canyon Monument was {{dedicated}} on Sept. 26, 1930. It {{was the first}} historical monument erected in Nebraska by federal grant. It stands on a three-acre (1.2 ha) plot, three miles (4.8km) east of Trenton off U.S. Route 34, after having been moved from its original location overlooking the Republican River valley. The monument was constructed from Minnesota pink granite from a quarry in St. Cloud by R.P. Colling, Indianola, Nebraska. [...] The shaft of the obelisk is [...] high.

2500|$|An {{advertising}} executive, John Alogna, {{created the}} original version of the Islanders logo with the NY over a silhouette of part of Long Island: Nassau and Suffolk counties. Part of the Y is made to resemble a hockey stick, with three orange stripes near the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shaft</b> and a puck {{to the right of}} the stick blade. At the bottom of the logo, the name of the team is written so that the tip of the [...] "I" [...] ends in a point aimed at Uniondale, Nassau County, the location of the Nassau Coliseum. The Islanders later updated the stripes, adding a fourth to represent the four Stanley Cups won by the franchise. Aside from the 1995 rebrand attempt, this logo has remained largely intact throughout the team's history.|$|E
2500|$|Electronic stethoscopes require {{conversion}} of acoustic sound waves to electrical signals which {{can then be}} amplified and processed for optimal listening. Unlike acoustic stethoscopes, which are all {{based on the same}} physics, transducers in electronic stethoscopes vary widely. The simplest and least effective method of sound detection is achieved by placing a microphone in the chestpiece. This method suffers from ambient noise interference and has fallen out of favor. Another method, used in Welch-Allyn's Meditron stethoscope, comprises placement of a piezoelectric crystal {{at the head of a}} metal shaft, the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shaft</b> making contact with a diaphragm. 3M also uses a piezo-electric crystal placed within foam behind a thick rubber-like diaphragm. The Thinklabs' Rhythm 32 [...] uses an Electromagnetic Diaphragm with a conductive inner surface to form a capacitive sensor. This diaphragm responds to sound waves, with changes in an electric field replacing changes in air pressure.
