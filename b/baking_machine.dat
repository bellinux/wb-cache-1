5000|$|At {{the age of}} 16 Doumar {{began to}} sell {{paperweights}} and other items. One night, he bought a waffle from another vendor transplanted to Norfolk, Virginia from Ghent in Belgium, Leonidas Kestekidès. Doumar proceeded to roll up the waffle and place a scoop of ice cream on top. He then began selling the cones at the St. Louis Exposition. His [...] "cones" [...] were such a success that he designed a four-iron <b>baking</b> <b>machine</b> and had a foundry make it for him. At the Jamestown Exposition in 1907, he and his brothers sold nearly twenty-three thousand cones. After that, Abe bought a semiautomatic 36-iron machine, which produced 20 cones per minute and opened Doumar's Drive In in Norfolk, Virginia, which still operates at the same location over 100 years later.|$|E

One night, he bought a waffle from another vendor Leonidas Kestekidès a fellow Greek Ottoman who came from Ghent in Belgium with the Fritz Waffle machine invented by his cousin Georges Krieger-Zacharidès (Fritz) in 1855 in Brussels and proceeded to roll it up and place a scoop of ice cream on top. He then began selling the cones at the St. Louis Exposition. His cones were such a success that he designed a four-iron <b>baking</b> <b>machine</b> and had a foundry make it for him.

50|$|The {{company was}} {{originally}} {{a manufacturer of}} food machinery and company founders Harry Tatosian, who invented the machines and R. J. Yohai, vice president and sales manager, decided to start making food using their machines after a trip to London, where they had installed automated <b>baking</b> <b>machines</b> for a customer. They first started baking ice cream cones and used the brand name Old London based on their recent experience in that city. Using an investment of $4,000, they created a multimillion-dollar business exclusively using their own capital to expand to include melba toast and snack products.|$|R
25|$|Josef Dunner took {{a leading}} role in {{promoting}} kashrus within his community. In his early years at the Adath and UOHC he chaired the Kashrus Committee (Kedassia), where he took a personal interest in seeing that all the requirements of halacha were met. He supervised personally the <b>baking</b> of <b>machine</b> matzos for the UOHC community, first at Bonn & Co in England and later at Ludmir's matzo bakery in Jerusalem, where he lost a finger in the process of meticulously checking the machinery.|$|R
40|$|Penile {{injury is}} {{fortunately}} fairly uncommon as it represents only about 1 % to 1. 6 % of all trauma cases. Severe penile trauma may be complicated by urethrocutaneous fistula. A 22 year old male patient presented with urethrocutaneous fistula following severe crush injury of his penis from the rollers of a <b>baking</b> <b>machine.</b> He had penile fasciocutaneous flap urethroplasty with satisfactory outcome. Wearing loose fitting clothing while operating industrial machinery {{could lead to}} entrapment and severe genital injury...|$|E
40|$|Soybeans {{have been}} baselined to be grown in a habitat (Advanced Life Support Systems Integration Test Bed, ALSSITB) {{intended}} for evaluating advanced {{life support systems}} developed for long duration missions to the Moon or Mars. The ALSSITB is being constructed at NASA-Johnson Space Center and is composed of 5 chambers (4. 6 m x 11. 3 m each) and an airlock joined by an interconnecting tunnel (3. 7 m x 19. 2 m). Processed soy products such as soy milk and soy bread are planned to be incorporated into a nutritionally sound, plant-based food system. Since all consumables will be recycled and reused, volatile compounds evolved during the manufacturing of these food products need to be quantified to assess their impact on this closed loop system. Soy milk was made in a prototype machine and bread in a commercial bread <b>baking</b> <b>machine.</b> These machines were each placed in a tightly closed chamber and, {{at the completion of}} the process, air volatiles were identified and quantified by GC/MS. For soy milk, ethanol, acetaldehyde, methanol, hexanal, propanal and acetone and for soybread, acetaldehyde, ethanol, N-propanol and ethyl acetate were detected in significant quantities. The crew members will spend an average of 180 days in the ALSSITB and it was estimated that 138 batches of soy milk will be processed in the tunnel and 130 loaves of soybread would be baked in the habitat chamber during their stay. The aforementioned volatiles would surpass the 180 day Spacecraft Maximum Allowable Concentrations (SMACs) if no means of scrubbing are adapted which would lead to toxic levels of these compounds. Therefore, sufficient means for eliminating the contribution of volatiles evolved from food processing and preparation equipment needs to be provided in the ALSSITB...|$|E
5000|$|The {{company was}} founded in 1900 by Rufus L. Patterson, {{inventor}} of the first automated cigarette manufacturing machine. Originally incorporated in New Jersey but operating in Brooklyn, the company began by manufacturing cigarette, <b>baking,</b> and stitching <b>machines.</b> AMF moved into the bowling business after World War II, when AMF automated bowling equipment and bowling centers became profitable business ventures. Bicycle production was added in 1950. The company was once a major manufacturer of products from tennis racquets to research reactors for the US' [...] "Atoms for Peace" [...] program. AMF became {{a major part of}} what would soon be referred to by US President Dwight D. Eisenhower as [...] "the military-industrial complex" [...] after World War II.|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} salt (sodium chloride) on the wheat dough was studied, with a {{particular}} focus on the state and distribution of water and sodium in the dough system. In this study, dough samples were prepared using the same processing techniques as in commercial bakery (i. e. Chorleywood Bread Process) and were investigated simultaneously using molecular spectroscopy 1 [subscript]H and 23 [subscript]Na NMR), deformation stress measurement (Kieffer test, Texture Profile Analysis and Chen-Hoseney test) and calorimetry (DSC). A progressive study of experimentation {{was carried out in}} which dough samples between zero and 5 % added salt (on flour base) to exaggerate the effects of salt. Furthermore, test baking was also used to study the mechinability of doughs. All of the techniques studied enabled the construction of a complete picture of the sequential events occurring when salt is reduced. Test <b>baking</b> confirmed that <b>machine</b> moulding of bread dough became more difficult at lower salt contents. This was more apparent when dough temperature was elevated, or when the delay time between mixing and moulding was increased. Laboratory measurements were not able to distinguish the increase of stickiness occurring in the low salt (1. 4 %) doughs and modifying the method also failed to establish variations in stickiness, although changes in the hardness of the dough at the different salt levels were detectable. Measurements of the dough fluid phases were compared using three techniques: isolation of aqueous phase through ultracentrifugation, freezable water as measured by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and proton mobility using low field nuclear magnetic resonance (1 [subscript]H NMR). Salt increased the amount of dough liquor expressed on ultracentrifugation, however, the amount of freezable water and the molecular mobility of water (T 2) did not show significant changes. The findings suggest that the gluten-starch matrix is sensitive to salt in way that it affects the "drainage" properties and the capillarity of the dough matrix, but not the intrinsic levels of fluid in the dough. The distribution of salt on the dough was also investigated using 23 [subscript]NaNMR. A large proportion of the salt added was not detectable with this technique and could be thought of as immobile. Increasing the concentration of sodium in the dough gave the same proportion of "bound" sodium. It would seem to be the starch component in the flour that dominated the sodium binding in the dough samples. Salt may exert its effects through polymer-polymer interactions rather than polymer–water interactions and its exact influence on cereal products performance still needs to be established before the reduction of salt is a viable option for commercial bakers.
