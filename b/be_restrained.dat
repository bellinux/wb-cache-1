5|$|While Tszyu {{celebrated in}} his corner, Judah was in disbelief of what just {{happened}} and became infuriated. Judah picked up his stool and hurled it towards center ring. While being restrained by his father and trainer, Yoel Judah, he broke loose and walked up to Nady and stuck his gloved fist into his neck {{and had to be}} pulled off by cornermen. A few minutes later, Jimmy Lennon, Jr. announced the official decision and Judah screamed out and again had to <b>be</b> <b>restrained</b> by a growing number of security guards and cornermen. Judah was fined $75,000 and suspended for six months by the Nevada State Athletic Commission.|$|E
5|$|According to Brackman, {{several days}} after the robbery the Okhrana agent Mukhtarov {{questioned}} Stalin in a secret apartment. The agents had heard rumors that Stalin had been seen watching passively during the robbery. Mukhtarov asked Stalin why he had not informed them about it, and Stalin stated that he had provided adequate information to the authorities to prevent the theft. The questioning escalated into a heated argument; Mukhtarov hit Stalin {{in the face and}} had to <b>be</b> <b>restrained</b> by other Okhrana officers. After this incident, Mukhtarov was suspended from the Okhrana, and Stalin was ordered to leave Tiflis and go to Baku to await a decision in the case. Stalin left Baku with 20,000rubles in stolen money in July 1907. While Brackman claims to have found evidence of this incident, whether Stalin cooperated with the Okhrana during his early life has been a subject of debate among historians for many decades and has yet to be resolved.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of war, Pohl, along with Georg von Müller, the Chief of the Imperial Naval Cabinet, and Friedrich von Ingenohl, {{the commander of the}} High Seas Fleet, believed that since the war would be over quickly, the fleet should be preserved intact. Together, they agreed that the fleet should <b>be</b> <b>restrained</b> to provide local defense of the German coast, rather than seek a decisive battle against the numerically superior British Grand Fleet. Pohl argued that U-boats should be used to attack British merchant shipping. He pushed for fewer restrictions on the conduct of the commerce war beginning in late 1914; he further advocated abandoning the cruiser rules that handicapped the German effort, in favor of unrestricted submarine warfare. He presented his first plans for an unlimited commerce war in November 1914, but these were rejected by the Kaiser and Bethmann-Hollweg so as not to antagonize neutral nations, in particular the United States.|$|E

Barton had to <b>be</b> <b>restrained</b> from attacking the boy further by teammate Richard Dunne. Barton underwent anger management therapy at the order of City manager Stuart Pearce and paid £120,000 in club fines.

5|$|It was {{reported}} that General Nguyễn Khánh — who had deposed Minh in a January 1964 coup — offered Cẩn exile if he handed over his foreign bank deposits. Cẩn protested, {{saying that he had}} no money. Đôn later claimed that Khánh would have executed Cẩn anyway, as Cẩn would have known of the corruption that the generals were party to. During the Ngô era, Khánh commanded the ARVN II Corps, which had operated in the Central Highlands under Cẩn's supervision. Despite having helped to arrest Cẩn, Lodge advised Khánh to <b>be</b> <b>restrained</b> in his handling of the case for fear of stoking religious resentment or upsetting international opinion with a death penalty.|$|E
5|$|Macartney's {{omission}} {{was part}} of the most infamous disputes in Australian cricket history and led to a fracas. Australian captain and selector Clem Hill wanted to include Macartney for the Third Test, but another member of the panel, former player Peter McAlister objected and said that Hill should omit himself if he wanted Macartney to play. Tensions between the two selectors were high, and came to a head in a selection meeting ahead of the Fourth Test. McAlister criticised Hill's tactics and policies towards his bowlers, provoking an exchange of insults regarding the other's leadership ability. Hill then bloodied McAlister with a powerful blow to the nose and the ensuing brawl lasted between 10 and 20 minutes. Furniture was knocked across the room, artwork shattered and Hill had to <b>be</b> <b>restrained</b> from throwing McAlister out of the third floor window, before resigning as a selector.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} CNTF and BDNF on a {{proteolytic}} complement instrumental to invasion and on differentiation was studied in two murine neuroblastoma clones, N 1 and N 7. At the membrane level, gelatinase MMP- 2 [...] mainly the activated form [...] <b>was</b> <b>restrained</b> by CNTF and BDNF to a residual 34 % with both factors; membrane-type 1 MMP was down-regulated to 50 % (10 h) and 34 % (24 h) with both factors; and urokinase-type plasminogen activator <b>was</b> <b>restrained</b> mainly by BDNF to 70 %. In the medium, the two gelatinases MMP- 2 and MMP- 9 were mainly in zymogen form: only MMP- 2 <b>was</b> <b>restrained</b> in N 1 cells, while only MMP- 9 <b>was</b> <b>restrained</b> in N 7 cells by both factors, single or in combination. These effects were paralleled by the induction of neurite outgrowth, {{which was more}} stimulated in the less differentiated clone. These dose-dependent and transient effects make CNTF and BDNF ideal candidates for constraining the potentially invasive behavior of nervous system tumor...|$|R
5|$|The Yamato {{tradition}} is the oldest, originating {{as early as}} the 4th century with the introduction of ironworking techniques from the mainland. According to legend, the smith Amakuni forged the first single-edged long swords with curvature (tachi) around 700. Even though there is no authentication of this event or date, the earliest Japanese swords were probably forged in Yamato Province. During the Nara period, many good smiths were located around the capital in Nara. They moved to Kyoto when it became capital {{at the beginning of the}} Heian period, but about 1200 smiths gathered again in Nara when the various sects centered in Nara rose to power during the Kamakura period and needed weapons to arm their monks. Thus, the Yamato {{tradition is}} associated closely with the warrior monks of Nara. Yamato tradition sugata is characterized by a deep torii-zori, high shinogi, and slightly extended kissaki. The jihada is mostly masame-hada, and the hamon is suguha, with rough nie. The bōshi is mainly ko-maru. Generally the style of Yamato blades is considered to <b>be</b> <b>restrained,</b> conservative and static. Five major schools or branches of the Yamato tradition are distinguished: Senjuin, Shikkake, Taima, Tegai and Hōshō. Four of the five schools are represented by national treasure swords.|$|E

When Tewodros saw this book, he became violently angry, pulled a gun on Stern, and had to <b>be</b> <b>restrained</b> from killing the missionary. Tewodros also received reports from abroad that foreign papers had quoted these European residents of Ethiopia as having said many negative things about him and his reign.|$|E
25|$|Initially, {{official}} {{disapproval of}} Codrington had to <b>be</b> <b>restrained</b> {{because of the}} admiral's huge popularity with the public. The Admiralty's revenge took petty form, such as its refusal, despite repeated requests by Codrington, to pay his crews their traditional prize-money {{from the sale of}} captured Ottoman treasure and goods. Meanwhile, Wellington was biding his time until he felt it was politically safe to remove Codrington from the Mediterranean theatre. Finally, in June 1828, the Admiralty announced that Codrington was being relieved of his command (although he remained in acting-command until his replacement arrived in August). Although the King felt obliged by public opinion to grant Codrington the high honour of the Grand Cross of the Bath, the Admiralty's failure to give him another operational command in his remaining decade of service was eloquent testimony to his fall from favour.|$|E

25|$|In {{a speech}} at the General Assembly Hall at Flushing Meadow, New York, on Friday, 28 November 1947, Iraq’s Foreign Minister, Fadel Jamall, {{included}} the following statement: Partition imposed against the will {{of the majority of the}} people will jeopardize peace and harmony in the Middle East. Not only the uprising of the Arabs of Palestine is to be expected, but the masses in the Arab world cannot <b>be</b> <b>restrained.</b> The Arab-Jewish relationship in the Arab world will greatly deteriorate. There are more Jews in the Arab world outside of Palestine than there are in Palestine. In Iraq alone, we have about one hundred and fifty thousand Jews who share with Moslems and Christians all the advantages of political and economic rights. Harmony prevails among Moslems, Christians and Jews. But any injustice imposed upon the Arabs of Palestine will disturb the harmony among Jews and non-Jews in Iraq; it will breed inter-religious prejudice and hatred.|$|E
25|$|On 12 June, Prime Minister Casares Quiroga met General Juan Yagüe, who falsely {{convinced}} Casares of {{his loyalty}} to the republic. Mola began serious planning in the spring. Franco was a key player because of his prestige as {{a former director of}} the military academy and as the man who suppressed the Asturian miners' strike of 1934. He was well respected in the Army of Africa, the Army's toughest troops. He wrote a cryptic letter to Casares on 23 June, suggesting that the military was disloyal, but could <b>be</b> <b>restrained</b> if he were put in charge. Casares did nothing, failing to arrest or buy off Franco. British sympathizers with the rebels (who were associated with the British Secret Intelligence Service) chartered a Dragon Rapide aircraft to transport Franco from the Canary Islands to Spanish Morocco. The plane flew to the Canaries on 11 July, and Franco arrived in Morocco on 19 July.|$|E
