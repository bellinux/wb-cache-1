Then at last the opportunity came, following on terrible provocation. That dark, foggy November night that you all remember so well! I was to meet my tyrant at the Veterans' Club at nine o'clock. I drove up there and as I {{stepped out of the}} cab I {{came face to face with}} Luke. Something in the boy's manner told me what had happened.

6000|$|... "That's soon done. I'll give it ye slick off.

Besides, I must cut the entrance-door down to the ground, for this tree-mendous flight o' stairs'll be the ruin o' the business. It's only a week since a man was shot by a comrade here in the cabin, an' as they rushed out after him, two customers fell down the stair and broke their arms. And I calc'late the gentlemen that's overtaken by liquor every night won't stand it much longer. There isn't a single man that quits this house after 12 p.m. but goes down that flight head-foremost. If you don't sanction that change, I guess I'll have to get 'em padded, and spread feather-beds at the foot. Now, cap'n, if you agrees to this right off, I'll give the sum named." ...|$|E

5000|$|The label didn't {{want to put}} {{anything}} out between October and February {{because they are so}} business minded, and that is when the big internationals are doing their Christmas releases and they didn't want to compete.

5000|$|James H. Cromartie {{was born}} into one of North Carolinaâs oldest and most {{prominent}} families, initially possessing over one-tenth of the stateâs entire territory. Despite {{the ease with which}} he could have obtained a career in civil service given his familyâs numerous political connections, a young Jim found himself inexorably drawn to the world of fine art, relishing, in particular, the renowned realist artists, Andrew Wyeth and Edward Hopper. Cromartie remembers, âThey had a small bookstore in the museumâ¦as a young third and fourth grade child I would steal those little books from the Mint Museum. Well I didnât actually steal them all, I would buy one and take three, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> thatâs <b>the</b> same thing.â [...] Inspired by these canonical works, but only able to view the bookstoreâs reproductions, Jim would later inadvertently pioneer a style that would be uniquely his own, Hard-Edge Realism. First, however, an important patron was fated to enter the life of the young artist, James H. Cromartie.|$|R

5000|$|In 2009, Linden {{was voted}} Holby City fans' [...] "Favourite Newcomer of Series 10", {{receiving}} 58.5% of the vote. Pow commented on his character's popularity and award win: [...] "I {{try not to}} think too much about Linden and how he is viewed by fans. I think it's great that you guys voted Linden as Best Newcomer and that he has been well received <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>the</b> fact he has a fan base is down to Tony McHale, Diana Kyle and the writing team coming up with such an interesting character and Tony, Diana, Liz Stoll and Julia Crampsie for giving me the opportunity to play him". Discussing the feedback he receives from viewers about Linden, Pow explained that people [...] "like his honesty and dedication to others", commenting that: [...] "he's quite selfless, I guess, and that is an incredibly endearing quality".|$|E

40|$|This {{paper has}} been {{submitted}} to an IEEE journal in June 1999. I {{have not received}} <b>the</b> reviewer comments <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> that <b>the</b> paper was too long and not well balanced between the algorithm and application description (too narrow or too large on some subjects). The effect of phase reference on phase unwrapping and discrete Fourier transform (DFT) phase behavior are first illustrated by z-transform. With the finite sequence z-transform and DFT, the phase is referenced at the first time sample of a N time samples window since the phase value is relative to this time position. With a DFT referenced like that, without a spectral interpolation between frequency lines, a spectral component has one or many line to line pi phase rotations below its main lobe and line to line 2 pi phase rotation on the outside: this 2 pi rotation appear like a continuous quasi-constant phase line to line. Conversely, a DFT referenced at the window center show a flat phase under a spectral component's main lobe and a pi phase rotation at every spectral line outside the main lobe. This latter phase pattern facilitates phase unwrapping. Moreover, the flat phase section under a main lobe simplifies the search for an optimal phase estimation algorithm with interpolated fast Fourier Transform (IFFT). It has been demonstrated, from the CramÃ©r-Rao bound, that the variance on the phase is minimal {{at the center of}} the time window, where it's suggest to put the phase reference for phase parameter estimation. This explain why the high-accuracy estimation algorithm, which we developed, like other algorithms developed by others authors, is not only close to the frequency and amplitude estimation error lower bounds, but also to the phase lower bound for a constant tone when we reference the phase to the window center. [...] This paper has been submitted to an IEEE journal in June 1999.

"Sometimes I take a pill to sleep, {{or two or}} six. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> that is <b>the</b> way it goes - {{when you}} put three years into making an album, you also become {{a bit of an}} insomniac.
