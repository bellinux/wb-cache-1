Managers with higher (lower) risk-adjusted performance are more likely to be promoted (demoted), but <b>total</b> <b>returns</b> are unrelated. These results provide a new perspective on the “puzzle ” of active management and the role of risk-adjusted versus <b>total</b> <b>returns</b> in investor decision-making...|$|R

5000|$|A <b>total</b> <b>return</b> swap is a swap {{in which}} party A pays the <b>total</b> <b>return</b> of an asset, and party B makes {{periodic}} interest payments. The <b>total</b> <b>return</b> is the capital gain or loss, plus any interest or dividend payments. Note {{that if the}} <b>total</b> <b>return</b> is negative, then party A receives this amount from party B. The parties have exposure to {{the return of the}} underlying stock or index, without having to hold the underlying assets. The profit or loss of party B is the same for him as actually owning the underlying asset.|$|R
50|$|A <b>total</b> <b>return</b> index (TRI) is {{different}} from a price index. A price index only considers price movements (capital gains or losses) of the securities {{that make up the}} index, while a <b>total</b> <b>return</b> index includes dividends, interest, rights offerings and other distributions realized over a given period of time. Looking at an index's <b>total</b> <b>return</b> is usually considered a more accurate measure of performance.|$|R

50|$|Stock {{and bond}} funds provide annual <b>Total</b> <b>Return</b> values {{summarizing}} {{the last ten}} years of operation. <b>Total</b> <b>Return</b> assumes that dividends and interest are reinvested in the funds. A reasonably accurate equation for the percent <b>Total</b> <b>Return</b> in a year of any security is the sum of the percent gain (or loss, a negative percent) over the year in the security value, plus the annual dividend yield expressed as a percent (100 × annual dividends divided by the security price {{at the beginning of the}} year). This slightly understates the <b>Total</b> <b>Return</b> because it ignores the reinvestment of dividends, as soon as they are paid, for purchasing more of the security. Professor Pankaj Agrrawal produced the ReturnFinder App to rectify the issue created by these web-charts, the App's algorithm includes dividends and bond income in the <b>total</b> <b>return</b> calculations. The problem can lead to the pernicious inversion of performance ordering with bond ETF's or stocks paying high dividends.|$|R

50|$|Some indices, {{such as the}} S&P 500, have {{multiple}} versions. These versions can differ based on how the index components are weighted and on how dividends are accounted for. For example, there are three versions of the S&P 500 index: price return, which only considers {{the price of the}} components, <b>total</b> <b>return,</b> which accounts for dividend reinvestment, and net <b>total</b> <b>return,</b> which accounts for dividend reinvestment after the deduction of a withholding tax. As another example, the Wilshire 4500 and Wilshire 5000 indices have five versions each: full capitalization <b>total</b> <b>return,</b> full capitalization price, float-adjusted <b>total</b> <b>return,</b> float-adjusted price, and equal weight. The difference between the full capitalization, float-adjusted, and equal weight versions is in how index components are weighted.|$|R

40|$|Since <b>total</b> bond <b>returns</b> {{contain a}} {{potential}} capital gain (or loss) component, {{there can be}} a wide divergence between a bond’s interest rate return and its perceived <b>total</b> <b>return,</b> depending on expectations about future interest rates and bond prices. It is possible for money demand to increase when bond interest rates are rising if one’s perception is of a declining <b>total</b> <b>return.</b> We study the liquidity demand behavior of a group of bond fund portfolio managers, for whom the perceived <b>total</b> <b>return</b> is paramount, and find evidence of a positive relationship between bond interest rates, the standard proxy for the opportunity cost of money, and the demand for cash balances. While these empirical results contradict the traditional presumption of a negative relationship between the demand for money and a bond interest rate return, they make economic sense if the perceived <b>total</b> <b>return</b> on a bond is the true opportunity cost of holding cash balances. </p...|$|R
