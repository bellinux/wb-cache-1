However, CVVs Bunyamwera serogroup’s two non-structural proteins play an important role in infection. <b>Bunyamwera</b> <b>virus</b> (BUNV) codes for two non-structural proteins: NSm on the medium RNA segment and NSs on the smallest RNA segment. <b>Bunyamwera</b> <b>virus</b> NSs protein is a nonessential gene that contributes to viral pathogenesis. It has been shown that in mammalian cells, NSs induces shut-off of host protein synthesis, which leads to cell death. It also counteracts the host cell antiviral response and seems to be the main virulence factor, acting at the level of transcription by inhibiting RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription. In mosquito cells neither host cell transcription nor translation are inhibited, and although so far no function for the orthobunyavirus NSs protein has been found in mosquito cells, it seems the differential behavior of NSs could be one of the factors responsible for different outcomes of infection in mammalian and mosquito cell lines.|$|E

Cryo-electron microscopy has also determined that whilst Bunyamwera virions are pleomorphic in shape, they display a locally ordered lattice of glycoprotein spikes.

Comparative antibody titers in individual sera indicated that 4. 1 % and 1. 6 % of these infections were caused by viruses similar or identical to Jamestown Canyon and California encephalitis, respectively. Evidence of prior infection with the Jamestown Canyon serotype was found in 10 % of 118 humans employed outdoors in high elevation areas and sampled in 1988, including 5 of 16 persons (31 %) employed as rangers patrolling in remote forests and meadows.

40|$|The blood-feeding {{patterns}} of mosquitoes are {{directly linked to}} the spread of pathogens that they transmit. Efficient identification of arthropod vector bloodmeal hosts can identify the diversity of vertebrate species potentially involved in disease transmission cycles. While molecular bloodmeal analyses rely on sequencing of cytochrome b (cyt b) or cytochrome oxidase 1 gene PCR products, recently developed bloodmeal host identification based on high resolution melting (HRM) analyses of cyt b PCR products is more cost-effective. To resolve the diverse vertebrate hosts that mosquitoes may potentially feed on in sub-Saharan Africa, we utilized HRM profiles of both cyt b and 16 S ribosomal RNA genes. Among 445 blood-fed Aedeomyia, Aedes, Anopheles, Culex, Mansonia, and Mimomyia mosquitoes from Kenya's Lake Victoria and Lake Baringo regions where many mosquito-transmitted pathogens are endemic, we identified 33 bloodmeal hosts including humans, eight domestic animal species, six peridomestic animal species and 18 wildlife species. This resolution of vertebrate host species was only possible by comparing profiles of both cyt b and 16 S markers, as melting profiles of some pairs of species were similar for either marker but not both. We identified mixed bloodmeals in a Culex pipiens from Mbita that had fed on a goat and a human and in two Mansonia africana mosquitoes from Baringo that each had fed on a rodent (Arvicanthis niloticus) in addition to a human or baboon.

40|$|Philosophiae Doctor - PhDBionomics of vector-borne {{pathogens}} (VBPs) is {{a complex}} phenomenon that involves understanding the ecology of arthropod borne pathogens and vertebrate hosts potentially involved in their transmission cycles. Investigations into the bionomics of viral and bacterial VBPs circulating in Baringo and Homa Bay Counties of Kenya were carried out. Specifically, vertebrate hosts represented in mosquito bloodmeals, presence of arboviruses in blood fed mosquitoes and patients presenting with acute undiagnosed febrile illnesses in rural health facilities, and tick borne pathogens (TBPs) diversity in ticks of animals were identified. Mosquitoes were trapped by BG sentinel and CDC light traps, while ticks were sampled directly from domestic animals and tortoises close to human habitation along the shores and adjacent islands of Lakes Victoria and Baringo in Kenya. Blood and sera were also sampled from patients presenting with acute febrile illnesses visiting four rural health facilities in Homa Bay County. Mosquitoes and ticks were sorted and identified to species using standard morphological taxonomic keys. All the biological samples (blood-fed mosquitoes, ticks and blood/sera) were processed using molecular and culture procedures for detection of VBPs (arboviruses, Ehrlichia, Anaplasma, Rickettsia and protozoa). Among 445 blood-fed Aedeomyia, Aedes, Anopheles, Culex, Mansonia, and Mimomyia mosquitoes, 33 bloodmeal hosts were identified including humans, eight domestic animal species, six peridomestic animal species and 18 wildlife species. Further detection of Sindbis and <b>Bunyamwera</b> <b>viruses</b> was done on blood-fed mosquito homogenates by Vero cell culture and RTPCR in Culex, Aedeomyia, Anopheles and Mansonia mosquitoes from Baringo that had fed on humans and livestock. In TBPs assay, 585 tick pools were analysed consisting of 4, 126 ticks collected in both study areas. More ticks were sampled in Baringo (80. 5 %), compared to Homa Bay (19. 5 %). In Baringo, agents of ehrlichiosis were detected from Amblyomma and Rhipicephalus ticks including Ehrlichia ruminantium (12. 3 %), Ehrichia canis (10. 5 %) and Paracoccus sp. (4. 4 %). Agents of anaplasmosis included Anaplasma ovis (7. 2 %), Anaplasma platys (4. 4 %) and Anaplasma bovis (4. 0 %), all from Hyalomma, Amblyomma and Rhipicephalus ticks, as well as agents of rickettsiosis, including Rickettsia africae, Rickettsia aeschlimannii, Rickettsia rhipicephali, Rickettsia montanensis and a Rickettsia sp. that was not conclusively characterized. Babesia caballi, Theileria sp. and Hepatozoon fitzsimonsi were also detected from both Rhipicephalus ticks and Amblyomma ticks. In Homa Bay, Ehrichia ruminantium (17. 5 %) and Ehrichia canis (9. 3 %) were isolated from Amblyomma latum and Rhipicephalus pulchellus, as well as Anaplasma platys (14. 4 %) and Anaplasma ovis (14. 4 %) from Amblyomma and Rhipicephalus species. In determination of the occurrence of arboviruses among patients presenting with acute febrile illnesses, acute Bunyamwera 3 (0. 9 %) and Sindbis 2 (0. 6 %) infections were detected by RT-PCR and cell culture and Sindbis seroprevalence was determined by plaque assay.

50|$|The genetic {{structure}} of <b>Bunyamwera</b> <b>virus</b> is typical for Bunyaviridae viruses, {{which are a}} family of enveloped negative-sense single stranded RNA viruses with a genome split into three parts—Small (S), Middle (M) and Large (L). The L RNA segment encodes an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L protein), the M RNA segment encodes two surface glycoproteins (Gc and Gn) and a nonstructural protein (NSm), while the S RNA segment encodes a nucleocapsid protein (N) and, in an alternative overlapping reading frame, a second nonstructural protein (NSs). The genomic RNA segments are encapsidated by copies of the N protein {{in the form of}} ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes. The N protein is the most abundant protein in virus particles and infected cells and, therefore, the main target in many serological and molecular diagnostics.|$|E
50|$|In {{terms of}} the {{structure}} of the nucleocapsid, the N protein will eventually oligomerize to encapsidate the single-stranded RNA. In some NSVs the N subunits are oriented in a parallel orientation, and the ssRNA is sequestered in the center. In most NSVs, the nucleocapsid appears to be a random coil, and the symmetry is linear. Because the N subunits are oriented in a parallel fashion, the cross-molecular interactions among the subunits stabilize the nucleocapsid and are critical for capsid formation. The linear interactions along the encapsidated single-stranded RNA are actually a unique feature to NSVs. X-ray crystal structures of N proteins and EM micrographs of RNP complexes from a number of Bunyaviridae (a Family of segmented NSVs that includes the <b>Bunyamwera</b> <b>virus</b> and the Schmallenberg virus) show that in these viruses the nucleocapsid adopts a helical arrangement where the N proteins form a head-to-tail chain by linking to each other via a flexible N-terminal arm. The resulting chain forms tight coils with four N proteins per turn that holds the circular ssRNA of these viruses on the inside of the coils and which extend to form large circular filaments.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{well known}} that the {{geographical}} distribution of Batai virus (BATV) includes the regions of Europe, Asia and Africa. The most common vertebrate affected by BATV are domestic pigs, horses, ruminants and wild birds, which have been known to be the primary mammalian hosts. The transmission cycle of BATV occurs in agricultural ecosystems via Anopheles, Culex and Ochlerotatus species mosquitoes in a typical vertebrate-mosquito cycle. [...] While limited research has been conducted on the viral cycle of the Batai virus, comparable studies with the close relative <b>Bunyamwera</b> <b>virus</b> has shown that viral infection begins in the salivary glands of mosquitos. At the onset of replication the virus particles coalesce into vacuole membranes lining the cytoplasm of the infected cells. Entry into the cell is facilitated by the viral enveloped nucleocapsid, which contains glycoproteins G1 and G2. Encoded by the M RNA segment they are involved in attachment to the host cell through unidentified receptors on the surface and elicit neutralizing antibodies. Transcription of BATV is said to be similar to that of influenza in that mRNA synthesis is primed by cap-containing oligonucleotides that are generated by a certain viral-endonuclease, functioning to cleave the host cell mRNA. These resulting primers are then incorporated into the viral mRNA. BATV will also encode for two non-structural proteins, NSm on the M segment and NSs on the S segment. During the process it is believed that NSm actively participates in assembly of the virus. These newly assembled viral particles will mature {{over a period of time}} inside of the hosts cell in the membranes of the Golgi apparatus before being released. However, while able to replicate in both vertebrate and invertebrate species, in mosquito cells no cell death is observed and persistent infection is established. Whereas in mammalian cells infection is typically categorized as lytic and eventually leads to cell death. This stems from the viruses ability to form clear lytic plaques in cells of vertebrate species but not in those derived from insects.It has been demonstrated in previous studies that in mammalian cells, the NSs protein will induce a shut-off of host protein synthesis which will lead to the death of the host cell. It has also been shown to counteract the host cell antiviral response. This would establish it as the main virulence factor as it acts during the transcriptional phase by inhibiting RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription. Meanwhile, the mosquito cells neither host cell transcription nor translation are inhibited by this fact. It would seem the difference in the behavior of the NSs protein could be one of the factors responsible for the different outcomes of infection attributed to the Batai virus in mammalian and mosquito cells. Some have theorized that a release method that does not rupture the cell membrane could explain why viral replication does not kill mosquito cells and persistence is maintained. Similar NSs proteins of the Rift Valley fever phlebovirus have quite a distinct size and amino acid sequence, but they play a similar role in mammalian cells in overcoming the innate immune responses that are a consequence of the global shut-down of the cells transcription mechanisms.

40|$|Severe acute {{respiratory}} syndrome (SARS) {{is caused}} by a novel coronavirus termed SARS-CoV. We and others have previously shown that the replication of SARS-CoV can be suppressed by exogenously added interferon (IFN), a cytokine which is normally synthesized by cells as a reaction to virus infection. Here, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV escapes IFN-mediated growth inhibition by preventing the induction of IFN-β. In SARS-CoV-infected cells, no endogenous IFN-β transcripts and no IFN-β promoter activity were detected. Nevertheless, the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF- 3), which is essential for IFN-β promoter activity, was transported from the cytoplasm to the nucleus early after infection with SARS-CoV. However, at a later time point in infection, IRF- 3 was again localized in the cytoplasm. By contrast, IRF- 3 remained in the nucleus of cells infected with the IFN-inducing control <b>virus</b> <b>Bunyamwera</b> delNSs. Other signs of IRF- 3 activation such as hyperphosphorylation, homodimer formation, and recruitment of the coactivator CREB-binding protein (CBP) were found late after infection with the control virus but not with SARS-CoV. Our data suggest that nuclear transport of IRF- 3 is an immediate-early reaction to virus infection and may precede its hyperphosphorylation, homodimer formation, and binding to CBP.

40|$|International audienceReverse {{genetics}} is {{a critical}} tool to decrypt the biological properties of arboviruses. However, whilst reverse genetics methods have been usually applied to vertebrate cells, their use in insect cells remains uncommon due to the conjunction of laborious molecular biology techniques and of specific difficulties surrounding the transfection of such cells. To leverage reverse genetics studies in both vertebrate and mosquito cells, we designed an improved DNA transfection protocol for insect cells and then demonstrated that the simple and flexible ISA (Infectious Subgenomic Amplicons) reverse-genetics method can be efficiently applied to both mammalian and mosquito cells to generate in days recombinant infectious positive-stranded RNA viruses belonging to genera Flavivirus (Japanese encephalitis, Yellow fever, West Nile and Zika viruses) and Alphavirus (Chikungunya virus). This method represents an effective option to potentially overcome technological {{issues related to the}} study of arboviruses. Arboviruses (Arthropod-borne viruses) constitute a large group of viruses carried and spread by blood feeding arthropods, especially mosquitoes, ticks and sandflies. They can be transmitted to a variety of vertebrates and are responsible for significant morbidity and mortality amongst humans and farmed animals globally. Arboviral diseases in humans range from mild febrile illness to severe encephalitis or haemorrhagic fever 1. Iterative outbreaks worldwide over the past decades have highlighted the emergence or re-emergence potential of arboviruses, which are thus considered to be significant public and animal health threats 1 – 3. Most arboviruses of public health importance are single-stranded RNA viruses belonging to the families Flavi-, Toga-, or Bunyaviridae. Research focusing on arboviruses knew dramatic progress thanks to the use of reverse genetics systems allowing the study of virus life cycles, understanding the effect of specific mutations on viral replication or pathogen-esis, and designing new vaccine strategies 4, 5. However, these reverse genetics systems focused to date almost exclusively on mammalian cells. Since arboviruses life cycle involves replication in both invertebrate vectors and vertebrate hosts, a simple and universal reverse genetics method allowing producing recombinant arboviruses in both vertebrate and arthropod cells would obviously facilitate the study of arbovirus biological properties, of their genomic evolution or cell interactions and restrictions. This awaited knowledge could provide in the future the key elements needed to predict outbreaks and to find efficient therapy. Unfortunately, although most reverse genetics systems proved to be efficient to recover arboviruses from vertebrate cell lines (for reviews see 4, 5), very few studies have reported such systems for arthropod cells and especially for cells from Aedes mosquitoes, {{one of the most important}} arbovirus vectors globally 6. Indeed, reverse genetics systems designed for positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses in Aedes mosquito cells are typically based to date on the lipofection or electroporation of synthetic capped RNA transcripts generated by in vitro transcription from SP 6 - 7 – 9 or T 7 promoter-driven 10 – 16 full-length viral cDNA constructs.

Nevertheless, these reverse genetics systems suffer from two main limitations. First, the construction of full-length viral cDNA clones remains difficult and time consuming.

40|$|The {{study of}} {{three-dimensional}} protein structure {{is essential to}} understanding the myriad of functions of these important biomolecules and the complexes they form. Viruses are entities that exploit their protein machinery {{with a high degree}} of efficacy and economy and the structural characterisation of virus proteins is vital to discovering new ways to combat disease. No single biophysical technique can provide a complete picture of protein architecture, so a range of complementary approaches is required. This thesis presents the use of noncovalent mass spectrometry (MS) techniques for the study of a diverse range of viral structural proteins, including human, animal, and bacterial viruses. Noncovalent MS and travelling-wave ion mobility spectrometry-MS (TWIMS-MS) were used successfully to analyse the dynamic behaviour of the assembly domain (CP 149) of the capsid protein of hepatitis B virus (HBV), and, along with limited proteolysis, locate these dynamics to the C-terminus of a half-dimer. The C-terminus is crucial for virus particle assembly and such direct conformational analysis is • difficult with more established techniques. Following this, investigations were made into the effects of an anti-HBV small molecule, HAP-l, on the behaviour of CP 149. The molecule had no observable effect on CP 149 conformation but interestingly, induced the formation of oligomers which were found by TWIMS-MS to have a globular structure, i. e. not 'sheet-like' as may be expected for assembly intermediates. The small molecule also promoted the formation of large flat particles observed by electron microscopy (EM). The formation of these two rather different classes of particle possibly reflects two facets of the activity of the HAP class of compounds in cells. The technique of collision-induced unfolding (ClU) was studied to investigate whether this can be used to characterise and differentiate between CP 149 mutants. Although valuable insights into the unfolding pathway were revealed, together with a number of distinct conformational families, it was found that ClU could not distinguish between the mutations. This is thought to be a result of the substitution of only hydrophobic residues, which may not influence gas-phase structure due to the absence of the hydrophobic effect. MS, TWIMS-MS, EM and coarse-grained structural modelling were utilised to study the oligomerisation processes of the nucleocapsid (N) proteins of <b>Bunyamwera</b> and Schmallenberg <b>viruses</b> from the Bunyaviridae family, a topical and increasingly important class of viruses, for which there is currently no high resolution structural information. The N proteins were shown to oligomerise on binding to RNA to form a range of well-defined but different oligomers. The MS and EM data suggest the shapes of the oligomers to be based on ring structures rather than possible tetramer-based arrangements. These data represent the first insights into the assembly pathways of these important viruses, and the first such MS assembly study of a non-spherical virus class. Noncovalent MS and TWIMS-MS were used to study the baseplate complexes of bacteriophages known to infect the bacterium lactococcus lactis, which is important to the dairy industry. The phages p 2 and TP 901 - 1 have multiprotein organelles termed baseplates that mediate cell attachment and genome release and are critical for infection. The complexes, of 0. 8 and 1. 8 MDa, respectively, were characterised in terms of their mass, and stoichiometry as were several subcomplexes likely to be important in assembly. The studies, in conjunction with published EM and X-ray crystallography data, highlighted the importance of the distal tail protein as a central hub to control baseplate assembly and showed that valuable structural information can be gained in the absence of high resolution crystallography data. In summary, MS and TWIMS-MS were found to be valuable tools with which to study protein dynamics, structure and assembly, which makes them vital for the advancement of biophysical characterisation of viral systems.

40|$|Virus-specific {{polypeptide}} synthesis {{was examined}} in BHK cells and Vero cells infected with <b>Bunyamwera</b> <b>virus.</b> In BHK cells, {{in addition to}} the four previously reported virus-coded proteins (L, G 1, G 2, and N), three other infection-specific proteins were detected. These proteins, of nominal molecular weight 50, 000 (p 50), 16, 000 (p 16), and 13, 000 (p 13), were not labeled in mock-infected cells, were first synthesized between 4 and 8 h after infection, and were relatively prominent among the limited number of proteins generated late in infection. In preparations of purified <b>Bunyamwera</b> <b>virus</b> from BHK cell supernatants, p 16 was detected but not p 50 or p 13. In Vero cells infected with <b>Bunyamwera</b> <b>virus,</b> both p 50 and p 13 were labeled strongly. Maprik virus, a member of the Mapputta group of arboviruses, {{is a member of the}} Bunyavirus genus (S. E. Newton, unpublished data). Maprik virus did not induce the synthesis of p 50, p 16, or p 13; however, two smaller proteins (p 17 and p 15) which may correspond to p 16 and p 13 were labeled late in Maprik infection. Our data argue that p 16 is a virus-coded component of the <b>Bunyamwera</b> <b>virus</b> particle and that p 50 and p 13 are virus-coded, nonstructural proteins...|$|E
40|$|<b>Bunyamwera</b> <b>virus</b> NSs {{protein is}} {{involved}} in the inhibition of cellular transcription and the interferon (IFN) response, and it interacts with the Med 8 component of Mediator. A spontaneous mutant of a recombinant NSs-deleted <b>Bunyamwera</b> <b>virus</b> (rBUNdelNSs 2) was identified and characterized. This mutant virus, termed mBUNNSs 22, expresses a 21  aa N-terminally truncated form of NSs. Like rBUNdelNSs 2, mBUNNSs 22 is attenuated in IFN-deficient cells, and to a greater extent in IFN-competent cells. Both rBUNdelNSs 2 and mBUNNSs 22 are potent IFN inducers and their growth can be rescued by depleting cellular IRF 3. Strikingly, despite encoding an NSs protein that contains the Med 8 interaction domain, mBUNNSs 22 fails to block RNA polymerase II activity during infection. Overall, our data suggest that both the interaction of NSs with Med 8 and a novel unidentified function of the NSs N-terminus, seem necessary for <b>Bunyamwera</b> <b>virus</b> to counteract host antiviral responses...|$|E
40|$|Two {{isolates}} of a virus of {{the genus}} Orthobunyavirus (family Bunyaviridae) were obtained from hemorrhagic fever cases during a large disease outbreak in East Africa in 1997 and 1998. Sequence analysis of regions of the three genomic RNA segments of the virus (provisionally referred to as Garissa virus) suggested {{that it was a}} genetic reassortant virus with S and L segments derived from <b>Bunyamwera</b> <b>virus</b> but an M segment from an unidentified virus {{of the genus}} Orthobunyavirus. While high genetic diversity (52 %) was revealed by analysis of virus M segment nucleotide sequences obtained from 21 members of the genus Orthobunyavirus, the Garissa and Ngari virus M segments were almost identical. Surprisingly, the Ngari virus L and S segments showed high sequence identity with those of <b>Bunyamwera</b> <b>virus,</b> showing that Garissa virus is an isolate of Ngari virus, which in turn is a <b>Bunyamwera</b> <b>virus</b> reassortant. Ngari virus should be considered when investigating hemorrhagic fever outbreaks throughout sub-Saharan Africa...|$|E

Bunyaviruses possess a tri-segmented, negative-sense RNA genome that encodes four structural proteins: the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L protein) on the large (L) segment, two glycoproteins (Gn and Gc) on the medium (M) segment, and the nucleoprotein (N) on the small (S) segment. In addition, orthobunyaviruses encode one or two non-structural proteins, NSm on the M segment and NSs (for most but not all orthobunyaviruses; Mohamed et al., 2009) on the S segment (Nichol et al., 2005; Schmaljohn &...|$|E
40|$|Biological phenotypes of tri-segmented arboviruses display {{characteristics}} that map to mutation/s in the S, M or L {{segments of the}} genome. Plaque variants have been characterized for other viruses displaying varied phenotypes including attenuation in growth and/or pathogenesis. In order to characterize variants of Bunyamwera and Ngari viruses, we isolated individual plaque size variants; small plaque (SP) and large plaque (LP) and determined in vitro growth properties and in vivo pathogenesis in suckling mice. We performed gene sequencing to identify mutations that {{may be responsible for}} the observed phenotype. The LP generally replicated faster than the SP and the difference in growth rate was more pronounced in <b>Bunyamwera</b> <b>virus</b> isolates. Ngari virus isolates were more conserved with few point mutations compared to <b>Bunyamwera</b> <b>virus</b> isolates which displayed mutations in all three genome segments but majority were silent mutations. Contrary to expectation, the SP of <b>Bunyamwera</b> <b>virus</b> killed suckling mice significantly earlier than the LP. The LP attenuation may probably be due to a non-synonymous substitution (T 858 I) that mapped within the active site of the L protein. In this study, we identify natural mutations whose exact role in growth and pathogenesis need to be determined through site directe...|$|E
40|$|Orthobunyaviruses, tri-segmented, negative-sense RNA viruses, {{have long}} been {{associated}} with mild to severe human disease in Africa, but not haemorrhagic fever. However, during a Rift Valley fever outbreak in East Africa in 1997 – 1998, Ngari virus was isolated from two patients and antibody detected in several others with haemorrhagic fever. The isolates were used to identify Ngari virus as a natural Orthobunyavirus reassortant. Despite their potential to reassort and cause severe human disease, characterization of orthobunyaviruses is hampered by paucity of genetic sequences. Our objective was to obtain complete gene sequences of two <b>Bunyamwera</b> <b>virus</b> and three Ngari virus isolates from recent surveys in Kenya and to determine their phylogenetic positioning within the Bunyamwera serogroup. Newly sequenced Kenyan <b>Bunyamwera</b> <b>virus</b> isolates clustered closest to a <b>Bunyamwera</b> <b>virus</b> isolate from the same locality and a Central African Republic isolate indicating that similar strains may be circulating regionally. Recent Kenyan Ngari isolates were closest to the Ngari isolates associated with the 1997 – 1998 haemorrhagic fever outbreak. We observed a temporal/geographical relationship among Ngari isolates in all three gene segments suggesting a geographical/temporal association with genetic diversity. These sequences in addition to earlier sequences {{can be used for}} future analyses of this neglected but potentially deadly group of viruses.
