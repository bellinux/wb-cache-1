5|$|Bok tried {{twice to}} flee from slavery {{at the age}} of 14. The first {{instance}} happened early one morning after he had been sent out with the cattle. Bok blindly ran down a road for several miles before he was captured by one of Giemma's fellow militia members. Giemma's peer returned Francis to the Giemma's compound, where he was beaten with a bullwhip. Bok attempted to escape once again just two days later, when he fled in the opposite direction of his previous escape. He once again fled for several miles, this time keeping to the forest. He stopped for water at a local stream crossing, where he was spotted by Giemma who happened to <b>be</b> <b>there</b> <b>as</b> well. Giemma forced Francis back to his home, this time promising to kill him. Francis was beaten again, but Giemma chose not to kill him, as Francis had become too valuable to the family as a slave.|$|E

25|$|Although Seng {{always had}} an {{interest}} in photography, he never had any formal photography education. Seng began his photography career in 2009 while he was the music editor and writer for Pelican, the UWA student newspaper. While filling in the media accreditation form for the West Coast Blues & Roots Festival, Seng surreptitiously ticked the box for a photographer's pass even though he was only supposed to <b>be</b> <b>there</b> <b>as</b> a writer. Seng borrowed a friend's camera and researched how to take photos on the Internet. The photos turned out decently, leading Seng to buy his own camera and continue pursuing photography.|$|E

She finished her education at the Milton Keynes School of Life in Malta, then returned to England for National Service. She started doing standard security work with the occasional surveillance of subversive members of society, but ended working as a counter-espionage agent.

500|$|Colin Jacobson {{from the}} DVD Movie Guide website complained about {{its lack of}} {{sharpness}} and commented, [...] "Frankly, I'm {{at a loss to}} understand how such an unattractive video hit the shelves". He also criticized the lack of extra content, but complimented the DVD's sound. Jacobson gave the release's image, sound and extras ratings of D+, A-, D, respectively. Aaron Beriele from DVD Talk website shared Jacobson's views, saying that it was [...] "a wonderful show from Madonna and I can only imagine {{what it was like to}} actually <b>be</b> <b>there.</b> <b>As</b> for the DVD, it offers outstanding audio quality, but only so-so image quality. Still, it's a terrific show and the DVD still certainly gets a recommendation." ...|$|E
500|$|Jackson {{already had}} a long-standing history of writing {{charitable}} or socially conscious material. As a child, he had recorded the song [...] "In Our Small Way" [...] for his first album Got to <b>Be</b> <b>There.</b> <b>As</b> an adult, Jackson used his fame and wealth to promote various causes. In 1985, he co-wrote the charity single [...] "We Are the World" [...] with Lionel Richie, which was released worldwide to aid the poor in Africa and the US. The single {{became one of the}} best-selling singles of all time, with nearly 20million copies sold and millions of dollars donated to famine relief. It was also the first time Jackson was seen as a humanitarian. All of the profits from his single [...] "Man in the Mirror" [...] went to charity. Jackson founded the [...] "Heal the World Foundation" [...] in 1992, inspired by his charity single of the same name.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Liz Lemon (Tina Fey), {{the head}} {{writer of the}} sketch show TGS with Tracy Jordan, is unhappy {{about the lack of}} respect she gets from her writing staff and {{complains}} to Jack, her boss, about the situation. Jack asks her if staff writer James [...] "Toofer" [...] Spurlock (Keith Powell) can be promoted to co-head writer in an effort to diversify NBC. Liz accepts, seeing this as an opportunity for someone else to get the lack of respect and complaints she does. She gets upset, though, when Toofer gets a television interview as head writer, and insists that she herself should also <b>be</b> <b>there</b> <b>as</b> she is co-head writer. The two appear on Rutherford Rice's (Reg E. Cathey) talk show Right On, a show aimed toward African-American audiences. Liz gets visibly upset when Rice gives Toofer all of the credit she deserves, {{and as a result of}} her behavior she is escorted off the set by a security guard.|$|E

500|$|The {{ship was}} laid down on 29 January 1912 at Ganz & Company's Danubius yard at Fiume (current-day Rijeka), the only large Hungarian {{shipyard}} in Croatia. Ganz & Company {{was awarded the}} contract to build the battleship {{in return for the}} Hungarian government agreeing to the 1910 and 1911 naval budgets. This involved great expense by the Hungarian government, as the yard had hitherto only built smaller merchant ships for, amongst others, , and therefore had to be itself refitted for the building of larger vessels. However she was renamed [...] by order of the Emperor Franz Joseph before she was launched on 17 January 1914. It was customary for either the Emperor or his heir to be present at the launching of a major warship, but Franz Joseph was too feeble and his heir, Archduke Franz Ferdinand, refused to <b>be</b> <b>there</b> <b>as</b> a consequence of his anti-Hungarian attitudes. Franz Joseph sent a telegram of congratulations that negated the snub offered by his heir. During the launching itself there was an accident when the starboard anchor had to be dropped to prevent the ship from hitting a ship carrying spectators, but the anchor chain had not been shackled to the ship and it struck two dockworkers, killing one and crushing the arm of the other. Her fitting out was delayed by the start of the war, but she was finally commissioned on 13 December 1915.|$|E
