40|$|Thesis (M. S., Civil Engineering) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2013. As {{part of an}} {{investigation}} to reduce seismic damage to partition walls and other finishes in light-frame residential buildings, twenty full-scale gypsum-sheathed walls, built with wood and cold-formed steel framing members, were tested. The experiments investigated the effects of enhanced, inexpensive construction procedures with the objective to increase the racking strength and stiffness of partition-type shear walls, lessening seismic deformations. The stiffness, strength, and damage progression of the specimens with varying wall length, openings, orthogonal wall returns, tie-down and anchoring configurations, and interior and exterior sheathings are reported in this thesis. Iterative tests of specific interior wall geometries determined the optimal construction techniques required to reduce deformations and improve life-cycle performance. The main improvement to these specimens over typical construction {{was the use of}} construction adhesive and mechanical fasteners to attach the sheathing to the framing. Additional enhancements included mid-height blocking, improved corner <b>stud</b> <b>assemblies,</b> properly sized tie downs at the ends of wall segments, and bent straps on the exterior of planar wood-framed walls. The stiffness, strength, and residual capacity of specimens with orthogonal walls increased as compared to specimens with in-plane-only shear walls. Civil Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of an experimental study on the fire resistance of lightweight steel-framed (LSF) assemblies, conducted at the National Research Council of Canada in collaboration with industry partners. A total of 14 full-scale fire resistance tests were conducted on loadbearing gypsum board-protected, steel <b>stud</b> wall <b>assemblies.</b> The wall assemblies had either diagonal cross-bracing or shear membrane to enhance shear resistance to lateral loads. Both single row and double row steel stud configurations with installation of gypsum board on each of the fire exposed and unexposed sides were considered in the experimental program. The insulation used, within the wall assemblies, were glass, rock and dry-blown cellulose fibers. Some of the wall assemblies were provided with resilient channels, often used in wall designs to improve their sound transmission classification (STC) ratings, to study their effect on the fire resistance of steel stud walls. These tests were conducted {{to determine the effects of}} stud arrangement, crossbracing or shear membrane, load intensity, resilient channel installation, insulation type and thickness of studs on the fire resistance of gypsum board-protected, steel <b>stud</b> wall <b>assemblies.</b> Details of the results, including the temperatures and deflections measured during the fire resistance tests, are presented.

40|$|Cold-formed steel {{structural}} members are used extensively in building construction, {{with a common}} application being wind load bearing steel studs. The studs frame into horizontal steel track members {{at the top and}} bottom of the wall assembly, with the stud-to-track connection typically being made with self-drilling screws or welds. The wall studs are designed to carry lateral loads only and must be checked for web crippling at the end reactions. While a design expression currently exists for the single stud-to-track connection, there is no similar design expression for multiple jamb stud members. An experimental investigation was carried out, consisting of 94 jamb <b>stud</b> <b>assembly</b> tests subjected to end-one-flange loading. The stud-to-track connections consisted of single C-section studs located at the end of a track simulating a door opening, and a built-up jamb made up of two studs simulating framing at either a window or door opening. The members were attached to the track with self-drilling screws. The research objective was to determine the failure modes and develop a design expression for these structural assemblies. The scope of the experimental investigation covered the following range of parameters: i) 	Stud and track depths of 92 mm and 152 mm; ii) 	Stud and track thickness (0. 84 mm, 1. 12 mm, 1. 52 mm and 1. 91 mm); iii) 	Configuration of jamb studs (back-to-back, toe-to-toe and single); iv) 	Location of jamb studs in the track (interior and end); v) 	Screw size (# 8, # 10 and # 12); vi) 	Screw location (both flanges and single flange). Based on the findings of this investigation, design expressions are proposed to predict the capacity of this connection for two limit states: web crippling of the jamb stud; and, punch-through of the track. The web crippling design expression was taken from the North American Specification for the Design of Cold-Formed Steel Structural Members [AISI 2007 a; CSA 2007] with new coefficients developed from the test data of the jamb stud-to-track assemblies. A new design expression is also proposed for the track punch-through failure mode, which differs from the approach currently used in the North American Standard for Cold-Formed Steel Framing – Wall Stud Design [AISI 2007 b]. A proposal is also recommended to revise the wording in the North American Standard for Cold-Formed Steel Framing – Wall Stud Design [AISI 2007 b] to include provisions for the design of jamb studs based on the results of this research...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Based on Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) requirements, project {{specific}} blast loads {{are determined}} {{for the design}} of a new airport traffic control tower. These blast loads must be resisted by exterior wall panels on the control tower, protecting building occupants from intentional explosives attack scenarios. Such blast resistant walls are typically constructed of thick reinforced concrete panels or composite steel plate and rolled sections, as conventional building cladding systems have relatively low blast resistance. While these more robust design approaches are valid, the additional cladding mass they represent will significantly increase the base shear and overturning demand in seismic zones. This paper investigates the use of a light structural system comprised of a steel <b>stud</b> wall <b>assembly</b> partially embedded in a thin layer of concrete to obtain composite action. Fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) composites are also included to increase the blast resistance and aid in keeping the panel weight to a minimum. Two full-scale composite steel stud walls are designed, constructed, and tested dynamically in the BakerRisk shock tube. The stud walls consist of back-to-back 150 mm deep, 14 gauge (1. 8 mm thick), cold-formed steel studs spaced at 610 mm on center. Both specimens have a 50 mm thick normal weight concrete layer, reinforced with welded wire mesh that is welded to the stu...|$|R

Because there is currently no standard U-Factor calculation method for CFS walls, designers and code officials alike tend to resort to the zone method. However, the zone method is restricted to larger span assemblies because the zone factor coefficient is 2. 0. This tends to overestimate the amount of surface area influenced by CFS.

The connection between the sheathing and the stud {{should be able to}} develop enough resistance to restrain global buckling of the studs; therefore, special attention has to be given to the demands on these connections for design. Local buckling and stress concentrations may damage some connections and redistribution of forces should be ensured. Classical practice for determining fastener demand - i. e., the 2 % rule - may be deficient. An analytical method developed for determining fastener demand is compared to the FE models presented in this paper; the analytical method results in a reasonable prediction of the fastener forces in wall studs...|$|R
50|$|Aspatria is {{an ancient}} {{settlement}} and {{seems to have been}} home to a group of Norsemen who fled to the area from Ireland around 900. In 1789, a surgeon by the name of a Mr Rigg employed a group of labourers to level a mound called Beacon Hill, situated close behind his house at Aspatria. After reaching a depth of about one metre they dug into a cavity walled around with large stones and found the skeleton of a Viking chief almost complete over two metres in length. At the head of the gigantic skeleton lay a sword almost two metres in length, with a remarkably broad blade, ornamented with a gold and silver handle. The scabbard of the sword was made of wood, lined with cloth. The workmen also unearthed several pieces of armour, a dirk with a silver <b>studded</b> <b>handle,</b> a golden buckled belt, and a breast plate. The artefacts remain the property of the British Museum. Further finds were made on the same site in 1997 when a mobile phone mast was being constructed.|$|R
50|$|Lothal {{offers two}} {{new types of}} potter work, a convex bowl with or without <b>stud</b> <b>handle,</b> and a small jar with flaring rim, both in the {{micaceous}} Red Ware period, not found in contemporary Indus cultures. Lothal artists introduced {{a new form of}} realistic painting. Paintings depict animals in their natural surroundings. On one large vessel, the artist depicts birds with fish in their beaks, resting in a tree, while a fox-like animal stands below. This scene bears resemblance to the story of The Fox and the Crow in the Panchatantra. Artistic imagination is also suggested via careful portrayals—for example, several birds with legs aloft in the sky suggest flight, while half-opened wings suggest imminent flight. On a miniature jar, the story of the thirsty crow and deer is depicted - of how the deer could not drink from the narrow-mouth of the jar, while the crow succeeded by dropping stones in the jar. The features of the animals are clear and graceful. Movements and emotions are suggested by the positioning of limbs and facial features—in a 15 x 5 cm jar without overcrowding.|$|R
