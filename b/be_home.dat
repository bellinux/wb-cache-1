5|$|At about eleven o'clock, Cox began urging Ashford to leave. When the two did leave, it {{was with}} Thornton, who {{accompanied}} Ashford closely, while Cox walked behind them.

5|$|By 1966, {{the shops}} had been rebuilt in 'barren' Broadmead (at {{the expense of}} {{demolishing}} an area of Victorian, Georgian and Tudor buildings that had escaped the wartime bombing more or less unscathed), and the Wine Street and Castle Street area was being used for car parking.

The plan for Castle Park was crystallising, however. The ruined St Peter's Church would be surrounded by a museum and an art gallery; to the east of this there would be an arts centre and the remaining area east to Lower Castle Street would be a park. The south-western corner nearest Bristol Bridge would contain a riverside hotel, and the north-western corner would <b>be</b> <b>home</b> to 'a block for cultural, professional and exhibition purposes'.|$|E
