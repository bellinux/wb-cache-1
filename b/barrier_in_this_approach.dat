40|$|The {{feasibility}} {{of a new}} approach of laser fusion in plasma without implosion has been proposed and is discussed using an intense laser. The {{cross section of the}} nuclear reaction is increased by enhancing the penetrability of nuclei through the Coulomb <b>barrier.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>approach,</b> an intense laser field of more than 100 PW was required to distort the Coulomb barrier to obtain enough penetrability. An energy gain even with Deuterium-Deuterium (D-D) reaction can be obtained using this scheme in Deuterium plasma. A reactor with neutron and direct conversion of charged particle beam individually is proposed. Charged particles from D-D reaction are guided {{to the end of the}} reactor and are directly converted by a MHD scheme into electric energy. The energy recovery rate is high and requires a small amount of laser energy, which may make the energy cost cheaper than that of a fission reactor...|$|E
40|$|In {{functional}} metagenomics, BLAST homology {{search is}} a common method to classify metagenomic reads into protein/ domain sequence families such as Clusters of Orthologous Groups of proteins (COGs) in order to quantify the abundance of each COG in the community. The resulting functional profile of the community is then used in downstream analysis to correlate the change in abundance to environmental perturbation, clinical variation, and so on. However, the short read length coupled with next-generation sequencing technologies poses a <b>barrier</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>approach,</b> essentially because similarity significance cannot be discerned by searching with short reads. Consequently, artificial functional families are produced, in which those {{with a large number}} of reads assigned decreases the accuracy of functional profile dramatically. There is no method available to address this problem. We intended to fill this gap in this paper. We revealed that BLAST similarity scores of homologues for short reads from COG protein members coding sequences are distributed differently from the scores of those derived elsewhere. We showed that, by choosing an appropriate score cut-off, we are able to filter out most artificial families and simultaneously to preserve sufficient information in order to build the functional profile. We also showed that, by incorporated application of BLAST and RPS-BLAST, some artificial families with large read counts can be further identified after the score cutoff filtration. Evaluated on three experimental metagenomic datasets with different coverages, we found that the proposed method is robust against read coverage and consistently outperforms the other E...|$|E
40|$|The Navier-Stokes {{equations}} (NSE) {{provide an}} excellent {{description of the}} dynamics of fluid flows. However, analytical studies of NSE are still beyond the reach of our current mathematical methods. We, therefore, proceed to the direct numerical simulation of the NSE. The main <b>barrier</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>approach</b> is the difficulty in resolving the small scales of motion when the Reynolds number is high enough. The computing resources required as the Reynolds number increases become enormous. We, therefore, proceed to modeling the small scales of motion by developing equations which describe the small-scale effects even under a coarsely resolved grid. Results In recent years, analytic subgrid scale models of turbulence have been extensively studied (see, e. g., [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [7], [8]). Here, I would like to introduce a new subgrid scale turbulence model called the modified Leray-α model [13]. Let me start by giving a brief historical description of where this model originated. We recall the Leray-α model of turbulence [4]: (1) ∂tv − ν∆v + (u · ∇) v = −∇p+ f, ∇ · u = ∇ · v = 0, v = u − α 2 ∆u, u(x, 0) = uin(x). Notice that the above system is the NSE system when α = 0, i. e., u = v. In order to study the question of existence of solutions to the NSE, Leray, in his pioneering work [14], considered a general regularization form of the NSE in which the relationship between u and v in (1) is given by u = φα ∗ v...|$|E

40|$|Many project {{management}} approaches have emerged {{to improve performance}} in the construction industry. Lean construction {{is one of the}} ways to design systems to minimize wastage of materials, time and effort in order to generate maximum possible amount of value.

40|$|AbstractThere is a {{need for}} the {{prevention}} of upper extremity injuries that affect a large number of competitive baseball players. Currently available evidence alludes to three possible ways to prevent these injuries: 1) regulation of unsafe participation factors, 2) implementation of exercise intervention to modify suboptimal physical characteristics, and 3) instructional intervention to correct improper pitching techniques. Of these three strategies, instruction of proper pitching technique is under-explored as a method of injury prevention. Therefore, the purpose of this review was to explore the utility of pitching technique instruction in prevention of pitching-related upper extremity injuries by presenting evidence linking pitching technique and pitching-related upper extremity injuries, as well as identifying considerations and potential <b>barriers</b> <b>in</b> pursuing <b>this</b> <b>approach</b> to prevent injuries. Various kinematic parameters measured using laboratory-based motion capture system have been linked to excessive joint loading, and thus pitching-related upper extremity injuries. As we gain more knowledge about the influence of pitching kinematics on joint loading and injury risk, it is important to start exploring ways to modify pitching technique through instruction and feedback while considering the specific skill components to address, mode of instruction, target population, duration of program, and ways to effectively collaborate with coaches and parents...|$|R
40|$|An accurate, precise, and {{convenient}} procedure {{was developed for}} measurement of the latency of the low-Km mannose- 6 -phosphatase activity {{for the purpose of}} assessment of the membrane permeability <b>barrier</b> <b>in</b> microsomes. <b>This</b> <b>approach</b> is based on previous work of Arion et al. [J. Biol. Chem. (1976) 251, 4901 - 4907] and consists of measurement of mannose- 6 -phosphatase activity in the untreated microsomal fraction and in the corresponding microsomes that are fully disrupted in order to eliminate the membrane permeability barrier. Complete disruption of rat liver microsomes was achieved by incubation for 60 min at 0 degree C in the presence of 4 mM zwitterionic detergent 3 -[(3 -cholamido-propyl) dimethyl-ammonio]- 2 -hydroxy- 1 -propane sulphonate (Chapso). That the microsomal membrane permeability barrier was eliminated under those conditions was suggested {{by the fact that the}} enzyme activation (up to 50 -fold) produced by this pretreatment was at least as large as the effect of any other previously reported disruptive procedure. Disruption of the microsomes by Chapso or by ultrasonication markedly enhanced the thermolability of the mannose- 6 -phosphatase activity. In addition, exposure of the microsomes to high concentrations of Chapso produced enzyme inactivation that could be partially reversed by dilution of the detergent prior to assaying the enzymic activity. Investigation of these enzyme inactivation phenomena under various incubation conditions for disruption of the microsomes by Chapso and for subsequent assay of mannose- 6 -phosphatase activity in the presence of Chapso enabled us to define conditions under which instability of the enzyme was undetectable. Using these optimized procedures for disruption of microsomes and assay of hexose- 6 -P phosphohydrolase, we found that the low-Km mannose- 6 -phosphatase activity of untreated rat liver microsomes consistently was less than 5 % of the total enzyme activity in the fully disrupted microsomes. Accurate and precise assay of the structural latency of mannose- 6 -phosphatase in membrane preparations must be performed under well-controlled conditions, with special attention to the marked thermolability of the enzyme in the presence of detergent, and is a prerequisite for using <b>this</b> <b>approach</b> for the purpose of assessing intactness of microsomal preparations. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{mammalian}} {{gastrointestinal tract}} {{is home to}} a complex microbial community engaged in a dynamic interaction with the immune system. Mucus is the first point of contact of the microbiota with the host, acting as a first line of defence. Furthermore γδ intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) respond to the invading bacteria that circumvent the mucus <b>barrier.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> study two <b>approaches</b> were used to investigate the role of mucus in intestinal homeostasis; firstly the impact of γδ IELs on the mucus layer, and secondly the adhesion properties of the gut symbiont Lactobacillus reuteri to mucus. To study the impact of IELs on mucus properties, a γδ T cell-deficient (TCRδ-/-) mouse model was used. TCRδ-/- mice showed increased susceptibility to dextran sodium sulphate (DSS) -induced colitis, alterations in mucin expression, glycosylation and goblet cell numbers, but maintained an intact mucus layer in vivo. Moreover, TCRδ-/- mice showed reduced levels of interleukin- 33 mRNA, a mediator of mucosal healing. An ex vivo SI organoid model using input cells from TCRδ-/- mice showed, upon addition of keratinocyte growth factor, increases in crypt length, and both goblet cell numbers and redistribution. These findings provide novel mechanisms by which γδ IELs may modulate mucus properties, explaining the increased susceptibility of TCRδ-/- mice to chemically-induced colitis. L. reuteri strains protect against DSS-induced colitis in mice. To investigate the importance of L. reuteri adhesion to the intestinal mucus layer, the mucus-producing HT 29 -MTX cell line as well as murine and human intestinal tissues were used in conjunction with chemical treatments. The mucus-binding protein MUB of L. reuteri ATCC 53608 was found to promote L. reuteri adhesion to mucins in a host and tissuespecific manner and display sialic acid-binding specificities. Together, these data provide insights into L. reuteri-mucus interactions; a key factor in influencing host response and exerting health effects...|$|R
