50|$|In 1893 {{he succeeded}} Waldemar Haffkine (1860-1930) as an {{instructor}} of microbiology at the Pasteur Institute, shortly afterwards being {{called to the}} Imperial Institute of Bacteriology of Constantinople, where he conducted research on pasteurellosis, rinderpest, <b>bovine</b> <b>piroplasmosis</b> and Aleppo button, et al. In Constantinople he also worked on improving methods for preparation of diphtheria toxin. In 1901, following disagreements with Turkish authorities and French representatives, he resigned his post at the bacteriological institute of Constantinople {{and returned to the}} Pasteur Institute.|$|E
40|$|A {{clinical}} outbreak of <b>bovine</b> <b>piroplasmosis</b> {{was reported in}} Italy. The etiological agent was characterized as Babesia occultans, a parasite regarded as apathogenic and never detected before in continental Europe. This report paves the way for further studies to assess the occurrence of this tick-transmitted protozoan in other European regions...|$|E
40|$|Members of the CCp protein {{family have}} been {{previously}} described {{to be expressed}} on gametocytes of apicomplexan Plasmodium parasites. Knocking out Plasmodium CCp genes blocks {{the development of the}} parasite in the mosquito vector, making the CCp proteins potential targets {{for the development of a}} transmission-blocking vaccine. Apicomplexans Babesia bovis and Babesia bigemina are the causative agents of bovine babesiosis, and apicomplexan Theileria equi causes equine <b>piroplasmosis.</b> <b>Bovine</b> babesiosis and equine piroplasmosis are the most economically important parasite diseases that affect worldwide cattle and equine industries, respectively. The recent sequencing of the B. bovis and T. equi genomes has provided the opportunity to identify novel genes involved in parasite biology. Here we characterize three members of the CCp family, named CCp 1, CCp 2 and CCp 3, in B. bigemina, B. bovis and T. equi. Using B. bigemina as an in vitro model, expression of all three CCp genes and proteins was demonstrated in temperature-induced sexual stages. Transcripts for all three CCp genes were found in vivo in blood stages of T. equi, and transcripts for CCp 3 were detected in vivo in blood stages of B. bovis. However, no protein expression was detected in T. equi blood stages or B. bovis blood stages or B. bovis tick stages. Collectively, the data demonstrated a differential pattern of expression of three orthologous genes of the multidomain adhesion CCp family by B. bigemina, B. bovis and T. equi. The novel CCp members represent potential target...|$|R
40|$|Histopathological {{investigation}} {{was made of}} eleven cases affected with parturient hemoglobinemia. 1) Anatomically the outstanding changes found were an anemia, icterus, and edema in general. The blood was watery and dark. Especially the liver had undergone the most extensive changes. The livers of all cases were brownish-yellow or orange-yellow in colour due to fatty infiltration, sometimes slightly swollen and usually showed multiple necrotic patches. The spleen was usually congested on section of the pulp bulges and presented dark red, hemorrhagic appearance. Moreover, cloudiness of kidney, right side dilatation of the heart with subendo- and subepicardial hemorrhages, congestive edema of the lung, and enlargement and edema of the lymphnodes were found. A general diffuse catarrhal inflammation of the small intestine was recognized, but no changes were noted in the abomasum. The urinary bladder was always filled with dark red urine caused by presence of hemoglobin. 2) Histologically the most characteristic changes were observed in the liver; namely, necrotic and necrobiotic foci in the central area of liver lobules. Fatty infiltration was general throughout the lobules in {{almost all of the}} cases and endothelial cells took fat independently. A parenchymatous degeneration, such as hyaline drop degeneration and vacuolar degeneration were conspicuous in the kidney, especially fatty infiltrations were remarkable in pars recta of HENLE'S loop and {{in some parts of the}} convoluted tubules. In some stages, hemosiderin deposits were noted in the epithelial cells of kidney. Some cases showed glomerulonephritis serosa acuta and most cases contained serous exudation in the cavity of BOWMAN'S capsule. The spleen of all cases was abundant in blood content and pulp showed high hemosiderosis. Sometimes, fibrinthrombi were recognized in the sinus of the spleen. Subendo- and subepicardial hemorrhages and congestion of the heart were recognized and especially proliferated histiocytes in the interstitium were conspicuous. Some cases showed cardiac myodegeneration, and fine granular fat deposits in the muscular fiber. Moreover, enteritis catarrhalis, lymphadenitis catarrhalis and edema were found. 3) It was concluded that the main changes of this disease are parenchymatous degeneration and secondly circulatory disturbances in addition to proliferative changes which accompanied with reactive changes in R. E. S. 4) The authors differentiated the disease of <b>piroplasmosis,</b> <b>bovine</b> hematuria (Stallrot), bacillary hemoglobinuria, leptospirosis, bacillary pyelonephritis and puerperal sepsis from parturient hemoglobinemia. 5) It is considered that some relationship exists between milk fever, ketosis, aphosphorosis and parturient hemoglobinemia. 6) This disease is considered to be a sort which is produced by disturbances of metabolism...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} on {{the invasion}} of <b>bovine</b> <b>piroplasmosis</b> in Kamisaibara village, {{the northern part of}} Okayama prefecture, where about 600 of Japanese breed black cattle were pastured on. As the result of the blood examinations on 285 cattle {{it was found that the}} disease prevailed heavily in these areas as shown in tables; namely the numbers of cattle which were detected the minor piroplasma (which seemed to be Thieleria mutans) in thire red blood cells came up to as much as 97. 9 per cent, and those associated with the major piroplasma (which was morphologically similar to Babesia bigemina,) were 6. 0 per cent. (Table I. & II.) A tendency was shown that the younger the cattle, the more severely was infected with this disease. (Table III.) Being almost of the cattle, in spite of infection with numerous piroplasms, survived without any manifestation such as "Texas fever'", the bad influences of this disease to cattle have never been recognized, but to leave out the condition is to be regarded as highly dangerous for profitable livestock production in this district...|$|E
40|$|Background]: The {{prevalence}} of bovine babesiosis caused by Babesia divergens {{has been declining}} during the past decades in northeastern Hungary, and no cases have been observed since 2008. Infections of cattle with B. major and Theileria buffeli were hitherto reported in southern and western Europe. In {{other parts of the}} globe, there is evidence of emergence and a growing clinical importance of T. buffeli and closely related genotypes of the T. orientalis complex. [Findings]: In a herd of 88 beef cattle kept in northeastern Hungary, <b>bovine</b> <b>piroplasmosis</b> was diagnosed in nine animals through the examination of blood smears or by molecular methods. B. major was identified in five animals, two of which died. In addition, four cattle harboured T. buffeli, and one of these animals was anaemic. Despite their presence, a contributory role of Anaplasma marginale and A. phagocytophilum could not be established in the disease cases. [Conclusions]: In this study B. major and bovine theileriosis is reported {{for the first time in}} central-eastern Europe, where clinical cases were associated with a mild winter. This study was partially funded by EU grant FP 7 - 261504 EDENext and is catalogued by the EDENext Steering Committee as EDENext 258. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Background: Increasing {{numbers of}} genetic {{variants}} are being recognized among piroplasms, but the precise taxonomical status, the tick vector and the geographical range of several species or genotypes are still unknown. <b>Bovine</b> <b>piroplasmosis</b> {{was reported to}} re-emerge in north-east Hungary. Because Theileria-infection was newly diagnosed in one cattle herd in the same region of the country, {{the aim of this}} study was to molecularly identify the relevant agent, to find its local vector tick species, and to examine the range of Babesia/Theileria spp. of ruminants in Haemaphysalis sp. ticks collected previously in Hungary. Findings: Blood samples were drawn on two occasions from 90 dairy cattle in northern Hungary, and ticks were collected on their pastures. In addition, questing ticks (315 Haemaphysalis inermis, 259 H. concinna and 22 H. punctata), which originated mainly in the same region of the country from 2007, were included in the study. DNA was extracted from these samples, followed by molecular analysis for piroplasms. In the cattle Theileria orientalis was identified, with 100 % sequence homology to isolates from Japan, China, South-Africa and Australia. Based on GenBank data this genotype has not been previously reported in Europe. The prevalence of infection in the herd remained almost constant in the main tick season, suggesting exposure in previous years.

40|$|AbstractIn this {{preliminary}} study, a novel DNA microarray system was {{tested for the}} diagnosis of <b>bovine</b> <b>piroplasmosis</b> and anaplasmosis in comparison with microscopy and PCR assay results. In the Dakahlia Governorate, Egypt, 164 cattle were investigated {{for the presence of}} piroplasms and Anaplasma species. All investigated cattle were clinically examined. Blood samples were screened for the presence of blood parasites using microscopy and PCR assays. Seventy-one animals were acutely ill, whereas 93 were apparently healthy. In acutely ill cattle, Babesia/Theileria species (n= 11) and Anaplasma marginale (n= 10) were detected. Mixed infections with Babesia/Theileria spp. and A. marginale were present in two further cases. A. marginale infections were also detected in apparently healthy subjects (n= 23). The results of PCR assays were confirmed by DNA sequencing. All samples that were positive by PCR for Babesia/Theileria spp. gave also positive results in the microarray analysis. The microarray chips identified Babesia bovis (n= 12) and Babesia bigemina (n= 2). Cattle with babesiosis were likely to have hemoglobinuria and nervous signs when compared to those with anaplasmosis that frequently had bloody feces. We conclude that clinical examination in combination with microscopy are still very useful in diagnosing acute cases of babesiosis and anaplasmosis, but a combination of molecular biological diagnostic assays will detect even asymptomatic carriers. In perspective, parallel detection of Babesia/Theileria spp. and A. marginale infections using a single microarray system will be a valuable improvement...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND Increasing {{numbers of}} genetic {{variants}} are being recognized among piroplasms, but the precise taxonomical status, the tick vector and the geographical range of several species or genotypes are still unknown. <b>Bovine</b> <b>piroplasmosis</b> {{was reported to}} re-emerge in north-east Hungary.

FINDINGS Blood samples were drawn on two occasions from 90 dairy cattle in northern Hungary, and ticks were collected on their pastures. In addition, questing ticks (315 Haemaphysalis inermis, 259 [*]H. concinna and 22 [*]H. punctata), which originated mainly in the same region of the country from 2007, were included in the study. DNA was extracted from these samples, followed by molecular analysis for piroplasms. In the cattle Theileria orientalis was identified, with 100 % sequence homology to isolates from Japan, China, South-Africa and Australia. Based on GenBank data this genotype has not been previously reported in Europe. The prevalence of infection in the herd remained almost constant in the main tick season, suggesting exposure in previous years. Retrospective analysis of ticks revealed the presence of Babesia crassa in H. inermis, for the first time in Europe and in this tick species. On the other hand, H. concinna carried five different piroplasms, including B. motasi that was also newly detected in Central-Eastern Europe and in this tick species; whereas H. punctata harboured Theileria sp. OT 3, hitherto known to occur in the Mediterranean region. CONCLUSIONS Results of this study broaden the range of piroplasms that are infective for ruminants in Central-Eastern Europe. Although bovine babesiosis and theileriosis was known to occur in Hungary, molecular evidence is provided here for the first time on the presence of Babesia and/or Theileria spp. of sheep, goats and cervids in Hungary...|$|E
40|$|De Kock and Quinlan {{published}} {{the results of}} their first series of experiments on splenectomised horses, cattle, sheep, and goats in 1926. Since then observations have been continued and extended to other species of domesticated animals as well as to wild antelopes. The results of the later splenectomies have been published mostly as isolated papers in various subsequent Reports of the Director of Veterinary Services. (De Kock and Quinlan, 1927; de Kock, 1929; du Toit, 1931; Neitz and du Toit, 1932.) HORSES. Of the four horses splenectomised three were immune ''carriers'' of Nuttallia equi and all three showed fatal relapses of Nuttalliosis in from 3 to 8 days after the operation. The fourth animal was a young foal, not a carrier of Nuttalliosis. It was kept under tick-free conditions for four months following the operation when it was killed by injections of haemolytic serum. CATTLE. Five animals were observed by de Kock and Quinlan (1926 report) and their findings may be summarised briefly as follows: (1) Relapses of Theileriosis (Theileria mutans), anaplasmosis, and piroplasmosis (P. bigeminum) occurred in immune "carriers" of these parasites. Piroplasmosis relapses were in these cases particularly severe. (2) These diseases in splenectomised animals assumed a chronic course particularly with regard to the blood changes. A total of 23 bovines were splenectomised of which 20 recovered from the operation. One animal died three days afterwards, and on post mortem no apparent cause of death could be established; one {{died as a result of}} haemorrhage and one from surgical shock. Some of the animals were used in East Coast fever transmission experiments and two animals which had recovered from East Coast fever were splenectomised in order to try and break down their immunity (du Toit, 1931). Removal of the spleen was found to have no effect on the course of this disease or on the immunity. Two bovines were splenectomised for further study of the blood changes in anaplasmosis. One animal, No. 4627, infected with the mild A. centrale strain, reacted so severely after splenectomy that it died as the result of the extensive blood changes. Two calves, Nos. 4658 and 4676, susceptible to anaplasmosis and piroplasmosis, were injected with blood from sheep showing Anaplasma ovis and then splenectomised to see whether the Anaplasma ovis would appear in the calves' blood, or whether the calves could become "carriers" of the disease. After the operation, however, both animals became accidentally infected with <b>bovine</b> <b>piroplasmosis</b> and anaplasmosis and sheep sub-inoculated from them showed no reaction. SHEEP. Fifty-four sheep have been splenectomised of which seven died as the direct result of the operation. In one of the latter, namely No. 8462, the attachments of the spleen were loosened and the splenic vessels ligated, but the organ itself left in situ. The most striking result of de Rock and Quinlan's observations on sheep was the discovery of the hitherto unsuspected presence of an anaplasma, A. ovis, and a Theileria, T. recondita (called Gonderia ovis by them) present in the blood of some South African sheep. Anaplasmosis of Sheep. The result of their observations can be briefly summarised as follows: (1) Non-splenectomised susceptible sheep can be infected by means of blood inoculation. The disease then runs a mild course with distinct anaemic changes and the appearance of parasites in the blood in large numbers, but no mortality. (2) In splenectomised "carriers" and splenectomised susceptible sheep the course is much more severe and protracted and there is a fairly high mortality. (3) The disease could not be transmitted to splenectomised or non-splenectomised bovines nor did these animals become carriers of the parasites. (4) Non-splenectomised goats could not be infected but in splenectomised goats parasites appeared in the blood with very slight anaemic changes, and such animals became carriers of the disease. Sheep, splenectomised and non-splenectomised, did not react to bovine anaplasmosis nor did they become carriers of the parasites. Theileriosis of Sheep. De Rock and Quinlan (1927) reported on the occurrence of Theileria (T. recondita, Gonderia ovis) in the blood of some splenectomised sheep. Transmission to non-splenectomised sheep and to bovines failed. The parasites did not produce any symptoms and appeared to be quite harmless. Histological Changes. De Rock (1929) reported on the appearance of haemo-lymphoid-like nodules in the liver of sheep, bovines and a goat killed three years after splenectomy. The nodules varied in size from ¼ in. to 1 ½ in. in diameter, were dark red in colour, and circumscribed. In some instances a distinct capsule could be recognised, and in others there was no demarcation between this foreign tissue and the liver substance. Lymphoid nodules could be recognised in some of these structures. The haemo-lymphoid-like nodules were not seen in the animals which died or were killed within the first two years following splenectomy. The first indications being found in a sheep which died 33 months after the spleen was removed. From the microscopic appearances de Kock concludes that this newly formed tissue resembles most closely that of haemolymph glands. GOATS. Before splenectomy the two animals were injected with blood from sheep showing anaplasma but no reaction followed nor could anaplasma be demonstrated. Splenectomy failed to produce a relapse as in the case of immune carriers. Subsequent to the operation, however, when reinjected the blood showed the presence of anaplasma with practically no anaemic changes. The histological changes which were found at autopsy on the one goat which died 8 ½ years later have been mentioned above. CANINES. Seven dogs were successfully splenectomised. One animal showed the presence of microfilaria in the blood three days later and continued to show these parasites until it died from other causes. In no case did piroplasma appear in the blood as the result of removal of the spleen. However, it was only assumed that the animals were carriers of Piroplasma canis as they had been exposed to tick infestation, but there can be no certainty with regard to this. Subsequently three of these dogs were injected with blood from a known carrier of the disease. One of them died from piroplasmosis and two recovered after treatment, but continued to show parasites for several weeks afterwards. Owing to the uncertainty with regard to the previous immunity it is not possible to draw definite conclusions on the effect of the removal of the spleen on canine piroplasmosis. The disease, however, appeared to affect the splenectomised dogs more severely than is experienced in clinical cases of the disease in normal dogs. One of the animals showed a severe haemoglobinuria. Miessner (1931) reports on a few cases of relapses of piroplasmosis following splenectomy in dogs. The experiment will be repeated with known carriers of Piroplasma canis. Four dogs were injected with the virus of African horsesickness after splenectomy but did not show any reaction to the disease. PORCINES. Four pigs were splenectomised and all made uneventful recoveries. No parasites appeared in the blood following the operation. Attempts were made to infect the splenectomised pigs with African horsesickness (two cases) and with ovine blue tongue (two cases) without success. ANTELOPES. Neitz and du Toit (1932) reported on a method of obtaining pure strains of Anaplasma marginale and centrale by transmission through antelopes. The antelopes were injected with blood from bovine carriers of Piroplasma bigeminum, Theileria mutans, and either Anaplasma marginale or A. centrale. In each case only the anaplasma appeared in the blood. These antelopes were then splenectomised in order to exclude the possibility of the other parasites from the donor's blood being present in a latent form. In the cases of the two that survived the operation only the anaplasma reappeared in the blood after splenectomy. Three blesbuck (Damaliscus albifrons) and one grey duiker (Sylvicapra grimmi grimmi L.) were operated on. One blesbuck died soon after the operation and the other two recovered. The duiker seemed to recover completely but interfered with the wound on the eighth day and died as a result. One of the blesbuck, No. 33606, was later injected with the virus of ovine blue tongue and although it showed no reaction it was found to be a carrier on subinoculation of susceptible sheep. Spirochaeta theileri could also be transmitted to the blesbuck. Heartwater. Finally the animal was injected with heartwater from a sheep and died 23 days later of this disease. Rickettsia could be demonstrated and susceptible sheep were infected from it.
