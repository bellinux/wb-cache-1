5000|$|In 1995, Aveda {{partnered with}} a {{community}} collective that the <b>babassu</b> nut breakers of the Brazilian Amazon had formed to obtain certified organic <b>babassu</b> {{for use in}} the creation of a foaming cleansing element known as [...] "babassu betaine". Aveda has financed the construction of and training for a <b>babassu</b> processing facility, a soap-making facility and a paper press for processing <b>babassu</b> fibers. Aveda does not test their products on animals, but rather on willing human participants.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Babassu</b> oil or cusi oil {{is a clear}} {{light yellow}} {{vegetable}} oil extracted from {{the seeds of the}} <b>babassu</b> palm (Attalea speciosa), which grows in the Amazon region of South America. It is a non-drying oil used in food, cleaners and skin products. This oil has properties similar to coconut oil and is used in much the same context. It is increasingly being used as a substitute for coconut oil. <b>Babassu</b> oil is about 70% lipids, in the following proportions: ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Babassu</b> oil {{can also}} be used in food cooking, as a {{lubricant}} and also in soap and cosmetics. The shell of the nut {{can be used to make}} smoke-less charcoal and flesh of the <b>babassu</b> nut to produce flour. Palm hearts are extracted from the tree for to make a juice that used as medicine for its antiseptic and styptic properties. The leaf and stalk of the <b>babassu</b> palm is used in building materials. Baskets and other handicrafts can be made from the fibre of the leaves.|$|E
5000|$|In February 2008, <b>babassu</b> {{palm oil}} {{was used in}} a blend with coconut oil and jet fuel to power one engine of a Virgin Atlantic Boeing 747 during a flight test. [...] It is {{considered}} to be less environmentally friendly than biofuel made from the Jatropha plant that Air New Zealand tested in December 2008. This is because <b>Babassu</b> grows in forested areas that require deforestation, rather than in arid land and land with marginal use, like the Jatropha plant.|$|E
5000|$|During February 2008, {{a mixture}} of <b>babassu</b> oil and coconut oil was used to {{partially}} power one engine of a Boeing 747, in a biofuel trial sponsored by Virgin Atlantic Airways.|$|E
50|$|This {{plant has}} {{commercial}} value because its seeds produce an edible oil called <b>babassu</b> oil, {{which is also}} used in cleaners and skin care products. The fruit is used to produce products such as medicines, beauty aids, and beverages. Traditional communities of the Maranhão region also produce a flour from the fruit and this is commercialized as a nutritional supplement. The leaves are also used to provide thatch for houses and can be woven into mats for constructing house walls. The stems are used for timbers. The <b>Babassu</b> palm is considered a weed in pasture areas of Cerrado vegetation in Brazil.|$|E
50|$|The {{first route}} {{involves}} using oil which is extracted from plant sources like Jatropha, algae, tallows, other waste oils, <b>Babassu</b> and Camelina to produce bio-SPK (Bio derived synthetic paraffinic Kerosene) by cracking and hydroprocessing.|$|E
5000|$|Virgin Atlantic {{successfully}} {{tested a}} biofuel blend consisting of 20 percent <b>babassu</b> nuts and coconut and 80 percent conventional jet fuel, which was fed {{to a single}} engine on a 747 flight from London Heathrow to Amsterdam Schiphol.|$|E
50|$|The Caatinga has dry {{soils and}} its {{vegetation}} is formed by palm trees, such as buriti, oiticica, <b>babassu</b> and carnauba. Much of its northeastern part suffers {{a high risk}} of desertification due to the degradation of vegetation cover and soil.|$|E
50|$|A 2015 study {{reported}} that after 22 years {{the families of the}} reserve still lived outside it in surrounding communities.The result had been constant competition for resources and disputes with farmers, and steady clearance of the <b>babassu</b> to expand pasturage for livestock.|$|E
5000|$|Lauric and {{myristic}} acids have melting points relatively {{close to}} human body temperature, so <b>babassu</b> oil {{can be applied}} to the skin as a solid that melts on contact. This heat transfer can produce a cooling sensation. It is an effective emollient.|$|E
50|$|According to IBGE, in 2003 the {{gathering}} sector's output {{was divided into}} timber (65%) and non-wood (35%), at a value of four hundred forty-nine million Reals, with the following main products: piassaba (27%), <b>babassu</b> (nut - 17%), açai (16%), yerba mate (14%), carnauba (8%) and Brazil nut (5%).|$|E
50|$|Brazilians ("Indians") began farming some 12,000 years ago. They farmed cassava, peanuts, tobacco, sweet {{potatoes}} and maize, in addition to extracting the essence from other local plants such as the pequi and the <b>babassu.</b> Production was for food, straw or madeira. They cultivated local fruits such as jabuticaba, cashews, Spondias mombin and Goiabas.|$|E
50|$|Due to the region's great {{variation}} {{in the amount of}} rainfall, agriculture is characterized by a very poor, limited to the cultivation of rice, in Maranhão and the raising of cattle, in Piauí, in areas of cerrado. Due to its climate, vegetation has a typical, composed of <b>babassu</b> and coconut palms of the carnauba (Forest of Cocais).|$|E
50|$|Maranhão is {{also known}} as the land of the palm trees, as the various species of this tree provide its major source of income. The most {{important}} of them, from an economic point of view, is the <b>babassu.</b> The agribusiness, the aluminium and alumina transformation industries, and the food and timber industries complement the state economy.|$|E
50|$|Metallurgical Industries {{and intense}} {{livestock}} activity, {{accounted for a}} large environmental devastation in the region. The activity of the steel industry requires large amounts of coal, leading to a devastation of native forests. As a result of public pressure the industries were forced to change its production model, investing in reforestation and charcoal production through the <b>babassu</b> coconut palm.|$|E
50|$|Rock {{crystals}} {{are present}} in the soil of the rich cerrado, or open pasture. Forest growth is also still found in the region, where more than 25 species of orchids can be found, besides other Brazilian species such as pau d'arco roxo, copaíba (copa tree), aroeira (California pepper tree), tamanqueira (cork tree), terivá (a variety of palm tree), buritis (wine-palm) and Babaçu (<b>Babassu).</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{vegetation}} is in {{the transition}} between the Amazon and Cerrado biomes, and includes coastal marine influence, covering a large area of lacustrine basins.The soil is clay, with high water retention.During the rainy season from December to July the low fields are flooded, leaving islands of terra firma.Vegetation includes mangroves, <b>babassu,</b> riverine forests, Amazon rainforest remants, lowland meadows and flooded meadows.|$|E
50|$|As of 2009 the {{population}} of the reserve was fairly young. About 25% of {{the population}} is illiterate and 32% have no more than three years of education, mostly women. About 30% of girls do not attend school but help the family in production activities.The reserve is served by health centres in the Carrasco Bonito municipal seat.The main economic activity is processing and marketing of <b>babassu</b> palm fruit, mainly by the women. The men cultivate rice, beans, maize and cassava, mainly for their family consumption.|$|E
50|$|Little {{is known}} about its habitat preference, but {{it appears to be}} {{associated}} with bamboo (specifically Guadua paniculata) growing in Cerrado and <b>babassu</b> palm forest; very unlike the humid forest and woodland where the related rufous-headed woodpecker is found. There is no evidence to suggest that it occurs in Caatinga. Rather, the authors who proposed the common name Caatinga woodpecker and association it with the caatinga habitat mistook a place in the caatinga called Uruçuí-Una for the type locality Uruçuí, some 180 km. NNW in cerrado habitat.|$|E
50|$|People use many {{plant species}} from the Caatinga region. Palms are very {{important}} to the economy in northeast Brazil. People from this area are greatly dependent on extraction from <b>babassu,</b> carnaúba, tucúm and macaúba, from which lauric and oleic oils are made from. Many trees are also used for lumber in this area, including these species: Anadenanthera macrocarpa, Ziziphus joazeiro, Amburana cearensis, Astronium fraxinifolium, Astronium urundeuva, Handroanthus impetiginosus, Tabebuia caraiba, and Schinopsis brasiliensis, Cedrela odorata, Dalbergia variabilis, Didymopanax morototoni and Pithecellobium polycephalum. Some plants are also used for medical purposes.|$|E
50|$|The reserve {{contains}} the traditional communities of Chapada Limpa I, Chapada Limpa II, Califórnia, Juçaral, Mata, Morada Nova, Porco Magro, Prata, Quatro Bocas, Roça Velha, Saco, Santana, São Gabriel, São Martins and Severo.In 2016 the Ministry of the Environment {{said there were}} 116 registered families with 531 people organized into five neighbourhood associations.The population density was 4.43 inhabitants per km².Residents in the lower parts of the reserve extract <b>babassu</b> for income, and use the juçara, buriti and bacaba palms typical of the wetland environment for family use.They also practice subsistence agriculture, growing rice, beans and corn.|$|E
50|$|José Mentor Guilherme de Mello (Brejo, Maranhão, September 18, 1880 - São Luís, Maranhão, September 15, 1928) was {{a colonel}} of the Brazil´s National Guard, an {{entrepreneur}} in the waterway transport business and an exporter. Son of Laureano Guilherme de Mello and Isabel Gomes de Oliveira Mello, with roots in traditional families of Ceará and Rio Grande do Norte, particularly of Mossoró, {{he worked in}} the boom of the Amazonia rubber extraction business, and later became a prominent exportation entrepreneur of plant leaves, of carnauba wax and of <b>babassu</b> and cotton seeds, and simultaneously an waterway transport businessman, in the Brazilian states of Piauí and Maranhão.|$|E
5000|$|In addition, {{there are}} also several tests done {{combining}} regular petrofuels with a biofuel. For example, {{as part of this}} test Virgin Atlantic Airways flew a Boeing 747 from London Heathrow Airport to Amsterdam Schiphol Airport on 24 February 2008, with one engine burning a combination of coconut oil and <b>babassu</b> oil. Greenpeace's chief scientist Doug Parr said that the flight was [...] "high-altitude greenwash" [...] and that producing organic oils to make biofuel could lead to deforestation and a large increase in greenhouse gas emissions. Also, the majority of the world's aircraft are not large jetliners but smaller piston aircraft, and with major modifications many are capable of using ethanol as a fuel. Another consideration is the vast amount of land that would be necessary to provide the biomass feedstock needed to support the needs of aviation, both civil and military.|$|E

Among these communities, <b>babassu</b> oil is used for cooking but also medically to treat skin wounds and inflammation, and vulvovaginitis. This study aimed to evaluate the anti-inflammatory activity of <b>babassu</b> oil and develop a microemulsion system with <b>babassu</b> oil for topical delivery. Topical anti-inflammatory activity was evaluated in mice ear edema using PMA, arachidonic acid, ethyl phenylpropiolate, phenol, and capsaicin as phlogistic agents.

40|$|<b>Babassu</b> palms (Orbignya spp.) cover nearly 200, 000 km 2 in Brazil, {{providing}} cash income, fuel, fibre, {{edible oil}} and food {{to a large}} number of tenant farm households. <b>Babassu</b> is closely integrated within pastoral and shifting cultivation systems of Mid-North Brazil. In pastures, <b>babassu</b> provides shade for cattle, aids soil moisture retention, produces organic matter, generates supplementary farm income at little cost, and offers year-round employment. On the other hand, the persistence of juvenile palms reduces pasture grass productivity due to plant competition, and therefore there is a trend to eradicate <b>babassu</b> through clearcutting and understorey suppression. At moderate densities of less than 100 individuals per ha, mature <b>babassu</b> palms in cropland do not appear to harm crop productivity. In such cases, palms are thinned and leaves of the remaining ones are cut back, supplying fuel for the burn and nutrients to the soil. However, reduced fallow cycles due to pasture conversion threaten <b>babassu</b> as well as crop productivity. 198...|$|E
