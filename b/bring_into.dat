5|$|On 23 November 2015, the {{government}} published its 2015 Strategic Defence and Security Review which confirmed {{its plans to}} <b>bring</b> <b>into</b> service both Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carriers, with one to be available at all times. The review also confirmed {{that one of the}} carriers would have enhanced amphibious capabilities. The government also reaffirmed its commitment to ordering 138 F-35 Lightning IIs, although the specific variant(s) was not mentioned. The review stated that 24 of these aircraft would be available to the aircraft carriers by 2023.|$|E
5|$|During post-production, as the {{producers}} {{decided to change}} the film into a more serious horror film, they filmed numerous scenes for that purpose without {{the participation of the}} director. Among those scenes is the entire prologue of the astronauts in space and West waking up in a hospital--these are the only scenes in which Rebar's face is seen without makeup. Additionally, the film was extensively re-edited by {{the producers}}. Sachs criticized the acting in those re-shot scenes, as well as the change of tone they <b>bring</b> <b>into</b> the film along with the re-editing by the producers.|$|E

5|$|In 1945, Glenn Seaborg, an American scientist, {{made the}} {{suggestion}} that the actinide elements, like the lanthanides, were filling an f sub-level. Before this time the actinides were thought to be forming a fourth d-block row. Seaborg's colleagues advised him not to publish such a radical suggestion as it would most likely ruin his career. As Seaborg considered he did not then have a career to <b>bring</b> <b>into</b> disrepute, he published anyway. Seaborg's suggestion was found to be correct and he subsequently {{went on to win the}} 1951 Nobel Prize in chemistry for his work in synthesizing actinide elements.|$|E
5|$|The West Indian's {{had begun}} to {{experience}} difficulties in {{the final years of}} the 1960s. The Indian defeat had come on the back of defeats away to Australia and England. Though they played well against Australia on the 1972–73 tour, they lost 2:1. In the Fourth Test in Guyana they fell to a 10-wicket defeat after being dismissed for 109 in their second innings. The utilisation of aggressive fast bowlers such as Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson had inspired West Indian captain to <b>bring</b> <b>into</b> his team men of similar virtues. In the 1976 Indian tour of the West Indies, the Queen's Park Oval hosted the Second and Third Tests. The West Indians played Andy Roberts and Michael Holding in both games, though India played well enough to draw the first and win the second of these fixtures. Their victory in the second involved a record 406-run fourth innings to chase the West Indies total down.|$|E
