5000|$|A merry-go-round train, often {{abbreviated}} to MGR, is a <b>block</b> <b>train</b> of hopper wagons which both loads and unloads its cargo while moving. In the United Kingdom, {{they are most}} commonly coal trains delivering to power stations.

5000|$|On 15 May 2001, {{in order}} to secure their future, the BLS and SBB agreed on a new task-sharing arrangement. This was largely {{implemented}} as part of the timetable changes made on 12 December 2004 when the BLS took over the running of the SBB's S-Bahn lines and with it, system responsibility for Bern's S-Bahn network, the second largest in the country. This was accompanied by the transfer of long-distance railway operations from the BLS to the SBB. Within the cargo sector the SBB assumed overall control for full-load traffic in Switzerland. Transit and <b>block</b> <b>train</b> traffic has been subject to competition since the signing of the 2001 agreement. The SBB became responsible for rail network management across Switzerland.|$|E
50|$|A unit train, {{also called}} a <b>block</b> <b>train</b> or a trainload service, is a train {{in which all}} cars (wagons) carry the same {{commodity}} and are shipped from the same origin to the same destination, without being split up or stored en route. This saves time and money, {{as well as the}} hassle, delays and confusion associated with assembling and disassembling trains at rail yards near the origin and destination. It also enables railways to compete more effectively with road and internal waterway transport systems, However, unit trains are economical only for high-volume customers. Since unit trains often carry only one commodity, cars are of all the same type, and sometimes the cars are all identical apart from possible variations in livery.|$|E

50|$|Restart after a {{shutdown}} {{required the}} assistance of the parks' maintenance staff. One person would go to the manual brake release under the C brake while the other ran the control panel brake in the house. One train would be taken {{to the top of the}} lift and stopped. The second train would be stopped at the C brake before the second inverted loop. The third train would be in the house. To start the process, the C brake was pulled to release the train for the second loop. The lift train would be released as soon as the C <b>block</b> <b>train</b> was clear of the brake. Once the lift train cleared the house train was released. This was done several times during the first year of operation until the ride was reduced to two trains.|$|E

30|$|Rail in Europe {{is faced}} with universally available, {{aggressive}} and highly competent road freight services for domestic and international traffic over relatively short distance sectors across the entire commodity spectrum and it dominates the inter-urban freight market. As a consequence rail has lost share in the higher value, time sensitive flows (which are governed by imperatives the rail sector has had difficulty accommodating) that have emerged {{and as a consequence}} tended to focus on the less demanding <b>block</b> <b>train</b> model for inter-modal and bulk commodity flows. Clausen and Voll [4]) appear to have overlooked the complex mass of technical, operational, managerial and governance issues that have led to the present position and appear to be favouring a position where benefits will only flow from the adoption of North American systems.|$|E

25|$|The box-cab E class {{locomotives}} {{continued in}} service. However, during the 1970s, Victorian Railways conducted detailed studies of goods traffic {{and found that}} handling costs made the transport of high rated, small freight items unprofitable. As {{a result of these}} studies, rail freight operations were rationalised around <b>block</b> <b>trains</b> carrying bulk freight such as gravel, rice or grain, and suburban goods sidings were closed in favour of road freight service. Furthermore, the use of <b>block</b> <b>trains</b> greatly reduced the need for shunting locomotives. These operational changes rendered the ageing E class suburban electric locomotives surplus, and by 1981 scrappings had commenced. The last was withdrawn from service in 1984.|$|R
40|$|In new moving block railway control systems, the RAMS (Reliability, Availability, Maintainability, and Safety of {{the system}} mainly {{is based on the}} Dependability of two {{subsystems}} as the onboard positioning system and the communication system between the trains and the control centre. Communication Based Train Control system (CBTC) in USA, Transmission Based Train Control System (TBS) in UK and their other equivalent systems around the world need to provide the necessary amount of RAMS in these two subsystems before they can make their moving <b>block</b> <b>train</b> control system functional. Applying multisensor fusion algorithms in the vehicle navigation field has made it possible to make inexpensive and accurate positioning systems which will satisfy the railways moving block control system requirements. Considering the shortcoming of the exist train positioning systems, this paper introduces a new train navigation system using multisensor fusion techniques. GPS, Gyroscope, Doppler radar, odometers are from the sources of navigation data to the integration processor. The system is well prepared for integration to the digital maps of the railroad lines in future. In this paper the performance {{of the system}} is introduced using both the simulated data and real data, collected from the Sheffield supertram line.

40|$|This paper investigates how far a {{very deep}} neural network is from {{attaining}} close to saturating performance on existing 2 D and 3 D face alignment datasets. To this end, we make the following 5 contributions: (a) we construct, for the first time, a very strong baseline by combining a state-of-the-art architecture for landmark localization with a state-of-the-art residual <b>block,</b> <b>train</b> it on a very large yet synthetically expanded 2 D facial landmark dataset and finally evaluate it on all other 2 D facial landmark datasets. (b) We create a guided by 2 D landmarks network which converts 2 D landmark annotations to 3 D and unifies all existing datasets, leading {{to the creation of}} LS 3 D-W, the largest and most challenging 3 D facial landmark dataset to date (~ 230, 000 images). (c) Following that, we train a neural network for 3 D face alignment and evaluate it on the newly introduced LS 3 D-W. (d) We further look into the effect of all “traditional” factors affecting face alignment performance like large pose, initialization and resolution, and introduce a “new” one, namely the size of the network. (e) We show that both 2 D and 3 D face alignment networks achieve performance of remarkable accuracy which is probably close to saturating the datasets used.

40|$|The Author {{explained}} {{the concept of}} costs of logistics system and distinguished principal components of these costs. The mathematical model enabling calculation of total costs of logistics system was given as well. Afterwards the model was modified in purpose to meet requirements of multimodal logistics system. The new model allowed to make costs analysis of exemplary multimodal system and allowed to make choice of economically most effective technology of multimodal transport. There was proven that the most effective is <b>block</b> <b>train</b> operating on daily basis. Afterwards the calculations were done to explain the influence {{on the model of}} such parameters as: the value of cargo, the system’s safety level, the annual cargo turnover and the cost of storage. The calculations proved that costs of multimodal logistics system are the most sensitive to changes of the annual cargo turnover. The mutual relationship describes a decreasing function, that is an increase of the cargo turnover effects in a decrease of the costs of multimodal logistics system. The minimal level of these costs determines the sum of the costs of transport including stuffing the cargo and renting of a container. The analysis of sensitiveness of the model to changes of the value of cargo, the system’s safety level and the cost of storage proved moderate relationship described by increasing function. More sensitive reactions of the model can be expected in case of lengthening of the multimodal transport. Finally, the paper includes the Author’s conclusions relating to European logistics systems.

40|$|Intermodal rail/road freight {{transport}} {{has always been}} considered as a competitive alternative to its road freight counterpart in the European medium- to long-distance corridors (markets). Such consideration {{has been based on}} the increasing competitiveness of some innovative rail services and the existing and prospective performance of both modes in terms of the full social - internal or operational and external - costs. The most recent innovation of rail technologies and related services launched by some European railway companies, still at the conceptual level, is the Long Intermodal Freight Train (LIFT). This {{is supposed to be a}} <b>block</b> <b>train</b> operating in long-distance corridors (markets) with a substantial and regular freight demand. This paper develops analytical models for assessing the performance of the LIFTs, the already-operating Conventional Intermodal Freight Trains (CIFTs), and their road counterpart as well. The performance consists of the full - internal (private) and external - costs of the door-to-door delivery of loading units - containers, swap-bodies, and semi-trailers. The internal costs embrace the operational costs of the transport (rail and road) and intermodal terminal operators. The external costs include the costs of the impacts of door-to-door delivery of loading units on society and the environment. These negative externalities include noise, air pollution, traffic accidents, and congestion. The models are applied to a simplified version of intermodal and road transport system using inputs from the European {{freight transport}} sector. The aims are to compare the full costs of particular modalities in order to investigate the potential of the LIFTs as compared with the CIFTs in improving the internal efficiency of the rail freight sector and its competitiveness with respect to its road counterpart. In addition, the paper attempts to assess some effects on the potential modal shift of EU (European Union) transport policies on internalizing transport externalities.
