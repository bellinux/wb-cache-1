40|$|There {{are several}} {{versions}} of permutation pattern avoidance that have arisen in the literature, and some known examples {{of two different}} types of pattern avoidance coinciding. In this paper, we examine <b>barred</b> <b>patterns</b> and vincular patterns. Answering a question of Steingrimsson, we determine when <b>barred</b> <b>pattern</b> avoidance coincides with avoiding a finite set of vincular patterns, and when vincular pattern avoidance coincides with avoiding a finite set of <b>barred</b> <b>patterns.</b> There are 720 <b>barred</b> <b>patterns</b> with this property, each having between 3 and 7 letters, of which at most 2 are barred, and there are 48 vincular patterns with this property, each having between 2 and 4 letters and exactly one bond...|$|R
50|$|The B0 allele only {{carries the}} two non-coding {{mutations}} and it’s {{contribution to the}} <b>barring</b> <b>pattern</b> remained unknown as it only occurred in breeds that also carry the Dominant white mutation which is masking the effect at the B locus.). Recently scientists have removed the Dominant white mutation from chickens of those lines {{and were able to}} show that those chickens show a very light <b>barring</b> <b>pattern.</b> They named the phenotype ‘Sex-linked Extreme Dilution’. As chickens with the B0 allele show the weakest <b>barring</b> <b>pattern</b> compared to those that have the coding mutation in addition, the scientists propose an evolutionary scenario in which the non-coding mutations occurred first and the two missense mutations later in time and independently. As only the combination of both non-coding and missense mutations give the desired and pronounced <b>barring</b> <b>pattern,</b> B0 alone is not present in modern Sex-linked barred breeds anymore.|$|R

2500|$|Another {{generalization}} {{is that of}} a <b>barred</b> <b>pattern,</b> {{in which}} some of the entries are barred. [...] For π to avoid the <b>barred</b> <b>pattern</b> β means that every set of entries of π which form a copy of the nonbarred entries of β can be extended to form a copy of all entries of β. [...] introduced these types of patterns in his study of permutations which could be sorted by passing them twice through a stack. [...] (Note that West's definition of sorting twice through a stack {{is not the same as}} sorting with two stacks in series.) [...] Another example of <b>barred</b> <b>patterns</b> occurs in the work of , who showed that the Schubert variety corresponding to π is locally factorial if and only if π avoids 1324 and 21354.|$|R
50|$|An {{experienced}} {{price action}} trader {{will be well}} trained at spotting multiple <b>bars,</b> <b>patterns,</b> formations and setups during real-time market observation. The trader will have a subjective opinion {{on the strength of}} each of these and how strong a setup they can build them into. A simple setup on its own is rarely enough to signal a trade. There should be several favourable <b>bars,</b> <b>patterns,</b> formations and setups in combination, along with a clear absence of opposing signals.|$|R
50|$|This article {{attempts}} to outline most major candlestick <b>bars,</b> <b>patterns,</b> chart formations, behavioural observations and trade setups {{that are used}} in price action trading. It covers the way that they are interpreted by price action traders, whether they signal likely future market direction, and how the trader would place orders correspondingly to profit from that (and where protective exit orders would be placed to minimise losses when wrong). Since price action traders combine <b>bars,</b> <b>patterns,</b> formations, behaviours and setups together with other <b>bars,</b> <b>patterns,</b> formations etc. to create further setups, many of the descriptions here will refer to other descriptions in the article. The layout of descriptions here is linear, but there is no one perfect sequence - they appear here loosely in the sequence: behavioural observations, trends, reversals and trading ranges. This editing approach reflects the nature of price action, sub-optimal as it might appear.|$|R

Although hidden from view, a notable feature is the {{proprietary}} reinforcement used throughout the structure.

It was an era of intense competition among reinforcing bar manufacturers with each individual deformed <b>bar</b> <b>pattern</b> carefully protected by patents. Smooth bars of approximately 1/4 in diameter were employed for stirrups throughout the bridge structure.|$|E
50|$|During {{the late}} 19th and early 20th centuries, when the hambo was introduced, the eight <b>bar</b> <b>pattern</b> with the slower dalsteg and faster turns was carried {{back to the}} Swedish country villages where it {{influenced}} and in turn {{was influenced by the}} pre-existing, older polska dances. Consequently, scores of variations were created, some of which are still known and danced today thanks to the research of folklorists. Apart from such historical versions, differences exist in versions danced widely today—for example, the version danced in the Swedish Hälsingehambo competition tends to be slow and elegant with a relatively strong svikt (dip and lift) while that danced in American contradance venues is much faster with little svikt.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the album}} the band {{continues}} to use conventional rock instruments in songs that are structured unconventionally, {{as they did}} in their earlier releases.

5000|$|The {{movement}} is in sonata form without a development and is characterised by its manipulation of modal expectations. It {{opens with a}} seven- bar C minor Introduction of soft chords in the strings, grouped into a 3+3+1 <b>bar</b> <b>pattern</b> which contrasts with the clear 4+4 grouping of the main theme's funeral march. The march tread of the {{movement is}} suggested beginning at bar 8 {{by a series of}} throbbing chords on beats two and four, pulsing in the string and drum accompaniment under the grave winds and brass melody. An unexpected welling of emotion is heard just before the March section closes at rehearsal 70, followed by a transitory passage featuring a [...] "sigh" [...] motive (rehearsal 70) in the woodwinds. This transition modulates to the second theme in F minor opens with a lyrical but subdued string episode at 71. Then, as if Elgar had lost his sense of restraint, we hear a build-up of dynamic, an increase in tempo, and more imaginative scoring leading to a triumphant F major climax in the brass, marked [...] "Nobilmente e semplice" [...] (rehearsal 76). The [...] "sigh" [...] figure is again heard in the closing thematic area at rehearsal 78, as if to recall earlier grief, slowly melting into the recapitulation of the C minor March theme at rehearsal 79.|$|E
50|$|Scroll-bars are {{a result}} of {{continuous}} lateral migration of a meander loop that creates an asymmetrical ridge and swale topography {{on the inside of the}} bends. The topography is generally parallel to the meander, and is related to migrating bar forms and back bar chutes, which carve sediment from the outside of the curve and deposit sediment in the slower flowing water on the inside of the loop, in a process called lateral accretion. Scroll-bar sediments are characterized by cross-bedding and a pattern of fining upward. These characteristics {{are a result}} of the dynamic river system, where larger grains are transported during high energy flood events and then gradually die down, depositing smaller material with time (Batty 2006). Deposits for meandering rivers are generally homogeneous and laterally extensive unlike the more heterogeneous braided river deposits.There are two distinct patterns of scroll-bar depositions; the eddy accretion scroll <b>bar</b> <b>pattern</b> and the point-bar scroll pattern. When looking down the river valley they can be distinguished because the point-bar scroll patterns are convex and the eddy accretion scroll bar patterns are concave. Scroll bars often look lighter at the tops of the ridges and darker in the swales. This is because the tops can be shaped by wind, either adding fine grains or by keeping the area unvegetated, while the darkness in the swales can be attributed to silts and clays washing in during high water periods. This added sediment in addition to water that catches in the swales is in turn is a favorable environment for vegetation that will also accumulate in the swales.|$|E
40|$|In two earlier papers 21 23 it was {{reported}} that when melanoblasts of the Barred Plymouth Rock embryo were grafted into an embryo of a non-barred breed such as the N. H. Red, Black Minorca, and White Leghorn, two definite types of black and white <b>barred</b> <b>patterns</b> were produced in the host contour feathers. The black bands were wider and darker in one type than in the other. These pigmentation differences appeared to be similar to sex-linked differences in <b>barred</b> <b>pattern</b> exhibited in control Barred Rock chicks of the same age. The suggestion was therefore made that the two patterns produced could be accounted for on the basis of sex-linked inheritance of the barring factor, the melanophores from the female donor which has only one gene for barring producing a darker and wider black band in host feather than one from a male donor which has two genes for barring. These preliminary results furnished the basis for the present study on the effects of the sex-linked barring gene upon the melanophores in their control of <b>barred</b> <b>pattern.</b> By introducing melanoblasts from Barred Rocks of known sex by a variety of grafting methods into feathers of the same or of different breeds it has been possible to demonstrate sex-linked differences in the <b>barred</b> <b>pattern</b> produced. The differences in pattern produced by a melanophore with two barring genes and one with a single barring gene may be contrasted and analyzed. When the melanophores of a male genotype and of a female genotype are introduced into either female or male feather germs conditions are provided for distinguishing between the effects of sex hormones and of sex-linked genes in the formation of a sexual dimorphism in feather pigmentation. Another important feature of this study has been a comparison of the barre...|$|R
