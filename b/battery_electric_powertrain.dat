40|$|The {{increasing}} demand of energy use in transportation systems {{combined with the}} limited supply of fossil hydrocarbons to support conventional engines {{has led to a}} strong resurgence in interest for electric vehicles (EVs). Although EVs offer the possibility of decoupling the issue of energy source from the primary torque generator in an automobile, the current technology is yet to match the well-developed internal combustion (IC) systems, especially in terms of energy capacity and travel range. In this study, the influence of rolling-resistance on the energy efficiency and road holding of electric vehicles is investigated. Rolling resistance is taken in the context of energy loss (e. g. the mechanical energy converted into other sources of energy) for a unit distance traveled by the tire. Considering that the primary factors that affect rolling resistance are pavement features (e. g. texture, stiffness and profile) together with temperature, vehicle speed and tire inflation pressure, a comprehensive simulation study has been conducted utilizing a vehicle model representing chassis dynamics with a <b>battery</b> <b>electric</b> <b>powertrain</b> and a specified tire model to account for rolling-resistance effects. A series of simulations are performed on given urban and highway drive cycles which are determined based on the standard assumption that the vehicle has to be equipped with drive motors that have a combined power of 30 kW in order to overcome the road load during normal driving and {{based on the assumption that}} a specific motor output of approximately 1 kW/kg can be considered to be an appropriate guideline for generic electric motors. At the end, the results are analyzed for estimating the amount of energy that can be saved by reducing such losses and the extended travel range in comparison to available examples of similar results for commercial vehicles in public domain...|$|E

A fixed-gear open-differential transaxle has a gear ratio of 9.73. The RAV4 EV weighs 4030 lb, 470 lb heavier than a front-wheel drive RAV4 Limited with the V-6 engine. [...] Peak power output of the motor is , with peak torque in normal mode of 296 Nm, and peak torque in sport mode of 370 Nm. The RAV 4 offers two drive modes: Normal and Sport. Maximum vehicle speed in Normal mode is 85 mph, and maximum in Sport mode, which also has a more aggressive accelerator pedal feel, is 100 mph. The US Environmental Protection Agency rated the RAV4 EV combined fuel economy at 76 miles per gallon gasoline equivalent (76 mpg), with an equivalent 78 mpg in city driving and 74 mpg on highways.|$|R
40|$|<b>Battery</b> <b>electric</b> {{vehicles}} possess {{great potential}} for decreasing lifecycle costs in medium-duty applications, a market segment currently dominated by internal combustion technology. Characterized by frequent repetition of similar routes and daily return to a central depot, medium-duty vocations are well positioned to leverage the low operating costs of <b>battery</b> <b>electric</b> vehicles. Unfortunately, the range limitation of commercially available <b>battery</b> <b>electric</b> vehicles acts {{as a barrier to}} widespread adoption. This paper describes the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's collaboration with the U. S.

It is found that small fuel-cell power units provide extended range at significantly lower capital and lifecycle costs than additional battery capacity alone. And while fuel-cell range-extended vehicles are not deemed economically competitive with conventional vehicles given present-day economic conditions, this paper identifies potential future scenarios where cost equivalency is achieved...|$|R

For this kind {{of commercial}} applications, high efficiency and eco- friendly electric propulsion systems offer an interesting alternative to thermal engines. This paper {{is focused on the}} analysis of such solution, by presenting experimental results obtained with a ZEBRA bat- tery based propulsion system, designed to power a specific urban unit within the category of electric commercial vehicles. A novel contribution is added to the relevant literature concerning <b>battery</b> based <b>electric</b> <b>powertrains</b> for road vehicles. The main novelty consists {{in a wide range of}} experimental results and performance analysis carried out with reference to the real behavior of both the whole propulsion system and each main component, when powering the commercial vehicle, on the urban part of the NEDC (New European Driving Cycle) standard driving cycle, at different slopes.

40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} a {{complete}} vehicle system simulation tool chain which applies a Multi Objective Optimization (MOO) methodology for designing the <b>Electric</b> <b>Powertrain</b> (ePT) of <b>Battery</b> <b>Electric</b> Vehicles (BEV) is presented.

High system complexity prevents an expert to consider all relevant correlations without the support of numeric simulation tools. The presented simulation tool chain enables fast identification of the best cost/benefit trade off regarding system cost while considering all defined system performance requirements. The approach enables experts to find unconventional solutions which would have been overlooked applying a classical straight forward approach and, thus, helps to sharpen the expert's knowledge in cause-effect relationships on the system level.

40|$|Conventionally, <b>electric</b> <b>powertrain</b> in <b>battery</b> <b>electric</b> {{vehicles}} are designed and optimized {{for a particular}} vehicle category and performance requirements. In this thesis the design of an <b>electric</b> <b>powertrain</b> using two different type of machine is proposed which can be implemented across passenger vehicle categories and provide various performance levels. One of the machine will be high efficiency and the other capable of providing high peak power. The powertrain is dimensioned by analysing existing combustion engine based as well as <b>battery</b> <b>electric</b> vehicle specifications along with wheel load analysis performed on simplified vehicle models using standard drive cycles. Two different vehicle models representing a small and medium sized car is used. The acceleration requirements of various drive cycles are observed to mainly determine the peak power of the powertrain. A V-shaped interior permanent magnet machine is designed to support most of the drive cycle requirements with an electromagnetically excited synchronous machine to provide overloading capabilities. To compare the proposed drive system with the two different machines, a third machine using the same V-shaped magnet geometry is designed to represent a conventional <b>electric</b> <b>powertrain.</b> The proposed drive system is observed to achieve similar torque speed operating boundary as the centralized drive using single machine. The peak efficiency of the centralized drive motor was observed to be higher and the efficiency contours were wider as expected.
