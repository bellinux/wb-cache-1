40|$|Little {{is known}} about the cleavage-fold {{relationships}} in the Lower Palaeozoic Brabant Massif, primarily because of the scarcity of suitable exposures. Moreover, to date, folds have only been described in the Ordovician and Silurian sequences along the southern extremity of the <b>basement.</b> However, <b>excavation</b> <b>works</b> for the construction of the TGV(railway) -track south of Brussels created an opportunity to study cleavage-fold relationships in the Lower Cambrian terrigenous series (Tubize Group) in a more central part of the Brabant Massif. The structural features observed seemed inconsistent with the suspected regional trends. Primarily, a divergent cleavage fan was observed in a region thought to have a regular cleavage attitude. The symmetrical but divergent disposition of the cleavage with regard to the fold hinges is explained by flexural folding of a pre-existing bedding-parallel compaction fabric. Cleavage development and folding are considered synchronous. The divergent cleavage fan reflects local strain variations. Also the steeply plunging hinge lines of the open, subangular folds are seemingly inconsistent with the regional trend characterized by subhorizontal fold hinges. Taking into account the structural position of the fold assemblage in the subvertical limb of a large-scale, upright, isoclinal fold structure, the fold assemblage is interpreted as an incongruous parasitic feature. The steeply plunging hinge Lines are considered to be caused by fold hinge rotation during progressive coaxial deformation. Although this incongruous fold assemblage with its divergent cleavage fan is localized, it provides important information on both local and regional deformation circumstances {{in this part of the}} Anglo-Brabant Fold Belt. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|<b>Basement</b> <b>excavation</b> {{may induce}} {{unsymmetrical}} and highly skewed loadings and (or) stress changes in an existing tunnel, {{not only in}} the transverse, but also in the longitudinal direction of the tunnel. Although basement-tunnel interaction has attracted intense academic interest recently, it is often simply treated as a plane strain problem. In this study, however, based on a dimensional analysis of the governing parameters, two three-dimensional centrifuge tests were designed and carried out in dry sand to investigate the effects of a <b>basement</b> <b>excavation</b> on an existing tunnel located in two horizontal offsets in relation to the basement. In addition, a preliminary three-dimensional numerical analysis was conducted to back-analyse the centrifuge test and to investigate the effects of the tunnel cover-to-diameter and unloading ratios on the existing tunnel. For the specific conditions simulated and soil type tested, a maximum heave of about 0. 07 % of the final depth of the <b>basement</b> <b>excavation</b> (H-e) was induced in the tunnel that ran parallel to and beneath the basement. On the contrary, a maximum settlement of 0. 014 % H-e was induced in the tunnel located {{at the side of the}} basement. For the former tunnel, the influence zone by the <b>basement</b> <b>excavation</b> on vertical tunnel displacement along the longitudinal direction was 1. 2 L (basement length). By inspecting the measured strains in the longitudinal direction of the existing tunnel, it was found that the inflection point, where the shear force is at a maximum, was located at 0. 8 L away from the basement centre. Due to stress relief from the <b>basement</b> <b>excavation,</b> the tunnel located directly beneath the basement was vertically elongated, but the one that lay at the side of the basement was distorted. A preliminary numerical parametric study found that tunnel heave decreased as the cover-to-diameter ratio increased, but at a reduced rate...|$|R
40|$|Rapid urban {{development}} very often requires {{the construction of}} buildings close to or directly above existing tunnels. To increase the usable space, underground excavation underneath these buildings is an attractive solution. It is recognised that an excavation often imposes significant stress changes {{in the ground and}} may induce deflection on the tunnel lining, which may affect the serviceability and safety of the tunnel. The complex interaction between a new <b>basement</b> <b>excavation</b> and an existing tunnel is not well understood. In this paper, two centrifuge model tests were carried out to study the influence of a <b>basement</b> <b>excavation</b> on an existing tunnel. © 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, London...|$|R

40|$|Problem statement: <b>Excavation</b> <b>work</b> {{sites in}} urban areas for {{infrastructures}} and buildings cause {{a great deal of}} disturbance and damage due to the emission of particulate matter, in particular in the area involved in urban renovation work. Under Italian legislation limits currently exist for PM 10 and PM 2, 5 but, in the case of <b>excavation</b> <b>work</b> sites, it would be also necessary to consider limits for Total Suspended Particulate Matter (TSP), but these no longer exist. Approach: A 20 -month monitoring period near the exposed population was carried out measuring and analyzing the concentration of TSP, PM 10 and PM 2, 5. This monitoring was done in order to determine statistically significant results, {{to find out what the}} pollutant sources are and the microclimate conditions and the particle-size values to take into account as a critical condition to be managed and controlled inside <b>excavation</b> <b>work</b> sites in an urban area. Results: The data obtained shows that <b>excavation</b> <b>work</b> sites increase particulate matter concentration, which may already be high. PM 10 measured near the <b>excavation</b> <b>work</b> site and urban traffic, represented about 70 % of TSP. In the city measurement of PM 10 were usually around 10 % higher. TSP concentration values depended on the type of work activity and, although they were similar to TSP concentration values in the city, sometimes they were 60 % higher. Conclusion: The high levels of particulate matter due to the <b>excavation</b> <b>work</b> sites {{in urban areas}} can significantly increase the health risk effect. In the roads near the <b>excavation</b> <b>work</b> sites, even when there is no <b>excavation</b> <b>work</b> activity, the resurgence of dust from the ground by vehicles results in high levels of TSP. The results of this study are of interest for local government as a basis for prevention, monitoring and control of environmental impacts due to the dispersion of dust into the atmosphere, generated by <b>excavation</b> <b>work</b> sites...|$|R
