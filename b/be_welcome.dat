5|$|In 1909 Harold Oliver {{moved to}} Lyrup, South Australia {{and started a}} farm growing fruit. During this time, he captained the Lyrup {{football}} team. In 1909, after never previously winning a game, the Lyrup football club won the local riverland league premiership. They subsequently traveled to Mildura where they lost twice to the home team. The Mildura Cultivator praised Oliver's marking and kicking reporting that it {{was as good as}} anyone who had played at the ground. An umpire at the game from Melbourne told Harold that he would <b>be</b> <b>welcome</b> in Melbourne to play football if he wanted to. At the end of 1909 Oliver was contemplating moving to Queensland to join his sister in the state but two friends, the Musgrave brothers, who played for West Suburbans in Adelaide suggested he come down and visit.|$|E
5|$|In February 2013, {{planning}} permission for the redevelopment was granted. The {{cost of the}} project was estimated to be around £29.2million, of which £25.2million would come from government funding. It was initially planned for the work to begin in September 2013. Two months later however, Crusaders began legal proceedings against the redevelopment. The club called for the process to be judicially reviewed, believing it to be against European Union competition laws and also a form of State aid towards Linfield. When Crusaders played Linfield at Windsor Park at the end of April, their club officials were allegedly informed that they would not <b>be</b> <b>welcome</b> in the directors box or the boardroom during the game – an apparent reaction to Crusaders' legal challenge of the stadium redevelopment. In a hearing that took place on 22 May 2013, Crusaders' request was granted. It was ruled that it was a possibility for the redevelopment to be classed as state aid towards Linfield. The aspect of the challenge concerning competition law however, was dismissed.|$|E
5|$|When the English {{selectors}} met {{to choose}} the team, Allen, Griffith and Gilligan were present to represent the MCC; they had no official say in the selection, but Oborne suggests that Allen {{made it clear that}} he considered D'Oliveira unworthy of a place on the team on cricketing grounds. D'Oliveira was eventually left out, to considerable anger and controversy. When he was later added to the team following an injury to another player, Vorster said that the MCC would not <b>be</b> <b>welcome</b> and the tour was cancelled. Some of the events leading up to D'Oliveira's exclusion became public knowledge the following year; the MCC came under heavy public pressure, and the press called for Allen to resign. Oborne suggests that Allen, although not a supporter of apartheid, wished to maintain the traditional links between England and South Africa; he regarded opponents of apartheid as enemies of the MCC and the Establishment.|$|E

25|$|Thus, Cortés had {{to choose}} among three land routes: north to Tlatelolco, which was the least {{dangerous}} path but required the longest trip through the city; south to Coyohuacan and Ixtlapalapan, two towns that would not welcome the Spanish; or west to Tlacopan, which required the shortest trip through Tenochtitlan, though they would not <b>be</b> <b>welcome</b> there either. Cortés decided on the west causeway to Tlacopan, needing the quickest route out of Tenochtitlan with all his provisions and people.|$|E
25|$|Walter Herman Jacobus Steins S.J., third Catholic Bishop of Auckland (1879–1881) thought, that as {{they were}} a French congregation, the Marist Brothers might not <b>be</b> <b>welcome</b> in Auckland {{and that it would}} be better to invite the Irish Christian Brothers as most of the Catholics in Auckland were Irish. Steins's successor, John Edmund Luck OSB, fourth Catholic Bishop of Auckland (1881–1896), had no such qualms and invited the Marist Brothers to {{establish}} their school. An unsuccessful move may have been made in 1885 to open a Christian Brothers School.|$|E

25|$|Initial British {{plans for}} the Islands were based upon the {{continuation}} of Vernet's settlement at Port Louis. An Argentine immigrant of Irish origin, William Dickson, was appointed as the British representative and provided with a flagpole and flag to be flown whenever ships were in harbour. In March 1833, Vernet's Deputy, Matthew Brisbane returned and presented his papers to Captain Fitzroy of HMS Beagle, which coincidentally {{happened to be in}} harbour at the time. Fitzroy encouraged Brisbane to continue with Vernet's enterprise with the proviso that whilst private enterprise was encouraged, Argentine assertions of sovereignty would not <b>be</b> <b>welcome.</b>|$|E

Quarterback Brodie Croyle, who was drafted in 2006, was in contention with Huard to succeed Green throughout the offseason. The Chiefs had said that Green would <b>be</b> <b>welcome</b> to return and compete for the job as well if he wasn’t traded, but Green refused. After the draft had passed, Trent Green was still listed on the Chiefs' roster, but Green's agent stated that Green would {{not return to the}} Chiefs for the 2007 season. On June 5, the Chiefs traded Green to the Miami Dolphins.|$|E
25|$|Bustamante {{implemented}} {{other measures}} to make immigration less desirable for Anglo-Americans. He rescinded {{the property tax}} law, which had exempted immigrants from paying taxes for tenyears. He further increased tariffs on goods entering Mexico from the United States, causing their prices to rise. The 1830s laws also brought settlement contracts under federal rather than state control. Colonies {{that did not have}} at least 150inhabitants would be canceled. Among the affected colonies were the Nashville Company run by Sterling C. Robertson and the Galveston Bay and Texas Land Company, run by David G. Burnet, Lorenzo de Zavala and Joseph Vehlein. Finally, he prohibited further immigration to Texas from the United States, although Anglos would still <b>be</b> <b>welcome</b> in other parts of Mexico. The ban and other measures did not stop U.S. citizens from migrating illegally to Texas by the thousands. By 1834, it was estimated that over 30,000Anglos lived in Texas, compared to only 7,800Mexicans.|$|E
