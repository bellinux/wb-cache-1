6000|$|Awakened by that daily cruelty, {{the advent}} of hot water, Edward Pierson lay in his chintz-curtained room, fancying himself back in London. A wild <b>bee</b> <b>hunting</b> honey from the bowl of flowers on the window-sill, and the scent of sweetbrier, {{shattered}} that illusion. He drew the curtain, and, kneeling on the window-seat thrust his head out into the morning. The air was intoxicatingly sweet. Haze clung over {{the river and the}} woods beyond; the lawn sparkled with dew, and two wagtails strutted in the dewy sunshine. 'Thank God for loveliness!' he thought. 'Those poor boys at the front!' And kneeling with his elbows on the sill, he began to say his prayers. The same feeling which made him beautify his church, use vestments, good music, and incense, filled him now. God was in the loveliness of His world, as well as in His churches. One could worship Him in a grove of beech trees, in a beautiful garden, on a high hill, by the banks of a bright river. God was in the rustle of the leaves, and the hum of a bee, in the dew on the grass, and the scent of flowers; God was in everything! And he added to his usual prayer this whisper: [...] "I give Thee thanks for my senses, O Lord. In all of us, keep them bright, and grateful for beauty." [...] Then he remained motionless, prey to a sort of happy yearning very near, to melancholy. Great beauty ever had that effect on him. One could capture so little of it--could never enjoy it enough! Who was it had said not long ago: [...] "Love of beauty is really only the sex instinct, which nothing but complete union satisfies." [...] Ah! yes, George--Gratian's husband. George Laird! And a little frown came between his brows, as though at some thorn in the flesh. Poor George! But then, all doctors were materialists at heart--splendid fellows, though; a fine fellow, George, working himself to death out there in France. One must not take them too seriously. He plucked a bit of sweetbrier and put it to his nose, which still retained the shine of that bleaching ointment Noel had insisted on his using. The sweet smell of those little rough leaves stirred up an acute aching. He dropped them, and drew back. No longings, no melancholy; one ought to be out, this beautiful morning! ...|$|E

40|$|Trivers’s {{concept of}} parental {{investment}} {{is an integral}} part of modern evolutionary biology. ‘‘Parental investment’ ’ is defined as any parental expenditure that benefits a current progeny at the expense of a parent’s ability to reproduce in the future. Because future costs are hard to quantify, other currencies were used that were thought to be related to the actual costs. However, the validity of these alternative measures has rarely been established, at least in insects. Specifically, these measures were not shown to represent costs at all. We investigated provisioning behavior in a sphecid wasp, the European beewolf, Philanthus triangulum F., and tested whether prey hunting entails future costs to the female wasp and thus represents parental investment. We increased as well as decreased the females ’ hunting effort experimentally and determined their hunting success on the following day. Furthermore, we analyzed the correlation between hunting rate of unrestricted females and their life span and assessed the effect of an experimentally decreased hunting effort on life span. The future rate of <b>bee</b> <b>hunting</b> decreased when hunting expenditure was increased (in the field) and vice versa (both in the field and in the laboratory). In contrast, there was no trade-off between hunting rate and life span, and life span was not affected by an experimentally decreased hunting effort (in the laboratory). Because prey hunting entails costs in terms of a reduced rate of prey hunting in the future, it meets Trivers ’ definition of parental investment. Key words: cost of reproduction, European beewolf, parental investment, Philanthus triangulum F., Sphecidae, Trivers.

It was that moment of the year when the countryside seems to faint from its own loveliness, from the intoxication of its scents and sounds. Creamy-white may, splashed here and there with crimson, flooded the hedges in breaking waves of flower-foam; the fields were all buttercup glory; every tree had its cuckoo, calling; every bush its blackbird or thrush in full even-song. Swallows were flying rather low, and the sky, whose moods they watch, had the slumberous, surcharged beauty of a long, fine day, with showers not far away. Some orchards were still in blossom, and the great wild <b>bees,</b> <b>hunting</b> over flowers and grasses warm to their touch, kept the air deeply murmurous. Movement, light, color, song, scent, the warm air, and the fluttering leaves were confused, till one had almost become the other.|$|R
40|$|The {{dissertation}} "Horse in {{the history}} of human culture" presents a summary of a history of horse in the human culture. Horses have {{played a significant role in}} homo sapiensis evolution ever since it came to Eurasia. From <b>beeing</b> <b>hunted</b> for food, horses soon turned in the process of domestication into working, riding and driving animals of significant importance. In different cultures and epochs, different types of horses of different purposes have been emerging. But since its domestication, horses have allways been tellig a story of culture in its time and space. This is why this topic is a part of the wide array of interest of the therory of culture. In this dissertation, I chose to catch a relation of horses and culture in the historic circumstancies. I hoped to connect my experience with horses with scientific literature on this topic, historical facts and presently existing historical artefacts related to horses. In most of scientific and historical literature, many notes on horses may be find, but mostly they are interpreting the facts wrogly, and sometimes they are even wery far from the truth. the historicians usualy lack the needed knowledge of hipology, etology and zoology.

50|$|It {{produces}} a {{volatile organic compound}} that is unrecorded in other plant species. The flowers of this orchid produce a bee pheromone which attracts its pollinator, Vespa bicolor, a species of hornet. The novel feature, first reported in 2009, is supposed to mimic the distress pheromone of the indigenous Asian honey bee Apis cerana (the same chemical as in the European Apis mellifera, which does not occur naturally on Hainan). The chemical compound, (Z)-11-eicosen-1-ol, can be detected by the hornet and is it is assumed this mimicry deceives the insect into visiting the flower without reward (the flowers offer no nectar). V. bicolor preys on honey bees to feed its larvae. The European beewolf (Philanthus triangulum) is also able to detect this compound when <b>hunting</b> <b>bees.</b>|$|R

40|$|Natural habitat {{degradation}} {{often involves}} the reduction or disappearance of bee species. In Africa, stingless <b>bees</b> are <b>hunted</b> for honey, {{which is used}} as food, for medicinal purposes, and for traditional rituals. Severe habitat degradation due to human settlement is hypothesized to {{have a negative impact}} on the species diversity of the African stingless bee species. In this paper, we assess the impact of habitat degradation on the diversity of five stingless bee species across different habitats in the tropical rainforest of Kenya (indigenous forest, mixed indigenous forest) and its neighbouring landscape (grassland, village) in western Kenya. The species fauna, nest occurrence, and species diversity of the stingless bee species varied across the different habitats. The number of nesting habitats of the meliponine species varied between habitats in the tropical rainforest. Meliponula ferruginea (reddish brown) nested in five habitats, while Meliponula bocandei and Meliponula ferruginea (black) nested only in two habitat types. The species richness decreased within the different types of habitats and the indigenous and mixed indigenous forest contained more species than other habitats. The fauna composition in both homesteads was exclusively similar, while the indigenous and mixed indigenous forests were mostly similar. Similarity in habitat preferences for nesting was revealed between M. bocandei vs Plebeina hildebrandti and M. ferruginea (reddish brown) vs Hypotrigona gribodoi. The natural native indigenous forest had the most diverse community compared to the degraded habitats. There are taxon-specific responses to habitat change; and in our study, there is clear value in conserving the native indigenous forest...|$|R
40|$|Fear {{can have}} strong {{ecosystem}} effects by giving predators a role disproportionate to their actual kill rates. In bees, fear is shown through foragers avoiding dangerous food sites, {{thereby reducing the}} fitness of pollinated plants. However, it remains unclear how fear affects pollinators in a complex natural scenario involving multiple predator species and different patch qualities. We studied hornets, Vespa velutina (smaller) and V. tropica (bigger) preying upon the Asian honey bee, Apis cerana in China. Hornets <b>hunted</b> <b>bees</b> on flowers and were attacked by bee colonies. Bees treated the bigger hornet species (which is 4 fold more massive) as more dan gerous. It received 4. 5 fold more attackers than the smaller hornet species. We tested bee responses to a three-feeder array with different hornet species and varying resource qualities. When all feeders offered 30 % sucrose solution (w/w), colony foraging allocation, individual visits, and individual patch residence times were reduced according {{to the degree of}} danger. Predator presence reduced foraging visits by 55 - 79 % and residence times by 17 - 33 %. When feeders offered different reward levels (15 %, 30 %, or 45 % sucrose), colony and individual foraging favored higher sugar concentrations. However, when balancing food quality against multiple threats (sweeter food corresponding to higher danger), colonies exhibited greater fear than individuals. Colonies decreased foraging at low and high danger patches. Individuals exhibited less fear and only decreased visits to the high danger patch. Contrasting individual with emergent colony-level effects of fear can thus illuminate how predators shape pollination by social bees. © 2013 Tan et al...|$|R
60|$|Peter {{was most}} struck {{with all that}} had just occurred. He had often heard of the skill of those who <b>hunted</b> <b>bees,</b> and had several times met with {{individuals}} who practised the art, {{but this was the}} first occasion on which he had ever been a witness, in his own person, of the exercise of a craft so wonderful! Had the process been simply that of catching a bee, filling it with honey, letting it go, and then following it to its hive, it would have been so simple as to require no explanation. But Peter was too intelligent, as well as too observant, not to have seen that a great deal more than this was necessary. On the supposition that the bee flew TOWARD the forest, as had been the fact with two of the bees taken that morning, in what part of that forest was the hunter to look for the bee-tree? It was the angle that perplexed Peter, as it did all the Indians; for that angle, to be understood, required a degree of knowledge and calculation that entirely exceeded all he had ever acquired. Thus is it with us ever. The powers, and faculties, and principles that are necessary fully to comprehend all that we see and all that surrounds us, exist and have been bestowed on man by his beneficent Creator. Still, it is only by slow degrees that he is to become their master, acquiring knowledge, step by step, as he has need of its services, and learns how to use it. Such seems to be the design of Providence, which is gradually opening to our inquiries the arcana of nature, in order that we may convert their possession into such uses as will advance its own wise intentions. Happy are they who feel this truth in their character of individuals! Thrice happy the nations which can be made to understand, that the surest progress is that which is made on the clearest principles, and with the greatest caution! The notion of setting up anything new in morals, is as fallacious in theory as it will be found to be dangerous in practice.|$|R
