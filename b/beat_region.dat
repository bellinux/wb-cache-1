A correlational-transversal research was conducted {{with a sample of}} 751 journalists who filled out the questionnaire “Worlds of Journalism Study”. The results show significant differences on the attacks received by the journalists depending on gender, news <b>beat,</b> <b>region,</b> news media, years of experience, capacity and educational level of journalists. Attacks on journalists correlates positively with the autonomy to publish and write news on governments, armed forces, criminal gangs and structural social problems (poverty, status of ethnic minorities, socioeconomic inequality, environmental damage) the latter being a predictor of high risk security...|$|E

40|$|The current {{delivered}} by the photodiode in a self-mixing frequency modulated continuous wave or optical frequency domain reflectometry system consists of a dc-current resulting from the local oscillator, the reflected signal, dark current in the photodiode, and current generated from background light. The current also contains the useful harmonic signal with a beat frequency corresponding to the range and radial velocity of a target. To avoid saturation and clipping due to the dc current generated in the photodiode, it is desirable to minimize the gain at dc while maintaining a high gain in the <b>beat</b> frequency <b>region.</b> We have investigated some different solutions and present a modified current-to-voltage converter using bootstrapping and added voltage gain, which addresses this problem using only one OP-amp and no dc shorting inductors.

40|$|Being {{one of the}} {{fundamental}} phenomena in nonlinear science, synchronization of oscillations has permanently remained an object of intensive research. Development of many asymptotic methods and numerical simulations has allowed an understanding and explanation of various phenomena of self-synchronization. But even in the classical case of coupled van der Pol oscillators a full description of all possible dynamical regimes, their mutual transitions and characteristics is still lacking. We present here a study of the phenomenon of mutual synchronization for two non-scalar-coupled non-identical limit-cycle oscillators and analyze phase, frequency and amplitude characteristics of synchronization regimes. A series of bifurcation diagrams that we obtain exhibit various regions of qualitatively different behavior. Among them we find mono-, bi- and multistability <b>regions,</b> <b>beating</b> and “oscillation death ” ones; also a region, where one of the oscillators dominates the other one is observed. The frequency characteristics that we obtain reveal three qualitatively different types of synchronization: (i) on the mean frequency (the in-phase synchronization), (ii) with a shift from the mean frequency caused by a conservative coupling term (the anti-phase synchronization), and (iii) on the frequency of one of the oscillators (when one oscillator dominates the other) ...|$|R
50|$|Protein {{distribution}} in egg whites is as follows: (54%) ovalbumin, (13%) conalbumin/ ovotransferrin, (11%) ovomucoid, (4%) ovoglobulins, (3.5%) lysozyme, and (2%) ovomucin. Ovoglobulins drive foaming, ovomucin {{is the main}} stabilization agent, and {{the remainder of the}} proteins interact to contribute to overall foaming and stability. When egg whites are beaten, some of the hydrogen bonds in the proteins break, causing the proteins to unfold ("denature") and to aggregate non-specifically. When these egg white proteins denature (due to agitation from <b>beating),</b> their hydrophobic <b>regions</b> are exposed and the formation of intermolecular protein-protein interactions is promoted. These protein-protein interactions, usually disulfide bridges, create networks responsible for the structure of the foam and this change in structure leads to the stiff consistency required for meringues. The use of a copper bowl, or the addition of cream of tartar is required to additionally denature the proteins to create the firm peaks, otherwise the whites will not be firm. Plastic bowls, wet or greasy bowls will likely result in the meringue mix being prevented from becoming peaky. Wiping the bowl with a wedge of lemon to remove any traces of grease can often help the process.|$|R

The two teams have met domestic in cup finals few times since the early 1990s, most notably the 1999 Malawi Carlsberg Cup final. The match ended 1-1 after 90 minutes and went to extra time, Wanderers scored a dramatic golden goal to lift the cup. Few years later Bullets got their revenge when they beat Wanderers 1-0 in 2001 final of the same cup, {{to make matters worse}} it was Wanderers' old boy Mc Donald Yobe who scored the only goal against his former employers.The infamous 2003 final, probably the most anticipated, the two teams clashed in final of the same competition, Wanderers took an early lead in the first half when their wonderkid Joseph Kamwendo scored, he was only 17 at the time. Bullets equalised through their veteran striker Ganizani M'bobo Malunga. Wanderers scored two more goals but were disollowed for offside. This caused the fans to clash in the terraces, the match was abandoned and has never been replayed.Due to crowd troubles Carlsberg ended their sponsorship and other companies have also terminated contracts most notably Bp Top 8, Malawis biggest football competition in terms of prize money to date.

40|$|Orbit {{bumps in}} sextupoles are {{routinely}} used for tuning the luminosity in the PEP-II B-Factory. Anti-symmetric bumps at {{a pair of}} identical sextupoles separated by -I section generate the net dispersion, while symmetric horizontal bumps induce a tune shift and beta beat. By combining two of these symmetric bumps with opposite signs, where the second pair is 90 {sup o} away, the tune shift cancels and the beta beat doubles. In the low energy ring (LER), there are four -I sextupole pairs per arc, located one after another 90 {sup o} apart, where pairs 1 and 3 are at the same phase and pairs 2 and 4 are 90 {sup o} away. By making two symmetric bumps with opposite sign in pairs 1 and 3, the tune shift and beta <b>beat</b> outside this <b>region</b> cancel, {{but there is a}} local change of phase and beta in the 2 nd sextupole pair located in the middle. By using this bump knob, the LER lifetime improved by a factor of 3, losses by a factor of 5, and the beam-beam background in the drift chamber of the BaBar detector by 20 %. Optics analysis showed that the local phase change at the 2 nd sextupole pair can compensate the 3 rd order chromaticity...|$|R

40|$|Spermatozoa {{from the}} sea urchin, Colobocentrotus atratus, were {{partially}} demembranated by extraction with solutions containing Triton X- 100 at a concentration which was insufficient to solubilize the membranes completely. The resulting suspension was a mixture containing some spermatozoa in which a proximal, medial, or distal portion of the flagellum was membrane-covered, while the remaining portion was naked axoneme. In reactivating solutions containing 12 µM ATP, only the naked portions of the flagellum became motile. In reactivating solutions containing 0. 8 mM ADP, the membrane-covered regions became motile and beat at 6 - 10 beats/s, while the naked regions remained immobile, or beat very slowly at about 0. 3 beat/s. Activation of membrane-covered regions in ADP solutions probably results from the membrane restricting the diffusion of ATP which is formed from ADP by the axonemal adenylate kinase. The results indicate that any region of the flagellum has the capacity for autonomous beating, and that special properties of the basal end of the flagellum are not required for bend initiation. However, the <b>beating</b> of different <b>regions</b> of the flagellum is not completely independent, for in {{a fair number of}} spermatozoa the beating of the distal, membrane-covered region in 0. 8 mM ADP was intermittent, and was turned on and off in phase with the much slower bending cycle in the proximal region of naked axoneme...|$|R
40|$|International audienceParamecium cells {{swim and}} feed by beating their {{thousands}} of cilia in coordinated patterns. The organization of these patterns {{and its relationship}} with cell motility {{has been the subject}} of a large body of work, particularly as a model for ciliary beating in human organs where similar organization is seen. However the rapid motion of the cells makes quantitative measurements very challenging. Here we provide detailed measurements of the swimming of Paramecium cells from high-speed video at high magnification, as they move in microfluidic channels. An image analysis protocol allows us to decouple the cell movement from the motion of the cilia, thus allowing us to measure the ciliary beat frequency (CBF) and the spatio-temporal organization into metachronal waves along the cell periphery. Two distinct values of the CBF appear at different regions of the cell: most of the cilia beat in the range of 15 to 45 Hz, while the cilia in the peristomal <b>region</b> <b>beat</b> at almost double the frequency. The body and peristomal CBF display a nearly linear relation with the swimming velocity. Moreover the measurements do not display a measurable correlation between the swimming velocity and the metachronal wave velocity on the cell periphery. These measurements are repeated for four RNAi silenced mutants, where proteins specific to the cilia or to their connection to the cell base are depleted. We find that the mutants whose ciliary structure is affected display similar swimming to the control cells albeit with a reduced efficiency, while the mutations that affect the cilia's anchoring to the cell lead to strongly reduced ability to swim. This reduction in motility can be related to a loss of coordination between the ciliary beating in different parts of the cell...|$|R
