5|$|Diocletian's {{expansion}} {{of the army and}} civil service meant that the empire's tax burden grew. Since military upkeep took the largest portion of the imperial budget, any reforms here would be especially costly. The proportion of the adult male population, excluding slaves, serving in the army increased from roughly 1 in 25 to 1 in 15, an increase judged excessive by some modern commentators. Official troop allowances were kept to low levels, and the mass of troops often resorted to extortion or the taking of civilian jobs. Arrears became the norm for most troops. Many were even given payment in kind in place of their salaries. Were he unable to pay for his enlarged army, there would likely <b>be</b> <b>civil</b> conflict, potentially open revolt. Diocletian was led to devise a new system of taxation.|$|E

500|$|Brain's {{penchant for}} motorbikes and things {{mechanical}} inspired a lift driver at CBC to suggest he apply for pilot {{training in the}} recently formed Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). He was among five civilian students nominated by the Civil Aviation Branch (CAB) of the Defence Department for entry into the inaugural RAAF flying training course, which commenced at Point Cook, Victoria in January 1923. The benefit of these nominations from a military perspective was that although the destiny of the CAB-sponsored students was to <b>be</b> <b>civil</b> aviators, they would also be members of the RAAF reserve, known as the Citizen Air Force (CAF), and could therefore be called up for active service as and when necessary. [...] Brain's fellow attendees included Royal Australian Navy lieutenants Joe Hewitt and Ellis Wackett, and Australian Army lieutenant Frank Bladin, {{all of whom were}} seconded—and later permanently transferred—to the RAAF.|$|E
500|$|In March 2013, the Goathouse Refuge was a {{cover story}} in the Indy Week paper.

[...] The author, Lisa Sorg, says that according to former volunteers at the Goathouse Refuge, there are twice as many cats on the premises as recommended by a veterinarian, and that Scarpa makes volunteers sign an anti-defamation agreement and instructs them to lie to state inspectors, among other allegations that Scarpa denied or justified. Just over a day after the article's release the comments section on the Indy Week website became so heated that Denise Prickett, INDY Editorial Web Director, posted [...] "We have closed comments on this story for the weekend.

500|$|Burton {{stated in}} an {{interview}} that he enjoyed the plot twist, and compared it to Jason Morgan being Monica Quartermaine's (Leslie Charleson) son on General Hospital. He said that he felt a connection while working with Scott, stating: [...] "There is vulnerability there between us, and it’s not on purpose. It’s just something that is there. It was actually kind of there before it happened that we were on-screen mother and son." [...] In a separate interview with Michael Logan of TV Guide, Scott stated: [...] "Nikki thinks she has come up with a good way of having everyone informed in the kindest way possible. If it were me, I would think, [...] "I can only go through this once. It's too emotional! Let's sit everybody down at the same time and get it over with." [...] Nikki had intended to reveal the news privately to Dylan but that opportunity never comes up." [...] Speaking of how the revelation would affect Nicholas, Scott added, [...] "She feels very badly about Nick losing Avery but not bad enough that she doesn't expect Nick to play nice and accept this man — not necessarily as a brother but still as a member of the family. She expects him to find a way to <b>be</b> <b>civil.</b> She wants everyone to be happy together." [...] Speculation also arose that Nikki's son could be Dylan's best friend Stitch Rayburn (Sean Carrigan), to which Scott teased, [...] "Maybe that's coming. Nikki had cult twins! You never know. I think Sean Carrigan could believably play my son. I think he looks a little like me, probably more like me than Steve Burton does." ...|$|E
500|$|Once in Philadelphia, Dennie {{resumed his}} {{editorial}} {{career with the}} Gazette of the United States, a Federalist-friendly newspaper. In 1800 Dennie, along with Philadelphia bookseller Asbury Dickens, began work on the Port Folio. Under the pseudonym Oliver Oldschool, Esq., Dennie wrote, in 1803, a scathing attack on Jeffersonian democracy, {{for which he was}} brought up on charges of seditious libel. Dennie wrote, in part:A democracy is scarcely tolerable at any period of national history. Its omens are always sinister, and its powers are unpropitious. It is on its trial here, and the issue will <b>be</b> <b>civil</b> war, desolation, and anarchy. No wise man but discerns its imperfections, no good man but shudders at its miseries, no honest man but proclaims its fraud, and no brave man but draws his sword against its force. The institution of a scheme of policy so radically contemptible and vicious is a memorable example of what the villany of some men can devise, the folly of others receive, and both establish in spite of reason, reflection, and sensation. This paragraph was reprinted in Federalist newspapers throughout the country. While Dennie was acquitted, the severity of the attacks leveled in Port Folio would henceforth be lessened. However, when Dennie criticized democracy, it was not the republican democracy found in the United States today, but rather the [...] "democracy" [...] found in France under Robespierre and Napoleon. Dennie was invoking Aristotle's argument that [...] "an absolute democracy is not to be reckoned among the legitimate forms of government. It is the corruption and degeneracy, and not the sound constitution of a republic." ...|$|E

2500|$|Biblical patriarchy as {{expressed}} by the Vision Forum is similar to Complementarianism in that it affirms the equality of men and women, but goes further in its expression of the different gender roles. Many {{of the differences between}} them are ones of degree and emphasis. While Complementarianism holds to exclusively male leadership in the church and in the home, biblical patriarchy extends that exclusion to the civic sphere as well, so that women should not <b>be</b> <b>civil</b> leaders and indeed should not have careers outside the home. Thus, William Einwechter refers to the traditional Complementarian view as [...] "two point complementarianism" [...] (male leadership in the family and church), and regards the biblical patriarchy view as [...] "three-point" [...] or [...] "full" [...] complementarianism, (male leadership in family, church and society). In contrast to this, John Piper and Wayne Grudem, representing the Complementarian position, say that they are [...] "not as sure in this wider sphere which roles can be carried out by men or women". Grudem also acknowledges exceptions to the submission of wives to husbands where moral issues are involved.|$|E
2500|$|Duterte {{has been}} {{publicly}} very open about his infidelity and philandering while married to Zimmerman and cited {{it as the}} reason for his failed first marriage when asked in interviews. In 1998, Zimmerman filed a petition with the Regional Trial Court in Pasig to nullify her marriage. Duterte never appeared in court and did not contest Zimmerman's petition. Two years later, the court decided in her favor, ending the 27-year marriage of Duterte and Zimmerman. Duterte and Zimmerman have been on good terms in recent years with Zimmerman stating, [...] "Yes, [...] is really a very good leader. That is all he is. But when it comes to family, he is not capable of taking care of it." [...] In 2001, Zimmerman eventually ran for a seat on the city council but lost. Duterte and Zimmerman are said to have patched things up and appear to <b>be</b> <b>civil</b> to each other, 15 years after their marriage was declared null and void. Zimmerman eventually joined the campaign trail for Duterte's presidential candidacy in early 2016 called Byaheng Du30 in which she would travel by bus to major cities together with her daughter Sara and a number of delegates.|$|E
