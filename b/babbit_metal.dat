40|$|With {{the aid of}} Chalmers {{specimens}} {{according to}} DIN ISO 4368, part 2, the bonding strength between Babbit sliding bearing materials and steel support members was investigated. The experimental results proved that the bonding strength of the newly developed alloy Sn- 12 Sb- 6 Cu- 1. 8 Bi remained insufficient, when the supporting shell of steel grade C 10 was dipped in a pure Sn bath, even with variations of Sn bath temperature or casting and cooling modifications. With Bi containing melts an oxide layer forms between steel and bearing metal when the alloy is poured into the tin coated cups requested for Chalmers specimens. This oxide layer prevents a proper Fe/Sn bonding. The reason {{for the formation of}} the oxide layer when using Bi containing melts is not understood. A possible solution to the bonding problem is the in situ formation of a new bond coating directly from a modified tin bath. To this end, the bath of pure tin is alloyed with an element which has a higher affinity to iron than tin does. One possible alloying element is Zn, which can form intermetallic Fe-Zn layers on the steel shell enabling higher bonding strengths than layers formed in pure tin baths. By modifying the tinning of steel support shells this way, the originally low bonding strength of the newly developed bearing alloy could be increased to the level of conventional tin based sliding bearing alloys. In addition, the bonding strength of conventional <b>Babbit</b> <b>metals</b> on tin base could be considerably increased. The modified Sn Zn bath yields high bonding strengths with the investigated new alloys Sn- 12 Sb- 6 Cu- 1. 8 Bi, Sn- 12 Sb- 6 Cu- 1. 8 B+Te 5, Sn- 12 Sb- 6 Cu- 1. 8 B+Ni 5, Sn- 12 Sb- 6 Cu- 1. 8 Bi+Zn 50 {{as well as with the}} conventional Babbit alloys TEGO V 738, TEGOSTAR and TEGOTENAX. With the lead based alloy LM-THERMIT an improvement is not achieved, yet, the bonding strength surpasses under all testing conditions a value of 50 N/mm 2. This proves that the new bath is universally applicable. To test the alloy dependence of the bonding strength the Zn content was varied from 9 over 24, 50 and 60 to 70 weight - %. Depending on ZN content the bath temperature was raised from 280 to 380 째C. On an average, the Zn content of 50 % gave the most favorable strength values. As a bath temperature, 360 째C turned out to deliver the best results...|$|R
40|$|Hydropower, the {{utilisation}} {{of water}} {{as a means of}} driving machinery, has been used for many centuries. Today, the great power of water is being harnessed to generate as much as 20 % of worldwide electricity. The requirement for reliable and efficient electricity generation needs to be matched by environmental awareness {{on the part of the}} industry. Work carried out during the course of my doctoral studies at Lule책 University of Technology has been aimed at addressing these demands by investigating means of improving sliding bearing performance through the use of environmentally adapted lubricants and the employment of novel materials and surface texturing to reduce friction. The term "sliding bearing" refers to a type of bearing where two surfaces (usually the stationary bearing and a moving shaft) slide relative to one another with load distributed directly across the interface. In hydrodynamic bearings, a lubricant layer is built up in the contact region such that the two surfaces are completely separated. Examples of these are hydrodynamic journal and thrust bearings. These types of bearing are major components in many large machines, including hydroelectric turbines. Their safe operation relies on the maintaining of sufficient oil film thickness. As long as this condition is met, the bearing could continue to do its job indefinitely. This is particularly important during transient operating conditions (i. e. rapid changes in load or speed) when oil films can momentarily become extremely thin. Such conditions have been examined for a tilting-pad thrust bearing to assess impact on operation. More and more onerous demands are being placed on such bearings and their associated methods of lubrication, e. g. increased frequency of start/stop of hydroelectric turbines. This means that new solutions are required to maximise their operational performance. One such solution attracting current attention is the employment of surface texturing. The impact of surface texturing on the performance of a tilting-pad thrust bearing has been studied in a series of tests in comparison with a plain Babbitt surface. These show a reduction in friction with the textured bearing. Film thickness is seen to be greater suggesting improved load-carrying capacity. Another possible option for improving operational performance is the use of new lubricants. Environmentally Adapted Lubricants (EALs) are produced from simple hydrocarbons meaning that the final product tends to consist of only a few different types of molecule. This also means that an EAL can be carefully tailored to a specific function. In several experimental investigations using such fluids in both thrust and journal bearings, it has been shown that minimum film thicknesses can be maintained using an EAL with lower viscosity grade than that of the mineral oil currently used. This has the added impact of reducing bearing power (friction) losses and lowering temperatures, all beneficial to bearing operation. Thicker film has been found for an EAL of identical viscosity grade to the mineral oil. Unlike mineral oils, which have been employed as lubricants for decades, little data is available for the long-term performance of EALs. This is of interest as their use has only recently begun to catch on in the power generation industry. A study of aged EALs in a tin bronze-steel contact, typical of what may be found in hydroelectric turbines, has shown continued satisfactory performance even at high acid number (high oxidation level), beyond the point where an oil would normally be changed out. The introduction of new materials provides a means of solving certain problems associated with machine operation and reliability. The use of PTFE as a bearing facing material is well established but little has been published about its performance in this application. A series of experiments have been performed to investigate the impact of employing such a facing on a tilting-pad thrust bearing. A thicker minimum film is found at the outlet edge of the pads in comparison with a <b>babbit</b> (white <b>metal)</b> faced bearing. Temperatures within the pad bulk material are seen to be lower as a result of the insulating effects of the polymer, thereby reducing the impact of thermal crowning. An investigation has also been performed with a range of PTFE composite materials to assess their suitability as a replacement for babbitt facing material in hydrodynamic journal bearings. The polymer composites have been shown to introduce clear benefits in comparison with pure PTFE and babbitt in terms of reduced wear and break-away friction at start-up.
