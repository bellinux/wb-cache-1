5|$|Burying beetles are {{attentive}} parents, {{and participate}} in cooperative care and feeding of their offspring. Both parents work to bury small animal carcass {{to serve as a}} food resource for their young and build a <b>brood</b> <b>chamber</b> around it. The parents prepare the carcass and protect it from competitors and from early decomposition. After their eggs hatch, the parents keep the larvae clean of fungus and bacteria and help the larvae feed by regurgitating food for them.|$|E
25|$|In a few species, {{the sperm}} swim into the female's mouth, {{fertilizing}} the eggs within her body, where they remain during early development stages. In moon jellies, the eggs lodge in pits on the oral arms, which form a temporary <b>brood</b> <b>chamber</b> for the developing planula larvae.|$|E
500|$|The seven free {{segments}} of the thorax each bear a pair of unbranched pereopods (limbs). In most species these are used for locomotion and are of much the same size, morphology and orientation, giving the order its name [...] "Isopoda", from the Greek equal foot. In a few species, the front pair are modified into gnathopods with clawed, gripping terminal segments. The pereopods are not used in respiration, as are the equivalent limbs in amphipods, but the coxae (first segments) are fused to the tergites (dorsal plates) to form epimera (side plates). In mature females, {{some or all of}} the limbs have appendages known as oostegites which fold underneath the thorax and form a <b>brood</b> <b>chamber</b> for the eggs. In males, the gonopores (genital openings) are on the ventral surface of segment eight and in the females, they are in a similar position on segment six.|$|E

40|$|Offspring {{quality of}} decapod {{crustaceans}} {{has been widely}} studied, with special emphasis on the sources of variability determining embryonic and larval quality. Nevertheless, maternal provisioning has commonly been overlooked as a potential source of offspring within-brood variability. In the present study, the existence of variable maternal provisioning was assessed through {{the analysis of the}} fatty acid (FA) profile of newly extruded embryos from different regions of the <b>brooding</b> <b>chamber</b> of Homarus gammarus. Significant differences in the FA profile of embryos sampled from different pleopods and sides of the <b>brooding</b> <b>chamber</b> were recorded. Significant deviations of the overall mean of each surveyed female were also observed for essential FA, particularly 20 : 4 n- 6, 20 : 5 n- 3 and 22 : 6 n- 3. Lipid energy available to fuel embryogenesis also varied among embryos sampled from different regions of the <b>brooding</b> <b>chamber.</b> Results suggest variable female investment at oocyte production, which may be amplified during the incubation period of developing embryos by differential lipid catabolism. For the first time, maternal provisioning is evidenced as an additional source for within-brood variability in the FA profile of embryos...|$|R
5000|$|The female beetle excavates {{a tunnel}} in {{the bark of}} a host tree and creates a <b>brood</b> <b>chamber.</b> Any resin that accumulates is mixed with frass (droppings) and pushed out of the tunnel, {{creating}} a purplish-brown mass known as a resin tube. A hundred or more eggs are laid in the <b>brood</b> <b>chamber</b> and the female moves on, either creating another <b>brood</b> <b>chamber</b> near the first or exiting the tree and starting again.|$|E
50|$|Once a nest site is found, the {{existing}} cavity must be cleaned. After the pre-existing container {{is ready to}} be inhabited, the workers build several horizontal brood combs {{in the center of the}} nest. This <b>brood</b> <b>chamber</b> is surrounded by layers of cerumen, called the involucrum, which helps maintain a constant climate in the <b>brood</b> <b>chamber.</b>|$|E

50|$|Clubiona robusta or the stout sac spider is {{a common}} spider found in Australia. Females are often found living in a silken <b>brooding</b> <b>chamber,</b> under bark of {{eucalyptus}} trees. They are small sized spiders. Body length 13 mm for females, 10 mm for males.|$|R
50|$|Spinozooids form {{defensive}} spines, {{and sometimes}} appear {{on top of}} autozooids. Gonozooids act as <b>brood</b> <b>chambers</b> for fertilized eggs.

40|$|Pennipora anomalopora (UBAGHS, 1858) is an erect {{branching}} {{species of}} cyclostome bryozoan (Family Cerioporidae BUSK) found rarely {{and only in}} the Maastrichtian of the Maastricht region. A large and spectacular colony was discovered in 1994 by Fred Michon in the Meerssen Mbr of the Maastricht Fm in the ENCI NV Quarry. This may be the largest Mesozoic cyclostome colony ever found. The branches have well-developed monticules, and sectioned branches reveal the characteristic difference in orientation between autozooecia and kenozooecia, as well as numerous <b>brood</b> <b>chambers</b> which are partially subdivided by internal septa-like walls. Dark growth bands observed within the endozone of a longitudinally sectioned branch are an average of 2. 9 mm apart. These bands appear to coincide with levels of <b>brood</b> <b>chambers</b> in the exozone. If larval brooding occurred annually then a distal branch growth rate of about 3 mm per year can be inferred, indicating that the colony lived for more than 35 years...|$|R

5000|$|When the spat (larvae) {{leave the}} <b>brooding</b> <b>chamber,</b> {{they begin to}} develop an eye spot and a foot. They then migrate to hard {{surfaces}} (usually old oyster shells) where they attach by secreting a [...] "glue" [...] like substance from their byssus gland. Ostrea lurida spat swim with their foot superior {{to the rest of}} their body. This swimming position causes the larvae to attach to the underside of horizontal surfaces.|$|R
40|$|Many marine invertebrates, {{including}} many sponge species, reproduce by spermcast spawning, in which sperm released externally disperse {{in the water}} column to fertilize eggs retained internally by the maternal adult. The population consequences of a sexual reproduction mode that depends upon uptake of free spermatozoa from dilute suspension {{in the water column}} are not yet well understood. In the spermcast-spawning tropical demosponge Amphimedon queenslandica, we observed continuous fertilization and development in healthy maternal <b>brood</b> <b>chambers.</b> This results in a constant release of larvae into the water column. On average in our study population on Heron Island reef, a hermaphroditic adult will have 45 potential sperm donors available within a 4 m radius to fertilize the eggs retained within its <b>brood</b> <b>chambers.</b> A single adult may brood more than 300 embryos at one time, and all stages of development are always represented. These data can be explained by adult sponges releasing a steady trickle supply of sperm into the water column, perhaps in combination with the existence of a mechanism for sperm storage or post-fertilization developmental stasis in this species...|$|R
5|$|Males attract mates by {{constructing}} specially-shaped tunnels {{in which}} they sing. Mating {{takes place in the}} male's burrow; the male may widen a tunnel {{to make room for the}} female to mount, though in some species mating is tail-to-tail. Females lay their eggs either in their normal burrows or in specially-dug <b>brood</b> <b>chambers</b> which are sealed when complete in the case of the genus Neoscapteriscus or not sealed in the case of genera Gryllotalpa and Neocurtilla.|$|R
50|$|Begin the 1st {{application}} of a treatment by placing appropriate number of bee-hive strips (positions shown in Fig. 1) on top of combs of the <b>brood</b> <b>chamber</b> (upper <b>brood</b> <b>chamber</b> if two). Bee-hive strips should be close to, but not directly over open or sealed brood (preferable distance > 4 cm).Close the hive, leaving space (about 5 mm) between the bee-hive strips and the hive cover to improve the evaporation of thymol.Do not place plastic cover foils directly on the bee-hive strips. Remove the 1st set of depleted THYMOVAR wafers after 3-4 weeks.|$|E
50|$|All stingless bees of {{the tribe}} Meliponini build cells in a <b>brood</b> <b>chamber</b> within the nest; unlike bees of other tribes. They do not reuse these brood cells but {{constantly}} build new cells. The <b>brood</b> <b>chamber</b> is surrounded by the involucrum, which is a multilayered envelope. T. hockingsi constructs brood combs during the Provisioning and Ovipositioning Process (POP). First, workers construct a new brood cell and provision the cell with liquid food. Next, the queen lays an egg in the provisioned cell {{on top of the}} food. Finally, the workers cap and seal the brood cell, and the POP is complete.|$|E
50|$|Prodajus ostendensis is a {{parasitic}} isopod found {{living on}} Gastrosaccus spinifer. It {{clings to the}} opossum shrimp's carapace near the junction of the cephalothorax and abdomen and resembles a fleshy growth or may occupy the host's <b>brood</b> <b>chamber.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Olympia oyster spawns {{between the}} months of May and August, when the water reaches {{temperatures}} above 14 degrees Celsius. During the oyster's first spawning cycle they will act as a male and then switch between sexes during their following spawning cycles. The males release their spermatozoa from their mantle cavity {{in the form of}} sperm balls. These balls dissolve in the water into free floating sperm. The female's eggs are fertilized in the mantle cavity (<b>brooding</b> <b>chamber)</b> when spermatozoa are filtered into her gill slits from the surrounding water. The fertilized eggs will then move into the branchial chamber (mantle cavity). The fertilized eggs will develop into veliger larvae and will stay in the females mantle cavity for 10-12 days for further development. On the first day the larvae develop into a blastulae (mass of cells with a center cavity), on day two they develop into a gastrulae (hollow two layered sac), on the third day they develop into trochophore (free-swimming, conciliated larvae), on the fourth day the valves on the dorsal surface become defined. During the rest of development in the <b>brooding</b> <b>chamber</b> the valves complete and a straight-hinged veliger larva grows.|$|R
50|$|When {{the eggs}} hatch, the larvae feed gregariously, chewing {{their way in}} a broad front and packing in their frass behind them. There are five larval instars and when the larvae are fully developed, they create {{individual}} pupal chambers in the frass and pupate. The total development time varies with temperature and may be one to three years. The new adults may stay under the bark, mining new tunnels and creating new <b>brood</b> <b>chambers,</b> or they may emerge into the open air. Several females may mine the same area and their excavations may coalesce.|$|R
5000|$|Histachii are savage {{creatures who}} were once human prisoners, but were {{transformed}} into reptillian-humanoids by their yuan-ti captors via the drinking of a potion of yuan-ti venom mixed with other ingredients.

Those too old or stupid to be of any use, or those too powerful for the yuan-ti to control, are left on the surface to rot and die.|$|R
50|$|The {{mantle cavity}} {{functions}} as a respiratory chamber in most molluscs. In bivalves it is usually part of the feeding structure. In some molluscs the mantle cavity is a <b>brood</b> <b>chamber,</b> and in cephalopods and some bivalves such as scallops, it is a locomotory organ.|$|E
50|$|In modern {{removable}} frame hives the nursery area {{is in the}} <b>brood</b> <b>chamber,</b> which beekeepers prefer {{to be in the}} bottom box. In the late winter and early spring as the brood cycle begins, the queen starts to lay eggs within the winter cluster in proximity to available honey stores. Honey bees tend to greatly expand the <b>brood</b> <b>chamber</b> as the season progresses. The relative location of the <b>brood</b> <b>chamber</b> within the beehive may also change as bee keepers add more boxes or as wild bees build fresh comb into available cavities. Some beekeepers ensure that the queen will not go into the upper boxes (called supers or honey supers) by placing a screen called a queen excluder between the boxes. The screen has precisely measured open spaces through which a worker bee can pass, but not a queen. Some beekeepers do not use excluders, but try to keep the queen within the intended brood area by keeping a honey barrier of capped honey, which the queen is reluctant to cross, above the brood. In feral hives the honey bees tend to put the brood at bottom center of the cavity, and honey to the sides and above the brood, so beekeepers are trying to follow the natural tendency of the bees.|$|E
50|$|It is {{recommended}} that new or recycled empty bars be placed at {{each side of the}} <b>brood</b> <b>chamber</b> just before spring build - up as it is easier for the bees to make new comb than to move honey stores to make room for new brood. This will also ensure the maintenance of a well built honey barrier between the brood and higher grade stores. To prevent the buildup of old comb in the <b>brood</b> <b>chamber</b> it may be advantageous to add new bars only on the entrance side of the <b>brood</b> <b>chamber</b> just past the pollen stores. This will cause a collection of older honey in re-used comb, which may be removed and used to produce a somewhat lesser quality of honey, as it will have additional flavors from the propolis used to strengthen and protect the brood comb. Such honey may be especially appropriate for making mead and root beer, as additional flavors will predominate. The progressive removal of brood comb appears, as noted above, consistent with control of AFB. The use of follower boards to selectively control the amount of interior space available to the bees can be helpful, particularly in young hives or when dealing with newly captured swarms.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{documented}} a commensal {{association between}} two phylogenetically distant ant subfamilies (Ponerinae and Myrmicinae). The host (Platythyrea conradti) and its tiny guest (Pyramica maynei) {{nest in the}} same hollow branches in West African forests. <b>Brood</b> <b>chambers</b> are adjacent but separate, and the guest scavenges on prey remains of the host, which may benefit from improved nest hygiene. Two mated dealate queens of Pyramica were collected in one small Platythyrea nest, suggesting that they can hunt (non-claustral foundation) in the safe environment provided. An experiment showed that the guest can survive alone {{and was able to}} hunt collembolans...|$|R
50|$|The larvae feed {{on living}} insects that the females paralyze and carry to the {{underground}} nest. The females of these digger waps store several grasshoppers in a nest. They dig a 15 cm long corridor, with various <b>brood</b> <b>chambers,</b> {{in each of}} which one prey is stored with an egg. The preys are normally orthopteran insects, particularly nymphs of locusts or katydids. After three to four days, the eggs hatch and after another 18 days, the larvae are fully grown. Adults fly in July and August. They feed on the nectar of flowers (Apiaceae, Euphorbiaceae, etc.).|$|R
5000|$|Gould {{responded that}} critics ignore that later {{selective}} value {{is a separate}} issue from origination as necessary consequences of structure; he summarised {{his use of the}} term 'spandrel' in 1997: [...] "Evolutionary biology needs such an explicit term for features arising as byproducts, rather than adaptations, whatever their subsequent exaptive utility... Causes of historical origin must always be separated from current utilities; their conflation has seriously hampered the evolutionary analysis of form in the history of life." [...] Gould cites the masculinized genitalia of female hyenas and the <b>brooding</b> <b>chamber</b> of some snails as examples of evolutionary spandrels.|$|R

5000|$|Jan Dzierzon {{described}} the correct distance between combs in the <b>brood</b> <b>chamber</b> as 1Â½ {{inches from the}} center of one bar {{to the center of the}} next.

5000|$|The {{entrance}} and surrounding areas of their nest are {{coated with a}} smooth, thick layer of black, red, or yellow cerumen, a material formed by mixing beeswax (a glandular secretion of worker bees) with propolis. [...] They lack external entrance tunnels. T. carbonaria builds brood cells arranged in combs or semicombs. The cells are a single layer of hexagonal combs that are built in a spiral. They are vertically elongated and in a regular vertical orientation. They are built out of brown cerumen, and house the eggs and larvae. New cells {{are added to the}} brood by the advancing front. The nest cavity may be sealed off from adjoining cavities by a hard batumen layer of cerumen or field-collected material. The <b>brood</b> <b>chamber</b> is centered in the hive, which makes T. carbonaria suitable for hive propagation. The <b>brood</b> <b>chamber</b> is also made up of multiple horizontal layers which allow for easy division of the brood comb.|$|E
5|$|Lifespans {{range from}} 3 to over 30years. Adults of most species are of one sex {{throughout}} their lives. The gonads are masses of developing gametes (ova or sperm), and most species have four gonads, two in each valve. Those of articulates {{lie in the}} channels of the mantle lobes, while those of inarticulates lie near the gut. Ripe gametes float into the main coelom and then exit into the mantle cavity via the metanephridia, which open {{on either side of}} the mouth. Most species release both ova and sperm into the water, but females of some species keep the embryos in <b>brood</b> <b>chambers</b> until the larvae hatch.|$|R
50|$|Some species eject unfertilized ova {{into the}} water, while others keep their ova in <b>brood</b> <b>chambers</b> until they hatch, {{and some of}} these species use placenta-like organs to nourish the {{developing}} eggs. After hatching, the larvae swim for a short time and then settle on a surface. There they metamorphose, and the larval gut rotates by up to 180Â°, so that the mouth and anus face upwards. Both colonial and solitary species also reproduce by cloning â solitary species grow clones in the space between the tentacles and then release them when developed, while colonial ones produce new members from the stalks or from corridor-like stolons.|$|R
5|$|Almost {{all species}} are hermaphrodites, {{in other words}} each {{individual}} can function as both male and female. Some are simultaneous hermaphrodites, which can produce both eggs and sperm at the same time, while others are sequential hermaphrodites, in which the eggs and sperm mature at different times. The gonads {{are located in the}} parts of the internal canal network under the comb rows, and eggs and sperm are released via pores in the epidermis. Fertilization is generally external, but platyctenids use internal fertilization and keep the eggs in <b>brood</b> <b>chambers</b> until they hatch. Self-fertilization has occasionally been seen in species of the genus Mnemiopsis, and it is thought that most of the hermaphroditic species are self-fertile.|$|R
