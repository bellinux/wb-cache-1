40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to analyze Indiana {{statutes}} affecting contract rights of public school teachers and to determine documenting procedures a public school administrator performs to challenge a right to a continuing contract. The analysis of current Indiana statutes in effect as of July 1, 1982 provided a comprehensive review of the following: <b>basic</b> <b>components</b> of <b>contract</b> forms, grounds for contract termination, contract termination procedures, evaluation timelines and a description of documentation components. A survey instrument collected data regarding documentation procedures administrators perform. Twenty-one administrators from seven Indiana school corporations, responded. Changing state statutes governing teacher contracts are most complex and greatly affect the function of the administrative documentation. The statutes provide protection to the teacher and administrators must turn to effective collection and use of multiple types of evidence to support decision making. Recommendations for future research include a regular updating of information relevant to obligations for teacher and development of effective strategies of evidence collection and use for public school administrators.

40|$|We {{introduce}} a composite (CP) contract for a two-stage supply chain by organically combining two component contracts: a buy back (BB) contract and a quantity flexibility (QF) contract. The CP contract {{is shown to}} have advantages over both <b>component</b> <b>contracts</b> in terms of supply chain coordination, profit allocation, and risk allocation. In particular, we obtain the following results: (a) {{as long as one}} of the <b>component</b> <b>contracts</b> is able to coordinate the supply chain, so is the CP contract. Moreover, when contract parameters are constrained, we find situations where the CP contract coordinates the supply chain when neither of the <b>component</b> <b>contracts</b> coordinates. (b) When contract parameters are constrained, the CP contract is more flexible in terms of profit allocation among supply chain members than the <b>component</b> <b>contracts.</b> (c) The CP contract is more flexible in terms of risk allocation than the <b>component</b> <b>contracts.</b> Supply chain management Contract design Coordination Profit allocation Risk allocation...|$|R

We {{propose a}} {{classification}} {{for a set}} of linearly recursive func-tions, which can be expressed as instances of a skeleton for parallel linear recursion, and present new parallel implementations for them. This set in-cludes well known higher-order functions, like Broadcast, Reduction and Scan, which we call <b>basic</b> <b>components.</b> Many compositions of these <b>basic</b> <b>components</b> are also linearly recursive functions; we present transformation rules from compositions of up to three <b>basic</b> <b>components</b> to instances of our skeleton. The advantage of this approach is that these instances have better parallel implementations than the compositions of the individual implemen-tations of the corresponding <b>basic</b> <b>components.</b> ...|$|R
