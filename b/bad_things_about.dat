500|$|With fellow Scientology {{attorney}} Helena Kobrin, Moxon {{filed an}} affidavit in Pinellas-Pasco Circuit Court in March 2000, complaining {{to the judge}} about the criminal prosecution of the Church of Scientology related {{to the death of}} Lisa McPherson. They claimed that the prosecution held an [...] "extreme religious bias" [...] and a [...] "narrow-minded concept of a church". They defended the practice of the Scientology staffers that had kept Lisa McPherson at the Fort Harrison Hotel in Clearwater, Florida, asserting they had been involved in the [...] "Introspection Rundown", which they called an [...] "entirely religious" [...] practice developed by Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard. They wrote that [...] "Forcing a Scientologist to receive psychiatric services would be like forcing an Orthodox Jew to eat pork or forcing a devoted Catholic to have an abortion. It is simply unacceptable and unthinkable to our religious faith and conscience." [...] Moxon said that the wrongful death lawsuit filed by members of McPherson's family against the Church of Scientology was [...] "nothing more than a vehicle to say <b>bad</b> <b>things</b> <b>about</b> the church". The criminal prosecution in the Lisa McPherson case was dropped due to issues with record-keeping by the medical examiner; a wrongful death civil suit was settled in 2004.|$|E
500|$|During the 2016 Republican primaries, McCain said {{he would}} support the Republican nominee {{even if it was}} Donald Trump, but {{following}} Mitt Romney's March 3 speech, McCain endorsed the sentiments expressed in that speech, saying he had serious concerns about Trump's [...] "uninformed and indeed dangerous statements on national security issues". [...] Relations between the two had been fraught since early in the Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016, when McCain referred to a room full of Trump supporters as [...] "crazies", and the real estate mogul then said of McCain: [...] "He insulted me, and he insulted everyone in that room... He is a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren't captured... perhaps he was a war hero, but right now he's said a lot of very <b>bad</b> <b>things</b> <b>about</b> a lot of people." [...] Following Trump becoming the presumptive nominee of the party on May 3, McCain said that Republican voters had spoken and he would support Trump. [...] McCain himself faced a primary challenge from Kelli Ward, a fervent Trump supporter, and then was expected to face a potentially strong challenge from Democratic Congresswoman Ann Kirkpatrick in the general election. The senator privately expressed worry over the effect that Trump's unpopularity among Hispanic voters might have on his own chances but also was concerned with more conservative pro-Trmp voters; he thus kept his endorsement of Trump in place but tried to speak of him as little as possible given their disagreements. [...] However McCain defeated Ward in the primary by a double-digit percentage point margin and gained a similar lead over Kirkpatrick in general election polls, and when the Donald Trump Access Hollywood controversy broke, he felt secure enough to on October 8 withdraw his endorsement of Trump. McCain stated that Trump's [...] "demeaning comments about women and his boasts about sexual assaults" [...] made it [...] "impossible to continue to offer even conditional support" [...] and added that he would not vote for Hillary Clinton, but would instead [...] "write in the name of some good conservative Republican who is qualified to be president." [...] McCain, now 80 years of age, went on to defeat Kirkpatrick, securing a sixth term as United States States Senator from Arizona.|$|E
