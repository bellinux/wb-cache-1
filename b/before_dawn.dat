5|$|A given flower is {{open only}} for a single day, opening <b>before</b> <b>dawn</b> and closing in the afternoon.

While many insects visit the flowers, only some bees actually accomplish pollination. V.thapsus flowering period lasts from June to August in most of its range, extending to September or October in warmer climates. Visitors include halictid bees and hoverflies.
