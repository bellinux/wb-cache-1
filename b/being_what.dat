25|$|A Carnatic {{composition}} {{really has}} two elements, one being the musical element, the other <b>being</b> <b>what</b> is conveyed in the composition.

In addition to the rich musical experience, each composition brings out the knowledge and personality of the composer, and hence the words {{are as important as}} the musical element itself. This poses a special challenge for the musicians because rendering this music does not involve just playing or singing the correct musical notes; the musicians are expected to understand what was conveyed by the composer in various languages, and sing musical phrases that act to create the effect that was intended by the composer in his/her composition.|$|E
25|$|In 1999, {{with the}} ratings not <b>being</b> <b>what</b> WFAN {{management}} expected, the Salzberg/Somers show was cancelled and {{both men were}} fired. However a large outcry from listeners over the termination of the popular Somers—including comedian Jerry Seinfeld, a native of Long Island—led to WFAN management giving Somers the evening shift, which (despite frequent pre-emptions for live games) he continues to hold to the present day. In middays, Salzberg and Somers were replaced by Suzyn Waldman and Jody McDonald. Waldman had been with WFAN since its infancy, as {{she was the first}} update anchor, and had served as the station's Yankees beat reporter and the Knicks' studio host. McDonald, son of a former Mets general manager and also one of the original WFAN personalities, was the weekend overnight host before leaving for sister station WIP in Philadelphia, nearer to his southern New Jersey home. Both Waldman and McDonald had their fans and detractors at WFAN.|$|E

MACV-SOG also wanted to sponsor a guerrilla base zone east of the Bolovens Plateau between it and the Vietnamese border. By September 1965, MACV-SOG had overcome Sullivan's misgivings concerning Lao neutrality, and had Operation Shining Brass patrols probing the Ho Chi Minh trail from South Vietnam.|$|E

25|$|What ontological hermeneutics {{is saying}} is here that the {{therapist}} strives to avoid an attitude of “expert” or “specialist” on human suffering and healing. Even though many mainstream counseling theories assume such roles, the position of ontological hermeneutics is that such roles create a conflict between freedom and commitment for the client and should therefore be avoided. In fact, hermeneutic theory states that such positions are nonexistent. Therefore, therapist does not intervene with objective truths that are intended to disprove the client’s previously perpetuated ways of thinking and feeling. Fusing horizons “is, instead, a matter of integrating another’s horizon {{in such a way}} that the one’s own outlook is changed in the process”) so that both therapist and client are thus both authentically benefited. And, ontological hermeneutics holds that this process is only possible via authentic dialogue during which both therapist and client utilize their memory and imagination to develop therapeutic possibilities. Furthermore, through this process, empathy is seen as a deeper phenomenon (intropathy) for relating to others; the entire process <b>being</b> <b>what</b> may be referred to as empathic envisioning, and compels therapists to become subjective in their value-laden conversations.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the reasons}} the works of Josephus were copied and {{maintained}} by Christians was that his writings provided a good deal of information about a number of figures mentioned in the New Testament, and the background to events such as the death of James during a gap in Roman governing authority. Because manuscript transmission was done by hand-copying, typically by monastic scribes, almost all ancient texts have been subject to both accidental and deliberate alterations, emendations (called interpolation) or elisions. Both the lack of any original corroborating manuscript source outside the Christian tradition as well as the practice of Christian interpolation has led to the scholarly debate regarding the authenticity of Josephus' references to Jesus in his work. Although {{there is no doubt that}} most (but not all) of the later copies of the Antiquities contained references to Jesus and John the Baptist, it cannot be definitively shown that these were original to Josephus writings. Much of the scholarly work concerning the references to Jesus in Josephus has concentrated on close textual analysis of the Josephan corpus to determine the degree to which the language, as preserved in both early Christian quotations and the later transmissions, should be considered authentic. However, based on the general expectation of what Josephus would have written on Jesus and the actual statements made by Origen and Jerome, the version used by Michael the Syrian and Agapius (see below, Arabic and Syriac Josephus), the neutral reconstruction of the text has a reasonable probability of <b>being</b> <b>what</b> Josephus actually wrote as they would have had access to earlier copies of the Testimonium.|$|E
25|$|In 1990, Viki {{is elected}} mayor of Llanview, but a {{shooting}} and subsequent stroke leaves her paralyzed {{and in a}} wheelchair; Niki Smith emerges to aid a paralyzed Viki stand up and shoot Johnny Dee Hesser (Anthony Crivello) when he attacks Tina. Viki recovers and later donates a kidney to daughter Megan suffering terminal lupus, but Megan dies, leaving Viki devastated. Growing ever-distant from Clint, Viki engages an extramarital affair with Sloan Carpenter (Roy Thinnes); she and Clint divorce in 1994, and she marries Sloan. Sloan dies soon after from Hodgkin's lymphoma, just as {{the existence of a}} second child of Victor and Irene's is revealed. Viki's stress reaches a critical point when Dorian (Robin Strasser onward) tells Viki a secret of which she thought Viki had been aware: the fact that Victor had sexually abused his daughter as a child. With this trauma <b>being</b> <b>what</b> had actually initiated Viki's dissociative identity disorder, she subsequently splinters into several personalities, one of which imprisons Dorian in a secret room below Llanfair. Dorian is eventually freed from her confinement, and Viki recovers after realizing she herself (more specifically, one of her alternate personalities) {{was the one who had}} smothered Victor to death in 1976. In 1995, reviled town outcast Todd Manning (Roger Howarth) is proven to be Victor and Irene's illegitimate son; Viki and Todd eventually become close. After a failed reconciliation attempt with Clint, Viki meets and falls in love with Ben Davidson (Mark Derwin), who is eventually revealed to be the long-lost son of Asa Buchanan (Philip Carey) and Renée Divine Buchanan (Patricia Elliott). Ben's first wife, Skye Chandler (Robin Christopher), comes to town and tries in vain to keep Ben and Viki apart.|$|E

500|$|The {{development}} team decided that, as with And Then There Were None, {{they would}} change Christie's original ending for Murder on the Orient Express. The {{aim of the}} developers was to create games that would not only appeal to casual gamers, but also to Christie fans.

The novel has two solutions [...] one <b>being</b> <b>what</b> appears to be happening and the other <b>being</b> <b>what</b> is actually occurring [...] and the developers aimed to develop a third solution which drew on these two solutions and still surprised the player. Lee Sheldon admitted that his variation to the ending of And Then There Were None received some criticism, and said that in Murder on the Orient Express changing the ending was even harder because of the sheer fame {{of the book and}} its solution. He also expressed his hatred of adaptations of older material which make fun of that time period, and said {{that he was trying to}} stay as faithful to Christie's work and time era as possible.|$|E
