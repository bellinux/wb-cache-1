5000|$|Graffiti {{serves as}} a status symbol in Lethem’s Brooklyn. Often, the tags served as a new {{identity}} for the artists, as shown in Part 3 of the novel, when Mingus is referred to almost solely by his tag name Dose. Dylan, though he dabbles {{in the world of}} graffiti art with Mingus, never develops his own tag name but instead uses Mingus' name Dose in an effort to further merge himself with his best friend. [...] "Things are radically simplified: the white kid's stopped looking for his own moniker, been encouraged by the <b>black</b> <b>kid</b> to throw up his perfect replication of the <b>black</b> <b>kid's</b> tag instead. Dose, Dose, Dose. It's a happy solution for both. The <b>black</b> <b>kid</b> gets to see his tag spread further, in search of bragging points for ubiquity, that bottom-line standard for a graffiti writer's success[...] [...] [...] What's in it for the white kid? Well, he's been allowed to merge his identity in this way with the <b>black</b> <b>kid's,</b> to lose his funkymusicwhiteboy geekdom in the illusion that he and his friend Mingus Rude are both Dose, no more and no less. A team, a united front, a brand name, an idea." [...] (pg. 136) Arthur, on the other hand, strives to distinguish himself with the tag name Art, but never reaches the level of importance that Mingus achieves. In later years, Mingus’ talent for graffiti art carries him through his years of prison as both a source of income and pride. Graffiti art is also juxtaposed with the avant-garde art of Dylan’s father, Abraham.|$|R

[...] As of October 2007, the city of Omaha, the 42nd largest in the country, has the fifth highest percentage of low-income African Americans in the country. Census data from 2000 in Douglas County show more than 7,800 families live below the poverty line, about 6.7 percent of families. The percentage of black children in Omaha who live in poverty rank ranks number one in the United States, with nearly six of 10 <b>black</b> <b>kids</b> living below the poverty line.

2500|$|Throughout his career, Mahal has {{performed}} his brand of blues (an African American artform) for {{a predominantly white}} audience. This has been a disappointment at times for Mahal, who recognizes {{there is a general}} lack of interest in blues music among many African Americans today. He has drawn a parallel comparison between the blues and rap music in that they both were initially black forms of music that have come to be assimilated into the mainstream of society. He is quoted as saying, [...] "Eighty-one percent of the kids listening to rap were not <b>black</b> <b>kids.</b> Once there was a tremendous amount of money involved in it... they totally moved it over to a material side. It just went off to a terrible direction." [...] Mahal also believes that some people may think the blues are about wallowing in negativity and despair, a position he disagrees with. According to him, [...] "You can listen to my music from front to back, and you don't ever hear me moaning and crying about how bad you done treated me. I think that style of blues and that type of tone was something that happened as a result of many white people feeling very, very guilty about what went down." ...|$|E

2500|$|After Suede disbanded {{at the end}} of 2003, Anderson asked Suede's manager Charlie Charlton for Butler's phone number, who soon {{informed}} the former guitarist to expect a call. The pair, who had not spoken to one another since 1994, were spotted drinking in London just four days after Suede's final gig. In 2004, they resurfaced with a project named The Tears. The following year they released the album Here Come the Tears, which was well received by critics. Despite making the UK Top 15, it failed to generate broader interest beyond their hardcore fanbase. One review remarked that the record was not [...] "far from the records Suede made without their errant guitarist". The band has not worked since 2006. Anderson has released four solo albums: Brett Anderson (2007), Wilderness (2008), Slow Attack (2009) and Black Rainbows (2011); with the exception of his latest effort, his discography has garnered a mixed reaction. Butler has been working as a producer, collaborating with artists such as <b>Black</b> <b>Kids,</b> Sons and Daughters, Duffy and Kate Nash. Simon Gilbert played with local Bangkok band Futon, while Richard Oakes started working with Sean McGhee in a duo called Artmagic, whose debut album Become The One You Love, was released in 2012. Mat Osman started working as editor of the email magazine le cool and the editor of their London guidebook.|$|E
