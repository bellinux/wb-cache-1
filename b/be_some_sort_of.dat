Hearing possible clicks while {{on the phone with}} Mulder, she frantically searches her hotel room for monitoring devices. When Mulder knocks at her door, Scully fires her weapon at it and runs off. Mulder believes her to be suffering from paranoid psychosis. The Lone Gunmen believe {{the device to}} <b>be</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> subliminal mind control device. Mulder was not affected due to his color blindness. The police find a body they believe to be that of Scully, but Mulder confirms that it is not her. Mulder is unable to contact Scully's mother, leading him to go to her house. He finds Scully there, who aims a gun at him. Scully claims Mulder never trusted her and blames him for her abduction and her sister's murder. Scully's mother calms her down, and she is hospitalized.|$|E
5|$|Skanderbeg's {{primary reason}} for allying with Alfonso was his fear of 21-year-old Mehmed II, whose {{ambition}} was to reconquer Justinian I's empire which stretched from Syria to Spain. Mehmed had been planning a campaign against Albania since Skanderbeg had defeated his father at Krujë in 1450. Another factor was that Krujë geographically dominated Durazzo, which was only 150 kilometers from Brindisi, the nearest Italian port. Mehmed's ambitions were symmetrical to Alfonso's {{and it was clear}} that there would <b>be</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> clash between the two in Albania, the epicenter of the conflict. Mehmed {{was one of the first}} monarchs since Roman times to keep a massive centralized army under his personal control. Besides controlling a huge army, Mehmed was widely acknowledged for his far-reaching wisdom which allowed him to produce a highly advanced military armed with the newest models of the cannon.|$|E

25|$|The Hartig net {{initially}} forms {{from the}} fully differentiated inner {{layer of the}} mantle, and penetration occurs in a broad front oriented transversally to the root axis, rather than from a single hyphae. As the hyphae contact the root cells and digest through the apoplastic space, some spruce (Picea abies) and eucalyptus (Eucalyptus globulus) cells {{have been shown to}} produce chitinases and peroxidases that could inhibit Hartig net formation. Some plant cells exhibit transcripts for stress- and defense-related proteins such as pathogenesis-related and hypersensitive response-induced proteins. However, extensive root colonization still occurs in these plants, and the association {{does not seem to be}} met with massive cell death associated with pathogen limitation or defense gene activation. In fact, as the relationship develops in a compatible manner, these hallmarks of resistance seem to diminish by about day 21 after colonization. Thus, there must <b>be</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> defense response suppression by the EcM fungi, though details concerning its nature and mechanisms have yet to be determined.|$|E

[...] Britpop artists' new approach was inspired by Blur's tour of the United States {{in the spring of}} 1992.

[...] Other people tend to get patronized on one end or the other—and I'll take it. I have a very happy life as a novelist. But the story collections I've published are tremendously important to me. And many of the uncollected stories—or yet-to-be-collected stories—are among my proudest writings. They're very closely allied, obviously, to novel writing. But also very distinct, and, you know, there's no need to choose.|$|E
500|$|Eastwood {{worked at}} a number of jobs, {{including}} lifeguard, paper carrier, grocery clerk, forest firefighter, and golf caddy.

Actually, he'd been a lifeguard at Fort Ord in northern California for his entire stint in the military," [...] commented Eastwood's former longtime companion, Sondra Locke. Don Loomis recalled hearing that Eastwood was romancing one of the daughters of a Fort Ord officer, who might have been entreated to watch out for him when names came up for postings.

2500|$|In the 1790s, {{opposition}} {{political parties}} were new and not fully accepted. Government leaders often considered their opponents to <b>be</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> traitors. Historian Ron Chernow reports that Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton and President George Washington [...] "regarded {{much of the}} criticism fired at their administration as disloyal, even treasonous, in nature." [...] When an undeclared Quasi-War broke out with France in 1797–98, [...] "Hamilton increasingly mistook dissent for treason and engaged in hyperbole."

2500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1985, the WWF {{featured}} an angle (a fictional storyline) {{in which all the}} managers in the promotion competed to offer their services to Macho Man Randy Savage. During a match on July 30, 1985 in Poughkeepsie, New York, several managers were at ringside in hopes that he would name one of them as his new manager. After the match, Savage thanked the managers for their consideration and then asked that his new manager come to ringside. An attractive, unnamed woman then came down to the ring, and announcer Bruno Sammartino remarked, [...] "She must <b>be</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> movie star," [...] referring to her glamorous sex appeal. It was later revealed that her name was Miss Elizabeth. Elizabeth's WWF debut aired on the August 24, 1985, edition of WWF Prime Time Wrestling. From that point on, she was the manager of Randy Savage.|$|E
2500|$|In 1967, the Harbour Commission {{initiated}} a study into converting the airport into one {{suitable for the}} passenger jets of the day, such as DC-8s. The island airport runways were too short for jets, so a new airport {{would have to be}} built on new land reclaimed from Lake Ontario. The commission developed this further into a full redevelopment of the islands, whereby a residential development, entitled Harbor City would be built on the existing island airport lands, and a new airport with a runway long enough for jets would be built on a peninsula parallel to the south shore of the Toronto Islands. This plan also outlined {{the development of a new}} harbour, the Outer Harbour east of the Eastern Gap. The plan was later modified to situate the new island airport on the Outer Harbour headland, east of the islands, with road access available from the Gardiner Expressway south along Leslie Street. The Government of Canada ruled out the waterfront site for a major airport early in 1970, although Transport Minister Donald Jamieson suggested there would <b>be</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> expanded airport serving [...] "short-hop, inter-city" [...] flights created.|$|E

[...] The last Anglo-Saxon kingdom to be Christianised, Sussex has a centuries-old reputation for being separate and culturally distinct {{from the rest of}} England. [...] This relative isolation until recent times is due to Sussex's geography, with the sea to the south, the forest and sticky clays of the Weald to the north and coastal marshes to the east and west. Sussex escaped the wholesale rearrangements of life and customs which the Norse invasions brought to much of England and the Germanic culture of the South Saxons remained much more intact than that of the rest of England. The people of Sussex have a reputation for independence of thought [...] and an aversion to being pushed around, as expressed through the Sussex motto, We wunt be druv. [...] The reputation for independence also extends to admiration of the independence of others and toleration of others. [...] Other regional characterisations include the sharp shrewd stubborn Sussex Wealdsman and the more deferential Sussex Downsman.|$|E
