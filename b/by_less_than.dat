5|$|Rubidium and caesium {{are often}} used in atomic clocks. Caesium atomic clocks are {{extraordinarily}} accurate; if a clock had been made {{at the time of}} the dinosaurs, it would be off <b>by</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> four seconds (after 80 million years).

5|$|At {{the start}} of the 20th century, agriculture, timber, and {{ranching}} were the leading economic engines of Texas. This was changed by the boom, which led to rapid industrialization. Though refineries were initially concentrated around the Beaumont and Houston areas, refining operations gradually grew throughout the state {{by the end of the}} 1920s. By 1940, the value of petroleum and natural gas produced in Texas exceeded the value of all agricultural products in the state. The state's GDP grew from approximately $119 million ($ in today's terms) in 1900 to approximately $29 billion ($ in today's terms), a more than 240-fold increase. The U.S. GDP as a whole grew <b>by</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 24 times during the same period.|$|E
5|$|East Stirlingshire's {{traditional}} rival is Falkirk. The club's first match {{known as}} both Britannia and East Stirlingshire were friendly games against Falkirk in 1880 and 1881. Both clubs {{are based in}} Falkirk and have competed {{against each other in}} competitions such as Stirlingshire Cup since the late 19th century. East Stirlingshire was elected to the bottom tier of the Scottish Football League in 1900, closely followed by Falkirk two seasons later in 1902–03. The first competitive league meeting between the clubs ended in a 2–0 win for Falkirk at Merchiston Park in August 1902.

5|$|In Albrecht's {{role with}} the 2012–13 Wolverines team, he never scored more than 7 {{points in a}} game before the NCAA Tournament. In the {{regional}} finals on March 31 against Florida, Michigan built a 13–0 lead and never led <b>by</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 10 {{the rest of the}} game. Several players had career-highs in the game, including Albrecht who had 7 points and 3 steals. The national championship rounds were held at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta, Georgia. In the April 6 national semifinal against Syracuse, Michigan emerged with its thirty-first victory, the most since the 1992–93 team went 31–5. The bench contributed 22 points, including 6 from Albrecht, who raised his NCAA tournament total to 5-for-5 on three-point shots.|$|E
5|$|In {{comparison}} to their 2014 counterpart, the 2015 Bears were more competitive in games; in 2014, {{three of the}} worst losses were by 48, 28 and 21 points, while six of the 2015 team's losses were <b>by</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> a touchdown, two of which ended in overtime. The Bears ended the season 5–3 in away games, but won only once at home, the worst home record in team history. Additionally, the Bears were swept at home by division opponents {{for the first time}} since the NFL realignment in 2002.|$|E
5|$|In the {{regional}} finals on March 31 against Florida, Michigan built a 13–0 lead and never led <b>by</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 10 {{the rest of}} the game. Several players had career-highs in the game: Stauskas with 6 three-point shots, Burke 8 rebounds, McGary 5 steals and off the bench Albrecht 7 points and 3 steals. Eight of McGary's 11 points came as Michigan built the initial 13–0 lead and 5 of Stauskas' 6 three-pointers came as Michigan built a 41–17 lead and closed the half with a 47–30 lead. Burke was named South Regional Tournament Most Outstanding Player. McGary and Stauskas joined Burke on the five-man South All-Regional team. Following {{the regional}} championship postgame prayer and with Mrs. Beilein's consent, McGary and Hardaway gave Beilein a Gatorade shower.|$|E

5|$|Innovations to the {{mechanical}} clock continued, with miniaturization leading to domestic clocks in the 15th century, and personal watches in the 16th. In the 1580s, the Italian polymath Galileo Galilei investigated the regular swing of the pendulum, {{and discovered that}} it could be used to regulate a clock. Although Galileo studied the pendulum as early as 1582, he never actually constructed a clock based on that design. The first pendulum clock was designed and built by Dutch scientist Christiaan Huygens, in 1656. Early versions erred <b>by</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> one minute per day, and later ones only by 10seconds, very accurate for their time.|$|E

5|$|Once the 342 {{individual}} {{images were}} cleaned of cosmic-ray hits and corrected for scattered light, {{they had to}} be combined. Scientists involved in the HDF observations pioneered a technique called 'drizzling', in which the pointing of the telescope was varied minutely between sets of exposures. Each pixel on the WFPC2 CCD chips recorded an area of sky 0.09 arcseconds across, but by changing the direction in which the telescope was pointing <b>by</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> that between exposures, the resulting images were combined using sophisticated image-processing techniques to yield a final angular resolution better than this value. The HDF images produced at each wavelength had final pixel sizes of 0.03985 arcseconds.|$|E

5|$|Outside of London and the South East, {{the use of}} {{regional}} airports has increased dramatically in recent years, {{with the amount of}} air traffic using these facilities doubling in the period 1995 to 2005. To illustrate this growth, in the five years from 2001 passenger numbers at the regional airports of Exeter International Airport, Bristol International Airport, and Newcastle Airport increased by 191 per cent, 113 per cent, and 60 per cent respectively. In the same period the largest airports experienced some of the slowest growth, with Heathrow passenger numbers increasing by 11 per cent, and those of Gatwick increasing <b>by</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 10 per cent.|$|E

As the two candidates were separated <b>by</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 0.5 {{percent of the votes}} cast, the Minnesota Secretary of State, Mark Ritchie, authorized an automatic recount provided for in Minnesota election law. In the recount, ballots and certifying materials were examined by hand, and candidates could file challenges to the legality of ballots or materials for inclusion or exclusion In the recount. On January 5, 2009, the Minnesota State Canvassing Board certified the recounted vote totals, with Franken ahead by 225 votes.|$|E

5|$|The 2015 Bears {{were more}} {{competitive}} in games {{compared to the}} 2014 team, with six of their ten losses being <b>by</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> a touchdown. Additionally, new coordinators Adam Gase and Vic Fangio helped revitalize the offense and defense, respectively; under Gase, quarterback Jay Cutler threw a career-low eleven interceptions and recorded a 92.3 passer rating, the highest in his career. With Fangio, the defense allowed 397 points; the last two defenses had previously allowed franchise highs in points, including 442 in 2014. However, the team was marred by injuries during the year, with only four players starting all sixteen games. The Bears also went 1–7 at home in 2015, the worst home record in franchise history.|$|E
5|$|The Senedd was {{constructed}} in two phases, the first in 2001 and the second from August 2003 until it was {{handed over to the}} National Assembly in February 2006. Between phases, the National Assembly changed contractors and the project's management structure, but retained Rogers as the scheme architect. The building was nearly six times over budget and four years and 10 months late, compared to the original estimates of the project in 1997. Total costs rose due to unforeseen security measures after the 11 September attacks, and because the National Assembly did not have an independent cost appraisal of the project until December 2000, three years after the original estimate. Phase 2 costs rose <b>by</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 6% over budget, and that phase was six months late.|$|E
