5|$|Brooks then {{executed}} a powerful, well-timed dive and surfaced almost {{even with his}} Soviet counterpart Kopliakov. He had drawn level halfway through his leg and made a superior turn {{to take the lead}} as they headed home. The Soviet freestyler pulled level with 25m to go before Brooks again pulled away to seal an Australian victory by 0.22s. He did not breathe in the last ten metres, and claimed to <b>be</b> <b>laughing</b> for the final five metres, confident that his opponent could not pass him. Brooks had finished his leg in 49.86s as he had vowed to his team mates. In doing so, he recorded the swiftest freestyle split in the relay, faster than that of the individual 100m freestyle gold medallist, Jörg Woithe of East Germany.|$|E
5|$|The {{rivalry between}} Rey Mysterio and CM Punk was {{continued}} from several previous pay-per-views. After months of feuding, Mysterio challenged Punk to a Straight Edge Society Pledge vs. Hair match at Over the Limit. Had Punk won, Mysterio would {{have joined the}} Straight Edge Society, Punk's faction which promoted the straight edge lifestyle. Had Mysterio won however, Punk agreed to have his head shaved. On May 14, Mysterio and Punk faced {{each other in a}} singles match, but the Straight Edge Society (Luke Gallows, Serena, and a mystery masked man) interfered and attacked Mysterio. The following week, Mysterio interrupted an initiation ceremony, in which Punk was shaving the heads of three men to induct them into the Straight Edge Society, and mocked Punk, claiming everyone would <b>be</b> <b>laughing</b> at Punk when he was shaved bald at Over the Limit. Later that night, Mysterio teamed with Montel Vontavious Porter to defeat Punk and Gallows in a tag team match.|$|E
5|$|Kerry led off in {{a faster}} time than he had clocked in the {{individual}} event, {{but it was still}} two seconds slower than his personal best time of 57.87s. This left Australia in fourth place {{at the end of the}} first leg. Evans then swam a personal best of 63.01s, leaving the team almost level with the host nation at the halfway mark. Tonelli then swam his leg in 54.94s, almost two seconds faster than his previous best. He did so with an uneven arm technique due to the disparity in the strength of his arms. He began to lose ground in the last 50m and was a bodylength behind until a late surge brought him to within a metre of the lead by the end of his leg. Brooks then made a powerful, well-timed dive and surfaced almost even with his Soviet counterpart. At the halfway mark, he had drawn level and made a superior turn to take the lead. The Soviet freestyler Kopliakov pulled level at the 25m mark before Brooks again sprinted away to seal an Australian victory by 0.22s. He did not breathe in the last ten metres, and claimed to <b>be</b> <b>laughing</b> for the final five metres, confident that his opponent could not pass him. The Australian freestyler had finished his leg in 49.86s as he had vowed to his team mates. The time of 3m 45.70s sealed Australia's first ever win in a medley relay at the Olympics, for men or women. Brooks dedicated the team's win to his mother, who had died from cancer the previous Christmas. Upon returning to Australia, he was greeted as a hero, but he considered retiring due to waning desire for success after his triumph in Moscow. In 2000, Brooks and the other members of the quartet were each awarded the Australian Sports Medal for their victory in Moscow.|$|E

500|$|... "Wet Hot Demonic Summer" [...] {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. David Hinckley of New York Daily News rated it {{four out of}} five stars and commented that although it may not make sense to some viewers, it is [...] "equally possible they will keep watching anyway because the jokes work so well all by themselves". Hinckley went on to remark that [...] "Ugly Americans packs a lot into 21 or 22 minutes. Happily, its often droll and deadpan style makes it easy to watch even if some of the references are whizzing by unappreciated". RedEye critic Curt Wagner rated it three stars out of four and wrote that it includes [...] "visual [...] ", cultural references and [...] "so-fast-you'll-miss-them jokes" [...] that it might require multiple viewings. Wagner, however, meant that this was a rather positive feature, writing: [...] "For example, you might <b>be</b> <b>laughing</b> so hard at what just happened that you miss a fun line..." [...] Lastly, Wagner observed that [...] "Ugly Americans can be gross and bizarre, but everything makes sense in the world that it has created".|$|E
500|$|Several critics {{commented on}} the {{controversy}} over lines in the film talking about the mentally disabled. Duane Dudek of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel wrote that the film [...] "...is just sophomoric enough to offend. And while it is also funny, it is without the empathy or compassion to cause us to wonder why we are laughing." [...] Christian Toto of The Washington Times argued against the opposition, [...] "Tropic Thunder is drawing fire from special interest groups for ...its frequent {{use of the word}} 'retard', but discerning audiences will know where the humor is targeted. And they'll <b>be</b> <b>laughing</b> too hard to take offense." [...] Kurt Loder of MTV contrasted the opposition to the lines with Downey character portrayal of an African American, [...] "The scene in which the derisive Alpa Chino [...] nails Lazarus' recitation of black-uplift homilies as nothing more than the lyrics to the Jeffersons theme is funny; but the one in which Lazarus quietly explains to Speedman that his Simple Jack character failed because he made the mistake of going 'full retard'—rather than softening his character with cuteness in the manner of Forrest Gump—is so on-the-nose accurate, it takes your breath away." ...|$|E

500|$|As the {{producers}} gained greater {{confidence in the}} film however, larger name actors were brought in. Patrick Warburton was the first celebrity actor to join the film and did so purely out of a love for the script. Though Cory Edwards had originally envisioned the Wolf as sounding like a mixture between a young Chevy Chase and Bill Murray, he praised Warburton's performance, saying that he [...] "made the Wolf his own character." [...] Andy Dick also joined the cast early on, to voice Boingo. He used improvisation and approached the role differently from how it had been written, interpreting the character as victimized and unstable. The filmmakers were enthusiastic over Dick's angle on the character, and Todd Edwards said, [...] "What we had written was kind of stock, to be honest, but Andy Dick, well, where {{he was supposed to}} laugh, he'd be crying. Where he was supposed to yell, he'd <b>be</b> <b>laughing.</b> He just mixed it up!" [...] Prolific voice performers Tara Strong, David Ogden Stiers, and Tom Kenny were cast in multiple roles. Strong was cast as Red and Zorra, Stiers was cast as Kirk, the Woodsman and Nicky Flippers, and Kenny was cast as Tommy and Woolworth the Sheep. Emmy-winning actress Sally Struthers was brought in to play Granny Puckett and Joel McCrary was cast as Chief Grizzly.|$|E
500|$|Throughout {{his career}} as player and journalist, Fingleton {{persistently}} came into personal conflict with Don Bradman, one of the captains under whom Fingleton played, damaging the reputations of both. Bradman characteristically held his silence during Fingleton's lifetime. Bradman {{was known for his}} reserved personality, did not drink and often eschewed social activities with teammates, preferring to privately listen to music or read. Combined with his success, he gained a reputation for cockiness. In the 1930s, Australia had been divided along sectarian lines, with those of Irish descent such as Fingleton being Catholic and Anglo-Australians such as Bradman being predominantly Protestant, leading to speculation that the tension was fuelled by religion. During the 1936–37 Ashes series in Australia, four Catholics, leading bowler Bill O'Reilly, leading batsman and vice-captain Stan McCabe along with Leo O'Brien and Chuck Fleetwood-Smith were summoned by the Board of Control to respond to allegations that they were undermining Bradman. Fingleton was not invited, speculated to be due to his journalistic background, but Bradman later alleged that he was the ringleader. After that, Bradman's relationship with O'Reilly and Fingleton never recovered. When Bradman was dismissed in his final Test innings in 1948 for a duck, Fingleton and O'Reilly were reported to <b>be</b> <b>laughing</b> hysterically in the pressbox. E W Swanton said that [...] "I {{thought they were going to}} have stroke". Bradman later wrote after both had died: [...] "With these fellows out of the way, the loyalty of my 1948 side was a big joy and made a big contribution to the outstanding success of that tour".|$|E
500|$|Pornographic Apathetic {{received}} positive reception from journalist Gary Dowell of The Dallas Morning News, {{who described}} it as [...] "Especially notable ... an experimental work that strips the mystique from porn". Pornographic Apathetic was selected {{for inclusion in the}} Puchon International Fantastic Festival (PiFan) in South Korea; the festival [...] "aims to identify the important elements of fantastic films, such as creativity and popularity". The movie was shown at the Paris Porn Film Fest at the Le Brady cinema, in Paris, France. The film was featured in an exhibit in Vienna, examining the nature of pornography. Writing for San Antonio Express-News, Mike Greenberg observed, [...] "T. Arthur Cottam's Pornographic Apathetic is just about the funniest thing I've ever seen. (The excellent actors are mostly clothed, never touch each other and are nearly motionless, but the dialogue is not suitable for children or bluenoses.)" [...] The film was given a favorable review by reporter Robert W. Butler of The Kansas City Star who covered the piece during its presentation at the Kansas City Filmmakers Jubilee. Butler wrote, [...] "Your ears will burn while watching T. Arthur Cottam's superlative satiric essay on the desensitizing effects of pornography, but you'll also <b>be</b> <b>laughing.</b> ... It's lurid. It's raunchy. It's vile. But all this nasty lubricity is delivered deadpan, a device that deconstructs the whole intention of porn." [...] Marc Mohan reviewed the film during its feature at the Portland International Short Short Film Festival, and wrote that it [...] "makes the most of its one-joke premise". In 2007, The Orlando Sentinel characterized Cottam as a favorite film-maker at the Florida Film Festival. Los Angeles Times journalist Borzou Daragahi cited the film as an example of problems with the adult film industry in an article about a sexual art exhibit; he commented, [...] "The piece makes you laugh while illustrating one of the paradoxes of smut: At its core, it's rather idiotic and boring." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Trivia" [...] {{received}} relatively positive reviews, {{although many}} critics {{did not enjoy}} the Florida sub-plot. Many television critics agreed that [...] "Trivia" [...] was a marked improvement over many of the episodes {{in the first part}} of the season. Craig McQuinn from The Faster Times wrote, [...] "Aside from a few weak moments, 'Trivia' was a solid episode of The Office and a vast improvement over most of the episodes this season." [...] Myles McNutt from The A.V. Club awarded the episode a B+ rating and wrote positively of the trivia plot, saying, [...] "When The Office reaches its next hiatus, and then its subsequent return, I’ll find myself hoping for more like the trivia side of 'Trivia', storylines that even after contrived introductions can simply sit back and let the character-driven jokes take over the narrative." [...] Chris Plante from New York magazine explained that [...] "If you plan to continue watching The Office, here’s my advice ... You need to forget the negative energy this show attracts. Start thinking of Season Eight like a reboot." [...] He concluded that [...] "The Office is not irreparable. It’s not great either, but there is some marked improvement here over the worst episodes from the first half of the season." [...] Lizzie Fuhr from BuzzSugar.com wrote positively on both the trivia A-plot and the Dwight and Robert B-plot. TV Fanatic reviewer Dan Forcella called the trivia conceit [...] "quite fun" [...] and awarded the episode 3.5 out of 5 stars. The Huffington Post wrote that [...] "The Office continues to find fun and unique ways to spotlight how mundane office life can be by showing ways the gang finds to fill their day." [...] Alan Sepinwall from HitFix, who was notably critical of the new season, called the episode [...] "charming." [...] IGN reviewer Cindy White noted that the episode bore stylistic similarities to the third episode of the British version of the show, entitled [...] "The Quiz", writing that [...] "while 'Trivia' does loosely allude to that pub quiz with a bar trivia night, that turns out to be the only thing the two have in common." [...] She did, however, positively write about the humor of the episode, noting that, [...] "the writers squeezed some good laughs out of the idea, and it feels good to <b>be</b> <b>laughing</b> again at The Office." ...|$|E

2500|$|The film then rolls {{into the}} song “A World Without” as a grief-stricken Charlie {{and several other}} mourners, {{some of whom are}} clearly played by Queensrÿche's band members, attend Cathy’s funeral. The priest begins his eulogy but then appears to <b>be</b> <b>laughing</b> and {{pointing}} at Charlie, as do everyone else in attendance except for La Torre, who looks at Charlie with a serious face, as Charlie clutches his child wrapped in a blanket. Brian is also shown to <b>be</b> <b>laughing</b> and pointing but his appearance {{as well as the other}} mourners’ cruelty is revealed to be happening merely inside Charlie’s head, coinciding with the lyric [...] "what is real and what is fantasy". The song continues playing as Charlie is seen sitting beside a crib and drinking heavily while a baby is heard crying. He has a vision of Cathy picking up their child from the crib, and recalls the look on Brian’s face that day when he finked on him. Charlie then proceeds to pull a gun from a drawer and point it at his head but the vision of Cathy returns to assure him that she is there with him. Four years later, Charlie is seen working at his desk and smiling at a picture that his daughter drew for him. As he leaves his desk, the camera zooms in on a photograph of his now four-year-old daughter. Charlie heads toward the garage where he finds his brother waiting for him by the car. Without saying a word, Brian nervously holds his hand out to Charlie who happily embraces him, and the two of them reconcile. During the end credits, the track [...] "X2" [...] is played.|$|E

Egan describes LOL, ROFL, and other initialisms as helpful {{so long as}} they are not overused. He recommends against their use in business correspondence because the recipient may not be aware of their meanings, and because in general neither they nor emoticons are (in his view) appropriate in such correspondence.

The storyline was featured in a New Year's Eve episode that was filmed on-location in Scotland. In the storyline, a group of teenagers travel from London to Scotland for New Year's Eve, but their minibus crashes, leaving them stranded and injured on the freezing cold Scottish moors. While stranded, Kelly cares for an injured Zoe, they become over-emotional, and kiss. Kinsella explained the reasons behind the kiss: [...] "They're stuck in the hills, thinking they're going to die—it's {{a way of saying}} goodbye and also of showing how much they love each other as friends. Which is quite sweet really." [...] She claimed that the kiss was made easier {{due to the fact that}} she was kissing her off-screen best friend: [...] "That made it so much easier. We thought we were just going to <b>be</b> <b>laughing</b> and giggling the whole way through, but we were very professional. It was so cold that we just wanted to get it over with. We were shaking from cold—not from nerves—and it was raining, so we just thought, 'Let's do it and get it done with'. [...] We laugh about it now.

2500|$|The {{personal}} and vocational {{experiences of the}} four co-writers were central to writing the script. Dinelaris' exposure to Broadway shaped the depictions of rehearsals and events backstage, though he admitted exaggerating these. He also felt his background writing long scenes of dialogue helped since scenes in the film [...] "were really more like play scenes". Iñárritu's own experiences influenced many of Birdmans themes. [...] "What this film talks about, I have been through," [...] Iñárritu recalled. [...] "I have seen and experienced all of it; it's what I have been living through {{the last years of}} my life." [...] Dinelaris described this aspect as [...] "a laughing look at oneself", but said {{it had to be done}} in a comedic way otherwise [...] "it would have been the most unbelievably self-absorbed look at the subject". Themes from Raymond Carver's short story [...] "What We Talk About When We Talk About Love", which Riggan adapts for stage in the story, also influenced the script. Iñárritu wanted to find the connection between the themes in Riggan's story and those of Carver's. Because of this, it was important to the director that Carver's story be the subject of the play depicted within the film. Therefore, Iñárritu stated that his desire to use Carver's work was [...] "terrifying" [...] because the rights to using the Carver material were still subject to the possibility of being rejected during development of the film, but no issues arose. Carver's widow, writer Tess Gallagher, loved the script and permitted the adaptation, saying that Carver would <b>be</b> <b>laughing</b> about the film.|$|E
