25|$|Dennis Kucinich and Barack Obama competed {{against each}} other in the Iowa Caucuses, but Kucinich asked that Iowans caucusing for him, should they fail to build a viable {{preference}} group on Caucus Night to realign to Barack Obama in the second round. Both had fought for the same priorities including ending the Iraq War, reforming Washington, D.C., and creating a <b>better</b> <b>life</b> <b>for</b> working families. In the 2004 Iowa Democratic Caucuses, Kucinich made a similar announcement in favor of John Edwards. At that caucus, Edwards's aides claimed that this request helped put him in second place. In the 2008 Iowa Caucus, however, Kucinich did not conduct much of a campaign in Iowa. He paid for no organizers nor offices in the state, and he was not invited to the Des Moines Register's debate in December 2007. Mike Gravel didn't conduct an active campaign in Iowa either.|$|E

Although skeptical that Wolfe is only investigating the theft and not the murder, Inspector Cramer shares what the police have learned about the case so far. Other than the financial motive, none of the contestants appears to have had any serious reason or opportunity to either murder Dahlmann or steal the answers, and much to Archie's concern Wolfe's investigation appears to lose energy and focus.|$|E

500|$|With the {{election}} set for 27 April 1994, the ANC began campaigning, opening 100 election offices and orchestrating People's Forums {{across the country}} at which Mandela could appear, as a popular figure with great status among black South Africans. The ANC campaigned on a Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP) to build a million houses in five years, introduce universal free education and extend access to water and electricity. The party's slogan was [...] "a <b>better</b> <b>life</b> <b>for</b> all", {{although it was not}} explained how this development would be funded. With the exception of the Weekly Mail and the New Nation, South Africa's press opposed Mandela's election, fearing continued ethnic strife, instead supporting the National or Democratic Party. Mandela devoted much time to fundraising for the ANC, touring North America, Europe and Asia to meet wealthy donors, including former supporters of the apartheid regime. He also urged a reduction in the voting age from 18 to 14; rejected by the ANC, this policy became the subject of ridicule.|$|E

500|$|... "Pyramids" [...] {{is cited}} by writers as the album's centerpiece. Brice Ezell from PopMatters wrote that it denotes [...] "the vital {{midpoint}} of the overarching narrative", where [...] "the wittier tone of the record's front half gives way to an emotionally dense second half." [...] Veering from synth-funk to slow jam styles, the song has a lyrical conceit that uses Ancient Egyptian and Biblical imagery, and contrasts the legendary fall of Cleopatra with the circumstances of a latter-day working girl, who dances at a strip club called the Pyramid to support her man's gaudy aspirations. The new wave-styled [...] "Lost" [...] is about a perplexed addict, who hopes for a <b>better</b> <b>life</b> <b>for</b> him and his drug-cooking girlfriend. [...] "Monks", a funk rock song, is about finding nirvana and deals with topics such as casual sex and devout religion in a narrative that shifts from an exciting concert to a metaphorical jungle. [...] "Bad Religion" [...] features melodramatic, orchestral music {{and a series of}} figures, including strings, handclaps, marching band snare drums, and mournful organ chords. The lyrics follow an emotional confession to a taxi driver by a narrator brooding over a secretive intimate relationship. Music journalist Alexis Petridis asserted that the song [...] "repurpos the battle between religion and lust that's been at the heart of soul music since it ceded from gospel".|$|E
