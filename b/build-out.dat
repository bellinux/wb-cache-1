Rohrer's substantial recognition, which has included feature coverage in Wired, Esquire and The Wall Street Journal, as well as inclusion in MoMA's initial videogame acquisition, has been built on a singularly fascinating body of games. These range from the elegantly simple—such as Gravitation (2008), a game about flights of creative mania and melancholy—to others of Byzantine complexity.

40|$|AbstractConversion {{of native}} {{habitats}} to cropland {{is a leading}} cause of biodiversity loss. The northeastern extent of the sagebrush (Artemisia L.) ecosystem of western North America has experienced accelerated rates of cropland conversion resulting in many declining shrubland species including greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus). Here we present point-process models to elucidate the magnitude and spatial scale of cropland effects on sage-grouse lek occurrence in eastern Montana, northeastern Wyoming, North Dakota and South Dakota. We also use a non-parametric, probabilistic crop suitability model to simulate future cropland expansion and estimate impacts to sage-grouse. We found cropland effects manifest at a spatial scale of 32. 2 km 2 and a 10 percentage point increase in cropland is associated with a 51 % reduction in lek density. Our crop suitability model and stochastic cropland <b>build-outs</b> indicate 5 – 7 % of the remaining population in the US portion of sage-grouse Management Zone I is vulnerable to future cropland conversion under a severe scenario where cropland area expands by 50 %. Using metrics of biological value, risk of conversion, and acquisition cost to rank parcels, we found that a US $ 100 M investment in easements could reduce potential losses by about 80 %, leaving just over 1 % of the population in the study are vulnerable to cropland expansion. Clustering conservation easements into high-risk landscapes by incorporating landscape-scale vulnerability to conversion into the targeting scheme substantially improved conservation outcomes...|$|R
40|$|Mobile Communication {{marketplace}} has {{stressed that}} "content is king" {{ever since the}} initial footsteps for Next Generation Networks like 3 G, 3 GPP, IP Multimedia subsystem (IMS) services. However, many carriers and content providers have struggled to drive revenue for content services, primarily due to current limitations of certain types of desirable content offerings, simplistic billing models, and the inability to support flexible pricing, charging and settlement. Unlike wire line carriers, wireless carriers have a limit to the volume of traffic they can carry, bounded by the finite wireless spectrum. Event based services like calling, conferencing etc., only perceive charge per event, while the Content based charging system attracts Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) to maximize service delivery to customer and achieve best ARPU. With the Next Generation Networks, the number of data related services that can be offered, is increased significantly. The wireless carrier {{will be able to}} move from offering wireless telecommunications services to offering wireless telecommunication services plus a number of personalized Value Added Services like news, games, video broadcasts, or multimedia messaging service (MMS) through the network. The next generation Content Based Billing systems allow the operators to maximize their revenues from such services. These systems will enable operators to offer and bill for application-based and content-based services, rather than for just bytes of data. Therefore, the wireless business focus is no longer on infrastructure <b>build-outs</b> but on customer retention and increased average revenue per customer (ARPU).
