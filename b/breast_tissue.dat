In {{the case of}} breast brachytherapy, fat necrosis may occur {{as a result of}} fatty acids entering the breast tissues.

5|$|Animal {{studies show}} that astatine, {{similarly}} to iodine, although to a lesser extent, is preferentially concentrated in the thyroid gland. Unlike iodine, astatine also shows {{a tendency to be}} taken up by the lungs and spleen, possibly because of in-body oxidation of At– to At+. If administered {{in the form of a}} radiocolloid it tends to concentrate in the liver. Experiments in rats and monkeys suggest that astatine-211 causes much greater damage to the thyroid gland than does iodine-131, with repetitive injection of the nuclide resulting in necrosis and cell dysplasia within the gland. Early research suggested that injection of astatine into female rodents caused morphological changes in breast tissue; this conclusion remained controversial for many years. General agreement was later reached that this was likely caused by the effect of <b>breast</b> <b>tissue</b> irradiation combined with hormonal changes due to irradiation of the ovaries. Trace amounts of astatine can be handled safely in fume hoods if they are well-aerated; biological uptake of the element must be avoided.|$|E

Bcl-xl expression in <b>breast</b> cancer <b>tissue</b> increased with the elevation of clinical staging and histological grading (P＜ 0. 05 or P＜ 0. 01).

The average threshold cycle (Ct) number {{values of the}} nDNA and mtDNA were used to calculate relative mtDNA content in <b>breast</b> <b>tissues.</b> RESULTS: The median delta Ct (DeltaCt) and the median mtDNA content for normal and cancerous <b>breast</b> <b>tissues</b> were 6. 73 and 2. 54, as well as 106. 50 and 5. 80 (P = 0. 000, respectively).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Breast {{cancer is}} the most common cancer {{affecting}} women in the world today. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family of endopeptidases that can degrade extracellular matrix proteins and promote cell invasion and metastasis. MMPs are differentially expressed and their expressions are often associated with a poor prognosis for patients. OBJECTIVE: The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate and compare the expression of MMPs in different grades of human <b>breast</b> cancer <b>tissues</b> with normal <b>breast</b> <b>tissues.</b> PATIENTS AND METHODS: We collected 39 breast cancer samples (24 grade II and 15 grade III) along with 16 normal <b>breast</b> <b>tissues</b> from outside the tumor margin during cancer removal surgery. The samples were analysed for the expression of all known MMPs using real-time quantitative PCR. RESULTS: The results indicate that mRNA expressions of MMP- 1,- 9,- 11,- 15,- 24 and- 25 were upregulated in <b>breast</b> cancer <b>tissues</b> when compared to normal <b>breast</b> <b>tissues.</b> But, the mRNA expressions of MMP- 10 and MMP- 19 were downregulated in cancer tissue. In membrane associated MMPs like MMP- 15 and MMP- 24 we found a grade dependent increase of their mRNA expression. CONCLUSION: Our studies demonstrate that MMPs are differentially regulated in <b>breast</b> cancer <b>tissues</b> and they might play various roles in tumor invasion, metastasis and angiogenesis.
