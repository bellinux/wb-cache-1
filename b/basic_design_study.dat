Conventional models are not accurate enough for <b>basic</b> <b>design</b> <b>studies</b> like efficiency calculations, necessitating laborious time-domain simulations that reveal little about the sensitivities to design parameters.

40|$|AbstractDesign {{education}} in general includes various design {{fields such as}} product design, graphic design, communication design and design in engineering. Designing as an activity captures all these various fields. Design refers basically to a problem solving method, a creative problem solving approach and relevant processes. Design as an activity has always been considered as a creative tool. Design education mainly focuses on enhancing creative approaches with various 2 D and 3 D project based <b>basic</b> <b>design</b> <b>studies.</b> As the tools of designing developed in parallel with technology, the core structure of the education {{is based on a}} model with creative and analytical aspects: Designerly way of thinking aims at originality and uniqueness. Today the need for innovation has become more evident than ever. The main purpose of the paper is to explore and to identify the relationship between creativity, innovation and design related to design education. Bruno Munari(Milano, 1907 - 1998) as a designer and a design educator, is one of the prominent names reflecting innovation and creativity in the history of Italian Design. His innovative contribution to Italian Design is reinforced by his experimental design educator background in research for creativity. The paper aims at exploring the educational structures through history of design and design education that leads to creative thinking and nurture sustainable innovation through the case study of Bruno Munari's works as a designer and as an educator...|$|R

40|$|Large-scale {{experimental}} studies {{were conducted on}} two types of wave absorbers, {{as an extension of}} earlier small-scale work. The first absorber, and the one of primary interest, was a discontinuous permeable absorber with a surface slope of 12 degrees. Two types of permeable materials [...] (a) crushed rock and (b) rectangular bars [...] were investigated. Several modifications of the <b>basic</b> <b>design</b> were <b>studied,</b> including various thicknesses of permeable layer. On the basis of the {{experimental studies}}, an optimum thickness of permeable layer was selected. The use of the rectangular-bar construction was recommended. Brief tests were run on the second type, a short absorber, which was being considered for use around the periphery of a rotating-am basin. The tests indicated that a surface slope of 15 degrees and a thin layer of permeable material produced the best results. The absorber was restricted to a very short length and produced high reflection coefficients, but it materially reduced the settling time of the basin.

The MIR instrument is a joint project between NASA/GSFC and Georgia Tech. In the current configuration, the MIR has channels at 90, 150, 183 (+/- 1, 3, 7), and 220 GHz.
