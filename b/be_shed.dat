5|$|Following the {{government}} grant announcement, Kevin Rudd, Australia's Prime Minister at the time, stated that production would support 600 new {{jobs at the}} Elizabeth facility; however, this failed {{to take into account}} Holden's previous announcement, whereby 600 jobs would <b>be</b> <b>shed</b> when production of the Family II engine ceased in late 2009. In mid-2013, Holden sought a further A$265million, in addition to the A$275million that was already committed by {{the government}}s of Canberra, South Australia and Victoria, to remain viable as a car manufacturer in Australia. A source close to Holden informed the Australian news publication that the car company is losing money on every vehicle that it produces and consequently initiated negotiations to reduce employee wages by up to A$200 per week to cut costs, following the announcement of 400 job cuts and an assembly line reduction of 65 (400 to 335) cars per day.|$|E
5|$|Feathers become abraded {{over time}} and all birds need to replace them at intervals. Barn owls are {{particularly}} dependent {{on their ability to}} fly quietly and manoeuvre efficiently, and in temperate areas their prolonged moult lasts through three phases over a period of two years. The female starts to moult while incubating the eggs and brooding the chicks, a time when the male feeds her so she does not need to fly much. The first primary feather to <b>be</b> <b>shed</b> is the central one, number 6, and it has regrown completely by the time the female resumes hunting. Feathers 4, 5, 7 and 8 are dropped at a similar time the following year and feathers 1, 2, 3, 9 and 10 in the bird's third year of adulthood. The secondary and tail feathers are lost and replaced over a similar timescale, again starting while incubation is taking place. In the case of the tail, the two outermost tail feathers are first shed followed by the two central ones, the other tail feathers being moulted the following year.|$|E

50|$|It is {{possible}} flooding in SE Queensland and Northern NSW in December 2010 and January 2011 {{may have affected}} {{the health of the}} fruit bats.

25|$|At some point, the {{follicle}} {{will begin}} to grow again, softening the anchor point of the shaft initially. The hair base will break free from the root and the hair will <b>be</b> <b>shed.</b> Within two weeks the new hair shaft {{will begin to}} emerge once the telogen phase is complete. The process results in normal hair loss known as shedding.|$|E
25|$|Ovulation is {{the release}} of eggs from the ovaries. In humans, this event occurs when the follicles rupture and release the {{secondary}} oocyte ovarian cells. After ovulation, during the luteal phase, the egg {{will be available to}} be fertilized by sperm. In addition, the uterine lining (endometrium) is thickened to be able to receive a fertilized egg. If no conception occurs, the uterine lining as well as blood will <b>be</b> <b>shed</b> during menstruation.|$|E

25|$|In long {{established}} disease adult worms {{lay eggs}} {{that can cause}} inflammatory reactions. The eggs secrete proteolytic enzymes that help them migrate to the bladder and intestines to <b>be</b> <b>shed.</b> However the enzymes also cause an eosinophilic inflammatory reaction when eggs get trapped in tissues or embolize to the liver, spleen, lungs, or brain. The long term manifestations are dependent on the species of schistosome as the adult worms of different species migrate to different areas. Many infections are mildly symptomatic, with anemia and malnutrition being common in endemic areas.|$|E
25|$|Noroviruses are {{transmitted}} directly {{from person to}} person (62–84% of all reported outbreaks) and indirectly via contaminated water and food. They are extremely contagious, and fewer than twenty virus particles can cause an infection (some research suggests as few as five). Transmission can be aerosolized when those stricken with the illness vomit, and can be aerosolized by a toilet flush when vomit or diarrhea is present; infection can follow eating food or breathing air near an episode of vomiting, even if cleaned up. The viruses continue to <b>be</b> <b>shed</b> after symptoms have subsided and shedding can still be detected many weeks after infection.|$|E
25|$|Since CD4 {{receptor}} binding {{is the most}} obvious step in HIV infection, gp120 {{was among the first}} targets of HIV vaccine research. Efforts to develop HIV vaccines targeting gp120, however, have been hampered by the chemical and structural properties of gp120, which make it difficult for antibodies to bind to it. gp120 can also easily <b>be</b> <b>shed</b> {{from the surface of the}} virus and captured by T cells due to its loose binding with gp41. A conserved region in the gp120 glycoprotein that is involved in the metastable attachment of gp120 to CD4 has been identified and targeting of invariant region has been achieved with a broadly neutralising antibody, IgG1-b12.|$|E

25|$|Druids {{also play}} a {{prominent}} role in Irish Folklore, generally serving lords and kings as high ranking priest-counselors with the gift of prophecy and other assorted mystical abilities - the best example of these possibly being Cathbad. The chief druid in the court of King Conchobar mac Nessa of Ulster, Cathbad features in several tales, most of which detail his ability to foretell the future. In the tale of Deirdre of the Sorrows – the foremost tragic heroine of the Ulster Cycle – the druid prophesied before the court of Conchobar that Deirdre would grow up to be very beautiful, but that kings and lords would go to war over her, much blood would <b>be</b> <b>shed</b> because of her, and Ulster's three greatest warriors would be forced into exile for her sake. This prophecy, ignored by the king, came true.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the process}} of ecdysis is metabolically risky and expensive, it does have some advantages. For one thing it permits a complex {{development}} cycle of metamorphosis in which young animals may be totally different from older phases, such as the nauplius larvae of crustaceans, the nymphs of say, the Odonata, or the larvae of Endopterygota, such as maggots of flies. Such larval stages commonly have ecological and life cycle roles totally {{different from those of}} the mature animals. Secondly, often a major injury in one phase, such as the loss of a leg from an insect nymph, or a claw from a young crab, can be repaired after one or two stages of ecdysis. Similarly, delicate parts that need periodic replacement, such as the outer surfaces of the eye lenses of spiders, or the urticating hairs of caterpillars, can <b>be</b> <b>shed,</b> making way for new structures.|$|E
25|$|Since exoskeletons are rigid, {{they present}} some limits to growth. Organisms with open shells can grow by adding new {{material}} to the aperture of their shell, {{as is the case}} in snails, bivalves and other molluscans. A true exoskeleton, like that found in arthropods, must <b>be</b> <b>shed</b> (moulted) when it is outgrown. A new exoskeleton is produced beneath the old one. As the old one is shed, the new skeleton is soft and pliable. The animal will pump itself up to expand the new shell to maximal size, then let it harden. When the shell has set, the empty space inside the new skeleton can be filled up as the animal eats. Failure to shed the exoskeleton once outgrown can result in the animal being suffocated within its own shell, and will stop subadults from reaching maturity, thus preventing them from reproducing. This is the mechanism behind some insect pesticides, such as Azadirachtin.|$|E

25|$|According to {{the terms}} of the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah, the Arab tribes were given the option of joining either of the parties, the Muslims or Quraysh. Should any of these tribes face aggression, the party to which it was allied would have the right to retaliate. As a consequence, Banu Bakr joined Quraysh, and Khuza'ah joined Muhammad. They thus lived in peace for some time; but ulterior motives {{stretching}} back to the pre-Islamic period, ignited by unabated fire of revenge, triggered fresh hostilities. Banu Bakr, without concern for the provisions of the treaty, attacked Banu Khuza'a in a place called Al-Wateer in Sha'ban, in 8 AH. Quraysh helped Banu Bakr with men and arms, taking advantage of the dark night. Pressed by their enemies, the tribesmen of Khuza'ah sought the Holy Sanctuary, but here too, their lives were not spared, and, contrary to all accepted traditions, Nawfal, the chief of Banu Bakr, chased them in the sanctified area — where no blood should <b>be</b> <b>shed</b> — and massacred his adversaries. Khuza'ah at once sent a delegation to Medina to inform Muhammad, of this breach of truce and to seek help from Muslims of Medina being their allies.|$|E
25|$|To explain {{himself to}} the people, John ordered that posters be put up along the streets stating that his {{departure}} was unavoidable despite all efforts made to assure the integrity and peace of the kingdom. The posters recommended that everyone remain calm, orderly and not resist the invaders, so that blood not <b>be</b> <b>shed</b> in vain. Because of the rush to depart, the Prince Regent John, Queen Maria, Prince Pedro, Prince of Beira (later Pedro I of Brazil and Pedro IV of Portugal), and the Infante Miguel (later Miguel I of Portugal) were all in a single ship. This was an imprudent decision given the dangers of a transatlantic voyage in that era, since it placed at risk the succession of the crown in case of shipwreck. Carlota Joaquina and the infantas were on two other ships. The {{number of people who}} embarked with John remains a matter of controversy; in the 19th century there was talk of up to 30 thousand emigrants; more recent estimates vary between five hundred and fifteen thousand, the latter being close to the maximum capacity of the squadron of fifteen ships, including their crews. Still, the ships were overcrowded. According to Pedreira e Costa, taking into account all of the variables, the most likely numbers fall between four and seven thousand passengers plus the crews. Many families were separated, and even high officials failed to secure a place on the ships and were left behind. The voyage was not a tranquil one. Several ships were in precarious condition, and overcrowding created humiliating conditions for the nobility, the majority of whom had to sleep huddled in the open in the poops. Hygienic conditions were bad, including an epidemic of head lice. Many had failed to bring changes of clothing. Several people fell ill. Supplies were scarce, causing rationing. Furthermore, the flotilla spent ten days nearly becalmed in the equatorial zone under a scorching heat that caused moods to turn quite sour. The flotilla also faced two storms and was eventually dispersed near Madeira. In the middle of the voyage, Prince John changed his plans and decided to head for Salvador, Bahia, probably for political reasons. He wanted to please the inhabitants of the colony's first capital, which had given many signs of discontent with the loss of its old status. The ships carrying his wife and the infantas held to the original destination of Rio de Janeiro.|$|E

[...] Bróðir was so angered by this that he planned to slay Óspak's men the next day. Seeing this plan, Óspak deserted his brother during the night with ten ships. He sailed around Ireland to Connaught, and up the River Shannon, to join Brian Boru as an ally. He told King Brian all that he had learned, took baptism, and gathered his men to come to Dublin with Brian's forces a week before Palm Sunday.|$|E
