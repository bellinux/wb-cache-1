Forgive me, however, as far as you can, for every sort of fault. When I once <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>to</b> you, I {{do not know how to}} stop; and I have had so much to do lately as scarcely to know how <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>to</b> you. Hence these faults--not quite tears--in spite of my penitence and the quotation.|$|R
