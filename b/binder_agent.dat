The manufactured MiCaSiC® ceramics (metal infiltrated carbon based silicon carbide) were based on novel raw material compositions. For these material compositions, activated carbon, carbon fibers and a sinterable pitch based semi-coke were used as fillers and source of a sufficiently stable carbon backbone in the carbonized intermediate state. Different <b>binder</b> <b>agents</b> {{were used for the}} compound and feedstock development and basically compared. This involves thermoplastic and duroplastic binders which promote the use of two different shaping methods (warm pressing and extrusion process). This allows the formation of highly porous and complex shaped carbon preforms for further silicon infiltration. The main focus of {{the present study}} was to evaluate the impact of debinding and pyrolysis process step on the preform micro-structure. That includes the determination and quantification of matrix and porosity evolution in carbon preforms. The defined formation of porosity during pyrolysis is a key parameter for subsequent silicon infiltration. In this context, pore structure formation of carbon preforms as well as porosity and microstructural characteristics of carbon preforms and resulting Mi-CaSiC® ceramics were investigated by means of computer tomography (CT), scanning elec-tron microscopy (SEM) and porosity measurements. It is shown that pore structure formation and pore content in carbon preform stage is significantly influenced by the thermal decompo-sition behavior of the preferred <b>binder</b> <b>agents.</b> Furthermore, the microstructure development after pyrolysis is basically affected by the homogenization rate of the material composition as well as material flow kinematics during shaping proces...|$|R

CPB consists of a mixture of tailings, <b>binder</b> <b>agent,</b> and water. Binder hydration in CPB leads to an evolution of the porous matrix and entails a change in hydrogeotechnical properties of the backfill. Key property to investigate for an efficient management of tailings is the saturated hydraulic conductivity (ksat). In this study, results of permeability tests performed on cemented paste backfill samples at different curing times are presented. Results show that the addition of 4. 5 % wt of binder can reduce ksat by a factor of more than ten after 28 days of curing. The kinetic is also different depending on the binder used. Typically, a binder made of Portland cement and slag has a greater impact on the reduction of ksat than a binder made of Portland cement and fly ash. Finally, a simple equation to predict ksat of the studied CPB is proposed. Results show a relatively good correlation between predicted and measured values.

The tablets had been studied in terms of their pharmacotechnical characteristics, by determining: the weight uniformity of the tablets, their friability, breaking strength and disintegration time, drug content and the dissolution profile of loratadine. The statistical analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism Software Inc. As dependent variables, both the hardness of the tablets and their disintegration ability differ between batches due to their compositional differences (as independent variables). DDSolver were used for modeling the kinetic of the dissolution processes by fitting the dissolution profiles with time-dependent equations (Zero-order, First-order, Higuchi, Korsmeyer-Peppas, Peppas-Sahlin).

The structure and surface of films obtained by a dip-coating technique were found to depend strongly on the use and type of additive molecules added. The results show that, the film from titania sol without various additives molecules consists of agglomerated titania particles and ill-defined surface, which may cause the surface to be non-uniform, whereas Titania /TX- 100 (TO-TX) sols resulted in the homogeneous and crack-free TO anatase films. Thin film deposited on SiO 2 -coated glass substrate indicate a packed and dense structure of the TO film. Many fine pores with different sizes existed in the TiO 2 -SiO 2 films (TO-SO).

However, published work on the coal ash brick with addition of foam in order to produce lightweight brick is still lacking. This thesis reports the effect of variation in foam content in coal ash brick on the density, water absorption and salt attack resistance. Comparison of those parameters was made between the coal ash bricks and conventional brick. The coal ash brick mixes were formulated using industrial by-product, ground granulated blastfurnace slag (GGBS) which is activated with an alkaline (hydrated lime or Portland cement) combined with coal ash from coal-fired thermal power plant. The blended binder comprising of hydrated lime (HL) – GGBS and Portland cement (PC) –GGBS were used to stabilize the coal ash brick. Foam was used to produce lightweight brick. The percentage of foam added to the brick mixes are 25 %, 50 % and 75 %. A total of sixty (60) brick specimen subjected to ten (10) series of mix proportion were cast and put in air curing condition for at least 28 days before testing. The density measurement in accordance with AS/NZS 4456. 8, water absorption test in accordance with BS EN 772 - 21 and salt attack resistance in accordance with AS/NZS 4456. 10 were evaluated on the brick specimens. The results indicated that the density of coal ash brick decreases with the increase in foam content. Also for bricks composed of both blended binder, the water absorption were directly proportional to the amount of foam. Thus, the water absorption of foam brick increases with the reduction in density. Higher foam content leads increase of pores and capillaries in brick structure, therefore the brick become weaker to resist on salt attack. XRD pattern of formed brick with 75 % of foam addition on HL-GGBS coal ash brick portrays ettringite formation were attributed to disruption of brick structure. The use of coal ash with HL–GGBS and PC-GGBS combination as <b>binder</b> <b>agent</b> has been observed to be lightweight, low in water absorption, and advantageous in protection to salt attack compare to the conventional brick.

The type of binder influences the type of solvent used; oil-based fillers usually use mineral spirits, while water-based fillers use water. Both types of filler use silica as a bulking agent as it resists shrinking and swelling in response to changes in temperature and humidity. Other binders may include quartz powder, wood flour, and talc.|$|R
40|$|Starch is an {{important}} ingredient in the food industry where it {{is used as a}} <b>binder,</b> thickener, gelling <b>agent,</b> agglutinant, humectant, and texturizer. It is also used in the manufacture of sausages and other cooked processed meats to give consistency to the product. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of substitution of wheat flour for taro starch (Colocasia esculenta L.) obtained from white and purple varieties on cooking losses and acceptability of a meat emulsion. To evaluate the cooking losses, three different formulations of Frankfurt sausages were prepared, in which wheat flour was replaced by 50...|$|R
