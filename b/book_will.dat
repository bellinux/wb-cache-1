25|$|Israeli Biblical scholar, Rivka Nir wrote: “…this is a serious-minded, thought-provoking and {{interesting}} book, giving expression to an excellent knowledge of early Christian sources {{and the ability}} to analyze and integrate them into a clear and comprehensible picture. The book abounds with historical surveys and enlightening discussions on its sources, terms, characters and various period-related aspects….This <b>book</b> <b>will</b> certainly occupy a highly important place in the scholarly quest for the historical Jesus, as it raises the fundamental question: how far can scholars go in this quest and to what extent are their conclusions founded", but described the thesis as objectionable.|$|E

25|$|At {{the time}} C. S. Lewis wrote Miracles, quantum {{mechanics}} (and physical indeterminism) {{was only in}} the initial stages of acceptance, but still Lewis stated the logical possibility that, if the physical world was proved to be indeterministic, this would provide an entry (interaction) point into the traditionally viewed closed system, where a scientifically described physically probable/improbable event could be philosophically described as an action of a non-physical entity on physical reality. He states, however, that none of the arguments in his <b>book</b> <b>will</b> rely on this. It should also be noted that, while some interpretations of quantum mechanics consider wave function collapse to be indeterminate, in others this event is defined and deterministic.|$|E
