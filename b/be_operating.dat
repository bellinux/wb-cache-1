5|$|A PPF (production {{possibility}} frontier) typically {{takes the}} form of the curve illustrated above. An economy that is operating on the PPF is said to be efficient, meaning that {{it would be impossible to}} produce more of one good without decreasing production of the other good. In contrast, if the economy is operating below the curve, it is said to <b>be</b> <b>operating</b> inefficiently because it could reallocate resources in order to produce more of both goods or some resources such as labor or capital are sitting idle and could be fully employed to produce more of both goods.|$|E
5|$|Both of the {{targeted}} airfields contained sector operations rooms {{from which the}} British fighters were directed into action. These airfields were selected by the Luftwaffe {{because they were the}} largest ones known to <b>be</b> <b>operating</b> RAF fighters. The German intelligence had no knowledge of the sector operations rooms there. The rooms were above ground and had little protection. If these buildings were to be hit, it would be a serious blow to the control system in the region.|$|E

5|$|Oregon imports {{cannabis}} from Washington, California, Mexico and Canada, {{while also}} producing a large quantity locally. Large {{indoor and outdoor}} growing operations have been discovered on private, state, and forest lands, with plants numbering in the thousands. Allegedly large outdoor growing operations run by Mexican cartels drug trafficking were assumed to <b>be</b> <b>operating</b> in remote locations. Highly potent cannabis grown in Oregon is consumed locally, and distributed {{to other parts of}} the U.S.|$|E
5|$|The {{database}} {{was expected}} to cost £224m to set up, spread over three years beginning December 2005 (therefore costing £81m {{a year for the}} first three years), and £41m a year thereafter. The database, which would <b>be</b> <b>operating</b> in 150 local authorities and would be accessible by at least 330,000 users, {{was expected to}} be fully operational by the end of 2008; however, following the 2007 UK child benefit data scandal, the deadline was pushed back for five months to allow a security review prior to implementation. Training for the workers had been planned begin in spring 2008.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} 1971, {{there were}} rising {{tensions}} between India and Pakistan, and after Pakistan declared a national emergency on 23 November, the Indian Navy deployed three s {{in the vicinity of}} Okha, near Karachi, to carry out patrols. As the Pakistani fleet would also <b>be</b> <b>operating</b> in the same waters, the Indian Navy set a demarcation line which ships in their fleet would not cross. Later this deployment proved to be useful for gaining experience in the region's waters. On 3 December, after Pakistan attacked Indian airfields along the border, the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 officially began.|$|E

5|$|Wind {{power is}} variable, and during low wind periods {{it must be}} {{replaced}} by other power sources. Transmission networks presently cope with outages of other generation plants and daily changes in electrical demand, but the variability of intermittent power sources such as wind power, is more frequent than those of conventional power generation plants which, when scheduled to <b>be</b> <b>operating,</b> {{may be able to}} deliver their nameplate capacity around 95% of the time.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{residents}} on farming properties {{to the west}} of York heard a large aircraft flying low over the area. The aircraft seemed to be in trouble because the noise from the engines was changing significantly. At times the engines seemed to <b>be</b> <b>operating</b> normally but on at least one occasion all engine noise ceased for a brief time and then returned as a very loud, high-pitched noise. One resident reported that when all engine noise ceased he could hear a rushing sound until the scream from the engines returned. Several residents reported seeing a bright flash of white light in the distance, followed by a loud crashing and scraping noise. Those closest to the crash could then see the yellow glow of a major fire.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the raid, it was decided by the British naval command that unless {{sufficient}} destroyers were available to protect the barrage, the drifters would have to be withdrawn at night. The drifters would only <b>be</b> <b>operating</b> for less than twelve hours a day, and would have to leave their positions by 15:00 every day. Despite the damage received by the Austro-Hungarian cruisers during the pursuit by Dartmouth and Bristol, the Austro-Hungarian forces inflicted more serious casualties on the Allied blockade. In addition to the sunk and damaged drifters, the cruiser Dartmouth was nearly sunk by the German submarine UC-25, the French destroyer Boutefeu was mined and sunk, and a munitions convoy to Valona was interdicted.|$|E

50|$|There {{were two}} {{schools in the}} neighbourhood. Only one <b>is</b> <b>operating</b> as of November 2012. Dovercourt Elementary School <b>is</b> <b>operated</b> by the Edmonton Public School System. St. Rita Catholic School <b>was</b> <b>operated</b> by the Edmonton Catholic School System.|$|R
5|$|At {{the time}} of the attack, none aboard Centaur {{witnessed}} what had attacked the ship. Due to the ship's position, the distance from shore, and the depth, it was concluded that she was torpedoed by one of the Japanese submarines known to <b>be</b> <b>operating</b> off the Australian east coast. Several survivors later claimed to have heard the attacking submarine moving on the surface while they were adrift, and the submarine was seen by the ship's cook, Francis Martin, who was floating alone on a hatch cover, out of sight from the main cluster of survivors. Martin described the submarine to Naval Intelligence following the survivors' return to land; his description matched the profile of a KD7 type Kaidai-class submarine of the Imperial Japanese Navy.|$|E
5|$|Having finally eluded his pursuers, Bompart made {{directly}} for Lough Swilly where the landing {{was scheduled to}} take place. Unaware of the rebellion's defeat, he hoped that Humbert's army would <b>be</b> <b>operating</b> in the Lough Swilly area, as intended in the campaign planned before Humbert left France. Arriving off the coast, Bompart searched for a suitable landing site {{but was unable to}} find one before dark on 10 October. He waited out the night close to Tory Island, but was surprised the next day by sails on the horizon; Warren's squadron had been joined by Countess's ships, and an overwhelming force was bearing down on the French. Abandoning all notions of landing the troops, Bompart hauled his ships close to the wind to give them room to manoeuvre and allow their captains as much opportunity as possible to escape the approaching British.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, the Nuclear Posture Review study {{determined}} that, of the 18 Ohio SSBNs the U.S. Navy would <b>be</b> <b>operating</b> in total, 14 {{would be}} sufficient for the strategic needs of the U.S. The {{decision was made to}} convert four Ohio-class boats into SSGNs capable of conducting conventional land attack and special operations. As a result, the four oldest boats of the class—Ohio, Michigan, Florida, and Georgia—progressively entered the conversion process in late 2002 and were returned to active service by 2008. The boats could thereafter carry 154 Tomahawk cruise missiles and 66 special operations personnel, among other capabilities and upgrades. The cost to refit the four boats was around US$1billion (2008 dollars) per vessel.|$|E

5|$|Like {{all other}} US states, New Jersey sets a 0.08 percent {{weight by volume}} blood alcohol content (BAC) as the {{threshold}} for intoxication when operating a motor vehicle (e.g. automobile, boat). It is possible {{to be charged with}} driving under the influence (DUI) with a BAC level below 0.08%, but there is a presumption in that situation that the driver is not intoxicated. State law prohibits those under 21 from driving if their BAC is 0.01% or more, prohibits the operation of a commercial vehicle with a BAC of 0.04% or more, and mandates that drivers submit a breath sample if requested by a police officer. To be convicted of DUI in New Jersey, a person must <b>be</b> <b>operating</b> or attempting to operate a motorized vehicle; thus activities such as sleeping in a car while intoxicated or bicycling while drunk are not illegal.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, at 09:35, two USAF F-15C fighter {{aircraft}} {{from the}} 53d Fighter Squadron, piloted by Captain Eric Wickson and Lieutenant Colonel Randy W. May, departed Incirlik AB. Their {{mission was to}} perform an initial fighter sweep of the TAOR to clear the area of any hostile aircraft prior to the entry of coalition forces. The air tasking order (ATO) {{that was supposed to}} list all scheduled coalition aircraft missions for that day and which the two pilots reviewed before takeoff, mentioned that U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopters would <b>be</b> <b>operating</b> in the TAOR that day but did not list takeoff times, routes, or flight durations for them. At 10:15, Wickson radioed Martin on the AWACS and asked if he had any information to pass to them to which Martin replied in the negative.|$|E
5|$|On 13 August 2012, Fuller {{signed for}} League Two side Barnet on a free transfer, along with Gillingham team-mate Curtis Weston. He made his debut for the Bees in a 1–1 draw with Bristol Rovers on 21 August 2012. He {{would go on}} to make 39 league appearances, {{cementing}} his place as the club's first choice right-back. Barnet started the 2012–13 season poorly, failing to win any of their first 12 league matches and were ultimately relegated to the Conference on goal difference after finishing in 23rd place. Barnet's relegation required manager Edgar Davids to release a number of players as an austerity measure to accommodate the fact that the club would <b>be</b> <b>operating</b> on a smaller wage budget in the 2013–14 season, and it was announced on 22 May 2013 that Fuller would be released along with 12 other players.|$|E

5|$|On 14 June 1952, Bleak {{was part}} of a patrol of the 2nd Battalion, 223rd Infantry, sent north to probe Chinese forward {{positions}} and attempt to obtain Chinese prisoners of war for interrogation. Bleak volunteered to accompany the 20-man patrol of an I Platoon on this mission, which was to send them to a sparsely vegetated feature called Hill 499, where Chinese forces were known to <b>be</b> <b>operating.</b> The patrol left United Nations lines at 04:30 Korea Standard Time on 14 June, under cover of darkness. It was preceded by an attack by F Company, 223rd Infantry, to the west which was intended to distract Chinese forces. However, as the patrol ascended the hill, it came under heavy Chinese automatic weapons fire which struck the lead elements, injuring several soldiers. Bleak, {{at the rear of the}} formation, rushed forward and treated and stabilized several soldiers hit in the initial volley, then followed the remainder of the patrol as it continued its mission.|$|E
5|$|On 2 December, The Washington Post {{reported}} an incident involving Montanan. While {{headed down the}} Pacific coast of Mexico with a cargo of dried fruits and canned goods, Montanan was approached by a Japanese warship, which fired a warning shot for Montanan to stop. After doing so, a boarding party with Japanese officers in a launch headed to Montanan. When the American identity of Montanan was established {{to the satisfaction of}} the Japanese, they returned to their ship without boarding Montanan. The news report did not identify the type or the name of the Japanese warship, which had been searching for a German vessel thought to <b>be</b> <b>operating</b> in the area.|$|E
5|$|On 9 July 1806, {{the small}} British brig HMS Rattlesnake under Commander John Bastard was {{cruising}} off the Southern {{coast of the}} British colony of Ceylon in search of French privateers that had been attacking small British traders, known as country ships, in the region. Most notorious of these was the Bellone, known to <b>be</b> <b>operating</b> in the area. In the early afternoon, lookouts on Rattlesnake spotted sails near the Little Basses Reef and approached the ship, which turned with the wind and fled to the southwest. Bastard immediately gave chase, and soon came close enough to identify the vessel as the Bellone. Although Bellone was {{much larger than the}} British warship, Captain Perroud was unwilling to risk his vessel in an unprofitable confrontation with Rattlesnake and seemed to be making an effective withdrawal when, at 15:15, a large ship came within sight directly ahead.|$|E
