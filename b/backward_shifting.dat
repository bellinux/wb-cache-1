The paper shows that the interaction between taxes and the distortions caused by various policies can be important for revenue and efficiency.

30|$|The {{focus will}} be placed on their {{economic}} incidence, i.e., who effectively bears the tax burden and what are its main economic effects (on wages, labour costs and equilibrium employment), {{rather than on the}} legal incidence. 4 This involves analysing the change in behaviour of economic agents after the establishment of the tax. As mentioned above, in the case of social contributions the literature points at two basic shifting processes. Consumers may bear the burden if firms have enough market power to adjust prices to the new tax rates. This is known as forward shifting. Alternatively, employees may bear the burden if the firm offsets the new tax burden with a (net) negative wage variation, leaving labour costs constant, a process known as <b>backward</b> <b>shifting.</b>|$|E
30|$|This is the {{appropriate}} field for the meta-analysis approach. In contrast to these narrative surveys, meta-analysis allows revising the relevant empirical literature in a more formal and objective manner. As summarised by Stanley and Jarrel (1989), 2 meta-analysis starts with the compilation of an exhaustive sample of literature and {{the choice of the}} dependent variable (in our case, the degree of <b>backward</b> <b>shifting</b> of labour taxes, proxied by the estimated elasticity of net wages to taxation). A general set of ‘moderators’, i.e. variables that reflect the quantitative and qualitative features of the different studies that could be influencing their results (theoretical model and sample, among others) is then selected and tabulated using dummy variables. The meta-regression of the dependent variable on these moderators can be used to quantifying the‘ true dependent variable‘, that is, the consensus result of the empirical literature on the effect of taxes on wages after controlling for methodological differences. And also, and probably more important, meta-analysis permits to show which aspects of the modelling, data and econometric techniques are important, or not, for the estimates.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this paper}} is to develop a dynamic model to {{simultaneously}} determine the optimal position of the decoupling point and the optimal path of the production rate as well as the inventory level in a supply chain. With the objective to minimize the total cost of the deviation from the target setting, the closed forms of the optimal solution are derived over a finite planning horizon with deterioration rate under time-varying demand rate. Design/methodology/approach: The Pontryagin's Maximum Principle is employed to explore the optimal position of decoupling point and the optimal production and inventory rate for the proposed dynamic models. The performances of parameters are illustrated through analytical and numerical approaches. Findings: The results denote that the optimal production rate and inventory level are closely related to the target setting which are highly dependent on production policy; meanwhile the optimal decoupling point is exist and unique with the fluctuating of deteriorating rate and product life cycle. The further analyses through both mathematic and numerical approaches indicate that the shorten of product life cycle shifts the optimal decoupling point forward to the end customer meanwhile a <b>backward</b> <b>shifting</b> appears when the deterioration rate increase. Research limitations/implications: There is no shortage allowed and the replacement policy is not taken into account. - 1368 -Journal of Industrial Engineering and Management...|$|E
40|$|Neopercis sex fasciata (Temminck et Schlegel) is a Trachinoid fish, {{inhibiting}} {{sandy bottom}} of the coasts of southern Japan. It attains some 200 mm in total length when full grown. The spawning season seems to extend from early March to early June in Kyushu (Table 1). The author operated artificial insemination of this fish on March 9, 1954, {{on the coast of}} Miyazaki Prefecture, and observed the egg development and hatched larvae (Plate 16, figs. 1 - 11). The egg is bouyant, colorless and spherical in shape, measuring 0. 77 - 0. 93 mm in diameter, with a single colorless oil-globule measuring 0. 16 - 0. 23 mm in diameter (Table 1). The hatching took place about 3 days after insemination (70 - 75 hr.) at the water temperature 12 - 17 ℃. The larva just hatched is 2. 15 - 2. 30 mm in total length with the oil-globule situated in the posterior part of the yolk, partly protruding from the yolk surface. The myotome number is 9 + 25 = 34 (vertebral number of this fish is 10 + 22 = 32) (Fig. 8). 　In four days after hatching the yolk was entirely consumed (Fig. 11).
