40|$|We {{report a}} facile {{approach}} to preparing laponite (LAP) bioceramics via sintering LAP powder compacts for bone tissue engineering applications. The sintering behavior and mechanical properties of LAP compacts under different temperatures, heating rates, and soaking times were investigated. We show that LAP <b>bioceramic</b> {{with a smooth}} and porous surface can be formed at 800 °C with a heating rate of 5 °C/h for 6 h under air. The formed LAP <b>bioceramic</b> was systematically characterized via different methods. Our results reveal that the LAP <b>bioceramic</b> possesses an excellent surface hydrophilicity and serum absorption capacity, and good cytocompatibility and hemocompatibility as demonstrated by resazurin reduction assay of rat mesenchymal stem cells (rMSCs) and hemolytic assay of pig red blood cells, respectively. The potential bone tissue engineering applicability of LAP <b>bioceramic</b> was explored by studying the surface mineralization behavior via soaking in simulated body fluid (SBF), {{as well as the}} surface cellular response of rMSCs. Our results suggest that LAP <b>bioceramic</b> is able to induce hydroxyapatite deposition on its surface when soaked in SBF and rMSCs can proliferate well on the LAP <b>bioceramic</b> surface. Most strikingly, alkaline phosphatase activity together with alizarin red staining results reveal that the produced LAP <b>bioceramic</b> is able to induce osteoblast differentiation of rMSCs in growth medium without any inducing factors. Finally, in vivo animal implantation, acute systemic toxicity test and hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) -staining data demonstrate that the prepared LAP <b>bioceramic</b> displays an excellent biosafety and is able to heal the bone defect.

40|$|Changes in the {{wettability}} {{characteristics of}} an alumina <b>bioceramic</b> occasioned by high power diode laser (HPDL) surface treatment were apparent from the observed {{reduction in the}} contact angle. Such changes were due to the HPDL bringing about reductions the surface roughness, increases in the surface O 2 content and increases in the polar component of the surface energy. Additionally, HPDL treatment of the alumina <b>bioceramic</b> surface was found to effect an improvement in the bonding characteristics by increasing the work of adhesion. An electronic approach was used to elucidate the bonding characteristics of the alumina <b>bioceramic</b> before and after HPDL treatment. It is postulated that HPDL induced changes to the alumina <b>bioceramic</b> produced a surface with a reduced bandgap energy which consequently increased the work of adhesion by increasing the electron transfer at the metal/oxide interface and thus the metal-oxide interactions. Furthermore, {{it is suggested that}} the increase in the work of adhesion of the alumina <b>bioceramic</b> after HPDL treatment was due to a correlation existing between the wettability and ionicity of the alumina bioceramic; for it is believed that the HPDL treated surface is less ionic in nature than the untreated surface and therefore exhibits better wettability characteristics...|$|E
