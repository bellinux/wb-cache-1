Based on the projected neutron fluence values (E > 0. 1 MeV) in the concrete <b>biological</b> <b>shields</b> of the US pressurized water reactor fleet and the currently available data on radiation effects on concrete, some decrease in mechanical properties of concrete cannot be ruled out during extended operation beyond 60 years.
