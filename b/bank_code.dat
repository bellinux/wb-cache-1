In Germany, for example, the German Federal Bank and the German Banking Industry Committee require that all holders of German bank codes ("Bankleitzahl") publish the specifics of their IBAN generation format taking into account not only the generation of check digits but also the handling of legacy bank codes, thereby enabling third parties to generate IBANs independently of the bank. The first such catalogue was published in June 2013 as a variant of the old <b>bank</b> <b>code</b> catalog ("Bankleitzahlendatei").|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the evolution of}} the legal foundation under which commercial banks operated in different countries. The earliest incorporated banks were established under charters issued by sovereigns or legislatures. Subsequently, charters were issued: (1) though corporation law; or (2) via special <b>banking</b> <b>codes.</b> Countries that concentrated their note issues in central banks earlier were less in need of detailed <b>banking</b> <b>codes</b> and were, therefore, more likely to have allowed banks to operate under general corporation laws. By contrast, countries in which note issue was not centralised {{were more likely to have}} established a detailed <b>banking</b> <b>code.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|The <b>Code</b> of <b>Banking</b> Practice {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} {{examples}} of consumer protection provided through self-regulation in the Australian financial services sector. However, since the <b>Banking</b> <b>Code</b> was first released in 1993, the volume of consumer protection legislation applying to banks has increased exponentially and parts of the <b>Banking</b> <b>Code</b> that once provided new consumer rights have now been largely superseded by legislation. In light of the increasingly complex set of laws and regulations that govern the relationship between banks and their consumer and small business customers it could be argued that the <b>Banking</b> <b>Code</b> has a limited future role. However, an analysis of the <b>Banking</b> <b>Code</b> shows that it adds to the consumer protection standards provided by legislation and can continue to facilitate improvements in the standards of subscribing banks and of other institutions in the financial services sector. Self-regulation and industry codes should continue to be part of the regulatory mix. Any regulatory changes that flow from the recent Financial System Inquiry should also facilitate and support the self-regulation role, but the government should also consider further changes to encourage improvements in industry codes and ensure that the implicit regulatory benefits that are provided, in part, because of the existence of industry codes, are made explicit and made available only to code subscribers...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{consider}} whether a move from self-regulation in the form of the <b>Banking</b> <b>Code</b> to statutory regulation by the Financial Services Authority (FSA) of retail banking conduct of business is to be supported. Design/methodology/approach – The paper begins by examining the nature of the self-regulatory process and then considers its strengths and weaknesses in the context of the <b>Banking</b> <b>Code.</b> It then looks at the changes proposed by the FSA. Focusing in particular on the issue of enforcement, the paper contrasts the powers of the <b>Banking</b> <b>Code</b> Standards Board and the FSA. Findings – The paper concludes that, while a move to statutory regulation is to be supported, there is concern about whether such a move will bring the benefits that might have been expected. Practical implications – More attention needs to be paid to the ways that different forms of regulation operate in practice, with empirical research particularly valuable. Originality/value – The paper adds to the (relatively brief?) literature on consumer protection in banking, and the even briefer body of research on self-regulation.
