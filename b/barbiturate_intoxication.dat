The coroner’s report cited “pulmonary {{congestion}} and edema” and “marked coronary and aortic narrowing” as the probable causes. However, a second cause of death might have been <b>barbiturate</b> <b>intoxication.</b> The drug in question was Tuinal, which was sometimes prescribed to insomniacs to help induce sleep.

5000|$|On September 3, 1970, Wilson {{was found}} dead on a {{hillside}} behind bandmate Bob Hite's Topanga Canyon home; he was 27 years old.

He was briefly hospitalized for significant depression, and was released after a few weeks. Although his death is sometimes reported as a suicide, this is not clearly established and he left no note. Wilson's death came just {{two weeks before the}} death of Jimi Hendrix and four weeks before the death of Janis Joplin, two artists who also died at the same age.Along with his talent and intellect, Wilson had a reputation for social awkwardness and introversion which may have contributed to his depression.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Barbiturate</b> <b>intoxication</b> is {{potentially}} lethal. With {{the availability of}} the newer anticonvulsants the use of barbiturates in treating epilepsy has decreased significantly, with a concurrent decrease in the incidence of overdose with these medications. There have, however, been recent alarm signals from governmental sources concerning the increase in the Internet purchase of illegal medications, including barbiturates, for use in attempted suicide. CASE DESCRIPTION: Here we describe two patient cases involving <b>barbiturate</b> <b>intoxication</b> with amobarbital and thiopental, respectively. They had both obtained the barbiturates via the Internet. Both patients were comatose and showed signs of respiratory depression; one of them was also haemodynamically unstable. Both patients recovered fully following intensive supportive therapy. CONCLUSION: In patients with coma, respiratory depression, absence of brainstem reflexes and shock with no evident cause one {{should be aware of the}} possibility of <b>barbiturate</b> <b>intoxication,</b> even when there is no indication that these have been prescribed or that the patient has direct or indirect access to barbiturates. Prompt, optimal supportive therapy will give a good chance of full somatic recovery...|$|E
40|$|<b>BARBITURATE</b> <b>intoxication</b> is an {{important}} cause of morbidity and mortality. The following case report describes a severe case of <b>barbiturate</b> <b>intoxication</b> in which hemodialysis, as recently recommended by Kyle 2 and Alwall, 1 was applied. Since we have noted reports of only five patients with <b>barbiturate</b> <b>intoxication</b> 1 _ 4 treated by hemodialysis, the striking clinical changes in a patient during hemo-dialysis prompted a report of this case. CASE REPORT A 63 year old white married woman {{was admitted to the}} Albany Hospital Emer-gency Room in coma at 5 : 00 p. m. Her husband related that the patient had been moody and depressed for the previous four weeks. At 1 : 00 p. m. on the day of admission he found the patient staggering about the house. Three hours later he found her lying unresponsive beside an empty bottle of meperidine hydrochloride and an empty bottle of Tuinal (equal parts of amobarbital and secobarbital).

40|$|Thirty-eight {{patients}} in coma due to head trauma, cerebrovascular accidents, hypoxia, hypoglycaemia, or <b>barbiturate</b> <b>intoxication,</b> and 15 cases of brain death were studied. Cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO 2) {{was obtained from}} the arteriovenous oxygen difference and cerebral blood flow (CBF) measured by intra-arterial 133 Xenon method. If hypothermia and CNS depressants were excluded, CMRO 2 below one-third of normal was incompatible with regaining of consciousness, but this was seen in only three comatose patients. Irrespective of the clinical outcome (death, vegetative survival, or recovery), CMRO 2 values of one-third to two-thirds of normal were seen in the majority of coma patients. CMRO 2 measurements were of no practical value to predict the prognosis in coma, even when the effect of temperature and sedatives were considered. In brain death the CBF studies gave indirect evidence of cerebral circulatory arrest. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was obtained for analysis of lactate, pyruvate, and bicarbonate in 29 cases. Increased CSF lactate levels were found in all groups except <b>barbiturate</b> <b>intoxication.</b> The finding of a negative correlation between CSF bicarbonate and log CBF suggests that the CSFpH determines the wide range of CBF in coma...|$|E

40|$|A {{method is}} {{presented}} for the rapid gas chromatographic determination of barbiturates and glutethimide in serum, {{suitable for use}} in clinical emer-gencies. The sample is prepared for gas chromatography by acidification and a single extraction with chloroform. From 70 to 100 % of the various barbiturates and glutethimide are analytically recovered, with a coefficient of variation of 8 to 10 % for the method. During a 10 -month clinical evalua-tion (87 requested determinations), 34 analyses (39 % of the samples sub-miffed) were positive for barbiturates, glutethimide, or both. OVERDOSAGE WITH HYPNOTICS and sedatives is potentially fatal. Rapid analytical procedures for identifying and quantitating such compounds in the blood are essential to patient treatment (1). <b>Barbiturate</b> <b>intoxication</b> {{is one of the}} most com-mon forms of poisoning (2, 3); glutethimide (2 -ethyl- 2 -phenyl-glutarimide) poisoning is less fre...|$|E
40|$|A 48 {{year old}} man with a {{diagnosis}} of HIV infection since 1993, on highly active anti-retro viral therapy (HAART) with stable CD 4 count and undetectable viral load for years and seizure disorder presented with recurrent drowsiness. His seizures were well controlled on phenobarbitone for years. Repeated laboratory evaluation demonstrated toxic levels of phenobarbitone in his blood. A thorough clinical, psychiatric, laboratory and imaging evaluation did not reveal any obvious etiology for the recurrent <b>barbiturate</b> <b>intoxication</b> in this man. Our findings suggest the possible diagnosis of barbiturate drug automatism in this patient. Though drug automatism is a controversial entity, it merits continued attention. There are recent reports of similar phenomenon with newer sedative agents such as Zolpidem. It is important to be aware of this phenomenon as a possible explanation for recurrent intoxication with barbiturates without a clear etiology for drug overdose...|$|E
40|$|IN {{the process}} of {{recording}} from {{a large number of}} patients admitted to this hospital in comatose states, it has been observed that individuals rendered unconscious by barbiturate drugs present a remarkably homo-geneous EEG pattern. This pattern can be clearly differentiated from the recordings obtained in comatose states induced by all other agents and pathophysiologic mechanisms that have come under our observation. The characteristic EEG pattern of <b>barbiturate</b> <b>intoxication</b> consists of a random frequency high voltage type. Slow waves occur in isolated and short sequences of sinusoidal 160 to 250 millisecond waves and in non-sinusoidal (or complex sinusoidal) slower discharges at around 300 milli-seconds in duration. These latter waves often have higher frequency oscilla-tions superimposed. The higher frequency waves occur in two main bands; the first ranges between 12 and IS waves per second and the second ranges around 18 to 24 per second. The randomly admixed waveforms of rela-tively high voltage give the general pattern an irregular modulation...|$|E
40|$|The {{complications}} {{encountered in}} caring for 185 patients intoxicated with barbiturates were reviewed. The population consisted of 142 patients with long-acting barbiturate concentrations of 8 mg per 100 ml or greater, 20 patients with short-acting barbiturate concentrations of 3 mg per 100 ml or greater and 23 consecutive patients with short-acting <b>barbiturate</b> <b>intoxication</b> referred for monitoring. Pneumonia was the major cause {{of morbidity and mortality}} and correlated best with the initial depth of coma and the use of an endotracheal tube in treatment. Cardiovascular instability manifested by pulmonary edema was the next leading cause of morbidity and mortality and correlated best with the initial depth of coma and the quantity of intravenous fluid administered. In retrospect, use of eliminative measures such as dialysis would probably not have altered the outcome in most of the patients who died and attempts at forced diuresis may have contributed to several deaths. Particular emphasis should be placed on the problems of sepsis and fluid therapy in the management of these patients...|$|E
40|$|Unconsciousness as {{the result}} of an {{overdose}} of a barbiturate drug is becoming a familiar problem to the clinician. Usually the diagnosis is rendered easy by a history of ingestion of sleeping tal) lets. The depth of narcosis, however, is apt to be difficult to determine. The blood pressure, reflex changes, the response to painful stimuli, and size of pupils are helpful, but may be confusing and con-flicting. The complications of <b>barbiturate</b> <b>intoxication,</b> namely hypoventilation and pulmonary atelectasis (Swank and Smedal) may be equally misleading. They cause an increased secretion of fluid into t. he air passages, the result of hypoxia and hypercapnia (Drinker, 1945); and a falling blood pressure and further depression of respirations. Contrarily, attention has been drawn to the fact that hypoxia may also stimulate breathing and mask serious barbiturate depression. (Beecher and Moyer, 1941.) Since the usual criteria for judging the depth of barbiturate narcosis clinically are frequently unreliable, further investigation of the physiologic changes which occur during narcosis are indicated. In the present study the brain waves...|$|E
40|$|ALTHOUGH it {{is known}} that abrupt {{withdrawal}} of barbiturates from persons who have been chronically intoxicated with large amounts of these drugs may precipitate a serious abstinence syndrome, 1 * 2 a review of the American literature revealed no report in which death was attributed to abstinence from barbiturates. Three cases in which death was associated with withdrawal of barbiturates were found in the German literature. Two of these cases were complicated by the presence of organic disease (Buerger's disease with gangrene, and acute yellow atrophy of the liver with blood dyscrasia), so that abstinence from barbiturates could be regarded only as a contributing factor to death. In the third patient 3 no complicating disease was found on physical examination, and death was in all probability due to withdrawal of barbiturates. The usual course of the barbiturate abstinence syndrome may be described as follows: Upon abrupt withdrawal of barbiturates from individuals who have been ingesting 0. 8 gm. or more daily of one of the potent barbiturates (secobarbital, pentobarbital, amobarbital), signs of <b>barbiturate</b> <b>intoxication</b> disappear in th...|$|E
40|$|The {{benzodiazepine}} receptor inverse agonist 6, 7 -dimethoxy- 4 -ethyl- 3 -carbomethoxy-beta-carboline (DMCM) (1. 5 - 15 mg/kg) {{was administered}} to mice 5 min after a lethal (LD 94) injection of pentobarbital. DMCM (1. 5 - 5 mg/kg) increased short-term (1 h) survival in a dose-dependent fashion, with an optimum survival rate {{more than five times}} greater than mice receiving pentobarbital alone. Statistically significant increases in long-term (24 h) survival were also observed after both 5 and 10 mg/kg of DMCM (34 and 33 %, respectively) compared with animals receiving pentobarbital alone (6 %). Two doses of DMCM (5 and 2. 5 mg/kg, respectively) administered 55 min apart produced an even greater increase (58 %) in 24 -h survival rates. Doses of DMCM that increased 1 - and 24 -h survival were not lethal when administered alone, and were below the dose that produced convulsions in 50 % (CD 50) of the animals. The protective effects of DMCM were blocked by pretreatment with the benzodiazepine receptor agonist ethyl- 8 -fluoro- 5, 6 -dihydro- 5 -methyl- 6 -oxo- 4 H-imidazo[1, 5 a][1, 4]benzodiazodiazepine- 3 -carboxylate (Ro 15 - 1788), which suggests the effects of DMCM are mediated through the benzodiazepine receptor. These findings suggest that DMCM or another benzodiazepine receptor ligand with full inverse agonist qualities could prove effective as an antidote for <b>barbiturate</b> <b>intoxication</b> in man...|$|E
40|$|The {{diagnosis}} of <b>barbiturate</b> <b>intoxication</b> is usually made from circumstantial evidence {{coupled with a}} characteristic, if non-specific, clinical picture. The need for a confirmatory laboratory test is often felt. Riley, Krause, Steadman, Hunter, and Hodge (1940) have described the shortcomings of the com-monly used cobalt co'our reactions. The extrac-tion of barbiturate crystals and the determination of their melting point must remain the most satis-factory method of analysis for medico-legal work, but this technique is limited in clinical practice by the large quantities of biological material required {{and by the time}} involved in the extraction and purification processes. During the past decade research has proceeded along a number of lines, including ultra-violet and infra-red spectroscopy, x-ray crystallography, and paper chromatography. Most attention has been directed to ultra-violet spectrophotometry, which is at present the most practicable procedure in view of available suitable equipment. The details of procedure and the form of the absorption curve are similar for all but the thio-barbiturates, which absorb in a different region of the spectrum, but the general shape of the absorption curve is of some, though limited, qualitative value in identi-fying the particular barbiturate present. The ultra-violet absorption spectra of barbiturate compounds have of course been known for many years. In 1940 Stuckey studied the absorption of a number of derivatives in acid and alkaline solution and came to important conclusions about their characteristics from which he suggested that the technique might be applicable to the analysis of tissues containing barbiturate. At the same time Elvidge (1940) assayed barbiturate tablets by thi...|$|E
40|$|Zoo animals, {{including}} tigers, {{have been}} reported to suffer from <b>barbiturate</b> <b>intoxication,</b> with pentabarbitone being most commonly recorded. Clinical signs range from mild ataxia to general anaesthesia with recovery over hours to days with several factors affecting hepatic barbiturate metabolism and tissue partitioning. Botulism is an often fatal intoxication in man, animals, birds and certain fish. The occurrence in carnivores is uncommon to rare, with only 2 reports found of botulism in felids. This report relates to 3 adult captive cohabiting tigers that simultaneously developed signs of abdominal discomfort, progressive ataxia, recumbency and comatose sleep resembling stage 2 anaesthesia, alternating with periods of distracted wakefulness and ataxic movements. These signs occurred 4 days after being fed the carcass of a horse that had ostensibly died of colic and not been euthanased. The male tiger that was the dominant animal in the feeding hierarchy was worst affected and had to be given intravenous fluids. The female that was lowest in hierarchy was unaffected. After 48 - 72 hours of treatment at the Onderstepoort Veterinary Academic Hospital the females could eat and made an uneventful recovery. The male tiger showed partial recovery but died during the night a few hours after drinking water on his return to the owner. Necropsy revealed severe oesophageal dilation and impaction with decaying grass; some of this material and water were present in the pharynx and trachea, and had been aspirated causing acute widespread bronchopneumonia. Colon content tested negative for common pesticides but, together with liver, tested positive for barbiturate. Serum taken on the day of admission had tested negative for barbiturate and the residual serum from the 3 animals later tested negative for botulinum toxin. Colon and oesophageal content from the male at necropsy were positive for Clostridium botulinum toxin type C by the mouse bioassay neutralisation test, confirming that this male had had concomitant barbiturate toxicity and botulism, and had succumbed to aspiration bronchopneumonia secondary to pharyngeal, laryngeal and oesophageal paralysis and oesophageal impaction.
