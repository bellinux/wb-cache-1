5|$|In the 1953 New Jersey {{state highway}} renumbering, the state {{highways}} running concurrent with US 1/9 were removed, while Route 25T became US 1/9 Truck and Route 25 between the Tonnele Circle and the Holland Tunnel became US 1/9 <b>Business</b> (<b>now</b> Route 139). In 1964, the US 1/9 {{approaches to the}} George Washington Bridge, which were shared with US 46 on the New Jersey side, were rebuilt into a freeway that {{became a part of}} I-95. Between February 2006 and November 2008, the cloverleaf interchange with Route 35 in Woodbridge Township, which was the first cloverleaf interchange in the United States built in 1929 when this portion of US 1/9 was a part of Route 25, was replaced with a partial cloverleaf interchange, costing $34 million.|$|E

25|$|Traditional {{business}} suits are generally in solid colours or with pin stripes; windowpane checks are also acceptable.

The colour of the patterned element (stripes, plaids, and checks) varies by gender and location. For example, bold checks, particularly with tweeds, have fallen out of use in the US, while {{they continue to be}} worn as traditionally in Britain.

The development of technical and commercial expertise in all stages of this vertical integration, from the initial search for oil (exploration) through its harvesting (production), transportation, refining and finally trading and marketing established the core competencies on which the company was founded. Similar competencies were required for natural gas, which {{has become one of}} the most important businesses in which Shell is involved, and which contributes a significant proportion of the company's profits.

25|$|Over {{the next}} several years, many changes to the route were spurred by the {{creation}} of the United States Highway system. In 1927, US 90 was newly designated in Texas over a route that replaced the portion of SH 54 between Alpine and the combined route of the new US 80 and SH 1 in Van Horn. In 1932, US 62 was created along SH 54 from the state line to SH 130 and then along SH 130 to El Paso. By 1933, SH 3 was realigned westward concurrently with US 90 to Van Horn. SH 54 and SH 130 kept their designations as concurrent routes to US 62. Between 1936 and 1940, US 90 was extended northward through Van Horn to US 62. On September 26, 1939, SH 54 and intersecting routes SH 1, SH 3, and SH 130 were all decommissioned in favor of their redundant U.S. highway routes. The decommissioning of SH 54 was short lived as US 90 was shortened on August 16, 1940 back to its previous terminus at US 80 in Van Horn, and SH 54 was again designated between Van Horn and US 62. In 1943, US 180 was designated over the route of US 62 at the northern terminus of SH 54. In 1953, construction began on FM 2185 from SH 54 in Van Horn into northeastern Culberson County. On July 30, 1976, SH 54 extended westward over Loop 519 (US 80 <b>Business)</b> (<b>now</b> BI 10-D) and southward over US 90 to I-10.|$|E

500|$|The Trenton Freeway, {{a freeway}} {{through the city}} of Trenton, was first planned in 1950 to provide a bypass of Trenton and a {{connection}} to the new Trenton–Morrisville Toll Bridge. This freeway opened in December 1952 and became part of both US 1 and Route 26. In the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering that followed a month later, all the state highways running concurrent with US 1 were removed. In addition, US 1/9 Truck was designated as a bypass of the Pulaski Skyway (replacing Route 25T) and US 1/9 <b>Business</b> (<b>now</b> Route 139) was designated on the former Route 25 between the Tonnele Circle and the Holland Tunnel.

500|$|In May 1948, {{eccentric}} aviation tycoon {{and occasional}} movie producer Howard Hughes {{gained control of}} the company, beating out British film magnate J. Arthur Rank as the buyer of Odlum's interest. During Hughes's tenure, RKO suffered its worst years since the early 1930s, as his capricious management style took a heavy toll. Production chief Schary quit almost immediately due to his new boss's interference and Rathvon soon followed. Within weeks of taking over, Hughes had dismissed three-fourths of the work force; production was virtually shut down for six months as the conservative Hughes shelved or canceled several of the [...] "message pictures" [...] that Schary had backed. Once shooting picked up again, Hughes quickly became notorious for meddling in minute production matters, particularly the presentation of actresses he favored. All of the Big Five saw their profits dwindle in 1948—from Fox, down 11%, to Loew's/MGM, down 62%—but at RKO they virtually vanished: from $5.1 million in 1947 to $0.5 million, a drop of 90%.
