5|$|Air {{conditioning}} – Ambulances {{are often}} {{fitted with a}} separate air conditioning system to serve the working area from that which serves the cab. This helps to maintain an appropriate temperature for any patients being treated, <b>but</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> feature additional features such as filtering against airborne pathogens.|$|E
5|$|Pathogenic {{micro-organisms}} include bacteria, fungi, and viruses. They kill or debilitate {{their host}} and are relatively host-specific. Various microbial insect diseases occur naturally, <b>but</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> {{be used as}} biological pesticides. When naturally occurring, these outbreaks are density-dependent in that they generally only occur as insect populations become denser.|$|E
5|$|The {{breeding}} {{habitat is}} subarctic willow and birch forests, and open coniferous woodland, often close to rivers or bogs, although pairs {{are also found}} in mountains and spruce taiga. In winter, the Siberian accentor occupies bushes and shrubs, often near streams, <b>but</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> be found in dry grassland and woods.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} hole in {{the roof}} for the entry of the pigeons was covered by a flat stone and is now covered with glass to keep the interior dry. The interior of the roof has putlog holes rather than nesting boxes <b>but</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> {{have been used by}} pigeons.|$|E
5|$|The spermatophores usually remain {{embedded}} {{near the}} mouth of the female. Mating usually occurs well before spawning, <b>but</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> happen on the spawning grounds themselves. In those cases, the male will stay near the female's side as she lays eggs.|$|E
5|$|Beetle {{antennae}} {{are primarily}} organs of sensory perception and can detect motion, odour and chemical substances, <b>but</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> {{be used to}} physically feel a beetle's environment. Beetle families may use antennae in different ways. For example, when moving quickly, tiger beetles {{may not be able}} to see very well and instead hold their antennae rigidly in front of them in order to avoid obstacles.|$|E

5000|$|Narrative film usually uses {{images and}} sounds on film (or, more recently, on {{analogue}} or digital video media) to convey a story. Narrative film is usually thought of in terms of fiction <b>but</b> it <b>may</b> <b>also</b> assemble stories from filmed reality, as in some documentary film, <b>but</b> narrative film <b>may</b> <b>also</b> use animation.|$|R

5|$|Both species {{live on the}} ground, {{are active}} during the night, are solitary, and feed mainly on fruits and seeds, <b>but</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> eat herbs and insects. They build nests of leaves and {{branches}} among vegetation, for example in a tree hollow, or under rocks. In Panama, T.talamancae breeds throughout the year and the average litter size is about six. Various species of mites, chiggers, fleas, and sucking lice have been recorded as parasites on both species.|$|E
5|$|Dietary {{supplements}} often contain vitamins, <b>but</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> {{include other}} ingredients, such as minerals, herbs, and botanicals. Scientific evidence supports {{the benefits of}} dietary supplements for persons with certain health conditions. In some cases, vitamin supplements may have unwanted effects, especially if taken before surgery, with other dietary supplements or medicines, or if the person taking them has certain health conditions. They may also contain levels of vitamins many times higher, and in different forms, than one may ingest through food.|$|E
5|$|Fighting {{games are}} {{a type of}} action game where two {{on-screen}} characters fight each other. These games typically feature special moves that are triggered using rapid sequences of carefully timed button presses and joystick movements. Games traditionally show fighters from a side-view, even as the genre has progressed from two-dimensional (2D) to three-dimensional (3D) graphics. Street Fighter II, though not the first fighting game, popularized and standardized the conventions of the genre, and similar games released prior to Street Fighter II have since been more explicitly classified as fighting games. Fighting games typically involve hand-to-hand combat, <b>but</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> feature melee weapons.|$|E

5|$|Hygrophorus olivaceoalbus creates mycorrhizae with conifers. In the West Coast of the United States, {{associations}} are most common with Sitka spruces and giant redwoods. In the Rocky Mountains it associates with Engelmann spruce and blue spruce, and in northeast North America with hemlocks. It usually favours acidic and chalky ground with mosses in higher altitudes {{as well as}} conifer forests and occasionally mixed forests. The fruit bodies are often found singly, <b>but</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> grow in clusters.|$|E
5|$|Immune {{complexes}} (aggregations of antigens, complement proteins, and IgG and IgM antibodies) {{deposited in}} various tissues trigger Type III hypersensitivity reactions. Type IV hypersensitivity (also known as cell-mediated or delayed type hypersensitivity) usually takes {{between two and}} three days to develop. Type IV reactions are involved in many autoimmune and infectious diseases, <b>but</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> involve contact dermatitis (poison ivy). These reactions are mediated by T cells, monocytes, and macrophages.|$|E
5|$|Leopards {{are found}} in hilly areas <b>but</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> venture into the low land jungles. Small cats in the park include the jungle cat, fishing cat and leopard cat. Other mammals include barking deer, sambar deer, hog deer and chital, sloth and Himalayan black bears, Indian grey mongoose, otters, yellow-throated martens, Himalayan goral, Indian pangolins, and langur and rhesus macaques. Owls and nightjars can be heard during the night.|$|E

5|$|Ninety-five {{per cent}} of bird species are {{socially}} monogamous. These species pair {{for at least}} the length of the breeding season or—in some cases—for several years or until the death of one mate. Monogamy allows for both paternal care and biparental care, which is especially important for species in which females require males' assistance for successful brood-rearing. Among many socially monogamous species, extra-pair copulation (infidelity) is common. Such behaviour typically occurs between dominant males and females paired with subordinate males, <b>but</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> be the result of forced copulation in ducks and other anatids.|$|E
5|$|Non-aggravated {{offences}} involving damage {{valued at}} less than £5,000 are triable only summarily by magistrates and the maximum sentence is three months' imprisonment and a fine of £2,500. If {{the value of the}} property damaged exceeds £5,000, the defendant is entitled to claim trial on indictment by a jury, but if tried summarily, may be sentenced to up to six months in jail and a £5,000 fine. Where the value of the property is unclear, the court may hear representations as to value, <b>but</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> offer the defendant the option of summary trial, with limited penalties.|$|E
5|$|The artery has a {{variable}} origin. It mostly {{arises from the}} brachiocephalic trunk, <b>but</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> originate from the aortic arch, the right common carotid, the subclavian, the pericardiacophrenic artery, the thyrocervical trunk, the transverse scapular or the internal thoracic artery. It ascends {{in front of the}} trachea in the superior mediastinum to {{the lower part of the}} thyroid gland.|$|E

5|$|The objects {{created by}} amphiphiles are usually spherical (as {{in the case}} of micelles), <b>but</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> be disc-like (bicelles), rod-like, or biaxial (all three micelle axes are distinct). These {{anisotropic}} self-assembled nano-structures can then order themselves {{in much the same way}} as thermotropic liquid crystals do, forming large-scale versions of all the thermotropic phases (such as a nematic phase of rod-shaped micelles).|$|E
5|$|The shape, size, {{insertion}} and {{origin of}} the arch can vary widely. The arch usually occurs {{on both sides of}} the body; <b>but</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> occur only on one side. The muscular component of the arch varies, with some arches seen to be purely fibrous. The origin can be a direct continuation of the latissimus dorsi muscle fibres, originate with the tendinous element of the latissimus dorsi, or be a mixture of the two types originating from both the muscle and the tendon.|$|E
5|$|Vertebral {{dissection}} {{may occur}} after physical {{trauma to the}} neck, such as a blunt injury (e.g. traffic collision), strangulation or manipulation, <b>but</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> happen spontaneously. 1–4% of spontaneous cases have a clear underlying connective tissue disorder affecting the blood vessels. Treatment is usually with either antiplatelet drugs such as aspirin or with anticoagulants such as heparin or warfarin.|$|E
