500|$|Though {{the band}} have been labeled emo, {{they have tried}} to avoid writing in that fashion. Grand Unification and One Day Son, This Will All <b>Be</b> <b>Yours</b> themes were apocalyptic, and {{subsequent}} work varied from patriotism ("The English Way") to self-loathing ("Damocles" [...] and [...] "Animal").

500|$|In {{his review}} of Grand Unification (2006), Vik Bansal of MusicOMH wrote about their varied dynamics: [...] "Where others are happy to be one-dimensional, Fightstar are not content unless a song moves fluidly through {{seemingly}} incongruous but ultimately coherent moods and musical dynamics. The interspersion of thoroughly heavy metal sections within the otherwise widescreen rock of 'Grand Unification Pt I' and 'Sleep Well Tonight' encapsulates this perfectly". One Day Son, This Will All <b>Be</b> <b>Yours</b> showed the band expanding their sound and pushing further into both lighter and heavier territories, {{with a mixture of}} more melodic soundscapes and heavier metallic styles. According to Q magazine, [...] "The intricate instrumental passages, multi-tracked vocal harmonies and pounding riffs hint at Muse-scale ambition and intellect". The Sun described One Day Son, This Will All <b>Be</b> <b>Yours</b> sound as [...] "heavier, slicker and as focused as ever, tracks such as '99' and 'We Apologise For Nothing' embrace an epic, panoramic sound that sweeps you off your feet. It’s aggressive but emotive, with heaps of melody among the huge riffs." ...|$|E
500|$|After leaving Island Records {{due to a}} {{disagreement}} over the band's artistic direction, Fightstar signed with the independent label Institute Records (a division of Gut Records) for their second album.

The band recorded One Day Son, This Will All <b>Be</b> <b>Yours</b> in Los Angeles with Matt Wallace, who had produced Angel Dust (1992) by Faith No More (one of Simpson's favorite groups).|$|E
500|$|The band {{released}} {{their debut}} studio album, Grand Unification, the following year; Kerrang! editor Paul Brannigan called it [...] "one {{of the best}} British rock albums of the last decade".

A compilation album including B-sides and rarities, Alternate Endings, was released the following year.

500|$|To {{promote the}} album, Fightstar {{initially}} released the free downloadable single [...] "99" [...] in May 2007. The track, about being {{haunted by the}} loss of a loved one, was made available on the band's microsite with a music video. Its first official single, [...] "We Apologise for Nothing", was released in September and reached number 63 on the UK Singles Chart. The third single, [...] "Deathcar", was the first official UK VinylDisc release. The song, inspired by a harrowing documentary about Chinese execution vans and the end of Simpson's romantic relationship, produced a low-fi music video which cost £500 to make. The VinylDisc single reached number 92 on the UK Singles Chart, peaking at number two on the Indie and Rock Charts in its first week. The fourth single, [...] "Floods", was released the following March. The band wrote it amid growing concern about global warming after they saw Al Gore's documentary, An Inconvenient Truth. Fightstar performed the song on Colin Murray's BBC Radio 1 live sessions. The band went on a 10-date UK tour in May 2008, supported by the London four-piece Brigade.

2500|$|In {{connection}} with the rebus mentioned, a tale is told of one Allan of Stewarton who was rowing a Scottish chief off the Ayrshire coast.

Bear me to safety and you will have the rich lands of Carmelside, wuth silver to build yourself a castle. Hill and valley and rivers of fish will <b>be</b> <b>yours</b> .... but just row, Allan, row! Allan won his prize and named the estate 'Rowallan' after his adventure. The same story is told in the form of a poem written by the Rev.

He is just your slave and the Greeks will have but a poor triumph. As for yourself, you will be going home with the object for your campaign accomplished, for you have burnt Athens".|$|E
