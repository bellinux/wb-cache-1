Enzymatic reactions do, in principle, allow the transformation of these raw materials into <b>biorenewables</b> under mild and sustainable conditions. There are a few examples of processes using immobilised enzymes that are already applied on an industrial scale, such as the production of High-Fructose Corn Syrup, but these are still rather rare. Fortunately, there is a rapid expansion in the research efforts that try to improve this, driven by a combination of economic and ecological reasons. This review focusses on those efforts, by looking at attempts to use fatty acids, carbohydrates, proteins and lignin (and their building blocks), as substrates in the synthesis of <b>biorenewables</b> using immobilised enzymes. Therefore, many examples (390 references) from the recent literature are discussed, in which we look both at the specific reactions as well as to the methods of immobilisation of the enzymes, as the latter are shown to be a crucial factor with respect to stability and reuse. The applications of the renewables produced in this way range from building blocks for the pharmaceutical and polymer industry, transport fuels, to additives for the food industry. A critical evaluation of the relevant factors that need to be improved for large-scale use of these examples is presented in the outlook of this review...|$|R

40|$|Background Construction of {{microbial}} biocatalysts for {{the production}} of <b>biorenewables</b> at economically viable yields and titers is frequently hampered by product toxicity. Membrane damage is often deemed as the principal mechanism of this toxicity, particularly in regards to decreased membrane integrity. Previous studies have attempted to engineer the membrane with the goal of increasing membrane integrity. However, most of these works focused on engineering of phospholipids and efforts to identify membrane proteins that can be targeted to improve fatty acid production have been unsuccessful. Results Here we show that deletion of outer membrane protein ompF significantly increased membrane integrity, fatty acid tolerance and fatty acid production, possibly due to prevention of re-entry of short chain fatty acids. In contrast, deletion of fadL resulted in significantly decreased membrane integrity and fatty acid production. Consistently, increased expression of fadL remarkably increased membrane integrity and fatty acid tolerance while also increasing the final fatty acid titer. This 34 % increase in the final fatty acid titer was possibly due to increased membrane lipid biosynthesis. Tuning of fadL expression showed that there is a positive relationship between fadL abundance and fatty acid production. Combinatorial deletion of ompFand increased expression of fadL were found to have an additive role in increasing membrane integrity, and was associated with a 53 % increase the fatty acid titer, to 2. 3 g/L. Conclusions These results emphasize the importance of membrane proteins for maintaining membrane integrity and production of <b>biorenewables,</b> such as fatty acids, which expands the targets for membrane engineering...|$|R
40|$|Given the {{increased}} interest in biofuels and other <b>biorenewables,</b> a separate Energy Title is being considered for the 2007 Farm Bill. The added benefits and costs of such government intervention need to be weighed carefully. The United States has conducted an interesting social experiment with ethanol {{over the last three}} decades. The federal government and some state governments have provided incentives to increase both corn grain ethanol production and consumption to improve local air quality, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and provide a substitute fuel from renewable resource that could serve to improve energy security. The experiment was successful, but in large part because the price of crude oil increased. Pushing this experiment further will eventually lead the added costs to outweigh the added benefits. Further expansion is typically justified on grounds of moving to biomass-based ethanol, which is purported to have even greater environmental and development benefits.

40|$|Iowa State University Facilities, Planning, and Management is {{concerned}} with new LEED buildings on campus consuming more energy than originally predicted from the building energy models created as part of LEED certification requirements. The objective of this research project is to compare the actual and predicted energy consumption of the <b>Biorenewables</b> Research Laboratory (BRL), a 2011 LEED Gold building, to determine the magnitude and cause(s) of this discrepancy. This will lead to re-evaluation of energy model assumptions to improve future models of campus buildings. This objective will be accomplished through analysis of energy model and utility billing data, using historical weather data to weather-normalize energy use. The preliminary results of this research project conclude, when weather normalized, BRL is consuming roughly 4 % less energy, but spending 25 % more on utility bills than the model originally predicted. Utility rates have been much higher than those used to calculate costs in the energy model. As utility costs are not exclusively influenced by energy consumption alone, future energy models should improve how utility rates are incorporated.

40|$|The {{production}} of bio-based chemicals has received tremendous attention in recent years, but {{little has been}} done to understand the broad patterns of the economics of different processes for making these molecules. The diversity of potential chemicals simultaneously makes such an understanding both important and difficult to glean during these early-stages. By using cost correlations and standard scale-factors, a spreadsheet-based early-stage cost estimation tool was developed. The tool, named BioPET (<b>Biorenewables</b> Process Evaluation Tool), allows users to specify up to seven primary unit operations (fermentation, separation, three catalytic stages, and purification), and basic defining inputs for each operation. With these inputs, BioPET computes an estimated minimum selling price for the pathway of interest. Validation of BioPET was conducted by comparing results to literature values and a commercial economic analysis tool for three molecules: ethanol, succinic acid, and adipic acid.

40|$|The {{equilibrium}} moisture content (EMC) of biomass affects transportation, storage, downstream feedstock processing, and the overall economy of <b>biorenewables</b> production. Torrefaction is a thermochemical process conducted in the temperature regime between 200 and 300 °C under an inert atmosphere that, among other benefits, aims to reduce the innate hydrophilicity and susceptibility to microbial degradation of biomass. The EMC of raw corn stover, along with corn stover thermally pretreated at three temperatures, was measured using the static gravimetric method at equilibrium relative humidity (ERH) and temperatures ranging from 10 to 98 % and from 10 to 40 °C, respectively. Microbial degradation of the samples was tested at 97 % ERH and 30 °C. Fiber analyses were conducted on all samples. In general, torrefied biomass showed an EMC lower than raw biomass, which implied an increase in hydrophobicity. Corn stover torrefied at 250 and 300 °C had negligible dry matter mass loss due to microbial degradation. Fiber analysis showed {{a significant decrease in}} hemicellulose content with the increase in pretreatment temperature, which might be the reason for the hydrophobic nature of torrefied biomass.

Journal of Experimental Botany, 62, (10), 3545 - 3561. Programme(s) : <b>Biorenewables</b> and Environmental Change (BEC) (SPG.

Here a detailed transcriptome analysis that allowed the identification of genes involved in grass cell wall biogenesis is provided. Differential gene expression profiling, using maize oligonucleotide arrays, was used to identify genes differentially expressed between an elongating internode, containing cells exhibiting primary cell wall synthesis, and an internode that had just ceased elongation and in which many cells were depositing secondary cell wall material. This is one of only a few studies specifically aimed at the identification of cell wall-related genes in grasses. Analysis identified new candidate genes for a role in primary and secondary cell wall biogenesis in grasses. The results suggest that many proteins involved in cell wall processes during normal development are also recruited during defence-related cell wall remodelling events. This work provides a platform for studies in which candidate genes will be functionally tested for involvement in cell wall-related processes, increasing our knowledge of cell wall biogenesis and its regulation in grasses. Since several grasses are currently being developed as lignocellulosic feedstocks for biofuel production, this improved understanding of grass cell wall biogenesis is timely, as it will facilitate the manipulation of traits favourable for sustainable food and biofuel production.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{search for}} {{promising}} and renewable sources of carbohydrates {{for the production}} of biofuels and other <b>biorenewables</b> has been stimulated by an increase in global energy demand in the face of growing concern over greenhouse gas emissions and fuel security. In particular, interest has focused on non-food lignocellulosic biomass as a potential source of abundant and sustainable feedstock for biorefineries. Here we investigate the potential of three Brazilian grasses (Panicum maximum, Pennisetum purpureum and Brachiaria brizantha), as well as bark residues from the harvesting of two commercial Eucalyptus clones (E. grandis and E. grandis x urophylla) for biofuel production, and compare these to sugarcane bagasse. The effects of hot water, acid, alkaline and sulfite pretreatments (at increasing temperatures) on the chemical composition, morphology and saccharification yields of these different biomass types were evaluated. Results The average yield (per hectare), availability and general composition of all five biomasses were compared. Compositional analyses indicate a high level of hemicellulose and lignin removal in all grass varieties (including sugarcane bagasse) after acid and alkaline pretreatment with increasing temperatures, whilst the biomasses pretreated with hot water or sulfite showed little variation from the control. For all biomasses, higher cellulose enrichment resulted from treatment with sodium hydroxide at 130 °C. At 180 °C, a decrease in cellulose content was observed, which is associated with high amorphous cellulose removal and 5 -hydroxymethyl-furaldehyde production. Morphological analysis showed the effects of different pretreatments on the biomass surface, revealing a high production of microfibrillated cellulose on grass surfaces, after treatment with 1 % sodium hydroxide at 130 °C for 30 minutes. This may explain the higher hydrolysis yields resulting from these pretreatments, since these cellulosic nanoparticles can be easily accessed and cleaved by cellulases. Conclusion Our results show the potential of three Brazilian grasses with high productivity yields as valuable sources of carbohydrates for ethanol production and other biomaterials. Sodium hydroxide at 130 °C was found to be the most effective pretreatment for enhanced saccharification yields. It was also efficient in the production of microfibrillated cellulose on grass surfaces, thereby revealing their potential as a source of natural fillers used for bionanocomposites production...|$|R

Growth year and the interaction between taxonomic group and growth year had smaller significant effects. Strong correlations were found between ADL and cellulose (R = 0. 72), and hemicellulose (R = ? 0. 76) in the M. x giganteus samples but correlations were weaker for M. sacchariflorus (R = 0. 66 and ? 0. 59) and M. sinensis (R = 0. 46 and ? 0. 40). Eleven genotypes had been assessed previously in the U. K. during the European Miscanthus Improvement (EMI) programme.

40|$|As {{fossil fuels}} are depleted, {{there is a}} growing focus on {{renewable}} chemicals based on biomass materials, including both fuels and chemical feedstocks. Current methods for biomass utilization include biological conversion to produce ethanol and various thermochemical routes (gasification, pyrolysis, liquefaction, hydrothermal treatment, etc.). Furfural is one particular chemical that can be obtained from lignocellulosic biomass in good yields through the dehydration of sugar residues. It {{can be used as a}} feedstock for chemicals such as furan and THF, or as a platform molecule for making liquid fuels. The objective of this research is to investigate new pathways for the utilization of furfural in value-added products. In addition, heterogeneous oxorhenium catalysts were studied for deoxydehydration of vicinal diols, a reaction relevant to the conversion of biomass derived sugars. A cationic oxorhenium(V) oxazoline was studied for the catalytic condensation of diols or epoxides with aldehydes. Here, reactions were done under neat conditions and mild temperatures, achieving good to excellent yields of the 1, 3 -dioxolane products. The reaction conditions were then applied to the <b>biorenewables</b> furfural and glycerol, providing the first reported solvent-free condensation of these materials. Investigation into the stereoselectivity of the reaction reveals divergent pathways for the reaction of epoxides versus the analogous diol. The coupling of furfural with glycerol is further investigated. Neat conditions are developed to provide the cyclic acetal products, using simple Lewis acid salts and heterogeneous acid catalysts. Since the reaction is performed under neat conditions, novel reaction methods are studied in order to remove the water byproduct and drive the reaction forward. We found these reaction conditions to be applicable to crude glycerol. The resultant acetals were isolated and modified via hydrogenation and acetylation. These materials were then studied as blending agents with biodiesel, aiming to improve the low temperature properties. While no benefit was observed, the data does not preclude the use of these materials as additives in biodiesel. The homocoupling of furfural is then studied using the N-heterocyclic carbene catalyzed benzoin condensation. Here, green methods are focused on with the ultimate goal of realizing the two-step process of producing furfural and subsequently performing the homocoupling. The C 10 product, furoin, serves as a good platform for the production of alkane fuels, and several processes are investigated to reach this goal. Finally, the deoxydehydration of vicinal diols using oxorhenium catalysts is known using several methods with various reductants. A number of known heterogenous oxorhenium catalysts have been described and studied for oxidation type reactions. We prepared several of these catalysts and studied them for the known diol reduction reactions. However, good results were not obtained, with the rhenium either being inactive or exhibiting significant leaching from the support, hence limiting the recyclability of the catalyst material. ...|$|R

The foundation course is a three-credit course introducing students to basic concepts in <b>biorenewable</b> resources and technology. The seminar course provides students with an opportunity to hear from nationally and internationally recognized leaders in the field. The laboratory requirement is a 1 -credit laboratory course or a special topics laboratory/research experience (BRT 591 L). As part of student recruitment, quarter-time assistantships from DOE funds were offered to supplement assistantships provided by faculty to students. Research was built around platform teams in an effort to encourage interdisciplinary research and collaborative student learning in <b>biorenewable</b> resources. A platform is defined as the convergence of enabling technologies into a highly integrated system for transforming a specific feedstock into desired products. The platform teams parallel the way industry conducts research and product development. Platform teams organize faculty and students for cross-disciplinary, systems-oriented research and collaborative learning. To date, nine platforms have been developed, although these will most likely be reorganized into a smaller number of broader topics. In the spring of 2004, BRT faculty initiated a regional partnership and collaborative learning program with colleagues at the University of Minnesota, Kansas State University, and South Dakota State University to develop distance education courses in <b>biorenewable</b> resources and technology. As a fledgling graduate program, the BRT graduate program didn’t have the breadth of resources to offer a large number of courses in biorenewables. Other schools faced a similar problem. The academic consortium as first conceived would allow students from the member schools to enroll in biorenewables courses from any of the participating schools, which would assure the necessary enrollment numbers to offer specialized course work. Since its inception, the collaborative curriculum partnership has expanded to include Louisiana State University and the University of Wisconsin. A second international curriculum development campaign was also initiated in the spring of 2004. In particular, several BRT faculty teamed with colleagues at the University of Arkansas, University of Washington, University of Gent (Belgium), National Polytechnic Institute of Toulouse (France), and Technical University of Graz (Austria) to develop an EU-US exchange program in higher education and vocational education/training (entitled “Renewable Resources and Clean Technology”) ...|$|E
40|$|With growing {{concerns}} for the environment, dwindling amounts of fossil fuels available for worldwide consumption and more resistant strains of diseases and infections becoming a reality, organic chemistry plays {{a vital role in}} the improvement and sustainability of modern society. Industrial chemicals from renewable sources has become an important area of research in recent years, while the synthesis and study of biologically active small molecules and their analogues leads to advancements which can help improve overall human health. In this dissertation, we explore methods to create important industrial molecules from <b>biorenewable</b> sources, extend a novel cyclization to make heterocyclic compounds, and develop a new route towards a natural product that is active against tumor cells which resist current cancer treatments. Chapter 1 discusses the synthesis of an important industrial compound, terephthalic acid, from malic acid, which can be obtained from <b>biorenewable</b> feedstocks. This work was performed in collaboration with chemical engineers at the Center for <b>Biorenewable</b> Chemicals. Chapter 2 describes the extension of the Kraus indole synthesis to biologically important natural products such as isocryptolepine and the indolo[2, 1 -a]isoquinoline series. Chapter 3 discusses advances made towards the total synthesis of a marine alkaloid, oroidin, including a novel cyclization to install the important 2 -aminoimidazole portion of the molecule...|$|E
