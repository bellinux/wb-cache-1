40|$|Simulation is a {{critical}} step {{in the development of}} state of the art microprocessors. Accurate simulation allows designers to confidently investigate various designs, while fast simulation times allow designers to thoroughly explore a design space. RITSim is an endeavor to create a high accuracy, high quality microarchitecture simulation infrastructure. This simulation infrastructure will be available for academic research in low power and high performance computer systems. The scope of this work is to provide a Linux OS Emulator, a <b>Binary</b> Application <b>Loader,</b> and a Linux kernel running in a virtual environment for the RITSim project. In order to evaluate standard software loads and benchmark suites on target microarchitectures simulators must provide support for operating system calls. This may be accomplished with various levels of accuracy. Many past simulators chose to sacrifice simulation accuracy to improve simulation time, while others sacrificed portability and execution time for high accuracy results. This work provides three key elements to the RITSim environment in an effort to create a simulation environment that seamlessly combines both approaches to provide a single integrated tool that allows researchers to choose the approach that is best suited to their needs. A first order simulation mode is provided that makes use of emulated system calls that are executed on the host computer?s operating system to provide quick simulation times. This mode also maintains a high level of portability since the host operating system is used to access the hardware. A high accuracy mode is also available that runs in a highly detailed simulated operating system. When running in the high accuracy mode the simulated operating system must be loaded into a virtual environment allowing the actual instructions of the operating system code to be simulated. Another key element is the <b>binary</b> application <b>loader.</b> This is required by the simulator to load executables into the simulator?s virtual memory space and to prepare it for execution. This involves not only mapping or copying the executable into simulated virtual memory, but also the creation and initialization of a new user mode stack and configuration of the simulated processor?s user mode registers...|$|R
5000|$|The New World ROM {{introduced}} a much-improved {{version of the}} Open Firmware interpreter, version 3.0, which added many missing features, fixed most of the bugs from earlier versions, and had the capability to run CHRP boot scripts. The Toolbox ROM was embedded inside a CHRP script in the System Folder called [...] "Mac OS ROM", along with a short loader stub {{and a copy of}} the Happy Mac icon suitable for display from Open Firmware. Once the ROM was loaded from disk, the Mac boot sequence continued as usual. As before, Open Firmware could also run a <b>binary</b> boot <b>loader,</b> and version 3.0 added support for ELF objects as well as the XCOFF files versions 1.0.5 and 2.0 supported. Also, version 3.0 (as {{well as some of the}} last releases of version 2.x, starting with the PowerBook 3400) officially supported direct access to the Open Firmware command prompt from the console (by setting the auto-boot? variable to false from Mac OS, or by holding down Command-Option-O-F at boot).|$|R
40|$|This {{is first}} {{official}} release of Mandelbulber program with OpenCL rendering engines which uses graphics card computation capabilities. Most of rendering features available in CPU rendering engine are implemented in OpenCL code. However {{there is still}} list of features which still only work on CPU (will be implemented in next versions) : only material # 1 is used texture mapping (including background) primitive objects HDR blur stereoscopic images NetRender boolean operators support for multiple GPUs voxel / mesh export anti-aliasing limited calculation accuracy to single precision (CPU use double) To enable OpenCL in Mandelbulber you need to open Preferences dialog and enable it on OpenCL tab. In this window you can select graphics card which {{you want to use}} for computation.
