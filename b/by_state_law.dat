5|$|The Fourth Amendment {{prevents}} most warrantless searches by {{law enforcement}} officers, and since Weeks v.

Evidence gathered <b>by</b> <b>state</b> <b>law</b> enforcement was therefore not yet bound by the same strictures as that gathered by federal law enforcement.|$|E

Cotters Pond, <b>by</b> <b>state</b> <b>law,</b> is a water body that cannot be used for baitfishing. This was designated by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation. Shortly afterward, NY74 passes Bumbo Pond and enters the hamlet of Paradox. After leaving Paradox, NY74 turns to the southeast along the base of Skiff Mountain. The highway then approaches a creek that flows into Eagle Lake. NY74 crosses over Eagle Lake and runs along the base of Eagle Cliff and the shores of the lake. After leaving Eagle Lake, the highway intersects with County Route2 (CR2), the first numbered highway that NY74 encounters after US9.|$|E
5|$|Michigan, one of {{the fifty}} United States, is home to two types of lizards, {{nineteen}} types of snakes and eleven types of turtles, {{all members of the}} class Reptilia. Reptiles are found throughout Michigan, although the only venomous species, the eastern massasauga rattlesnake, is seen only in the Lower Peninsula. Reptiles are cold-blooded, and so usually pass the cold winters of Michigan in frost-free areas, such as underground burrows (for snakes and land-dwelling turtles) or the bottoms of lakes and streams (for water-dwelling turtles). Most reptiles in Michigan are protected <b>by</b> <b>state</b> <b>law,</b> but many are still at risk due to human encroachment on their habitats, the draining of wetlands and, in the case of snakes, indiscriminate killing by fearful humans. In 1995, the painted turtle was named as Michigan's state reptile.|$|E

5|$|In January 2016, Bevin's {{administration}} sent a {{cease and desist}} {{letter to}} Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky ordering it to stop performing abortions at its clinic in Louisville {{because it did not}} have the required license. The clinic claimed it had been given permission to perform the procedures by Beshear's inspector general just prior to Bevin taking office, but nonetheless halted the procedures on January 28. Bevin filed suit against Planned Parenthood in February, claiming it had illegally performed 23 abortions without a license; the suit said Planned Parenthood's licensure application was deficient because it did not include agreements with a hospital and ambulance service to transport and care for patients in case of complications, as required <b>by</b> <b>state</b> <b>law,</b> and that Beshear's inspector general was wrong in instructing the organization to begin performing abortions before the license was approved. Planned Parenthood countered that, before the license could be finalized, the abortion facility would have to be subjected to an unannounced inspection, requiring that abortions were already being performed there. In March, the University of Louisville Hospital announced that it had backed out of a transfer agreement with Planned Parenthood, saying it had been pressured to do so and felt that its state funding was in jeopardy by continuing in the agreement. A spokesman for Bevin denied that the pressure had come from anyone in the administration.|$|E
