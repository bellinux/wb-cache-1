5|$|Echmarcach {{may well}} have {{controlled}} Mann throughout his second reign in Dublin. Silver hoards uncovered on Mann, dated by their coins to the years 1030s1050s, {{may well be the}} by-product of the intense conflict over control of the island. There is evidence indicating that, {{at some point in the}} early eleventh centuryperhaps in the 1020s1030sa mint may have developed and functioned on Mann. Coins that appear to have been minted on the island roughly coincide with Echmarcach's rule. These coins are very similar to those produced in Dublin, and may <b>be</b> <b>evidence</b> that Echmarcach attempted to harmonise the coinage utilised within his realm. The production of coins on Mann appears to <b>be</b> <b>evidence</b> of a sophisticated economy in the Isles. In fact, the wealth and sophistication of commerce in Echmarcach's realm could in part explain why the constant struggle for control of Dublin and the Isles was so bitter, and could account for Þórfinnr's apparent presence in the region.|$|E

40|$|How <b>are</b> {{reasons and}} <b>evidence</b> interrelated? According to one {{prevalent}} view, reasons and <b>evidence</b> <b>are</b> equivalent: <b>evidence</b> <b>is</b> a reason, and a reason <b>is</b> <b>evidence.</b> On another view reasons and <b>evidence</b> <b>are</b> conditionally related: if there <b>is</b> <b>evidence,</b> then there <b>is</b> a reason. On {{a different view}} reasons and <b>evidence</b> <b>are</b> disjunctively related: reasons or <b>evidence</b> can <b>be</b> substituted for each other. In this paper, I argue against these common views, and I defend the view that reasons and <b>evidence</b> <b>are</b> conjunctively related: <b>evidence</b> and reasons <b>are</b> distinguishable yet inseparable. I argue reasons and <b>evidence</b> <b>are</b> distinct because they come apart in certain cases, and I argue reasons and <b>evidence</b> <b>are</b> inseparable because only when properly conjoined are they capable of yielding correct verdicts on important cases in epistemology...|$|R

5|$|A reanalysis of the Book of Clanranald {{has shown}} that, instead of 1207, this source may {{actually}} date Ragnall's demise to 1227. However, this date {{may well be}} too late for man who was an adult by 1164. Ragnall's grant to Paisley may leave clues to his fate. The similarity between this charter and another granted to the priory by his son, Domnall, may <b>be</b> <b>evidence</b> that the documents were drawn up at about the same time. If so, Ragnall's charter may <b>be</b> <b>evidence</b> that he survived his defeat at the hands of Áengus, and the two charters may indicate that Ragnall was nearing the end of his life. Ragnall's grant may also indicate that he entered into a confraternity with the monks at Paisley. If the charter was indeed granted {{near the end of his}} life, it is also possible that Ragnall ended his days there. Since the priory was one of the religious houses founded by the meic Somairle, his possible retirement there may partly explain why Ragnall disappears from record after 1192.|$|E
5|$|According to the thirteenth-century Historia Gruffud vab Kenan, {{the mother}} of Cynan's son was Ragnailt ingen Amlaíb, a {{paternal}} granddaughter of Sitriuc. Further revealed by this source {{is the fact that}} this woman's father, Amlaíb mac Sitriuc, built and commanded a Welsh fortress called Castell Avloed. Although it is unknown how long the Dubliners possessed the fortress, in 1036 another son of Sitriuc was slain in Wales by an apparent kinsman, an event which could <b>be</b> <b>evidence</b> of a struggle for control of the site. Echmarcach's aforesaid expulsion of Sitriuc from Dublin in the same year could in turn indicate that this exiled monarch sought refuge in Wales.|$|E

5|$|Also in 941, the seventeenth-century Annals of the Four Masters {{reports that}} a {{chieftain}} named Áed Albanach was slain amongst a vast host of Dublin Vikings by the invading forces of Amargein mac Cináeda, overking of Uí Failge. The fact that Áed bore a Gaelic personal name, died with the Dubliners, and bore an epithet referring to a Scotsman, could <b>be</b> <b>evidence</b> {{that he was a}} successor of Gebeachan. Further evidence of this may be the record of Mór, a woman attested by the twelfth-century pseudo-historical Caithréim Chellacháin Chaisil, which identifies her as a daughter of a certain Áed mac Echach, and describes her as the daughter of a King of the Hebrides.|$|E
5|$|Although the Chronicle of Man {{maintains}} that Lǫgmaðr voluntarily vacated his throne, {{there is reason}} to suspect that he was forced from power. In about 1096, the chronicle claims that the leading Islesmen sought assistance of Muirchertach Ua Briain, King of Munster (died 1119), and petitioned him to provide a regent from his own kin to govern the kingdom until Lǫgmaðr's younger brother, Óláfr (died 1153), was old enough to assume control. The chronicle's account could <b>be</b> <b>evidence</b> that, by about 1096, Lǫgmaðr faced a faction formed around his younger brother; and that, when this faction was unable to topple Lǫgmaðr by itself, it approached Ua Briain for assistance in placing Óláfr upon the throne.|$|E
