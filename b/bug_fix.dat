25|$|Hello Games has {{remained}} committed to improving and expanding the game. Since its release, No Man's Sky has received multiple major content updates that have introduced numerous previously missing features along with new ones, {{as well as}} several minor game improvement and <b>bug</b> <b>fix</b> patches. Following the updates, reception of the game by the public has generally improved.|$|E
25|$|The Nintendo fixed-point {{digital signal}} {{processor}} (DSP) chip allowed for fast vector-based calculations, bitmap conversions, both 2D and 3D coordinate transformations, and other functions. Four revisions of the chip exist, each physically identical but with different microcode. The DSP-1 version, including the later 1A and 1B <b>bug</b> <b>fix</b> revisions, is used most often; the DSP-2, DSP-3, and DSP-4 are used in only one title each.|$|E

25|$|The actual {{release of}} Internet Explorer 5 {{happened}} in three stages. First, a Developer Preview {{was released in}} June 1998 (5.0B1), and then a Public Preview was released in November 1998 (5.0B2). Then in March 1999 the final release was released (5.0). In September it was released with Windows 98 Second Edition. Version 5.01, a <b>bug</b> <b>fix</b> version, was released in December 1999. Windows 2000 includes this version. Version 5.0 {{was the last one}} to be released for Windows 3.1x or Windows NT 3.x. Internet Explorer 5 Macintosh Edition had been released a few months earlier on March 27, 2000, and was the last version of Internet Explorer to be released on a non-Windows platform. Version 5.5 for Windows was released in July 2000, bundled with Windows ME and 128-bit encryption but had no support for several older Windows versions.|$|E
500|$|Development of Mysteries of Westgate {{ended in}} September 2007, but Atari delayed the pack's release, because the digital rights {{management}} they wanted to use was not ready. The delay was also caused by coordination problems between Ossian, Obsidian, and Atari. The game was officially announced on October 22, 2007, with an estimated release date of [...] "fall 2007". In May 2008, IGN reported that the game was scheduled for release that June, but it was further delayed, finally being released on April 29, 2009. Development of Mysteries of Westgate continued during the delays, to ensure the game's compatibility with the expansions and patches for Neverwinter Nights 2 that were released after the game's completion. Scull said, [...] "Kevin Smith, our Lead Technical Designer ... had to <b>bug</b> <b>fix</b> and create new builds of the game with each [...]" ...|$|E

30|$|An et al. (2014) {{analyzed}} {{the relationship between}} supplementary <b>bug</b> <b>fixes</b> and <b>bug</b> reopening on WebKit and projects from Eclipse Foundation and Mozilla Foundation, partially replicating the studies by Park et al. (2012) and by Shihab et al. (2010). They found that between 21 % and 34 % of all <b>bugs</b> with supplementary <b>fixes</b> were eventually reopened, and that {{only a little more}} than 50 % of all reopened bugs are associated with supplementary <b>bug</b> <b>fixes.</b> They conclude that bug reopening is not always related to incorrect <b>bug</b> <b>fixes.</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Fixing bugs is an {{important}} activity of the soft-ware development process. A typical process of <b>bug</b> <b>fixing</b> consists of the following steps: 1) a user files a bug report; 2) the bug is assigned to a developer; 3) the developer fixes the bug; 4) changed code is reviewed and verified; and 5) the bug is resolved. Many studies have investigated the process of <b>bug</b> <b>fixing.</b> However, {{to the best of}} our knowledge, none has explicitly analyzed the interval between bug assignment and the time when <b>bug</b> <b>fixing</b> starts. After a bug assignment, some developers will immediately start <b>fixing</b> the <b>bug</b> while others will start <b>bug</b> <b>fixing</b> after a long period. We are blind on developer’s delays when <b>fixing</b> <b>bugs.</b> This paper explores such delays of developers through an empirical study on three open source software systems. We examine factors affecting <b>bug</b> <b>fixing</b> time along three dimensions: bug reports, source code involved in the fix, and code changes that are required to <b>fix</b> the <b>bug.</b> We further compare different factors by descriptive logistic regression models. Our results can help development teams better understand factors behind delays, and then improve <b>bug</b> <b>fixing</b> process.
