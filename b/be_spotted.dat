5|$|Camouflage is an {{important}} defense strategy enabled by changes in body shape, colour and markings. Some lepidopterans blend with the surroundings, making them difficult to <b>be</b> <b>spotted</b> by predators. Caterpillars can be shades of green that match their host plant. Others resemble inedible objects, such as twigs or leaves. The larvae of some species, such as the common Mormon and the western tiger swallowtail look like bird droppings.|$|E
5|$|Several {{wild boars}} (Sus scrofa) are {{native to the}} park. They are often found near the beaches where they feed on scraps and trash dropped by visitors. Further within the forests of the peninsula, other mammals can <b>be</b> <b>spotted,</b> such as golden jackals (Canis aureus), Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx), and even several striped hyenas (Hyaena hyaena) and caracals (Caracal caracal), among many others usually not native to such areas.|$|E
50|$|Large cats have <b>been</b> <b>spotted</b> {{near the}} river but as always these animals are elusive. A black panther <b>was</b> <b>spotted</b> {{approximately}} 2 km from the river in 1986. Jaguars have <b>been</b> <b>spotted</b> near the Haucas River Gorge.|$|R

5|$|The 2009 {{wildlife}} {{survey conducted}} by Government of Tamil Nadu enumerated 10 Bengal tigers, 866 Indian elephants, 672 gaurs, and 27 leopards. The survey party observed four additional species of horned antelope including 2,348 spotted deer, 1,068 blackbucks, 304 sambar deer, 77 barking deer and four-horned antelopes, 843 wild boars, 43 sloth bears and 15 striped hyenas. Herds of the famous feral buffaloes can also <b>be</b> <b>spotted</b> in places near the Moyar river.|$|E
5|$|The {{plan was}} for Major-General Hunter and a flying column of crack troops to race with all {{possible}} speed from Merowe north-east to Abu Hamed, {{where they would}} surprise the numerically inferior Mahdist garrison and win control of the town. Speed was essential, for it was certain Hunter's column would <b>be</b> <b>spotted</b> by Mahdist scouts during the journey. If these scouts managed to send word and reinforce the town prior to Hunter's arrival, his column might find itself outmatched and forced to retreat.|$|E
5|$|Aside from that, Damai is {{also one}} of the perfect places in Sarawak to see the Irrawaddy dolphin as the mammals can <b>be</b> <b>spotted</b> along the Salak River, Santubong estuary and at the Bako-Buntal Bay. The Santubong Peninsula offers a few sites for bird {{watching}} with the BirdLife International Organisation has registered the whole area on Bako-Buntal Bay as an 'Important Bird Area'. Between October and March, the Buntal River become an important wintering ground for bird migration. A number of birds that have been spotted by the Malaysian Nature Society (Kuching Branch) at Buntal including a variety of plovers, sandpipers, egrets, terns and other rare migrants, while resident birds including collared kingfisher, the white-bellied sea eagle and brahminy kite.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in October of each year, Pleione {{along with}} the rest of the cluster can be seen rising in the east in the early morning before dawn. To see it after sunset, one will need to wait until December. By mid-February, the star is visible to {{virtually}} every inhabited region of the globe, with only those south of 66° unable to see it. Even in cities like Cape Town, South Africa, at the tip of the African continent, the star rises almost 32° above the horizon. Due to its declination of roughly +24°, Pleione is circumpolar in the northern hemisphere at latitudes greater than 66° North. Once late April arrives, the cluster can <b>be</b> <b>spotted</b> briefly in the deepening twilight of the western horizon, soon to disappear with the other setting stars.|$|E
5|$|James was not {{a perfect}} {{stand-in}} for Montgomery. He had lost a finger during the First World War, so a prosthetic had to be made. He had also never flown before, so the London Controlling Section's Dennis Wheatley took James up for a test flight {{to make sure he}} did not suffer from air sickness. Finally, James both drank heavily and smoked cigars, while Montgomery was a teetotaler and disliked smoking. The deception planners were worried that James might <b>be</b> <b>spotted</b> drinking, spoiling the performance. Despite these hitches, and with Montgomery's approval, the plan went forward. To get into character, James spent some time with the general, posing as a journalist, to study his mannerisms.|$|E
5|$|Many {{species of}} fish, shellfish, and {{crustaceans}} frequent both the local rivers and sea, notably crayfish and paua. Nugget Point {{in the northern}} Catlins hosts a particularly rich variety of marine wildlife. The establishment of a marine reserve off the coast here, discussed in 1992, 2004 and 2015, has been controversial. Hector's dolphins can often be seen close to the Catlins coast, especially at Porpoise Bay near Waikawa, which is protected {{as part of the}} Catlins Coast Marine Mammal Sanctuary, established in 2008. Migratory southern right whales and humpback whales can <b>be</b> <b>spotted</b> along the coastline during winter.|$|E

5|$|Other than feral {{dogs and}} {{domestic}} cattle, {{the most frequently}} encountered non-human mammal is the hanuman, a long tailed grey langur prevalent in the Gangetic plain. Some wild boars and wolves may still <b>be</b> <b>spotted</b> in the small forests of Chinpai, Bandarsol and Charicha. Leopards and bears {{are not to be}} seen any more in the wild. Sometimes during the season when mahua trees bloom, wild Asiatic elephants from Jharkhand come in trampling crops and threatening life and property. Birds of Birbhum include a mix of hilly and plain-land dwelling species like partridge, pigeon, green pigeon, water fowls, doyel, Indian robin, drongo, hawk, cuckoo, koel, sunbird, Indian roller, parrot, babbler, and some migratory birds.|$|E
5|$|Route {{branding}} {{has been}} increasingly used by Lothian since {{the introduction of}} low floor vehicles. Route branding highlights the route of certain services making the buses easier to <b>be</b> <b>spotted</b> throughout Lothian. Since May 2010 the Harlequin livery used to identify low floor buses has started to be phased out, as the company is now a full low floor operation, with {{a return to the}} traditional madder and white livery although the style has been altered slightly to suit the lines of modern buses. Each type of bus owned directly by Lothian Buses has had at least one of their type painted in the new livery.|$|E
5|$|Since European Settlement {{the native}} plant {{life has been}} {{considerably}} affected, with the native manna gum and blue gum woodlands being largely cleared for agricultural uses. The large amount of non-native vegetation in the gully is predominantly {{the result of the}} early agriculture, although some species were introduced by accident. Introduced species include olive trees, hawthorn, fennel and blackberry. With the reduction of native flora, exotic fauna have flourished around the Waterfall Gully region. These include rabbits, blackbirds and starlings. However, not all of the native wildlife has been lost—bats (in particular, Gould's wattled bat), {{can be found in the}} area, as can superb fairy-wrens and Adelaide rosellas, and a large number of unique Australian animals such as kangaroos, koalas and possums can <b>be</b> <b>spotted</b> on some of the walking trails.|$|E

5|$|Steins;Gate {{is set in}} {{the summer}} of 2010, {{approximately}} one year after the events that took place in Chaos;Head, in Akihabara. Physical locales of Akihabara like the Radio Kaikan building can <b>be</b> <b>spotted</b> in the game. According to Chiyomaru Shikura, who headed the planning of Steins;Gate, Akihabara was chosen because it is an easy place for acquiring hardware parts, which makes it the ideal place for people interested in inventing and tinkering with things. The notion of time and time traveling are the main themes of the game. The concept of cause and effect is featured prominently in the game as the protagonist travels back in time numerous times to perform different actions in an attempt to alter {{what has happened in the}} future.|$|E
5|$|The {{headland}} at Braich y Pwll is {{the only}} known location on the British mainland of the spotted rock rose, which produces bright yellow petals that last only one day. The coast here has open grass heath land and mountain, giving way to rugged sea cliffs and coves. There is a profusion of wildlife, {{and it is an}} ideal vantage point to watch the spring and autumn bird migrations. Choughs, peregrine falcons, kestrels, puffins, stonechats, guillemots and Manx shearwaters can be seen, and dolphins, porpoises and seals can <b>be</b> <b>spotted</b> in the water.|$|E
5|$|Tides cause {{seawater}} {{to enter}} {{the mouth of the}} St. Johns River and can affect the river's level into the middle basin. As a result, much of the river in Jacksonville is part seawater, making it an estuarine ecosystem. The animals and plants in these systems can tolerate both fresh and salt water, and the fluctuations in saline content and temperatures associated with tidal surges and heavy rainfall discharge. Marine animals such as dolphins and sharks can <b>be</b> <b>spotted</b> at times in the St. Johns at Jacksonville as can manatees. Fish such as mullet (Mullidae), flounder (Paralichthys lethostigma), shad (Alosa sapidissima), and blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus) migrate from the ocean to freshwater springs upriver to spawn.|$|E

5|$|The first Wellington N2960 {{took off}} from RAF Mildenhall in Suffolk at 09:27 with Wing Commander Richard Kellett at the controls. No. 9 Squadron {{took off from}} the nearby RAF Honington and formed up over King's Lynn and started out over the North Sea. Feltwell's No. 37 Squadron took off but missed the {{rendezvous}} and {{caught up with the}} main formation an hour later over the North Sea. Once over the Wash they set a course of 040° true, as far as latitude 55°north. The plan was to avoid heavy anti-aircraft artillery concentrations on the Frisian Islands. However, as they left England the cloud broke and they found themselves without cover in a bright crystal clear sky. Two bombers, N2984 and N2894, piloted by Duguid and Kelly turned back; the first due to engine trouble, the other escorting the troubled bomber back to base. The remaining bombers flew north past the Frisian Islands then turned due south, continuing their mission in perfect visibility which made it easy to <b>be</b> <b>spotted</b> by German aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Attacks by the Banff Wing quickly forced German ships {{travelling}} {{along the}} Norwegian coast to sail {{at night and}} take shelter in deep fjords during the day where they were very difficult to attack. In order to locate German ships the two wings sent out aircraft on almost daily patrols along the Norwegian coastline from the Skagerrak to Trondheim. During this period the Allied squadrons developed a tactic of sending two 'outriders' ahead of {{the main body of}} the patrol; these aircraft were manned by experienced aircrew and penetrated into fjords in search of shipping which might not <b>be</b> <b>spotted</b> by the other aircraft. By December 1944 patrols were also routinely escorted by RAF Mustang Mk III fighters and accompanied by Vickers Warwick air-sea rescue aircraft. Only a single squadron of Mustangs was available, however, as these long-ranged fighters were needed to escort daylight raids by heavy bombers against Germany. German fighters began to be encountered off the Norwegian coast in December, and from the end of the month onwards it was common for Allied wing-sized operations near Norway to be attacked by groups of up to 30 fighters. In March 1945 the Luftwaffe had 85 single-engined and about 45 twin-engined aircraft operating from ten or twelve airfields south of Trondheim.|$|E
5|$|Saint Charles Bay {{serves as}} a habitat for {{approximately}} 300 species of birds. Birders venture to the site between November and March, when the creatures winter near the bay. The endangered whooping crane, the largest bird in North America, is the most highly prized sight as {{only a few hundred}} remain, including three families on St. Charles Bay. The bird was near extinction in the early 20th century, as only two flocks between Canada and Texas remained. The population increased following the organization of the Aransas Migratory Waterfowl Refuge in 1937, after the Federal government purchased the land of the St. Charles ranch from San Antonio oilman Leroy G. Denman, using funds from commemorative stamps. The Refuge later became known as the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge. Whooping cranes are also protected by Goose Island State Park, which was established by the State of Texas in 1931. Other birds that migrate to the bay include the sandhill crane, American white pelican, brown pelican, roseate spoonbill, great blue heron and Canada goose. The blue crab and other shellfish, help sustain the bird population. Thirty seven species of mammals are found on Blackjack peninsula, including white-tailed deer, nine-banded armadillos and collared peccaries. The spotted seatrout and redfish are the common finfish that reside in the bay. While trout are generally found in the bay's deeper waters, redfish live in shallow waters; their tail fins can <b>be</b> <b>spotted</b> above the surface during the peak summer and fall months. The bay also supports a healthy population of American alligators, which reside in shallow waters. Signs alert visitors to be careful.|$|E
