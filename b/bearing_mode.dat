40|$|Abstract: In this paper, {{we address}} the problem of {{controlling}} an active magnetic bearing with reduced ohmic power losses. A solution is proposed which introduces an exponentially decaying bias ßux in the nonlinear control law. To avoid control singularities, the closed-loop system is exponentially stabilized at a faster rate than the bias decay. In the steady state, the proposed controller has zero bias ßux; hence, there are no ohmic power losses. The control scheme is applied to two different <b>bearing</b> <b>modes</b> of operation – all electromagnets active at all times and only one opposing electromagnet active at any given time. A rigorous analysis of the latter mode of operation is presented along with an implementation strategy.

Failures involving extensive bearing damage were found to dissipate significantly more energy than tension dominated failures.

Compared to the published test results of bolted connections failing in the net section fracture, those involving the <b>bearing</b> failure <b>mode</b> had very wide scatter in the ultimate test loads of specimens having seemingly similar configurations. This technical note presents the laboratory test results of 51 specimens composed of G 2 and G 450 steel sheets, which have very different ductility properties. One new and significant finding is that the absolute bearing capacity can be considerably higher in the rolling direction of the cold-reduced steel sheet than in the perpendicular direction, even though the tensile strength has the opposite trend. Another result is that material ductility has a much greater effect on the bearing capacity than on the net section tension capacity. It was also found that snug tightening {{had little effect on}} the bearing capacity of specimens thicker than 1. 5 mm.

40|$|In {{building}} renovation, {{the real}} behaviour of reinforced concrete slabs cannot always {{be explained by}} the bending theory according to classical structural mechanics. Indeed, the bearing capacity, as assessed for instance by a loading test, sometimes appears to be much higher than what would be expected. This phenomenon may be caused by the activation of an arch-effect or so-called compressive membrane action (CMA) which can develop even with small vertical deformations. For a slab which is completely restrained, the presence of reinforcement becomes of lesser importance when this phenomenon is activated (except for end fields). Hence, for fire resistance purposes, it can be discussed whether reinforcement and concrete cover has a smaller influence on the bearing capacity for slabs subjected to fire which exhibit a significant concrete compressive membrane behaviour. This paper presents a loading test performed on a real concrete building which highlighted the development of CMA as the load <b>bearing</b> <b>mode.</b> It then proposes a strategy to evaluate the behaviour resulting from the development of CMA in reinforced concrete slabs at ambient and at elevated temperature based on numerical modelling.

Previous {{research has shown that}} the absence of washers can significantly lower the bearing resistance of these connections. Experimental studies have also revealed that the bearing capacity can be formulated with a gradated bearing coefficient that is governed by the ratio of fastener diameter to sheet thickness. A gradated bearing coefficient method, which was based on an investigation of bolted connections composed of mild steel as well as thin high strength steel, has recently been proposed to cold-formed steel design code committees in North America, Australia and New Zealand. However, the new bearing method does not include provisions for the design of washerless bolted connections.

The flying height of the HDD spindle system is determined by using the static analysis of the FDBs. The stiffness and damping coefficients are calculated by using the dynamic analysis of the FDBs. The free vibration characteristics and shock response of the HDD spindle system are analyzed by using the finite element method and the mode superposition method. An experimental modal test is also performed to verify the accuracy of the proposed method. This research shows that the shaft diameter changes the rocking frequencies in wider range than the groove depth of FDBs and that the shock response of a HDD spindle system is affected by the groove depth of FDBs. It also shows that the stiffness coefficients of journal bearing affect the rocking frequencies because their magnitudes are within the range of the stiffness of the supporting structure and that the damping coefficients of thrust bearing affect the axial frequency because the stiffness of thrust bearing is much smaller than that of the supporting structure.

Conventional passive fireproofing materials include concrete covering, gypsum board and cementitious coatings which have a poor aesthetic. Intumescent fire-resistive coatings are a newer type of passive fireproofing coatings usually applied as thin film and they swell many times their original thickness forming an insulating char which acts as a barrier between the fire and the structural steel.

Cover-plate connections with circular or slotted holes are of common use in steel structures. The behavior of such connections is characterized by various failure modes. <b>Bearing</b> <b>mode</b> {{is one of the}} most complex due to the distribution of stresses and strain around the loaded holes. This paper deals with the characterization of the behavior of cover-plate bolted joints with slotted holes. Numerical simulations using the Cast 3 M FE package are performed in association with an original experimental method based on full-field measurements. The strain fields obtained with these methods (grid method and Digital Image Correlation (DIC)) give the possibility to observe the evolution of the local deformations in the loaded zones of the connections. These evolutions are compared to those given by the Finite Element model for each configuration at different loadings stages. Thus, the experimental results are used to validate the numerical model. The comparisons are based on the load-displacement curves, the failure modes and the local deformations in the zones around the bolts holes. Six different geometrical parameters of the holes and their positions are considered in the tests. The validated numerical model is used to evaluate the influences of the dimensions of the slotted hole. The results showed that the geometry has a significant influence on the failure mode of the connections such as net section and bearing. Both numerical and experimental results are compared to those given by the analytical approach of Eurocode 3 to evaluate the accuracy of the analytical prediction.

The fast development of TFC technology presents new challenges to head designers because of the complicated structure of a TFC head, the thermo-mechanical-coupling effects and tribology issues arising at nanometer read/write spacing. A steady-state TFC solver dedicated to obtaining the steady-state flying attitude of a TFC slider is developed in this thesis. This solver uses a finite volume based solver (CML static solver) to solve the generalized Reynolds equation and obtain the pressure and spacing fields in the air bearing and a commercial coupled-field solver (ANSYS) to obtain the stress and strain fields due to internal heating. An iterative procedure is adopted to consider the cooling effect of the air bearing on the heater-induced protrusion. Accuracy of the solver is verified by drive-level magnetic tests on several combinations of air bearing and heater designs. TFC sliders' performances under different ambient conditions are investigated based on the TFC solver. It is found that the thermal actuation efficiency of a TFC slider increases with altitude because of the weakened cooling and reduced air bearing stiffness at the transducer area at a higher altitude. In addition, a TFC slider maintains a more consistent read/write spacing at different humidity levels, compared with a non-TFC slider, because the thermal actuation is able to compensate part of the pressure loss caused by water condensation. A TFC slider's flying height in air-helium mixtures is {{shown to be a}} highly nonlinear function of the fraction of helium in the gas mixture due to the combined effects of the gas mean free path, viscosity and heat conductivity. These results provide general guidelines for heater and ABS designers to reduce a TFC slider's sensitivity to ambient conditions and improve HDD reliability. A touchdown numerical model for predicting TFC sliders' dynamics at touchdown and over-pushed conditions is developed and implemented based on the CML dynamic simulator. It extends the solution of the time-varying generalized Reynolds equation to near-contact and contact conditions using a statistical multi-asperity approach. Various interfacial forces are considered by use and further development of a sub-boundary lubrication model to capture important tribological effects occurring at touchdown. This model is able to predict a TFC slider's unstable dynamics at the beginning of touchdown, which has been discovered in many related experimental studies. The effects of different head-disk interface factors are investigated using this numerical model. It is found that the suspension is actively involved in the TFC slider's bouncing vibrations and has a significant influence on the excited second air bearing pitch mode. It is also shown that adhesion force serves as an essential factor in exciting the second air <b>bearing</b> <b>mode</b> whereas other interfacial forces only affect details of the slider's bouncing behaviors. By changing the interfacial properties, namely, the interface roughness and lubricant thickness, the variation of interfacial forces with spacing reduction differs, which leads to very different touchdown patterns. With a rougher interface profile the slider smoothly transfers from a flying stage to a sliding stage. With a smoother interface profile the slider experiences a flying-bouncing-sliding transition. With the smoothest interface the slider goes through a flying-bouncing-surfing-sliding transition. The touchdown behaviors predicted by the numerical simulator are correlated with experiments conducted on industry-provided head parts with the same ABS and suspension design. Similar touchdown stages and excited modes are also discovered in the experiments. Though experiments showed a slider spectrum with richer frequency components, the modes missed from the numerical simulations are recovered by conducting a harmonic analysis on a full HGA model with air bearing included. The different touchdown dynamic patterns predicted here result in significant differences in the successful touchdown detection, which is very important for realizing reliable read/write operations, and therefore this work provides guidelines for head disk interface (HDI) optimization. The general approach proposed here is also applicable to studies on the effects of other important HDI factors, such as air bearing geometric features, heater-induced protrusion profiles, and suspension design parameters, and on the slider's touchdown dynamics behaviors, which will assist in obtaining solutions to performance and reliability issues in current hard disk drives...|$|E

40|$|Fault {{diagnosis}} precision {{for rolling}} bearings under variable conditions {{has always been}} unsatisfactory. To solve this problem, a fault diagnosis method combining Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT), singular value decomposition (SVD), and Elman neural network is proposed in this paper. The method includes three steps. First, instantaneous amplitude matrices were obtained by using HHT from rolling bearing signals. Second, the singular value vector was acquired by applying SVD to the instantaneous amplitude matrices, thus reducing the dimension of the instantaneous amplitude matrix and obtaining the fault feature insensitive to working condition variation. Finally, an Elman neural network {{was applied to the}} rolling bearing fault diagnosis under variable working conditions according to the extracted feature vector. The experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively classify rolling <b>bearing</b> fault <b>modes</b> with high precision under different operating conditions. Moreover, the performance of the proposed HHT-SVD-Elman method has an advantage over that of EMD-SVD or WPT-PCA for feature extraction and Support Vector Machine (SVM) or Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) for classification...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the algorithms {{that were used}} for analysis of the PHM’ 09 gear-box. The purpose of the analysis was to detect and identify faults in various components of the gear-box. Each of the 560 vibration recordings presented {{a different set of}} faults, including distributed and localized gear faults, typical bearing faults and shaft faults. Each fault had to be pinpointed precisely. In the following sections we describe the algorithms used for finding faults in bearings, gears and shafts, and the conclusions that were reached. A special blend of pattern recognition and signal processing methods was applied. Bearings were analyzed using the orders representation of the envelope of a band pass filtered signal and an envelope of the de-phased signal.
