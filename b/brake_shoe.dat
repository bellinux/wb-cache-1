25|$|A {{member of}} the Princeton University class of 1921, Cook was an {{engineer}} specializing in metallurgy. He {{spent most of his}} working life at the American <b>Brake</b> <b>Shoe</b> Co. in Mahwah, New Jersey, later consulting on the Manhattan Project before retiring from the industry 1945. In the 1950s and 1960s, Cook worked as a mechanical engineering professor at Johns Hopkins University, where he published several academic papers.|$|E
25|$|If {{the front}} brake is mounted behind the fork a {{so-called}} self-assisting effect occurs. The friction force between <b>brake</b> <b>shoe</b> and rim creates a bending moment which presses the shoe even stronger {{on the rim}} thus leading to an amplified brake force. Self-assist reduces the input force needed to apply the brake. A disadvantage might be brake fade - a non-linear relation between actuation force and brake force.|$|E
25|$|Brake pads are {{available}} with numerous shapes and materials. Many consist of a replaceable rubber pad held on a mounting, or <b>brake</b> <b>shoe,</b> with a post or bolt on the back to attach to the brake. Some are made as one piece with the attachment directly molded in the pad for lower production costs; brake pads of the cartridge type are {{held in place by}} a metal split pin or threaded grub screw and can be replaced without moving the <b>brake</b> <b>shoe</b> from its alignment to the rim. The rubber can be softer for more braking force with less lever effort, or harder for longer life. Many pad designs have a rectangular shape; others are longer and curved to match the radius of the rim. Larger pads do not necessarily provide more braking force, but will wear more slowly (in relation to thickness), so can usually be thinner. In general, a brake can be fitted with a variety of pads, as long as the mounting is compatible. Carbon fiber rims may be more sensitive to damage by incorrectly-matched brake pads, and generally must use non-abrasive cork pads.|$|E
50|$|The <b>brake</b> <b>shoes</b> {{are held}} in place by reactor springs (2) and an {{adjuster}} (7) spring. There are also some minor clips not pictured to keep the <b>brake</b> <b>shoes</b> in place.|$|R
50|$|Alternatively, in a drum brake, {{the fluid}} enters a wheel {{cylinder}} and presses {{one or two}} <b>brake</b> <b>shoes</b> against {{the inside of the}} spinning drum. The <b>brake</b> <b>shoes</b> use a similar heat-tolerant friction material to the pads used in disc brakes.|$|R
50|$|Winch brake circuit: {{a shuttle}} valve {{provides}} brake control in pneumatic winch applications. When the compressor is operated the shuttle valves direct air {{to open the}} <b>brake</b> <b>shoes.</b> When the control valve is centered, the brake cylinder is vented through the shuttle valve, and the <b>brake</b> <b>shoes</b> are allowed to close.|$|R
25|$|Karl Drais {{included}} a pivoting <b>brake</b> <b>shoe</b> {{that could be}} pressed against the rear iron tyre of his 1817 Laufmaschine. This was continued on the earliest bicycles with pedals, such as the boneshaker, which were fitted with a spoon brake to press onto the rear wheel. The brake was operated by a lever or by a cord connecting to the handlebars. The rider could also slow down by resisting the pedals of the fixed wheel drive.|$|E
2500|$|The {{cantilever}} brake is a {{class of}} brake in which each arm {{is attached to a}} separate pivot point {{on one side of the}} seat stay or fork. [...] Thus all cantilever brakes are dual-pivot. [...] Both first- and second-class lever designs exist; second-class is by far the most common. [...] In the second-class lever design, the arm pivots below the rim. [...] The <b>brake</b> <b>shoe</b> is mounted above the pivot and is pressed against the rim as the two arms are drawn together. [...] In the first-class lever design, the arm pivots above the rim. [...] The <b>brake</b> <b>shoe</b> is mounted below the pivot and is pressed against the rim as the two arms are forced apart.|$|E

40|$|Brakes {{are very}} {{important}} part of the vehicle in supporting aspects of driving safety, brakes should be able to stop the vehicle as quickly as possible, and provide comfort. The objectives of this research was to investigate the influence of the use of wood powder, coconut shell charcoal, and copper powder with phenolic matrix as a material <b>brake</b> <b>Shoes,</b> <b>brake</b> <b>Shoes</b> wear and tear as well as investigating the amount of power needed by the motor when the rotating disc and investigate the resulting hardness. Research carried out by preparing all the materials and mix with 3 different variations discussed the specified composition. Later in the press with a load 3 tons for 30 minutes and heated with a temperature 1200 C for 30 minutes. After the specimens were finished later in the test friction force with a weight 15 kg for 30 minutes and measured motor power, brake temperature, disc rotation, and braking time also Brinell hardness test with force 15. 625 kg. Brinell hardness test result generated that violence resulting from <b>brake</b> <b>Shoes</b> Variation 1 has a value of 14. 47 BHN and <b>brake</b> <b>Shoes</b> Variation 2 has a value of 14. 3 BHN greater than <b>brake</b> <b>Shoes</b> Indopart has a value of 13. 7 BHN, while for Variation 3 has a value of 12. 6 BHN is smaller than Indopart...|$|R
2500|$|... "Roller cam brakes" [...] are centre-pull {{cantilever}} brakes actuated by {{the cable}} pulling a single two-sided sliding cam. [...] (First and second-class lever designs exist; first-class is {{most common and}} is described here.) [...] Each arm has a cam follower. [...] As the cam presses against the follower it forces the arms apart. [...] As {{the top of each}} arm moves outward, the <b>brake</b> <b>shoe</b> below the pivot is forced inward against the rim.|$|E
2500|$|Due {{to a wider}} {{possible}} {{distance between}} the mounts and pads, cantilever brakes are often preferred for bicycles that use wide tyres, such as on mountain bikes. Because the arms move only in their designed arcs, the <b>brake</b> <b>shoe</b> must be adjustable in several planes. [...] Thus cantilever brake shoes are notoriously difficult to adjust. As the brake shoes of a second-class cantilever brake wears, they ride lower on the rim. Eventually, one may go underneath the rim, so that the brake does not function.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{frequently}} ignored {{safety regulation}} {{mentioned in the}} report was the [...] "deadman's pedal", which a locomotive engineer had to keep depressed for the train to remain underway. [...] Were he to fall asleep or pass out, his foot would slip from the pedal, triggering an alarm and engaging the train's brakes automatically a few seconds later. [...] However, many engineers found this tiresome and bypassed the pedal by placing a heavy weight (often a worn out <b>brake</b> <b>shoe)</b> on it. [...] It was uncertain whether the pedal had been bypassed {{in this case because}} the lead locomotive of the train had been destroyed. [...] A more advanced safety device was available, the reset safety control (RSC), which required crew members to take an action such as pushing a button at regular intervals, or else automatic braking would occur, but neither lead locomotive was equipped with this safety feature. [...] While the second locomotive in the freight train was equipped with RSC, it was not assigned as the lead locomotive because it lacked a [...] "comfort cab". [...] Management and union practice was to place more comfortable locomotives at the front of trains, even at the expense of safety.|$|E

50|$|The wheel {{cylinder}} {{consists of a}} cylinder that has two pistons, one on each side. Each piston has a rubber seal and a shaft that connects the piston with a <b>brake</b> <b>shoe.</b> When brake pressure is applied, the pistons are forced out pushing the shoes {{into contact with the}} drum. Some designs use two single piston {{wheel cylinder}}s, one {{at the top of the}} drum and one at the bottom, each connected to one <b>brake</b> <b>shoe.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{braking force}} {{asserted}} {{is caused by}} the friction between the electromagnet and the face of the drum which depends on the current through the electromagnet (as stated before). The force applied on the <b>brake</b> <b>shoes</b> is counteracted by one of the reactor springs (which one depends on the direction of the rotation) so when the current through the electromagnet is withdrawn the spring ensures that the actuating arm is returned to resting position and the <b>brake</b> <b>shoes</b> are retracted from the drum.|$|R
50|$|Mechanical brake {{consists}} {{of a pair of}} <b>brake</b> <b>shoes</b> applied to the underside of the brake paths by the action of the compressed spring nest operating through a system of levers. Force is transmitted from the spring nest to main lever through a 2 in diameter steel rod 8 ft long. This vertical brake rod is always in tension as the springs are compressed. It also {{consists of}} a servospring mechanism which uses the compressed air to counteract the spring force to move the <b>brake</b> <b>shoes</b> away.|$|R
