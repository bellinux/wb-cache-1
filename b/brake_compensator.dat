50|$|The Grand Touring saloon is {{available}} with the XCKF2 injection engine. It was also available with a ZF automatic gearbox. The front indicator light clusters are now orange / white on all models. Two tone door linings (black top and bottom) on all models. Cigarette lighter fitted on Super Luxe only. <b>Brake</b> <b>compensator</b> fitted on petrol models.|$|E
25|$|A variant {{known as}} the Bizon-3 was also developed, and {{features}} a flip-up rear peep sight moved further to the rear on the receiver cover and a stock that folds {{up and over the}} receiver to lock into a spring-loaded latch on the receiver top cover. The weapon's barrel has an adapter for several types of muzzle devices. These are selected by the operator depending on the weapon's tactical employment and include sound suppressors, muzzle <b>brakes,</b> <b>compensators</b> and flash hiders.|$|R
50|$|<b>Brakes</b> and <b>compensators</b> {{also add}} length, diameter, and mass to the muzzle {{end of a}} firearm, where it most {{influences}} its handling and may interfere with accuracy as muzzle rise will occur when the brake is removed and shooting without the brake can throw off the strike of the round.|$|R
50|$|Construction of a muzzle <b>brake</b> or <b>compensator</b> can be {{as simple}} as a {{diagonal}} cut at the muzzle end of the barrel to direct some of the escaping gas upward. On the AKM assault rifle, the brake also angles slightly to the right to counteract the sideways movement of the rifle under recoil.|$|R
50|$|The FNAB-43 {{also uses}} a muzzle <b>brake</b> and <b>compensator</b> {{built into the}} barrel casing similar to some Russian weapons, and the {{magazine}} housing is hinged so that the magazine can lie beneath the barrel similarly to the French MAT-49. The single metal bar stock can be folded upwards rendering the weapon more compact.|$|R
5000|$|Several {{modernization}} accessories {{have been}} manufactured for the vz. 58 platform from different companies.Accessories include [...] "tactical" [...] bolt release, extended and/or ambidextrous magazine release paddles, ambidextrous fire mode selectors, custom handguard rails, {{several types of}} sight mounting options and various muzzle <b>brakes</b> and <b>compensators.</b> Both civilian and military users use these upgrades, and they also see frequent use with private military companies in the Middle East.|$|R
5000|$|Other {{variants}} {{are available}} through the Smith & Wesson's Performance Center. Like all Smith & Wesson revolvers, [...] "custom" [...] variants are available on special production runs with a minimum order of 500 units. An example is the John Ross Performance Center 5" [...]500 S&W Magnum, which features a 5-inch barrel with an external muzzle nut instead of a muzzle <b>brake</b> or <b>compensator</b> and a Millet dovetail front sight.|$|R
50|$|A serious {{tactical}} {{disadvantage of}} muzzle brakes on both small arms and artillery is that, {{depending on their}} designs, they may cause escaping gases to throw up dust and debris clouds that impair visibility and reveal one's position, not to mention posing a hazard to individuals without eye protection. Troops often wet {{the ground in front}} of antitank guns in defensive emplacements to prevent this, and snipers are specially trained in techniques for suppressing or concealing the magnified effects of lateral muzzle blast when firing rifles with such <b>brakes.</b> Linear <b>compensators</b> and suppressors do not have the disadvantages of a redirected muzzle blast; they actually reduce the blast by venting high pressure gas forward at reduced velocity.|$|R
50|$|With the AK-47's {{long-stroke}} piston gas system, {{the piston}} is mechanically {{fixed to the}} bolt group and moves through the entire operating cycle. The primary disadvantage to this system is the disruption of the point of aim due {{to the center of}} mass changing during the action cycle and energetic and abrupt stops {{at the beginning and end}} of bolt carrier travel. However, the AK-47's heavier weight and slower rate-of-fire do a good job of mitigating any disadvantage. In addition, newer AK-47 type rifles use a muzzle <b>brake</b> or <b>compensator</b> to reduce recoil. Some AK type rifles also have vertical foregrips to improve handling characteristics and to counter the effects of recoil.|$|R
50|$|The {{advantages}} of <b>brakes</b> and <b>compensators</b> {{are not without}} downsides, however. The shooter, gun crew, or close bystanders may perceive an increase in sound pressure level {{as well as an}} increase in muzzle blast and lead exposure. This occurs because the sound, flash, pressure waves, and lead loaded smoke plume normally projected away from the shooter are now partially redirected outward to the side or sometimes at partially backward angles toward the shooter or gun crew. Standard eye and ear protection, important for all shooters, may not be adequate to avoid hearing damage with the muzzle blast partially vectored back toward the gun crew or spotters by arrowhead shaped reactive muzzle brakes found on sniper team fired anti-materiel rifles like the Barrett M82.|$|R
50|$|There are downsides to both recoil <b>compensators</b> and muzzle <b>brakes.</b> They direct more of {{the muzzle}} flash to the sides or back towards the shooter - this is {{especially}} true of muzzle brakes. While eye and ear protection should always be used when shooting, this is even more essential with the muzzle blast directed back towards the shooter. <b>Brakes</b> and <b>compensators</b> are often quite bulky, adding length, diameter, and mass to the muzzle end of the firearm where it will affect the firearm's handling worst. While a simple slot milled in the barrel, such as those used in Magna-Porting, will provide some benefit, efficient redirection of the gas flow requires large ports and baffles to deflect as much gas as possible. It is also highly inadvisable to fire sabot rounds like shotgun slugs or APDS rounds through a muzzle brake not designed for them.|$|R
5000|$|Born into a {{prominent}} Texas family, Hyman Saul Lebman became an accomplished gunsmith and leather worker. During the 1930s, {{he opened a}} gun store and saddlery shop at 111 S. Flores Street in San Antonio. [...] Lebman was frequently asked by his customers to secure unusual weapons, including the Thompson submachine gun built by Colt, {{which at the time}} could be ordered through the mail and purchased at gun or hardware stores. Soon, Lehman began customizing Colt pistols and other small arms, including conversion into fully automatic weapons. One of his Lebman's specialties was the [...] "Baby machine gun", a Colt Model 1911 semi-automatic pistol in [...]45 Automatic or [...]38 Super caliber, converted to full-auto fire. This machine pistol featured an oversized ammunition magazine, a muzzle <b>brake</b> or <b>compensator,</b> and a fore grip adapted from the more familiar Thompson submachine gun.

50|$|Open {{division}} is the handgun {{equivalent to the}} Formula 1 race car where most modifications are permitted to achieve a faster and more accurate gun. It's the only division which permits optical and electronic sights (such as red dot sights) and recoil reducing muzzle <b>brakes</b> (also called <b>compensators).</b> The division facilitates the highest magazine capacity, placing a restriction of 170 mm maximum overall length measured {{at the rear of}} any magazine. Shorter magazines, i.e. 140 mm, are also popular because of easier handling and often more reliable feeding, leaving the competitor a choice of equipment according to the stage at hand.|$|R
50|$|A muzzle <b>brake</b> or recoil <b>compensator</b> is {{a device}} {{connected}} to the muzzle of a firearm or cannon that redirects propellant gases to counter recoil and unwanted rising of the barrel during rapid fire. The concept was first introduced for artillery and was a common feature on many anti-tank guns, especially those mounted on tanks, {{in order to reduce}} the area needed to take up the strokes of recoil and kickback. They have been used in various forms for rifles and pistols to help control recoil and the rising of the barrel that normally occurs after firing. They are used on pistols for practical pistol competitions, and are usually called compensators in this context.|$|R
50|$|There is a {{solution}} to the recoil issue, though it is not without cost. A muzzle <b>brake</b> or recoil <b>compensator</b> is a device which redirects the powder gas at the muzzle, usually up and back. This acts like a rocket, pushing the muzzle down and forward. The forward push helps negate the feel of the projectile recoil by pulling the firearm forwards. The downward push, on the other hand, helps counteract the rotation imparted by the fact that most firearms have the barrel mounted above the center of gravity. Overt combat guns, large-bore high-powered rifles, long-range handguns chambered for rifle ammunition, and action-shooting handguns designed for accurate rapid fire, all benefit from muzzle brakes.|$|R
5000|$|High Power Hunting Silhouette Rifle - A hunting style rifle {{having a}} maximum weight of 9 pounds, {{including}} sights and if applicable, an empty magazine or clip. The {{intent is to}} describe a common hunting rifle.(a) Caliber: 6mm or larger, provided that no belted cartridges or Magnums are allowed.(b) Sights: any telescopic or metallic sight may be used. Scopes may not be more than 1.5 inches above the rifle. Exception: for rifles that eject the empty cartridge case straight up and that normally use an offset scope, the scope may be offset. Any sighting device programmed to activate the firing mechanism is prohibited.(c) Stock: A hunting style stock; thumbhole-type stocks are not permitted. (d) Trigger: Trigger pull shall not be less than 2 pounds. Rifles must be equipped witha functional safety. All safety features, including any manual safety, must be functional.(e) Barrel: A hunting style contoured barrel that tapers from chamber to muzzle. Bull barrels are not permitted. A factory tuner that does not act as a muzzle <b>brake</b> or <b>compensator</b> is permitted. Maximum barrel length is 26 inches, including tuner.Magazines: Magazines may not be loaded with more than 5 rounds.|$|R
50|$|The OTs-33 is a {{selective}} fire blowback-operated weapon firing the 9×18mm Makarov pistol cartridge; it can use {{both types of}} 9x18mm ammunition, the standard 57-N-181S and the more powerful 57-N-181SM round. The blowback operation incorporates a feature that separates the slide and barrel as they move to the rear during recoil; there is no positive lock between the slide and barrel as in other conventional designs. As the slide and barrel separate, the spent case is ejected and the slide is then forced back to the barrel by a spring action, chambering a fresh cartridge in the process. The barrel and slide continue to the rear together in recoil for another 5 mm {{before returning to the}} forward position. This feature improves the automatic fire accuracy, reduces felt recoil, and is responsible for slowing down the cyclic rate of fire, without using a sophisticated rate reducer mechanism such as the one employed in the APS pistol. This method of operation also allows the use of standard and higher power 9x18mm ammunition without using a locked breech action. To further reduce felt recoil and compensate for muzzle rise during firing, some propellant gases are diverted into a ported slide cavity that acts as a muzzle <b>brake</b> and <b>compensator,</b> deflecting the gases upward to stabilize the barrel.|$|R
