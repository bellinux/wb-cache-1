500|$|Erik Adams of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode a {{moderately}} positive review and awarded it a [...] "B". Adams highlighted the serious discussion between Darryl and Jim in the warehouse, noting that [...] "Jim's extrication {{is something to}} root for", and that it honored [...] "Craig Robinson's dedication to the show". While feeling {{that some of the}} episode's subplots were [...] "forced", he did, however, compliment the Pam and Nellie pairing due to [...] "Pam's past ability to break through [...] Angela and Dwight's defenses". Bonnie Stiernberg of Paste magazine noted that, despite Andy's regression to [...] "his old ways", it was beneficial for the episode and allowed for many jokes to be played out. Furthermore, Stiernberg applauded the subtle drama that ran throughout the entry, writing Darryl, Erin, and Pete's interactions with Andy were important to the overall storyline. Mark Trammell of TV Equals named it [...] "the best episode of the final season of The Office to date" [...] because it [...] "played to the show's strengths". Furthermore, he complimented the character development of Nellie, writing that she [...] "really started to grow on me this week" [...] and that his favorite line was Darryl's [...] "words of wisdom" [...] to Jim: [...] "It's not real until your wife is on board." [...] Michael Tedder of New York magazine gave the episode a positive review and noted that [...] "It's <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>since</b> The Office was this surprising and moving." [...] He wrote that the main plot allowed for [...] "overdue development" [...] in regards to other characters and applauded the continued drama involving Pam and Jim; he called the last shot [...] "quietly heartbreaking". He did, however, call it a [...] "particularly overstuffed episode", and felt that Erin's subplot could have been saved for a different episode.|$|E

2500|$|Before making The Shining, Stanley Kubrick had {{directed}} the 1975 movie Barry Lyndon, a highly visual period film about an Irish man who {{attempts to make}} his way into the British aristocracy. Despite its technical achievements, the film was not a box office success in the United States and was derided by critics for being too long and too slow. Kubrick, disappointed with Barry Lyndons lack of success, realized he needed to make a film that would be commercially viable as well as artistically fulfilling. Stephen King was told [...] that Kubrick had his staff bring him stacks of horror books as he planted [...] himself in his office to read them all: [...] "Kubrick's secretary heard the sound of each book hitting the wall as the director flung it into a reject pile after reading the first few pages.

2500|$|Gordon Smart, the show-business editor from The Sun, {{said that}} Dyer was a [...] "brilliant signing for EastEnders—they are a match in soap heaven", {{saying it was}} [...] "about time" [...] that the show brought in some [...] "fresh blood". He said, [...] "It has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>since</b> the {{struggling}} Albert Square show had a character with presence beyond The Queen Vic and Danny is just the man for the job." [...] He added that Dyer's good acting skills and [...] "bags of character" [...] would give EastEnders [...] "the geezer it's been crying out for." [...] However, the newspaper's television critic, Ally Ross, said that EastEnders had reached a [...] "dead end" [...] recently and their solution was to bring in Dyer: [...] "one of those slap-the-forehead appointments that instantly has you wondering, 'which {{one of them is}} slumming it?'

I am so excited about returning and seeing what the future holds for her. [...] It's <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>since</b> I set foot in Albert Square and I am looking forward to coming home." [...] Executive producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins added: [...] "Stacey is one of EastEnders best-loved characters, played by one of television's finest actors, and I am tremendously excited that Lacey has decided to return home to Walford. Stacey's last time on the Square was iconic. But that was just the first act. There is so much more to come for Stacey—and her return will send ripples of drama through the Square." [...] Stacey confesses to the murder of Archie Mitchell. Lacey Turner took a break to film the new series of Our Girl.

2500|$|Jeta Amata, {{who grew}} up in the Niger Delta stated in an {{interview}} that it has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>since</b> he has wanted to make a film on the Niger Delta. He had written three scripts on it for about eight years; but as the issues kept escalating, it seemed more difficult to make [...] "but I got to the point where I knew it just has to be now". [...] Black November is fiction based on an actual event, the title being derived from the month in which activist Ken Saro-Wiwa was executed in 1995. Amata had once met Saro-Wiwa through his father and was affected by his death. The recent Niger Delta militancy further triggered Amata's interest to make the film; Jeta Amata had to meet with most of the Niger Delta ex-militants such as Asari Dokubo and Boyloaf to listen to their sides of the story. He stated in an interview: [...] "What I'm doing is what they did, but without weapons." [...] Amata explained that even though the film touched some political points, he is more concerned about the human parts of the story, about the feelings of the people and what they passed through: [...] "We are not trying to fight the government, trying to fight the oil companies, no -- we are trying to repair what has been damaged". [...] The film was majorly funded by a Nigerian business magnate, Captain Hosa Wells Okunbo, who says he does not want to go down in history as [...] "just another rich merchant", he wants to give something back to the region that made him wealthy.|$|E
