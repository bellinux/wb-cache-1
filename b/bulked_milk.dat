30|$|The {{microbial}} loads in the <b>bulked</b> <b>milk</b> {{were nearly}} {{similar to the}} microbial load on the container surface and higher than in milk before bulking, indicating contamination of milk from the container inner surfaces. Therefore, the act of bulking and re-bulking of milk into several containers from the bulking at the herd level through several stages/points along the chain to the market creates or increases risks of microbial contamination from the inner surface of containers. Studies have shown that there are increases of microbial load in camel milk from the herd level to the primary collection centres and final market due {{to the practice of}} transferring milk between several containers (Kaindi et al. 2011).|$|E
30|$|The LAB in milk produce {{lactic acid}} and other {{antibacterial}} substances like bacteriocins that have detrimental effect on other micro-flora {{in the milk}} (Tezera and Bruckner 2000). The lactic acid produced lowers the pH of the milk, inducing the acids to be lipid-soluble and diffuse into the cytoplasm of bacteria through the cell membrane which either inhibit the physiological processes or destroy the bacteria (Gottschalk 1988). Therefore, this can be the cause for the lower TCC in <b>bulked</b> <b>milk</b> than from the smoked containers, and the Klebsiella spp. and Salmonella spp. were the most affected. LAB are also known to produce bacteriocins and enzymes that can control bio-film formation and growth of spoilage and pathogens (Millette et al. 2006), hence preservation of the milk.|$|E

40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to assess how {{different}} bacterial groups in <b>bulk</b> <b>milk</b> are related to <b>bulk</b> <b>milk</b> somatic cell count (SCC), <b>bulk</b> <b>milk</b> total bacterial count (TBC), and <b>bulk</b> <b>milk</b> standard plate count (SPC) and to measure the repeatability of <b>bulk</b> <b>milk</b> culturing. On 53 Dutch dairy goat farms, 3 <b>bulk</b> <b>milk</b> samples were collected at intervals of 2 wk. The samples were cultured for SPC, coliform count, and staphylococcal count and for the presence of Staphylococcus aureus. Furthermore, SCC (Fossomatic 5000, Foss, Hillerød, Denmark) and TBC (BactoScan FC 150, Foss) were measured. Staphylococcal count was correlated to SCC (r= 0. 40), TBC (r= 0. 51), and SPC (r= 0. 53). Coliform count was correlated to TBC (r= 0. 33), but not to any of the other variables. Staphylococcus aureus did not correlate to SCC. The contribution of the staphylococcal count to the SPC was 31 %, whereas the coliform count comprised only 1 % of the SPC. The agreement of the repeated measurements was low. This study indicates that staphylococci in goat <b>bulk</b> <b>milk</b> are related to SCC and make a significant contribution to SPC.

30|$|The {{detection}} of coliforms and E. coli in milk indicates a possible contamination from milk-handling containers (Bonfoh et al. 2003). Coliforms are indicator micro-organisms, {{and the presence of}} E. coli implies a risk of presence of enteric pathogens in milk (Chye et al. 2004). Therefore, the coliforms in <b>bulked</b> <b>milk</b> could be originating from other sources of contamination, such as milk handlers, besides the milk-handling containers. Studies have shown that handling small quantities of milk is subject to a high rate of contamination due to the small ratio of milk volume to container volume (Bonfoh et al. 2003). However, the coliforms in pooled milk being lower than on container surfaces {{can be explained by the}} growth of LAB, which produce inhibitory metabolic substances such as lactic and acetic acids, hydrogen peroxide, and bacteriocins (Koutsoumanis et al. 2006). Earlier studies have shown that milk from the camel udder have low microbial load compared to pooled/bulked milk in plastic containers (Matofari et al. 2007; Kaindi et al. 2011). This suggests that milk-handling containers account for the majority of GNR in milk.|$|E
40|$|Samples of unpasteurised <b>bulked</b> <b>milk,</b> taken {{directly}} from ten herds of dairy cattle on {{rural and urban}} farms in the north west of England on five separate sampling occasions, were analysed {{for a range of}} PCB congeners. ΣPCB concentrations (sum of 37 congeners) ranged from 3. 4 – 16. 4 ng/g milk fat with a mean ΣPCB concentration of 8. 4 ng/g milk fat. The dominating congeners were 118, 153, 138 and 180, which contributed 15 %, 20 %, 17 % and 9 % of the ΣPCB load respectively. The chlorine pattern of the congeners which made moderate or major contributions to the ΣPCB concentration were typically substituted at both para positions (4, 4 ′), while the PCB congeners not detected in the milk had at least one ring that was not 4 -substituted. These results indicate the 4, 4 ′ substitution pattern as being the key to PCB persistence in cows. It is estimated that consumption of typical daily intakes of milk with the PCB concentrations measured in this study would contribute 11 % of the average daily ΣPCB intake for individuals in the UK. This contribution would increase to 30 % when exposure through the consumption of dairy products prepared from such milk (e. g. cheese, butter) is taken into account. It is estimated that the inclusion of the TEF assigned PCBs would typically increase the TEQ rating of cows' milk by approximately 40 % over that attributed to PCDD/Fs alone...|$|E
40|$|Milk from {{alpine grazing}} shows a {{different}} fatty acids profile (FA) from that produced in lowlands farms. In particular, {{it seems to}} have an increased content in Mono- and Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids (MUFA and PUFA) and a better n- 6 to n- 3 ratio. Conjugated linoleic acid compounds (CLA) content also seems to be enriched. The present study aimed at evaluating the effect of alpine grazing (AG), in comparison to a Total Mixed Ration (TMR) feeding system, on fatty acids profile of milk. The study took place from May to September 2006 and involved a farm which during summer move to alpine grazing (Novegno Mountain - Vicenza, North Italy). During the lowland period (P 1, May, 25) animals were fed a TMR diet, whereas during the alpine periods (P 2, July, 18; P 3, September, 5) animals were kept at pasture and received a concentrate supplement based on maize and barley. <b>Bulked</b> <b>milk</b> samples (mix of evening and morning milking) were collected 3 times throughout one week of each experimental periods (n= 9). FA profile was assessed by gas-chromatography and the obtained data (% of the total detected FAME) were submitted to a one-way ANOVA; the 3 levels of fixed effect Period/Feeding system were used to calculate two orthogonal contrasts (P 1 vs P 2 +P 3 and P 2 vs P 3). Results showed a significant decrease of Saturated Fatty Acids (from P 1 : 62. 9 to P 3 : 56. 6 %; P< 0. 001) and an increase of MUFA (from P 1 : 25. 3 to P 3 : 31. 1; P< 0. 001) and PUFA (from P 1 : 4. 2 to P 3 : 5. 5; P< 0. 01), determining also a better n- 6 to n- 3 ratio (from P 1 : 3. 6 to P 3 : 2. 6; P< 0. 01), Thrombogenic (from P 1 : 3. 1 to P 3 : 2. 3; P< 0. 001) and Atherogenic (from P 1 : 2. 6 to P 3 : 1. 9; P< 0. 001) indexes and CLA content (from P 1 : 0. 8 to P 3 : 2. 2; P< 0. 001). For all of these variables contrast analysis showed a significant difference (P< 0, 01) between TMR (P 1) and Alpine grazing (P 2 +P 3). These results could be explained by the higher intake of unsaturated FA when cows grazed on alpine pasture. Moreover, the increase of Unsaturated Fatty Acids during P 2 and P 3 periods was probably due to the high mobilization of body fat, {{as a result of the}} deficiency in energy intake and/or of the advanced stage of lactation. In conclusion, alpine grazing seems to enhance fatty acid profile of milk, with particular regard to those fractions of interest in human nutrition...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aims of {{this study}} were to {{evaluate}} a commercially available ELISA for the detection of bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) -specific antibodies in individual milk compared with individual serum samples, and in <b>bulk</b> <b>milk</b> samples compared with within-herd antibody prevalence and <b>bulk</b> <b>milk</b> quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) results. METHODS: Paired individual serum and individual milk samples were collected from 125 lactating cows and tested by ELISA; 96 <b>bulk</b> <b>milk</b> samples were also tested. Within-herd antibody prevalence was calculated based on milk ELISA results for 25 individual cows in each herd. Additionally, 167 <b>bulk</b> <b>milk</b> samples were tested for BVDV-specific antibodies by ELISA and for the presence of BVDV by qRT-PCR to establish the correlation between antibody result and virus presence. RESULTS: Good agreement was observed between individual milk and serum results (Kappa = 0. 865). The ELISA was observed to detect BVDV-specific antibodies in individual milk samples with a relative sensitivity of 96. 6 % and specificity of 89. 2 %. The <b>bulk</b> <b>milk</b> samples revealed a strong (r(2) = 0. 95) relationship between the ELISA result and the within-herd antibody prevalence. The proportion of herds that tested positive by <b>bulk</b> <b>milk</b> qRT-PCR increased as the <b>bulk</b> <b>milk</b> antibody S/P ratio increased. CONCLUSION: Commercially available ELISA testing of individual and <b>bulk</b> <b>milk</b> samples is an appropriate alternative to serum testing with good test performance in these samples. Determining a threshold for the detection of herds containing active BVD infection by testing <b>bulk</b> <b>milk</b> is a novel use for an antibody ELISA kit and provides more practical, relevant test results.

40|$|Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) {{have become}} the main {{pathogens}} causing bovine mastitis in recent years. A huge variation in species distribution among herds has been observed in several studies, emphasizing the need to identify subgroup- and species specific herd-level factors to improve {{our understanding of the}} differences in ecological and epidemiological nature between species. The use of <b>bulk</b> <b>milk</b> samples enables the inclusion of a large(r) number of herds needed to identify herd-level risk factors and increases the likelihood of recovering enough isolates per species needed for conducting subgroup- and, eventually, species-specific analyses at the same time. This study aimed to describe the prevalence and distribution of CNS species in <b>bulk</b> <b>milk</b> samples and to identify associated subgroup- and species-specific herd-level factors. Ninety percent of all <b>bulk</b> <b>milk</b> samples yielded CNS. Staphylococcus equorum was the predominant species, followed by Staphylococcus haemolyticus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. A seasonal effect was observed for several CNS species. <b>Bulk</b> <b>milk</b> samples from herds with a loose-pack or a tiestall housing system were more likely to yield CNS species compared with herds with a freestall barn, except for S. epidermidis, Staphylococcus simulans, and Staphylococcus cohnii. In September, herds in which udders were clipped had lower odds of yielding Staphylococcus chromogenes, S. simulans, and Staphylococcus xylosus, the CNS species assumed to be most relevant for udder health, in their <b>bulk</b> <b>milk</b> than herds in which udder clipping was not practiced. <b>Bulk</b> <b>milk</b> of herds participating in a monthly veterinary udder health-monitoring program was more likely to yield these 3 CNS species. Herds always receiving their milk quality premium or predisinfecting teats before attachment of the milking cluster had lower odds of having S. equorum in their <b>bulk</b> <b>milk.</b> Herds not using a single dry cotton or paper towel for each cow during premilking udder preparation {{were more likely to have}} S. cohnii-positive <b>bulk</b> <b>milk.</b> Herds in which flushing with hot water or steam of the milking cluster after having milked a cow with a (sub) clinical mastitis was applied, were less likely to yield S. simulans, S. haemolyticus, and S. cohnii in their <b>bulk</b> <b>milk.</b> Always wearing gloves during milking decreased the odds of having Staphylococcus devriesei-positive <b>bulk</b> <b>milk.</b> Tap water from the public drinking system used as drinking water increased the odds of yielding S. simulans in the <b>bulk</b> <b>milk.</b> In conclusion, CNS are highly prevalent in <b>bulk</b> <b>milk</b> and might originate from the environment for some species (we hypothesize this is true for S. equorum or S. cohnii), or from within the udder (e. g., for S. simulans). Studies collecting <b>bulk</b> <b>milk</b> and quarter milk samples at the same time along with environmental samples are needed to determine the exact origin of the different (subgroups of) CNS species present in <b>bulk</b> <b>milk</b> using strain-typing techniques...|$|R

Three data sets were created, (1) data set A (N = 4623) with all measurements recorded for each herd {{for the same}} milk sample; (2) data B (N = 30 120) with all measurements of BMSCC and milk composition recorded for each herd within a 10 day period but not necessarily on the same sample of bulk milk; and (3) data set C (N = 33 800) with all measurements of <b>bulk</b> <b>milk</b> bacteria numbers and milk composition recorded for each herd within a 10 day period but not necessarily on the same sample of <b>bulk</b> <b>milk.</b> Correlation {{was used to determine}} the {{association between}} <b>bulk</b> <b>milk</b> SCC and bacteria numbers and milk composition. Multiple regression analysis was also carried to determine the association between bacteria numbers (dependent variable) and SCC and milk composition for early lactation and whole lactation. The results showed the overall average of the mean BMSCC of 280 000 cells/ml of all the farms studied. Approximately 85 % of the farms supplied <b>bulk</b> <b>milk</b> with SCC 5 OO OO 0 cells/ml. Both <b>bulk</b> <b>milk</b> SCC and bacteria numbers were higher in early and late parts of lactation. Highly significant but low positive corretations occurred between the mean <b>bulk</b> <b>milk</b> SCC and bacteria number in early (r = o. 24; r 2 = 0. 06; P< 0. 001) and whole lactation(r = 0. 15; r 2 = 0. 02; p< 0. 001). Thus 2 to 6 % of the variation observed in bacteria count was accounted for by variation in <b>bulk</b> <b>milk</b> SCC. The mean fat %, protein % and total solids % increased from mid-lactation to the end of lactation. In contrast, the mean lactose % showed a decrease as the lactation progressed. On the average for the whole lactation, low positive correlations occurred between the mean <b>bulk</b> <b>milk</b> SCC and fat % (r = 0. 18), protein % (r = 0. 26) and total solids % (r = 0. 15). However, a moderate but highly significant negative correlation occurred between <b>bulk</b> <b>milk</b> SCC and lactose %(r= - 0. 43; P< 0. 001). In conclusion the overall low average BMSCC suggests that good quality <b>bulk</b> <b>milk</b> was supplied to the company, which also meets the EC standards. Significant low correlation between BMSCC and bacteria numbers suggests that mastitis bacteria were only a small but significant contributor to the high bacteria count in the <b>bulk</b> <b>milk</b> particularly in early lactation, with dirty milking machines or poor cooling being the most likely major contributor.

The management style of the first group of farmers was described as clean and accurate; the management style of the second group of farmers was described as quick and dirty. The relationship between clusters and the <b>bulk</b> <b>milk</b> SCC category was high. The relationship between clusters and incidence rate of clinical mastitis was weak.

The amount of S. aureus positive milk samples (0, 1, 2 or 3 out of 3) did not affect the mean BMSCC. BMSPC was determined for 20 % by BMMFS and for 13 % by BMCNS. Coliforms do not seem to affect BMSCC and BMSPC. S. aureus was present in 53. 5 % of 159 milk samples. On 85 % of all the participating dairy goat farms S. aureus was found in 1 or more milk samples.

The {{objectives of}} this study were to use quarterly <b>bulk</b> <b>milk</b> and ‘spot’ testing of unvaccinated youngstock to establish the national prevalence of exposure to BVDV and/or BoHV- 1 in Irish dairy herds. Seasonality of <b>bulk</b> <b>milk</b> ELISA results was also examined. From a geographically representative population of 305 dairy herds, 88 % and 80 % of herds yielded mean annual positive <b>bulk</b> <b>milk</b> readings for BVDV and BoHV- 1, respectively. Of these, 61 % were vaccinated against BVDV and 12 % against BoHV- 1. A total of 2171 serum samples from weanlings having a mean age of 291 days yielded 543 (25 %) seropositive for BVDV, and 117 (5. 4 %) seropositive for BoHV- 1.

40|$|Abstract In {{recent years}} many farms {{experience}} outbreaks due to lungworm infection in dairy cows. Outbreaks {{are accompanied by}} respiratory distress, reduced production and loss in body condition {{as well as some}} deaths. This can lead to high economic losses. Therefore a good and easy to use diagnostic assay would be most welcome. For this purpose a <b>bulk</b> <b>milk</b> ELISA would be most useful. In the present study 37 farms were visited. Of these were 21 control farms and 16 were farms with a reported lungworm outbreak. On each farm up to 20 first-calving heifers and up to 20 older cows were sampled for faeces and blood. The faeces was used to detect lungworm larvae, while the blood samples were used in an ELISA based on the Ceditest®- Lelystad assay. In addition, on each farm a <b>bulk</b> <b>milk</b> sample was collected, which was also tested in an ELISA using the same antigen as in the Ceditest®- Lelystad assay. Data were used to evaluate the <b>bulk</b> <b>milk</b> ELISA as a diagnostic assay. Results showed that farms with a serious lungworm outbreak had a highly positive <b>bulk</b> <b>milk</b> ELISA. But not all farms with a high positive <b>bulk</b> <b>milk</b> ELISA also had a lungworm outbreak. Furthermore, not all lungworm infections as detected in the individual Baermanns and ELISAs were detected with the <b>bulk</b> <b>milk</b> ELISA. Interestingly, many older cows were found shedding lungworm larvae, which was to some extent unexpected in view of the re-infection syndrome. The latter indicates that there remains unresolved aspects on the infection dynamics of Dictyocaulus viviparus in adult cow-herds...|$|R
40|$|Strains of Staphylococcus aureus {{obtained}} from bovine (n = 117) and caprine (n = 114) <b>bulk</b> <b>milk</b> were characterized and compared with S. aureus strains from raw-milk products (n = 27), bovine mastitis specimens (n = 9), and human blood cultures (n = 39). All isolates were typed by {{pulsed-field gel electrophoresis}} (PFGE). In addition, subsets of isolates were characterized using multilocus sequence typing (MLST), multiplex PCR (m-PCR) for genes encoding nine of the staphylococcal enterotoxins (SE), and the cloverleaf method for penicillin resistance. A variety of genotypes were observed, and greater genetic diversity was found among bovine than caprine <b>bulk</b> <b>milk</b> isolates. Certain genotypes, with a wide geographic distribution, were common to bovine and caprine <b>bulk</b> <b>milk</b> and may represent ruminant-specialized S. aureus. Isolates with genotypes indistinguishable from those of strains from ruminant mastitis were frequently found in <b>bulk</b> <b>milk,</b> and strains with genotypes indistinguishable from those from <b>bulk</b> <b>milk</b> were observed in raw-milk products. This indicates that S. aureus from infected udders may contaminate <b>bulk</b> <b>milk</b> and, subsequently, raw-milk products. Human blood culture isolates were diverse and differed from isolates from other sources. Genotyping by PFGE, MLST, and m-PCR for SE genes largely corresponded. In general, isolates with indistinguishable PFGE banding patterns had the same SE gene profile and isolates with identical SE gene profiles were placed together in PFGE clusters. Phylogenetic analyses agreed with the division of MLST sequence types into clonal complexes, and isolates within the same clonal complex had the same SE gene profile. Furthermore, isolates within PFGE clusters generally belonged to the same clonal complex...|$|R

40|$|Udder {{health was}} studied in 300 dairy herds grouped in three {{categories}} {{according to the}} <b>bulk</b> <b>milk</b> somatic cell count. In all herds, lactating cows were housed in a free-stall barn during the winter. All herds participated in a three or four-weekly milk recording system, had annual production quota between 300, 000 and 900, 000 kg, and were stocked with cows of the Holstein-Friesian or Dutch Friesian breeds. The incidence of clinical mastitis was not different among herds with a low (< or = 150, 000), middle (151, 000 to 250, 000), or high (251, 000 to 400, 000 cells/ml) <b>bulk</b> <b>milk</b> somatic cell count. Clinical mastitis caused by Gram-negative pathogens occurred more often in herds with a low <b>bulk</b> <b>milk</b> somatic cell count. Clinical mastitis caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, or Streptococcus agalactiae occurred more often in herds with a high <b>bulk</b> <b>milk</b> somatic cell count; however, the incidence of clinical Streptococcus uberis mastitis was not different among the three herd categories. The differences in <b>bulk</b> <b>milk</b> somatic cell count between the categories {{could be explained by}} the management practices studied. The incidence of clinical E. coli mastitis was mostly related to housing, hygiene, and milking machine. The incidence of clinical Staphylococcus aureus mastitis was associated with factors that were related to the <b>bulk</b> <b>milk</b> somatic cell count and to factors of which it was not clear whether they were a cause or effect of the high incidence of Staphylococcus aureus mastitis. The incidence of clinical Streptococcus dysgalactiae mastitis was related to nutrition, milking technique, and milking machine. The incidence of clinical Streptococcus uberis mastitis was associated with housing, nutrition, and milking machine. Two groups of farmers and herds could be differentiated. The first group was identified as 'Clean and Accurate', and the second group as 'Quick and Dirty'. The relationship between these two groups and <b>bulk</b> <b>milk</b> somatic cell count category was high. However, {{the relationship between the two}} groups and the incidence of clinical mastitis was weak. LR: 20061115; PUBM: Print; JID: 0031550; ppublishSource type: Electronic(1...|$|R

It is well known fact that operation of many refrigeration systems is dynamic in nature and <b>bulk</b> <b>milk</b> coolers are no exception to this. It is necessary to study <b>bulk</b> <b>milk</b> cooling systems and improve them to reduce chilling time and energy consumption within desired limits. <b>Bulk</b> <b>milk</b> coolers are analyzed and diagnosed with a simple thermodynamic model. A global approach is required whereby detailed component models are linked together to develop an accurate and complete simulation model package of vapour compression <b>bulk</b> <b>milk</b> cooler. These component models include mass, momentum and energy balance equation along with thermo physical property data and the appropriate heat or work transfer relationships. Solving these equations by method of substitution yields a prediction of refrigeration system behaviour. This helps in large reduction in time and cost spent in designing a system for given application, leading to the opportunity of achieving a more optimal design through evaluation of different design configurations. This dynamic model helps in adopting better control strategies to improve energy efficiency. The authors have attempted to develop such a global model for <b>bulk</b> <b>milk</b> coolers using vapour compression system with R 22 as refrigerant. cs 201...|$|R

40|$|A {{cross-sectional}} {{study was conducted}} from October 2009 to March 2010 to assess the level of contamination of informally marketed milk with Staphylococcus aureus at farms and milk collection centers in Debre Zeit, Ethiopia. One hundred seventy raw farm <b>bulk</b> <b>milk,</b> 25 mixed <b>bulk</b> <b>milk</b> samples and 20 pasteurized and packaged milk samples were collected from 14 milk collection centers and isolation and identification of S. aureus were carried out following standard method. S. aureus was isolated from 44 % of farm <b>bulk</b> <b>milk</b> and 72 % of <b>milk</b> collection centers’ <b>bulk</b> <b>milk</b> {{and it was not}} detected from pasteurized milk samples. Contamination rates of farm <b>bulk</b> <b>milk</b> with Staphylococcus aureus were significantly different among the collection centers where samples were collected (x squared= 31. 8, df= 13, p= 0. 003). The milk produced and collected in peri-urban areas was significantly more contaminated with S. aureus (64 %) than milk produced and collected in urban areas (38 %) (x squared= 7. 18, df= 1, p= 0. 007). The frequency of isolation of S. aureus in <b>milk</b> collection centers <b>bulk</b> <b>milk</b> varied between 67 % and 100 % among collection centers. However, the contamination rates were not significantly different among these collection centers (x squared= 1. 5, df= 4, p= 0. 83).

However, {{the extent of}} the effect that dairy farm audits have on milk quality is unknown. Data from over 13, 000 audits performed on 12, 855 dairy farms from February 2006 to April 2008 were merged with laboratory test results of 325, 150 <b>bulk</b> <b>milk</b> samples collected 6 mo before and after the audit. A linear mixed model with the method of restricted maximum likelihood was conducted to study whether the total bacterial counts (TBC) of <b>bulk</b> <b>milk</b> were lower during the periods before and after the dairy farm audit. Results showed that TBC values were 2 to 6 % lower (i. e., 0. 010 to 0. 026 log cfu/mL) for a period from 1. 5 to at least 6 mo after an audit. Additionally, several variables were significantly associated with <b>bulk</b> <b>milk</b> TBC values: seasonality, total number of attention points (given if some checklist points were not appropriate), audit type, audit result, and the categories milking equipment maintenance, and utility room-tank maintenance. The TBC values increased with a higher level of attention points. Furthermore, the farms rejected based on the audit results had the highest average TBC values and the approved farms had the lowest values.

Leptospirosis {{is also one of}} the most common causes of reproductive losses in cattle worldwide and is associated with significant economic costs to the dairy farming industry. Herds are tested for exposure to the causal organism either through serum testing of individual animals or through testing <b>bulk</b> <b>milk</b> samples. Using serum results from a commonly used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test for Leptospira interrogans serovar Hardjo (L. hardjo) on samples from 979 animals across 12 Scottish dairy herds and the corresponding <b>bulk</b> <b>milk</b> results, we develop a model that predicts the mean proportion of exposed animals in a herd conditional on the <b>bulk</b> <b>milk</b> test result. The data are analyzed through use of a Bayesian latent variable generalized linear mixed model to provide estimates of the true (but unobserved) level of exposure to the causal organism in each herd in addition to estimates of the accuracy of the serum ELISA. We estimate 95 % confidence intervals for the accuracy of the serum ELISA of (0. 688, 0. 987) and (0. 975, 0. 998) for test sensitivity and specificity, respectively. Using a percentage positivity cutoff in <b>bulk</b> <b>milk</b> of at most 41 % ensures that there is at least a 97. 5 % probability of less than 5 % of the herd being exposed to L. hardjo.

40|$|All dairy {{processors}} {{depend on}} a continuous supply of high-quality <b>bulk</b> <b>milk</b> from milk producers {{to be able to}} distribute liquid milk and dairy products. Mastitis, inflammation of the bovine udder, is the most common disease in dairy cows, and leads to altered milk composition and impaired milk quality. The somatic cell count (SCC) is currently used as a marker for udder health, and indirectly, for <b>bulk</b> <b>milk</b> quality, but because it is somewhat insensitive and unspecific, there has been an interest to find alternative markers. The main objective of this thesis was to acquire more knowledge about two potential markers for <b>bulk</b> <b>milk</b> quality: polymorphonuclear leukocyte count (PMNC) and α-lactalbumin (α-LA). Another objective was to study if the combination of α-LA, haptoglobin (Hp) and serum amyloid A (SAA) in an acute phase index (API) could be useful as an alternative marker for <b>bulk</b> <b>milk</b> quality. <b>Bulk</b> <b>milk</b> samples were collected from Swedish dairy farms and analyzed for PMNC, α-LA, SCC, haptoglobin (Hp), serum amyloid A (SAA), fat, lactose, total protein and casein contents, casein number, protein composition, proteolysis and coagulating properties. An API was calculated for each sample by combining results on α-LA, Hp and SAA. Samples with high PMNC had a lower casein number than samples with low PMNC, while samples with high SCC had lower lactose and casein contents, lower casein number and more proteolysis than low SCC samples. There {{was no significant difference in}} the inflammatory markers SCC, PMNC, Hp and SAA between milk samples containing low, medium or high concentrations of α-LA. Differences between α-LA groups were, however, found in some milk quality parameters as high α-LA concentration was related to low concentrations of αs 1 -, αs 2 - and β-casein, and high concentrations of lactose and β-lactoglobulin. High API was related to low lactose content and casein number. In conclusion, PMNC and α-LA were not considered more useful markers of inflammation and <b>milk</b> quality in <b>bulk</b> <b>milk</b> than SCC, which is currently used...|$|R
