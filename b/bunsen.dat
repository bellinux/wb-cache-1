5|$|German chemists Robert <b>Bunsen</b> and Gustav Kirchhoff {{discovered}} rubidium in 1861 by {{the newly}} developed technique, flame spectroscopy.|$|E
5|$|Rubidium and caesium {{were the}} first {{elements}} to be discovered using the spectroscope, invented in 1859 by Robert <b>Bunsen</b> and Gustav Kirchhoff. The next year, they discovered caesium in the mineral water from Bad Dürkheim, Germany. Their discovery of rubidium came the following year in Heidelberg, Germany, finding it in the mineral lepidolite. The names of rubidium and caesium come from the most prominent lines in their emission spectra: a bright red line for rubidium (from the Latin word rubidus, meaning dark red or bright red), and a sky-blue line for caesium (derived from the Latin word caesius, meaning sky-blue).|$|E
5|$|Arfwedson later {{showed that}} this same element {{was present in}} the {{minerals}} spodumene and lepidolite. In 1818, Christian Gmelin {{was the first to}} observe that lithium salts give a bright red color to flame. However, both Arfwedson and Gmelin tried and failed to isolate the pure element from its salts. It was not isolated until 1821, when William Thomas Brande obtained it by electrolysis of lithium oxide, a process that had previously been employed by the chemist Sir Humphry Davy to isolate the alkali metals potassium and sodium. Brande also described some pure salts of lithium, such as the chloride, and, estimating that lithia (lithium oxide) contained about 55% metal, estimated the atomic weight of lithium to be around 9.8 g/mol (modern value ~6.94 g/mol). In 1855, larger quantities of lithium were produced through the electrolysis of lithium chloride by Robert <b>Bunsen</b> and Augustus Matthiessen. The discovery of this procedure led to commercial production of lithium in 1923 by the German company Metallgesellschaft AG, which performed an electrolysis of a liquid mixture of lithium chloride and potassium chloride.|$|E
5|$|After the {{publication}} of the improved method of flame spectroscopy by Robert <b>Bunsen</b> and Gustav Kirchhoff and the discovery of caesium and rubidium in the years 1859 to 1860, flame spectroscopy became an approved method to determine the composition of minerals and chemical products. William Crookes and Claude-Auguste Lamy both started to use the new method. William Crookes used it to make spectroscopic determinations for tellurium on selenium compounds deposited in the lead chamber of a sulfuric acid production plant near Tilkerode in the Harz mountains. He had obtained the samples for his research on selenium cyanide from August Hofmann years earlier. By 1862, Crookes was able to isolate small quantities of the new element and determine the properties of a few compounds. Claude-Auguste Lamy used a spectrometer that was similar to Crookes' to determine the composition of a selenium-containing substance which was deposited during the production of sulfuric acid from pyrite. He also noticed the new green line in the spectra and concluded that a new element was present. Lamy had received this material from the sulfuric acid plant of his friend Fréd Kuhlmann and this by-product was available in large quantities. Lamy started to isolate the new element from that source. The fact that Lamy was able to work ample quantities of thallium enabled him to determine the properties of several compounds and in addition he prepared a small ingot of metallic thallium which he prepared by remelting thallium he had obtained by electrolysis of thallium salts.|$|E

25|$|A {{vertical}} U-shaped tube {{was arranged}} {{so that it}} could be heated by a series of <b>Bunsen</b> burners on each side. A simple flow meter indicated the direction and approximate strength of any flow through the tank at the top linking the two arms of the U.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the success}} of the Franco-Tuscan Expedition to Egypt under the {{leadership}} of Jean-François Champollion, the Prussian scientists Alexander von Humboldt and Robert Wilhelm <b>Bunsen</b> and the minister of instruction Johann Eichhorn recommended to king Frederick William IV that an expedition be sent to Egypt.|$|E
25|$|Both {{diethyl ether}} and carbon {{disulfide}} have exceptionally low autoignition temperatures which increase greatly the fire {{risk associated with}} these solvents. The autoignition temperature of carbon disulfide is below 100°C (212°F), so objects such as steam pipes, light bulbs, hotplates, and recently-extinguished <b>bunsen</b> burners are able to ignite its vapours.|$|E
25|$|Philosophers Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Karl Jaspers, Hans-Georg Gadamer, and Jürgen Habermas {{served as}} {{university}} professors, as did also the pioneering scientists Hermann von Helmholtz, Robert Wilhelm <b>Bunsen,</b> Gustav Robert Kirchhoff, Emil Kraepelin, {{the founder of}} scientific psychiatry, and outstanding social scientists such as Max Weber, the founding father of modern sociology.|$|E
25|$|In November 1914, the British had {{occupied}} Basra. According {{to the report}} of the de <b>Bunsen</b> Committee, British interests in Mesopotamia were defined by the need to protect the western flank of India and protect commercial interests including oil. The British also became concerned about the Berlin-Baghdad Railway. Although never ratified, the British had also initialled the Anglo-Ottoman Convention of 1913.|$|E
25|$|The Muppet Mobile Lab is a free-roving, audio-animatronic {{entertainment}} attraction {{designed by}} Walt Disney Imagineering. Two Muppet characters, Dr. <b>Bunsen</b> Honeydew and his assistant, Beaker, pilot the vehicle through the park, interacting with guests and deploying special effects such as foggers, ﬂashing lights, moving signs, confetti cannons and spray jets. It is currently deployed at Hong Kong Disneyland in Hong Kong.|$|E
25|$|Flaming {{is done to}} {{loops and}} straight-wires in {{microbiology}} labs. Leaving the loop in the flame of a <b>Bunsen</b> burner or alcohol lamp until it glows red ensures that any infectious agent is inactivated. This is commonly used for small metal or glass objects, but not for large objects (see Incineration below). However, during the initial heating infectious material may be sprayed from the wire surface before it is killed, contaminating nearby surfaces and objects. Therefore, special heaters have been developed that surround the inoculating loop with a heated cage, ensuring that such sprayed material does not further contaminate the area. Another problem is that gas flames may leave carbon or other residues on the object if the object is not heated enough. A variation on flaming is to dip the object in 70% or higher ethanol, then briefly touch the object to a <b>Bunsen</b> burner flame. The ethanol will ignite and burn off rapidly, leaving less residue than a gas flame.|$|E
25|$|The {{report of}} the De <b>Bunsen</b> Committee, {{prepared}} to determine British wartime policy toward the Ottoman Empire, and submitted in June 1915, concluded that, in case of the partition or zones of influence options, {{there should be a}} British sphere of influence that included Palestine while accepting that there were relevant French and Russian as well as Islamic interests in Jerusalem and the Holy Places.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to their main presence at Disney's Hollywood Studios, the Muppets also appear in Great Moments in American History, a live show at the Magic Kingdom and the Muppet Mobile Lab at Epcot. The latter attraction is a free-roving vehicle with audio-animatronics of <b>Bunsen</b> Honeydew and Beaker. As part of Disney's Living Character Initiative, it premiered in 2007 at Epcot and was later previewed at Disney California Adventure and Hong Kong Disneyland.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to French initiatives, the United Kingdom established the de <b>Bunsen</b> Committee in 1915 {{to consider the}} nature of British objectives in Turkey and Asia {{in the event of}} a successful conclusion of the war.

25|$|In the 19th century, some {{scholars}} began to perceive similarities between Buddhist and Christian practices, e.g. in 1878 T.W. Rhys Davids {{wrote that the}} earliest missionaries to Tibet observed that similarities have been seen since the first known contact. In 1880 Ernest De <b>Bunsen</b> made similar observations in that {{with the exception of}} the death of Jesus on the cross, and of the Christian doctrine of atonement, the most ancient Buddhist records had similarities with the Christian traditions.|$|E
25|$|In 1869 at age 25, {{thanks to}} a letter of {{recommendation}} written by Stefan, he was appointed full Professor of Mathematical Physics at the University of Graz {{in the province of}} Styria. In 1869 he spent several months in Heidelberg working with Robert <b>Bunsen</b> and Leo Königsberger and in 1871 with Gustav Kirchhoff and Hermann von Helmholtz in Berlin. In 1873 Boltzmann joined the University of Vienna as Professor of Mathematics and there he stayed until 1876.|$|E
25|$|In {{the middle}} of the 19th century {{spectral}} analysis was developed by Gustav Kirchhoff and Robert <b>Bunsen.</b> It enabled the acquisition of information on the physical parameters and chemical abundances of stars, by the spectral analysis of their light. Foerster recognized these possibilities and initiated the building of a solar observatory in 1871 as a memorial to the crown prince, in which he emphasized the importance and profit of solar research. This idea was soon extended to the whole of astrophysics.|$|E
25|$|Atoms of {{different}} elements have distinct spectra and therefore atomic spectroscopy {{allows for the}} identification and quantitation of a sample's elemental composition. Robert <b>Bunsen</b> and Gustav Kirchhoff discovered new elements by observing their emission spectra. Atomic absorption lines are observed in the solar spectrum and referred to as Fraunhofer lines after their discoverer. A comprehensive explanation of the hydrogen spectrum was an early success of quantum mechanics and explained the Lamb shift observed in the hydrogen spectrum, which further {{led to the development}} of quantum electrodynamics.|$|E
25|$|Newton used a prism {{to split}} white light into a {{spectrum}} of color, and Fraunhofer's high-quality prisms allowed scientists to see dark lines of an unknown origin. In the 1850s, Gustav Kirchhoff and Robert <b>Bunsen</b> described the phenomena behind these dark lines. Hot solid objects produce light with a continuous spectrum, hot gasses emit light at specific wavelengths, and hot solid objects surrounded by cooler gasses show a near-continuous spectrum with dark lines corresponding to the emission lines of the gasses. By comparing the absorption lines of the sun with emission spectra of known gasses, the chemical composition of stars can be determined.|$|E
25|$|From 1 March 1864 until 31 August 1865, Captain Thomas {{measured}} sea temperatures {{from the}} Chain Pier. The data supported {{the acceptance of}} the Gulf Stream as a mechanism to explain the warmer seas around Scotland, especially in the west. In 1869, as an experiment into using electric light for lighthouses, Thomas Stevenson had an underwater cable installed from the eastern breakwater of Granton harbour. An operator on the harbour wall, with a switch and a <b>Bunsen</b> cell (an early form of battery), controlled a light {{on the end of the}} Chain Pier from half a mile (800 m) away.|$|E
25|$|Gassing is {{the process}} of passing yarn, as {{distinct}} from fabric very rapidly through a series of <b>Bunsen</b> gas flames in a gassing frame, in order to burn off the projecting fibres and make the thread round and smooth and also brighter. Only the better qualities of yarn are gassed, such as that used for voiles, poplins, venetians, gabardines, many Egyptian qualities, etc. There is a loss of weight in gassing, which varies' about 5 to 8 per cent., so that if a 2/60's yarn is required 2/56's would be used. The gassed yarn is darker in shade afterwards, but should not be scorched.|$|E
25|$|The {{university}} has a rich German heritage. The Owens College Extension Movement based their plans after {{a tour of}} mainly German universities and polytechnics. Manchester mill owner, Thomas Ashton, chairman of the extension movement had studied at Heidelberg University. Sir Henry Roscoe also studied at Heidelberg under Robert <b>Bunsen</b> and they collaborated for many years on research projects. Roscoe promoted the German style of research led teaching that became the role model for the redbrick universities. Charles Beyer studied at Dresden Academy Polytechnic. There were many Germans on the staff, including Carl Schorlemmer, Britain's first chair in organic chemistry, and Arthur Schuster, professor of Physics. There was even a German chapel on the campus.|$|E
25|$|Originally, the gauze was heated with a <b>Bunsen</b> burner; later, a wire grid was heated electrically. The heat {{transferred}} to {{the air in the}} tube sets it into near half-wave resonance if the gauze is placed below the midpoint of the tube as shown in the figure on the right. There is no theoretically optimum position, as the wave speed upward is c0+u, the convection speed, while the wave speed downward is c0−u. Without a convection flow, the midpoint and the lower tube end are the best locations for heat transfer. With convection, a compromise position halfway between the two points is normally chosen which depends on the amount of heat added. One characteristic length associated with frequency is tube length L.|$|E
25|$|In 1984, while Ghiorso {{was at the}} University of Washington, he {{received}} a Presidential Young Investigator Award, a research grant for an amount of $245,918, from the National Science Foundation. For a paper published in Computers & Geosciences, {{he received}} the Best Paper Award from its publisher, the International Association for Mathematical Geosciences. He was elected Fellow of the Mineralogical Society of America in 1993, the Geological Society of America in 1997, and the American Geophysical Union in 1999. The Mineralogical Society of America made him a Distinguished Lecturer for 19961997, elected him Councilor for 19972001, and awarded him the Dana Medal in 2003. He received the <b>Bunsen</b> Medal from the European Geosciences Union in 2010 and the Norman L. Bowen Award from the VGP Section of the American Geophysical Union in 2014.|$|E
25|$|Among the Masoretic {{creation}} estimates or calculations for {{the date}} of creation Ussher's specific chronology dating the creation to 4004 BC became the most accepted and popular, mainly because this specific date {{was attached to the}} King James Bible. The youngest ever recorded date of creation within the historic Jewish or Christian traditions is 3616 BC, by Yom-Tov Lipmann Heller in the 17th century while the oldest proposed date was 6984 BC by Alfonso X of Castile. However some contemporary or more recent proponents of Young Earth Creationism have taken this figure back further by several thousands of years by proposing significant gaps in the genealogies in chapters 5 and 11 of the Book of Genesis. Harold Camping for example dated the creation to 11,013 BC, while Christian Charles Josias <b>Bunsen</b> in the 19th century dated the creation to 20,000 BC.|$|E
25|$|Among {{historical}} scientific {{achievements of}} Heidelberg researchers features prominently {{the invention of}} spectroscopy, and of the <b>Bunsen</b> burner; the discovery of chemical elements Caesium and Rubidium; {{the identification of the}} absolute point of ebullition; and the identification and isolation of nicotine as the main pharmacologically active component of tobacco. Modern scientific psychiatry; psychopharmacology; psychiatric genetics; environmental physics; and modern sociology were introduced as scientific disciplines by Heidelberg faculty. Almost 800 dwarf planets, the North America Nebula, and the return of Halley's Comet have been discovered and documented at institutes of the Heidelberg Center for Astronomy. Moreover, Heidelberg researchers invented the process of plastination to preserve body tissue, conducted the first successful transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells, and recently developed a new strategy for a vaccination against certain forms of cancer, which earned Professor Harald zur Hausen of the university the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2008.|$|E
25|$|Another type plating out organisms, next to streaking, on {{agar plates}} is the spot {{analysis}}. This type of analysis {{is often used}} to check the viability of cells and performed with pinners (often also called froggers). A third used technique is the use of sterile, glass, beads to plate out cells. In this technique cells are grown in a liquid culture of which a small volume is pipetted on the agar plate and then spread out with the sterile, glass beads. Replicate plating is another technique in order to plate out cells on agar plates. These four techniques are the most used ones, but others are also possible. It is crucial to work in a sterile manner in order to prevent contamination on the agar plates. Plating is thus often done in a laminar flow cabinet or on the working bench next to a <b>bunsen</b> burner.|$|E
25|$|A {{wet cell}} battery has a liquid electrolyte. Other names are flooded cell, since the liquid covers all {{internal}} parts, or vented cell, since gases produced during operation can {{escape to the}} air. Wet cells were a precursor to dry cells and are commonly used as a learning tool for electrochemistry. They can be built with common laboratory supplies, such as beakers, for demonstrations of how electrochemical cells work. A particular type of wet cell known as a concentration cell is important in understanding corrosion. Wet cells may be primary cells (non-rechargeable) or secondary cells (rechargeable). Originally, all practical primary batteries such as the Daniell cell were built as open-top glass jar wet cells. Other primary wet cells are the Leclanche cell, Grove cell, <b>Bunsen</b> cell, Chromic acid cell, Clark cell, and Weston cell. The Leclanche cell chemistry was adapted to the first dry cells. Wet cells are still used in automobile batteries and in industry for standby power for switchgear, telecommunication or large uninterruptible power supplies, but in many places batteries with gel cells have been used instead. These applications commonly use lead–acid or nickel–cadmium cells.|$|E

500|$|Rubidium {{is a minor}} {{component}} in lepidolite. Kirchhoff and <b>Bunsen</b> processed 150kg of a lepidolite containing only 0.24% rubidium oxide (Rb2O). Both potassium and rubidium form insoluble salts with chloroplatinic acid, but those salts show a slight difference in solubility in hot water. Therefore, the less-soluble rubidium hexachloroplatinate (Rb2PtCl6) could be obtained by fractional crystallization. After reduction of the hexachloroplatinate with hydrogen, the process yielded 0.51grams of rubidium chloride for further studies. <b>Bunsen</b> and Kirchhoff began their first large-scale isolation of caesium and rubidium compounds with [...] of mineral water, which yielded 7.3grams of caesium chloride and 9.2grams of rubidium chloride. Rubidium was the second element, shortly after caesium, to be discovered by spectroscopy, just {{one year after the}} invention of the spectroscope by <b>Bunsen</b> and Kirchhoff.|$|E
