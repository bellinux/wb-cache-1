Polk Street contains many of the city's historic downtown buildings and homes. The large historic homes on this street were built close to downtown, and homes were located {{on the west side of}} the street as a symbol of status <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> be greeted with the sunrise every morning.|$|E
5|$|Brooker {{had other}} ideas that {{were removed from}} the {{original}} script <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> be complicated to do. He said he could use these ideas in a sequel story which would involve the main character finding messages that she had left for herself on previous days as the process of erasing her mind starts to not function. However, as the location for the episode no longer exists, he felt it would be more practical to create a graphic novel instead of recreating the scenario.|$|E
5|$|Early on {{the morning}} of September 11, 2001, 19 hijackers took control of four {{commercial}} airliners (two Boeing 757 and two Boeing 767) en route to California (three headed to LAX in Los Angeles, and one to SFO in San Francisco) after takeoffs from Logan International Airport in Boston, Massachusetts; Newark Liberty International Airport in Newark, New Jersey; and Washington Dulles International Airport in Loudoun and Fairfax counties in Virginia. Large planes with long flights were selected for hijacking <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> be heavily fueled.|$|E

50|$|During The Eliminator, Sting were {{watching}} {{and decided to}} choose Stevie and Savannah, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> thought <b>they</b> <b>would</b> be right for this challenge and Savannah hadn't played a challenge for a while. They chose Tyson and Suki to play Double Jeopardy for Claw <b>because</b> <b>they</b> thought Ollie <b>would</b> do well in this challenge.|$|R
50|$|It is {{said that}} both men cried when <b>they</b> parted ways, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> knew <b>they</b> <b>would</b> never see each other again. Torii's father and {{grandfather}} had served the Tokugawa before him and his own brother had already been killed in battle. Torii's actions {{changed the course of}} Japanese history. Ieyasu Tokugawa would successfully raise an army and win at Sekigahara.|$|R
5|$|Grimsby's ageing {{team made}} a bright start in 1952–53 with five {{straight}} wins but eventually slipped and finished in fifth place. In 1953–54, Shankly became disillusioned when the board {{could not give}} him money to buy new players. He was reluctant to promote some promising reserves because of loyalty to the older players (a fault that was to resurface at Liverpool years later) and he finally resigned in January 1954, citing the board's lack of ambition as his main reason. In his autobiography, {{he said that he}} and his wife were feeling homesick in Grimsby and, when an opportunity came to manage Workington, he was attracted to the challenge partly <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> be closer to Scotland.|$|E
5|$|James Spotila et al. (1991) {{concludes that}} the large body size of sauropods would have made them unable to {{maintain}} high metabolic rates <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> {{not have been able}} to release enough heat. They assumed sauropods had a reptilian respiratory system. Wedel says that an avian system would have allowed it to dump more heat. Some scientists state that the heart would have had trouble sustaining sufficient blood pressure to oxygenate the brain. Others suggest that the near-horizontal posture of the head and neck would have eliminated the problem of supplying blood to the brain because it would not have been elevated.|$|E
5|$|Marie St. Clare – Wife of Augustine, {{she is a}} self-absorbed woman {{without a}} hint of {{compassion}} for those around her, including her own family. Given to an unending list of (apparently imaginary) physical maladies, she continually complains about the lack of sympathy she is receiving. She has separated her personal maid, Mammy, from her own two children <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> interfere with her duties. As Marie drives Mammy to exhaustion, she criticizes her for selfishly seeking to attend her own family. Upon the unexpected death of Augustine, Marie countermands the legal process that would have given Tom his freedom.|$|E

25|$|Martin was so {{dedicated}} to the freeing of prisoners that when authorities, even emperors, heard he was coming, they refused to see him <b>because</b> <b>they</b> knew he <b>would</b> request mercy for someone and <b>they</b> <b>would</b> be unable to refuse.|$|R
60|$|Not all days, {{and only}} on rare days, is the surf heavy at Waikiki; and, {{in the days}} that followed, Ida and Lee Barton, much in {{evidence}} on the beach and in the water, continued to arouse disparaging interest in the breasts of the tourist ladies, although the Outrigger captains ceased from worrying about them in the water. <b>They</b> <b>would</b> watch the pair swim out and disappear in the blue distance, and they might, or might not, chance to see them return hours afterward. The point was that the captains did not bother about their returning, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> knew <b>they</b> <b>would</b> return.|$|R
5|$|On 26 March 2003, 954 {{soldiers}} of the 173d Airborne Brigade conducted a combat jump from C-17 aircraft onto Bashur Airfield in Northern Iraq {{under the command of}} Colonel Mayville. The jump took a total of 58seconds, though 32 paratroopers were unable to jump <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> have landed too far {{from the rest of the}} force. The force had been strung out over a 10,000-yard drop zone, and it took 15 hours before it was completely assembled. In the weeks before there had been heavy rain and the mud created problems for those doing the jump. The paratroopers secured the airfield, allowing the C-17s to land and bring in the heavy armor and the 1–63d Armor contingents. They jumped from aircraft of the 62d Airlift Wing and the 728th Airlift Squadron, along with an element of USAF Airmen from the 786th Security Forces Squadron. Over the next 96 hours, the wing landed in the remaining 1,200 {{soldiers of}} the brigade as well as their vehicles. By 29 March the entire brigade was in Iraq and ready to conduct offensive operations.|$|E
5|$|The Norwegian Competition Authority {{announced}} {{that since the}} new company would have all domestic scheduled services between primary airports, {{it was unlikely that}} the take-over would receive permission from them. However, it was stated that one solution could be that the companies discontinue their frequent flyer programs. On 20 August, the Competition Authority declared that SAS was not allowed to purchase Braathens; the ruling was appealed by SAS and Braathens. Analysts stated that Braathens could be bankrupt by the time the appeal was processed. The Competition Authority stated that their denial of the take-over was that the reduction of capacity would remove the airline's incentive to provide discounted tickets, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> not have to use them to capture travelers with lower willingness to pay from the competitor, and that they would not need low-paying customers to fill up the vacant seats. Instead, the authority wanted the politicians to reduce the taxes on flights. While Braathens also was opposed to the tax, they felt that removing it then was too late to save the company.|$|E
5|$|The {{assassination}} of Hanoi-based French labour recruiter Hervé Bazin on February 9, 1929, {{was a turning}} point that {{marked the beginning of the}} VNQDD's decline. A graduate of the École Coloniale in Paris, Bazin directed the recruitment of Vietnamese labourers to work on colonial plantations. Recruiting techniques often included beating or coercion, because the foremen who did the recruiting received a commission for each enlisted worker. On the plantations, living conditions were poor and the remuneration was low, leading to widespread indignation. In response, Vietnamese hatred of Bazin led to thoughts of an assassination. A group of workers approached the VNQDD with a proposal to kill Bazin. Học felt that assassinations were pointless <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> only prompt a crackdown by the French Sûreté, thereby weakening the party. He felt that it was better to strengthen the party until the time was ripe to overthrow the French, viewing Bazin as a mere twig on the tree of the colonial apparatus.|$|E

5000|$|The discussions {{convened in}} August 1746. Almost {{immediately}} {{they started to}} flounder, as it became apparent to both sides that the other was holding something back. France wanted to negotiate a treaty there and then, {{on behalf of their}} respective coalitions, but the British insisted that any settlement had to involve all parties. The British also rejected a French proposal to declare the Low Countries as [...] "neutral territory" [...] ending the war there <b>because</b> <b>they</b> believed <b>they</b> <b>would</b> need the Dutch as allies in future conflicts.|$|R
6000|$|The house ghost {{is usually}} a {{harmless}} and well-meaning creature. It is put up with as long as possible. It brings good luck to those who live with it. I remember two children who slept with their mother and sisters and brothers in one small room. In the room was also a ghost. They sold herrings in the Dublin streets, and did not mind the ghost much, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> knew <b>they</b> <b>would</b> always sell their fish easily while they slept in the [...] "ha'nted" [...] room.|$|R
5|$|At this point, Spielberg {{considered}} {{returning to}} direct the sequel. Over the Bicentennial weekend in 1976, Spielberg had hammered out a screenplay based on Quint's Indianapolis speech. Because of his contract for Close Encounters of the Third Kind, however, {{he would not be}} able to work on the film for a further year, a gap too long for the producers. Production designer Joe Alves (who would direct Jaws 3-D) and Verna Fields (who had been promoted to vice-president at Universal after her acclaimed editing on the first film) proposed that they co-direct it. The request was declined by the Directors Guild of America, partly <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> not allow a DGA member to be replaced by someone who was not one of its members, and partly because they, in the wake of events on the set of The Outlaw Josey Wales, had instituted a ban on any cast or crew members taking over as director during a film's production. The reins were eventually handed to Jeannot Szwarc, best known for the film Bug and whom Alves knew from working on the TV series Night Gallery. Szwarc recommenced production by filming the complicated waterskier scene, giving Gottlieb some time to complete the script. He reinstated the character of Deputy Hendricks, played by Jeffrey Kramer, who had been missing from the earlier script. Many of the teenagers were sacked, with the remaining roles developed.|$|E
5|$|During 1942–1943, Julia {{lived with}} her son at The Dairy Cottage, 120aAllerton Road, Woolton. The cottage was owned by Mimi's husband, and Mimi wanted Julia to live there <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> be closer to her house and also out of the Stanley house. As Alf was often away at sea, Julia started going out to dance halls. In 1942, she met a Welsh soldier named 'Taffy' Williams who was {{stationed}} in the barracks at Mossley Hill. Alf later blamed himself for this, as he had written letters telling her that {{because there was a}} war on, she should go out and enjoy herself. After an evening out, she would often give her young son a piece of chocolate or shortcrust pastry the next morning for breakfast. She became pregnant by Williams in late 1944, though first claiming that she had been raped by an unknown soldier. Williams refused to live with Julia— who was still married to Alf— until she gave up John, which she refused to do. When Alf eventually came home in 1944, he offered to look after his wife, their son, and the expected baby, but she rejected the idea.|$|E
5|$|In October 1939, {{conscription}} {{was introduced}} to keep the Militia at strength as its members volunteered for the AIF. From January 1940, all unmarried men turning 21 were required to report to be examined for potential service. While a substantial proportion of these men were granted exemptions on medical grounds or <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> suffer financial hardship if forced to enter the military, the remainder were liable for three months training followed by ongoing reserve service. A side effect of this arrangement {{was the creation of}} two different armies with different conditions of service, one the part-volunteer part-conscript Militia and the other the all-volunteer AIF. This situation resulted in administrative and structural problems that existed throughout the war, as well as a sometimes bitter professional rivalry between the men of the two forces. Later, provision was made to allow Militia units to transfer to the AIF if sufficient numbers of personnel volunteered to serve under AIF terms of service. This required 65 percent of a unit's war establishment—or 75 percent of its actual strength—to volunteer and allowed whole battalions {{to become part of the}} AIF.|$|E

5000|$|Blacks had {{initially}} been barred from military {{service in the}} Continental Army from November 12, 1775 until February 23, 1778.

As of 2015 some black students normally assigned to Cleveland High chose to enroll in East Side High because at East Side they had {{a better chance of}} joining sports teams and other extra curricular activities with limited spaces.

50|$|Firmly {{maintaining}} neutrality when World War I {{began in}} Europe in 1914, the United States helped supply the Allies, {{but could not}} ship anything to Germany because of the British blockade. Sympathies among many politically and culturally influential Americans had favored the British cause {{from the start of}} the war, as typified by industrialist Samuel Insull, born in London, who helped young Americans enlist in British or Canadian forces. On the other hand, especially in the Midwest, many Irish Americans and German Americans opposed any American involvement, the Irish <b>because</b> <b>they</b> hated the British, and the Germans <b>because</b> <b>they</b> feared <b>they</b> <b>would</b> come under personal attack. The suffragist movement included many pacifists, and most churches opposed the war.|$|R
25|$|It is {{generally}} agreed, the Lixos {{can be identified}} as the Draa (28°45’N). The Draa is the largest river in the area, and marks the southernmost limit of cultivable land. This well corresponds to Hanno's account. Certainly the area of Herne was known to the Carthaginians <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> hardly have sent a colony to an unknown place.|$|E
25|$|Nathalie Bardet {{published}} {{a discussion of}} the possible causes for the extinction of the ichthyosaurs. She expressed doubt that ichthyosaurs were replaced by mosasaurs <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> not be in direct competition with each other. Instead she posited a connection to an extinction event that affected cephalopods at the boundary between the Cenomanian and Turonian ages. She proposed that the disappearance of these many cephalopod species may have deprived ichthyosaurs of their food source and caused their extinction.|$|E
25|$|Route: From PSU to Tualatin via Tigard along {{dedicated}} lanes on Barbur Boulevard.

Proposals to serve Marquam Hill/OHSU, Hillsdale, and PCC Sylvania with tunnels were dropped from the plan <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> be costly, have severe construction impacts, and attract few new transit riders. Connecting OHSU to a surface transit line though elevators or escalators is being studied.|$|E

25|$|Although the {{uprising}} in Albayzín {{appeared to be}} put down and Granada was nominally transformed to a Christian city, the rebellion spread to the countryside. The leaders of the Albayzín uprising fled to the Alpujarra mountains. The inhabitants of the mountains, almost exclusively Muslims, had only accepted Christian rule reluctantly. They quickly rose up in revolts against what they regarded as the violation {{of the terms of}} the Treaty of Granada, and <b>because</b> <b>they</b> feared <b>they</b> <b>would</b> suffer the same forced conversions as the residents of Albayzín. By February 1500, eighty thousand Christian troops were mobilized to put down the rebellion. By March, King Ferdinand arrived to personally direct the operations.|$|R
