5|$|World War I saw great {{changes in}} the use of cavalry. The mode of warfare changed, and the use of trench warfare, <b>barbed</b> <b>wire</b> <b>and</b> machine guns {{rendered}} traditional cavalry almost obsolete. Tanks, introduced in 1917, began to take over the role of shock combat.|$|E
5|$|The {{village of}} Villy lies about one {{kilometer}} {{to the northwest}} of ouvrage La Ferté. Villy itself was fortified {{with more than a}} dozen blockhouses, along with networks of <b>barbed</b> <b>wire</b> <b>and</b> tank obstacles. The blockhouses were primarily prepared, reinforced firing positions and did not necessarily possess fixed armament.|$|E
5|$|Aware of {{the time}} constraints, Otway decided he could wait no longer, and the reduced {{battalion}} headed for the battery and joined up with Major Smith's reconnaissance party just outside the village of Gonneville en Auge. The reconnaissance party had cut a way through the <b>barbed</b> <b>wire,</b> <b>and</b> marked four routes through the minefield. Otway divided his men into four assault groups, and settled down to await {{the arrival of the}} three gliders.|$|E

5|$|Imaginative spectators {{would climb}} {{the church and}} watch a {{football}} game from the rooftop however they have now been deterred from doing so with the installation of security measures such as <b>barbed</b> <b>wire</b> <b>and</b> anti-climb paint. In addition, {{the introduction of the}} 'all-seater' ruling following the Taylor Report has meant that spectators no longer resort to climbing nearby buildings for a glimpse of the event as a seat is guaranteed with a purchased ticket.|$|E
5|$|From {{the time}} of the invasion, {{significant}} numbers of Belgian men had attempted to flee the occupied territories to join the Belgian army on the Yser front, via the Netherlands which were neutral. In order to stop this, the Germans began work on a <b>barbed</b> <b>wire</b> <b>and</b> electric fence across the length of the border. The fence, dubbed the Wire of Death (Dodendraad), was also guarded by German sentries. Between 2,000 and 3,000 civilians are believed to have been killed attempting to cross the border during the conflict.|$|E
5|$|The town escaped heavy bombing {{during the}} Second World War, but the sea front {{incurred}} great damage {{when it was}} fortified against invasion. The cast iron lampposts and benches along the front were removed and melted down for munitions, as was much of the superstructure from both Bournemouth and Boscombe piers before they were breached to prevent their use by enemy ships. The large amounts of <b>barbed</b> <b>wire</b> <b>and</b> anti-tank obstacles along the beach, and the mines {{at the foot of}} the chines, took two years to remove when peace was finally achieved.|$|E

5|$|While the Beatles were there, the Maharishi was {{negotiating}} with the Indian government to use some nearby parkland for an airstrip for a plane {{which he had been}} given; a deal which several thousand landless peasants objected to as they had been denied the use of the land for farming. The ashram was surrounded by <b>barbed</b> <b>wire</b> <b>and</b> the gates were kept locked and guarded. While the Maharishi kept the media away from his famous students, he himself gave interviews to the press.|$|E
5|$|According to a survivor, Nada Požega from Slavonia, the {{children}} were forced {{to go to church}} to pray, and were required to greet others with the Ustaše greeting Spremni (Ready) or the Nazi salute Heil Hitler. Those children that failed to do so were punished by the Ustaše guards with either a beating or solitary confinement. Požega further stated the nuns did not treat {{the children}} with sympathy or care. Another survivor, Mihajlo Veljić, recalled that the barracks were fenced with <b>barbed</b> <b>wire,</b> <b>and</b> that they slept on the floor covered with straw. He stated that the Ustaše tried to convert the children to Catholicism. He personally feared a nun, Sister Mercedes, but all the children feared Pulherija.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} years border fortifications inside the city mostly {{consisted}} of brick walls with a top made of barbed wire. Clay bricks and concrete slabs were used for construction. Further obstacles of <b>barbed</b> <b>wire</b> <b>and</b> upstate walls delimitated the East and at some places, like Bernauer Straße, bricked-up buildings formed the boundary line. The buildings were situated on East-Berlin territory, whereas the pavement {{in front of the}} houses belonged to West-Berlin. In many places safety installations of West-Berlin's outer ring consisted of metal fences and barbed wire barriers. Technologically advanced upgrading took place later on and only in 1975 L-shaped concrete segments that were known from the fall of the Wall were added.|$|E

5|$|In November 1943, Rommel took {{command of}} the German Army Group B in {{occupied}} France. He also {{took control of the}} Atlantic Wall defenses on the French coasts facing the United Kingdom and during a tour of anti-invasion fortifications Rommel concluded that the defenses would have to be improved, and quickly. He ordered millions of wooden tree trunks and logs to be set against airborne forces. <b>Barbed</b> <b>wire</b> <b>and</b> tripwires were to be strung between the poles. On plans that Rommel sent to his subordinates, the complete system of wooden poles and interconnecting wires was called Luftlandehindernis.|$|E
5|$|Indian cavalry {{participated in}} actions {{on both the}} Western and Palestinian fronts {{throughout}} the war. Members of the 1st and 2nd Indian Cavalry Divisions were active on the Western Front, including in the German retreat to the Hindenburg Line and at the Battle of Cambrai. A charge by the 5th (Mhow) Cavalry Brigade of the 1st Division ended successfully at the Battle of Cambrai despite being against a position fortified by <b>barbed</b> <b>wire</b> <b>and</b> machine guns. This successful ending was an unusual occurrence during the war. Several Indian cavalry divisions joined Allenby's troops {{in the spring of}} 1918 after being transferred from the Western Front.|$|E
5|$|Controversy {{continued}} to flare in Britain {{and other countries}} regarding sporting links with South Africa. The South Africa rugby team's 1969–70 tour of Britain and Ireland was accompanied by mass demonstrations against apartheid, including an attempt by a protester in London to hijack the South African team bus, and a demonstration in Dublin where people {{tried to stop the}} South Africans from reaching the match venue by lying {{down in the middle of}} the street. The South Africa cricket team was due to tour England shortly afterwards, and the MCC remained keen for the series to go ahead. They cancelled the tour a week before the South Africans were due to arrive, following public protests and pressure from the UK government. Virulent anti-apartheid demonstrations in Australia during the South Africa rugby team's 1971 tour led to soaring police costs, matches played behind fences and <b>barbed</b> <b>wire,</b> <b>and</b> a state of emergency in Queensland, all of which prompted the Australian Cricket Board to cancel the tour by the South Africa cricket team that had been scheduled to follow.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{reaching}} the Aisne River and encountering the trench system, cavalry was found ineffective. While cavalry divisions {{were still being}} formed in Britain, cavalry troops quickly became accustomed to fighting dismounted. Britain continued to use cavalry throughout the war, and in 1917, the Household Cavalry conducted its last mounted charge during a diversionary attack on the Hindenburg Line at Arras. On the orders of Field Marshal Douglas Haig, the Life Guards and the Blues, accompanied by {{the men of the}} 10th Hussars, charged into heavy machine gun fire and <b>barbed</b> <b>wire,</b> <b>and</b> were slaughtered by the German defenders; the Hussars lost two-thirds of their number in the charge. The last British fatality from enemy action before the armistice went into effect was a cavalryman, George Edwin Ellison, from C Troop 5th Royal Irish Lancers. Ellison was shot by a sniper as the regiment moved into Mons on November 11, 1918.|$|E
5|$|With {{the failure}} of the 3rd Battalion, 27th Infantry, to hold the high knob on Battle Mountain after its attacks on September 8 and 9, the 24th Infantry stopped trying to retake Battle Mountain. K Company, 24th Infantry, and C Company, 65th Engineer Combat Battalion, dug in on the hill east of and beneath Battle Mountain, {{fortified}} their position with <b>barbed</b> <b>wire</b> <b>and</b> mine fields, and placed registered artillery and mortar fires on all approaches to the position. The regimental commander planned to contain the North Koreans on Battle Mountain by artillery and mortar fire. The North Koreans on Battle Mountain attacked the lower American defensive position many times on subsequent nights, but all their attacks were driven off. After a month of almost constant battle the North Koreans gained and held possession of the crest of Battle Mountain. The defensive fires of the 24th Regiment and attached artillery, however, contained them there and they were unable to exploit the possession on the peak or attack further.|$|E
5|$|The British had {{determined}} the Tug Argan gap {{the best possible}} place to make a stand out of the three roadways, and also the most likely invasion route, and thus positioned {{the bulk of the}} army around it. On the British right, to the north of Tug Argan, were three companies of the 3/15 Punjab Regiment, set upon a group of west-facing strongpoints overlooking the rough wilderness that lay beside the road. South of them lay the gap itself, manned by a contingent of Rhodesian troops. They sat upon a line of small hills, named from north to south Black, Knobbly, Mill, Observation, and Castle Hills. These hills, positioned in a row with 2,000–2,500 yard gaps in between, housed machine-gun nests surrounded with light rings of <b>barbed</b> <b>wire</b> <b>and</b> served as the Rhodesians' defensive strongholds and the main defense for the British of the pass. On the British left were another group of Indian troops, located upon the aptly named 'Punjab Ridge' facing directly to the south. Unfortunately for the British, the front was too wide for the troops available, and the gaps between hills too large, leaving the defenses prone to infiltration. Also, due to the hills being in a single line, the position lacked depth. Meanwhile, De Simone, arriving {{at the site of the}} impending battle on 10 August, set his forces directly opposite the British positions. On the left, II Brigade prepared to advance through the wilderness towards the Punjab troops in the north. In the Italian center, XIV Brigade faced the Rhodesian hilltop positions within the pass, and XV Brigade looked north towards Punjab Ridge on the Italian right. Behind them were XIII Brigade and the armored vehicles.|$|E
