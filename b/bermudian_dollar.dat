50|$|The pound {{sterling}} remained the official currency of Bermuda until 1970, though the Government of Bermuda did issue its own pound banknotes. With U.S. and Canadian coins regularly appearing in circulation in Bermuda {{and the possibility}} of the devaluation of the {{pound sterling}}, Bermuda was compelled to adopt its own decimal currency. On 6 February 1970, Bermuda introduced a new decimal currency {{in the form of a}} dollar. The nascent Bermuda dollars circulated in conjunction with the new British decimal coinage a year before it was introduced in the United Kingdom. By adopting decimalisation early, Bermuda was also able place orders for the coinage from the Royal Mint before other Commonwealth countries seeking to decimalise could. The link between the <b>Bermudian</b> <b>dollar</b> and the pound sterling was not broken until 31 July 1972, which allowed Bermuda to align to a one-to-one exchange rate with that of the United States. The decision for Bermuda to peg its dollar to the U.S. dollar added convenience for the multitude of American tourists and businesses with whom Bermuda largely relied on.|$|E
