40|$|A {{simple and}} {{effective}} technique for the deposition of ciprofloxacin HCl salt onto pore coated Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy rods {{has been investigated}} {{for the prevention of}} infection in orthopedic applications. This technique involves the electrophoretic deposition of negatively charged ciprofloxacin particles as well as the precipitation of ciprofloxacin anions on positively <b>biased</b> <b>rods.</b> Experimental variables such as applied voltage, coating time, and pH of the antibiotic solution have been investigated in terms of the amount of deposited antibiotic, the morphology of antibiotic coating, the rate of release of deposited ciprofloxacin and the antibacterial activity of the coated samples against Staph aureus and Staph epidermidis...|$|R
40|$|Twenty-two normal {{right-handed}} subjects indicated {{with their}} index finger {{the midpoint of}} a horizontal rod {{that they could not}} see. Subjects performed this task while directing their gaze either centrally or toward four different locations (5 degrees or 30 degrees to the left or {{to the right of the}} midline). Results showed an overall leftward <b>bias</b> in <b>rod</b> bisection, which increased when subjects used their right hand and fixated a right-sided visual target. Thus, orienting of gaze can affect a nonvisual, tactilo-kinesthetic spatial task. The possible mechanisms of this interaction are discussed with respect to activation-orienting theories egocentric hypotheses and directional trends...|$|R
40|$|AbstractRod {{influence}} on hue discrimination {{was assessed by}} the Farnsworth–Munsell 100 -hue test. Rod influence was taken as the difference in error scores obtained after complete dark adaptation and during the cone plateau at three mesopic (23, 9, 3 td) and one standard (158 td) light level. On the FM 100, rods produced a differential discrimination loss along a tritan axis as compared with a red–green axis without any <b>bias</b> toward a <b>rod</b> confusion axis. Rods appear to impair discrimination mediated by S-cone pathways, which at moderate levels of illumination can differentially elevate tritan errors on the FM 100...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{efforts have}} been {{undertaken}} in the reevaluation of the delayed neutron group parameters, namely, the half-life periods and the delayed neutron fractions Indeed, 8 -group parameters are now proposed instead of the standard Tuttle 6 -group. Moreover, several laboratories among the nuclear engineering community are conducting researches to provide a standard set of group time constants that can suit a lot of fissile isotopes. Since, delayed neutron parameters are widely used in order to estimate reactivity by conducting dynamic experiments, it is worth investigating {{the influence of the}} group model (i. e. the number of groups and the number of fitted parameters) on reactivity estimates. This paper focuses on two issues. First, various sets of parameters obtained from JEFF- 3. 1 precursors data fits are compared. Using simulated rod drop transients, we discuss the uncertainty and bias on reactivity estimation. It is shown that the sets of parameters with fewer fitted parameters and with a greater number of groups give very satisfactory results. Second, the influence of the neutron spectrum is quantified. Biases up to 14 % are obtained. Standard statistical tests are done in order to identify such <b>biases</b> on <b>rod</b> drop reactivity estimate...|$|R
40|$|Microwave sheath-Voltage {{combination}} Plasma (MVP) is a {{high density}} plasma source {{and can be used}} as a suitable plasma processing device (e. g., ionized physical vapor deposition). In the present report, the temporal behavior of an argon MVP sustained along a direct-current <b>biased</b> Ti <b>rod</b> is investigated. Two plasma modes are observed, one is an "oxidized state" (OS) at the early time of the microwave plasma and the other is "ionized sputter state" (ISS) at the later times. Transition of the plasma from OS to ISS, results a prominent change in the visible color of the plasma, resulting from a significant increase in the plasma density, as measured by a Langmuir probe. In the OS, plasma is dominated by Ar ions and the density is order 10 ^ 11 cm^- 3. In the ISS, metal ions from the Ti rod contribute significantly to the ion composition and higher density plasma (10 ^ 12 cm^- 3) is produced. Nearly uniform high density plasma along the length of the Ti rod is produced at very low input microwave powers (around 30 W). Optical emission spectroscopy measurements confirm the presence of sputtered Ti ions and Ti neutrals in the ISS.

40|$|Fringing {{field effect}} on a {{circular}} quadrupole mass filter with a pre-rod is studied using computer simulation, to investigate the mechanism of formation of undesired mass peak shapes such as precursor peaks and peak separations. Some fringing filed effect functions are given not only for quadrupole potential between an aperture and a pre-rod, but also for <b>rod</b> <b>bias</b> and DC potential bias voltage between the pre-rod and main rod. Peak profiles are calculated for a relative low mass number, 69 and mass resolution of about 100. The result for this case shows no peak separation and no precursor peaks when the fringing field functions derived potential filed calculations are used. The peak height depends on the aperture-rod distance. And some precursor peaks and a peak separation are observed when the fringing field function is deformed to loosen the slope. This means precursor peaks and peak separations may appear depending on fringing field distribution, even if the main rod is assembled exactly...|$|R
40|$|In SINP-TOKAMAK [an iron-core device having major radius = 30 cm, minor radius = 7. 5 cm and B(toroidal) = 2 Tesla(maximum) ] both high/normal q {{and very}} low q (VLQ) regimes can be achieved. Recently in this machine fast edge biasing {{experiment}} in the later regime revealed a change in plasma current profile at edge region leading to better confinement and longer duration of plasma current. The continuation of the same experiment is done in high/normal q regime. For this purpose, as before, a tungsten electrode assembly with 6 mm diameter <b>rod,</b> <b>biased</b> by a pulsed power supply, is introduced in {{the edge of the}} plasma. Preliminary analysis of data reveals similar observations even in this highq regime, namely, the current profile modification obtained by biasing has more pronounced effects compared to those in the very low q regime experiment. The current duration increases from about 9 msec to about 13 msec, i. e. by more 40 %. Under certain conditions the peak plasma current sometimes increases. The electrode current drawn in this regime is comparatively much lower than that in the VLQ case, but this is as expected since toroidal magnetic field is much higher in this regime. Lowering of H signal and loop voltage is also observed which indicates better confinement. 1...|$|R
40|$|This {{invention}} {{relates to}} a preload release mechanism comprising a preload spring assembly adapted {{to apply a}} preload to a first connector member which is mounted on a support structure and adapted for connection with a second connector member on an object. The assembly comprises telescoped bushings and a preload spring. A tubular shaft extends through the spring assembly and openings in the first connector member and support structure, on which it is clamped. A plunger rod in the shaft is provided with a tip end and a recess in the rod near the other end thereof. A retainer precludes passage of the rod through the shaft {{in one direction and}} an end cap closes the bore of the shaft at the other end and provides a shoulder which extends radially of the shaft. A plunger return spring <b>biases</b> the plunger <b>rod</b> against the plunger retainer with the plunger tip protruding from the shaft and a spring assembly return spring engages at its ends the shoulder of the end cap and one end of the spring assembly. Detents received in lateral openings in the tubular shaft are held captive by the plunger rod and one end of the spring assembly to lock the spring assembly on the tubular shaft and apply a preload to the first connector member. Upon completion of the connection, detents and spring assembly are released by plunger contact with the object to be connected, thereby releasing the preload while the connection is maintained...|$|R
40|$|In the rod {{and frame}} test (RFT), {{participants}} {{are asked to}} set a tilted visual linear marker (i. e. a rod), embedded in a square, to the subjective vertical, irrespective of the surrounding frame. People not influenced by the frame tilt are defined as field-independent, while people <b>biased</b> in their <b>rod</b> verticality perception are field-dependent. Performing RFT requires the integration of proprioceptive, vestibular and visual signals with the latter accounting for field-dependency. Studies indicate that motor experts in body-related, balance-improving disciplines tend to be field-independent, i. e. better at verticality perception, suggesting that proprioceptive and vestibular expertise acquired by such exercise may weaken the influence of irrelevant visual signals. What remains unknown is whether the effect of body-related expertise in weighting perceptual information might also be mediated by personality traits, in particular those indexing self-focusing abilities. To explore this issue, we tested field-dependency {{in a class of}} body experts, namely yoga practitioners and in non-expert participants. Moreover we explored any link between performance on RFT and self-transcendence, a complex personality construct, which refers to tendency to experience spiritual feelings and ideas. As expected, yoga practitioners (i) were more accurate in assessing the rod’s verticality on the RFT, and (ii) expressed significantly higher self-transcendence. Interestingly, the performance in these two tests was negatively correlated. More specifically, when asked to provide verticality judgments, highly self-transcendent yoga practitioners were significantly less influenced by a misleading visual context. Our results suggest that being highly self-transcendent may enable yoga practitioners to optimize verticality judgment tasks by relying more on internal (vestibular and proprioceptive) signals coming from their own body, rather than on exteroceptive, visual cues...|$|R
40|$|Pseudoneglect is the {{tendency}} to be biased towards {{the left side of}} space in tasks of a spatial nature. A non-visual form of the bias referred to as ‘representational pseudoneglect’ has been observed when people generate a mental representation of a stimulus in the complete absence of visual input - participants {{pay more attention to the}} left-hand side of the mental representation. The aim of this thesis was to advance our understanding of representational pseudoneglect by exploring the bias across lifespan using different modes of non-visual presentation (touch vs. audition vs. visual imagery). In Experiments 1 and 2 healthy participants aged 3 to 96 years used touch alone without vision to bisect wooden rods at the perceived centre. All participants (with the exception of some adolescents) showed leftward <b>biases</b> on tactile <b>rod</b> bisection and significant gender and age effects were found. In Experiments 3 to 10 healthy young adults listened to aural-verbal descriptions of abstract patterns or real-world scenes without vision and formed a mental representation of the spatial layout that was described. A leftward bias was consistently found for a relative judgement task along with a significant effect of monaural presentation and start side, but no lateralised bias for memory recall regardless of ‘mental mapping’ ability or method of response. In Experiment 11 participants eye movements were recorded while they visually processed and then memorised natural real-world scenes; again there was no lateralised memory or eye movement bias. Experiment 12 showed that a secondary task increased the magnitude of visuo-spatial pseudoneglect for children and adults under certain conditions. This thesis argues that purely representational forms of pseudoneglect clearly exist in healthy participants and that: 1) the results can be explained in terms of contralateral attentional orienting by the right hemisphere, 2) extraneous variables (gender; physical or imagined starting position) can mediate representational pseudoneglect, and 3) current models of cognitive ageing need to provide for a cognitive bias that can be enhanced by age.
