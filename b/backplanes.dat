25|$|When {{the board}} has no {{embedded}} components it is more correctly called a printed wiring board (PWB) or etched wiring board. However, the term printed wiring board has fallen into disuse. A PCB populated with electronic components is called a printed circuit assembly (PCA), {{printed circuit board assembly}} or PCB assembly (PCBA). The IPC preferred term for assembled boards is circuit card assembly (CCA), and for assembled <b>backplanes</b> it is backplane assemblies. The term PCB is used informally both for bare and assembled boards.|$|E

30|$|Thin film {{transistor}} (TFT) <b>backplane</b> {{with higher}} resolution and larger panel size is highly desired {{in the flat}} plane display industry. Semiconductor material with a high electron mobility is crucial to improve the performance of TFT <b>backplane.</b> In particular, a metal oxide semiconductor-based TFT <b>backplane</b> is considered as a promising candidate to overcome the limitation of silicon-based TFT <b>backplane</b> in terms of mechanical flexibility and electron mobility [1 – 4]. Although a metal oxide semiconductor-based TFT <b>backplane</b> shows promising properties, the process method with a low-cost process for both large-scale deposition for industrial application is still needed [5].|$|R
50|$|The <b>backplane</b> is {{constructed}} out of graphite composite, titanium, and invar. Invar is an iron-nickel alloy {{with a low}} {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} (CTE or α) which means it does not change size much during temperature changes. One of the important features of the <b>backplane</b> is that it is thermally stable at low temperatures, because it is holding the main mirror, it must change size less than one-ten-thousandth of a human hair (32 nm) at -400 degrees F (-240 C). Another test of the <b>backplane</b> design was the <b>Backplane</b> Structure Test Article, which was a one sixth portion of the full <b>backplane.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} and performance {{requirements of a}} <b>backplane</b> will define its physical layout and size. When the minimum physical structure requirements are known, the form factor can be selected. Application and performance requirements also help the designer decide if the <b>backplane</b> will be a full custom design, a completely packaged protocol, or some point in between. Performance requirements will also define minimum requirements for chassis or cage, card selection, and <b>backplane</b> connectors. The cage or chassis is the physical support system used to secure cards to the <b>backplane.</b> Connectors join the cards physically and electrically to the <b>backplane.</b> The card size selected will determine the spacing between cards and overall size of the <b>backplane.</b> Therefore, card size has a direct effect on <b>backplane</b> performance. The type of connector used can affect signal integrity because connectors have capacitance, increased rise time and flight time, increased noise (EMI and cross-talk), and effects on power consumption...|$|R

50|$|This line {{is used by}} the <b>backplane</b> and {{indicates}} some condition on the <b>backplane</b> back to the HBA. The first bit being high commonly {{indicates the}} presence of a drive. The two following bits are typically unused, and driven low. Because this line would be high for all 3 bits when no <b>backplane</b> is connected, an HBA can detect the presence of a <b>backplane</b> by the second or third bit of the SDataIn being driven low.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} decisions that a <b>backplane</b> designer makes when defining system performance is the selection of the driver integrated circuit (IC) or IC input/output (I/O) technology. To achieve a high level of signal integrity, the physical <b>backplane</b> must be designed with specific signal behavior in mind. The physical <b>backplane</b> includes, but is not limited to, the number of loads, the number of outputs switching, and the termination type. Signal behavior refers to characteristics such as frequency, static and dynamic drive, edge rate, and incident wave or reflected-wave switching. Although <b>backplane</b> design as a whole determines signal behavior, the choice of driver technology affects the behavior of the signals traveling the <b>backplane</b> and the upper performance limit of these signals. Driver technology defines the maximum parameters for dynamic switching current, static current, edge rate, and frequency. Although the <b>backplane</b> design can be tuned to take advantage of these parameters, or designed for more conservative operation, the driver technology defines the upper limits. Because of driver technology’s impact on the system as a whole, understanding <b>backplane</b> requirements and the role driver ICs play in signal behavior and <b>backplane</b> functioning are critical when selecting a driver IC...|$|R
