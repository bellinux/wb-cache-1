25|$|In 1996, {{funding was}} {{approved}} for the upgrading {{of the two}} major alpine rail crossings, the Gotthard Railway, including the 57km long Gotthard <b>Base</b> <b>Tunnel</b> and the Lötschberg <b>Base</b> <b>Tunnel</b> on the approach to the Simplon Tunnel. The Lötschberg <b>Base</b> <b>Tunnel</b> was opened in 2007, but most of its second line has been indefinitely deferred. The Gotthard <b>Base</b> <b>Tunnel</b> was finally opened in 2016, after nearly two decades of work, making high-speed travel below the Alps a reality. Further south, on the Gotthard axis, the Ceneri <b>Base</b> <b>Tunnel</b> is slated to open in 2020.|$|E
25|$|The Gotthard <b>Base</b> <b>Tunnel</b> {{opened in}} 2016, and the Ceneri <b>Base</b> <b>Tunnel</b> is now {{set to open}} in 2020. After they have opened, all rail traffic will still {{need to use the}} {{existing}} route north of Erstfeld, between Biasca and Bellinzona, and south of Lugano. The bypassed sections of the existing route will be retained for local passenger services, for general capacity and as a diversionary route.|$|E

50|$|Original {{plans for}} the NRLA {{included}} the construction of {{only one of the}} main <b>base</b> <b>tunnels.</b> Since no decision could be made and regional dispute threatened to put the entire project in danger, the Swiss Federal Council decided in 1995 to build both <b>base</b> <b>tunnels,</b> Gotthard and Lötschberg, simultaneously.|$|R

25|$|The {{approaches}} to the existing tunnel continue to restrict speed and capacity on this important international route, and in 1992 {{it was decided to}} build a new lower level route on the Gotthard axis as part of the NRLA project. This route involves the construction of the new Gotthard <b>Base</b> <b>Tunnel</b> and Ceneri <b>Base</b> <b>Tunnel,</b> and it will be integrated with the existing route once completed, with some sections of the two routes in common.|$|E
25|$|In 1998 {{the total}} {{projected}} {{cost of the}} NRLA project was CHF12.189billion; as of December 2015, the final cost is projected as CHF17.900billion. The 1998 projected {{total cost of the}} centrepiece, the Gotthard <b>Base</b> <b>Tunnel,</b> was CHF6.323billion; as of December 2015, the final cost is projected as CHF9.560billion. It opened on 1 June 2016 and became operational on 11 December 2016, and the Ceneri <b>Base</b> <b>Tunnel</b> is scheduled to become operational in 2020.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} solve the general exist {{problems}} of visual <b>based</b> <b>tunnel</b> disease inspection such as low level of automation and intelligence, using a high cost performance tunnel disease inspection device to have high precision automatic analysis and evaluation {{on the face of}} tunnel across time and space, the article designed a disease inspection technology for the whole section of tunnel. First designed a Panoramic visual sensor which can fast access the panoramic image of the whole tunnel section, and then through digital image processing technology, have high-precision automatic analysis and assessment on tunnel panoramic images, identification and classification on diseases, and provide metadata support to the analysis of the dynamic change of the developing tunnel disease across time and space. The experimental results showed that the visual <b>based</b> <b>tunnel</b> disease inspection can accurately and quickly search the tunnel diseases, automatically detect and have judgments and assessment on various defects exist in tunnel...|$|R
50|$|The <b>base</b> <b>tunnels</b> {{take the}} {{opposite}} approach, eliminating, or at least, minimizing gradients and eliminating curves with {{the consequence of}} having longer tunnels on a route, but shorter total distances to travel, allowing higher speeds and lower energy costs. Usually, there is an already existing culmination tunnel, {{and it would not}} have been possible or reasonable to build a tunnel at an even lower altitude.|$|R
50|$|The {{construction}} costs quickly escalated {{due to the}} difficult geological conditions and, in the end, exceeded 300 million Francs. The political fighting surrounding the cost overruns {{are said to have}} contributed to Roger Bonvin's ill health {{toward the end of the}} project and he died just before its opening in 1982. A plaque commemorating Roger Bonvin is installed as the <b>base</b> <b>tunnel's</b> entrance in Oberwald.|$|R
25|$|Further {{bypasses}} {{have been}} planned {{as part of}} the Gotthard axis of the NRLA project, including a new largely tunnelled route from Arth-Goldau to Erstfeld, and an extension of the existing Zimmerberg <b>Base</b> <b>Tunnel</b> on the route between Zürich and Zug. No commitment to construct these sections of line has yet been made.|$|E
25|$|Deutsche Bahn also {{considered}} a 24kilometre-long <b>base</b> <b>tunnel</b> for the {{crossing of the}} Thuringian Forest. This alternative was rejected {{on the grounds of}} high groundwater pressures (near aquifers), the need to pass below the target storage level of the Goldisthal Pumped Storage Station (together with additional sealing of the tunnel) and the need for much more elaborate safety measures.|$|E
25|$|As of 2016, the Gotthard <b>Base</b> <b>Tunnel</b> is {{the longest}} railway tunnel in the world. It is the third Swiss tunnel to bear this title, after the Gotthard Tunnel (15km, 1882) and the Simplon Tunnel (19.8km, 1905). It is the third tunnel built under the Gotthard, after the Gotthard Tunnel and the Gotthard Road Tunnel.|$|E
40|$|We {{observe the}} {{occurrence}} of an Efros-Shklovskii gap in (Ga,Mn) As <b>based</b> <b>tunnel</b> junctions. The occurrence of the gap {{is controlled by the}} extent of the hole wave-function on the Mn acceptor atoms. Using k. p-type calculations we show that this extent depends crucially on the direction of the magnetization in the (Ga,Mn) As (which has two almost equivalent easy axes). This implies one can reversibly tune the system into the insulating or metallic state by changing the magnetization...|$|R
50|$|Following renewed {{interest}} by private investors in 2012, the Federal Council decided to forgo construction {{for the time}} being, while leaving open {{the possibility of a}} similar project being implemented by a later generation. A government report stated that the Porta Alpina would have reduced the <b>base</b> <b>tunnel's</b> freight capacity (unless a passing loop would be built, at a large cost for additional tunneling) and would have been uneconomical to operate, requiring CHF 9 million of annual public subsidies.|$|R

Consequently, the calculated values in tunnel junctions are a good estimation of upper limits. In particular, spin-Seebeck coefficients of more than 100 μ V/K are possible. The MTEP ratio exceed several 1000...|$|R
25|$|On 8 November 2007, {{trainset}} 89, {{which had}} been shortened to about 200m, set a Swiss land speed record for railed vehicles during trial runs for the ETCS cab signalling inside the Lötschberg <b>Base</b> <b>Tunnel.</b> The trainset reached 288km/h. The trainset had a modified pantograph, {{but two of the}} eight traction motors had been disabled.|$|E
25|$|To address transalpine freight and {{passenger}} bottlenecks on its roads and railways, Switzerland launched the Rail2000 and NRLA projects. The first stage of the Rail2000 project finished in 2005, included a new high-speed rail track between Bern and Olten with an operating speed of 200km/h. The NRLA project is building faster north-south rail tracks across the Swiss Alps by constructing base tunnels several hundred metres {{below the level of}} the current tunnels. The 35km Lötschberg <b>Base</b> <b>Tunnel</b> opened in 2007 where New Pendolino trains run at 250km/h. The 57km Gotthard <b>Base</b> <b>Tunnel</b> (Top speed 250km/h) was opened in 2016. The second stage of Rail2000 includes line upgrades in canton Valais (200km/h) and between Biel/Bienne and Solothurn (200km/h). The start of work is planned for 2012–2016. However, the slow speed of lines between the NRLA tunnels (Ceneri, Gotthard Base and Zimmerberg to name but a few) means that the capacity of Zürich-Milan services will remain limited until the speeds can be increased, given the strong negative effect of mixed rail speeds on capacity.|$|E
25|$|The {{construction}} of tunnels shortened distances and improved gradients, allowing the improved handling of traffic growth. The Simplon tunnel between Brig and Iselle, Italy, was opened in 1906. The Mont-d'Or tunnel was opened between Vallorbe and Frasne, France, in 1915 and formed {{part of the}} route of the Orient Express between Paris and Istanbul from 1919 to 1962. The Hauenstein <b>base</b> <b>tunnel</b> was opened between Olten and Basel in 1916.|$|E
40|$|A {{multilayer}} edge {{molecular electronics}} device (MEMED), which utilize the two metal electrodes of a metal-insulator-metal tunnel junction {{as the two}} electrical leads to molecular channels, can overcome the long standing fabrication challenges for developing futuristic molecular devices. However, producing ultrathin insulator is the most challenging step in MEMED fabrication. A simplified molecular device approach was developed by avoiding the need of depositing a new materiel on the bottom electrode for growing ultrathin insulator. This paper discuss the approach for MEMED's insulator growth by one-step oxidation of a tantalum (Ta) bottom electrode, in the pholithographically defined region; i. e. ultrathin tantalum oxide (TaOx) insulator was grown by oxidizing bottom metal electrode itself. Organometallic molecular clusters (OMCs) were bridged across 1 - 3 nm TaOx along the perimeter of a tunnel junction to establish the highly efficient molecular conduction channels. OMC transformed the asymmetric transport profile of TaOx <b>based</b> <b>tunnel</b> junction into symmetric one. A TaOx <b>based</b> <b>tunnel</b> junction with top ferromagnetic (NiFe) electrode exhibited the transient current suppression by several orders. Further studies {{will be needed to}} strengthen the current suppression phenomenon, and to realize the full potential of TaOx based multilayer edge molecular spintronics devices.

40|$|On an {{ab initio}} level, we {{investigate}} the recently observed magneto-Seebeck effect in MgO <b>based</b> <b>tunnel</b> junctions.

These results show a strong influence of the termination on the temperature dependence of the magneto-Seebeck effect. In addition, we use a simple model to account for randomly ordered alloys. We propose, that by a controlled treatment of the CoFe/MgO interface the magneto-Seebeck effect can be tuned experimentally...|$|R

50|$|Another novel spintronic effect, {{which was}} first {{observed}} in (Ga,Mn)As <b>based</b> <b>tunnel</b> devices, is tunnelling anisotropic magnetoresistance (TAMR). This effect {{arises from the}} intricate dependence of the tunnelling density of states on the magnetization, and can result in MRs of several orders of magnitude. This was demonstrated first in vertical tunnelling structuresand then later in lateral devices.This has established TAMR as a generic property of ferromagmetic tunnel structures. Similarly, the dependence of the single electron charging energy on the magnetization {{has resulted in the}} obersvation of another dramatic MR effect in a (Ga,Mn)As device, the so-called Coulomb blockade anisotropic magnetoresistance (CBAMR).|$|R
40|$|Exchange {{coupling}} {{between two}} magnetic layers through an interlayer is of broad interest for numerous recent applications of nano-magnetic systems. In this Letter we study ferromagnetic exchange coupling through amorphous paramagnetic Fe-Ta alloys.

Such materials are of high interest for the engineering of perpendicularly magnetized CoFeB-MgO <b>based</b> <b>tunnel</b> junctions as it enables ferromagnetic coupling of magnetic layers with differing crystalline lattices, suppresses dead layers and can act as an inter-diffusion barrier during annealing...|$|R
