50|$|It is {{important}} to understand however that this case and Sidebottom before it, established one of the two limbs of the modern day <b>bona</b> <b>fide</b> intentions test. The <b>bona</b> <b>fide</b> test comprises two tests. One objective (as this case and Sidebottom established) and one subjective test. Greenhalgh v Ardene Cinemas established the subjective limb of the <b>bona</b> <b>fide</b> test. The <b>bona</b> <b>fide</b> test is thus a hybrid of these two methods of assessment.|$|R

5000|$|The shelter rule is a {{doctrine}} {{in the common}} law of property under which a grantee who has received an interest in property from a <b>bona</b> <b>fide</b> purchaser will also be protected as a <b>bona</b> <b>fide</b> purchaser, even if the grantee would not legally qualify for this status. The grantee is [...] "sheltered" [...] from other claims by the grantor's status as an actual <b>bona</b> <b>fide</b> purchaser.|$|R

50|$|In American law, a <b>bona</b> <b>fide</b> {{purchaser}} who unknowingly {{purchases and}} subsequently sells stolen goods will, at common law, {{be held liable}} in trover for the full market value of those goods as of the date of conversion. Since the true owner retains legal title, the seller is liable even in a chain of successive <b>bona</b> <b>fide</b> purchasers (i.e., the true owner can successfully sue the fifth <b>bona</b> <b>fide</b> purchaser in trover). However, the problem of successive <b>bona</b> <b>fide</b> purchasers can be remedied: If the jurisdiction recognises an implied warranty that the seller has title to the property (Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) in the United States), then the <b>bona</b> <b>fide</b> purchaser can sue the seller for breach of that implied warranty. Courts of equity traditionally also recognise various other exceptions, likely giving rise to the idea embodied in the modern UCC.|$|R

50|$|The <b>bona</b> <b>fide</b> {{residence}} test, {{like the}} physical presence test, comprises {{one way that}} an individual can qualify for the foreign earned income exclusion. In order {{to qualify for the}} <b>bona</b> <b>fide</b> residence test, an individual needs to reside in a foreign country for an uninterrupted period that includes an entire tax year. In addition, the <b>bona</b> <b>fide</b> residence test takes into account factors such as the individual's intention, the purpose of the trip, and the length and nature of the stay. There are special deductions and exclusions that accompany this only if the individual is a U.S citizen or U.S resident Alien and has a tax treaty. The <b>bona</b> <b>fide</b> residence is not always the same as the domicile. The domicile is defined as one's permanent home.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Bona</b> <b>fides</b> is a Latin phrase meaning [...] "good faith". Its {{ablative}} case is <b>bona</b> <b>fide,</b> meaning [...] "in good faith", it {{is often}} used as an adjective to mean [...] "genuine". While today fides is concomitant to faith, a more technical translation of the Latin concept would be something like [...] "reliability", {{in the sense of}} a trust between two parties for the potentiality of a relationship. In ancient Rome <b>bona</b> <b>fides</b> was always assumed by both sides, had implied responsibilities, and both legal and religious consequences if broken. Fides was one of the original virtues to be considered a religious [...] "divinity" [...] in Roman paganism.|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} catalog of 908 objects {{observed}} with the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) in the vicinity fields of M 31 and M 33, targeted as globular clusters (GCs) and candidates. The targets include known GCs and candidates selected from the literature, {{as well as new}} candidates selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Analysis shows that 356 of them are likely GCs of various degree of confidence, while the remaining ones turn out to be background galaxies and quasars, stars and HII regions in M 31 or foreground Galactic stars. The 356 likely GCs include 298 <b>bona</b> <b>fide</b> GCs and 26 candidates known in the literature. Three candidates selected from the Revised Bologna Catalog of M 31 GCs and candidates (RBC) and one possible cluster from Johnson et al. are confirmed to be <b>bona</b> <b>fide</b> clusters. We search for new GCs in the halo of the M 31 amongst the new candidates selected from the SDSS photometry. Based on radial velocities yielded by LAMSOT spectra and visual examination of the SDSS images, we find 28 objects, 5 <b>bona</b> <b>fide</b> and 23 likely GCs. Amongst the five <b>bona</b> <b>fide</b> GCs, three have been recently discovered independently by others, the remaining 25 are our new identifications, including two <b>bona</b> <b>fide</b> ones. The new identified objects fall at projected distances ranging from 13 to 265 kpc from M 31. Of the two newly discovered <b>bona</b> <b>fide</b> GCs, one is located near M 33, probably a GC belonging to M 33. The other <b>bona</b> <b>fide</b> GC falls on the Giant Stream with a projected distance of 78 kpc from M 31. Of the 23 newly identified likely GCs, one has a projected distance of about 265 kpc from M 31 and could be an intergalactic cluster.
