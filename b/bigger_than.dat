5|$|Foxes can {{be found}} only at the fringes of jackal territory. Red foxes and golden jackals share similar diets, with the jackal being three times <b>bigger</b> <b>than</b> the red fox. The red fox will avoid close {{proximity}} with jackals, and fox populations decrease where jackals are abundant. Striped hyenas prey on golden jackals, and three jackal carcasses were found in one hyena den.|$|E

40|$|Amphibians are {{important}} and interesting group of animals. Salamandridae are wellknown group of caudate amphibians. In this group we find sexual size dimorphism in three forms: <b>bigger</b> female <b>than</b> male, <b>bigger</b> male <b>than</b> female, and no difference in size. This fact was the impetus for my bachelor thesis, which deals with sexual size dimorphism for this family. The aim of this work was to determine to what forms of sexual dimorphism of size are different types {{and how it can}} be related to other selected factors. For this group of amphibians is true {{that more than half of}} the individuals are <b>bigger</b> female <b>than</b> male, a quarter of individuals is no sexual size dimorphism and the rest no individuals are <b>bigger</b> male <b>than</b> female. Statistical analysis showed a significant relationship between sexual size dimorphism and sexual courtship and amplexus...|$|R

5|$|Dragon Quest II was remade for Japanese NTT DoCoMo brand {{cell phones}} in 2005. The remakes size was four times <b>bigger</b> <b>than</b> the {{original}} Dragon Quest port, and since phone capacity was limited, {{the game was}} divided into two parts. The first part was pre-installed in cell phones {{and the second part}} could be downloaded for free. The world map was provided by a pre-installed PDF file. In 2006 Japanese mobile companies BREW and SoftBank also started selling the game on their mobile platforms.|$|E
5|$|Its major {{components}} were a spaceplane orbiter with an external fuel tank and two solid-fuel launch rockets at its side. The external tank, which was <b>bigger</b> <b>than</b> the spacecraft itself, {{was the only}} major component that was not reused. The shuttle could orbit in altitudes of 185–643km (115–400 miles) and carry a maximum payload (to low orbit) of 24,400kg (54,000lb). Missions could last from 5 to 17 days and crews could be from 2 to 8 astronauts.|$|E

The carrack was far larger than Santa Cruz, fully {{three times the size}} of England's biggest ship. Madre de Deus was attacked by the much smaller Dainty. Around midday Newport's Golden Dragon, followed by Roebuck - <b>bigger</b> <b>than</b> Dainty, but only a fraction of the Madre, joined the fray. These were followed at two-hour intervals by Foresight and Prudence in the evening. The Dainty had her foremast shot away and was out of the battle for five hours.|$|E
5|$|On {{the west}} side of the main hall is another {{attached}} shrine, though in much more ruined state. The larger cave on the south side of the west shrine is closed, contains ruins and is <b>bigger</b> <b>than</b> the eastern side shrine. Some of the artworks from here were moved to museums and private collections by mid 19th century, including those related Brahma, Vishnu and others. The western face has two panels, one showing another version of Shiva in Yoga (see 14 on plan) and another Nataraja (see 15 on plan). Between these is a sanctum with a Shiva Linga.|$|E
5|$|Since Apollo, like Mercury, {{would require}} a launch escape system (LES) {{in case of a}} launch failure, a {{relatively}} small rocket was required for qualification flight testing of this system. A size <b>bigger</b> <b>than</b> the NAA Little Joe would be required, so the Little Joe II was built by General Dynamics/Convair. After an August 1963 qualification test flight, four LES test flights (A-001 through 004) were made at the White Sands Missile Range between May 1964 and January 1966.|$|E

An 18 December 2012 report on religion and public life by the Pew Research Center stated that in 2010, 49.3percent of Nigeria's population was Christian, 48.8percent was Muslim, and 1.9percent were followers of indigenous and other religions, or unaffiliated. Additionally, the 2010s census of Association of Religion Data Archives has reported that 46.5percent {{of the total population}} is Christian, slightly <b>bigger</b> <b>than</b> the Muslim population of 45.5percent, and that 7.7percent are members of other religious groups.|$|E
5|$|Although both colour morphs {{occur in}} much of the European range, brown birds predominate in the more humid climate of western Europe, with the grey phase {{becoming}} more common further east; in the northernmost regions, all the owls are a cold-grey colour. Siberian and Central Asian subspecies have grey and white plumage, the North African race is dark grey-brown, and South and East Asian birds have barred, not striped, underparts, and fine lines around the facial disc. The Siberian and Scandinavian subspecies are 12% larger and 40% heavier, and have 13% longer wings than western European birds, in accordance with Bergmann's rule which predicts that northern forms will typically be <b>bigger</b> <b>than</b> their southern counterparts.|$|E
5|$|Apollo {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{expensive}} American scientific programs ever. It cost more than $20 billion in 1960s dollars or an estimated $ in present-day US dollars. (In comparison, the Manhattan Project cost roughly $, accounting for inflation.) It used the Saturn rockets as launch vehicles, which were far <b>bigger</b> <b>than</b> the rockets built for previous projects. The spacecraft was also bigger; it had two main parts, the combined command and service module (CSM) and the lunar landing module (LM). The LM was to be left on the Moon and only the command module (CM) containing the three astronauts would eventually return to Earth.|$|E

5|$|Baleen whales {{use their}} baleen plates to sieve plankton, among others, {{out of the}} water; {{there are two types}} of methods: lunge-feeding and gulp-feeding. Lunge-feeders expand the volume of their jaw to a volume <b>bigger</b> <b>than</b> the {{original}} volume of the whale itself by inflating their mouth. This causes grooves on their throat to expand, increasing the amount of water the mouth can store. They ram a baitball at high speeds in order to feed, but this is only energy-effective when used against a large baitball. Gulp-feeders swim with an open mouth, filling it with water and prey. Prey must occur in sufficient numbers to trigger the whale's interest, be within a certain size range so that the baleen plates can filter it, and be slow enough so that it cannot escape.|$|E
5|$|Crocodilians are {{opportunistic}} predators {{that are}} at their most dangerous in water and {{at the edge of}} water. Eight species are known to attack humans and may do so to defend their territories, nests, or young; by mistake, while attacking domestic animals such as dogs; or for food, as larger crocodilians can take prey as big as or <b>bigger</b> <b>than</b> humans. The species on which there is most data are the saltwater crocodile, the Nile crocodile, and the American alligator. Other species which have sometimes attacked humans are the black caiman, the Morelet's crocodile, the mugger crocodile, the American crocodile, the gharial, and the freshwater crocodile.|$|E
5|$|The Galilean moons are {{the four}} largest moons of Jupiter—Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. They were first seen by Galileo Galilei in January 1610, and {{recognized}} by him as satellites of Jupiter in March 1610. They {{are the first}} objects found to orbit another planet. Their names derive from the lovers of Zeus. They are among the largest objects in the Solar System {{with the exception of}} the Sun and the eight planets, with a radius larger than any of the dwarf planets. Ganymede is the largest moon in the Solar System, and is even <b>bigger</b> <b>than</b> the planet Mercury. The three inner moons—Io, Europa, and Ganymede—are in a 4:2:1 orbital resonance with each other. Because of their much smaller size, and therefore weaker self-gravitation, all of Jupiter's remaining moons have irregular forms rather than a spherical shape.|$|E
