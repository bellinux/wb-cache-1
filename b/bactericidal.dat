5|$|Another theory {{states that}} {{chromosomal}} toxin-antitoxin systems {{are designed to}} be bacteriostatic rather than <b>bactericidal.</b> RelE, for example, is a global inhibitor of translation during nutrient stress, and its expression reduces the chance of starvation by lowering the cell's nutrient requirements. A homologue of mazF toxin called mazF-mx is essential for fruiting body formation in Myxococcus xanthus.|$|E
5|$|Xenon {{is used in}} {{light-emitting}} devices called xenon flash lamps, used in photographic {{flashes and}} stroboscopic lamps; to excite the active medium in lasers which then generate coherent light; and, occasionally, in <b>bactericidal</b> lamps. The first solid-state laser, invented in 1960, was pumped by a xenon flash lamp, and lasers used to power inertial confinement fusion are also pumped by xenon flash lamps.|$|E
5|$|Clindamycin is used {{in cases}} of {{suspected}} toxic shock syndrome, often in combination with a <b>bactericidal</b> agent such as vancomycin. The rationale for this approach is a presumed synergy between vancomycin, which causes {{the death of the}} bacteria by breakdown of the cell wall, and clindamycin, which is a powerful inhibitor of toxin synthesis. Both in vitro and in vivo studies have shown clindamycin reduces the production of exotoxins by staphylococci; it may also induce changes in the surface structure of bacteria that make them more sensitive to immune system attack (opsonization and phagocytosis).|$|E
5|$|Hygrophorus eburneus, {{commonly}} known as the ivory waxy cap or the cowboy's handkerchief, is a species of edible mushroom in the waxgill family of fungi. It is widespread in Europe and North America, and has also been collected in northern Africa. The fruit bodies are medium-sized, pure white, and when wet are covered in a layer of slime thick enough to make the mushroom difficult to pick up. The gills are broadly attached to the stem or running down it; as the family name suggests, they feel waxy when rubbed between the fingers. Like all Hygrophorus species, the fungus is mycorrhizal—a symbiotic association whereby the underground fungal mycelia penetrate and exchange nutrients with tree roots. They are common in a variety of forest types, where they grow on the ground in thickets or grassy areas. Hygrophorus eburneus is the type species of the genus Hygrophorus. A number of biologically active chemicals have been purified from the fruit bodies of the fungus, including fatty acids with <b>bactericidal</b> and fungicidal activity.|$|E
25|$|Brasses, {{which were}} {{frequently}} used for doorknobs and push plates in decades past, also demonstrate <b>bactericidal</b> efficacies, {{but within a}} somewhat longer time frame than pure copper. All nine brasses tested were almost completely <b>bactericidal</b> (over 99.9% kill rate) at 20°C within 60–270 minutes. Many brasses were almost completely <b>bactericidal</b> at 4°C within 180–360 minutes.|$|E
25|$|Salicylic acid {{is used as}} a food preservative, a <b>bactericidal</b> and an antiseptic.|$|E
25|$|The <b>bactericidal</b> {{activity}} of copper was also tested against two strains of MRSA and S. aureus in vitro {{to determine whether}} copper alloys are effective in preventing the spread of contamination on the touch surface products used in the hospital ward. MRSA and S. aureus counts fell below detection limits within 180 minutes. The results indicated that copper has a strong <b>bactericidal</b> effect against S. aureus, including MRSA.|$|E
25|$|There {{are other}} {{theoretical}} reasons for supporting combination therapy. The different {{drugs in the}} regimen have different modes of action. INH are bacteriocidal against replicating bacteria. EMB is bacteriostatic at low doses, but is used in TB treatment at higher, <b>bactericidal</b> doses. RMP is bacteriocidal and has a sterilizing effect. PZA is only weakly <b>bactericidal,</b> but is very effective against bacteria located in acidic environments, inside macrophages, or in areas of acute inflammation.|$|E
25|$|Gramicidin's <b>bactericidal</b> {{activity}} {{is a result}} of increasing the permeability of the bacterial cell membrane, allowing inorganic monovalent cations (e.g. Na+) to travel through unrestricted and thereby destroying the ion gradient between the cytoplasm and the extracellular environment.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} long {{observed}} that the licking of their wounds by dogs might be beneficial. Indeed, a dog's saliva is <b>bactericidal</b> against the bacteria Escherichia coli and Streptococcus canis, although not against coagulase positive Staphylococcus or Pseudomonas aeruginosa.|$|E
25|$|The Th1 {{response}} {{is characterized by}} the production of Interferon-gamma, which activates the <b>bactericidal</b> activities of macrophages, and induces B cells to make opsonizing (coating) and complement-fixing antibodies, and leads to cell-mediated immunity. In general, Th1 responses are more effective against intracellular pathogens (viruses and bacteria that are inside host cells).|$|E
25|$|Various metals were {{evaluated}} for their antimicrobial efficacies, including copper alloys, zinc, nickel, tin, silver, and gold. Antimicrobial efficacies generally followed Lewis acidity {{values of the}} various metals. Silver, a prohibitively expensive precious metal, had the highest <b>bactericidal</b> activity; copper came in second. The {{study also found that}} contact dermatitis allergies rarely occur if copper is used as a hygienic touch material.|$|E
25|$|Other {{activity}} that PPIs may modulate is v-type H+-ATPase activity, which is widely distributed {{in a variety}} of cells in the human body. Among these, the acid-producing systems in osteoclasts and leukocytes are well developed for maintaining bone turnover and exhibit <b>bactericidal</b> roles and promote tissue-destructive inflammation. Hence, there is still much potential for research on the pharmacological and clinical aspects of PPI treatment.|$|E
25|$|For generations, {{the disease}} was treated with an {{application}} of the antiseptic gentian violet. Today, topical or oral antibiotics are usually prescribed. Mild cases may be treated with <b>bactericidal</b> ointment, such as mupirocin. In 95% of cases, a single antibiotic course results in resolution in children. It has been advocated that topical disinfectants {{are not nearly as}} efficient as antibiotics, and therefore should be avoided.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, the University of Southampton {{research}} team {{was the first}} to clearly demonstrate that copper inhibits MRSA. On copper alloys — C19700 (99% copper), C24000 (80% copper), and C77000 (55% copper) — significant reductions in viability were achieved at room temperatures after 1.5 hours, 3.0 hours and 4.5 hours, respectively. Faster antimicrobial efficacies were associated with higher copper alloy content. Stainless steel did not exhibit any <b>bactericidal</b> benefits.|$|E
25|$|The T {{helper cells}} (Th cells) are {{a type of}} T cell that play an {{important}} role in the immune system, particularly in the adaptive immune system. They help the activity of other immune cells by releasing T cell cytokines. These cells help suppress or regulate immune responses. They are essential in B cell antibody class switching, in the activation and growth of cytotoxic T cells, and in maximizing <b>bactericidal</b> activity of phagocytes such as macrophages.|$|E
25|$|Unlike copper alloys, {{stainless}} steel (S30400) does not exhibit {{any degree of}} <b>bactericidal</b> properties. This material, {{which is one of}} the most common touch surface materials in the healthcare industry, allows toxic E. coli O157:H7 to remain viable for weeks. Near-zero bacterial counts are not observed even after 28 days of investigation. Epifluorescence photographs have demonstrated that E. coli O157:H7 is almost completely killed on copper alloy C10200 after just 90 minutes at 20°C; whereas a substantial number of pathogens remain on {{stainless steel}} S30400.|$|E
25|$|These {{peptides}} {{are excellent}} candidates for development as novel therapeutic agents and complements to conventional antibiotic therapy because they generally {{have a broad}} range of activity, are <b>bactericidal</b> as opposed to bacteriostatic and require a short contact time to induce killing. A number of naturally occurring peptides and their derivatives have been developed as novel anti-infective therapies for conditions as diverse as oral mucositis, lung infections associated with cystic fibrosis (CF), cancer, and skin and wound infections. Pexiganan {{has been shown to be}} useful to treat infection related diabetic foot ulcer.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{have been}} {{conducted}} to examine the E. coli O157:H7 <b>bactericidal</b> efficacies on 25 different copper alloys to identify those alloys that provide the best combination of antimicrobial activity, corrosion/oxidation resistance, and fabrication properties. Copper's antibacterial effect {{was found to be}} intrinsic in all of the copper alloys tested. As in previous studies, no antibacterial properties were observed on stainless steel (UNS S30400). Also, in confirmation with earlier studies the rate of drop-off of E. coli O157:H7 on the copper alloys is faster at room temperature than at chill temperature.|$|E
25|$|The {{mechanism}} of action is unique and complex. The drug works by damaging bacterial DNA, since its reduced form is highly reactive. This is {{made possible by the}} rapid reduction of nitrofurantoin inside the bacterial cell by flavoproteins (nitrofuran reductase) to multiple reactive intermediates that attack ribosomal proteins, DNA, respiration, pyruvate metabolism and other macromolecules within the cell. Nitrofurantoin exerts greater effects on bacterial cells than mammalian cells because bacterial cells activate the drug more rapidly. It is not known which of the actions of nitrofurantoin is primarily responsible for its <b>bactericidal</b> activity. The broad {{mechanism of}} action for this drug likely is responsible for the low development of resistance to its effects, as the drug affects many different processes important to the bacterial cell.|$|E
25|$|Calcium, {{as found}} in food such as milk and green vegetables, is often {{recommended}} to protect against dental caries. Fluoride helps prevent decay of a tooth by binding to the hydroxyapatite crystals in enamel. Streptococcus mutans {{is the leading cause}} of tooth decay. Low concentration fluoride ions act as bacteriostatic therapeutic agent and high concentration fluoride ions are <b>bactericidal.</b> The incorporated fluorine makes enamel more resistant to demineralization and, thus, resistant to decay. Topical fluoride is more highly recommended than systemic intake such as by tablets or drops to protect the surface of the teeth. This may include a fluoride toothpaste or mouthwash or varnish. Standard fluoride toothpaste (1,000–1,500 ppm) is more effective than low fluoride toothpaste (< 600ppm) to prevent dental caries. After brushing with fluoride toothpaste, rinsing should be avoided and the excess spat out. Many dental professionals include application of topical fluoride solutions as part of routine visits and recommend the use of xylitol and amorphous calcium phosphate products. Silver diamine fluoride may work better than fluoride varnish to prevent cavities. Water fluoridation also lowers the risk of tooth decay.|$|E
25|$|The {{molecular}} correlate of the filament formation was described. The {{exposure to}} β-lactam antibiotics induced the SOS response in Escherichia coli. During repair of DNA damage, the SOS response aids bacterial propagation by inhibiting cell division. Moreover, both β-lactam antibiotics and genetic mutation induce SOS in E.coli through the DpiBA two-component signal transduction system {{leading to the}} inactivation of the ftsl gene product, penicillin binding protein 3 (PBP-3). The ftsl gene {{is a group of}} filamentous temperature-sensitive genes implicated in cell division. In addition, it is a membrane transpeptidase required for peptidoglycan synthesis at the septum generated by cell division. The event to inactivate ftsl gene product requires the SOS-promoting recA and lexA genes as well as dpiA and transiently inhibits bacterial cell division. Consequently, the <b>bactericidal</b> effects of β-lactam antibiotics are limited. The DpiA is the effector for the DpiB two-component system. Interaction of DpiA with replication origins competes with the binding of the replication proteins DnaA and DnaB. When overexpressed, DpiA can interrupt DNA replication and induce the SOS response resulting in inhibition of cell division.|$|E
25|$|The {{modes of}} action by which {{antimicrobial}} peptides kill microbes are varied, and may differ for different bacterial species. Some antimicrobial peptides kill both bacteria and fungi, e.g., psoriasin kills E. coli and several filamentous fungi. The cytoplasmic membrane {{is a frequent}} target, but peptides may also interfere with DNA and protein synthesis, protein folding, and cell wall synthesis. The initial contact between the peptide and the target organism is electrostatic, as most bacterial surfaces are anionic, or hydrophobic, {{such as in the}} antimicrobial peptide Piscidin. Their amino acid composition, amphipathicity, cationic charge and size allow them to attach to and insert into membrane bilayers to form pores by ‘barrel-stave’, ‘carpet’ or ‘toroidal-pore’ mechanisms. Alternately, they may penetrate into the cell to bind intracellular molecules which are crucial to cell living. Intracellular binding models includes inhibition of cell wall synthesis, alteration of the cytoplasmic membrane, activation of autolysin, inhibition of DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis, and inhibition of certain enzymes. However, in many cases, the exact mechanism of killing is not known. One emerging technique for the study of such mechanisms is dual polarisation interferometry. In contrast to many conventional antibiotics these peptides appear to be <b>bactericidal</b> instead of bacteriostatic. In general the antimicrobial activity of these peptides is determined by measuring the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC), which is the lowest concentration of drug that inhibits bacterial growth.|$|E
500|$|Linezolid is {{considered}} bacteriostatic against most organisms—that is, it stops their growth and reproduction without actually killing them—but has some <b>bactericidal</b> (killing) activity against streptococci. Some authors have noted that, despite its bacteriostatic effect in vitro, linezolid [...] "behaves" [...] as a <b>bactericidal</b> antibiotic in vivo because it inhibits {{the production of}} toxins by staphylococci and streptococci. It also has a post-antibiotic effect lasting one to four hours for most bacteria, meaning that bacterial growth is temporarily suppressed even after the drug is discontinued.|$|E
500|$|The intra-cellular {{granules}} of {{the human}} neutrophil have long been recognized for their protein-destroying and <b>bactericidal</b> properties. Neutrophils can [...] secrete products that stimulate monocytes and macrophages. Neutrophil secretions increase phagocytosis {{and the formation of}} reactive oxygen compounds involved in intracellular killing. Secretions from the primary granules of neutrophils stimulate the phagocytosis of IgG-antibody-coated bacteria.|$|E
500|$|Several {{fatty acids}} with <b>bactericidal</b> and fungicidal {{activity}} have been isolated and identified from the fruit bodies of [...] H.eburneus. The bioactive fatty acids are built upon a chemical structure called γ-oxocrotonate. The following gamma-oxocrotonate derivatives {{have been identified}} from the mushroom: (2E,9E)-4-oxooctadeca-2,9,17-trienoic acid, (2E,11Z)-4-oxooctadeca-2,11,17-trienoic acid, (E)-4-oxohexadeca-2,15-dienoic acid, (E)-4-oxooctadeca-2,17-dienoic acid, (2E,9E)-4-oxooctadeca-2,9-dienoic acid, (2E,11Z)-4-oxooctadeca-2,11-dienoic acid, (E)-4-oxohexadec-2-enoic acid, and (E)-4-oxooctadec-2-enoic acid. The compound (E)-4-oxohexadec-2-enoic acid has been investigated for potential use as a fungicide against the oomycete species Phytophthora infestans, a causal agent of potato and tomato late blight disease.|$|E
500|$|It is {{traditionally}} believed that so-called [...] "deep" [...] infections—such as osteomyelitis or infective endocarditis—should {{be treated with}} <b>bactericidal</b> antibiotics, not bacteriostatic ones. Nevertheless, preclinical studies were conducted to assess the efficacy of linezolid for these infections, and the drug has been used successfully to treat them in clinical practice. Linezolid {{appears to be a}} reasonable therapeutic option for infective endocarditis caused by multi-resistant Gram-positive bacteria, despite a lack of high-quality evidence to support this use. Results in the treatment of enterococcal endocarditis have varied, with some cases treated successfully and others not responding to therapy. Low- to medium-quality evidence is also mounting for its use in bone and joint infections, including chronic osteomyelitis, although adverse effects are a significant concern when long-term use is necessary.|$|E
2500|$|The {{quantitative}} {{hydrolysis constant}} (K value) {{is used to}} express the <b>bactericidal</b> power of chloroamines, which depends on their generating hypochlorous acid in water. It is expressed by the equation below, and is generally in the range 10−4 to 10−10 ( [...] for monochloroamine): ...|$|E
2500|$|Cephalosporins are <b>bactericidal</b> {{and have}} the same mode of action as other β-lactam {{antibiotics}} (such as penicillins), but are less susceptible to β-lactamases. Cephalosporins disrupt the synthesis of the peptidoglycan layer forming the bacterial cell wall. [...] The peptidoglycan layer is important for cell wall structural integrity. [...] The final transpeptidation step in the synthesis of the peptidoglycan is facilitated by penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). PBPs bind to the D-Ala-D-Ala {{at the end of}} muropeptides (peptidoglycan precursors) to crosslink the peptidoglycan. Beta-lactam antibiotics mimic the D-Ala-D-Ala site, thereby irreversibly inhibiting PBP crosslinking of peptidoglycan.|$|E
2500|$|Amoxicillin {{attaches}} to the cell wall of susceptible bacteria and results in their death. It also is a <b>bactericidal</b> compound. It is effective against Streptococci, Pneumococci, Enterococci, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Neisseria meningitidis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Shigella, Chlamydia trachomatis, Salmonell, Borrelia burgdorferi and Helicobactor pylori. As a derivative of ampicillin, amoxicillin {{is a member of}} the same family as penicillins and like them, is a β-lactam antibiotic. It inhibits cross-linkage between the linear peptidoglycan polymer chains that make up a major component of the cell wall of Gram-positive and a minor component of Gram-negative bacteria. Gram negative bacteria are not generally susceptible to Beta-lactam antibiotics.|$|E
2500|$|Cefalexin is a {{beta-lactam}} antibiotic of the cephalosporin family. [...] It is <b>bactericidal</b> {{and acts}} by inhibiting {{synthesis of the}} peptidoglycan layer of the bacterial cell wall. As cefalexin closely resembles d-alanyl-d-alanine, an amino acid ending on the peptidoglycan layer of the cell wall, {{it is able to}} irreversibly bind to the active site of PBP, which is essential for the synthesis of the cell wall. It is most active against gram-positive cocci, and has moderate activity against some gram-negative bacilli. However, some bacterial cells have the enzyme β-lactamase, which hydrolyzes the beta-lactam ring, rendering the drug inactive. This contributes to antibacterial resistance towards cephalexin.|$|E
2500|$|The Codex Alimentarius Code of Hygienic Practice for Milk {{notes that}} milk {{pasteurization}} {{is designed to}} achieve at least a 5 log10 reduction of Coxiella burnetii. [...] The Code also notes that: “The minimum pasteurization conditions are those having <b>bactericidal</b> effects equivalent to heating every particle of the milk to 72°C for 15 seconds (continuous flow pasteurization) or 63°C for 30 minutes (batch pasteurization)” and that “To ensure that each particle is sufficiently heated, the milk flow in heat exchangers should be turbulent, i.e. the Reynolds number should be sufficiently high.” [...] The point about turbulent flow is important because simplistic laboratory studies of heat inactivation that use test tubes, without flow, will have less bacterial inactivation than larger scale experiments that seek to replicate conditions of commercial pasteurization.|$|E
2500|$|Quinolones and fluoroquinolones are {{chemotherapeutic}} <b>bactericidal</b> drugs, eradicating bacteria by {{interfering with}} DNA replication. Quinolones inhibit the bacterial DNA gyrase or the topoisomerase IV enzyme, thereby inhibiting DNA replication and transcription. Topoisomerase II {{is also a}} target {{for a variety of}} quinolone-based drugs. High activity against the eukaryotic type II enzyme is exhibited by drugs containing aromatic substituents at their C-7 positions. [...] First and second generation fluoroquinolones selectively inhibit the topoisomerase II ligase domain, leaving the two nuclease domains intact. This modification, coupled with the constant action of the topoisomerase II in the bacterial cell, leads to DNA fragmentation via the nucleasic activity of the intact enzyme domains. Third and fourth generation fluoroquinolones are more selective for the topoisomerase IV ligase domain, and thus have enhanced gram-positive coverage.|$|E
2500|$|Competence in S. pneumoniae is {{induced by}} DNA-damaging agents such as {{mitomycin}} C, fluoroquinolone antibiotics (norfloxacin, levofloxacin and moxifloxacin), and topoisomerase inhibitors. Transformation protects S. pneumoniae against the <b>bactericidal</b> effect of mitomycin C. [...] Michod et al. summarized evidence that induction of competence in S. pneumoniae {{is associated with}} increased resistance to oxidative stress and increased expression of the RecA protein, {{a key component of}} the recombinational repair machinery for removing DNA damages. On the basis of these findings they suggested that transformation is an adaptation for repairing oxidative DNA damages. S. pneumoniae infection stimulates polymorphonuclear leukocytes (granulocytes) to produce an oxidative burst that is potentially lethal to the bacteria. The ability of S. pneumoniae to repair the oxidative DNA damages in its genome, caused by this host defense, likely contributes to this pathogen’s virulence. Consistent with this premise Li et al. reported that, among different highly transformable S. pneumoniae isolates, nasal colonization fitness and virulence (lung infectivity) depend on an intact competence system.|$|E
