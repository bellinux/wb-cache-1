When people encountered an ala on a road or field, they could get dangerous diseases from her. Ale are also responsible for dogs’ rabies, although indirectly: a skylark that reaches the clouds and encounters an ala there goes mad (alosan), plunges to the ground, and so kills itself; a dog that finds and eats the bird goes mad too.|$|E
5|$|Although {{proposals}} for television projects were submitted to him, {{he had no}} interest in working outside the film world. Nevertheless, the hard-drinking director did agree to appear in a series of television ads for Suntory whiskey, which aired in 1976. While fearing that he might never <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> another film, the director nevertheless continued working on various projects, writing scripts and creating detailed illustrations, intending to leave behind a visual record of his plans in case he {{would never be able to}} film his stories.|$|E

5|$|Although today our {{opponents are}} at the Rhine and at the Oder, I do not believe yet {{that there will be}} a coup brought about by the German people. Without {{assistance}} from outside, such a coup is not even to be considered. Only the armed forces would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a conclusive coup. But the prominent officers know, as well as the party officials, that a lost war will sweep them out of power. Therefore, the war continues until the possibility of it continuing any further is brought to an end. The Allies must continue to advance and fight until the German troops have no more ammunition and war material with which to offer resistance.|$|E
5|$|In late April {{there were}} reports that Orme had a sore throat. This caused Orme to drift in the betting for the Derby, and La Fleche became the favourite. Orme was {{withdrawn}} from the 2000 Guineas, but returned to doing gentle exercise and it was hoped that he would still <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the Derby. The Duke of Westminster hinted that he had been poisoned. In early May, Orme had still not improved, and connections stated that he had been poisoned with mercury. It was suspected that the culprit may have been a well-known backer of Derby rival La Fleche, with the poison being administered in a lozenge that Orme chewed, blistering his tongue. However, a dentist that removed part of a decayed tooth from Orme suggested that the illness was not due to poisoning, but to the decayed tooth.|$|E

The broadcaster {{has no plans to}} join the EBU at the moment. This was confirmed again on 28 July 2014 {{in the run-up to the}} Eurovision Song Contest 2015 in Austria. 1FLTV did however state their interest in participating in the Eurovision Song Contest, but that they have to evaluate the costs of EBU membership, a necessary prelude to participation. 1FLTV confirmed that the nation will not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> its début in 2016, due to lack of funds to join the EBU. On 21 September 2016, 1FLTV announced that they would not be able to debut to the contest in 2017, but that they would set their eyes on a future participation once they overcome their financial hurdles. Yet again, on the 1 September 2017 they also announced they wouldn't debut at the 2018 contest in Lisbon.|$|E

5|$|On June 16, 2001, the Thai {{government}} under Thaksin Shinawatra agreed {{to open the}} sluice gates of the Pak Mun Dam for four months to allow studies to be conducted on its social impact; this was later extended to 13 months. Coinciding with this agreement, the government announced that official studies would be conducted by Ubon Ratchathani University and a private team contracted by the National Economic and Social Development Board. The university received a budget of 10 million baht (roughly US$280,000), and the government contractors, alleged {{to be the same}} group that recommended damming another river, received 94 million baht (roughly US$2,700,000), raising suspicions. Villagers thought that outside academics would not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> an objective or accurate study of the river because they were unfamiliar with local fish migration and habitats.|$|E
5|$|Owumi {{returned}} to Alcorn State {{to play basketball}} as a senior and became team captain. In his season debut on November 9, 2007, he scored 10 points and grabbed eight rebounds in an 18-point loss to Southeastern Louisiana. On December 1, he led his team with 20 points off the bench vs. Texas–Rio Grande Valley. In his next Division I game, he recorded 24 points and eight rebounds. On January 5, 2008, Owumi posted a season-high 28 points, nine rebounds, and four assists as Texas Southern defeated Alcorn State, 81–75. Despite the senior's increased role, the Braves finished {{the season with a}} 7–24 record. Owumi closed out his final season with the team averaging 14.4 points, a team-best 6.6 rebounds, 1.9 assists, and 0.9 steals. Due to the lower talent level and popularity of the SWAC, he was uncertain if he would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the National Basketball Association (NBA) after college.|$|E
5|$|Tech {{received}} Miami's post-score kickoff {{needing to}} score quickly {{in order to}} have a chance to have a second opportunity on offense — needed because Tech was now two scores behind. Tech returned the kickoff to the 24-yard line but were penalized 12 yards for an illegal block. Casey passed for an eight-yard gain and ran for three yards for a first down. After that gain, things went against the Hokies. Casey was penalized 15 yards for intentional grounding, and Tech was unable to gain another first down. The Hokies punted, and Miami took over on offense at its 46-yard line. In possession of the lead, Miami began to run out the clock, executing multiple rushing plays in succession in order to force the game clock to continue to count down. Tech's defense forced a stop, but because Miami punted the ball with just 2:20 remaining in the game, there was little chance that Tech would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> up the needed two scores.|$|E

5|$|The emergentist {{coalition}} model {{suggests that}} children {{make use of}} multiple cues to successfully attach a novel label to a novel object. The word learning situation may offer an infant combinations of social, perceptual, cognitive, and linguistic cues. While a range of cues {{are available from the}} start of word learning, it may be the case that not all cues are utilized by the infant when they begin the word learning process. While younger children may only be able to detect a limited number of cues, older, more experienced word learners may <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> use of a range of cues. For instance, young children seem to focus primarily on perceptual salience, but older children attend to the gaze of caregivers and use the focus of caregivers to direct their word mapping. Therefore, this model argues that principles or cues may be present from the onset of word learning, but the use {{of a wide range of}} cues develops over time.|$|E
5|$|BioWare {{provided}} its Aurora Engine from Neverwinter Nights for the sequel. One of {{the decisions}} to use Aurora rather than build a new engine from scratch was the toolset—Obsidian wanted players to continue to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> content for the game, which {{may not have been}} possible with a new engine. BioWare made itself available to Obsidian with technical support on the engine, but Obsidian planned on completely overhauling Aurora, including its code. The designers wanted to improve the visuals of the first game with additions such as better lighting and textures, which required significant changes to the engine. The upgraded engine was referred to as Electron. Electron was designed to incorporate DirectX to make it compatible for a potential Xbox 360 release, but Obsidian eventually abandoned plans for a port to the system for financial reasons. The toolset that was used to create the game was also revamped, and included several additions like a customizable interface, a new dialogue format, and building assistants—similar to the wizards found in Microsoft Word and Excel. Like Neverwinter Nights, the toolset was included in the game's release for players to use.|$|E
5|$|From 1937 Burnet was {{involved}} in a variety of scientific and public policy bodies, starting with a position on a government advisory council on polio. After he became the director of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute in 1944, he was considered a public figure and overcame shyness to become a good public speaker. He recognised the importance of co-operation with the media if the general public was to understand science and scientists, and his writings and lectures played an important part in the formulation of public attitudes and policy in Australia on a variety of biological topics. However, despite making many appearances on radio and television, he never became at ease with interviews and had to be selective with outreach engagements due to the many invitations he received, and tended to accept those that had the potential to promote the Institute. Over time, he began to increase his activism, as he felt more confident that he would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> an impact as his reputation grew, especially after winning the Nobel Prize, and even more so after his retirement from the directorship of the Institute. Although Burnet was not naturally outgoing, he saw it as the social responsibility of a scientific leader and scholar to publicly speak out and impart wisdom and foresight to the wider community.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) demands {{compensation}} for her voice work in Tracy Jordan's (Tracy Morgan) pornographic video game, Gorgasm: The Legend of Dong Slayer. The argument escalates and Liz orders {{them to stop}} their bickering. After Liz leaves for Chicago, Jenna and Tracy decide to conduct a social experiment to see whether Tracy can survive better as a white woman than Jenna can as a black man, after arguing respectively that black men and white women have it harder in society. Later, while on her flight, Liz takes Jack's sedative. Liz realizes that the woman {{sitting next to her}} is Oprah Winfrey. When Liz arrives back at the 30 Rock studios, Tracy is dressed in female drag with his body covered in white makeup and soon after, Jenna enters in blackface and male drag. Jack worries that the situation has gone out of control, but Liz assures him that Oprah, who is coming to the studios, will <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> them come to terms. As it turns out, her inflight conversation with Oprah was a hallucination. The person who Liz thought was Oprah is actually a 12-year-old girl named Pam (Raven Goodwin). Even so, Pam engages Tracy and Jenna in a heart-to-heart, and manages to settle their differences.|$|E
5|$|By 1983, Jonathan Powell was keen to put {{the serial}} into {{production}} and offered the scripts to producer Michael Wearing who was immediately impressed by the scenes in the first episode, “Compassionate Leave”, depicting Craven's reaction to Emma's death, describing them as “the most sustained evocation of individual grief in bereavement that I can remember”. The budget was set at £2 million, of which £400,000 came from an American co-producer, Lionheart Television International. Director Martin Campbell came on board shortly afterwards and soon clashed with Troy Kennedy Martin, demanding rewrites, in particular {{to the notion that}} Craven had known about Emma's involvement with GAIA right from the start; this was removed at Campbell's behest. Further clashes over the script occurred between Kennedy Martin and star Bob Peck over the conclusion in which his character would turn into a tree; Peck recalled that “it didn't seem to be working in script terms, it seemed as though we wouldn't <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it work for the audience”, a view echoed by Michael Wearing who felt that it was “likely not to come off as an effect”. Kennedy Martin capitulated, introducing instead the concept of the black flowers seen in the finished production. However, some elements of Kennedy Martin's original vision persist in the final script: for example, in episode three, “Burden of Proof”, the ghost of Emma urges Craven, as he undergoes a breakdown, to be strong, like a tree.|$|E
5|$|Gouverneur Morris is credited, {{both now}} and then, {{as the chief}} {{draftsman}} of the final document, including the stirring preamble. Not all the delegates were pleased with the results; thirteen left before the ceremony, and three of those remaining refused to sign: Edmund Randolph of Virginia, George Mason of Virginia, and Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts. George Mason demanded a Bill of Rights if he was to support the Constitution. The Bill of Rights {{was not included in}} the Constitution submitted to the states for ratification, but many states ratified the Constitution with the understanding that a bill of rights would soon follow. Shortly before the document was to be signed, Gorham proposed to lower the size of congressional districts from 40,000 to 30,000 citizens. A similar measure had been proposed earlier, and failed by one vote. George Washington spoke up here, making his only substantive contribution to the text of the Constitution in supporting this move. The Convention adopted it without further debate. Gorham would sign the document, although he had openly doubted whether the United States would remain a single, unified nation for more than 150 years. Ultimately, 39 of the original 55 delegates ended up signing, but it is likely that none were completely satisfied. Their views were summed up by Benjamin Franklin, who said, I confess that There are several parts of this Constitution which I do not at present approve, but I am not sure I shall never approve them.... I doubt too whether any other Convention we can obtain, may <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a better Constitution.... It therefore astonishes me, Sir, to find this system approaching so near to perfection as it does; and I think it will astonish our enemies...|$|E

5|$|Kant {{believed}} that the shared ability of humans to reason should {{be the basis of}} morality, and that it is the ability to reason that makes humans morally significant. He, therefore, {{believed that}} all humans {{should have the right to}} common dignity and respect. Margaret Eaton argues that, according to Kant's ethics, a medical professional must be happy for their own practices to be used by and on anyone, even if they were the patient themselves. For example, a researcher who wished to perform tests on patients without their knowledge must be happy for all researchers to do so. She also argues that Kant's requirement of autonomy would mean that a patient must <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a fully informed decision about treatment, making it immoral to perform tests on unknowing patients. Medical research should be motivated out of respect for the patient, so they must be informed of all facts, even if this would be likely to dissuade the patient. Jeremy Sugarman has argued that Kant's formulation of autonomy requires that patients are never used merely for the benefit of society, but are always treated as rational people with their own goals. Aaron Hinkley notes that a Kantian account of autonomy requires respect for choices that are arrived at rationally, not for choices which are arrived at by idiosyncratic or non-rational means. He argues that there may be some difference between what a purely rational agent would choose and what a patient actually chooses, the difference being the result of non-rational idiosyncrasies. Although a Kantian physician ought not to lie to or coerce a patient, Hinkley suggests that some form of paternalism - such as through withholding information which may prompt a non-rational response - could be acceptable.|$|E
