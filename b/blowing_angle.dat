50|$|Much of the shakuhachi's subtlety (and player's skill) lies in {{its rich}} tone colouring, and the ability for its variation. Different fingerings, embouchures and amounts of meri/kari can produce notes of the same pitch, but with subtle or {{dramatic}} differences in the tone colouring. Holes can be covered partially (1/3 covered, 1/2, 2/3, etc.) and pitch varied subtly or substantially by changing the <b>blowing</b> <b>angle.</b> The Honkyoku (本曲) pieces rely heavily on {{this aspect of the}} instrument to enhance their subtlety and depth.|$|E

As the length increases, the spacing of the finger holes also increases, stretching both fingers and technique. Longer flutes often have offset finger holes, and very long flutes {{are almost always}} custom made to suit individual players. Some honkyoku, in particular those of the Nezasaha (Kimpu-ryū) school are intended to be played on these longer flutes.|$|E

Located inside the bamboo tube, near the oval blowing hole, is a soft wooden piece that adjust pitches when necessary. The first hole after the blowing hole is 12 centimeters away, while the other holes continue at a distance of 1 centimeter apart. At {{the other end of the}} flute, there is a non-covering hole called definite pitch hole, making it easier for the listener to discern pitch. The simple construction of the holes allow for very complex techniques in playing the instrument such as the use of breath with changes in the <b>blowing</b> <b>angle</b> for great or minute changes in sound quality, or partial-holding of finger holes to make delicate pitch changes.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike a recorder, {{where the}} player blows into a duct - a narrow airway over a block {{which is called}} a [...] "fipple" [...] - and thus has limited pitch control, the shakuhachi player blows as one would blow {{across the top of}} an empty bottle (though the shakuhachi has a sharp edge to blow against called utaguchi) and {{therefore}} has substantial pitch control. The five finger holes are tuned to a minor pentatonic scale with no half-tones, but using techniques called meri メリ and kari カリ, in which the <b>blowing</b> <b>angle</b> is adjusted to bend the pitch downward and upward, respectively, combined with embouchure adjustments and fingering techniques the player can bend each pitch as much as a whole tone or more. Pitches may also be lowered by shading (kazashi カザシ) or partially covering finger holes. Since most pitches can be achieved via several different fingering or blowing techniques on the shakuhachi, the timbre of each possibility is taken into account when composing or playing thus different names are used to write notes of the same pitch which differ in timbre. The shakuhachi has a range of two full octaves (the lower is called otsu 乙/呂, the upper, kan 甲) and a partial third octave (dai-kan 大甲) though experienced players can produce notes up to E7 (2637.02Hz) on a 1.8 shakuhachi [...] The various octaves are produced using subtle variations of breath, finger positions and embouchure.In traditional shakuhachi repertoire instead of tonguing for articulation like many western wind instruments, hitting holes (oshi 押し / osu オス) with a very fast movement is used and each note has its corresponding repeat fingerings e.g. for repeating C5 (リ) the 5th hole (D5's tone hole) is used.|$|E

In the article, “Artefact-Geofact Analysis of The Lithic Material from The Susiluola Cave,” by Hans-Peter Schulz (2007) whom explained Geofacts are multi-shaped rocks that can be found while archaeologists are trying to find true artifacts during past glacial periods. Glacial periods such as the Eemian interglacial and the Middle Weichselian glaciation located in the northern parts of the world melted and began to move rocks from their original areas while they scraped everything around them. The rock movement created sometimes weapon like spears from smaller rocks and appear as artifacts but instead are just a product of glacial melting. Another element Schulz explained is the mixing of natural and salt water during the glaciations, which changed sediment locations within rocks such as the Susiluola cave located in Finland. Once the ice melted the sediment and ice created some artificial markings on pebble sized rocks. Some elements that could morph rock shapes in caves include sandstone, siltstone and quartzite creating a kinetic process of shaping the rocks. There are measurements Schulz created to distinguish a geofact such as <b>blow</b> <b>angles</b> from a sandstone or quartzite rock with a limit between 45 and 90 degrees, and if the abrasions were rounded these are considered geofacts.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{the process}} of wind erosion on two kinds of soil from the agro-pastoral area of Inner Mongolia are studied using wind tunnel experiments, {{considering}} the wind speed, <b>blown</b> <b>angle</b> of wind and soil moisture content. The {{results showed that the}} modulus of soil wind erosion increases with an increase of wind speed. When the wind speed exceeds a critical value, the soil wind erosion suddenly increases. The critical speed for both kinds of soil is within the range of 7 - 8 m center dot s(- 1). For a constant wind speed, the rate of soil wind erosion changes from increasing to falling at a critical soil slope. The critical slope of loam soil and sandy loam soil is 20 A degrees and 10 A degrees, respectively. Soil moisture content has a significant effect on wind erosion. Soil wind erosion of both soils decreases with an increase of the soil water content in two treatments, however, for treatment two, the increasing trends of wind erosion for two soils with the falling of soil water content are no significant, especially for the loam soil, and in the same soil water content, the wind erosion of two soils in treatment one is significantly higher than treatment two, this indicates reducing the disturbance of soil surface can evidently control the soil wind erosion...|$|R

For these tests, all the treatments were performed under the condition of wind velocity of 14 m s 1 and a <b>blown</b> <b>angle</b> of 8. 75 %, according to the actual situation of experimented area. The study results indicated that using PAM on the soil surface could enhance the capability of avoiding the wind erosion, at the same time, the effect of controlling wind soil erosion with 4 g m - 2 PAM was better than 2 g m - 2 PAM's. Economically, the 2 g m - 2 PAM used in soil surface can control wind erosion effectively in this region. The prophase PAM accumulated in soil could not improve the capability of avoiding the wind erosion, owing to the degradation of PAM in the soil and the continual tillage year after year. The texture of soil is a main factor influencing the capability of soil avoiding wind erosion. Soil with higher clay content has the higher capability of preventing soil from wind erosion than one with the opposite one under the together action of PAM and water. © Springer Science+Business Media B.

However, the increased net benefits that can be continuously harnessed by using these conventional cooling techniques seem to be incremental and are about to approach their limit.

The ventilation systems of the subway tunnel need improvements to have better air-quality. Numerical analyses might be effective tools analyze the flowfield inside the air-curtain installed subway tunnel. The ANSYS CFX software is used for steady computations of the airflow inside the tunnel. The single-track subway tunnel has the natural shaft, the mechanical shaft, and the PSDs installed stations. The height and width of the tunnel are 6. 0 m and 4. 0 m respectively. The tunnel is 400 m long and the air-curtain is installed {{at the top of}} the tunnel. The thickness and the width of the air-curtain are 0. 08 m and 4 m respectively. The velocity of the air-curtain changes between 20 - 30 m/s. Three cases are analyzed depending on the installing location of the air-curtain. The discharged-air through the natural shafts increases as the velocity of the air-curtain increases when the air-curtain is installed between the mechanical and the natural shafts. The pollutant-air is exhausted by the mechanical and the natural shafts and remained air is pushed toward tunnel end. The discharged-air through the natural shaft is low when the air-curtain installed before the natural shaft.

40|$|An {{experimental}} and numerical investigation {{was performed in}} order to firstly establish the aerodynamics and aeroacoustics of a landing gear torque link configuration, and secondly to assess the effectiveness of both passive and active flow control as noise attenuation methods. Experimental and numerical data showed that afixing a torque link on to a half cylinder strut resulted in the suppression of vortex shedding in between the torque arms. This resulted in a narrower wake with reduced drag. PIV wake profiles showed the suppression of shedding to result in reduced velocity fluctuations, as shown by reductions in shear and normal Reynolds stresses. Simulation showed attaching the torque link to the strut {{to result in a}} reduction of farfield noise levels by up to 7. 5 dB. Altering the torque link angle ttheta was shown to affect the aerodynamic field, with a decrease in drag and wake strength, as shown by a reduction in mean and fluctuating velocities. However, altering the torque link angle was shown to have little affect on near field acoustics. Altering the yaw angle φ from φ = 0 º to 180 º was shown to affect periodic vortex shedding from the strut, with shedding occurring at lower frequencies for φ = 90 º and 135 º. Phased microphone array data showed interaction between the strut's wake and the downstream torque link to be the major source of noise for yaw angles with the torque link almost or entirely aligned with the strut. This interaction noise decreased when the torque link was out of alignment with the strut. The major source of noise for these yaw angles became edge noise due to the torque link extending into the freestream. Both {{experimental and}} numerical acoustics showed φ = 0 º and 180 º to exhibit the loudest OASPL. A conformal fairing applied over the torque link 'gap region' was found to be effective in attenuating interaction noise. The most effective application of the fairing was found for the standard yaw angle of φ = 0 º, with noise reductions of up to 4. 5 dB. Active flow control applied in the form of blowing from the landing gear strut was also found to be effective at reducing interaction noise when applied from <b>blowing</b> <b>angles</b> of 30 º and 90 º. Blowing was found to reduce the strength of the wake and to deflect the wake away from the downstream torque link, resulting in a decrease in tonal noise by up to 10. 3 dB and a reduction in broadband noise of up to 6 dB over 0. 01 ≤ St ≤ 1. <br/...|$|R

It was shown that the jet turbulence is wrapped around the vortex and ingested into it. This takes place faster with decreasing jet-to-vortex distance and increasing jet strength. Both time-averaged and instantaneous flow fields showed that the trailing vortex became diffused with its rotational velocity and vorticity levels reduced when the jet is located close to the vortex. The mechanism with which the jet interacts with the vortex is a combination of vortices shed by the jet and the turbulence. No noticeable differences were found within the Reynolds number range tested. The effect of jet on the vortex is delayed when the jet is <b>blowing</b> at an <b>angle</b> to the free stream and away from the vortex such as during take-off...|$|R
