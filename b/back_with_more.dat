25|$|The BNCR {{purchased}} {{a share in}} the lease of the long-standing and well thought of Antrim Arms hotel at Portrush and in 1883 formed a separate company to manage what was renamed the Northern Counties Hotel. Situated on an elevated site, the hotel overlooked the Atlantic Ocean at front and <b>back.</b> <b>With</b> <b>more</b> than one hundred rooms, it was intended to accommodate high-class tourists visiting the Giant's Causeway. The hotel was enlarged and improved in 1884 and 1892 and in 1902 the BNCR purchased the freehold outright from the Earl of Antrim.|$|E
25|$|Like many auks, puffins eat both {{fish and}} zooplankton, but feed their chicks {{primarily}} with small marine fish {{several times a}} day. The prey species of the Atlantic puffin include the sandeel, herring and capelin. The puffins are distinct {{in their ability to}} hold several (sometimes over a dozen) small fish at a time, crosswise in their bill, rather than regurgitating swallowed fish. This allows them to take longer foraging trips, since they can come <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>more</b> food energy for their chick than a bird that can only carry one fish at a time. This behaviour is made possible by the unique hinging mechanism of their beak, which allows the upper and lower biting edges to meet at any of a number of angles.|$|E
25|$|As soon as {{hostilities}} commenced in September 1965, the {{air forces}} {{of both countries}} launched attacks {{against each other in}} the eastern theater. The IAF bombed airfields and airstrips located in East Pakistan (at Chittagong, Dhaka, Lalmunirhat, and Jessore), while the PAF managed to launch two celebrated raids on the Indian Air Force base at Kalaikunda, near Kharagpur, West Bengal. The PAF raids, a five-plane strike followed up by a four-plane attack, took place on 7 September, destroying several Canberra bombers and Vampire aircraft on the ground, while the IAF claimed 2 aerial kills (Pakistani sources record 1 F-86 lost). The first PAF Kalaikunda raid (by 5 Sabres) achieved total surprise, but the second wave was opposed by Indian interceptors, leading to the loss of the aircraft. The PAF also launched attacks on Bagdogra on 10 September and Barrackpore on 14 September, with varying results. While the IAF hit <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>more</b> airstrikes on Dacca, Jessore, and Lalmunirhat, these failed to destroy any aircraft. Mid-air interceptions and dogfights rarely happened, and barring some skirmishing between the EPR and BSF along the border, the air forces of both countries were responsible for most of the combat activity in the eastern theater during the 1965 war. The final tally was 12 Indian aircraft destroyed on the ground (PAF claim 21 aircraft destroyed), 2 Pakistani Sabres shot down, (the PAF records one aircraft lost), and 1 PAF Sabre lost due to an accident. Following the war, the IAF continued its steady growth in combat capacity and logistical capabilities, while Pakistan boosted its squadron strength to 20 F-86 Sabres (although it neglected to expand its operational infrastructure substantially).|$|E

2500|$|When Edmund {{reveals that}} he has tuberculosis, Mary refuses to believe it, and {{attempts}} to discredit Dr. Hardy, due to her inability to face the reality and most importantly {{the severity of the}} situation. She accuses Edmund of attempting to get more attention by blowing everything out of proportion. In retaliation, Edmund reminds his mother that her own father died of tuberculosis, and then, before exiting, he adds {{how difficult it is to}} have a [...] "dope fiend for a mother." [...] By herself, Mary admits that she needs more morphine and hopes that someday she will “accidentally” overdose, because she knows that if she did so on purpose, the Virgin would never forgive her. When James comes <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>more</b> alcohol he notes that there was evidence that Jamie had attempted to pick the locks to the whiskey cabinet in the cellar, as he has done before. Mary ignores this and bursts out that she is afraid that Edmund is going to die. She also confides to James that Edmund does not love her because of her drug problem. When James attempts to console her, Mary again rues having given birth to Edmund, who appears to have been conceived to replace a baby they had lost before Edmund’s birth. When Cathleen announces dinner, Mary indicates that she is not hungry and is going to bed. James goes in to dinner all alone, knowing that Mary is really going upstairs to get more drugs.|$|E
2500|$|Barris' jokey, bumbling personality; his accentuated hand-clapping between {{sentences}} (which eventually had {{the studio}} audience joining in with him); and his catchphrases (he would usually go into commercial break with, [...] "We'll be right <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>more</b> er... STUFF...", occasionally paired with shifting his head to reveal the ubiquitous sign behind the stage reading simply [...] "STUFF", and [...] "This is me saying 'bye'" [...] {{was one of his}} favorite closing lines) were the antithesis of the smooth TV host (such as Gary Owens, who hosted the syndicated version in its first season). Barris joined in with the eccentricity of the format, using unusual props, dressing in colorful and somewhat unusual clothing (such as the occasional hat pulled over his head, if not his eyes), he became yet another performer of the show, and for many, quite a cult hero. Dubbed [...] "Chuckie Baby" [...] by his fans, Barris was a perfect fit with the show's goofy, sometimes wild amateur performers and its panel of three judges (including regulars Jamie Farr, Jaye P. Morgan, Rex Reed and Arte Johnson). In addition, there was a growing [...] "cast of characters", including an NBC stage carpenter who played [...] "Father Ed," [...] a priest who would get flustered when his cue cards were deliberately turned upside-down; Canadian comedian Murray Langston, who as [...] "The Unknown Comic" [...] wore a paper bag over his head (with cut-outs for his eyes, mouth, and even a box of Kleenex), and [...] "Gene Gene the Dancing Machine" [...] (Gene Patton), arguably the most popular member of the [...] "cast", the show's prop man, [...] who would show up and dance whenever the band played the song [...] "Jumpin' at the Woodside". In the early 1980s, Patton was even pointed out by tour guides of incoming NBC tours as his onscreen character, {{while at the same time}} adhering to his more typical off-camera work duties.|$|E

50|$|Though George {{rushed for}} 1,000 yards {{in all but}} one season, {{numerous}} sports writers suggested that a heavy workload caused a decline in George's productivity.

George's decline in production along with several toe and ankle injuries were contributing factors in Titans owner Bud Adams' decision to release him on July 21, 2004 in part due to salary cap considerations,after George would not agree to a pay cut.|$|R

He has always one den near a corn-field, where he can sleep when too full or too lazy to travel; he has one dry tree for stormy weather, and one cool mossy shell in deep shadow for the hot summer days. He has at least one sunny nook in the top of a hollow stub, where he loves to lie and soak in the fall sunshine; and one favorite giant tree with the deepest and warmest hollow, which he invariably uses for his long winter sleep. And besides all these he has at least one tower of refuge near every path of his, to which he can betake himself when sudden danger threatens from dogs or men.|$|E
