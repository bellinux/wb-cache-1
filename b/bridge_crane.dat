40|$|A new {{mathematical}} {{model of a}} 3 DOF 2 D mechanical system “transported cross-beam, two moving bridge cranes” has been proposed. Small system oscillations have been derived through the introduction of Lagrange equations. The numerical estimation of 3 DOF system motion {{has been carried out}} with equation-based Modelica language. The present article uses the Lagrange method and numerical and optimization methods, realized with JModelica. org and Optimica freeware. The absolute swaying of the cross-beam with respect to the displacement of the two moving <b>bridge</b> <b>cranes</b> was estimated. The phase portraits of the 3 DOF system for linear and angular coordinates were presented. An open loop optimal control problem was posed for the motion of the <b>bridge</b> <b>cranes.</b> A “bang-bang” control strategy was implemented for the derivation of an optimal control solution, which enables the travel of two <b>bridge</b> <b>cranes</b> at a prescribed distance for minimum time and minimum swaying of a heavy cross-beam. The derived results of the numerical simulation can be easily practically realized by crane operators with good agreement with simple engineering estimations. The proposed control strategy enables synchronous motion of two <b>bridge</b> <b>cranes</b> with a cross-beam that practically solves the posed problem of unwanted excessive oscillations of a heavy cross-beam during transportation...|$|R

50|$|An {{overhead}} crane, {{commonly called}} a <b>bridge</b> <b>crane,</b> {{is a type}} of crane found in industrial environments. An overhead crane consists of parallel runways with a traveling bridge spanning the gap. A hoist, the lifting component of a crane, travels along the bridge.
