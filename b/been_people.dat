25|$|Although {{there have}} <b>been</b> <b>people</b> in Rhône-Alpes since pre-historic times, the {{earliest}} recorded settlers {{of the region}} were the Gauls (Celts). Cities such as Lyon were founded by them and the region traded with both northern and southern Europe.

Lyon itself became a major city in the Roman Empire.|$|E

He planned to finish the story in approximately 30 chapters, ending with Kenshin's departure from Tokyo in a similar manner to the one from volume 7. Kenshin's enemies would have <b>been</b> <b>people</b> from Kyoto who would send an assassin to kill Kenshin. When the Oniwabanshū were introduced during the serialization, Watsuki noted that the series could be longer as he had created various main characters.

25|$|While {{there have}} <b>been</b> <b>people</b> {{throughout}} history who challenged {{the assessment of}} taxes as beyond {{the power of the}} government, the modern tax-protester movement began after World War II. One of the first people to fit this description was Vivien Kellems, a Connecticut industrialist and political activist who specifically protested monthly tax withholding. In 1948 she refused to withhold taxes from the wages of her employees, based on the claim that the government had no power to require such withholding. The IRS then seized the money owed from her bank account. She brought suit against them and, in a book she wrote, asserted that she won, although she did not challenge the constitutionality of tax withholding itself.|$|E

500|$|Besides the Baltic Veneti (see Poland in Antiquity article), {{ancient and}} medieval authors {{speak of the}} East European, or Slavic Venethi. It can be {{inferred}} from Tacitus' description in Germania that his [...] "Venethi" [...] possibly lived around the middle Dnieper basin, which in his times would correspond to the Proto-Slavic Zarubintsy cultural sphere. Jordanes, to whom the Venethi meant Slavs, wrote of past fighting between the Ostrogoths and the Venethi that {{took place during the}} third quarter of the 4th century in today's Ukraine. At that time, the Venethi therefore would have <b>been</b> <b>people</b> of the Kiev culture. The Venethi, Jordanes reported, [...] "now rage in war far and wide, in punishment for our sins", and were at that time made obedient to the Gothic king Hermanaric. Jordanes' 6th-century description of the [...] "populous race of the Venethi" [...] includes indications of their dwelling places in the regions near the northern ridge of the Carpathian Mountains and stretching from there [...] "almost endlessly" [...] east, while in the western direction reaching the sources of the Vistula. More specifically, he designates the area between the Vistula and the lower Danube as the country of the Sclaveni. [...] "They have swamps and forests for their cities" [...] (hi paludes silvasque pro civitatibus habent), he added sarcastically. The [...] "bravest of these peoples", the Antes, settled the lands between the Dniester and the Dnieper rivers. The Venethi were the third Slavic branch of an unspecified location (most likely of the Kolochin culture), as well as the overall designation for the totality of the Slavic peoples, who [...] "though off-shoots from one stock, have now three names".|$|E

Both Dark Willow and even Willow herself state that Willow's sacrifices for her friends and lack of assertiveness are her undoing.

She was last seen wearing grey tracksuit bottoms, a white, long sleeved T-shirt and black Nike trainers... We will interview friends, her boyfriend and all her associates." [...] Ross Hemphill, who hadn't seen Nelson {{on the day of the}} murder, was interviewed by detectives and ruled out as a suspect. Police began checking CCTV and telephone records as well as interviewing friends and family and carrying out house-to-house enquiries. Witnesses reported seeing a fire on Monkey Hill at around 11.20pm on the night of the murder. D/Supt Robertson said: [...] "We know there was a fire at 11.20pm on Saturday in exactly the spot where Zoe was found. You would need local knowledge to go there.

2500|$|Regarding {{the charge}} of sexual impropriety, the Spokesman Review of August 26, 1984 quotes Bishop Schuckardt says [...] "Schuckardt denied the allegations. He said the charges {{are part of a}} plot by Chicoine to {{discredit}} him and seize control of the church... (The charges) sicken me because there's not a word of truth to it at all." [...] Schuckardt's defenders point out the difficulty of proving a negative. How does one prove that an accusation is false, when by its very nature it excludes the possibility of either physical evidence or witnesses? Furthermore, it is accepted science that sexual predators are incurable, therefore if Bishop Schuckardt was a sexual predator, as some claim, surely over the last 21 years at least one more accusation would have surfaced, especially when considering that there have <b>been</b> <b>people</b> who left the Schuckardt faction between 1984 and 2004 who are very hostile towards him; but no new accusations have surfaced. In 1987 all of the Religious men, seminarians and boys that were boarding with the seminarians, were individually questioned by the Sheriff's Department and the FBI regarding this particular accusation, but nothing of concern was found (Calif. Case #87-2823). They further claim that even if the accusations were true, the authority given to the Church by Christ is not contingent upon the personal sanctity or impeccability of the hierarchy exercising that authority.|$|E
2500|$|The Tsarevich {{was less}} than a month shy of his fourteenth {{birthday}} when he was murdered on 17 July 1918 in the cellar room of the Ipatiev House in Yekaterinburg. The assassination was carried out by forces of the Bolshevik secret police under Yakov Yurovsky. According to one account of the murder, the family was told to get up and get dressed {{in the middle of the}} night because they were going to be moved. Nicholas II carried Alexei to the cellar room. His mother asked for chairs to be brought so that she and Alexei could sit down. When the family and their servants were settled, Yurovsky announced that they were to be executed. The firing squad first killed Nicholas, the Tsarina, and the two male servants. Alexei remained sitting in the chair, [...] "terrified," [...] before the assassins turned on him and shot at him repeatedly. The boy remained alive and the killers tried to stab him multiple times with bayonets. [...] "Nothing seemed to work," [...] wrote Yurovsky later. [...] "Though injured, he continued to live." [...] Unbeknownst to the killing squad, the Tsarevich's torso was protected by a shirt wrapped in precious gems that he wore beneath his tunic. Finally Yurovsky fired two shots into the boy's head, and he fell silent. Rumors of Alexei's survival began to circulate when the bodies of his family and the royal servants were located. Alexei's was missing, along with that of one of his sisters (generally thought to be Maria or Anastasia). As a result of this, there have <b>been</b> <b>people</b> who have pretended to be the Tsarevich; these people are Alexei Poutziato, Joseph Veres, Heino Tammet, Michael Goleniewski and Vassili Filatov. However, scientists considered it extremely unlikely that he escaped death, due to his lifelong hemophilia. The missing bodies were said to have been cremated, though scientists believe it would have been impossible to completely cremate the bodies given the short amount of time and the materials the killing squad had to work with. Numerous searches of the forest surrounding Yekaterinburg up until 2007 failed to turn up the cremation site or the remains of Alexei and his sister.|$|E
