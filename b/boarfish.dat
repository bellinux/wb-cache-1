50|$|<b>Boarfishes</b> {{are a small}} family, Caproidae, {{of marine}} fishes {{comprising}} two genera and 12 species. They were formerly placed in the order Zeiformes with the dories, but are now placed with the Perciformes since they have many perciform characteristics, for instance in the caudal skeleton. <b>Boarfishes</b> are native to the Indian, Atlantic, and Pacific Oceans, where they are mainly found at depths below 50 m.|$|R
50|$|The <b>boarfishes</b> (Caproidae) {{have been}} {{included}} in this order though they are currently included in the Perciformes.|$|R
50|$|<b>Boarfishes</b> {{have deep}} and thin bodies. They are small, {{with only a}} few species known to reach a maximum total length of 30 cm. Their {{coloration}} is red, pink, and silvery.|$|R

5000|$|Antigonia is a genus of <b>boarfishes,</b> {{the largest}} genus in its family. These are deep-water species, {{generally}} found at depths below 50 m. Various extinct species were once placed within Antigonia, but {{have since been}} removed to Eoantigonia and Proantigonia ...|$|R
50|$|Spawning {{primarily}} {{occurs in}} the summer along both the Atlantic and the U. Gulf of Mexico coasts, with peaks during July and August. Large congregations of tripletails {{during the summer months}} in the inshore and nearshore waters of coastal Georgia suggest this area is a critical estuarian spawning habitat for the species. Larval Atlantic tripletails go though four levels of development; preflexion, flexion, postflexion, and transformation. By the time the larvae reach 0.16 in (4 mm), they have large eyes and concave heads. The larval forms of Atlantic tripletails resemble those of <b>boarfishes,</b> some jacks, spadefishes, and bass.|$|R
50|$|Parazanclistius hutchinsi, the Hutchin's <b>boarfish</b> {{or short}} <b>boarfish,</b> is {{a species of}} armorhead endemic to the {{southern}} coast of Western Australia. It is found on the continental shelf at depths from 10 to 80 m. This species grows to a total length of 34 cm, {{and is the only}} known member of its genus.|$|E

5000|$|After {{repair and}} refit {{alongside}} , she departed on 5 July for her fourth war patrol. Operating in a coordinated attack group <b>Boarfish,</b> , and [...] covered the Java Sea off Java {{and the north}} coast of Bali. They made no surface contacts but encountered a number of enemy planes, one of which depth-bombed <b>Boarfish</b> on 8 July. On the 29th, <b>Boarfish</b> performed lifeguard duties during an Allied air strike on Singapore, and she remained off the Malay coast patrolling until 6 August, when she set course for Subic Bay. The submarine pulled alongside [...] for refit on 10 August and was there when the Japanese capitulation was announced.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Boarfish</b> {{sailed to}} the South China Sea {{to patrol the}} coast of French Indochina. Early on 21 January, the submarine's radar picked up a small convoy {{of five or six}} small ships. <b>Boarfish</b> closed the convoy three times in three hours, firing 16 torpedoes, all of which {{apparently}} passed under the targets. She broke off the attack at daybreak and did not regain contact. On 31 January, the boat made another radar contact on two cargo ships under escort. During Boarfish’s initial approach, an escort sighted the submarine and chased her away. The boat then fired her torpedoes at periscope depth and scored hits on both ships. When <b>Boarfish</b> submerged to avoid the escorts, she left Enki Maru (6,968 tons) sinking and Taietsu Maru (6,890 tons) burning fiercely and beached nearby. Even while avoiding depth charges, <b>Boarfish</b> tried to close the beach to finish the job. She abandoned the attempt after 36 hours because fire had so ravaged the cargo ship that she seemed unsalvageable. Taietsu Maru was destroyed completely by American planes of the 14th Air Force later that same day, and <b>Boarfish</b> received partial credit for the sinking. The submarine ended her first patrol on 15 February when she pulled into Fremantle, Australia, for refit alongside submarine tender [...]|$|E

50|$|Operation Blue Nose {{consisted}} of the submarines USS <b>BOARFISH</b> (SS-327), USS CAIMAN (SS-323), and USS CABEZON (SS-334), and submarine tender USS NEREUS (AS-17) took part in CTG 17.3 Operation Blue Nose operated under-ice in the Chukchi Sea. They were {{under the command of}} RADM Allan R. McCann, Commander, Submarine Force, U.S. Pacific or COMSUBPAC. Their mission was the first exploration under the Polar Ice Cap in the Chukchi Sea.  USS <b>BOARFISH</b> was the flag ship and was specially equipped and trained in the Navys effort to explore and develop a submarine under-ice operational capability in the harsh arctic environment. Special sonar developed by the Arctic Submarine Laboratory was installed on USS <b>BOARFISH.</b>  Dr. Waldo K.

50|$|Following {{shakedown}} {{training off}} the coast of New England, the submarine departed New London, Conn. on 29 October 1944 for Panama. After a week of intensive training in Panamanian waters, <b>Boarfish</b> transited the Panama Canal on 21 November and set out for Pearl Harbor where she arrived on 2 December. Another three weeks of training in Hawaii followed, and then <b>Boarfish</b> stood out of Pearl Harbor on 24 December bound for the western Pacific. She refueled and took on provisions at Saipan before embarking upon her first war patrol on 5 January 1945.|$|E
50|$|<b>Boarfish</b> {{remained}} in the San Diego area until 15 November 1947 except for one cruise to Pearl Harbor in February 1947 and another to Alaska and Canada between July and November. Commensing 30 July 1947 <b>Boarfish</b> was the flagship of the first exploration under the Polar Ice Cap in the Bering Strait, this mission designated as Task Group 17.3 Operation Blue Nose {{under the command of}} R. Adm. Allan Rockwell McCann for the purpose of testing the under-ice use of Sonar, developed by Dr. Waldo K. Lyon, director of the Arctic Submarine Laboratory, who was also aboard. On 15 November, the submarine entered the Mare Island Naval Shipyard for overhaul before transfer to the Turkish Navy. She left Mare Island on 21 February 1948 and steamed via San Diego, Panama, New London, Malta, and Port Argostoli, Greece, to Izmir, Turkey. On 23 May, <b>Boarfish</b> was decommissioned and immediately recommissioned in the Turkish Navy as TCG Sakarya (S 332), the second submarine named in honor of the 1921 Battle of Sakarya.|$|E
50|$|<b>Boarfish</b> {{was struck}} from the Naval Register on 20 May 1948, and {{transferred}} (sold) to Turkey under {{terms of the}} Security Assistance Program, 23 August 1948. She was returned to US custody for scrapping, 1 January 1974.|$|E
5000|$|USS <b>BOARFISH</b> {{demonstrated}} that extended under-ice navigation was entirely practical. Afterwards Dr. Lyon concluded, “I {{believe that the}} problem of submarine adaptation to polar seas has been formulated and that the submarine shows promise of unusual tactical advantage.” ...|$|E
50|$|In {{describing}} Kyphosichthys, Xu and Wu compared {{its body}} form to modern day deep-bodied fish {{such as the}} <b>boarfish</b> and butterflyfish (Chaetodon sp.), and inferred that Kyphosichthys was similarly a slow swimmer but highly maneuverable, likely adapted to structurally complex habitats.|$|E
50|$|On 01 AUG 1947, USS <b>BOARFISH</b> {{conducted}} the first under-ice transit of an ice floe in the Chukchi Sea, which was relatively unexplored at the time, {{while the other}} ships mapped its perimeter.  At 2:39 PM at 72° 05 N 168° 42 W <b>BOARFISH</b> commenced a stationary dive and underwater transit of the ice floe. The transit took over an hour and average ice thickness was eight to ten feet thick with the deepest reading being eighteen feet thick. When {{she got to the}} other side she conducted a vertical surface. Due to the high risk of placing the submarine in danger for science, RADM McCann was on board to take responsibility if something went wrong.|$|E
50|$|<b>Boarfish</b> (SS-327) {{was laid}} down on 12 August 1943; {{launched}} on 21 May 1944 by Electric Boat Co., Groton, Conn., sponsored by Miss Barbara Walsh, daughter of Senator Arthur Walsh of New Jersey; and commissioned on 23 September 1944, Commander Royce L. Gross in command.|$|E
