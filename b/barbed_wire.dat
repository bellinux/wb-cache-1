TNA advertised the <b>Barbed</b> <b>Wire</b> Massacre between Abyss and Sabu on the November19 episode of Impact!. The {{reasoning}} behind the match stipulation {{had to do}} with Abyss fearing <b>barbed</b> <b>wire</b> in the storyline. Abyss challenged this fear on the December3 episode of Impact!, by bashing Sabu over the head with a <b>barbed</b> <b>wire</b> wrapped steal chair. Sabu defeated Abyss at the event to end their rivalry.|$|E

5|$|The Joseph F. Glidden House {{is located}} in the United States in the DeKalb County, Illinois city of DeKalb. It was the home to the famed {{inventor}} of <b>barbed</b> <b>wire</b> Joseph Glidden. The barn, still located on the property near several commercial buildings, is said to be where Glidden perfected his improved version of <b>barbed</b> <b>wire</b> which would eventually transform him into a successful entrepreneur. The Glidden House was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. The home was designed by another <b>barbed</b> <b>wire</b> patent holder in DeKalb, Jacob Haish.|$|E

5|$|Unsuitable {{backyard}} {{fruit tree}} netting also kills many animals and may {{bring them into}} close contact with humans, but can be avoided by using wildlife-safe netting. <b>Barbed</b> <b>wire</b> may also lead to casualties; this can be ameliorated by removing old or unnecessary <b>barbed</b> <b>wire</b> or marking it with bright paint.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} years border fortifications inside the city mostly {{consisted}} of brick walls with a top made of <b>barbed</b> <b>wire.</b> Clay bricks and concrete slabs were used for construction. Further obstacles of <b>barbed</b> <b>wire</b> and upstate walls delimitated the East and at some places, like Bernauer Straße, bricked-up buildings formed the boundary line. The buildings were situated on East-Berlin territory, whereas the pavement {{in front of the}} houses belonged to West-Berlin. In many places safety installations of West-Berlin's outer ring consisted of metal fences and <b>barbed</b> <b>wire</b> barriers. Technologically advanced upgrading took place later on and only in 1975 L-shaped concrete segments that were known from the fall of the Wall were added.|$|E
5|$|Judas Mesias and Abyss {{continued}} their feud heading into Against All Odds. There, Abyss fought Mesias in the second-ever <b>Barbed</b> <b>Wire</b> Massacre. Abyss won the contest, ending the feud.|$|E

5|$|Next was a Hardcore {{match between}} Randy Orton and Cactus Jack for the WWE Intercontinental Championship. One {{spot in the}} match saw Cactus lie a <b>barbed</b> <b>wire</b> {{baseball}} bat between Orton's legs and perform a leg drop. Cactus continued to use the bat, as he poured gasoline on it and tried to light it on fire. Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff interrupted and informed Cactus {{that he would be}} disqualified and the event would end if he lit the bat on fire. Orton executed an RKO on Cactus onto the <b>barbed</b> <b>wire</b> baseball bat to retain the title.|$|E
5000|$|Gurgen Mahari (Gurgen Grigori Ajemian; August 1, 1903 in Van [...] - [...] June 17, 1969 in Yerevan) was an Armenian {{writer and}} poet. His most {{significant}} works include the semi-autobiographical novella <b>Barbed</b> <b>Wires</b> in Blossom (1968) and the novel Burning Orchards (1966), {{which is set}} in the writer's hometown of Van {{on the eve of the}} Armenian Genocide.|$|R
50|$|Electrified <b>barbed</b> <b>wires</b> {{were used}} to block the main {{entrance}} to the community along with old burnt out cars and sharp metal scraps and cement. These barriers were further fortified {{by the use of}} IEDs made from cooking gas cylinders armed with electronically detonated fuses. Manholes were uncovered and filled with spikes and the roads were lined with hidden IEDs made from somatol explosives.|$|R
60|$|Now old Granny Fox {{knew all}} about that old fence-post and she remembered all about those <b>barbed</b> <b>wires</b> {{fastened}} to it. Although they were covered with snow she knew just about where they lay, and just before she reached them she stopped plunging down into the snow. Reddy Fox knew about those wires; too, {{but he was so}} excited that he forgot all about them.|$|R
5|$|An {{unexpected}} {{bonus of}} the Bruneval raid was the Germans' {{efforts to improve}} defences at Würzburg stations and prevent similar attacks. The radars were surrounded by rings of <b>barbed</b> <b>wire</b> which increased their visibility from the air, making them easier to target prior to Operation Overlord.|$|E
5|$|The 42nd Division's {{participation}} in the Meuse-Argonne Offensive began on 14 October when it attacked with both brigades. That evening, a conference was called to discuss the attack, during which Charles Pelot Summerall, commander of the First Infantry Division and V Corps, telephoned and demanded that Châtillon be taken by 18:00 the next evening. An aerial photograph had been obtained that showed {{a gap in the}} German <b>barbed</b> <b>wire</b> to the northeast of Châtillon. Lieutenant Colonel Walter E. Bare—the commander of the 167th Infantry—proposed an attack from that direction, where the defenses seemed least imposing, covered by a machine-gun barrage. MacArthur adopted this plan. He was wounded, but not severely, while verifying the existence of the gap in the <b>barbed</b> <b>wire.</b>|$|E
5|$|The second-ever <b>Barbed</b> <b>Wire</b> Massacre was {{promoted}} for Against All Odds between Abyss and Judas Mesias. The feud for this match began in mid-2007 when Abyss' former manager Father James Mitchell returned {{and began a}} storyline with Abyss. Mesias made his debut on the September 13, 2007 episode of Impact! attacking Abyss {{at the request of}} Mitchell. After months of inactivity, Mesias returned on the December 13, 2007 episode of Impact! attacking Abyss. At Final Resolution, Mesias defeated Abyss with help from Mitchell. On the January 24 episode of Impact!, Mitchell finally announced his reasons for feuding with Abyss, that he was Abyss' father and Mesias was Abyss' half-brother in the narrative. TNA promoted a <b>Barbed</b> <b>Wire</b> Massacre match between Abyss and Mesias at Against All Odds sometime after this.|$|E
50|$|These {{suggestions}} {{were incorporated}} in the plan without change. From September onwards Pakistani forces had begun to fortify positions with concrete bunkers, anti-tank ditches, land mines and <b>barbed</b> <b>wires.</b> Spiked bamboo was also used, and some areas were flooded to hinder enemy movements. Engineering battalions were sent to construct fortified positions, {{although some of the}} strong points and fortresses (especially those inside the Dhaka outer-defense line) remained incomplete.|$|R
50|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1940, Stanisław Hadyna met her for the last time, asking {{what would happen to}} the world. As he wrote in his book, Pilchowa began weeping and shaking, then she said in a quiet voice: This all is horrible. They are burning people in furnaces. Thousands of people, whole trainloads. They are chased across the forests and snow, behind <b>barbed</b> <b>wires</b> of camps. They are shooting. Pits filled with dead bodies.|$|R

5|$|The {{village of}} Villy lies about one {{kilometer}} {{to the northwest}} of ouvrage La Ferté. Villy itself was fortified {{with more than a}} dozen blockhouses, along with networks of <b>barbed</b> <b>wire</b> and tank obstacles. The blockhouses were primarily prepared, reinforced firing positions and did not necessarily possess fixed armament.|$|E
5|$|With all the {{evidence}} pointing to an impending Turkish assault, the ANZAC troops were ordered to stand-to at 03:00, half an hour earlier than normal, and they improvised defences by throwing out rolls of <b>barbed</b> <b>wire</b> on rests {{to the front of}} their lines.|$|E
5|$|World War I saw great {{changes in}} the use of cavalry. The mode of warfare changed, and the use of trench warfare, <b>barbed</b> <b>wire</b> and machine guns {{rendered}} traditional cavalry almost obsolete. Tanks, introduced in 1917, began to take over the role of shock combat.|$|E
50|$|Through British Military Administration, the Settlement was rebuilt in 1952. All {{houses and}} shelters {{around the area}} were torn down and the {{population}} resettled in a <b>barbed</b> <b>wired</b> area about 0.5 sq mi around the new shops. This was {{the implementation of the}} Briggs Plans of starving the CPM into surrender. This new town ship was named Pekan Gurney in honour of Henry Gurney, the High Commissioner who was gunned down on his way to Fraser's Hill.|$|R
40|$|In {{the summer}} 1945, Displaced Persons camps in Germany epitomized {{a place of}} {{contrasts}} and paradoxes. DPs still languished behind <b>barbed</b> <b>wires</b> after the Allied armies had liberated the concentration camps. The military had assumed that practically all of the Displaced Persons {{would be sent to}} their countries of origin. In the spring and summer 1945, 65   000 DPs were sent back home every day and almost six million were repatriated in September 1945. Accurate statistics are impossible, yet, acco [...] ...|$|R
50|$|Vanni Mouse is a {{short film}} {{following}} the journey of two mice which flew from the wood of Vanni. The two inseparable couple end unfortunately in an internment camp (Manik Farm) located in Vavuniya (Sri Lanka) where hundreds of thousands tamils are imprisoned by the Sri Lankan government. These two mice witness the tragedy of many innocent civilians behind the <b>barbed</b> <b>wires,</b> which remains as unspoken truth. Whether the two will escape from the terrifying environment is the climax of this short film.|$|R
5|$|Crossing {{points in}} the defence network– bridges, tunnels and other weak spots– were called nodes or points of resistance. These were {{fortified}} with removable road blocks, <b>barbed</b> <b>wire</b> entanglements, and land mines. These passive defences were overlooked by trench works, gun and mortar emplacements, and pillboxes. In places entire villages were fortified using barriers of scaffolding, sandbagged positions and loopholes in existing buildings.|$|E
5|$|Cubes, {{cylinders}} and pimples {{were deployed}} in long rows, often several rows deep, to form anti-tank barriers at beaches and inland. They {{were also used}} in smaller numbers to block roads. They frequently sported loops at the top for the attachment of <b>barbed</b> <b>wire.</b> There was also a tetrahedral or caltrop-shaped obstacle, although it seems these were rare.|$|E
5|$|The Bulgarian {{high command}} {{did not attempt}} to perform a spoiling attack as they lacked the {{necessary}} vehicles and pack animals. The barrage did not cause a significant number of casualties but severely affected the Bulgarian esprit de corps. On the night between 14 and 15 September, Franco-Serbian patrols reported that the artillery barrage had dealt sufficient damage to the <b>barbed</b> <b>wire</b> entanglements separating the trenches.|$|E
5000|$|During the battle, Colonel Gilles used a new tactic, called [...] "the {{hedgehog}}" [...] (le hérisson), for {{the first}} time in Indochina. The hedgehog defense consisted of an outpost surrounded by several armed positions (point d'appui or P.A.). The objective was to provoke an enemy frontal assault, rather than fighting off hit-and-run attacks or falling into ambushes. Nà Sản's hedgehog consisted of 30 P.A. with a complicated trench system, enforced with <b>barbed</b> <b>wires.</b> Its defense forces consisted of 11 battalions (15,000 men) and 6 artillery batteries.|$|R
5000|$|Like many {{futurist}} artists {{during the}} 30s, Thayaht was {{at some point}} a supporter of fascist dictator Benito Mussolini: His famous painting [...] "Il grande Nocchiere" [...] (The great Helmsman) depicts an almost robot-like, muscular figure of Mussolini, holding the giant steering wheel of some fantastic craft, while in the sky above him, {{a long line of}} Savoia Marchetti S 55 Catamaran seaplanes (of the type used by air Marshal Italo Balbo for his propaganda transatlantic flights) soars into a sky criscrossed by <b>barbed</b> <b>wires.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Under the {{leadership}} of General John Pershing, the Americans held their ground from repeated German attacks. Private Claudio took part in these crucial battles in the Marne Offensive. Flak guns blackened the skies, artillery shells pounded [...] "No Man's Land", <b>barbed</b> <b>wires</b> left mutilated hands and gunpowder and blood mixed together. In the ensuing battle, Claudio was killed by enemy fire on June 29, 1918 in Château-Thierry, France. The Tomas Claudio Colleges in Morong, Rizal, Philippines, {{which was founded in}} 1950, was named in his honor.|$|R
