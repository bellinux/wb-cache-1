40|$|In the British Isles the {{majority}} of volcanic rocks <b>bearing</b> <b>upper</b> mantle and lower crustal xenoliths occur in Scotland. Most of the occurrences are of Carboniferous-Permian age and provide unusually early examples of basalt-hosted mantle xenoliths. The paper presents new data on the mineral chemistry of spinel lherzolite xenoliths from fourteen localities spanning the five principal tectonic terranes composing Scotland. These supplement previously presented trace element and isotopic data that have demonstrated the broad lateral heterogeneity of the sub-continental lithospheric mantle (SCLM), e. g. Menzies & Halliday, (1988). Compositional variations among the four principal minerals emphasize the heterogeneity. The remarkable range of Al 2 O 3 vs CaO exhibited by the clinopyroxenes compared to data from other ‘xenolith provinces’ emphasizes the extremely complex magmatic history of the Scottish lithosphere. The general increase in age from southern and central Scotland (Southern Upland and Midland Valley Terranes) to the older Northern Highland and Hebridean Terranes of the north and north-west, with concomitant complexity of geological history is reflected by trace element and isotopic studies. Reaction relationships in lherzolites from Loch Roag, Hebridean Terrane, due to pervasive metasomatism, involve secondary growth of sodic feldspar. These {{are related to the}} passage of carbonatitic melts as deduced by Long et al., (1991). The relationship between the upper mantle and lower crust is reviewed in the light of xenolith evidence. The majority of the pyroxenitic xenoliths are inferred to have formed as cumulates from underplating magmas. It is deduced that these compose a basal crustal layer with a generally sharp discontinuity to the dominantly lherzolitic mantle rocks beneath. A second discontinuity is inferred to separate the pyroxenitic layer from overlying, broadly cognate meta-gabbroic cumulates (‘basic granulites’). The two discontinuities are considered to represent a petrological and a seismic Moho respectively...|$|E
40|$|An {{analysis}} of the Predynastic cemetery of el-Gerzeh: social identities and mortuary practices during {{the spread of the}} 'Naqada culture"' by Alice Stevenson The archaeological investigation into the remains of the Predynastic Egyptian cemetery of el-Gerzeh (3600 BC- 3350 BC) is the basis for this thesis. The site was excavated in 1911 by the British School of Archaeology in Egypt, and became the eponymous site for that time. Despite the site's apparent importance, the published account was brief. Fortunately, the field-notes and cemetery map are extant, as are some of the artefacts excavated. Using these sources it is has been possible to reevaluate the site and its significance. The dissertation is divided into three parts. Part I provides an overview of the evidence and assesses its chronological and spatial context. The data provide the opportunity to date one of the earliest substantial cemeteries <b>bearing</b> <b>Upper</b> Egyptian traits in Lower Egypt and this is addressed using cuiTent chronological models, mapping of horizontal stratigraphy and seriation of ceramic types. The dating of the site, however, is not an end in itself. Rather, it is a control for this thesis' main area of interest; the consideration of the identity of, and identities within, the community bmied here and this forms the basis for Pat 1 s II and Ill. Relevant sub-issues that are also discussed include scale, and the significance of funerary rituals to society, such as social memory, and how this is interpreted archaeologically. Group identity is the focus of Part II, and is viewed through the concepts of ethnicity and migration, emphasising the need to consider material culture as a correlate and medium of social practice. The material construction of the bmials, {{and the manner in which}} grave goods were manipulated dming the funeral, are compared with Upper and Lower Egyptian contexts and are used as evidence to argue that the community buried at Gerzeh were most likely migrants who were deeply embedded within Upper Egyptian traditions. Part Ill looks at the differences between graves within the cemetery as evidence for differential responses to age and social status. It is argued that previous attempts to interpret Predynastic mortuary evidence in these terms have been limited and over-simplified, a correlate partly, of employing outdated models. By appealing to more recent discussions in archaeology and anthropology a critical examination of these issues is presented. Using statistical methodologies, together with thick description of individual burial contexts, the complexity of mortuary practices and their significance for interpretation of identities are emphasised...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{challenges}} {{in order to make}} electric cars competitive with gas-powered cars is in the improvement of the electric power system. Although many of the energy sources currently used in electric vehicles have sufficientlyhigh specific energy, their applicability is limited due to low specific power. It would therefore be advantageous to create a driveline with the main energy storage separated from a smaller energy buffer, designed to have high power capabilities and to withstand frequent and deep discharge cycles. It has been found that rotating kinetic energy storage in flywheels is very well suited for this type of application. A composite shell, comprising an inner part made of glassfiber and an outer part made of carbonfiber, was analyzed analytically and numerically, designed, and constructed. The shell was fitted onto a metallic rotor using shrinkfitting. The cost of the shell, and the complexity of assembly, was reduced by winding the glass- and carbonfiber consecutively on a mandrel, and curing the complete assembly simultaneously. Thereby, the shell obtained an internal segmentation, without the need for fitting several concentric parts onto each other. The radial stress inside the composite shell was kept compressive thanks to a novel approach of using the permanent magnets of the integrated electric machine to provide radial mechanical load during rotation. Two thrust <b>bearing</b> units (one <b>upper</b> and one lower) comprising one segmented unit with the permanent magnets in a cylindrical Halbach configuration and one non-segmented unit in a up/down configuration were optimized, constructed and tested. Each thrust bearing unit generated 1040 N of repelling force, and a positive axial stiffness of 169 N/mm at the nominal airgap of 5 mm.   Two radial active magnetic <b>bearings</b> (one <b>upper</b> and one lower) were optimized, constructed and tested. By parameterizing the shape of the actuators, a numerical optimization of force over resistive loss from the bias currentcould be performed. The optimized shape of the electromagnets was produced by watercutting sheets of laminated steel. A maximum current stiffness of 120 N/A at a bias current of 1. 5 A was achieved...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. - In the Bigadiç volcano-sedimentary basin, Palaeozoic-Mesozoic {{basement}} {{rocks are}} overlain unconformably by the Miocene rock units. The straligraphic sequence of Miocene units, {{from the bottom}} to the top in ascending order is, basement volcanic unit, basement limestone unit, lower tuff unit, lower borate <b>bearing</b> unit, <b>upper</b> tuff unit, <b>upper</b> borate <b>bearing</b> unit, and basalt unit. Miocene units are over-lain unconformably by the recent sediments, and alluvium rests unconformably on the recent sediments. In the region, Palaeozoic and Meso-zoic basement rocks were subjected to block faulting and dislocation during the pre-Miocene. As {{a result of these}} movements, large and small sized several playa lake type sedimentation basins were formed, and Miocene sediments were deposited in these basins. In the study area, the general strike of the fold axis is NE-SW. Beds generally dip towards MW or SE with 5 °- 35 °. Borate deposits occur as two different horizons in the upper and lower borate bearing units, which are separated from each other by the upper tuff unit. In the region, the lower and upper borate zones show thickness varying between 35 - 130 meters and 20 - 110 meters, respectively. Boron ores are alternated with clay-stone, mudstone, tuff and thin-bedded limestone, and generally exhibit lenticular structures. Colemanite and ulexite are the dominant ore minerals in both of the ore zones. In addition to these, other boron minerals such as pandermite, probertite, howlite, tunellite, meyerhoffente, hydroboracite and inyoite have also been determined in the basin. Colemanite in the lower and upper borate zones have possibly precipitated directly from the solutions contemporaneous with sedimentation, within the unconsolidated sediments under the sediment/water interface. Nodules continued to develop, parallel to the compaction of sediments. Formation of ulexite resembles that of colemanite and it reflects the period when Na-concentration of the solution has increased...|$|R
