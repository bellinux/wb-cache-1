40|$|BACKGROUND: The Balance Evaluation Systems Test (<b>BESTest)</b> was {{recently}} created {{to allow the}} development of treatments according to the specific balance system affected in each patient. The Brazilian version of the <b>BESTest</b> has not been specifically tested after stroke. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the intra- and inter-rater reliability and concurrent and convergent validity of the total score of the <b>BESTest</b> and <b>BESTest</b> sections for adults with hemiparesis after stroke. METHOD: The study included 16 subjects (61. 1 &# 177; 7. 5 years) with chronic hemiparesis (54. 5 &# 177; 43. 5 months after stroke). The <b>BESTest</b> was administered by two raters in the same week {{and one of the}} raters repeated the test after a one-week interval. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was calculated to assess intra- and interrater reliability. Concurrent validity with the Berg Balance Scale (BBS) and convergent validity with the Activities-specific Balance Confidence scale (ABC-Brazil) were assessed using Pearson's correlation coefficient. RESULTS: Both the <b>BESTest</b> total score (ICC= 0. 98) and the <b>BESTest</b> sections (ICC between 0. 85 and 0. 96) have excellent intrarater reliability. Interrater reliability for the total score was excellent (ICC= 0. 93) and, for the sections, it ranged between 0. 71 and 0. 94. The correlation coefficient between the <b>BESTest</b> and the BBS and ABC-Brazil were 0. 78 and 0. 59, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The Brazilian version of the <b>BESTest</b> demonstrated adequate reliability when measured by sections and could identify what balance system was affected in patients after stroke. Concurrent validity was excellent with the BBS total score and good to excellent with the sections. The total scores but not the sections present adequate convergent validity with the ABC-Brazil. However, other psychometric properties should be further investigated...|$|R

40|$|Matt D. Paxton, Adam J. Alfaro, Kady E. Dieringer Baker University, Baldwin City, Kansas Limited {{range of}} motion (ROM) is often {{considered}} detrimental to both athletic performance and everyday function similar to balance. PURPOSE: The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine a relationship between hip {{range of motion}} and <b>BESTest</b> scores. METHODS: 20 college age women (19. 55 ± 3. 45 years) with no prior lower extremity injuries or previous concussions volunteered for this study. Using standard goniometer measuring techniques, participants passive range of motion for flexion (FL), extension (EX), internal rotation (IR) and external rotation (ER) was established and compared to scores from the <b>BESTest</b> (Balance Evaluation Systems) to determine a correlation. Overall <b>BESTest</b> scores were compared to each aspect of hip musculature ROM. RESULTS: Although there was no significant correlation between any specific aspect of ROM and overall <b>BESTest</b> scores (P 3 ̆e 0. 05), both right and left internal rotation showed a statistically significant moderate correlation (R= 0. 52 (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) and, R= 0. 51 (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) respectively) to stability in gait. DISCUSSION: Despite no correlation between overall <b>BESTest</b> score and range of motion, internal rotation was shown to have a statistically significant moderate correlation to a single aspect of the <b>BESTest,</b> stability in gait. We determined that range of motion does not pose as a limiting factor to balance as measured by the <b>BESTest...</b>|$|R

One person was identified who has inherited the <b>Best's</b> disease haplotype from his affected mother. Fundus examination and electrophysiological tests have repeatedly been performed in this patient but failed to show any signs of the disease. Based on these findings we have jointly estimated the most likely order of the <b>Best's</b> disease locus relative to the closet flanking markers at various penetrance values.
