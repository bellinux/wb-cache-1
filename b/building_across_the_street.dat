5|$|Under {{the reign}} of King Fuad I, two laws were passed that reorganized the {{educational}} structure at al-Azhar. The first of these, in 1930, split the school into three departments: Arabic language, sharia, and theology, with each department located in buildings outside of the mosque throughout Cairo. Additionally, formal examinations were required to earn a degree {{in one of these}} three fields of study. Six years later, a second law was passed that moved the main office for the school to a newly constructed <b>building</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> from the mosque. Additional structures were later added to supplement the three departmental buildings.|$|E

25|$|In 1984 the Bell System {{broke up}} into the various Baby Bell {{operating}} companies and AT. As {{a result of this}} divestiture in 1984, the Western Electric plant became an AT Technology Systems (AT Technology Systems) location as part of AT, supplying devices for use in the former Bell System's network. By 1984, employment had reached what would be an all-time high of 4,900. In 1988, microchip and fiber-optic component manufacturing was combined into an AT organization called AT Microelectronics. In 1989 the AT work force nationwide was 297,000 and while employment at the Reading Works was 3,200. In 1992 the Reading Works of AT Microelectronics had 3,300 workers and provided an annual payroll of $100 million. The product mix included lightwave components, linear bipolar integrated circuits, high voltage integrated circuits, high speed silicon integrated circuits, and gallium arsenide integrated circuits. A satellite manufacturing building, Building 10, was constructed on North 13th Street, just north of the General Mail Facility, in 1992. The same year the Falconer <b>building</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> was also used. AT Reading Works was the No. 2 employer in Berks County in 1993, but that was soon to end.

500|$|Numerous {{commissions}} came his way {{throughout the}} 1960s. His Jefferson Building (1225 19th Street NW), built in 1963, was an eight-story glass-and-marble clad structure {{that was the}} first skyscraper in the city to feature a columnless interior. It became home to the upscale The Palm steak restaurant in December 1972, although building's exterior reflecting pool and numerous fountains were replaced by a mundane garden and short trees. Later that year, he designed a sister <b>building</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> (1234 19th Street NW) which incorporated solarized glass windows, dark bronze panels, and dark brown aluminum ribbing. He was the chief architect of the World Building (8121 Georgia Avenue) in Silver Spring, Maryland, The World Building helped revitalize the long-blighted Silver Spring downtown business district, and became home to long-time home of top-rated radio stations WWRC and WGAY. One of Koubek's less notable efforts, however, was the 1963 five-story Del Ray Building (4905 Del Ray Avenue) in Bethesda, Maryland, a bland office building with penthouse clad in grey brick. [...] In 1964, Koubek received his first commission from outside the District of Columbia and its immediate suburbs. [...] This was Horizon House (1101 N.

500|$|At 2:27p.m., Reagan {{exited the}} hotel through [...] "President's Walk" [...] and its T Street NW exit toward his waiting {{limousine}} as Hinckley waited within {{the crowd of}} admirers. The Secret Service had extensively screened those attending the president's speech. In a [...] "colossal mistake", the agency allowed an unscreened group to stand within [...] of him, behind a rope line. Unexpectedly, Reagan passed {{right in front of}} Hinckley. Believing he would never get a better chance, Hinckley fired a Röhm RG-14 [...]22LR blue steel revolver six times in 1.7 seconds, missing the president with all six shots. The first bullet hit White House Press Secretary James Brady in the head and the second hit District of Columbia police officer Thomas Delahanty {{in the back of his}} neck as he turned to protect Reagan. Hinckley now had a clear shot at the president, but the third bullet overshot him and hit the window of a <b>building</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>street.</b> As Special Agent In Charge Jerry Parr quickly pushed Reagan into the limousine, the fourth bullet hit Secret Service agent Tim McCarthy in the abdomen as he spread his body over Reagan to make himself a target. The fifth bullet hit the bullet-resistant glass of the window on the open side door of the limousine. The sixth and final bullet ricocheted off the armored side of the limousine and hit the president in the left underarm, grazing a rib and lodging in his lung, causing it to partially collapse, and stopping less than an inch (25mm) from his heart. [...] Parr's prompt reaction had saved Reagan from being hit in the head.|$|E
