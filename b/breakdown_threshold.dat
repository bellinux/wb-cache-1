50|$|B/OB mode is an {{intermediary}} between the optical breakdown mode (OB mode) and the filamentary mode (F mode). The plasma density generated in this mode {{can go from}} 0 to the critical value i.e. optical <b>breakdown</b> <b>threshold.</b> Intensities reached inside the B/OB zone can range from multi-photon ionization threshold to the optical <b>breakdown</b> <b>threshold.</b> In the visible-IR domain, B/OB mode is obtained under very tight external focusing (high numerical aperture), to avoid self-focusing, and for intensities below optical <b>breakdown</b> <b>threshold.</b> In the UV regime, where optical breakdown intensity threshold is below self-focusing intensity threshold, tight focusing is not necessary. The shape of the ionization area {{is similar to that}} of the focal area of the beam, and can be very small (only a few micrometres). B/OB mode is possible only at short pulse durations, where AI's contribution to the total free electron population is very small. As the pulse duration becomes even shorter, the intensity domain where B/OB is possible becomes even wider.|$|E
50|$|The self-focusing {{effect is}} {{responsible}} for the most important characteristics of the dose distribution. The diameter of these filamentary ionization traces is the same within 20% (in the order of a few micrometres). Their length, their number, and their relative position are controllable parameters. The plasma density and the yield of photolytic species are believed to be homogeneously distributed along these filaments. The local intensity reached by the laser light during propagation is also practically constant along their length.The power range of operation of the F mode is above self-focusing threshold and below optical <b>breakdown</b> <b>threshold.</b> Consequently, a necessary condition for it to exist is that the self-focusing threshold must be smaller than the optical <b>breakdown</b> <b>threshold.</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract—We {{investigated}} plasma {{formation in}} distilled wa-ter by 30 -ps and 6 -ns Nd:YAG laser pulses of 1064 -nm and 532 -nm wavelength for focusing angles between 1. 7 and 32. We determined the optical <b>breakdown</b> <b>thresholds</b> and analyzed the plasma length achieved at superthreshold irradiance. The parameter range investigated covers the parameters used for intraocular laser surgery. The experimental results are com-pared to theoretical {{models for the}} calculation of <b>breakdown</b> <b>thresholds</b> and the description of plasma growth for superthresh-old breakdown. We found that at = 1064 nm the measured thresholds for both pulse durations coincide with the calcu-lated thresholds for the generation of seed electrons by mul-tiphoton ionization. The breakdown process is completed by avalanche ionization. The seed electron density required for breakdown is about 4 10 cm for the 6 -ns pulses, an...|$|R
30|$|In this study, {{aluminum}} and iron nanoparticles were seeded into a DC microdischarge {{at a very}} low flow speed. Experimental results indicate that <b>breakdown</b> <b>thresholds</b> of dry air with nanoparticle seeding were significantly reduced compared to standard Paschen law. High-speed chemiluminescence images reveal that the nanoparticles had a major influence in inducing breakdown and subsequent heating that eventually ignited the nanoparticles.|$|R
40|$|The optical <b>breakdown</b> <b>thresholds</b> (OBTs) {{of typical}} {{dielectric}} and semiconductor materials are measured using double 40 -fs laser pulses. By measuring the OBTs with different laser energy and different time delays {{between the two}} pulses, {{we found that the}} total energy of breakdown decrease for silica and increase for silicon with the increase of the first pulse energy.

50|$|Like other {{relaxation}} oscillators, {{the neon}} bulb oscillator has poor frequency stability, {{but it can}} be synchronized (entrained) to an external periodic voltage applied in series with the neon bulb. Even if the external frequency is different from the natural frequency of the oscillator, the peaks of the applied signal can exceed the <b>breakdown</b> <b>threshold</b> of the bulb, discharging the capacitor prematurely, so that the period of the oscillator becomes locked to the applied signal.|$|E
50|$|For instance, for copper {{irradiation}} of copper, recoil {{energies of}} around 5-20 keV are almost guaranteed to produce heat spikes. At lower energies, the cascade energy {{is too low}} to produce a liquid-like zone. At much higher energies, the Cu ions would most likely lead initially to a linear cascade, but the recoils could lead to heat spikes, as would the initial ion once it has slowed down enough. The concept subcascade <b>breakdown</b> <b>threshold</b> energy signifies the energy above which a recoil in a material is likely to produce several isolated heat spikes rather than a single dense one.|$|E
5000|$|The {{supply voltage}} VS must {{be greater than}} the bulb {{breakdown}} voltage Vb or the bulb can never conduct. [...] Most small neon lamps have breakdown voltages between 80 and 150 volts. If the supply voltage {{is close to the}} breakdown voltage, the capacitor voltage will be in the [...] "tail" [...] of its exponential curve by the time it reaches Vb, so the frequency will depend sensitively on the <b>breakdown</b> <b>threshold</b> and supply voltage levels, causing variations in frequency. [...] Therefore, the supply voltage is usually made significantly higher than the bulb firing voltage. [...] This also makes the charging more linear, and the sawtooth wave more triangular.|$|E

A rigorous method, which {{allows one to}} construct explicitly such surfaces, is discussed.

The Josephson currents in samples with three different interlayer distances vary by four orders of magnitude. In contrast, the <b>breakdown</b> <b>thresholds</b> for the ν_tot= 1 quantum Hall state are comparable. Furthermore, Coulomb drag in a Corbino ring reveals that the coherent counterflow current coexists with the dissipative charge transport...|$|R
50|$|The {{principles}} governing {{this mode}} of ionization are very simple. Localized plasma must be generated in predictable fashion, under the optical <b>breakdown</b> <b>threshold.</b> Optical breakdown intensity threshold is strongly correlated to the input intensity only at short pulse durations. Therefore, one important requirement, in order to systematically avoid the optical breakdown, is to operate at short pulse durations. In order for the ionization to take place, multi-photon ionization (MPI)intensity threshold must be reached. The idea is to adjust {{the duration of the}} laser pulse so that multi-photon ionization, and perhaps to a lesser extent avalanche ionization, have no time to raise the plasma’s density above the critical value.In the UV, the distinction between single-photon mode (SP) and B/OB is that for the latter multi-photon ionization, single-photon ionization, and perhaps to a lesser extent avalanche ionization, are operating, whereas for the former, only single-photon ionization is operating.|$|E

Measurements of <b>breakdown</b> <b>threshold</b> voltages indicate a marked anisotropy in the electrical breakdown properties of Teflon: differences of up to 10 kV in <b>breakdown</b> <b>threshold</b> voltage are observed depending on the sample orientation. The material anisotropy can be utilized in spacecraft construction to reduce the magnitude of discharge currents...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} the main physical properties of microwave corona breakdown in strongly in-homogeneous electric fields. The focus {{is put on}} numerical and approximate analytical calcula-tions of the <b>breakdown</b> <b>threshold</b> in an exponential ionization profile, which is the basic form of the ionization profile caused by the field enhancement around irregular and curved conducting objects. The <b>breakdown</b> <b>threshold</b> is a value associated with a certain plasma density profile. We explain the major characteristics of the density profile, its dependance on pressure and the interplay of diffusion and attachment. For lower pressures the diffusion distributes the electrons from regions of high ionization frequency to regions of weak ionization, where the attachment acts as a sink. For high pressures the diffusion becomes negligible and the <b>breakdown</b> <b>threshold</b> is set by the equality of the ionization and attachment frequencies in the high field region. 1...|$|E

State-of-the-art pulse genera-tors additionally provide {{the possibility to}} generate pulse se-quences with variable pulse repetition rate. In this article the influence of this repetition rate variation on the breakdown behavior of electronic systems is described. For this pur-pose microcontroller systems are examined during line-led exposure to pulses with repetition rates between 1 KHz and 100 KHz.

40|$|The {{statistics}} of burst avalanche sizes n during failure processes in a fiber bundle follows a power law, D(n) ∼ n^-ξ, for large avalanches. The exponent ξ depends upon how the avalanches are provoked. While {{it is known}} that when the load on the bundle is increased in a continuous manner, the exponent takes the value ξ= 5 / 2, we show that when the external load is increased in discrete and not too small steps, the exponent value ξ= 3 is relevant. Our analytic treatment applies to bundles with a general probability distribution of the <b>breakdown</b> <b>thresholds</b> for the individual fibers. The pre-asymptotic size distribution of avalanches is also considered. Comment: 4 pages 2 figure...|$|R
40|$|Breakdown physics {{induced by}} a {{subcritical}} microwave was numerically reproduced {{by using a}} two-dimensional effective diffusion model for plasma transport and combining it with Maxwell’s equations and a neutral gas dynamics equation. A discrete plasma structure was obtained when E 0,rms/Ec≧ 0. 69, where E 0,rms is the root-mean-square of the incident electric field and Ec is the <b>breakdown</b> <b>threshold,</b> because an overcritical field that exceeded the <b>breakdown</b> <b>threshold</b> was formed in a region away from the bulk plasma by the wave reflection when the plasma reflectivity was increased by joule heating. However, a continuous plasma structure with a branching pattern was formed when E 0,rms/Ec< 0. 69 because the enhanced electric-field region away from the bulk plasma never exceeded the <b>breakdown</b> <b>threshold</b> even when the plasma reflectivity increased. The propagation speed of the plasma front drastically decreased when E 0,rms/Ec< 0. 69 because the plasma propagation was sustained by strong gas expansion, which required more time than wave-reflection and ionization processes...|$|E
40|$|International audienceRadio-frequency (RF) systems used in vacuum can {{be damaged}} by {{electronic}} avalanches {{triggered by the}} multipactor effect. This undesirable phenomenon can appear for RF components used in space communication payloads {{as well as in}} experimental fusion devices, among others. To determine the multipactor <b>breakdown</b> <b>threshold,</b> expensive multipactor experimental tests can be made or multipactor simulations can be performed. This second method uses the Total Electron Emission Yield (TEEY) curve as input and the <b>breakdown</b> <b>threshold</b> predicted by simulation highly depends on this curve. Consequently we decided to make a sensitivity study of multipactor <b>breakdown</b> <b>threshold</b> in relation to the TEEY curve variations. We study the silver conductor material with a RF waveguide transformer. Two critical energy regions are found for a small gap waveguide structure: energies around first cross-over energy and energies between the first cross-over and the yield maximum. Electron emission data have to be accurate on these regions to get a coherent multipactor threshold. Six TEEY models are benchmarked with respect to their capability to accurately model these regions...|$|E

For Ca₃Y₂(BO₃) ₄:Nd crystals laser oscillations was observed for the first time. The obtained slope efficiencies of vanadate-based lasers are comparable with {{the one of the}} lamp-pumped laser based on commercial Y₃Al₅O₁₂:Nd crystal. The optical <b>breakdown</b> <b>threshold</b> of binary vanadate crystals is higher than that of the orthoborate crystals. For Ca₁₀Li(VO₄) ₇:Nd and Ca₉La(VO₄) ₇:Nd crystals the values of optical <b>breakdown</b> <b>threshold</b> are approximately the same - 80 J/cm².

To reduce the temperature dependence of the voltage divider, we have chosen ceramic dielectric materials that can provide a small thermal expansion coefficient. We investigated the high-voltage <b>breakdown</b> <b>thresholds</b> of several alumina-ceramic disks using a test-bench of our own design. A high-power test on one of the prototype CVDs was done and we obtained an accurate and highly faithful monitoring signal.

30|$|Significant {{reduction}} of the <b>breakdown</b> <b>threshold</b> in a DC microdischarge via seeding metal nanoparticles has been demonstrated. Compared to standard Paschen curves in dry air, reductions in the breakdown voltage of 5 % to 25 % were obtained for PD values (the product of pressure and electrode gap distance) ranging from 20 to 40  Torr-cm by seeding aluminum and iron nanoparticles with mean sizes of 75  nm and 80  nm, respectively. No secondary energy source was required to achieve this <b>breakdown</b> <b>threshold</b> reduction. From high-speed chemiluminescence imaging of the discharge evolution, breakdown was shown to be initiated at reduced voltages. Following breakdown, the increase in temperature ignited some of the nanoparticles near the cathode. Results suggest that possible charging of the nanoparticles within the gap may reduce the effective transient distance, leading to the threshold reduction.|$|E
40|$|The {{distribution}} of the magnitudes of damage avalanches during a failure process typically follows a power law. When these avalanches are recorded close to {{the point at which}} the system fails catastrophically, we find that the power law has an exponent which differs from the one characterizing the size {{distribution of}} all avalanches. We demonstrate this analytically for bundles of many fibers with statistically distributed <b>breakdown</b> <b>thresholds</b> for the individual fibers. In this case the magnitude distribution D(∆) for the avalanche size ∆ follows a power law ∆ −ξ with ξ = 3 / 2 near complete failure, and ξ = 5 / 2 elsewhere. We also study a network of electric fuses, and find numerically an exponent 2. 0 near breakdown, and 3. 0 elsewhere. We propose that this crossover in the size distribution may be used as a signal for imminent system failure...|$|R

A Q-switched pulsed Nd:YAG laser operating at infrared (1064 nm), visible (532 nm) and ultraviolet (266 nm) wavelengths has been used.

Laser fluence thresholds in the ultraviolet were larger than those obtained using visible and infrared radiation, while the energy threshold is larger using infrared radiation. Correlations between the plasma threshold of metal targets and the melting point and boiling point at 266, 532 and 1064 nm have been established.

The results give a clear physical picture of the dependence of breakdown electric field on pressure showing a high pressure branch determined by conditions in the high field region, a low pressure branch determined by {{the properties of the}} low field region only, and a more or less smooth transition region for intermediate pressures.

40|$|The {{results of}} arc {{discharge}} guiding experiments in optically pumped plasmas sustained by a c. w.

Comparison of the results obtained in CO/Ar and in CO/He mixtures suggests that the lowering of the <b>breakdown</b> <b>threshold</b> and arc guiding are likely to be caused by associative ionization of CO.
