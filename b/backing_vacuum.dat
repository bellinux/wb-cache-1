50|$|Turbomolecular pumps must {{operate at}} very high speeds, and the {{friction}} heat buildup imposes design limitations. Some turbomolecular pumps use magnetic bearings to reduce friction and oil contamination. Because the magnetic bearings and the temperature cycles allow for only a limited clearance between rotor and stator, the blades at the high pressure stages are somewhat degenerated into a single helical foil each. Laminar flow cannot be used for pumping, because laminar turbines stall when not used at the designed flow. The pump can be cooled down to improve the compression, but should not be so cold as to condense ice on the blades.When a turbopump is stopped, the oil from the <b>backing</b> <b>vacuum</b> may backstream through the turbopump and contaminate the chamber. One way to prevent this is to introduce a laminar flow of nitrogen through the pump. The transition from vacuum to nitrogen and from a running to a still turbopump has to be synchronized precisely to avoid mechanical stress to the pump and overpressure at the exhaust. A thin membrane and a valve at the exhaust should be added to protect the turbopump from excessive back pressure (e.g. after a power failure or leaks in the <b>backing</b> <b>vacuum).</b>|$|E

This technique requires optical nano-probes with very specialized geometries, {{in order to obtain}} large, localized enhancements of the electromagnetic field, which is the driver behind this imaging method. Traditional methods for the fabrication of these nano-probes involve electrochemical etching and subsequent FIB milling. However, this milling process is non-trivial, requiring multiple cuts on each probe.

These bitmaps are placed over the sample while imaging and provide a lookup table for the beam while milling.

40|$|Problems {{encountered}} with subgrade failures due to {{the loss}} of stabilizer over time, or ineffectiveness of stabilizer in some soils is well documented. In other cases, the amount of stabilizer applied has been found insufficient. If the selected concentration of additives is not adequate to ensure short-term and long-term durability of a pavement layer, the stabilization will be ineffective, and pavement rehabilitations will be necessary, requiring costly repairs and road closures. ^ The proper type and concentration of stabilizers are typically determined considering only the plasticity and the gradation of the subgrade. However, a number of other parameters such as the interaction between the mineralogy of the materials and additives in presence or absence of moisture, construction methods and curing processes significantly impact the performance of stabilized subgrades. ^ TxDOT currently requires acceptable strength in lieu of most durability tests to select the optimal additive. Strength tests can be conducted more rapidly than durability tests (7 days vs. 1 month). In addition it requires less laboratory equipment and technician training. However, achievement of a specified strength does not always ensure durability. Moreover, the current TxDOT procedures for selecting the optimal additive are time-consuming and the protocols determining the level of moisture conditioning are not currently available. As part of this research, new accelerated testing methods are proposed that could minimize the time required for soil specimen preparation, curing, conditioning and testing to complete the design process. They also address some of the shortcomings that exist in the current protocols to establish whether the stabilizer or stabilization method is deemed to be effective in the field construction projects. ^ In order to develop new and accelerated protocols, several soils with different characteristics and different stabilizers were evaluated under different curing and compaction methods. These soils were categorized using traditional methods and in terms of their mineralogical properties. These materials were then evaluated following the current TxDOT specifications and compared with the proposed methods of moisture conditioning, such as <b>back</b> pressure, <b>vacuum,</b> and submergence of specimens. ^ To select the best alternatives, simplicity and applicability of the test were considered as well as their correlation with methods covered in current specifications. For that matter, a protocol that could be performed on stabilized soils within one week was developed to address the effectiveness of stabilization as the main outcome of this research. ...|$|R

40|$|Based on the van der Waals density {{functional}} theory (vdW-DFT) +U scheme, {{we carry}} out the ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) study of the interaction dynamics for H_ 2 impingement against the stoichiometric PuO_ 2 (111), the reduced PuO_ 2 (111), and the stoichiometric α -Pu_ 2 O_ 3 (111) surfaces. The hydrogen molecular physisorption states, which can not be captured by pure DFT+U method, are obtained by employing the vdW-DFT+U scheme. We show that except for the weak physisorption, PuO_ 2 (111) surfaces are so difficult of access that almost all of the H_ 2 molecules will bounce <b>back</b> to the <b>vacuum</b> when their initial kinetic energies are not sufficient. Although the dissociative adsorption of H_ 2 on PuO_ 2 (111) surfaces is found to be very exothermic, the collision-induced dissociation barriers of H_ 2 are calculated to be as high as 3. 2 eV and 2. 0 eV for stoichiometric and reduced PuO_ 2 surfaces, respectively. Unlike PuO_ 2, our AIMD study directly reveals that the hydrogen molecules can penetrate into α -Pu_ 2 O_ 3 (111) surface and diffuse easily due to the 25 native O vacancies located along the 〈 111 〉 diagonals of α -Pu_ 2 O_ 3 matrix. By examining the temperature effect and the internal vibrational excitations of H_ 2, we provide a detailed insight into the interaction dynamics of H_ 2 in α -Pu_ 2 O_ 3. The optimum pathways for hydrogen penetration and diffusion, the corresponding energy barriers (1. 0 eV and 0. 53 eV, respectively) and rate constants are systematically calculated. Overall, our study fairly reveals the different interaction mechanisms between H_ 2 and Pu-oxide surfaces, which have strong implications to the interpretation of experimental observations.

40|$|A strong {{demand for}} {{wireless}} products, an insatiable thirst for spectrum that pushes carrier frequencies ever upward, and the con-stant quest for higher performance at lower power and cost, have recently driven {{the development of}} radio frequency integrated cir-cuit (RF IC) technology in unprecedented ways. These pressures are stimulating novel solutions that allow RF ICs to enjoy more {{of the benefits of}} Moore’s law than has been the case in the past. In addi-tion to regular raw transistor speed increases, the growing number of interconnect layers allows the realization of improved inductors, capacitors, and transmission lines. A deeper understanding of noise at both the device and circuit level has improved the performance of low noise amplifiers (LNAs) and oscillators. Finally, an appropriate raiding of circuit ideas dating <b>back</b> to the <b>vacuum</b> tube era enables excellent performance, even when working close to the limits of a technology. This paper surveys some of these developments in the context of low-power RF CMOS technology, with a focus on an illustra-tive implementation of a low-power 5 -GHz wireless LAN receiver in 0. 25 -m CMOS. Thanks to these recent advances in passive components and active circuits, the blocks comprising the receiver consume a total of approximately 37 mW. These blocks include an image-reject LNA, image-reject downconverter, and a complete frequency synthesizer. The overall noise figure is 5 dB, and the input-referred third-order intercept (IIP 3) is 2 dBm. To under-score that 5 GHz does not represent an upper bound by any means, this paper concludes with a look at active circuits that function be-yond 15 – 20 GHz, and a characterization of on-chip transmission lines up to 50 GHz, all in the context of how scaling is expected to shape future developments.

40|$|This is an {{extended}} abstract for The Aerosol Society Drug Delivery to the Lungs 26 Edinburgh International Conference Centre, Edinburgh, Scotland, UK, December 9 – 11, 2015. Final publication {{is available from}} Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers [URL] The dynamics of flow through the Andersen Cascade Impactor (ACI) at start-up for the performance evaluation of dry powder inhalers (DPIs) are poorly understood. Recent studies by the European Pharmaceutical Aerosols Group (EPAG) investigated the effects of reducing the sample volume on the aerodynamic particle size distributions (APSD) of aerosols generated by DPIs. When the inhaled air volume was significantly reduced below the internal volume of a Next Generation Impactor (NGI), size fractionation was incomplete, as expected, and the instrument under-reported the fine particle dose. Surprisingly, the same effect was much less severe with the ACI. The present study investigated, from a theoretical perspective, the likelihood that non-uniform particle transport {{is taking place in}} this impactor. Materials & Methods: We report the results of a computational fluid dynamic (CFD) investigation of the transient flow through a model of the ACI to confirm the existence of flow path channelling that could explain the mass-per-stage data observed previously. Results: The CFD results confirmed that a negative pressure wave propagates <b>back</b> from the <b>vacuum</b> source at the ACI exit through the CI. Air flow from the inhaler into the ACI is initiated when the suction wave reaches the induction port. Conclusions: The predicted start-up kinetics compare favourably with measurements of the air flow as a function of time.
