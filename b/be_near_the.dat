5|$|In 2014, Roswell High School began renovating {{its main}} entrance. The main office and front desk were {{relocated}} {{as a safety}} measure for the administration. The security office was also relocated to <b>be</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> main entrance. Due to the renovation, one trailer {{was removed from the}} property. The renovation took down the metal covering leading from the carpool dropoff to the main entrance.|$|E
5|$|The heat {{needed for}} geyser {{formation}} comes from magma {{that needs to}} <b>be</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> surface of the earth. The fact that geysers need heat much higher than normally found near the earth's surface is the reason they are associated with volcanoes or volcanic areas. The pressures encountered at the areas where the water is heated make the boiling point of the water much higher than at normal atmospheric pressures.|$|E

5|$|There is a {{well-developed}} {{social structure}} within {{large groups of}} condors, with competition to determine a 'pecking order' by body language, competitive play behavior, and vocalizations.

5|$|At the {{opposite}} end, at Ysgwrfa, the final five locks before Glynneath have been severed by a realignment {{of the road}} and the construction of a culvert, but the road has carried a lot less traffic since the A465 bypass was opened, and could possibly be rerouted along its original course, where the bridge over the canal still exists. The Neath Canal Act has not been repealed, and so there is still a right of navigation along this section, which should ease the process of reinstating it. The terminus would then <b>be</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> Lamb and Flag public house, south of the final two locks, which are unlikely to be restored.|$|E
5|$|Because the Moon's {{orbit around}} Earth is {{inclined}} by about 5.145° (5° 9') to {{the orbit of}} Earth around the Sun, eclipses do not occur at every full and new moon. For an eclipse to occur, the Moon must <b>be</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> intersection of the two orbital planes. The periodicity and recurrence of eclipses of the Sun by the Moon, and of the Moon by Earth, is described by the saros, which has a period of approximately 18years.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the relativistic contraction and binding of the 7s subshell, the 6d5/2 orbital {{is expected to be}} destabilized due to spin-orbit coupling, making it behave similarly to the 7s orbital in terms of size, shape, and energy. Hence copernicium may not be a noble metal, but rather a semiconductor with a band gap of around 0.2eV. Copernicium is expected to crystallize in the hexagonal close-packed crystal structure, with lattice parameters a=332pm and c=540pm. The c/a ratio of 1.63 is the ideal value, establishing a kinship between solid copernicium and the solid noble gases, though its cohesive energy (enthalpy of crystallization) should be on the order of that of mercury rather than <b>be</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> lower value of the noble gases.|$|E
5|$|Once food {{leaves the}} crop, it passes to the midgut (element 13 in {{numbered}} diagram), {{also known as}} the mesenteron, where the majority of digestion takes place. Microscopic projections from the midgut wall, called microvilli, increase the surface area of the wall and allow more nutrients to be absorbed; they tend to be close to the origin of the midgut. In some insects, the role of the microvilli and where they are located may vary. For example, specialized microvilli producing digestive enzymes may more likely <b>be</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> end of the midgut, and absorption near the origin or beginning of the midgut.|$|E
5|$|Similarly to all inner {{satellites}} of Jupiter, Thebe rotates synchronously {{with its}} orbital motion, thus keeping one face always {{looking toward the}} planet. Its orientation is such that the long axis always points to Jupiter. At the surface points closest to and furthest from Jupiter, the surface is thought to <b>be</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> edge of the Roche lobe, where Thebe's gravity is only slightly larger than the centrifugal force. As a result, the escape velocity in these two points is very small, thus allowing dust to escape easily after meteorite impacts, and ejecting it into the Thebe gossamer ring.|$|E

5|$|The Solar System {{is in the}} Local Interstellar Cloud or Local Fluff. It {{is thought}} to <b>be</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> {{neighbouring}} G-Cloud {{but it is not}} known if the Solar System is embedded in the Local Interstellar Cloud, or if it is in the region where the Local Interstellar Cloud and G-Cloud are interacting. The Local Interstellar Cloud is an area of denser cloud in an otherwise sparse region known as the Local Bubble, an hourglass-shaped cavity in the interstellar medium roughly 300 light-years (ly) across. The bubble is suffused with high-temperature plasma, that suggests it is the product of several recent supernovae.|$|E
5|$|About 90 {{atoms of}} flerovium have been observed: 58 were {{synthesized}} directly, {{and the rest}} were made from the radioactive decay of heavier elements. All of these flerovium atoms {{have been shown to}} have mass numbers from 284 to 290. The most stable known flerovium isotope, flerovium-289, has a half-life of around 2.6seconds, but {{it is possible that the}} unconfirmed flerovium-290 with one extra neutron may have a nuclear isomer with a longer half-life of 19seconds; this would be one of the longest half-lives of any isotope of any element at these farthest reaches of the periodic table. Flerovium is predicted to <b>be</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> centre of the theorized island of stability, and it is expected that heavier flerovium isotopes, especially the possibly doubly magic flerovium-298, may have even longer half-lives.|$|E
5|$|Although no {{speech or}} text is used {{anywhere}} in the game aside from credits and interaction hints in the main menu, the six flower dreams follow a narrative arc. The player's starting location in each stage appears to <b>be</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> ending location of the previous one, and {{through the course of}} the game the player approaches a distant city. The first levels focus on restoring life and color to the landscape. After activating a series of windmills, the player flies through a nighttime field, illuminating darkened strings of lights until they reach the city. The city is full of menacing metal structures, small arcs of electricity, and washed-out buildings; the player enlivens the city in the final two levels and transforms it into a bright and cheerful place.|$|E

5|$|The French {{position}} {{was such that}} they were able to lay down withering fire on the British forces as they advanced, and the abatis (a word that shares derivation with abattoir, or slaughterhouse) rapidly became a killing field. By about 2 pm, it was clear that the first wave of attack had failed. Montcalm was active on the battlefield, having removed his coat, and was moving among his men, giving encouragement and making sure all of their needs were being met. Abercrombie, who was reported by early historians like Francis Parkman and Thomas Mante to be at the sawmill (and thus well away from the action), was reported by his aide, James Abercrombie, to <b>be</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> rear of the lines by the La Chute River during much of the battle, and to have approached the front of the French lines at one point early in the battle. It is uncertain why, after the first wave of attack failed, Abercrombie persisted in ordering further attacks. Writing in his own defense, he later claimed that he was relying on Clerk's assessment that the works could be easily taken; this was clearly refuted by the failure of the first charge.|$|E
5|$|The ice {{crystals}} in cirrus clouds have different shapes {{in addition to}} different sizes. Some shapes include solid columns, hollow columns, plates, rosettes, and conglomerations of the various other types. The shape of the {{ice crystals}} {{is determined by the}} air temperature, atmospheric pressure, and ice supersaturation. Cirrus in temperate regions typically have the shapes segregated by type: the columns and plates tend to {{be at the top of}} the cloud, whereas the rosettes and conglomerations tend to <b>be</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> base. In the northern Arctic region, cirrus tend to be composed of only the columns, plates, and conglomerations, and these crystals tend to be at least four times larger than the minimum size. In Antarctica, cirrus are usually composed of only the columns, and these columns are much longer than normal.|$|E
