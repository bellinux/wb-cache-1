40|$|In this study, an {{extraction}} {{method and}} environmental {{scanning electron microscopy}} (SEM) are employed to reveal {{the changes in the}} occurrence mode of fluorine in a coal-fired power plant in Inner Mongolia, China. The different occurrence states of fluorine during coal combustion and emission show that fluorine in coal mainly assumes insoluble inorganic mineral forms. The results illustrate that the three typical occurrence modes in coal are CaF 2, MgF 2 and AlF 3. The fluorine in fly ash can be captured by an electrostatic precipitator (EPS) or a bag filter. In contrast, the gaseous fluorine content in flue gas is only in the range of several parts per million; thus, it cannot be used in this study. The occurrence mode of fluorine in <b>bottom</b> <b>ash</b> <b>and</b> <b>slag</b> is inorganic villiaumite (e. g., soluble NaF, KF and insoluble CaF 2) which is difficult to break down even at high temperatures. The occurrence mode of fluorine with the highest content in fly ash is physically adsorbed fluorine along the direction of the flue gas flow. The insoluble inorganic mineral fluoride content in fly ash is also high, but the gradually increasing fluorine content in fly ash is mainly caused by physical adsorption. Fluorine in the coal-fired power plant discharges mostly as solid products; however, very little fluorine emitted into the environment as gas products (HF, SiF 4) cannot be captured. The parameters used in this study may provide useful references in developing a monitoring and control system for fluorine in coal-fired power plants...|$|E

A number of trace elements in coal and coal ash have concentrations greater than their respective worldwide average contents (Clarke values). The highest values in coal ash are displayed by elements such as Rb, Cs, Ba, Cu, Sb, Bi, U, and Ag. Trace elements are concentrated mainly in the heavy accessory minerals and organic matter in coal. In decreasing order of significance, the trace elements in coal may occur as: element-organic compounds; impurities in the mineral matter; major components in the mineral matter; major and impurity components in the inorganic amorphous matter; and elements in the fluid constituent. A number of trace elements in the waste products, similar to coal ashes, exceed known Clarke contents. Trace elements are mainly enriched in non-magnetic, heavy and fine-grained fractions of fly ash. They are commonly present as impurities in the glass phases, and {{are included in the}} crystalline components. Their accessory crystalline phases, element-organic compounds, liquid and gas forms, are of subordinate importance. Some elements from the chalcophile (Cu, Zn, Ga, Ge, Pb, As, Sb), lithophile (Be, Ba, Ce, Hf, Sr, La, Zr, Mo, U) and siderophile (Sc, Cr, V) groups may release into the atmosphere during coal burning. For others, the combustion process appears to be a powerful factor causing their relative enrichment in the fly ash and rarely in the <b>bottom</b> <b>ash</b> <b>and</b> <b>slag.</b> Considerable amounts of Hf, some chalcophile elements (Zn, As, Tl, Pb) and Ag from stack emissions have probably entered the soil near TPS. Trace elements can also occur in water soluble forms in the fly ash (Li, Sr, Mo, Cs, V, Cr, Mn, As, Bi, B, F, Cl, Br, I) and probably contaminate the surface and subsoil waters.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this program is to convert Illinois coal combustion residues, such as fly <b>ash,</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>ash,</b> <b>and</b> boiler <b>slag,</b> into novel cementitious materials {{for use in the}} construction industry. These residues are composed largely of SiO{sub 2 }, Al{sub 2 }O{sub 3 }, Fe{sub 2 }O{sub 3 }, MgO, and CaO, which are also the major components of cement. Since the residues are used as an integral component of the cement and not just as additives to concrete, larger amounts of the residues can be utilized. The process uses submerged combustion to melt blends of coal combustion residues with lime, clay, and/or sand. The submerged combustion melter utilizes natural gas-oxidant firing directly into a molten bath to provide efficient melting of mineral-like materials. Use of this melter for cement production has many advantages over rotary kilns including very little, if any, grinding of the feed material, very low emissions, and compact size. During {{the first year of the}} program, samples of coal combustion residues were blended and mixed, as needed; with lime, clay, and/or sand to adjust the composition.

The project objective was accomplished by housing the CCP Extension Program within The Ohio State University College of Engineering with support from the university Extension Service and The Ohio State University Research Foundation. Dr. Tarunjit S. Butalia, an internationally reputed CCP expert and registered professional engineer, was the program coordinator. The program coordinator acted as liaison among CCP stakeholders in the state, produced information sheets, provided expertise in the field to those who desired it, sponsored and co-sponsored seminars, meetings, and speaking at these events, and generally worked to promote knowledge about the productive and proper application of CCPs as useful raw materials. The major accomplishments of the program were: (1) Increase in FGD material utilization rate from 8 % in 1997 to more than 20 % in 2005, and an increase in overall CCP utilization rate of 21 % in 1997 to just under 30 % in 2005 for the State of Ohio.

40|$|The present world energy {{production}} is heavily {{relying on the}} combustion of solid fuels like coals, peat, biomass, municipal solid waste, whereas the share of renewable fuels is anticipated to increase {{in the future to}} mitigate climate change. In Finland, peat and wood are widely used for {{energy production}}. In any case, the combustion of solid fuels results in generation of several types of thermal conversion residues, such as <b>bottom</b> <b>ash,</b> fly <b>ash,</b> <b>and</b> boiler <b>slag.</b> The predominant residue type is determined by the incineration technology applied, while its composition is primarily relevant to the composition of fuels combusted. An extensive research has been conducted on technical suitability of ash for multiple recycling methods. Most of attention was drawn to the recycling of the coal combustion residues, as coal is the primary solid fuel consumed globally. The recycling methods of coal residues include utilization in a cement industry, in concrete manufacturing, and mine backfilling, to name few. Biomass combustion residues were also studied to some extent with forest fertilization, road construction, and road stabilization being the predominant utilization options. Lastly, residues form municipal solid waste incineration attracted more attention recently following the growing number of waste incineration plants globally. The recycling methods of waste incineration residues are the most limited due to its hazardous nature and varying composition, and include, among others, landfill construction, road construction, mine backfilling. In the study, environmental and economic aspects of multiple recycling options of thermal conversion residues generated within a case-study area were studied. The case-study area was South-East Finland. The environmental analysis was performed using an internationally recognized methodology — life cycle assessment. Economic assessment was conducted applying a widely used methodology — cost-benefit analysis. Finally, the results of the analyses were combined to enable easier comparison of the recycling methods. The recycling methods included the use of ash in forest fertilization, road construction, road stabilization, <b>and</b> landfill construction. <b>Ash</b> landfilling was set as a baseline scenario. Quantitative data about the amounts of <b>ash</b> generated <b>and</b> its composition was obtained from companies, their environmental reports, technical reports and other previously published literature. Overall, the amount of ash in the case-study area was 101 700 t. However, the data about 58 400 t of fly <b>ash</b> <b>and</b> 35 100 t of <b>bottom</b> <b>ash</b> <b>and</b> boiler <b>slag</b> were included in the study due to lack of data about leaching of heavy metals in some cases. The recycling methods were modelled according to the scientific studies published previously. Overall, {{the results of the study}} indicated that ash utilization for fertilization and neutralization of 17 600 ha of forest was the most economically beneficial method, which resulted in the net present value increase by 58 % compared to ash landfilling. Regarding the environmental impact, the use of ash in the construction of 11 km of roads was the most attractive method with decreased environmental impact of 13 % compared to ash landfilling. The least preferred method was the use of ash for landfill construction since it only enabled 11 % increase of net present value, while inducing additional 1 % of negative impact on the environment. Therefore, a following recycling route was proposed in the study. Where possible and legally acceptable, recycle fly <b>and</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>ash</b> for forest fertilization, which has strictest requirements out of all studied methods. If the quality of fly ash is not suitable for forest fertilization, then it should be utilized, first, in paved road construction, second, in road stabilization. <b>Bottom</b> <b>ash</b> not suitable for forest fertilization, as well as boiler slag, should be used in landfill construction. Landfilling should only be practiced when recycling by either of the methods is not possible due to legal requirements or there is not enough demand on the market. Current demand on <b>ash</b> <b>and</b> possible changes in the future were assessed in the study. Currently, the area of forest fertilized in the case-study are is only 451 ha, whereas about 17 600 ha of forest could be fertilized with ash generated in the region. Provided that the average forest fertilizing values in Finland are higher and the area treated with fellings is about 40 000 ha, the amount of ash utilized in forest fertilization could be increased. Regarding road construction, no new projects launched by the Center of Economic Development, Transport and the Environment in the case-study area were identified. A potential application can be found in the construction of private roads. However, no centralized data about such projects is available. The use of ash in stabilization of forest roads is not expected to increased in the future with a current downwards trend in the length of forest roads built. Finally, the use of ash in landfill construction is not a promising option due to the reducing number of landfills in operation in Finland. Publishers versio...|$|R

Following combustion, the metals, naturally contained within coal at low concentrations, may become highly concentrated within the ash. These combustion byproducts are then piped out in a water-ash slurry to the surface impoundments where the ash weathers to- a clay- like substance after approximately 10 years. It is feared that these metals that are contained within the ash could possibly leach {{into the ground and}} contaminate the local groundwater. Utilizing a open column percolation test to determine the hydraulic conductivity of the ash, a set of tests were run to see what metals were contained within the test leachate using permitted discharge from the generating facility (Georgia Power Company 2 ̆ 7 s (GPC) Plant McDonough, Smyrna, Georgia). The permitted discharge is a slightly alkaline fluid, with a pH range of 7. 08 - 8. 03. Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP) was then conducted to see what metals would leach from the ash in an acidic (pH range of 4. 93 +/- 0. 05) environment. The results were then compared to provide a best and worst case scenario for metals leaching from the ash pond into groundwater supplies. The relatively low levels of metals contained in the leachate from the TCLP tests suggest that after a surface impoundment is no longer utilized, the acidic nature of rainwater would not cause metals to leach into groundwater supplies. Calcium, an important nutrient for plants, was shown in the TCLP tests to be the one metal consistently available from the ash in an acidic environment. This might be the reason cattails Typha spp.) and pines (Pinus spp.) are so numerous within the ash pond 2 ̆ 7 s older areas. This large abundance of leachable calcium is due to the large percentage of ash comprised of calcium oxide (CaO), which has a relatively high solubility. The coal combustion byproducts (CCBs) are commingled within the pond so utilization for beneficial purposes such as concrete aggregate, Portland cement substitute, asphalt shingles, etc. would require separating the CCBs into their components (fly <b>ash,</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>ash,</b> boiler <b>slag,</b> <b>and</b> flue gas desulfurization (FGD) material).

This paper presents detailed physical, chemical and geotechnical characterization of fly <b>ash,</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>ash</b> <b>and</b> {{municipal solid}} waste from Telangana State in India. Fly <b>ash</b> <b>and</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>ash</b> samples were collected from Kakatiya thermal power station in India. Municipal solid waste (MSW) sample was collected from Borabanda municipal dump site in the city of Hyderabad, India. From the experimental results, it is noticed that specific gravity of fly <b>ash,</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>ash</b> <b>and</b> {{municipal solid waste}} were found to be 1.86, 1.77 and 2.2 respectively. Presence of quartz and mullite; quartz, mullite and calcium carbonate; and quartz and corundum are found to be predominant in fly <b>ash,</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>ash</b> <b>and</b> MSW respectively. The peak friction angle of fly <b>ash,</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>ash</b> <b>and</b> municipal solid waste were found to be 37.02 °, 33.77 ° and 35.23 ° respectively. Permeability characteristics of fly <b>ash,</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>ash</b> <b>and</b> municipal solid waste were observed to be 1.01 E− 04  cm/s, 2.01 E− 04  cm/s and 1.16 E− 04  cm/s respectively. From the observation of experimental results, it can be concluded that fly <b>ash,</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>ash</b> <b>and</b> municipal solid waste from Telangana state are effective material to be used as backfill material, filter material and embankment construction.|$|R
40|$|Currently a lot {{of power}} plants have a problem with storage of coal {{combustion}} solid by-products (<b>ash</b> <b>and</b> <b>slag).</b> Holding capacity of existing power plants available ash dumps were enlarged and modernized repeatedly. Many plants have two or even three of them. Today new ash dump construction is economically inconvenient due to need to assign new plots of land and their inconveniently big distance from a plant, which increase <b>ash</b> <b>and</b> <b>slag</b> transportation expenses. The goal of our research work is to find promising directions for <b>ash</b> <b>and</b> <b>slag</b> waste mass utilization based on Kuznetsk bituminous coals experimental data on ultimate composition and properties. The experimental research of <b>ash,</b> <b>slag</b> <b>and</b> their mixture samples from ash dumps brought us to conclusion that the most promising direction for these materials application in large quantities is construction industry including road construction.

40|$|Durante a queima do carvÃo mineral sÃo gerados vÃrios tipos de resÃduos ou subprodutos (produtos da combustÃo do carvÃo, ou PCCs). Esses produtos incluem as cinzas volantes, as cinzas pesadas ou de fundo, a escÃria da caldeira, e o gesso do FGD - Flue Gas Desulfurization. Embora alguns PCCs sejam reutilizados como matÃria-prima para a construÃÃo civil, a maioria deles Ã depositada em aterros ou represas de contenÃÃo. AlÃm de ocupar vastas extensÃes de terra, existe uma grande preocupaÃÃo com o fato de que produtos quÃmicos tÃxicos dos PCCs podem {{dissolver}} na Ãgua e essa Ãgua poluÃda pode lixiviar, contaminando tanto Ãguas subterrÃneas quanto superficiais. Este trabalho teve como objetivo fabricar e caracterizar peÃas cerÃmicas a partir de resÃduos da extraÃÃo do granito Asa Branca, com adiÃÃo de produtos gerados pela combustÃo do carvÃo de uma usina termoelÃtrica. Foram avaliadas a microestrutura e algumas propriedades fÃsicas e mecÃnicas dessas peÃas. Os materiais utilizados foram granito Asa Branca e o subproduto da combustÃo do carvÃo mineral (fornecido pela Energia de Portugal â EDP), nas concentraÃÃes de 10 %p, 20 %p e 30 %p. Para a caracterizaÃÃo das amostras foram utilizadas as tÃcnicas de: DifraÃÃo de Raios-X, FluorescÃncia de Raios-X, Microscopia EletrÃnica de Varredura (MEV), AnÃlise TermogravimÃtrica (ATG). Para a determinaÃÃo das propriedades fÃsicas foram realizados os ensaios de ContraÃÃo Superficial e MÃssica; AbsorÃÃo de Ãgua e Microdureza Vickers. Os resultados obtidos permitem concluir que o uso de produto da combustÃo do carvÃo mineral como reforÃo em peÃas feitas com pÃ de Granito Asa Branca Ã tecnicamente viÃvel. During {{the burning}} of mineral coal a series of different residues or byproducts (coal combustion products, or CCPs) are generated. These byproducts include fly <b>ash,</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>ash,</b> boiler <b>slag,</b> <b>and</b> flue gas desulfurization gypsum. Although some types of CCPs {{can be used as}} alternative raw materials for construction products, the majority of them are deposited in landfills or surface impoundments. Besides the occupation of large areas there is a major concern with the fact that toxic chemicals from the CCPs can dissolve in water, and this polluted water can spread underground, contaminating both groundwater and surface waters. The present work investigated the fabrication and characterization of ceramic products made from Asa Branca granite powder with the addition of products generated by the combustion of mineral coal in a power plant. The microstructure and some physical and mechanical properties of these parts were evaluated. The materials used were Asa Branca Granite and a mixture of CCPs supplied by EDP (Energia de Portugal) which were added in the concentrations of 10, 20 and 30 % wt. to the granite matrix. The following techniques were used for the characterization of the materials: X-ray diffraction, X-ray fluorescence, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA). Determination of physical properties was performed by means of Surface Contraction and Weight Loss tests; Water Absorption and Vickers Microhardness. The results showed that the use of products generated by the combustion of coal as reinforcements for the parts made from Asa Branca Granite powder is technically viable...|$|R
