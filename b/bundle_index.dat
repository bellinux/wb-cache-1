40|$|The {{interaction}} of gravitation and electromagnetism in Evans field theory {{is governed by}} the first Bianchi identity of differential geometry. The Christoffel symbol of the unified field is in general asymmetric in its lower two indices. The Einstein field theory of gravitation is recovered when the Christoffel symbol becomes symmetric and the torsion tensor vanishes. The Maxwell Heaviside field theory of electromagnetism is recovered when the Christoffel symbol becomes antisymmetric. The theory of O(3) electrodynamics is recovered when the Christoffel symbol is an-tisymmetric and when the tangent <b>bundle</b> <b>index</b> is developed in a complex circular basis. The Evans unified field is described in general by an asymmetric Christoffel symbol. In this case gravitation and electromagnetism are mutually influential. The details of this interaction are found by solving the first Bianchi identity of differential geometry, which is the homogeneous Evans field equation within a C negative scalar. These details are important {{for the design of}} major new technologies which take electromagnetic energy from Evans spacetime defined by the asymmetric Christoffel symbol, and for the design of new counter-gravitational aerospace devices...|$|E

In this paper, three major fiber bundles passing through brainstem are identified. Features for representing fiber trajectories are studied and a 3 D shape context is adopted to capture the fiber shape. Kernel PCA with histogram intersection kernel is then applied to reduce the dimensionality of the fiber histogram. Both supervised and unsupervised classification methods are investigated, including discriminant analysis, support vector machine, K-Nearest neighborhood, K-Means, with different kernels and distance metric.

To disseminate {{data in this}} kind of network is a challenging task and had drawn lots of research effort. When two nodes have connectivity with each other, the data bundles stored in their memory will be either replicated or forwarded to the other node {{in the hope that the}} data eventually reaches the destination node. The protocols that has only one copy of each data bundle is catagorized as forwarding protocol while the ones with multiple copies called replicating pro-tocols. In opportunistic network, the replicating protocols are preferred over forwarding protocols. Yet, a big over-head is to be solved for replicating routing protocols, i. e. the exchanging of metadata. To avoid sending data bundles the other party already has, replicating protocols usually exchange metadata at the beginning of the connecting pe-riod.

40|$|This report explores {{evidence}} and insights from five case {{studies that have}} made significant recent progress in addressing the challenge of insuring poor smallholder farmers and pastoralists in the developing world. In India, national index insurance programmes have reached over 30 million farmers through a mandatory link with agricultural credit and strong government support. In East Africa (Kenya, Rwanda and Tanzania), the Agriculture and Climate Risk Enterprise (ACRE) has recently scaled to reach nearly 200, 000 farmers, <b>bundling</b> <b>index</b> insurance with agricultural credit and farm inputs. ACRE has built on strong partnerships with regional initiatives such as M-PESA mobile banking. In Ethiopia and Senegal, the R 4 Rural Resilience Initiative has scaled unsubsidized index insurance to over 20, 000 poor smallholder farmers who were previously considered uninsurable, using insurance {{as an integral part}} of a comprehensive risk management portfolio. With strong public and private sector support, the Mongolia Index-Based Livestock Insurance Project (IBLIP) insures more than 15, 000 nomadic herders and links commercial insurance with a government disaster safety net. Finally, the Index-Based Livestock Insurance (IBLI) project in Kenya and Ethiopia demonstrates innovative approaches to insuring poor nomadic pastoralists in challenging circumstances. A few common features appear to have contributed to recent progress within these case studies: explicitly targeting obstacles to improving farmer income; integration of insurance with other development interventions; giving farmers a voice in the design of products; investing in local capacity; and investing in science-based index development. Evidence from these case studies can inform the ongoing debate about the viability of scaling up index-based insurance for vulnerable smallholder farmers in the developing world. The rapid progress observed in recent years suggests that index insurance has the potential to benefit smallholder farmers at a meaningful scale, and suggests the need to reassess arguments that lack of demand and practical implementation challenges prevent index-based insurance from being a useful tool to reduce rural poverty...|$|R
