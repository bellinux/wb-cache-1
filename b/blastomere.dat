25|$|Not all {{methods of}} opening the zona pellucida have the same success rate because the {{well-being}} of the embryo and/or <b>blastomere</b> may be impacted by the procedure used for the biopsy. Zona drilling with acid Tyrode's solution (ZD) was looked at in comparison to partial zona dissection (PZD) to determine which technique would lead to more successful pregnancies and have less of an effect on the embryo and/or <b>blastomere.</b> ZD uses a digestive enzyme like pronase which makes it a chemical drilling method. The chemicals used in ZD may have a damaging effect on the embryo. PZD uses a glass microneedle to cut the zona pellucida which makes it a mechanical dissection method that typically needs skilled hands to perform the procedure. In a study that included 71 couples, ZD was performed in 26 cycles from 19 couples and PZD was performed in 59 cycles from 52 couples. In the single cell analysis, there was a success rate of 87.5% in the PZD group and 85.4% in the ZD group. The maternal age, number of oocytes retrieved, fertilization rate, and other variables did not differ between the ZD and PZD groups. It was found that PZD led to a significantly higher rate of pregnancy (40.7% vs 15.4%), ongoing pregnancy (35.6% vs 11.5%), and implantation (18.1% vs 5.7%) than ZD. This suggests that using the mechanical method of PZD in <b>blastomere</b> biopsies for preimplantation genetic diagnosis may be more proficient than using the chemical method of ZD. The success of PZD over ZD could be attributed to the chemical agent in ZD having a harmful effect on the embryo and/or <b>blastomere.</b> Currently, zona drilling using a laser is the predominant method {{of opening the}} zona pellucida. Using a laser is an easier technique than using mechanical or chemical means. However, laser drilling could be harmful to the embryo and it is very expensive for in vitro fertilization laboratories to use especially when PGD is not a prevalent process as of modern times. PZD could be a viable alternative to these issues.|$|E
25|$|The main {{advantage}} of cleavage-stage biopsy over PB analysis {{is that the}} genetic input of both parents can be studied. On the other hand, cleavage-stage embryos are {{found to have a}} high rate of chromosomal mosaicism, putting into question whether the results obtained on one or two blastomeres will be representative {{for the rest of the}} embryo. It is for this reason that some programs utilize a combination of PB biopsy and <b>blastomere</b> biopsy. Furthermore, cleavage-stage biopsy, as in the case of PB biopsy, yields a very limited amount of tissue for diagnosis, necessitating the development of single-cell PCR and FISH techniques.|$|E
25|$|Female embryos were {{selectively}} transferred in five couples {{at risk of}} X-linked disease, {{resulting in}} two twins and one singleton pregnancy. Because the Y chromosome region Kontogianni was amplifying contained many repeats, it was more efficient than trying to amplify a unique region. A band on the PCR gel indicated that the embryo was male {{and the absence of}} a band indicated that the embryo was female. However, amplification failure or an anucleate <b>blastomere</b> also resulted in absence of a band on the PCR gel. To reduce the risk of misdiagnosis, Kontogianni went on to co-amplify sequences on the X and Y (Kontogianni et al., 1991). At that time nothing was known about allele dropout, cumulus cell contamination, or amplification failure from single cells. During the 1980s, human IVF embryos were exclusively transferred on day two of development as the culture medium used was incapable of reliably growing embryos past this stage. Since the biopsy was to be performed on day three, the first diagnoses were all performed in one day, with transfer of the embryos late on day three. A comparison of day two and day three transfers indicated that this would not adversely affect pregnancy rates. The worry of embryos arresting was so high that some transfers took place {{in the early hours of}} day four so that the embryos were removed from culture as soon as possible. There were many evenings at the Hammersmith when a transfer was performed at 1 a.m. on day four and researchers returned to the laboratory at 7 a.m. to start the next case. Prof. Winston helped deliver most of the first PGD babies.|$|E

40|$|Although {{bivalves}} develop through spiral cleavage patterns, {{similar to}} other lophotrochozoans, the cleavage pattern of D lineage <b>blastomeres</b> is unique, since 2 d shows four rounds of stereotypic unequal cleavage before bilateral cleavage of the largest derivative of 2 d: 2 d 1121. This unique modification of spiral cleavage is directly associated with the characteristic morphology of bivalves, namely, bilaterally separated shell plates, because the bilateral shell plates {{are thought to be}} derived from the bilateral derivatives of 2 d 1121. In this report, to determine whether the unique cleavage pattern of bivalves is regulated depending on the interaction with other cells or by cell autonomous mechanisms, we performed cell isolation experiments and observed subsequent cleavage patterns of isolated <b>blastomeres.</b> When focusing on the largest derivatives of D <b>blastomeres,</b> 8 % of isolated D <b>blastomeres</b> followed the cleavage pattern of normal development up to bilateral cleavage.

40|$|AbstractThe spindle-assembly {{checkpoint}} of {{the cell}} cycle develops inXenopus laevisembryos at the midblastula transition (MBT). Our previous experiments using animal-cap <b>blastomeres</b> indicate that the checkpoint is regulated by a mechanism that depends on age, {{but not on the}} nucleocytoplasmic (N/C) ratio (Clute and Masui, 1995). In the present study, the time of appearance of the spindle-assembly checkpoint is examined in animal-cap <b>blastomeres</b> whose N/C ratio is reduced by treatment with aphidicolin. Animal-cap <b>blastomeres</b> treated with aphidicolin from the 2 -cell stage cleave more slowly after 4 th cleavage, in a dose-dependent manner, but cleavage and chromosome cycles continue up to the 11 th to 13 th cleavage and then arrest. <b>Blastomeres</b> treated with aphidicolin have a reduced DNA content and N/C ratio compared to control <b>blastomeres</b> of the same age. Nevertheless, nocodazole-sensitive chromosome cycles appear {{at the same time as}} in control <b>blastomeres,</b> at 3 to 5 hr after 5 th cleavage, regardless of the N/C ratio. The arrest in interphase caused by treating blastula stage animal caps with aphidicolin can be reversed by treatment with caffeine. The caffeine-induced mitosis becomes sensitive to nocodazole after the MBT, but not before. Therefore, the same mechanism which stabilizes maturation-promoting factor activity in the absence of a mitotic spindle also operates after the MBT in <b>blastomeres</b> that are treated with aphidicolin, if mitosis is induced by caffeine. This mechanism may involve the translation of a maternal mRNA at the time of the MBT, as suggested previously...|$|R
