Rolling Stone credited Kiedis for his drastically improved vocals: [...] " [...] vocal cords have apparently been down to some crossroads and over the rehab, and returned with heretofore unheard-of range, <b>body,</b> <b>pitch,</b> soulfulness, and melodic sensibility." [...] Songs such as [...] "Otherside" [...] and [...] "Porcelain" [...] were called [...] "Pumpkins-esque", while the album as a whole was [...] "epiphanal" [...] and the [...] "RHCP furthermuckers are now moving toward funk's real Holy Grail: that salty marriage of esoteric mythology and insatiable musicality that salvages souls, binds communities and heals the sick." [...] Other critics credited the album's success to the return of Frusciante. AllMusic's Greg Prato said that the [...] "obvious reason for [...] rebirth is the reappearance of guitarist John Frusciante", considering him to be the [...] "quintessential RHCP guitarist". The album as a whole was [...] "a bona fide Chili Peppers classic". Entertainment Weekly also credits Frusciante with transforming the band's sound into a [...] "more relaxed, less grating, and, in their own way, more introspective album than ever before". Mark Woodlief of Ray Gun commented that [...] "'This Velvet Glove' strikes an intricate balance between a lush acoustic guitar foundation and anthemic rock," [...] Woodlief continued [...] "the disco intro to 'Parallel Universe' gives way to a scorching Western giddy-up motif in the chorus, and Frusciante's Hendrix-like excursions at the song's close." ...|$|E
40|$|Two {{experiments}} were conducted. In Experiment I, each of eight Ss attempted to place himself at 13 different goal orientations between prone and supine. Deviations of achieved <b>body</b> <b>pitch</b> angles from goal orientations were determined. In Experiment II, each of eight Ss attempted to align a visual target with his morphological horizon {{while he was}} placed {{at each of the}} 13 goal orientations. Changes in settings of the target were examined. Results indicate that Ss underestimate <b>body</b> <b>pitch</b> when they are tilted less than 60 deg backward or forward from the vertical, overestimate <b>body</b> <b>pitch</b> when they are nearly prone, and accurately estimate <b>body</b> <b>pitch</b> when they are nearly supine.

40|$|High speed video {{observations}} of free flying male Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, the dengue and yellow fever vector, along with custom measurement methods, enable measurement of wingbeat frequency, body position and body orientation of mosquitoes during flight. We find these mosquitoes flap their wings at approximately 850 Hz. We also generate body yaw, <b>body</b> <b>pitch</b> and wing deviation measurements with {{standard deviations of}} less than 1 degree and find that sideways velocity and acceleration are important components of mosquito motion. Rapid turns involving changes in flight direction often involve large sideways accelerations. These do not correspond to commensurate changes in body heading, and the insect's flight direction and body heading are decoupled during flight. These findings call in to question the role of yaw control in mosquito flight. In addition, using orientation data, we find that sideways accelerations are well explained by roll-based rotation of the lift vector. In contrast, the insect's <b>body</b> <b>pitch</b> angle does not correlate with its forward acceleration. This implies that controlling body roll is important to mosquito dynamics. The dynamic importance of stabilizing <b>body</b> <b>pitch</b> and body yaw is less clear...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Sex {{differences}} exist for many spatial tasks. This {{is true for}} circular vection, field dependence, and perception of veridical vertical with body tilt. However, explanations for these sex differences is lacking in the literature. In this study, we investigated the nature of individual differences {{in the perception of}} self-orientation in humans. Male and female participants were asked to identify their Morphological Horizon (i. e., line perpendicular to saggital plane at eye-level) in different body orientations relative to gravity (i. e., 45 deg and 135 deg <b>body</b> <b>pitch)</b> with and without prior whole body rotation. Results Sex explained the observed differences in the perception of self-orientation only when blood distribution was least altered (i. e., 45 deg <b>body</b> <b>pitch)</b> and without prior whole body rotation. Specifically, females presented a more footward bias than males in these conditions. Conclusion These results add to the literature on sex differences for spatial orientation tasks. As the differences were only observed with static conditions and when blood distribution was least affected, we concluded that sex differences in the perception of self-orientation are associated with gravireceptors (e. g., otoliths). </p...|$|E

30|$|The wheel {{assemblies}} are {{coupled to}} each other by the HIS system. In the body bounce motion shown in Figure  1, {{the top and bottom}} chambers are compressed and extended, respectively. Owing to the asymmetry of the hydraulic cylinders, every hydraulic circuit contains a small amount of fluid flowing into the accumulators. This leads to a small pressure change in the two hydraulic circuits. Thus, the actuators could generate an additional hydraulic force to restrict the bounce motion of the sprung mass relative to the unsprung mass. In the <b>body</b> <b>pitch</b> motion, all the front and rear suspensions are compressed and extended, respectively. The front and rear cylinder bodies move downward and upward relative to the piston rod, respectively. It reduces the volume of the front top and rear bottom chambers, and simultaneously increases the volume of the front bottom and rear top chambers. Thus, the fluid in circuit B flows into the corresponding accumulator B, and the fluid in the corresponding accumulator A flows into circuit A. Consequently, the pressures in circuits A and B are increased and decreased, respectively. It in return generates the large pitch restoring moment to prevent the vehicle <b>body</b> <b>pitch</b> motion relative to the unsprung mass.|$|E
40|$|In a fully {{mechanized}} coal-mining face, {{the positioning}} and {{attitude of the}} shearer and scraper conveyor are inaccurate. To overcome this problem, a joint positioning and attitude solving method that considers the effect of an uneven floor is proposed. In addition, the real-time connection and coupling {{relationship between the two}} devices is analyzed. Two types of sensors, namely, the tilt sensor and strapdown inertial navigation system (SINS), are used to measure the shearer <b>body</b> <b>pitch</b> angle and the scraper conveyor shape, respectively. To improve the accuracy, two pieces of information are fused using the adaptive information fusion algorithm. It is observed that, using a marking strategy, the shearer <b>body</b> <b>pitch</b> angle can be reversely mapped to the real-time shape of the scraper conveyor. Then, a virtual-reality (VR) software that can visually simulate this entire operation process under different conditions is developed. Finally, experiments are conducted on a prototype experimental platform. The positioning error is found to be less than 0. 38 times the middle trough length; moreover, no accumulated error is detected. This method can monitor the operation of the shearer and scraper conveyor in a highly dynamic and precise manner and provide strong technical support for safe and efficient operation of a fully mechanized coal-mining face...|$|E

50|$|Although {{the mass}} spring {{mechanism}} {{can be more}} energetically favorable at higher speeds, it also results {{in an increase in}} ground reaction forces and is less stable because there is more movement and pitching of the limbs and core of the body. Ground forces and <b>body</b> <b>pitching</b> movement is less of an issue in the walking gait, where the position of the body's center of mass varies less, making walking an inherently more stable gait. In response to the destabilization of the running gait, the human body appears to have evolved adaptations to increase stabilization, {{as well as for the}} mass-spring mechanism in general. These adaptations, described below, are all evidence for selection for endurance running.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — We {{describe}} the design, testing and tools to build parametric models of a six-legged cockroach-like robot for velocity control without precise knowledge on robot’s geometry or its inertia. Robot legs {{were made by}} Shape Deposition Manufacturing and were compliant at the “knee”. These kinds of robots usually have {{a limited number of}} actuators and a small number of low-cost sensors. Consequently, they are difficult to control with analytic models. Our goal was to design a very fast robot that could run in a straight line over short distances at a desired velocity. We incorporated such legs into a novel body design where position and orientation of the legs were chosen to enhance static stability. Robot design proved to be robust as the machine did not suffer any failure in over 20, 000 runs. We found that <b>body</b> <b>pitch</b> angle was a crucial parameter in control of speed of running. To control this angle, we built a parametric model that related leg orientation to pitch angle. We experimented with various leg stiffness parameters and built a comprehensive parametric model that quantified performance as a function of this parameter, as well as <b>body</b> <b>pitch</b> angle, ground slope, and body mass. When these parameters were optimized, the robot consistently achieved a speed of six body lengths per second, even when pulling a large load {{in the form of a}} trailer cart.

40|$|In {{order to}} achieve powered {{autonomous}} running robots {{it is essential to}} develop efficient actuator systems, especially for generating the radial thrust in the legs. In addition, the control of the radial thrust of the legs can be a simple, effective method for stabilizing the <b>body</b> <b>pitch</b> in a running gait. This paper presents the mechanical systems, models and control strategies employed to generate and control leg thrust in the KOLT quadruped running robot. An analytical model of the electro-pneumatic leg thrusting system is presented and analyzed to evaluate its performance and to facilitate the design of control strategies. Several experiments have been conducted to estimate the energy losses and determine their origins as well as to compute the energetic efficiency of the actuation system. Two thrust control methods are also proposed and tested experimentally. The closed loop method regulates thrust through the control of the hip liftoff speed, a conceptually simple control strategy that stabilizes the <b>body</b> <b>pitch</b> in pronk and trot gaits without the need for central feedback, even on irregular terrain. The open-loop control method regulates the energy added in each hop based on the model of the actuator system. The efficacy of these models and techniques is tested in several planar trot and pronk experiments, and the results are analyzed focusing on the body stabilization, the power consumption and the energetic efficiency. © SAGE Publications 2008 Los Angeles.

A series of sub-scale wind tunnel tests at Re = 1. 4 x 106 on a 6 : 1 prolate spheroid are used to identify potential changes in aerodynamic lift, drag and pitching moment coefficients that are likely to be experienced on the vehicle hull in isolation when in close ground proximity. The experimental data is supported by a preliminary assessment of surface pressure changes using a high order panel method (PANAIR) and RANS CFD simulations to assess the flow structure.

It is shown in simulation that a purely passive tail can stabilize pitch motion and lead to a steady state robot pitch angle in the absence of disturbances.

In order to assess the relative contribution of each of these effects, an experimental study was undertaken {{to examine the effects of}} Mach number, Reynolds number, and ratio of specific heats. Complementary computational solutions were obtained for wind-tunnel and flight conditions. The primary cause of the anomaly was determined to be lower pressures on the aft windward surface of the Orbiter than deduced from hypersonic wind-tunnel tests with ideal- or near-ideal-gas test flow. The lower pressure levels are a result of the lowering of the flowfield gamma due to high-temperature effects.

40|$|Müllerian mimicry is a {{mutualism}} {{involving the}} evolutionary convergence of colour patterns of prey on a warning signal to predators. Behavioural mimicry presumably adds complexity to the signal {{and makes it}} more difficult for Batesian mimics to parasitize it. To date, no one has quantified behavioural mimicry in Müllerian mimicry groups. However, morphological similarities among members of mimicry groups suggested that pitching oscillations of the body and wing-beat frequency (WBF) might converge with colour pattern. I compared the morphology and kinematics of four Heliconius species, which comprised two mimicry pairs. Because the mimics arose from two distinct lineages, the relative contributions of mimicry and phylogeny to variation in the species' morphologies and kinematics were examined. The positions of the centre of body mass and centre of wing mass and wing shape diverged among species within lineages, and converged among species within mimicry groups. WBF converged within mimicry groups, and it was coupled with <b>body</b> <b>pitching</b> frequency. However, body-pitching frequency was too variable to distinguish mimicry groups. Convergence in WBF may be due, at least in part, to biomechanical consequences of similarities in wing length, wing shape or the centre of wing mass among co-mimics. Nevertheless, convergence in WBF among passion-vine butterflies serves as the first evidence of behavioural mimicry in a mutualistic context...|$|R

The ability of NAVs to fly in confined spaces and perform tight maneuvers make them a valuable technological asset. Researching the mechanisms behind small-scale flapping flight promises progress toward the development of such vehicles.
