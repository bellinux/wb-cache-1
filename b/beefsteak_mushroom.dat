Dating from the 19th century, the German term lorchel {{is a result of the}} older lorche, itself from the 18th century Low German Lorken, aligning with the similar-sounding (and similar-looking) morchel.|$|E

It is known more commonly as the elfin saddle or the hooded false morel. Additionally, G.infula is a member of a group of fungi collectively known as [...] "false morels", so named for their resemblance to the highly regarded edible true morels of the genus Morchella. This group includes other species of the genus Gyromitra, such as G.esculenta (brain mushroom), G. caroliniana (<b>beefsteak</b> <b>mushroom)</b> and G. gigas (snow morel).|$|E

"I've been {{infatuated}} {{from time}} to time," [...] I answers, [...] "with fancy ramifications of grub such as terrapins, lobsters, reed birds, jambolaya, and canvas-covered ducks; but after all there's nothing less displeasing to me than a <b>beefsteak</b> smothered in <b>mushrooms</b> on a balcony in sound of the Broadway streetcars, with a hand-organ playing down below, and the boys hollering extras about the latest suicide. For the wine, give me a reasonable Ponty Cany. And that's all, except a demi-tasse." ...|$|R
6000|$|There is {{a gap in}} my {{recollections}} of Clemens, which I think is of a year or two, for the next thing I remember of him is meeting him at a lunch in Boston, given us by that genius of hospitality, the tragically destined Ralph Keeler, author {{of one of the}} most unjustly forgotten books, 'Vagabond Adventures', a true bit of picaresque autobiography. Keeler never had any money, to the general knowledge, and he never borrowed, and he could not have had credit at the restaurant where he invited us to feast at his expense. There was T. B. Aldrich, there was J. T. Fields, much the oldest of our company, who had just freed himself from the trammels of the publishing business, and was feeling his freedom in every word; there was Bret Harte, who had lately come East in his princely progress from California; and there was Clemens. Nothing remains to me of the happy time but a sense of idle and aimless and joyful talk-play, beginning and ending nowhere, of eager laughter, of countless good stories from Fields, of a heat-lightning shimmer of wit from Aldrich, of an occasional concentration of our joint mockeries upon our host, who took it gladly; and amid the discourse, so little improving, but so full of good fellowship, Bret Harte's fleeting dramatization of Clemens's mental attitude toward a symposium of Boston illuminates. [...] "Why, fellows," [...] he spluttered, [...] "this is the dream of Mark's life," [...] and I remember the glance from under Clemens's feathery eyebrows which betrayed his enjoyment of the fun. We had <b>beefsteak</b> with <b>mushrooms,</b> which in recognition of their shape Aldrich hailed as shoe-pegs, and to crown the feast we had an omelette souse, which the waiter brought in as flat as a pancake, amid our shouts of congratulations to poor Keeler, who took them with appreciative submission. It was in every way what a Boston literary lunch ought not to have been in the popular ideal which Harte attributed to Clemens.|$|R
