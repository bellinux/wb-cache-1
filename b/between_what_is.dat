5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the WIPO case Glynnis MacNicol of Mediaite commented that those including Glenn Beck afforded freedom of speech guaranteed by the First Amendment must allow for an Internet environment with the same rights given to everyone. Brayton of ScienceBlogs pointed out that Beck and his lawyers never replied to Randazza's request for all parties to stipulate to the U.S. Constitution and the First Amendment in the case. Brayton observed that this was irrelevant as Beck's case was weak even when examined under the standards of the UN agency. Of Eiland-Hall's decision to turn the domain over to Beck after {{the conclusion}} of the case he commented that this was a wise strategic move. Monica Hesse of The Washington Post remarked upon {{the conclusion of}} the case that the division <b>between</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> considered libel and satire was murky, and asked whether this determination was more difficult to make on the Internet where speech can be amplified by others.|$|E
5|$|M. s. musgravei was {{described}} in 1922 by amateur ornithologist Gregory Mathews as a separate species from the Lake Eyre Basin in central Australia. It is found in mulga and mallee country across much of South Australia and the southern Northern Territory. It has lighter blue or turquoise upperparts than the splendid fairywren, {{as well as a}} black rump. This is largely synonymous with what was known as M. callainus or the turquoise fairywren which had been collected by ornithologist Samuel White and named by John Gould in 1867. The original collection bearing the name callainus was deemed a hybrid <b>between</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> now called musgravei and melanotus, and hence musgravei was resurrected as the name for the turquoise fairywren.|$|E

25|$|Superstition in India is {{considered}} a widespread social problem. Superstition refers to any belief or practice which is explained by supernatural causality, and is in contradiction to modern science.

This article notes beliefs or practices in India, which have been deemed of being superstitions or pseudosciences, though opinions may vary on some issues.|$|E
25|$|The {{commuter}} ferry {{is not a}} new idea. Tradition has it that Native Americans regularly {{crossed the}} Hudson River at the point <b>between</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> now Beacon and Newburgh, long before Europeans arrived in America. In 1743, an “official” ferry was established when Alexander Colden received a royal charter from King George II to carry passengers and goods for profit. The right to operate ferries between Beacon and Newburgh was bestowed upon the Ramsdell family by the heirs of Alexander Colden. They ran the ferry through the Steamboat Era until 1956 when NYSBA took over ferry services.|$|E
25|$|In each case, the {{principal}} distinction <b>between</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> {{and is not}} covered by the AHRA is determined by whether or not the device is marketed or designed (or in the case of media, commonly used by consumers) to make audio recordings, not the device's capabilities. A CD-R recorder included as part of a personal computer would not be a digital audio recording device under the Act, since the personal computer was not marketed primarily for making copies of music. The same recorder, sold as a peripheral and marketed {{for the express purpose of}} making digital audio recordings, would fall under the Act's definition of a recording device.|$|E
