50|$|A <b>beam</b> <b>coupling,</b> {{also known}} as helical coupling, is a {{flexible}} coupling for transmitting torque between two shafts while allowing for angular misalignment, parallel offset and even axial motion, of one shaft relative to the other. This design utilizes {{a single piece of}} material and becomes flexible by removal of material along a spiral path resulting in a curved flexible beam of helical shape. Since it is made from a single piece of material, the Beam Style coupling does not exhibit the backlash found in some multi-piece couplings. Another advantage of being an all machined coupling is the possibility to incorporate features into the final product while still keep the single piece integrity.|$|E

40|$|The {{strength}} and ductility of the <b>coupling</b> <b>beams</b> in <b>coupled</b> shear walls can significantly affect the nonlinear behaviour and earthquake resistance of the whole building structure. However, although extensive testing of <b>coupling</b> <b>beams</b> has been performed, the boundary conditions-that the rotations at the two ends of a <b>coupling</b> <b>beam</b> are equal and that local deformation occurs at the beam-wall joints, which could have substantial influence on the test results-have not been correctly simulated. Herein, a new method of testing reinforced concrete <b>coupling</b> <b>beams</b> that ensures equal rotations {{at the ends of}} the beam specimen and takes into account local deformation at the beam-wall joints is developed.

30|$|Given the {{aforementioned}} concerns, {{the aim of}} the present work was to develop simple reinforcement details for diagonally reinforced <b>coupling</b> <b>beams.</b> For developing a simple reinforcement details for <b>coupling</b> <b>beams</b> and improving their seismic behavior, several studies have been also carried out using fiber reinforced <b>coupling</b> <b>beams</b> (Canbolat et al. 2005; Lequesne et al. 2010). This study also focused on application of HPFRCC to diagonally reinforced <b>coupling</b> <b>beams.</b> In particular, the effect of HPFRCCs in <b>coupling</b> <b>beams</b> with bundled diagonal reinforcement is investigated for the purpose of reducing the amount of transverse reinforcement required. In addition, to simplify construction as much as possible, the feasibility of precast <b>coupling</b> <b>beam</b> construction was explored.

40|$|The {{concept of}} <b>beam</b> <b>coupling</b> {{impedance}} describes the electromagnetic interaction of uniformly moving charged particles with their surrounding {{structures in the}} Frequency Domain (FD). In synchrotron accelerators, <b>beam</b> <b>coupling</b> impedances can lead to beam induced component heating and coherent beam instabilities. Thus, {{in order to ensure}} the stable operation of a synchrotron, its impedances have to be quantified and their effects have to be controlled. Nowadays, <b>beam</b> <b>coupling</b> impedances are mostly obtained by Fourier transform of wake potentials, which are the results of Time Domain (TD) simulations. However, at low frequencies, low beam velocity, or for dispersive materials, TD simulations become unhandy. In this area, analytical calculations of <b>beam</b> <b>coupling</b> impedance in the FD, combined with geometry approximations, are still widely used. This thesis describes the development of two electromagnetic field solvers to obtain the <b>beam</b> <b>coupling</b> impedance directly in the FD, where the beam velocity is only a parameter and dispersive materials can be included easily. One solver is based on the Finite Integration Technique (FIT) on a staircase mesh. It is implemented both in 2 D and 3 D. However, the staircase mesh is inefficient on curved structures, which is particularly problematic for the modeling of a dipole source, that is required for the computation of the transverse <b>beam</b> <b>coupling</b> impedance. This issue is overcome by the second solver developed in this thesis, which is based on the Finite Element Method (FEM) on an unstructured triangular mesh. It is implemented in 2 D and includes an optional Surface Impedance Boundary Condition (SIBC). Thus, it is well suited for the computation of longitudinal and transverse impedances of long beam pipe structures of arbitrary cross-section. Besides arbitrary frequency and beam velocity, also dispersive materials can be chosen, which is crucial for the computation of the impedance of ferrite kicker magnets. Numerical impedance simulations always contain simplifications, therefore they have to be confirmed by dedicated measurements. However, the <b>beam</b> <b>coupling</b> impedance of a single accelerator component cannot be measured directly. Therefore, a dedicated RF-laboratory was established at GSI, in order to measure broadband <b>beam</b> <b>coupling</b> impedances on the bench by means of the wire method, i. e. without beam. A detailed analysis of measurement methods is given by comparison of analytical, numerical, and measurement results for simplified accelerator devices. One conclusion is, that also the bench measurements have to be validated by dedicated electromagnetic simulations.
