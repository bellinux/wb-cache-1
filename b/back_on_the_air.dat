25|$|At {{the height}} of the People Power Revolution, {{military}} reformists, believing that television would be a powerful tool to aid the revolution, attacked and took over the ABS-CBN Broadcasting Center.

50|$|In {{all types}} of {{tarantula}} there are two sets of book lungs (breathing organs). The first pair of book lungs {{is located in a}} cavity inside the lower front part of the abdomen near where the abdomen connects to the cephalothorax and the second pair slightly farther <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> abdomen. <b>Air</b> enters <b>the</b> cavity through a tiny slit on each side of and near the front of the abdomen. Each lung consists of 15 or more thin sheets of folded tissue arranged like the pages of a book. These sheets of tissue are supplied by blood vessels. As air enters each lung, oxygen is taken into the blood stream through the blood vessels in the lungs. Needed moisture may also be absorbed from humid air by these organs.|$|R

60|$|So {{she kept}} on, {{now and then}} gazing at the smoke. As she grew nearer to the first {{monument}} she was surprised, then amazed, at its height and surpassing size. It was mountain-high--a grand tower--smooth, worn, glistening, yellow and red. The trail she had followed petered out in a deep wash, and beyond that she crossed no more trails. The sage had grown meager and the greasewoods stunted and dead; and cacti appeared <b>on</b> barren places. <b>The</b> grass had not failed, {{but it was not}} rich grass such as the horses and cattle grazed upon miles <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> slope. <b>The</b> <b>air</b> was hot down here. The breeze was heavy and smelled of fire, and the sand was blowing here and there. She had a sense of the bigness, the openness of this valley, and then she realized its wildness and strangeness. These lonely, isolated monuments made the place different from any she had visited. They did not seem mere standing rocks. They seemed to retreat all the time as she approached, and they watched her. They interested her, made her curious. What had formed all these strange monuments? Here the ground was level for miles and miles, to slope gently up to the bases of these huge rocks. In an old book she had seen pictures of the Egyptian pyramids, but these appeared vaster, higher, and stranger, and they were sheerly perpendicular.|$|R

Iles sketched out several clothing ideas for Peter to wear. He got ideas by flipping through catalogs.
