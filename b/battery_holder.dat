2500|$|Some guitar tuners {{fit into}} the {{instrument}} itself. Typical of these are the Sabine AX3000 and the [...] "NTune" [...] device. The NTune consists of a switching potentiometer, a wiring harness, illuminated plastic display disc, a circuit board and a <b>battery</b> <b>holder.</b> The unit installs in place of an electric guitar's existing volume knob control. The unit functions as a regular volume knob when not in tuner mode. To operate the tuner, the player pulls the volume knob up. The tuner disconnects the guitar's output so the tuning process is not amplified. The lights on the illuminated ring, under the volume knob, indicate the note being tuned. When the note is in tune a green [...] "in tune" [...] indicator light illuminates. After tuning is complete the musician pushes the volume knob back down, disconnecting the tuner from the circuit and re-connecting the pickups to the output jack.|$|E
50|$|Design of the <b>battery</b> <b>holder</b> {{requires}} {{knowledge of}} how and where the larger product will be used. Human factors to be considered include ease of battery exchange, age range and physical condition of the intended user. These elements {{must be taken into}} account for a design to be successful and are part of the design process. A designer must select between a <b>battery</b> <b>holder</b> molded into the product case or made as a separate part. For many products regulations and product safety standards affect the <b>battery</b> <b>holder</b> selection.|$|E

50|$|The {{electronics}} industry now uses many {{surface mounted}} lithium <b>battery</b> <b>holders</b> or sockets. CR2/3A, CR1/2AA and CR123A batteries began in camera applications, but expanded into new markets like alarm systems, hand held computers, and keyfobs.|$|R
5000|$|The plastic <b>battery</b> <b>holder</b> on the T90 is {{somewhat}} susceptible to breakage, {{and can cause}} the camera to become inoperative. Used cameras should be carefully checked for broken/repaired <b>battery</b> <b>holder</b> compartments. Another common problem is failure of the second internal battery that retains frame number/ISO settings, replacement of which requires service by a person skilled in soldering techniques and camera disassembly.|$|E
50|$|Cold-weather <b>battery</b> <b>holder</b> was {{available}} from 1969 and minor changes {{were applied to}} the appearance. The cold-weather <b>battery</b> <b>holder</b> allowed the relocation of the battery by using a long cord with a dummy battery carrier and receptacle for the original <b>battery</b> <b>holder</b> to then {{be placed in a}} warm pocket to avoid battery failure due to cold. Along with the availability macro lenses for close work, a selection of extension tubes and in both the standard bayonet and the outer bayonet were available as well. As well as a compact and convenient variable extension was also available. For more flexibility a bellows system {{was available}} as well as a slide copier accessory.|$|E

50|$|There {{is a lot}} of {{uncertainty}} as to the effects of <b>battery</b> <b>holders</b> and <b>batteries</b> on the environment. The debate is evolving alongside developments in environmental awareness, such as concerns over global warming and e-waste. There are concerns that devices, such as cell phones and iPods, are heavily contributing to this through their use of soldered in batteries, which could be made removable and therefore replaceable. This could improve the life of each unit while reducing the amount of e-waste generated.|$|R
5000|$|When the Thunderware Thunderclock Plus was {{released}} in 1980, it quickly became the de facto standard for an Apple II system clock. When Apple Computer released its new ProDOS operating system in 1984, a Thunderclock software driver came built-in. From that point on, all new Apple II system clocks strived to emulate the Thunderclock. The card itself was more compact than the earlier [...] "The Clock" [...] from Mountain Computers and contained two <b>battery</b> <b>holders</b> for off the shelf alkaline batteries which were easily replaceable.|$|R

The capsules usually have six hollow octagonal connectors pointing out, where an octagonal sleeve piece bridges between two capsules. The hollow connection pegs on a capsule can have electrical or rotary adapters inside, reaching into the next capsule. There are electric motor capsules, gear capsules, switch capsules, pontoon capsules, and others; there are also <b>battery</b> <b>holders,</b> wheels, propellers, impellers, lights, wires, and other miscellaneous supporting pieces.|$|R
5000|$|Many {{parts were}} {{introduced}} since the Liverpool factory closed under the French-and-Japanese {{running of the}} company. These included plastic parts, can motors, and modern <b>battery</b> <b>holders.</b> Metal became an expensive raw material {{to work with and}} many of the metal parts were replaced with plastic parts. Allen (hex-headed) zinc electroplated steel bolts replaced the slotted bolts. Some Meccano modellers enthusiastically embrace the changes and new parts. However, the [...] "purists" [...] look down on these new parts. Some enthusiasts set self-imposed limits on using only parts deemed to be traditional and steer clear of those parts viewed as “not truly Meccano”.|$|R

Galaxy Note II displays the notification message built in the firmware when it is charged wirelessly. SCH-L900 does not have the pins. SGH-T889 has the pins, but they are disabled.|$|E
40|$|Wearable {{technology}} is an emerging multidisciplinary field. When designing wearables, one must draw upon an understanding of: the available soft materials; {{the motion of}} the body; as well as comfort, fashion, and social implications. There is a lot of current research exploring manufacturing processes and user's needs for wearable products, but there are not many products available on the market. Medicine is one field that can benefit from the use of these design principles, however. Patients that require constant care or treatment for chronic diseases have few choices available to them in terms of medical devices. Many available medical products focus only on their functionality, and neglect fashion, convenience, and comfort. Arthritis and other rheumatic diseases are the cause of most disabilities in the United States, and cause chronic pain in joints all over the body. There are few non-invasive treatments available to patients suffering with these diseases, so this project seeks to fill that gap in the market. The Selectively Heated Therapeutic Sweater allows the patient freedom to choose where and when heat treatment is applied to their joints throughout the day. It also takes into consideration their right to privacy and makes the treatment as unobtrusive to daily life as possible. Conductive fabric was used as a resistive heater powered by low-profile button batteries. The connections of this battery pack were made by using fabric snaps which allow for temporary placement and easy removal for washing. The sweater functioned as anticipated, but could have been improved through the use of soft <b>battery</b> <b>holders</b> and conductive threads. Thesis (S. B.)

40|$|The Embedded Information Systems Research Group (EISRG) {{being part}} of the Budapest University of Technology and Economics (Budapest, Hungary) {{launched}} the development of a modularized electronic device which will help their students to be introduced in the area of embedded information systems design and application within the frameworks of the Embedded Information Systems Engineering (EISE) major. The device is formed by several modules with many different functions: microprocessor module, radio communication module, accoustical module, Ethernet interface module etc. Within this project, the demand for a motorized mobile rolling subsystem appeared. This would serve to transport the modularized device. For this purpose, not only the transporting mechanics and the motor control hardware has to be worked out but a motor control software has to be implemented as well. During this semester this subsystem has been developed by the author. The developed subsystem consists of two driving motors, a mechanical structure carrying the motors and the electronics, two separated electrical supply system (<b>battery</b> and accumulator <b>holders)</b> for the motors and the modularized electronics, two optical detector modules for motor revolution speed sensing, an 8 -bit Atmel AVR microcontroller -based motor control module and a positioner servo motor with limited rotation and integrated closed-loop position control electronics. The closed loop control algorithm of the driving motors is executed by the microcontroller of the motor control module. The main functions of the subsystem are tested by some special test software implemented by the author. With slight modifications, these software components together will constitute the final control software with a cascade closed-loop control algorithm. Current document aims to present in details the steps of {{the development and implementation of}} the above subsystem, therefore, to certify the suitability of the subsystem for the objectives announced by EISRG and to proove the competency of the author in embedded electronic system engineering. First, the possibilities in hardware design are presented with enough details for an appropriate selection of the most suitable solutions for the current project. Second, the details of software-hardware design are shown with additional calclations and simulation results. Third, the current state of the subsystem is presented and finally, some potential improvements are proposed...|$|R
