25|$|KDE SC 4.5 was {{released}} on 10 August 2010. New features include {{the integration of the}} WebKit library, an open-source web <b>browser</b> <b>engine,</b> which is used in major browsers such as Apple Safari and Google Chrome. KDE's own KHTML engine will continue to be developed.|$|E
500|$|Instead of {{developing}} a custom web <b>browser</b> <b>engine</b> Epiphany originally used the Gecko layout engine until version 2.28 and WebKitGTK+ starting with version 2.20. This approach allows the relatively small developer community to maintain a sufficient level of modern web standards support. The features of Web include reuse of GNOME configuration settings, smart bookmarks and web application integration into user desktop.|$|E

This is done by desktop publishing software, typesetting software and web <b>browser</b> <b>engines.</b> These in turn include font layout and rendering engines, that calculate the correct position of glyphs, which can be a challenge with complex scripts. Images can also be embedded in the text.|$|R

50|$|While Safari pioneered several now {{standard}} HTML5 features (such as the Canvas API) in {{its early}} years, it has increasingly come under attack for failing {{to keep pace with}} modern web standards. This, coupled with Apple's policy of not allowing third party <b>browser</b> <b>engines</b> under iOS has been viewed as stifling the web experience on Apple devices. This is also the subject of an ongoing lawsuit in France.|$|R

50|$|The widget set library {{that comes}} with pyjs is so similar to PyQt and PyGTK that a port of pyjs was made to run pyjs {{applications}} on the desktop, called pyjs Desktop (formerly PyjamasDesktop before May 2012 and originally hosted separately prior to version 0.6). The project uses Webkit, XULRunner or MSHTML as the underlying technology, and it is through these <b>browser</b> <b>engines</b> that pyjs manipulates the DOM model of the application. Together pyjs and pyjs Desktop allow writing cross-platform, cross-desktop, cross-browser and cross-widget applications that run on the web and on the desktop.|$|R

40|$|Abstract New web {{technologies}} led to {{the development}} of browser applications for data analysis. Modern <b>browser</b> <b>engines</b> allow for building interactive real-time visualization applications that enable efficient ways to understand complex data. We present Flow-Inspector, a highly interactive open-source web framework for visualizing network flow data using latest web technologies. Flow-Inspector includes a backend for processing and storing large-scale network flow data, as well as a JavaScript-based web application capable to display and manipulate traffic information in real-time. This work provides operators with a toolkit to analyze their networks and enables the scientific community to create new and innovative visualizations of traffic data with an extensible framework. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach by implementing several different visualization components that help to identify topological characteristics in network flows. ...|$|R

5000|$|In pre-HTML5 browsers, pages {{dynamically}} created using successive Ajax requests did {{not automatically}} register {{themselves with the}} <b>browser's</b> history <b>engine,</b> so clicking the browser's [...] "back" [...] button may not have returned the browser to an earlier state of the Ajax-enabled page, but may have instead returned to the last full page visited before it. Such behavior — navigating between pages instead of navigating between page states — may be desirable, but if fine-grained tracking of page state is required, then a pre-HTML5 workaround was to use invisible iframes to trigger changes in the browser's history. A workaround implemented by Ajax techniques {{is to change the}} URL fragment identifier (the part of a URL after the [...] "#") when an Ajax-enabled page is accessed and monitor it for changes. HTML5 provides an extensive API standard for working with the <b>browser's</b> history <b>engine.</b>|$|R
