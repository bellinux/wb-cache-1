25|$|Rev. Parris runs <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> {{and various}} villagers arrive: {{the wealthy and}} {{influential}} Thomas and his wife, Ann Putnam, respected local woman Rebecca Nurse, and the Putnam's neighbor, farmer Giles Corey. The villagers, who had not heard the argument, assume that the hymn had caused Betty's screaming, Tensions between them soon emerge. Mrs. Putnam is a bereaved parent seven times over; she blames witchcraft for her losses and Betty's ailment. Rebecca is rational and suggests a doctor be called instead. Mr. Putnam and Corey have been feuding over land ownership. Parris is unhappy with his salary and living conditions as minister, and accuses Proctor of heading a conspiracy to oust him from the church. Abigail, standing quietly in a corner, witnesses all of this.|$|E
500|$|Stepping <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom,</b> {{the woman}} {{turns to face}} the man and confronts him, asking slowly [...] "what the fuck is going on?" [...] He motions to her to join him {{on the bed and}} at her prompting, he reveals in the ensuing {{conversation}} that he has been living in the hotel room for [...] "more than a month", and that he had left to escape their relationship. They lie back on the bed looking at one another before being interrupted by the arrival of room service. Once alone again, the two kiss and the man begins to undress the woman. They have an uncomfortable exchange about not having slept with other people and when he notices bruises on her arm after undressing her further, the woman chooses not to comment on them. Lying on top of him, she tells the man that she does not want to lose his friendship, that she loves him and never meant to hurt him. He responds coldly that he [...] "will never be [...] friend", but holds her when she embraces him. [...] "Where Do You Go To (My Lovely)?" [...] starts again and the man offers to show the woman his view of Paris.|$|E
60|$|HODSON [appearing at {{the bedroom}} door] Yes sir. [He turns to go <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom.</b>|$|E
60|$|Mr. Tod came <b>back</b> {{yet again}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> with a clothes line. He stood a minute {{watching}} Tommy Brock and listening attentively to the snores. They were very loud indeed, but seemed quite natural.|$|R
6000|$|The {{effect was}} nearly instantaneous; the sinking vital forces rallied desperately. The old man's eyes opened again, wandered round the room, then fixed {{themselves}} intently on Francois {{as he stood}} near the fire. Trying and terrible as his position was at that moment, Gabriel still retained self-possession enough to whisper a few words in Perrine's ear. [...] "Go <b>back</b> again <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom,</b> and take <b>the</b> children with you," [...] he said. [...] "We {{may have something to}} speak about which you had better not hear." ...|$|R
60|$|Holmes {{said little}} more, but {{the picture of}} the old roysterer seemed to have a fascination for him, and his eyes were {{continually}} fixed upon it during supper. It was not until later, when Sir Henry had gone to his room, that I was able to follow the trend of his thoughts. He led me <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> banqueting-hall, his <b>bedroom</b> candle in his hand, and he held it up against the time-stained portrait on the wall.|$|R
6000|$|... "Where did he go?" [...] {{questioned}} Dave, and at {{the same}} time bounded <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom,</b> to don his shoes and part of his clothing.|$|E
60|$|At last, George took Emmy's hand, {{and led her}} <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom,</b> {{from whence}} he came out alone. The parting {{had taken place in}} that moment, and he was gone.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{can take}} it from me, we won't stay here an hour longer than we have to," [...] {{declared}} Werner. And then he turned <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> to finish his dressing, {{closing the door behind}} him.|$|E

The singer manages to trick Larky, steal his clothes and lock him into a room. Still in his underwear, the singer meets Sonya when she arrives to the apartment with a private investigator who she has hired to follow her husband.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, Seth {{arrives at}} the police station, where he is scolded and the police dismiss his story and {{threaten}} {{to put him in}} jail. Seth sneaks away, steals a shotgun and buckshot shells, and climbs out a window. He then hijacks a car from a man and tells him he's going to Garth Manor. Seth arrives at Garth Manor where he follows one of the Garth sons from the main gate and {{through a hole in the}} fence surrounding the house. He is attacked by the second Garth son, but manages to shoot him to death. Seth finds Marti and Jeff in the parlor, but is grabbed by Andrew who drags him <b>into</b> <b>the</b> darkness; Marti and Jeff hear a gunshot, and watch the shotgun slide alone across the floor. They think for a minute if Seth is still alive or dead. Marti attempts to obtain the shotgun, but Andrew lunges from the darkness and chases Jeff and Marti <b>back</b> upstairs <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom.</b> Marti escapes out the window onto the roof, but Jeff is thrown to his death by Andrew.|$|R
50|$|After the Butabi {{brothers}} reconcile {{with their}} father and Doug moves <b>back</b> <b>into</b> their <b>bedroom,</b> <b>the</b> film ends as the brothers happen upon a hot new club. The building is unique in that the exterior is constructed to resemble {{the interior of a}} nightclub, and the interior resembles a street—this was an idea pitched by Doug and Steve to Zadir earlier in the film. Attempting to enter, they are surprised to find their names already on the VIP list. In addition, Zadir reveals that to reward their idea, he has made them part-owners of the club. Their new-found success comes full circle when they meet two women in the club: Doug's phone operator from the credit card company ("Credit Vixen") and a police officer with whom Steve flirted while getting a ticket.|$|R
6000|$|... "I went <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom.</b> He {{was still}} unconscious, and the terrier whining. In {{the next room}} a child was crying--the very same young man we buried to-day. Mrs. Godwin was still {{standing}} by the bed.|$|E
6000|$|He came <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> {{about an}} hour {{afterwards}} {{a little out of}} breath and pale. [...] "Where you been?" [...] said Buggins, who was now reading the Daily World Manager, which came to him in rotation from Carshot.|$|E
60|$|Ethel {{returned}} {{through the}} folding doors. She glanced at Lewisham, remained standing for awhile, {{sat down in}} the basket chair as if to resume some domestic needlework that lay upon the table, then rose and went <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom.</b>|$|E
6000|$|She follows <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom.</b> <b>The</b> maid ANNIE {{puts her}} head out of [...] the kitchen door; she comes out a step as if to fly; then, at [...] BUILDER'S voice, shrinks <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> kitchen.|$|R
6000|$|They go <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> to get <b>the</b> trunk. CLARE {{picks up}} from [...] the floor the bunch of violets, her fingers {{play with it}} as if [...] they did not quite know what it was; and she stands by the [...] {{armchair}} very still, while MRS. MILER and the PORTER pass her [...] with trunk and bag. And even after the PORTER has shouldered [...] the trunk outside, and marched away, and MRS. MILER has come [...] <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> room, CLARE still stands there.|$|R
60|$|His assailant did not answer. He {{raised the}} table-cloth and looked underneath, retreated <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom,</b> sought {{in vain for}} any signs of an intruder. Then he came slowly <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> sitting-room, and {{the eyes of the}} two men met. Norris Vine was leaning back against the sideboard, his clothes disarranged, his collar torn, his tie hanging down in strips. In his shaking hand was the glass of brandy, half consumed. There was a livid mark upon his face, and his eyes were wide open and staring.|$|R
6000|$|... "Something is wrong, that's sure!" [...] exclaimed the youth. Rushing <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> {{he shook}} Roger vigorously. At {{the same time}} he heard others getting up and calling to each other, wanting to know what the shouts and shots meant.|$|E
60|$|Dr Macphail crept <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom,</b> {{put on a}} {{waterproof}} over his pyjamas, {{and a pair of}} rubber-soled shoes. He rejoined the trader, and together they tiptoed down the stairs. The door leading out to the road was open and at it were standing half a dozen natives.|$|E
6000|$|Aben Hassen the Fool, {{not knowing}} what to think or what was to happen, ran <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> again. [...] "I think {{everybody}} in this place has gone mad," [...] said he. [...] "Nevertheless, if I do not find out what it all means, I shall go mad myself." ...|$|E
60|$|Billy, who {{had taken}} no part in the conversation, got up, glanced <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> off <b>the</b> kitchen, went <b>into</b> <b>the</b> parlor and <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> off <b>the</b> parlor, then {{returned}} and stood gazing with puzzled brows <b>into</b> <b>the</b> kitchen <b>bedroom.</b>|$|R

60|$|Chaffery {{proceeded}} to expatiate on the transitory nature {{of passion and}} all glorious and acute experiences. Whole passages of that discourse Lewisham did not hear, so intent was he upon those roses. Why had Ethel gone <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom?</b> Was it possible--? Presently she returned, but she sat down {{so that he could}} not see her face.|$|E
60|$|She turned <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom,</b> and Dicky Weed ground 'is teeth {{together}} and told Bill Chambers {{that the next}} time he took 'is advice he'd remember it. He stood there trembling all over with temper, and when Mrs. Pretty came to the winder agin and dropped the coat on his 'ead and said that Bob felt his kindness very much, and he 'oped Dicky ud make a good job of it, because it was 'is favrite coat, he couldn't speak. He stood there shaking all over till Mrs. Pretty 'ad shut the winder down agin, and then 'e turned to the conjurer, as 'ad come up with the rest of us, and asked 'im wot {{he was going to do}} about it now.|$|E
6000|$|... "Soon {{after three}} this morning," [...] says she, [...] "I was woke by {{the screams of}} Mrs. Zebedee. I found her {{out here on the}} landing, and Mr. Deluc, in great alarm, trying to quiet her. Sleeping in the next room he had only to open his door, when her screams woke him. 'My dear John's murdered! I am the miserable wretch--I did it in my sleep!' She {{repeated}} these frantic words over and over again, until she dropped in a swoon. Mr. Deluc and I carried her <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom.</b> We both thought the poor creature had been driven distracted by some dreadful dream. But {{when we got to the}} bedside--don't ask me what we saw; the doctor has told you about it already. I was once a nurse in a hospital, and accustomed, as such, to horrid sights. It turned me cold and giddy, notwithstanding. As for Mr. Deluc, I thought he would have had a fainting fit next." ...|$|E
60|$|Mrs Ford {{turned away}} without speaking, and went <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom.</b>|$|R
60|$|He fidgeted <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> {{and stopped}} as dead as a pointer.|$|R
60|$|He stood aside, {{and without}} another word she passed on <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom.</b>|$|R
60|$|But he felt thirsty, {{and went}} into the kitchen to get himself some water. Here, too, was order. On a rack were the plates that she had used for dinner on the night of her quarrel with Strickland, and they had been {{carefully}} washed. The knives and forks were put away in a drawer. Under a cover were the remains of a piece of cheese, and in a tin box was a crust of bread. She had done her marketing from day to day, buying only what was strictly needful, so that nothing was left over from one day to the next. Stroeve knew from the enquiries made by the police that Strickland had walked out of the house immediately after dinner, and the fact that Blanche had washed up the things as usual gave him a little thrill of horror. Her methodicalness made her suicide more deliberate. Her self-possession was frightening. A sudden pang seized him, and his knees felt so weak that he almost fell. He went <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> and threw himself on the bed. He cried out her name.|$|E
60|$|She {{rang the}} bell for the second time. Only the femme de chambre {{answered}} the summons. Madame's maid {{was not to be}} found. Madame had not once retired so early. It was possible that Susanne had gone out. Could she be of any service? Violet looked at her and hesitated. The woman was clumsy-fingered and none too tidy. She shook her head and sent her away. For a moment she thought of undressing herself. Then instead she opened her satchel and counted the notes. Her breath came more quickly as she looked at the shower of gold and counted the many oblong strips of paper with their magic lettering. At last she had it all in heaps. There were the twenty-five mille he had left with her, and the seventy-five mille she had borrowed from him. Then towards her own losses there was another mille, and a matter of five hundred francs in gold. And all this success, her wonderful recovery, had been done so easily! It was just because she had had the pluck to go on, because she had followed her vein. She looked at the money and she walked to the window. Somewhere a band was playing in the distance. Little parties {{of men and women in}} evening dress were strolling by on their way to the Club. A woman was laughing as she clung to her escort on the opposite side of the road, by the gardens. Across at the Café de Paris the people were going in to supper. The spirit of enjoyment seemed to be in the air--the light-hearted, fascinating, devil-may-care atmosphere she knew so well. Violet looked <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> and she no longer had the impulse to sleep. Her face had hardened a little. Every one was so happy and she was so lonely. She stuffed the notes and gold back into her bag, looked at her hat in the glass and touched her face for a moment with a powder-puff. Then she left the room, rang for the lift and descended.|$|E
50|$|Scene 4: The Corregidor, awoken by Lukas, {{cautiously}} {{comes out}} of the bedroom. Vexed that his own clothes have apparently been stolen, he puts on those that Lukas left behind. The Alkalde enters with Frasquita, Tonuelo and Repela, but they do not yet notice the Corregidor, who tries to slip <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom.</b>|$|E
60|$|DANCY. [After a moment's silence] Go ahead! He {{goes out}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom.</b>|$|R
50|$|Jeff: (to Val {{while trying}} to push <b>the</b> {{mattress}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom)</b> I have a situation.|$|R
6000|$|After a few {{preliminary}} {{words on}} either side, Mr. Merrick sent <b>the</b> landlady <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> {{to see if}} his patient was awake or asleep. The woman returned, {{and said she was}} [...] "betwixt the two, light in the head again, and burning hot." [...] The doctor went at once <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom,</b> telling <b>the</b> landlady to follow him, and to close the door behind her.|$|R
