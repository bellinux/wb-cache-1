25|$|Officially {{established}} on 27 December 1945, when the 29 participating countries {{at the conference}} of Bretton Woods signed its Articles of Agreement, the IMF {{was to be the}} keeper of the rules and the main instrument of public international management. The Fund commenced its financial operations on 1 March 1947. IMF approval was necessary for any change in exchange rates in excess of 10%. It advised countries on policies affecting the monetary system and lent reserve currencies to nations that had incurred <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> debts.|$|E
25|$|The IMF was {{designed}} to advance credits to countries with balance of payments deficits. Short-run <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> difficulties would be overcome by IMF loans, which would facilitate stable currency exchange rates. This flexibility meant a member state {{would not have to}} induce a depression to cut its national income down to such a low level that its imports would finally fall within its means. Thus, countries were to be spared the need to resort to the classical medicine of deflating themselves into drastic unemployment when faced with chronic balance of payments deficits. Before the Second World War, European nations—particularly Britain—often resorted to this.|$|E
25|$|In {{an angry}} {{response}} to Smoot–Hawley, Canada welcomed the British introduction of trade protectionism {{and a system}} of Commonwealth preference {{during the winter of}} 1931-32. It helped Canada avoid external default on their public debt during the Great Depression. Canada had a high degree of exposure to the international economy, which left Canada susceptible to any international economic downturn. The onset of the depression created critical <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> deficits, and it was largely the extension of imperial protection by Britain that gave Canada the opportunity to increase their exports to the British market. By 1938 Britain was importing more than twice the 1929 volume of products from Australia, while the value of products shipped from Canada more than doubled, despite the dramatic drop in prices. Thus, the British market played a vital role in helping Canada and Australia stabilize their balance of payments in the immensely difficult economic conditions of the 1930s.|$|E

The investigation reveals that fiscal balance, GDP and interest rate are the main determinants <b>of</b> <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> in Namibia.
