5|$|Difficulties {{arise in}} tracing {{the history of}} design {{management}}. Even though design management as an expression is first mentioned in literature in 1964, earlier contributions created {{the context in which}} the expression could arise. Throughout its history, design management was influenced by a number of different disciplines: architecture, industrial design, management, software development, engineering; and movements such as system theory, design methodologies. It cannot <b>be</b> <b>attributed</b> directly to either design nor to management.|$|E

5|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} renewed {{interest}} in Nepenthes worldwide. Much of the plants' current popularity can probably <b>be</b> <b>attributed</b> to Shigeo Kurata, whose book Nepenthes of Mount Kinabalu (1976), which featured the best colour photography of Nepenthes to date, did much to bring attention to these unusual plants.|$|E
5|$|Irofulven, a {{compound}} derived from illuden S, is undergoing phase II clinical trials {{as a possible}} therapy for various types of cancers.

5|$|It is {{very obvious}} to me that you must remove Sir George Prevost. I see he has gone to war about trifles with the general {{officers}} I sent him, which are certainly the best of their rank in the army; and his subsequent failure and distresses will be aggravated by that circumstance; and will probably with the usual fairness of the public <b>be</b> <b>attributed</b> to it.|$|E

5|$|It often also {{falls in}} the same range for {{reaction}} order, resembling terbium and dysprosium in its chemical reactivity. Yttrium is so close in size to the so-called 'yttrium group' of heavy lanthanide ions that in solution, it behaves {{as if it were}} one of them. Even though the lanthanides are one row farther down the periodic table than yttrium, the similarity in atomic radius may <b>be</b> <b>attributed</b> to the lanthanide contraction.|$|E
5|$|Leeds, {{like many}} {{industrial}} cities, has little remaining medieval architecture. The lack of Medieval architecture in central Leeds may <b>be</b> <b>attributed</b> {{to the small}} size of the town during the majority of the period, the population usually being around 1,000. At the time there were several larger settlements in Yorkshire such as Wakefield and York.|$|E
5|$|Most of Iniki's damage {{occurred}} in Kauai. On the island, one person died when struck by debris, while another lost her life when {{a portion of}} her house fell on her. Offshore, two Japanese nationals died when their boat capsized. The reduced death toll was likely due to well-executed warnings and preparation. More than 100injuries can <b>be</b> <b>attributed</b> to Iniki, though most {{occurred in}} the aftermath of the hurricane.|$|E

5|$|Newton's Third Law is {{a result}} of {{applying}} symmetry to situations where forces can <b>be</b> <b>attributed</b> to the presence of different objects.

5|$|Psychiatric {{problems}} due to Wilson's {{disease may}} include behavioral changes, depression, anxiety disorders, and psychosis. Psychiatric symptoms are commonly seen {{in conjunction with}} neurological symptoms and are rarely manifested on their own.

Because of this, diagnosis of Wilson's disease is rarely made when only psychiatric symptoms are present.|$|E
5|$|Several {{negative}} effects may <b>be</b> <b>attributed</b> to the drinking of hot chocolate. The types {{and severity of}} health risks vary between different styles of hot chocolate.

5|$|The 1963 census {{indicated}} that 47% of Nigerians were Muslim, 35% Christian, and 18% members of local indigenous congregations. If accurate, this indicated a sharp increase since 1953 {{in the number}} of Christians (up 23%); a decline among those professing indigenous beliefs, compared with 20%; and only a modest (6%) drop of Muslims which can likely <b>be</b> <b>attributed</b> to immigration, emigration, and birthrate.|$|E

The successful Union assault can <b>be</b> <b>attributed</b> in large part to African-American forces.|$|E
5|$|The low status of—and {{subsequent}} discrimination against—women in India can <b>be</b> <b>attributed</b> to many cultural norms. Societal {{forces of}} patriarchy, hierarchy and multigenerational families contribute to Indian gender roles.

This societal structure is exemplified with women’s low participation within India’s national parliament and the labour force.|$|E
5|$|The {{reason for}} this {{grouping}} is unclear; they certainly cannot <b>be</b> <b>attributed</b> to an attempt to match {{the lay of the}} river bed.
