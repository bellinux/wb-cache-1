40|$|Aspects of {{stability}} of access tunnels with particular {{reference to the}} factors controlling face access tunnel closure upon the efficiency of coal production and safety of longwall mining operations are investigated. These are used to justify the present studies of tunnel stability and <b>barrier</b> <b>pillar</b> design in mines of the Cape Breton Coalfield. An analysis of in situ deformation data of 26 face access tunnels by tunnel convergence measurement and a new photographic technique for approximately 40 km of tunnels are presented. Comparative studies of these techniques are made and deformation characteristics with respect to depth of cover, panel width, extracted seam height, <b>barrier</b> <b>pillar</b> width, type of steel arch supports {{and the effect of}} adjacent workings are investigated. Due to the narrow range of field data, the effect of such parameters as extracted seam height, panel width, tunnel shape and tunnel size could not be examined, nor could the influence which the material properties may have on tunnel closure be identified. Hence, comprehensive parametric studies by two dimensional finite element simulation of the face access tunnels by use of MSAP 2 D are undertaken. Stress and displacement distributions and the extent of any failed zone around the tunnel with respect to the aforementioned parameters together with <b>barrier</b> <b>pillar</b> width, and the stiffness of the surrounding materials are considered. The existing theories for tunnel convergence prediction are described. From this investigation it is found that some of these theories are inapplicable to soft rocks at depth. Those which are applicable, due to their limitations, are not suited for prediction of the vertical convergence profile from tunnel faceline in longwall coal mining. Hence, a new theoretical exponential formula for tunnel convergence prediction based on a modified Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion is developed and checked against in situ convergence measurements. The current <b>barrier</b> <b>pillar</b> design criteria are also investigated. It is found that these criteria yield too conservative a design and are not suited for depths greater than 600 m below ground surface. Hence, two theoretical methods of designing <b>barrier</b> <b>pillar</b> width for longwall coal mining are developed and compared with field data and current <b>barrier</b> <b>pillar</b> design criteria...|$|E

40|$|The {{majority}} of bord and pillar coal mines world over utilizes uniform pillars across a panel {{for ease of}} layout and simplified standard mining sequence. This is however, regardless {{of the fact that}} the distribution of vertical stress across all the pillars from <b>barrier</b> <b>pillar</b> towards the centre of the panel is not uniform. The distribution of vertical stress, safety factor and seam convergence across panels at various depths have been investigated through the Lamodel software package. Further verification of the distribution of stress has been done through underground investigations on the effects of stress on pillar scaling in a main development panel of a bord and pillar coal mine. Both numerical and underground investigations have confirmed that in-panel pillars close to barrier pillars have higher safety factors than those in the middle of a panel. Based on this, further numerical modelling using the Lamodel package has been conducted focusing on the size and location effects of barrier and in-panel pillars in bord and pillar panels at different depths. It has been found that it may be possible to improve coal resource utilization without significantly affecting stability by slightly reducing the size of those pillars close to barrier pillars, changing sizes of pillars in the middle of the panel and considering <b>barrier</b> <b>pillar</b> partial extraction. Based upon the indicators identified in the models investigated, a panel‟s overall extraction in bord and pillar primary development may be increased by between 0. 01 % and 0. 88 % depending on depth and layout configurations...|$|E

One such alternative to the room and pillar method is the punch-longwall mining method. Enefit Kaevandused AS, {{one of the major}} oil shale companies in Estonia, plans to employ this technology in exploiting some of its resources in the near future. This thesis examines the different stability problems related to the planned punch-longwall mining project in Narva oil shale mine. Determining optimal chain pillar dimensions and stability of the punch-longwall highwall slope are the main objectives of this project. Rock mechanical analyses have been done and recommendations are made based on the rock mechanical aspect of the mining process. Taavi Lõhmuste is responsible for the chain pillar stability analysis and Ott Oisalu for the punch-longwall highwall slope stability analysis. It is essential to understand the geology of a certain area in order to make accurate stability assessments. Because of the previously stated requirements, the geology of Estonian oil shale deposit is examined {{in the first part of}} the thesis in order to determine the geological and rock mechanical conditions to set the foundation for further analyses. In conclusion, for the part of the highwall slope, a properly designed <b>barrier</b> <b>pillar</b> plays a key role in the stability of the slope. After reviewing and analyzing the results of both highwall slope numerical models, it can be stated that the minimum length for the <b>barrier</b> <b>pillar</b> that still will yield in stable highwall slope is 65 meters.

40|$|In {{order to}} reduce waste and improve {{resource}} conservation, mine planning, and development, the U. S. Bureau of Mines is investigating the effects of multiple seam interactions associated with longwall coal mining. Field investigations were conducted at a mine located in Boone County, WV, where a longwall panel was operating subjacent to room-and-pillar workings in an overlying seam. To assess the effects of overlying workings on longwall headgate stability, the Bureau gathered various geotechnical information at this minesite. Headgate pillars and entries were instrumented and monitored to study their behavior during side-abutment loading as the longwall panel approached and passed beneath the overlying room-and-pillar developments. The two operations are separated by 800 ft of interburden, and although interactions between operations separated by this distance are uncommon, geomechanical measurements indicate the occurrence of an interaction. These measurements show that convergence on the headgate entries was most adverse subjacent to <b>barrier</b> <b>pillars</b> in the overlying mine. Pillar measurements indicate that side-abutment pressure increases were slightly greater than predicted values. Several factors related to both geology and mine design, believed responsible for this large interactive distance, are discussed...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Chain and <b>barrier</b> <b>pillar</b> {{design for}} {{longwall}} mining and production pillar design for room-and pillar retreat mining {{have tended to}} rely on simplistic abutment angle concepts for the estimation of pillar stress increases during and subsequent to extraction. Historically, the underpinning database of monitored abutment loading has been small and displayed considerable variation, leading to {{the application of a}} number of mine site-specific approximations and often necessarily conservative assumptions. Also, over the last decade, the trend towards wider longwall faces and narrower room-and-pillar sections in deeper areas has challenged established design practices. However, in recent years, considerable effort has been made both in the US and Australia with regard to expanding the abutment loading database and developing an improved understanding of the pillar loading environment. This paper examines some of the progress made and the implications thereof, with a focus on the derivation of formula for abutment angle prediction...|$|E

A series of demonstration calculations using structural finite element analyses are presented here to examine the effect of internal gas generation on the response of a sealed repository. From the calculated stress fields, the most probable location for a fracture to develop was determined to be within the pillars interior to the repository for the range of parameter values considered. If a fracture interconnects the rooms and panels of the repository, fracture opening produces significant additional void volume to limit the excess gas pressure to less than 1. 0 MPa above the overburden pressure.

Roof to floor closure measurements, combined with the timing of the pillar behavior, provides a detailed look at the uncontrollable convergence of underground mine openings.

30|$|The {{issue of}} {{wellbore}} stability {{is a significant}} problem for wells located in active mining areas. In particular, wells in mining areas where the longwall mining technique {{is used for the}} extraction of coal could be subject of wellbore casing failures caused by substantial ground movement due to removal of the large panels. With the development of unconventional reservoirs such as the Marcellus shale in active mining areas of western PA and in general coal reserves in Appalachia that overlays the Marcellus shale, the possibility of wellbore failure due to mining activities needs to be examined. Given the geometric setting of the longwall panels and the remaining pillars, factors that are related to longwall mining such as induced stresses and resulting strains and displacements in the ground around the mined out area (gob), pillars of certain size, as well as surface subsidence should be taken into consideration. The stresses, strains and deformations are a function of characteristics of the mining area and panel geometry, geological properties of the formations above and below the workable coal seam, and the wellbore design and completion method used for the drilling of the gas wells tapping into Marcellus shale. This study will focus on the geological settings, geometry of the longwall panel and pillars, and resulting stresses strain and deformation caused by mining activities. The main focus of the study is the stability of the wellbores that are designed to go through large size <b>barrier</b> <b>pillars.</b> A separate study can look into the possibility of the drilling and wellbore completion in the gob, which is the caved area above the mined panel.|$|R
40|$|The {{dissertation}} thesis {{focused on}} Environmental Management Accounting (EMA), {{which is a}} very important source of information, particularly for organization management decision-making, for environmental management systems (EMS) or for environmental reporting. In practice there are many obstacles for full-value implementation process of EMA into practice of organization and its full functionality. For this reason, were identified barriers that are causing these obstacles. The result of the dissertation thesis is Model of implementation and use of EMA, which allows the identification of barriers to implementation and operation of the EMA, is helping to eliminate the barriers, streamlines the implementation of EMA into the practices of the organization and ultimately creates functional EMA. Functional EMA generates, monitors and evaluates environmental indicators needed in many areas of business. Implementation model and use of EMA contains following elements - <b>barriers,</b> <b>pillars,</b> functional EMA and benefits of EMA. These four elements of the model are connected by three processes - the process of interaction, the process of removing barriers, the process of generating, tracking and evaluating the quality environmental information. To fulfill the objectives of the dissertation thesis was carried out a study containing questionnaire survey taking place in three stages - in the chemical industry organization declaring support for the initiative Responsibility Care; in selected organizations with environmental management system certified in accordance with ISO 14001; and organizations that had environmental management system validated according to EMAS. From this study, primary data were obtained and were subject to non-hierarchical cluster analysis using K-averages. Validation of cluster analysis was performed using Meansim method (MSA).

The event and aftershocks shook {{the nearby town}} of Stilfontein, causing serious damage to several buildings and minor injuries to 58 people. At a nearby deep gold mine, two mineworkers lost their lives and 3200 mineworkers were evacuated under difficult circumstances. The Chief Inspector of Mines initiated an investigation into the risks to miners, mines and the public arising from seismicity in gold mining districts. It was found that the seismic event on 9 March 2005 could be ascribed to past mining, and that seismic events will continue to occur in the gold mining districts as long as deep-level mining takes place and are likely to persist for some time even after mine closure. Placement of slimes in old mining workings is unlikely to reduce risks significantly. Seismic monitoring should continue after mine closure, and the seismic hazard should be taken into account when the future use of mining land is considered. Seismic events are likely to be triggered as mines are allowed to flood. It is possible that a seismic event could cause movement on a fault transecting a water plug and/or water <b>barrier</b> <b>pillar,</b> open up a fluid pathway, and allow flow of water into populated mine workings.

40|$|Deep cover retreat mining (overburden {{in excess}} of 750 ft) is an {{important}} emerging issue which will intensify {{in the future as}} the more easily mined shallow seam reserves are depleted. Analysis of Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) statistics indicates that deep cover pillar recovery accounts for a disproportionate share of the underground coal mine roof/rib fall fatalities and injuries. Past research has shown that previously recommended Analysis of Retreat Mining Pillar Stability (ARMPS) stability factors (SF 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s) may be excessive for deep cover pillar design. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the various methods and strategies by which panels, production pillars and barrier pillars are developed and extracted under deep cover, and to develop appropriate design guidelines. In the course of the research, 29 mines in 7 states were investigated to collect panel design case histories. At each mine site, underground geotechnical data were collected on the pillar line in order to document roof rock, coalbed and floor conditions. The analyses indicated that squeezes were the most likely failure mode where the depth was less than 1, 250 ft, but bumps predominated in the deeper cover cases. Immediate roof rock quality, the ARMPS SF 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s, and <b>barrier</b> <b>pillar</b> stability factors were all found to be important parameters in determining the outcomes of the case histories.

40|$|Punch {{longwall}} mining {{takes advantage of}} the final highwall exposure in an open cut coal mine, driving gateroads straight into the targeted coal seam then retreating the longwall back to just short of the highwall. A designed <b>barrier</b> <b>pillar</b> remains between the final longwall position and the highwall, which is subject to redistributed ground stresses. Material is strained to magnitudes unlike those typically measured in open-cut mining, and unlike typical longwall ground behaviour, the highwall was observed to strain in an opposite direction to the longwall caved and subsidence zone. Mine personnel and equipment may become exposed to the unstable highwall rockfall hazards, highlighting the importance of understanding the mechanism and implementing appropriate controls. This paper describes the assessments undertaken through radar, survey prism and Light Detecting and Ranging (LiDAR) monitoring, as well as geotechnical inspection and analysis. Initial results show highwall movement is directly correlated with longwall goafing and any delayed ground movements are more related to the rate of retreat, the type of goafing behaviour and the influence of strata deteriorating in other locations along the face of the highwall. This paper also describes climatic conditions as the primary limitation with radar monitoring. In addition, diurnal steel mesh movement was measured with changing atmospheric temperature. Steel mesh is usually installed as ground support above portal entries to the underground workings. By filtering out any measured mesh movement, true trends of strata deformation in these areas can be identified. Recommendations are made for efficient and reliable radar data acquisition. Further recommendations are made to restrict people and plant access to a safe standoff from the highwall as the longwall approaches the final retreat position within the panel. Effective monitoring of highwall performance throughout the longwall retreat to establish stable trends will enable continued, safe access to these locations...|$|E

On January 28, 1974, after 505 days of degasification, a compressor was installed to the exhaust stack of the multipurpose borehole (2), and pipeline [...] quality gas was introduced into a commercial pipeline. As of February 4, 1975, over 171 million cubic feet of gas had been purchased by the gas company. The in situ pressure at a depth of 200 feet into the coalbed and the average gas flow and water flow from the degasification holes as they were completed and closed off were 203 psig, 1, 200, 000 cfd, and 6. 8 gpm, respectively. Twenty-four hours after the seven holes were connected through individual pipes to the atmosphere, the total gas and water flows and the in situ pressure dropped, respectively, to 971, 000 cfd, 1. 3 gpm, and 18 psig. Five hundred days later, the corresponding values were 620, 000 cfd, 0. 15 gpm, and 10. 5 psig. Daily flows have been as high as 800, 000 cfd, and as low as 360, 000 cfd, during the last 500 days. On February 4, 1975, after 882 days of degasification, 576 million cubic feet of gas had been removed from the Pittsburgh coalbed; apparently a much larger area of virgin coal is being degasified than is defined by the holes. This study indicates that horizontal boreholes drilled into a coalbed from the bottom of any shaft will effectively remove gas from the Pittsburgh coalbed...|$|E
40|$|Highwall mining is an {{important}} coal mining method. It appears that upwards of 60 highwall miners are presently in operation, and they may account for approximately 4 % of total U. S. coal production. A review of the Mines Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) data over the 20 year period from 1983 to 2002 identified 9 fatalities attributable to auger and highwall mining of which inadequate ground control accounted for 1 / 3. In the past 5 years, 1 fatality occurred in highwall mining. Estimates of the manpower requirements in highwall mining suggest that its fatality rate {{is essentially the same}} as for surface coal mining, thus highwall mining appears to be a very safe modern mining method. Highwall stability is the major ground control related safety concern, and operators are required to develop and follow an appropriate highwall mining ground control plan. The plans usually specify the following geotechnical parameters: hole width, maximum hole depth, maximum overburden depth, seam thickness, web pillar width, <b>barrier</b> <b>pillar</b> width and number of holes between barriers. Calculated web pillar stability factor exceeded 1. 3 for most designs evaluated. This study examined records from 5, 289 highwall miner holes with a total completed footage of about 2, 560, 000 feet to understand the reasons for early pull out. Average lost footage is typically about 20 % of planned footage. Only 35 % of the holes reached planned depth, and 20 % were short due to rockfalls. Water and adverse geology accounted for 15 % of the losses. Mechanical/electrical problems, guidance, and slope stability problems accounted for the remaining 30 %. Web pillar stability factor for these holes also exceeded 1. 3 in 95 % of cases. Best practices to avoid trapped miners include: avoid mining in stream valleys, avoid mining near outside corners, careful alignment of each hole and the use of an onboard guidance system. Several issues in highwall mining ground control require further investigation including highwall mining through old auger workings, highwall mining near old underground mines, multiple-seam and multiple lift highwall mining and finally the size and frequency of barrier pillars...|$|E
