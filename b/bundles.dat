5|$|A 2017 {{study by}} Thomas D. Carr, David J. Varricchio et al found that tyrannosaurs had large, flat scales on their snouts. At {{the center of}} these scales were small, keratinised patches. In crocodilians, such patches cover dense <b>bundles</b> of nerve fibers that pick-up {{vibrations}} and pressure changes. They proposed that tyrannosaurs probably also possessed such <b>bundles</b> of sensitive nerve fibers and may have used them to identify objects, measure the temperature of their nests and to pick-up eggs and hatchlings.|$|E

50|$|In mathematics, the {{vertical}} <b>bundle</b> and the horizontal <b>bundle</b> are two subbundles of the tangent <b>bundle</b> of a smooth fiber <b>bundle,</b> forming complementary subspaces at each {{point of the}} fibre <b>bundle.</b> The vertical <b>bundle</b> consists of all vectors that are tangent to the fibers, while the horizontal <b>bundle</b> is then a particular choice of a subbundle of tangent <b>bundle</b> which is complementary to vertical <b>bundle.</b>|$|R
50|$|The tangent frame <b>bundle</b> (or {{simply the}} frame <b>bundle)</b> of a smooth {{manifold}} M is the frame <b>bundle</b> associated to the tangent <b>bundle</b> of M.

5|$|Band Hero also {{introduced}} an updated {{revision of the}} drum kit that shipped with Guitar Hero World Tour. Many changes were made to address weight and size concerns that made assembly difficult, and the stand's crossbar {{was moved to the}} bottom to improve leg room and allow the bass pedal to be supported by it. The cymbals were changed to a circular shape from the previous triangular design, and the sensitivity of the drums themselves were adjusted. An in-game sensitivity adjustment feature is also supported. In the United States, the new controller was, for a limited time, exclusive to the game and instrument <b>bundles</b> of Band Hero on Wii. The Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions of the controller were released at a later date; Band Hero <b>bundles</b> for these platforms in the U.S. included the World Tour drum controller.|$|E

5|$|HypSys are {{localised}} in {{the cell}} wall. The precursor for tobacco HypSys is transcribed as a 165 amino acid polypeptide which has no structural homology to the precursor for systemin in tomato. The structural properties of HypSys, containing hydroxyproline and being glycosylated, indicate that they are synthesised through the secretory system. The precursor to HypSys in tomato is a 146 amino acid polypeptide, exclusively synthesised within the vascular <b>bundles</b> of leaves and petioles associated with parenchyma cells of phloem <b>bundles.</b> Unlike systemin, it is primarily associated with the cell wall. The precursors to HypSys appear to represent a distinct subfamily of hydroxyproline-rich proteins found in cell walls.

There are two significant variations of the delta pylon; one has longer side crossbars such that all three <b>bundles</b> of conductors are suspended on V-shaped insulators.

5|$|The main {{muscular system}} in {{bivalves}} is the posterior and anterior adductor muscles, although the anterior muscles {{may be reduced}} or even lost in some species. These strong muscles connect the two valves and contract to close the shell. They work {{in opposition to the}} ligament which tends to pull the valves apart. In sedentary or recumbent bivalves that lie on one valve, such as the oysters and scallops, the anterior adductor muscle has been lost and the posterior muscle is positioned centrally. In file shells that can swim by flapping their valves, a single, central adductor muscle occurs. These muscles are composed of two types of muscle fibres, striated muscle <b>bundles</b> for fast actions and smooth muscle <b>bundles</b> for maintaining a steady pull.|$|E
5|$|The spores are smooth, roughly {{ellipsoid}} in shape, inequilateral {{when viewed}} in profile, and measure 7.6–10 by 3–3.4μm. They appear hyaline (translucent) to yellowish in a dilute solution of KOH, and cinnamon to pale ochraceous when stained with Melzer's reagent. The basidia are somewhat collapsed, hyaline, and 5–6μm thick. The cystidia are scattered, sometimes arranged in clusters (especially on the gill edge), usually with an ochraceous-brown content, but occasionally hyaline. They are club-shaped to somewhat cylindric and measure 34–60 by 10–13μm. The cuticle of the cap is an ixotrichodermium—a cellular arrangement where the outermost hyphae are gelatinous and emerge roughly parallel, like hairs, {{perpendicular to the}} cap surface. These hyphae are hyaline and narrowly cylindric, measuring 1.4–3μm in diameter. The stem surface is made of scattered <b>bundles</b> of caulocystidia (cystidia on the stem) that are brown or sometimes hyaline in KOH, club-shaped to subcylindrical <b>bundles</b> interspersed among hyaline cells.
