5|$|At first, USB was {{considered}} a complement to IEEE 1394 (FireWire) technology, which {{was designed as a}} high-bandwidth serial <b>bus</b> <b>that</b> efficiently interconnects peripherals such as disk drives, audio interfaces, and video equipment. In the initial design, USB operated at a far lower data rate and used less sophisticated hardware. It was suitable for small peripherals such as keyboards and pointing devices.|$|E
5|$|It is a one-wire {{bidirectional}} serial <b>bus</b> <b>that</b> {{is based}} on the CENELEC standard AV.link protocol to perform remote control functions.

5|$|Swift {{stations}} {{were given a}} number of small improvements after the line opened.

Real-time arrival signs debuted at Swift stations in 2013, featuring a countdown to the arrival of the next <b>bus</b> <b>that</b> is estimated using GPS units on coaches.

5|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Swinton O. Scott III.

However, Squidward then questions who was flickering the lights earlier. It is then revealed that the flickering lights are caused by doctored footage of Count Orlok from the 1922 silent film Nosferatu, with whom the characters are inexplicably familiar, flicking the light switch on and off.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the engine's failure, several related systems failed. The number one hydraulic system, powered by the number one engine, failed but continued to operate via motor pumps that mechanically connected it to hydraulic system three. Hydraulic system three was also damaged and began leaking fluid but maintained pressure and operation up until impact. Hydraulic system two was undamaged. The number one electrical bus, whose generator {{was attached to the}} number one engine, failed, causing several electrical systems to go offline, most notably the captain's instruments, his stick shaker, and the slat disagreement sensors. While a switch in the overhead panel would have allowed the captain to restore power to his instruments, it was not used. It might have been possible for the flight engineer to reach the backup power switch (as part of an abnormal situation checklist – not as part of their take-off emergency procedure) in an effort to restore electrical power to the number one electrical <b>bus.</b> <b>That</b> would have worked only if electrical faults were no longer present in the number one electrical system. Furthermore, to reach the switch the flight engineer would have had to rotate his seat, release his safety belt, and stand up. Since the aircraft never got higher than 350 feet (110 m) above ground and was in the air for only 50 seconds between when the engine separated and when it crashed, there was not sufficient time to take such an action. In any event, the first officer was flying the airplane and his instruments continued to function normally. As the wings and engines were not visible from the cockpit, the crew likely had no idea that an engine had fallen off, only that one had failed.|$|E
