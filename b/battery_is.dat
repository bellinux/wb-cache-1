5|$|Fort Eliza, {{also known}} as The Salt <b>Battery,</b> <b>is</b> a {{freestanding}} five-sided four-gun battery, constructed around 1812, and standing {{on the east side}} of the River Shannon. Three sides face the river and were formed of broad parapets. The other two sides meet at the rear salient angle at a guardhouse, which is now ruined. The <b>battery</b> <b>is</b> surrounded by a dry moat, with the entrance originally across a drawbridge close to the guardhouse. At the centre of the enclosure was the brick-vaulted powder magazine. This fort, combined with Cromwell's Castle, the Martello tower and Fort Falkland would have protected both the town and the river crossing from all angles.|$|E
5|$|The SIII's Li-ion 2,100mAh <b>battery</b> <b>is</b> {{said to have}} a 790-hour {{standby time}} or 11hours of talk time on 3G, {{compared}} to 900hours in standby and 21hours of talk time on 2G. Built into the <b>battery</b> <b>is</b> near field communication (NFC) connectivity, which allows users to share map directions and YouTube videos quickly using Wi-Fi Direct (through Android Beam), and perform non-touch payments at shops that employ specially equipped NFC cash registers. The battery can be wirelessly charged using a special charging pad (sold separately) that utilizes magnetic resonance to produce a magnetic field through which electricity could be transferred.|$|E
5|$|The {{principle}} {{behind the}} <b>battery</b> <b>is</b> the injury potential created in a muscle {{when it is}} damaged, although this was not fully understood in the 18th and 19th centuries; the potential being caused incidentally due to the dissection of the frog's muscles.|$|E
50|$|As power source, 12V marine deep cycle, sealed {{lead acid}} <b>batteries</b> <b>are</b> {{commonly}} used. For voltages higher than 12V, <b>batteries</b> <b>are</b> connected in series. Common car starter <b>batteries</b> <b>are</b> not recommended power sources for electric trolling motors, since such <b>batteries</b> <b>are</b> optimized for strong currents {{and not for}} being deeply discharged on a regular basis.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>battery</b> <b>was</b> {{stationed}} at Secunderabad from June 1862. [...] A {{reorganization of the}} horse artillery on 13 April 1864 saw 3rd Brigade became D Brigade. As <b>battery</b> designations <b>were</b> tied to the brigade the <b>battery</b> <b>was</b> assigned to, the <b>battery</b> <b>was</b> now designated B Battery, D Brigade.|$|R

The <b>battery</b> <b>is</b> an 840mAh internal rechargeable, compared to 1000mAh for the DS Lite, and has an optimal lifespan of approximately 500 cycles; after this point, it may {{be replaced by the}} user.|$|E
5|$|The two gates {{into the}} city, Mdina Gate and Greeks Gate, are {{located within the}} curtain walls of the land front. Remains of the medieval double walls {{as well as the}} 18th-century Torre dello Standardo are located just within the city walls. The land front is {{surrounded}} by a deep ditch, and a traverse-like <b>battery</b> <b>is</b> located in its eastern extremity.|$|E
5|$|A plug-in hybrid {{electric}} vehicle (PHEV or PHV), also known as a plug-in hybrid, is a hybrid {{electric vehicle}} with rechargeable batteries that can be restored to full charge by connecting a plug to an external electric power source. A plug-in hybrid shares the characteristics of both a conventional {{hybrid electric vehicle}} and an all-electric vehicle: it uses a gasoline engine and an electric motor for propulsion, but a PHEV has a larger battery pack that can be recharged, allowing operation in all-electric mode until the <b>battery</b> <b>is</b> depleted.|$|E
5000|$|The 1st Brigade with 10 <b>{{batteries}}</b> <b>was</b> {{much larger}} than the other four (with four to seven batteries each). Therefore, a reorganization of the Horse Artillery on 13 April 1864 saw 1st Brigade split as A and B Brigades. The <b>battery</b> <b>was</b> moved to A Brigade, and as <b>battery</b> designations <b>were</b> tied to the brigade the <b>battery</b> <b>was</b> assigned to, it was redesignated as D Battery, A Brigade (or D/A Battery in short).

50|$|Digital {{cameras that}} utilize {{off-the-shelf}} <b>batteries</b> <b>are</b> typically {{designed to be}} able to use both single-use disposable and rechargeable batteries, but not with both types in use at the same time. The most common off-the-shelf <b>battery</b> size used <b>is</b> AA. CR2, CR-V3 batteries, and AAA <b>batteries</b> <b>are</b> also used in some cameras. The CR2 and CR-V3 <b>batteries</b> <b>are</b> lithium based, intended for a single use. Rechargeable RCR-V3 lithium-ion <b>batteries</b> <b>are</b> also available as an alternative to non-rechargeable CR-V3 batteries.|$|R
5|$|Apple {{claims that}} the battery can provide up to 10hours of video, 140hours of audio playback, or one month on standby; people say the battery lasts about 8hours doing normal tasks. Like any {{rechargeable}} battery, the iPad's battery loses capacity over time. However, the iPad's <b>battery</b> <b>is</b> not user-replaceable. In a program similar to iPod and iPhone battery-replacement programs, Apple promised to replace an iPad that does not hold an electrical charge with a refurbished unit for a fee of US$99 plus $6.95 shipping. User data is not preserved/transferred. The refurbished unit comes with a new case. The warranty on the refurbished unit may vary between jurisdictions.|$|E
5|$|GE has {{installed}} a prototype wind turbine with onboard battery {{similar to that}} of an electric car, equivalent of 1 minute of production. Despite the small capacity, it is enough to guarantee that power output complies with forecast for 15 minutes, as the <b>battery</b> <b>is</b> used to eliminate the difference rather than provide full output. In certain cases the increased predictability can be used to take wind power penetration from 20 to 30 or 40 per cent. The battery cost can be retrieved by selling burst power on demand and reducing backup needs from gas plants.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, {{a number}} of programs, such as the IAI Harpy or the AGM-136 Tacit Rainbow, {{integrated}} anti-radiation sensors into a drone or missile air frames coupled with command and control and loitering capabilities. This allowed the attacking force to place relatively cheap munitions in place over suspected SAM sites, and to attack promptly the moment the SAM <b>battery</b> <b>is</b> visible. This integrated {{the use of a}} drone as a baiting decoy with the attack role into one small and relatively cheap platform in comparison to the alternative wild weasel jet fighter.|$|E

5|$|Oliver's <b>Battery</b> <b>is</b> {{a ruined}} {{artillery}} battery {{on the island}} of Tresco in the Isles of Scilly. It was built by the Parliamentarian admiral, Sir Robert Blake, after he invaded Tresco in April 1651 during the years of the interregnum. It was used to bombard the neighbouring island of St Mary's, which was still held by an opposing Royalist army, and forced its surrender several weeks later. The battery comprised a triangle of ramparts, constructed using earth and rubble, which, combined with the natural stone features on the site, produced a substantial, if crude, fortification. It is now ruined, and owned by the Duchy of Cornwall.|$|E
5|$|Pegasus Bridge, {{a target}} of the British 6th Airborne, {{was the site of}} some of the {{earliest}} action of the Normandy landings. The bridge was replaced in 1994 by one similar in appearance, and the original is now housed on the grounds of a nearby museum complex. Sections of Mulberry Harbour B still sit in the sea at Arromanches, and the well-preserved Longues-sur-Mer <b>battery</b> <b>is</b> nearby. The Juno Beach Centre, opened in 2003, was funded by the Canadian federal and provincial governments, France, and Canadian veterans.|$|E
5|$|The Volt's <b>battery</b> <b>is</b> {{guaranteed}} by General Motors {{for eight years}} or , and will cover all 161 battery components. GM estimates that the Volt batteries will degrade by 10 to 30% after 8 years or 100,000 miles. GM has applied for a patent that may allow technicians to quickly and cheaply recover some {{of the performance of}} degraded battery packs. The Volt’s battery management system runs more than 500 diagnostics at 10 times per second, allowing it {{to keep track of the}} Volt’s battery pack in real-time, 85% of which ensure the battery pack is operating safely and 15% monitor battery performance and life.|$|E

5|$|The iPad 2 has a 25W·h {{rechargeable}} {{lithium-ion polymer battery}} {{that lasts}} 10 hours, like the original iPad. It is charged via USB or included 10 W, 2 A power adapter. The <b>battery</b> <b>is</b> 2.5mm thick, 59% smaller than the original and has three cells instead of two. The improvements allowed the injection-molded plastic support frame to be omitted. The 10 W USB power adapter provides 4x {{the power of a}} conventional USB port. The tablet has an audio frequency response of 20 Hz to 20kHz. Without third-party software it can play the following audio formats: HE-AAC, AAC, Protected AAC, MP3, MP3 VBR, Audible formats (2, 3, 4, AEA, AAX, and AAX+), ALAC, AIFF, and WAV.|$|E
5|$|The mercury <b>battery</b> <b>is</b> a non-rechargeable {{electrochemical}} battery, {{a primary}} cell, that was {{common in the}} middle of the 20th century. It was used in a wide variety of applications and was available in various sizes, particularly button sizes. Its constant voltage output and long shelf life gave it a niche use for camera light meters and hearing aids. The mercury cell was effectively banned in most countries in the 1990s due to concerns about the mercury contaminating landfills.|$|E
5|$|Bill (W. Earl Brown) is a {{survivor}} who lives just outside Boston, {{and is a}} business partner of Joel and Tess. A paranoid, aggressive and distrustful {{man in his late}} forties, Bill lives alone in a heavily fortified town, laden with booby traps that include some captured Infected. During the game, Joel finds Bill in the hope that he will pay off a debt by fixing up a car for them to drive to Tommy's, but Bill insists that the only working car <b>battery</b> <b>is</b> in the unexplored part of town. After fighting their way to the local high school, Bill discovers the battery he was going to use is missing. They escape the swarms of infected surrounding the school, and find themselves in an abandoned house, where Bill discovers his partner, Frank, has committed suicide by hanging there, and it is revealed that the two had had a falling out and Frank had been planning to escape in Bill's car. After getting the car started, Joel drops Bill off, and expresses sympathy for what happened between him and Frank. Bill merely responds by ensuring that their debt is settled and then ordering Joel to leave the town.|$|E
50|$|The <b>battery</b> <b>was</b> {{built at}} the bottom of Jesuit Hill, close to the shoreline. Jesuit Hill <b>Battery</b> <b>was</b> located nearby on higher ground. The <b>battery</b> <b>was</b> small, and {{consisted}} of a small masonry parapet with three embrasures, a hardstone gun platform, a sentry room on the left, and a flanking rubble wall on the right. A magazine was also built {{to the rear of the}} <b>battery.</b> Marsa <b>Battery</b> <b>was</b> designed by Salvatore Camilleri from Valletta.|$|R
5000|$|East Weare <b>Battery</b> <b>was</b> a gun <b>battery</b> to {{the east}} of the Verne Citadel on the Isle of Portland in Dorset, England.

5|$|In the 6th century BC, the Greek philosopher Thales of Miletus {{experimented with}} amber rods and these {{experiments}} {{were the first}} studies into the production of electrical energy. While this method, {{now known as the}} triboelectric effect, can lift light objects and generate sparks, it is extremely inefficient. It was not until the invention of the voltaic pile in the eighteenth century that a viable source of electricity became available. The voltaic pile, and its modern descendant, the electrical battery, store energy chemically and make it available on demand in the form of electrical energy. The <b>battery</b> <b>is</b> a versatile and very common power source which is ideally suited to many applications, but its energy storage is finite, and once discharged it must be disposed of or recharged. For large electrical demands electrical energy must be generated and transmitted continuously over conductive transmission lines.|$|E
5|$|While {{operating}} in all-electric mode the Volt produces no tailpipe emissions. In this mode {{there is an}} absence of harmful chemical emissions that can negatively impact air quality, allowing for a continuous clean air benefit. There is also a lack of carbon dioxide emissions. However, this benefit is mostly local because, depending on {{the source of the}} electricity used to recharge the batteries, these emissions are shifted to the location of the electricity generation plants. The amount of carbon dioxide emitted depends on the emission intensity of the power source used to charge the vehicle. When the Volt's <b>battery</b> <b>is</b> depleted and the gasoline-powered engine engages, the plug-in emissions are similar to other internal combustion engine vehicles. The amount of total local emissions depends on how much the Volt is driven in all-electric mode and how much in charge-sustaining mode.|$|E
5|$|The {{aftermath}} of the blast makes Rei realize that he was human all along, and that {{everyone else in the}} town were Phiroids. After collecting some supplies, the three of them leave the town and make it to the facility where Rei originally woke up, which still has some electricity. Tipi gives Rei access to an electronic library on a tablet shortly before her <b>battery</b> <b>is</b> no longer able to function. Rei and Shiona stay in the facility for a time until Shiona eventually succumbs to the gunshot wound which had damaged her internal components. Rei puts Shiona and Tipi in cryogenic pods before leaving with the music box in an attempt to find a world where humans and Phiroids can coexist. Sometime later, Shiona wakes up in a facility with her memories wiped, but she is told that there was a music box with her when she was found. The environment has recovered and human civilization is once again prosperous and highly technological. Shiona is taken back to the town where humans and Phiroids once again coexist. She is reunited with Tipi, who also had her memories wiped. Prompted by the tune playing from the music box, Shiona sings the song which is now known worldwide.|$|E
