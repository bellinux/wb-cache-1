It can be installed to a USB or hard drive alongside a current operating system or as a complete replacement.|$|R
2500|$|Another {{option is}} to use a computer-music system. [...] Such systems {{typically}} allow a user to enter music into a computerized music notation program. [...] The software then automatically converts the print notation into braille. One such software program is called Goodfeel. The visually impaired individual can enter music notation within the Lime program, which has been scripted so the process of music entry is accessible. Then this file can be imported into Goodfeel which converts the music into a Braille file that can be exported to a Braille embosser or read on a portable <b>Braille</b> <b>display.</b>|$|E

Other variants exist that use a conventional QWERTY keyboard for input and braille pins for output, as well as input-only and output-only devices.|$|E
50|$|CLIs {{are often}} used by programmers and system administrators, in {{engineering}} and scientific environments, and by technically advanced personal computer users.
