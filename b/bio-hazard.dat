Immunogenic properties of gp 160 which trigger both a humoral and cellular immune response have since justified its use in various vaccine programs, both past and present. Many reports however have underlined deleterious effects on the immune system - anti-HIV- 1 enhanced antibodies, anti-CD 4 autoantibodies, and inhibition of T cell activation by HIV- 1 - particularly associated with the Env protein.

In this scope, we present a novel detection system which is able to simultaneously measure spectrally and temporally resolved laser induced fluorescence signals excited by two consecutive laser pulses with differ-ent central wavelengths at 266 nm and 355 nm. The setup enables fast data acqui-sition that provides a complete dataset {{in less than a}} few milliseconds at repetition rates of 100 Hz. Furthermore, with its modular design it can be transported easily for operation at different locations. First measurements indicate a high perfor-mance and a good distinguishability of bacterial specimen within a limited set of three representative bacterial species.

The sero-positive percent of the naturally infected sheep was 50. 4 and 61. 4 by LAT and ELISA, respectively, 47. 9 % of samples were confirmedly positive in both LAT and ELISA results. The microscopical examination revealed that only 28 out of 134 (20. 9 %) of the confirmed sero-positive animals by both tests were found harboring T. gondii tissue cysts in their mutton samples, while high percentage of confirmed sero-positve animals (79. 1 %) (106 out of 134) were biologically tissue cysts free mutton.

The topic of the thesis was chosen with regard to an increasing probability of occurrence and spreading of a highly infectious disease in Czech Republic.

The theoretical part of {{the bachelor}} thesis focuses on the literature search and exploration of facts from legal rules and documents regulating the matter of highly infectious disease incidents and the characteristics of highly infectious diseases spreading through person-to-person contact. The practical part of the thesis assesses the availability of personal protective equipment for the emergency exit groups and for the specialized <b>bio-hazard</b> team dedicated to dealing with emergency situations in relation to highly infectious disease incidents. This part of thesis also evaluates the material resources and equipment, trainings of the specialized team, cooperation with the components of the Integrated Rescue System and with selected health care institutions. The practical part of the thesis also includes description of the Plzen Regional Emergency Rescue Service's internal documentation. The bachelor thesis contains in particular two improvement suggestions for two aspects related to the preparedness of the Plzen Regional Emergency Rescue Service to a highly infectious disease incident.

40|$|Exposure to Mycobacterium {{tuberculosis}} (Mtb) aerosols is a {{major threat}} to tuberculosis (TB) researchers, even in bio-safety level- 3 (BSL- 3) facilities. Automation and high-throughput screens (HTS) in BSL 3 facilities are essential for minimizing manual aerosol-generating interventions and facilitating TB research. In the present study, we report the development and validation of a high-throughput, 24 -well 'spot-assay' for selecting bactericidal compounds against Mtb. The bactericidal screen concept was first validated in the fast-growing surrogate Mycobacterium smegmatis (Msm) and subsequently confirmed in Mtb using the following reference anti-tubercular drugs: rifampicin, isoniazid, ofloxacin and ethambutol (RIOE, acting on different targets). The potential use of the spot-assay to select bactericidal compounds from a large library was confirmed by screening on Mtb, with parallel plating by the conventional gold standard method (correlation, r 2 = 0. 808). An automated spot-assay further enabled an MBC 90 determination on resistant and sensitive Mtb clinical isolates. The implementation of the spot-assay in kinetic screens to enumerate residual Mtb after either genetic silencing (anti-sense RNA, AS-RNA) or chemical inhibition corroborated its ability to detect cidality. This relatively simple, economical and quantitative HTS considerably minimized the <b>bio-hazard</b> risk and enabled the selection of novel vulnerable Mtb targets and mycobactericidal compounds. Thus, spot-assays have great potential to impact the TB drug discovery process...|$|E
40|$|Background and {{challenges}} to implementation : Genexpert MTB/Rif {{technology has been}} developed to increase TB case detection in low-income and high-burden countries. These countries generally face major problems regarding the transportation of samples from peripheral centers to central labs due to biosafety issues, long distances and high temperatures. These issues could diminish the overall impact of the Genexpert MTB/Rif technology in low income countries. Intervention or response : To facilitate the transport of samples from peripheral health centers to central GeneXpert-equipped labs (TB Reach funding), we validated a protocol of alcohol-based conservation of the samples and implemented it in the South-Kivu Province (DRC). Results and lessons learnt : Sputum conserved by a 1 / 1 dilution of 95 ° ethanol can be analyzed by Genexpert even after spending 48 h at 37 °C. The use of this protocol in the South-Kivu Province permitted a considerable increase in terms of efficiency of the Genexpert technology. Conclusions and key recommendations : A major problem faced by low-income countries is the transportation of samples due to long distances and high temperatures. Alcohol-based conservation of samples permits to overcome <b>bio-hazard,</b> time and bad conservation issues. In addition, the spread of this protocol permits a considerable increase {{of the impact of}} the implementation of a Genexpert MTB/Rif machine in the population...|$|E
40|$|Exploration Class {{missions}} to Mars will require precautions against potential contamination by any native microorganisms {{that may be}} incidentally pathogenic to humans. While the results of NASA's Viking biology experiments of 1976 have been generally interpreted as inconclusive for surface organisms, the possibility of native surface life has never been ruled out and more recent {{studies suggest that the}} case for biological interpretation of the Viking Labeled Release data may now be stronger than it was when the experiments were originally conducted. It is possible that, prior to the first human landing on Mars, robotic craft and sample return missions will provide enough data to know with certainty whether or not future human landing sites harbor extant life forms. However, if native life is confirmed, it will be problematic to determine whether any of its species may present a medical risk to astronauts. Therefore, it will become necessary to assess empirically the risk that the planet contains pathogens based on terrestrial examples of pathogenicity and to take a reasonably cautious approach to <b>bio-hazard</b> protection. A survey of terrestrial pathogens was conducted with special emphasis on those pathogens whose evolution has not depended on the presence of animal hosts. The history of {{the development and implementation of}} Apollo anticontamination protocol and recent recommendations of the NRC Space Studies Board regarding Mars were reviewed. Organisms can emerge in nature in the absence of indigenous animal hosts and both infectious and non-infectious human pathogens are theoretically possible on Mars. The prospect of Martian surface life, together with the existence of a diversity of routes by which pathogenicity has emerged on Earth, suggests that the possibility of human pathogens on Mars, while low, is not zero. Since the discovery and study of Martian life can have long-term benefits for humanity, the risk that Martian life might include pathogens should not be an obstacle to human exploration. As a precaution, however, it is recommended that EVA suits be decontaminated when astronauts enter surface habitats when returning from field activity and that biosafety protocol approximating laboratory BSL 2 be developed for astronauts working in laboratories on the Martian surface. Quarantine of astronauts and Martian materials arriving on Earth should also be part of a human Mars mission and this and the surface biosafety program should be integral to human expeditions from the earliest stages of the mission planning...|$|E
