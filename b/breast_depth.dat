40|$|Abstract In an {{experimental}} strain of white plumage geese created in 1989, two experiments {{were carried out}} from 1993 to 1995 in order to estimate genetic parameters for growth, and carcass composition traits in non-overfed animals, and genetic parameters for growth and fatty liver formation in overfed animals. Four hundred and thirty-one non-overfed animals were bred and slaughtered at 11 weeks of age; they were measured for forearm length, keel bone length, chest circumference and <b>breast</b> <b>depth</b> before and after slaughtering. The carcasses were partly dissected in order weigh breast, breast muscle and skin + fat, and abdominal fat. Four hundred and seventy-seven overfed animals were slaughtered at 20 weeks of age; they were measured for "paletot" (breast meat, bone and meat from wings, bone and meat from thigh and legs) weight and liver weight. In these two experiments, the weights had moderate to high heritability values. <b>Breast</b> <b>depth</b> measured on live animals showed a low heritability value. In overfed animals, liver weight showed a high heritability value. Liver weight could be increased by selection without a great effect on "paletot" weight. Thus, obtaining a white plumage geese strain for fatty liver production by selection would be difficult because only 20 % of overfed animals had fatty liver. The results did not allow to conclude {{on the influence of}} selection on liver weight on carcass traits such as muscle or fatty tissue weight. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In animal {{breeding}} and genetics, knowledge of causal effects may provide valuable information on selection. Different contributions of explanatory variables to the traits {{indicate that the}} breeder has to choose the variable with the largest contribution in a selection effort. In this study, direct and indirect effects of four explanatory variables (Shank Length, Breast Length, <b>Breast</b> <b>Depth</b> and Breast Circumference) influential on live weight at week 30 in American Bronze turkeys were investigated using path analysis. Results of the analyses indicated that the direct effects of shank length were the largest on live weight. In general, indirect effects of Breast Length and Breast Circumference through Shank Length were highest among all indirect effects. Shank Length is the most influential variable and must {{be included in the}} model in estimating the live weight at week 30...|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} method for depth {{discrimination}} in parallel-plate, transmission mode, diffuse optical imaging. The method is based on scanning a set of detector pairs, where the two detectors in each pair are separated by a distance dDi along direction dDi within the x-y scanning plane. A given optical inhomogeneity appears shifted by aidDi (with 0 # ai # 1) in the images collected with the two detection fibers of the i-th pair. Such a spatial shift can be translated into a measurement of the depth z of the inhomogeneity, and the depth measurements based on each detector pair are combined into a specially designed weighted average. This depth assessment is demonstrated on tissue-like phantoms for simple inhomogeneities such as straight rods in single-rod or multiple-rod configurations, and for more complex curved structures which mimic {{blood vessels in the}} female breast. In these phantom tests, the method has recovered the depth of single inhomogeneities in the central position of the phantom to within 4 mm of their actual value, and within 7 mm for more superficial inhomogeneities, where the thickness of the phantom was 65 mm. The application of this method to more complex images, such as optical mammograms, requires a robust approach to identify corresponding structures in the images collected with the two detectors of a given pair. To this aim, we propose an approach based on the inner product of the skeleton images collected with the two detectors of each pair, and we present an application of this approach to optical in vivo images of the female <b>breast.</b> This <b>depth</b> discrimination method can enhance the spatial information content of 2...|$|R

Bulls were five months old when the research commenced and they were eleven months old when the reserch was terminated. All body dimensions were measured by Litin stick except for breast circuit, metacarpus circuit and body weight. Bulls were tied and remained at the same place during their fattening period staying in ordinary cow-shed made of brick. All height measures increased at the relatively equal pace during the fattening period. Withers height increased most and back height increased the least. Tenderness of the back appeared to be most prominent at the end of fattening period. Concerning length dimensions, body length developed quickest, head length slowest.

40|$|Currently, {{mammography}} is {{the most}} common imaging technology used in breast screening. Low dose X-rays are passed through the breast to generate images called mammograms. One type of breast abnormality is a cluster of microcalcifications. Usually, in benign cases, microcalcifications result from the death of fat cells or are due to secretion by the lobules. However, in some cases, clusters of microcalcifications are indicative of early breast cancer, partly because of the secretions by cancer cells or the death of such cells. Due to the different attenuation characteristics of normal breast tissue and microcalcifications, the latter ideally appear as bright white spots and this allows detection and analysis for breast cancer classification. Microcalcification detection is one of the primary foci of screening and has {{led to the development of}} computer-aided detection (CAD) systems. However, a fundamental limitation of mammography is that it gives a 2 D view of the tightly compressed 3 D <b>breast.</b> The <b>depths</b> of entities within the breast are lost after this imaging process, even though the breast tissue is spread out as a result of the compression force applied to the breast. The superimposition of tissues can occlude cancers and this has led to the development of digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT). DBT is a three-dimensional imaging involving an X-ray tube moving in an arc around the breast, over a limited angular range, producing multiple images, which further undergo a reconstruction step to form a three-dimensional volume of breast. However, reconstruction remains the subject of research and small microcalcifications are "smeared" in depth by current algorithms, preventing detailed analysis of the geometry of a cluster. By using the geometry of the DBT acquisition system, we derive the "epipolar" trajectory of a microcalcification. 	As a first application of the epipolars, we develop a clustering algorithm after using the Hough transform to find corresponding points generated from a microcalcification. Noise points can also be isolated. In addition, we show how microcalcification projections can be detected adaptively. Epipolar analysis has also led to a novel detection algorithm for DBT using a Bayesian method, which estimates a maximum a posterior (MAP) labelling in each individual image and subsequently for all projections iteratively. Not only does this algorithm output the binary decision of whether a pixel is a microcalcification, it can predict the approximate depth of the microcalcification in the breast if it is. 	 Based on the epipolar analysis, reconstruction of just a region of interest (ROI) e. g. microcalcification clusters is possible and it is more straightforward than any existing method using reconstruction slices. This potentially enables future classification of breast cancer when more clinical data becomes available. This thesis is not currently available in ORA...|$|R
40|$|Breast {{cancer is}} one of the leading causes of death in women in the world. It is a complex disease with {{challenges}} to accurate diagnosis due to cancer subtypes that are difficult to distinguish. The most common subtype is Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC), a cancer in ductal cells that line the milk ducts in the <b>breast.</b> In <b>depth</b> understanding of the genetic basis of IDC can help treat it more effectively. Microarray based gene expression analysis is making new grounds in accurate diagnosis of diseases including cancer. Microarray experiments are designed to measure the expression levels of thousands of genes in various cells/tissues of interest and they are analysed to decipher a small set of genes that constitutes the gene signature of a particular disease. The few studies on breast cancer gene expression compare cancer subtypes but very few have compared gene expression between matched cancer and healthy tissues in the breast (Turashvili et al., 2007). The few studies that have compared different subtypes have little agreement on the gene signatures (Turashvili, 2007; Zhao et al., 2004, Sorlie, et al., 2001). Therefore, it is highly beneficial to further assess the validity of genes identified as differentially expressed, in order to boost confidence in the usefulness of the genes in various medical applications including diagnosis, prognosis and drug development. In this study, the validity of differentially expressed genes pertaining to a carefully conducted experiment on breast tissues affected by Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDL) and matched healthy tissues is conducted using neural networks and statistical methods. The data was obtained from NCBI database and deposited by Turashvili et al (2007) from their experiments on breast cancer. The original authors extracted a 326 gene signature for IDC using statistical methods. In our study, the ability of this gene set to discriminate the disease state from healthy state is investigated and validated using two sets of independent datasets. Our visual and qualitative exploration using Self organizing maps (SOM) followed by statistical tests indicated that the validation data supported 80 % of the original gene signature. Another SOM results declared that the original gene set is able to classify patients as being healthy or having IDC. Original gene set was optimally clustered into two classes based on correlation of expression patterns of genes by SOM /Ward clustering. The two classes and genes in them were supported by 60 % of the validation data. As an alternative, PCA was used to determine genes with correlated expressions in the original gene signature and 4 PCs accounted for 86 % of the variation in the data with the first 2 PCs accounting for around 70 %. Top most important 100 genes in PC 1 and PC 2 provided 52 % support for the two SOM classes with PC 1 dominating class 1 and PC 2, class 2. Genes that were validated by independent data in the two SOM classes were used in conjunction with PC 1 and PC 2 to extract highly influential genes from the top 6 %, 18 % and 57 % of the original genes represented by PC 1 and PC 2. These key genes may prove to be the most crucial in identifying ductal tumor from healthy tissues. Four new genes were among key genes that may shed more light onto the disease mechanism. The key genes as well as overall set of validated genes may provide further support to understand or refine genetic networks that these genes are part of in the next stage of our study...|$|R
