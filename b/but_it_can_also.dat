5|$|In Europe, Amanita ceciliae is {{widespread}} everywhere, though infrequently encountered. It often inhabits deciduous forests with hornbeam (Carpinus), oak (Quercus), beech (Fagus) and birch (Betula), <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> rarely occur with conifers: pine (Pinus), fir (Abies), spruce (Picea) and cedar (Cedrus). It has {{a preference for}} neutral to calcareous soils.|$|E
5|$|Pain {{typically}} {{occurs when}} the stomach is empty, between meals {{and in the early}} morning hours, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> occur at other times. Less common ulcer symptoms include nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite. Bleeding can also occur; prolonged bleeding may cause anemia leading to weakness and fatigue. If bleeding is heavy, hematemesis, hematochezia, or melena may occur.|$|E
5|$|Athletes {{performances}} are timed or measured at virtually all {{track and field}} competitions. Doing so can not only serve {{as a way of}} determining the winner in an event, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> be used for historical comparison (i.e. a record). A large variety of record types exist and men's and women's {{performances are}} recorded separately. The foremost types of records organise athlete's performances by the region they represent—beginning with national records, then continental records, up to the global or world record level. National governing bodies control the national record lists, the area associations organise their respective continental lists, and the IAAF ratifies world records.|$|E

50|$|The name Padye is {{supposed}} to have its origin in the Sumerian word Patesi. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> be <b>also</b> concluded that 'Padhye' or 'Padye' is a corrupted form of the Sanskrit word 'Upadhyay' which means a 'teacher'.|$|R
5000|$|The Capitán FAP Renán Elías Olivera Airport [...] is {{an airport}} serving Pisco, an oceanside {{city in the}} Ica Region of Peru. It {{is used by the}} Peruvian Army, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> be <b>also</b> used by civil aircraft.|$|R
5|$|B.brownii usually grows as {{an upright}} bush {{between one and}} three metres (3–10ft) high, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> grow as an openly {{branched}} small tree to six metres (20ft) in sheltered gullies, or as a low, spreading shrub in exposed locations such as the peaks of the Stirling Range. The bark is a grey-brown colour, smooth and thin, with lenticels. The leaves are long and thin, from three to ten centimetres (1–5in) long, and five to ten millimetres (–in) wide. Dark green and hairless above but with a hairy white underside, they are easily recognised by their feather-like appearance, caused {{by the fact that}} they are finely divided almost back to the midrib, into as many as 70 thin tapered lobes.|$|E
5|$|The Seal of Dartmouth College is the {{official}} insignia of Dartmouth College, an Ivy League university located in Hanover, New Hampshire, United States. Anglo-American law generally requires a corporate body to seek official government sanction, usually {{in the form of}} a charter, in order to operate. Such chartered bodies normally authenticate their official acts by marking them with a distinctive seal. The seal's design is usually complicated to avoid counterfeiting, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> express something about the institution's history or mission. Dartmouth College is one such chartered body, and it obtained its official seal in 1773.|$|E
5|$|The spire is a {{protruding}} part of {{the shell}} that includes all of the whorls except the largest and final whorl (known as the body whorl). It is usually more elongated than in other strombid snails, such as the closely related and larger goliath conch, Lobatus goliath that is endemic to Brazil. In L.gigas, the glossy finish or glaze around the aperture of the adult shell is primarily in pale shades of pink. It may show a cream, peach or yellow colouration, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> sometimes be tinged with a deep magenta, shading almost to red. The periostracum, a layer of protein (conchiolin) that is the outermost {{part of the}} shell surface, is thin and a pale brown or tan colour.|$|E
5000|$|The outer citadel {{entrance}} {{is through a}} gateway called [...] "Puerta de la Bóveda" [...] (Vault Gate), <b>but</b> nowadays <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> be accessed by an elevator. The entrance gate doubles back on itself, a design intended to make progress difficult for attacking forces.|$|R
50|$|Internal {{oxidation}} {{occurs when}} some {{components of the}} alloy are oxidized in preference to {{the balance of the}} bulk. The oxidizer is often oxygen diffusing through the metal bulk from the interface, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> be <b>also</b> another element (for example sulfur or nitrogen).|$|R
5000|$|Pendejo is a Spanish {{word and}} {{literally}} means [...] "a pubic hair", <b>but</b> in Mexico <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> be a vulgar insult.|$|R
5|$|In the {{majority}} of cases the damage results from physical trauma such as car accidents, gunshots, falls, or sports injuries, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> result from nontraumatic causes such as infection, insufficient blood flow, and tumors. Efforts to prevent SCI include individual measures such as using safety equipment, societal measures such as safety regulations in sports and traffic, and improvements to equipment. Known since ancient times to be a catastrophic injury and long believed to be untreatable, SCI has seen great improvements in its care since the middle of the 20th century. Treatment of spinal cord injuries starts with stabilizing the spine and controlling inflammation to prevent further damage. Other interventions needed can vary widely depending on the location and extent of the injury, from bed rest to surgery. In many cases, spinal cord injuries require substantial, long-term physical and occupational therapy in rehabilitation, especially if they interfere with activities of daily living. Research into new treatments for spinal cord injuries includes stem cell implantation, engineered materials for tissue support, and wearable robotic exoskeletons.|$|E
5|$|Inside the brain, {{dopamine}} {{functions as}} a neurotransmitter and neuromodulator, and is controlled {{by a set of}} mechanisms common to all monoamine neurotransmitters. After synthesis, dopamine is transported from the cytosol into synaptic vesicles by a solute carrier—a vesicular monoamine transporter, VMAT2. Dopamine is stored in these vesicles until it is ejected into the synaptic cleft. In most cases, the release of dopamine occurs through a process called exocytosis which is caused by action potentials, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> be caused by the activity of an intracellular trace amine-associated receptor, TAAR1. TAAR1 is a high-affinity receptor for dopamine, trace amines, and certain substituted amphetamines that is located along membranes in the intracellular milieu of the presynaptic cell; activation of the receptor can regulate dopamine signaling by inducing dopamine reuptake inhibition and efflux as well as by inhibiting neuronal firing through a diverse set of mechanisms.|$|E
5|$|Most puzzles {{are located}} on {{recognizable}} eye-level panels scattered around the island, often connected with power cables that light up once a puzzle is solved and guiding the player to the next puzzle. Some puzzles incorporate the game's architecture, such as one that requires the player to view background elements through a semi-transparent puzzle panel to determine the solution. There are also non-obvious puzzles built into the environment itself, requiring the player to find the correct vantage point to complete the puzzle. At any time, the player can engage the maze-drawing mode, which {{is marked by a}} white border on screen. While in this mode, the player's avatar is prevented from moving and instead allows the player to use their controls to trace the path through a presented maze. The mode ends once the player solves the puzzle or cancels the mode. Normally, this mode is activated in front of a panel, moving the player's view directly to the panel to solve it, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> be activated at any other time to engage those puzzles that are based on vantage points. Nearly all puzzles provide immediate feedback if they have been solved correctly or not through sound effects or visual indication.|$|E
50|$|Body odor {{is present}} both in {{animals and humans}} and its {{intensity}} can be influenced by many factors (behavioral patterns, survival strategies). Body odor has a strong genetic basis both in animals and humans, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> be <b>also</b> strongly influenced by various diseases and psychological conditions.|$|R
5000|$|Many {{variants}} {{of the reaction}} exist. The only key chemical is the bromate oxidizer. The catalyst ion is most often cerium, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> be <b>also</b> manganese, or complexes of iron, ruthenium, cobalt, copper, chromium, silver, nickel and osmium. Many different reductants can be used. (Zhabotinsky, 1964b; Field and Burger, 1985) ...|$|R

5|$|Lacquerware is {{produced}} in a three-step process: first the base is prepared. Most often the base consists of wood, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> be of paper or leather. Next is the application of lacquer, which hardens while drying, thereby sealing the base. Generally several layers of lacquer are applied. The lacquer is then decorated {{with a variety of}} methods. In the maki-e technique, a powdered metal (usually gold or silver) is sprinkled on the lacquer before completely hardened. This technique was developed and popular in the Heian period but continued to be used with refinements into the early modern period. Over the next centuries various other methods that employ precious metals were developed, such as the ikakeji technique originating in the Kamakura period in which a finely ground gold powder was spread in sufficient quantities to mimic solid gold. The use of metallic powders was complemented with other techniques such as polished shell inlay or gold leaf (kirikane). The former was used in the Heian and Kamakura periods and popular motifs included water, rocks, trees or flowers. Starting in the Kamakura period, larger and more solid objects such as toiletry chests were decorated with realistic images. Towards the end of the medieval period (late-16th century), simpler designs were favoured in decorations. Honami Kōetsu who lived around this time is the earliest lacquer artist known by name.|$|E
