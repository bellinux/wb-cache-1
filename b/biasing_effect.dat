In this direction, his 2010 book, Mood Matters: From Rising Skirt Lengths to the Collapse of World Powers, published by Copernicus Books, NY, addresses the directions and patterns of social causation and their implications for future trends and collective social events, such as styles in popular culture, the outcome of political processes, and even the rise and fall of civilizations. His most recent book is X-EVENTS: The Collapse of Everything, which addresses the underlying cause of extreme events generated by human inattention, misunderstanding, error, stupidity and/or malevolent intent. The English original edition was published in June 2012 by HarperCollins/Morrow, New York. The book now exists in 15 foreign editions, as well, including German, Japanese, Russian, Dutch, Korean and Portuguese.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of a meta-analytic {{integration}} of {{the results of}} 137 tests of the ingroup bias hypothesis. Overall, the ingroup <b>bias</b> <b>effect</b> was highly significant and of moderate magnitude. Several theoretically informative determinants of the ingroup <b>bias</b> <b>effect</b> were established. This ingroup <b>bias</b> <b>effect</b> was significantly stronger when the ingroup was made salient (by virtue of proportionate size and by virtue of reality of the group categorization). A significant interaction between the reality of the group categorization and the relative status of the ingroup revealed a slight decrease in the ingroup <b>bias</b> <b>effect</b> as a function of status in real groups, and {{a significant increase in the}} ingroup <b>bias</b> <b>effect</b> as a function of status in artificial groups. Finally, an interaction between item relevance and ingroup status was observed, such that higher status groups exhibited more ingroup bias on more relevant attributes, whereas lower status groups exhibited more ingroup bias on less relevant attributes. Discussion considers the implications of these results for current theory and future research involving the ingroup <b>bias</b> <b>effect...</b>|$|R

It remains unclear at which stage the split information converges. In the current study, we applied the Double Filtering by Frequency (DFF) theory (Ivry & Robertson, 1998) to modeling the visual split; the theory assumes a right hemisphere/low frequency bias.

We show that the early convergence model failed to show the left side <b>bias</b> <b>effect.</b> The left side <b>bias</b> <b>effect</b> was also observed in Greeble recognition.

40|$|This paper {{looks at}} how Philippine trade reform which {{consists}} of tariff reduction and elimination of quantitative restrictions (QR) on rice imports will affect poverty within two world trade scenarios: Doha and free world trade. The impact of Doha is very small and generates <b>biased</b> <b>effects</b> against agriculture. The impact of Philippine trade reform within the Doha agenda magnifies this <b>biased</b> <b>effect,</b> making rural households worse-off compared to urban households. However, eliminating rice QR generates a set of effects where consumer price reduction dominates nominal income decline. Thus, real income improves and poverty declines across household groups, but the net effects are lower in rural than in urban households. The impact of a free world trade economy is favorable in terms of higher export prices and export demand for agriculture and agriculture-related manufacturing industries. This mitigates the <b>biased</b> <b>effects</b> against agriculture, and is therefore favorable to rural households.

The huge box-size of the Hubble volume simulation {{enables us to}} carry out a reliable statistical analysis of the biasing properties of halos at a Gaussian smoothing scale of R_G> 30 Mpc/h with a cluster-mass scale of between 7 * 10 ^{ 13 }Msolar/h and 6 * 10 ^{ 15 }Msolar/h. A detailed comparison of the genus for dark matter halos with that for the mass distribution shows that the non-Gaussianity induced by the halo biasing is comparable to that by nonlinear gravitational evolution, and both the shape and the amplitude of the genus are almost insensitive to the halo mass at R_G> 30 Mpc/h. In order to characterize the <b>biasing</b> <b>effect</b> on the genus, we apply a perturbative formula developed by Matsubara (1994). We find that the perturbative formula well describes the simulated halo genus at R_G> 50 Mpc/h.

The wires were fabricated using optical lithography, metallization by sputtering and lift-off technique. Magnetotransport measurements were performed at temperatures ranging from 3 to 300 K. We observed marked changes in the magnetoresistance (MR) properties as the temperature is varied. At 300 K, the field at which the sharp peak occurs corresponding to the magnetization reversal of the Co wires is 167 Oe and is symmetrical about the origin. As the temperature was decreased to 3 K, we observed {{a shift in the}} peak positions of the MR characteristics for both the forward and reverse field sweeps corresponding to a loop shift of 582 Oe in the field axis. The asymmetric shift in the MR loops at lowtemperatures clearly indicates the exchange bias between ferromagnetic (Co) and antiferromagnetic parts (Co-oxide at the surfaces) from natural oxidation.
