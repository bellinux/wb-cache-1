40|$|The amphibolites and mafic schists which {{occur in}} the Older Precambrian rocks of the Grand Canyon are divided into five major groups {{on the basis of}} field {{occurrence}} and mineral composition :(1) anthophyllite- and cordierite-anthophyllite- bearing rocks (2) early (plagioclase-hornblende) amphibolites (3) Granite Park mafic body (4) hornblende-bearing dykes (5) tremolite-bearing- dykes. Cordierite-anthophyllite rocks and associated mafic schists represent sedimentary types which attained their bulk composition prior to metamorphism. They were derived in varying degrees from <b>basic</b> <b>igneous</b> <b>materials</b> which had suffered intense alteration and loss of lime and alkalis, probably by reactions with sea water. The early amphibolites were originally a series of lavas and tuffs of approximately basaltic composition. These meta-volcanic rocks have a tholeiitic character, and trace element considerations indicate that they may have formed in an island arc environment. Field and chemical data for the Granite Park mafic body strongly suggest that it originated as a layered series of plagioclase-rich cumulates. The body shows calc-alkaline chemical trends but with some affinity to tholeiitic rocks. Hornblende-bearing dykes range from ultramafic types composed only of hornblende plus opaques, to more normal plagioclase- hornblende amphibolites; the original composition {{of the majority of the}} dykes was probably in the basalt to basaltic-andesite range. They are strongly tholeiitic and may represent either ocean floor or island arc intrusives according to trace eluent data. Tremolite-bearing dykes are highly magnesian in composition, plot as early differentiates, and belong to either the calc-alkali or the tholeiitic series...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{emplacement}} of <b>igneous</b> <b>material</b> into upper crustal {{rocks of}} sedimentary basins {{is likely to}} be strongly controlled by the geometry of the pre-existing basin structures. These controls are investigated using examples from the Tertiary igneous complexes of Skye, part of the Sea of Hebrides basin of NW Scotland. The basin consists of an array of half-graben related to SE-dipping normal faults. These pre-volcanic, Mesozoic structures are traced near the igneous complexes using geological relationships preserved unconformably beneath the widespread basaltic lava fields. The unconformity represents a period of Cretaceous uplift and denudation of the basin and its flanks, entirely pre-dating the Tertiary volcanism of NW Scotland. This unconformity seals stratigraphically the major basin faults, preserving field relationships that permit the tracing of these faults in the country rocks to the Tertiary intrusions. The major Camasunary fault is separated from the Raasay fault via a series of minor graben, linked by a series of steep, NW-SE-trending faults that transfered Mesozoic displace-ments between the principal fault strands. A broad range of <b>igneous</b> <b>material</b> of various compositions was intruded into part of the Mesozoic Sea of Hebrides basins and their flanks during Palaeocene times. Different emplacement styles and different structural controls are found. The major gabbroic centres {{do not appear to be}} controlled b...|$|R
40|$|Summary. The {{results of}} the electron-probe mieroanatysis ofthe three {{minerals}} from orthopyroxene-amphibole spinel coronas between olivine and plagioelase in a troctolite from Sulitjelma, Norway, are presented. They are shown to be incom-patible with a late. magmatic origin for the coronas, but compatible with an origin by diffusion of material in solution in an aqueous medium across the olivine-plagioclase interface. This theory is discussed on a quantitive basis {{in the light of}} the mieroanalytical data. EACTION zones, or 'coronas', between olivine and plagioelase are often found in coarse-grained <b>basic</b> or ultrabasic <b>igneous</b> rocks. The reaction zones may consist of a variety of minerals but commonly two zones are present: a zone of orthopyroxene nex ~ to the olivine and a zone of an intergrowth of amphibole and spine] next to the plagioclase (BrSgger, 1934; Shand, 1945).

40|$|We {{present the}} first {{measurements}} of vanadium (V) stable isotopes for six reference materials - USGS PCC- 1, BHVO- 2, BCR- 2, BIR- 1 a, GSP- 2 and AGV- 2 - plus the widely available carbonaceous chondrite Allende. We present standard addition and matrix spiking tests {{to assess the}} robustness and reproducibility of our data. Standard addition utilised an enriched 50 V solution designated VISSOX (Vanadium Isotope Standard Solution OXford). We further assessed the veracity of the method by spiking collected sample matrices with {{the same amount of}} a V standard solution, whose isotopic composition was defined as 0 ‰. Standard addition and matrix spiking tests recorded no appreciable artificial isotope fractionation. We estimate that the best currently attainable long-term reproducibility of stable 51 V/ 50 V isotope measurements in complex matrices is 0. 15 ‰, which is in the same order as the reproducibility achievable with standard solutions. Finally, a large range of ∼ 1. 2 ‰ in stable V isotopic composition was documented, with ∼ 0. 5 ‰ of that variation in high temperature <b>igneous</b> <b>materials</b> alone. The range and resolving power of V stable isotopes, with respect to <b>igneous</b> <b>material,</b> compared favourably with the magnitude of fractionation reported for other non-traditional stable isotope systems, which bodes well for the utility of this new system. © 2011 The Authors.
