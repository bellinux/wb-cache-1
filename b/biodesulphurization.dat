40|$|The <b>biodesulphurization</b> of Mengen lignite by a {{mesophilic}} bacterium, Rhodococcus rhodochrous ATCC 53968, {{was investigated}} in a batch stirred and aerated reactor. The experiments were carried out at 28 degrees C with an inoculum percentage, initial pH, initial sodium acetate and lignite concentration of the <b>biodesulphurization</b> medium of 8 % [v/v], 6. 5 mM, 20 mM and 20 g/l, respectively. Variations in the sulphur contents of the lignite relative to the <b>biodesulphurization</b> period were monitored. The effects of the stirring and aeration rates on the removal of different sulphur forms from coal were investigated in the ranges 450 - 1, 200 rpm and 0. 1 - 0. 53 vvm and the optimum values {{were found to be}} 500 rpm and 0. 18 vvm, respectively. An increase in the total sulphur reduction with increasing <b>biodesulphurization</b> time was observed. The maximum total sulphur removal percentage was found to be 15. 2 % at 1, 200 rpm after four days of incubation. The highest total sulphur removal rate was calculated {{on the second day of}} microbial desulphurization for each run. The total and organic sulphur contents of the coal after <b>biodesulphurization</b> were correlated with the stirring and aeration rates by using the non-linear least squares regression method. In the experimental runs lasting 8 days, the highest organic sulphur reducing percentage of 10. 1 % was obtained at a stirring rate of 500 rpm and an aeration rate of 0. 40 vvm...|$|E
40|$|One of the {{perspective}} methods for clean solid fuels production is <b>biodesulphurization.</b> In {{order to increase}} {{the effect of this}} approach it is necessary to apply the advantages of more informative analytical techniques. Atmospheric pressure temperature programming reduction (AP-TPR) coupled with different detection systems gave us ground to attain more satisfactory explanation of the effects of <b>biodesulphurization</b> on the treated solid products. Subbituminous high sulphur coal from ‘‘Pirin” basin (Bulgaria) was selected as a high sulphur containing sample.

40|$|Background: Modeling the {{kinetics}} of the <b>biodesulphurization</b> bioprocess for the refining of pyrite ash by Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Acetobacter aceti {{have been}} studied in batch-type liquid- state bioreactors. Results: The <b>biodesulphurization</b> experiments were performed at varying temperatures of 25 ºC, 30 ºC and 35 ºC for eight weeks. Glucose, acetic acid and ethyl alcohol {{were used in the}} incubation media as substrates and acid sources. pH and oxidation reduction potential (ORP) observations have been determined weekly and the dissolved sulphur was measured {{at the end of the}} eight weeks trials. An equation calculating pH was derived from the iron oxidation reaction containing the ferric to ferrous iron [Fe+ 3 /Fe+ 2] ratio as a variable. The Michaelis-Menten predictive specific growth rates (qFe+ 2), which were estimated from pH and ORP observations, were compared by plotting [qFe+²]pH vs. [qFe+ 2]mV. The highest ratio of dissolved sulphur over total sulphur (Sd/St) was found to be 0. 5 in the <b>biodesulphurization</b> processes. Conclusions: The model provides predictions of ferric to ferrous iron rates and specific growth rates [qFe+²]pH vs. [qFe+ 2]mV and can be used for the determination of oxidized and reduced ions. The ratios of dissolved sulphur to total sulphur (Sd/St) have shown some promising results for S. cerevisiae to be used as a <b>biodesulphurization</b> and refining microorganism for pyrite ash and the other sulphide minerals...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this project was to Biodeslphurize the coal using of Acidi Thiobacillus ferroxidans. Sulphur removing bacteria and the specific objectives were, to isolate “Acidi Thiobacillus ferroxidans “from Assam Coal Mine samples. To attempt Bio desulfurization process of Lignite Coal in Bubble column reactor. To analyse level of sulphate concentration during <b>biodesulphurization</b> process. To characterize coal samples by XRD and SEM/EDS for confirming sulphur removal. Sulphur removing bacteria with high <b>biodesulphurization</b> ability were identified [...] This bacterium removed 77 % of the sulphur in bubble coulm reactor. The SEM-EDS and XRD methods identified the mineral matter and directly quantified the sulphur in the coal matrix. The SEM micrograph was shown high luminous and less darkness. This indicates the removal of sulphur in biodesulphurized coal. The EDS results gave the negative value of sulphur,- 21. 13 wt%. This indicates the absence of sulphur in the biodesulphurized coal...|$|E
40|$|Our {{research}} {{focus is}} to isolate microbial biocatalyst using dibenzothiophene as model compound with practical approach to biodesulfurization of petroleum. Isolates {{were obtained from}} soil microcosm, culture enrichment with dibenzothiophene (DBT), selection for fluorescence under UV light {{for the presence of}} phenol, 2 -hydroxybiphenyl (2 -HBP), staining using 4 - aminoantipyrene and purification using thermal induction. Culture isolates were preadapted in diesel by surface growth exposure. UV absorbance scanning was with a recording spectrophotometer to identify 2 -HBP spectra of the isolates. <b>Biodesulphurization</b> of commercial feedstock using strain biomass were done in agitated flasks with buffer at 45 oC. Samples were processed for GC-MS/ or FTIR. One primary isolate, 3 Jn screened positive for phenol, showed similar UV spectra of 2 -HBP, the main product of 4 S multienzyme pathway for aerobic desulfurization. <b>Biodesulphurization</b> activity depressed by yeast extract appeared to be temperature dependent. The 18 purified, facultative thermo strains were active to both two-ring, benozothiophene (BT) and three-ring, DBT organic sulfur compounds and thus could be widely used as “cleaning” desulfurizing agents. Strains showed differences in “expression” of DBT or BT with opposing orientation, which suggested that activity with organic sulphur compounds was "competitive". However, isolates without significant difference in activity were also detected to as much as 67 % or greater than 39 % among the strains selected. FTIR analyses showed reduction in spectral signals with microbial treatment. <b>Biodesulphurization</b> based on the optical density of spent media from treated feedstock showed more than 2 x activity compared to controls...|$|E
40|$|Desulphurization {{of liquid}} {{hydrocarbon}} fuel is necessary {{due to the}} increasingly stringent environmental regulations on the sulphur content of liquid hydrocarbon fuel. Also, oil products produced from waste tyre pyrolysis have sulphur content of about 1. 0 wt% which is far higher than the regulations. Therefore, desulphurization is important for commercialization of tyre pyrolysis oil. In this project, different chemical desulphurization methods were applied to tyre pyrolysis oil. It {{was found that the}} best desulphurization system consists of three processes. Oil is first extracted by acetonitrile, followed by the oxidative desulphurization by hydrogen peroxide and acetic acid. The last step is a further extraction by acetonitrile. This desulphurization gives high desulphurization efficiency with reasonable oil recovery. After determining the best chemical desulphurization system, three reaction parameters (reaction temperature, amount of acetic acid and amount of hydrogen peroxide) were investigated. For each parameter, four conditions were examined. The results showed that the best desulphurization conditions are 50 °C with 5 vol% of acetic acid and 10 vol% of 30 % hydrogen peroxide solution. The desulphurization efficiency of this system is around 30 %. Biological desulphurization of tyre pyrolysis oil by Rhodococcus erythropolis IGTS 8 was conducted both in flask cultures and in a controlled fermenter. It was found that the optimum oil/water ratio was 1 : 1. The desulphurization of this system was around 28 %. Emulsification and demulsification of oil and water during <b>biodesulphurization</b> was also investigated. The optimum emulsification is achieved by aeration while demulsification can be achieved by either ultrasound or centrifugation depending on requirements on oil quality and reaction time requirements. A novel scheme for combining chemical, physical and biological desulphurization was developed based on the experimental findings. In this system, <b>biodesulphurization</b> is conducted before chemical desulphurization. The reactor used for <b>biodesulphurization</b> is a plug flow reactor (PFR) while that used for chemical desulphurization is a continuous-stirred tank reactor (CSTR) ...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} achieve {{stringent}} environmental and safety requirements, refineries are in search of “green” and cost-effective methods for crude oil desulphurization. Combined desulphurization technologies are being studied, including bioprocessing to upgrade fossil fuels. Using <b>biodesulphurization</b> (BDS), which is a biochemical process mediated by specific microorganisms, {{it is possible to}} desulphurize most of the hydrodesulphurization (HDS) recalcitrant sulphur compounds under mild operating conditions, making it a simple and eco-friendly process. In this study, two BDS process designs are compared, in terms of energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions and operational costs by following a life cycle assessment (LCA) and life cycle cost (LCC) based methodology. The industrial HDS process is used as the reference technology for sulphur removal from fossil fuels. Different theoretical scenarios were considered and the best BDS results are scaled-up to evaluate a case study of providing ultra low sulphur diesel to an urban taxi fleet. This study exploits the potential of BDS as a cost-effective and eco-friendly alternative or complementary technology to the commonly HDS towards ultra low sulphur fuels...|$|E
40|$|Thermal analysis, i. e. TGA/DTA is used {{to study}} {{the changes in the}} {{combustion}} behaviour of microbially treated coals. In view of their high sulphur content and industrial significance three samples are under consideration, i. e. one lignite and two subbituminous from different region in Bulgaria. The differences in burning profiles can be related to structural changes resulted from biological treatments. The overall biological treatment generates these changes probably due to the oxidation process. Concerning organic sulphur <b>biodesulphurization</b> there is no change in any drastic mannerof the thermal characteristic parameters. In general, applied biotreatments provoke a complex influence on combustion coal behaviour. From one side a better ignition performance, a minor decrease in higher heating value and diminishing peak temperature of maximum weight loss rate for all biotreated samples are observed. From other side some decrease in the combustibility indicated by an increase in the combustion time and the end of combustion temperature are obvious. Also well determined decrease of self-heating temperature after biotreatments evolves high risk of spontaneous unmanageable coal combustion...|$|E
40|$|Aims: Through <b>biodesulphurization</b> (BDS) is {{possible}} to remove the sulphur present in fossil fuels {{to carry out the}} very strict legislation. However, this biological process is limited by the cost of the culture medium, and thus, it is important to explore cheaper alternative carbon sources, such as Jerusalem artichoke (JA). These carbon sources usually contain sulphates which interfere with the BDS process. The goal of this work was to remove the sulphates from Jerusalem artichoke juice (JAJ) through BaCl 2 precipitation viewing the optimization of dibenzothiophene (DBT) desulphurization by Gordonia alkanivorans strain 1 B. Methods and Results: Using a statistical design (Doehlert distribution), the effect of BaCl 2 concentration (0 · 125 – 0 · 625 %) and pH (5 – 9) was studied on sulphate concentration in hydrolysed JAJ. A validated surface response derived from data indicated that zero sulphates can be achieved with 0 · 5 – 0 · 55 % (w/v) BaCl 2 at pH 7; however, parallel BDS assays showed that the highest desulphurization was obtained with the juice treated with 0 · 5 % (w/v) BaCl 2 at pH 8 · 73. Further assays demonstrated that enhanced DBT desulphurization was achieved using hydrolysed JAJ treated in these optimal conditions. A total conversion of 400 µmol l- 1 DBT into 2 -hydroxybiphenyl (2 -HBP) in < 90 h was observed, attaining a 2 -HBP maximum production rate of 28 · 2 µmol l- 1 h- 1 and a specific production rate of 5 · 06 µmol- 1 g- 1 (DCW) h- 1. Conclusions: These results highlight the efficacy of the treatment applied to JAJ in making this agromaterial a promising low-cost renewable feedstock for improved BDS by the fructophilic strain 1 B. Significance and Impact of the Study: This study is a fundamental step viewing BDS application at the industrial level as it accounts a cost-effective production of the biocatalysts, one of the main drawbacks for BDS scale-up...|$|E
