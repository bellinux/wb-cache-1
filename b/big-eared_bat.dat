40|$|Rafinesque’s <b>big-eared</b> <b>bats</b> (Corynorhinus rafinesquii) occur {{throughout}} the South and into some Midwestern states. However, they are rare {{throughout the}}ir range and {{are considered to}} be a species of special concern in every state in which they occur. Previous studies have documented the use of bridges by Rafinesque’s <b>big-eared</b> <b>bats</b> in Louisiana, Mississippi, and North Carolina, but information on bridge use across the range is lacking. Furthermore, two of the three studies on bridge use were conducted in national forests. Thus, our objective was to determine the use and selection of bridges as day roosts by Rafinesque’s <b>big-eared</b> <b>bats</b> on all public roads in South Carolina. We surveyed 1, 129 bridges within all 46 counties from May to August 2002. During the summer of 2003, we monitored 236 bridges in previously occupied areas of the state one to five times to evaluate bridge-roost fidelity. Colonies (including maternal groups) and solitary <b>big-eared</b> <b>bats</b> were found beneath 38 bridges in 2002 and 55 bridges in 2003. Occupancy in both years was strongly influenced by bridge size (P < 0. 001) and construction type (P < 0. 001); bats selected large, concrete-girder bridges and avoided flat-bottomed, slab bridges. Rafinesque’s <b>big-eared</b> <b>bats</b> occupied bridges in the Upper and Lower Coastal Plain, but were absent from bridges in the Piedmont and Blue Ridge Mountains. <b>Big-eared</b> <b>bats</b> demonstrated a high degree of roost fidelity (65. 9 percent). We also found that checking bridges three times at two-week intervals ensured the detection of bats, but checking more than three times did not increase detection probabilities. The high degree of fidelity and use by maternal groups suggest that highway bridges are important roosting sites for Rafinesque’s <b>big-eared</b> <b>bats</b> in the South Carolina Coastal Plain. Our results also suggest that if repair or maintenance work is planned for girder bridges during the summer, they should be inspected three times over a four to six week period. Because other studies have shown that Rafinesque’s <b>big-eared</b> <b>bats</b> rarely use bridges during winter, delaying work on occupied bridges until that time will aid in the conservation of this rare species.

40|$|Bats {{respond to}} the calls of conspecifics {{as well as to}} calls of other species; however, few studies have {{attempted}} to quantify these responses or understand the functions of these calls. We tested the response of Rafinesque’s <b>big-eared</b> <b>bats</b> (Corynorhinus rafinesquii) to social calls as a possible method to increase capture success and to understand the function of social calls. We also tested if calls of bats within the range of the previously designated subspecies differed, if the responses of Rafinesque’s <b>big-eared</b> <b>bats</b> varied with geographic origin of the calls, and if other species responded to the calls of C. rafinesquii. We recorded calls of Rafinesque’s <b>big-eared</b> <b>bats</b> at two colony roost sites in South Carolina, USA. Calls were recorded while bats were in the roosts and as they exited. Playback sequences for each site were created by copying typical pulses into the playback file. Two mist nets were placed approximately 50 – 500 m from known roost sites; the net with the playback equipment served as the Experimental net and the one without the equipment served as the Control net. Call structures differed significantly between the Mountain and Coastal Plains populations with calls from the Mountains being of higher frequency and longer duration. Ten of 11 Rafinesque’s <b>big-eared</b> <b>bats</b> were caught in the Control nets and, 13 of 19 bats of other species were captured at Experimental nets even though overall bat activity did not differ significantly between Control and Experimental nets.

25|$|The Virginia <b>big-eared</b> <b>bat</b> is {{classified}} as Corynorhinus townsendii virginianus. The Corynorhinus genus, called the North American Big-Eared Bats, consists of three different species located from central Mexico to southwestern Canada (C. mexicanus, C. rafinesquii, C. townsendii). The subspecies of C. townsendii are C. t. townsendii, C. t. pallescens, C. t. australis, C. t. ingens, and C. t. virginianus, all of which primarily occupy North America. It is hypothesized that the MRCA, most recent common ancestor, of the Corynorhinus species diverged into two different lineages, creating a C. rafineesquii ancestor and C. mexicanus/ C. townsendii ancestor, during the warm periods of the Pliocene, approximately 5.0-2.5 mya. Then, during the cooling period of the early Pleistocene, 2.5 mya, the C. mexicanus/ C. townsendii lineage split, separating C. mexicanus and C. townsendii. During this same period, the C. townsendii species was further divided into three lineages, isolating a C. t. townsendii ancestor, a C. t. pallescens/ C. t. australis ancestor, and a C. t. ingens/ C. t. virginianus ancestor. Subsequent glacial advances around 1.8-1.0 mya finally divided all these lineages into the subspecies that are found today. The events that caused the subspeciation between C. t. ingens and C. t. virginianus {{are believed to have}} separated the already disjunct populations from each other, leading the then unified species towards separate refugia, leading to divergence and subsequent subspeciation.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. —Rafinesque’s <b>big-eared</b> <b>bats</b> (Corynorhinus rafinesquii) use bridges as day roosts {{in parts}} of their range, but {{information}} on bridge use across their range is lacking. From May to Aug. 2002 we surveyed 1129 bridges (12. 5 %) within all 46 counties of South Carolina to determine use and selection of bridges as day roosts by <b>big-eared</b> <b>bats</b> and to document their distribution across the state. During summer 2003, we visited 235 bridges in previously occupied areas {{of the state to}} evaluate short-term fidelity to bridge roosts. We found colonies and solitary <b>big-eared</b> <b>bats</b> beneath 38 bridges in 2002 and 54 bridges in 2003. Construction type and size of bridges strongly influenced use in both years; bats selected large, concrete girder bridges and avoided flat-bottomed slab bridges. The majority of occupied bridges (94. 7 %) were in the Upper and Lower Coastal Plains, but a few bridges (5. 3 %) were located in the Piedmont. Rafinesque’s <b>big-eared</b> <b>bats</b> were absent beneath bridges in the Blue Ridge Mountains. We established new records of occurrence for 10 counties. In the Coastal Plains, <b>big-eared</b> <b>bats</b> exhibited a high degree of short-term fidelity to roosts in highway bridges. For bridges that were occupied at least once, mean frequency of use was 65. 9 %. Probability of finding bats under a bridge ranged from 0. 46 to 0. 73 depending on whether the bridge was occupied in the previous year. Thus, bridges should be inspected three to five times in a given year to determine whether they are being used. Regional bridge roost surveys may be a good method for determining the distribution of C. rafinesquii, particularly in the Coastal Plains, and protection of suitable bridges may be a viable conservation strategy where natural roost sites are limited...|$|R

Bats were seldom seen flying over open spaces or flying above human occupied lands. The farthest a Virginia <b>Big-Eared</b> <b>Bat</b> has been observed foraging was 8.4km from its roost. This was shown through radio telemetry. [...] This study, located in Lee County, Kentucky, studied hills consisting of sandstone cliffs.

40|$|Little {{is known}} about factors {{affecting}} year-round use of roosts by Rafinesque's <b>big-eared</b> <b>bats</b> (Corynorhinus rafinesquii) or the long-term fidelity of this species to anthropogenic or natural roosts. The objectives {{of this study were}} to test whether seasonal use of roosts by Rafinesque's <b>big-eared</b> <b>bats</b> varied with roost type and environmental conditions within and among seasons and to document multiannual use of natural and anthropogenic structures by this species. We inspected 4 bridges, 1 building, and 59 tree roosts possessing basal cavity openings; roosts were inspected at least once per week from May through October in every year from 2005 through 2008 and once a month from November through April in every year from 2005 through 2009. We found that use of anthropogenic roosts was significantly greater than the use of tree roosts in summer but that the use of structure types did not differ in other seasons. There was significant seasonal variation in use of anthropogenic and tree roosts. Anthropogenic roost use was higher in summer than in all other seasons. There {{was no significant difference in}} tree use among spring, summer, and fall, but use in winter was significantly lower in 2 years of the study. Overall use of anthropogenic and tree roosts was positively related to minimum temperature, but the relationship between use of roosts and minimum temperature varied among seasons. Bats showed multiannual fidelity ({ge} 4 years) to all anthropogenic roosts and to some tree roosts, but fidelity of bats to anthropogenic roosts was greater and more consistent than to tree roosts. Our data indicate that Rafinesque's <b>big-eared</b> <b>bats</b> responded differently to environmental conditions among seasons; thus, a variety of structure types and characteristics are necessary for conservation of these bats.
