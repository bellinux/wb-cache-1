5|$|Philosopher Paul Tillich {{argued that}} {{religious}} faith is best expressed through symbolism because a symbol {{points to a}} meaning beyond itself and best expresses transcendent religious beliefs. He <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> any statement about God is symbolic and participates in {{the meaning of a}} concept. Tillich used the example of a national flag to illustrate his point: a flag points to something beyond itself, the country it represents, but also participates in the meaning of the country. He <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> symbols could unite a religious believer with a deeper dimension of himself as well as with a greater reality. Tillich <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> symbols must emerge from an individual collective unconsciousness, and can only function when they are accepted by the unconscious. He <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> symbols cannot be invented, but live and die at the appropriate times.|$|E
