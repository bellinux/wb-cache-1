5|$|Seizing upon a new {{development}} to visualize particle tracks, created by Donald Glaser and known as a <b>bubble</b> <b>chamber,</b> Alvarez realized the device was just what was needed, if only it {{could be made to}} function with liquid hydrogen. Hydrogen nuclei, which are protons, made the simplest and most desirable target for interactions with the particles produced by the Bevatron. He began a development program to build a series of small chambers, and championed the device to Ernest Lawrence.|$|E
5|$|After the war Alvarez was {{involved}} in the design of a liquid hydrogen <b>bubble</b> <b>chamber</b> that allowed his team to take millions of photographs of particle interactions, develop complex computer systems to measure and analyze these interactions, and discover entire families of new particles and resonance states. This work resulted in his being awarded the Nobel Prize in 1968. He {{was involved}} in a project to x-ray the Egyptian pyramids to search for unknown chambers. With his son, geologist Walter Alvarez, he developed the Alvarez hypothesis which proposes that the extinction event that wiped out the dinosaurs was the result of an asteroid impact.|$|E
5|$|In many applications, {{the noble}} gases {{are used to}} provide an inert atmosphere. Argon {{is used in the}} {{synthesis}} of air-sensitive compounds that are sensitive to nitrogen. Solid argon is also used for the study of very unstable compounds, such as reactive intermediates, by trapping them in an inert matrix at very low temperatures. Helium is used as the carrier medium in gas chromatography, as a filler gas for thermometers, and in devices for measuring radiation, such as the Geiger counter and the <b>bubble</b> <b>chamber.</b> Helium and argon are both commonly used to shield welding arcs and the surrounding base metal from the atmosphere during welding and cutting, as well as in other metallurgical processes and in the production of silicon for the semiconductor industry.|$|E

The decay products of this kaon can be seen spiraling in the magnetic field of the chamber.

25|$|He was a {{research}} associate at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) in the <b>bubble</b> <b>chamber</b> experimental research group from 1978–1982. There he was responsible for the hybrid <b>bubble</b> <b>chamber</b> facility's lead glass detector, in collaboration with colleagues from Duke University, Florida State University and the University of Tennessee. On the physics faculty at the University of Tennessee from 1982–1988, he continued investigations of photoproduction of charmed particles and vector mesons at SLAC. He joined the SLD Collaboration, beginning preparations for an experiment at the SLAC Linear Collider. He studied the design of a uranium calorimeter for SLD and in 1985 published an analysis in collaboration with Tony A. Gabriel — the first to show that despite earlier experimental work, compensation cannot be achieved with liquid argon readout. Using Monte Carlo calculations, Brau and Gabriel showed the importance of low energy neutron interactions with the readout medium hydrogen to achieve compensation.|$|E
25|$|The {{discovery}} of the W and Z bosons was considered a major success for CERN. First, in 1973, came the observation of neutral current interactions as predicted by electroweak theory. The huge Gargamelle <b>bubble</b> <b>chamber</b> photographed the tracks of a few electrons suddenly starting to move, seemingly of their own accord. This is interpreted as a neutrino interacting with the electron by the exchange of an unseen Z boson. The neutrino is otherwise undetectable, so the only observable effect is the momentum imparted to the electron by the interaction.|$|E
500|$|This program built {{a liquid}} {{hydrogen}} <b>bubble</b> <b>chamber</b> almost 7 feet (2 meters) long, employed dozens of physicists {{and graduate students}} together with hundreds of engineers and technicians, took millions of photographs of particle interactions, developed computer systems to measure and analyze the interactions, and discovered families of new particles and resonance states. This work resulted in the Nobel Prize in Physics for Alvarez in 1968, [...] "For his decisive contributions to elementary particle physics, in particular {{the discovery of a}} large number of resonant states, made possible through his development of the technique of using hydrogen bubble chambers and data analysis." ...|$|E

500|$|The group {{deliberately}} {{left out}} the grammatically correct question mark from the album title because aesthetically, [...] "it did not look right". The booklet insert contains stylized separate portraits of the Strokes, Raphael, Gentles, and Bowersock, all photographed by Lane. For the American market and the October 2001 release, the cover art of Is This It was changed to a psychedelic photograph of subatomic particle tracks in a <b>bubble</b> <b>chamber.</b> RCA product manager Dave Gottlieb commented that [...] "it was straight up a band decision", while Gentles indicated that Casablancas had wanted it to appear globally. According to the band's manager, the frontman phoned him before the Japan and Europe release and said, [...] "I found something even cooler than the ass picture." [...] At the time, the Lane photograph was already at the presses and {{was included in the}} July and August 2001 versions. The Strokes' 2003 biography mentions the fear of objections from America's conservative retail industry and right-wing lobby as reasons for the artwork's alteration.|$|E
500|$|When Burhop {{took charge}} of the <b>Bubble</b> <b>Chamber</b> Group at University College in 1967, he was quick to grasp the {{advantages}} of heavy liquid bubble chambers for studying neutrino interactions, and steered the group towards participation in joint European ventures, using the Gargamelle. The group's discovery of neutral currents in 1973 was a milestone {{on the road to the}} theoretical unification of electromagnetism with the weak force. [...] In 1974 and 1975, with the help of Robert R. Wilson, the director of the Fermilab in the United States, an international team from Fermilab and seven European laboratories under Burhop's leadership carried out a search for a new particle, the existence of which Burhop had predicted in 1963. He had suggested that neutrino interactions could create short-lived (perhaps as low as 10−14 s) particles that could be detected with the use of nuclear emulsion. Experiment E247 at Fermilab successfully detected particles with a lifetime of the order of 10−13 s. A follow-up experiment WA17 with the SPS confirmed the existence of the [...] (charmed lambda baryon), with a flight time of 7.3±0.1 x 10−13s.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1960s the Goldhabers {{realized}} that they should begin using the <b>bubble</b> <b>chamber</b> to continue their studies instead of nuclear emulsion so they formed the [...] "Goldhaber-Trilling Group" [...] with George Trilling. Goldhaber quickly became a renowned expert in hydrogen <b>bubble</b> <b>chamber</b> physics, accruing a lengthy list of invited papers and conference talks. [...] The Goldhabers {{were the first to}} measure the spin of the K* meson and the first to study the simultaneous production of pairs of resonant states. They also invented the triangle diagram to aid in their research.|$|E
5000|$|Other {{noteworthy}} {{features of}} the ZGS program were {{the large number of}} university-based users and the pioneering development of large superconducting magnets for <b>bubble</b> <b>chambers</b> and beam transport.|$|R
50|$|Due {{to these}} issues, <b>bubble</b> <b>chambers</b> {{have largely been}} {{replaced}} by wire chambers, which allow particle energies to be measured at the same time. Another alternative technique is the spark chamber.|$|R
50|$|After the war {{he joined}} Glasgow University’s Natural Philosophy {{department}} under Professor Philip Dee and between 1945 and 1958 he worked on expansion, diffusion and <b>bubble</b> <b>chambers</b> investigating nuclear photodisintegration by gamma rays.|$|R
2500|$|The Z boson {{is its own}} antiparticle. [...] Thus, all of its flavour quantum {{numbers and}} charges are zero. The {{exchange}} of a Z boson between particles, called a neutral current interaction, therefore leaves the interacting particles unaffected, except for a transfer of momentum. [...] boson interactions involving neutrinos have distinctive signatures: They provide the only known mechanism for elastic scattering of neutrinos in matter; neutrinos are almost as likely to scatter elastically (via Z boson exchange) as inelastically (via W boson exchange). The first prediction of Z bosons was made by Brazilian physicist José Leite Lopes in 1958, by devising an equation which showed the analogy of the weak nuclear interactions with electromagnetism. Steve Weinberg, Sheldon Glashow and Abdus Salam later used these results to develop the electroweak unification, in 1973. Weak neutral currents via Z boson exchange were confirmed shortly thereafter (also in 1973), in a neutrino experiment in the Gargamelle <b>bubble</b> <b>chamber</b> at CERN.|$|E
2500|$|The Strokes {{released}} {{their debut}} album, Is This It, in the US in October 2001. The album {{was produced by}} Gordon Raphael, as was their follow-up album Room On Fire. RCA delayed the North American (US) release over concerns with the album’s cover and lyrics. The UK-released cover features a black-and-white photo of a gloved hand on a woman's naked backside, shown in semi-profile (photographer Colin Lane's then-girlfriend,) while the North American version {{replaced it with a}} photo of particle collisions in the Big European <b>Bubble</b> <b>Chamber.</b> RCA replaced the track [...] "New York City Cops" [...] with [...] "When It Started", as the former featured potentially inflammatory lyrics {{in the wake of the}} [...] September 11 attacks. The track [...] "New York City Cops"—featuring the refrain, “New York City Cops, they ain't too smart”—was listed as No. 12 on New York Magazines [...] "Ultimate New York Playlist" [...] on March 1, 2010. Despite its delayed release (and the potential controversy), Is This It received critical acclaim—among other accolades, four stars from Rolling Stone, and a 9.1 from Pitchfork Media. The album made many critic's top-ten lists, was named the best album of the year by Entertainment Weekly and TIME, and (in an article previewing summer concerts) NME urged readers to attend the Strokes’ shows—as they were touring some of the [...] "best pop songs ever." [...] While critics noted the influence of CBGB stalwarts Television, Casablancas and bandmates claimed to have never heard the band, instead citing the Velvet Underground as a reference point.|$|E

50|$|For {{high energy}} physics experiments, {{it is used}} to observe a particle's path.

(In <b>bubble</b> <b>chambers,</b> photographic exposures were made and the resulting printed photographs were then examined.) A wire chamber is a chamber with many parallel wires, arranged as a grid and put on high voltage, with the metal casing being on ground potential. As in the Geiger counter, a particle leaves a trace of ions and electrons, which drift toward the case or the nearest wire, respectively. By marking off the wires which had a pulse of current, one can see the particle's path.|$|R
