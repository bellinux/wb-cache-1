25|$|To <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>safe</b> side, a pill-activated {{inflation}} {{device is}} preferred. A small pill that dissolves on water contact {{is the safest}} option, as it also works in shallow waters where a hydrostatic activator fails. This type of jacket is called an 'automatic'. As it is {{more sensitive to the}} presence of water, early models could also be activated by very heavy rain or spray. For this reason, spare re-arming kits should be carried on board for each life jacket. However, with modern cup/bobbin mechanisms this problem rarely arises and mechanisms such as the Halkey Roberts Pro firing system have all but eliminated accidental firing.|$|E

BOSS operates from 6 pm to until 2am Sunday thru Thursday and until 4am on the weekends during {{the spring and fall}} semesters. Summer hours are 7pm–12am, 7 days a week. Their van service will even drop people off right at their front door if they live in their area of service. This service is funded through students segregated fees.|$|E

25|$|On {{the day of}} the accident, two Harriers flew on {{missions}} from Tromsø, named Red 1 and Red 2. The {{first was}} the two-seat Harrier serial number XW925 with Wing Commander Peter Squire as pilot and Norwegian Major Bjørnar Vollstad. The aircraft left Tromsø at 14:27, nearly an hour after the crash. They flew to a gunnery range near Setermoen, followed by Red 2, a Harrier GR.3. The shooting range was enveloped in a blizzard, but Squire chose to carry out the practice. Red 1 was subject to an air burst; Squire did not register any damage, but chose to return to Tromsø and asked for a priority landing to <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>safe</b> side. The pilot of Red 2 believed his weapons were not secured and chose to carry out a priority landing at Bardufoss Air Station, located nearby.|$|E

40|$|AbstractA hollow {{thick-walled}} cylinder made of functionally {{graded material}} subjected to twist has been analyzed. The objective {{of this paper is}} to provide the guidance to design the torsion of thick-walled cylinder made of {{functionally graded material}} so that collapse of cylinder due to external pressure can be avoided. The concept of transition theory based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> concept of Lebesgue strain measure has been used to simplify the constitutive equations. Results have been analyzed theoretically and discussed numerically. From the discussion, we can conclude that highly non-homogeneous cylinder <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>safer</b> side of <b>the</b> design as compared to lesser non-homogeneous cylinder. This is because of the reason that percentage increase in pressure required for initial yielding to become fully plastic is very high for non-homogeneous cylinder whose non-homogeneity increases radially as compared to lesser non-homogeneous cylinder. Also, non-homogeneous cylinder whose thickness is very high <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>safer</b> side of <b>the</b> design as compared to less thick-walled cylinders because percentage increase in pressure required for initial yielding to become fully plastic is very high for highly thick-walled cylinders as compared to other cases...|$|R

2500|$|Archduke Charles {{wished to}} prevent the army of Moreau from joining with his {{colleague}} Jean-Baptiste Jourdan and the Army of Sambre-et-Meuse. The Austrian commander hoped to withdraw to the south bank of the Danube but the Army of Rhin-et-Moselle was following too closely. By attacking Moreau, the archduke hoped to push the French back in order {{to prevent the}}ir two armies from merging and to give his own troops enough room to cross the Danube safely. Also, he wanted to lure Moreau into crossing the Danube and separating himself from Jourdan. Moreau's army was extended across a front [...] wide. Charles drew up plans to attack on 11 August. He sent one column to cross to the north bank of the Danube at Günzburg to get behind the French right flank. His troops were ready to move at midnight, but heavy rains slowed several of his assault columns. On the 10th Saint-Cyr with Taponier's division, drove the Austrians in his front out of the village of Eglingen. Urged on by Moreau, Saint-Cyr balked because he believed that the enemy were in strength nearby. Before anything more could be done, the heavy rain began and made it impossible to fire the cannons on both sides. Moreau refused to let his subordinate withdraw to a more defensible position or to order Duhesme's division to move closer. The only concession Moreau would make was to send up one regiment of Carabiniers to patrol in front of Taponier. To <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>safe</b> side, Saint-Cyr stationed Lecourbe and one demi brigade at Dischingen where there was a bridge over the Egau River. Meanwhile, Duhesme stayed well to the south at Medlingen in the Danube valley.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} {{awareness}} of provisions of consumer protection act among dental and medical professionals in Udaipur city, Rajasthan, India. Materials and Methods: In a cross sectional study, a total of 448 professionals (253 males, 195 females) belonging to dental (222) and medical (226) categories were surveyed using a self administered structured questionnaire. The questionnaire comprised of 22 questions about {{the awareness of}} consumer protection art (CPA) and whether these profes-sionals were following the recommendations of CPA. The student’s t-test, ANOVA test, and Scheffe’s test were used as tests of significance. Results: The awareness scores were significantly higher for medical professionals com-pared with those of dental professionals. Similarly, postgraduates showed more awareness in both the professions and {{it was found that}} private practitioners significantly have more awareness than the academic sector. Conclusion: Though medical professionals have more awareness of CPA compared to dental professionals, considering the present scenario, better knowledge of CPA is neces-sary for both professionals in order to <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>safer</b> side...|$|R
30|$|The results {{obtained}} {{in the present study}} have two important implications: First, we are able to obtain the distribution of the test statistic under a fixed alternative by means of the recommended bootstrap method. This allows for determining the required sample size to detect a model violation which is considered relevant from a substantive point of view with fixed risks for the type-I and the type-II errors. And second, the necessary number of bootstrap replications for warranting a desired precision can be obtained. One might object that Eq. (11) only covers up to 15 items and may therefore not be used for larger instruments. But as we have seen, the larger the number of items, the fewer bootstrap samples are necessary given everything else is held constant. Therefore, one <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>safe</b> side using a minimum of 500 bootstrap samples for data sets comprising more items. The same applies to sample sizes beyond those considered here.|$|R

40|$|In the {{evaluation}} of flexural strength of reinforced concrete (RC) columns, the elastic-perfectly plastic constitutive model is generally used for steel reinforcement, which ignores the strain hardening effect. While some engineers believe that the flexural strength so obtained <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>safe</b> side, others <b>are</b> concerned that underestimation of member strength could lead to inaccurate prediction of overall structural behaviour especially under extreme events. In any case, {{better understanding of the}} possible over-strength and its effects on flexural ductility and failure mechanism is necessary. In this paper, the effects of strain hardening of reinforcement <b>on</b> <b>the</b> flexural strength and ductility of reinforced normal- and high-strength concrete columns <b>are</b> studied based <b>on</b> rigorous full-range moment-curvature analysis. The study has identified if and how various parameters affect the strain hardening effect, which include axial load ratio, concrete strength, confining stress, reinforcement ratio and the tensile-strength-to-yield-stress ratio of steel. The effects of strain hardening can be quite significant for RC columns under relatively low axial load and relatively high confining stress.
