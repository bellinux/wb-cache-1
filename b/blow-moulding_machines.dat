5000|$|... 1997 Kick-off of the {{manufacturing}} of stretch <b>blow-moulding</b> <b>machines</b> {{for the production of}} PET bottles ...|$|E
50|$|Top {{priority}} {{is given to}} stretch <b>blow-moulding</b> <b>machines</b> {{for the production of}} PET bottles of up to a volume of 3 liters, with an output of 12,800 to 80,000 bottles/hour. The PET recycling system is based on a PET Flakes cleaning process equipped with progressive temperature controls and decontamination.|$|E
50|$|Krones AG is a German {{packaging}} and bottling machine manufacturer. It is the world's leading manufacturer of lines for filling beverages in plastic and glass bottles or beverage cans. The company manufactures stretch <b>blow-moulding</b> <b>machines</b> for producing polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles, plus fillers, labellers, bottle washers, pasteurisers, inspectors, packers and palletisers. This product portfolio is complemented by material flow systems and process technology for producing beverages, plus syrup kitchens, for clients like breweries, dairies and soft-drink companies.|$|E
30|$|Major {{and minor}} setup times being typical for stretch <b>blow-moulding</b> <b>machines,</b> which {{represent}} {{the latest technology}} for processing plastic bottles, are assumed.|$|E
30|$|First, {{the usual}} {{assignment}} of setup costs and times to products does not realistically reflect the changeover processes prevalent in advanced manufacturing technology. In {{a great number}} of industrial settings, we observed that setup conditions are related to the processing mode of the production equipment rather than to individual product types. Hence, the common assignment of setup costs and times to individual products appears to be questionable since setup costs are often caused by changing the basic processing mode and not for switching between different product types. As an example, consider the bottling of beverages (see the case-based example in Sect. 5.1) where stretch <b>blow-moulding</b> <b>machines</b> are set up for a specific type of plastic bottles by mounting the required moulds into the processing head of the machine. Once the machine is set up for a specific type of bottle, a variety of beverages can be bottled with only a minor changeover between the different product types. Therefore, the definition of lot sizes should primarily refer to the retention of a basic setup condition of the production equipment instead to the production quantity of an individual item.|$|E
30|$|In many {{industrial}} production settings, e.g. in the beverage industry, setup conditions are considerably complex and {{the assignment of}} setup costs and times to a specific product may become a difficult task. As an example, consider <b>blow-moulding</b> <b>machines</b> which represent the recent technology for bottling of beverages like mineral water or fruit juices. This kind of machinery is set up for a specific shape and size of plastic bottles by mounting the required moulds into the processing head of the machine. The actual plastic bottles are formed on the machine from compact pre-forms through thermal and high-air pressure processes. Depending on {{the configuration of the}} machine, around 20 moulding devices are arranged on a rotary turret thus allowing a respective number of bottles to be produced on the fly. Due to the high-pressure filling capabilities of the machine, 15 â€“ 20, 000 plastic bottles of one-litre size can be filled per hour. Auxiliary equipment for bottle washing, capping and labelling is integrated into the line as well as packaging machines for the generation of unit loads used in retail stores or transportation. Once the line is set up for a specific type of bottle, a variety of beverages can be filled with only a minor changeover between the different product types.|$|E
