In 1931 she was rebuilt with a {{refrigerated cargo hold}} to enable her to transport fresh fish from the fisheries in Northern Norway. During the rebuild she was also fitted with wireless telegraphy. She was a popular ship amongst her passengers, with a large superstructure and a spacious promenade deck with a look-out salon in the <b>bow</b> <b>area.</b> Sanct Svithun was {{also known as a}} superbly seaworthy vessel.|$|E

500|$|Shortly before 08:00 {{local time}} on 7 December 1941, Japanese {{aircraft}} from six aircraft carriers struck the Pacific Fleet as it lay in port at Pearl Harbor, and wrought devastation on the warships and the facilities defending Hawaii. On board Arizona, the ship's air raid {{alarm went off}} at about 07:55, and the ship went to general quarters soon after. Shortly after 08:00, 10 Nakajima B5N [...] "Kate" [...] torpedo bombers, five each from the carriers [...] and , attacked Arizona. All of the aircraft were carrying [...] armor-piercing shells modified into [...] bombs. Flying at an estimated altitude of , Kagas aircraft bombed Arizona from amidships to stern.

2500|$|In {{the late}} evening of 18 May, Sirius was spotted by a German bomber {{aircraft}} in the strait Solbergfjorden off Finnlandsnes on Dyrøya in Troms county. The bomber came from a westerly direction, and after first strafing Sirius, the German aircraft attacked with seven bombs, and despite evasive manoeuvring by the Norwegian vessel, hit Sirius with two of them, sinking her. The first bomb hit the <b>bow</b> <b>area,</b> while the second struck amidships, breaking the ship in two lengthwise, in what was described by eyewitnesses on shore as [...] "opening up like a book". Seven crew members, including both the captain and the first mate, {{were killed in the}} sinking, while 11 survivors were rescued from the water by local people in rowing boats. The survivors, who had been strafed in the water by the German aircraft, were later retrieved by the submarine tender [...] and the local steamer [...] and brought to Harstad.|$|E

50|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, {{irrigation}} {{was extended to}} the <b>Bow</b> Island <b>area,</b> and the town doubled in population. Bow Island is surrounded by 110,000 acres (445 km²) of highly productive lands. Some of the most modern irrigation systems {{in the world are}} located in the area; the first pivot and linear sprinkler systems in Canada were erected in the <b>Bow</b> Island <b>area.</b> A completely automated distribution system was installed in 1982 by the St. Mary River Irrigation District (SMRID), and it serves an area of 5,000 acres (20 km²).

2500|$|The gun deck {{was where}} the {{passengers}} resided during the voyage, in a space measuring about [...] with a [...] overhead (ceiling). [...] But {{it was also a}} dangerous place in conflict, as it had port and starboard gun ports from which cannon could be run out to fire on the enemy. The gun room was in the stern area of the gun deck, to which passengers had no access due to it being the storage space for powder and ammunition for the ship's cannons and any other weapons belonging to the ship. The gun room might also house a pair of stern chasers, small cannons used to fire out the stern of the ship. Forward on the gun deck in the <b>bow</b> <b>area</b> was a windlass, equipment similar in function to the capstan in steerage, which was used to raise and lower the ship's main anchor. [...] There were no stairs for the passengers on the gun deck to go up through the gratings to the main deck. [...] To get up to the main deck, passengers were required to climb a wooden or rope ladder.|$|E

During the incident Irma {{was in the same}} area as the 1907 Norwegian cargo ship SS Henry. Henry was sunk shortly after Irma. In addition to {{what turned out to be}} torpedo strikes the two ships were subjected to in total 2,034 rounds of heavy machine gun fire. Sixty-one civilian Norwegians died on Irma, another two on Henry. Only 25 people survived the sinking of Irma and for days afterwards dead bodies washed ashore on the Norwegian coast as far north as Namsos. Before Henry was sunk she had been able to launch two of her lifeboats and these first saved several of their own crewmen before moving to the location where Irma had gone down and rescuing some survivors from floating rafts. About an hour into the incident the tugboat Hopplafjord passed the scene and rescued further survivors from rafts. The fishing boat Sveggøy also rescued 12 survivors from a raft after the sinking.|$|E
