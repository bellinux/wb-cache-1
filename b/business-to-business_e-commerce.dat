In this work, auction theory and artificial intelligence techniques related to electronic auction handling are discussed at length. The techniques are evaluated in order to discover if they can add user value to a system by offering support to the user during electronic auction processes.

40|$|With {{its great}} {{explosion}} and {{the advancement of}} related technology and services, such as the World Wide Web (WWW), the Internet has provided a rich environment for developing Internet-based electronic commerce (e-commerce) applications in construction. Among {{the different types of}} <b>e-commerce,</b> <b>business-to-business</b> (B 2 B) is the most widely used. The B 2 B e-trading marketplaces (also called B 2 B-exchanges), which have sparked a revolution in the way of trading products between buyers and suppliers, are an essential component of B 2 B applications. However, many e-trading marketplaces have been developed and hosted by different construction products and services providers, and each forms a closed system with their own customers and clients. In this paper, the concept of e-union is presented, which integrates the services provided by different e-trading construction sites to provide an open e-trading service.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} how the disruptive innovation of e-commerce took hold among small retailers in the South of England {{in the first}} decade of the 21 st century. It describes empirically how a regional <b>business-to-business</b> market—providing <b>e-commerce</b> business services (EBS) to retail start-ups and small firms—emerged and operated, and how the goods traded in this market were evaluated. This market can be defined as an entrepreneurial market for an innovation because the market goods (EBS) constitute an innovation to be adopted by micro-enterprises as means of production to enable them to retail their own goods online to consumers. The study investigates two practical problems that concern the construction and operation of entrepreneurial markets for innovations: 1) how small firms as buyers of productive means evaluate complex, intangible market goods (such as EBS), given their lack of resources for conducting such evaluations; and 2) how policy makers and market makers address the market failure that is perceived to hinder the emergence of entrepreneurial markets. At the same time, this research also addresses the theoretical issues of how to define entrepreneurship, innovation, and markets and how to conceptualise the relationships between them, by empirically tracing and articulating the connections between the activities, objects, and places that constitute these phenomena. Actor-network theory (ANT) was utilised as a research approach to study an ecommerce community across two English counties, using ethnographic methods to collect data via participant observation, interviews, and documents between 2006 and 2010. ANT's material-semiotic method was deployed to trace the emergence, transformations, and workings of the socio-material network of institutions, policies, and technical artefacts that have enabled the functioning of this regional entrepreneurial market for EBS. Industry events such seminars, workshops, and conferences emerged as important marketplaces for establishing—through various trials—the qualities of buyers, sellers, and the EBS...|$|R

Doing business globally brings entirely new obstacles for <b>e-commerce</b> <b>Business-to-Business</b> (B 2 B) as, barriers, tariffs, culture, and customs and regulations, which {{have to be}} overcome before a successful e-business can be completed. Today many logistic providers offer technologies that enable a company to make their products and services global. By providing different systems for payment processing and to automate an international supply chain, including supply and demand management, logistics, import and export and documentation. The trend of e-commerce is hard to ignore and obstacles that may occur on the way can represent large opportunities in the future.

The result of our research shows that e-commerce B 2 B is predicted to develop more and faster in the future.

40|$|The World Wide Web is {{evolving}} into a medium providing {{a wide array}} of <b>e-commerce,</b> <b>business-to-business,</b> business-to-consumer, and other information-based services. In Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) technology, Web Services are emerging as the enabling technology that bridges decoupled systems across various platforms, programming languages, and applications. The benefits of Web Services and SOA {{come at the expense of}} introducing new level of complexity to the environments where these services are deployed. This complexity is compounded by the freedom to compose Web Services to address requirements such as quality of service (QoS), availability, security, reliability, and cost. The complexity of composing services compounds the task of securing, testing, and managing the quality of the deployed services. This chapter identifies the main security requirements for Web Services and describes how such security requirements are addressed by standards for Web Services security recently developed or under development by various standardizations bodies. Standards are reviewed according to a conceptual framework that groups them by the main functionalities they provide. Testing composite services in SOA environment is a discipline at an early stage of study. The chapter provides a brief overview of testing challenges that face early implementers of composite services in SOA taking into consideration Web Services security. The importance of Web Services Management systems in Web Services deployment is discussed. A step toward a fault model for Web Services is provided.
