Writing on her website, de Paul revealed she wrote this song when she was living in the United States and wanted to come back home to the UK.

5000|$|Overall, This Time {{has a more}} laid <b>back</b> <b>feel</b> {{than its}} defiant predecessor. Four of the twelve songs on the LP were written by Nelson and {{included}} on his Phases and Stages concept album, which was released earlier that same year. Nelson also sang on [...] "Heaven and Hell" [...] and contributed guitar to the album. The title track became Jennings' first chart-topping smash in June 1974. In the authorized video biography Renegade Outlaw Legend, the singer revealed, [...] "I wrote that song five years before and whoever was producing me then at RCA said it was no good. I was going through some old tapes and happened to find it." [...] Jennings added {{that he wanted to}} throw the song away but was persuaded not to by drummer Ritchie Albright. The album also marked the first time Jennings recorded a song written by Miriam Eddy, the ex-wife of producer Duane Eddy, who later changed her name to Jessi Colter and became Waylon's wife. Playing up to his outlaw personae, Jennings recorded the aptly titled [...] "Slow Movin' Outlaw" [...] and also included Texan songwriter Billy Joe Shaver's [...] "Slow Rollin' Low." ...|$|E
5000|$|Jonathan Andre of Indie Vision Music {{wrote that}} [...] "his bold {{release of a}} country record is an {{interesting}} move by Brandon, yet {{he is able to}} win the doubters ... over with reflective ballads, ingenious writing and hopeful stories of the characters providing inspiration to this album called Blue Mountain." [...] Louder Than the Music's Jono Davies wrote that [...] "there is a real maturity in the songwriting that flows in the creative lyrics of the songs", and the album to him was one [...] "that artist has always wanted to write" [...] and produce. Furthermore, Davies wrote that [...] "there is a very laid <b>back</b> <b>feel</b> to the album ... these aren't just good songs, they are also great stories about how Brandon feels about life, love, God, hurt and everything else in-between." [...] Jesus Freak Hideout's Bert Gangl said that [...] "What do Keith Urban, the Alan Parsons Project (APP) and the Book of James have in common? The surprising answer to this unlikely question is that all three arguably had some influence on Brandon Heath's latest release, Blue Mountain." [...] To this, Gangl wrote that [...] "Like the APP, whose name during the '70s and '80s was veritably synonymous with what has now become known as the concept album, Blue Mountain is built around the central themes of living and dying." [...] Larry Stephan highlighted that some production was scaled back, and felt that this was [...] "beneficial, however, not universal." [...] Lastly, Stephan told that [...] "Blue Mountain contains a mix of Americana leaning songs and typical CCM type music.", but that [...] "while more of the Americana leaning would have been welcome," [...] he felt that [...] "the album as a whole is still a cut above typical CCM style music." ...|$|E
5000|$|He studied film at the University of Southern California School of Cinema-Television {{where his}} classmates {{included}} George Lucas, Basil Poledouris, Randal Kleiser and Don Glut. Milius {{says he was}} influenced by his teacher, Irwin Blacker:He gave you the screenplay form, which I hated so much, and if you made one mistake on the form, you flunked the class. His attitude was that the least you can learn is the form. [...] "I can’t grade you on the content. I can’t tell you {{whether this is a}} better story for you to write than that, you know? And I can’t teach you how to write the content, but I can certainly demand that you do it in the proper form." [...] He never talked about character arcs or anything like that; he simply talked about telling a good yarn, telling a good story. He said, “Do whatever you need to do. Be as radical and as outrageous as you can be. Take any kind of approach you want to take. Feel free to flash <b>back,</b> <b>feel</b> free to flash forward, feel free to flash back {{in the middle of a}} flashback. Feel free to use narration, all the tools are there for you to use."Milius says his writing style was influenced by two novels in particular, Moby Dick and On the Road:I think Moby Dick is the best work of art ever made ... I used to point out the dramatic entrance of characters, how they were threaded through ... Moby Dick was a perfect screenplay, a perfect example of the kind of drama that I was interested in. Another great influence on me was ... On the Road, which has no tight, linear narrative, but sprawls, following this character. Moby Dick and On the Road are completely different kinds of novels, yet they’re both extremely disciplined. Nothing happens by accident in either of those two books.Milius reflected his [...] "ambitions stopped at B Westerns ... I thought that was a good life. I never wanted to be Hitchcock or some big mogul, I didn't want to be Louis B. Mayer. I wanted to be ... Budd Boetticher or something ... John Ford."His short films at film school included The Reversal of Richard Sun (1966), Glut (1967) and Viking Women Don't Care (1967). He wrote a documentary, The Emperor (1967), directed by classmate George Lucas, who also edited an animated short Milius directed called Marcello I'm So Bored (1967) with John Strawbridge.|$|E
