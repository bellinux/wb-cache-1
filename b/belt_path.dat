40|$|Purpose: Seatbelt {{use during}} {{pregnancy}} {{is important to}} improve maternal and fetal survival after motor vehicle collisions. However, because the rear seatbelt of a motor vehicle tends {{to make contact with}} the neck, even if it is adequately used, some pregnant women sitting in the rear seat opt not to fasten the belt. The {{purpose of this study is}} to explore seatbelt–neck contact for pregnant women sitting in the rear seat of a motor vehicle. Methods: We carried out an anthropometric study. Japanese women who were ≥ 30 weeks pregnant (n =  12) sat in the left side of the rear seat of a typical mid-size passenger sedan and fastened the seatbelt. Seating posture was investigated by measuring the coordinates of the anthropometric data points of the pregnant women (head, shoulder, hip joint, and knee joint). The <b>belt</b> <b>path</b> was analyzed by measuring the clearance between the belt and the sternum or navel. Results: Among the 12 pregnant women at 33. 9 week ±  3. 3 week gestation, the shoulder belt deviated to the right side and subsequently contacted to the neck in four pregnant women (Contact group). The height of the Contact group was significantly shorter than that of Non-contact group (152. 3  cm ±  3. 0  cm vs. 159. 0  cm ±  3. 3  cm, p =  0. 008). Regarding the relative position of the seatbelt to the subject's body, the distances from the top of the sternum to the center of the shoulder belt were significantly shorter in Contact group (3. 9  cm ±  3. 5  cm) than that in the Non-contact group (8. 0  cm ±  1. 6  cm, p =  0. 03). However, no significant difference was found for the distance from the umbilicus to the center of the lap belt. Conclusion: Our findings show that because of short height and late term of pregnancy with protrusion of the abdomen, the shoulder belt deviates to the right or left, avoiding the protruded uterus, and subsequently makes contact with the neck. Seatbelt systems for rear seats need to be developed to improve passenger safety, especially for pregnant women...|$|E
5000|$|The Juneau {{gold belt}} {{comprises}} {{a section of}} the Juneau Mining District, the other sections being Glacier Bay/Mt. Fairweather, the volcanic area of West Lynn Canal/Haines/Porcupine, and the Molybdenite area. The northern part of the belt, the Eagle River region, extends northwestward from Salmon Creek to Berners Bay. It is [...] in length. Throughout the inland portion of the belt, outcrops below the timber line are buried under glacial drift, moss, and vegetation. The belt is characterized as a narrow strip of land lying between salt water and the Coast Range's high diorite peaks. It trends northwest and southeast, following the coast. Gastineau Channel and Lynn Canal form the southwest border while Berners Bay forms a northwest one. Between Lynn Canal and the mountains, whose altitude ranges between 4000 - 6000 ft, there are parallel ridges. The region contains numerous glaciers and several waterways, such as the Montana and Windfall creeks, Windfall Lake at McGinnis Creek, Lemon Creek, Montana Basin, and Auke Lake. The Montana, Windfall, and Cowee creek valleys create a single system along the belt. Larger rivers, like the Eagle, Herbert, and Mendenhall, form gravel valleys following the <b>belt's</b> <b>path.</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{mechanical}} and functional performance of nonwoven fabric critically {{depends on the}} fibre architecture. The fibre laydown process {{plays a key role}} in controlling this architecture. The fibre dynamic behaviour during laydown is studied through a finite element model which describes the role of the parameters in defining the area covered by a single fibre when deposited on the conveyor <b>belt.</b> The <b>path</b> taken by a fibre is described in terms of the radius of gyration, which characterises the area covered by the fibre in the textile, and the spectrum of curvature, which describes the degree of fibre looping as a function of the arc length. Starting from deterministic and idealised fibre curvature spectra, stochastic Monte Carlo simulations are undertaken to generate full nonwoven web samples and reproduce the uniformity of fibre density. A novel image analysis technique that allows measurement of the uniformity of real spunbonded nonwoven samples from images of textiles is used to confirm the validity of the model. It is shown that the main parameter that governs the fibre density uniformity is the ratio of the fibre spinning velocity to the velocity of conveyor belt, while fibre oscillations prior to deposition play a secondary role.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to develop methods for extracting and quantifying sedimentary bodies in 3 D high-resolution seismic data. A case study was used with an exceptionally high-resolution seismic and a large number of wells: the Palaeocene Tambaredjo field in Suriname. A large-scale interactive 3 D visualization system was used to permit interactive exploration of seismic volumes and to make appropriate choices of the processing methods to be used. The different output volumes provided important information on the overall lithofacies distributions and were used as input for clustering and supervised classification using Artificial Neural Networks. Extracted objects could be interpreted as typical fluvial objects indicating the mostly fluvial nature of these deposits. Tectonic deformation of the layers and erosion perturbed the image segmentation task. A new seismic volume was created wherein these deformations are reversed. This resulting GeoTime volume represents geological time slices, and facilitates the tracking of geological bodies. In order to find appropriate ways of parameterising the extracted bodies, the architecture of actual rivers was studied from images of meandering river <b>belts.</b> Rivers' <b>path</b> was modelled using a cubic spline through a set of control points. Point bars were modelled using two circle segments along the first and last accretion surface. Parameters such as accretion axis, alignment of the point bars, and average drainage trend were calculated. These parameters can be used for modelling of fluvial system and also for similar systems, but obviously a larger database has to be developed for a more universal application.

40|$|Possible {{connections}} between the physical properties of Near-Earth Asteroids and their orbital evolution was explored, with emphasis on binary asteroids. The main hypothesis, suggested from the observations, is that the Near-Earth population contains considerably higher percent of binaries compared to the Main <b>Belt.</b> Typical evolution <b>paths</b> for different types (in sense of physical properties) of binary Near-Earth Asteroids were also explored, {{as well as the}} distribution of these types among different areas in the space of orbital elements. The simulation covered simultaneously both orbital evolution and evolution of physical properties, which is the main improvement in comparison to the previous researches of this kind. Orbital integration was performed with a second-order symplectic integrator based on the classical concept of mixed variables (MVS) and optimized for close approaches. Physical evolution due to tidal forces and collision/disruption events were described with TREESPH hydrocode, which combines N-body integration and Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics equations. The results show typical evolution paths of some Near-Earth Asteroids: contact binaries, separated binaries, asteroids with a satellite, fast rotators. Slow rotators (like 4179 Toutatis) have not been detected. Possible explanation s lie in specific (possibly cometary) cosmogonic origin of these objects and strong non-gravitational influences but other explanations also cannot be written off. Of course, larger ensemble and longer interval of integration would make the results of this simulation more certain...|$|R
40|$|The Compton Observatory {{commonly}} encounters fluxes of energetic electrons {{which have}} been scattered from the inner radiation <b>belt</b> to the <b>path</b> of the satellite by resonant interactions with VLF waves from powerful man-made transmitters. The present investigation was motivated {{by the fact that}} in the Fall of 1993, the Gamma Ray Observatory was boosted from a 650 km altitude circular orbit to a 750 km altitude circular orbit. This was an opportunity, for the first time, to make observations at two different altitudes using the same instrument. We have examined DISCLA data from the Burst & Transient Source Experiment (BATSE) experiment from 1 Sep. 1993 to 29 Jan. 1994. During the period of study we identified 48 instances of the satellite encountering a cloud of energetic electrons which had been scattered by VLF transmitters. We find that boosting the altitude of the circular orbit from 650 km to 750 km increased the intensity of cyclotron resonance scattered electrons by a factor of two. To search for long term changes in the cyclotron resonance precipitation, we have compared the approx. 750 km altitude data from 106 days at the end of 1993 with data at the same altitudes and time of year in 1991. The cyclotron resonance events in 1991 were three times more frequent and 25 % of those cases were more intense than any seen in the 1993 data. We attribute this difference to increased level of geomagnetic activity in 1991 near the Solar Maximum...|$|R

Earthquakes {{frequently}} hit Indonesia, many caused {{thousands of}} casualties and damage to buildings. Earthquakes often occur because Indonesia was in two {{regions of the}} Pacific seismic lines (circum-Pacific Earthquake <b>Belt)</b> and the <b>path</b> of asia earthquake (Trans Asiatic Earthquake Belt). The earthquake caused damage to building structures. When an earthquake happens, the building {{is expected to be}} able to accept a certain level of earthquake forces without any significant damage to the structure. In general, seismic analysis is divided into two major parts namely the earthquake analysis of static and dynamic earthquake analysis. In buildings that are very high, irregular, and the multistory buildings that require a very large used precision planning of dynamic analysis, which consists of the analysis range of the response spectrum and time history dynamic response analysis. This study aims to determine the safety of the building seen from the displacement, drift and shear bash. The method used is the dynamic response spectrum analysis using ETABS program. Maximum total drift in the X direction is 0. 00825 m and the Y direction is 0. 00588 m, so the building is safe against the ultimate limit of performance (0. 02 h) and serviceability limit the performance of (0. 03 / R) xh. Value of displacement in the X direction is 0. 06941 m and the Y direction is 0. 05274 m, so the displacement at the building does not exceed the maximum displacement, so that the building is safe against earthquake plan.

40|$|This report {{documents}} a {{study of}} how CRS features, labels, and instructions contribute to CRS installation errors. Task 1 A focused on assessing different physical features of 16 convertible CRS, while Task 1 B evaluated baseline and modified versions of labels and instructions for two CRS models. For each phase of testing, 32 subjects were recruited based on their education level (high or low) and experience with installing CRS (none or experienced). Each subject was asked to perform four child restraint installations in a 2006 Pontiac G 6 sedan. An 18 -month-old CRABI anthropometric test device (ATD) weighing 25 lb was used for all installations. Each subject installed two CRS forward-facing (FF), one with LATCH and one with seatbelt, and two CRS rear-facing (RF), one with LATCH and one with the seatbelt. For Task 1 A, each subject installed four of the sixteen convertible CRS. For Task 1 B, each subject installed a Graco ComfortSport and Evenflo Titan twice, where each CRS had one of eight alternate instruction manuals and one of eight alternate label conditions. After each installation, the experimenter evaluated 42 factors for each installation, such as choice of <b>belt</b> routing <b>path,</b> tightness of installation, and harness snugness. Analyses used linear mixed models to identify CRS installation outcomes associated with CRS features or label/ instruction type. LATCH connector type, LATCH belt adjustor type, {{and the presence of}} belt lockoffs are associated with the tightness of the CRS installation. The type of harness shoulder height adjuster is associated with the rate of achieving a snug harness. Correct tether use is associated with the tether storage method. In general, subject assessments of the ease of use of CRS features are not highly correlated with the quality of their installation, suggesting a need for feedback with incorrect installations. The results of testing alternative labels and instructions indicate that no alternative condition significantly improved CRS installation compared to baseline conditions across all potential installation errors that were evaluated. An unintended consequence of using “combined” labels (incorporating all of the variations recommended by human factors experts that were tested individually in other conditions) is that subjects were less likely to use the CRS manual. The most promising alternative manual is a video version. Neither the labels nor manuals with improved graphics showed substantial benefit compared to baseline, even though graphics-based manuals and labels score well using the ISO and NHTSA ease-of-use rating system. The effects of varying labels and manuals on installation error are small compared to the effects of different CRS designs. The data from this study provide quantitative assessments of some CRS features that are associated with reductions in CRS installation errors. This information can be used to update the NHTSA CRS ease-of-use rating system to account for recently developed CRS features. Based on human factors recommendations, suggestions are made for assessing “clear” labels and instructions and modifying FMVSS 213 requirements to facilitate clearer labels and instructions...|$|R

Earthquake mitigation are steps that have to be taken to reduce loss of life and property, by design of earthquakeresistant structures that have high ductility. One of the way to improve the ductility is the restraint of reinforced concrete elements. The collapse of the structural column is very significant in terms of economic and human safety, therefore it is necessary to design the bottom of the column design to achieve high ductility. This study aims to determine the effect of the use of ring of steel as external confinement on the compressive strength, modulus of elasticity and strain of concrete and steel ring. If a is the width of the steel ring and b is the distance between the rings, then with a variety of ratios a / b on a wide range of constant and b is a constant, it will get the optimum value of the ratio a/b. Specimens are concrete cylinders with 30 cm high and 15 cm diameter. At the constant a of 40 cm used a variation b of 90, 47, and 25 cm with ratio of a/b is 0. 444; 0. 857 and 1. 6 respectively. In the constant b of 40 cm used a variation of 73, 45, and 28 cm with ratio of a/b is 1. 833; 1. 125 and 0. 7 respectively. The larger ratio of a/b get the higher compressive strength of concrete. The increase in compressive strength of concrete for the variation ratio of a/b 40 / 90 (0. 444), 40 / 47 (0. 851), and 40 / 25 (1. 600) respectively is 97. 368...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{years have}} seen rapid growth in {{ultrasound}} imaging. Usual transducers for real-time scanner typically contain over 300 crystals where each emits and receives an ultrasound beam in rapid succession to form a sweep. The transducer is included in modern ultrasound equipments which are heavy and bulky, hence not suitable to be integrated in wearable systems. The challenging research activity we endeavored to perform is to realize a wearable, portable and automatic ultrasound [1] system integrated with breath and heart apex pulse system detector, which does not require human contribution in positioning and directing the acoustic wave. The novelty is the bi-modal use of the transducer, which, in addition to actively transmit and receive ultrasound signals for detecting heart wall movements, can behave as passive sensor at low frequency and acquire cardiac sound, breathing signal and heart beat-rate. A suitable electronic switching system allows changing from one modality to the other one. In order to assure the bi-modality, the transducer, made of piezoelectric material (PVDF), should have a low Q factor [2]. Q factor {{is defined as the}} ratio between the centre frequency (resonant frequency) and bandwidth, therefore a low value implies a broader working frequency range. The system is based on a textile band containing the transducer, which is connected to an electronic board inserted into a <b>belt</b> through electric <b>paths,</b> realized on a textile substrate. The same transducer excited at high frequency to generate an ultrasound echo, it is also used to acquire cardiac acoustic and breathing signals at low frequency. The system checks the subject status through the low frequency analysis, and when an anomalous event occurs in every part of the signals (shape, frequency etc.) it activates the ultrasound system to emit an impulse train that analyzes the mechanical heart wall movement. A simultaneous ECG signal is acquired to provide the interlock signal in the ultrasound investigation. Moreover it provides information about the electric behavior of the heart and can enrich the clinical picture of the cardiac activity in addition to the signals acquired by the ultrasound transducer. A single signal comprising breath and heart apex pulse is acquired by a charge amplifier. High frequency investigation has shown the movement of the heart wall in terms of spatial length expressed in centimeters. The accuracy of these results (Fig. 1) depends on how good the transducer adheres to the thoracic wall {{as well as on the}} high sampling frequency, and the algorithm implemented to localize the return echo. Nonetheless, several issues should be more deeply addressed. As the system should be wearable and used for a long time, the relative body-transducer displacement as well as skin-electrode mismatch are crucial aspects. Skin transducer or skin-electrode interfaces, indeed, should have a good electric coupling and, at the same time, should be comfortable for the subject wearing the system. As the system is thought to be used by a subject while he is doing usual daily actions, motion body can produce significant artefacts in the mechanical coupling and materials used...|$|R
