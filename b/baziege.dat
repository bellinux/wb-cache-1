50|$|<b>Baziège</b> is a commune in the Haute-Garonne {{department}} in southwestern France.|$|E
50|$|Some Roman remains {{can be seen}} in Labège; but in Roman times {{no actual}} village existed here, only a few {{scattered}} homes along the thoroughfare between <b>Baziège</b> and Toulouse. Even in the Middle Ages, the settlement was sparse. Fourteenth century documents mention a Labège manor, which was owned by the College of Saint Front de Périgord for the next four centuries, but only {{toward the end of the}} Renaissance did the village proper begin to take shape around the parish church.|$|E
