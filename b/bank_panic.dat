The interrelated contraction, <b>bank</b> <b>panic</b> and falling stock market resulted in significant economic disruption. Industrial production dropped further than after any previous bank run, while 1907 saw the second-highest volume of bankruptcies to that date. Production fell by 11%, imports by 26%, while unemployment rose to 8% from under 3%. Immigration dropped to 750,000 people in 1909, from 1.2 million two years earlier.|$|E
25|$|Street and {{his wife}} Narcissa Vanderlip were from wealthy families. She was the {{daughter}} of Frank and Narcissa Cox Vanderlip, who lived at Beechwood in Briarcliff Manor; Vanderlip was the president of the National City Bank from 1909 to 1919. Narcissa Vanderlip attended the Scarborough School, graduated from Vassar College in 1925, and {{was a member of the}} Junior League; while her husband, Julian Street Jr., graduated from Princeton University in 1925 where he was the editorial chairman for The Daily Princetonian—by 1925, he was on the staff of The New York Herald Tribune. Julian Street Jr. was the son of notable author Julian Street, who wrote such works as Abroad at Home (1914), Mysterious Japan (1921), Rita Coventry (1922), and Where Paris Dines (1929). Street Jr. was working as a scriptwriter for NBC, where he adapted Booth Tarkington's Penrod for broadcasting, the first popular book to be formatted for broadcast purposes. Both Narcissa and Julian Street Jr. were the children of wealthy Gilded Age American families, and it was not surprising that they later married. Their parents were connected, as Frank Vanderlip, Narcissa's father, knew Julian Street Jr.'s father since the <b>Bank</b> <b>Panic</b> of 1907, when Frank helped Street keep his money safe with National City Bank. The Streets were married in April 1927 in a lavish ceremony at the New Church, a Georgian building on 35th Street in New York City; at their reception, held at the Colony Club, more than 1,500 guests attended, including Goulds, Vanderbilts and Roosevelts. After their marriage, Edward Walker Harden, a Briarcliff Manor estate owner and longtime friend of Frank Vanderlip, gave land on the east side of Sleepy Hollow Road in Briarcliff Manor to the Streets. The Streets, however, preferred the land that was already owned by the Vanderlips on Long Hill Road West, which was more private and secluded, so they sold the land given by Harden. According to a map from October 6, 1937, Street's mother-in-law owned the land on which the Streets' new house, designed by Wallace K. Harrison, was built.|$|E

40|$|The views {{expressed}} in this working paper {{are those of the}} authors and not necessarily Around the turn of the previous century <b>banking</b> <b>panics</b> in the U.

40|$|This note {{provides}} an example of an optimal <b>banking</b> <b>panic.</b> We construct a model in which a <b>banking</b> <b>panic</b> is triggered by the banker, not the depositors. When the banker receives a pessimistic information on the return on the bank’s assets, he liquidates them prematurely in order to protect his capital. In the face of this liquidation, all depositors withdraw their funds prematurely. The premature liquidation of the bank’s assets strengthens the bank’s balance sheet. As a result, the <b>banking</b> <b>panic</b> does not cause bank failure and the government should not try to prevent the panic. Such a panic occured in 1857 in the United States.

40|$|The “shadow banking system, ” at {{the heart}} of the current credit crisis is, in fact, a real banking system – and is {{vulnerable}} to a <b>banking</b> <b>panic.</b> Indeed, the events starting in August 2007 are a <b>banking</b> <b>panic.</b> A <b>banking</b> <b>panic</b> is a systemic event because the banking system cannot honor its obligations and is insolvent. Unlike the historical <b>banking</b> <b>panics</b> of the 19 th and early 20 th centuries, the current <b>banking</b> <b>panic</b> is a wholesale panic, not a retail panic. In the earlier episodes, depositors ran to their banks and demanded cash in exchange for their checking accounts. Unable to meet those demands, the banking system became insolvent. The current panic involved financial firms “running ” on other financial firms by not renewing sale and repurchase agreements (repo) or increasing the repo margin (“haircut”), forcing massive deleveraging, and resulting in the banking system being insolvent. The earlier episodes have many features in common with the current crisis, and examination of history can help understand the current situation and guide thoughts about reform of bank regulation. New regulation can facilitate the functioning of the shadow banking system, making it less vulnerable to panic. + This paper draws on a number of current research projects with several coauthors.

50|$|Panic is a 1935 verse play by Archibald MacLeish. A {{tragedy that}} is one of the author's least-known works, it was written during the sixth year of the Great Depression.

First presented March 14-16, 1935, at the Imperial Theatre in Manhattan, the production featured Orson Welles's first leading performance on the American stage.

Sets and lighting were designed by Jo Mielziner; Martha Graham directed the movements of the chorus.|$|E
50|$|Most industrialized {{countries}} {{have had a}} lender of last resort for many years. Why it is done {{can be explained by}} different models. The various models propose that a bank run or <b>bank</b> <b>panic</b> can arise in any fractional reserve banking system and that the lender of last resort function is a way of preventing panics from happening. The Diamond and Dybvig model of bank runs has two Nash equilibria: one in which welfare is optimal and one where there is a bank run. The bank run equilibrium is an infamously self-fulfilling prophecy: if individuals expect a run to happen, it is rational for them to withdraw their deposits early: before they actually need it. That makes them lose some interest, but that is better than losing everything from a bank run.|$|E
