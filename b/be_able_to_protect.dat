5|$|Owing {{to their}} poor {{performance}} and slow speed, the Zara-class cruisers {{did not see}} significant service with the fleet. They were too slow {{to be used as}} fleet scouts or flotilla leaders, and their gun armament was too weak for them to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> torpedo boats from torpedo-boat destroyers. As a result, they spent most of the 1880s and 1890s , being reactivated briefly for training exercises. Sebenico returned to active service in 1893, alternating between sea duty with the training squadron and harbor service as a training ship for engine-room personnel. In 1897, Spalato became assigned to the artillery school, while Zara was recommissioned for use in the torpedo school. That year, Sebenico took part in the only significant period of fleet service, when she was sent to the island of Crete to participate in an international naval demonstration during Greco-Turkish War. During the blockade, Sebenico stopped and sank a Greek vessel trying to break the blockade. Sebenico served in a variety of auxiliary roles over the following five years, before joining Spalato in the artillery school in 1903; the three ships served in their training roles until the outbreak of World War I in July 1914, at which point they became guard ships.|$|E

In a defensive building he would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> himself against any revolution by the masses from nearby Manchester or Liverpool.

500|$|The {{following}} {{season the}} two goaltenders formed the best duo in the NHL. The duo remained together even after Vanbiesbrouck {{had a chance}} to leave via free agency in 1992. A new collective bargaining agreement established him as a group 2 free agent, allowing the Rangers to match any offer from another team or to claim draft choices as compensation if he were to sign with another team. After not receiving much interest from other clubs, Vanbiesbrouck re-signed with the Rangers, signing a two-year deal with an option for the third averaging $1 million per season.

These names have a number of variants, which can be with or without h, with v instead of h, with or without the ending ć, and with č instead of ć. According to philologist Franz Miklosich, the Serbian word stuhać is cognate with the Old Slavonic stuhia (...) or stihia (...) [...] "the elements", which stem from the Old Greek stoicheion (στοιχεῖον) [...] "element". The latter name is the origin of the Modern Greek stikhio (στοιχειό), denoting various kinds of spirits in Greek folklore, such as those fighting for the well-being of their village or area against adverse spirits from elsewhere. According to linguists Petar Skok and Norbert Jokl, stuhać stems from the Albanian stuhi [...] "storm". In any case, the form zduhać may have resulted from folk etymology through association with the Serbian duh [...] "spirit".|$|E

In addition to her father's guidance, she was inspired by other traditional artists including Oum Kalthoum, Abdel Halim Hafez, Fairouz, Dimi and Sabah. As she matured, she increasingly became interested in blues music, which appealed to her as it bore a resemblance to the traditional music she knew. Malouma wrote her first song, [...] "Habibi Habeytou" [...] (My beloved, I loved him) when she was sixteen. It was a song protesting the tradition of men turning their wives {{out of their homes}} to marry younger women. It brought her instant recognition, but created a backlash, causing physical attacks from the established Muslim community. Soon after she wrote it, her family moved to Nouakchott, the capital, to help her launch her music career, but in the strongly traditional society, Malouma was forced to marry, abandoning singing until the late 1980s. She was later accused by her father of ruining his reputation. In addition to the criticisms stemming from her songs, she had disgraced her family by divorcing twice: her first husband had been forced upon her, while the second came from a noble family, who would not allow her to sing.
