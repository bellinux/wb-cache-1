The following year (1962), RMIT bought a lithography press. King {{was one of the}} few able to use it. From then on King concentrated on producing lithographs and creative monotypes. In 1965, he acquired a small off-set litho press (12 ins x 15 ins or about 30.5 x 38.1cm) for his studio at Warrandyte. Although this press was “a <b>bit</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> small side”, by designing for its limitations King could make larger prints. Some years later, he acquired a larger press which “gave him scope to wield a longer, wider brush-mark on the lithographic plate”.|$|E

40|$|The conjectured {{hardness}} of Boolean matrix-vector multiplication {{has been}} used with great success to prove conditional lower bounds for numerous important data structure problems, see Henzinger et al. [STOC' 15]. In recent work, Larsen and Williams [SODA' 17] attacked the problem from the upper bound side and gave a surprising cell probe data structure (that is, we only charge for memory accesses, while computation is free). Their cell probe data structure answers queries in Õ(n^ 7 / 4) time and is succinct {{in the sense that}} it stores the input matrix in read-only memory, plus an additional Õ(n^ 7 / 4) <b>bits</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> side. In this paper, we essentially settle the cell probe complexity of succinct Boolean matrix-vector multiplication. We present a new cell probe data structure with query time Õ(n^ 3 / 2) storing just Õ(n^ 3 / 2) <b>bits</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> side. We then complement our data structure with a lower bound showing that any data structure storing r <b>bits</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> side, with n < r < n^ 2 must have query time t satisfying t r = Ω̃(n^ 3). For r ≤ n, any data structure must have t = Ω̃(n^ 2). Since lower bounds in the cell probe model also apply to classic word-RAM data structures, the lower bounds naturally carry over. We also prove similar lower bounds for matrix-vector multiplication over F_ 2...|$|R

Yes Wellard the dog is Barker, a cop on the edge with a drink problem and distemper." [...] For Red Nose Day 2007, Aardman Animations created a Creature Comforts-style short featuring Wellard asking for money for Comic Relief, along with selling his offspring and being put in prison.

The 3D accelerated graphics, specifically the tables, the cards and the dealers' hands, are well modeled and lit, and the playing chips are beautiful.

However, he noted that [...] "some of the 3D effects are not particularly wieldy, the menus flicker, it's often hard to stop the scrolling menus at the right time, and the camera angles switch too fast and frequently {{to be anything but}} distracting.
