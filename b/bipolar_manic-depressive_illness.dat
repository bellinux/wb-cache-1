40|$|Schizoaffective illness {{has either}} {{been linked to}} {{schizophrenia}} and to affective disorders, or it has been considered to be as separate entity. Family and linkage studies can provide data regarding genetic factors in the aetiology of schizoaffective illness. Morbidity risks for affective illnesses and schizophrenia were estimated in the first-degree relatives of schizoaffective probands as compared to matched controls (bipolars, unipolars and schizophrenics). Linkage studies with X-chromosome markers (protanopia and deuteranopia) were also performed in informative families. Our genetic results indicate that schizoaffective illness is a heterogeneous entity. This syndrome appears to be primarily related to the affective disorders, {{but there may be}} a subgroup linked to the schizophrenic spectrum disorders. Our studies also indicate that some schizoaffective syndromes may be transmitted through the X-chromosome, a pattern previously demonstrated in some families with <b>bipolar</b> <b>manic-depressive</b> <b>illness.</b> Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.

40|$|As {{with most}} complex {{inheritance}} diseases, {{there are at}} this time no identified susceptibility genes for schizophre-nia, <b>bipolar</b> <b>manic-depressive</b> <b>illness,</b> major depression, childhood autism, and other inherited brain disorders whose manifestations are primarily behavioral. Nonethe-less, progress has occurred. Genetic epidemiologic re-search, based on reliable phenotypic definitions, has demonstrated the heritability {{of many of these}} disorders. Genetic linkages and associations have been reported and replicated, although there have been inconsistencies be-tween studies, apparently due to the low statistical power of the samples studied to detect small effects genes. Nonreplications of early linkage reports in manic-depres-sive illness in the 1980 s occurred when new cases devel-oped in the same large families in which the linkage was originally reported, and the newly ill persons had the wrong genetic markers in the linkage region. This appears to have resulted from applying inappropriate analytic assumptions of single-gene dominant inheritance of a rare gene, which implied that new cases must arise from the same ancestral gene within the pedigree. When new cases arose in family members not sharing that chromosomal region, the initial linkage report was proved invalid. Under oligogenic inheritance, on the other hand, suscep-tibility genes are expected to be common, and have a substantial probability of being brought into the pedigree by persons marrying in. Nonspecific psychopathology genes may exist, shared by schizophrenia and bipolar illness, diagnoses which do not co-aggregate in families. The discovery of susceptibility mutations may be expected...|$|E
40|$|The author {{investigated}} the heredity of manic-depressive syndromes, {{in particular to}} test the hypothesis of a dominant X-linked transmission in these disorders. The Maximum Likelihood Estimate method was applied to linkage analysis between several X-linked genetic markers and <b>bipolar</b> <b>manic-depressive</b> <b>illness,</b> as well as to a control population of unipolar depressive patients. The genetic markers studied were deuteranopia and protanopia (two X-linked recessive markers) and the Xg blood group (X-linked dominant marker). The sampling methods were identical for both groups of patients and the family studies were performed 'blind' (i. e. without knowledge of the proband's diagnosis). The results demonstrate the presence of strong linkage between manic-depressive (bipolar) illness, deuteranopia and protanopia. Linkage (although less strong) was also shown for bipolar illness and the Xg blood group. The genetic data are is on mathematical analysis of 36 informative kindreds ascertained from a sample of 134 manic-depressive patients. The results are concordant and demonstrate that, in this sample, manic-depressive (bipolar) psychosis is genetically transmitted through an X-linked dominant factor. The author also demonstrates the absence of linkage between unipolar depressive illness and the studied genetic markers in 16 informative kindreds ascertained from a sample of 71 unipolar patients. The genetic analyses described in this study demonstrate the existence of a manic-depressive syndrome in which the phenotype is dominant and determined by a gene located on the short arm of the X chromosome. Apart from some forms of mental deficiency, manic-depressive psychosis represents the first known instance of a mendelian heredity mechanism in psychiatric disorder.

30|$|Lithium (Li) is a toxic {{monovalent}} alkaline metal. It occurs {{naturally in}} all soils, surface and drinking water. Moreover, it accumulates in marine animals, algae and vegetables which represent the primary dietary Li sources and may contribute from 66 % to 90 % {{of the total}} Li intake (Curran and Ravindran 2014; McCartney et al. 2014).

40|$|<b>Bipolar</b> {{disorder}}, or <b>manic-depressive</b> <b>illness,</b> is a mood {{disorder in}} which episodes of mania, hypomania and depression occur in alternation with intervals of normal mood. Bipolar disorder is typically a recurrent illness {{and may have}} serious consequences such as poor social and occupational functioning, impaired quality of life, hazardous behaviour that may be destructive to patients and their relatives, and {{a high rate of}} suicide. In addition to the fact that current treatment options are only partially effective in many cases, the treatment of patients with bipolar disorder is problematic due to a number of other factors: a delay in help-seeking by patients, underdiagnosing mood disorder in general practice and mental health care, and misdiagnosis of bipolar disorder as unipolar depressive disorder. Indeed, many studies have reported long delays between the onset of first symptoms of the illness and receiving the correct diagnosis and treatment. The majority of these studies were done in clinical samples, which means that the patients included suffered from a more severe form of bipolar disorder and had sought treatment Hence, {{little is known about the}} effect of the above mentioned factors in patients in the general population, and consequently little is known of factors influencing help-seeking and receiving adequate treatment. Another point of interest is that the current concept of bipolar disorder is mainly based on studies in clinical samples, and one can question whether this reflects the true nature of mood disorder and encompasses what is often called the bipolar spectrum. Research in the general population offers a unique opportunity to study a wider range of expressions of mood disorder, its consequences, diagnostic process and treatment history in a naturalistic setting not influenced and biased by help-seeking behaviour. In this thesis we report on four studies into the nature, prevalence and consequences of bipolar spectrum disorder as well as a study into factors influencing help-seeking and receiving treatment in the Dutch general population. ...|$|R

Their clinical characteristics correspond to those of classical <b>manic-depressive</b> <b>illness,</b> including an episodic course, positive family history, and the absence of comorbidity.

40|$|The symptoms, classification, {{occurrence}} {{and possible}} aetiologies of <b>bipolar</b> <b>manic-depressive</b> psychosis have been reviewed, with {{particular emphasis on}} the possible role of the vanadate ion (V 5 +) and cation transport in the illness.

40|$|Over {{a century}} ago, Emil Kraepelin divided “endogenous psychoses ” into two {{separate}} disease categories—dementia praecox (schizophrenia) and manicdepressive illness (bipolar disorder and recurring unipolar disorder) (1).

5000|$|In the 1899 (6th) {{edition of}} Psychiatrie, Kraepelin {{established}} a paradigm for psychiatry that would dominate the following century, sorting {{most of the}} recognized forms of insanity into two major categories: dementia praecox and <b>manic-depressive</b> <b>illness.</b> Dementia praecox was characterized by disordered intellectual functioning, whereas <b>manic-depressive</b> <b>illness</b> was principally a disorder of affect or mood; and the former featured constant deterioration, virtually no recoveries and a poor outcome, while the latter featured periods of exacerbation followed by periods of remission, and many complete recoveries.
