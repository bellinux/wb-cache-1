An alternative alloy and processing concept has been studied to evaluate the feasibility of producing low-carbon medium-manganese TRIP Steels.

40|$|Abstract: The {{recrystallization}} of hot-rolled aluminum strips was monitored inline after inline annealing at Commonwealth Aluminum Corporation (CAC) using laser-ultrasonics. The noncontact measurement {{is based}} on sensing {{the ratio of the}} compressional to the shear sound velocity in the strip thickness direction. This ratio is insensitive to strip thickness variations and varies with crystallographic texture and temperature. Therefore, recrystallization is sensed as a change of texture, from a rolling to an annealing texture. A pyrometer is used to decouple temperature and texture effects on the velocity ratio. The measurements were made on two alloys: AA 5754 and AA 5052. The capabilities and limitations of the sensor are discussed. Introduction: Aluminum sheets are often made by melting scrap aluminum, adjusting the chemistry, casting using a twin belt caster, hot rolling, cooling, <b>batch</b> <b>annealing,</b> and cold rolling.

40|$|The ‘edge defect’ is {{a band of}} low {{reflectivity}} {{that occurs}} {{near the edge of}} <b>batch</b> <b>annealed</b> steels that have been tinplated. The tinplate product that contains this defect must be scrapped because of the poor aesthetical properties and the reduced corrosion resistance in the affected areas. This defect was known to be caused by surface precipitates formed during <b>batch</b> <b>annealing</b> of the steel strip substrate. This research aims to identify the surface precipitates and the factors that can be modified to reduce their formation in an effort to develop an alloying and/or processing strategy which eliminates the occurrence of the ‘edge defect’. In this investigation the ‘edge defect’ was characterised using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) which demonstrated that surface MnCr 2 O 4 spinel precipitates were responsible for the ‘edge defect’ although two different oxides, (MnFe) O and MnCr 2 O 4 spinel, were observed on the steel surface. The formation of the surface (MnFe) O and MnCr 2 O 4 spinel was due to the selective oxidation of manganese and chromium during <b>batch</b> <b>annealing.</b> The effects of manganese, chromium and annealing temperature on selective oxidation were also investigated and {{it was found that the}} MnCr 2 O 4 spinel precipitate size and distribution were directly affected by the content of the chromium in the steels. The higher the chromium content of the steel the coarser the surface MnCr 2 O 4 spinel particles. The annealing temperature has a similar effect on the average size of the MnCr 2 O 4 spinel. Within the range of this investigation the higher the annealing temperature the coarser the surface particle size. The surface precipitates across the width of industrial <b>batch</b> <b>annealed</b> steel strip were characterised using SEM and TEM which established that the diameter of the surface oxide precipitates decreased from the edge to the centre of the steel strip. However, for the steel strip which exhibits the ‘edge defect’ the maximum size of the surface precipitates does not occur at the edge, rather about 20 - 100 mm from the edge. This has been interpreted as the result of the transition of internal selective oxidation to external selective oxidation suggesting that the steel sheet’s exhibiting the ‘edge defect’ are exposed to relatively higher oxygen potentials. This investigation has identified that lowering the annealing temperature, reducing the chromium level in the steel and reducing the oxygen potential of the annealing environment will reduce the formation of the MnCr 2 O 4 spinel. Therefore the ‘edge defect’ may be reduced by modifying these parameters during tinplate production. The minimisation of this defect will reduce production costs and improve product consistency for tinplate production...|$|R
40|$|To gain a {{fundamental}} {{understanding of the}} factors responsible for the kinetics of <b>annealing</b> behavior during <b>batch</b> <b>annealing</b> for {{high strength low alloy}} (HSLA) steels, studies have been conducted to analyze the influence of alloy composition, hot band state, cold rolling reduction (CR%), heating rate, soaking temperature and time, etc. on the annealing behavior of HSLA steels during <b>batch</b> <b>annealing</b> process. The recrystallization kinetics was mainly controlled by several key parameters such as stored energy, precipitation and/or solute drag, special grain boundaries, and texture, etc. The combination of Electron Back-Scattered Diffraction (EBSD) technique and the Sub-grain Method was used to construct and analyze stored energy distribution maps before and during the <b>batch</b> <b>annealing</b> process of cold rolled HSLA steels. Precipitation behavior was studied using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), and High Resolution TEM (TEM). Grain boundary characteristic and texture fibers were also analyzed using EBSD scanning data. The results show that different composition and processing parameters would cause different hot band microstructure and different amounts of dislocation density, i. e., stored energy, remained in the alloys after hot rolling deformation. Higher dislocation density in the hot band steel will cause even higher dislocation density in the sheet steel after cold rolling deformation, which will cause higher recrystallization speed at early stages. If precipitates were formed during annealing, their formation would consume part of the stored energy and decreased some driving force. The new formed fine TiC precipitates would also apply certain pinning force on the grain boundaries, which dragged the moving of those boundaries, i. e., lowered the recrystallization speed further. Certain special grain boundaries like Coincident Site Lattice (CSL) boundaries have very low boundary energy and mobility. The higher volume fraction of this kind of boundaries would also slow down the recrystallization process. Texture could not be a critical factor causing the different annealing behavior in this study, since the texture fibers distributions are very similar. Two or more factors might affect the annealing process at the same time. Some factors could be more efficient than others at certain stage or stages...|$|R

The problem is to select steel coils from a set of waiting coils to form <b>batches</b> to be <b>annealed</b> in available <b>batch</b> <b>annealing</b> furnaces and choose a median coil for each furnace. The objective is to maximize the total reward of the selected coils less the total coil'coil and coil'furnace mismatching cost. For a special case of the problem that arises frequently in practical settings where the coils are all similar and {{there is only one}} type of furnace available, we develop a polynomial-time dynamic programming algorithm to obtain an optimal solution. For the general case of the problem, which is strongly NP-hard, an exact branch-and-price-and-cut solution algorithm is developed using a column and row generation framework. A variable reduction strategy is also proposed to accelerate the algorithm. The algorithm is capable of solving medium-size instances to optimality within a reasonable computation time. In addition, a tabu search heuristic is proposed for solving larger instances. Three simple search neighborhoods, as well as a sophisticated variable-depth neighborhood, are developed. This heuristic can generate near-optimal solutions for large instances within a short computation time. Using both randomly generated and real-world production data sets, we show that our algorithms are superior to the typical rule-based planning approach used by many steel plants. A decision support system that embeds our algorithms was developed and implemented at Baosteel to replace their rule-based planning method. The use of the system brings significant benefits to Baosteel, including an annual net profit increase of at least 1. 76 million U.

Many direct or indirect measurement and calculation methods have been used to evaluate the amount and distribution of the stored energy in the past decades. The advent of relatively new analytical techniques such as Electron Back-Scattered Diffraction (EBSD) has permitted the development of mathematical models such as Sub-grain Method, Image Quality (IQ) Method and Taylor Factor Method etc., these new techniques have permitted a much better understanding of the annealing behavior of cold rolled steels.

Orientation dependent stored energy distribution maps at different annealing stages have been constructed and analyzed. The results of this study show that the stored energy increases with cold rolling reduction ratio and its distribution through the thickness of the steel sample is not uniform due to the inherit inhomogeneous deformation process. The stored energy was continuously consumed during annealing.

In the first, an attempt {{is made to}} simulate BCC rolling textures by including a conditional deformation banding criterion modeled in a Taylor/Chin framework. The model is then run backwards to find {{the origins of the}} a and γ fibers. The practical importance of this work is to produce an ideal deformation texture from which {{it might be possible to}} maximise the development of { 111 } and to minimise { 100 } during rolling, since it is well known that { 111 } recrystallized components are associated with the γ fibre. The second investigation is concerned with the origins of the { 111 } texture in a <b>batch</b> <b>annealing</b> steel. It is demonstrated that the γ fibre grains are heavily shear banded, and the nucleation of { 111 } grains occurs in these bands. The shear band material is a ND-rotated { 111 } component. Clearly, the condition leading to extreme strain localisation is determined by both the slip geometry and the solute/precipitate state.

Before growths, Au thin films with different thicknesses (namely, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, and 5 nm, respectively) were deposited onto three batches of GaAs (111)B substrates using an electron beam evaporator under high vacuum (< 4 × 10 − 6 Torr). The thickness of the Au film is measured by a carefully calibrated single-crystal sensor in the evaporator chamber.

The work involved mathematical modelling of patterns of gas flow and modes of heat transfer. These models are: Heat conduction and its conjectures in the steel coils;Convective heat transfer in the plates separating the coils in the stack and {{in other parts of the}} furnace; and Radiative and convective heat transfer in the furnace by using the long furnace model. An important part of the project is the development of numerical methods and computations to solve the transient models. A limited number of temperature measurements was available from experiments on a test coil in an industrial furnace. The mathematical model agreed well with these data. The model has been used to show the following characteristics of annealing furnaces, and to suggest further developments which would lead to significant savings: - The location of the limiting temperature in a coil is nearer to the hollow core than to the outer periphery. - Thermal expansion of the steel tends to open the coils, reduces their thermal conductivity in the radial direction, and hence prolongs the annealing cycle. Increasing the tension in the coils and/or heating from the core would overcome this heat transfer resistance. - The shape and dimensions of the convective channels in the plates have significant effect on heat convection in the stack. An optimal design of a channel is shown to be of a width-to-height ratio equal to 9. - Increasing the cooling rate, by using a fluidized bed instead of the normal shell and tube exchanger, would shorten the cooling time by about 15 %, but increase the temperature differential in the stack. - For a specific charge weight, a stack of different-sized coils will have a shorter annealing cycle than one of equally-sized coils, provided that production constraints allow the stacking order to be optimal. - Recycle of hot flue gases to the firing zone of the furnace would produce a. decrease in the thermal efficiency up to 30 % but decreases the heating time by about 26 %...|$|R

These results show the potential of the method for developing optimal operation strategies for batch chemical processes. Keywords: <b>batch</b> distillation, simulated <b>annealing,</b> dynamic optimization. 1 Introduction The determination of optimal control strategies for chemical processe [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Phosphate glasses {{have special}} applications, but tra,ditionally {{never have had}} both {{durability}} and a low glass transition temperature (making them hard to work with). A composition study was used to find a more durable, easily fabricated phosphate glass with a low glass transition temperature. <b>Batching,</b> melting, casting, <b>annealing</b> and fabrication of test parts were performed. Glasses were characterized for hardness, glass transition temperature and chemical durability. An interesting composition with small amounts of borate, tin and alumina {{was found to have}} improved durability with a low glass transition temperature. Future work could include further composition improvement and doping with rare earth ions to study their electro-optical effects in the glass. 2. 0 Background and Objectives In the past, phosphate glasses have seldom incorporated durability with a low transition temperature. It would be beneficial to achieve the production of a glass with both of these characteristics because it would allow for molded phosphate optics and coul...|$|R

A new main {{building}} {{was completed in}} 1967, incorporating a former stock warehouse, and measuring 500 by 59 ft in plan and more than 18 ft high, with a further 200-foot long bay containing the new heat treatment workshop. This building contained several large furnaces, using butane in a first for the city. This allowed many buildings {{to be put to}} new uses: the south-east crucible shops as stores, the heat treatment workshop as a stock grinding plant, and the steel working shop as an <b>annealing</b> and cleaning <b>plant.</b> [...] The gas-fired crucible furnaces and the gas plant were demolished, but English Heritage believe that substantial remains of these exist below ground.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In this {{research}} work {{the effect of}} internal strain on electrical tree growth has been revealed in clear polyester. Strain {{was introduced in the}} specimen by the introduction of particles like aluminium oxide, polytetroflouroethylene (PTFE) and glass beads in a clear polyester resin C. Aluminium oxide particles of size 105 µm, PTFE 675 µm and glass beads of 1 mm were tested. These materials were employed in a clear polyester resin thus making a barrier. The <b>batch</b> of 20 <b>annealed,</b> un-annealed and oiled specimens of each material were tested. Using aluminium oxide, PTFE and glass beads made detailed observation of the interaction between advancing tree channels and the particles. The clear interaction of tree channel between dense barrier of aluminium oxide and PTFE was impossible but glass beads being transparent in nature allowing progress of the tree through barrier to be carefully studied. Strain were removed or relaxed by annealing the specimens and work of adhesion reduced by oiling the specimens. Key words: Electrical treeing • strain • transmission and distribution • resi...|$|R
40|$|This work {{examines}} {{the possibility of}} applying CuZn alloys as a reducing medium for the efficient removal of hexavalent chromium from drinking water. In an effort to develop a route for producing powders of CuZn alloys under mild conditions and investigate the optimum composition for such application, a series of alloys {{in the form of}} powders were prepared, by a sequence of Cu and Zn ball-milling and low temperature <b>annealing.</b> <b>Batch</b> Cr(VI) removal tests, performed to evaluate and compare the efficiency of the products under typical natural water parameters (pH 7 and natural-like water), indicated that the best performing material have a composition around 50 wt% Cu. The dominant reduction mechanisms are both the corrosion of the alloy surface and the electron transfer to the solution. The behavior of granulated CuZn media was tested in rapid-scale column tests using the commercial KDF which verified the high potential of CuZn alloys in Cr(VI) removal. Nevertheless, Cu and Zn leaching problems should be also considered. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The {{crushing}} strength (load at fracture) of coated particles {{was measured by}} compression between soft metal anvils. The method requires no sample preparation {{and can be used}} as a quality control method as well as a valuable tool for comparing different coating conditions during the manufacture of TRISO particles. Batches of coated particles manufactured with different coating parameters were prepared and tested. Batches prepared under different conditions exhibited significant differences in {{crushing strength}}. Higher argon concentrations in the coater gas mixture resulted in higher crushing strength. Anomalies in the crushing strength of particles are related to defects and possibly residual stresses produced during coating. The influence of annealing at 1950 °C on crushing strength was also investigated. The average crushing strength of batches of particles decreased with annealing. Different preparation methods showed a marked difference in the level of deterioration of the particles with <b>annealing.</b> <b>Batches</b> produced with 80 % argon gas mixture at 130 °C showed the greatest reduction in crushing strength. An inverse correlation was found between the crushing strength and the uranium that is leached from batches. The particles with the lowest crushing strength would also be more susceptible to mechanical damage during handling and consequently also to leaching of the uranium during leach tests.
