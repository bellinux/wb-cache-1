25|$|What commends it (Quran) so powerfully to the {{historian}} is its authenticity, {{not as the}} Word of God, of course, as the Muslims believe but as the secular historian cannot and should not, {{but rather as a}} document attesting to what Muhammad said at that time and place, early seventh-century Mecca. It is not a transcript, however; our present Quran is the result of an edition prepared under the orders of Uthman... but the search for significant variants in the partial versions extant before Uthman's standard edition, what can be called the sources behind our text, has not yielded any differences of great significance. Those Uthmanic clues are fragmentary, however, and large 'invented' portions might well have been added to our Quran or authentic material deleted. So it has <b>been</b> <b>charged</b> <b>in</b> fact by some Muslims who failed to find in the present Quran any explicit reference to the designation of a successor to the Prophet and so have alleged tampering with the original texts. But the argument is so patently tendentious and the evidence adduced for the fact so exiguous that few have failed to be convinced that what is in our copy of the Quran is in fact what Muhammad taught, and is expressed in his own words.|$|E

2500|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{high-profile}} hate crime in modern Britain occurred in Eltham, London, on 24 April 1993, when 18-year-old black student Stephen Lawrence was {{stabbed to death}} in an attack by a gang of white youths. Two white teenagers were later charged with the murder, and {{at least three other}} suspects were mentioned in the national media, but the charges against them were dropped within three months after the Crown Prosecution Service concluded that there was insufficient evidence to prosecute. However, a change in the law a decade later allowed a suspect to be charged with a crime twice if new evidence emerged after the original charges were dropped or a [...] "not guilty" [...] verdict was delivered in court. Gary Dobson, who had been charged with the murder in the initial 1993 investigation, was found guilty of Stephen Lawrence's murder in January 2012 and sentenced to life imprisonment, as was David Norris, who had not <b>been</b> <b>charged</b> <b>in</b> 1993.

2500|$|According to {{some sources}} Venezuela's {{corruption}} includes widespread {{corruption in the}} police force. Criminologists and experts have stated that low wages and lack of police supervision {{has been attributed to}} police corruption. Many victims are afraid to report crimes to the police because many officers are involved with criminals and may bring even more harm to the victims. Human Rights Watch claims that the [...] "police commit one of every five crimes" [...] and that thousands of people have been killed by police officers acting with impunity (only 3% of officers have <b>been</b> <b>charged</b> <b>in</b> cases against them). [...] The Metropolitan Police force in Caracas was so corrupt that it was disbanded and was even accused of assisting in many of the 17,000 kidnappings.

2500|$|Prosecutors {{later called}} a Japanese woman, also a student, {{who had been}} raped four months before St. Guillen's death {{in a manner similar}} to that of the 2005 Woodard case for which Littlejohn was convicted.

[...] David, who objected to both Woodard's and the Japanese woman's testimonies, {{verbally}} attacked the second victim's inability to identify Littlejohn in a lineup, stating: [...] "My client has scars on his face and a tattoo that's very noticeable under his eye and that's something that one would expect that she would have noticed and had them put either in the sketch or at least mentioned it". [...] While Littlejohn had not <b>been</b> <b>charged</b> <b>in</b> the Japanese student's attack, prosecutors insisted there was [...] "compelling proof" [...] that he was her attacker, based on the DNA evidence from the T-shirt and the manner in which she was attacked, similar to Woodard and St. Guillen.|$|E
