5|$|In {{addition}} to the winner's trophy and the individual winner's medals awarded to players, the Premier League also awards the monthly Manager of the Month and Player of the Month awards, as well as annual awards for Manager of the Season, Player of the Season, Golden <b>Boot</b> <b>and</b> the Golden Glove awards.|$|E
5|$|Standardized system: Boots and {{bindings}} have {{an integrated}} connection, typically a bar {{across the front}} end of the sole of the <b>boot,</b> <b>and</b> platform on which the boot rests. Two families of standards prevail: NNN (New Nordic Norm) and SNS (Salomon Nordic System) Profil. Both systems have variants for skiing on groomed surfaces and in back country. These systems are the most common type of binding.|$|E

5|$|Boot {{was born}} in Moscow. His parents, both Russian Jews, later emigrated from the Soviet Union to Los Angeles, where he was raised. Max Boot was educated at the University of California, Berkeley (BA, History, 1991) and Yale University (MA, Diplomatic History, 1992). He started his journalistic career writing columns for the Berkeley student {{newspaper}} The Daily Californian. He later stated that he believes {{he is the only}} conservative writer in that paper's history. <b>Boot</b> <b>and</b> his family currently live in the New York area.|$|E
5|$|His next {{event was}} the 2008 Four Continents, where he placed {{second in the}} short program and third in the free skate, and {{finished}} third overall. Lysacek was also named to the team for the 2008 World Championships. A week before the event, {{he was forced to}} withdraw due to an injury sustained while attempting a triple axel; the blade broke off of his <b>boot</b> <b>and</b> he injured {{the left side of his}} body, from his forearm to his shoulder, and required a cast. Lysacek toured over the summer of 2008 with the Stars on Ice tour.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, an Argentine Army {{expedition}} found additional wreckage—including a propeller and wheels (one {{of which}} had an intact and inflated tyre)—and noted that the wreckage was well localised, a fact which pointed to a head-on impact with the ground, and which also ruled out a mid-air explosion. Human remains were also recovered, including three torsos, a foot in an ankle <b>boot</b> <b>and</b> a manicured hand. By 2002, the bodies of five of the eight British victims had been identified through DNA testing.|$|E

5|$|The Premier League Golden Boot is {{an annual}} {{association}} football award {{presented to the}} leading goalscorer in the Premier League. For sponsorship purposes, from 1994 to 2001 {{it was called the}} Carling Golden <b>Boot</b> <b>and</b> from 2001 to 2004, the Barclaycard Golden Boot; as of 2015, it {{is referred to as the}} Barclays Golden Boot. In addition to the trophy, winners of the Golden Boot are usually given £1,000 for every goal they scored throughout the season to donate to a charity of their choice, although Robin van Persie was given £30,000 after scoring 26 goals in the 2012–13 season.|$|E
5|$|A {{cylinder}} boot is a {{hard rubber}} or plastic cover which fits over {{the base of a}} diving cylinder to protect the paint from abrasion and impact, to protect the surface the cylinder stands on from impact with the cylinder, {{and in the case of}} round bottomed cylinders, to allow the cylinder to stand upright on its base. Some boots have flats moulded into the plastic to reduce the tendency of the cylinder to roll on a flat surface. It is possible in some cases for water to be trapped between the <b>boot</b> <b>and</b> the cylinder, and if this is seawater and the paint under the boot is in poor condition, the surface of the cylinder may corrode in those areas. This can usually be avoided by rinsing in fresh water after use and storing in a dry place. The added hydrodynamic drag caused by a cylinder boot is trivial in comparison with the overall drag of the diver, but some boot styles may present a slightly increased risk of snagging on the environment.|$|E
5|$|Bulgaria {{performs}} well {{in sports}} such as wrestling, weight-lifting, boxing, gymnastics, volleyball, football and tennis. The country fields {{one of the leading}} men's volleyball teams, ranked sixth in the world according to the 2013 FIVB rankings. Football {{is by far the most}} popular sport. Some famous players are Dimitar Berbatov, former Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur forward, Georgi Asparuhov, former Levski Sofia forward and Hristo Stoichkov, winner of the Golden <b>Boot</b> <b>and</b> the Golden Ball and the most successful Bulgarian player of all time. Prominent domestic clubs include PFC CSKA Sofia and PFC Levski Sofia. The best performance of the national team at FIFA World Cup finals came in 1994, when it advanced to the semi-finals by defeating consecutively Greece, Argentina, Mexico and Germany, finishing fourth. Bulgaria has participated in most Olympic competitions since its first appearance at the 1896 games, when it was represented by Charles Champaud. The country has won a total of 218 medals: 52 gold, 86 silver, and 80 bronze, which puts it in 24th place in the all-time ranking.|$|E

5|$|In 1975, Peter and Barbara McGregor {{began to}} restore {{the ruins of the}} castle, {{with the support of the}} Department of the Environment, Kent County Council and the British Army. As part of the project, archaeological {{investigations}} were carried out between 1975 and 1979 by Edward Harris. The part of the 1806 esplanade around the north-east bastion was excavated, revealing the lower 16th-century stonework of the tower and the east side of the 1859 magazine, and a retaining wall was built to support the newly exposed walls. This created two levels in the outer bailey: a higher level on the western side, which still covered the north-west tower, and a lower one on the eastern. The keep was turned into a private residence, with a new sun room built on top of the gun platform. In 2000, Geoffrey <b>Boot</b> <b>and</b> his wife acquired the castle, which is now used by Boot's company, AMT South Eastern Ltd.|$|E
5|$|Known for scoring {{goals with}} diving headers, {{one of her}} more notable goals {{occurred}} in the 122nd minute of the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup quarterfinal match against Brazil off of a last-minute cross from midfielder Megan Rapinoe. Wambach scored the equalizer in stoppage time and the Americans defeated Brazil in a penalty shootout. The team eventually progressed to the World Cup final against Japan. Wambach's last-minute goal set a new record for the latest goal ever scored in a World Cup match and was awarded ESPN's 2011 ESPY Award for Best Play of the Year. Following her performance at the 2011 World Cup, Wambach was awarded the tournament's Bronze <b>Boot</b> <b>and</b> Silver Ball. In 2011, {{she became the first}} ever soccer player of any gender to be named Associated Press Athlete of the Year.|$|E

Her husband would not be charged and would be free to leave. Both parents were given arguido status on 7 September, and were advised by their lawyer not to answer questions. The Polícia Judiciária told Gerry that Madeleine's DNA had been found in the car <b>boot</b> <b>and</b> behind the sofa in 5A. Gerry did respond to questions, but Kate declined to reply to 48 questions she was asked during an 11-hour interview.|$|E

5|$|This dip in {{success was}} {{compounded}} when Arsenal failed again to secure back-to-back league titles when they lost out to Chelsea in the 2004–05 season, although Arsenal did win the FA Cup (the Final of which Henry missed through injury). Henry maintained {{his reputation as}} one of Europe's most feared strikers as he led the league in scoring, and with 31 goals in all competitions, he was the co-recipient (with Diego Forlán) of the European Golden <b>Boot,</b> <b>and</b> is currently the only player to have officially won the award twice in a row (Ally McCoist also had two Golden Boots in a row, but both were deemed unofficial). The unexpected departure of Arsenal's captain Patrick Vieira in the 2005 close season led to Henry being awarded club captaincy, a role which many felt was not naturally suited for him; the captaincy is more commonly given to defenders or midfielders, who are better-placed on the pitch to read the game. Along with being chief goalscorer, he was responsible for leading a very young team which had yet to gel fully.|$|E
5|$|Engine {{packaging}} {{became a}} contentious issue during development. Holden's designers wanted the engine positioned well {{behind the front}} axle to allow short overhangs and an overall sportier appearance, whereas the crash engineers were concerned that this would reduce the body's impact absorption in an accident. Negotiation between designers and crash engineers resulted in moving some of the engine components, including relocating the battery to the boot, freeing up valuable front-end space. By having the engine moved back and further down, the VE Commodore also benefits from near perfect 50:50 weight distribution across all variants, leading to superior handling. Crash engineers introduced several other safety initiatives, including relocating the fuel tank {{in front of the}} rear-axle line, instead of behind. A more crash-resistant rear-end was also seen as necessary. The design though had to incorporate a spacious <b>boot</b> <b>and</b> a spare-wheel bay that could house the largest-sized wheel to be fitted to the car. Crash test results from Australasian New Car Assessment Program (ANCAP) rate the VE lower in the offset frontal impact test than the previous generation Commodore. The overall crash score was marginally higher than the outgoing VZ, due to improvements in side impact protection giving a score of 27.45 out of 37 or a four star rating out of a possible five.|$|E
5|$|The most {{prominent}} rivalry {{heading into the}} pay-per-view was between then-WWF Champion Diesel and his storyline rival Sid. At the previous pay-per-view, WrestleMania XI, Diesel defeated Shawn Michaels to retain the WWF Championship, partly due to an interference by Michaels' bodyguard Sid backfiring. The following night, Michaels stated that for a potential rematch, he would give Sid the night off, causing the bodyguard to turn on Michaels by powerbombing him three times. Diesel eventually came out to help Michaels. Michaels was legitimately injured, and this sidelined him for six weeks, effectively shelving plans for a rematch between Diesel and Michaels. Diesel was then scheduled to defend his title against Bam Bam Bigelow, {{a member of the}} Million Dollar Corporation stable, after a staged confrontation between the two on the April 16, 1995 episode of Action Zone, a secondary television program for the WWF. On the same day, on Wrestling Challenge, another secondary television program, in a segment featuring the Corporation, Bigelow was noticeably snubbed, signaling a turn. Over the weekend of April 16, a match between Sid and Diesel was scheduled for In Your House, in which Sid could potentially face Diesel for the WWF Championship, depending on whether he retained or lost his title against Bigelow. On the April 24 episode of Raw, Sid stated he was unhappy about this stipulation, as it meant that if Bigelow won, Sid would not get a shot at the title. Diesel retained the title when the Corporation turned on Bigelow, with Tatanka tripping Bigelow as he ran off the ropes. Diesel hit Bigelow with a big <b>boot</b> <b>and</b> executed a powerbomb for the win. After the contest, Bigelow was insulted by Ted DiBiase and attacked by the Corporation. Diesel, who had gone back to the locker room, came to Bigelow's aid. In Sid's match with Razor Ramon on the May 1 episode of Raw, Diesel approached the ring ready to fight Sid, who, along with the Corporation's manager DiBiase, left the arena abruptly. The following week on Raw, DiBiase revealed that he and Sid had been working together for a while, admitting that it was him who told Shawn Michaels to get a bodyguard.|$|E
