40|$|Bartlesville (Oklahoma) Energy Technology Center (BETC) {{engineers}} made a {{study of}} recycling waste heat {{from one of the}} Power Plant boilers. The study showed that a system could be designed that would reclaim this waste heat and then utilize it to preheat air for boiler operation. The system incorporated a heat pipe heat exchanger flanged in a stack <b>by-pass</b> <b>loop</b> that would efficiently capture and transfer heat at low temperature differences (?T 350 - 5000 F). After reclaiming heat from this source, the burner air supply is preheated by passing through the heat exchanger. Sensitive design problems that had to be resolved were: Overall cost-effectiveness; below dew point cooling of stack gas causing acid corrosion; and selection of an effective heat exchanger for this application The candidate boiler is one of two that generate high temperature hot water (HTHW) for BETC facility heating and cooling. One unit normally handles the heating and cooling load while the other is in standby status. The preheat system was designed by BETC engineers. The new stack assembly was fabricated by a local metal shop, and was installed by BETC maintenance personnel. The cost of the heat exchanger and other hard-ware was $ 7, 562. Operational results show that boiler efficiency has increased between 6 and 7 percent, which reflects the percent of reduction in fuel consumption. At full-load conditions, the burner supply air is preheated to 350 oF and stack gas is cooled to 310 oF. Corrosion damage to the heat exchanger and other internal parts are non-existent. Natural gas is the boiler fuel, and as expected, no residue coating of the heat exchanger has developed. To date, we are well pleased with the performance of the system. The savings in fuel and dollars speaks for itself. We are optimistic that this approach of reclaiming heat is not only technically feasible, but also cost-effective for many industry boilers that emit low temperature stack gas...|$|E
40|$|An {{extensive}} thermal-hydraulic experimental {{campaign was}} conducted on He-FUS 3 helium loop facility to support the conceptual design of HCLL and HCPB Test Blanket System. The experiments were divided into three distinct phases. The first one was dedicated to {{the evaluation of the}} new ATEKO Turbo Circulator (TC) performances, identifying its operating limits in terms of supplied helium mass flow as a function of rotational speed, cold <b>by-pass</b> opening and <b>loop</b> pressure. The outcomes were compared with the manufacturer theoretical performance map and with a RELAP 5 - 3 D pre-test computation. In the second phase, experiments were carried out to analyze the facility dynamic response in hot conditions and to characterize its main components (TC, heaters, economizer, cooling system and valves). The wide amount of collected data will serve for the development and validation of a numerical model of the facility at TBS conditions. For the third phase, the tests were designed to investigate He-FUS 3 behavior in accidental conditions representative of LOFAs and LOCAs scenarios...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, Kohm-Sham density {{functional}} theory (KS-DFT) calculations {{are routinely}} employed in several research ÿelds, {{due to the}} ability of KS-DFT to provide great accuracy for a wide class of molecular systems and materials. Unfortunately, conventional KS-DFT calculations, althoughN very powerful, rOe Nquir 3 e ascaling,computationalunderminingcostthat goes with the cube of the system size, also known as in practice the study of large systems. The advent of linear-scaling, or O (N), DFT (LS-DFT) methods, relying on the locality of the electronic matter, has enabled calculations on increasingly large systems, up {{to tens of thousands of}} atoms. The central tenet of linear-scaling methods is the exponential decay in real space of the single-particle reduced density matrix. This property allows to enforce localisation constraints on the electronic structure, signiÿcantly reducing the size of the matrices, such as the Hamiltonian matrix, and increasing their sparsity. The single-particle density matrix in the LS-DFT formalism is expanded in terms of a set of atom-centred, strictly localised functions. Employing periodic boundary conditions (PBCs), the energy is minimised with respect to all the degrees of freedom in the density matrix, which allows to attain chemical accuracy using a high-resolution minimal basis set. The combination of localisation constraints and sparse algebra form the substrate for O (N) calculations. In this thesis, we used Onetep, a linear-scaling DFT program, to carry out our calculations. The aim of our research is to combine molecular dynamics simulations, within the Born-Oppenheimer approximation (BOMD), with linear-scaling DFT methods. In particular, our main goal is to advance current methodology by developing new algorithms to better exploit locality in BOMD and to reduce the computational load while maintaining DFT accuracy. Dipole moment autocorrelation functions can directly be employed to obtain the IR spectrum of a given molecular system. DFT-MD simulations o˛er the perfect tool to generate accurate autocorrelation functions which automatically take into account the anharmonicity of the potential energy surface and temperature e˛ects. Computational IR spectroscopy plays a pivotal role in the understanding of conformational changes of biomolecules, which tend to show several almost-degenerate conformers at room temperatures (°oppy molecules). It is particularly valuable when interpreting their ÿngerprint in solution in combination with experimental spectra. We have implemented two algorithms for the computation of the local electronic dipole moments of molecules in solution. Both methods demand a strategy to partition the density. These methods enable the computation of IR spectra of large molecules, such as polypeptide, in explicit solvent. In the resulting IR spectrum the e˛ect of the solvent on the target molecule is automatically captured, whereas its IR signature is removed. We expect these new functionalities to be very helpful in the understanding of how bio-molecules interact with the solvent at room temperature and the e˛ect of these interactions on conformational changes. Computationally, the most demanding step in molecular dynamics simulations is the evaluation of energies and forces. This has particular severe consequences on BOMD-based approaches. In fact, a self-consistent ÿeld (SCF) step is required at each MD step, which in turn requires multiple energy evaluations. As a consequence, the SCF loop has a major e˛ect on the computational load and overall wall-time. MD Schemes that are capable to <b>by-pass</b> the SCF <b>loop</b> altogether, e. g. Car-Parrinello MD or ÿxed charge force ÿelds in classical MD, are inherently faster in terms of wall-time per MD step, although they usually demand a much smaller time-step. Moreover, the quality of the converged density matrix is crucial for energy conservation and forces in the LS-DFT BOMD approaches. In theory, the self-consistent solution does not depend on the initial guess. In practice, the SCF optimisation is always incomplete, leading to memory e˛ects and the breaking of time-reversal symmetry, which gives rise to systematic errors in energy gradients that manifest as a drift in microcanonical energy. To ameliorate this problem, we present two integration schemes based on an extended-Lagrangian (XL) approach which introduces extended or auxiliary electronic degrees of freedom to generate good quality time-reversible initial guesses in the SCF loop. Both schemes are improvements over the original XL formulation, which su˛ered from numerical noise accumulation. The ÿrst approach, known as dissipative XL (dXL), introduces a dissipative-like term in the Verlet integration (modiÿed Verlet) of the auxiliary degrees of freedom; the second approach, known as inertial XL (iXL), introduces a thermostat, hence requiring a velocity Verlet integrator. We have implemented both schemes in Onetep and studied their performance using liquid water as test case. In collaboration with the authors of the schemes, we have analysed the energy drift in both classical polarisable force ÿeld MD calculations and LS-DFT BOMD. We have found that both schemes are very e˝cient in reducing the number of SCF iterations while maintaining good energy drifts and have similar performance. We believe that our implementation and analysis will be very beneÿcial for future applications both with LS-DFT BOMD and classical polarisable force ÿeld MD since both schemes constitute important algorithmic improvements that markedly extend the timescales accessible to classical and LS-DFT MD simulations alike...|$|R
