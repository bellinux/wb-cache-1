Said the filing: [...] "Rolling Stone and Erdely's highly defamatory and false statements about Dean Eramo were {{not the result of}} an innocent mistake. They were the result of a wanton journalist who was more concerned with writing an article that fulfilled her preconceived narrative about the victimization of women on American college campuses, and a malicious publisher who was more concerned about selling magazines to boost the economic <b>bottom</b> <b>line</b> <b>for</b> its faltering magazine, than they were about discovering the truth or actual facts." [...] In February 2016, the judge in the lawsuit ordered Jackie to appear at a deposition on April 5, 2016. On March 30, 2016, The Washington Post reported that Jackie's lawyers have requested the April deposition be cancelled, to avoid having her [...] "revisit her sexual assault". However, on April 2, 2016, the judge denied the motions and ordered Jackie to appear for a deposition on April 6, to be held at a secret location. [...] On November 4, 2016, after 20 hours of deliberation, a jury consisting of eight women and two men found Rolling Stone, the magazine's publisher and Erdely liable for defaming Eramo. On November 7, 2016, the jury decided that Rolling Stone and Erdely were liable for 3 million dollars in damages to Eramo.|$|E

In contrast, politically conservative CEOs will tend to [...] support the practice of CSR if they hold a view that it will provide a good return to the financials {{of the company}}. In other words, this type of executives tend to not see the outcome of CSR as a value to the company if it does not provide anything in exchange.|$|E
