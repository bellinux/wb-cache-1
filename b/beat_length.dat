50|$|Note that a polarization-maintaining fiber {{does not}} {{polarize}} {{light as a}} polarizer does. Rather, PM fiber maintains the linear polarization of linearly polarized light provided that it is launched into the fiber aligned {{with one of the}} fiber's polarization modes. Launching linearly polarized light into the fiber at a different angle will excite both polarization modes, conducting the same wave at slightly different phase velocities. At most points along the fiber the net polarization will be an elliptically polarized state, with a return to the original polarization state after an integer number of beat lengths. Consequently, if visible laser light is launched into the fiber exciting both polarization modes, scattering of propagating light viewed from the side, is observed with a light and dark pattern periodic over each <b>beat</b> <b>length,</b> since scattering is preferentially perpendicular to the polarization direction.|$|E
5000|$|Polarization-maintaining fibers work by {{intentionally}} {{introducing a}} systematic linear birefringence in the fiber, {{so that there}} are two well defined polarization modes which propagate along the fiber with very distinct phase velocities. The <b>beat</b> <b>length</b> Lb of such a fiber (for a particular wavelength) is the distance (typically a few millimeters) over which the wave in one mode will experience an additional delay of one wavelength compared to the other polarization mode. Thus a length Lb /2 of such fiber is equivalent to a half-wave plate. Now consider {{that there might be a}} random coupling between the two polarization states over a significant length of such fiber. At point 0 along the fiber, the wave in polarization mode 1 induces an amplitude into mode 2 at some phase. However at point 1/2 Lb [...] along the fiber, the same coupling coefficient between the polarization modes induces an amplitude into mode 2 which is now 180 degrees out of phase with the wave coupled at point zero, leading to cancellation. At point Lb along the fiber the coupling is again in the original phase, but at 3/2 Lb it is again out of phase and so on. The possibility of coherent addition of wave amplitudes through crosstalk over distances much larger than Lb is thus eliminated. Most of the wave's power remains in the original polarization mode, and exits the fiber in that mode's polarization as it is oriented at the fiber end. Optical fiber connectors used for PM fibers are specially keyed so that the two polarization modes are aligned and exit in a specific orientation.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—A full-vectorial finite-difference scheme {{utilizing}} the hexagonal Yee’s cell {{is used in}} this paper to analyze the modes of photonic-bandgap fibers with symmetry. Because it respects the fiber’s native symmetry, this method is free from any numerical birefringence. We also incorporate in it techniques for reducing the memory requirement (up to 3 to 4 times) and computational time, in particular by exploiting some of the symmetry proper-ties of these fibers. Using sub-pixel averaging, we demonstrate quadratic convergence for the fundamental mode’s effective index dependence on spatial resolution. We show that this method {{can be used to}} calculate the <b>beat</b> <b>length</b> of PBFs in which a birefringence is introduced by applying a small unidirectional stretch to the fiber cross section along one of its axes. Abrupt variations of the modeled fiber geometries with spatial resolution lead to oscillatory <b>beat</b> <b>length</b> convergence behavior. We can obtain a better estimate for <b>beat</b> <b>length</b> by averaging these oscillations. We apply a strong perturbation analysis to the fiber’s unperturbed mode, calculated by our finite-difference method, to perform this averaging in a rigorous way. By fitting a polynomial to the predicted beat lengths as a function of grid spacing, we obtain an accurate estimate of the <b>beat</b> <b>length</b> at zero grid spacing.

40|$|The first {{polarisation}} {{beam splitter}} {{based on a}} single-mode fused-taper coupler has been recently demonstrated. In the device it was shown that the frequency response of the coupling of unpolarised light exhibits a modulated oscillatory behaviour. The modulation occurs because the coupling strengths of x- and y-polarised light are slightly different, resulting in different <b>beat</b> <b>lengths</b> for the two polarisations. Potentially there are many important applications which can exploit this effect. These include wavelength filters, multiplexers, modulators, and wavelength tuneable couplers. The ease and simplicity of fabrication of the fused coupler is an added advantage when considering such applications. In this paper we present further results which demonstrate that the polarisation splitting ability arises predominantly from geometrical birefringence in the coupling region.

40|$|The {{coupling}} of two codirectional modes in waveguides exhibiting, intensity-dependent {{refractive index}} may be spatially unstable: {{small changes in}} the input light field yeld large variations at {{the output of the}} guiding structure. Based on this effect, a number of devices can be designed whose common feature is that an intense beam can be switched by means of a much weaker controlling light field. Fast responding nonlinear glass fibers require high switching power and large dimensions. Moreover, for certain incidence conditions fiber imperfections may cause chaotic switching at the output of a few <b>beat</b> <b>lengths</b> long fiber. Sub-watt switching powers are possible with resonant nonlinearities. In this case, however, large absorptive losses and saturation of the nonlinear index changes may inhibit the instability (and nonlinear switching).
