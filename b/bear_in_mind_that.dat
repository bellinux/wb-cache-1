25|$|In {{the whole}} of the ten years I have been working on radio and television, I have been working to a {{majority}} of women. I think women prefer men to be well-mannered, so I always try to watch my manners. They like men to be well dressed, so I do my best to observe this. Others bring to my notice the fact that I sometimes make grammatical errors in my speech; so, because of this, I try to watch my grammar – {{but at the same time}} I <b>bear</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> it's more profitable for me to be entertaining than to be perfect in my use of English.|$|E

In Taiwan, the success of introduced bird species was related to their native range size and body size; larger species with larger native range sizes {{were found to have}} larger introduced range sizes.|$|E

The refrigerators were included out of gratuity. The car was rough but drive-able. Taking the refrigerators into account, he essentially paid about $600 per car. Restoration costs would bring the total cost up to about 1 million Francs, or $2,858 US, per car. The cars were delivered to the US in January 1951.|$|E

[...] The Daily Express opined that [...] "one cannot withhold a tribute to his daring resourcefulness and inflexible courage" [...] and called Lody [...] "one of the cleverest spies in Steinhauer's service", though it advised its readers to <b>bear</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> he was [...] "a most dangerous spy." ...|$|E

500|$|Whether an {{advanced}} extraterrestrial civilization would send humanity a decipherable message {{is a matter}} of debate in itself. Sagan argued that a highly advanced extraterrestrial civilization would <b>bear</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> they were communicating with a relatively primitive one and therefore would try to ensure that the receiving civilization would be able to understand the message. Arguing against this view, astronomer Guillermo Lemarchand stated that {{an advanced}} civilization would probably encrypt a message with high information content, such as an Encyclopædia Galactica, {{in order to ensure that}} only other ethically advanced civilizations would be able to understand it. Douglas Vakoch assumes it may take some time to decode any message, telling ABC News that [...] "I don't think we're going to understand immediately what they have to say." [...] “There’s going to be a lot of guesswork in trying to interpret another civilization," [...] he told Science Friday, adding that [...] "in some ways, any message we get from an extraterrestrial will be like a cosmic Rorschach ink blot test.” ...|$|E

30|$|To sum up, {{one could}} say that, in general, foreign {{ownership}} tends to increase the wage rate, largely because of improved labour productivity, and {{that at least some}} studies have found that these wage increases spill over into other firms in the same sector.

2500|$|Modern {{knowledge}} of Sumerian phonology is certainly very flawed and incomplete {{because of the}} lack of native speakers, the transmission through the filter of Akkadian phonology and the difficulties posed by the cuneiform script.
