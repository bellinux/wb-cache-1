40|$|BACKGROUND Our {{aim was to}} {{evaluate}} the occurrence of implanted cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) shock and antitachycardia pacing (ATP), the effect of ICD therapies on mortality {{and the impact of}} revascularisation strategies <b>on</b> <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events.</b> PATIENTS AND METHODS We investigated 130 CAD patients undergoing ICD implantation between 1984 and 1999. RESULTS Freedom of shock was 66 +/- 7 %, 48 +/- 9 % and 48 +/- 9 % after 1, 3 and 5 years in patients with revascularisation and 62 +/- 8 %, 43 +/- 8 % and 23 +/- 11 % in patients without revascularisation, respectively; p = n. s. Freedom from ATP was similar in both groups - in patients with revascularisation, 64 +/- 6 %, 58 +/- 7 % and 58 +/- 7 % and without revascularisation 56 +/- 8 %, 51 +/- 9 % and 38 +/- 10 %, respectively; p = n. s. There {{were no significant differences in}} cumulative survival between patients with and without revascularisation; p = n. s. CONCLUSIONS CAD patients with VT/VF and with implanted ICD have, despite successful revascularisation, the same rate of device therapy and mortality as patients without an indication of revascularisation. This implies that patients with chronic ischemic heart disease and ventricular tachyarrhythmias continue to be at risk of sudden death after CABG/PTCA; evaluation for ICD implantation is warranted...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectives. The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{determine}} the influence of early thrombolysis on ventricular tachyarrhythmias (clinical and inducible) and heart rate variability in survivors of myocardial infarction at high risk for life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. Background, A greater electrical heart stability may be important in improving survival in patients treated with thrombolysis. Few data are available about the influence of fibrinolysis <b>on</b> postinfarction <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> and other prognostic variables, such as inducible ventricular tachycardia and heart rate variability. Methods. The study group comprised 51 consecutive patients who underwent electrophysiologic study within 30 days of infarction, owing to the presence of two or more of the following criteria: left ventricular ejection fraction < 40 %, late potentials and repetitive ventricular ectopic beats. Thirty patients underwent thrombolysis within 6 h of the onset of symptoms (Group A), and 21 received conventional treatment (Group B). Inducibility of sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia was tested in both groups, and the standard deviation of all normal RR intervals during 24 -h Holter monitoring was calculated. All patients were prospectively evaluated for occurrence of <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events.</b> Results. The two groups were similar with regard to left ventricular ejection fraction (mean ± 1 SD 38 ± 6 % [Group A] vs. 36 ± 8 % [Group B]). Ventricular tachycardia was induced in 6 (20 %) of 30 Group A patients versus 14 (67 %) of 21 Group B patients (p = 0. 002). The standard deviation of normal RR intervals was higher in Group A than in Group B (113 ± 36 vs. 90 ± 39 ms, p = 0. 05). In patients with anterior infarction, the standard deviation of normal RR intervals was higher in 19 patients with thrombolysis than in 16 patients with conventional treatment (118 ± 41 vs. 74 ± 24 ms, p = 0. 0002). During a mean follow-up period of 23 ± 11 months, 4 (13 %) of 30 Group A patients had an <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>event</b> versus 9 (43 %) of 21 Group B patients (p = 0. 04). Conclusions. After myocardial infarction, in high risk patients, thrombolysis significantly reduced the occurrence of <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> independently of left ventricular function. This effect may be related to both an improvement in electrical heart stability, as elucidated by electrophysiologic study, and a favorable action on the cardiac sympathovagal balance...|$|R
40|$|Heart failure (HF) {{and chronic}} obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD) are global epidemics incurring significant morbidity and mortality. The combination presents many diagnostic challenges. Clinical symptoms and signs frequently overlap. Evaluation of cardiac and pulmonary function is often problematic and occasionally misleading. Echocardiography and {{pulmonary function tests}} should be performed in every patient. Careful interpretation is required to avoid misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment. Airflow obstruction, in particular, must be demonstrated when clinically euvolaemic. Very high and very low concentrations of natriuretic peptides have high positive and negative predictive values for diagnosing HF in those with both conditions. Intermediate values are less informative. Both conditions are systemic disorders with overlapping pathophysiological processes. In patients with HF, COPD is consistently an independent predictor of death and hospitalization. However, the impact <b>on</b> ischaemic and <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> is unknown. Greater collaboration is required between cardiologists and pulmonologists to better identify and manage concurrent HF and COPD.

40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the influence of early reperfusion on the course of QT interval and QT interval variability in patients undergoing primary percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and its prognostic implications <b>on</b> major <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> during one-year follow-up. BACKGROUNDAlthough early coronary artery recanalization by primary angioplasty is an established therapy in AMI, a substantial number of patients is still threatened by malignant arrhythmias even after early successful reperfusion, which may be caused by an inhomogeneity of ventricular repolarization despite reperfusion. METHODSTemporal fluctuations of ventricular repolarization were studied prospectively in 97 consecutive patients with a first AMI by measurements of QT interval and QT interval variability during and after successful PTCA (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction flow grades 2 and 3). Continuous beat-to-beat QT interval measurement was performed from 24 -h Holter monitoring, which was initiated at admission before PTCA. RESULTSReperfusion caused a significant continuous increase of mean RR interval (738 ± 98 to 808. 5 ± 121 ms; p < 0. 001) and a significant decrease of parameters of QT interval (QTc: 440 ± 32 to 416. 5 ± 37 ms; p < 0. 001) and QT interval variability (QTcSD: 27. 5 ± 3 to 24. 9 ± 6 ms; p < 0. 001) in the majority of patients. However, in patients with major <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> at the one-year follow-up (sudden cardiac death, ventricular fibrillation or sustained ventricular tachycardia, n = 15), parameters of QT interval remained unaltered after successful reperfusion (QTc: 447. 3 ± 41 to 432. 9 ± 45 ms, p = NS; QTcSD: 35. 1 ± 13. 4 to 29. 0 ± 9. 1 ms, p = NS).

40|$|AIMS: The {{effect of}} statin {{treatment}} <b>on</b> ventricular <b>arrhythmic</b> complications is uncertain. We sought {{to test whether}} statins {{reduce the risk of}} ventricular tachyarrhythmia, cardiac arrest, and sudden cardiac death. METHODS AND RESULTS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL up to October 2010. Randomized controlled trials comparing statin with no statin or comparing intensive vs. standard dose statin, with more than 100 participants and at least 6 -month follow-up were considered for inclusion and relevant unpublished data obtained from the investigators. Twenty-nine trials of statin vs. control (113 568 participants) were included in the main analyses. In these trials, statin therapy did not significantly reduce the risk of ventricular tachyarrhythmia [212 vs. 209; odds ratio (OR) = 1. 02, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 84 - 1. 25, P = 0. 87] or of cardiac arrest (82 vs. 78; OR = 1. 05, 95 % CI 0. 76 - 1. 45, P = 0. 84), but was associated with a significant 10 % reduction in sudden cardiac death (1131 vs. 1252; OR = 0. 90; 95 % CI 0. 82 - 0. 97, P = 0. 01). This compared with a 22 % reduction in the risk of other 'non-sudden' (mostly atherosclerotic) cardiac deaths (1235 vs. 1553; OR = 0. 78, 95 % CI 0. 71 - 0. 87, P < 0. 001). Results were not materially altered by inclusion of eight trials (involving 41 452 participants) of intensive vs. standard dose statin regimens.

40|$|AbstractThe {{value of}} heart rate variability, {{ambulatory}} electrocardiographic (ECG) {{variables and the}} signal-averaged ECG in the prediction of <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> (sudden death or life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias) was assessed before hospital discharge in 416 consecutive survivors of acute myocardial infarction. During the follow-up period (range 1 to 1, 112 days), there were 24 <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> and 47 deaths. The initial relation between several prognostic factors and <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> was explored with use of the Kaplan-Meier product limit estimates of survival function. Impaired heart rate variability < 20 ms (p < 0. 0000), late potentials (p < 0. 0000), ventricular ectopic beat frequency (p < 0. 0000), repetitive ventricular forms (p < 0. 0000), left ventricular ejection fraction < 40 % (p < 0. 02) and Killip class (p < 0. 02) were identified as significant univariate predictors of <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events.</b> When these variables were analyzed by using a stepwise Cox regression model, only impaired heart rate variability, followed by late potentials and repetitive ventricular forms remained independent predictors of <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events.</b> The combination of impaired heart rate variability and late potentials had a sensitivity of 58 %, a positive predictive accuracy of 33 % and a relative risk of 18. 5 for <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> and was superior to other combinations including those incorporating left ventricular function, exercise ECG, ventricular ectopic beat frequency and repetitive ventricular forms.

The mean numeric values of the standard time domain signal-averaged ECG variables in patients without <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> differed significantly from those in patients with <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events.</b> The mean values of the spectral temporal signal-averaged ECG variables did not differ between the two patient groups.

Risk stratification of ARVC/D patients, however, remains an unresolved issue. In this study we investigated whether heart rate variability (HRV) can be helpful in identifying ARVC/D patients with increased risk of <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events.</b> METHODS AND RESULts: We studied 30 consecutive patients (17 males; 45. 4 ± 18 years) with ARVC/D, diagnosed according to guideline criteria; 15 patients (50 %) had received an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) for primary SCD prevention. HRV was assessed on 24 -h ECG Holter monitoring. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of major <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> (SCD, sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT), ICD therapy for sustained VT or ventricular fibrillation (VF)). During the follow-up period (19 ± 7 months), no deaths occurred, but 5 patients (17 %) experienced <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> (4 VTs and 1 VF, all in the ICD group). All HRV parameters were significantly lower in patients with, compared with those without, <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events.</b> Low-frequency amplitude was the most significant HRV variable associated with <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> in univariate Cox regression analysis (P= 0. 017), and was the only significant predictor of <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> in multivariable regression analysis (hazard ratio 0. 88, P= 0. 047), together with unexplained syncope (hazard ratio 16. 1, P= 0. 039).

Among eight patients with inducible sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia, six suffered <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> during a median follow-up period of 16 months. No patient without inducible sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia suffered an <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>event.</b> Multivariate analysis showed that of all the variables examined, inducible sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia was the only independent predictor of <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> during the follow-up period.

40|$|ObjectivesThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{describe}} the natural history of asymptomatic ventricular pre-excitation in children and to determine predictors of potentially life-threatening <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events.</b> BackgroundSudden death can be the first clinical manifestation in asymptomatic children with ventricular pre-excitation, but reduction of its incidence by prophylactic ablation requires the identification of subjects at high risk. MethodsBetween 1995 and 2005 we prospectively collected clinical and electrophysiologic data from 184 children (66 % male; median age 10 years; range 8 to 12 years) with asymptomatic ventricular pre-excitation on the electrocardiogram. After electrophysiologic testing, subjects were followed as outpatients taking no medications. The primary end point of the study was the occurrence of <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events.</b> Predictors of potentially life-threatening arrhythmias were analyzed. ResultsOver a median follow-up of 57 months (min/max 32 / 90 months) after electrophysiologic testing, 133 children (mean age 10 years; range 8 to 12 years) did not experience <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events,</b> remaining totally asymptomatic, while 51 children had within 20 months (min/max 8 / 60 months) a first <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>event,</b> which was potentially life-threatening in 19 of them (mean age 10 years; range 10 to 14 years). Life-threatening tachyarrhythmias resulted in cardiac arrest (3 patients), syncope (3 patients), atypical symptoms (8 patients), or minimal symptoms (5 patients). Univariate analysis identified tachyarrhythmia inducibility (p < 0. 001), anterograde refractory period of accessory pathways (APERP) ≤ 240 ms (p < 0. 001), and multiple accessory pathways (p < 0. 001) as risk factors for potentially life-threatening <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events.</b> Independent predictors by multivariate analysis were APERP (p = 0. 001) and multiple accessory pathway (p = 0. 001).

METHODSWe prospectively assessed T-wave alternans (TWA) and late potentials (LP) by signal-averaged electrocardiogram (ECG) and ejection fraction (EF) in 102 patients with successful determination results after acute MI. The TWA was analyzed using the power-spectral method during supine bicycle exercise testing. No antiarrhythmic drugs were used during the follow-up period. The study end point was the documentation of ventricular arrhythmias. RESULTSThe TWA was present in 50 patients (49 %), LP present in 21 patients (21 %), and an EF < 40 % in 28 patients (27 %). During a follow-up period of 13 ± 6 months, symptomatic, sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation occurred in 15 patients (15 %). The event rates were significantly higher in patients with TWA, LP, or an abnormal EF. The sensitivity and the negative predictive value of TWA in predicting <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> were very high (93 % and 98 %, respectively), whereas its positive predictive value (28 %) was lower than those for LP and EF.

We conducted a meta-analysis of the predictive value of MTWA screening for ventricular <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> in primary prevention patients with left ventricular dysfunction and examined whether results differed depending upon whether beta-blocker use was withheld prior to MTWA testing. Methods and Results: Prospective studies that evaluated whether MTWA predicted ventricular <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> published between January 1980 and September 2008 were identified. Summary estimates for the predictive value of MTWA were derived with random-effects models. Nine studies involving 3, 939 patients were identified. Overall, an abnormal MTWA (positive and indeterminate) test was associated with an almost 2 -fold increased risk for <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> (pooled RR = 1. 95, 95 % CI: 1. 29 – 2. 96; P = 0. 002). However, significant heterogeneity across studies was observed (P = 0. 024). In the 4 studies in which beta-blocker therapy was not withheld prior to MTWA assessment, an abnormal MTWA test was associated with a 5 -fold increased risk for <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> (pooled RR = 5. 39, 95 % CI: 2. 68 – 10. 84; P < 0. 001) and was robust to sensitivity analyses.

METHODSTime and frequency domain analysis of heart rate variability on 24 -h electrocardiographic (ECG) recording was assessed in 116 patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (91 men, aged 51 ± 12 years, left ventricular ejection fraction 34 ± 12 %). RESULTSMean follow-up (± SD) was 53 ± 39 months. Sixteen patients reached one of the defined study end-points (sudden death, resuscitated ventricular fibrillation or sustained ventricular tachycardia) during follow-up. Using multivariate analysis, only reduced standard deviation of all normal-to-normal intervals (SDNN) (p = 0. 02) and ventricular tachycardia during 24 -h ECG recording (p = 0. 02) predicted sudden death and/or <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events.</b> For SDNN, a cutoff level of 100 ms seemed the best for the risk stratification. CONCLUSIONSDecrease in heart rate variability is an independent predictor of <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> and sudden death in idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, whether the mechanism of sudden death is ventricular tachyarrhythmia or not...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Although it {{has been}} {{recently}} demonstrated {{that there was no}} significant difference in total survival and clinical outcomes between patients who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with or without surgical ventricular reconstruction (SVR), the question of whether or not SVR decreases the arrhythmic risk profile in this population has not been clarified yet. OBJECTIVE: To determine the real incidence of sudden cardiac death (SCD) and sustained ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation (sustained VT/VF) in patients following CABG added to SVR and to define their clinical and echocardiographic parameters predicting in-hospital and long-term <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> (SCD + sustained VT/VF). METHODS: Pre- and postoperative clinical and echocardiographic values as well as postoperative electrocardiogram Holter data of 65 patients (21 female, 63 ± 11 years) who underwent SVR + CABG were retrospectively evaluated. Results:  Mean follow-up was 1, 105 ± 940 days. At 3 years, the SCD-free rate was 98 % and the rate free from <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> was 88 %. Multivariate logistic analysis identified a preoperative left ventricular end-systolic volume index (LVESVI) > 102 mL/m(2) (odds ratio [OR] 1. 4, confidence interval [CI] 1. 073 - 1. 864, P = 0. 02; sensitivity 100 %, specificity 94 %) and a postoperative pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) > 27 mmHg (OR 2. 3, CI 1. 887 - 4. 487, P = 0. 01; sensitivity 100 %, specificity 71 %) as independent predictors of <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Our and previous studies report a low incidence of <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> in patients following SVR added to CABG, considering the high-risk profile of the study population. A preoperative LVESVI > 102 mL/m(2) and a postoperative PASP > 27 mmHg had a good sensitivity and specificity in predicting <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events...</b>|$|R

40|$|Noninvasive {{assessment}} was undertaken before hospital discharge in 210 {{patients who had}} recovered from acute myocardial infarction. This comprised signal-averaged electrocardiography, Holter monitoring and radionuclide left ventriculography. An abnormal signal-averaged electrocardiogram {{was defined as the}} presence of a low voltage signal less than 20 μV in the terminal 40 ms of the filtered QRS complex or a long filtered QRS complex > 120 ms. During a follow-up period of 6 months to 2 years (median 14 months), 15 patients had arrhythmic events: eight died suddenly and seven presented with sustained, symptomatic ventricular tachycardia. Using univariate analysis, abnormalities {{in each of the three}} noninvasive tests were able to predict <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events.</b> Stepwise logistic regression demonstrated that each test was independently significant in predicting outcome, with a left ventricular ejection fraction < 40 % being the most powerful variable (β= 2. 8, p < 0. 005). This process generated an algorithm that allowed assessment of combinations of variables: the finding of an abnormal signal-averaged electrocardiogram in the presence of an ejection fraction < 40 % identified patients with a 34 % probability of <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events.</b> By contrast, in patients with left ventricular dysfunction but a normal signal-averaged tracing, the risk of <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> was 4 % (p < 0. 001).

40|$|Background—Sudden {{cardiac death}} {{can be the}} first {{clinical}} presentation of asymptomatic ventricular preexcitation. Methods and Results—From 1995 to 2005, we prospectively collected clinical and electrophysiological data among 293 adults with asymptomatic ventricular preexcitation (61. 4 % males; median age, 36 years; interquartile range [IQR], 28 to 47. 5). After electrophysiological testing, patients were prospectively followed, taking no drugs. The primary end point {{of the study was}} the occurrence of a first <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>event.</b> Predictors of <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> were analyzed by univariate and multivariate Cox models. Over a median follow-up of 67 months (minimum to maximum, 8 to 90), after electrophysiological testing, 262 patients (median age, 37 years; IQR, 30 to 48) did not experience <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events,</b> remaining totally asymptomatic, whereas 31 patients (median age, 25 years; IQR, 22 to 29; median follow-up, 27 months; minimum to maximum, 8 to 55) had a first <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>event,</b> which was potentially life-threatening in 17 of them (median age, 24 years; IQR, 20 to 28. 5; median follow-up, 25 months; minimum to maximum, 9 to 55). Potentially life-threatening tachyarrhythmias resulted in resuscitated cardiac arrest (1 patient), presyncope (7 patients) syncope (4 patients), or dizziness (5 patients).

This study {{assessed}} {{the ability of}} signal-averaged electrocardiography, radionuclide ventriculography and Holter electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring and clinical variables to identify patients at risk of serious <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> after myocardial infarction in the thrombolytic era. Background. Most studies of signal-averaged electrocardiography, radionuclide ventriculography and Holter ECG monitoring in risk stratification after myocardial infarction preceded the introduction of thrombolytic therapy. Methods. A consecutive series of 301 survivors of myocardial infarction, 205 (68 %) of whom received thrombolytic agents, underwent signal-averaged eleclrocardiography (1 st 48 h, day 6 and discharge), Holter ECG monitoring (days 6 to 7) and radionuclide left ventriculography (days 7 to 14). Median follow-up time was 1. 03 years. Results. Thirteen patients (4. 3 %) had an <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>event</b> (sudden death in 11, sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia in 2). The 25 -Hz high pass filtered signal-averaged ECG at discharge was 64 % sensitive (95 % confidence intervals [CI] 36 % to 92 %) and 81 % specific (95 % CI 76 % to 86 %). High grade ventricular ectopic activity on the Holter ECG was only 38 % sensitive (95 % CI 12 % to 64 %) and 74 % specific (95 % CI 71 % to 77 %). Left ventricular ejection fraction < 0. 4 was the best test for prediction of <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> (sensitivity 75 % [95 % CI 56 % to 100 %] and specificity 81 % [95 % CI 76 % to 85 %]). In multivariate analysis, in rank order, digoxin therapy at discharge, an abnormal 25 -Hz signal-averaged ECG before discharge, absence of angina before index infarction and previous infarction were predictive of <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events.</b> With digoxin therapy excluded, ejection fraction was an independent predictor. Discriminant analysis identified a high risk group (12 % of the study patients) with an event rate of 26 %. Conclusions. The signal-averaged ECG and left ventricular ejection fraction are each independently predictive of <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> after myocardial infarction, but the Holter ECG is not.

40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the prevalence, characteristics and the predictive value of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) for subsequent death and <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). BACKGROUNDNonsustained VT has been linked to an increased risk for sudden death in coronary patients. It is unknown whether this parameter can be used for selection of high-risk patients to receive an implantable defibrillator for primary prevention of sudden death in patients shortly after AMI. METHODSIn 325 consecutive infarct survivors, 24 -h Holter monitoring was performed 10 ± 6 days after AMI. All patients underwent coronary angiography, determination of left ventricular function and assessment of heart rate variability (HRV). Mean follow-up was 30 ± 22 months. RESULTSThere was a low prevalence (9 %) of nonsustained VT shortly after AMI. Nonsustained VT together with depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was found in only 2. 4 % of patients. During follow-up, 25 patients reached one of the prospectively defined end points (primary composite end point of cardiac death, sustained VT or resuscitated ventricular fibrillation; secondary end point: <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events).</b> Kaplan Meier event probability analyses revealed that only HRV, LVEF and status of the infarct-related artery were univariate predictors of death or <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events.</b> The presence of nonsustained VT carried a relative risk of 2. 6 for the primary study end point but was not a significant predictor if only <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> were considered. <b>On</b> multivariate analysis, only HRV, LVEF and the status of the infarct artery were found to be independently related to the primary study end point. CONCLUSIONSThere is a low prevalence of nonsustained VT shortly after AMI. Only 2 % to 3 % of all infarct survivors treated according to contemporary guidelines demonstrate both depressed LVEF and nonsustained VT. The predictive value of nonsustained VT for subsequent mortality and <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> is inferior to that of impaired autonomic tone, LVEF or infarct-related artery patency. Accordingly, the use of nonsustained VT to select patients for primary implantable cardioverter/defibrillator prevention trials shortly after AMI appears to be limited...|$|R
40|$|Background - Brugada {{syndrome}} is an arrhythmogenic disease {{characterized by an}} ECG pattern of ST-segment elevation in the right precordial leads and {{an increased risk of}} sudden cardiac death as a result of ventricular fibrillation. Controversy exists with regard to risk stratification and therapeutic management, particularly in asymptomatic individuals. Methods and Results - A total of 212 individuals (mean age, 45 +/- 6 years) with a type 1 Brugada ECG pattern were studied. Of these, 123 (58 %) were asymptomatic, 65 (31 %) had {{greater than or equal to}} 1 syncope of unknown origin, and 24 (11 %) had to be resuscitated because of ventricular fibrillation. In 125 individuals (59 %), a spontaneous type 1 ECG was recorded. In the remaining, drug challenge with a class I antiarrhythmic agent unmasked a Brugada ECG. The mean ST elevation was 2. 3 +/- 1. 2 mm in symptomatic patients and 1. 9 +/- 1. 5 mm in asymptomatic individuals (P = 0. 04). During a mean follow-up of 40 +/- 50 months, 4 of the 24 patients (17 %) with aborted sudden cardiac death and 4 of 65 (6 %) with a prior syncope had a recurrent <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>event,</b> whereas only 1 of 123 asymptomatic individuals (0. 8 %) had a first <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>event.</b> Four of 9 patients with <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> during follow-up were not inducible during programmed electrical stimulation. A previous history of aborted sudden death or syncope and the presence of a spontaneous type 1 ECG were predictors of adverse outcome. Conclusions - The present study reports data on a large population of individuals with a type 1 Brugada ECG pattern with the longest follow-up reported so far. A very low incidence of severe <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events,</b> particularly in asymptomatic individuals, was found during follow-up. In the presence of very few <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> <b>on</b> follow-up, programmed electrical stimulation showed very little accuracy in predicting outcom...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: This {{study was}} {{performed}} to identify a possible relationship between genotype and phenotype in the congenital familial long QT syndrome (cLQTS). BACKGROUND: The cLQTS, which occurs as an autosomal dominant or recessive trait, is characterized by QT-interval prolongation on the electrocardiogram and torsade de pointes arrhythmias, which may give rise to recurrent syncope or sudden cardiac death. Precipitators for cardiac events are exercise or emotion and occasionally acoustic stimuli.

40|$|Aims Identification of implantable cardioverter/defibrillator (ICD) {{recipients}} {{at higher}} risk of future therapies may assist in pre-empting future shocks. Native QRS duration is an established predictor of overall mortality, but the role of this parameter as a clinical predictor of <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> warrants further investigation. Methods and results In an analysis of a single-centre, 13 -year ICD implantation experience (1990 – 2002), multiple clinical parameters including QRS duration were analysed using a multiple logistic regression model. Of 562 patients followed for at least 1 year, 98 (17 %) did not receive ICD therapies (event-free, group A). Comparisons were made with a randomly selected sample of 123 patients who received ICD therapies (<b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events,</b> group B). There {{were no significant differences}} in age, gender, frequency of coronary artery disease, and degree of left ventricular dysfunction. However, QRS duration was a sig-nificant determinant of <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> (100 vs., 100 ms: adjusted OR 2. 75, 95 % CI 1. 37 – 5. 51; 120 vs., 120 ms: adjusted OR 1. 77, 95 % CI 0. 97 – 3. 23).

40|$|AbstractObjectives. This study {{investigated}} prediction of <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> by the signal-averaged electrocardiogram (ECG) and programmed stimulation {{in patients with}} nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy. Background. Risk stratification in patients with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy remains controversial. Methods. Eighty patients with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy and spontaneous nonsustained ventricular tachycardia underwent signal-averaged electrocardiography (both time-domain and spectral turbulence analysis) and programmed stimulation. All patients were followed up for a mean of 22 ± 26 months. Results. Sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia was induced in 10 patients (13 %), who all received amiodarone. The remaining 70 patients were followed up without antiarrhythmic therapy. Of the 80 patients, 15 % had abnormal findings on the time-domain signal-averaged ECG, and 39 % had abnormal findings on spectral turbulence analysis. Time-domain signal-averaged electrocardiography had a better predictive accuracy for induced ventricular tachycardia than spectral turbulence analysis (88 % vs. 66 %, p < 0. 01). During follow-up, there were 9 <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> (5 sudden deaths, 4 spontaneous ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation) and 10 nonsudden cardiac deaths. Cox regression analysis showed that no variables predicted <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> or total cardiac deaths. The 2 -year actuarial survival free of <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> was similar in patients with or without abnormal findings on the signal-averaged ECG or induced ventricular tachycardia. Conclusions. In patients with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, 1) {{there is a strong}} correlation between abnormal findings on the time-domain signal-averaged ECG and induced ventricular tachycardia, but both findings are uncommon; and 2) normal findings on the signal-averaged ECG, as well as failure to induce ventricular tachycardia, do not imply a benign outcome...|$|R

There is limited data regarding variability in T-wave morphology and its prognostic value. In this study, we present a novel approach for the measurement of T-wave variability (TWV) reflecting changes in T-wave morphology, and we investigate the prognostic significance of Holter-derived TWV in patients with and without ventricular arrhythmias requiring appropriate implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) therapy from the Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator Implantation Trial II (MADIT II). Methods Study population consisted of 275 ICD patients from MADIT II after excluding patients with intraventricular conduction abnormalities or atrial fibrillation. TWV was measured <b>based</b> <b>on</b> amplitude variance of T-wave amplitude. Results During 2 -year follow-up, 58 (21 %) patients had appropriate ICD therapy for ventricular tachy-cardia or fibrillation. Patients with appropriate ICD therapy had higher levels of TWV measures than those without <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events.</b> After adjustment for heart rate, ejection fraction, and significant clinical predictors of <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events,</b> a Cox proportional-hazards regression model revealed that dichotomized TWV values were predictive for ventricular tachyarrhythmias requiring appropriate ICD therapy (hazard ratio, 2. 0; 95 % CI; 1. 2 – 3. 5; P 0. 01).
