25|$|Large <b>brushes</b> are desired for {{a larger}} <b>brush</b> contact area to {{maximize}} motor output, but small <b>brushes</b> are desired for low mass to maximize {{the speed at which}} the motor can run without the <b>brushes</b> excessively bouncing and sparking. (Small <b>brushes</b> are also desirable for lower cost.) Stiffer <b>brush</b> springs {{can also be used to}} make <b>brushes</b> of a given mass work at a higher speed, but at the cost of greater friction losses (lower efficiency) and accelerated <b>brush</b> and commutator wear. Therefore, DC motor <b>brush</b> design entails a trade-off between output power, speed, and efficiency/wear.|$|R

40|$|Techniques for {{interactive}} <b>brushing,</b> {{as found}} in multivariate data visualization systems, can be categorized as either screen-space or data-space. Screen-space techniques consider a <b>brush</b> to be a 2 -dimensional shape (usually a rectangle) {{which can be used}} to select points which map to a particular region of the display. Data-space techniques assume the <b>brush</b> has as many dimensions as the data set, i. e. the <b>brush</b> specifies an N-dimensional subspace of the entire data space. In this paper, I describe methods for specifying and manipulating N-dimensional <b>brushes</b> and show their implementation in the publicdomain visualization package XmdvTool. Among the topics covered are user-driven versus data-driven <b>brushing,</b> direct and indirect <b>brush</b> specification and modification, management of multiple simultaneous <b>brushes,</b> composite <b>brush</b> creation, and using <b>brushes</b> with ramped boundaries. ...|$|R

40|$|Polyelectrolyte <b>brushes</b> are polymer <b>brushes</b> with charged {{units on}} polymer chains. Due to the {{responsive}} properties of polyelectrolyte <b>brushes,</b> they have large applications in many fields. This thesis describes the synthetic approaches of growing polyelectrolyte <b>brushes</b> {{in a controlled}} way. The majority of this thesis focuses {{on the study of}} applying controlled living radical polymerisation methods on surface-initiated polymerisation, aiming to achieve controlled growth of polyelectrolyte <b>brush,</b> e. g. controlled <b>brush</b> thickness, grafting density, and internal structure of the <b>brush.</b> Atom transfer radical polymerisation (ATRP), activators (re) generated electron transfer (A(R) GET) ATRP and single electron-transfer living radical polymerisation (SET-LRP) have been studied systematically on the synthesis of polyelectrolyte <b>brushes</b> from surface. These polyelectrolyte <b>brushes</b> are studied using ellipsometry, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and contact angle goniometry. During the study, a unique property of the polyzwitterionic <b>brush</b> is found and explored.

40|$|AbstractThe rapid advancements {{in various}} current {{technologies}} {{and the constant}} trend in miniaturizing of components have created a need for higher cleanliness levels. Contamination {{in the level of}} monolayers can drastically alter surface properties such as wettability, adhesion, optical or electrical characteristics. To select an effective cleaning method the three essential factors to be considered such as cleaning chemistry, the scrubbing method and other process parameters. This study investigates the effectiveness of <b>brush</b> cleaning, ultrasonic cleaning and combination of <b>brush</b> and ultrasonic cleaning on removal of contamination, surface defects and <b>brush</b> life time. In this study, the cleaning efficiency was compared for the parts cleaned with ultrasonics, nylon <b>brush,</b> Poly Vinyl Alcohol (PVA) <b>brush</b> and combination of ultrasonics and nylon <b>brush.</b> The life time of <b>brush</b> was studied for both nylon and PVA <b>brush.</b> The techniques used to identify the contamination are SEM, EDX and optical microscope. The microscopic result indicates that the removal efficiency was high for the parts cleaned with ultrasonics (90. 5 %) and PVA <b>brush</b> (90. 2 %) as compared to Nylon <b>brush</b> (77. 4 %). This {{is due to the fact}} that for PVA <b>brush</b> the fluid was being pumped in and out of <b>brush</b> pores (during compression and elastic recovery of the <b>brush),</b> carries the contamination away from the surface and also the contact area between the contamination surface and <b>brush</b> was more. From Liquid Particle Count (LPC) analysis, the > 0. 3 mic particle counts is almost two times lower for parts cleaned with ultrasonics as compared to parts cleaned with <b>brushes.</b> This indicates that 58 / 132 kHz washing followed by 470 kHz DI rinsing effectively removes sub- micron particles from the surface compared to <b>brush</b> cleaning. The defects caused by <b>brushes</b> on the surface of the slider bar is almost 1 % for nylon <b>brush</b> cleaning, 0. 4 % for PVA <b>brush</b> cleaning and 0 % for ultrasonic cleaning. From experimental study, it can be seen that the life time of PVA <b>brush</b> was shorter than Nylon <b>brush</b> by 75 times. The contamination increased after 50 th run for PVA <b>brush</b> and after 700 th run for nylon <b>brush.</b> This is due to the fact that after <b>brush</b> damage (after 50 th run for PVA and 700 th run for nylon) the <b>brush</b> can not effectively remove the contamination and also re-deposition of contamination from <b>brush...</b>|$|R

50|$|A {{spring is}} {{typically}} {{used with the}} <b>brush,</b> to maintain constant contact with the commutator. As the <b>brush</b> and commutator wear down, the spring steadily pushes the <b>brush</b> downwards towards the commutator. Eventually the <b>brush</b> wears small and thin enough that steady contact {{is no longer possible}} or it is no longer securely held in the <b>brush</b> holder, and so the <b>brush</b> must be replaced.|$|R

50|$|A {{pinstriping}} <b>brush</b> is {{the tool}} of traditional free hand pinstripers use for pinstriping. Freehand pinstriping {{is the most}} difficult method of pinstriping and the <b>brush</b> is an important tool for design. Pinstriping <b>brushes</b> have several different designs, Swords, Daggers, and Flats, as well as Double line <b>brushes.</b> The <b>brush</b> consists of a small wood dowel handle, string or brass fixture with adhesive and <b>brush</b> hairs traditionally made from squirrel hair (confusingly called camel hair). The small wood dowel is balanced so pinstripers can freely spin the <b>brush</b> between their fingers. The dowel's short length is so the <b>brush</b> does not hit the palm of the hand while the <b>brush</b> is placed in-between the index finger and thumb. The hair of a pinstriping <b>brush</b> is relatively long at approximately 2 inches,or more, compared to most artistic <b>brushes</b> of a similar size. This long length is to hold the necessary amount of paint to pull a long line.|$|R
40|$|Polymer <b>brushes</b> are {{commonly}} used to modify the properties of solid surfaces. Here a family of polybasic poly(2 -(diethylamino) ethyl methacrylate) <b>brushes</b> have been grown using ARGET ATRP from a cationic macroinitiator adsorbed on two types of silica surfaces: QCM crystals and oxidised silicon wafers. The pH-response of these <b>brushes</b> is investigated {{as a function of}} <b>brush</b> thickness in a constant flow environment in order to focus on the intrinsic dynamics of the polymer <b>brushes.</b> Independent QCM-D and in situ ellipsometry kinetic studies demonstrate the swelling process of protonation and solvent uptake is typically eight times faster than the corresponding neutralisation and solvent expulsion from the collapsing <b>brush.</b> However, the maximum rate of these processes is independent of <b>brush</b> thickness. The initial pH response of the <b>brushes</b> is hysteretic due to <b>brush</b> entanglement, which once overcome allows highly reversible pH-induced conformational changes. Multiple pH cycles demonstrate that the viscoelastic nature of the swollen state relative to the collapsed <b>brush</b> is independent of <b>brush</b> thickness...|$|R
