5000|$|Some critics {{claim that}} <b>Beats</b> <b>products</b> {{emphasize}} appearance over quality and function, arguing that more durable and better-sounding products {{are available for}} the same price.Tests done on an HTC smartphone with Beats Audio indicated that the audio technology {{is a combination of}} audio equalization that boosts the low (bass) and high ends of the audio range, audio compression, and audio amplification. On accusations that Beats' products were [...] "bass heavy", Beats current president denies it, citing that their products are not for reference, but rather for playback.|$|R
5000|$|Playing off its design, initial {{marketing}} for the Pill used the tagline [...] "Just {{what the doctor}} ordered". As with other <b>Beats</b> <b>products,</b> the Pill was promoted primarily through celebrity endorsements and product placements in pop music videos, such as Britney Spears' [...] "Work Bitch", where the speaker {{is used as a}} ball gag on a dancer in a BDSM-themed scene. In April 2013, a limited edition, Nicki Minaj-branded pink version of the Pill was released, as introduced in her video for [...] "High School".|$|R
5000|$|Harmonically-related {{carriers}} (HRC) is {{a system}} for assigning television channel numbers to bands of frequencies over a cable TV network. William Grant, in his book, states:"By harmonically relating the carrier frequencies themselves it is … possible to improve system performance. This does not reduce the beats produced, but positions them within the system transmission spectrum, such {{that they are more}} tolerable. In effect, all signal carriers are spaced precisely at 6 MHz apart, and thus, all beats generated are at 6 MHz increments.""Since the television signals are vestigial sideband modulation, if the <b>beat</b> <b>products</b> can be manipulated to fall on or near the RF carriers themselves, they are much less offensive." ...|$|R
5000|$|Beats' {{original}} <b>product</b> line were <b>Beats</b> by Dr. Dre headphones. In promotional materials, Dr. Dre {{outlined the}} line's advantages by alleging that listeners {{were not able}} to hear [...] "all" [...] of the music with most headphones, and that Beats would allow people to [...] "hear what the artists hear, and listen to the music the way they should: the way I do." [...] In comparison to most headphones, <b>Beats</b> <b>products</b> were characterized by an emphasis towards producing larger amounts of bass, and are particularly optimized towards hip-hop and pop music. In October 2012, Beats unveiled its first two self-developed <b>products,</b> the <b>Beats</b> Executive noise-cancelling headphones (to compete with similar offerings by Bose and Sennheiser) and the Beats Pill portable speaker. In October 2015, Beats launched a new collection of speakers including the upgraded Beats Pill+ Speaker.|$|R
50|$|Released in 1994, HoTMetaL was {{the first}} {{commercial}} HTML authoring product. SoftQuad was able to <b>beat</b> other <b>products</b> to the market {{by virtue of the}} fact that HTML was defined as an application (Document Type Definition) of SGML. By virtue of this strong base and early lead, HoTMetaL became very popular as a tool for creating HTML web sites.|$|R
5000|$|In January 2015, Monster Inc. sued Beats for fraud, {{alleging that}} the company had used illicit tactics to force Monster out of the venture whilst {{retaining}} rights to the technologies and products that it had co-developed, and engaged in collusion to harm Monster's own audio products business. Monster argued that the acquisition of Beats by HTC and its founders' subsequent buyback was a [...] "sham" [...] to take control of Monster's stake in the company—which could have been valued at over $100 million in the Apple purchase, {{that the company had}} [...] "concealed" [...] the role of Monster and its CEO Noel Lee in the design and engineering of its products, and that [...] "had the partnership expired on its own terms, {{there would have been no}} transfer of Monster's years of work the company." [...] Monster also alleged that Beats had partaken in anti-competitive practices with retailers to force those offering <b>Beats</b> <b>products</b> to not offer Monster's competing products.|$|R

25|$|Each iPhone 7 {{comes with}} a Lightning-to-3.5-mm adapter. Apple sells the adapter {{independently}} as well. Apple also unveiled several Bluetooth wireless headphones ostensibly intended for use with iPhone 7, including AirPods, wireless in-ear headphones, and three new <b>Beats</b> headphone <b>products.</b> All four products utilize an in-house wireless chip known as Apple W1, {{which is designed to}} provide low-power Bluetooth operation and integration with iOS and macOS products (though they are still compatible with other Bluetooth-supported devices).|$|R
5000|$|On May 28, 2014, Apple officially {{announced}} {{its intention to}} acquire Beats Electronics for US$3 billion—with $400 million to be paid in Apple stock and the remainder in cash. Some reports suggested that the reduction in value {{may have been a}} result of lower-than-expected subscriber numbers for the Beats Music service. Iovine felt that Beats had always [...] "belonged" [...] with Apple, as the company modeled itself after Apple's [...] "unmatched ability to marry culture and technology." [...] In regard to the deal, Apple CEO Tim Cook stated that [...] "Music is such an important part of all of our lives and holds a special place within our hearts at Apple. That’s why we have kept investing in music and are bringing together these extraordinary teams so we can continue to create the most innovative music products and services in the world." [...] Beyond stocking <b>Beats</b> <b>products</b> at its retail outlets, Apple did not provide any further indications over how Beats would be integrated into its product line at the time, and whether Beats Music, which competed with Apple's own iTunes Radio service, would continue to operate after the finalization of the acquisition.|$|R
50|$|To promote its <b>products,</b> <b>Beats</b> {{primarily}} {{relied on}} endorsements by pop and hip-hop music performers, including product placement within music videos, and partnering with musicians and other celebrities to develop co-branded products. Beats' use of endorsements by musicians helped the company aggressively target the young adult demographics.|$|R

5000|$|In 1987, Masterplan (Quickmix, O-Jay, The A) {{released}} {{their first}} record [...] "We wanna be stars", on the Select Record Label. The record failed commercially but it formed O-Jay's {{entry into the}} music business. In collaboration with Quickmix, he started to produce the monthly Freshline Radio Show and published the first German Hip Hop Magazine, called Fresh <b>Beat</b> Magazine. Neither <b>product</b> lasted for long, because the two turned their focus on running their own label.|$|R
5000|$|The {{neologism}} [...] "hearable" [...] is {{a hybrid}} of the terms wearable and headphone, as hearables combine major assets of wearable technology with the basic principle of audio-based information services, conventional rendition of music and wireless telecommunication. The term was introduced in April 2014 simultaneously by Apple {{in the context of}} the company's acquisition of <b>Beats</b> Electronics and <b>product</b> designer and wireless application specialist Nick Hunn in a blogpost for a wearable technologies internet platform.|$|R
50|$|The QPACE {{supercomputer}} is {{a research}} project carried out by several academic institutions {{in collaboration with the}} IBM Research and Development Laboratory in Böblingen, Germany, and other industrial partners including Eurotech, Knürr, and Xilinx. The academic design team of about 20 junior and senior scientists, mostly physicists, came from the University of Regensburg (project lead), the University of Wuppertal, DESY Zeuthen, Jülich Research Centre, and the University of Ferrara. The main goal was the design of an application-optimized scalable architecture that <b>beats</b> industrial <b>products</b> in terms of compute performance, price-performance ratio, and energy efficiency. The project officially started in 2008. Two installations were deployed in the summer of 2009. The final design was completed in early 2010. Since then QPACE is used for calculations of lattice QCD. The system architecture is also suitable for other applications that mainly rely on nearest-neighbor communication, e.g., lattice Boltzmann methods.|$|R
50|$|The {{music video}} was filmed from June 10-12, 2014. It was {{directed}} by Chris Marrs Piliero. Having an intergalactic theme, Grande stated that the video {{was inspired by the}} 1968 sci-fi film Barbarella, the Star Wars series and space in general. The plot consists of Grande on a fictional planet renouncing her allegiance to an evil regime of extraterrestrials and freeing a group of prisoners from their cages. She subsequently attacks a giant robot using missiles, but the robot managed to release its hand to catch her, bringing her to the planet's overlord. Her character succeeds in defeating the villain, and the clip ends with Grande and the prisoners she rescued flying away in a spaceship, partying with the crew, as <b>Beats</b> by Dre <b>products</b> are visible in the scene. The song's producer Zedd makes an appearance.|$|R
5000|$|The {{company was}} {{formally}} established in 2006, {{a time when}} Iovine perceived two key problems in the music industry: the impact of piracy on music sales and the substandard audio quality provided by Apple's plastic earbuds. Iovine later recalled that Dre said to him: [...] "Man, it's one thing that people steal my music. It's another thing to destroy the feeling of what I've worked on." [...] Iovine sought the opinions of musicians with [...] "great taste", such as M.I.A., Pharrell Williams, will.i.am, and Gwen Stefani during the early developmental stage. Beats initially partnered with Monster Cable, an audio and video component manufacturer based in Brisbane, California, to manufacture and develop the first Beats-branded products, and debuted its first <b>product,</b> <b>Beats</b> by Dr. Dre Studio headphones, in late 2008. Since then Beats {{has come a long}} way, with many types including wireless.|$|R
50|$|Parker Brothers {{produced}} cartridge {{ports of}} Frogger for the Atari 2600, Intellivision, Atari 5200, ColecoVision, Atari 8-bit computers, Commodore VIC-20 and 64. Sierra released disk and/or tape ports for the C64 (which, as a result, {{ended up with}} {{two versions of the}} game), Apple II, the original 128k Macintosh, IBM PC, Atari 2600 Supercharger, as well as the above-mentioned versions for the TRS-80 Color Computer A version for Sinclair developed by UK-based Cornsoft. Parker Bros. spent $10 million on advertising Frogger, along with The Empire Strikes Back, larger than the $6 million marketing budget for a movie at the time. Parker Brothers sold three million cartridges of both Frogger and The Empire Strikes Back, with Frogger alone being the company's most successful first-year <b>product,</b> <b>beating</b> the sales and revenues of Merlin, its previous best-seller. Coleco also released stand-alone Mini-Arcade tabletop versions of Frogger, which, along with Pac-Man, Galaxian, and Donkey Kong, sold three million units combined.|$|R

40|$|Moving first-order stimuli and to {{combined}} first- and second-order stimuli {{in order}} to determine whether first-order motion processing was influenced by second-order motion. Beat stimuli were made by summing two gratings of similar spatial frequency, one of which was static and the other was moving. The <b>beat</b> is the <b>product</b> of a moving sinusoidal carrier (first-order motion) and a moving low-frequency contrast envelope (second-order motion). We compared responses to moving first-order gratings alone with responses to beat patterns with first-order and second-order motion {{in the same direction as}} each other, or in opposite directions to each other {{in order to}} distinguish first-order and second-order direction-selective responses. In the majority (72 %, 67 / 93) of cells (V 1 73 %, 45 / 62; V 2 70 %, 16 / 23; third visual complex 75 %, 6 / 8), responses to first-order motion were significantly influenced by the addition of a second-order signal. The second-order envelope was more influential when moving in the opposite direction to the first-order stimulus, reducing first-order direction sensitivity in V 1, V 2, and the third visual complex. We interpret these results as showing that first-order motion processing through early visual cortex is not separate from second-order motion processing; suggesting that both motion signals are processed by the same system...|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} a method to estimate the critical closing pressure (CrCP) of the cerebral circulation based on the intrinsic variability of arterial blood pressure (BP) around stable values of mean arterial pressure (MAP). A consecutive cohort of 33 premature newborns was studied at 6, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours of age. Cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) was measured with Doppler ultrasound in the middle cerebral artery and BP was recorded in the abdominal aorta or in a peripheral artery. Continuous measurements lasting five minutes were recorded on digital magnetic tape and signals were digitized {{at a rate of}} 200 samples/seconds for processing on a digital computer. Mean values of BP (mBP) and CBFV (mBV) were computed for each cardiac cycle and CrCP was determined as the pressure axis intercept of the regression line of mBV as a function of mBP using 100 sequential heart <b>beats.</b> The resistance-area <b>product</b> (RAP) was obtained from the slope of the regression line. For 57 records (30 patients) the mean +/- SD values of CrCP and RAP were 23. 9 +/- 11. 6 mmHg and 4. 07 +/- 1. 83 x 10 (4) kg. m- 2. s- 1, respectively. CrCP has a highly significant correlation with mean arterial pressure (p 0. 05) with PO 2, PCO 2, pH, haematocrit, gestational age, birthweight, postnatal age, heart rate on Pourcelot's resistance index. Our results suggest that cerebral perfusion pressure should be defined as MAP-CrCP for normal values of intracranial pressure. 7641...|$|R
40|$|Our {{paper is}} focused on the factors that {{influence}} innovation in small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in the Czech Republic. The country that went through long economic transformation that resulted in the set-up of the new improved standards for entrepreneurship activities is currently dealing with the after-math of world’s economic and financial crisis. With regard to all that, Czech SMEs are facing tough competition on domestic and EU markets. This is when innovations might become one of the key factors of success that can help to differentiate the <b>product,</b> <b>beat</b> the competition and attract more customers. Our study is based on the empirical model that employs the data from the survey questionnaire with 1144 Czech SMEs. We find several forms of innovations (e. g. own R&D, invest-ment into technology, improvement of quality of a product or service, or presence on foreign (EU and world) markets) can become very significant in enhancing the growth and success of Czech SMEs, while the bureaucratic barriers for innovations and external factors with negative impact did not come through as obstacles. Based on our results, one can state thatthe most important policy implications are for the relevant stakeholders would be the support of investment activities of SMEs, creation of SMEs clusters within business parks, education of employ-ees, expansions of Czech exports to the new markets, and inten-sive support of R&D. It would also make sense {{to increase the number of}} small SMEs (sole-traders and micro-enterprises) by making the registration process easier, or by offering subsidies or government support to the new companies and start-ups...|$|R
40|$|This paper aims at {{describing}} how firms can engage intermediaries {{in order to}} increase competitiveness. Competitiveness is intended as delivering superior quality <b>products,</b> <b>beating</b> the competitors and making a surplus (Porter, 1985). Firms are involved in changing environments (Siggelkow, 2001), and they need to react by acting on their design, innovation, and they need to react by innovation processes, distribution system and processes (Nadler and Tushman, 1997), in order to react and create value. Recent literature has argued that it can be achieved by involving the users in the innovative processes (Von Hippel, 1986). Specifically, it can be achieved by involving communities for new product development (Lilien et al., 2003), open – source software development (Bagozzi and Dholakia, 2006; Von Krogh and Von Hippel, 2003) and highly technological products (Jeppesen and Frederiksen, 2006), showing the importance of users as contributors to the innovative process, and suggesting their involvement {{as a consequence of the}} changes in business ecosystems (Iansiti and Levien, 2004). Research has shown that the business ecosystem of many industries has been widely reshaped by the fast development of new technologies, the spread of social networks and the diffusion of Internet connectivity (Brews and Tucci, 2003; Rothaermel and Sugiyama, 2001). This paper aims at answering the research question: is the network around a firm and its innovation a source of competitiveness? What factors and actors actually lead to a firm’s competitiveness? Specifically, changes in the competitive environment have provided users with faster and more effective ways to exchange knowledge and with increased possibilities to access communities respect to the past (Jeppesen and Frederiksen, 2006), leading to a not research field of the relations between network and competitiveness. Researchers in innovation field has highlighted that the diversification of the users constituting communities has increased, requiring companies to adopt various strategies for exploiting the knowledge that they exchange (Porter and Donthu, 2008). However, the full understanding of the drivers leading to be competitive by motivating the adoption of an innovation is still missing and it is difficult to understand how companies can leverage on their knowledge. The topic deserves further attention, in order to draw overarching conclusions on how companies from users’ interactions to enhance innovation (David and Shapiro, 2008) can increase their competitiveness. In this paper, we aim at providing an understanding of the topic, by analysing with an historical case study (1) how the community starts, (2) why users join the community and (3) how firms can be competitive by adopting a network approach. The community that constitutes our empirical setting is the 3 D printing. The 3 D printing communities involve users belonging to different groups, including initiators, sponsors, entrepreneurs and technology experts; this multifaceted portfolio of users calls companies for considering several aspects when exploring the reason of the success of the network around the innovation. By leveraging on the multi - dimensional connectedness of the 3 D printing community, we looked at the different interactions, trying to understand how to explain the process that such an innovation was adopted, adapted to local needs and became competitive.
