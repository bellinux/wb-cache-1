It is an enterprise {{department of the}} Municipality of Anchorage. As such, the Port is distinguished from other types of municipal departments largely because it generates enough revenue to support its operations without being a burden to Anchorage property tax payers, and it also pays a fee-in-lieu of taxes to help run city government.|$|R

50|$|A {{decade of}} surveys {{by dozens of}} {{domestic}} research and design departments {{have resulted in the}} construction of a 10-30 ton deep-water port in natural conditions. The harbour can rely on the deep-water advantages of an ocean port, with convenient collection and distribution facilities, and a flexible transport system, the construction of various types of container <b>berths,</b> <b>bulk</b> cargo <b>berths,</b> berths imported crude oil, ore transshipment berths, liquefied natural gas berths etc. Rich land and water resources have fueled the establishment of large-scale petrochemical, metallurgy, shipbuilding and other projects, to develop the port industry. With China's accession to the World Trade Organization, the western port hinterland of the Yangtze River Delta has increasingly attracted international capital as well as domestic investment, resulting in a demand for energy, raw materials and products in large quantities. There is an urgent demands for coastal port facilities, which provides excellent opportunities both for developers and around the Yangtze River estuary, and for foreign investors. After completion, the Yangtze River Ocean Port will become the anchor of further economic prosperity in Jiangsu, complementing the Shanghai international shipping center.|$|R
50|$|The port {{is planned}} to be {{developed}} in phases to meet the growing demand. In phase one, {{which is expected to}} be operational by 2018, the port will have three container berths equipped to handle more than 1.8 million TEUs, one <b>berth</b> for dry <b>bulk</b> and two <b>berths</b> for liquid cargo.|$|R
40|$|The loss of {{dust from}} the mining, processing, storage, handling, {{transportation}} and loading of bulk materials is creating {{an increasing number of}} problems for industry and the community. This includes loss of valuable material and export income, increasing workplace dust emissions (e. g. from mine sites, loading, receival, ports, <b>bulk</b> <b>berths)</b> and decreasing ambient air quality and human health, especially for nearby communities. It is virtually impossible to estimate the total cost of these problems to industry and the community. An initial key step in addressing dust problems is to quantify the dustiness or dustability of bulk materials. This paper examines three different methods for testing dustiness. The first two methods are the rotating drum style dustiness testers {{that can be used to}} determine the Dust Extinction Moisture (DEM) for a bulk solid. They are the Australian standard AS 4156. 6 2 ̆ 2 Determination of Dust/moisture Relationship for Coal [1] and the International standard I. S. EN 15051 2 ̆ 2 Measurement of the Dustiness of Bulk Materials - Requirements and Reference Test Methods 2 ̆ 2 [2]. The third method is simulating conveyor belt conditions in a wind tunnel to determine dust pick-up or lift-off velocity. All three methods can be useful tools in the design of new plant and also the modification of existing plant to reduce dust generation...|$|R
