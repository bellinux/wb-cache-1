This paper examines how widely adopted certain <b>best</b> <b>practices</b> are, if the adoptions show any pattern in terms of being simultaneously adopted within organizations, and what impact these <b>best</b> <b>practices</b> have on NPD performance. The main assumption {{of this study is that}} widely diffused <b>best</b> <b>practices</b> will lead to greater NPD effectiveness and more successful products. We developed an inventory of <b>best</b> <b>practices</b> related to NPD, and an empirical survey was administered to 39 companies. Our results indicate that <b>best</b> <b>practices</b> associated with enhancing the human resources involved in NPD, and improving the fuzzy front end of NPD appear to be getting little attention to date, despite a strong call for such attention in the management literature. Best practices associated with the strategic implementation of NPD (project selection, goals, technological leadership, product strategy, and customer involvement) are on average all more widely adopted than <b>best</b> <b>practices</b> associated with controlling the execution of NPD (process control, metrics, documentation, change control).

The literature broadly investigates the impacts of benchmarking service excellence <b>best</b> <b>practices</b> from the hospitality industry to the healthcare industry. In response to various calls from the literature, this study goes beyond the mere benchmarking of <b>best</b> <b>practices</b> and seeks to understand if those <b>best</b> <b>practices</b> can be successfully transferred from a hospitality environment into an existing healthcare environment. This study highlights the factors that enabled the introduction, transfer, and implementation of The Ritz-Carlton service excellence <b>best</b> <b>practices</b> into the existing environment of Memorial Regional Medical Center. It reviews a number of frameworks in the change management and transfer of <b>best</b> <b>practices</b> literatures, and it leverages a qualitative approach featuring individual interviews and focus groups interviews {{with a range of}} different employees in the hospital to better understand the impact that the service excellence change had on them and their work environment.

5|$|In 1992, {{members of}} the European Union signed the Maastricht Treaty, under which they pledged to limit their deficit {{spending}} and debt levels. However, in the early 2000s, some EU member states were failing {{to stay within the}} confines of the Maastricht criteria and turned to securitising future government revenues to reduce their debts and/or deficits, sidestepping <b>best</b> <b>practice</b> and ignoring international standards. This allowed the sovereigns to mask their deficit and debt levels through a combination of techniques, including inconsistent accounting, off-balance-sheet transactions, and the use of complex currency and credit derivatives structures. From late 2009 on, after Greece's newly elected, PASOK government stopped masking its true indebtedness and budget deficit, fears of sovereign defaults in certain European states developed in the public, and the government debt of several states was downgraded. The crisis subsequently spread to Ireland and Portugal, while raising concerns about Italy, Spain, and the European banking system, and more fundamental imbalances within the eurozone.|$|E

In this study, the NASA heritage programs such as Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, and the Space Shuttle program were examined. A series of lessons learned during the NASA and DoD heritage programs are captured. The processes that "make the right structural system" are examined along with the processes to "make the structural system right". The impact of technology advancements in materials and analysis and testing methods on reliability and robustness of spacecraft structures is studied. The <b>best</b> <b>practices</b> and lessons learned are extracted from these studies. Since the first human space flight, the <b>best</b> <b>practices</b> for reliable and robust spacecraft structures appear to be well established, understood, and articulated by each generation of designers and engineers.

40|$|This {{research}} investigates {{management practices}} {{that have the}} potential to enhance productivity in building projects by focusing on construction methods. In phase 1 of the study, face-to-face interviews with nineteen experts were conducted to identify the <b>best</b> management <b>practices</b> for construction methods. The qualitative data analysis reached saturation and resulted in a list of <b>best</b> <b>practices</b> for construction methods that are relevant to the local industry. The second phase used an industry-wide survey to prioritize the <b>best</b> <b>practices.</b> Accordingly, project start-up plan, traffic control plan, machinery positioning strategy, project completion plan, and dynamic site layout plan were shown to be the top five <b>best</b> <b>practices</b> for construction methods. The study also revealed that high levels of implementation of <b>best</b> <b>practices</b> are associated with low levels of project delays. The use of <b>best</b> <b>practices</b> also varied according to the project costs. There were no discernible differences between the top five <b>best</b> <b>practices.</b> The authors suggest that they should be implemented jointly to improve productivity in building projects. Contractors could use the logistic regression model developed, to predict the probability of exceeding a baseline productivity factor and, on that basis, implement corrective actions to achieve the desired level of productivity. ...|$|R
