40|$|Pathological skin picking is a {{condition}} in which patients induce skin lesions through repetitive, compulsive excoriations of normal skin or skin with minor surface irregularities and they admit their role in the production of the lesions, but are unable to stop their behavior. Psychiatric comorbidities most often associated with skin picking include obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), anxiety <b>disorders,</b> mood <b>disorders,</b> <b>body</b> <b>dysmorphic</b> <b>disorders,</b> trichotillomania and compulsive-buying disorder. We report the case of a 17 year old female patient who addressed the dermatology department of our hospital with an eruption consisting of erythematous papules and plaques.

40|$|Representation of {{the body}} is a nuclear aspect of self-image. Body {{representation}} includes both subjective and intersubjective experiences. The importance of visual body representation in our social life is demonstrated by the time we spend {{to take care of our}} physical appearance, including use of plastic surgery, as well as by the severe mental disorders associated to its alteration, including eating <b>disorders</b> (EDs) and <b>body</b> <b>dysmorphic</b> <b>disorders.</b> In spite of these issues, (neuro) psychological research on body representation has so far mainly focused on the body as a motor device, devoted to the perception of and interaction with objects. The complexity of factors involved in the development, maintenance, and plasticity of body image representations requires an integrated approach that facilitates the evaluation and treatment of EDs with novel, evidence-based, and more efficacious protocols.

40|$|Background The {{article titled}} ‘Muscle dysmorphia: Could it be {{classified}} as an addiction to body image?’ used Griffiths (2005) addiction components model as the framework in which to define muscle dysmorphia (MD) as an addiction. The authors (Foster, Shorter 2 ̆ 6 Griffiths, 2014) proposed that MD could be re-classified as an addiction to body image. Method and aim In response to the original article, {{the author of this}} commentary reflected on the ‘Addiction to body image’ model and the components of addiction as described in the context of MD. This invited commentary aimed to provide opposing viewpoints in order to give a balanced overview on the topic. Results It appears as if the components of addictions {{can be used as a}} framework in which to define MD. However, systematic empirical evidence had not been provided for the withdrawal symptoms associated with this behavioral addiction. An opposing viewpoint is provided in response to Foster et al. ’s (2014) statement that MD is different from other <b>body</b> <b>dysmorphic</b> <b>disorders</b> in regards to cognitive dysfunction, and therefore cannot be explained in the same way. Conclusions Based on the little systematic empirical evidence to date, it may be a bit premature to re-classify MD as an addiction to body image...|$|R
40|$|Background Treatment of {{patients}} with severe congenital facial disfigurements is aimed at restoring an aesthetic and functional balance. Besides an adequate level of satisfaction, an individual's acceptance of facial appearance is important to achieve because nonacceptance is thought to lead to daily psychological struggles. This study objectified the prevalence of nonacceptance among adult patients treated for their severe facial clefts, evaluated risk factors, and developed a screening tool. Methods The study included 59 adults with completed treatment for their severe facial cleft. All the patients underwent a semistructured in-depth interview and filled out the Body Cathexis Scale. Results Nonacceptance of facial appearance was experienced by 44 % of the patients. Of the nonaccepting patients, 72 % experienced difficulties in everyday activities related to their appearance versus 35 % of the accepting patients. Acceptance did not correlate with objective severity or bullying in the past. Risk factors for nonacceptance were high self-perceived visibility, a troublesome puberty period, and an emotion-focused coping strategy. Also, the presence of functional problems was shown to be highly associated. Conclusions The objective severity of the residual deformity did not correlate with the patients' acceptance of their facial appearance, but the self-perceived visibility did correlate. The process of nonacceptance resembles the process seen in patients with <b>body</b> <b>dysmorphic</b> <b>disorders.</b> Surgical treatment is no guarantee for an improvement in acceptance and is therefore discouraged for patients who match the risk factors for nonacceptance unless it solves a functional problem. The authors therefore recommend screening patients for nonacceptance and considering psychological treatment before surgery is performed.

40|$|An {{important}} frontier in {{the scientific}} study of meditation is to go beyond studying the global training effects of single practices to explore whether different meditative practices have specific, differentiated effects. Here we compare the day-to-day reports of 180 participants (mean age 41, age range 20 to 55, 61 % female) in a 9 -month long mental training study, the ReSource Project. Participants were asked to meditate 5 times a week, using guided recordings provided online. Before and after each meditation session, questions assessed affect, warmth, thought contents, meta-cognitive abilities, present-focus, and body awareness. Using multilevel modeling to analyze a total of almost 29, 000 daily reports representing over 10, 000 hours of meditation, we found that the four core meditations were characterized by specific patterns of experience. All four practices were characterized by increased positive affect and energy, a greater experience of presence and body awareness, and an improved ability to detach from thoughts. Practicing body scan led to the greatest increase in body awareness and the greatest decrease in thought content. Loving-kindness practice increased feelings of warmth and positive thoughts. Observing thoughts increased meta-cognitive awareness of mental activities. These findings suggest that although different types of meditation may share joint experiences, each practice also comes with distinct psychological fingerprint. The observed differences among the practices carry significant implications for the use of meditation as an applied intervention. For example, the body scan seems best suited to cultivate body awareness and may be useful for treatment of <b>body</b> <b>dysmorphic</b> <b>disorders.</b> Loving kindness is better able to improve positive affect and thoughts, and thus may be an appropriate therapy for depression or anxiety. Observing thoughts, in contrast, may be preferred if the focus is to increase awareness of the contents of mind without changing that content, as in some forms of cognitive-based therapy...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} how slimming advertisements work to frame slimness {{as the ideal}} female beauty. To investigate this issue, this study undertakes to analyze two sources of data: slimming advertisements (100 print advertisements altogether) and interviews (40 sets of transcription). The following research questions guide {{the development of this}} investigation: 1) How is the ideal female body textually constructed in the selected slimming advertisements? 2) How is the ideal female body visually constructed in the selected slimming advertisements? 3) In what ways are women influenced by the ideology of the ideal female body? Fairclough’s (1995 a) three-dimensional conception of discourse is used to see the relationship between three levels of a particular communicative event: discourse-as-text, discourse-as-discursive practice and discourse-as-social practice. This analytical framework helps in answering the research questions. The first level deals with discourse-as-text. The thesis examines how multimodal resources are used in slimming advertisements to construct the ideal female body through language and visuals. The linguistic analysis focuses on the lexical choices which are related to the construction of ideal female body. As for the visual analysis, the images related to the ideal female body are examined using the analytical framework of visual social semiotics (Kress and van Leeuwen, 1996). The second level deals with discourse-as-discursive practice. Here the study deals with the consumption of text in terms of how the respondents are influenced by the ideology of the ideal female body as portrayed in the slimming advertisements. Finally, the level of discourse-as-sociocultural practice is discussed based on the findings in all the three research questions. The ways the slimming advertisements promote the ideology of the ideal female body are seen in the light of sociocultural practices that play the key roles in maintaining, disseminating and propagating the ideology behind the ideal female body. The findings of this study demonstrate that these advertisements offer proof of how slimness is a part of a sociocultural system of representation where female beauty is limited to images of women that focus on the slim ideal. It is part of a sociocultural system in which the ideal female beauty is constructed as a young, slender and shapely body. It is also consolidated into a system of belief that objectifies women and dictates how women should look or not look like. Women are expected to measure up to the social expectations of how they should look like. This is done by constructing, promoting and sustaining false beauty needs. This beauty ideology and belief system, as seen in the interviews, has been internalized by most of the Malaysian women. This study, therefore, is timely and significant as it shows how this ideal female body is a social construction. By examining the ideal female body image from the linguistic and visual social semiotics lens as well as supported with interview data, the integration of different tools of enquiry provides insights into the possible causes leading to <b>body</b> <b>dysmorphic</b> <b>disorders.</b> It is hoped that by highlighting this issue, women will learn not be too gullible to fall prey easily to the ‘promises’ of the slimming products and services. This can help Malaysian women to be aware of these false advertising claims and to challenge the prevailing notions of slimness and beauty. This research also hopes to create awareness and a constructive ‘suspicion’ of all processes of text interpretation, in the particular context, the slimming advertisements...|$|R
