40|$|Based on the {{experience}} of budget management reforms that have been introduced {{over the last two decades}} in a large number of member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) it is not uncommon to find emerging market economies moving toward performance-based budgeting where measures of performance play a key role. While it might be tempting for middle income countries to press forward to adopt a full-blown outputs and outcomes framework, there are some risks in the move. Such a change in orientation is only possible once managers have had adequate experience in refining the definition of programs and their objectives, and on this basis developing a comprehensive system of performance measurement. It is argued in this paper that to develop a comprehensive performance measurement system requires resolving a number of issues involved in clearly defining how to measure "performance" as well as overcoming a number of technical issues in the design and use of measures of that "performance. " However, perhaps the most critical step is introducing a system whereby performance information can influence resource allocation decisions, i. e., establishing a performance management system. Based on international experience, this paper reviews each of these hurdles in moving toward a performance management framework.

This report {{provides}} new evidence on whether students perform better in school systems that have such institutional measures in place. We implement an internationally comparative approach within a rigorous micro-econometric framework that accounts for the influences of a large set of student, family, school, and country characteristics. The student-level data used in the analysis comes from the PISA 2003 international student achievement test that encompasses up to 265, 000 students from 37 countries. Our results reveal that different facets of accountability, autonomy, and choice are strongly associated with the level of student achievement across countries. With respect to accountability, students perform better where policies are in place that aim at students (external exit exams), teachers (monitoring of lessons), and schools (assessment-based comparisons). The combined achievement differences amount to more than one and a half PISA grade-level equivalents.

30|$|In this regard, {{the public}} {{resources}} that governments allocate to universities {{have been a}} subject of debate both within universities and outside of them. This is especially interesting {{in the case of}} Argentina, due to the idiosyncratic organizational characteristics of the higher education system: institutional <b>autonomy,</b> <b>budget</b> autarky, unrestricted admission with tuition fees fully subsidized and poor quality evaluation. Thereby, this institutional autonomy allows universities to focus on teaching or research activities, centred their attention to a particular field (i.e. specialist universities vs. comprehensive universities), establish them own characteristics of professors, and choose organization structure (departmental or by schools) among others. These conditions could make easy to identify the most efficient resource management models within them (Johnes and Yu 2008). Efficiency studies in higher education institutions using nonparametric in the literature, however, are scarce for Latin America in general and for Argentina specifically. This situation is surprising, especially in view of the peculiarities of the university systems in the region (systems with a prevailing participation of the State in the funding mechanisms).|$|R

40|$|After {{a series}} of {{sophisticated}} studies on the interface between bureaucracy and electoral institutions, Dan Wood, and Dan Wood along with Rick Waterman, concluded {{that it had been}} established that electoral institutions can control the bureaucracy, and research was now needed to move to the more interesting questions about what factors facilitate or limit this control. Since this call to arms, little progress has been made, probably because taking Wood's proposal seriously requires an extensive data set that measures a wide range of variables such as bureaucratic expertise, external political support for the bureaucracy, political preferences, clientele support, <b>budget</b> <b>autonomy,</b> and incentives, among others. Using a unique data set of over 1000 public organizations, plus an interrupted time-series assessment of political control that is analogous to those used by Wood, this paper systematically tests several hypotheses about political control of the bureaucracy. All other things being equal, theory suggests that one would expect political control to be enhanced when a) bureaucrats share values with politicos; b) organizations exhibit relatively less cohesion, leadership, technical expertise, and external political support; and c) organizations are small, less complicatedly bureaucratic, and centralized.

40|$|The term “federalism” {{does not}} have a clear meaning: it must be {{specifically}} defined in the context in which it will be applied it. Regarding the Italian case, this definition {{can be found in the}} Fiscal Federalism Delegation Act (FFDA), Law of 5 th May 2009, No. 42 (FFDA), which specifies the rules contained in Article 119 of the Italian Constitution, Paragraphs 1 - 5. The rules in question are to be implemented through an extensive series of decrees. The main objective which is indicated and that, therefore, should be pursued, is stated in Para. 1 of Art. 119 : it is necessary to ensure “local governments’ financial autonomy of revenues and expenditures”. To achieve this autonomy in practice and apply it to all Sub-Central Governments (SCGs), the financial system which will be implemented should ensure the availability of a resources level likely to “fully finance the public functions” attributed to these institutions (Art. 2, Para. 2, Let. e) of the FFDA). Furthermore, it is also necessary that the system applies “an appropriate degree of fiscal flexibility” to ensure that all institutions, including those in the lowest fiscal capacity, have a sufficient <b>budget</b> <b>autonomy.</b> In this paper, we want to demonstrate how a system based on additional taxes to personal income tax (that is called IRPEF in Italy), as it is foreseen by these decrees, and which is not corrected by monetary compensations for the fiscal effort, violates the fiscal flexibility principle, and also jeopardizes the financial sustainability of the reform, thereby increasing the gaps between the different macro-areas and the overall deterioration of macroeconomic management capacity. ...|$|E
40|$|Fiscal {{decentralization}} in Indonesia {{had been}} a slow-burning affair since the mid 1970 s, with the country {{being one of the}} most centralized in the world, until the “Big Bang” of the 1999 reforms, when, in the period of one year, Indonesia became in terms of expenditure shares one of the most decentralized in the world. This paper first reviews the structure and performance of this new system of transfers in Indonesia and then focuses on the unfinished agenda for reform. The discussion concentrates on the DAU, which finances over three-fourths of subnational expenditures. The short story with the development of the equalization grant or DAU in Indonesia is that the Government in 2001 got the fundamental concepts right but got many of the particular details wrong. The performance of the DAU in addition was hindered by several choices made on the implementation of the new system, the most important being an extremely rigid interpretation of the hold harmless provision. The Government has proceeded to reform the DAU for 2002. Although real improvements took place in 2002, some important issues still remain, including how the new system may move away from the suffocating grip of the hold harmless provision. The government faces important challenges but also good opportunities in shaping and increasing the importance of the DAK conditional grant system. With respect to transfers in the form of revenue sharing on a derivation basis, where the central government shares revenues with the subnational governments where the revenues have been collected or derived, this paper recommends that government not develop it further but instead focuses on developing revenue autonomy of subnational governments. To answer how has Indonesia’s new transfer system performed so far this paper addresses more specific issues of: has <b>budget</b> <b>autonomy</b> been preserved, has revenue adequacy for provinces and district/municipalities been maintained, have transfers been stable, has the current system of transfers been reasonable, transparent, and simple, have transfers discouraged subnational tax effort, and have transfers been equalizing?fiscal decentralization, Indonesia...|$|E

Results show that the government supplies conducive environments for interagency working relationships. Three key factors determine resource contributions by the agencies involved in the control and prevention of HIV/AIDS i. e. the depth of the relationship,. the similarity of agency's core missions to HIV/AIDS, and the resource interdependencies of the agencies.

40|$|Using a {{conventional}} model, this paper examines {{the conditions under}} which it is possible to stabilise both the output (inflation) cycle and the budget deficit/surplus of a regional economy in a wider currency union. We find that it is never possible. But we can approximate that result (for example, by limiting budgetary instability when the cycle is smoothed) if the product and labour markets are suitably flexible. Conversely, if fiscal policy is restricted, output and inflation volatility will be extended unless all shocks are supply shocks, compared to the case where there is some fiscal autonomy. Attempts at stabilisation in this situation would lead to an unstable political equilibrium. These results are important because they show what can be expected from fiscal restraints like the Stability Pact or tax harmonisation in the Eurozone; and from fiscal autonomy at the subnational level in older unions. Calibrating the results for the EU and UK respectively, we find that denying autonomy to the regions of the UK might be rather costly in terms of performance.

This study brings to fore the systemic barriers, their frequency of occurrence and magnitude. This study aimed at identifying the challenges that affect the effectiveness of these anti-corruption institutions in Ghana. The study was purposely carried out within anti-corruption institutions in Ghana. A simple random probability sampling was employed in sampling nine (9) anti-corruption institutions in the Ashanti Region of Ghana and questionnaires administered to their administrative heads. Relative importance, frequency and severity equations were used to analyze and rank the challenges affecting the work of these institutions. Lack of political will and inadequate leadership and management with Relative importance Index RII of 0. 9778 respectively were the two (2) most critical challenges affecting the effectiveness of anti-corruption institutions in Ghana. Lack of donor initiatives with RII of 0. 6667 was considered as the least challenge. The most frequent challenge identified by the anti-corruption agencies was the lack of <b>budget</b> and fiscal <b>autonomy,</b> with an index of 0. 8148. In the face of these challenges, the government of Ghana should improve upon its efforts at fighting corruption as it strengthens the various anti-corruption institutions financially and logistically...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this article is to examine the main {{underlying}} social values that define health policy decisions. We focus on LMICs, many of which are at an early stage of implementation of these evidence-based policy processes. This review aimed at analyzing the ethical and procedural principles that underlie these social values, their potential conflict and the challenges of implementing a decision-making process according to these values in LMIC. Methods: Broad scoping search of international literature (December 2012) in PubMed, Cinahl, ISI Web of knowledge, Cochrane Library, and ProQuest. Search terms were “social values”, “healthcare/ health” and “low and middle income countries” (terms adapted according to each database). There was no pre-defined limit of year or language. We excluded “grey literature” documents only. From a total of 252 hits, we finally selected and fully read 51 of them. Results: The translation of health policy decisions from high-income countries to LMICs is complex, as they have differences that might affect the expected outcomes. Decisions should primarily aim at improving population health. The measurement of socioeconomic status and social inequalities in health, which is also context-specific, it is another primary objective in decisions about healthcare policies. Autonomy and equity might conflict in scenarios of limited <b>budget.</b> However, individual <b>autonomy</b> should be limited when affects other´s individuals autonomy and social welfare. Evidence and transparency in the decision process is highly valued, and expenditure in information for decision-making should be promoted since it increases population health. Conclusion: High-quality research evidence is paramount to implement health policies consistent with social values and the resources needed to produce relevant evidence can be considered a good use of public resources. A framework for decision-making should be anchored at least in three first order social values, improvement of population health, improving equity (in access to healthcare and health) and transparency...|$|R
40|$|Society {{has changed}} {{sustainably}} {{and universities have}} thus faced new requirements. As a result of competition and globalization, education and knowledge management had to be adapted. Universities were forced to establish a modern management system primarily known {{from the private sector}} and governments had to reconsider their legal and economic relationship to universities. In recent years, many countries have implemented new rules for their universities. Two of these countries were Austria and Switzerland. But even when they pursued the same goals, they have chosen quite different approaches {{and as a matter of}} fact achieved very differing results. The objective of this study was twofold. Firstly, we analyzed the challenges and contradictions when implementing a modern university model. Secondly, we investigated specific characteristics of the university systems of Austria and Switzerland to identify factors that may have impacted the performance and success of the universities. Referring to our first objective, a literature review has revealed severe contradictions between modern university management and the traditional understanding of it. While the traditional scheme has focused mainly on research, teaching is becoming more relevant in the new demand orientated university. Also, the freedom of science and teaching is limited by the strong orientation on goals that have been agreed upon with the government. Further contradictions can be identified in <b>autonomy,</b> <b>budgeting,</b> leadership, hierarchy, and employee participation. To examine the second research aim, we reviewed national and international databases and reports. Our results emphasize the importance of monetary aspects, the student-teacher-ratio, autonomy, and the relevance of the universities’ reputation and acceptance within society and politics. Our findings can help to understand the different approaches which have been chosen to cope with global changes in higher education. They might serve as basis for decision-making in higher education policy...|$|R
