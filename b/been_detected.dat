5|$|In humans, APOA5 is {{expressed}} {{almost exclusively in}} the liver tissue; some minor expressions have also <b>been</b> <b>detected</b> in the small intestine. Nothing {{is known about the}} existence of the potential alternative splicing variants of this gene. In comparison with other apolipoproteins, plasma concentration of APOA5 is very low (less than 1 μg/mL). This suggests that it has more catalytic than structural functions, since there is less than one APOA5 molecule per one lipoprotein particle. APOA5 is associated predominantly with TG-rich lipoproteins (chylomicrons and VLDL) and has also <b>been</b> <b>detected</b> on HDL particles.|$|E
5|$|Magnetic fields have <b>been</b> <b>detected</b> in {{the space}} around just about every class of {{celestial}} object. Star formation in spiral galaxies can generate small-scale dynamos, generating turbulent magnetic field strengths of around 5–10μG. The Davis–Greenstein effect causes elongated dust grains to align themselves with a galaxy's magnetic field, resulting in weak optical polarization. This {{has been used to}} show ordered magnetic fields exist in several nearby galaxies. Magneto-hydrodynamic processes in active elliptical galaxies produce their characteristic jets and radio lobes. Non-thermal radio sources have <b>been</b> <b>detected</b> even among the most distant, high-z sources, indicating the presence of magnetic fields.|$|E
