40|$|We {{study how}} {{changing}} sectoral composition in employment and output shares affects aggregate growth by modeling a two-sector economy with a technologically "progressive" industry, which produces for consumption and investment, and a technologically "stagnant" industry producing only for consumption. Hence, unbalanced improvements in {{total factor productivity}} interact with changes {{in the composition of}} final demand in shaping the growth process. Within this endogenous growth framework, we show under what conditions on preferences Baumol's asymptotic stagnancy occurs. <b>Beside</b> <b>studying</b> the limiting behavior of the economy, numerical examples are presented to analyze the structural change going on along the transition path. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} dynamic {{framework}} for modeling and forecasting of realized covariance matrices using vine copulas {{to allow for}} more flexible dependencies between assets. Our model automatically guarantees positive definiteness of the forecast {{through the use of}} a Cholesky decomposition of the realized covariance matrix. We explicitly account for long-memory behavior by using ARFIMA and HAR models for the individual elements of the decomposition. Furthermore, our model incorporates non-Gaussian innovations and GARCH effects, accounting for volatility clustering and unconditional kurtosis. The dependence structure between assets is studied using vine copula constructions, which allow for nonlinearity and asymmetry without suffering from an inflexible tail behavior or symmetry restrictions as in conventional multivariate models. <b>Beside</b> <b>studying</b> in-sample properties, we assess the usefulness of our method in a one-day ahead forecasting framework, comparing recent types of models for the realized covariance matrix. In Value-at-Risk (VaR) forecasting, vine models require less capital requirements due to smoother and more accurate forecasts. Further, we evaluate the model performance by a model confidence set approach based on point forecasts...|$|E
40|$|This {{overview}} {{is devoted}} to two composers born in the Austro-Hungarian monarchy who beside their Slovene origin, share the tragic fate caused by syphilis-related progressive paralysis. The music opus of Hugo Wolf (Slovenj Gradec, 1860 – Vienna, 1903) consists of about 300 solo songs on the verses {{of the most famous}} contemporary poets, numerous piano works, the symphonic poem “Penthesilea”, and the opera “Der Corregidor”. Dr. Josip Ipavec ([entjur near Celje, 1873 - 1921), <b>beside</b> <b>studying</b> medicine, also worked on improving his theoretical knowledge in the field of music. Later on, as a qualified physician, he also conducted choral concerts and string orchestras. Ipavec {{is also the author of}} numerous successful solo- and choir songs, piano compositions, and the first Slovene ballet, the “Pierrot” (1904). His most famous work is the opera (operetta) “The Frivolous Princess” (1911). Both composers died deranged, alone, neglected, “away from the eye”. Wolf ended in a straitjacket at a psychiatric hospital, Ipavec froze to death in a barn not far from his home, both at an age when their creativity should have been at its peak...|$|E

The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate the effects of pause size and pause number on egg mass in White Leghorn during the first 100 day before onset of laying the first egg. General Linear Model (GLM) within SAS program was used to study the effect of some fixed effects which included (hatch and age at sexual maturity) on pause size and pause number <b>beside</b> <b>studying</b> the effect of hatch, weight at sexual maturity, pause size and pause number on egg mass.

The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the prevalence of risky behaviours among the studied students, to assess their relation with sociodemographic factors and psychological problems and to explore student's attitude toward these behaviours. The data were collected by a standardized interviewing form. Different psychological symptoms were assessed using Middle Sex Hospital Questionnaire. The study showed, 54. 1 % of the students were having unhealthy diet and tobacco smoking behaviours. Also, all the risky behaviours, except absence of physical exercise practice and suicide attempt, were more common among boys. The most important sociodemographic risk factors were; positive family history of risky behaviours, one parent family and the student's work <b>beside</b> <b>studying</b> (OR= 7. 11, 4. 07 and 3. 37, respectively). The most important reasons for unhealthy diet, carrying weapon and engagement in casual sex were imitation (55. 2 %), to feel grown up (47. 1 %) and peer pressure (39. 1 %), respectively. While, the most common psychological problem was hysteria (15. 1 %) and the most common neurotic trait was sadness (41. 9 %). The most important psychological problems risk factors were obsession and hysteria (OR= 5. 53 and 4. 59, respectively).

40|$|The {{international}} project, Very Large Scale Photovoltaic (VLS-PV), {{is considered}} one of the international promising projects that discuss the potentials for developing the world's desert by using large scale Photovoltaic plants. Urban-scale photovoltaic applications have been sponsored by the International Energy Agency (IEA) and discussed through Photovoltaic Power System Program (PVPS) through Task 10 in 2004, in addition studying the use of photovoltaic services for developing countries through Task 9 started in 1999. The tasks aim to improve the utilization of PV systems in the urban environment, as part of the global trends for maximizing building energy efficiency by using renewable energy systems. Studying the feasibility of VLS-PV projects for developing the deserts in Egypt and other Middle-East countries, has a wide interest in research activities through the last years, specially studying of the urban and architectural infrastructure for the proposed VLS-PV community and feasibility in the Egyptian desert, <b>beside</b> <b>studying</b> of socio-economic, energy, and developmental constituents of desert communities.
