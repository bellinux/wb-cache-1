5000|$|Thirteen {{miles to}} the west is Brown Point, {{commonly}} known as [...] "The Bluff" [...] or [...] "Bluff Beach", where the <b>boat</b> <b>winching</b> system is a tourist attraction.|$|R
5000|$|With March 2016 the {{acquired}} companies Ned-Deck Marine, Dreggen and Norwegian Deck Machinery (NDM) {{have been}} integrated under on umbrella brand and one corporate logo [...] "Palfinger Marine".The product portfolio now consists of Marine and Offshore Cranes, Davit Systems (former Launch and Recovery Systems), <b>Boats,</b> <b>Winches,</b> Lifting and Handling Equipment, Bulk and Bunker Handling Equipment and Wind Cranes. Palfinger Marine {{has become a}} supplier for deck equipment and handling solutions for the whole maritime industry.|$|R
5000|$|Brown Point {{with its}} <b>boat</b> <b>winching</b> system is unique, {{and is a}} proven tourist attraction. Photographs of these [...] "Davits" [...] are {{exhibited}} nationally in tourist and travel agencies and also on souvenirs and post cards. The manual winching method for raising and lowering boats from cliff to water {{with the aid of}} stable uprights, cables and supports, was introduced by George Parsons and Fred Schwarz in the 1920s and it {{has proved to be a}} very assured and convenient way of safe guarding a craft in bad weather over the years. Today the fibreglass boat has replaced the clinker or wooden boat on account of easy maintenance etc. and trailers have replaced the winching system.|$|R
50|$|Historically, {{the main}} sources of income for the village include fishing and lace production. <b>Boats</b> are <b>winched</b> up the beach {{as there is no}} harbour, and fresh fish is sold nearby. Nowadays small {{electrically}} driven winches using steel cables or tractors are located on the beach to haul boats in. Higher up is an old manual capstan operated by up to 20 men, now disused.|$|R

50|$|Lining {{involved}} {{running a}} rope, called a line or a steel cable to a secure point on shore, typically a large tree or a bolt specially {{set in a}} rock, and then wrapping the cable around a steam-powered <b>winch</b> on the <b>boat.</b> The <b>winch</b> would then crank in the cable, if the vessel was going upstream, or gradually let out the cable, if the vessel was headed downstream.|$|R
25|$|In the 1920s, {{diesel engine}} were adapted {{for use in}} shrimp <b>boats.</b> Power <b>winches</b> were {{connected}} to the engines, and only small crews were needed to rapidly lift heavy nets on board and empty them. Shrimp boats became larger, faster, and more capable. New fishing grounds could be explored, trawls could be deployed in deeper offshore waters, and shrimp could be tracked and caught round the year, instead of seasonally as in earlier times. Larger boats trawled offshore and smaller boats worked bays and estuaries. By the 1960s, steel and fibreglass hulls further strengthened shrimp boats, so they could trawl heavier nets, and steady advances in electronics, radar, sonar, and GPS resulted in more sophisticated and capable shrimp fleets.|$|R
40|$|Máster en Gestión Sostenible de Recursos Pesqueros[EN] The {{development}} {{experienced by}} the artisanal fishery, taking place at the Gran Canarian waters is being analyzed through the technological improvements introduced in the fishing gear and vessels, throughout the past decades. This analysis revealed significant changes {{with regard to the}} pelagic fisher of seines, {{as a result of the}} introduction of nets of bigger size constructed with synthetic materials (in the 70 s they were still made from cotton) and of instruments considerably increasing the fishing capacity of the <b>boats</b> (<b>winchs,</b> grinder, fishfinders, sonar, etc.), on top of an increase in the power of the engines and in the length of the boats. On the other hand, fishing traps has experienced less changes, in terms of the fishing methods, but the increase in power of the boats (going from rawing to onboard engines, ultrasound incorporation, etc) and the introduction of winch that facilitate the knitting of the pots, has multiplied the fishing power of the boats and has consequently, the effort performed (going from taking 10 - 15 fishing pots per fishing day in the 80 s to 40 - 50 nowadays). Also the size of the fishery has increased with the increase in the engine power. Besides, recently the use of shrimp traps and of electrical reel that enable the access to other resources in deeper waters has been introduced. This increase in the fishing power has been followed by a considerable improvement in the port infrastructures (abrigos, pantalanes, almacenes, refrigeration systems, or congelado de la captura, etc.) and by the development of techniques allowing the increase of the capturability of the benthic-demersal species (development of artificial reef with scrap on behalf of the fishermen themselves) ...|$|R
5000|$|To {{move through}} rapids, steamboats used a {{practice}} called lining, which involved running a rope or a steel cable to a secure point on shore, typically a large tree or a bolt specially {{set in a}} rock, and then wrapping the cable around a steam-powered <b>winch</b> on the <b>boat.</b> The <b>winch</b> would then crank in the cable, if the vessel was going upstream, or gradually let out the cable, if the vessel was headed downstream. [...] Along the Willamette River, in {{the first decades of}} the 1900s, the most dangerous obstacles to navigation were Willamette Falls and the Clackamas Rapids. Since 1873 locks at Oregon allowed navigation around Willamette Falls, but as late as 1907, lining was still required to pass the Clackamas Rapids, which were located north of Oregon City, near the mouth of the Clackamas River.|$|R
5000|$|Originally {{these were}} flash locks that were {{essentially}} removable sections of weir. A boat moving downstream would wait above the lock until the lock was opened, {{which would allow}} a [...] "flash" [...] of water to pass through, carrying the boat with it. In the opposite direction <b>boats</b> would be <b>winched</b> or towed through the open lock. The difficulty of using flash locks, and the consequent loss of water and income to the miller, eventually led to their replacement with pound locks. Locks similar to these early pound locks still exist on the river, although {{in many cases they}} have been enlarged and mechanised.|$|R
40|$|Panoramic Sea Happening (After Kantor) is a 7 minute durational {{film that}} reimagines part of Tadeusz Kantor's {{original}} sea happenings from 1967 {{in a landscape}} in which the sea has retreated. The conductor of Kantor’s original performance is replaced with a sound object cast adrift {{on a beach in}} Dungeness (UK). The object plays back the sound of the sea into the landscape, which was performed live and then filmed from three distinct angles. The first angle mimics the position of the conductor in Kantor’s original happening, facing outwards into the horizon of the beach and recalls the image in Kantor’s work of a human figure undertaking the absurd task of orchestrating the sound of a gigantic expanse of water. The second angle exposes the machine itself and the large cone that amplifies the sound, reinforcing the isolation of the object. The third angle reveals a decommissioned nuclear power station and sound objects used as a warning system for the power plant. Dungeness is a location where the sea has been retreating from the land, leaving traces of human activity through the disused <b>boat</b> <b>winches,</b> abandoned cabins and the decommissioned nuclear buildings. It is a place in which the footprint of the anthropocene is keenly felt. The sound object is intended to act as an anthropomorphic figure, ghosting the original conductor and offering the sound of the sea back into the landscape through a wide mouthpiece, echoing Kantor’s own load hailer in the original sequence of sea happenings. It speculates on Kantor's theory of the bio-object, which proposed a symbiotic relationship between the human and the nonhuman object in performance, as a possible instrument to access a form of geologic imagination. In this configuration, the human itself is absent, but is evoked through the objects left behind. The sound object, helpless in a red dingy, might {{be thought of as a}} co-conspirator with the viewer, enabling a looking back to the past in a landscape of an inevitable future. The work was originally commissioned by the University of Kent in collaboration with the Polish Cultural Institute for the Symposium Kantorbury Kantorbury in Canterbury (UK) to mark the 100 years since Tadeusz Kantor’s birth (15 - 19 September 2015). It should be projected and requires stereo speakers...|$|R
40|$|Bleeper Evo is a {{remotely}} operated vehicle (ROV) developed by the company Praesentis in collaboration with Institut de Ciències del Mar (CSIC) in Barcelona. The main goal of this project was to develop an "easy-to-handle" ROV for benthic studies on the continental shelf. The 40 -kg, 110 x 80 x 40 -cm Bleeper Evo is capable of seafloor surveys to a maximum depth of 100 m. This ROV can be operated from small <b>boats</b> without a <b>winch</b> system and provides high-quality video images along with temperature and depth data. Two parallel laser beams (532 nm, 50 mW) provide scale in video footage, enabling quantitative analyses of seafloor features as well as characterization and measurement of substrate and fauna...|$|R
5000|$|In England the [...] "gate" [...] {{was similar}} to a {{temporary}} needle dam: a set of boards, called paddles, supported against the current by upright timbers called rymers which normally kept the level of water above it to navigable levels. Boats moving downstream would wait above the lock until the paddles were removed, which would allow a [...] "flash" [...] of water to pass through, carrying the boats with it. Upstream <b>boats</b> would be <b>winched</b> or towed through the lock with the paddles removed. Considerable skill was involved both in removing the paddles {{in a timely manner}} and navigating the boat through the lock. Flash locks of this type have been documented since at least 1295 C.E.|$|R
40|$|Stop me if you've {{heard this}} one:The {{richest man in}} the Bahamas, no, {{the richest man in}} the British empire, is murdered in his bed. He has {{suffered}} a fatal head wound caused by a <b>boat's</b> <b>winch</b> lever. Or by bullets from a small-caliber gun. No, by a conch shell. Or by some blunt object close at hand, still unidentified. The rich man's body is set afire in order to burn down his house and conceal the details of the crime. Or as a diversionary tactic, to confuse the authorities. No, in a voodoo ritual. The killer is his son-in-law. Or his houseguest. Or a mafia hitman. The reason for the murder: to eliminate a powerful opponent of casino gambling. Or to prevent this rich man from leaving the Bahamas with his businesses and wealth. Or to avenge the rich man's resentment of his daughter's choice of husband. Or to steal the enormous horde of gold reported to be hidden in his house. The richest man in the Bahamas (if not the whole Empire) was Sir Harry Oakes, who earned his fortune from gold prospecting and spent {{the rest of his life}} avoiding the tax man. He was found murdered in the morning of 8 July 1943, having been killed sometime after midnight during a summer thunderstorm. His body, bearing four lethal head wounds and burns from the fire, was discovered the next morning by his close friend and houseguest, Harold Christie, an influential Bahamian estate agent. Add to this cast of characters a smooth-operating Mauritian (Alfred de Marigny) married to Oakes' young daughter; a former King of England (the Duke of Windsor), now forced to serve this tiny colonial outpost; and the Duke's scandalous wife (the Duchess of Windsor), for whom he renounced his crown. Also, factor in the war raging around the globe. France had recently fallen to the Nazis; German U-boats patrolled the Atlantic; and the shortages and other exigencies of wartime were the rule. The trial of Alfred deMarigny, Oakes' son-in-law, made international news and his eventual acquittal left the case unsolved [...] it remains unsolved today. Let us not forget the recurring legend of all the “unexplained killings of people directly, or indirectly, involved” with the Harry Oakes murder. (Marquis 6) This may sound too good to be true. It may sound like the plot to a best-selling pot-boiler. And it all serves to explain the continuing interest in the murder of Sir Harry Oakes, often referred to, hyperbolically (and hyperbole is in no short supply in the coverage of the murder), as "the crime of the century.

50|$|There were {{hundreds}} of these little boats built by the Russel Brothers company and there can be lots of them found scattered all across Canada, few of them {{are also in the}} United States. This series of <b>winch</b> <b>boat</b> was made usually in sizes ranging from 20 feet long to about 30 feet long, and had an option of a few different engines including Russel Gas engines (originally Campbell Gasoline Engines but in 1923 Russel Brothers purchased rights to manufacture the engines), Sheppard Diesel Engines, and later Lister Diesel engine. Over the years many boats have been re powered by their owners with other engine including Perkins, Detroit Diesel, Caterpillar, and other diesel engines. They usually had 2 fuel tanks, one under the deck in the bow, and one under the stern deck just behind the engine, the one that is on my boat appears to be approximately 120 litre tank, and it is a heavy wall steel drum type tank.|$|R
5000|$|Launch {{techniques}} include foot - launching from a hill, tow-launching from {{a ground-based}} tow system, aerotowing (behind a powered aircraft), powered harnesses, and being towed up by a <b>boat.</b> Modern <b>winch</b> tows typically utilize hydraulic systems designed to regulate line tension, this reduces scenarios for lock out as strong winds result in additional {{length of rope}} spooling out rather than direct tension on the tow line. Other more exotic launch techniques have also been used successfully, such as hot air balloon drops from very high altitude. When weather conditions are unsuitable to sustain a soaring flight, {{this results in a}} top to bottom flight and is referred to as a [...] "sled run".In 1983 Denis Cummings re-introduced a safe tow system that was designed to tow through the centre of mass and had a Gauge that displayed the towing tension, it also integrated a 'weak link' that broke when the safe tow tension was exceeded. After initial testing, in the Hunter Valley, Denis Cummings, pilot, John Clark, (Redtruck), driver and Bob Silver, officianado, began the Flatlands Hang gliding competition at Parkes, NSW. The competition quickly grew, from 16 pilots the first year to hosting a World Championship with 160 pilots towing from several wheat paddocks in western NSW.In 1986 Denis and 'Redtruck' took a group of international pilots to Alice Springs {{to take advantage of the}} massive thermals. Using the new system many World records were set. With the growing use of the system, other launch methods were incorporated, static winch and towing behind a powered hang glider or ultralight.|$|R
40|$|Previous oil {{containment}} booms have an {{open top}} that allows natural gas to escape, and have significant oil leakage due to wave action. Also, a subsea pyramid oil trap exists, but cannot move relative to moving oil plumes from deepsea oil leaks. The solution is to have large, moveable oil traps. One version floats on the sea surface and has a flexible tarp cover and a lower weighted skirt to completely entrap the floating oil and natural gas. The device must have at least three sides with boats pulling at each apex, and sonar or other system to track the slowly moving oil plume, so that the boats can properly locate the booms. The oil trap device must also have a means for removal of the oil and the natural gas. A second design version has a flexible pyramid cover that is attached by lines to ballast on the ocean floor. This is similar to fixed, metal pyramid oil capture devices in the Santa Barbara Channel {{off the coast of}} California. The ballast lines for the improved design, however, would have winches that can move the pyramid to always be located above the oil and gas plume. A third design is a combination of the first two. It uses a submerged pyramid to trap oil, but has no anchor and uses boats to locate the trap. It has ballast weights located along the bottom of the tarp and/or at the corners of the trap. The improved floating oil-spill containment device has a large floating boom and weighted skirt surrounding the oil and gas entrapment area. The device is triangular (or more than three sides) and has a flexible tarp cover with a raised gas vent area. Boats pull on the apex of the triangles to maintain tension and to allow the device to move to optimum locations to trap oil and gas. The gas is retrieved from a higher buoyant part of the tarp, and oil is retrieved from the floating oil layer contained in the device. These devices can be operated in relatively severe weather, since waves will break over the devices without causing oil leaking. Also, natural gas is entrapped and can be retrieved. All designs can use sonar to locate the moving oil plume, and then be relocated by using <b>boats</b> or <b>winches</b> to move the oil trapping devices. These devices can be constructed of treated, non-permeable DuPont Kevlar cloth (or similar material) ...|$|R
40|$|My fall 2015 {{semester}} {{was spent}} at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center working in the Integrated Graphics, Operations, and Analysis Laboratory (IGOAL). My first project {{was to create a}} video animation that could tell the story of OMICS. OMICS is a term being used in the field of biomedical science to describe the collective technologies that study biological systems, such as what makes up a cell and how it functions with other systems. In the IGOAL I used a large 23 inch Wacom monitor to draw storyboards, graphics, and line art animations. I used Blender as the 3 D environment to sculpt, shape, cut or modify the several scenes and models for the video. A challenge creating this video was to take a term used in biomedical science and describe {{it in such a way}} that an 8 th grade student can understand. I used a line art style because it would visually set the tone for what we thought was an educational style. In order to get a handle on the perspective and overall feel for the animation without overloading my workspace, I split up the 2 minute animation into several scenes. I used Blender's python scripting capabilities which allowed for the addition of plugins to add or modify tools. The scripts can also directly interact with the objects to create naturalistic patterns or movements. After collecting the rendered scenes, I used Blender's built-in video editing workspace to output the animation. My second project was to write software that emulates a physical system's interface. The interface was to simulate a <b>boat,</b> ROV, and <b>winch</b> system. Simulations are a time and cost effective way to test complicated data and provide training for operators without having to use expensive hardware. We created the virtual controls with 3 -D Blender models and 2 -D graphics, and then add functionality in C# using the Unity game engine. The Unity engine provides several essential behaviors of a simulator, such as the start and update functions. A framework for Unity, which was developed in the lab, provided a way to place the different widgets on the virtual console dock and have them resize correctly based on the window dimensions [...] My task in this project was to create the controls and visualizations for the data coming in from the simulator for the boat portion of the project. I wrote a class for each control window to handle the functionality of that widget. I implemented 11 widgets that make up the ship portion of the simulator. The members of the lab were each masters of their craft and I'm glad I had the opportunity to learn from them. I learned to plan strategically so I could finish this project on time. I allotted time for storyboarding, development, and refinement. In regards to animating I learned to use modifiers like lattice, boolean and build deformers. I also learned how to animate with drivers, how to use the dope sheet, and how to use the graph editor. In coding I learned to limit the chances for bugs by privatizing functions that should be exclusive to their class. I learned how to use the GIT repository to commit, stash and pull the latest build. I learned a bit of everything because I had the chance to see the entire application development process from the artwork, to the implementation...|$|R
