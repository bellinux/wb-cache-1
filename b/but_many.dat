5000|$|In {{the case}} where {{infinitely}} many objects are combined, most authors {{make a distinction between}} direct sum and direct product. As an example, consider the direct sum and direct product of infinitely many real lines. An element in the direct product is an infinite sequence, such as (1,2,3,...) but in the direct sum, there would be a requirement that all <b>but</b> finitely <b>many</b> coordinates be zero, so the sequence (1,2,3,...) would be an element of the direct product but not of the direct sum, while (1,2,0,0,0,...) would be an element of both. More generally, if a + sign is used, all <b>but</b> finitely <b>many</b> coordinates must be zero, while if some form of multiplication is used, all <b>but</b> finitely <b>many</b> coordinates must be 1. In more technical language, if the summands are , the direct sum [...] is defined to be the set of tuples [...] with [...] such that [...] for all <b>but</b> finitely <b>many</b> i. The direct sum [...] is contained in the direct product , but is usually strictly smaller when the index set [...] is infinite, because direct products do not have the restriction that all <b>but</b> finitely <b>many</b> coordinates must be zero.|$|R

In 1963, Hart attended a special meeting at the White House hosted by President John F. Kennedy to discuss civil rights with other religious leaders. A few months later, a local KofC council rejected a black man's application because of his race, notwithstanding that he was a graduate of Notre Dame University. Six council officers resigned in protest, and the incident made national news. Hart declared that the process for membership would be revised at the next Supreme Convention, but died before he could see it take place.|$|E
