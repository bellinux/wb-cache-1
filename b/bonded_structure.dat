50|$|There are two {{possible}} structures for hydrogen cyanide, HCN and CNH, differing only {{as to the}} position of the hydrogen atom. The structure with hydrogen attached to nitrogen, CNH, leads to formal charges of -1 on carbon and +1 on nitrogen, which would be partially compensated for by the electronegativity of nitrogen and Pauling calculated the net charges on H, N and C as -0.79, +0.75 and +0.04 respectively. In contrast the structure with hydrogen bonded to carbon, HCN, has formal charges on carbon and nitrogen of 0, and the effect of the electronegativity of the nitrogen would make the charges on H, C and N +0.04, +0.17 and -0.21.

50|$|Careful {{tailoring}} of the shockwave {{shape and}} intensity has also enabled the inspection of bonded composite structures via laser shocking. The technology, termed Laser Bond Inspection initiates a shockwave that reflects off {{the backside of}} a <b>bonded</b> <b>structure</b> and returns as a tensile wave. As the tensile wave passes back through the adhesive bond, depending {{on the strength of}} the bond and the peak tensile stress of the stress wave, the tensile wave will either pass through the bond or rupture it. By controlling the pressure of the tensile wave this procedure is capable of reliably locally testing adhesion strength between bonded joints. This technology is most often found in application to bonded fiber composite material structures but has also been shown to be successful in evaluating bonds between metal-composite material. Fundamental issues are also studied to characterize and quantify the effect of shock wave produced by laser inside these complex materials.|$|E

40|$|Thermal {{testing method}} {{that is a}} kind of {{non-destructive}} testing, is applied to search for the non-adhesive area in the <b>bonded</b> <b>structure.</b> In the non-destructive testing, there is a few method such as the methods using the radiation, the ultrasonic and the character of electrical conduction {{with the exception of the}} thermal testing method. Especially, in the thermal testing method, it is possible to detect flaws in area, and it is easy to search existence of corrosion. Therefore, in this study this method is employed to search delamination in the <b>bonded</b> <b>structure.</b> The difference of temperature occurs on the upper material surface over the adhesive area and the non-adhesive area, because there is the non-adhesive area in the bond layer. Employing this difference of temperature, the non-adhesive area can be detected by the thermal testing method. However, it is difficult to measure the width of non-adhesive area by thermal testing method. Therefore, in this study, employing numerical analysis based on the finite element method, it was investigated that estimation method with respect to width of the non-adhesive area using measurement data of the temperature at two points on surface of the <b>bonded</b> <b>structure</b> that CFRP is bonded to SS 400 by epoxy resin with a cavity in the bond layer.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{life time}} prediction of wire <b>bond</b> <b>structure</b> {{in a power}} electronic module based on computational approach that integrates methods for high fidelity analysis, reduced order modelling, and life time prediction using reduced order model. This methodology is demonstrated {{for the design of}} a wire <b>bond</b> <b>structure</b> in a power electronic module with aim of reducing the chance of failure due to the wire bond lift off in power electronic module when a random load is applied to the aluminium wire. In particular, wire bond reliability of the power module related to the thermal fatigue material degradation of aluminium wire {{is one of the main}} concerns. In the power electronic module reliability, understanding the performance, reliability and robustness of wire bond is a key factor for the future development and success of the power electronic module technology, because wire bond lift off failure ignites other catastrophic failures. The main focus in this study is on the application of reduced order modelling techniques and the development of the associated models for fast evaluation and analysis. The discussion is on methods for approximate response surface modelling based on interpolation techniques using Kriging and radial basis functions. The reduced order modelling approach uses prediction data for the electro-thermo-mechanical behaviour of the power module wirebond design obtained through non-linear transient finite element simulations, in particular for the fatigue life-time of the aluminium wire attached to the silicon chip of the wire in the module. The reduced order models are used for the analysis of predicting the life time of the wire <b>bond</b> <b>structure</b> under random load.

50|$|According to {{this theory}} a {{covalent}} bond is formed {{between the two}} atoms by the overlap of half filled valence atomic orbitals of each atom containing one unpaired electron. A valence <b>bond</b> <b>structure</b> {{is similar to a}} Lewis structure, but where a single Lewis structure cannot be written, several valence <b>bond</b> <b>structures</b> are used. Each of these VB structures represents a specific Lewis structure. This combination of valence <b>bond</b> <b>structures</b> is the main point of resonance theory. Valence bond theory considers that the overlapping atomic orbitals of the participating atoms form a chemical bond. Because of the overlapping, it is most probable that electrons should be in the bond region. Valence bond theory views bonds as weakly coupled orbitals (small overlap). Valence bond theory is typically easier to employ in ground state molecules. The inner-shell orbitals and electrons remain essentially unchanged during the formation of bonds.|$|R
