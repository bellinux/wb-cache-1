25|$|Creating Shared Value: Creating Shared Value (CSV) is a <b>business</b> <b>concept</b> {{intended}} to encourage businesses to create {{economic and social}} value simultaneously {{by focusing on the}} social issues that they are capable of addressing. In 2006, Nestlé adopted the CSV approach, focusing on three areas– nutrition, water and rural development– as these are core to their business activities. Nestlé now publishes an annual progress report on its goals. Nestlé also established the Creating Shared Value Prize, which is awarded every other year with the aim of rewarding the best examples of CSV initiatives worldwide and to encourage other companies to adopt a shared value approach. These initiatives should take a business-oriented approach in addressing challenges in nutrition, water or rural development. The winner can win up to CHF 500,000. Nestlé was an early mover in the shared value space and hosts a global forum, the Creating Shared Value Global Forum.|$|E
25|$|However, it is {{a simple}} {{accounting}} error to think, that the gross profit share of value-added is equal to true business profit, or that constant capital invested in physical assets (fixed equipment and inventories) represents the capital that an enterprise owns, other than a fund to pay wages, or that profits from product sales are the only net income the corporation has. That can be verified from any corporate balance sheet. If an enterprise borrows or leases capital for production, rather than investing its own, this affects the cost of capital that is tied up at any particular time. How the profitability of capital is accounted for, depends very much on who owns the capital, as distinct from who borrows it, or who uses it. So the rate of profit concept which Marx uses in his theoretical analysis of capitalist production (i.e. S/(C+V)) differs from the actual <b>business</b> <b>concept</b> of the rate of profit, because it disregards all sorts of financial and ownership issues, and because it concerns only part of the total circuit of capital.|$|E
40|$|Organizations {{constantly}} need {{to adapt}} to the rapidly changing macro environment. Information systems, that hinder and restrain flexibility, may jeopardize the ability for organizations to survive. A new method for developing information systems called the Business Rules Approach has emerged with promises of business agility. The Business Rules Approach focuses on business rules which are reliant on a <b>Business</b> <b>Concepts</b> Model for their structure and vocabulary. This paper examines the relation between the business rules and the <b>Business</b> <b>Concepts</b> Model. We conclude that a <b>Business</b> <b>Concepts</b> Model with less participation facts between terms generally yield less complex rules and that a <b>Business</b> <b>Concepts</b> Model with more participation facts between terms generally yield more complex Business Rules. However the tradeoff for decreased complexity is a loss of the ability to talk about or verbalize certain terms. We conclude that generalization facts in the <b>Business</b> <b>Concepts</b> Model do not impact complexity of Business Rules. Finally, the ability to express Business Rules in natural language is not impacted by increases or decreases in <b>Business</b> <b>Concepts</b> Model complexity...|$|R

500|$|Grand Met {{also made}} several moves {{in an attempt}} to broaden BK's {{business}} operations while expanding its presence globally. The first move by the company was the creation of the BK Expressway <b>business</b> <b>concept,</b> a new store format designed for locations where a traditional stand-alone restaurant was impractical. The company introduced two separate formats designed to operate in different business environments; the first concept was intended as a kiosk-type store that would be placed in locations such as sports venues and airports. The second concept store, designed with two drive-thrus and a minimal or even non-existent dining room, was designed to go in locations that were limited by high land costs or limited space. Both types of these new, smaller stores operated with a condensed menu prepared on new equipment designed specifically for the more compact footprints of the new locations. Expressway locations were also designed with lower start-up costs in mind; franchisees were wooed with the promise of a much smaller investment, approximately one third as much, than would be required to open a more traditional location. In August of the same year, Grand Met set about expanding Burger King's operations in Europe by acquiring UK-based United Biscuits restaurant operations, including the nearly 400-location burger chain Wimpy. With the purchase, described as a [...] "rare opportunity" [...] by CEO Sheppard, Grand Met set about converting certain Wimpy locations that employed a counter service system into Burger King locations. The merger of the United Biscuits properties with BK grew the company from about 30 restaurants in the UK to more than 60 within a year of the purchase, with another 30 locations added in early 1990. While other [...] "Wimpy" [...] locations are still in operation presently, they are now independent from BK and no longer have the presence they once did.|$|E

McCartney also said: [...] "It's just trying to mix business with enjoyment. We're in the happy position of not needing any more money. So for the first time, the bosses aren't in it for profit.

40|$|Abstract Opinion mining on {{conversational}} telephone speech tackles two chal-lenges: {{the robustness}} of speech transcriptions and {{the relevance of}} opinion models. The two challenges are critical in an industrial context such as marketing. The paper addresses jointly these two issues by analyzing the influence of speech transcription errors on the detection of opinions and <b>business</b> <b>concepts.</b> We present both modules: the speech transcription system, which consists in a successful adaptation of a conversational speech transcription system to call-centre data and the information extraction module, {{which is based on}} a semantic modeling of <b>business</b> <b>concepts,</b> opinions and sentiments with complex linguistic rules. Three models of opinions are implemented based on the discourse theory, the appraisal theory and the marketers’ expertise, respectively. The influence of speech recognition errors on the informa-tion extraction module is evaluated by comparing its outputs on manual versus automatic transcripts.

Further, how to construct such a meta model and how to include new elements to it remains implicit. This paper presents an approach on how to construct a meta model for <b>business</b> process <b>concepts.</b> The approach defines how to capture and define <b>business</b> process <b>concepts,</b> how to construct a meta model using these concepts and how to extend the meta model. The paper also illustrates how to apply the approach. The actual construction of the meta model for <b>business</b> process <b>concepts</b> is a subject of further research...|$|R
