50|$|A tablet {{is formed}} by the {{combined}} pressing action of two punches and a die. In {{the first step of}} a typical operation, the <b>bottom</b> <b>punch</b> is lowered in the die creating a cavity into which the granulated feedstock is fed. The exact depth of the lower punch can be precisely controlled to meter the amount of powder that fills the cavity. The excess is scraped {{from the top of the}} die, and the lower punch is drawn down and temporarily covered to prevent spillage. Then, the upper punch is brought down into contact with the powder as the cover is removed. The force of compression is delivered by high pressure compression rolls which fuse the granulated material together into a hard tablet. After compression, the lower punch is raised to eject the tablet.|$|E

Using the FEA software DEFORM, the paper simulated the extrusion process of three kinds of upper and lower extrusion punch combinations which have different shape and studied the influences of the punch shape on metal flowing, Z direction punch load and equivalent stress. By contrasting the simulation data, the best punch shape was chosen. Our results could provide theory evidence for optimization design of Socket-Spanner extrusion punch. It was shown that the tapered <b>bottom</b> <b>punch</b> is the most suitable shape for the socket-spanner extrusion than the flat tapered and the flat one...|$|E
5000|$|When {{helicopters}} arrived {{they found}} the spacecraft on its side, taking on water, and submerging. The beryllium heat shield upon water impact had bounced against the capsule <b>bottom,</b> <b>punching</b> two holes in the titanium pressure bulkhead. The landing bag had worn badly, and the heatshield was torn free from the spacecraft before recovery. After the craft capsized, the open snorkel valve let still more sea water enter the capsule. When the helicopter crew finally latched onto and picked up Ham's spacecraft at 18:52 UTC., they estimated there was about 800 pounds (360 kg) of sea water aboard. The spacecraft was flown to and lowered to the deck of [...] When the spacecraft was opened Ham {{appeared to be in}} good condition and readily accepted an apple and half an orange.|$|R

The bucket is filled, and gravity feeds the water to the plants. As a rule about 40 litres of water per day are needed for every 100 plants, although this can vary depending upon what is being grown.|$|R
5000|$|A pritchel {{is a type}} of punch used in forging, {{particularly}} in making nail holes in horseshoes. The horseshoe is heated and a hole is punched through 90 percent of the steel with a forepunch or drift punch. The pointed end of the tool should be kept sharp and so that the burr is cut out smoothly. The punched hole is lined up over the pritchel hole and the pritchel is driven into the hole, knocking out the remaining metal at the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>punched</b> hole. [...] The temperature of the pritchel should be always below the red-hot stage as the tool itself will bend and lose the temper. When over-heated it is advised to cool it in water intermediately.|$|R
40|$|To {{prevent the}} {{occurrence}} of wrinkling in the shrink flanging of ultra-high strength steel sheets, a gradually contacting punch was developed. Compressive stress around the convex corner of the sheet in shrink flanging was reduced by gradually bending the edge from the center {{to the outside of}} the sheet using the gradually contacting punch. Compressive strain around the convex corner edge decreased as the contact angle of the punch increased. Although a small camber occurred on the upper surface of the flanged sheet using the conventional flat <b>bottom</b> <b>punch,</b> the camber was large using the gradually contacting punch because of the gradual bending. The limiting flange height of the flanged sheet without wrinkling showed an increase of 26 % for the 980 MPa grade ultra-high strength steel sheet...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{discusses}} a new drawing technology, {{based on}} a synchronized Movement of ram and cushion with multiple bending operations in alternating directions called "bi-directional deep drawing (BDD). " The goal is to avoid local thinning by strengthening the weak point using local hardening. BDD operations are realized before the conventional deep drawing process. This results in a local strain hardening at the weak point of the workpiece, which is usually located at the <b>bottom</b> <b>punch</b> radius. Two major aspects have to be given attention due to {{the high number of}} process parameters. On the one hand, for process design, it is helpful to have a tool by means of which it is possible to simultaneously create both the machine program for the servo press and the initial configuration for the process simulation. From the authors' point of view, this complexity can only be represented by a numerical analysis method, on the other hand. Consequently, both aspects are given attention in this paper...|$|E
40|$|Normal {{anisotropy}} {{is crucial}} for deep drawability of sheet metal. Texture of the sheet determines the normal anisotropy. It is often observed that the forming conditions remaining unchanged, sheets having similar tensile properties do not always show similar drawability in press working. It was therefore thought that strain and strain path dependent change in the normal anisotropy of two sheets could {{hold the key to}} this behaviour. Hence studies were undertaken to ascertain as to whether such a strain path dependent change in the anisotropy does occur. While in the literature, strain dependent change in anisotropy has been investigated, dependence on the strain path has not been reported. Studies on the strain dependent variation in texture of non-ferrous materials (Al alloys and brass in particular) have been widely, reported. Literature on the strain and strain path dependence of texture and the anisotropy of steel sheet is not easily available. An experimental program was therefore undertaken to stretch the sheet in-plane to different strain levels for each of the five strain paths considered. Two strain paths characterised the negative minor strain and two characterised biaxial tension. The fifth one was close to plane strain. Special tooling with a 200 nun diameter flat (but relieved) <b>bottom</b> <b>punch</b> was fabricated. Specimens for R-value, texture and Modul-(r) over bar measurements were all cut from the flat, in-plane stretched (punch bottom) region of the sheet. Results indicated significant dependence of the R-value and texture on the strain and strain path. The R-values were found to decrease with increasing strain in all the three methods of testing. The rate of decrease was found to be strain path dependent. The inferences from the mechanical measurements of R-value based on the ASTM procedure and those predicted from texture measurements were in excellent agreement. Thus texture studies throw light on macroscopic mechanical behaviour (strain and strain path dependent variation in anisotropy). (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|AbstractCracks {{frequently}} {{occur in}} conventional cylindrical {{deep drawing process}} due to the lower formability of aluminum alloy sheet at room temperature. Therefore, a new approach named electromagnetic pulse assisted progressive deep drawing is proposed in this paper. This method gains the radial electromagnetic force which helps to push the sheet metal in radial direction by placing the circular thrust coil upon and underneath the flange, while gaining the axial electromagnetic force by placing drawing coil in the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>punch.</b> The results shows that {{the placement of the}} radial thrust coil has significant effect on the sheet metal's state and distribution of stress-strain; In addition, the interaction of the axial drawing force and the radial thrusting force has great effect on the depth of the deep drawing cylindrical parts...|$|R

40|$|The Swift {{test was}} {{originally}} proposed as a formability test {{to reproduce the}} conditions observed in deep drawing operations. This test consists on forming a cylindrical cup from a circular blank, using a flat <b>bottom</b> cylindrical <b>punch</b> and has been extensively studied using both analytical and numerical methods. This test can also be combined with the Demeri test, which consists in cutting a ring from {{the wall of a}} cylindrical cup, in order to open it afterwards to measure the springback. This combination allows their use as benchmark test, in order to improve the knowledge concerning the numerical simulation models, through the comparison between experimental and numerical results. The focus of this study is the experimental and numerical analyses of the Swift cup test, followed by the Demeri test, performed with an AA 5754 -O alloy at room temperature. In this context, a detailed analysis of the punch force evolution, the thickness evolution along the cup wall, the earing profile, the strain paths and their evolution and the ring opening is performed. The numerical simulation is performed using the finite element code ABAQUS, with solid and solid-shell elements, in order to compare the computational efficiency of these type of elements. The results show that the solid-shell element is more cost-effective than the solid, presenting global accurate predictions, excepted for the thinning zones. Both the von Mises and the Hill 48 yield criteria predict the strain distributions in the final cup quite accurately. However, improved knowledge concerning the stress states is still required, because the Hill 48 criterion showed difficulties in the correct prediction of the springback, whatever the type of finite element adopted...|$|R
