Kevin Passmore writes that the Peronist regime, more than any other in Latin America, has been accused of being fascist. <b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>that</b> the Peronist regime was not fascist, and what passed for fascism under Perón never took hold in Latin America. Additionally, because the Peronist regime allowed rival political parties to exist, it cannot be described as totalitarian.|$|E

When [...] his voice began to change, he worked to retain his ability to sing notes in a high range. [...] For a while he was quite shy about singing using his high range, as it was unusual in Israel—which he explains used to be [...] "quite a machoistic country—for someone to sing with such a high voice, and he had no one to imitate as no Israeli men sang in such a high voice, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>that</b> now it is [...] "part of me."

[...] Finally cornered, he admits that the room belongs to both of them, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>that</b> he will have his little back second floor room ready later the same day. Both lodgers say they will take it, which Bouncer quickly points out makes no sense whatsoever. He leaves them to decide which will vacate the current room. Each suggests the other should leave, but neither will budge. Finally, they realise that it is all Bouncer's fault, and they may as well be friends. They serenade each other on the guitar.|$|E
