It recorded in 60 frames per second and 1080p high definition video, whereas typical low-end video game recording devices capture in 720p and 30 frames per second. The Telegraph gave it {{four out of five}} stars.

In the relatively hitter-friendly confines and higher-than-average altitude of Atlanta Stadium ("The Launching Pad"), he actually increased his offensive production. Atlanta also produced batting champions in Rico Carty (in 1970) and Ralph Garr (in 1974). In {{the shadow of}} Aaron's historical home run pursuit, {{was the fact that}} three Atlanta sluggers hit 40 or more home runs in 1973 – Darrell Evans, Davey Johnson and, of course, Aaron.|$|E

The official agents did their job: Reyna was elected president and, so as not to offend the losing candidates, Barillas gave them checks to cover the costs of their presidential campaigns. Reyna Barrios of course received nothing, but he went on to become President on March 15, 1892.|$|E

25|$|The vagina, {{including}} the vaginal opening, may be altered {{as a result}} of genital modification during vaginoplasty or labiaplasty. Those who undergo vaginoplasty are usually older and have given birth to one or more children. A thorough examination of the vagina before a vaginoplasty is standard, as well as being referred to a urogynecologist for possible vaginal disorders. With regard to labiaplasty, reduction of the labia minora is quick without hindrance, and any complications are rare and can be corrected. The complications are minor enough that those with them may still <b>be</b> <b>satisfied</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> procedure. Any scarring from the procedure is minimal, and long-term chronic problems have not been identified. There is no evidence that such surgery improves psychological or relationship problems; however, the surgery has a risk of damaging blood vessels and nerves.|$|E

500|$|In 1959, Stafford {{was offered}} a {{contract}} to perform at Las Vegas, but declined it to concentrate on her family life. Because she disliked continuously traveling for television appearances that took her away from her children, and no longer found the music business fun, she went into semi-retirement in the mid-1960s. She retired fully in 1975. Except for the Jonathan and Darlene Edwards material, and re-recording [...] her favorite song [...] "Whispering Hope" [...] with her daughter Amy in 1978, Stafford did not perform again until 1990, at a ceremony honoring Frank Sinatra. The Westons devoted more time to Share Inc.a charity aiding people with developmental disabilitiesin {{which they had been}} active for many years. In or around 1983, Concord Records tried to persuade Stafford to change her mind and come out of retirement, but although an album was planned, she did not feel she would <b>be</b> <b>satisfied</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> finished product, and the project was shelved.|$|E

Newman wrote back to Grade on October 6 that year with a set of detailed proposals and a suggestion that he take direct control of the series as executive producer. Grade suggested that Newman meet the current Head of Drama, Jonathan Powell, for lunch to discuss the Canadian's ideas. Newman and Powell did not get on well, however, and nothing came of their meeting. He was also unsuccessful in an attempt to have his name added to the end credits of the show as its creator. Acting Head of Series & Serials Ken Riddington, to whom Newman's request had been referred, wrote to him that [...] "Heads of Department who originate programmes have to <b>be</b> <b>satisfied</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> other rewards that flow from doing so." ...|$|E

[...] He predicted that viewers would <b>be</b> <b>satisfied</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> revelation of the mystery bride's identity and commented: [...] "There's humor and poignancy in all the stories and good work all around." [...] Bianco praised Felicity Huffman's [...] "strong and varied" [...] acting skills, complimented Eva Longoria's comedic talents, and declared Richard Burgi's performance as his best in the entire series. He concluded that while the show has declined in quality since its first season, [...] "it remains a very good TV series" [...] and noted that [...] "there's also the potential for a season that returns this already-solid show to top form." [...] TV Guide writer Mickey O'Connor was negative in his review. He criticized the Lynette story as being [...] "an awful development" [...] and said the chemistry between actress de Matteo and her costars [...] "a little off." [...] However, he was more receptive of Katherine's reaction to losing Mike, saying [...] "what could have played out as a typical weepy, hos-before-bros make-up session has been elevated to something much richer." ...|$|E

Searle argues that no reasonable person should <b>be</b> <b>satisfied</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> reply, unless they are [...] "under the grip of an ideology;" [...] In order for this reply to be remotely plausible, one must take it for granted that consciousness can be the product of an information processing [...] "system", and does not require anything resembling the actual biology of the brain.|$|E
2500|$|George {{developed}} {{what he saw}} as {{a crucial}} feature of his own theory of economics in a critique of an illustration used by Frédéric Bastiat in order to explain the nature of interest and profit. Bastiat had asked his readers to consider James and William, both carpenters. James has built himself a plane, and has lent it to William for a year. Would James <b>be</b> <b>satisfied</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> return of an equally good plane a year later? Surely not! He'd expect a board along with it, as interest. The basic idea of a theory of interest is to understand why. Bastiat said that James had given William over that year [...] "the power, inherent in the instrument, to increase the productivity of his labor," [...] and wants compensation for that increased productivity.|$|E
2500|$|Job {{characteristics}} are {{attributes of the}} job that people traditionally find important, including {{the extent to which}} they identify with the tasks they are doing (identity), {{the extent to which they}} are assigned diverse tasks (variety), extent to which they feel their work affects others (significance), extent to which they receive productive feedback from their job (feedback), and the extent to which they feel they are allowed to make their own decisions at their job (autonomy). [...] These characteristics play an important role in influencing the relationship between an individual's core self-evaluations and their satisfaction with their job. [...] Studies have found that perceived job characteristics partially mediate the relationship between core self-evaluations and job satisfaction. [...] In other words, a person who appraises themselves positively (i.e., has high core self-evaluations) and has acquired a job which encompasses the aforementioned characteristics of identity, variety, significance, feedback, and autonomy, will be more likely to <b>be</b> <b>satisfied</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> job.|$|E

In the same speech, Corbyn listed various criticisms of the EU, and stated: [...] "that’s not to say we can <b>be</b> <b>satisfied</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> European Union as it is."

2500|$|Communication is {{critical}} for the delivery of appropriate and effective treatment and care, regardless of a patient’s race, and miscommunication can lead to incorrect diagnosis, improper use of medications, and failure to receive follow-up care. [...] The patient provider relationship {{is dependent on the}} ability of both individuals to effectively communicate. [...] Language and culture both {{play a significant role in}} communication during a medical visit. Among the patient population, minorities face greater difficulty in communicating with their physicians. [...] Patients when surveyed responded that 19% of the time they have problems communicating with their providers which included understanding doctor, feeling doctor listened, and had questions but did not ask. In contrast, the Hispanic population had the largest problem communicating with their provider, 33% of the time. Communication has been linked to health outcomes, as communication improves so does patient satisfaction which leads to improved compliance and then to improved health outcomes. Quality of care is impacted as a result of an inability to communicate with health care providers. [...] Language plays a pivotal role in communication and efforts need to be taken to ensure excellent communication between patient and provider. Among limited English proficient patients in the United States, the linguistic barrier is even greater. [...] Less than half of non-English speakers who say they need an interpreter during clinical visits report having one. [...] The absence of interpreters during a clinical visit adds to the communication barrier. Furthermore, inability of providers to communicate with limited English proficient patients leads to more diagnostic procedures, more invasive procedures, and over prescribing of medications. Poor communication contributes to poor medical compliance and health outcomes. [...] Many health-related settings provide interpreter services for their limited English proficient patients. This has been helpful when providers do not speak the same language as the patient. [...] However, there is mounting evidence that patients need to communicate with a language concordant physician (not simply an interpreter) to receive the best medical care, bond with the physician, and <b>be</b> <b>satisfied</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> care experience. Having patient-physician language discordant pairs (i.e. Spanish-speaking patient with an English-speaking physician) may also lead to greater medical expenditures and thus higher costs to the organization. [...] Additional communication problems result from a decrease or lack of cultural competence by providers. [...] It is important for providers to be cognizant of patients’ health beliefs and practices without being judgmental or reacting. [...] Understanding a patients’ view of health and disease is important for diagnosis and treatment. [...] So providers need to assess patients’ health beliefs and practices to improve quality of care. Patient health decisions can be influenced by religious beliefs, mistrust of Western medicine, and familial and hierarchical roles, all of which a white provider may not be familiar with. Other type of communication problems are seen in LGBT health care with the spoken heterosexist (conscious or unconscious) attitude on LGBT patients, lack of understanding on issues like having no sex with men (lesbians, gynecologic examinations) and other issues.|$|E
