In order to be granted a gun license in the Czech Republic, a person must pass a qualification exam, receive a health clearance by a general practitioner, who may require a further examination by a specialist, such as a psychological or psychiatric evaluation, and must pass a <b>background</b> <b>check.</b> According to Section 23 of the Czech Firearms Act, an applicant may not be granted a license if he has committed more than one misdemeanor against public order in the previous three years. Similarly, the law further makes gun license unaccessible to people with mental illnesses. The license must be renewed every five years (every ten years for licenses issued after 1 July 2014). The renewal requires the presentation of a new health clearance, while the police conduct a new <b>background</b> <b>check.</b> 's license was renewed in January 2015.|$|E

5000|$|Those {{who oppose}} {{universal}} <b>background</b> <b>checks</b> argue that existing gun laws are sufficient; {{that the government}} does not prosecute enough of the attempted buyers who are turned away by the current system; that <b>background</b> <b>checks</b> are an invasion of privacy; that [...] "transfer" [...] might be defined too broadly. Opponents also maintain that universal <b>background</b> <b>checks</b> would not stop crime and assert {{that the only way to}} properly enforce a universal system would be to require a registration database. Gun-rights advocate and author John Lott argues that universal <b>background</b> <b>checks</b> prevent poorer Americans from acquiring guns. Lott said that, as of December 2015, <b>background</b> <b>checks</b> added an effective cost of $80 (New York), $60 (Washington state), or $200 (Washington, D.C.) to transferring a firearm. Lott argues that universal <b>background</b> <b>checks</b> are an effective tax on guns and can prevent less affluent Americans from purchasing them, and that this disproportionately affects poor minorities who live in high-crime urban areas.|$|R

5|$|The archdiocese offers {{religious}} education classes {{in all of}} its 111 parishes for children who attend public and other non-religious schools. According to the 2007 Official Catholic Directory, there were 95,837 students enrolled in these classes. This same source lists as teachers 2760 laity, 58 religious sisters, and 43 priests and religious brothers. Religious education classes are also offered to adults throughout the archdiocese. In 1997, Archbishop Favalora adopted a policy requiring all volunteers, employees, teachers and priests to be fingerprinted and have a <b>background</b> <b>check</b> before they could work with children. Several years later, this policy was enshrined and adopted by all U.S. Bishops in the Charter for Protection of Young People.|$|E
40|$|Current {{federal law}} defies logic in {{requiring}} that only purchasers who buy from federally licensed sellers {{be subject to}} <b>background</b> <b>checking.</b> Thus, universal <b>background</b> <b>checking</b> is frequently proposed as {{the best and most}} important form of “sensible gun control”. Upon closer inspection, however, universal <b>background</b> <b>checking</b> would be harder to implement and enforce than proponents recognize. Moreover, the likely payoff in reduction of gun homicides, crimes and suicides would be less than what is often assumed. This Article closely examines universal <b>background</b> <b>checking</b> in theory and practice, including the Manchin-Toomey Amendment which Congress rejected in 2013 but which continues to be reintroduced...|$|R

Access to the National Instant Criminal <b>Background</b> <b>Check</b> System (NICS) is limited to FFL holders and FFLs are not issued to persons that only sell firearms at gun shows.|$|E

40|$|The tragedy at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, on December 14, 2012, reignited {{the debate}} on whether to {{strengthen}} federal and state gun laws. Soon after the massacre, the top priority for advocates for stronger gun laws became broadening <b>background</b> <b>checks</b> to apply to all gun sales. Under current federal law, vendors {{in the business of}} selling guns must get a license, conduct <b>background</b> <b>checks,</b> and keep records. But unlicensed "private" sellers [...] persons who maintain they sell only occasionally at gun shows, online, or anywhere else [...] are able to sell guns with no questions asked. In some ways, the debate's emphasis on the universal <b>background</b> <b>checks</b> proposal was surprising [...] after all, the Newtown shooter would not have been subject to federal prohibitions, other than the one that blocks handgun sales to persons under 21, and <b>background</b> <b>checks</b> were only tangentially related to the shooting. The ascendance of <b>background</b> <b>checks</b> as the primary policy proposal to combat gunviolence reflects a shift in gun-reform advocates' strategy from tightening regulations on guns themselves to strengthening laws that keep guns away from dangerous people. The shift had already begun before Newtown; after, it only accelerated. Both policy research and political realities informed this shift in priorities. As a policy matter, most research suggests that making it more difficult for dangerous people to acquire guns will have a significant impact in reducing the more than 30, 000 gun deaths that happen every year in America. As a political matter, polling conducted before and after Newtown show that 80 percent to 90 percent of Americans support expanding <b>background</b> <b>checks,</b> including most gun owners. As the debate over the universal <b>background</b> <b>checks</b> proposal heated up before the Senate voted on the matter in April, discussion of the substantive benefits of this policy proposal was mostly lost in the fray. The <b>background</b> <b>checks</b> debate far too often devolved into sound bites, which gave rise to a number of widespread misunderstandings about the universal <b>background</b> <b>checks</b> proposal and its potential effects on gun violence in the United States. In this issue brief, we assess six key claims that have been made about <b>background</b> <b>checks</b> in the past year...|$|R

50|$|In its 1997 {{decision}} in the case, the Supreme Court ruled that the provision of the Brady Act that compelled state {{and local law enforcement}} officials to perform the <b>background</b> <b>checks</b> was unconstitutional on 10th amendment grounds. The Court determined that this provision violated both the concept of federalism and that of the unitary executive. However, the overall Brady statute was upheld and state and local law enforcement officials remained free to conduct <b>background</b> <b>checks</b> if they so chose. The vast majority continued to do so. In 1998, <b>background</b> <b>checks</b> for firearm purchases became mostly a federally run activity when NICS came online, although many states continue to mandate state run <b>background</b> <b>checks</b> before a gun dealer may transfer a firearm to a buyer.|$|R
