5|$|Despite his {{military}} background, Andronikos failed {{to deal with}} Isaac Komnenos, Béla III of Hungary (r. 1172–1196) who reincorporated Croatian territories into Hungary, and Stephen Nemanja of Serbia (r. 1166–1196) who declared his independence from the Byzantine Empire. Yet, none of these troubles would compare to William II of Sicily's (r. 1166–1189) invasion force of 300 ships and 80,000 men, arriving in 1185. Andronikos mobilised a small fleet of 100 ships to defend the capital, <b>but</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>that</b> he was indifferent to the populace. He was finally overthrown when Isaac Angelos, surviving an imperial assassination attempt, seized power {{with the aid of}} the people and had Andronikos killed.|$|E
5|$|In {{approximately}} June 342 BC, Philip {{set off on}} {{what must}} have been a long-planned expedition into Thrace. The campaign was to last for two years, <b>but</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>that</b> his forces were large, and that he fought several battles, the ancient sources contain very few details. Undoubtedly Philip's primary aim was to depose Kersebleptes, who according to Diodorus had been causing problems for the Greeks on the Chersonese, once and for all. Philip ended the campaign by marrying Meda of Odessos, daughter of a king of the Getae, which has been taken to suggest that Philip campaigned not just in Thrace, but in the valley of the Hebrus, and north of the Great Balkan range of mountains, near the Danube.|$|E
5|$|In the 6th century, the Turkic-speaking nomadic Avars {{moved into}} the middle Danube area. Twice (in 562 and 566–567), the Avars {{undertook}} military expeditions against the Franks, and their routes went through the Polish lands. The Avar envoys bribed Slavic chiefs from the lands they did not control, including Pomerania, to secure their participation in Avar raids, <b>but</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>that,</b> {{the exact nature of}} their relations with the Slavs in Poland is not known. The Avars had some presence or contacts in Poland also in the 7th and 8th centuries, when they left artifacts in the Kraków-Nowa Huta region and elsewhere, including a bronze belt decoration found in the Krakus Mound. This last item, from the turn of the 8th century, is used to date the mound itself.|$|E

50|$|The Duke of York, meanwhile, {{had gained}} a very {{important}} ally, Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick, {{one of the most}} influential magnates and possibly richer than York himself. York was named regent as Protector of the Realm in 1454. The queen was excluded completely, and Edmund Beaufort was detained in the Tower of London, while many of York's supporters spread rumours that Edward was not the king's son, <b>but</b> Beaufort's. <b>Other</b> <b>than</b> <b>that,</b> York's months as regent were spent tackling the problem of government overspending.|$|R

5|$|Musidora was {{extremely}} well received when first exhibited, and {{considered one of}} the finest works by an English artist. Etty died in 1849 and his work rapidly went out of fashion. At the same time, the topic of Musidora itself became a cliche, and from the 1870s Thomson's writings faded into obscurity. Etty's Musidora is likely to have influenced The Knight Errant by John Everett Millais, <b>but</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>that</b> has had little influence on subsequent works. The Tate's version of the painting was exhibited in major exhibitions in 2001–02 in London and in 2011–12 in York.|$|E
5|$|Realistic {{religious}} painting, sometimes entire {{series of}} related works, served its didactic purpose. Nudity and mythological themes were banned, <b>but</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>that</b> fancy collection of Western paintings were in vogue. Sigismund III brought from Venice Tommaso Dolabella. A prolific painter, {{he was to}} spend the rest of his life in Kraków and give rise to a school of Polish painters working under his influence. Danzig (Gdańsk) was also a center for graphic arts; painters Herman Han and Bartholomäus Strobel worked there, and so did Willem Hondius and Jeremias Falck, who were engravers. As compared with the previous century, even wider circles of the society participated in cultural activities, but Catholic Counter-Reformation pressure resulted in diminished diversity. Catastrophic wars in the middle of the century greatly weakened the Commonwealth's cultural development and influence in the region.|$|E
5|$|The Dawn of Love (under its {{original}} title of Venus Now Wakes, and Wakens Love) was exhibited in 1829 at the Birmingham Society of Arts, <b>but</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>that</b> its history during Etty's lifetime is not recorded. No record of {{its original}} sale exists, {{and it was not}} among the 133 paintings included in the major retrospective exhibition of Etty's works at the Royal Society of Arts in 1849. It is known that in 1835 it was in the collection of textile entrepreneur Joseph Strutt, but it was not among the paintings sold on his death in 1844. In June 1889 it was bought from an unknown buyer for an unknown sum by Sir Merton Russell-Cotes, and has remained {{in the collection of the}} Russell-Cotes Art Gallery & Museum in Bournemouth ever since. It was shown at an 1899 exhibition of works from Russell-Cotes's collection at the Glasgow Corporation Gallery. This exhibition caused some controversy owing to its supposed obscene nature; in 1894 a number of supposedly obscene prints of works by major artists had been removed from a Glasgow shop by police and magistrates, and it was felt inappropriate for a publicly funded educational body to be displaying a work of equal obscenity. Several luminaries of the art world such as Frederic Leighton intervened, and the exhibition went ahead. The Dawn of Love was also exhibited at a 1955 Arts Council exhibition, and was one of the works exhibited in a major retrospective of Etty's works at the York Art Gallery in 2011–12.|$|E
60|$|The {{appearance}} of the fire urged the pedestrians on, for even the ladies had become eager to witness the miraculous draught. By {{the time they reached}} the bank, which rose above the low point where the fishermen had landed, the moon had sunk behind the top of the western pines, and, as most of the stars were obscured by clouds, there was <b>but</b> little <b>other</b> light <b>than</b> <b>that</b> which proceeded from the fire. At the suggestion of Marmaduke, his companions paused to listen to the conversation of those below them, and examine the party for a moment before they descended to the shore.|$|R
50|$|Everdon {{came from}} the village of Everdon, near Daventry in Northamptonshire, <b>but</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> the fact <b>that</b> he was related to a locally {{prominent}} family of Thorp, nothing else is known of his ancestry. He was a priest in Northamptonshire from 1219. In 1229 he entered the service of Ralph Neville, who was Bishop of Chichester and Lord Chancellor, as a chancery clerk and continued on in the chancery until his election to Carlisle. In 1244 Everdon became Lord Chancellor (holding the post until 1246) and in 1245 he became the Archdeacon of Chester. He was elected to the see of Carlisle about 1 September 1246 but declined the see. He probably declined the see because of concerns over being rewarded for secular work with a clerical office.|$|R
60|$|These things {{gave them}} a rough and disagreeable {{appearance}} with the generality; who thought them turners of the world upside down, as, indeed, in some sense they were: <b>but</b> in no <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>that</b> wherein Paul was so charged, viz. To bring things back into their primitive and right order again. For these and such like practices of theirs were {{not the result of}} humour, or for civil distinction, as some have fancied; but a fruit of inward sense, which God through his holy fear, had begotten in them. They did not consider how to contradict the world, or distinguish themselves as a party from others; it being none of their business, as it was not their interest; no, it was not the result of consultation, or a framed design, by which to declare or recommend schism or novelty. But God having given them a sight of themselves, they saw the whole world in the same glass of truth; and sensibly discerned the affections and passions of men, and the rise and tendency of things; what it was that gratified the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye, and the pride of life, which are not of the Father, but of the world. And from thence sprang, in the night of darkness and apostacy, which hath been over people through their degeneration from the light and Spirit of God, these and many other vain customs, which are seen, by the heavenly day of Christ that dawns in the soul, to be either wrong in their original, or, by time and abuse, hurtful in their practice. And though these things seemed trivial to some, and rendered these people stingy and conceited in such persons' opinion; there was and is more in them, than they were, or are, aware of.|$|R

60|$|She {{understood}} it all, {{and could not}} in her very heart pronounce a judgment against him. She {{knew that he was}} doing that which he believed would be the best for her welfare. She, overwhelmed by the debt of her gratitude, had acceded to his request, and had been unable afterwards to depart from her word. She had said that it should be so, and she could not then turn upon him and declare that when she had given him her hand, she had been unaware of the presence of her other lover. There was an injustice, an unkindness, an ingratitude, a selfishness in this, which forbade her {{to think of it as}} being done by herself. It was better for her that she should suffer, though the suffering should be through her whole life, <b>than</b> <b>that</b> he should be disappointed. No doubt the man would suffer too,--her hero, her lover,--he with whom she would so willingly have risked everything, either with or without the diamonds. She could not, however, bear to think that Mr Whittlestaff should be so very prudent and so very wise solely on her behalf. She would go to him, <b>but</b> for <b>other</b> reasons <b>than</b> <b>that.</b> As she walked about the place half the day, up and down the long walk, she told herself that it was useless to contend with her love. She did love John Gordon; she knew that she loved him with her whole heart; she knew that she must be true to him;--but still she would marry Mr Whittlestaff, and do her duty in that state of life to which it had pleased God to call her. There would be a sacrifice--a sacrifice of two--but still it was justice.|$|R
50|$|The unifying thematic, {{suggested}} by the epigraph, {{is that it is}} a book in which the science fiction stories are largely about the problems of people who do not live in the city of their birth—who have all come to where they are from somewhere else. The epigraph — on the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, from a speaker who clearly has great feeling for the destroyed cities — suggests that his home city has been devastated. In some of the tales, such as the opening story in both books, “The Star-Pit,” the narrator’s family and children have been destroyed in a horrific war many years before and many light years away: a war of a sort, which, in the future the story depicts, has become so common that it would seem to be a background reality gotten through for better or for worse by pretty much everyone who currently survives. And the fantasies, such as “Prismatica,” “Dog in a Fisherman’s Net,” and “Ruins” all deal with the possibilities or the wages of journeying from one's home. Only three Delany SF stories are not included in Aye, and Gomorrah. All three are slight enough so that one can understand why Delany might not wish to preserve them: two are collaborations, one with Harlan Ellison (“The Power of the Nail,” contained in Ellison’s collection of collaborations Partners in Wonder); the other is a page-long prose poem, “The Dying Castles,” which appeared in a 1968 issue of the British SF magazine New Worlds (#200), as under the joint authorship of James Sallis, Samuel R. Delany, and Michael Moorcock. (Several times Delany has said that he has no memory of having written any part of it; and he has assumed the use of his name among the authors was a jape.) The third is a piece only slightly longer called “The Desert of Time,” which was commissioned by Omni Magazine to accompany an illustration in the late 1980s. <b>But</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> the stories <b>that</b> comprise his four-volume Return to Nevèrÿon series, it is fair to say that Aye and Gomorrah represents the totality of Delany’s SF and fantasy short fiction.|$|R

500|$|When Tom is {{introduced}} in the first season finale, he wears a fake beard and old clothes. He continues to appear under this guise throughout the second season, only revealing his beard to be fake in the finale. M. C.

[...] He felt that the episode's writing was an improvement over the previous episodes in the season and that it [...] "really used the storied and rich history of the characters to its advantage." [...] In particular, Gallagher praised Takei's cameo as one of the episode's funniest, even stating it {{to be one of the}} series' best. [...] Alasdair Wilkins of io9 also praised the episode, calling it [...] "a triumph for the new Futurama, and just the sort of episode that leaves me convinced that the show's revival was completely worthwhile."
