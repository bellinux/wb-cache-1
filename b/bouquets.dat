25|$|Thousands {{of flower}} <b>bouquets</b> {{began to appear}} at {{numerous}} locations associated with Meagher, most notably outside the Duchess Boutique and the nearby Brunswick Baptist Church, the latter due to it being near the scene of her disappearance as Meagher was a Roman Catholic.

Some of these <b>bouquets</b> appeared there {{during the time that}} Meagher went missing, but their numbers increased sharply following the news of the discovery of her body on 28 September.

25|$|Yellow flowers such as primrose, rowan, hawthorn, gorse, hazel, and marsh {{marigold}} were placed at doorways and windows in 19th century Ireland, Scotland and Mann. Sometimes loose flowers were strewn {{at the doors}} and windows and sometimes they were made into <b>bouquets,</b> garlands or crosses and fastened to them. They would also be fastened to cows and equipment for milking and butter making. It is likely that such flowers were used because they evoked fire. Similar May Day customs are found across Europe.|$|E

In 1845 he opened a wallpaper factory in Montmartre. Very young, the two brothers, Paul and Henri Biva, learned to draft designs for the family business. Biva's delicacy and sureness of line features, colors and compositions of <b>bouquets</b> and still lifes comes in part from this particular training—also in the artistic context of Montmartre at the time.|$|E

40|$|Chromosome {{architecture}} undergoes extensive, programmed {{changes as}} cells enter meiosis. A highly conserved {{change is the}} clustering of telomeres at the nuclear periphery to form the “bouquet” configuration. In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe the <b>bouquet</b> and associated nuclear movement facilitate initial interactions between homologs. We show that Bqt 2, a meiosis-specific protein required for <b>bouquet</b> formation, is required for wild-type levels of homolog pairing and meiotic allelic recombination. Both gene conversion and crossing over are reduced and exhibit negative interference in bqt 2 Δ mutants, reflecting reduced homolog pairing. While both the <b>bouquet</b> and nuclear movement promote pairing, only the <b>bouquet</b> restricts ectopic recombination (that between dispersed repetitive DNA). We discuss mechanisms by which the <b>bouquet</b> may prevent deleterious translocations by restricting ectopic recombination...|$|R
