Dryden didn't lash {{out at the}} fans. [...] "I'm disappointed, but I can {{understand}} it. The fans wanted us to do real good, and they're frustrated we didn't. I didn't think I deserved to be booed. Tretiak frustrated us, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> I didn't frustrate them enough." ...|$|E
500|$|Lochte said he {{was pleased}} with his {{performance}} at the 2011 World Aquatics Championships but feels that he can improve his times before the 2012 Olympics. [...] "Getting five gold medals is definitely great, but the times that I went, I know I could go a lot faster," [...] he said. [...] "There {{are a lot of}} places in my races that I messed up on that I could have changed and gone faster, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> I have a whole year to make sure I have those perfect swims." ...|$|E

500|$|Beggars Banquet {{was delayed}} for nearly six months due to {{controversy}} over {{the design of the}} album cover, which featured a public toilet with graffiti covering the walls of the stall. Beggars Banquet was well received at the time of release. Richards said, [...] "There is a change between material on Satanic Majesties and Beggars Banquet. I'd grown sick to death of the whole Maharishi guru shit and the beads and bells. Who knows where these things come from, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> [...] was a reaction to what we'd done in our time off and also that severe dose of reality. A spell in prison... will certainly give you room for thought... I was fucking pissed with being busted. So it was, 'Right we'll go and strip this thing down.' There's a lot of anger in the music from that period." ...|$|E
500|$|Leroux {{stated that}} {{at a very early}} age, she knew she wanted to play for the United States women's {{national}} soccer team. To pursue her goal, she moved to Scottsdale, Arizona at the age of 15 and attended Horizon High School during her junior and senior years while living with multiple host families. Despite having a challenging time adjusting to life without her family and friends, she helped lead Sereno Soccer Club to state titles in 2007 and 2008. Of her move to the United States, she said, [...] "It was not easy. It {{was probably one of the}} most difficult things I ever had to do, move away from everything that I knew and was comfortable with to something that I had no idea about. Not having any family around. Doing it on my own. As a 15-year-old, that's kind of hard. I had to grow up really fast [...] <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> it's all worth it. Now I have a chance to prove myself, and that's what I enjoy, and that's why I did what I did." ...|$|E
500|$|... "I Could Fall in Love" [...] {{is similar}} to [...] "Dreaming of You" [...] in its lyrics. Many media outlets, {{including}} the Milwaukee Journal and Billboard magazine, called them [...] "confessional ballads", with an emotionally vulnerable narrator who wants true love but finds it unattainable. Tarradell believed [...] "I Could Fall in Love" [...] was an indirect response to Selena's father and manager Abraham Quintanilla, Jr., who forced her and Perez to end their relationship just because Perez was a rocker. Tarradell asserted that the words [...] "I know it's not right <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> I should {{try to do what}} I should do" [...] were directed at Abraham and reflected Selena's realization of her independence. Ramiro Burr of the San Antonio Express-News believed that Selena's 1992 song [...] "Missing My Baby" [...] shared similarities with [...] "I Could Fall in Love" [...] in expressing uncontrollable [...] "adrenalin-fueled love". Burr later wrote that the difference in [...] "I Could Fall in Love" [...] is that the lyrics are recorded with [...] "powerful agony" [...] which forces the narrator to [...] "fall into a phase of deep loneliness" [...] because her lover may or may not reciprocate her feelings.|$|E

It was his disobedience, his want of trust, that brought this unspeakable misery on us all." ...|$|R

In an interview in 2005, after the original line-up had reformed, he said, [...] "Bug is my least favourite of all our records.

500|$|Fan {{reaction}} was largely positive, though certain fans {{complained that the}} game was a far departure from its predecessor, Chrono Trigger; Chrono Cross broke convention by featuring more characters, fewer double and triple techs, fewer instances of time travel, and few appearances of Trigger characters and locations. Producer Hiromichi Tanaka and director Masato Kato {{were aware of the}} changes in development, specifically intending to provide an experience different from Chrono Trigger. Kato anticipated and rebuffed this discontent before the game's release, wondering what the Chrono title meant to these fans and whether his messages ever [...] "really got through to them". He continued, [...] "Cross is undoubtedly the highest quality Chrono that we can create right now. (I won't say the 'best' Chrono, but) If you can't accept that, then I'm sorry to say this <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> your Chrono and my Chrono have taken totally different paths. But I would like to say, thank you for falling in love with Trigger so much." [...] Tanaka added, [...] "Of course, the fans of the original are very important, but what innovation can come about when you're bound to the past? I believe that gameplay should evolve with the hardware." ...|$|E
500|$|Brewer told a Channel 5 website writer {{that the}} rain was the biggest {{challenge}} of the night shoot, as it was [...] "beyond freezing". She also revealed that she ran in shoes {{that she had not}} broken in and they made her feet bleed. The actress added [...] "It was incredibly stressful <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> it was stress in a good way. There were months of preparation involved so that it could run like clockwork. So I guess it was stressful in the sense the emotional stakes were heightened for a two-week period. It was exhausting and I think we can all say we were happy once it was over. But the final result was worth it." [...] McGregor filmed his final scene out of sequence at the Melbourne studios. He explained that they had already shot Mark's last scene on location, then went back inside to do the studio shots. He revealed [...] "The final thing I filmed was a conversation between Mark and Kyle, where they're saying goodbye. It was a bit sad, but it was basically just these two guys hugging each other – with the cast and crew watching!" ...|$|E
500|$|Bible Student Alexander H. Macmillan, {{who served}} as an aide to the {{executive}} committee, later wrote that tensions at the Watch Tower Society headquarters mounted as the day for election of the Society's officers approached. He wrote: [...] "A few ambitious ones at headquarters were holding caucuses here and there, doing a little electioneering to get their men in. However, Van Amburgh and I held {{a large number of}} votes. Many shareholders, knowing of our long association with Russell, sent their proxies to us to be cast for the one whom we thought best fitted for office." [...] Macmillan, who claimed he had declined an offer from an ailing Russell months earlier to accept the position of president after his death, agreed with Van Amburgh that Rutherford was the best candidate. According to Macmillan, [...] "Rutherford did not know what was going on. He certainly didn't do any electioneering or canvassing for votes, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> he was doing some worrying, knowing if he was elected he would have a big job on his hands ... There is no doubt in our minds that the Lord's will was done in this choice. It is certain that Rutherford himself {{had nothing to do with}} it." ...|$|E

500|$|While {{working at}} the studio, Herren met Joshua Kay and Romulo del Castillo, two Miami-based {{producers}} who had founded Schematic Records, a label known for IDM. Herren recorded and composed music on his MPC and manipulated it to fit Schematic's aesthetic. While {{working at the}} recording studio, Herren felt that the hip hop musicians coming in had very trite lyrics, and felt he could use them for his own Prefuse 73 material. For Vocal Studies + Uprock Narratives, Herren sampled more famous hip hop records by artists including Nas, Ol' Dirty Bastard and Erykah Badu. Herren stated that he used some of his favorite MCs instead of the musicians he worked with, as he felt these artists were [...] "saying totally relevant stuff, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> it was just my excitement to make it happen. But a vocal doesn't have to say anything. Why not challenge people's imagination and let it say whatever they want it to?" [...] For Vocal Studies + Uprock Narratives, Herren created the music using two turntables plugged into his MPC. To create the glitch sounds through the MPC, Herren switched between different sample sources by instantaneously silencing groups of audio channels at the same time.|$|E
500|$|The song {{begins with}} a brief {{introduction}} in which Eminem says while the chorus plays underneath, [...] "Yeh, it's been a ride. I guess I {{had to go to}} that place to get to this one." [...] When he begins the first verse, his lyrics threaten people who have looked down on him: [...] "You can try to read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em/ But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em." [...] On the second verse, Eminem says that he has indeed made mistakes, commenting on his Relapse album: [...] "That last Relapse CD was ehh/ Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground/ Relax, I ain't going to do that now." [...] When he says [...] "All I'm trying to say is get back, click clack, pow", a gunshot is heard. Approaching {{the end of the second}} verse, Eminem raps about his personal experiences: [...] "But I think I'm still trying to figure this crap out/ Thought I had it mapped out, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> I didn't/ It's time to exercise these demons/ These motherfuckers are doing jumping jacks now." [...] After the chorus, Eminem sings a bridge and focuses on a positive change, as he says [...] "I just can't keep living this way, so starting today I'm breaking out of this cage." [...] Before the final chorus, he says that he [...] "shoots for the moon". The song features a choir composed of Kip Blackshire, Christal Garrick II, Terry Dexter, Rich King, Kristen Ashley Cole and Sly Jordan.|$|E
500|$|Freya Jarman-Ivens, one of {{the authors}} of Madonna's Drowned Worlds, felt that the song was {{one of the}} last works on pure romanticism by Madonna. [...] "She should come back to the formula from time to time, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> she has moved beyond all of that", Jarman-Ivens added. Carol Clerk, author of Madonnastyle noted that the [...] "refreshing" [...] nature of the song was {{particularly}} noticeable if one follows Madonna's catalog chronologically, especially embedded between the anthem like nature of the previous release, [...] "Express Yourself", and the lament of the succeeding release, [...] "Oh Father". Scholar Maria Raha wrote in her book Cinderella's Big Score: Women of the Punk and Indie Underground that the song was full of [...] "trite" [...] lyrics. Andy Goldberg from The Jerusalem Post said that [...] "Cherish" [...] took [...] "Madonna back to her old stomping grounds, the lively bass line and lilting melodies of hit albums past." [...] Kevin Phinney from Austin American-Statesman was surprised by Madonna's contribution to the song and confessed that he [...] " [...] it difficult to be believe that she even wrote this?" [...] Phinney continued that he wanted Madonna to go in a more mature direction and compose songs musically similar to [...] "Cherish". Writing for The Washington Post, Richard Harrington explained that [...] "while songs on Like a Prayer dealt with matters opening her heart, with 'Cherish' Madonna dealt with matters which were close to her heart." [...] This view was also shared by Ian Blair from Chicago Tribune who categorized the song as being sung for the [...] "happy-go-lucky lovers and dreamers". The Dallas Morning News Lennox Samuels appreciated the light-hearted theme of the song and complimented Madonna and Leonard for not sticking with personal subject matters only on the album. Dale Anderson from The Buffalo News opined that the song would become one of Madonna's most forgettable releases, but was also hopeful that it would not. This opinion was shared by Don McCleese of Chicago Sun-Times, who added that [...] "Cherish" [...] was not something expected from Madonna at that point of time. McCleese was disappointed that Madonna went back to the [...] "happy-go-lucky, lovey-dovey" [...] kind of songs, which did not match her self-image. Dan DeLuca from The Philadelphia Inquirer, while reviewing Madonna's Drowned World Tour in 2001, compared [...] "Cherish" [...] with songs by Chris Robinson, humorously adding that [...] "only if he was gay he would sing something like that." ...|$|E

500|$|Imperial Bedrooms {{opens with}} an {{acknowledgement}} from Clay, the main character, {{that both the}} Less Than Zero novel and its film adaption are actual representational works within the narrative of his life: [...] "The movie {{was based on a}} book by someone we knew... It was labeled fiction but only a few details had been altered and our names weren't changed and there was nothing in it that hadn't happened." [...] The Los Angeles Times described this as a [...] "nifty little trick", as it allows Ellis to establish the newer book [...] "as the primary narrative, one that trumps Ellis as author and the real world." [...] The San Francisco Chronicle calls it a [...] "neat trick of authorial self-abnegation". Another reviewer describes it as Ellis at [...] "his most ambitious", a [...] "Philip Rothian, doppelgänger gambit", making his new narrator [...] "the real Clay" [...] and the other an imposter. This allows Ellis to skilfully, [...] "with writerly jujitsu", acknowledge Robert Downey Jr.'s popular performance as Julian in the moralistic 1987 film, in which he died; Ellis appreciates the adaptation as a [...] "milestone in a lot of ways". The device also allows the novelist to insert self-critique; The Sunday Times reviewer notes that Imperial Bedrooms finds its characters [...] "still a little sore at their depiction as inarticulate zombies". John Crace, in his [...] "digested read" [...] of Imperial Bedrooms, insinuates through parody that [...] "the author" [...] of the metafictional Less Than Zero is also meant to be Ellis, describing him in Clay's voice as [...] "too immersed in the passivity of writing and too pleased with his own style to bother with many commas to admit it so he wrote me into the story as the man who was too frightened to love." [...] With regard to the opening narrative conceit, Ellis queries [...] "Is it complication ... or is it clarification?", opining that it certainly is the latter for Clay. Even though Ellis never names himself explicitly in the book, he conceded to Lawson that one can [...] "guess [...] is who the Clay of Imperial Bedrooms is referring to." [...] Ellis did, however, reveal that he had not decided when writing the novel whether Clay was referring to him or not. Eileen Battersby likened Bedrooms to Lunar Park (2005), cited his use of [...] "self-consciousness as a device." [...] This device was picked up on by several other critics—in particular, Vice noted that [...] "the scatological violence of American Psycho" [...] and [...] "the otherworldly terror of Lunar Park" [...] had here been combined. Ellis himself raised the [...] "sequel" [...] question, commenting [...] "...I don't think it is [...] Well, I mean, it is and it isn't. It's narrated by him, sure. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> I could maybe have switched the names around and it could stand alone." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{began to}} read screenplays that were being made, and I {{hesitate}} to say this, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> I read them and said: 'Christ, I could do that.'"
