40|$|Integrating {{physical}} objects (smart objects) and enterprise IT {{systems is}} still a labor intensive, mainly manual task done by domain experts. On one hand, enterprise IT <b>backend</b> <b>systems</b> are based on service oriented architectures (SOA) and driven by business rule engines or business process execution engines. Smart objects {{on the other hand}} are often programmed at very low levels. In this paper we describe an approach that makes the integration of smart objects with such <b>backends</b> <b>systems</b> easier. We introduce semantic endpoint descriptions based on Linked USDL. Furthermore, we show how different communication patterns can be integrated into these endpoint descriptions. The strength of our endpoint descriptions is that they can be used to automatically create REST or SOAP endpoints for enterprise systems, even if which they are not able to talk to the smart objects directly. We evaluate our proposed solution with CoAP, UDP and 6 LoWPAN, as we anticipate the industry converge towards these standards. Nonetheless, our approach also allows easy integration with <b>backend</b> <b>systems,</b> even if no standardized protocol is used...|$|R

While PCI/PCIe tuner cards and USB tuners for DVB-S and DVB-S2 are available, there are often issues with drivers, or the cards may simply not be compatible with the backend software in use. Therefore, setting up such a system for FTA satellite reception tends to require considerably more technical knowledge, and a willingness to work through issues, than setting up such a system for receiving terrestrial signals.|$|E

System administrators can configure the device drivers which CUPS supplies by editing text files in Adobe's PostScript Printer Description (PPD) format. There are a number of user interfaces for different platforms that can configure CUPS, and it has a built-in web-based interface.

5000|$|In September 2008 the General Accounting Office (GAO) {{released}} a report identifying concerns by the Army that DIMHRS may not meet their requirements and outlining problems with its design and implementation. DoD planned for the Army to deploy DIMHRS and has postponed deployment four times with deployment then scheduled for March 2009. Several problems were encountered during the development process. 1. The conversion of Army data into DIMHRS (PeopleSoft) fields - Years of [...] "home-grown" [...] systems built up a myriad of data elements {{that in many cases}} did not match similar fields in different systems. The problem was further compounded when data updates fell out of sync due to this exact problem. 2. The failure of properly documenting program specifications. - Fault for this lies on everyone involved in the program with the Army's incredibly intricate processes being generalize too much and the contractor unable or unwilling to make changes to the overall PeopleSoft platform. 3. The requirement to keep the [...] "PeopleSoft" [...] <b>backend</b> <b>system</b> as unchanged as possible. - This began a struggle of trying to make the system conform to normal military business processes and military business processes modified to meet a commercial application's built-in procedures. Simple concepts, such as personnel movement became a challenge to replicate using PeopleSoft built-in procedures. A comment during a meeting from NGIT developers, [...] "you guys (Army SMEs) just don't know how to properly manage people..." [...] 4. DoD lack of efficient requirements communication to the Army. - Although DoD has taken steps to improve its communication of DIMHRS requirements to the Army, the Army continued to have concerns, including a lack of (1) assurance that Army requirements are covered in DIMHRS and (2) timely access to summary information on system requirements changes. Without effective communication, the Army has difficulty performing the gap analyses needed to determine which business processes to develop or adjust as it prepares for deployment of DIMHRS. If the Army does not have system information in time to adjust its business processes, the Army may not be prepared to deploy the system or may deploy it prematurely, which could affect servicemembers’ pay. DOD’s efforts to improve its communications with the Army regarding the DIMHRS program’s system capabilities does not include clearly defining and documenting a process that maintains effective communications of the differences between DIMHRS’s capabilities and Army requirements. DOD has committed the Army to deploy DIMHRS in March 2009 as a result of postponing its October 2008 date. However, without DOD establishing a clearly defined process for maintaining effective, timely communications, the Army may not be prepared to deploy the system when scheduled, and DOD may deliver a system that will require extensive and expensive investments.In a recent development, announced 25 Nov 2008, the IOC date of 1 Mar 2009 has been officially rescinded.
