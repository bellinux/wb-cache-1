5|$|In November 1921, Saint-Saëns gave a recital at the Institut {{for a large}} invited audience; it was {{remarked that}} his playing was as vivid and precise as ever, and that his {{personal}} bearing was admirable {{for a man of}} eighty-six. He left Paris a month later for Algiers, with the intention of wintering there, as he had long <b>been</b> <b>accustomed</b> <b>to</b> do. While there, he died without warning of a heart attack on 16 December 1921. His body was taken back to Paris, and after a state funeral at the Madeleine he was buried at the Cimetière de Montparnasse. Heavily veiled, in an inconspicuous place among the mourners from France's political and artistic élite, was his widow, Marie-Laure, whom he had last seen in 1881.|$|E
5|$|Future stops {{included}} Chicago, Cleveland, and Detroit, {{among other}} locations. Starting with the St. Joseph's game, the Webfoots had a streak {{in which they}} played four games in five days before Christmas Eve. On December 20, Oregon routed Miami (Ohio) 74–38, as Sarpola led the team with 20 points. Wintermute suffered an ankle injury during the game. The Webfoots then defeated Canisius by a 12-point margin. In the next game, against an undefeated Wayne State team, the Webfoots entered halftime tied at 22–22 and needed a late burst of scoring, led by Gale and Johansen, to clinch an 11-point victory. After the Miami (Ohio) game, Wintermute missed three of the team's following four games. The Webfoots won without him in their next two games, {{but not in the}} game in which he returned to action against Bradley. In Peoria, Illinois, Oregon fell behind by 17 points at halftime and lost 52–39, as Bradley center Dar Hutchins tallied 17 points while defended by Wintermute, who was playing through his ankle injury. Following their loss to Bradley, Oregon traveled to the Chicago Coliseum for a game against Western Illinois State Teachers College. Despite being without the services of Wintermute again, the Webfoots posted a 60–45 victory. Drake, the Webfoots' opponent on December 29 in Chicago, was defeated by 11 points. The final game of the road trip, held in San Francisco on New Year's Eve, saw the Webfoots lose to Stanford. The stretch proved profitable for the school, which made $4,400 off of the East Coast games, and Dick credited the trip for giving the Webfoots exposure to different styles of play than they had <b>been</b> <b>accustomed</b> <b>to.</b>|$|E
5|$|Kaleski's {{standard}} {{was adopted by}} breed clubs in Queensland and New South Wales and re-issued as their own, with local changes. His writings from the 1910s give an important insight into {{the early history of}} the breed. However, dog breeder and author Noreen Clark has noted that his opinions are sometimes just that, and he introduces some contradictory assertions in his later writings, as well as some assumptions that are illogical in the light of modern science. Some of these have persisted; for example he saw the red colour form as having more dingo in it than the blue form, and there is a persistent belief that reds are more vicious than blues. The most enduring of Kaleski's myths relate to Dalmatian and Kelpie infusions into the early Cattle Dog breed. These infusions are not referred to in Kaleski's writings until the 1920s and it seems likely that Kaleski sought to explain the Cattle Dog's mottled colouration and tan on legs by similarity to the Dalmatian and Kelpie, respectively. The genetics of coat colour, and the current understanding of hereditary characteristics, make the infusion of Dalmatian to increase the cattle dog's tolerance of horses an extremely unlikely event. There were relatively few motor vehicles in Australia {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century, so most dogs of any breed would have <b>been</b> <b>accustomed</b> <b>to</b> horses. The Kelpie breed was developed after the Cattle Dog type was described, so its infusion is unlikely. It is possible that there was some infusion of Bull Terrier but there is no verifiable record of this, and the Cattle Dog has not had the Bull Terrier's instinct to bite and hold, which would have been an undesirable trait. Early in the 1900s there was considerable in-fighting amongst members of the Cattle Dog Club, and a series of arguments about the origin of the breed appeared in newspapers and journals of the time. While many of these arguments were misleading, some irrational, and the majority not supported by historical facts, they continue to be circulated, resulting in a number of theories on the origins of the breed. In recent years, information technology enabling the manipulation of large databases combined with advances in the understanding of canine genetics has allowed a clearer understanding of the development of the breed.|$|E

25|$|James I had poor {{relations}} with the English Parliament, which had been less submissive than the Scottish Estates that he had <b>been</b> <b>accustomed</b> <b>to.</b> To raise funds without taxation, James began to sell titles. For instance, individuals paying £1095 could obtain the non-peerage hereditary dignity of baronet. Even peerage dignities were sold. Thus, James I added sixty-two peers to a body that had included just fifty-nine members at the commencement of his reign. His Stuart successors were no less profuse.|$|E

At this point in the war the carriers were facing significantly less air opposition—certainly less than Vorse had <b>been</b> <b>accustomed</b> <b>to</b> during his time with VFs 2, 3 and 6. Japan's experienced aviators were dwindling, as were its carriers, which it guarded jealously for the final conflict.

25|$|However, an {{increasing}} number of reports circulated about friction in the marriage, with speculation that this may have been due to Alice's making do with less money than she had once <b>been</b> <b>accustomed</b> <b>to.</b> It was said that she was strongly interested in fame and fortune, and when household finances dwindled, she complained bitterly. Bunten wrote in her Life of Alice Barnham that, upon their descent into debt, she went on trips to ask for financial favours and assistance from their circle of friends. Bacon disinherited her upon discovering her secret romantic relationship with Sir John Underhill.

25|$|Beginning in {{the late}} eighteenth century, a {{significant}} number of physicians started to attend births. Their prominence in childbirth increased drastically into {{the turn of the twentieth}} century, almost rendering midwives obsolete. However, the increase of physician-attended births coincided with an increase demand of newly arrived European immigrants who have <b>been</b> <b>accustomed</b> <b>to</b> midwifery from their cultures. Moreover, poor women and African Americans, particularly those living in the South, traditionally employed midwives as well. In fact, in the early twentieth century, midwives attended as many as 90 percent of all black births in the southern states. For reasons of culture, language, and cost, midwives did not completely disappear despite the rise in physician-attended births at the turn of the twentieth century.|$|E
25|$|The city of Kabul {{has been}} home to many musicians who were masters of both {{traditional}} and modern Afghan music. Traditional music is especially popular during the Nowruz (New Year) and National Independence Day celebrations. Ahmad Zahir, Nashenas, Ustad Sarahang, Sarban, Ubaidullah Jan, Farhad Darya, and Naghma {{are some of the}} notable Afghan musicians, but there are many others. Afghans have long <b>been</b> <b>accustomed</b> <b>to</b> watching Indian Bollywood films and listening to its filmi songs. Many Bollywood film stars have roots in Afghanistan, including Salman Khan, Saif Ali Khan, Shah Rukh Khan (SRK), Aamir Khan, Feroz Khan, Kader Khan, Naseeruddin Shah, Zarine Khan, Celina Jaitly, and a number of others. Several Bollywood films have been shot inside Afghanistan, including Dharmatma, Khuda Gawah, Escape from Taliban, and Kabul Express.|$|E
25|$|The 19th {{century was}} also a new era for Europe. Church power was declining, and friars began coming to the Philippines, ending hopes that the friars would {{relinquish}} their posts. With {{the opening of the}} Suez Canal, the voyage between Spain and the Philippines was made shorter. More peninsulares (Spaniards born in Spain) began pouring into the colony and started to occupy the various government positions traditionally held by the criollos (Spaniards born in the Philippines). In the 300 years of colonial rule, the criollos had <b>been</b> <b>accustomed</b> <b>to</b> being semi-autonomous with the governor-general, who was the only Spaniard (peninsulares) government official.

She is looking much healthier than the family has <b>been</b> <b>accustomed</b> <b>to,</b> and they remark frequently on her improved appearance. However, she still retains the haggard facial features of a long-time addict. As a recovering addict, she is restless and anxious. She also suffers from insomnia, which is not made any easier by her husband and children's loud snoring. When Edmund, her younger son, hears her moving around at night and entering the spare bedroom, he becomes alarmed, {{because this is the}} room where, in the past, she would satisfy her morphine addiction. He questions her about it indirectly. She reassures him that she just went there to get away from her husband's snoring.|$|E
25|$|Mirren says {{transforming}} {{herself into}} the Queen came almost naturally after the wig and glasses, since she shares a default facial expression—a slightly downturned mouth – with the monarch. She regularly reviewed film and video footage of Elizabeth and kept photographs in her trailer during production. She also undertook extensive voice coaching, faithfully reproducing the Queen's delivery of her televised speech to the world. Morgan has said that her performance was so convincing that, {{by the end of}} production, crew members who had <b>been</b> <b>accustomed</b> <b>to</b> slouching or relaxing when they addressed her were standing straight up and respectfully folding their hands behind their backs. Mirren arranged to spend time off-camera with the supporting cast playing other members of the Royal Family, including James Cromwell, Alex Jennings and Sylvia Syms so they would be as comfortable with each other as a real family.|$|E
25|$|In December, Canadian-born Sydney Newman {{arrived at}} BBC Television {{as the new}} Head of Drama. Newman was a science fiction fan who had overseen several such {{productions}} in his previous positions at ABC Television and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. In March 1963, he was made aware by Baverstock – now promoted to Controller of Programmes – of {{a gap in the}} schedule on Saturday evenings between the sports showcase Grandstand and the pop music programme Juke Box Jury. Ideally, any programme scheduled here would appeal to children that had previously <b>been</b> <b>accustomed</b> <b>to</b> the timeslot; the teenaged audience of Juke Box Jury; and the adult sports fan audience of Grandstand. Newman decided that a science fiction programme would be perfect to fill the gap, and enthusiastically took up the existing Script Department research, initiating several brainstorming sessions with Wilson, Braybon, Frick and another BBC staff writer, C. E. 'Bunny' Webber.|$|E

25|$|Two {{opposing}} {{views of}} Saul {{are found in}} classical rabbinical literature. One {{is based on the}} reverse logic that punishment is a proof of guilt, and therefore seeks to rob Saul of any halo which might surround him; typically this view is similar to the republican source. The passage referring to Saul as a choice young man, and goodly (1 Samuel 9:2) is in this view interpreted as meaning that Saul was not good in every respect, but goodly only with respect to his personal appearance (Num. Rashi 9:28). According to this view, Saul is only a weak branch (Gen. Rashi 25:3), owing his kingship not to his own merits, but rather to his grandfather, who had <b>been</b> <b>accustomed</b> <b>to</b> light the streets for those who went to the bet ha-midrash, and had received as his reward the promise that one of his grandsons should sit upon the throne (Lev. Rashi 9:2).|$|E
25|$|Her father, {{as well as}} his {{elder brother}} Timothy, and, still more, a son of the latter, had <b>been</b> <b>accustomed</b> <b>to</b> write in {{measured}} rhyme, their poems sometimes appearing in the local papers; and perhaps it was not strange that Harriett should, as soon as she could hold a pen, make crude attempts in the same direction. She was furnished with a copy book in which she wrote slowly and laboriously; and she soon turned surreptitiously {{to the back of the}} book and werote loose rhymes that were jingling in her brain. On one occasion, the teacher passed by her desk when she was just finishing a rhymed account of some event which had occurred in the school room. Something must have attracted the teacher's attention; for he noticed her book, grabbed it, and, after running it through by himself, with a laugh, he proceeded to read it aloud to the school. When class was over, she scurried home. Thought her father soothed her ruffled mood, her copy-book confidences were discontinued.|$|E
