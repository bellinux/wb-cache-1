5|$|It is a bird of open sclerophyll forests, {{eucalypt}} and acacia woodlands and scrublands, with sparse or no understory, or low {{cover with}} shrubs such as Triodia, Lomandra or Hibbertia. It is less common in mallee scrub. In arid areas and northern Australia, {{it is more}} restricted to woodland alongside rivers and billabongs. It has <b>become</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> in southwest Western Australia with land clearing, though has become rare around Darwin on account of urban development.|$|E
5|$|Policy {{interventions}} to decrease passive smoking in public {{areas such as}} restaurants and workplaces have <b>become</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> in many Western countries. Bhutan has had a complete smoking ban since 2005 while India introduced a ban on smoking in public in October 2008. The World Health Organization has called for governments to institute a total ban on tobacco advertising to prevent young people from taking up smoking. They assess that such bans have reduced tobacco consumption by 16% where instituted.|$|E
5|$|The {{traditional}} family {{structure in the}} United States is considered a family support system involving two married individuals providing care and stability for their biological offspring. However, this two-parent, nuclear family has become less prevalent, and alternative family forms have <b>become</b> <b>more</b> <b>common.</b> The family is created at birth and establishes ties across generations. Those generations, the extended family of aunts, uncles, grandparents, and cousins, can hold significant emotional and economic roles for the nuclear family.|$|E

5|$|Though {{dopamine}} agonists {{are less}} effective than levodopa at controlling PD motor symptoms, {{they are usually}} effective enough to manage these symptoms {{in the first years}} of treatment. Dyskinesias due to dopamine agonists are rare in younger people who have PD but, along with other complications, <b>become</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> with older age at onset. Thus dopamine agonists are the preferred initial treatment for younger onset PD, and levodopa is preferred for older onset PD.|$|E
5|$|Whale was {{openly gay}} {{throughout}} his career, {{something that was}} very unusual in the 1920s and 1930s. As knowledge of his sexual orientation has <b>become</b> <b>more</b> <b>common,</b> some of his films, Bride of Frankenstein in particular, have been interpreted as having a gay subtext {{and it has been}} claimed that his refusal to remain in the closet led {{to the end of his}} career.|$|E
5|$|Although most {{mutations}} {{that change}} protein sequences are harmful or neutral, some mutations have benefits. These mutations may enable the mutant organism to withstand particular environmental stresses better than wild type organisms, or reproduce more quickly. In these cases a mutation {{will tend to}} <b>become</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> in a population through natural selection. Viruses that use RNA as their genetic material have rapid mutation rates, which can be an advantage, since these viruses thereby evolve rapidly, and thus evade the immune system defensive responses. In large populations of asexually reproducing organisms, for example, E. coli, multiple beneficial mutations may co-occur. This phenomenon is called clonal interference and causes competition among the mutations.|$|E

5|$|During the summer, the American white ibis roams {{along the}} coast of tidal flats and {{mangrove}} swamps as the inland marshes are usually flooded. However, as the water level recedes in the fall, populations at the coast shift their foraging area inland, to inland marshes and swamplands. It has <b>become</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> in urban landscapes in Florida since the late 1990s, and is {{one of a number of}} wetland-dependent bird species which forages in man-made ponds on golf courses in the southwest of the state.|$|E
5|$|Education of {{the young}} was never {{considered}} to be the primary domain of schools, even after they had <b>become</b> <b>more</b> <b>common.</b> Most education was carried out by a child's parents or foster parents. Formal apprenticeships were not the norm in Plymouth; it was expected that a foster family would teach the children whatever trades they themselves practiced. The church also {{played a central role in}} a child's education. As noted above, the primary purpose of teaching children to read was so that they could read the Bible for themselves.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{selection}} acts on the phenotype, or {{the observable}} characteristics of an organism, but the genetic (heritable) basis of any phenotype {{that gives a}} reproductive advantage may <b>become</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> in a population. Over time, this process can result in populations that specialise for particular ecological niches (microevolution) and may eventually result in speciation (the emergence of new species, macroevolution). In other words, natural selection is a key process {{in the evolution of}} a population. Natural selection can be contrasted with artificial selection, in which humans intentionally choose specific traits, whereas in natural selection there is no intentional choice.|$|E
5000|$|The {{hourglass}} {{also found}} popularity on land. As {{the use of}} mechanical clocks to indicate the times of events like church services <b>became</b> <b>more</b> <b>common,</b> creating a [...] "need {{to keep track of}} time", the demand for time-measuring devices increased. Hourglasses were essentially inexpensive, as they required no rare technology to make and their contents were not hard to come by, and as the manufacturing of these instruments <b>became</b> <b>more</b> <b>common,</b> their uses <b>became</b> <b>more</b> practical.|$|R

5|$|Not {{only have}} the {{symbionts}} and specific species been shown to shift, {{but there seems to}} be a certain growth rate favorable to selection. Slower-growing but more heat-tolerant corals have <b>become</b> <b>more</b> <b>common.</b> The changes in temperature and acclimation are complex. Some reefs in current shadows represent a refugium location that will help them adjust to the disparity in the environment even if eventually the temperatures may rise more quickly there than in other locations. This separation of populations by climatic barriers causes a realized niche to shrink greatly in comparison to the old fundamental niche.|$|E
5|$|Some {{adjectives}} are inflected for {{degree of}} comparison, with the positive degree unmarked, the suffix -er marking the comparative, and -est marking the superlative: a small boy, {{the boy is}} smaller than the girl, that boy is the smallest. Some adjectives have irregular comparative and superlative forms, such as good, better, and best. Other adjectives have comparatives formed by periphrastic constructions, with the adverb more marking the comparative, and most marking the superlative: happier or more happy, the happiest or most happy. There is some variation among speakers regarding which adjectives use inflected or periphrastic comparison, and some studies have shown a tendency for the periphrastic forms to <b>become</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> {{at the expense of}} the inflected form.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{popular as}} a caged {{bird in the}} 19th century, the {{turquoise}} parrot was rarely seen in captivity between 1928 and 1956, the main problem being {{the high rate of}} infertile eggs. It has <b>become</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> since, and has adapted readily to aviculture. A quiet species, it likes to bathe in captivity. There is a possibility of interbreeding {{with other members of the}} genus Neophema if caged together. Specimens with more prominent orange bellies have been bred, sourced from wild birds in New South Wales and not from breeding with scarlet-chested parrots. A yellow form, where the blue pigment is lost and yellow and red pigments are conserved, first appeared in the 1950s in aviculture. It is a recessive mutation. Other colour forms seen are a red-fronted and pied form (both recessive), and jade and olive (dominant).|$|E

5|$|The {{practice}} <b>became</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> {{during the}} 17th century—11 people were made Benchers between 1600 and 1630—and in 1614 {{one of the}} Benchers appointed was explicitly allowed {{to be a member}} of Pension. This <b>became</b> <b>more</b> <b>common,</b> creating a two-rank system in which both Readers and Benchers were members of Pension. However far more Readers were appointed than Benchers—50 between 1600 and 1630—and it appeared that Readers would remain the higher rank despite this change.|$|R
5|$|OCD is a {{relatively}} rare disorder, with an estimated incidence of 15 to 30 cases per 100,000 persons per year. Widuchowski W et al. found OCD to {{be the cause of}} articular cartilage defects in 2% of cases in a study of 25,124 knee arthroscopies. Although rare, OCD is noted as an important cause of joint pain in active adolescents. The juvenile form of the disease occurs in children with open growth plates, usually between the ages 5 and 15 years and occurs more commonly in males than females, with a ratio between 2:1 and 3:1. However, OCD has <b>become</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> among adolescent females as they become more active in sports. The adult form, which occurs in those who have reached skeletal maturity, is most commonly found in people 16 to 50 years old.|$|E
5|$|As railroads {{began to}} <b>become</b> <b>more</b> <b>common,</b> {{attendance}} of the Mountain Grove Campground began to decline. The attendance of the campground dropped severely in 1891. On July 9, 1891, the campground placed {{an unusually large}} advertisement in a local newspaper. Attendance continued to drop in 1892. The decline continued, despite efforts by the campground directors {{to increase the number}} of Chautauqua speakers and religious speakers. Attempts were made throughout the 1890s to stave off the impending failure of the campground, but were largely unsuccessful. Later, the Board of Managers decided that they would open the campground specifically for special events, such as the Bloomsburg Methodist Church's plans for an eleven-car special train to carry picnickers and a band there. By the mid-1890s, it was permitted for visitors to bring their own supplies, rent multiple tents, and decide whether to stay for one or two weeks. A short branch line of the Danville, Hazleton, and Wilkes-Barre Railroad was then built to allow easier transport of visitors' baggage to the campground. Baggage carrying was also done for free and the attendance fee was also reduced. Only one of the twenty-five prominent local families who attended the camp meeting in the 1880s still attended it in the 1890s.|$|E
5|$|Recombination allows alleles on {{the same}} strand of DNA to become separated. However, the rate of {{recombination}} is low (approximately two events per chromosome per generation). As a result, genes close together on a chromosome {{may not always be}} shuffled away from each other and genes that are close together tend to be inherited together, a phenomenon known as linkage. This tendency is measured by finding how often two alleles occur together on a single chromosome compared to expectations, which is called their linkage disequilibrium. A set of alleles that is usually inherited in a group is called a haplotype. This can be important when one allele in a particular haplotype is strongly beneficial: natural selection can drive a selective sweep that will also cause the other alleles in the haplotype to <b>become</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> in the population; this effect is called genetic hitchhiking or genetic draft. Genetic draft caused by the fact that some neutral genes are genetically linked to others that are under selection can be partially captured by an appropriate effective population size.|$|E
