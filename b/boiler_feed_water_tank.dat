The first {{objective of the}} present study was to find the component with primary irreversibility or exergy destruction in the system. In addition, the effect of different operation conditions such as boiler pressure and output power on the irreversibility of components was investigated. Based on the results, it was found that <b>boiler</b> and <b>feed</b> <b>water</b> <b>tank</b> has the maximum and minimum irreversibility in the system, respectively. Then, the boiler as the primary exergy destruction component in the system was focused. The boiler was divided into three regions namely: combustion, heat transfer, exhaust and the irreversibility in each region was evaluated. The results showed that the maximum part of irreversibility belongs to the heat transfer region with about 54. 8 % followed by 39 % and 6 % for combustion and exhaust regions, respectively...|$|R

50|$|Industrial {{cogeneration}} plants normally {{operate at}} much lower boiler pressures than utilities.

40|$|Proper {{treatment}} of <b>boiler</b> <b>feed</b> <b>water</b> {{is an important}} part of operating and maintaining a boiler system. As steam is produced, dissolved solids become concentrated and form deposits inside the boiler. This leads to poor heat transfer and reduces the efficiency of the boiler. Dissolved gasses such as oxygen and carbon dioxide will react with the metals in the boiler system and lead to boiler corrosion. In order to protect the boiler from these contaminates, they should be controlled or removed. There are several different technologies that are widely used in the industry for removing these contaminants. Dissolved solids can be removed with reverse osmosis membrane and ion exchange systems. Dissolved gasses have historically been removed using forced draft degasifiers, chemical agents and steam deareators Recently Membrane Contactors have been utilized to remove the dissolved gasses in <b>boiler</b> <b>feed</b> <b>water.</b> Membrane Contactors are widely used in the semiconductor, power, pharmaceutical and other industries to control dissolved gasses in water systems. Their use in <b>boiler</b> <b>feed</b> <b>water</b> degasification systems has grown steadily since the development of new industrial grade devices. Membrane Contactors are constructed using microporous hydrophobic membranes. The membrane is used to bring a gas and liquid in direct contact without mixing.

A failure investigation of a welded waste heat boiler steel shell that developed transverse cracks {{was carried out in}} 1996 {{to determine the}} cause of failure as well as propose measures to be adopted to prevent similar failures occurring in the future. The boiler had been in service for several years before two cracks across two traversing circumferential welds were discovered on the underside during routine inspection. Chemical and metallographic analyses indicated that the boiler plate was made from a conventional C-Mn steel and that it was certainly suitable forthe purpose. The boiler interior showed massive deposition of a calcareous sludge on the walls and tube bundles.

The best candidates in each category were connected by a circulating heat medium loop where waste heat is recovered for useful purposes. The heat medium chosen is turbine fuel.
