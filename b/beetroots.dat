5|$|Although in the English {{language}} borscht refers {{almost invariably}} to a beet-based soup, in some culinary cultures there exist soups {{with the same}} or similar names where <b>beetroots</b> are absent or merely optional. The principal common trait among them is a tart flavor obtained by adding various sour-tasting ingredients.|$|E
5|$|In Eastern European Ashkenazi Jewish tradition, {{vegetarian}} borscht {{served with}} sour cream and boiled potatoes on the side, known as , is considered an essential dish during the Passover period. As the holiday is observed in spring (March or April), the preparation of Passover borscht used to {{provide an opportunity to}} use up the beet sour left over from pickled <b>beetroots</b> that had been consumed during winter, remaining potatoes that had been stored throughout the winter and sour cream that was readily available in the new calving season. Cold borscht blended {{with sour cream}} is also popular on Shavuot (Feast of Weeks), a holiday customarily associated with dairy foods, observed in late May or early June. Seudah Shlishit, or the third meal of the Shabbat, often includes borscht as well.|$|E
5|$|The soup {{has even}} {{played a role}} in the Soviet space program. In March 1961, as part of a {{communications}} equipment test, a pre-recorded recipe for borscht was broadcast from the Korabl-Sputnik 4 spacecraft. The craft, carrying animals and a mannequin, had been launched into low Earth orbit in preparation for manned space flights. Actual borscht eventually made its way into outer space as space food for Soviet and, later, Russian cosmonauts. Originally, a puréed version of borscht was supplied in tubes. All ingredients for the space borscht (which include beef, <b>beetroots,</b> cabbage, potatoes, carrots, onions, parsley root and tomato paste) were cooked separately, then combined one by one in strictly controlled order, sterilized, packed into tubes, sealed airtight and autoclaved. In the 1970s, the tubes were replaced with packages of rehydratable freeze-dried borscht with regular-size bits of cooked vegetables.|$|E

5|$|As {{the home}} country of {{beetroot}} borscht, Ukraine boasts great {{diversity of the}} soup's regional variants, with virtually every province having its own recipe. Differences between particular varieties may regard the type of stock used (meat, bone, or both), the kind of meat (beef, pork, poultry, etc.), the choice of vegetables and the method of cutting and cooking them. For example, although the typical recipe calls for beef and pork, the Kiev variant uses mutton or lamb as well as beef, while in the Poltava region, the stock for borscht is cooked on poultry meat, that is, chicken, duck or goose. The use of zucchini, beans and apples is characteristic of the Chernihiv borscht; in this variant, <b>beetroots</b> are sautéed in vegetable oil rather than lard, and the sour taste comes solely from tomatoes and tart apples. The Lviv borscht is based on bone stock and is served with chunks of Vienna sausages.|$|E
25|$|The {{pigments}} {{are contained}} in cell vacuoles. Beetroot cells are quite unstable and will 'leak' when cut, heated, or when in contact with air or sunlight. This is why red <b>beetroots</b> leave a purple stain. Leaving the skin on when cooking, however, will maintain {{the integrity of the}} cells and therefore minimize leakage.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{oxidative}} {{and physical}} {{stability of the}} reformulated mayonnaise with processed <b>beetroot</b> was investigated and compared with a control (mayonnaise without <b>beetroot)</b> and a commercially available product. Processing of <b>beetroot</b> {{had an impact on}} the structural integrity of the antioxidants present. Microwaving (960 W for 7 min) was advantageous for preserving the betalain and polyphenol content of <b>beetroot</b> compared to roasting (180 °C for 90 min) and boiling (100 °C for 30 min). The oxidative stability of mayonnaise samples was determined by Rancimat and the thiobarbituric (TBA) assay. The addition of microwaved <b>beetroot</b> significantly enhanced the oxidative stability of mayonnaise at the end of a storage period of 4 weeks (4 °C). Although no significant differences (p> 0. 05) were detected between the mayonnaise samples containing <b>beetroot</b> and the commercial control, the latter was less susceptible to oxidation during storage. The turbiscan stability index (TSI) revealed that the commercial mayonnaise was less prone to destabilization phenomena. All the textural parameters increased with the incorporation of <b>beetroot.</b> The sensory evaluation revealed that, with the exception of graininess and uniformity, most of the sensory attributes are preserved if not improved with the addition of <b>beetroot...</b>|$|R

Five different jams were produced: pear jam, pear with <b>beetroot,</b> apple, apple with <b>beetroot</b> and finally apple with <b>beetroot</b> and cinnamon. The preparation of the products involved several trials until the optimum recipe was found.

Two separate 37 randomly controlled, single blind, cross-over, postprandial studies were performed in 38 normotensive volunteers. Ambulatory blood pressure was measured over a 24 h period 39 following consumption of either four doses of <b>beetroot</b> juice (BJ) 0 g, 100 g, 250 g and 500 g 40 (n = 18) or three bread products, control bread (0 g <b>beetroot),</b> red <b>beetroot</b> and white <b>beetroot</b> 41 enriched breads (n = 14). Total urinary nitrate/nitrite (NOx) was measured at baseline, 2, 4 42 and 24 h post ingestion.

Furthermore, bread products enriched with 100 g red or white <b>beetroot</b> lowered 45 systolic and diastolic BP over a period of 24 h (red <b>beetroot</b> enriched bread, P < 0. 05), with no 46 statistical differences between varieties.

25|$|Usually {{the deep}} purple roots of {{beetroot}} are eaten boiled, roasted or raw, and either alone or combined with any salad vegetable. A {{large proportion of}} the commercial production is processed into boiled and sterilized beets or into pickles. In Eastern Europe, beet soup, such as borscht, is a popular dish.

25|$|Modern sugar beets {{date back}} to mid-18th century Silesia where the king of Prussia subsidised {{experiments}} aimed at processes for sugar extraction. In 1747 Andreas Marggraf isolated sugar from <b>beetroots</b> and found them at concentrations of 1.3-1.6%. He also demonstrated that sugar could be extracted from beets {{that was the same}} as that produced from sugarcane. His student, Franz Karl Achard, evaluated 23 varieties of mangelwurzel for sugar content and selected a local race from Halberstadt in modern-day Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. Moritz Baron von Koppy and his son further selected from this race for white, conical tubers. The selection was named 'Weiße Schlesische Zuckerrübe', meaning white Silesian sugar beet, and boasted about a 6% sugar content. This selection is the progenitor of all modern sugar beets.|$|E

40|$|Athletes use {{nutritional}} supplementation {{to enhance}} the effects of training and achieve improvements in their athletic performance. <b>Beetroot</b> juice increases levels of nitric oxide (NO), which serves multiple functions related to increased blood flow, gas exchange, mitochondrial biogenesis and efficiency, and strengthening of muscle contraction. These biomarker improvements indicate that supplementation with <b>beetroot</b> juice could have ergogenic effects on cardiorespiratory endurance that would benefit athletic performance. The aim of this literature review {{was to determine the}} effects of <b>beetroot</b> juice supplementation and the combination of <b>beetroot</b> juice with other supplements on cardiorespiratory endurance in athletes. A keyword search of DialNet, MedLine, PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science databases covered publications from 2010 to 2016. After excluding reviews/meta-analyses, animal studies, inaccessible full-text, and studies that did not supplement with <b>beetroot</b> juice and adequately assess cardiorespiratory endurance, 23 articles were selected for analysis. The available results suggest that supplementation with <b>beetroot</b> juice can improve cardiorespiratory endurance in athletes by increasing efficiency, which improves performance at various distances, increases time to exhaustion at submaximal intensities, and may improve the cardiorespiratory performance at anaerobic threshold intensities and maximum oxygen uptake (VO 2 max). Although the literature shows contradictory data, the findings of other studies lead us to hypothesize that supplementing with <b>beetroot</b> juice could mitigate the ergolytic effects of hypoxia on cardiorespiratory endurance in athletes. It cannot be stated that the combination of <b>beetroot</b> juice with other supplements has a positive or negative effect on cardiorespiratory endurance, but it is possible that the effects of supplementation with <b>beetroot</b> juice can be undermined by interaction with other supplements such as caffeine...|$|R

500|$|Beet (...) , a plant {{native to}} the Mediterranean Basin, was already grown in antiquity. Only the leaves were of culinary use, as the tapered, tough, whitish and bitter-tasting root was {{considered}} unfit for human consumption. It is likely that beet greens were used in variants of green borscht long before {{the invention of the}} beetroot-based red borscht. Beet varieties with round, red, sweet taproots, known as <b>beetroots,</b> were not reliably reported until the 12th century and did not spread to Eastern Europe before the 16th century. , a Polish Renaissance poet and moralist, included the earliest known Polish recipe for pickled <b>beetroots</b> in his 1568 book, Life of an Honest Man.

500|$|The {{dominant}} tastes in borscht are {{sweet and}} sour. This combination is traditionally obtained by adding beet sour. It {{is made by}} covering sliced <b>beetroots</b> with lukewarm preboiled water and allowing bacteria to ferment some of the sugars present in <b>beetroots</b> into dextran (which gives the liquid a slightly viscous consistency), mannitol, acetic acid and lactic acid. Stale rye bread is often added to hasten the process, but usually omitted in Jewish recipes, as chametz (leavened bread) would make the sour unfit for Passover meals. Sugar, salt and lemon juice may be also added to balance the flavor. After about 2–5 days (or 2–3 weeks without the bread), the deep red, sweet and sour liquid may be strained and is ready to use. It is added to borscht shortly before the soup is done, as prolonged boiling would cause the tart flavor to dissipate. The beet sour is known in Slavic languages as kvas (literally 'sour, acid'; compare kvass) and in Yiddish as [...] (from a Slavic word originally referring to any brine obtained by steeping salted meat or vegetables in water; compare Russian [...] 'pickle juice', Polish [...] 'broth'). Apart from its employment in borscht, it may be also added to prepared horseradish or used as pot roast marinade.|$|E

500|$|The {{vegetables}} {{most commonly}} added to borscht are <b>beetroots,</b> white cabbage, carrots, parsley root, potatoes, onions and tomatoes. Some recipes may also call for beans, tart apples, turnip, celeriac, zucchini or bell peppers. Parsnip {{may be used}} as a substitute for parsley root, and tomato paste is often used as well as or instead of fresh tomatoes. The traditional technique of preparing the soup is to precook the vegetables – by sautéing, braising, boiling or baking – separately from the meat and only then to combine them with the stock. This distinctive feature of borscht derives from the practice of slow cooking in the Russian oven (traditional masonry stove, used for both cooking and heating), wherein the differences in cooking times of individual ingredients had {{to be taken into account}} in order to ensure that all components reach doneness at the same time. The importance of this method is reflected in the Russian language, where a variant in which all vegetables are added raw directly into the stock is referred to by the diminutive form [...] rather than [...] Vegetables are usually julienned, except for potatoes and zucchini, which are diced. The <b>beetroots</b> may be partially baked before being sprinkled with vinegar or lemon juice to preserve the color and braised separately from other vegetables. Onions, carrots, parsley root, turnip and other root vegetables are sautéed (traditionally in animal fat, especially lard or butter) and then mixed with tomatoes or tomato paste. Dry beans are boiled separately. Potatoes and cabbage are boiled in the stock for about 15 minutes before the precooked vegetables are added.|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>Beetroot</b> (Beta vulgaris L.) is a dietary {{source of}} natural {{antioxidants}} and inorganic nitrate (NO 3 –).
