500|$|In Australia, EMI {{released}} the album on 10 September 2010. A special edition {{was released on}} 18 October 2010, featuring a second disc of acoustic versions of each track on the album. Moa said that [...] "I've chosen to record an acoustic version of the album <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> the vulnerable, simplistic side of music and writing. The way you connect the songs {{the first time you}} hear it, no drums, no effects, no funky bass lines, just your voice and a guitar... it feels like magic." ...|$|E
2500|$|Harman is a {{committed}} feminist, having said, [...] "I {{am in the}} Labour Party because I am a feminist. I am in the Labour Party <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> equality." [...] Critics of her positions have responded by nicknaming her [...] "Harriet Harperson".|$|E
2500|$|Johnson {{reflected}} on {{his contributions to}} the Mayo Clinic in 1991: [...] "I’ve {{made a commitment to}} this research center <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> the importance of medical research; I believe in the power of science to help relieve human suffering; and I believe in putting able, curious minds to work for the betterment of mankind." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The silver is mine; {{my father}} gave it me. It {{looked as if}} my brother would prosper without his help, and I think he loved me best. Perhaps this was <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>in</b> the vein." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{was never}} bitter <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>in</b> the man upstairs. I {{continue}} to do my best. I let someone else be bitter. If I was bitter, I was only hurting me. I prefer to remember Bill Veeck and Jim Hegan and Joe Gordon, the good guys. There {{is no point in}} talking about the others." [...] —Larry Doby ...|$|R

2500|$|Senna was {{a devout}} Catholic, once saying: [...] "Just <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> God, just because I {{have faith in}} God, it doesn't mean that I'm immune. It doesn't mean that I'm immortal" [...] (1989). He often read the Bible on long flights from São Paulo to Europe. According to sister Viviane, Senna had sought {{strength}} from the Bible {{on the morning of}} his death after the events of the race weekend: [...] "On that final morning, he woke and opened his Bible and read a text that he would receive the greatest gift of all, which was God himself." ...|$|E
2500|$|On February 8, 2004, at the Grammy Awards {{held at the}} Staples Center in Los Angeles, Vandross {{appeared}} in a pre-taped video segment to accept his Song of the Year Award for [...] "Dance with My Father". In addition to thanking his fans for their support throughout his illness and recovery, he said, [...] "When I say goodbye it's never for long, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> the power of love" [...] (Vandross sang the last six words). His mother, Mary (1922–2008), accepted the award in person on his behalf. Following a May 6, 2004 appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show, he was never seen in public again. Vandross died on July 1, 2005, at the JFK Medical Center in Edison, New Jersey, {{at the age of}} 54.|$|E
2500|$|Gilmour {{has stated}} in {{interviews}} {{that he does}} not believe in an afterlife and that he is an atheist. When it comes to Gilmour's political views, he has stated that he is left-wing, and that his beliefs spring from those of his parents; he stated that his parents were [...] "Proper Manchester Guardian readers", and {{went on to say that}} [...] "Some of their friends went on the Aldermaston Marches. Mine never did to my knowledge, but they were both committed to voting for the Labour Party"; Gilmour inherited his parents' socialism, stating [...] "I still consider myself to be more a socialist than anything else, even if I can't quite stick with party politics". In August 2014, Gilmour was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to The Guardian opposing Scottish independence in the run-up to September's referendum on that issue. In May 2017, Gilmour endorsed Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn in the 2017 UK general election. He tweeted: [...] "I'm voting Labour <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> social equality." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rubin had {{difficulty}} attracting investors early on, and Android was facing eviction from its office space. Steve Perlman, {{a close friend}} of Rubin, brought him $10,000 in cash in an envelope, and shortly thereafter wired an undisclosed amount as seed funding. Perlman refused a stake in the company, and has stated [...] "I did it <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>in</b> the thing, and I wanted to help Andy." ...|$|R
5000|$|Rudi did {{the suit}} {{as a social}} statement. It was an exaggeration {{that had to do}} with setting women free. It had nothing to do with display, and the minute someone wears it to show off her body, you've negated the entire {{principle}} of the thing. I modeled it for a photograph, which was eventually published around the world, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>in</b> the social statement. Also, because the three of us—Rudi, Bill, and I—felt that the photograph presented the statement accurately.|$|R
5000|$|Jupitus toured colleges, {{universities}} and student unions, supporting bands such as Billy Bragg, the Style Council and The Housemartins. He supported Billy Bragg once {{more on the}} Labour Party-sponsored Red Wedge tour in 1985: [...] "In the early '80s, I got involved with Red Wedge, in which Neil Kinnock got various bands to stage concerts for Labour. The reason I got involved was 20% <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>in</b> the cause, 30% <b>because</b> <b>I</b> loved Billy Bragg, and 50% <b>because</b> <b>I</b> wanted to meet Paul Weller".|$|R
2500|$|Axelrod {{was born}} on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, New York City, {{and grew up in}} its Stuyvesant Town area. He was raised in a liberal Jewish family. His mother, Myril Bennett (née Davidson), was a {{journalist}} at PM, a liberal-leaning 1940s newspaper, and later an advertising executive at Young & Rubicam. [...] His father, Joseph Axelrod, was a psychologist and avid baseball fan, who migrated from Eastern Europe to the United States at the age of eleven. He attended Public School 40 in Manhattan. Axelrod's parents separated when he was eight years old. Axelrod traces his political involvement back to his childhood. Describing the appeal of politics, he told the Los Angeles Times, [...] "I got into politics <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> idealism. Just {{to be a part of}} this effort that seems to be rekindling the kind of idealism that I knew when I was a kid, it's a great thing to do. So I find myself getting very emotional about it." [...] At thirteen years old, he was selling campaign buttons for Robert F. Kennedy. After graduating from New York's Stuyvesant High School in 1972, Axelrod attended the University of Chicago, where he majored in Political Science.|$|E

6000|$|... "I did my best, {{honestly}} did my best, {{to profit}} by the suggestions that were offered to me--not <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>in</b> {{the wisdom of}} my friends, but <b>because</b> <b>I</b> dreaded the effect of self-imposed solitude on my nature. Since the fatal day when I had opened the sealed packet, I was on my guard against the inherited evil lying dormant, for all I knew to the contrary, in my father's son. Impelled by that horrid dread, I suffered my daily martyrdom with a courage that astonishes me when I think of it now.|$|R
6000|$|... "I heard you. You {{should have}} spoken for yourself. I came, as you know, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> {{opposing}} force by force. At the next peace meeting we hold I shall make that plainer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{oppose the}} scheme you speak of," [...] he answered, [...] "simply <b>because</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> it. Every {{man has a}} right to his opinion. <b>I</b> don't <b>believe</b> for a moment that it would improve the present {{condition}} of things." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm an old woman, and I {{lived with}} my son, but my son has quit me to starve, for all he cares, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> the God of Jacob and he {{believes}} in this snorting, two-legged horse." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Madam," [...] he said, {{bowing to}} Mrs. Delaporte, [...] "Mr. Cheape and Captain Bannister, I have {{suggested}} this conference <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> settling these affairs myself and not leaving everything to lawyers--no disrespect to present company. I {{have made an}} idiot of myself and I am ready to pay-- a certain amount." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "The {{players have}} been {{absolutely}} amazing. I've told them that I can't thank them enough for their loyalty, character and commitment. They have thrown away {{a lot of money}} in signing these revisedcontracts... I'm embarrassed <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>in</b> Keith Ryder and <b>believed</b> <b>in</b> what he was doing. To find out that the players could have walked away for nothing after all the work we had done in pre-season was unbelievable. I hope the football club has hit rock-bottom and we can start to climb again, but I can't guarantee that." [...] Manager Micky Adams had hoped to build a strong squad to challenge for promotion, but as Ryder's takeover seemed less probable, so did Vale's chances of promotion.|$|R
5000|$|Former NEMSA {{employees}} {{have also been}} critical of NEMSA. Former NEMSA Employee Jim Misercola wrote a letter describing why he no longer works for NEMSA in which he states [...] "My resignation {{is due to the}} extreme philosophical and ideological differences with NEMSA. NEMSA is no longer the organization that I once tirelessly promoted. Furthermore it is my opinion that NEMSA is badly mismanaged by its current President Torren Colcord". [...] Former Co-Founder Tim Bonifay also stated in a letter [...] "I helped create NEMSA <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>in</b> what the organization could achieve. But the NEMSA out campaigning today is not the one that I co-founded, and I would be ashamed {{to be a part of}} that organization today." ...|$|R

I'm going ahead <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> meself. I've no use for sentiment {{and that sort of}} thing. Forty of your Jackmans aren't worth me little finger.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{concerned}} in you!" [...] I answered passionately. [...] "Felicia, you drive me almost wild {{when you talk}} like this. You {{know very well that}} it is not curiosity which has made me set my teeth, and swear that I will discover the truth of these things. It is because I see you implicated in them, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> you, Felicia, because I love you!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{know how}} it was when you went away from Florence. Do you think {{differently}} now? I don't.

6000|$|An {{author who}} {{had much to}} do with {{preparing}} me for the quixotic folly in point was that Thomas Babington Macaulay, who taught simplicity of diction in phrases of as [...] "learned length and thundering sound," [...] as any he would have had me shun, and who deplored the Latinistic English of Johnson in terms emulous of the great doctor's orotundity and ronderosity. I wonder now that I did not see how my physician avoided his medicine, but I did not, and I went on to spend myself in an endeavor as vain and senseless as any that pedantry has conceived. It was none the less absurd <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>in</b> it so devoutly, and sacrificed myself to it with such infinite pains and labor. But this was long after I read Macaulay, who was one of my grand passions before Dickens or Chaucer.|$|R

60|$|<b>Because</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> a God of {{absolute}} and unbounded love, therefore I {{believe in a}} loving anger of His, which will and must devour and destroy all which is decayed, monstrous, abortive, in His universe, till all enemies shall be put under His feet, to be pardoned surely, if they confess themselves in the wrong and open their eyes to the truth. And God shall be All in All. Those last are wide words.|$|E
6000|$|... "I accept you upon trust," [...] the Duke said, [...] "for {{the sake}} of my friend Andrew. I know that he lives out of the world, and has not much {{experience}} in judging others, but I do believe that when he has {{made up his mind}} about anybody, he is generally right. Frankly, from what I have heard, and a little that I know, I am afraid that I should have been suspicious about even a child like you, because of your associates. But <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> you, I am all the more sure that very soon you are going to find yourself in trouble. It is agreed, remember, that when that time comes you will remember that I am your friend." ...|$|E
60|$|And I take up this {{position}} <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> {{the family as}} the justification of marriage. Marriage to me is no mystical and eternal union, but a practical affair, to be judged as all practical things are judged--by its returns in happiness and human welfare. And directly we pass from the mists and glamours of amorous passion to the warm realities of the nursery, we pass into {{a new system of}} considerations altogether. We are no longer considering A. in relation to Mrs. A., but A. and Mrs. A. in relation to an indefinite number of little A.'s, who are the very life of the State in which they live. Into the case of Mr. A. v. Mrs. A. come Master A. and Miss A. intervening. They have the strongest claim against both their parents for love, shelter and upbringing, and the legislator and statesman, concerned as he is chiefly with the future of the community, has the strongest reasons for seeing that they get these things, even at the price of considerable vexation, boredom or indignity to Mr. and Mrs. A. And here it is that there arises the rational case against free and frequent divorce and the general unsettlement and fluctuation of homes that would ensue.|$|E

5000|$|During {{his time}} at Leicester, Smith was known to take many young up and coming players under his wing and tutor them, the most notable of these was Don Revie, Smith said of Revie [...] "I could see he had {{potential}} when he came down for a trial and I used to coach him lots with the ball. I'd say come on with me, and we'd go into a corner and I'd teach him things. He was an eager young player but I used to make him cry when I told him he did things wrong. He told me he would go home after the match and start to cry. I was pushing him <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>in</b> him. When he used to cry, I told him he should do things right.

And I would teach him how to trap it.|$|R
