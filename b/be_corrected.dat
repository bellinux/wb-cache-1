5|$|Almost all the {{necessary}} corrections of misspellings have been made. Sometimes a stroke of the pen indicates an error, perhaps to <b>be</b> <b>corrected</b> later. Some corrections seem to be written by prima manu (e.g. Matthew 4:10; 5:19) others plainly secondary manu (Matthew 6; Luke 3; 10:35). The apostrophe is used even when not required, especially in εξ', and ουκ'.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the book's publication, responses to the tale were published by W. M. Swepstone (Christmas Shadows, 1850), Horatio Alger (Job Warner's Christmas, 1863), Louisa May Alcott (A Christmas Dream, and How It Came True, 1882), and others who followed Scrooge's life as a reformed man– or some who thought Dickens had got it wrong and needed to <b>be</b> <b>corrected.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{number of}} ready-use rounds is {{insufficient}} and the hoists are desperately slow. The 47mm guns, {{much more so}} than the large and medium-calibre guns, will have to fight at night; yet these are the only guns without a fire-control system designed for night operations. This is a deficiency which needs to <b>be</b> <b>corrected</b> as soon as possible.|$|E
5|$|The reason I haven't {{spoken to}} you before now is this: You deserve the truth. And as {{frustrating}} as the waiting has been, I felt it was improper {{to come to you}} with sketchy reports, or possibly even erroneous statements, which would then have to <b>be</b> <b>corrected,</b> creating even more doubt and confusion. There's been enough of that.|$|E
5|$|Although the MSS was {{the most}} useful {{instrument}} on Landsat 2, sometimes the data recorded was anomalous. The U.S. Geological Service (USGS) would identify these anomalies and document them. Known issues on the MSS are: banding, coherent noise, data loss, impulse noise, oversaturation, scan correlated shift (SCS), scan mirror pulse, and transmission striping. Transmission striping occurred when data from an individual sensor was lost. Most commonly, multiple data losses occurred simultaneously, resulting in an image with colored bands on it. This form of data anomaly could not <b>be</b> <b>corrected</b> in post processing.|$|E

In benign lymph nodes (n[*]=[*] 61) only, the small-voxel score <b>was</b> <b>correct</b> in 45 cases (74 %) vs. 54 correct scores (89 %) on standard-voxel images (p[*]=[*] 0.04).|$|R
5|$|At {{the ends}} of the linear {{chromosomes}} are specialized regions of DNA called telomeres. The main function of these regions is to allow the cell to replicate chromosome ends using the enzyme telomerase, as the enzymes that normally replicate DNA cannot copy the extreme 3′ ends of chromosomes. These specialized chromosome caps also help protect the DNA ends, and stop the DNA repair systems in the cell from treating them as damage to <b>be</b> <b>corrected.</b> In human cells, telomeres are usually lengths of single-stranded DNA containing several thousand repeats of a simple TTAGGG sequence.|$|E
5|$|Christian Science {{is a set}} {{of beliefs}} and {{practices}} belonging to the metaphysical family of new religious movements. It was developed in 19th-century New England by Mary Baker Eddy, who argued in her book Science and Health (1875) that sickness is an illusion that can <b>be</b> <b>corrected</b> by prayer alone. The book became Christian Science's central text, along with the Bible, and by 2001 had sold over nine million copies.|$|E
5|$|The National Rail Administration {{has stated}} {{that they may have}} to close Innherred Sykehus Station. The station is located in a curve and within the {{signaling}} area of Levanger Station, and the Norwegian Railway Inspectorate has required the station to <b>be</b> <b>corrected</b> by 2012. Because of the adjacent Levanger Hospital, the station is one of the busiest on the system, with 90,000 annual riders. One possible solution is to move the platforms of Levanger Station closer towards the hospital and thus serve both the town and the hospital from the same station.|$|E

5|$|The {{spacecraft}} for the AS-202 and AS-204 missions {{were delivered}} by North American Aviation to the Kennedy Space Center with long lists of equipment problems {{which had to}} <b>be</b> <b>corrected</b> before flight; these delays caused the launch of AS-202 to slip behind AS-203, and eliminated hopes the first manned mission might be ready to launch as soon as November 1966, concurrently with the last Gemini mission. Eventually the planned AS-204 flight date was pushed to February 21, 1967.|$|E
5|$|By January 2011, {{much of the}} nation's {{attention}} {{had shifted}} from the Gascoyne flood to the devastating floods in Queensland. Many residents struggling to get their lives back together were frustrated {{with the government and}} demanded aid. Though people affected by the floods were to be given A$15,000 in funds, they expressed further anger after hearing that residents in Queensland would receive A$25,000. On 11 January, Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated that the imbalance in funds was to <b>be</b> <b>corrected</b> and residents of Western Australia would receive equal amounts to those in Queensland. By 20 January, donations for flood victims from the Lord Mayor's Distress Relief Fund exceeded A$1million. Power restoration, especially in Gascoyne Junction, was unusually sluggish. Dozens of residents were without power for eight weeks, as electricity was finally restored between 12 and 13 February. This coincided with the arrival of replacement furniture from Paraburdoo; however, heavy rains renewed flooding and prevented most residents from picking up the supplies.|$|E
5|$|Congestion pricing is {{a concept}} from market {{economics}} {{regarding the use of}} pricing mechanisms to charge the users of public goods for the negative externalities generated by the peak demand in excess of available supply. Its economic rationale is that, at a price of zero, demand exceeds supply, causing a shortage, and that the shortage should <b>be</b> <b>corrected</b> by charging the equilibrium price rather than shifting it down by increasing the supply. Usually this means increasing prices during certain periods of time or at the places where congestion occurs; or introducing a new usage tax or charge when peak demand exceeds available supply {{in the case of a}} tax-funded public good provided free at the point of usage.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{its status}} an {{international}} language, English is expeditious {{when it comes}} adopting foreign words, and borrows vocabulary from {{a large number of}} other sources. Early studies of English vocabulary by lexicographers, the scholars who formally study vocabulary, compile dictionaries, or both, were impeded by a lack of comprehensive data on actual vocabulary in use from good-quality linguistic corpora, collections of actual written texts and spoken passages. Many statements published {{before the end of the}} 20th century about the growth of English vocabulary over time, the dates of first use of various words in English, and the sources of English vocabulary will have to <b>be</b> <b>corrected</b> as new computerised analysis of linguistic corpus data becomes available.|$|E
5|$|Hamming {{set himself}} {{the task of}} solving this problem, which he {{realised}} would have an enormous range of applications. Each bit can only be a zero or a one, so if you know which bit is wrong, then it can <b>be</b> <b>corrected.</b> In a landmark paper published in 1950, he introduced a concept {{of the number of}} positions in which two code words differ, and therefore how many changes are required to transform one code word into another, which is today known as the Hamming distance. Hamming thereby created a family of mathematical error-correcting code, which are called Hamming codes. This not only solved an important problem in telecommunications and computer science, it opened up a whole new field of study.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, leaks in {{the mall}} roof and mold caused Elliot Lake city councilors to {{consider}} moving the Elliot Lake Public Library out of the mall {{and back to the}} Solomon Building, where it had been before 1992. Many books were damaged, despite library staff using tarps to cover shelves. At some points, entire sections were blocked for public health reasons. Much of the leaking was said to <b>be</b> <b>corrected,</b> before council considered the issue, and an environmental study was completed. Some library board members and councilors worried that liability insurance wouldn't cover them {{in the mall}}, despite reassurances by library management and the city's insurance broker. With a multi-use complex in the works, some of the library board was concerned with a five-year lease that mall management was pursuing, despite the library's preference for a 2.5-year lease. In the end, the library remained at the mall.|$|E

5|$|Johnson's work on The Plays of William Shakespeare took {{up most of}} his time. On 8 June 1756, Johnson {{published}} his Proposals for Printing, by Subscription, the Dramatick Works of William Shakespeare, which argued that previous editions of Shakespeare were edited incorrectly and needed to <b>be</b> <b>corrected.</b> Johnson's progress on the work slowed as the months passed, and he told music historian Charles Burney in December 1757 {{that it would take}} him until the following March to complete it. Before that could happen, he was arrested again, for a debt of £40, in February 1758. The debt was soon repaid by Jacob Tonson, who had contracted Johnson to publish Shakespeare, and this encouraged Johnson to finish his edition to repay the favour. Although it took him another seven years to finish, Johnson completed a few volumes of his Shakespeare to prove his commitment to the project.|$|E
5|$|On 21 December 1979, the Director of National Mapping of Malaysia {{published}} a map entitled Territorial Waters and Continental Shelf Boundaries of Malaysia showing Pedra Branca {{to be within}} its territorial waters. Singapore rejected this claim in a diplomatic note of 14 February 1980 and asked for the map to <b>be</b> <b>corrected.</b> The dispute was not resolved by an exchange of correspondence and intergovernmental talks in 1993 and 1994. In {{the first round of}} talks in February 1993 the issue of sovereignty over Middle Rocks and South Ledge was also raised. Malaysia and Singapore therefore agreed to submit the dispute to the International Court of Justice (ICJ), signing a Special Agreement for this purpose in February 2003 and notifying the Court of it in July 2003. The case was heard at the Peace Palace in The Hague between 6 and 23 November 2007.|$|E
5|$|Avery Brundage, as {{president}} of the IOC from 1952 to 1972, rejected all attempts to link the Olympics with commercial interests as he felt that the Olympic movement should be completely separate from financial influence. The 1960 Winter Olympics marked the beginning of corporate sponsorship of the Games. Despite Brundage's strenuous resistance the commercialisation of the Games continued during the 1960s, and revenue generated by corporate sponsorship swelled the IOC's coffers. By the Grenoble Games, Brundage had become so concerned about the direction of the Winter Olympic Games towards commercialisation that, if it could not <b>be</b> <b>corrected,</b> he felt the Winter Olympics should be abolished. Brundage's resistance to this revenue stream meant that the IOC was unable to gain a share of the financial windfall that was coming to host cities, and had no control over the structuring of sponsorship deals. When Brundage retired the IOC had $2million in assets; eight years later its accounts had swelled to $45million. This was due to a shift in ideology among IOC members, towards expansion of the Games through corporate sponsorship and the sale of television rights.|$|E
