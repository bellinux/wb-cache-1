5|$|In all, Hurricane John {{destroyed}} {{hundreds of}} houses and <b>blew</b> <b>off</b> {{the roofs of}} 160houses on the Baja California peninsula. Five people were killed, and damage in Mexico amounted to $663million (2006MXN, $60.8million 2006USD).|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere, {{the storm}} damaged trees and <b>blew</b> <b>off</b> rooftops in Pontagea, a highly {{populated}} suburb {{in the port}} city of Beira. Cyclone Favio was responsible for widespread damage in Tofo Beach, where the storm uprooted palm trees and destroyed electric services. Elsewhere, an airplane was crushed in an airport.|$|E
5|$|After {{the appeals}} had been exhausted, Illinois Governor Richard James Oglesby {{commuted}} Fielden's and Schwab's sentences {{to life in}} prison on November 10, 1887. On the eve of his scheduled execution, Lingg committed suicide in his cell with a smuggled blasting cap which he reportedly held in his mouth like a cigar (the blast <b>blew</b> <b>off</b> half his face and he survived in agony for six hours).|$|E

50|$|High winds toppled many {{trees in}} north west Germany, with the strongest wind field {{impacting}} the East Frisian islands and Heligoland. Storm damages occurred principally across {{the states of}} Lower Saxony, Bremen, Hamburg and Schleswig Holstein, with lesser damages reported in North Rhine-Westphalia and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.On the East Frisian island of Nordeney footage of a roof being <b>blown</b> <b>off</b> in the high winds was captured.

5|$|Alternative {{theories}} were advanced. Some {{surmised that}} the money had been found at a distant location by someone (or possibly even a wild animal), carried to the river bank, and reburied there. The sheriff of Cowlitz County proposed that Cooper accidentally dropped a few bundles on the airstair, which then <b>blew</b> <b>off</b> the aircraft and fell into the Columbia River. One local newspaper editor theorized that Cooper, knowing he could never spend the money, dumped it in the river, or buried portions of it at Tina Bar (and possibly elsewhere) himself. No hypothesis offered to date satisfactorily explains all of the existing evidence.|$|E
5|$|The first {{prototype}} {{was lost}} in a crash at NAS China Lake on 13 October 1944. Investigation showed that the wing structure was {{not strong enough to}} resist compressibility effects. This was cured by doubling the number of rivets in the outer wing panels. The second prototype crashed on 25 March 1945 when the pilot failed to recover from a dive from , probably also due to compressibility effects. The third prototype crashed on 5 April when the canopy <b>blew</b> <b>off</b> during a high-speed pass over Lindbergh Field.|$|E
5|$|On August 12, 1985, Japan Airlines Flight 123, a Boeing 747-146SR, {{suffered}} a rupture {{of the pressure}} bulkhead in its tail section, caused by undetected damage during a faulty repair to the rear bulkhead after a tailstrike seven years earlier. Pressurized air subsequently rushed out of the bulkhead and <b>blew</b> <b>off</b> the plane's vertical stabilizer, also severing all four of its hydraulic control systems. The pilots were {{able to keep the}} plane airborne for 32 minutes using differential engine power, but without any hydraulics or the stabilizing force of the vertical stabilizer, the plane eventually crashed in mountainous terrain. There were only 4 survivors among the 524 on board. This accident is the deadliest single-aircraft accident in history.|$|E

5|$|Power outages {{began in}} some neighborhoods at 6:30p.m. AST (2230 UTC) August 16, over 12hours {{before the storm}} arrived, and quickly spread over the entire island. The night saw heavy rains, 4cm (1.58inches) at Hewanorra International Airport, and intense {{thunderstorms}} and by morning hurricane-force winds peaked at 80knots (90mph, 145km/h). The winds uprooted trees, downed electricity poles, disabled bridges, triggered landslides, and damaged several roofs. Hurricane Dean tore the corrugated metal roof off Victoria Hospital's pediatric ward, but its patients had already been evacuated. St. Jude Hospital in Vieux Fort was also damaged when part of the roof <b>blew</b> <b>off</b> its medical ward and fell through {{the roof of the}} emergency room. A section of the cafeteria also lost its roof, but no one was injured in either incident.|$|E
5|$|Selected {{as one of}} the Mercury Seven astronauts, Grissom was {{the pilot}} of the second American {{suborbital}} flight, in the Liberty Bell 7. The hatch of the craft <b>blew</b> <b>off</b> and filled with water, causing it to sink {{to the bottom of the}} ocean. His next flight was in the Project Gemini Program in a craft named the Molly Brown, which was a successful mission. He was killed along with fellow astronauts Ed White and Roger Chaffee during a pre-launch test for the Apollo 1 mission at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (then known as Cape Kennedy), Florida. He was the first of the Mercury Seven to die. He was a recipient of the Distinguished Flying Cross and, posthumously, the Congressional Space Medal of Honor.|$|E
5|$|The Admiralty ordered Captain Warburton-Lee {{to attack}} German {{shipping}} in Narvik, Norway on 9 April. The following morning Hardy led four of her half-sisters down Ofotfjord in a surprise dawn attack on Narvik harbour during a blinding snowstorm. A torpedo from Hardy <b>blew</b> <b>off</b> {{the stern of}} the German flagship, , and killed the German flotilla commander, Commodore Friedrich Bonte. Heidkamp sank the next day. Another hit a merchant ship in the stern. A second salvo of four torpedoes was fired at two other German destroyers, but missed and badly damaged the ore docks. After regrouping, Captain Warburton-Lee led another attack on the harbour later that morning, but inflicted little additional damage due to poor visibility.|$|E

5|$|Along the {{northern}} coastline of Venezuela, the hurricane produced heavy precipitation and a storm surge of about 13feet (4m), which damaged 60homes. Sustained winds on Isla Margarita peaked at 26mph (42km/h), {{and the most}} affected states were Falcón, Vargas, Aragua, Carabobo, and Anzoátegui. Rough waves capsized 10boats and closed several beaches, and one person drowned due to the surf. Further inland, two people drowned when a river overflowed its banks, and near Caracas a man died after strong winds toppled a wall. The combination of rainfall and winds destroyed 21houses and <b>blew</b> <b>off</b> the roof of several others, affecting 1,376people, of whom 80 were left homeless. Power outages and lack of water were reported. In the country, the hurricane caused 127injuries, and a death toll reported between three and five. An initial news story reported 28people missing offshore on threeboats.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Carol struck Connecticut {{shortly after}} high tide, and its {{combination}} with 10 to 15feet (3 to 4.5m) storm surges from New London eastward produced widespread tidal flooding. About 2,000people were stranded when a rail line between New Haven and Rhode Island was flooded. The heaviest rainfall {{associated with the}} passage of the storm occurred in New London, where up to 6inches (150mm) fell and wind <b>blew</b> <b>off</b> a portion of the city hall roof. These strong winds left much of the eastern portion of the state without power. Near the coast, the combination of strong winds and the storm surge damaged or destroyed thousands of buildings, including 100destroyed houses. Many other homes in Eastern Connecticut were damaged by falling trees. Thousands had evacuated before the storm reached the area, and one person died in the state. Due to the compact nature of the storm, western Connecticut experienced little effects from Carol. Overall damage in the state was estimated at $50million.|$|E
5|$|Monti {{made three}} {{attempts}} to reach Bradbury. On his first, he advanced to within {{three feet of}} Bradbury before being forced back by intense machine-gun and rocket-propelled grenade (RPG) fire. His second try was similarly turned back and {{as the rest of}} his patrol provided covering fire, Monti advanced a third time but was struck by an RPG. Some news reports indicated that the explosion <b>blew</b> <b>off</b> both of his legs, but this is not supported by family accounts or military records. Monti attempted to crawl back towards cover. He is reported by comrades to have made his peace with God and asked Sgt. Cunningham to tell his parents he loved them. Monti died moments later. At about the same time, the artillery and air support for which he had called began hitting the enemy position, killing 22 of the attackers and dispersing the rest.|$|E

5|$|Six foot (2m) waves {{along the}} {{coastline}} of Saint Mary's County, with Point Lookout State Park suffering $3million in damages (2003USD, ($ USD). In the county, 2,500wharves and piers were destroyed, with another 1,000moderately damaged, resulting in $10.25million in monetary damage (2003USD, ($ USD). The storm surge destroyed {{the bridge to}} Saint George Island by {{a few hours after}} the hurricane made landfall, and the flooding covered much of the island for a week. There, 20homes were destroyed. Shore revetments experienced $53.4million in damage (2003USD, ($ USD). Throughout Saint Mary's County, residential damage amounted to about $17million (2003USD, ($ USD) with about $1.5million to commercial buildings (2003USD, ($ USD). The damage was caused primarily by the storm surge, though the winds produced minor to moderate damage, the worst effects in the state from winds. In the county, the winds <b>blew</b> <b>off</b> the roof of a home and downed 70trees, leaving 27,092 without power.|$|E
5|$|As Charley {{moved across}} eastern North Carolina, {{hurricane}} warnings were extended northward, first to Virginia Beach; they were later extended to Cape Charles, {{then to the}} Maryland/Delaware border, and ultimately {{as far north as}} Sandy Hook, New Jersey. Prior to its arrival, the storm resulted in the closure of Norfolk International Airport, and more than 9,000people evacuated the coastline for emergency shelters. Tropical storm force winds spread across southeastern Virginia, with wind gusts reaching 82mph (133km/h) on Cape Charles. Offshore, a station on the Chesapeake Bay Bridge–Tunnel recorded sustained winds of 97mph (157km/h) with gusts to 104mph (168km/h). After the gust, the bridge-tunnel was closed overnight. The winds downed many trees, and in Norfolk, a motorist died after crashing into a downed tree. In Virginia Beach, the winds <b>blew</b> <b>off</b> the roof of a hotel and destroyed two homes under construction. Across the area, the storm left about 110,000customers without power. Rainfall in Virginia was fairly light, including a 24-hour total of just over 1in (25mm) in Norfolk. Strong waves destroyed 250ft (76m) of Harrison's Pier in Norfolk. A preliminary damage estimate for the area was $1million (1986USD).|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Edouard passed about 95miles (150km/h) {{southeast}} of Nantucket while moving at only 12mph (19km/h), much slower than previous New England hurricanes. This resulted in {{several hours of}} strong waves, winds, and rain. The hurricane produced wave heights of up to 31feet (9.4m), which washed twelve boats ashore and damaged numerous others. The strong waves and a storm surge of up to 2.1feet (.6m) in Nantucket flooded a few coastal roads. Edouard also produced tropical storm force winds across much of Massachusetts, {{as well as one}} hurricane-force gust on Nantucket. In addition, there were unofficial reports of stronger gusts, including 77mph (124km/h) on Cape Cod, 80mph (129km/h) on Martha's Vineyard, and 90mph (145km/h) on Nantucket. The strong winds caused power outages to 2/3 of Nantucket, all of Martha's Vineyard for six hours, and most of Cape Cod for several hours. Power outages, effecting 35,000 to 40,000 were reported throughout Massachusetts, though far from the power outages caused by Hurricane Bob five years prior. The winds also downed numerous trees, and <b>blew</b> <b>off</b> the roof of the fire station in Hyannis. Rainfall was moderate from the slow-moving hurricane, peaking at 6.37inches (162mm) in West Dennis with many other locations reporting over 3inches (76mm). The rainfall produced minor street flooding. Damage on Cape Cod totaled to $3.5million (1996USD, $4.6million 2007USD).|$|E

5|$|The area most {{affected}} by the cyclone was in and around Trincomalee: 57people checked into the local hospital {{as a result of}} falling trees or debris, with one person killed due to a falling tree. An entire fishing village was completely destroyed, and heavy rainfall flooded rivers, lakes, and canals, covering roads and crops with floodwaters. The flooding destroyed about 77squaremiles (200km²) of rice fields, and an additional 19square miles (50km²) of other crops. Strong winds damaged or destroyed around 83,000houses across the country, including 2,000houses destroyed in Kinnia and 6,600 in Trincomalee. The passage of the cyclone left up to 500,000temporarily homeless on the island, most of whom fled to churches, schools, temples, and shopping centers. The winds <b>blew</b> <b>off</b> the roofs of several police stations and military camps, and flooded several refugee camps. The winds damaged electrical systems and disrupted about 3,000telephone systems, and many roads were left impassable. Large areas remained without power for several days. No damage reports exist for regions under control of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, despite the fact the storm made landfall there. Throughout the country, at least nine people {{died as a result of}} the cyclone, and over 48,000families were affected.|$|E
5|$|The {{storm track}} brought Mireille {{west of the}} most {{populated}} island of Honshu, limiting damage there compared to Kyushu. At Misawa Air Base, the strong winds knocked over trees and <b>blew</b> <b>off</b> the roofs of several warehouses, and also knocked off storage sheds off their foundation. Ahead of the storm, advance warning allowed the American military to shelter aircraft and warn the population. Damage was estimated between $500,000$1.5million. Two of Mazda's loading docks in Hiroshima were completely destroyed, affecting American inventories of 1992 Mazda 929's {{until the end of}} November 1991. Also in the city, 1.1million residents, or 80% of households, lost power due to winds and storm surge. In Yamaguchi Prefecture, the Takeda Pharmaceutical Company was flooded with 0.6m (2ft) of waters, forcing workers to move to another plant in the United States. The strong winds and waves damaged the Itsukushima Shrine near Hiroshima and Kenroku-en northwest of Tokyo. In Okayama Prefecture, salt spray damaged railways and shut down lines for three days. High winds in Naka-ku collapsed scaffolding from a parking garage, and another damaged scaffolding nearby forced a road to shut down. There were extensive crop losses in northern Honshu. In Toyama Prefecture, the winds destroyed 192greenhouses and exasperated a fire that caused further crop damage.|$|E
5|$|Upon Nubians {{contact with}} the German 17th Half Flotilla, she made the same error as Flirt and mistook the German boats for Allied vessels. Surprised with a hail of gunfire, Nubian {{attempted}} to ram the last boat in the German line of battle but {{was struck by a}} torpedo that <b>blew</b> <b>off</b> her bow and reduced her to a drifting hulk. Amazon and Cossack soon arrived to aid Nubian and engaged the German boats. The Germans scored several hits on Amazon, knocking out two of her boilers before withdrawing. Vikings division of boats also clashed with Kaiserliche Marine torpedo boats. The German 18th Half Flotilla was heading back to Zeebrugge when it sailed into Oliphant′s group of destroyers, engaging them as they passed. Although Viking escaped unscathed, Mohawk suffered several hits, before the Germans were able to break away to the safety of the coast. Near the end of the action, Admiral Bacon dispatched the Dunkirk Division to intercept the German torpedo boats before they could return to Flanders but the Germans were able to successfully withdraw before being caught by these further reinforcements.|$|E
