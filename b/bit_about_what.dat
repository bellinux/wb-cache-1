As for us clergy, everywhere but in Norfolk Island, we must know that people are thinking of matters which all were content {{a few years ago}} to keep back in silence, and that they expect us to speak about them. How thankful I am that we fortunate ones are exempt from this. Yet in my way I, too, try to think a <b>bit</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> is going on; and I don't want to be too gloomy, or to ignore some good in all this ferment in men's minds. It is better than stagnation and indolent respectability. There is everywhere a consciousness of a vast work to be done, and sincere efforts are made to do it. I suppose that is a fact; many, many poor souls are being taught and trained for heaven through all these various agencies which seem to a distant and idle critic to be so questionable in some ways.|$|E
6000|$|Something {{more than}} usual {{seemed to be on}} foot this year, for the girls were as busy up-stairs as down, so were the boys in school-room and barn, and a general air of bustle pervaded the house. There was a great hunting up of old ribbons and finery, much cutting and pasting of gold paper, and the most {{remarkable}} quantity of straw, gray cotton, flannel, and big black beads, used by Franz and Mrs. Jo. Ned hammered at strange machines in the workshop, Demi and Tommy went about murmuring to themselves as if learning something. A fearful racket was heard in Emil's room at intervals, and peals of laughter from the nursery when Rob and Teddy were sent for and hidden from sight whole hours at a time. But the thing that puzzled Mr. Bhaer the most was what became of Rob's big pumpkin. It had been borne in triumph to the kitchen, where a dozen golden-tinted pies soon after appeared. It would not have taken {{more than a quarter of}} the mammoth vegetable to make them, yet where was the rest? It disappeared, and Rob never seemed to care, only chuckled when it was mentioned, and told his father, [...] "To wait and see," [...] for the fun of the whole thing was to surprise Father Bhaer at the end, and not let him know a <b>bit</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> was to happen.|$|E

Life ain’t happy all the time. For me, spirituality is not about being happy. It's about what to do when times are tough, not just for you {{personally}} but for everybody. There are times when disasters strike ... So, for me, spirituality is what to do about that, and then what to do in your own personal life when you're confronting things that hurt, things that ain't fun. Outlasting the Blues was about that. It was not about preachin', it was not about telling people what's right, although there's a little <b>bit</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> I found was right.|$|E
5000|$|Code {{names were}} {{adopted by the}} {{following}} process. Aerial or space reconnaissance would note a new aircraft at a Warsaw Pact airbase. The intelligence units would then assign it a code name consisting of the official abbreviation of the base, then a letter, for example, [...] "Ram-A", signifying an aircraft sighted at Ramenskoye Airport. Missiles were given designations like [...] "TT-5", for the fifth rocket seen at Tyura-Tam. When more information resulted in knowing a <b>bit</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> a missile was used for, it would be given a designation like [...] "SS-6", for the sixth surface-to-surface missile design reported. Finally, when either an aircraft or a missile {{was able to be}} photographed with a hand-held camera, instead of a reconnaissance aircraft, it was given a name like [...] "Flanker" [...] or [...] "Scud" [...] always an English word, as international pilots worldwide are required to learn English. The Soviet manufacturer or designation - which may be mistakenly inferred by NATO - {{has nothing to do with}} it.|$|E

I'd seen Allen Ginsberg and some other people who liked Dylan and Jesus going on about Hare Krishna. It was Ginsberg, in particular, I was referring to.

5000|$|Lyrically, [...] "Beggin & Pleadin" [...] sees its protagonist {{mourning}} a lost love. Based in a {{real life}} experience and the lesson it taught her, the song was inspired by Norwood's broken engagement to music executive Ryan Press, from whom she separated in early 2014 after a three-year relationship. The dissolution left Norwood exhausted and saddened, but also encouraged her to explore new avenues in her career, including her starring role as Roxie Hart in the Broadway musical Chicago, her new television comedy show Zoe Ever After and the recording of new music. Songwriter Lauryen Kirby crafted the song after Norwood shared the pain of not having truly dealt with the reasons behind the break-up. “I told her my story, just a <b>bit</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> I experienced and how I went through a really tough period, and how I wasn’t able to {{just let it go}} and get over it,” the singer explained to Billboard magazine. Following its release, she also took to Facebook to elaborate on the liberating nature of the song's lyrics: [...] "As I grew through the subject matter of this song, I realized that I needed me to forgive me for not believing what I felt," [...] she wrote.|$|E

And we flashback to an encounter John had with Odin Quincannon when Jesse was just a kid. As Jesse's grown up and come back to this town, Quincannon's been sort of the ultimate white whale of sin. He's a professed atheist; he's also {{the most powerful man in}} town, he basically runs Annville." [...] Catlin concluded his segment of the featurette by speaking of the present timeline with Jesse and Odin, with Catlin saying, [...] "Jesse's trying to coax Odin to come to church, just this one Sunday. For Jesse, he's the ultimate challenge, 'If I can show the town that I can bring Odin Quincannon to God then everyone else will follow'." [...] Catlin continues, [...] "Jesse pros him and asks him 'what about Hell? aren't you worried about going to Hell?' But he turns the tables on Jesse, he's like 'I'm not the one that's worried about Hell, you're the one that's worried about Hell' And that's the turn of the scene." ...|$|E
5000|$|The one-hour show is {{hosted by}} comedian Mo Mandel (from Comedy Central Presents). He travels across the United States and pits two bar owners {{against each other}} {{to see who can}} turn the most profit. But the twist is they have to run each other's bars for a night. How the show works is Mandel {{introduces}} each bar owner. Each owner then gets to talk a little <b>bit</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> their bar offers and how they run things. Then the owners travel to each other's bars to spend a week there and meet the staff. In repeated interviews, the owners talk about how they feel about how the other bar is run and what types of changes they would make if they were the owner. Later on during the week, the owners [...] "take over" [...] the establishment and implement their rules and TV viewers observe how the staff reacts to these changes. Many times, there is friction between the staff and the owners at this stage in the competition. One major stipulation of the show is that the new owner cannot fire any staff members for breaking any of the new rules, but can discipline them in other ways. Finally, there is the [...] "relaunch" [...] night where the owner has complete control of the bar. This is the night that counts towards the profit totals which will determine who wins the competition. The winner receives a $10,000 grand prize.|$|E

In response, King County Sheriff John Urquhart told KIRO-AM in Seattle that he'd {{received a letter from}} an investigator asking for details on the case, but he never disclosed that he was working for the NFL. For that reason, he dismissed the letter as coming from a [...] "yokel." [...] He also claimed that any requests for information on the case would have gone directly to him had the league followed the normal channels, and [...] "we probably would have told them orally a little <b>bit</b> more <b>about</b> <b>what</b> we had" [...] at the time.

Showrunner Sam Catlin was interviewed for the segment, and stated [...] "Cassidy's sort of figured out that DeBlanc and Fiore aren't vampire vigilantes.

50|$|Opinion {{leaders are}} {{the first step in}} the {{elements}} of persuasion. This is most important to the pre-purchase experience when a consumer is most interested in the marketing of the product they are intending to buy. The power of the persuasion that the opinion leader possesses will change depending on many different factors. The first is their credibility, this also works in turn with perceived trustworthiness. Consumers are more likely to believe that the campaign is genuine if the opinion leader is someone who has a reputation for being honest and credible. Another factor is their expertise in that field, although they don't have to be at an opinion formers level of expertise, any previous actions, study or jobs that may help the consumer believe that they do know a little <b>bit</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> they are promoting, also helps with the authenticity of the advert. For some, the more superficial values hold the most weight in persuasion so the mere fact that the OL is attractive is a key for them, also their social standing not only effects the reach of promotion, but also can attribute to the persuasiveness. People who are the most effected by opinion leaders are those who are often engaged under the peripheral route. The peripheral route is less analytical of the actual product at hand, but will be persuaded due to other factors including an opinion leader that the consumer likes, or attractive elements of the packaging. Whereas those who undertake the central route of persuasion are less affected by these often superficial features and are more likely to choose an option based on the merits of the products or the strength of the argument.|$|E

My first contact with a New Orleans resident was with our bus driver, who made it evident how much the ALA conference meant to his city.

40|$|This essay {{attempts}} to articulate and advance a long-term agenda for organizational economics. The essay {{begins with a}} general discussion of four specific items on this agenda, and then moves to a more specific discussion of decision-making in organizations – beginning with two polar-opposite conceptions (team theory and garbage cans) and then describing several recent economic models. Part of the rationale for writing this essay is that this agenda has both substantive and methodological commonalities {{with the work of}} James March. Twenty years ago, I took a mandatory doctoral course on organization theory from Jim March. It has stuck with me ever since, probably more so as time passes. In this celebratory essay, I try to say a <b>bit</b> <b>about</b> why. <b>What</b> I remember most the course is that Jim opened each session by cold-calling a student, asking for a fifteen-minute summary and assessment of the session’s central paper. These cold-calls were ostensibly aided by a roulette wheel in Jim’s head, guaranteed to randomize the terror. But late in the term I became convinced that the wheel was fixed: after I had been either absent or uncharacteristically quiet for several sessions, I recall sitting with my feet on a chair and a banana in my mouth when my number came up.

40|$|Leadership and {{the common}} good are both loaded {{concepts}} – that is, loaded with meaning and politically sensitive. Years ago we engaged in “double loading ” by incorporating common good into our definition of leadership as “the inspiration and mobilization of others to undertake collective action {{in pursuit of the}} common good” (Bryson and Crosby, 1992). Since then we’ve devoted considerable effort to developing a comprehensive framework and practical guidance for leaders and followers engaged in leadership for the common good. We focus on inter-related types of leadership practice: leadership in context; personal, team, and organizational leadership; and at the community or societal level: visionary, political, and ethical leadership. Finally, we emphasize policy entrepreneurship, or integrating all the other types of leadership practice, {{over the course of a}} policy change campaign. We offer a cyclical framework of policy change and we parse views of the common good that may drive or infuse the process. This essay will explain a <b>bit</b> more <b>about</b> <b>what</b> motivated us to link leadership, social change and common good; then we’ll explore our view of leadership and link it to social change organizations. Finally, we will pose some questions that intrigue us. Beginning in the early 1980 s, we began to seriously study how social change occurs. We wanted to know why some individuals and organizations seemed to achieve major shifts in policies, laws, and social mores and why others fell by the wayside. W...|$|R
