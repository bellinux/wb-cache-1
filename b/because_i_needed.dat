500|$|All of {{the many}} {{elements}} in the dream sequences have meaning, {{with the exception of}} the Cheese Man. Whedon explains: [...] "...the Cheese Man—meaningless. Why? <b>Because</b> <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> something in the show that was meaningless, because there is always something in the dream that doesn't make any sense at all. In this case it was the Cheese Man. He confounds everybody because of that, and people ascribe him meaning. This to me means that we're being successful, because this means they're not worried about everything else, which means they sort of did understand most other things." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1988, Love aborted {{her acting}} career and left New York, {{returning}} to the West Coast, citing the [...] "celebutante" [...] fame she'd attained as the central reason. She returned to stripping {{in the small town}} of McMinnville, Oregon, where she was recognized by customers at the bar. This prompted Love to go into isolation, so she relocated to Anchorage, Alaska, where she lived for three months to [...] "gather her thoughts," [...] supporting herself by working at a strip club frequented by local fishermen. [...] "I decided to move to Alaska <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> to get my shit together and learn how to work", she said in retrospect. [...] "So I went on this sort of vision quest. I got rid of all my earthly possessions. I had my bad little strip clothes and some big sweaters, and I moved into a trailer with a bunch of other strippers." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{spending}} {{nine months}} on the sidelines, Jesé returned from injury for the second leg of Real Madrid's tie against UE Cornellà in the Copa del Rey round of 32 on 2 December 2014, replacing Sami Khedira after 57 minutes and scoring the last goal of a 9–1 aggregate victory. On his injury, Jesé stated: [...] "I had a very tough time, but I think that things in life happen for a reason. Maybe I had the injury <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> to learn and become a more mature footballer." [...] Later that month he {{was included in the}} club's squad which won the 2014 FIFA Club World Cup in Japan, making a substitute appearance in a 4–0 win over Cruz Azul in the semi-finals. He scored the first of his three La Liga goals for the season on 4 February 2015 in a 2–1 victory over Sevilla. Jesé struggled to break back into the first team following his injury though, starting only 3 of his 23 appearances for the season, {{and by the end of}} the campaign it was reported that he had grown frustrated at the club and was looking to leave in the summer.|$|E

500|$|According to David Prior, {{producer}} of the subsequent two-disc special edition, the initial bare bones edition [...] "was only reluctantly agreed to by Fincher <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> {{more time on the}} bonus material. The studio was locked into their release date, so Fincher allowed that version to be released first. It {{had nothing to do with}} Fincher 'double dipping his own movie before it even makes it to stores' and everything to do with buying more time for the special edition". He stated that the theatrical cut would only be available on the single-disc edition. Prior elaborated further: [...] "Nobody wants fans feeling like they're being taken advantage of, and I know that double-dipping creates that impression. That's why it was so important to me that consumers be told there was another version coming. In this case it really was a rock-and-a-hard-place situation, and delaying the second release was done strictly for the benefit of the final product... But this is a very ambitious project, easily the most far-reaching I've ever worked on, and owing largely to studio snafus that I can't really elaborate on, I didn't have enough time to do it properly. Thus Fincher bought me the extra time by agreeing to a staggered release, which I'm very grateful for". [...] In its first week, rentals for the DVD earned $6.7 million.|$|E
2500|$|In October 2009, the Colorado Springs Independent {{published}} the first extensive interview with Haggard {{to appear in}} the secular press since the 2006 scandal. Over the course of a 2½-hour interview, the former pastor talked about the scandal, his agreement never to return to New Life or the state of Colorado, suicidal ideas, and the prospect of starting a new church in Colorado Springs. [...] "Back in the old days," [...] said Haggard, [...] "when somebody would get in trouble, they'd just need to move 40 or 50 miles, or a hundred miles, and they could start again. Not anymore. Which {{is one of the reasons}} why we needed to come home. <b>Because</b> <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> to finish this story from here." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dennett did {{not become}} active in the women's {{suffrage}} movement until her marriage began to break up. [...] Later, she wrote, [...] "I went into suffrage work, as perhaps you know, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> an anaesthetic at the time, and suffrage was the nearest thing at hand that was unconnected with my previous work." [...] Dennett began her work as field secretary of the Massachusetts Suffrage Association, organizing lectures, rallies, sermons, cheap meals, speaking tours to gather signatures for petitions, and similar outreach efforts. [...] Dennett's opinion on why women deserved the vote was simple: [...] "Our basic principles that 'governments derive their just powers from {{the consent of the}} governed' [...] undeniably imply the right of women to direct representation by the vote, since women are governed and women are people." ...|$|E

2500|$|Brahms {{has been}} {{described}} as an agnostic and a humanist. The devout Catholic Antonín Dvořák wrote in a letter: [...] "Such a man, such a fine soul – and he believes in nothing! He believes in nothing!" [...] When asked by conductor Karl Reinthaler to add additional sectarian text to his German Requiem, Brahms is reported to have responded, [...] "As far as the text is concerned, I confess that I would gladly omit even the word German and instead use Human; also with my best knowledge and will I would dispense with passages like [...] On the other hand, I have chosen one thing or another because I am a musician, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> it, and because with my venerable authors I can't delete or dispute anything.

2500|$|Norwood {{eventually}} {{decided to}} scrap {{most of the}} project, and instead enlisted Timbaland, with whom the couple had previously worked on Kiley Dean's unreleased Simple Girl album, as the album's main contributor. Impressed by Timaland's input, Norwood rediscovered the musical affection, she had missed on Full Moon and its technical priority. [...] "I made the change <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> to evolve. I needed to explore my talent and versatility and see if I had another side to me, another sound," [...] she said about collaborating. [...] "I wanted to do my own thing, and I've always {{wanted to work with}} Timbaland [...] and see how my voice would sound over his tracks. It was an edgier Brandy, a sassier sound, but still with a lot of heart and a lot of passion." [...] With the help of Timbaland protégés such as Candice Nelson, Steve [...] "Static" [...] Garrett, and co-producer Walter Millsap III the pair worked on what was tentatively titled B-Rocka — a nickname actually given to her by Jerkins — and originally planned for a Christmas 2003 release. Their first collaboration, 1990s tribute [...] "Turn It Up", was leaked onto the internet in autumn 2003, and soon released as a promotional buzz track.|$|E

She was careful to record, however, that she did not perform the usual duties of a priest, [...] "because I was a foreigner, a woman, untrained in temple procedures, and <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> the years left me to carry on the work of spreading Zen to the west." ...|$|E

5000|$|It was {{not until}} they met that Dylan's writing began to address {{issues such as the}} civil rights {{movement}} and the threat of nuclear war. They started living together in early 1962, much to the disapproval of her family. As Dylan's fame grew, Rotolo found the relationship increasingly stressful. She wrote: Bob was charismatic: he was a beacon, a lighthouse, he was also a black hole. He required committed backup and protection I was unable to provide consistently, probably <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> them myself. ...

5000|$|The {{themes of}} sexual {{identity}} and the challenges of growing up are repeated throughout the body of Benning's work. Benning uses pop culture, such as music, television or newspapers, to amplify their message while simultaneously parodying the same pop culture.

[...] "They're totally fake and constructed to entertain and oppress {{at the same time}} - they're meaningless to women, and not just to gay women. I got started partly <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> different images and I never wanted to wait for someone to do it for me".
