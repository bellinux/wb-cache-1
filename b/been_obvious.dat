5|$|For {{technical}} advice, {{the journalists}} engaged Lieutenant Colonel George Styles GC, a retired British Army {{officer who was}} regarded as an expert in explosives and ballistics. Styles believed {{that it would have}} <b>been</b> <b>obvious</b> to the authorities that Savage's car was unlikely to contain a bomb as the weight would have <b>been</b> <b>obvious</b> on the vehicle's springs; he also expressed his opinion that a remote detonator could not have reached the car park from the scenes of the shootings given the number of buildings and other obstacles between the locations. As the government refused to comment on the shootings until the inquest, the documentary concluded by putting its evidence to a leading human rights lawyer, who expressed his belief that a judicial inquiry was necessary to establish the facts surrounding the shootings.|$|E
5|$|Militarily, a major {{lesson for}} the Greeks was the {{potential}} of the hoplite phalanx. This style had developed during internecine warfare amongst the Greeks; since each city-state fought in the same way, {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} the hoplite phalanx had not <b>been</b> <b>obvious.</b> Marathon was the first time a phalanx faced more lightly armed troops, and revealed how effective the hoplites could be in battle. The phalanx formation was still vulnerable to cavalry (the cause of much caution by the Greek forces at the Battle of Plataea), but used in the right circumstances, it was now shown to be a potentially devastating weapon.|$|E

The Persians seem to have more-or-less disregarded the military lessons of Marathon. The composition of infantry for the second invasion seems to have been the same as during the first, despite the availability of hoplites and other heavy infantry in Persian-ruled lands. Having won battles against hoplites previously, the Persians may simply have regarded Marathon as an aberration.|$|E

5|$|In 1975, {{while serving}} at the FCO, Penfold volunteered {{to learn a}} {{difficult}} language {{in the hope of}} advancing his career. After passing an aptitude test, he was assigned a professional language tutor and began learning Amharic—the official language of Ethiopia—and after six weeks of tuition, was sent to Gondar to continue learning the language by living in Ethiopia. Shortly after, he was posted to Addis Ababa as second secretary, because the British ambassador to Ethiopia, Sir Willie Morris, was keen to have an Amharic-speaking second secretary. Penfold was responsible for monitoring and reporting on internal Ethiopian affairs and the Organisation of African Unity (OAU), as the latter was based in Addis. As part of the role, Penfold was required to attend and report on meetings of the OAU, which took place all over Africa. On the instruction of Foreign Secretary David Owen, Penfold met with the leaders of the independence movement in Southern Rhodesia (modern-day Zimbabwe) at an OAU conference in Gabon in 1977. There he met separately with Bishop Muzorewa, Joshua Nkomo, and Robert Mugabe. Penfold believed Mugabe to be difficult to work with, but later stated that it should have <b>been</b> <b>obvious</b> that Mugabe would come to power in Zimbabwe and that the British government could have made a greater effort to work with him.|$|E
25|$|Captain O'Connor only {{mentioned}} the two prints on the obverse {{side of the}} note and none on the reverse. Further, since {{both sides of the}} note are photographed immediately after fuming by the FBI a third print on the reverse side would have <b>been</b> <b>obvious</b> on the note itself and {{at the time of the}} development of the photograph of the note. Yet, despite the testing occurring in mid-January, this third print wasn't discovered until early July, six months later and approximately two weeks after Heirens was arrested, despite Laffey working on the Degnan case almost exclusively for six months.|$|E
25|$|By {{the middle}} of the 20th century, Number 10 was falling apart again. The {{deterioration}} had <b>been</b> <b>obvious</b> for some time. The number of people allowed in the upper floors was limited for fear the bearing walls would collapse. The staircase had sunk several inches; some steps were buckled and the balustrade was out of alignment. Dry rot was widespread throughout. The interior wood in the Cabinet Room's double columns was like sawdust. Skirting boards, doors, sills and other woodwork were riddled and weakened with disease. After reconstruction had begun, miners dug down into the foundations and found that the huge wooden beams supporting the house had decayed.|$|E
5000|$|In {{determining}} whether {{the subject matter}} of a patent claim <b>is</b> <b>obvious,</b> neither the particular motivation nor the avowed purpose of the patentee controls. What matters is the objective reach of the claim. If the claim extends to what <b>is</b> <b>obvious,</b> it <b>is</b> invalid under §103. One {{of the ways in which}} a patent's subject matter can <b>be</b> proved <b>obvious</b> <b>is</b> by noting that there existed at the time of invention a known problem for which there <b>was</b> an <b>obvious</b> solution encompassed by the patent's claims.|$|R

25|$|Cultural {{influence}} from the United Kingdom and the United States has <b>been</b> <b>obvious</b> since the war. Imported and indigenous subcultures rose, with the rockabilly-inspired raggare and anarchist progg cultures as notable examples. (Before the world wars, Swedish culture was more inspired by Germany). Swedish film and music achieved international fame {{with names like}} Ingmar Bergman, Sven Nykvist, Lasse Hallström, Birgit Nilsson, ABBA, Entombed, Roxette, Denniz Pop and Max Martin. Currently, Sweden is the only non-English-speaking {{country in the world}} with a net export of music. Most Swedes are today proficient in English, a great deal of Swedish-produced popular music has originally English lyrics, and English language branding is very common.|$|E
25|$|On 2 May 2006, Breakfast {{moved into}} studio N6 at Television Centre with other BBC One news {{programmes}} {{that required a}} larger set design that included walls of Barco video screens. The original screen scenes of cirrus clouds on a blue sky were changed {{as a result of}} viewer comments that 'it looked too cold'their replacement was with orange squares of the same design as those appearing in the programme's new title sequence, which were designed to hide any joins or faults between the screens which had previously <b>been</b> <b>obvious.</b> The screens eventually displayed visuals needed for story content: different backgrounds, graphics and still photographs. More importantly, the set had a generic visual style {{that could be used for}} other programmes, such as the national news bulletins, without much additional physical change. The programme celebrated its 20th anniversary on 17 January 2003.|$|E
500|$|The {{conspicuous}} warning colours of many insects, skunks, {{snakes and}} salamanders are discussed. [...] "It must have <b>been</b> <b>obvious</b> {{to any one}} interested in natural history that the insects met with during a walk in summer may be arranged in two great groups: ... difficult to find ... and ... startling colours and conspicuous attitudes" [...] The association of warning with [...] "nauseous or dangerous" [...] animals is identified. The idea that warning coloured animals must be scarce relative to palatable ones is mentioned, along with the reason why different animals use the same warning colours.|$|E

500|$|After her {{inaugural session}} of First Minister's Questions on 22 December 2011, the BBC's Brian Taylor called Lamont's {{performance}} [...] "confident, direct and salient". Cochrane {{has suggested that}} she emerged as the prevailing force at the weekly debates with Salmond, writing in May 2013, [...] "it's <b>been</b> <b>obvious</b> {{for some time to}} {{those of us in the}} cheap seats that Johann Lamont has more than got his measure." [...] Peter Hetherington of The Guardian quotes an unnamed political observer at Holyrood who said, [...] "She's getting under [...] skin like no predecessor." [...] Writing for The Scotsman as Scottish Labour gathered for its conference in April 2013, Andrew Whitaker felt that Lamont's tenure as party leader had been successful, citing Labour's local election achievements and her weekly exchanges with Salmond at First Minister's Questions as examples: [...] "Ms Lamont has made Labour at Holyrood respectable again and less of the laughing stock than the ravaged party that emerged from heavy defeat in 2011." ...|$|E
500|$|Biko was {{examined}} by a doctor, Ivor Lang, who stated {{that there was}} no evidence of injury on Biko. Later scholarship has suggested Biko's injuries must have <b>been</b> <b>obvious.</b> He was then examined by two other doctors who, after a test showed blood cells to have entered Biko's spinal fluid, agreed that he should be transported to a prison hospital in Pretoria. On 11 September, police loaded him into the back of a Land Rover, naked and manacled, and drove him [...] to the hospital. There, Biko died alone in a cell on 12 September 1977. According to an autopsy, an [...] "extensive brain injury" [...] had caused [...] "centralisation of the blood circulation to such an extent that there had been intravasal blood coagulation, acute kidney failure, and uremia". He was the twenty-first person to die in a South African prison in twelve months, and the forty-sixth political detainee to die during interrogation since the government introduced laws permitting imprisonment without trial in 1963.|$|E
500|$|The singer had to {{tone down}} some of the suggestive lyrics to please the {{officers}} at Disney, the producers of Dick Tracy, who were worried about their image. In Ireland, the song was subject to controversy after two women's organizations accused Madonna of glorifying violence against women, specifically on the line [...] "I'll settle for the back of your hand"; one of the groups, the National Women's Council of Ireland, labelled the song [...] "highly dangerous" [...] while the other group, Ireland's Women's Aid, said the line was [...] "extremely harmful". Although initially approving of the idea of [...] "getting spanked"—even admitting her fondness on The Arsenio Hall Show—Madonna later backed down from the theme of spanking, explaining that the lyrics were written as a joke and believed that it was instead her character Breathless Mahoney that liked to get spanked. She added that it should have <b>been</b> <b>obvious</b> that the song was humorous in nature, since Madonna believed her image was more of a dominant person who took charge, contrary to the song's characterization.|$|E

500|$|Benfica {{began the}} year with a match against Vitória de Setúbal. After trouble {{penetrating}} Setúbal's defense, Mantorras scored in the 71th minute. However, Setúbal rallied and tied the game for a point. The result surprised Camacho: [...] "I though we would win. After we scored, we did not retained the ball. A team like Benfica has to do that." [...] Two Benfica players, Luisão and Katsouranis, had a disagreement during the game; they were immediately substituted, and later suspended. On 12 January, Benfica hosted Leixões at the Luz. They struggled to control Leixões, who had {{the upper hand in}} a scoreless draw. Camacho was disappointed: [...] "We lacked focus; it's apparent since the Champions League elimination that we do." [...] A week later, Benfica played Feirense in the fifth round of the Portuguese Cup, advancing to the next round on a 52nd-minute goal by Cardozo. Camacho said, [...] "I did not like the game. We are playing differently than we are training. The difference in quality between both teams should have <b>been</b> <b>obvious</b> and it was not." [...] On 26 January, Benfica played Vitória de Guimarães at the Estádio D. Afonso Henriques. They scored in the eighth minute, when Cardozo converted a free kick from 30 meters out. Di María assisted Maxi Pereira on a second goal, with Guimarães scoring in the 60th minute. In extra time, Cardozo scored his second goal on a mistake by Nilson.|$|E

[...] However, it had <b>been</b> <b>obvious</b> even before then that the Bruins needed a new arena; since 1955 the Men's Gym's capacity had been limited to 1,500 by order of the Los Angeles fire marshal. [...] Games that were expected to attract larger crowds were played at Pan Pacific Auditorium, the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena and other venues around Los Angeles.|$|E
