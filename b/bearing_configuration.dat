40|$|Designing a {{space suit}} is very complex and often {{requires}} difficult trade-offs between performance, cost, mass, and system complexity. During the development {{period of the}} suit numerous design iterations need to occur before the hardware meets human performance requirements. Using computer models early in the design phase of hardware development is advantageous, by allowing virtual prototyping to take place. A virtual design environment allows designers to think creatively, exhaust design possibilities, and study design impacts on suit and human performance. A model of the rigid components of the Mark III Technology Demonstrator Suit (planetary-type space suit) and a human manikin were created and tested in a virtual environment. The performance of the Mark III hip bearing model was first developed and evaluated virtually by comparing the differences in mobility performance between the nominal <b>bearing</b> <b>configurations</b> and modified <b>bearing</b> <b>configurations.</b> Suited human performance was then simulated with the model and compared to actual suited human performance data using the same <b>bearing</b> <b>configurations.</b> The Mark III hip bearing model was able to visually represent complex bearing rotations and the theoretical volumetric ranges of motion in three dimensions. The model was also able to predict suited human hip flexion and abduction maximums to within 10 % of the actual suited human subject data, except for one modified bearing condition in hip flexion which was off by 24 %. Differences between the model predictions and the human subject performance data were attributed {{to the lack of}} joint moment limits in the model, human subject fitting issues, and the limited suit experience of some of the subjects.

Also, a narrow-groove approximation in the treatment of the temperature field was formulated to apply the procedure to the Whipple thrust bearing. A comparative trade-off study was carried out assuming isothermal films; its results showed the shrouded-step design to be superior to the Whipple design for the intended application.

40|$|UltraForm Finishing (UFF) is a production-level optical {{polishing}} process {{consisting of}} a moving belt that is pressed into an optical surface by a carrier wheel. The current configuration is comprised of a cylindrical carrier wheel attached to cylindrical roller bearings. As the optics market is moving towards aspheric geometry with smaller radii of curvature, geometric limitations associated with roller bearings requires {{the development of a}} modified approach to the UFF process. This thesis explores the feasibility of incorporating spherical fluid bearing elements in the UFF process as a replacement for roller bearings. Self-acting (or wedge film) and externally pressurized hydrostatic spherical fluid-film bearings were investigated for the UFF process. The self-acting bearing was modeled and analyzed using a previously developed hydrodynamic finite element computer program. The hydrostatic bearing was modeled using an analytical formulation of the Reynolds equation coupled with empirical data to account for entrance flow effects at the feed hole and to account for pressure drops in the bearing fluid supply system. Both <b>bearing</b> <b>configurations</b> predicted adequate fluid film thickness under steady load and speed. Performance tests on the UFF were completed with both <b>bearing</b> <b>configurations</b> under steady load and speed. Ball to cup seizure was observed with the self-acting configuration nearly immediately after initial load and speed application, with seizure presumably due to inadequate squeeze film resistance during the transient startup period. The hydrostatic bearing operated successfully over a wide range of applied loads and speeds employed in the current UFF process with minimal cup and ball wear. The feasibility of the hydrostatic spherical bearing element in the UFF process was subsequently demonstrated through the generation of repeatable and acceptable removal function maps which were then employed in the polishing of a planar optical surface...|$|R
