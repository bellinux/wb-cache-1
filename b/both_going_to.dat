Bullock made his loan permanent and signed an 18-month contract, and David Brown signed after impressing on a trial. Five players also left Valley Parade on loan deals during January, with Craig Bentham joining Farsley Celtic, Luke Medley joining Cambridge City, Sean Taylforth and Luke Morgan <b>both</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> Droylsden, and Simon Ainge joining Halifax Town. Goalkeeper Donovan Ricketts was also expected to leave but his transfer to Queens Park Rangers collapsed after the Home Office rejected his application for a work permit.|$|E
25|$|In the law-books (smṛtis and dharma-sūtras, {{like the}} Manu-smṛti), naraka {{is a place}} of {{punishment}} for sins. It is a lower spiritual plane (called naraka-loka) where the spirit is judged and the partial fruits of karma affect the next life. In Mahabharata there is a mention of the Pandavas and the Kauravas <b>both</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> Heaven. At first Yudhisthir goes to heaven where he sees Duryodhana enjoying heaven; Indra tells him that Duryodhana is in heaven as he did his Kshatriya duties. Then he shows Yudhisthir hell where it appears his brothers are. Later it is revealed that this was a test for Yudhisthir and that his brothers and the Kauravas are all in heaven and live happily in the divine abode of gods. Hells are also described in various Puranas and other scriptures. The Garuda Purana gives a detailed account of Hell and its features; it lists the amount of punishment for most crimes, much like a modern-day penal code.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{recurring}} storylines involves Garfield getting lost or running away. The longest {{one of these}} lasted for over a month (in 1986 August 25 to September 28); it began with Jon telling Garfield to go get the newspaper. Garfield walks outside to get it, but speculates {{about what will happen}} if he wanders off – and decides to find out. Jon notices Garfield has been gone too long, so he sends Odie out to find him. He quickly realizes his mistake (Odie, being not too bright, also gets lost). Jon starts to get lonely, so he offers a reward for the return of Garfield and Odie. He is not descriptive, so animals including an elephant, monkeys, a seal, a snake, a kangaroo and joey, and turtles are brought to Jon's house for the reward. After a series of events, including Odie being adopted by a small girl, both pets meeting up at a circus that they briefly joined, and <b>both</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> a pet shop, Garfield and Odie make it back home.|$|E

2500|$|Studies of {{the actions}} of each ship confirm another factor which was long suspected, that once sight contact was established, the SS Andrea Doria took an evasive action which {{increased}} the likelihood of a collision and worsened the situation. In other words, the Italian ship turned to its left, and subsequently the Swedish turned to its right, which {{in the case of an}} impending collision meant that they turned towards each other. The best way to avoid a collision is for both parties to turn away, by <b>both</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> their [...] "left" [...] or both going [...] "right." [...] Hence, the rules of the road specify the direction a ship should turn; if both ships follow the same avoidance rules, then they minimize the chance of a collision.|$|E
2500|$|The Parasol first flew during 1930, two {{being built}} in quick {{succession}} and <b>both</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough in September and October. [...] The standard height for measurement flights was about 8,000ft (2,440 m) and the supercharged engine took the aircraft to this altitude in a little over 12 minutes. [...] The first of the Parasols (RAF serial K1228) was initially fitted with a fully slotted wing of the well-used RAF28 section. At one stage the upper surface of its wing was covered in wool tufts and a camera was fitted to a high pylon {{just in front of}} the tail to record their behaviour. The second (K1229) flew with wings having full-span split trailing edges and out-rigged ailerons. 1930 Farnborough records log the two as in the Aerodynamic Flight, with K1228 doing [...] "flight path recorder" [...] work and K1229 [...] "test of wing section". [...] The flight air log was lowered in flight below the port wing. [...] The second Parasol remained in use at Farnborough until August 1936 and the first flew on until January 1937.|$|E
