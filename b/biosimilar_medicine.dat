40|$|Biosimilar {{medicines}} are biological medicines {{that have}} been developed to be highly similar and clinically equivalent to an existing biological medicine. The introduction of these medicines provides additional patient choice and enables financial savings. These savings can be used within the NHS to help support the use of new treatments as they become available and further develop services for patients. The NHS already has a history of using biosimilar medicines for indications such as growth hormone deficiency, neutropenia associated with chemotherapy and anaemia related to renal disease. Biosimilar infliximab is now available for the management of a number of rheumatology conditions and, in the next few years, additional biosimilar medicines will become available for rheumatology patients. The introduction of biosimilars requires careful planning, the expertise of a multidisciplinary team and effective communication. Of utmost importance is the involvement of the patient in the decision to use a biosimilar. Current NHS policy states: "The decision to prescribe a biological medicine for an individual patient, whether an originator or <b>biosimilar</b> <b>medicine,</b> rests with the responsible clinician in consultation with the patient.

With the expiration of patent exclusivity for {{the first wave of}} rhGH products and other biopharmaceuticals, the opportunity emerged for the development of <b>biosimilar</b> <b>medicines.</b> A <b>biosimilar</b> is defined by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) as a biological medicine that is similar to another biological medicine that has already been authorized for use.  The EMA led the way (well ahead of the Food and Drug Administration in the US) in developing the biosimilar concept, and the type of science-based regulatory framework required to ensure high-quality, safe, and effective biosimilar medicines; the provisions for approval of biosimilars have been in place in Europe since 2005. Under these provisions, Omnitrope® was approved by the EMA in 2006 as the world’s first biosimilar medicine; 2016 therefore marks the 10 th anniversary of its approval in Europe. A substantial data set, based on clinical development studies and 10  years of postapproval use, has now accumulated for biosimilar rhGH; this data set shows that the product is an effective treatment option for children who require rhGH treatment, and has a safety profile that is consistent with the rhGH class. The decade since the EMA approved biosimilar rhGH has seen the successful approval and clinical use of 20 <b>biosimilar</b> <b>medicines,</b> confirming the integrity of the scientific basis for the biosimilar concept, as well as the quality of regulatory decision-making.

40|$|Paul J Declerck, 1 Steven Simoens 21 Laboratory for Pharmaceutical Biology, 2 Research Centre for Pharmaceutical Care and Pharmacoeconomics, Department of Pharmaceutical and Pharmacological Sciences, KU Leuven, Leuven, BelgiumAbstract: Biopharmaceuticals {{are complex}} {{molecules}} produced by living cells. Copies of these drugs, called biosimilars, are not identical to their reference medicine, and therefore specific regulatory requirements for registration apply. Pharmaceutical quality evaluation requires a complete dossier and a detailed comparative analysis to the reference drug. However, nonclinical and clinical requirements {{are much less}} extensive compared to the requirements for an innovator. Therefore, {{at the time of}} introduction onto the market, only limited clinical experience is available for the biosimilar. Differences of 15 %– 30 % between the acquisition price of biosimilars and their corresponding reference biopharmaceuticals have been suggested in the literature. Although the percentage price difference between reference biopharmaceuticals and <b>biosimilar</b> <b>medicines</b> may be limited, absolute savings are still likely to be substantial when calculated with respect to expensive reference biopharmaceutical medicines. Although an economic evaluation needs to be carried out in an increasing number of European countries to inform reimbursement decisions, uncertainty exists about how such an economic evaluation should be conducted for a biosimilar. The assessment of the cost-effectiveness of a biosimilar for reimbursement purposes depends primarily on the relative efficacy, given that a biosimilar is likely to be less expensive than the reference biopharmaceutical. To date, the question of meaningful differences in efficacy between biosimilar and biopharmaceutical drugs has not been answered. Due to a lack of demand-side incentives, <b>biosimilar</b> <b>medicines</b> have enjoyed limited success in Europe to date. Other factors that inhibit the market accessibility of biosimilars include the limited number of companies that have the expertise and the financial ability to manufacture, gain marketing authorization for, and commercialize biosimilars; physician brand loyalty to reference biopharmaceutical medicines; application of rebate contracts to reference biopharmaceutical medicines following expiry of protection; and life-cycle management strategies of companies marketing reference biopharmaceutical medicines.

Responses from 102 medical specialists, 253 GPs and 125 community pharmacists were analysed.

40|$|According to the European Medicine Agency, a “biosimilar” is a {{biological}} medicinal product that contains {{a version of the}} active substance of an original {{biological medicinal product}} (reference or innovative medicinal product) that has been authorized in the European Economic Area. The similarity to the reference medicinal product in terms of quality, biological activity, safety and efficacy needs to be set on a comprehensive comparability basis. The generic standard approach (demonstration of bioequivalence with a reference medicinal product by appropriate bioavailability studies), which is applicable {{to a wide range of}} chemically derived medicinal products, is not sufficient to prove the similarity of biotechnology derived products due to their structural complexity. Furthermore, these biopharmaceuticals products, in comparison with the conventional ones, show a greater ability to activate the immune response. The evaluation of <b>biosimilar</b> <b>medicines</b> for authorisation purposes by the European Medicine Agency does not include recommendations on whether a biosimilar should be used interchangeably with its reference medicine. Substitution policies are, therefore, within the remit of the EU member states.

A science-based regulatory framework to ensure high-quality biosimilars has been established in Europe since 2005 and is monitored and updated on an ongoing basis. The guiding principle of a biosimilar development program is to establish similarity between the biosimilar and the reference medicine by the best possible means, ensuring that the previously proven safety and efficacy of the reference medicinal product also applies to the biosimilar. Development of a biosimilar is underpinned by state-of-the-art analytical techniques to characterize both reference <b>medicines</b> and <b>biosimilars.</b> The extent and nature of the nonclinical in vivo studies and clinical studies to be performed depend on the level of evidence obtained in the previous step(s), including the robustness of the physicochemical, biological, and nonclinical in vitro data. Extrapolation is an important element of the biosimilarity concept. When biosimilar comparability has been demonstrated in one indication, extrapolation of the data package to other indications of the reference medicine could be acceptable, but needs to be scientifically justified and considered in light of the demonstrated level of sameness by all analytical, nonclinical, and clinical data. The credibility of the scientific basis behind the biosimilar concept, and quality of regulatory decision-making, is demonstrated by the successful approval and clinical use of 20 <b>biosimilar</b> <b>medicines</b> since 2006 when Omnitrope® was the first biosimilar to be approved.

40|$|The biosimilars {{market is}} {{potentially}} the single fastest growing pharmaceutical sector {{with an estimated}} worth of US 67 bn in global sales by 2020. This market generally refers to larger molecule, biological, protein-based pharmaceuticals which have lost its patent. This has stimulated the emergence of non-conventional pharmaceutical investors such as Fujifilm and Samsung as well as host countries such as Brazil, Mexico, China, India, South Korea, Turkey and Russia, which view biosimilars as a key macroeconomic driver of growth. Internationally, the European Medicines Agency has led the regulation of the quality, safety and efficacy of biosimilars; however, many countries have developed their own biosimilar regulatory frameworks. Despite the similarity of these with European guidelines, differences do exist across jurisdictions and have implications for cross-jurisdictional registration and regulation. The consideration of biosimilar regulation, however, demands attention beyond quality, safety and efficacy. The potential implications of extended patent protection, international trade and globalisation require a congruent policy approach to their regulation.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: A “biosimilar” is a {{biological}} medicine {{similar to a}} licensed biological medicine (“originator”). As of October 2014, six biosimilars are licensed and marketed in Great Britain (GB) (three biosimilar filgrastims, two biosimilar epoetins and one <b>biosimilar</b> somatropin). Biological <b>medicines</b> are highly costly to the NHS, so {{it is expected that}} biosimilars will have an increasing presence as a cost-saving mechanism. This study explored the uptake of biosimilars within GB formularies. METHODS: Websites of acute trusts in England and health boards in Scotland and Wales were searched for the most recent drug formularies. The presence of biosimilars in a formulary was examined for all six products. Formularies that listed at least one biosimilar were considered to have a positive recognition of these products. RESULTS: Of 158 acute trusts in England and 21 health boards in Scotland and Wales, 176 websites were available, providing 144 formularies (England: 127, Scotland: 9; Wales: 7; England/Scotland shared: 1). 17 formularies were shared across trusts and boards. At least one biosimilar was listed in 63 formularies. While 45 formularies listed at least one biosimilar filgrastim, 31 and 17 formularies listed biosimilar somatropin and epoetin, respectively. Five formularies listed at least one biosimilar from each of the three classes, 20 formularies listed at least one from two classes, and 38 formularies listed at least one from only one class.
