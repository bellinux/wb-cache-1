Subjects were evaluated for velopharyngeal closure function before and after surgery at 1 (short-term evaluation) and 3 (mid-term evaluation) years. Degree of hypernasality and degree of air leakage through the nose in the soft <b>blowing</b> <b>test</b> were each classified into three grades and each grade was given scores. Velopharyngeal closure function was classified according to the total score into four grades: “good”, "fair”, "slightly poor” and “poor”.

More satisfactory results were obtained at the mid-term evaluation, with 14 patients (100 %) graded as “good” or “fair”.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe large lift coefficient changes attainable with Circulation Control Airfoils through {{small changes in}} boundary layer blowing suggest rotary wing cyclic control can be obtained through modulation of the blowing. Static pressure distributions were obtained to assess the unsteady behavior of a Circulation Control Rotor in a two-dimensional flow. A constant-radius hotwire wake traversing mechanism was constructed to augment the pressure data and to study the flow phenomena occurring {{in the region of}} Coanda jet separation. Through correlation of turbulence intensity data with the pressure data, it was discovered that the point of Coanda jet separation could be located using the hotwire. The objective of these tests was accordingly expanded to include correlation of the location of separation with flow parameter variation. Although steady flow, steady blowing tests results were favorable, the unsteady <b>blowing</b> <b>test</b> was restricted in scope because of an inability of the injection air compressor to provide an adequate flow, and because the real-time acquisition system was not completed in time for these tests.

40|$|AbstractIn {{the present}} study, {{the effects of}} bulb type palatal lift {{prosthesis}} (bulb-PLP) therapy on nasality and velopharyngeal function (VPF) of patients with velopharyngeal incompetence (VPI) following palatoplasty were longitudinally assessed. The subjects included 18 patients (3 to 52 years of age) who had shown persistent VPI following palatoplasty and who had received bulb-PLP therapy. Nasality and VPF were assessed by perceptual voice analysis, nasometer test, <b>blowing</b> <b>test,</b> and cephalometric radiographic examination. Based on the outcomes of bulb-PLP therapy, the subjects were classified into two groups: the effective group and the ineffective group. Furthermore, the obturating and VPF-activating effects by bulb-PLP therapy were analyzed, and factors relating to different VPF activities were determined. All subjects achieved adequate VPF by wearing a bulb-PLP. After treatment, 10 patients (55. 6 %) achieved successful activation of VPF without bulb-PLP (the effective group), while persistent VPI remained in 8 patients (the ineffective group). The beginning-blowing ratio of the effective group was significantly {{greater than that of}} the ineffective group (P < 0. 05) and the velopharyngeal distance (V-P distance) of the effective group tended to be smaller (P = 0. 07). Regarding the shape of the bulb head, the angular type was dominant in the ineffective group, while the round type was dominant in the effective group. Bulb-PLP therapy was useful for providing adequate VPF activation. Possible signs of the subsequent effective activation of VPF are considered to be: 1) preexisting adequate VPF on blowing, 2) smaller V-P distance, and 3) synchronized palatopharyngeal movement...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Fracture {{mechanics}} {{testing at}} dynamic loading conditions requires appropriate methods for {{the measurement of}} force and displacement. In some cases additional measurement techniques must be used to obtain further information like the time of crack initiation. Dedicated standard pro-cedures for impact type dynamic fracture mechanics tests are not available. Several standards on quasistatic or elevated loading rate fracture mechanics testing provide some more general experi-mental guidelines and they often exclude impact conditions. Therefore, {{the first step of}} dynamic fracture mechanics investigations should always be to establish an appropriate and validated test method. The present paper reports on results of dynamic fracture mechanics investigations on bend type specimens. Series of large scale full <b>blow</b> bending <b>tests</b> on SE(B) 140 specimens were performed at- 40 °C and stress intensity rates of 5 ∙ 104 MPa√ms- 1.

The fracture mechanics characteristics of the materials in dependence on microstructural and loading parameters will be reported elsewhere.

40|$|International audienceCracking by {{thermal fatigue}} {{is one of}} the major {{problems}} encountered during the operation of numerous parts such as exhaust manifolds or brake discs. One way to improve their lifespan is to develop new materials solutions. Estimating thermo-mechanical fatigue resistance of new materials can be performed with a specific test machine developed by CTIF, associating a multi-position wheel, an induction heating and a cooling by air <b>blowing.</b> <b>Test</b> consists in measuring the number of thermal cycles corresponding to the first crack appearance and to the complete failure of a specific versatile sample. Two examples of studies performed with this machine are shown hereafter. First tests were performed to compare the thermo-mechanical fatigue resistance of different grades of ferritic spheroidal graphite cast iron. These materials are an interesting alternative to alloyed steels or nickel-alloyed cast irons, for the constitution of exhaust manifolds and turbine housings working in the upper-middle temperatures (up to 950 °C). The compared materials are SG irons alloyed with silicon (with or without molybdenum), and aluminium. Truck brakes dissipate several megajoules of energy every few seconds, which leads to high thermal stresses in the rubbing discs. Therefore, truck brake discs are mainly damaged by thermal fatigue cracking. One improvement way is to evolve disc material with the aim of increasing their thermal fatigue resistance while keeping the braking performance. For the thermal fatigue tests being as close as possible to real brake conditions, a specific geometry of sample and inductor was developed, to reproduce the thermal gradients observed during tests on real brake discs. The test parameters were then chosen after a coupled numerical-experimental study on full-scale braking. Behaviour of different materials under cycling loading (microstructural changes and cracking) is compared with regard to the results obtained during braking tests...|$|E

40|$|CONTEXT: This paper analyze healthy {{musicians who}} play wind instruments. OBJECTIVE: To {{identify}} possible diverticular formations on the laryngopharyngeal wall produced by pharyngeal overpressure during {{the use of}} these instruments. METHODS: Through a videofluoroscopic method, 22 professional musicians had their pharynx analyzed in frontal face and profile, by swallowing 20 mL of barium sulfate solution and blowing against resistance. RESULTS: All the volunteers showed lateral laryngopharyngeal diverticula (3 unilateral and 19 bilateral) with areas ranging from 0. 7 to 6 cm². Trumpet and clarinet players showed larger diverticula, on both the right and left sides. Any important complaints were noted spontaneously or after questions. In the barium-swallow analyses, the 41 diverticula previously identified in the <b>blowing</b> <b>tests</b> were not seen or appeared to be smaller, because of the free flux passage from the pharynx to the esophagus. Despite the existence of the other, less resistant areas on the laryngopharyngeal segment, no other protrusions could be found in this group of wind instrumentalists. CONCLUSIONS: The lateral laryngopharyngeal diverticula that occur in blow instrumentalists is distinct of diverticula produced by laryngopharyngeal overpressure determined by abnormally high resistance to flux passage from pharynx to esophagus. In musicians is the persistent and continuous pharyngeal overpressure induced by the resistance of the instrument's mouthpiece will strongly distend the anatomically less resistant areas of the pharynx, producing a large protrusion. Laryngopharyngeal overpressure without abnormal resistance to flux passage explain the way blow instrumentalists protrusions did not appear as full sacs in a barium-swallow test, despite their larger dimensions. As final conclusion the musician-acquired diverticula must be considered as an "occupational overuse syndrome"...|$|R
