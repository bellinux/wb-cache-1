5000|$|The UK Department of Health's Rolleston Committee Report in 1926 {{established}} the British approach to diamorphine prescription to users, which was maintained {{for the next}} 40 years: dealers were prosecuted, but doctors could prescribe diamorphine to users when withdrawing from it would cause harm or severe distress to the patient. This [...] "policing and prescribing" [...] policy effectively controlled the perceived diamorphine problem in the UK until 1959 {{when the number of}} diamorphine addicts doubled every 16 months during the ten years from 1959 to 1968. In 1964 the Brain Committee recommended that only selected approved doctors working at approved specialised centres be allowed to prescribe diamorphine and <b>benzoylmethylecgonine</b> (cocaine) to users. The law was made more restrictive in 1968. Beginning in the 1970s, the emphasis shifted to abstinence and the use of methadone; currently {{only a small number of}} users in the UK are prescribed diamorphine.|$|E

40|$|Cocaine (<b>benzoylmethylecgonine),</b> {{a natural}} alkaloid, is a {{powerful}} psychostimulant and a highly addictive drug. Unfortunately, the relationships between its behavioral and electrophysiological effects are not clear. We investigated the effects of cocaine on the firing of midbrain dopaminergic (DA) neurons, both in anesthetized and awake rats, using pre-implanted multielectrode arrays and a recently developed telemetric recording system. In anesthetized animals, cocaine (10 [*]mg/kg, intraperitoneally) produced a general decrease of the firing rate and bursting of DA neurons, sometimes preceded by a transient increase in both parameters, as previously reported by others. In awake rats, however, injection of cocaine led to a very different pattern of changes in firing. A decrease in firing rate and bursting was observed in only 14 % of DA neurons. Most of the other DA neurons underwent increases in firing rate and bursting: these changes were correlated with locomotor activity in 52 % of the neurons, but were uncorrelated in 29 % of them. Drug concentration measurements indicated that the observed {{differences between the two}} conditions did not have a pharmacokinetic origin. Taken together, our results demonstrate that cocaine injection differentially affects the electrical activity of DA neurons in awake and anesthetized states. The observed increases in neuronal activity may in part reflect the cocaine-induced synaptic potentiation found ex vivo in these neurons. Our observations also show that electrophysiological recordings in awake animals can uncover drug effects, which are masked by general anesthesia. Peer reviewe...|$|E
