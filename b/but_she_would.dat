5|$|Greenwald left WWE and a {{full-time}} wrestling career in April 2005. Reportedly, {{she was beginning}} to become disenchanted with WWE, who began to focus on looks rather than wrestling ability. She also hated that her character had become a villain, {{but that is not the}} direct cause of her leaving the company. Greenwald, however, stated that all of the aforementioned reasons are incorrect, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> like to keep the real reason she left WWE private. Crap|medium=DVD|date=2005}} She decided to take a break from WWE and spend some time with her family and enjoy life.|$|E
5|$|In 1897, her {{daughter}} Irène was born. To support her family, Curie began {{teaching at the}} École Normale Supérieure. The Curies {{did not have a}} dedicated laboratory; most of their research was carried out in a converted shed next to the School of Physics and Chemistry. The shed, formerly a medical school dissecting room, was poorly ventilated and not even waterproof. They were unaware of the deleterious effects of radiation exposure attendant on their continued unprotected work with radioactive substances. The School did not sponsor her research, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> receive subsidies from metallurgical and mining companies and from various organizations and governments.|$|E

5|$|Medium Alison {{writes a}} letter to her parents but does not mention Joan or her recent {{realization}} she is a lesbian. Bruce orders Small Alison {{to put on a}} dress, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> rather wear a jean jacket. Bruce tells her that she would be the only girl without a dress and that the other children would laugh at her; she leaves on the dress ("Party Dress"). Medium Alison proudly tells Joan that she has written {{a letter to}} her parents telling them that she is a lesbian, but begins to second-guess herself (beginning to wonder if she's asexual) until Joan kisses her. That night, she is excited and joyful at having had sex with Joan ("Changing My Major").|$|E
5|$|Taking {{precautions}} against further resistance, Darius sent {{soldiers to}} seize Intaphernes, {{along with his}} son, family members, relatives and any friends who were capable of arming themselves. Darius believed that Intaphernes was planning a rebellion, {{but when he was}} brought to the court, there was no proof of any such plan. Nonetheless, Darius killed Intaphernes's entire family, excluding his wife's brother and son. She was asked to choose between her brother and son. She chose her brother to live. Her reasoning for doing so was that she could have another husband and another son, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> always have but one brother. Darius was impressed by her response and spared both her brother's and her son's life.|$|E

25|$|When visiting {{historical}} sites, she did {{not merely}} accept information given to her by the archaeologists, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> research the sites beforehand, and deeply question experts about the site's restoration and excavation, and the impact on neighbouring people of the archaeologists' operations.|$|E
25|$|Governor Hassan said in 2015 {{that she}} did not favor the death penalty, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> not commute Addison's sentence. Hassan {{announced}} plans in December 2015 to challenge Kelly Ayotte for her US Senate seat; she defeated Ayotte in 2016.|$|E
25|$|The {{demotion}} {{is bound}} to concentrate Dalziel's mind on whether she should run for the Christchurch mayoralty. As things stand, a place for her in a Labour cabinet as minister for the earthquake recovery looks unlikely, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be a strong candidate for mayor.|$|E

25|$|For Zion’s sake, {{the prophet}} would not hold his peace, until Jerusalem’s triumph would burn brightly for the nations to see, and Zion {{would be called}} by a new name given by God. Zion would be a crown of beauty in God’s hand, and no more would she be called Forsaken or Desolate, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be called Delight and Espoused, for God would rejoice over her as a bridegroom over his bride.|$|E
25|$|Catherine was {{stripped}} of her title as queen on 23 November 1541, and imprisoned in the new Syon Abbey, Middlesex, formerly a convent, where she remained throughout the winter of 1541. She was forced by a Privy Councillor to return Anne of Cleves' ring that the King had given her; it {{was a symbol of}} her regal and lawful rights. The King would be at Hampton Court, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> not see him again. Despite these actions taken against her, her marriage to Henry was never formally annulled.|$|E
25|$|Mary's father {{suffered}} a brain injury in 1888 {{and spent the}} remaining 20 {{years of his life}} at Seacliff Mental Hospital. When he died in 1908, his wife Margaret and the children who were still at home moved to a different house in Dunedin, but later on she and her second youngest child, Bill, moved to Christchurch to live at Wharetiki. Margaret Whelan made many spontaneous trips back to Dunedin when she got nostalgic and would stay there for a few weeks at a time, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> otherwise live at Wharetiki {{for the rest of her}} life.|$|E

25|$|The Scott Tournament of Hearts {{would last}} 25 years, {{and saw the}} likes of many great teams. The first Tournament of Hearts was won by Colleen Jones and her Nova Scotia team. It would take her 17 years to win another, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> cap it off with another four championships for {{a grand total of}} six championships. Other great curlers at the Hearts have been Connie Laliberte and Jennifer Jones of Manitoba, Heather Houston, Marilyn Bodogh and Rachel Homan of Ontario, Vera Pezer and Sandra Schmirler of Saskatchewan, Cathy Borst, Shannon Kleibrink and Valerie Sweeting of Alberta and Lindsay Sparkes and Kelly Scott of British Columbia.|$|E
25|$|After his death, Trollope's Autobiography {{appeared}} {{and was a}} best-seller in London. Trollope's downfall {{in the eyes of}} the critics stemmed largely from this volume. Even during his writing career, reviewers tended increasingly to shake their heads over his prodigious output, but when Trollope revealed that he strictly adhered to a daily writing quota, he confirmed his critics' worst fears. The Muse, in their view, might prove immensely prolific, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> never ever follow a schedule. Furthermore, Trollope admitted that he wrote for money; at the same time he called the disdain of money false and foolish. The Muse, claimed the critics, should not be aware of money.|$|E
25|$|Güyük {{died on the}} way, {{in what is now}} Xinjiang, {{at about}} the age of forty-two. Although some modern historians believe that he died of natural causes because of deteriorating health, he may have succumbed to the {{combined}} effects of alcoholism and gout, or he may have been poisoned. William of Rubruck and a Muslim chronicler state that Batu killed the imperial envoy, and one of his brothers murdered the Great Khan Güyük, but these claims are not completely corroborated by other major sources. Güyük's widow Oghul Qaimish took over as regent, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be unable to keep the succession within her branch of the family.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, Nathan-Turner {{was trying}} to figure out what to do about K-9. The robot dog was very popular among {{children}} but was difficult to deal with technically and Nathan-Turner felt that it made the TARDIS crew almost overwhelmingly formidable. He decided that a child-orientated spin-off series with K-9 might be just the thing. However, such a series would require a human as the lead, and his prime candidate for this role was Sladen. He pitched the part to the actress as a departure from what she had previously done: she would be returning as Sarah Jane Smith, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> do so as the heroine and not just a sidekick. This offer Sladen accepted.|$|E
25|$|Elizabeth kept {{a female}} {{companion}} with her {{most of the}} time. This person was not exactly a servant, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> act in that role. She {{would be expected to}} carry things and aid Elizabeth on her daily round. Barbara Schnorrenberg suggests that Sarah Scott was in this function and says that {{there is good reason to}} suggest that she married poorly to escape that situation (Schnorrenberg 723). After Elizabeth's mother died, her father moved to London with his housekeeper, giving no money at all to his children. When Sarah was removed from her bad marriage, Elizabeth's father (whose ward she was) not only gave her no financial help but forbade either Elizabeth or Matthew, her brother, from relieving her distress.|$|E
25|$|In January 2011, {{she reached}} the quarterfinals in the 2011 ASB Classic {{defeating}} Ayumi Morita and Elena Vesnina, but losing to the second seed, Yanina Wickmayer. Halep would go then to the 2011 Moorilla Hobart International <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> lose in the third qualifying round, in a decisive set against Magdaléna Rybáriková. At the 2011 Australian Open, Halep qualified {{for the first time}} in her career in the third round of a tennis Grand Slam on seniors, beating the 24th seed Alisa Kleybanova before losing in straight sets to the 12th seed Agnieszka Radwańska and not progressing to the fourth round. In April at the 2010 Grand Prix SAR La Princesse Lalla Meryem, she repeated her prior year's accomplishment of reaching the finals but lost to Alberta Brianti in straight sets.|$|E
