5|$|As {{professional}} football {{became a national}} television phenomenon, college football did as well. In the 1950s, Notre Dame, which had a large national following, formed its own network to broadcast its games, <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>and</b> large the sport still retained a mostly regional following. In 1952, the NCAA claimed all television broadcasting rights for the games of its member institutions, and it alone negotiated television rights. This situation continued until 1984, when several schools brought a suit under the Sherman Antitrust Act; the Supreme Court ruled against the NCAA and schools are now free to negotiate their own television deals. ABC Sports began broadcasting a national Game of the Week in 1966, bringing key matchups and rivalries to a national audience for the first time.|$|E

Domestic media initially downplayed the riots, but this changed relatively quickly.

According to Miles, the riot police response was tame. Western media speculated that the violence might affect attendance at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>and</b> large it did not.|$|E
25|$|In 1978, {{apart from}} one {{forecourt}} building, the park {{passed to the}} local council as a burial ground and open space subject to the Local Authorities Cemeteries Order of 1977.

500|$|Setting {{the finale}} in several {{different}} time periods was criticized by some critics. Jennifer Armstrong of Entertainment Weekly said [...] "we endure a swirl of confusing, unnecessary sequences, from Grace's dream to current reality to two years later to their kids' first day of college to their kids' impending wedding. By the end, instead of being sad to bid adieu, we're just relieved not to have yet another disbelief-suspending flash-forward thrust upon us." [...] Jim Schembri of The Sydney Morning Herald wrote: [...] "The time-jumping device is overused and a tad awkward <b>but,</b> <b>by</b> <b>and</b> large, it’s a noble finale {{to one of the}} better standard three-wall sitcoms from America." [...] Amy Amatangelo of Zap2it commented that Will & Grace [...] "is a show that spent eight seasons predicated on the lasting friendship of Will and Grace, and we're supposed to believe that they spent over 20 years not talking to each other just because their lives went in different directions? That there is no way their friendship could have been sustained once they both found the love of their life?" [...] Amatangelo enjoyed Jack and Karen's performance of [...] "Unforgettable", {{but the rest of the}} finale she [...] "could have done without." ...|$|E

500|$|Matt Leone of 1UP {{said that}} the {{gameplay}} has [...] "variety... You seemingly see, acquire, and participate in something new around every corner". According to Leone, each weapon [...] "adds a lot of depth to the combat system." [...] Christian Donlan of Eurogamer {{said that the}} [...] "combat system, level flow, and pacing of bosses and puzzles remains largely untouched. But everything's bigger, grander and more elaborate." [...] He praised the weapons' accessibility, {{saying that it is}} easy to quickly switch between them. According to Tom McShea of GameSpot, the combat and scale [...] "have been pushed further than ever before... creating an experience so focused and explosively fun that it's hard to put down, and even harder to forget." [...] McShea said that regardless of repetition, [...] "the brutality of combat {{is one of the most}} satisfying aspects of God of War III." [...] Joe Juba of Game Informer called God of War III [...] "visceral" [...] and [...] "brutal", and Kratos [...] "the undisputed king of the genre." [...] Jackson, however, said the core gameplay's familiarity [...] "makes it feel less than the very, very best", and according to Roper, two of the three additional weapons are similar to the main blades; they [...] "have unique powers and slightly different moves, <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>and</b> large they're more of the same." ...|$|E
500|$|Of Presley's {{films in}} the 1960s, 15 were {{accompanied}} by soundtrack albums and another 5 by soundtrack EPs. The films' rapid production and release schedules—he frequently starred in three a year—affected his music. According to Jerry Leiber, the soundtrack formula was already evident before Presley left for the Army: [...] "three ballads, one medium-tempo , one up-tempo, and one break blues boogie". As the decade wore on, {{the quality of the}} soundtrack songs grew [...] "progressively worse". Julie Parrish, who appeared in Paradise, Hawaiian Style (1966), says that he hated many of the songs chosen for his films. The Jordanaires' Gordon Stoker describes how Presley would retreat from the studio microphone: [...] "The material was so bad that he felt like he couldn't sing it." [...] Most of the film albums featured a song or two from respected writers such as the team of Doc Pomus and Mort Shuman. <b>But</b> <b>by</b> <b>and</b> large, according to biographer Jerry Hopkins, the numbers seemed to be [...] "written on order by men who never really understood Elvis or rock and roll." [...] Regardless of the songs' quality, {{it has been argued that}} Presley generally sang them well, with commitment. Critic Dave Marsh heard the opposite: [...] "Presley isn't trying, probably the wisest course in the face of material like 'No Room to Rumba in a Sports Car' and 'Rock-a-Hula Baby.'" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{series has}} also {{received}} criticism because {{of problems with}} puzzles, weapons, and technical issues. Chains of Olympus was criticized by G4, who stated that the game [...] "occasionally suffers from screen tearing and framerate drops", {{and that some of}} the puzzles [...] "are so maddeningly difficult to solve". The game was also criticized for its lack of variety in enemies, its continued use of puzzles that require players to move boxes, and its relatively short story. God of War III also received some criticism. GameFront's Phil Hornshaw said it had an overly cruel antagonist, and the game assumed that the players reveled in the misery and violence as much as Kratos did. IGN complained about the game's weapons, and said [...] "that two of the three additional weapons that you'll earn are extremely similar to your blades. They have unique powers and slightly different moves, <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>and</b> large, they're more of the same." [...] Ghost of Sparta received criticism from Eurogamer, which said that the [...] "game's primary problem...is in its in-built focus" [...] and [...] that [...] "there is a sense that Ghost of Sparta is a step back for the series if you've played [...]" [...] Some reviewers stated that Ascensionss story was not as compelling as previous installments, with IGN stating that in comparison to Zeus and Ares, [...] "the Furies don’t quite cut it". The multiplayer received a mixed response. Although reviewers claimed gameplay translated well into the multiplayer, they were critical of the balance and depth of combat. Edge magazine approved of the multiplayer, stating it is an [...] "evolutionary step" [...] with [...] "some fine ideas ... that will form part of this genre's future template." ...|$|E

2500|$|Meanwhile, {{the movie}} review of Philbert Ortiz Dy from Click The City states that, [...] "...it manages {{to build a}} fairly {{credible}} story out of the songs. The narrative gets a little loose at times, <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>and</b> large it manages to find the heart of these songs and build something clever out of it...". However, it cited that, [...] "the camerawork is generally uninspiring, the same two or three movements played out over and over. But it manages to delight much more than it disappoints. It sings heartily, offering audiences a sense of joy and fun often missing from our cinema." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Raja of Bobbili {{became the}} Chief Minister on 5 November 1932 {{at the age}} of 31 and except for a short span of [...] 4 months when he was on a trip to England, served as Chief Minister until 1 April 1937. [...] During his tenure, Madras was in the grips of the Great Depression. The Raja did {{introduce}} some measures in order to relieve the burden on the poor peasant. <b>But</b> <b>by</b> <b>and</b> large, the rapid depreciation of the economy remained unchecked and the government showed little concern towards the plight of the poor peasant. The Justice Party lost badly in the 1937 elections. The Raja's policies are believed to be the main reason.|$|E
2500|$|Speaking {{generally}} on {{operations in}} Afghanistan, Stirrup {{has noted that}} whilst [...] "the military is a key, an essential element in dealing with those problems, <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>and</b> large these problems can only be resolved politically" [...] and that he favoured a pragmatic {{approach to dealing with}} former members of the Taliban. By December 2009, Stirrup was expressing his concern about falling levels of public support for the war in Afghanistan which he believed risked undermining the British effort. [...] In particular Stirrup called for a spirit of resolution and [...] stated that the mission was achievable, noting that the British Armed Forces had finally now got a properly resourced plan to achieve the strategic aim.|$|E

In a February 2009 interview, {{he said of the}} Tamil Eelam struggle: [...] "Parts of Europe, for example, are moving towards more federal arrangements. In Spain, for example, Catalonia by now has a high degree of autonomy within the Spanish state. The Basque Country also has a high degree of autonomy. In England, Wales and Scotland in the United Kingdom are moving towards a form of autonomy and self-determination and I think there are similar developments throughout Europe. Though [...] they're mixed with a lot of pros and cons, <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>and</b> large I think it is a generally healthy development. I mean, the people have different interests, different cultural backgrounds, different concerns, and there should be special arrangements to allow them to pursue their special interests and concerns in harmony with others." ...|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the most}} often criticised points of C++ is its {{enormous}} complexity as a language, {{the large number of}} non-orthogonal features. This in practice necessitates restricting code to subset of C++, thus eschewing the readability benefits of common style and idioms. As expressed by Joshua Bloch: [...] I think C++ was pushed well beyond its complexity threshold and yet {{there are a lot of}} people programming it. But what you do is you force people to subset it. So almost every shop that I know of that uses C++ says, “Yes, we’re using C++ but we’re not doing multiple-implementation inheritance and we’re not using operator overloading.” There are just a bunch of features that you’re not going to use because the complexity of the resulting code is too high. And I don’t think it’s good when you have to start doing that. You lose this programmer portability where everyone can read everyone else’s code, which I think is such a good thing. [...] Ken Thompson comments on how that came to be: [...] It certainly has its good points. <b>But</b> <b>by</b> <b>and</b> large I think it’s a bad language. It does a lot of things half well and it’s just a garbage heap of ideas that are mutually exclusive. Everybody I know, whether it’s personal or corporate, selects a subset and these subsets are different. So it’s not a good language to transport an algorithm—to say, “I wrote it; here, take it.” It’s way too big, way too complex. And it’s obviously built by a committee.|$|E
