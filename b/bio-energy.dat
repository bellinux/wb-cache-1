5|$|With Alden on {{a murderous}} rampage towards the Historic District, Cole defeats him {{once and for}} all in a bridge battle. Before jumping in the water, Alden reveals that Kessler exiled him from the First Sons. White, who turns out to be an NSA agent with no {{connection}} to Moya, reaches out to Cole and explains that the Ray Sphere is designed to consume <b>bio-energy</b> from thousands of lives and transfer it to a single user, making them a Conduit. During their search for the Sphere, Kessler publicly challenges Cole to stop a series of bombings across the district, ending with him being forced to choose between saving Trish or her colleagues. Regardless of which choice he makes, Cole fails to keep Trish from dying. Determined to punish Kessler, Cole tracks the Sphere to a remote pier, where he must decide whether to destroy it or use it to become even more powerful. Regardless, the Sphere releases the last of its energy, killing John before disappearing into a vortex.|$|E

They awarded this grant to 24 renewable energy projects at the University in August 2006, including CBS.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{technologies}} remove greenhouse gases emissions from the atmosphere. Most widely analysed {{are those that}} remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, either to geologic formations such as <b>bio-energy</b> with {{carbon capture and storage}} and carbon dioxide air capture, or to the soil as in the case with biochar. The IPCC has pointed out that many long-term climate scenario models require large-scale manmade negative emissions to avoid serious climate change.|$|E
25|$|Tree {{metabolic}} energy harvesting {{is a type}} of <b>bio-energy</b> harvesting. Voltree has developed a method for harvesting energy from trees. These energy harvesters are being used to power remote sensors and mesh networks as the basis for a long term deployment system to monitor forest fires and weather in the forest. Their website says that the useful life of such a device should be limited only by the lifetime of the tree to which it is attached. They recently deployed a small test network in a US National Park forest.|$|E
25|$|Biochar (charcoal {{created by}} {{pyrolysis}} of biomass) {{is a potent}} form of longterm (thousands of years) biosequestration of atmosphereic CO2 derived from investigation of the extremely fertile Terra preta soils of the Amazon Basin. Placing biochar in soils also improves water quality, increases soil fertility, raises agricultural productivity and reduce pressure on old growth forests. As a method of generating <b>bio-energy</b> with carbon storage Rob Flanagan and the EPRIDA biochar company have developed low-tech cooking stoves for developing nations that can burn agricultural wastes such as rice husks and produce 15% by weight of biochar; while BEST Energies in NSW Australia have spent a decade developing an Agrichar technology that can combust 96 tonnes of dry biomass each day, generating 30-40 tonnes of biochar. A parametric study of biosequestration by Malcolm Fowles at the Open University, indicated that to mitigate global warming, policies should encourage displacement of coal with biomass as a power source for baseload electricity generation if the latter’s conversion efficiency rose over 30%, otherwise biosequestering carbon from biomass as a cheaper mitigation option than geosequestration by CO2 capture and storage.|$|E

2500|$|Almost all {{research}} into {{solar radiation management}} has consisted of computer modelling or laboratory tests, and an attempt to move to outdoor experimentation was controversial. [...] Some carbon dioxide removal practices, such as planting of trees and <b>bio-energy</b> with {{carbon capture and storage}} projects, are underway. Their scalability to effectively affect global climate is, however, debated. Ocean iron fertilization has been investigated in small-scale research trials. The World Wildlife Fund has criticized these activities.|$|E
2500|$|James E. Hansen argues that, [...] "An {{effective}} way to achieve drawdown [...] would be to burn biofuels in power plants and capture the CO2, with the biofuels derived from agricultural or urban wastes or grown on degraded lands using little or no fossil fuel inputs." [...] Such CO2 drawdown systems {{are referred to as}} <b>Bio-energy</b> with carbon capture and storage, or BECCS. According to a study by Biorecro and the Global CCS Institute, there is currently (as of January 2012) 550 000 tonnes /year in total BECCS capacity operating, divided between three different facilities.|$|E
2500|$|Wide-scale {{adoption}} of CCS may erase efficiency gains in coal power plants {{of the last}} 50 years, and increase resource consumption by one third. Even taking the fuel penalty into account, however, overall levels of [...] abatement would remain high at approximately 80–90%, compared to a plant without CCS. It is possible for CCS, when combined with biomass, to result in net negative emissions. Though, all of the currently (as of Feb 2011) operational BECCS (<b>Bio-energy</b> with carbon capture and storage) plants operate on point emissions other than power stations, such as biofuel refineries.|$|E

In addition out of his discourses on the Vigyan Bhiarav (or Vijnaya-bhairava), the 112 practices for enlightenment resulted in the much longer The Book of Secrets. His students continue to develop his concepts.|$|E
2500|$|Due to its ethanol fuel production, Brazil has {{sometimes}} {{been described as a}} <b>bio-energy</b> superpower. Ethanol fuel is produced from sugar cane. Brazil has the largest sugar cane crop in the world, and is the largest exporter of ethanol in the world. [...] With the 1973 oil crisis, the Brazilian government initiated in 1975 the Pró-Álcool program. The Pró-Álcool or Programa Nacional do Álcool (National Alcohol Program) was a nationwide program financed by the government to phase out all automobile fuels derived from fossil fuels [...] in favour of ethanol. The program successfully reduced by 10 million the number of cars running on gasoline in Brazil, thereby reducing the country's dependence on oil imports.|$|E
2500|$|A crucial {{issue for}} CDR methods is their cost, which differs {{substantially}} {{among the different}} technologies: {{some of these are}} not sufficiently developed to perform cost assessments.

It also seeks to enroll in a sustainable development project, in the image of the department with, among other projects, the construction of a cogeneration plant and the establishment of a network of heat. The timber industry, so important in the economy of the city, could therefore be put to further use. The establishment of <b>bio-energy</b> in the city has also been carried out by the appearance of a wind farm north of the city.|$|E
2500|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} in a hypothetical renewable energy dominated energy system to use the excess electricity generated by wind, solar photovoltaic, hydro, marine currents and others to produce hydrogen by electrolysis of water then combine it with CO2 make methane (natural gas). [...] Hydrogen would firstly be used onsite in fuel cells (CHP) or for transportation due to its greater efficiency of production and then methane created which could then be injected into the existing gas network to generate electricity and heat on demand to overcome low points of renewable energy production. [...] The process described would be to create hydrogen (which could partly be used directly in fuel cells) {{and the addition of}} carbon dioxide CO2 possibly from BECCS (<b>Bio-Energy</b> with Carbon Capture & Storage [...] ) via the (Sabatier reaction) to create methane as follows : ...|$|E
2500|$|Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) {{refers to}} a number of technologies, the {{objective}} of which is the large-scale removal of carbon dioxide [...] from the atmosphere. Among such technologies are <b>bio-energy</b> with carbon capture and storage, biochar, ocean fertilization, enhanced weathering, and direct air capture when combined with storage. CDR is a different approach than removing CO2 from the stack emissions of large fossil fuel point sources, such as power stations. The latter reduces emission to the atmosphere but cannot reduce the amount of carbon dioxide already in the atmosphere. As CDR removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, it creates negative emissions, offsetting emissions from small and dispersed point sources such as domestic heating systems, airplanes and vehicle exhausts. [...] It is regarded by some as a form of climate engineering, while other commentators describe it as a form of carbon capture and storage or extreme mitigation. Whether CDR would satisfy common definitions of [...] "climate engineering" [...] or [...] "geoengineering" [...] usually depends upon the scale on which it would be undertaken.|$|E
