25|$|The consumer's preferences, {{monetary}} income and prices {{play an important}} role in solving the consumer's optimization problem (choosing how much of various goods to consume so as to maximize their utility subject to a <b>budget</b> <b>constraint).</b> The comparative statics of consumer behavior investigates the effects of changes in the exogenous or independent variables (especially prices and money incomes of the consumers) on the chosen values of the endogenous or dependent variables (the consumer's demands for the goods). When the income of the consumer rises with the prices held constant, the optimal bundle chosen by the consumer changes as the feasible set available to him changes. The income–consumption curve is the set of tangency points of indifference curves with the various <b>budget</b> <b>constraint</b> lines, with prices held constant, as income increases shifting the <b>budget</b> <b>constraint</b> out.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{identifies}} {{five factors}} affecting {{the degree of}} softness or hardness of <b>budget</b> <b>constraints</b> of enterprises in China. <b>Budget</b> <b>constraints</b> become harder: (1) under fiscal decentralization and competition between regions; (2) under more competitive labor and product markets reducing employment rents; (3) {{when there is a}} smaller number of enterprises within each jurisdiction. On the other hand, <b>budget</b> <b>constraints</b> become softer: (1) under monetary decentralization; (2) when enterprises have a larger size and social costs of layoffs are convex.

Such forbearance lending may induce soft <b>budget</b> <b>constraints</b> for the debtors, as it diminishes their incentives to thwart default.

25|$|Frequently the {{marginal}} change {{is assumed to}} start from the endowment, meaning the total resources available for consumption (see <b>Budget</b> <b>constraint).</b> This endowment is determined by many things including physical laws (which constrain how forms of energy and matter may be transformed), accidents of nature (which determine the presence of natural resources), and the outcomes of past decisions made by the individual himself or herself and by others.|$|E
25|$|This can be {{illustrated}} with a diagram. Initially the consumer has {{the choice between}} spending their income on either commodity Y or commodity X as defined by line segment MN (where M = total available income divided by the price of commodity Y, and N = total available income divided by the price of commodity X).

25|$|In economics, many {{problems}} involve multiple objectives along with constraints on what combinations of those objectives are attainable. For example, consumer's demand for various goods {{is determined by}} the process of maximization of the utilities derived from those goods, subject to a constraint based on how much income is available to spend on those goods and on the prices of those goods. This constraint allows more of one good to be purchased only at the sacrifice of consuming less of another good; therefore, the various objectives (more consumption of each good is preferred) are in conflict with each other. A common method for analyzing such a problem is to use a graph of indifference curves, representing preferences, and a <b>budget</b> <b>constraint,</b> representing the trade-offs that the consumer is faced with.|$|E
40|$|Risk based audit (RBA) {{approaches}} {{represent a}} major trend in current audit methodology. The approach {{is based on}} risk analysis used to identify business strategy risk. The RBA {{has created a new}} set of research issues that need investigation. In particular, this approach has important implications for risk identification and risk assessment. The success of the RBA approach is contingent on understanding what factors improve or interfere with the accuracy of these risk judgments. I examine how <b>budget</b> <b>constraints</b> and decision aid use affect risk identification and risk assessment. Unlike previous budget pressure studies, I cast <b>budget</b> <b>constraints</b> as a positive influence on auditors. I expect more stringent <b>budget</b> <b>constraints</b> to be motivating to the auditor as they provide a goal for the auditor to achieve. I also expect <b>budget</b> <b>constraints</b> to induce feelings of pressure leading to the use of time-pressure adaptation strategies. When auditors have use of a decision aid, they take advantage of these motivational goals and/or use beneficial adaptive strategies. Overall, I find that auditor participants tend to be more accurate when identifying financial statement risks compared to business risks. <b>Budget</b> <b>constraints</b> have no effect on risk identification for financial or business risks; they also have no effect on financial risk assessments. On the other hand, business risk assessments are improved by implementing more stringent <b>budget</b> <b>constraints,</b> but only when a decision aid is also provided. <b>Budget</b> <b>constraints</b> can affect performance through a goal theory route or a time-pressure adaptation route. I investigate the paths through which <b>budget</b> <b>constraints</b> improve business risk assessments under decision aid use. I find that <b>budget</b> <b>constraints</b> directly affect performance, supporting a goal theory route. However, I do not find that <b>budget</b> <b>constraints</b> are mediated by perceived budget pressure as expected. Auditors appear to use a positive adaptive strategy to respond to perceived budget pressure, however perceived budget pressure is not induced by providing a more stringent budget...|$|R

40|$|Several {{theoretical}} {{explanations for}} the presence of soft <b>budget</b> <b>constraints</b> have recently been put forward in the literature. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to empirically test these theories on the causes of soft <b>budget</b> <b>constraints.</b> We therefore use a panel data set, consisting of company account data for Bulgarian and Romanian manufacturing firms, covering the period 1996 - 1990. Our results suggest that the probability of finding soft <b>budget</b> <b>constraints</b> importantly depends on the degree of competition within the sector and on the ownership of the firm. Ownership structure in Bulgaria however, has no additional explanatory power once firms are loss-making. We further find that socio-political concerns about employment increase the probability of SBC's, but only when firms are loss-making. Thus, our empirical results largely confirm the hypotheses that competition, privatisation and firm size matter in explaining soft <b>budget</b> <b>constraints,</b> as suggested in the theoretical models on the causes of soft <b>budget</b> <b>constraints...</b>|$|R

2500|$|A price drop for {{commodity}} X causes two effects. The {{reduced price}} alters relative prices {{in favour of}} commodity X, known as the substitution effect. This is illustrated by a movement down the indifference curve from point A to point B (a pivot of the <b>budget</b> <b>constraint</b> about the original indifference curve). At the same time, the price reduction increases consumer purchasing power, known as the income effect (an outward shift of the <b>budget</b> <b>constraint).</b> This {{is illustrated by the}} shifting out of the dotted line to MP (where P = income divided by the new price of commodity X). The substitution effect (point A to point B) raises the quantity demanded of commodity X from Xa to Xb while the income effect lowers the quantity demanded from Xb to Xc. The net effect is a reduction in quantity demanded from Xa to Xc making commodity X a Giffen good by definition. Any good where the income effect more than compensates for the substitution effect is a [...] Giffen good.|$|E
2500|$|The {{substitution}} effect {{is the change}} in demands resulting from a price change that alters {{the slope of the}} <b>budget</b> <b>constraint</b> but leaves the consumer on the same indifference curve. In other words, it illustrates the consumer's new consumption basket after the price change while being compensated as to allow the consumer to be as happy as he or she was previously. By this effect, the consumer is posited to substitute toward the good that becomes comparatively less expensive. In the illustration below this corresponds to an imaginary <b>budget</b> <b>constraint</b> denoted SC being tangent to the indifference curve I1. Then the income effect from the rise in purchasing power from a price fall reinforces the {{substitution effect}}. [...] If the good is an inferior good, then the income effect will offset in some degree the substitution effect. [...] If the income effect for an inferior good is sufficiently strong, the consumer will buy less of the good when it becomes less expensive, a Giffen good (commonly believed to be a rarity).|$|E
