5|$|At 17:00 on 3 May, Fletcher was {{notified}} that the Japanese Tulagi invasion force had been sighted {{the day before}} approaching the southern Solomons. Unable {{to communicate with the}} Lexington task force <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> to maintain radio silence, Yorktowns task force proceeded independently toward Guadalcanal in order to be in position to launch airstrikes against the Japanese forces at Tulagi the next morning.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, federal {{prosecutors}} such as Eugene Reese attempted to prosecute responsible parties under federal laws against debt peonage. But such efforts received little support nationally and {{none in the}} South, which had disenfranchised most blacks to exclude them from the political system. Northern attention was focused on immigration and World War I. The convict lease system finally ended {{with the advent of}} World War II. National and presidential attention was focused on racial issues <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for national unity and mobilization of the military.|$|E
5|$|With {{modifications}} {{that were}} aimed at improving the ships endurance by including a diesel generator, it was launched as Velebit (P-01) in 1996. A few years later {{it was out of}} service <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> to acquire a new set of batteries, which in turn, never happened. After unsuccessful attempts of selling it to a foreign buyer, it was offered to various museums in Croatia with a final destination still pending.|$|E

40|$|This {{survey of}} {{information}} was initiated and compiled <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> remote sensing interpreters to identify crops {{throughout the year}} on various types of remote sensing imagery. A fairly comprehensive guide to what crops grow in a county and the specific cropping practices has been developed...|$|R
5|$|Within {{the living}} quarters, the {{atmosphere}} resembled {{that of a}} college dormitory. Housekeeping and laundry services were provided, but the quarters were small and little entertainment was available. Television broadcasts were delayed two days <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> to fly tapes from California, and most workers had {{to develop their own}} forms of entertainment. In the winter, some took to skiing or sightseeing; in the summer, some went hiking. In general, however, little time was available for recreation because of the long hours worked by most people.|$|E
5|$|A severe {{fire at the}} Grand Central {{station on}} April 21, 1964, {{destroyed}} the demonstration train and manual operation had been restored since. The fire began under a shuttle train on track 3, and it became larger, feeding on the wooden platform. The train on Track 1 was saved when the motorman saw smoke, and reversed the train. The basements of nearby buildings were damaged. Tracks 1 and 4 returned to service on April 23, 1964, while Track 3 returned to service on June 1, 1964. The reinstallation of Track 3 was delayed <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> to replace 60 beams that were damaged in the fire. Initially, a decision was not made concerning {{whether or not the}} automated shuttle train should be reintroduced.|$|E
5|$|<b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> {{to defend}} against these incursions, the Byzantines {{could not afford to}} use all their forces against the Persians. Heraclius sent an envoy to the Avar Khagan, saying that the Byzantines would pay a tribute in return for the Avars to {{withdraw}} north of the Danube. The Khagan replied by asking for a meeting on 5 June 623, at Heraclea in Thrace, where the Avar army was located; Heraclius agreed to this meeting, coming with his royal court. The Khagan, however, put horsemen en route to Heraclea to ambush and capture Heraclius, so they could hold him for ransom.|$|E
30|$|Recently, {{differential}} equations with impulses are great interest <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> modern technology, where impulsive automatic control systems and impulsive computing systems {{are very important}} and intensively develop broadening <b>the</b> scope <b>of</b> their applications in technical problems, heterogeneous by their physical nature and functional purpose (see [10,chapter 1]).|$|R

On June 22, 2011, Hutchison told Chris Matthews on Hardball with Chris Matthews that she had pondered running for president, but said she could not run in <b>the</b> 2012 {{election}} <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> her two 10-year-old children.|$|R
50|$|Arlette is <b>the</b> {{youngest}} <b>of</b> three siblings {{born into}} a modest family which came to Charleville <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war. After attending the Lycée Hélène Boucher in Paris, she studied to become a juge des enfants, a magistrate specialised in juvenile law, then changed her focus to take an advanced diploma (DEA) in legal and institutional history. With no post available, she left France in 1969 to do her thesis at Cornell University where she was witnessed <b>the</b> activism <b>of</b> African-American students during the Civil Rights Movement and American feminists.|$|R
5|$|The {{fall line}} is the geomorphologic break between the upland region of {{relatively}} hard crystalline basement rock and the coastal plain of softer sedimentary rock. The fall line is most prominent when crossed by a river. It {{is at this point}} that cities developed, because riverboats could not typically travel any farther inland without portaging. In some locations, the rapid change in elevation of the water, and the resulting energy release, made the fall line a good location for water mills, grist mills, and sawmills. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for a river port leading to the ocean, and a ready supply of water power, settlements developed where rivers crossed the fall line. In Georgia, the Fall Line extends from Augusta, through Macon, and on to Columbus.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} plan for Tvrđa was drafted <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> {{to reinforce the}} town walls, but did not include provisions to redesign the interior and envisaged largely uncontrolled development. New plans for a fort on the right bank of the River Drava were drawn up by Maximilian Gosseau de Henef. Gosseau took over planning of the fort when construction was already under way. Starting in August 1712, Austrian engineers, supervised by the fort's commander, General Johann Stephan von Beckers, built barracks, staff headquarters, churches and monasteries, surrounded by system of moats, bastions and gun positions, respecting Gosseau's design. The design followed the model of lowland Dutch military fortifications of the period.|$|E
5|$|The ship {{found so}} many bodies that the {{embalming}} supplies aboard were quickly exhausted. Health regulations permitted that only embalmed bodies could {{be returned to}} port. Captain Larnder of the Mackay-Bennett and the undertakers aboard decided to preserve all bodies of First Class passengers <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> to visually identify wealthy men to resolve any disputes over large estates. As a result, {{the majority of the}} burials at sea were third class passengers and crew. Larnder himself claimed that as a mariner, he would expect to be buried at sea. However complaints about the burials at sea were made by families and undertakers. Later ships such as Minia found fewer bodies, requiring fewer embalming supplies, and were able to limit burials at sea to bodies which were too damaged to preserve.|$|E
50|$|<b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> great <b>need</b> for a {{revision}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> blackbook, John Singreen revised {{it and the}} new blackbook was issued in February 1935. Brother Singreen also compiled the National Directory in 1932.|$|R
50|$|At {{a conference}} on children's literature, one {{respondent}} suggested that the novel was realistic rather than fantasy <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> novel form for older children, {{and that this is}} less successful than the earlier book. Storr's response was:Perhaps this didn't come off as well. … I wrote that because I'd always wanted to write on the Macbeth theme - if you are told that something {{is going to happen to}} you, you make it happen. That was what the book was supposed to be about and there is a very good example of using fantasy.|$|R
40|$|Warm dense {{matter is}} the region in phase space of density and {{temperature}} where the thermal, Fermi, and Coulomb energies are approximately equal. <b>The</b> lack <b>of</b> a dominating scale and physical behavior makes it challenging to model the physics to high fidelity. For Sandia, a fundamental understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> region is <b>of</b> importance <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> our experimental HEDP programs for high fidelity descriptive and predictive modeling. We show that multi-scale simulations of macroscopic physical phenomena now have predictive capability also for difficult but ubiquitous materials such as stainless steel, a transition metal alloy...|$|R
5|$|The {{superclass}} Tetrapoda {{is divided}} into four classes of vertebrate animals with four limbs. Reptiles, birds and mammals are amniotes, the eggs of which are either laid or carried by the female and are surrounded by several membranes, {{some of which are}} impervious. Lacking these membranes, amphibians require water bodies for reproduction, although some species have developed various strategies for protecting or bypassing the vulnerable aquatic larval stage. They are not found in the sea {{with the exception of one}} or two frogs that live in brackish water in mangrove swamps. On land, amphibians are restricted to moist habitats <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> to keep their skin damp.|$|E
5|$|While Governor Pataki {{supported}} this revised, $1.5 billion people mover plan, Mayor Rudy Giuliani voiced his opposition {{over the fact}} that it was not a direct rail link from Manhattan, and thus would not be profitable <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> to transfer from Jamaica. Additionally, Giuliani did not like that the city had to effectively pay $300 million toward the new light rail system. The Port Authority was originally planning to pay for only $1.2 billion of the project, with the other $300 million to be used to pay the rent at the airport instead. In order to give his agreement, Giuliani wanted the Port Authority to study the possibility of extending the Astoria elevated to LaGuardia Airport, as well as make the light-rail system compatible with the subway or LIRR to allow possible future interoperability. In late 1997, Giuliani agreed to the plan under the condition that the state reimburse the city $300 million of the system's cost, with the city paying the $300 million for the line from 2002 through 2017. As part of the agreement, the state would also conduct a study on a similar train link to LaGuardia Airport.|$|E

30|$|When a {{dynamical}} system processes aftereffect {{and state}} changing by jumps, {{this system is}} called an impulsive differential system. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> modern technology, such as simulation in physics, biology, populations dynamics, control theory, industrial robotics, etc., <b>the</b> study <b>of</b> impulsive differential equations attracts more and more researchers' interest, see [1 – 8]. There are many articles [9 – 16] about existence of solutions, periodic solutions and stability for impulsive differential equations. But, only a few articles [17, 18] have studied <b>the</b> existence <b>of</b> almost periodic solutions to abstract impulsive differential equations in Banach space.|$|R

40|$|<b>The</b> {{assumption}} <b>of</b> {{a single}} price {{at any time}} is very generally imposed on market theorizing. It is unrealistic, but generally accepted <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> welfare theory, and of current theoretical methods. In order to evaluate <b>the</b> significance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> loss in realism from <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> this assumption, {{it seems to be}} worthwhile to start with <b>the</b> other extreme <b>of</b> complete ignorance in a market, and allow buyers and sellers to pair off at random, allowing a diversity of prices. It is very interesting that in such a "blind market" the quantity traded tends to be larger, by about 44 per cent. ...|$|R
