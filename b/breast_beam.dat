40|$|Purpose: A {{method is}} {{presented}} to radiobiologically compare sequential (SEQ) and simultaneously integrated boost (SIB) breast radiotherapy. Methods: The method is based on identically prescribed biologically effective dose (iso-BED) which was achieved by different prescribed doses due to different fractionation schemes. It is performed by converting the calculated three-dimensional dose distribution to the corresponding BED distribution taking into consideration the different number of fractions for generic α/β ratios. A cumulative BED volume histogram (BEDVH) is then derived from the BED distribution and is compared for the two delivery schemes. Ten breast cancer patients (4 right-sided and 6 left-sided) were investigated. Two tangential intensity modulated whole <b>breast</b> <b>beams</b> with two other oblique (with different gantry angles) beams for the boost volume were used. The boost and the breast target volumes with either α/β[*]=[*] 10 or 3  Gy, and ipsi-lateral and contra-lateral lungs, heart, and contra-lateral breast as organs at risk (OARs) with α/β[*]=[*] 3  Gy were compared. Results: Based on the BEDVH comparisons, the use of SIB reduced the biological breast mean dose by about 3 %, the ipsi-lateral lung and heart by about 10 %, and contra-lateral breast and lung by about 7 %. Conclusion: BED based comparisons should always be used in comparing plans that have different fraction sizes. SIB schemes are dosimetrically more advantageous than SEQ in breast target volume and OARs for equal prescribed BEDs for breast and boost...|$|R

40|$|Tabitha Y Chan, Poh Wee Tan, Johann I Tang Department of Radiation Oncology, National University Cancer Institute, Singapore, Singapore Abstract: Whole <b>breast</b> {{external}} <b>beam</b> radiotherapy (WBEBRT) {{is commonly}} used as an essential arm in the treatment management of women with early-stage breast cancer. Dosimetry planning for conventional WBEBRT typically involves a pair of tangential fields. Advancement in radiation technology and techniques {{has the potential to}} improve treatment outcomes with clinically meaningful long-term benefits. However, this advancement must be balanced with safety and improved efficacy. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is an advanced technique that shows promise in improving the planning process and radiation delivery. Early data on utilizing IMRT for WBEBRT demonstrate more homogenous dose distribution with reduction in organs at risk doses. This translates to toxicities reduction. The two common descriptors for IMRT are forward-planning “fields in field” and inverse planning. Unlike IMRT for other organs, the aim of IMRT for breast planning is to achieve dose homogeneity and not organ conformality. The aim of this paper was to evaluate whether IMRT is ready for prime time based on these three points: 1) workload impact, 2) the clinical impact on the patient’s quality of life, and 3) the appropriateness and applicability to clinical practice.

40|$|Abstract Purpose To {{assess the}} {{radiation}} dose {{delivered to the}} heart and ipsilateral lung during accelerated partial breast brachytherapy using a MammoSite™ applicator and compare to those produced by whole <b>breast</b> external <b>beam</b> radiotherapy (WBRT). Materials and methods Dosimetric analysis was conducted on patients receiving MammoSite breast brachytherapy following conservative surgery for invasive ductal carcinoma. Cardiac dose was evaluated for patients with left breast tumors with a CT scan encompassing the entire heart. Lung dose was evaluated for patients in whom the entire lung was scanned. The prescription dose of 3400 cGy was 1 cm from the balloon surface. MammoSite dosimetry was compared to simulated WBRT fields with and without radiobiological correction {{for the effects of}} dose and fractionation. Dose parameters such as the volume of the structure receiving 10 Gy or more (V 10) and the dose received by 20 cc of the structure (D 20), were calculated as well as the maximum and mean doses received. Results Fifteen patients were studied, five had complete lung data and six had left-sided tumors with complete cardiac data. Ipsilateral lung volumes ranged from 925 – 1380 cc. Cardiac volumes ranged from 337 – 551 cc. MammoSite resulted in a significantly lower percentage lung V 30 and lung and cardiac V 20 than the WBRT fields, with and without radiobiological correction. Conclusion This study gives low values for incidental radiation received by the heart and ipsilateral lung using the MammoSite applicator. The volume of heart and lung irradiated to clinically significant levels was significantly lower with the MammoSite applicator than using simulated WBRT fields of the same CT data sets.

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{image quality}} of {{dedicated}} cone <b>beam</b> <b>breast</b> CT (CBBCT) {{is limited by}} substantial scatter contamination, resulting in cupping artifacts and contrast-loss in reconstructed images. Such effects obscure the visibility of soft-tissue lesions and calcifications, which hinders breast cancer detection and diagnosis. In this work, we propose a library-based software approach to suppress scatter on CBBCT images with high efficiency, accuracy, and reliability. METHODS: The authors precompute a scatter library on simplified breast models with different sizes using the geant 4 -based Monte Carlo (MC) toolkit. The breast is approximated as a semiellipsoid with homogeneous glandular/adipose tissue mixture. For scatter correction on real clinical data, the authors estimate the breast size from a first-pass breast CT reconstruction and then select the corresponding scatter distribution from the library. The selected scatter distribution from simplified breast models is spatially translated to match the projection data from the clinical scan and is subtracted from the measured projection for effective scatter correction.

40|$|Purpose: To assess dose {{received}} by the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery during interstitial pulsed-dose-rate brachytherapy (PDR-BT) boost for left-sided breast cancer patients undergoing organ-sparing treatment. Material and methods : Thirty consecutive pT 1 - 3 N 0 - 1 M 0 breast cancer patients boosted between 2014 and 2015 with 10 Gy/ 10 pulses/hour PDR-BT following a computed tomography (CT) simulation with the multi-catheter implant were included. The most common localization of primary tumor were upper quadrants. Patients were implanted with rigid tubes following breast conserving surgery and whole <b>breast</b> external <b>beam</b> irradiation (40 Gy/ 15 or 50 Gy/ 25 fractions). Computed tomography scans were retrospectively reviewed and LADs were contoured without and with margin of 5 mm (LAD 5 mm). Standard treatment plan encompassed tumor bed determined by the surgical clips with margin of 2 cm. Dosimetric parameters were extracted from the dose-volume histograms. Results : The mean D 90 and V 100 were 10. 3 Gy (range: 6. 6 - 13. 3), and 42. 0 cc (range: 15. 3 - 109. 3), respectively. The median dose non-uniformity ratio (DNR) was 0. 50 (range: 0. 27 - 0. 82). The mean doses to LAD and LAD 5 mm were 1. 0 Gy and 0. 96 Gy, and maximal doses were 1. 57 Gy and 1. 99 Gy, respectively.

CBBCT featured with circular scan might be the most desirable mode in breast imaging due to its simple geometrical configuration and potential applications in functional imaging. An inherited large cone angle in CBBCT, however, will yield artifacts in the reconstruction images when only a single circular scan is employed. These artifacts usually manifest themselves as density drop and object geometrical distortion that are more noticeable in the reconstructed image areas that are further away from the circular scanning plane. In order to combat this drawback, a circle plus partial helical scan scheme is proposed. An exact circle plus straight line scan scheme is also conducted in computer simulation for the purpose of comparison.

40|$|Purpose : To {{evaluate}} peri-operative multicatheter interstitial pulsed-dose-rate brachytherapy (PDR-BT) with an intra-operative catheter placement {{to boost}} the tumor excision site in breast cancer patients treated conservatively. Material and methods: Between May 2002 and October 2008, 96 consecutive T 1 - 3 N 0 - 2 M 0 breast cancer patients underwent breast-conserving therapy (BCT) including peri-operative PDR-BT boost, followed by whole <b>breast</b> external <b>beam</b> radiotherapy (WBRT). The BT dose of 15 Gy (1 Gy/pulse/h) was given {{on the following day}} after surgery. Results: No increased bleeding or delayed wound healing related to the implants were observed. The only side effects included one case of temporary peri-operative breast infection and 3 cases of fat necrosis, both early and late. In 11 patients (11. 4 %), subsequent WBRT was omitted owing to the final pathology findings. These included eight patients who underwent mastectomy due to multiple adverse prognostic pathological features, one case of lobular carcinoma in situ, and two cases with no malignant tumor. With a median follow-up of 12 years (range: 7 - 14 years), among 85 patients who completed BCT, there was one ipsilateral breast tumor and one locoregional nodal recurrence. Six patients developed distant metastases and one was diagnosed with angiosarcoma within irradiated breast. The actuarial 5 - and 10 -year disease free survival was 90 % (95 % CI: 84 - 96 %) and 87 % (95 % CI: 80 - 94 %), respectively, for the patients with invasive breast cancer, and 91 % (95 % CI: 84 - 97 %) and 89 % (95 % CI: 82 - 96 %), respectively, for patients who completed BCT. Good cosmetic outcome by self-assessment was achieved in 58 out of 64 (91 %) evaluable patients. Conclusions : Peri-operative PDR-BT boost with intra-operative tube placement followed by EBRT is feasible and devoid of considerable toxicity, and provides excellent long-term local control. However, this strategy necessitates careful patient selection and histological confirmation of primary diagnosis...|$|R
40|$|The {{coherent}} and monochromatic x-ray beams {{available at the}} synchrotron radiation (SR) laboratories are ideal tools for the development and the initial application of new imaging techniques. In the present paper {{the history of the}} clinical studies in k-edge subtraction imaging with SR is summarized, including coronary angiography and bronchography. The results of the recent trial in phase-contrast mammography at Elettra (Trieste, Italy) are discussed, in order to assess the clinical impact of the new imaging modality and the potential interest in its translation to clinical practice. The direct measurement of linear attenuation coefficient obtained during the SR mammography trial is also discussed. The new program of phase-contrast breast CT under development at Elettra is presented. Recently, 3 D breast imaging (tomosynthesis and cone <b>beam</b> <b>breast</b> CT) has been introduced in clinical practice with significant improvement in diagnostic accuracy. The aim of this research is to study the contribution of the phase-contrast to the image quality of breast CT, is introduced. Increasing the image quality of the x-ray medical images {{at the level of the}} results obtained at the SR laboratories is highly desirable, hence the promising techniques for the translation of the phase-contrast imaging to the hospitals are briefly discussed...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to {{characterize}} the image quality of our dedicated, quasi-monochromatic spectrum, cone <b>beam</b> <b>breast</b> imaging system under scatter corrected and non-scatter corrected conditions for a variety of breast compositions. CT projections were acquired of a breast phantom containing two concentric sets of acrylic spheres that varied in size (1 - 8 mm) based on their polar position. The breast phantom was filled with 3 different concentrations of methanol and water, simulating a range of breast densities (0. 79 - 1. 0 g/cc); acrylic yarn was sometimes included to simulate connective tissue of a breast. For each phantom condition, 2 D scatter was measured for all projection angles. Scatter-corrected and uncorrected projections were then reconstructed with an iterative ordered subsets convex algorithm. Reconstructed image quality was characterized using SNR and contrast analysis, and followed by a human observer detection task for the spheres in the different concentric rings. Results show that scatter correction effectively reduces the cupping artifact and improves image contrast and SNR. Results from the observer study indicate that there was no statistical difference in the number or sizes of lesions observed in the scatter versus non-scatter corrected images for all densities. Nonetheless, applying scatter correction for differing breast conditions improves overall image quality. Thesi...|$|R
40|$|Studies {{examining}} acute perfusion changes (3 ̆c 1 3 ̆emonth) in irradiated {{fields are}} limited. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) {{is a novel}} method of scanning spectroscopy that provides direct measurement of cutaneous tissue perfusion that is non-invasive. In this clinical study, we examine the ability of HSI to assess cutaneous changes in skin perfusion during the acute period following irradiation in patients. Patients undergoing external <b>beam</b> <b>breast</b> conserving radiotherapy (n= 15) or post-mastectomy radiation (n= 3) were enrolled. Total treatment doses ranged between 42 Gy and 50 Gy. Baseline images were obtained before irradiation for bilateral breasts in each patient and then subsequently at each dose fraction. Skin reaction assessment was also performed on the patients. In the irradiated breast, total perfusion was found to increase prior to skin reaction formation and continued to steadily increase over the first 30 days in all patients. Skin reactions included erythema and dry desquamation starting at day 11. These findings suggest that HSI can identify early changes of tissue oxygenation and perfusion in acute radiation injury and {{may be able to}} predict the severity of such injuries. Future work will look at mitigating acute injury with topical applications and studying the perfusion changes in chronically irradiated skin...|$|R
40|$|Breast cancer {{remains the}} most common cancer in women in the {{developed}} world and the most frequent cause of cancer-related death among women worldwide [1]. In 2010 in the United States, the estimated number of new cases of breast cancer was 207, 090 (28 % of all cancer in women), with 39, 840 expected deaths (second cause of death after lung and bronchus carcinoma) [2]. Fortunately, thanks to the screening campaigns carried out in the Western countries, breast cancer can be treated in its early phase. The conventional surgical treatment for early breast cancer consists of either a mastectomy or breast conserving surgery (BCS), often accompanied by axillary dissection or sentinel node biopsy. If BCS is performed, whole <b>breast</b> external <b>beam</b> radiotherapy (EBRT) with doses around 50 - 60 Gy remains the gold standard for local control. The benefit of postoperative radiotherapy is well known since the completion of few prospective randomized trials conducted in the years 1976 - 1990, which compared conservative surgery and radiation with conservative surgery alone. Several clinical trials compared also breast conservative surgery (BCS) alone vs. BCS followed by whole breast (WB) EBRT: 10 - 35 % of women receiving BCS alone showed locoregional recurrence, whilst it occurred only in 0. 3 - 8 % of women after BCS plus WB-EBRT (follow-up range: 39 - 102 months), although both treatments produced the same 10 -year overall survival rates [3]. However, there is some recent evidence that lack of radiotherapy is associated with an increased hazard ratio for death [4]. Current accepted treatment protocol takes advantage of the above experiences and consists of BCS, usually accompanied by axillary node dissection or sentinel node biopsy. If BCS is performed, it is almost always accompanied by postoperative regional radiotherapy; 2 Gy per day delivered five times a week for 6 - 8 weeks, for a total dose of 50 - 60 Gy to eliminate microscopic cancer foci remaining after surgery [5]. A substantial benefit of an additional boost with 16 Gy to the tumor bed was recently confirmed by the EORTC [6] particularly in premenopausal women...|$|R
40|$|Background: Breast {{cancer is}} the most common cancer in women and the second cause of death among them. There are several {{treatment}} methods for breast cancer, one of which is radiation therapy. There are two important methods of radiation therapy: tangential field and single oppositional field. Main goal of this study is evaluation of factors that have a role in producing acute side effects such as skin burning in breast cancer patients treated by electron beam,in order to decrease these side effects. &# 13; Methods: From 1 / 2003 through 7 / 2004, 200 consecutive patients were evaluated during 18 months in seid-al-shohad hospital, whose mean age was 49 years old. In this study a questionnaire was used including some questions about personal profile such as patient's name, address, registration number, age and some other factors. All patients who were candidated to enter in this investigation filled out the questionnaire at the end of radiation therapy. The patients were examined and their skin burning grades were evaluated by RTOG scale. Data were analyzed by chi-square test using SPSS 11 software. &# 13; Results: None of patients showed grades O or 4 of burning. 31. 5 % of Patients showed grade 1, 64. 5 % showed grade 2, 4 % showed grade 3 of burning. There was statistically significant correlation between posterior axillary field and skin burning and there wasnot any meaning between the other factors. &# 13; Conclusion: It is necessary {{to pay more attention to}} posterior axillary field planning including field size, location, photon energy, depth and dose of treatment. &# 13; Keywords: <b>breast</b> cancer, electron <b>beam</b> radiation therapy, skin burnin...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{pictorial}} essay is to illustrate the multimodality imaging find-ings of {{a wide spectrum of}} radiation-induced complications of breast cancer in the sequence of occurrence. We have classified radiation-induced complications into three groups based on the time sequence of occurrence. Knowledge of these findings will allow for the early detection of complications as well as the ability to differentiate tumor recurrence. he primary target of radiation therapy is the eradication of microscopic residual disease adjacent to the original site of the tumor as well as the elimination of any evidence of multicentric disease. External beam radiation is the usual type of radiation therapy that is administered for the treatment of <b>breast</b> cancer. External <b>beam</b> radiation consists of three steps: computed tomogra-phy (CT) simulation, contouring of the targeted site and tangential two-field planning (Fig. 1). Exposure to radiation affects the adjacent structures as well as the operation bed within the entire breast (1) (Fig. 2). We have classified radiation-induced complications into three groups based on the time sequence of occurrence (2) (Table 1). The first group is composed of early compli-cations that arise during the weeks to months following completion of radiation therapy including breast edema, fat necrosis, dystrophic calcifications, radiation-induced pneumonia and pleural effusion. The second group is composed of intermedi-ate complications that arise during months to years following completion of radiation therapy including breast fibrosis, glandular atrophy, lactational difficulty, overlying bone fracture, pulmonary fibrosis and pericardial disease. The third group consists of late complications such as cardiomyopathy and radiation-induced malignancies that arise more than ten years following completion of radiation therapy...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: After {{high-dose}} chemotherapy with autologous stem-cell support long {{hospital stays}} in the aplastic phase are expensive, lead to increased risk of hospital infections and to increasing pressure on available hospital beds. We developed a home care regimen that allows patients {{to be at home}} for most of the aplastic period, without daily hospital visits. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between October 1995 and December 1997, transfer of supportive care to the home setting took place in three phases for patients undergoing high-dose chemotherapy with stem-cell transplant for malignant lymphoma (one course of <b>BEAM),</b> <b>breast</b> cancer or germ-cell cancer (three courses of tCTC). In the inpatient cohort, the supportive care designed for at home use was administered in the hospital until neutrophile recovery to 0. 5 x 10 (9) /l. In the second, outpatient cohort, patients were discharged the day after stem-cell reinfusion but the supportive care was delivered daily in hospital. The third, home care cohort, consisted of patients who were discharged the day after stemcell reinfusion, after which specialized home care professionals delivered all supportive care including transfusions and parenteral antibiotics at home, with once weekly check-up in hospital by the transplant physician. RESULTS: Forty-two patients were treated with 81 cycles of high-dose chemotherapy (11, 18 and 13 patients and 17, 40 and 24 courses in the inpatient, outpatient and home care cohorts respectively). Inpatients were hospitalized in the aplastic phase for a median of 14 days. Patients in the outpatient cohort were at home in the aplastic phase for a median of six days (with a median of six days in hospital), and in the home care cohort for a median of 10 days (with a median of 1. 5 days in hospital). Unscheduled readmissions and hospital visits were frequent in the outpatient and home care cohorts, mostly due to fever, central indwelling catheter malfunctioning or chemotherapy-related toxicity. However, patients could usually be discharged again after observation and treatment. No infectious deaths or unexpected emergencies occurred in the outpatient or home care cohort. Neither was there any suggestion of an increased number of fevers, infections, or other complications. CONCLUSIONS: At home management in the aplastic phase after high-dose chemotherapy and stemcell transplant by community-based professionals is feasible without signs of increased toxicity or infection...|$|R
