25|$|Though {{the temple}} of Gangaikonda Cholapuram follows the plan of the great temple of Thanjavur in most details it has {{characteristics}} of its own. From the remains it may be seen that it had only one enclosure wall and a gopura while the Thanjavur temple has two gopuras and enclosures. It is larger in plan though not as tall, the vimana being 100 feet square at the base and 186 feet high. The temple, which forms a large rectangle 340 feet long and 110 feet wide occupies {{the middle of an}} immense walled enclosure mainly built for defensive purposes. The vimana has the same construction as in Thanjavur, but the number of tiers making up the pyramidal body is only eight as against 13 in Thanjavur. The most important difference lies in the introduction of curves in the place of the strong straight lines of the Thanjavur vimana. The pyramidal body is slightly concave in its outline at its angles while the sides are curved to produce a somewhat convex outline. These curves enhance the <b>beauty</b> <b>of</b> <b>form</b> of the vimana though they distract from its stateliness and power.|$|E

500|$|Bellette {{had become}} an [...] "onlooker" [...] to the local art scene. This was {{in part because of}} a {{transition}} in Australian art that included the rise of abstract expressionism, the strong influence of a small number of gallery owners, and discrimination against women that reached [...] "record levels". Bellette was nevertheless able to secure some exhibitions in Sydney and Melbourne. These infrequent exhibitions were received very positively by critics. When her work was hung at the South Yarra Gallery in 1964, noted art historian and critic Bernard Smith stated in his review for The Age that he [...] "could not recall an exhibition in Melbourne of this quality since I began to write this column." [...] Reviewing her 1966 show in Sydney, the Herald critic considered it was her [...] "ability to combine the calm <b>beauty</b> <b>of</b> <b>form</b> of her beloved classicism of content with a dark romantic spirit that has gained her such an honourable place in Australian painting...the antiquity of nature and man's constructions are explored with a subtle, powerful inquiry." [...] In 1971, Melbourne critic Alan McCulloch considered her classical compositions to be her most successful. Drawing parallels between classical tragedy and contemporary global refugee crises, he noted [...] "there is infinite tenderness in these paintings and infinite sadness. For although these rocky, shadowed landscapes are peopled with the ghosts and shades of an ancient civilisation, they are also curiously symbolic of present day tensions and tragedies." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{historian}} Walter Goffart {{says of the}} Historia {{that many}} modern historians find it a [...] "tale of origins framed dynamically as the Providence-guided advance of a people from heathendom to Christianity; a cast of saints rather than rude warriors; a mastery of historical technique incomparable for its time; <b>beauty</b> <b>of</b> <b>form</b> and diction; and, not least, an author whose qualities of life and spirit set a model of dedicated scholarship." [...] Goffart also feels that a major theme of the Historia is local, Northumbrian concerns, and that Bede treated matters outside Northumbria as secondary to his main concern with northern history. Goffart sees {{the writing of the}} Historia as motivated by a political struggle in Northumbria between a party devoted to Wilfrid, and those opposed to Wilfrid's policies.|$|E
