For high purity products, the dynamics of the column become highly nonlinear and coupled and the response are sensitive to external disturbances. Distillation column control systems are use to purity the mixture of methanol and water which shows strong interaction, nonlinear dynamics and a large number of possible control structures. In this paper, we consider a decoupling controller to eliminate the strong interactions. The decoupler cancels the effect of the distillate composition to the change of the <b>bottom</b> <b>composition</b> and the effect of the <b>bottom</b> <b>composition</b> by the distillate composition.

40|$|Batch {{distillation}} {{has important}} for industries recent years. This is mainly {{due to its}} flexibility and capability to produce high purity product. The simulation of batch distillation columns during steady state operations is a very challenging modelling problem because of the complex dynamic behaviour. In order to verify this issue,simulation of this batch distillation column is to be performed by using computer aided design software and mathematical model so that {{the results can be}} validated. This study is required to model and simulate of fermentation product purification using batch distillation. In this study, simple mathematical models are proposed for the simulation of the dynamic behaviour during steady state operations from product of fermentation. Simulation of simple batch distillation was done by using mathematical method and computer simulator, MATLAB ®. The results from these simulations were used as a basis to validate the results obtained from experimentally. As conclusion,distillate and <b>bottoms</b> <b>composition</b> for ethanol drop gradually over time by using graphical method and the trend from simulation showed that the distillate and <b>bottoms</b> <b>composition</b> for ethanol increase and decrease over the time respectively.

The pool closest to the inner fringe of the reef had lower salinity and higher temperature due to inflow of groundwater. The other pools varied only with respect to their morphometric characteristics, algal cover, and <b>bottom</b> <b>composition.</b> Species with a strong affinity for estuarine- like waters characterized the pool closest to the beach and distinguished its fish community from that of the other pools. Instead of being strongly structured by the physicochemical setting and position in the reef, fish communities of the other pools were determined by behavioral preferences and intra- and interspecific interactions. Differences in community structure were related to pool size (the larger sizes permitting the permanency of schooling species), to algal cover (which allowed camouflage for large predatory species), to <b>bottom</b> <b>composition</b> (which provided substrate for turf flora available to territorial herbivores), and to ecological effects (e. g., competition, territoriality, and predation).

40|$|An {{idealised}} {{model is}} presented to study the formation of sorted bed forms generated by a wind-driven along-shore current. The study employs a linear stability analysis to describe the time development of perturbations of both <b>bottom</b> <b>composition</b> and bed elevation, superimposed on a flat bed composed of a sediment mixture homogeneously distributed in space. The model considers both bed and suspended loads and {{takes into account the}} averaged influence of waves on the flow field and the transport of sediment. The results show that the positive coupling between waves, along-shore current and the erodible heterogeneous bed leads to the amplification of two modes, which exhibit distinct characteristics. A first mode is found to be dominant when moderate hydrodynamic conditions are considered and is primarily amplified by the convergence of sediment transport induced by the changes in the bed elevation. This mode has wavelengths of the order of hundred metres and has coarse (fine) sediments in its troughs (crests). By increasing the height of the waves and/or the strength of the steady current, the second mode can become dominant. This mode is characterised by shorter wavelengths and results from the interaction between the convergence of sediment transport related to changes in the <b>bottom</b> <b>composition</b> and that induced by perturbations of the bed elevation. These bed features can have an up-current or a down-current shift between the centre of the coarse-grained bands and the trough of the bottom wave. Typical growth times of the amplified features are of the order of hundreds of days and the migration rates, {{in the direction of the}} along-shore current, range between 0. 1 and 10 m per day. A qualitative comparison of the model results with field observations indicates that the generation of two distinct modes provides a possible explanation for the broad range of characteristics of the natural bed features...|$|E

The problem is motivated by the need of understanding and systematizing two-point control industrial schemes driven by four temperature measurements.

Then, a passivated by backstepping OF controller is built within a Lyapunov dissipation framework, yielding a linear control scheme with: (i) regulation of distillate (or <b>bottom)</b> <b>composition</b> by adjustment of reflux flow (or heat duty) {{on the basis of}} two temperature measurements in the stripping (or rectifying) section, (ii) per-section decentralized structure, (iii) a straightforward construction procedure, and (iv) conventional-like simple tuning guidelines, without the primary-secondary gain separation limitation of the standard cascade TPT controller.

The method allows a first insight to the problem by simple calculations, without requiring column variables to ensure rational use of energy and low environmental impact.

40|$|The present work {{describes}} {{the development and}} implementation of fuzzy control algorithms in order to control on-line the overhead product composition of a batch distillation column. Firstly, the influence of design parameters was evaluated through computational simulations and then the algorithms were experimentally tested by monitoring a pilot column. Binary mixtures of n-hexane/n-heptane were distilled. Temperature measurements and vapor-liquid equilibrium data are the basis for the inference of overhead and <b>bottom</b> <b>compositions.</b> Two different operational strategies were used for the experimental runs: constant overhead product composition and previously determined set-point trajectory. Using the first strategy, the performance of the fuzzy controllers is compared to the performance of conventional feedback digital controllers. Experimental results show that fuzzy control presents a better performance than the conventional digital feedback control and also that fuzzy controllers were able to deal successfully with variable set-point strategy, albeit using constant design parameter values. Under conventional control, the average reflux rate implemented was higher than the average reflux rate implemented with fuzzy algorithms. Consequently, the process becomes less time- and energy-consuming under fuzzy control. Since fuzzy methodology is a promising new way of looking at process control problems and their solutions, the results of this work could provide control system designers with a better evaluation of the potential worth of fuzzy control...|$|R

Accurate determination of water depth is important for monitoring underwater topography and detection of moved sediments and in support of navigation. A Worldview 2 (WV 2) image was used to develop high-resolution bathymetric maps (four meters) that were validated using bathymetry from an active sensor Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR). The influence of atmospheric corrections in depth retrievals was evaluated using the Dark Substract, Fast Line-of-Sight Atmospheric Analysis of Spectral Hypercubes (FLAASH) and the Cloud Shadow Approach (CSA) atmospheric corrections. The CSA combined with a simple band ratio (Band 2 /Band 3) provided the best performance, where it explained 82 % of model values. The WV 2 depth model was validated at another site within the image, where it successfully retrieved depth values with a coefficient of determination (r 2) of 0. 90 for all the depth values sampled, and an r 2 of 0. 70, for a depth range to 20 m.

In this work, it is studied the control structure {{selection of}} a deethanizer distillation column from Mongstad/Statoil. This is a multicomponent distillation column with a partial condenser and a vapor distillate flow. Having a very small distillate flow rate (1 % of the feed flow rate), this column presents some difficulties for pressure control. The simulations are done in ASPEN Plus and ASPEN Dynamics. The main objective is to find a structure that minimizes the effect of the disturbances and implementation error (noise and bias) in the top and <b>bottom</b> <b>compositions</b> (indirect composition control). The results show that it is better to control temperatures in the top section where the gains are higher and, as this is a multicomponent column, the two-point temperature control does not improve the control system performance, confirming the results obtained by Hori and Skogestad (2007 b). As the most important disturbance for this column is the feed flow rate, the results also show that we should ratio the available manipulated variables with feed flow to improve the control performance.
