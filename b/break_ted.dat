40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} topological phases in a 2 D {{photonic}} crystal with broken time (T) and parity (P) symmetries by performing calculations of band structures, Berry curvatures, Chern numbers, edge states and also numerical simulations of light propagation in the edge modes. Specifically, we consider a hexagonal lattice consisting of triangular gyromagnetic rods. Here the gyromagnetic material <b>breaks</b> <b>T</b> symmetry while the triangular rods breaks P symmetry. Interestingly, {{we find that}} the crystal could host quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) phases with different gap Chern numbers (C_g) including |C_g| > 1 as well as quantum valley Hall (QVH) phases with contrasting valley Chern numbers (C_v), depending on the orientation of the triangular rods. Furthermore, phase transitions among these topological phases, such as from QAH to QVH and vice versa, can be engineered by a simple rotation of the rods. Our band theoretical analyses reveal that the Dirac nodes at the K and K' valleys in the momentum space are produced and protected by the mirror symmetry (m_y) instead of the P symmetry, and they become gapped when either T or m_y symmetry is broken, resulting in a QAH or QVH phase, respectively. Moreover, a high Chern number (C_g = - 2) QAH phase is generated by gapping triply degenerate nodal points rather than pairs of Dirac points by <b>breaking</b> <b>T</b> symmetry. Our proposed photonic crystal thus provides a platform for investigating intriguing topological phenomena which may be challenging to realize in electronic systems, and also has promising potentials for device applications in photonics such as reflection-free one-way waveguides and topological photonic circuits...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{superfluid}} and insulating phases of interacting bosons on the triangular lattice with an inverted dispersion, corresponding to frustrated hopping between sites. The resulting single-particle dispersion has multiple minima at nonzero wavevectors in momentum space, {{in contrast to}} the unique zero-wavevector minimum of the unfrustrated problem. As a consequence, the superfluid phase is unstable against developing additonal chiral order that <b>breaks</b> time reversal (<b>T)</b> and parity (P) symmetries by forming a condensate at nonzero wavevector. We demonstrate that the loss of superfluidity can lead to an even more exotic phase, the chiral Mott insulator, with nontrivial current order that <b>breaks</b> <b>T,</b> P. These results are obtained via variational estimates, as well as a combination of bosonization and DMRG of triangular ladders, which taken together permit a fairly complete characterization of the phase diagram. We discuss the relevance of these phases to optical lattice experiments, as well as signatures of chiral symmetry breaking in time-of-flight images.

Eight to 11 wk of cross country training took place between T 1 and T 2, 9 to 12 wk of offseason training from T 2 to T 3, and an additional 4 to 5 wk of track season to T 4. Ten Ss completed all 4 tests. The 27 Ss tested recorded a T 1 VO 2 max of 56. 6 mlkg- 1 min- 1. The T 2 BO 2 max for 19 Ss was 59. 0 mlkg- 1 min- 1. Eleven Ss had a VO 2 max of 56. 2 mlkg- 1 min- 1 for T 3 and 10 Ss recorded 60. 7 mlkg- 1 min- 1 for T 4.

We describe the often time-varying volatility in commodity prices and show that it has increased in recent years...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the role of}} degeneracy in parity-time (PT) symmetry breaking for non-Hermitian wave equations beyond one dimension. We show that if the spectrum is degenerate {{in the absence of}} <b>T</b> <b>breaking,</b> and <b>T</b> is broken in a generic manner (without preserving other discrete symmetries), then the standard PT symmetry-breaking transition does not occur, meaning that the spectrum is complex even for infinitesimal strength of gain and loss. However, the realness of the entire spectrum can be preserved over a finite interval if additional discrete symmetries χ are imposed when T is broken, if χ decouples all degenerate modes. When the decoupling holds only for a subset of the degenerate spectrum, there can be a partial PT transition in which this subset remains real over a finite interval of <b>T</b> <b>breaking.</b> If the spectrum has odd degeneracy, a fraction of the degenerate spectrum can remain in the symmetric phase even without imposing additional discrete symmetries, and they are analogous to dark states in atomic physics. These results are illustrated by the example of different T-breaking perturbations of a uniform dielectric disk and sphere, and a group-theoretical analysis is given in the disk case. Finally, we show that multimode coupling is capable of restoring the PT-symmetric phase at finite <b>T</b> <b>breaking.</b> We also analyze these questions when the parity operator is replaced by another spatial symmetry operator and find that the behavior can be qualitatively different...|$|R

The relativistic spin-orbit interaction (SOI) plays {{an essential role in}} these novel phenomena, which lifts the Kramers degeneracy at each k-point, and leads to the mixing of the spin singlet-even parity and spin triplet odd-parity parings.

These antibodies may neutralize the biological effects of the protein drug, potentially decreasing its therapeutic effects. By high-resolution HLA class I and II typing we identified two HLA class II alleles associated with the development of antibodies to IFN-beta. In two independent continuous and binary-trait association studies, HLA-DRB 1 * 0401 and HLA-DRB 1 * 0408 (odds ratio: 5. 15) -but not other HLA alleles-were strongly associated with the development of binding and neutralizing antibodies to IFN-beta. The associated HLA-DRB 1 * 04 alleles differ from nonassociated HLA-DRB 1 * 04 alleles by a glycine-to-valine substitution in position 86 of the epitope-binding alpha-helix of the HLA class II molecule.

40|$|An {{in vitro}} {{system based on}} Escherichia coli {{infected}} with bacteriophage T 7 {{was used to test}} for involvement of host and phage recombination proteins in the repair of double strand <b>breaks</b> in the <b>T</b> 7 genome. Double strand breaks were placed in a unique XhoI site located approximately 17 % from the left end of the T 7 genome. In one assay, repair of these breaks was followed by packaging DNA recovered from repair reactions and determining the yield of infective phage. In a second assay, the product of the reactions was visualized after electrophoresis to estimate {{the extent to which the}} double strand breaks had been closed. Earlier work demonstrated that in this system double strand break repair takes place via incorporation of a patch of DNA into a gap formed at the break site. In the present study, it was found that extracts prepared from uninfected E. coli were unable to repair broken T 7 genomes in this in vitro system, thus implying that phage rather than host enzymes are the primary participants in the predominant repair mechanism. Extracts prepared from an E. coli recA mutant were as capable of double strand break repair as extracts from a wild-type host, arguing that the E. coli recombinase is not essential to the recombinational events required for double strand <b>break</b> repair. In <b>T</b> 7 strand exchange during recombination is mediated by the combined action of the helicase encoded by gene 4 and the annealing function of the gene 2. 5 single strand binding protein.
