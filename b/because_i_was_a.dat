People behaved in an ugly and despicable fashion towards me. I felt no constraints. Nothing I did in my book is as mean as any of the people I wrote about." [...] She was {{similarly}} unrepentant about her subsequent expatriation, saying [...] "I wasn't a pariah <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> drug-addicted, alcoholic, rotten person and not a good mother.

He was unimpressed with the standard of negotiations: [...] "our side all went in a group because no-one trusted anyone else and all were afraid that someone would break ranks and make a private deal."

[...] "I thought, well, why would you expect that you automatically could do it? Just <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> small girl, was I {{not to be able}} to do it? It was a memorable experience because it occurred to me then that other people had a different view of what I should or shouldn't be capable of doing. I think that people should just do whatever they can do or want to do. It shouldn't be a matter of if they're a man or a woman. It shouldn't be a matter of one's sex." ...|$|E

[...] She expounded on this in an article she published the following year in Look magazine, describing the openly dismissive reaction she had gotten from both men and women. She wrote that, [...] "In factories, I encountered men in small groups, laughing, shouting, 'Get in the kitchen. George needs you there. What {{do you know about}} politics?'" [...] To a friend she wrote, [...] " [...] how open and bare and wide my own vulnerability would be ... the body wounds are deep."

500|$|As a teenager, Cruz became {{interested}} in acting after seeing the film Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down! (1990) by Spanish director Pedro Almodóvar. She did casting calls for an agent but was rejected multiple times because the agent {{felt that she was}} too young. Cruz commented on the experience, [...] "I was very extroverted as a kid.... I was studying when I was in high school at night, I was in ballet and I was doing castings. I looked for an agent and she sent me away three times <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> little girl but I kept coming back. I'm still with her after all these years." [...] In 1989, at the age of 15, Cruz won an audition at a talent agency over more than 300 other girls. In 1999, Katrina Bayonas, Cruz's agent, commented, [...] "She was absolutely magic [...] It was obvious there was something very impressive about this kid.... She was very green, but there was a presence. There was just something coming from within." ...|$|E

2500|$|On November 20, 1955, African-American rock 'n' roll {{singer and}} guitarist Bo Diddley {{appeared}} on The Ed Sullivan Show, only to infuriate Sullivan ("I did two songs {{and he got}} mad"). Diddley {{had been asked to}} sing Tennessee Ernie Ford's hit [...] "Sixteen Tons", which he agreed.

2500|$|With the {{exception}} of The Elephant Man and Dune, which are set in Victorian London and a fictitious galaxy respectively, all of Lynch's films have been set in the United States, and he has stated that [...] "I like certain things about America and it gives me ideas. When I go around and I see things, it sparks little stories, or little characters pop out, so it just feels right to me to, you know, make American films." [...] A number of his works, including Blue Velvet, Twin Peaks and Lost Highway are intentionally reminiscent of the 1950s American culture despite being set in the later decades of the 20th century. Lynch stated that [...] "It was a fantastic decade {{in a lot of}} ways... there was something in the air that is not there any more at all. It was such a great feeling, and not just <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> kid. It was a really hopeful time, and things were going up instead of going down.

2500|$|Hughes had a {{very poor}} {{relationship}} with his father, with whom he lived in Mexico {{for a brief period}} in 1919. Upon graduating from high school in June 1920, Hughes returned to Mexico to live with his father, hoping to convince him to support his plan to attend Columbia University. Hughes later said that, prior to arriving in Mexico, [...] "I had been thinking about my father and his strange dislike of his own people. I didn't understand it, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> Negro, and I liked Negroes very much." [...] Initially, his father had hoped for Hughes to attend a university abroad, and to study for a career in engineering. On these grounds, he was willing to provide financial assistance to his son but did not support his desire to be a writer. Eventually, Hughes and his father came to a compromise: Hughes would study engineering, so long as he could attend Columbia. His tuition provided; Hughes left his father after more than a year. While at Columbia in 1921, Hughes managed to maintain a B+ grade average. He left in 1922 because of racial prejudice. He was attracted more to the people and the neighborhood of Harlem than his studies, though he continued writing poetry.|$|E
