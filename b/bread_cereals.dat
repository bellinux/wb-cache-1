5000|$|Amid high {{food prices}} in 1972, Sweden's National Board of Health and Welfare {{developed}} {{the idea of}} [...] "basic foods" [...] that were both cheap and nutritious, and [...] "supplemental foods" [...] that added nutrition missing from the basic foods. Anna-Britt Agnsäter, chief of the [...] "test kitchen" [...] for Kooperativa Förbundet (a cooperative Swedish retail chain), held a lecture the next year on how to illustrate these food groups. Attendee Fjalar Clemes suggested a triangle displaying basic foods at the base. Agnsäter developed the idea into the first food pyramid, which {{was introduced to the}} public in 1974 in KF's Vi magazine. The pyramid was divided into basic foods at the base, including milk, cheese, margarine, <b>bread,</b> <b>cereals</b> and potato; a large section of supplemental vegetables and fruit; and an apex of supplemental meat, fish and egg. The pyramid competed with the National Board's [...] "dietary circle," [...] which KF saw as problematic for resembling a cake divided into seven slices, and for not indicating how much of each food should be eaten. While the Board distanced itself from the pyramid, KF continued to promote it, and food pyramids were developed in other Scandinavian countries, as well as West Germany, Japan and Sri Lanka. The United States later developed its first food pyramid in 1992.|$|E

40|$|The anemia which {{develops}} after splenectomy is most {{marked in}} animals on a mixed table scrap diet of meat, <b>bread,</b> <b>cereals,</b> and vegetables, {{which is essentially}} a cooked diet. Control studies in which a unilateral nephrectomy precedes splenectomy demonstrate that the anemia is not due to operation, hemorrhage, or accidents of convalescence but develops only {{in the absence of}} the spleen. The results of studies of the influence of food containing a large amount of iron in presumably easily utilizable form, as in raw beef spleen, do not support the view that the anemia is due to lack of iron in the food. Observation on the influence of a diet of raw meat as contrasted with cooked meat shows a more severe anemia in animals on the cooked diet and suggests the possibility that heat alters some substance which, {{in the absence of the}} spleen, the body cannot utilize. A final conclusion in regard to this point must, however, await the results of more detailed studies now in progress...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} biological substances consumed in insufficient quantity is fibre that is often deficient in the diet. In general, dietary fibre is edible part of plants, or similar carbohydrates, that are resistant to digestion and absorption in the small intestine. Nowadays, there are many sources of fibre available for bakery industry, whether through addition of non-traditional <b>bread</b> <b>cereals</b> or through isolated form as additives. Except to supposed increase the nutritional value of bakery products with added fiber and raw materials containing fiber is necessary to think about their technological quality and rheological properties of dough. The aim of this experimental work was to investigate the effect of the addition of selected polysaccharides (inulin, Potex - potato fiber) and non-bakery crops (naked barley, malt) containing significant polysaccharides used in the mixture with wheat flour type T- 650 in different ratios on the basis of farinographic evaluations. Based on the results of rheological measurements we found out that quality of dough was deteriorating proportionally to the amount of used additives. On the other hand, positively could be considered the increase of water absorption with addition of Potex and naked barley...|$|E

Design: This cross-sectional population-based study used the Cancer Council of Victoria food frequency questionnaires to derive estimates of food and nutrient intakes. Setting: Nationwide community-based survey. Subjects: A total of 10561 women aged 50 - 55 y, {{at the time of}} the survey in 2001. Results: Analysis showed favourable patterns of food intake, with frequent consumption of many foods that are promoted as components of a healthy diet (eg, fresh fruit, leafy green and other vegetables, <b>bread,</b> <b>cereals,</b> milk and meat). Intakes of both foods and nutrients varied significantly across socio-demographic groups, with unmarried women, and women in 2 ̆ 7 labouring 2 ̆ 7 occupations (eg, cleaner, factory worker, kitchenhand) having poorer nutrient intake. Conclusions: Although many mid-aged women in this sample had generally healthful diets, women in certain socio-demographic groups (particularly unmarried women and those in labouring occupations) had nutrient intakes of concern. As well as helping to address the dearth of current data on dietary intakes in the Australian population, the results highlight the need for continued targeted public health strategies aimed at improving diet of women from the various socio-economic backgrounds. <br /...|$|E
40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE [...] The aim was {{to compare}} {{nutrient}} intakes of smokers, past smokers, and non-smokers. DESIGN [...] The study was cross sectional and compared nutrient intake by smoking status using data obtained from a concurrent study of diet. SETTING [...] The study took place in three towns in England: Ipswich, Wakefield, and Stoke on Trent. PARTICIPANTS [...] Food records were obtained from 1115 men and 1225 women aged 35 to 54 years, representing response rates of 84 - 86 % in the three towns. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS [...] Diet was assessed using a 24 h food record in household measures. For {{both men and women}} vitamin C, total fibre, beta carotene, and vitamin E intakes were lowest in the current smokers and highest in the non-smokers with past smokers having intermediate values. Polyunsaturated/saturated fat ratio was lowest in the current smokers. Men who smoked had higher energy intakes than those who did not. The lower fat intakes of beta carotene, vitamin C, fibre, and polyunsaturated fat in the smokers was due to fewer smokers eating a whole range of foods including fruit, wholemeal <b>bread,</b> <b>cereals,</b> and polyunsaturated margarine. Current smokers had a lower body mass index than non-smokers or past smokers despite their higher energy intakes.

40|$|To {{develop an}} FFQ for {{estimating}} culture-specific maize intake that can distinguish between home-grown and commercial maize. Home-grown maize {{is more likely}} to be contaminated with fumonisins, mycotoxins that are associated with increased risk of oesophageal cancer. An existing FFQ developed for use in urban Xhosa populations was used as the initial framework for the maize-specific FFQ (M-FFQ). The existing questionnaire contained 126 food items divided into ten food groups (<b>bread,</b> <b>cereals,</b> vegetables, fruit, meat, dairy, snacks, condiments, beverages and fat). The M-FFQ was developed based on additional data obtained from a literature search, 24 h recalls (n 159), in-depth interviews (n 4), focus group discussions (n 56) and expert consultation. Food items available in local shops (n 3) were compared with information obtained from focus group discussions. Five villages in two rural isiXhosa-speaking areas of the Eastern Cape Province, known to have a high incidence of oesophageal cancer, were randomly selected. Women aged 18 - 55 years were recruited by snowball sampling and invited to participate. The final M-FFQ comprised twenty-one maize-based food items, including traditional Xhosa dishes and beverages. The questionnaire focused on maize-specific dishes and distinguished between home-grown maize and commercial maize consumption. A culturally specific dietary assessment method was designed to determine maize consumption and therefore fumonisin exposure. The questionnaire will be tested against 24 h recalls and other methods to determine its validity, after which it will be used in various epidemiological studies to determine fumonisin exposure...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} was to examine relationships between meat and other food items which {{have been associated with}} higher risk of cancer in the colon and prostate in some epidemiological studies. The study was conducted as a population-based cohort study comprising 11648 subjects (4816 male and 6742 female) born between 1926 and 1945 and living in the city of MalmoÈ, Sweden. Data on mean daily intake of foods and nutrients were assessed with a diet history method combining a 7 -day menu book and a food frequency questionnaire. Increasing meat intake, expressed in quintiles and adjusted for energy, was associated with decreasing intakes of poultry, ®sh, fruits, <b>bread,</b> <b>cereals</b> and cheese in both sexes. Low negative correlations between meat intake and ascorbic acid (r=- 0 ´ 11) and ®ber (r=- 0 ´ 16 to- 0 ´ 20) were noted. The average intake of fat from meat out of total fat intake was 13 ´ 6 % in men and 11 ´ 9 % in women. No major associations were noted between meat and the cholesterol raising fatty acids C: 12 : 0, C: 14 : 0, C: 160 nor for C: 20 : 4 or its precursor C: 18 : 2. In conclusion, our ®ndings indicate that meat consumption is negatively associated with food groups rich in antioxidants and ®ber and the positive covariance reported between meat and cancer and coronary heart disease might, therefore, not be directly linked to components in meat.

40|$|Objective To {{investigate}} {{differences between}} dietary habits in Glasgow {{and those in}} the rest of Scotland and the role that socio-economic factors have in explaining these. Design Data on age, sex, area deprivation, social class, educational qualifications, economic activity, health board region, postcode sector area and informants’ usual intake of foods covering sugary foods, snacks, fibre, starch, meat, fish, spreading fats, dairy products, salt, dietary supplements, fruit and vegetables were available from the 1995, 1998 and 2003 Scottish Health Surveys. Multilevel logistic regression was used to model the relationship between diet and living in Greater Glasgow compared with elsewhere in Scotland, unadjusted and adjusted for age, survey year and socio-economic factors, accounting for the clustering within postcode sector area. Setting Scotland. Subjects Subjects comprised 11 075 male and 14 052 female respondents. Results Lower consumption of high-fibre bread and potatoes/pasta/rice (among men and women), of cakes (men) and of cereals, meat, skimmed/semi-skimmed milk and green vegetables (women) in Glasgow was explained by socio-economic factors, as was higher consumption of non-diet soft drinks among women; lower consumption of ice cream, <b>bread,</b> <b>cereals,</b> meat and green vegetables (men) and high butter and salt consumption (women) in Greater Glasgow were not. Conclusion Associations between unhealthy eating and deprivation accounted for much of the tendency of people in Glasgow to have poor diets.
