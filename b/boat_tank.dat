From the dock's western end, where it meets the Royal Victoria Dock there is the London Regatta Centre, an international class rowing centre, with the Yi-Ban Chinese restaurant on top of the building. The regatta centre contains facilities for rowers and dragon boaters such as a gymnasium, <b>boat</b> <b>tank,</b> and boathouse, and is home to several clubs, including Queen Mary, University of London Boat Club, University of East London Boat Club, Royal Docks Rowing Club, Typhoon DBC, Thames Dragons, and Raging Dragons.|$|E
5000|$|From the Royal Thames Yacht Club, White Crusader was {{designed}} by Ian Howlett and was a traditional 12 metre design evolved from the DeSavery Lionhart '83 boat of the previous Americas Cup event. However, White Crusader II was a radical design and designed by David Hollam. This second boat {{was used as a}} trial horse against White Crusader, but the team eventually decided to use the more conventional designed <b>boat.</b> <b>Tank</b> testing was carried out at Southampton University and HMS Haslar. The deadline for acceptance of challenges was 1 April 1986 and Admiral Sir Ian Easton wrote his own personal cheque for $16,000 as an entry fee deposit. Harold Cudmore acted as skipper-tactician and starting helmsman who then handed over the helm to Chris Law for the remainder of each races. Eddie Warden-Owen was the navigator. Both boats were originally named simply Crusader One and Two but the [...] "White" [...] part of their names were added when millionaire Graham Walker (Of White Horse whiskey fame) gave heavy sponsorship to the British challengers at the last minute before the event started so the [...] "White" [...] was added to their names.|$|E

However, this genre includes any game that creates the feeling of driving or flying a vehicle, including the magic broomsticks in the Harry Potter games.

If a vehicle is accessible to the player, they can take the position of driver or simply ride in the vehicle as a passenger. Many vehicles, such as tanks, require a crew {{of at least a}} driver and a gunner to be used effectively. All vehicles have accurately modeled 3D interiors.|$|R
50|$|In October 2010 a boat {{carrying}} {{drinks and}} other products from the Banks DIH company to the Essequibo Coast developed leaks {{and had to be}} grounded on the Stewartville foreshore. Mud had got into the pump, which would not start, and the engine room flooded. After the tide receded, the boat leaned to one side. Some boxes fell off and were taken away by Stewartville residents.That night, dozens of people climbed onto the boat, taking soft drinks and alcoholic drinks, as well as other products such as biscuits and bottled water. The looting was thorough, including draining the fuel from the <b>boat's</b> <b>tanks.</b> Some started drinking while they were looting. One man, apparently drunk, fell into the water and drowned between the boat and the sea wall.|$|R

50|$|From the Peleliu {{campaign}} on, {{a number}} of LVTs were fitted with a flamethrower for use against fortifications. The LVT was usually flanked {{by a pair of}} gun tanks for protection.

2500|$|Tropic Green system: Through 1942 the Camouflage Section {{had issued}} no {{instructions}} for landing craft, PT <b>boats,</b> <b>Tank</b> Landing Ships (LSTs) and other vessels expected to operate close inshore in Pacific jungle conditions, so individual commands resorted to overall green, or ad-hoc camouflage patterns in whatever green or brown paints could be obtained. In early 1943 BuShips began the development a green series {{parallel to the}} blue-gray series, but the process was slow and therefore the South Pacific Command as an expedient ordered its amphibious vessels to be repainted in Dark Tropic Green with [...] "tiger stripes" [...] in Light Tropic Green, both {{of which could be}} created by mixing standard 5-TMa blue tinting medium with yellow zinc chromate primer. According to a contemporary report, [...] "The color of the foliage [...] was surprisingly high in key, a brilliance that would have been unbelievable except for the very same observations made on first arrival in the Solomons group." ...|$|R

50|$|Turboshaft {{engines are}} {{commonly}} used in applications that require a sustained high power output, high reliability, small size, and light weight. These include helicopters, auxiliary power units, <b>boats</b> and ships, <b>tanks,</b> hovercraft, and stationary equipment.|$|R

5000|$|With {{the advent}} of modern plastics, the amount of skill {{required}} to get the basic shape accurately shown for any given subject was lessened, {{making it easier for}} people of all ages to begin assembling replicas in varying scales. Superheroes, aeroplanes, <b>boats,</b> cars, <b>tanks,</b> artillery, and even figures of soldiers became quite popular subjects to build, paint and display. Although almost any subject can be found in almost any scale, there are common scales for such miniatures which remain constant today.|$|R

On 31 May 1955 and the deployment of troops over. Capital facilities and most of the equipment transferred to China. Almost everything was free of charge, including dozens of torpedo <b>boats,</b> <b>tanks,</b> submarines, all the ammunition. On the day of departure of troops solemn construction in parts where the Chinese gave the keys to the property. To the sound of the Soviet anthem was lowered naval flag of the Soviet Union, and then was replaced by a Chinese flag. Conclusion took 8 months. After retiring in Port Arthur for a while there were still Soviet specialists who taught Chinese sailors.Reduction and then disbanding the 39th Army began in 1955.

50|$|A simpler test, {{that is also}} {{considered}} a hydrostatic test but can be performed by anyone who has a garden hose, is to pressurise the vessel by filling it with water and to physically examine the outside for leaks.

A hydrostatic test head is usually specified as a height above the tank top. The tank is pressurised by filling water to the specified height through a temporary standpipe if necessary.
