A {{method of}} assessing {{the state of}} the lining of the small intestine in a mammal or human injesting a suitable labelled test substrate which requires conversion by a brush border enzyme for transport across the small intestinal lining. Suitable substrates include sucrose and maltose. The transport of these can very conveniently be measured by assessing the amount of label present in carbon dioxide expelled in the breath after a period of time.

40|$|AbstractFor a graph G on n {{vertices}} and a field F, {{the minimum}} rank of G over F, written as mrF(G), {{is the smallest}} possible rank over all n×n symmetric matrices over F whose (i,j) th entry (for i≠j) is nonzero whenever ij is an edge in G and is zero otherwise. The maximum nullity of G over F is MF(G) =n-mrF(G). The minimum rank problem of a graph G is to determine mrF(G) (or equivalently, MF(G)). This problem has received considerable attention over the years. In [F. Barioli, W. Barrett, <b>S.</b> <b>Butler,</b> <b>S.</b> M. Cioabă, D. Cvetković, S. M. Fallat, C. Godsil, W. Haemers, L.

40|$|Type of work : NonReferee Journal ArticleThis paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} subjectivity, identity coherence and embodiment {{in the context of}} space by analysing character development and characterisation in the television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Character transformation in Buffy goes beyond the traditional question of the abjectively transformed vampire body, and instead focuses on the major characters in terms of their embodied subjecthood and the question of subjectivity {{as a response to the}} cultural imperative of coherence, intelligibility and recognisability. As characters, Buffy and her friends come into physical contact with demons, vampires, monsters and creatures that are culturally-coded abject not by virtue of a good/evil or subject/abject dichotomy, but through their establishment in the narrative as that which puts into question the fantasy of coherent bodies and coherent subjectivity. I consider here how <b>Butler</b> <b>s</b> theories of subjective performativity and bodily materialisation can be figured within a cultural crisis of the subject by showing that performativity, as a citation of the signifier or category or norm as co-ordinate of selfhood, is conditioned not only by the cultural imperative to articulate a coherent, normalised and regimented body but in distinction from the cultural construction of the abject, or that which threatens coherent subjectivity...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} teen soap The O. C. s {{representation of}} gender and masculinity. The study employs a social constructivist view of gender, particularly inspired by Judith <b>Butler</b> <b>s</b> work. Moreover, theories on masculinity, masquerade and melodrama, feminist theory {{and the work of}} Camille Paglia also make up important theoretical groundwork which this thesis rests on. The main question I structure my thesis around is how gender and masculinity are represented in The O. C through the characters of Ryan and Seth. My approach to examining this question is through textual analysis. The analysis is divided into three main parts. One chapter explores the representation {{of gender and}} masculinity from the perspective of film history, focusing especially on how Ryan is influenced by Marlon Brando s star persona, while Seth s display of masculinity evokes Woody Allen s comic screen persona. In my second main chapter I examine their friendship from the framework of homosociality and homoeroticism, then I briefly suggest a third way of looking at their relationship, inspired by the term bro-mance. In my final chapter I analyze Ryan and Seth s look, style and fashion, pointing out how clothing plays a key element in expressing the flexibility of masculine identities...|$|R
