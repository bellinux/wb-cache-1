25|$|In Steve Lenius' {{original}} 2001 {{paper he}} explored {{the acceptance of}} bisexuality in a supposedly pansexual BDSM community. The reasoning behind this is that 'coming-out' had become primarily {{the territory of the}} gay and lesbian, with bisexuals feeling the push to be one or the other (and <b>being</b> <b>right</b> only half the time either way). What he found in 2001, was that people in BDSM were open to discussion about the topic of bisexuality and pansexuality and all controversies they bring to the table, but personal biases and issues stood in the way of actively using such labels. A decade later, Lenius (2011) looks back on his study and considers if anything has changed. He concluded that the standing of bisexuals in the BDSM and kink community was unchanged, and believed that positive shifts in attitude were moderated by society's changing views towards different sexualities and orientations. But Lenius (2011) does emphasize that the pansexual promoting BDSM community helped advance greater acceptance of alternative sexualities.|$|E
25|$|The {{northern}} Atlantic coast has warm summers (28°C to 32°C, {{but with}} relatively cool nights at 15°C) and mild winters, with highs of about 12°C and lows about 2–3°C. Occasionally, temperatures reach −10°C or 40°C, and rainfall is very scarce. It only gets a bit colder further south in Chubut, {{and the city}} of Comodoro Rivadavia has summer temperatures of 24°C to 28°C, nights of 12°C to 16°C, and winters with days around 10°C and nights around 3°C, and less than 250mm of rain. However, there is a drastic drop as we move south to Santa Cruz: Rio Gallegos, in the south of the province, has summer temps of 17°C to 21°C, (nights between 6°C and 10°C) and winter temperatures of 2°C to 6°C, with nights between −5°C and 0°C despite <b>being</b> <b>right</b> on the coast. Snowfall is common despite the dryness, and temperatures are known to fall to under −18°C and to remain below freezing for several days in a row. Rio Gallegos is also among the windiest places on Earth, with winds reaching 100km h occasionally.|$|E

25|$|Hulsker {{called the}} signed drawing The Public Soup Kitchen (F1020a below) {{important}} and attractive. Van Gogh and his contemporary George Hendrik Breitner had sketched {{together at a}} soup kitchen in the Geest (it is not known which of the several possibilities it was). After going to the trouble and expense of installing shutters in his windows to adjust the light and to recreate the scene itself in his studio, van Gogh was able to study his models at leisure. In this way {{he was able to}} introduce more chiaroscuro (light and dark) in his drawing, which he executed with the natural ('mountain') chalk that Theo had sent him and whose properties he lauds in his letters. All the models are from Sien's family: her mother and baby on the left, her sister, back turned, and her daughter, hair cropped as a precaution against lice, in the center, with Sien herself, superbly executed in profile, on the right. The watercolor F1020b (below) is much less successful as van Gogh himself acknowledged, blaming the paper in part for not <b>being</b> <b>right</b> for the job.|$|E

Milo has had difficulties in school with mathematics and problem solving; his reaction to this encounter is to protest that averages are not real. [...] The partial child enlightens Milo that there is beauty in math beyond the tedium of learning an endless set of rules, [...] "one of the nicest things about mathematics, or anything else you might care to learn, {{is that many of the}} things which can never be, often are". Late in the book, Princess Reason counsels Milo, who has much learning ahead of him, not to be discouraged by its complexity, [...] "You must never feel badly about making mistakes... as long as you take the trouble to learn from them.

500|$|Sean Young was {{originally}} cast as Vicki Vale, but {{was injured in}} a horse-riding accident prior to commencement of filming. Young's departure necessitated an urgent search for an actress who, besides <b>being</b> <b>right</b> for the part, could commit to the film at very short notice. Peters suggested Kim Basinger: {{she was able to}} join the production immediately and was cast. As a fan of Michael Gough's work in various Hammer Film Productions, Burton cast Gough as Bruce Wayne's butler, Alfred Pennyworth. Robert Wuhl was cast as reporter Alexander Knox. His character {{was originally}} supposed to die by the Joker's poison gas in the climax, but the filmmakers [...] "liked [...] character so much," [...] Wuhl said, [...] "that they decided to let me live." [...] Burton chose Billy Dee Williams as Harvey Dent because he wanted to include the villain Two-Face in a future film using the concept of an African-American Two-Face for the black and white concept, but Tommy Lee Jones was later cast in the role for Batman Forever, which disappointed Williams. Nicholson convinced the filmmakers to cast his close friend Tracey Walter as the Joker's henchman, Bob. Kiefer Sutherland was considered as Robin before the character was deleted from the shooting script. The rest of the cast included Pat Hingle as Commissioner Gordon, Jerry Hall as Alicia Hunt, Lee Wallace as Mayor Borg, William Hootkins as Lt. Max Eckhardt, and Jack Palance as crime boss Carl Grissom.|$|E

2500|$|Tabor mapped the SCF {{turning and}} merging with the Taneum fault (coincident with the OWL) south of Kachess Lake. This {{conforms}} {{with the general}} pattern seen in Lakes Keechelus, Kachess, and Cle Elum, and associated geological units and faults (see image, right): each is aligned northmdash&south at the north end, but turns to the southeast where it approaches the OWL. [...] This is suggestive of the OWL being a left lateral (sinistral) strike-slip fault that has distorted and offset the SCF. [...] But that is inconsistent with the SCF itself and most other strike-slip faults associated with the OWL <b>being</b> <b>right</b> lateral (dextral), and incompatible with the geology to the southeast. Particularly, studies of the region to the southeast (in connection with Department of Energy activities at the Hanford Reservation) show no indication of any fault or other structure comparable to the SCF.|$|E

2500|$|Head's {{unwillingness to}} be wrong was not always of benefit to him. One day a fellow of his, William Bullock, decided to test the extent of Head's 'omnipotence'. Asking the doctor at lunch whether he had read Hagenheimer's new book on {{locomotor}} ataxia. Head replied he had only had time to glance at it. Bullock commented, [...] "Well, you have done better {{than the rest of}} us. There is no such book." [...] While this experience would appear more 'uncomfortable' than harmful, Head's need to be certain did prove a hindrance when his sensations were being tested by Rivers in their 'Human Experiment in Nerve Division'. As is written in the report, if Head concentrated too closely on the task, his anxieties about <b>being</b> <b>right</b> tended to make him give the wrong answer. It was only when he forgot completely about the experiment that he managed to be precise about his sensations.|$|E
2500|$|By 1991, Anderson and Frischmann {{had broken}} up. Frischmann started dating Blur {{frontman}} Damon Albarn. She believed the band could accommodate the new situation. However, the situation grew tense. Butler recalled, [...] "She'd turn up late for rehearsals {{and say the}} worst {{thing in the world}} – 'I've been on a Blur video shoot.' That was when it ended, really. I think it was the day after she said that that Brett phoned me up and said, 'I've kicked her out.'" [...] After Frischmann's departure, the character of the group changed. [...] "If Justine hadn't left the band," [...] Anderson said, [...] "I don't think we'd have got anywhere. It was a combination of being personally motivated, and the chemistry <b>being</b> <b>right</b> once she'd left." [...] Anderson and Butler became close friends and began writing several new songs together. However, the band's music was out-of-step with the music of its London contemporaries as well as the American grunge bands. Anderson said, [...] "For the whole of 1991, A men wouldn't give us a second look." ...|$|E

He responds to the [...] "science is bleak" [...] argument by saying that the world is so wonderful that the word 'mundane' has a mismatched meaning and etymology. He then complains about the long-term fall in the number of students taking chemistry and physics at A-level. He suggests this is partly because of the UK education system encouraging students to value personal feeling over evidence and reason. He interviews the relativist Steve Fuller and criticises him for being [...] "so close to <b>being</b> <b>right</b> but ... damn wrong". Fuller {{points out that}} different people can interpret the same evidence differently. Fuller also points out the benefits of the Internet, and Dawkins agrees, but then turns to the dangers it poses in causing the spread of fabricated statements. He also points {{to the fact that the}} MMR vaccine scandal involved an unsubstantiated conspiracy theory about the UK government. Dawkins concludes that reason [...] "built the modern world. It is a precious but fragile thing".|$|E

2500|$|<b>Being</b> <b>right</b> {{was little}} {{consolation}} to Rundstedt. By 11 June {{it was evident}} that the Allies could not be dislodged from their beach-head in Normandy. Their total command of the air and the sabotage of roads and bridges by the Resistance made bringing armoured reinforcements to Normandy slow and difficult, but without them there was no hope of an effective counter-offensive. Supported by Rommel, he tried to persuade Keitel at OKW that the only escape was to withdraw from Normandy to a prepared defensive line on the Seine, but Hitler forbade any withdrawal. On 17 June Hitler flew to France and met Rundstedt and Rommel at his command bunker near Soissons. Both Field Marshals argued that the situation in Normandy required either massive reinforcements (which were not available) or a rapid withdrawal. Remarkably, they both also urged that Hitler find a political solution to end the war, which Rommel told him bluntly was unwinnable. Hitler ignored all their demands, requiring [...] "fanatical" [...] defence and a counter-attack with whatever was available. Rommel warned Hitler about the inevitable collapse in the German defences, but was rebuffed and told to focus on military operations.|$|E
2500|$|A {{master of}} sophistry, Canning {{can make a}} {{superficial}} case for any political action. Often it seems that his arguments follow his whims. [...] "If all this", muses Hazlitt, [...] "were fickleness, caprice, forgetfulness, accident, folly, it would be well ... we should stand a chance of sometimes <b>being</b> <b>right,</b> sometimes wrong." [...] But the case is worse. Although Canning's arguments may seem arbitrary, so that sometimes some good may come of them, examination of their tendency shows a darker influence: that of support of [...] "Legitimacy", warmongering {{for the restoration of}} Bourbon royalty on the European continent, with disastrous consequences. By unpredictable, seemingly arbitrary but carefully calculated movements, Canning [...] "advances boldly to 'the deliverance of mankind'—into the hands of legitimate kings, but can do nothing to deliver them out of their power." [...] To support his point, Hazlitt observes that when Napoleon invaded Spain, Canning urged the British to march to war to support the liberty of the Spanish people. Yet, after Napoleon's defeat, when the Bourbon King Ferdinand was restored to the Spanish throne but then broke all his promises to abide by a constitutional government and turned into a brutal oppressor, Canning's argument was that it would be [...] "Quixotic" [...] to interfere in Spain's affairs in any attempt to support the Spanish people.|$|E
