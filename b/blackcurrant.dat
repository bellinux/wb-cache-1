5|$|As a crop, the <b>blackcurrant</b> {{suffers from}} several pests and diseases. The most serious disease is reversion, {{caused by a}} virus {{transmitted}} by the <b>blackcurrant</b> gall mite. Another is {{white pine blister rust}} which alternates between two unrelated hosts, one in the genus Ribes (<b>blackcurrant</b> included) and the other a white pine. This fungus caused damage to forests when the fruit was first introduced into North America, where the native white pines have no genetic resistance to the disease. As a result, the <b>blackcurrant</b> has for most of the 20th century been subject to restrictions in parts of the United States as a disease vector. The effectiveness of these restrictions is questionable, since other Ribes species also host the disease and are native to North America.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, most fruits rich in vitamin C, such as oranges, became {{difficult}} to obtain in the United Kingdom. Since <b>blackcurrant</b> berries are {{a rich source of}} the vitamin and <b>blackcurrant</b> plants are suitable for growing in the UK climate, the British Government encouraged their cultivation and soon the yield of the nation's crop increased significantly. From 1942 onwards, <b>blackcurrant</b> syrup was distributed free of charge to {{children under the age of}} two, and this may have given rise to the lasting popularity of <b>blackcurrant</b> as a flavouring in Britain. In Britain the commercial crop is completely mechanised and about 1,400 hectares of the fruit are grown, mostly under contract to the juicing industry. Commercially, most large-scale cultivation of blackcurrants is done in eastern Europe for the juice and juice concentrate market.|$|E

Sweetened vodka may also be infused with <b>blackcurrant</b> leaves making a deep greenish-yellow beverage with a tart flavour and astringent taste. The berries may be infused in a similar manner. In Britain, 95% of the blackcurrants grown end up in Ribena (a brand of fruit juice whose name is derived from Ribes nigrum) and similar fruit syrups and juices.|$|E
5|$|Major {{anthocyanins}} in <b>blackcurrant</b> pomace are delphinidin-3-O-glucoside, delphinidin-3-O-rutinoside, cyanidin-3-O-glucoside, and cyanidin-3-O-rutinoside {{which are}} {{retained in the}} juice concentrate among other yet unidentified polyphenols.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to investigate the stability of polyphenols and ascorbic acid in osmo-dried fruits: apples, sour cherries and <b>blackcurrants,</b> stored for 12 months. After 1 year of storage, the content of total polyphenols and anthocyanins in convectively dried <b>blackcurrants</b> was decreased by 45 % and 90 %, respectively. Flavonols remained highly stable. Convectively dried sour cherries contained particularly labile substances, including cyanidin derivatives, which content decreased by 98 % after 6 months. Polyphenols in freeze-dried materials were more stable. After 1 year of storage, their content remained at 60 - 80 % of the initial level. A high stability was in particular observed for delphinidin- 3 -rutinoside in <b>blackcurrants,</b> and cyanidin derivatives, chlorogenic acid, neochlorogenic acid and quercetin glucoside in sour cherries. The stability of ascorbic acid was also much higher in freeze-dried <b>blackcurrants</b> than in convectively dried fruit. After 1 year of storage, almost 70 % of ascorbic acid was preserved in freeze-dried material...|$|R

5|$|The <b>blackcurrant</b> leaf midge {{can cause}} browning, {{crimping}} and distortion of leaves at {{the tips of}} shoots but it is seldom a serious problem. The <b>blackcurrant</b> sawfly (Nematus ribesii) lays its eggs {{on the underside of}} the leaves and the voracious larvae work their way along the shoots, stripping off leaf after leaf. In a serious attack, the bush can be denuded of leaves. Larvae of the currant borer drill their way along the centres of shoots, which wilt and die back. Other insect pests include scale insects, aphids and earwigs.|$|E
5|$|The <b>blackcurrant</b> is {{native to}} {{northern}} Europe and Asia. It was cultivated in Russia by the 11th century when it was present in monastery gardens and also grown in towns and settlements. Cultivation in Europe {{is thought to have}} started around the last decades of the 17th century. Decoction of the leaves, bark or roots was also used as traditional remedies.|$|E

5|$|Animal-sourced foods (meat, fish, shellfish, fowl, eggs, dairy) provide zinc. The {{concentration}} of zinc in plants {{varies with the}} level in the soil. With adequate zinc in the soil, the food plants that contain the most zinc are wheat (germ and bran) and various seeds (sesame, poppy, alfalfa, celery, mustard). Zinc {{is also found in}} beans, nuts, almonds, whole grains, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds and <b>blackcurrant.</b> Plant phytates interfere with zinc absorption, so people consuming a vegetarian or vegan diet may need to increase zinc intake.|$|E
5|$|Reversion is {{a serious}} disease {{transmitted}} by the <b>blackcurrant</b> gall mite Cecidophyopsis ribis. It causes a decline in yield and is quite widespread in Europe but is rarely encountered on other continents. Symptoms include a modification of leaf shape in summer and swollen buds ("big bud") in winter, each housing thousands of microscopic mites. As pest control has limited effectiveness, severely infected bushes should be destroyed. All new plants purchased should be certified as virus-free.|$|E
5|$|The <b>blackcurrant</b> {{requires}} {{a number of}} essential nutrients to be present to enable it to thrive; nitrogen provides strong plant growth and stimulates the production of flower sprigs; phosphorus aids growth, the setting of fruit and crop yield; potassium promotes growth of individual shoots and increases the weight of individual fruits; magnesium is a constituent of chlorophyll and helps increase yields through interaction with potassium; calcium is required for cell division and enlargement and is particularly important for young plants and buds.|$|E

40|$|Introduction. Berries contain high {{amounts of}} dietary fibre and {{flavonoids}} {{and have been}} associated with improved metabolic health. The mechanisms are not clear but the formation of SCFAs, especially propionic and butyric acids, could be important. The potent antioxidant and antimicrobial properties of flavonoids could also be a factor, but little is known about their fate in the gastrointestinal tract. Aim. To compare how <b>blackcurrants,</b> blackberries, raspberries, and Lactobacillus plantarum HEAL 19 affect formation of SCFAs, inflammatory status, caecal microbial diversity, and flavonoids. Results and Conclusions. Degradation of the dietary fibre, formation of SCFAs including propionic and butyric acids, the weight of the caecal content and tissue, and the faecal wet and dry weight were all higher in rats fed <b>blackcurrants</b> rather than blackberries or raspberries. However, the microbial diversity of the gut microbiota was higher in rats fed raspberries. The high content of soluble fibre in <b>blackcurrants</b> and the high proportion of mannose-containing polymers might explain these effects. Anthocyanins could only be detected in urine of rats fed <b>blackcurrants,</b> and the excretion was lower with HEAL 19. No anthocyanins or anthocyanidins were detected in caecal content or blood. This may indicate uptake in the stomach or small intestine...|$|R
5|$|There {{are many}} cultivars of <b>blackcurrant.</b> 'Baldwin' was the {{mainstay}} of the industry for many years but it has now largely been superseded by more productive and disease-resistant varieties. During the 20th century in Europe, much hybridisation work {{has been carried out}} {{in order to reduce the}} plant's susceptibility to disease and frost and also to increase yields. This effort centred especially on Russia, Sweden and Scotland.|$|E
5|$|The ap√©ritif {{varies from}} region to region: Pastis is {{popular in the}} south of France, Cr√©mant d'Alsace in the eastern region. Champagne can also be served. Kir, also called Blanc-cassis, is a common and popular ap√©ritif-cocktail made with a measure of cr√®me de cassis (<b>blackcurrant</b> liqueur) topped up with white wine. The phrase Kir Royal is used when white wine is {{replaced}} with a Champagne wine. A simple glass of red wine, such as Beaujolais nouveau, can also be presented as an ap√©ritif, accompanied by amuse-bouches. Some ap√©ritifs can be fortified wines with added herbs, such as cinchona, gentian and vermouth. Trade names that sell well include Suze (the classic gentiane), Byrrh, Dubonnet, and Noilly Prat.|$|E
5|$|White pine blister rust (Cronartium ribicola) needs two {{alternate}} hosts {{to complete}} its lifecycle. One host is {{plants in the}} genus Ribes. On the <b>blackcurrant,</b> it causes the leaves to become pale and later develop tiny orange pustules and sometimes a yellow filamentous coating on some leaves. The fruit crop is little affected but the leaves fall early and growth is slowed the following year. The other host is any of the white pines, in which it causes serious disease and mortality for the North American species that have not co-evolved with the rust.|$|E

5|$|In {{the wine}} {{regions of the}} Left Bank, the Cabernet {{influence}} of the wine has shown unique characteristics in the different regions. In Saint-Est√®phe and Pessac-L√©ognan, the grape develops more mineral flavors. Aromas of violets are a characteristic of Margaux. Pauillac is noted by a strong lead pencil scent and Saint-Julien by cedar and cigar boxes. The Cabernet wines of the Moulis are characterized by their soft tannins and rich fruit flavors while the southern Graves region is characterized by strong <b>blackcurrant</b> flavors, though in less intense wines over all. The percentage of Cabernet Sauvignon used in the blend will depend on terroir and the winemakers styles {{as well as the}} vintage. The First Growth estates of Ch√¢teau Mouton Rothschild and Ch√¢teau Latour are noted for regularly producing wines with some of the highest percentage of Cabernet‚Äî often around 75%.|$|E
5|$|The {{fruit of}} {{blackcurrants}} can be eaten raw, {{but it has}} a strong, tart flavour. It can be made into jams and jellies which set readily because of the fruit's high content of pectin and acid. For culinary use, the fruit is usually cooked with sugar to produce a pur√©e, which can then be passed through muslin to separate the juice. The pur√©e {{can be used to make}} <b>blackcurrant</b> preserves and be included in cheesecakes, yogurt, ice cream, desserts, sorbets and many other sweet dishes. The exceptionally strong flavour can be moderated by combining it with other fruits, such as raspberries and strawberries in summer pudding, or apples in crumbles and pies. The juice can be used in syrups and cordials. Blackcurrants are a common ingredient of R√∏dgr√∏d, a popular kissel-like dessert in North German and Danish cuisines.|$|E
5|$|The grape's true origins were {{discovered}} in 1996 {{with the use of}} DNA typing at the UC Davis Department of Viticulture and Enology, by a team led by Dr. Carole Meredith. The DNA evidence determined that Cabernet Sauvignon was the offspring of Cabernet franc and Sauvignon blanc and was most likely a chance crossing that occurred in the 17th century. Prior to this discovery, this origin had been suspected from the similarity of the grapes' names and the fact that Cabernet Sauvignon shares similar aromas with both grapes‚Äîsuch as the <b>blackcurrant</b> and pencil box aromas of Cabernet franc and the grassiness of Sauvignon blanc. In 2016 scientists at the UC Davis announced they had sequenced a draft of the whole genome of the Cabernet Sauvignon grape, the first genome of a commercial wine-producing grape to be sequenced.|$|E
