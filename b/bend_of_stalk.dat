You are doubtless aware that the common nettle owes its stinging property to the innumerable stiff and needle-like, though exquisitely delicate, hairs which cover its surface. Each stinging-needle tapers from a broad base to a slender summit, which, though rounded at the end, is of such microscopic fineness that it readily penetrates, and breaks off in, the skin. The whole hair consists of a very delicate outer case of wood, closely applied to the inner surface of which is a layer of semi-fluid matter, full of innumerable granules of extreme minuteness. This semi-fluid lining is protoplasm, which thus constitutes a kind of bag, full of a limpid liquid, and roughly corresponding in form with the interior of the hair which it fills. When viewed with a sufficiently high magnifying power, the protoplasmic layer of the nettle hair is seen to be in a condition of unceasing activity. Local contractions of the whole thickness of its substance pass slowly and gradually from point to point, and give rise to the appearance of progressive waves, just as the <b>bending</b> <b>of</b> successive <b>stalks</b> <b>of</b> corn by a breeze produces the apparent billows of a cornfield.|$|R

The aim of the thesis is to provide a comprehensive view on the issue <b>of</b> <b>stalking</b> in a broader context than just the one of criminal justice, and to compare the crime <b>of</b> <b>stalking</b> under the Czech criminal law with selected foreign laws.

The second part attempts to analyse the crime <b>of</b> <b>stalking</b> itself. The first chapter deals with the definition <b>of</b> <b>stalking</b> while evaluating and refuting the myths associated to this phenomenon. Then a brief history of the term is mentioned, followed by the descriptions of different types <b>of</b> <b>stalking</b> conduct highlighting mainly the ex-partner stalking, cyberstalking and <b>stalking</b> <b>of</b> celebrities. The first chapter also explores the beginnings and development of the Czech anti-stalking legislation. The second chapter focuses on the stalker in terms of criminology and forensic psychology.

The author presents statistical data on the scope <b>of</b> <b>stalking</b> in the United States and Australia. The second part of the paper discusses different types of stalkers, whose distinctive features are analyzed in more detail. In particular, the author focuses on the causal link between the stalking crime and violence, as well as the victims' responses to their own victimization. In the next part of this article, the author provides a detailed analysis of a wide range <b>of</b> consequences <b>of</b> <b>stalking</b> crime. In some cases, the victim <b>of</b> <b>stalking</b> may become the perpetrator of a criminal act of murder, whereas the stalker becomes a victim of this serious form of homicide. Although these cases are not numerous, they call for further analysis and proposing new legal solutions related to the privileged forms of murder, which are aimed at improving the position of the victim <b>of</b> <b>stalking</b> who is the perpetrator of such homicide. Finally, the author argues in favour of incriminating a new type of felony - the crime <b>of</b> <b>stalking</b> (in line with the model envisaged in the criminal legislation of the Republic of Croatia), as well as a privileged homicide which may be designated as a murder of a stalker committed by a victim <b>of</b> <b>stalking...</b>|$|R
