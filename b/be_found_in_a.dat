5|$|Occasionally {{neuroblastoma}} {{may be due}} to a mutation {{inherited from}} a person's parents. Environmental factors have not been found to be involved. Diagnosis is based on a tissue biopsy. Occasionally it may <b>be</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> baby by ultrasound during pregnancy. At diagnosis the cancer has usually already spread. The cancer is divided into low, intermediate, and high risk groups based on a child's age, cancer stage, and what the cancer looks like.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{its wide}} range, the olive baboon can <b>be</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> number of {{different}} habitats. It is usually classified as savanna-dwelling, living in the wide plains of the grasslands. The grasslands, especially those near open woodland, do make up {{a large part of}} its habitat, but the baboon also inhabits rainforests and deserts. Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, for instance, both support olive baboon populations in dense tropical forests.|$|E

5|$|Zygoballus sexpunctatus is {{a species}} of jumping spider which occurs in the southeastern United States where it can <b>be</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> variety of grassy habitats. Adult spiders measure between 3 and 4.5mm in length. The {{cephalothorax}} and abdomen are bronze to black in color, with reddish brown or yellowish legs. The male has distinctive enlarged chelicerae (the mouthparts used for grasping prey) and front femora (the third, and typically largest, leg segments). Like many jumping spiders, Z. sexpunctatus males exhibit ritualized courtship and agonistic behavior.|$|E
5|$|According to Viktor Luneyev, the {{struggle}} against dissent operated on many more layers than those registered in court sentences. We {{do not know how}} many the secret services kept under surveillance, held criminally liable, arrested, sent to psychiatric hospitals, or who were sacked from their jobs, and restricted in all kinds of other ways in the exercise of their rights. No objective assessment {{of the total number of}} repressed persons is possible without fundamental analysis of archival documents. The difficulty is that the required data are very diverse and are not to <b>be</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> single archive. They are scattered between the State Archive of the Russian Federation, the archive of the Russian Federation State Statistical Committee (Goskomstat), the archives of the RF Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD of Russia), the FSB of Russia, the RF General Prosecutor's Office, and the Russian Military and Historical Archive. Further documents are held in the archives of 83 constituent entities of the Russian Federation, in urban and regional archives, as well as in the archives of the former Soviet Republics, now the 11 independent countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States or the three Baltic States (Baltics).|$|E
5|$|As a whole, {{pinnipeds}} can <b>be</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{variety of}} aquatic habitats, including coastal water, open ocean, brackish water and even freshwater lakes and rivers. Most species inhabit coastal areas, though some travel offshore and feed in deep waters off oceanic islands. The Baikal seal {{is the only}} freshwater species, though some ringed seals live in freshwater lakes in Russia close to the Baltic sea. In addition, harbor seals may visit estuaries, lakes and rivers and sometimes {{stay as long as}} a year. Other species known to enter freshwater include California sea lions and South American sea lions. Pinnipeds also use a number of terrestrial habitats and substrates, both continental and island. In temperate and tropical areas, they haul-out on to sandy and pebble beaches, rocky shores, shoals, mud flats, tide pools and in sea caves. Some species also rest on man-made structures, like piers, jetties, buoys and oil platforms. Pinnipeds may move further inland and rest in sand dunes or vegetation, and may even climb cliffs. Polar-living species haul-out on to both fast ice and drift ice.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time there was a change in castle architecture. Until the late 12thcentury castles {{generally}} had few towers; a gateway with few defensive features such as arrowslits or a portcullis; a great keep or donjon, usually square and without arrowslits; and the shape would have been dictated by {{the lay of the land}} (the result was often irregular or curvilinear structures). The design of castles was not uniform, but these were features that could <b>be</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> typical castle in the mid-12thcentury. By the end of the 12thcentury or the early 13thcentury, a newly constructed castle could be expected to be polygonal in shape, with towers at the corners to provide enfilading fire for the walls. The towers would have protruded from the walls and featured arrowslits on each level to allow archers to target anyone nearing or at the curtain wall.|$|E
5|$|Both species {{usually are}} solitary foragers, {{although}} the northern giant mouse lemur {{tends to be}} the most social, possibly due to its higher population density. Up to eight (typically four) adult males, adult females, and juveniles may <b>be</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> northern giant mouse lemur nest, whereas Coquerel's giant mouse lemurs do not nest communally, except when females share their nest with their offspring. Males do groom and call to females when they come into contact, and according to radio-tracking and direct observations at Analabe near Kirindy, they form pair bonds, sometimes briefly traveling together during the dry season. However, most interactions between adults are infrequent and typically occur later at night and particularly during the dry season in overlapping core areas, often involving chases and other agonistic behavior, and only rarely social grooming. During the mating season, males act aggressively towards one another, pulling out fur around the head and shoulders and biting the head.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{modernity and}} {{the merit of}} the works {{produced}} {{and the ability of}} its protagonists, the historiography of Renaissance sculpture in Brescia was never able to win the honors of artistic and literary culture, neither at the time, nor in the following centuries, being forgotten even by the local sources. The main cause is to <b>be</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> long series of errors and omissions that occurred in the critical literature from the earliest days until the twentieth century, which led to the misunderstanding of the cultural level and quality achieved by the Brescia school during the thirty years from the turn of the fifteenth century, and the oblivion of its main characters.|$|E

5|$|India's first {{records of}} {{smallpox}} can <b>be</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> medical book {{that dates back}} to A.D. 400. This book describes a disease that sounds exceptionally like smallpox. India, like China, created a goddess in response to its exposure to smallpox. The Hindu goddess Shitala was both worshipped and feared during her reign. It was believed that this goddess was both evil and kind and had the ability to inflict victims when angered, as well as calm the fevers of the already afflicted. Portraits of the goddess show her holding a broom in her right hand to continue to move the disease and a pot of cool water in the other hand in an attempt to soothe victims. Shrines were created where many India natives, both healthy and not, went to worship and attempt to protect themselves from this disease. Some Indian women, in an attempt to ward off Shitala, placed plates of cooling foods and pots of water on the roofs of their homes.|$|E
5|$|Like many English {{football}} clubs, Aston Villa {{have had}} several hooligan firms associated with them: Villa Youth, Steamers, Villa Hardcore and the C-Crew, the last mentioned being very active during the 1970s and 1980s. As {{can be seen}} across the whole of English football, the hooligan groups have now been marginalised. In 2004, several Villa firms {{were involved in a}} fight with QPR fans outside Villa Park in which a steward died. The main groupings of supporters can now <b>be</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> number of domestic and international supporters' clubs. This includes the Official Aston Villa Supporters Club which also has many smaller regional and international sections. There were several independent supporters clubs during the reign of Doug Ellis but most of these disbanded after his retirement. The supporter group My Old Man Said formed to stand up for Villa supporters' rights, {{as a direct result of}} Villa supporters' protest against the club's appointment of Alex McLeish. The club's supporters also publish fanzines such as Heroes and Villains and The Holy Trinity.|$|E

5|$|Transversal {{filters are}} not usually {{associated}} with passive implementations but the concept can <b>be</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Wiener and Lee patent from 1935 which describes a filter consisting of a cascade of all-pass sections. The outputs of the various sections are summed in the proportions needed to result in the required frequency function. This works by the principle that certain frequencies will be in, or close to antiphase, at different sections and will tend to cancel when added. These are the frequencies rejected by the filter and can produce filters with very sharp cut-offs. This approach {{did not find any}} immediate applications, and is not common in passive filters. However, the principle finds many applications as an active delay line implementation for wide band discrete-time filter applications such as television, radar and high-speed data transmission.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{the striped}} hyena, {{for which a}} number of {{subspecies}} were proposed in light of its extensive modern range, the spotted hyena is a genuinely variable species, both temporally and spatially. Its range once encompassed almost all of Africa and Eurasia, and displayed a large degree of morphological geographic variation, which led to an equally extensive set of specific and subspecific epithets. It was gradually realised {{that all of this}} variation could be applied to individual differences in a single subspecies. In 1939, biologist L. Harrison Matthews demonstrated through comparisons between a large selection of spotted hyena skulls from Tanzania that all the variation seen in the then recognised subspecies could also <b>be</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> single population, with the only set of characters standing out being pelage (which is subject to a high degree of individual variation) and size (which is subject to Bergmann's Rule). When fossils are taken into consideration, the species displayed even greater variation than it does in modern times, and a number of these named fossil species have since been classed as synonymous with Crocuta crocuta, with firm evidence of there being more than one species within the genus Crocuta still lacking.|$|E
5|$|During 2009, Steven Goodman {{and colleagues}} {{published}} two papers that found {{a total of}} five genetically and morphologically distinct species within Miniopterus manavi as defined by Peterson and colleagues (1995), up to four of which can <b>be</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> single locality. In order to determine the true identity of M.manavi, Goodman and Claude Maminirina obtained bats near the type locality of M.manavi (the site where the original material was collected, from which the species was described) for inclusion in the analysis; they also sequenced one of Thomas's original specimens. Among the five species they identified, M.griveaudi occurs on Grande Comore and Anjouan and in northern and western Madagascar; M.aelleni occurs on Anjouan and in northern and western Madagascar; M.brachytragos is found in northern Madagascar only; M.mahafaliensis is confined to the southwestern part of the island; and M.manavi itself is known only from {{the eastern edge of the}} Central Highlands. These five species are not each other's closest relatives according to analyses of cytochrome b sequences and their similarities reflect convergent evolution. Cytochrome b suggested that the closest relative of M.manavi is the slightly larger M.petersoni from southeastern Madagascar. Two specimens of M.manavi differed by 1.3% in their cytochrome b sequences and by 2.5% from M.petersoni.|$|E
