5|$|Spirited Away {{contains}} critical {{commentary on}} modern Japanese society concerning generational conflicts and environmental issues. Chihiro has <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> {{a representation of}} the shōjo, whose roles and ideology had changed dramatically since post-war Japan.|$|E
5|$|While sharks had <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> harmless, the {{pendulum}} {{of public opinion}} quickly swung to the other extreme, and sharks quickly came to be viewed not only as eating machines, but also as fearless, ruthless killers.|$|E
5|$|Although the Act {{was largely}} ineffective, it has <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> {{the first piece}} of Health & Safety legislation, leading the way to {{subsequent}} regulations covering industrial workplaces; its requirement for factory walls to be whitewashed continued to be a legal requirement until the Factories Act 1961.|$|E
50|$|It <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> {{inferior}} to the West. It <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> barbaric, irrational, primitive, and sexist.|$|R

5|$|An {{alcoholic}} and womanizer, Kunichika also portrayed women deemed beautiful (bijinga), contemporary social life, {{and a few}} landscapes and historical scenes. He worked successfully in the Edo period, and carried those traditions into the Meiji period. To his contemporaries and now to some modern art historians, this has <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a significant achievement during a transitional period of great social and political change in Japan's history.|$|E
5|$|Branch's music {{regularly}} expresses {{religious and}} political themes emphasizing American exceptionalism. Her music has been well received among conservative commentators {{and members of the}} Tea Party movement for its political message. The use of Branch's music in the campaigns of Cain and Santorum has <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> an indication of its appeal among outsider candidates. She has released nine singles and an EP, and is working on her debut album for release in 2013.|$|E
5|$|Brideshead Revisited (1981), {{based on}} Waugh's novel; a miniseries {{enormously}} popular in Britain and America, {{the film has}} sometimes <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> drawing unwanted attention to Oxford's stereotypical reputation as a playground for the upper class. It stars Jeremy Irons and most college shots are of Christ Church and Hertford.|$|E
50|$|Schumpeterian rent <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> {{a form of}} {{economic}} rent, although Schumpeterian rent may <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> an incentive towards greater economic inefficiency.|$|R

5|$|Plant {{species of}} concern at the Darby Creek Mouth Mudflat include Amaranthus cannabinus, Baccharis halimifolia, Bidens bidentoides, Bidens laevis, Eleocharis obtusa, Eleocharis parvula, Heteranthera multiflora, Lycopus rubellus, Pluchea odorata, Sagittaria calycina, Sagittaria subulata, Schoenoplectus fluviatilis, and Zizania aquatica. Some, such as Eleocharis obtusa, Eleocharis parvula, and Heteranthera multiflora, {{have not been}} seen since 1994. However, four other species have <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> {{recently}} as 2009.|$|E
5|$|Sociology {{of leisure}} {{is a fairly}} recent {{subfield}} of sociology, compared to more traditional subfields such as sociology of work, sociology of the family, and sociology of education: it saw most of its development {{in the second half}} of the 20th century. Until then, leisure had often <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a relatively unimportant, minor feature of society. Leisure is now recognized as a major social institution, deserving of serious sociological inquiry, particularly in Western societies.|$|E
5|$|The Bororo {{people of}} Mato Grosso in central Brazil {{regarded}} the constellation as a land tortoise Geriguigui, while the Tucano {{people of the}} northwestern Amazon region saw it as an egret. To the Tupi people of São Luís Island in Brazil, Corvus might have <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a grill or barbecue—seychouioura, on which fish were grilled. The depiction could have also referred to the Great Square of Pegasus.|$|E
50|$|Chen <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> {{a senior}} member of the Shanghai clique who worked with former CPC General secretary, President Jiang Zemin and <b>were</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> rivals to current CPC General secretary, President Hu Jintao. The {{dismissals}} <b>were</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> strengthening the authority of Hu within the party and weakening the Jiang loyalists.|$|R
50|$|Independence can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> {{a special}} kind of {{conditional}} independence, since probability can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a kind of conditional probability given no events.|$|R
5000|$|Faith as contradicting rationality: In this view, faith <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> {{those views}} that one holds despite {{evidence}} and reason to the contrary. Accordingly, faith <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> pernicious {{with respect to}} rationality, as it interferes with our ability to think, and inversely rationality <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> the enemy of faith by interfering with our beliefs.|$|R
5|$|The {{arrival of}} Ronaldinho in 2003, and Barcelona's {{subsequent}} success in La Liga and Champions League, has <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> crucial {{to an increase}} in the national, and worldwide, fan-base of the club. This development of a larger national fan-base has created friction between the Catalan nationalist supporters, who wish to secede from Spain, and the club's other Spanish supporters.|$|E
5|$|The {{battle at}} Catraeth has <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> {{an attempt to}} resist the advance of the Angles, who had {{probably}} by then occupied the former Votadini lands of Bryneich in modern north-eastern England and made it their kingdom of Bernicia. At some time after the battle, the Angles absorbed the Gododdin kingdom, possibly {{after the fall of}} their capital Din Eidyn in 638, and incorporated it into the kingdom of Northumbria.|$|E
5|$|This {{letter is}} seen as the final salvo in the Drapier's fight against Wood's patent. Although there was a {{possible}} agreement between Carteret and Walpole over ending the patent, Swift found it necessary to publish this defence of the fourth letter to ensure that Walpole would not back down from his promise of removing the patent. It has also <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a letter celebrating Harding's release from being tried for printing the Drapier's letters.|$|E
5000|$|In Tamil, {{the word}} vel means spear that <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> the weapon of Hindu god Murugan and oor means place. As per Hindu legend, Murugan <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a tribal hunter who {{appeared}} in a lotus pond with his weapon to attack the enemies. Thus [...] "Vellore" [...] <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> the place where Murugan appeared.|$|R
50|$|A tagged union can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> the {{simplest}} kind of self-describing data format.The tag of the tagged union can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> {{the simplest}} kind of metadata.|$|R
50|$|The crossed square cupola may <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> {{a part of}} some uniform polyhedra. For example, {{the great}} cubicuboctahedron may <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> six crossed square cupolae {{connected}} at their triangular faces, while the nonconvex great rhombicuboctahedron may <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a blend of six cupolae. Additionally, the nonconvex great rhombicuboctahedron may <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> an octagrammic prism with the octagrams excavated with crossed square cupolae, similarly to how the rhombicuboctahedron may <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> an octagonal prism with the octagons augmented with square cupolae. Rotating one of the cupolae in this construction results in the pseudo-great rhombicuboctahedron. To this may be added the great rhombihexahedron, as the exclusive or of {{all three of these}} octagrammic prisms which may be used to construct the nonconvex great rhombicuboctahedron.|$|R
5|$|WrestleMania X was {{the first}} edition of the event not to include Hulk Hogan, who had <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> the public face of the WWF; {{following}} Hogan's 1993 departure, that role had shifted to Bret Hart. The card also marked Randy Savage's last televised match for the company.|$|E
5|$|A WiiWare launch {{title in}} all regions, it was {{released}} on March 25, 2008 in Japan, May 12, 2008 in North America, and May 20, 2008 in Europe. The game costs 1500 Wii Points. Reviews of the game were generally favorable, and it has <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> {{one of the most}} innovative games released on the WiiWare service. A followup, , was announced at a Nintendo keynote speech at the Game Developers Conference 2009, and was a tower defense game that was also met with positive reviews.|$|E
5|$|Aborigines were {{represented}} by eight members out of 225 {{seats in the}} Legislative Yuan. In 2008, the number of legislative seats was cut in half to 113, of which Taiwanese aborigines are represented by six members, three each for lowland and highland peoples. The tendency of Taiwanese aborigines to vote {{for members of the}} pan-blue coalition has been cited as having the potential to change the balance of the legislature. Citing these six seats in addition with five seats from smaller counties that also tend to vote pan-blue has <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> giving the pan-blue coalition 11 seats before the first vote is counted.|$|E
40|$|When {{modelling}} a domain, it {{is often}} the case that certain individuals are represented as belonging to multiple categories, generating therefore "tangled" hierarchies: 1. A physical object can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> an amount of matter 2. A hole can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a region of space 3. A building can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a place 4. A biological organ can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> an aggregate of molecules 5. An association can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a group of people 6. A physical object can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a temporal process This phenomenon is quite common: the examples above have been taken from existing toplevel ontologies used in practice, and they are responsible, in our opinion, of many situations of tangleness, confusion, and lack of semantic rigour. We advocate in the present paper a design principle aimed to clarify such situations and produce more reusable and well-founded ontologies. It can be stated as follows: Ontological Distinction Principle: Classes corresponding to different ident...|$|R

5|$|Allan Ramsay {{studied in}} Sweden, London and Italy before basing himself in Edinburgh, where he {{established}} himself as a leading portrait painter to the Scottish nobility and he undertook portraits of many of the major figures of the Scottish Enlightenment, including his friend the philosopher David Hume and the visiting Jean-Jacques Rousseau. After a second visit to Italy he moved to London in 1757 and from 1761 he was Principal Painter in Ordinary to George III. He now focused on royal portraits, often presented by the king to ambassadors and colonial governors. His work has <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> anticipating the grand manner of Joshua Reynolds, but many of his early portraits, particularly of women, are less formal and more intimate studies.|$|E
5|$|Almost every {{sizeable}} body {{of water}} in Scotland has an associated kelpie story, but the most extensively reported is that of Loch Ness. Parallels to the general Germanic neck and the Scandinavian bäckahäst have been observed. More widely, the wihwin of Central America and the Australian bunyip have <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> counterparts. The origin of the belief in malevolent water horses has been proposed as originating in human sacrifices once made to appease gods associated with water, but narratives about the kelpie also served a practical purpose in keeping children away from dangerous stretches of water, and warning young women {{to be wary of}} handsome strangers.|$|E
5|$|Ammianus {{is silent}} about archers on the Alamanni side. The Germans almost {{certainly}} did not have mounted archers, as this was an arm that evolved in the East and in any case, their longbows are unsuitable for use on horseback. As for the infantry, the archery capability of the Rhine Germans has traditionally <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> negligible, due to the 6th-century writer Agathias's comment that the Franks {{did not know how}} to use bows. But this is contradicted by the archaeological record and by Ammianus himself in other parts of his account. It is virtually certain that there were a significant number of Alamanni foot archers at Strasbourg.|$|E
50|$|After WWII {{women were}} {{discouraged}} from entering into engineering. During the war, their efforts <b>were</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a patriotic duty. After the war, women in engineering <b>were</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> an abnormality.|$|R
