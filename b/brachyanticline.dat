40|$|Tyt. z nagłówka. Bibliogr. s. 556. The "Z" {{natural gas}} field {{is located in the}} {{southern}} part of the Fore-Sudetic Monocline, in the western part of Poland. Rotliegend sandstones, characterized by good reservoir properties are located in the Polish part of the Southern Permian Basin (Gast et al. 2010). The "Z" gas deposit was discovered in 1978. Reservoir "Z" structure is a regular, oval <b>brachyanticline.</b> The culminations are separated by a shallow depression in which the top of Rotliegend complex is located at depth somewhat less than - 1275 m bsl. Massive type accumulation covers about 25 km and shows a height up to about 105 m (Karnkowski 1999). 3 D static modelling was performed using Petrel software from Schlumberger. Typical workflows for modelling of oil and gas reservoirs were applied (e. g. Zakrevsky 2011). Structural model was created by 100 m x 100 m grid increment. Ten proportional layers of reservoir zone were set resulting in model composed of over 1, 000, 000 cells. The base case model assumed gas/water contact at 1345 m bsl. These models were result of geostatistical simulation based on Kriging technique. The quality and number of the input data used to develop parametric models play a major role. The most important parameters characterizing the reservoir rocks are: porosity, permeability and shale volume (vshale). Average petrophysical parameters based on base case model in the area are: 15 % for porosity, 45 mD for permeability and 14 % for vshale. Performed structural-parametric models of the Żuchlów gas field can be successfully used for dynamic simulation and reserves estimation. Dostępny również w formie drukowanej.

40|$|We {{have studied}} four mud volcano fields located in eastern Sicily, around the Mt. Etna edifice. Three {{of them are}} located on the {{southern}} flank of Etna, between the Paternò and Belpasso villages and, based of their location, are named “Salinelle dei Cappuccini”, “Salinelle del Fiume” and “Salinelle del Vallone Salato”. Their genesis is connected with a structural trap formed by a <b>brachyanticline</b> of Pleistocene clays that form the Etna basement. The fourth one {{is located on the}} farest north-eastern part of Etna, along the Ionian coastline, and it is named “Salsa di Fondachello” after the name of the closest village. Geologic surveys and drilling data allow us to say that in “Salinelle dei Cappuccini” and “Salinelle del Fiume” fluids uprise through pre-existing volcanic necks, while in “Salinelle del Vallone Salato” fluids presumably uprise through a fault plane. The morphological evolution of these mud volcano fields depends mainly on the density of the emitted muds and secondarily on preexisting features of the ground surface. Chemical analyses revealed that the water coming out from the mud volcanoes is a fossil marine water hosted in the Miocene sedimentary rocks of the Mt. Etna basement. CO 2 is the most abundant escaping gas, and it is mainly of magmatic origin: its amount and rate could be related to movements of the deep Etna magma. The activity of the “Salsa di Fondachello” mud volcano started on January 11 th, 1693, associated with the destructive Val di Noto earthquake. The mud volcano was again active from 1795 to 1832. At the end of its last activity, started in March 1847, an earthquake occurred and the mud volcano collapsed. Today only a weak methane emission is evidence of endogenous activity...|$|E
40|$|The tectono-stratigraphic {{framework}} of the southern Montefeltro is illustrative {{of the interaction between}} thin-skinned shearing and sedimentation in the outer segment of the Apenninic orogenic system during the Neogene. Mesozoic through Paleogene evaporitic-carbonatic-marly terrains constitute the lower part of its autochthonous sedimentary cover. This Umbro-Marchean Sequence compares with deposits of the contiguous Adriatic Foreland. Structural style is characterized by longitudinal chains of <b>brachyanticlines</b> more or less intensely dissected by stepped thrusts rooted in a common sole fault. The Neogene clastics of the overlying Umbro-Romagnan Sequence are arranged in broad synclines separated by complex highs developed over shallow detachment levels. The pronounced lateral variability of these foredeep deposits argues the synsedimentary origin of the structural pattern. More internal detached Umbro-Romagnan terrains define a parautochthonous thrust sheet composed of synclinal elements bounded by listric reverse faults. The formation of these shallow structures was determined by migratory subsidence in consequence of crustal imbrication. The synsedimentary orogenic paroxysm was complicated by the emplacement of a voluminous glide mass. This Montefeltro Colata principally consists of teleallochthonous terrains derived from the innermost segment of the Apenninic system. Semi- and peneallochthonous elements originated on the mobile allochthon as this advanced toward the Adriatic Foreland. The phased progress of the Montefeltro Colata was gUided by bulges bordering a transversal depression which resulted from the interaction between the mobile allochthon and the thin-skinned tectonics of its UmbroMarchean- Romagnan substratum. Neoautochthonous deposits suture the structural edifice on the outer side of the Apenninic oroge...|$|R
40|$|When Buxtorf in 1907 {{proposed}} his décollement hypothesis which visualized the Jura fold belt as a “folded décollement nappe” {{pushed by}} the Alps, he met with both fervent support of a few and skepticism by the many. As an illustration of recalcitrant problems within the Jura décollement nappe, that remain after 100 years, {{a model of the}} Grenchenberg complex is presented within the frame of 3 D décollement kinematics, based on a set of rules gleaned from recurrent features in the Jura: (1) that generally progression of décollement was in sequence from south to north, (2) that in any given structure thrusting (with attendant ramp folding) preceded more generalized folding, (3) that progression of décollement was held up at “anchor points” (asperities) where the emerging thrusts and folds developed inflections with dextral transpression in the western and sinistral transpresssion in the eastern flank, (4) that at such asperities more southerly structures, riding piggyback on the moving décollement sheet, often collided with more northerly ones and even merged with them. The asperities occur on fault/flexure lines of Paleogene origin, the Pierre Pertuis anchor point on the Vicques and the Grenchenberg extended anchor domain on the “Schwarzwald” Line (the continuation of the eastern border of the Rhinegraben). These lines produced deformations of the décollement surface in the middle Triassic evaporites which acted as boundary conditions at the bottom boundary of the décollement nappe, which led to stress concentrations and the nucleation of faults. Although it is now widely recognized that these lines were reactivated during late Miocene Jura décollement, it ought to be stressed that this reactivation affected the décollement nappe only and there individual asperities or groups of asperities rather than the lines as a whole. Because in the course of nappe displacement the originally autochthonous asperities as expressed in the sedimentary cover moved into an allochthonous position, their original autochthonous location in the basement has to be found by retrodeformation enabled by a map-aspect kinematic model. The Grenchenberg structure developed by collision of the Montoz and Chasseral ranges and was affected by at least three different anchors. At one of these anchors a belt of <b>brachyanticlines</b> developed along which material was dextrally transferred from the Montoz- to the Chasseral fold, resulting in the disappearance of the former and the strengthening of the latter, which in turn merged with the rising Weissenstein fold...|$|R
40|$|The Levang granite {{forms an}} {{elliptical}} body occupying {{the core of}} a broad antiformal structure, and covering approximately 50 sq. km. Surrounding this mass of granitoid gneisses is a series of banded gneisses of very variable composition, including amphibolites, quartzltes, and nodular sillimanite gneisses. Against these rocks the granitic gneisses make a sharp, though in places 'interfingered' contact. Agmatitl relationships are never seen. Further south, on the PortOr sub-peninsula, migmatitic granitoid gneisses are exposed which have mineral assemblages identical to those of rock types from within the main Levang granite. The composition of the Levang granite gneisses is variable, ranging from quartz monzonltic to tonalitic types lacking potash feldspar, but on the whole corresponds fairly closely with the minimum melting composition of the granite system. Over much the greater area the Levang granite is strongly foliated, and everywhere shows some degree of preferred planar or linear orientation of minerals. The foliation always parallels the contacts, and it defines a complex fold system, within the granite which is in complete structural conformity with that of the surrounding banded gneisses and migmatites. The overall symmetry of the structure is triclinic, the plunge of the linear elements varying from horizontal to vertical. The β axis of the domal structure {{in the eastern part of}} the granite mass is completely overturned. Traced eastwards from the core of the dome, P trends initially due east north east, steepens to vertical, and then plunges due west at angles of 60 to 70. The very complex tectonic evolution has probably involved disharmonic folding and two phases of deformation. Within the Levang granite amphibolitic sheets and lenses are invariably conformable to the fold pattern defined by the granite gneiss foliation. In the Helligesvann <b>brachyanticline,</b> a regular sequence of granitoid gneisses of variable composition, interlayered with a thick amphibolitic sheet which forms an unbroken horizon, indicates the presence of a 'ghost' stratigraphy. Investigation of the potash feldspar obliquities shows that all the potash feldspars, from granitic gneisses, migmatites, and pegmatites, are more or less fully ordered maximum microclines. The fact that some of the granitic gneisses approximate to the minimum melting composition is not conclusive evidence in favour of an origin through anatexis or fractional crystallization, in view of the spatial distribution of these rocks, their metamorphic textures, and the nature of the basic inclusions. The Levang granite is a metamorphic rock, the result of the transformation in an open system of a pre-existing series of supra- crustal rocks by processes of granitization and metasomatism...|$|E
