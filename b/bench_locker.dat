Furniture would consist of padded seating, with pads at shoulder height to protect the guard from the inevitable jolts and jerks ('snatches') of freight work, at the duckets; the guard would sit here for protection while the train was moving, unless absolutely necessary. He could reach the brake wheel from that position. This padded seat would be on top of a <b>bench</b> <b>locker</b> that stretched the entire side of one side of the van and half of the other (the side which the stove). A further padded seat was provided {{at the end of this}} <b>bench</b> <b>locker</b> where there was a small desk for the guard to perform whatever written work was necessary ...|$|E

They signed a two-year rent deal with Reggiana, which manages the venue. The agreement struck with Reggiana also included infrastructural improvements, including new <b>benches</b> and <b>locker</b> rooms, along {{with the development of}} new marketing and trade policies, which aimed {{to take advantage of the}} business opportunities that come with the club's Serie A promotion. The stadium was consequently renamed Mapei Stadium - Citt√† del Tricolore.The stadium hosted the 2016 UEFA Women's Champions League Final.|$|R

Between April and August 2015, four 4-foot by 7-foot {{sections of the}} hull at the waterline were cleaned, scaled to bare metal, and treated with ceramic epoxy and new bottom paint. This was accomplished using a custom-made mobile surface-piercing cofferdam. In 2017 the Museum replaced Olympia's old gangways for easier and safer access, restored the signal bridge, restored the Admiral and Captain's skylights, and constructed replicas of historic <b>benches,</b> mess <b>lockers</b> and mess tables.|$|R
5000|$|The third act of {{the show}} starts with a second {{interlude}} exposed on the video screen, showing Grande in blonde hair and a leotard posing provocatively as feminist words are displayed: [...] "empowered", [...] "strong", [...] "grounded", [...] "centered", [...] "connected", [...] "not asking for it" [...] (which repeats multiple times), [...] "free", [...] "soulful", [...] "divine", [...] "gentle", [...] "ferocious", [...] "sexual", [...] "sensual", [...] "human" [...] and [...] "female". Grande then ascends from the stage wearing a gray bra and a skirt with straps with her dancers on stationary bikes on a platform to perform [...] "Side to Side". The stage transforms into a gymnasium with <b>lockers,</b> <b>benches</b> and a chin-up bar. Rapper Nicki Minaj is shown on the video screen in scenes reminiscent from the official music video during her verse. Grande then performs a remixed version of [...] "Bang Bang" [...] with extreme lighting visual effects. The show follows with [...] "Greedy". During the performance, fake money (which features Grande's face) falls onto the audience. The song then transitions into [...] "Focus", which is then performed with the screen showing some scenes from the music video. Grande then performs [...] "I Don't Care", which closes the third act. Grande leaves the stage as the band performs an outro for the song.|$|R

The recent and relatively unknown art form of graffiti knitting (GK) refers to the act of installing yarn-based products in public spaces {{in such a way that}} gently provokes sociopolitical and cultural dialogue. This qualitative study explores and analyzes the potential of GK as a cooperative, change-oriented or praxis-learning tool for a public-school art program. Few academic studies exist on GK and no studies have been focused on how graffiti knitting can impact interaction between high school students. The researcher's unit introduced male and female students in grades 9 through 12 to knitting and to GK, and it culminated in installations around the school environment of knitted products on <b>benches,</b> computer stands, <b>lockers,</b> and other high-visibility semi or permanent structures. Students who participated in the unit installations of GK voluntarily engaged in a round-table discussion. Their responses indicated that the process of learning to knit and the repetitive nature of the skill fostered a calm, collaborative space where students largely took over the teaching of knitting. Their responses also indicated that the act of GK impacted many of the participants' views on self-reliance in a consumerist society and challenged their largely conventional views on gender roles. Finally, their responses suggested that the experience of learning about, sharing, and engaging in GK altered the students' perception of the role and value of craft art in society. Learning and doing GK gave students an insider's view of the power of collaboration within an art community and provided them with a direct, empowering observation of strangers who encountered and reacted to their art. Feedback from participants in the GK unit largely supported the value of constructivist theories of learning, where the most beneficial learning is argued to happen when learners take responsibility for the learning of others. The GK artwork that students created was less important than the social changes that took place. That is, the key value of the unit wasn't so much the physical art produced by participants, it was the community developed among the students that grew inside the classroom and extended into the hallways and streets where the art was being experienced by both the makers and viewers. 2031 - 01 - 0...|$|R
