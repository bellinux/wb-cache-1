5|$|Silicon carbide is a {{semiconductor}} {{in research}} and early mass production providing advantages for fast, high-temperature and/or high-voltage devices. The first devices available were Schottky diodes, followed by junction-gate FETs and MOSFETs for high-power switching. Bipolar transistors and thyristors are currently developed. A major problem for SiC commercialization has been the elimination of defects: edge dislocations, screw dislocations (both hollow and closed core), triangular defects and <b>basal</b> <b>plane</b> dislocations. As a result, devices made of SiC crystals initially displayed poor reverse blocking performance though researchers have been tentatively finding solutions to improve the breakdown performance. Apart from crystal quality, problems with the interface of SiC with silicon dioxide have hampered the development of SiC-based power MOSFETs and insulated-gate bipolar transistors. Although the mechanism is still unclear, nitridation has dramatically reduced the defects causing the interface problems. In 2008, the first commercial JFETs rated at 1200 V {{were introduced to the}} market, followed in 2011 by the first commercial MOSFETs rated at 1200 V. Beside SiC switches and SiC Schottky diodes (also Schottky barrier diode, SBD) in the popular TO-247 and TO-220 packages, companies started even earlier to implement the bare chips into their power electronic modules. SiC SBD diodes found wide market spread being used in PFC circuits and IGBT power modules.|$|E

40|$|Nano-indentations into Ti 3 SiC 2 grains {{with their}} <b>basal</b> <b>planes</b> either {{oriented}} parallel or perpendicular {{with respect to}} the surface were performed. These grains were {{selected on the basis of}} orientation imaging microscopy (OIM). Scanning electron microscopy analysis of the indentations clearly showed that for grains whose <b>basal</b> <b>planes</b> are oriented parallel to the surface the elastic recovery and hardness values are lower, the plastic deformation larger, and the pile up around the indents larger than for the perpendicular orientation. These observations are explained by the deformation mechanism, i. e. kink-band formation that operates at room temperature in Ti 3 SiC 2. Kink bands are more easily formed during indentations when the <b>basal</b> <b>planes</b> are parallel to the surface. For comparison indentations were also performed in 6 H-SiC with the <b>basal</b> <b>planes</b> parallel and perpendicular to the surface. For 6 H-SiC the results are identical for both orientations, apart from the initial peak hardness and modulus that occur during loading for small indenter depths. In both Ti 3 SiC 2 and 6 H-SiC these initial peak values for both properties are lower when the <b>basal</b> <b>planes</b> are oriented perpendicular or edge on to the surface. This is attributed to the cleavage fracture between <b>basal</b> <b>planes</b> that occur under the indenter tip for the perpendicular orientation initially during loading. Some results of the High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy analysis of stacking faults in Ti 3 SiC 2 and Conventional TEM analysis of dislocation walls in kink bands invoked during indentation are also shown. From the TEM observations of wedge cracks, the shear and normal stresses that resulted in these cracks are estimated and found to be in agreement with the estimates derived from the nano-indentation experiments.

500|$|Sapphires are a color {{variety of}} corundum, a {{crystalline}} form of aluminium oxide (...) [...] Corundum {{is one of}} the hardest minerals, rating9 on the Mohs scale. Corundum gems of most colors are called sapphires, except for red ones, which are called rubies. The term [...] "Yogo sapphire" [...] refers only to sapphires from the Yogo Gulch. [...] The cornflower blue color of the Yogo results from trace amounts of iron and titanium. Yogo sapphires are unique in that they are free of cavities and inclusions, have high uniform clarity, lack color zoning, and do not need heat treating because their cornflower blue coloring is uniform and deep. Unlike Asian sapphires, they maintain their brilliance in artificial light. Yogos present an advantage to gemcutters: since they are found as primary constituent minerals within an igneous bedrock rather than in sedimentary alluvial deposits where most other sapphires are located, they retain a perfect or near perfect crystalline shape, making cutting much easier, as does their lack of inclusions, color zoning, or cloudiness. Yogos also exhibit a triangular pattern on the <b>basal</b> <b>plane</b> of the flattened crystals, with thin rhombohedral crystal faces, a feature absent in sapphires from other parts of Montana.|$|E

40|$|Scenario-based risk {{assessment}} for rockfalls, requires assumptions for different scenarios of magnitude (volume). The magnitude of such instabilities {{is related to}} the properties of the jointed rock mass, with the characteristics of the existing unfavourably dipping joint sets playing a major role. The critical factors for the determination of the maximum credible rockfall volume in a study site, the Forat Negre in Andorra, are investigated. The results from two previous analyses for the rockfall size distribution at this site are discussed. The first analysis provides the observed size distribution of the rockfall scars, and it is an empirical evidence of past rockfalls. The second one, calculates the kinematically detachable rock masses, indicating hypothetical rockfalls that might occur in the future. The later gives a maximum rockfall volume, which is one order of magnitude higher, because the persistence of the <b>basal</b> <b>planes</b> is overestimated. The tension cracks and lateral planes interrupt systematically the <b>basal</b> <b>planes,</b> exerting a control over their persistence, and restricting the formation of extensive planes and large rockfall failures. Nonetheless, the formation of <b>basal</b> <b>planes</b> across more than one spacings of tension cracks is possible and small step-path failures have been observed too. Concluding, the key factor for the determination of the maximum credible volume at the study-site is the maximum realistic length of the <b>basal</b> <b>planes,</b> penetrating into the rock mass, their spacing, and, if applied, the contribution of the rock bridges to the overall rock mass resistance.

50|$|The {{fundamental}} {{advantage of}} an integrated graphene-CNT structure is the high surface area three-dimensional framework of the CNTs coupled with the high edge density of graphene. Graphene edges provide significantly higher charge density and reactivity than the <b>basal</b> <b>plane,</b> but they are difficult to arrange in a three-dimensional, high volume-density geometry. CNTs are readily aligned in a high density geometry (i.e., a vertically aligned forest) but lack high charge density surfaces—the sidewalls of the CNTs {{are similar to the}} <b>basal</b> <b>plane</b> of graphene and exhibit low charge density except where edge defects exist. Depositing a high density of graphene foliates along the length of aligned CNTs can significantly increase the total charge capacity per unit of nominal area as compared to other carbon nanostructures.|$|E

40|$|Carbon {{formed by}} the {{catalytic}} decomposition of carbon monoxide was studied by thermogravimetric analysis and transmission electron microscope (TEM) examination of the carbon formations. The influence of hydrogen on carbon formation morphology became clear, based on results of catalytic CO disproportionation {{with little or no}} hydrogen present. A new mechanism is proposed to explain carbon formation in the absence of hydrogen. The key to achieving carbon deposition without hydrogen is use of a suitable supported catalyst, where metal-support interactions in the catalyst play an important role. A Ni catalyst supported on SiO₂-Al₂O₃ was exposed to various CO/CO₂ ratios (set to prevent Ni carbide or oxide formation) and low concentrations of H₂ (0 to 3 %) in the temperature range of 745 K to 785 K. An important finding was that the carbon formations produced when H₂ was present in the reaction gas had open graphite edges (filaments), while the formations produced with no H₂ were closed nanotubes and encapsulating shells. Hydrogen atoms serve to satisfy valences {{at the edges of the}} graphite <b>basal</b> <b>planes</b> in filaments. A previously unidentified mode of carbon precipitation from the catalyst metal is used to explain the catalytic formation of carbon shells and nanotubes: instead of graphite <b>basal</b> <b>planes</b> precipitating generally parallel to the metal surface, the carbon atoms are added to the edge of <b>basal</b> <b>planes,</b> perpendicular to the metal...|$|R
