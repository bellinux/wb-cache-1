5000|$|Megadef was a {{comeback}} album for S.O.B., {{after five years}} after their debut album 2000 Fold. The album was mainly self managed, and included only three featuring artists.

Teju auditioned for the role and was selected and the movie was released to critical acclaim. Whilst he would enjoy a lot of recognition from movie goers across Nigeria, it did nothing to help his dreams of being an actor. ‘I kept waiting for something to happen’, he says, ‘and when it never did, I tried to make it happen by going to meet the established directors of that day but nothing I did seemed to work’. During these times, Teju soon realized that whilst acting was greatly dependent on being cast in any role by producers and directors, stand-up comedy was a field that offered perhaps equal fame and fortune with a freedom to perform that he would never find in acting and so he took a friend up on an offer to act as the Emcee for a departmental end of year whilst in the university. He enjoyed the experience so much that he spent less time trying to act and focused more on comedy and was soon rewarded with success and recognition. He went on to create The Teju Babyface Show in 2010.|$|E
50|$|A {{day before}} the trade deadline, the Mavericks instigated a <b>block-buster</b> deal. The trade sent Josh Howard, James Singleton, and Drew Gooden to the Washington Wizards in {{exchange}} for Caron Butler, Brendan Haywood, and Deshawn Stevenson. The Mavericks felt that this trade was necessary due to Howard's declining performance and apparent unhappiness with the Mavericks organization. Many NBA analysts {{felt that this was}} a good move, because not only did it remove a disgruntled Howard from the line-up, it simultaneously brought Dirk Nowitzki a quality supporting cast, with many believing that the Mavs could contend for a title after the trade went through. The trade clearly worked, because the new-look Mavericks came out of the all-star break with a vengeance. On January 24, 2010, the Dallas Mavericks routed The New York Knicks 128-78. This was the third largest margin of victory in NBA history. The previous largest margin of victory for the Mavericks was 45 points. After dropping the second-half opener to the Oklahoma City Thunder, the Mavericks went on to win 13-straight games before losing to the New York Knicks. On April 10, the Mavericks clinched the Southwest division after defeating the Portland Trail Blazers 83-77. The Mavericks finished the season with an impressive 55-27 record, good enough for the second seed in the Western Conference. The Mavericks then entered the post-season with quite a bit of optimism and an assurance that they could seriously contend for a title.|$|E

40|$|Crowd {{simulations}} {{have become}} increasingly popular in films over the last decade, appearing in large crowd shots of many big name <b>block-buster</b> films.

40|$|Publisher's description: ‘Leo-mania’ is a {{worldwide}} phenomenon. From great public institutions holding original masterpieces, like the Louvre in Paris, to <b>block-buster</b> exhibitions at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, Leonardo’s work is now widely dispersed {{and nearly all}} his surviving paintings are in public galleries, an institution that didn’t even exist when he was alive. So {{how did they get}} there? Where have they been? And who has owned them? Published to coincide with the biggest ever Leonardo exhibition at the National Gallery in London, this fascinating new book traces the extraordinary history of seven of the artist’s most influential works, from original commission to final resting place, and brings to life the wider context in which the paintings were created, bought and sold. It includes the story of how one painting became a national symbol of Poland after surviving years of war-torn history; and it describes how a bitter feud between two rival art dealers over another Leonardo painting, led to a sensational court case that shook the art world of the 1920 s. Drawing on original source material, including contracts, museum archives and personal letters, Professor Marina Wallace shines new light on the often complex histories of ownership and attribution and considers them alongside the evolution of the international art market. Entertaining and accessible, this unique study offers a fresh approach to art history that will appeal to Leonardo enthusiasts and the general reader alike...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Barry J Harnick RIGHT-SIZED RISK-BASED DEPLOYMENT OF A COTS CHROMATOGRAPHY DATA SYSTEM As {{technology}} advances, {{computer software}} {{has taken a}} large position in the modern laboratory. The exponential growth of data produced in biopharmaceutical laboratories today has forced the need for moving from capturing data on paper or storing it in spreadsheets and small, non-robust databases {{to the need for}} having an automated and secure data management platform. In the November edition of the 2003 Scientific Computing & Instrumentation LIMS Guide, M. Elliott (2003) pointed out that traditionally laboratories have looked to Laboratory Information Management Systems (LIMS) to assist in managing the ever increasing information workload. In the not so distant past, these LIMS and other systems were custom systems that largely delivered every user requirement, specific to each company’s internal processes. However, new regulations and reporting requirements have stretched this model and the reality of longterm maintenance costs have brought about the integration of systems within laboratories, not only to collect data but also manage these systems in a way that insures long-term preservation and knowledge retention. This integration is not without its challenges, especially when it occurs in a heavily regulated industry such as pharmaceuticals. While there are certainly technical challenges associated with this integration, this strict regulatory environment particularly requires expensive, tedious validation of most software. Into the software validation mine field has entered the risk-based verbiage recently espoused by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This verbiage might either be the bane or panacea for an industry that is trying hard to focus on making the next <b>block-buster</b> drug, not on developing internal software. So, how does a large pharmaceutical company meet tightening FDA guidelines and accomplish their true drug discovery goal? The solution might be in another type of integration- namely integrating laboratory processes, risk-based software validation, and a Commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) system. The resulting blend will nearly certainly hold more initial deployment pain for the laboratory, as the COTS system cannot be modified to completely fit the current laboratory processes. Often, however, the validation and compliance benefits might greatly outweigh the initial costs. The thesis project consisted of developing a right-sized, risk-based validation package for a COTS chromatography data system (CDS) and the subsequent deployment of the validated software. Validation included first developing a detailed risk assessment to guide right-sizing the validation effort, taking current regulatory guidance on riskbased software validation into account. This is the approach of a large pharmaceutical company that is seeking to minimize direct involvement in software development, while minimizing the significant risks that come from software, whether developed internally or by an outside vendor. This project explored the various ways risk-based validation and COTS software vendor management can reduce validation, deployment and maintenance costs, especially those associated with the testing and on-going maintenance of a COTS package...|$|E
40|$|The {{terrorist}} attacks in the United States of September 11, 2001, were unprecedented in the modern era, and they heralded {{a new era in}} politics as the Bush Administration pursued rigorous security policies at home and staged military operations in Afghanistan, and subsequently Iraq. Witness testimonies, and newspaper articles {{in the immediate aftermath of}} the attacks, revealed that many of those watching coverage of the attacks on television temporarily mistook the reporting for a Hollywood <b>block-buster,</b> an indication that there was some kind of relationship between 9 / 11 and Hollywood film-making. This thesis contends that films produced in 9 / 11 ’s wake were influenced by the attacks and the response that followed, particularly as they demonstrate either an endorsement or challenge to the Bush Administration, and thus can be interpreted politically. This thesis makes specific reference to a number of key issues that demonstrate how Hollywood dealt with 9 / 11. Firstly, the industry found itself unsure what films were suitable for release in the new context of victimhood; it co-operated with government officials to help in the post- 9 / 11 effort, while many individuals responded to the emergency with fund-raising and other activities. The issue of how Hollywood narrativised the emotional and psychological consequences of the attacks is also addressed with particular focus on how film can act as a memorial. A key feature of both post- 9 / 11 culture and cinema is a fresh apprehension of the real. In this thesis, the issue of ‘the real’ is studied in two distinct areas: realist aesthetics in fiction film, and how the choice of a particular realism has a particular ideological significance; and the growth of the documentary feature film. If Hollywood’s attention to realist aesthetics meets a certain need for facts and knowledge in a period of crisis, then the desire to ‘understand’ is also addressed by genre’s treatment of American myth. In the case of post- 9 / 11, focus on the Western demonstrates how the issues of ‘strong’ masculinity and ‘Otherness’ of race, are dealt with by Hollywood. One of the prevailing myths surrounding the official 9 / 11 story is that the latent heroism of the ordinary American citizen was revealed. Here, post- 9 / 11 heroism is analysed with reference to the numerous films based on comic-books, specifically those featuring superheroes that expose particular psychological phenomena peculiar to post- 9 / 11 America. Finally, the concept of the global nature of 9 / 11 with reference to how Hollywood deals with American catastrophe in a global context, how an American event is represented by non-American film-makers, and how global events are represented by non-American film-makers but viewed through the paradigm of 9 / 11 is discussed. This thesis, then, studies the political and ideological functions and implications of American film after 9 / 11 through discourses of ‘the real’ and key issues of self-censorship, co-operation, victimhood, masculinity, race, repression, trauma, and heroism...|$|E
40|$|The chapter {{looks into}} John Williams' {{contribution}} to the return of symphonic film scores in the Hollywood cinema of the late 1970 s. In the first part, it traces an outline of the context, i. e. the pop-music fad that characterised Hollywood during the 1960 s and early 1970 s. Due to many reasons, the symphonic film score entered a gradual demise {{at the end of}} the 1950 s. In particular, 1966 is a highly symbolic landmark, as in that year Hitchcock rejected Bernard Herrmann's symphonic score for Torn Curtain in favour of a more pop and market-oriented one: thus one of the most successful director/composer relationship ended abruptly. In those years, the symphonic score was replaced either by pop-music scores whose piece de resistance was a marketable song – as in Henry Mancini's film scores. Although the symphonic score did not disappear completely, it decidedly became a second option and an old-fashioned one. In the second part, the chapter shows how John Williams reverted the trend. The unanimously recognised landmark is the release of Star Wars in 1977 which launched the so-called “Film Music Renaissance. ” However, the chapter shows how Williams' penchant for the classical Hollywood music and for symphonic writing can be also spotted in his early 1960 s works – e. g. in the 1967 comedy Fitzwilly and in the picaresque 1969 film The Reivers. Also, before Star Wars it was Jaws that demonstrated that a symphonic score could still be a very powerful cinematic tool, more powerful than any pop score. After almost a decade, Jaws was the first major film set in the the present day, telling a contemporary story and designed to be a popular success that did not resort to pop music or marketable songs. Instead, Jaws employed a symphonic score reminiscent of Herrmann, on the one hand, and Korngold, on the other, which was awarded an Oscar. Williams' restoration was completed two years later with Star Wars, a film boasting a grand-orchestral almost continuous symphonic scoring sounding like the old Korngold scores for the Errol Flynn films, brilliantly performed by the London Symphony Orchestra. With the success confirmed by another Oscar and by unprecedented sales – in two months the symphonic album sold 650, 000 copies – Star Wars brought back symphonic scoring as a major option for <b>block-buster</b> films and confirmed that the symphonic score could not only be enormously effective to film narration but also successfully marketable. If it is historically imprecise to state that John Williams brought back symphonic music as the Hollywood music, as it used to be in the old days, it is safe to say that he launched a successful neoclassical trend within the eclectic style of contemporary Hollywood cinema, and he was responsible like no other for bringing the symphonic score back to the general attention and appreciation...|$|E
40|$|Introduction The {{worldwide}} use of PET {{has proven}} beyond dispute the importance for both routine diagnosis and physiological, oncological and pharmacological research. In {{many ways the}} present success of PET relies on the mature technology of PET compact medical cyclotrons. As long time developers of new targets, isotopes and com-pounds, we have been inclined to look for new <b>block-buster</b> applications, high power targets and sustainable ways of embracing the GMP and regional distribution, but recent pioneering development [1] around very small cyclotrons and “embedded synthesis and qc” has pointed out an old, but important nuclear physics lesson now halfway forgotten: that many PET isotopes {{can be made in}} high yields with proton energies far below 10 MeV [2]. This has opened a new interest in small cyclotrons and their targets. We have been testing the first GE Healthcare Prototype for a 7. 8 MeV negative ion, internal ion source cyclotron with 3 production targets mounted on a short beamline. Here we present the first experimental yields of some of the important PET radionuclides. Materials and methods The prototype cyclotron (FIG. 1) has been in-stalled and tested without self-shield in designated experimental area in order to establish the neutron field around accelerator and targets in order to qualify design calculations for a future integrated shield. The cyclotron energy is fixed by the radial position of the extraction foil, while the azimuth determines which of the 3 targets are being irradiated. The beam energy at front of target foil was determined on several occasions: 7. 8 ± 0. 1 MeV by a 2 copper-foil sandwich method (adopted from [3]). The available beam inside the cyclotron at extractor position is > 50 μA, and 35 μA are easily and long term reliably extracted (> 90 %) on to any of the 3 target positions. The prototype is capable of delivering more than 40 μA to target, but target current was limited to 35 μA under present unshielded conditions. Results 18 F We have tested the prototype gridded (> 80 % transmission) niobium body target with 10 μm Havar foil using 95 % 18 O water and 35 μA on target + grid with yields given in TABLE 1. The observed yields corrected for stopping in foil, grid loss and water enrichment are 75 % of theoretical. One Fastlab FDG run using 2 h irradiation yielded 16 GBq FDG EOS, confirming the “usual” 18 F activity. Results 11 C Using gridded target and a 10 μm foil with 99 % N 2 + 1 % O 2 at 10 bar followed by trapping into ascarite gave EOB activity as shown in TABLE 2. Results 13 N We know that the 16 O(p,alpha) 13 N cross section is a very steep function of energy around 7. 8 MeV. In the hope of using the simple water target route to 13 N NH 3 we have measured the 13 N yields (corrected for 18 F contribution). It is still unclear if these yields can be improved to make useful single doses of ammonia. Results for other isotopes We have used solid targets to make 45 Ti, 64 Cu, 68 Ga and 89 Zr. The development of these solid targets is still in progress, but especially the 68 Ga yield looks promising (3 GBq EOB after 1 h on natural Zn will give > 15 GBq on enriched 68 Zn) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{opportunities}} {{afforded by}} the Internet and online commerce are molding a traditional union catalog project into a publication that, before they became widely available, {{could not have been}} conceived. The project, the Image Directory, is creating new alliances between the editorial, production, and marketing departments of Academic Press. It is encouraging image owners, who are providing data for the catalog, to enter into the electronic publishing medium either for the first time or beyond theft own Web pages or CD-ROM productions. Finally, it is also holding out the potential for scholarly benefits, not only to the image owners, but also to students, researchers, and professionals interested in arts images. Whilst the concept of creating a union catalog of information about arts images is not new, without the capabilities offered by electronic publishing the project could not come into existence. Electronic publishing has introduced two significant ingredients to the art museum community that are making this project work. The first is the potential that it offers for the management of image collections. In the era when information about images and art objects was recorded on cards, museums created idiosyncratic vocabularies and formats that were incompatible with those of other museums. Because collections differ and because museums are by nature competitive, vying with each other for unique objects, there were few incentives to combine data. Collections management software and the introduction of standardized vocabularies and controls, such as the Getty 2 ̆ 7 s Art and Architecture Thesaurus, have provided the tools for significant inventory projects. The second is the fear of losing control of data that electronic publishing creates among curators and trustees. With the diminishment of grants and federal funding, museums are coming under increasing pressure to generate revenue. Looking for ways to generate revenue from their assets, they host <b>block-buster</b> exhibitions, sell coffee cups with paintings printed on them, and market themselves in ways that are succeeding in increasing attendance numbers. But electronic publishing and, in particular, the World Wide Web, offer pirates the opportunity to steal high resolution images, violating copyright rules and depriving museums of revenue that would naturally come through the sales of reproduction rights. Along with developments in image watermarking and the new envelope-locking technologies, museums need other ways to mark their assets as their own. The Image Directory directly addresses both of these aspects. The project is based on the information that image owners have already created for their collection management databases. Academic Press will add no new data to those records, but will standardize them so that idiosyncrasies among records are bridged but not erased. Scholars will be able to search the world for the location of and information about images and museums will have a central, definitive source in which to publicise their holdings and to list rights and reproductions information. The Image Directory will offer a leveling factor into the hierarchical world of museums, making records from the largest, best endowed museums equally accessible to those of small ones. And it will offer image owners the ability to sell images through the database architecture, potentially opening a new revenue stream for them. The Image Directory is an excellent example of an electronic publishing project crystallizing social and financial trends. There is every possibility that it will not only facilitate new scholarly discoveries, but it will increase the presence of different types of art in mainstream culture...|$|E
