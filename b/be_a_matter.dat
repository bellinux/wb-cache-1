5|$|Prior to the 19th century, {{there were}} very few schools. Most of those that existed were run by the church, for the church, {{stressing}} religious education. In {{the latter part of the}} 19th Century, compulsory attendance at school ceased to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> for local option, with the introduction of the Elementary Education Act 1870 a milestone in the British school education system. Children had to attend between the ages of 5 and 10 though with some local discretion such as early leaving in agricultural areas.|$|E
5|$|Prompted by the Russian invasion, Livonia first unsuccessfully {{sought help}} from Emperor Ferdinand I, {{then turned to}} Poland–Lithuania. Landmeister von Fürstenburg fled to Poland–Lithuania to be {{replaced}} by Gotthard Kettler. In June 1559, the estates of Livonia came under Polish–Lithuanian protection through the first Treaty of Vilnius (Vilna). The Polish sejm refused to agree to the treaty, believing it to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> affecting only the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. In January 1560, Sigismund sent ambassador Martin Volodkov to the court of Ivan in Moscow in an attempt to stop the Russian cavalry rampaging through rural Livonia.|$|E
5|$|The exact date of {{transition}} can <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of interpretation. Historians have variously proposed Julius Caesar's {{crossing of the}} Rubicon River in 49 BC, Caesar's appointment as dictator for life in 44 BC, and the defeat of Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC. However, most use the same date as did the ancient Romans themselves, the Roman Senate's grant of extraordinary powers to Octavian and his adopting the title Augustus in 27 BC, as the defining event ending the Republic.|$|E

5|$|The higher-level {{phylogeny}} of the arthropods {{continues to}} <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of debate and research. In 2008, researchers at Tufts University uncovered {{what they believe}} is the world's oldest known full-body impression of a primitive flying insect, a 300-million-year-old specimen from the Carboniferous period. The oldest definitive insect fossil is the Devonian Rhyniognatha hirsti, from the 396-million-year-old Rhynie chert. It may have superficially resembled a modern-day silverfish insect. This species already possessed dicondylic mandibles (two articulations in the mandible), a feature associated with winged insects, suggesting that wings may already have evolved at this time. Thus, the first insects probably appeared earlier, in the Silurian period.|$|E
5|$|Ward's {{thesis is}} {{based on the fact that}} the Thyssen panel, so named after its home at the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum, is {{overwhelmingly}} influenced by Campin, while the contemporaneous and more sophisticated Madonna Standing draws heavily from van Eyck. He finds such a sudden shift unlikely, while also pointing out that this work evidences some technical difficulties that Campin was never to resolve, especially in respect to foreshortening and the rendering of the body beneath the robes. He also points to the architectural similarities in Campin's Marriage of Mary, although this may <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of influence.|$|E
5|$|A list of {{necessary}} equipment was compiled by 1 August and included, among other things, massive cables, capstans, pulleys, and 40 pounds of tallow for lubrication. The proposed salvage team comprised 30 Venetian mariners and a Venetian carpenter with 60 English sailors to serve them. The two ships {{to be used}} as hulks were Jesus of Lübeck and Samson, each of 700tons burthen and similar in size to the Mary Rose. Brandon was so confident of success that he reassured the king that it would only <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of days before they could raise the Mary Rose. The optimism proved unfounded. Since the ship had settled at a 60-degree angle to starboard much of it was stuck deep into the clay of the seabed. This made it virtually impossible to pass cables under the hull and required far more lifting power than if the ship had settled on a hard seabed. An attempt to secure cables to the main mast appears only to have resulted in its being snapped off.|$|E

25|$|The {{differences}} between attested Proto-Norse and unattested Proto-Germanic are rather small. Separating Proto-Norse from Northwest Germanic {{can be said}} to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of convention, as sufficient evidence from the remaining parts of the Germanic-speaking area (Northern Germany and the Netherlands) is lacking in a degree to provide sufficient comparison. Inscriptions found in Scandinavia are considered to be in Proto-Norse. Several scholars argue about this subject matter. Wolfgang von Krause sees the language of the runic inscriptions of the Proto-Norse period as an immediate precursor to Old Norse, but Elmer Antonsen views them as Northwest Germanic, but his views on Runic Script and related subjects might be considered extreme.|$|E
25|$|When {{the first}} forests arose on Earth, new niches for {{terrestrial}} animals were created. Spore-feeders {{and others who}} depended on plants and/or the animals living around them would have to adapt too {{to make use of}} them. In a world with no flying animals, it would probably just <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of time before some arthropods who were living in the trees evolved paired structures with muscle attachments from their exoskeleton and used them for gliding, one pair on each segment. Further evolution in this direction would give bigger gliding structures on their thorax and gradually smaller ones on their abdomen. Their bodies would have become stiffer while thysanurans, which didn't evolve flight, kept their flexible abdomen.|$|E
25|$|Dius Fidius is {{considered}} a theonym for Jupiter, and sometimes a separate entity also known in Rome as Semo Sancus Dius Fidius. Wissowa argued that while Jupiter is {{the god of the}} Fides Publica Populi Romani as Iuppiter Lapis (by whom important oaths are sworn), Dius Fidius is a deity established for everyday use and was charged with the protection of good faith in private affairs. Dius Fidius would thus correspond to Zeus Pistios. The association with Jupiter may <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of divine relation; some scholars see him as a form of Hercules. Both Jupiter and Dius Fidius were wardens of oaths and wielders of lightning bolts; both required an opening in the roof of their temples.|$|E
