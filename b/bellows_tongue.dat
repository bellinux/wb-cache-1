50|$|After leaving Nordica, in {{the late}} '70s he {{modified}} a Nordica Meteor shell to use a springy nylon flex-controlling internal shell-tongue. He brought the design to Erik Giese in Aspen. Giese, an ex-ski racer and lawyer from Seattle, had founded a small research-and-design company in 1973, called Comfort Products. He employed two former NASA space-suit engineers: Al Gross, who was instrumental in developing the Flexon <b>bellows</b> <b>tongue</b> based on space suit components, and Dixie Rinehart, who designed articulated gloves later licensed to Swany.|$|E
40|$|Product {{diversification}} is a usual {{strategy of}} footwear producers. As a requirement related to competitiveness in this domain, diversification {{can be done}} by practical application of some criteria. Considering this aspect, the paper proposes a research on the diversification {{in the case of a}} safety footwear product by modifying its component patterns, while keeping the initial shape of the product. Thus, starting from a safety shoe model, diversification was performed by changing the configuration in the joining area of two patterns of the product. By joining the tongue with the <b>bellows</b> <b>tongue,</b> the upper with the quarter, the heel counter with the quarter and the collar and heel counter with quarter has resulted a family of models characterized by a reduction of the number of patterns in the product. The size of the set presents a significant influence on the theoretical nesting factor and implicitly on the size of the wastes. The analysis of the resulting new model types lead to highlighting the influence of the patterns number of the uppers and the area of the set on the usage index of the leather surface when cutting the parts and on the specific consumption. ...|$|E

60|$|Soon the {{stranger}} was seen dimly wallowing along astern, crowding all sail in chase, while {{now and then}} her bow-gun, showing its red <b>tongue,</b> <b>bellowed</b> after them like a mad bull. Two more shots struck the cutter, but without materially damaging her sails, or the ropes immediately upholding them. Several of her less important stays were sundered, however, whose loose tarry ends lashed the air like scorpions. It seemed not improbable that, owing to her superior sailing, the keen cutter would yet get clear.|$|R
