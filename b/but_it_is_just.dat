25|$|Acid jazz {{developed}} in the UK in the 1980s and 1990s, influenced by jazz-funk and electronic dance music. Acid jazz often contains various types of electronic composition (sometimes including Sampling (music) or a live DJ cutting and scratching), <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> {{as likely to be}} played live by musicians, who often showcase jazz interpretation as part of their performance. Jazz-funk musicians such as Roy Ayers and Donald Byrd are often credited as the forerunners of acid jazz.|$|E
25|$|Just as {{uncertain}} is {{the nature}} of the sacrifices made there. Judging from the remains of the actual, relatively small fire altar inside the huge altar edifice, it can at least be concluded that its shape resembled a horseshoe. It was apparently an altar with two projecting side wings and one or several steps in front. Possibly the thighs of sacrificial animals were burned here. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> as possible that the altar served only for libations— the offering of sacrifices in the form of incense, wine and fruits. It is likely that only priests, members of the royal household and illustrious foreign guests were allowed access to the fire altar.|$|E

500|$|Between two {{and three}} million years ago, during the Pliocene, the Sierra Nevada was uplifted and tilted westward. A series of {{volcanic}} mudflows (lahars) from three major source areas contributed debris that covered almost [...] to form the oldest distinctive geologic formation in the High Cascades. The resulting Tuscan Formation is not exposed anywhere in the national park <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> below the surface in many places within it. The oldest pyroclastic material in the formation is 3 or 4 million years old. The youngest part of the formation consists of interbedded conglomerates and volcanic breccias that are 2 million years old.|$|E
500|$|Sigtrygg {{may have}} succeeded his {{paternal}} half-brother Glúniairn as king of Dublin in 989, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> as likely his rival Ivar of Waterford {{came to power}} in the city then. The Irish annals record little information about Sigtrygg, his family or Dublin during these first five years of his reign. [...] Benjamin Hudson claims this was because of the arrival of the future King of Norway, Olaf Tryggvason, who took up residence in Dublin for a few years after marrying Sigtrygg's sister Gytha. [...] Tryggvason had met Gytha while raiding along the coasts of the Irish Sea. [...] The presence of a powerful Viking leader in Dublin was a deterrent to Irish raids, and Trygvason may have weakened Sigtrygg's foes by plundering them.|$|E

2500|$|According to Constantin Gutberlet {{writing in}} [...] Catholic Encyclopedia (1911), materialism, defined as [...] "a {{philosophical}} system which regards matter {{as the only}} reality in the world [...] denies the existence of God and the soul", Materialism, in this view, therefore becomes incompatible with most world religions, including Christianity, Judaism, and Islam. In such a context one can conflate materialism with atheism. However Friedrich Lange wrote in 1892 [...] "Diderot has not always in the Encyclopaedia expressed his own individual opinion, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> as true that at its commencement {{he had not yet}} got as far as Atheism and Materialism".|$|E

Other associated activities included a play, Remembered, at the Paul Robeson Theatre in Hounslow, West London, and the launch of a book entitled Remembered: In Memoriam, an anthology of essays, articles and narratives about African and Caribbean experiences during and {{in the aftermath of}} the world wars, compiled by Jak Beula and Nairobi Thompson. In a letter of support to the Nubian Jak Community Trust, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II said: [...] "It is now over 70 years since the end of that war, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> as important to remember the ultimate sacrifice made by those men and women who were prepared to lay down their live for our freedoms." ...|$|E
2500|$|Writing for Religion Dispatches, Austin Dacey {{compared}} the protest movement to Martin Luther, stating, [...] "Forget the South Park dust up; forget Everybody Draw Muhammad Day. If {{you want to}} see truly shocking anti-religious cartoons, {{you have to go back}} to the sixteenth century. Near the end of Luther’s life, his propaganda campaign against Rome grew increasingly vitriolic and his language grotesquely pungent." [...] Dacey argued, [...] "The debate over cartoon depictions of the Prophet Muhammad is often framed as a clash between free speech and religious attitudes. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> as much a clash between conflicting religious attitudes, and the freedom at stake is not only freedom of expression but freedom of religion. For while Luther was surely engaging in offensive speech, he was also exercising a right of freedom of conscience, which included the right to dissent from Catholic orthodoxy." ...|$|E

2500|$|Snook {{was lost}} while {{conducting}} her ninth war patrol, in the South China Sea and Luzon Strait. On 8 April, she reported her position to submarine [...] {{and when she}} did not acknowledge messages sent from Tigrone the next day, it was presumed that she had headed toward Luzon Strait. On 12 April, she was ordered to take lifeguard station in the vicinity of Sakishima Gunto in support of British carrier air strikes. On 20 April, the commander of the British carrier task force reported that he had a plane down in Snooks assigned area, and that he could not contact the submarine by radio. Snook was ordered to search the area and to acknowledge the order. When she failed to make a transmission, submarine [...] was sent to make the search and rendezvous with Snook. Although Bang arrived and rescued the downed aviators, she saw no sign of the missing submarine; on 16 May, Snook was presumed lost due to unknown causes. It is believed that she was sunk by kaibokans Okinawa, CD-8, CD-32 and CD-52. It has also been suggested that Snook may have been lost in combat with one of five Japanese submarines which were also lost in April–May 1945. One candidate is the Japanese submarine I-56 [...] (type B3) <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> a hypothesis because it is not confirmed by a single Japanese source.|$|E
