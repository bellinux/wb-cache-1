2500|$|In November 2016, President Duterte {{confirmed}} the Maute group's {{affiliation with the}} Islamic State. Amidst fierce fighting in Butig on November 30, 2016, Duterte, in a command briefing in Lanao del Sur, warned the Maute group: [...] "Ayaw ko makipag-away sa inyo. Ayaw ko makipag-patayan, (I {{do not want a}} fight with you. I don't want us killing each other) <b>but</b> <b>please,</b> <b>do</b> not force my hand. I cannot be forever traveling here every month para lang makipag-usap (just to talk), at pagtalikod ko patayan nanaman (and when I turn around, there's killing again). I do not want to mention anything, <b>but</b> <b>please</b> <b>do</b> not force my hand into it." [...] On December 2, 2016, as the military regained control of Butig, the retreating Maute fighters reportedly left a note threatening to behead Duterte.|$|E

60|$|Thanks {{for telling}} {{me all the}} news, <b>but</b> <b>please</b> don't <b>do</b> it again. It makes me remember, and I don't want to. It's this way, Ginger. Let me write to you, because it really does relieve me, but don't answer my letters. Do you mind? I'm sure you'll understand.|$|R
60|$|This {{the captain}} was not only willing <b>but</b> <b>pleased</b> to <b>do.</b> He {{even went so far}} as to draw on a piece of brown paper a rude chart of the North-east Providence Channel, and the self imposed task was hardly {{completed}} when Harry brought his written story to an end.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I thought so, <b>but</b> <b>please</b> don't talk. <b>Do</b> {{you want}} to tell us more? Is it that you can't hear me distinctly? He seems to want to tell us more, but {{something}} prevents him.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We are half-brothers," [...] said Adrian looking {{straight}} before him; [...] "we {{have the same}} mother only; <b>but</b> <b>please</b> <b>do</b> not call me 'sir,' call me 'cousin.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Rupert," [...] {{the girl}} said, [...] "it {{seems like a}} dream. <b>But</b> <b>please</b> <b>do</b> not let us talk yet about ourselves. Tell me about Papa. How is he?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes!" [...] {{she said}} hurriedly. [...] "He is often there, of course. <b>But</b> <b>please</b> <b>do</b> not forget,--to-night {{we do not}} talk about my uncle. We talk about ourselves. May I ask you something?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Mitchy, as he partook of refreshment, kept up his {{thoughtful}} gaze. [...] "I shall presently {{want some}} more, <b>please.</b> <b>But</b> <b>do</b> you mind my asking if Van knew--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] she humbly said. [...] "He {{would be}} wise about it! I don't want to be disagreeable and oppressive, Robert; I will never try to force things on you; <b>but</b> <b>please</b> let me <b>do</b> all that is {{possible}} to you to allow." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It <b>does</b> not <b>please</b> me to {{hear your}} voice, <b>but</b> it <b>does</b> <b>please</b> me to give you certain orders, which you will find it wise to obey." ...|$|R
60|$|SIR--I {{give you}} the dog {{because of what you}} got me out of. He is the best I know, for I made him myself, and he is as good as a man. Please do not give him too much to eat, and please do not give him back to me, for I'm not going to take him, if you will keep him. So please do not try to give him back any more. I have kept his name back, so you can call him {{anything}} and he will answer, <b>but</b> <b>please</b> <b>do</b> not give him back. He can kill a man as easy as anything, <b>but</b> <b>please</b> <b>do</b> not give him too much meat. He knows more than a man.|$|E
60|$|Come along, {{boys and}} girls! We are off on our rambles. <b>But</b> <b>please</b> <b>do</b> not ask me {{where we are}} going. It would delay us very much if I should {{postpone}} our start until I had drawn you {{a map of the}} route, with all the stopping-places set down.|$|E
60|$|TROTTER. [emphatically] I think I {{know the}} sort of {{entertainments}} you mean. <b>But</b> <b>please</b> <b>do</b> not beg a vital question by calling them plays. I dont pretend to be an authority; but I have at least established {{the fact that these}} productions, whatever else they may be, are certainly not plays.|$|E
6000|$|She did not flinch. [...] "Do we {{know the}} truth now?" [...] she asked, looking at him steadfastly. [...] "I don't want to hurt you--you know that; <b>but</b> <b>please</b> tell me, <b>did</b> you really do it? I mean, {{did you do it}} in the way we have been led to suppose?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Poor thing," [...] {{continued}} the servant, soothingly, [...] "I'm sorry for it, {{and for you}} too, Miss! <b>But,</b> oh! <b>do</b> <b>please</b> to remember it was you left the cage on the table, in the cat's reach--" ...|$|R
60|$|Dolores {{was not in}} a mood to be <b>pleased,</b> <b>but</b> she <b>did</b> {{not quite}} dare to say she did not choose to make herself ridiculous, and she knew there was {{authority}} in the tone, so she followed and endured.|$|R
60|$|Would be {{very glad}} of 25,000 infantry; no {{artillery}} or cavalry; <b>but</b> <b>please</b> <b>do</b> not send a man if it endangers any place you deem important to hold, {{or if it}} forces you to give up or weaken or delay the expedition against Chattanooga. To take and hold the railroad at or east of Cleveland, in East Tennessee, I think fully {{as important as the}} taking and holding of Richmond.|$|E
60|$|From the Marquesas I sailed with {{sufficient}} absinthe in ballast to last me to Tahiti, where I outfitted with Scotch and American whisky, and thereafter {{there were no}} dry stretches between ports. <b>But</b> <b>please</b> <b>do</b> not misunderstand. There was no drunkenness, as drunkenness is ordinarily understood--no staggering and rolling around, no befuddlement of the senses. The skilled and seasoned drinker, with a strong constitution, never descends to anything like that. He drinks to feel good, to get a pleasant jingle, {{and no more than}} that. The things he carefully avoids are the nausea of over-drinking, the after-effect of over-drinking, the helplessness and loss of pride of over-drinking.|$|E
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>please</b> <b>do</b> {{not imagine}} that the evils of indissoluble {{marriage}} can be cured by divorce laws administered on our present plan. The very cheapest undefended divorce, even when conducted by a solicitor {{for its own sake}} and that of humanity, costs at least 30 pounds out-of-pocket expenses. To a client on business terms it costs about three times as much. Until divorce is as cheap as marriage, marriage will remain indissoluble for all except the handful of people to whom 100 pounds is a procurable sum. For the enormous majority of us there is no difference in this respect between a hundred and a quadrillion. Divorce is the one thing you may not sue for in forma pauperis.|$|E
6000|$|... "I think {{little of}} marrying any one, dear father and dear uncle, and would rather {{talk about it}} less, if you <b>please.</b> <b>But,</b> <b>did</b> I think of marrying at all, I do believe a man whose {{affections}} have already been tried by three or four wives would scarcely be my choice." ...|$|R
5000|$|In March 2011, Pondexter drew {{controversy}} {{after posting}} comments on her Twitter account regarding the devastating 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami in Japan. [...] Pondexter tweeted: [...] "What if God {{was tired of}} the way they treated their own people in there [...] own country! Idk guys he makes no mistakes." [...] She later tweeted: [...] "u just never knw! They did pearl harbor so u can't expect anything less." [...] In response to the negative response to her comments, Pondexter replied: [...] "I wanna apologize to anyone I may hurt or offended during this tragic time. I didnt realize that my words could be interpreted in the manner which they were people that knw [...] me would tell u 1st hand im [...] a very spiritual person and believe that everything, even disasters happen 4 a reason and that god [...] will shouldnt be questioned. But this is a very sensistive [...] subject at a very tragic time and I shouldnt [...] even have given a reason for the choice of words I used. If youve lost respect for me thats totally fine <b>but</b> <b>please</b> <b>dont</b> let me or my words lose the respect of u the WNBA and what it stands for." ...|$|R
50|$|The phrase under {{responsibility}} to the courts provides the main concept of the freedom: the constitution grants one the freedom to say whatever they <b>please,</b> <b>but</b> <b>does</b> not protect them from being punished for doing so. The courts generally set wider boundaries for what is deemed inappropriate for the press or in a political debate than for civil citizens.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{very much}} obliged {{to you for}} those lovely flowers, and I carried the bouquet last night, <b>but</b> <b>please</b> <b>do</b> not send any more. I don't {{think that it is}} quite nice to accept {{presents}} from anyone except very near relations. It was very kind of you to think of it, but I would really rather that you did not do it again. Uncle gives me carte blanche in the way of flowers, but I do not avail myself of it very largely, for the scent is apt to make me feel faint, and beyond the smallest spray I seldom carry any. I made an exception last night, for those you sent me were most lovely. You don't mind my saying that, do you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'That is {{the best}} thing you can do, sir. Now I will say good-night. You know where I am to be found, and I must ask you to write to me there and make an {{appointment}} for me to meet you if you want to see me. I shall still do what I can in the matter, and shall spare no efforts to endeavour to trace this man Truscott, and if I can find him it is probable that I shall be able to find the woman; <b>but</b> <b>please</b> <b>do</b> not let Miss Hawtrey know that I am taking any further part in the matter. She is deeply offended with me, and from her point of view this is perfectly natural. She thinks I ought to have trusted her and believed in her in spite of any evidence whatever, even that of my own eyes, and she is naturally extremely sore that one whom she regarded as a close friend should not have done so. I regret it deeply myself, but seeing what I saw----' ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‚ÄúSo I did, Porter. I {{will tell}} you boys something, <b>but</b> <b>please</b> <b>do</b> not let it go any further. Since Jasniff and Merwell became pupils at Rockville Military Academy and since they ran away from that {{institution}} {{they have been doing}} everything they could think of to annoy me. They have sent farmers here with produce that I never ordered, and have had publishers send me schoolbooks that I did not want. Worse than that, they have circulated reports to my scholars‚Äô parents that this school was running down, that it was in debt, and that some pupils were getting sick because the sewerage system was out of order. Some of the parents have written to me, and two were on the point of taking their boys away, thinking the reports were true. Fortunately I was able to prove the reports false, and the boys remained here. But I do not know how far these slanders are being circulated and what the effect will be in the future.‚Äù ...|$|E
60|$|In {{a minute}} or two, the lamb began to run towards her out of a little thicket of bushes; and it drank the milk out of the pan. James and Rollo were very much <b>pleased,</b> <b>but</b> they <b>did</b> not go towards the lamb. Ann let it drink all it wanted, and then it walked away.|$|R
60|$|Merritt's {{compliment}} was <b>pleasing,</b> <b>but</b> it <b>did</b> not augment my purpose, {{for that}} already {{had reached the}} highest mark. Love of hitting, if no other thing, gave me the thrilling fire to arise to the opportunity. Selecting my light bat, I went up and faced the rustic twirler and softly said things to him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Frog," [...] said Peterkin, in a low, earnest voice, at {{the same}} time shaking his finger slowly and fixing his eyes on the plethoric {{creature}} before him--"frog, you may believe it or not as you <b>please,</b> <b>but</b> I <b>do</b> solemnly assure you that I never did behold such a great, big, fat monster as you are in all--my--life! What do you mean by it?" ...|$|R
60|$|Fanny's First Play, being but a potboiler, {{needs no}} preface. But its lesson is not, I {{am sorry to}} say, unneeded. Mere morality, or the {{substitution}} of custom for conscience was once accounted a shameful and cynical thing: people talked of right and wrong, of honor and dishonor, of sin and grace, of salvation and damnation, not of morality and immorality. The word morality, if we met it in the Bible, would surprise us {{as much as the}} word telephone or motor car. Nowadays we do not seem to know that there is any other test of conduct except morality; and {{the result is that the}} young had better have their souls awakened by disgrace, capture by the police, and a month's hard labor, than drift along from their cradles to their graves doing what other people do for no other reason than that other people do it, and knowing nothing of good and evil, of courage and cowardice, or indeed anything but how to keep hunger and concupiscence and fashionable dressing within the bounds of good taste except when their excesses can be concealed. Is it any wonder that I am driven to offer to young people in our suburbs the desperate advice: Do something that will get you into trouble? <b>But</b> <b>please</b> <b>do</b> not suppose that I defend a state of things which makes such advice the best that can be given under the circumstances, or that I do not know how difficult it is to find out a way of getting into trouble that will combine loss of respectability with integrity of self-respect and reasonable consideration for other peoples' feelings and interests on every point except their dread of losing their own respectability. But when there's a will there's a way. I hate to see dead people walking about: it is unnatural. And our respectable middle class people are all as dead as mutton. Out of the mouth of Mrs Knox I have delivered on them the judgment of her God.|$|E

5000|$|The Crown Prince is kind but weak. I did {{not dare}} to disobey your petition, and {{therefore}} I created him crown prince.

60|$|DEAR SIR:--Your letter {{enclosing}} {{the attack}} of the Times upon me was received this morning. Give yourself no concern about my voting against the supplies.
