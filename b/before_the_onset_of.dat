5|$|Negative {{symptoms}} are deficits of normal emotional responses or of other thought processes, {{and are less}} responsive to medication. They commonly include flat expressions or little emotion, poverty of speech, inability to experience pleasure, lack of desire to form relationships, and lack of motivation. Negative symptoms appear to contribute more to poor quality of life, functional ability, and the burden on others than positive symptoms do. People with greater negative symptoms often {{have a history of}} poor adjustment <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> illness, and response to medication is often limited.|$|E

5|$|The rapid {{intensification}} of Patricia was well-anticipated but poorly forecast. Meteorologists at the NHC indicated {{the possibility of}} such in the system's first advisory as a tropical depression. They noted the only inhibiting factor would be how quickly the storm could organize an inner core. Just <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> rapid intensification, the agency was unable to utilize the Statistical Hurricane Intensity Prediction Scheme rapid intensification guidance due to technical errors. This likely contributed to even greater errors in the agency's forecast. Initial forecasts were consistently conservative with intensity and dramatic strengthening was not explicitly shown until rapid intensification was already underway.|$|E
5|$|The {{refusal of}} the United States {{government}} to take promised military action {{in the face of}} North Vietnamese violations of the cease-fire is also examined as a key to the defeat. Adherents to this claim believed that South Vietnam could have been saved by another U.S. bombing campaign. The conflict between the executive and legislative branches of the American government, already severe <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> the Operation Linebacker II in 1972, was only more exasperating during 1975, when a new campaign would probably only have provoked even more Congressional outrage.|$|E

5|$|Medical {{diagnosis}} of the onset of HD can be made following the appearance of physical symptoms specific to the disease.

These implications include the impact on an individual's psychology, career, family planning decisions, relatives and relationships. Despite the availability of pre-symptomatic testing, only 5% of those at risk of inheriting HD choose to do so.|$|E
5|$|On June16, the Central Weather Bureau issued sea {{and land}} {{warnings}} in Taiwan as Soudelor was anticipated to produce torrential rains, gale-force winds, and rough seas.

As the typhoon tracked near Taiwan, the Japan Meteorological Agency began advising residents in Okinawa to closely monitor the storm. One of the major airlines in Japan, All Nippon Airways, cancelled 66 domestic flights the same day, stranding an estimated 6,000 people. During the storm, 257domestic flights were canceled, and train and ferry service was canceled. In Nagasaki Prefecture, 732schools were closed during the storm.

5|$|Russula virescens can {{be found}} fruiting on soil in both {{deciduous}} forests and mixed forests, forming ectomycorrhizal symbiotic relationships {{with a variety of}} trees, including oaks (Quercus), European beech (Fagus sylvatica), and aspen (Populus tremula). Preliminary investigations suggest that the fungus also associates with at least ten species of Dipterocarpaceae, an important tree family prevalent in the tropical lowland forests of Southeast Asia. Fruit bodies may appear singly or in groups, reappear in the same spots year after year, and are not common. In Europe, fruiting occurs mainly during the months of summer to early autumn. A Mexican study of the seasonal occurrence of several common mushroom species in subtropical forests in Xalapa showed that the fruiting period of R.virescens occurred in April, <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> the rainy season.|$|E

30|$|The {{signals of}} most events {{detected}} in the previous sections were recognized only at Togi station. The relative hypocenter locations within each cluster to the reference events were estimated from S-P time differences. A correlation method using overlapping time windows was separately applied to P- and S-phases in the interpolated seismograms for each cluster. We used interpolated seismograms for reference events (E 2, E 4, and E 8) {{with a duration of}} 0.6 s, starting 0.05 s <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>onsets</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> respective P- and S-phases. The S-P times of each event in a given cluster differed by only 0.003 s indicating that the hypocenters of the events in each cluster were located within a 20 -m radius of each other. This analysis also showed that the hypocenters of E 7, E 8, and E 9 as well as the E 1 and E 2 hypocenters were all located at similarly proximal distances.|$|R
5|$|The French won {{a further}} five {{successive}} tournaments {{before they were}} beaten 3–2 by Great Britain in 1933.

Upon resumption of the tournament in 1946, it was renamed the Davis Cup {{after the death of}} Dwight D. Davis in 1945. The United States regained the title after they beat Australia 5–0. They retained the title until 1950 when Australia won 4–1. This marked the start of Australian dominance of the Davis Cup, as they only lost three times from 1950 to 1967. Prior to 1972, the champion received a bye directly to the final. This was changed so that the champion had to play in every round.|$|E
5|$|There is a {{variation}} in the rate and extent of recovery. The prognosis of Guillain–Barré syndrome is determined mainly by age (those over 40 may have a poorer outcome), and by the severity of symptoms after two weeks. Furthermore, those who experienced diarrhea <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> disease have a worse prognosis. On the nerve conduction study, the presence of conduction block predicts poorer outcome at 6 months. In those who have received intravenous immunoglobulins, a smaller increase in IgG in the blood two weeks after administration is associated with poorer mobility outcomes at six months than those whose IgG level increased substantially. If the disease continues to progress beyond four weeks, or there are multiple fluctuations in the severity (more than two in eight weeks), the diagnosis may be chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, which is treated differently.|$|E
5|$|This basin’s {{season has}} a double peak: one in April and May, <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> the monsoon, {{and another in}} October and November, just after. This double peak occurs because {{powerful}} vertical wind shear in between the surface monsoonal low and upper tropospheric high during the monsoon season tears apart incipient cyclones. High shear explains why no cyclones can form in the Red Sea, which possesses the necessary depth, vorticity and surface temperatures year-round. Rarely do tropical cyclones that form elsewhere in this basin affect the Arabian Peninsula or Somalia; however, Cyclone Gonu caused heavy damage in Oman on the peninsula in 2007.|$|E

50|$|Several {{studies have}} {{investigated}} the influence of valid and invalid cues.

Posner and Cohen (1984) noted a reversal of this benefit takes place when the interval between <b>the</b> <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cue and <b>the</b> <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> target is longer than about 300 ms. The phenomenon of valid cues producing longer reaction times than invalid cues is called inhibition of return.|$|R
5|$|Two {{thirds of}} people with Guillain–Barré {{syndrome}} have experienced an infection <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> the condition. Most commonly these are episodes of gastroenteritis or a respiratory tract infection. In many cases, {{the exact nature of}} the infection can be confirmed. Approximately 30% of cases are provoked by Campylobacter jejuni bacteria, which cause diarrhea. A further 10% are attributable to cytomegalovirus (CMV, HHV-5). Despite this, only very few people with Campylobacter or CMV infections develop Guillain–Barré syndrome (0.25–0.65 per 1000 and 0.6–2.2 per 1000 episodes, respectively). The strain of Campylobacter involved may determine the risk of GBS; different forms of the bacteria have different lipopolysaccharides on their surface, and some may induce illness (see below) while others will not.|$|E
5|$|About {{nine hours}} after the system {{developed}} on August24, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) issued a tropical storm watch from the Seven Mile Bridge to Vero Beach. Later that day, the watch was upgraded to a tropical storm warning and hurricane watch from Florida City to Vero Beach after the storm's intensification became apparent. About 25hours before Katrina made landfall, the tropical storm watch was extended northward to Titusville, and a tropical storm warning and a hurricane watch was issued for Lake Okeechobee. Early on August25, a hurricane warning was issued from Florida City to Vero Beach and for Lake Okeechobee. In southeastern Florida, the lead time for the hurricane watch and warning occurred 31.5 and 19.5hours before landfall, respectively; both were 16.5hours less than the desired lead time. A tropical storm warning was also issued from Florida Key, southward through the Florida Keys to the Dry Tortugas, and northward along the western coast to Longboat Key.

5|$|Batory {{accelerated}} {{the formation of}} the hussars, a new well-organised cavalry troop that replaced the feudal levy. Similarly, he improved an already effective artillery system and recruited cossacks. Batory gathered 56,000 troops, 30,000 of them from Lithuania, for his first assault on Russia at Polotsk, as part of a wider campaign. With Ivan's reserves in Pskov and Novgorod to guard against a possible Swedish invasion, the city fell on 30 August 1579. Batory then appointed a close ally and powerful member of his court, Jan Zamoyski, to lead a force of 48,000 including 25,000 men from Lithuania, against the fortress of Velikie Luki which he went on to capture on 5September 1580. Without further significant resistance, garrisons such as Sokol, Velizh and Usvzat fell quickly. In 1581, the force besieged Pskov, a well-fortified and heavily defended fortress. However, financial support from the Polish parliament was dropping, and Batory failed to lure Russian forces in Livonia out into open field <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> winter. Not realising that the Polish–Lithuanian advance was on the wane, Ivan signed the Truce of Jam Zapolski.|$|E
40|$|Advances in volcano {{monitoring}} and forecasting need a multidisciplinary collaborative framework. In light of this, a Bayesian Event Tree (BET) approach {{was performed by}} {{the application of the}} BET for Eruption Forecasting (BET_EF) code to analyze the space-time distribution of the volcanic activity of Mount Etna from 2001 - 2005. First, a reliable monitoring dataset was set up after some sessions to elicit geophysical, volcanological and geochemical ‘precursor’ parameters. A constant unrest probability of 100 %, with a magma involvement usually greater than 95 %, was computed throughout the time period analyzed. Eruption probabilities higher than 90 % were estimated a few days <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>onsets</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 2001 and 2002 - 2003 flank eruptions. Values slightly higher than 75 % were observed during the lava fountaining period in June-July 2001. However, the probabilities flattened to around 30 % for the 2004 - 2005 flank eruption. With suitable data, a good depiction of the actual location of the eruptive scenario for the 2001 and 2002 - 2003 events was provided. Conversely, the size of the eruptions was not indicated. 1...|$|R
40|$|Rebstock and Boersma (2011) {{recently}} explored {{variation in}} the temperature and incubation period of eggs within clutches of the Magellanic Penguin (Spheniscus magellanicus). They defined incubation period as “the time from the laying of an egg to its hatching” and concluded that parental behavior explained why the incubation period of second eggs was shorter than that of first eggs and controlled asynchronous hatching. While we agree that parents influenced asynchronous hatching by delaying <b>the</b> <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> incubation, we argue that their conclusions are based on an unconventional definition of incubation period. They included <b>the</b> period <b>before</b> <b>the</b> delayed <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> incubation in <b>the</b> incubation period, which leads to confusion.

5|$|In 1897, <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> {{fighting}} in Puerto Rico, Juan Alonso Zayas, born in San Juan, {{was a second}} lieutenant in the Spanish Army when he received orders {{to head for the}} Philippines to take command of the 2nd Expeditionary Battalion stationed in Baler. He arrived in Manila, the capital, in May 1897. There he took a vessel and headed for Baler, on the island of Luzon. The distance between Manila and Baler is 62 miles (100km); if traveled through the jungles and badly built roads, the actual distance was 144 miles (230km). At that time a system of communication between Manila and Baler was almost non-existent. The only way Baler received news from Manila was by way of vessels. The Spanish colonial government was under constant attack from local Filipino groups who wanted independence. Zayas's mission was to fortify Baler against any possible attack. Among his plans for the defense of Baler was to convert the local church of San Luis de Tolosa into a fort.|$|E
5|$|On 22 March, as {{the joint}} battles of Meiktila and Mandalay were {{drawing to a}} close, a conference was held at Monywa in Burma, {{attended}} by senior Allied military figures including Admiral Lord Mountbatten, {{the commander in chief}} of the Allied South East Asia Command, and General William Slim, commander of Fourteenth Army. The object of the conference was to discuss future Allied strategy in South East Asia in the aftermath of Meiktila and Mandalay, including the reconquest of Burma and the retaking of Malaya and then Singapore. In order to secure these objectives however, Rangoon, the capital of Burma, would have to be captured <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> the monsoon rains, which would impede any Allied advance over land; the Allied Chiefs of Staff worked on the assumption that this would occur before June.

5|$|Solomon was born, {{probably}} circa 480/490, in {{the fortress}} of Idriphthon {{in the district}} of Solachon, near Dara in the province of Mesopotamia. He was a eunuch {{as a result of an}} accident during his infancy, not from deliberate castration. Solomon had a brother, Bacchus, who became a priest. Bacchus fathered three sons, Cyrus, Sergius and Solomon, who later became military officers in Africa under their uncle; Sergius also succeeded Solomon as governor of Africa after the latter's death. Little is known of Solomon's early career, except that he served under the dux Mesopotamiae Felicissimus, perhaps as early as the latter's installment to the post in 505/506. Certainly by 527, when he came to the service of General Belisarius, Solomon was considered an experienced officer.
