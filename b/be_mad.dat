5|$|Strozzi was a Venetian, born in 1583, whose {{literary}} works included plays and poetry {{as well as}} opera libretti; Monteverdi had first met him in 1621. Strozzi knew Monteverdi's music, and had developed a strong appreciation of the composer's innovative style. On 20 June 1627, Monteverdi informed Striggio that Strozzi had expanded and arranged the text into five acts, under the new title La finta pazza Licori. Feigned madness was a standard theme in the commedia dell'arte tradition that had established itself in Italian theatre in the 16th century. In Strozzi's plot, the first known attempt at comic opera, the woman Licori disguises herself initially as a man, then as a woman, and then pretends to <b>be</b> <b>mad,</b> all {{as part of a}} strategy to win the heart of her lover, Aminta.|$|E

25|$|We {{should note}} that Descartes' doubt is a methodological and {{rational}} doubt. That is, the Meditator is not just doubting everything at random, but is providing solid reasons for his doubt at each stage. For instance, he rejects {{the possibility that he}} might <b>be</b> <b>mad,</b> since that would undercut the rationality that motivates his doubt. Descartes is trying to set up this doubt within a rational framework, and needs to maintain a claim to rationality for his arguments to proceed.|$|E

A person had {{to avoid having}} intercourse on quarter or full moons and on days when there were great winds, rain, fog, cold or heat, thunder, lightning, darkness over heaven and earth, solar and lunar eclipses, rainbows and earthquakes.

In the same interview, speaking of his father, Jackson said, [...] "There were times when he'd come to see me, I'd get sick... I'd start to regurgitate. I'm sorry...

500|$|Wong was {{disappointed}} with director Harry Longstreet, claiming {{he did not}} have respect for the script. Longstreet had failed to film one of the script's scenes, and had not obtained additional camera coverage for the scenes which had been filmed. As a result, Wong and another director, Michael Katleman, re-shot several scenes for additional coverage to complete the episode, and filmed the omitted scene and some inserts. Hutchison also had difficulty with Longstreet's directing; he found the acting instructions he was given [...] "ridiculous". Morgan said that the episode's production was problematic, feeling that [...] "Squeeze" [...] "was truly saved in postproduction". Duchovny also found issue with Longstreet's direction, and disagreed with the director's take on how Fox Mulder should be portrayed. Describing their different opinions, Duchovny noted [...] "the director wanted me to <b>be</b> <b>mad</b> about this horrible serial killer. I was like, 'No, this is an amazing discovery! He's not morally culpable, because he's genetically driven.' I judge no one".|$|E

Furthermore, she said [...] "Picture to Burn" [...] became the only song driven by anger on Taylor Swift, a topic she felt most teenage females could {{identify}} to. [...] "It's OK to <b>be</b> <b>mad</b> after a breakup or after something goes wrong with a relationship", Swift said. The subject of [...] "Picture to Burn" [...] remains unaware that he is the inspiration behind the song. The song was chosen as a single based on the reactions it garnered at concerts. Swift recalled that, although [...] "Tim McGraw" [...] (2006) was her only single at the time she began opening for Rascal Flatts' Me and My Gang Tour (2006–07), [...] "Picture to Burn" [...] was the performance in which the crowd seemed to be the most enthusiastic with most screaming it [...] "at the top of their lungs".|$|E
500|$|... "Wake Up Dead" [...] {{features}} lyrics which {{describe a}} man who has been cheating on his wife or girlfriend and is sneaking into his house, knowing that if his wife finds out about his other lover, she will kill him. Mustaine said that [...] "Wake up Dead" [...] was written about him cheating on a girl with whom he was living. He stayed with her because he was homeless at the time and needed a place to stay. Unfortunately, {{he was in love with}} another girl and thought the one he lived with would <b>be</b> <b>mad</b> because he was cheating on her. He had to leave her because he thought she had intentions to kill him. [...] "The Conjuring", according to author Bob Larson, simulates a Satanic ceremony, and makes references about being the devil's advocate and his salesman. Mustaine explained the song is about black magic and contains instructions for hexes. However, because the subject matter appears incompatible to his conversion to Christianity, the song has not been played live since 2001.|$|E

[...] According to Sara D. Anderson of AOL Radio, Hilson vocally incorporates an [...] "improvisational gospel style. MTV Buzzworthy writer Chris Ryan compared Hilson's vocals with Mary J.
