5|$|<b>Back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>car,</b> Jack {{begins to}} lose {{confidence}} in his problem-solving abilities because Liz still wants to break up with Carol. As they talk through Liz's past problems with sex, they {{realize that they are}} all connected to the incident with the Tom Jones poster and that each time she has had a problem, it is because she has been reminded of the singer. Liz is relieved that she has found the root of her problem and Jack convinces her to stay with Carol. When they finally reach Newark Airport, Liz realizes that she is supposed to meet him at John F. Kennedy International Airport instead.|$|E
5|$|The bear follows {{and climbs}} {{on top of}} the Jeep, smashing up the car and {{eventually}} overturning it before leaving as the sun sets. Sean wakes up and tells them about the hunting paraphernalia, crying about wanting to go home before he dies. Wes and Lauren turn the Jeep right side up, load him <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>car,</b> then push the Jeep down the hilly road as a thunderstorm hits. Using the downward momentum and occasionally pushing, they arrive near the buildings. While Lauren is exploring the building with the trap, the bear swings at her through a window sending her back against the trap, which impales her back. She returns to the vehicle where the bear rips off the tailgate and drags away Sean's body.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins as}} the protagonist parks {{her car and}} cries {{following}} an argument she has had with her lover. She then leaves the car, walks towards the sea, and lets down her hair. Flashbacks of {{the woman and her}} lover on the beach are shown. With teary eyes, she heads into the sea as waves break the shore. <b>Back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>car,</b> she imagines her lover holding her hands. The video transitions into color, as Beyonc√©'s character appears on the beach in a green dress and holds a rose without its petals, which she later restores. The video then flashes back to black-and-white memories of the woman resting her head on her lover's shoulder. She eventually realizes that she must set her relationship back on the right track. In the end, she drives off with a smile.|$|E

Ryan threatened the driver and his passenger wife {{to get out of the}}ir car. The driver, Frank Jeziorski, turned his car off, put it in neutral then got out of his vehicle. Ryan got in via the driver's door. Surpisingly, Pauline Jeziorski refused to get out of the car. She was persuaded by Ryan to get out, only to go <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> to get her handbag. Paterson, realising Ryan was armed, returned inside the prison to get a rifle.|$|E

2500|$|I was at {{the post}} office with my Mum and Auntie [...] They put us in the police ute and said they were taking us to Broome. They put the mums in there as well. But when we'd gone [...] they stopped, and threw the mothers out of the car. We jumped on our mothers' backs, crying, trying not to be left behind. But the policemen pulled us off and threw us <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>car.</b> They pushed the mothers away and drove off, while our mothers were chasing the car, running and crying after us. We were {{screaming}} in the back of that car. When we got to Broome they put me and my cousin in the Broome lock-up. We were only ten years old. We were in the lock-up for two days waiting for the boat to Perth.|$|E

NASCAR executive vice-president Steve O'Donnell speaking on Sirius XM NASCAR Radio.

2500|$|In {{just his}} third Winston Cup start, Harvick beat Jeff Gordon by mere inches (.006 seconds) {{to win the}} Cracker Barrel 500 at Atlanta Motor Speedway, {{dedicating}} the win to Earnhardt. After posting another win at Chicagoland Speedway, Harvick won NASCAR Winston Cup Rookie of the Year honors. In 2002, his infamous temper escalated after announcing on his radio he would intentionally wreck another driver during a Craftsman Truck Series race. In response, NASCAR benched Harvick for the next race, and was replaced during that time by Kenny Wallace. Since then, Harvick has won eight races, including the prestigious Brickyard 400 and Daytona 500 while scoring a (at the time) career-best points effort of 4th in both 2006 and 2008. Despite a win early in the season, back-to-back seasons of missing [...] "The Chase for the Nextel Cup" [...] with 14th-place efforts proved to be frustrating, as Harvick threatened to leave the team if performance did not improve. A series of strong runs {{near the end of}} 2005 seemed to satisfy him, however, and he was <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> in 2006 with Reese's as a new co-primary sponsor. After a somewhat slow start, Harvick hit his stride in April, with a string of Top 10 finishes, including a win at Phoenix. He eventually made the chase and led the standings {{for the first time in}} the first week of the chase. This helped RCR to be a dominant force in NASCAR again. After weeks of speculation as to where Kevin would drive starting in 2007, he and RCR announced a new three-year deal that he would drive for him until 2009.|$|E

60|$|She leaned <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>car.</b> They {{had turned}} round now and {{were on the}} way back to Monte Carlo by the higher road. She sat with her eyes fixed upon the mountains. Her heart, in a way, had been touched, her {{imagination}} stirred by her husband's words. She felt a return of that glow of admiration which had thrilled her on the previous night, when he and Richard Lane alone amongst that motley company had played the part of men. A curious, almost pathetic wistfulness crept into her heart. If only he would lean towards her at that moment, if she could see once more the light in his eyes that had shone there during the days of their courtship! If only he could remember that it was still his part to play the lover! If he could be a little less grave, a little less hopelessly correct and fair! Despite her efforts to disbelieve, there was something convincing about his words. At any moment during that brief space of time, a single tremulous word, even a warm clasp of the hand, would have brought her into his arms. But so much of inspiration was denied him. He sat waiting for her decision with an eagerness of which he gave no sign. Nevertheless, the fates were fighting for him. She thought gratefully, even at that moment, yet with less enthusiasm than ever before, of the devout homage, the delightful care for her happiness and comfort, the atmosphere of security with which Draconmeyer seemed always to surround her. Yet all this was cold and unsatisfying, a poor substitute for the other things. Henry had been different once. Perhaps it was jealousy which had altered him. Perhaps his misconception of Draconmeyer's character had affected his whole outlook. She turned towards him, and her voice, when she spoke, was no longer querulous.|$|E

Andy Taylor worked out a Marc Bolan-ish guitar part, a very Marshall-sounding Les Paul guitar lick that was added to the track. Then the bass and drums were added, and the whole track was finished that day, including Le Bon's vocal melody and lyrics.
