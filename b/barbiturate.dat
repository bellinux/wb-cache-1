This has kept them a {{structurally}} sound breed which is predominantly free from the physical exaggerations {{that can lead to}} certain health problems. Whippets are, like other sighthounds, intolerant of <b>barbiturate</b> anaesthetics. This is in part due to their low concentration of body fat and their liver's inability to metabolise the anaesthetics.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} muscle relaxant action, benzodiazepines may cause {{respiratory}} depression in susceptible individuals. For that reason, they are contraindicated {{in people with}} myasthenia gravis, sleep apnea, bronchitis, and COPD. Caution is required when benzodiazepines are used in people with personality disorders or intellectual disability because of frequent paradoxical reactions. In major depression, they may precipitate suicidal tendencies and are sometimes used for suicidal overdoses. Individuals {{with a history of}} alcohol, opioid and <b>barbiturate</b> abuse should avoid benzodiazepines, as there is a risk of life-threatening interactions with these drugs.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to the United States, Monroe took an 18-month hiatus from work to concentrate on married life on the East Coast. She and Miller split their time between their Manhattan apartment and an eighteenth-century farmhouse that they purchased in Roxbury, Connecticut; they spent the summer in Amagansett, Long Island. She became pregnant in mid-1957, but it was ectopic {{and had to be}} terminated. She suffered a miscarriage a year later. Her gynecological problems were largely caused by endometriosis, a disease from which she suffered throughout her adult life. Monroe was also briefly hospitalized during this time due to a <b>barbiturate</b> overdose. During the hiatus, she dismissed Greene from MMP and bought his share of the company as they could not settle their disagreements and she had begun to suspect that he was embezzling money from the company.|$|E
40|$|<b>Barbiturates</b> inhibit binding of radioligands to A 1 (Ri) {{adenosine}} receptors of rat brain membranes. This inhibition is dose-dependent and stereospecific and {{occurs in}} the range of pharmacologically active concentrations. The displacement of radiolabelled A 1 antagonists by <b>barbiturates</b> is not modified by GTP, indicating that <b>barbiturates</b> might act as antagonists at this receptor. This action of <b>barbiturates</b> {{does not seem to be}} related to the binding of <b>barbiturates</b> to plasma membranes, as the latter process has different characteristics. <b>Barbiturates</b> also inhibit the binding of radioligands to solubilized A 1 receptors, and saturation and kinetic experiments suggest that this is due to a competitive antagonism.

40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>barbiturates</b> on the GABA·receptor complex and the A_ 1 {{adenosine}} receptor were studied. At the GABA-receptor complex the <b>barbiturates</b> inhibited the binding of [^ 35 S]t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate [^ 35 S]TBPT) and enhanced the binding of [^ 3 H]diazepam. Kinetic and saturation experiments showed that both effects were allosteric. Whereas all <b>barbiturates</b> caused complete inhibition of [^ 35 S]TBPT binding, they showed {{varying degrees of}} maximal enhancement of [^ 3 H]diazepam binding; (±) methohexital was idenafied as the most efficacious compound for this enhancement. At the A_ 1 adenosine receptor all <b>barbiturates</b> inhibited the binding of [^ 3 H]N^ 6 -phenylisopropyladenosine (^ 3 H]PIA) in a competitive manner. The comparison of the effects on [^ 3 H]diazepam and [^ 3 H]PIA binding showed that excitatory <b>barbiturates</b> interact preferentially with the A_ 1 adenosine receptor, and sedative/anaesthetic <b>barbiturates</b> with the GABA-receptor complex.

5|$|Epstein {{died of an}} {{overdose}} of Carbitral, a form of <b>barbiturate</b> or sleeping pill, in his locked bedroom, on 27 August 1967. He was discovered after his butler had knocked on the door, and then hearing no response, asked the housekeeper to call the police. Epstein was found on a single bed, dressed in pyjamas, with various correspondence spread over a second single bed. At the statutory inquest his death was officially ruled an accident; caused by a gradual buildup of Carbitral in his system, combined with alcohol. It was revealed {{that he had taken}} six Carbitral pills in order to sleep, which was probably normal for him, but in combination with alcohol they reduced his tolerance to lethal levels.|$|E
5|$|Named for British anesthetist Brian Arthur Sellick (1918–1996) {{who first}} {{described}} the procedure in 1961, {{the goal of}} cricoid pressure is to minimize the possibility of regurgitation and pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents. Cricoid pressure has been widely used during RSI for nearly fifty years, {{despite a lack of}} compelling evidence to support this practice. The initial article by Sellick was based on a small sample size at a time when high tidal volumes, head-down positioning and <b>barbiturate</b> anesthesia were the rule. Beginning around 2000, a significant body of evidence has accumulated which questions the effectiveness of cricoid pressure. The application of cricoid pressure may in fact displace the esophagus laterally instead of compressing it as described by Sellick. Cricoid pressure may also compress the glottis, which can obstruct the view of the laryngoscopist and actually cause a delay in securing the airway.|$|E

25|$|There {{are special}} risks to {{consider}} for older adults, {{women who are}} pregnant, and babies.

50|$|<b>Barbiturates</b> are {{drugs that}} act as central nervous system depressants, and can {{therefore}} produce {{a wide spectrum of}} effects, from mild sedation to total anesthesia. They are also effective as anxiolytics, hypnotics, and anticonvulsalgesic effects; however, these effects are somewhat weak, preventing <b>barbiturates</b> from being used in surgery in the absence of other analgesics. They have dependence liability, both physical and psychological. <b>Barbiturates</b> have now largely been replaced by benzodiazepines in routine medical practice - for example, in the treatment of anxiety and insomnia - mainly because benzodiazepines are significantly less dangerous in overdose. However, <b>barbiturates</b> are still used in general anesthesia, for epilepsy, and assisted suicide. <b>Barbiturates</b> are derivatives of barbituric acid.|$|R

25|$|<b>Barbiturates</b> act as {{positive}} allosteric modulators, and at higher doses, as agonists of GABAA receptors. GABA {{is the principal}} inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS). <b>Barbiturates</b> bind to the GABAA receptor at multiple homologous transmembrane pockets located at subunit interfaces, which are binding sites distinct from GABA itself and also distinct from the benzodiazepine binding site. Like benzodiazepines, <b>barbiturates</b> potentiate the effect of GABA at this receptor. In addition to this GABAergic effect, <b>barbiturates</b> also block AMPA and kainate receptors, subtypes of ionotropic glutamate receptor. Glutamate is the principal excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian CNS. Taken together, the findings that <b>barbiturates</b> potentiate inhibitory GABAA receptors and inhibit excitatory AMPA receptors can explain the superior CNS-depressant effects of these agents to alternative GABA potentiating agents such as benzodiazepines and quinazolinones. At higher concentration, they inhibit the Ca2+-dependent release of neurotransmitters such as glutamate via an effect on P/Q-type voltage-dependent calcium channels.|$|R
