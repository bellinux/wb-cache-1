This work first proposes a compact on-chip sensor design that tracks both NBTI and PBTI for both logic and SRAM circuits. Embedded in an SRAM array the sensor {{takes the form of a}} 6 T SRAM cell and is at least 30 × smaller than previous designs. Extensively reusing the SRAM peripheral circuitry minimizes control logic overhead. Sensing overhead is further amortized as the sensors can be both reconfigured and recycled as functional SRAM cells, potentially increasing SRAM yield when other <b>bit</b> <b>cells</b> fail due to initial pro-cess variation or long time aging effects. The paper also proposes a variation-aware sensor system design methodology by quantifying and leveraging the tradeoff between the size and number of sen-sors and the system sensing precision. Design examples show that a system of 500 sensors can achieve 4 mV precision with 98. 8 % confidence, and a system of 1 K sensors designed for 1 M SRAM <b>bit</b> <b>cells</b> achieves 2000 × area overhead reduction compared to a worst-case based approach...|$|R

The Supply voltage scaling is an effective way of reducing dynamic as well as leakage power consumption.

SRAM bit- cells utilizing minimum sized transistors are susceptible to various random process variations. The Schmitt Trigger based operation gives better readconstancy as well as superior write-ability compared to the standard bitcell configurations.

50|$|Being able to {{position}} a data signal {{relative to a}} clock signal with very high resolution and accuracy is an important capability in a BERT. This feature is used on the output of a data generator to ensure the clock signal rising edge corresponds {{to the middle of}} the data signal's bit window, since both signals will use different cabling and routing and can be mis-matched. The capability is also used on the receiver side of a BERT where a separate delay device is used to evaluate BER when the clock signal is not perfectly aligned in the middle of the data signal's <b>bit</b> <b>cell.</b> As the clock signal approaches either side of the data <b>bit</b> <b>cell</b> window, the quantity of errors will rise and the steepness of the rise is based on the amount of jitter between the clock and data signals.

40|$|Abstract—Voltage scaling is {{desirable}} in static RAM (SRAM) to reduce energy consumption. However, commercial SRAM is sus-ceptible to functional failures when is scaled down. Although several published SRAM designs scale to 200 – 300 mV, these designs do not sufficiently consider SRAM robustness, limiting them to small arrays because of yield constraints, {{and may not}} correctly target the minimum energy operation point. We examine the effects on area and energy for the differential 6 T and 8 T <b>bit</b> <b>cells</b> as is scaled down, and the <b>bit</b> <b>cells</b> are either sized and doped, or assisted appropriately to maintain the same yield as with full. SRAM robustness is calculated using importance sampling, resulting in a seven-order run-time improvement over Monte Carlo sampling. Scaling 6 T and 8 T SRAM down to 500 mV and scaling 8 T SRAM to 300 mV results in a 50 % and 83 % dynamic energy reduction, respectively, with no reduction in robustness and low area overhead, but increased leakage per bit. Using this information, we calculate the supply voltage for a minimum total energy operation based on activity factor and find that it is significantly higher for SRAM than for logic.

But since every unit must have the same bit pitch, every unit in the datapath ends up with the bit pitch forced by the widest unit, which can waste area in the other units. Register files, because they have two wires per bit per write port, and because all the bit lines must contact the silicon at every <b>bit</b> <b>cell,</b> can often set the pitch of a datapath.|$|E
50|$|There {{was some}} concern that as DRAM density {{increases}} further, {{and thus the}} components on chips get smaller, {{while at the same}} time operating voltages continue to fall, DRAM chips will be affected by such radiation more frequently—since lower-energy particles will be able to change a memory cell's state. On the other hand, smaller cells make smaller targets, and moves to technologies such as SOI may make individual cells less susceptible and so counteract, or even reverse, this trend.

The positive voltage on the transistor's gate forms an inversion channel in the substrate below the gate, causing a tunneling current to flow through the oxide. The current produces additional traps in the oxide, increasing the current through the oxide and ultimately melting the oxide and forming a conductive channel from gate to substrate. The current required to form the conductive channel is around 100µA/100nm and the breakdown occurs in approximately 100µs or less.|$|E
50|$|Processors that perform {{register}} renaming {{can arrange}} for each functional unit {{to write to}} {{a subset of the}} physical register file.

The resulting register file, effectively a stack of register files with single write ports, then benefits from replication and subsetting the read ports. At the limit, this technique would place a stack of 1-write, 2-read regfiles at the inputs to each functional unit. Since regfiles with a small number of ports are often dominated by transistor area, it is best not to push this technique to this limit, but it is useful all the same.|$|E
