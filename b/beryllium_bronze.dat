40|$|Purpose - This paper aims {{to carry}} out {{tribological}} experiments to explore the applications of femtosecond laser surface texturing technology on rock bit sliding bearing to enhance the lifetime and working performance of rock bit sliding bearing under high temperature and heavy load conditions. Design/methodology/approach - Surface textures on <b>beryllium</b> <b>bronze</b> specimen were fabricated by femtosecond laser ablation (800 nm wavelength, 40 fs pulse duration, 1 kHz pulse repetition frequency), and then the tribological behaviors of pin-on-disc configuration of rock bit bearing were performed with 20 CrNiMo/beryllium bronze tribo-pairs under non-Newtonian lubrication of rock bit grease. Findings - The {{results showed that the}} surface texture on <b>beryllium</b> <b>bronze</b> specimens with specific geometrical features can be achieved by optimizing femtosecond laser processing via adjusting laser peak power and exposure time; more than 52 per cent of friction reduction was obtained from surface texture with a depth-to-diameter ratio of 0. 165 and area ratio of 5 per cent at a shear rate of 1301 s(- 1) under the heavy load of 20 MPa and high temperature of 120 degrees C, and the lubrication regime of rock bit bearing unit tribo-pairs was improved from boundary to mixed lubrication, which indicated that femtosecond laser ablation technique showed great potential in promoting service life and working performance of rock bit bearing. Originality/value - Femtosecond laser-irradiated surface texture has the potential possibility for application in rock bit sliding bearing to improve the lubrication performance. Because proper micro dimples showed good lubrication and wear resistance performance for unit tribo-pairs of rock bit sliding bearing under high temperature, heavy load and non-Newtonian lubrication conditions, which is very important to improve the efficiency of breaking rock and accelerate the development of deep-water oil and gas resources...|$|E

Cu- 12 wt. %Al(Cu- 12 Al) alloy {{fabricated}} by continuous unidirectional solidification(CUS) {{process has}} high elasticity, high strength, high conductivity, high plasticity and other good comprehensive properties, {{which has a}} potential to develop into a high-performance elastic material as the alternative to <b>beryllium</b> <b>bronze.</b> Especially, the room temperature tensile elongation of the columnar-grained structure(CGS) Cu- 12 Al alloy with high β orientation along the axial direction exceeded 20 %, which is six times more {{than that of the}} ordinary polycrystalline structure (OPS) Cu- 12 Al alloy(ε= 2 - 4 %) fabricated by traditional casting. The CGS Cu- 12 Al alloy shows lower flow stress and work-hardening rate during plastic deformation, which determines a dramatic improvement of workability comparing with the OPS alloy. In the present paper, both the effects of the rolling process and its parameters on the microstructure and properties of the CGS Cu- 12 Al alloy sheets were investigated. The results showed that the CGS sheets (σb= 310 MPa, ε= 19 %) have the maximum reduction of 80 % and remain columnar-grained structure after the first rolling pass at 700 ℃. After deformation the tensile strength was 401 MPa and the tensile elongation approached to 14 %. Then, the hot rolled sheets were rolled again through the second pass at 325 ℃ and 700 ℃, respectively. The maximum reduction of CGS sheets at 325 ℃ warm rolling was 20 %, the sheet...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} improve {{the work of the}} Laboratory for Electromagnetic Compatibility Testing in the Technical Test Center (TTC), we {{investigated}} the influence of the Faraday cage on measurement results. The primary goal of this study is the simulation of the fields in the cage, especially around resonant frequencies, {{in order to be able}} to predict results of measurements of devices under test in the anechoic chamber or in any other environment. We developed simulation (computer) models of the cage step by step, by using the Wipl-D program and by comparing the numerical results with measurements as well as by resolving difficulties due to the complex structure and imperfections of the cage. The subject of this paper is to present these simulation models and the corresponding results of the computations and measurements. Construction of the cage The cage is made of steel plates with the dimensions 1. 25 m x 2. 5 m. The base of the cage is a square; the footprint interior dimensions are 3. 76 m x 3. 76 m, and the height is 2. 5 m. The cage ceiling is lowered by plasticized aluminum strips. The strips are loosely attached to the carriers which are screwed to the ceiling. The cage has four ventilation openings (two on the ceiling and two on one wall), made of honeycomb waveguide holes. In one corner of the cage, there is a single door with springs made of <b>beryllium</b> <b>bronze.</b> For frequencies of a few tens of MHz, the skin effect is fully developed in the cage walls. By measuring the input impedance of the wire line parallel to a wall of the cage, we calculated the surface losses of the cage plates. In addition, we used a magnetic probe to detect shield discontinuities. We generated a strong current at a frequency of 106  kHz outside the cage and measured the magnetic field inside the cage at the places of cage shield discontinuities. In this paper, we showed the influence of these places on the measurement results, especially on the qualitative and quantitative changes of the cage resonant frequencies. Model of the cage On the basis of the testing, the initial simulation model of the cage in the Wipl-D program consists of plates with losses, including losses at plate junctions, wall ventilation openings, aluminum profiles, profile carriers, and screws. The analysis showed that this model is not satisfactory. To obtain a more accurate model of the cage, we need the additional and more precise model of the lowered ceiling. That would complicate the model and require a lot of additional testing. For obtaining a simpler, but more reliable simulation model, we dismounted the aluminum profiles from the carriers. Thereafter, the agreement between the simulation and the experimental results was better than for the initial model, but still is not good enough, due to the uncertainties caused by the strips carriers and the screws. Final model of the cage To avoid the uncertainty due to the strips carriers, we removed the carriers and the screws from the cage. A very good matching of the simulation and the experimental results was achieved. We showed that the relative difference of the resonant frequencies between simulation and measurement is less than 1  %. However, the relative difference of resonant frequency between simulation or measurement and theoretical results is also less than 1  %, except for TE 101 and TE 011 modes, for which the relative difference is under 5  %. We explained the exception by the influence of the places of the cage shield discontinuities on the measurement results. Conclusion The results of the simulations and the measurements for the final model show good agreement, both qualitatively and quantitatively. We showed that the resonant frequencies in the simulations and the measurement results have same positions and depths. Also, the relative differences of the resonant frequencies are less than 1  %. As future work, we will provide a technique for the identification of equivalent sources that represent the device under test. This would enable a characterization of the tested device in an arbitrary electromagnetic environment and allow a comparison of results obtained in different laboratories.  </p...|$|E

40|$|An {{investigation}} of wear and friction properties {{of a number}} of materials sliding against SAE 52100 steel was conducted. These materials included brass, <b>bronze,</b> <b>beryllium</b> copper, monel, nichrome v, 24 s-t aluminum, nodular iron, and gray cast iron. The metals investigated may be useful as possible cage (separator or retainer) materials for rolling-contact bearings of high-speed turbine engines. The ability of materials to form surface films that prevent welding is a most important factor in both dry friction and boundary lubrication. On the basis of wear and resistance to welding only, the cast irons were the most promising materials investigated; they showed the least wear and the least tendency to surface failure when run dry, and when boundary lubricated they showed the highest load capacity. On the basis of mechanical properties, nodular iron is superior to gray cast iron. Bronze had the lowest friction coefficient under dry sliding conditions.
