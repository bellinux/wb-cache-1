50|$|The {{muscle synergy}} {{hypothesis}} {{is based on}} the assumption that the central nervous system controls muscle groups independently rather than individual muscles. The muscle synergy hypothesis presents motor control as a three-tiered hierarchy. <b>In</b> <b>tier</b> one, a motor task vector is created by the central nervous system. The central nervous system then transforms the muscle vector to act upon a group of muscle synergies <b>in</b> <b>tier</b> two. Then <b>in</b> <b>tier</b> three, muscle synergies define a specific ratio of the motor task for each muscle and assign it to its respective muscle to act upon the joint to perform the motor task.|$|R

30|$|Over {{the last}} 10  years, EDA studies guided by {{zebrafish}} bioassays have successfully identified bioactive or toxic compounds present in diverse biological matrices or environmental samples. Embryos and early larvae were the prevalent zebrafish life stages in these studies, with exposure {{being done in}} multiwell-plates, often with several individuals in the same well. In consequence, the sample volume for biotesting was minimized and the workload was reduced, which are important aspects in EDA. Zebrafish bioassays showed also versatility in terms of biotesting strategy, being applied alone or {{as a part of}} biotest <b>batteries</b> and <b>in</b> both screening phase as well as for further investigation of active fractions <b>in</b> <b>tiered</b> biotesting.|$|R

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of StatisticsJohn E. Boyer JrThe {{purpose of}} this study is to {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of the methods used for allocating disaster funds to assist commercial fishery participants as a result of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita of 2005 and to examine alternative methods to aid in determining an efficient criterion for allocating public funds for fisheries assistance. The trip ticket data managed by the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries were used and analyzed using a cluster analysis. Results from the clustering procedures show that commercial fishermen consist of seven clusters, while wholesale/retail seafood dealers consist of six clusters. The three tiers into which commercial fishermen were originally classified can be extended to at least eleven (11) clusters, made up of three (3) clusters <b>in</b> <b>tier</b> 1 and an equal number of clusters (4) clusters <b>in</b> <b>tier</b> 2 and tier 3. Similarly, the original three tiers of wholesale/retail seafood dealers can be reclassified into at least nine (9) clusters with two clusters <b>in</b> <b>tier</b> 1, four (4) clusters <b>in</b> <b>tier</b> 2 and three (3) clusters <b>in</b> <b>tier</b> 3. As a result of the clustering reclassifications, alternative compensation plans were developed for the commercial fishermen and wholesale/retail seafood dealers. These alternative compensation plans suggest a reallocation of disaster assistance funds among individual groups of fishermen and among individual groups of dealers. We finally recommend that alternative classification methods should always be considered in order to select the most efficient criterion for allocating public funds in the future...|$|R
