50|$|In December 1909, Harding {{started a}} weekly {{publication}} called Camp and Trail, which {{was incorporated into}} the Hunter-Trader-Trapper by August 1913. <b>The</b> addition <b>broadened</b> <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> of <b>the</b> magazine to include these recreational activities.|$|R
50|$|He <b>broadened</b> <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> of <b>the</b> Morning Post {{from being}} a mostly {{political}} journal by including more general topics. He ended his connection with the paper prior to his death to follow literary pursuits, contributing to leading journals.|$|R

Melnichuk tried to expand to three regions, issuing three regional newspapers: Business-Donbass, Business-Kharkov and Business-Crimea. All publications were issued in Russian.|$|R
50|$|Since the 1980s it {{has become}} common for social and {{cultural}} anthropologists to set ethnographic research in the North Atlantic region, frequently examining the connections between locations rather than limiting research to a single locale. There {{has also been a}} related shift toward <b>broadening</b> <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> beyond the daily life of ordinary people; increasingly, research is set in settings such as scientific laboratories, social movements, governmental and nongovernmental organizations and businesses.|$|E
50|$|Porter envisioned <b>broadening</b> <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> of {{the theater}} to {{performing}} classics of all eras year-round indoors as well as outdoors. The new artistic director, Jack Hickey, who had been appointed by the previous board president, worked with Porter to effect this expansion in phases. They attracted new board members and began financial reforms that led to solvency within a few years. Additional innovations under Porter’s leadership included educational programs, including a college intern program, {{the creation of a}} touring show, later revised and directed by Kevin Theis, and a summer workshop for teens. The theater, in a very real sense, owes its continued existence to the dedication of Porter and Hickey.|$|E
50|$|Reasons {{for missing}} or poorly {{maintained}} {{water and sanitation}} facilities at schools in developing countries include lacking inter-sectoral collaboration; lacking cooperation between schools, communities and different levels of government; {{as well as a}} lack in leadership and accountability. Methods to overcome these problems can include on a policy level: <b>broadening</b> <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> of the education sector, establishing a systematic quality assurance system, distributing and using funds wisely. And on a practical level it is recommended to: Have a clear and systematic mobilization strategy, support the education sector to strengthen intersectoral partnerships, establish a constant monitoring system which is located within the education sector, educate the educators and partner with the school management.|$|E

5|$|As {{in other}} disciplines, the initial {{emphasis}} of feminist economists was to critique the established theory, methodology, and policy approaches. The critique began in microeconomics {{of the household}} and labor markets and spread to macroeconomics and international trade, ultimately extending to all areas of traditional economic analysis. Feminist economists pushed for and produced gender aware theory and analysis, <b>broadened</b> <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> on economics and sought pluralism of methodology and research methods.|$|R
50|$|In 1985, {{after the}} first {{national}} Kallah (conference) gathering in Radnor, Pennsylvania, the name was changed from B'nai Or to P'nai Or ("Faces of Light") to reflect the more egalitarian perspective of the rising feminist movement. Together with such colleagues as Arthur Waskow, Schachter-Shalomi <b>broadened</b> <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> of his organization. In 1993 it merged with The Shalom Center, founded by Waskow, to become ALEPH: Alliance for Jewish Renewal.|$|R
5000|$|Reddy {{authored}} a {{book titled}} [...] "India And The Global Financial Crisis : Managing Money and Finance" [...] published by Orient Blackswan in 2009. This book which provided insights into the making of public policies across a spectrum of areas between the years 2003 and 2008, a period of rapid growth of the Indian Economy as well as extraordinary challenges {{for the conduct of}} monetary policy was among the best sellers in India. His book titled [...] "Global Crisis, Recession and Uneven Recovery" [...] (Orient Blackswan, 2011) was a sequel to 2009 bestselling work. It provided a thinker and experienced policymaker's understanding of the genesis, anatomy and impact of the financial crisis, and of the lessons it offered. The book highlighted that one of the consequences of the crisis is the shift in the balance of economic power in favour of Asia. Also, it highlighted the role of central banks {{in the evolution of the}} global financial crisis, in particular the role played by central banks in developing countries. Erudite discussions on India’s experience in regulating the financial sector and the need for reform in India’s financial sector in the light of global debates are some of the key features of this book. His most recent book was on [...] "Economic Policies and India's Reform Agenda: New Thinking" [...] (Orient Blackswan, 2013). Navigating through the debates between 2010 and 2012 on the continuing global financial crisis, this book reflected the confidence of Reddy who steered the nation’s banks to safer waters. In this book, Reddy seeks a change in economic thought and policy-making. Arguing for a three-fold shift in the discipline, he calls for <b>broadening</b> <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> of policy-makers, improvisation in the tools employed by economists and an emphasis on empirical evidence. This ‘new thinking’, he says, will contribute to India’s accelerated development.|$|E
30|$|<b>Broadening</b> <b>the</b> <b>focus,</b> it is {{also true}} that a solid general {{education}} helps widen the range of occupational choices open to students who have not settled on a career even if some of the skills and knowledge is never used in their work lives and atrophies across the life course.|$|E
40|$|This book is {{for social}} work and {{criminal}} justice practitioners who wish to develop culturally appropriate and effective programs for reducing anger-related violence perpetrated by Indigenous men.

50|$|To Whiting’s dismay, the CMA Board of Trustees {{chose to}} <b>broaden</b> <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> of <b>the</b> museum {{in order to}} include the {{accession}} of master artworks to become competitive with {{institutions such as the}} Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. When offered the position as president of the American Federation of Arts in 1930, he decided to pursue his commitment to education there.|$|R
30|$|In this stage, {{the concern}} is the set of {{problems}} presented, and the debate seeks to point out how decisions are connected. This {{part of the process}} consists of identifying decision areas. The decision areas were defined by the workshop participants, as mentioned in paragraph  4.1. The debates sought to define how choices are made, what decisions will be made, how to link decisions, and, if necessary, <b>broaden</b> <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> on divisions to improve management.|$|R
30|$|Here {{we seek to}} <b>broaden</b> <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> of {{engagement}} further from literacy to language and digital literacies {{through the creation of}} digital stories. This broader stance recognises there is now sufficient evidence to support the inclusion of oral language as a genuine contributor to reading comprehension, the ultimate goal of reading (Konza, 2014), and further, that much of the text that twenty-first century students communicate in and through involves digital modes of reading and writing (or literacies).|$|R
40|$|Results of {{an inquiry}} of University of Minho {{graduates}} converge {{in the sense}} of the inexistence of significant relation between parents educational level and a range of variables related to professional integration, such as access to a position, professional status or income. If empirical evidence suggests the inoperativeness of inherited education capital, as well as the levelling capacity of university experience, sociological prudence advises us, however, to consider alternative analysis which require <b>broadening</b> <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> of analysis to the whole school career of the inquired population...|$|E
40|$|Negative {{mentoring}} experiences {{encountered by}} 242 protégés across their career histories were examined. Negative mentoring experiences clustered into two factors: Distancing/Manipulative Behavior and Poor Dyadic Fit. Protégés’ {{reports of the}} impact that these experiences had on them further suggested that several types of negative mentoring experiences were related to job satisfaction, turnover intentions, and stress. Finally, protégés in formally initiated mentoring relationships reported the most negative experience as having more of an effect on turnover intentions and stress than protégés in informal relationships. The results {{are discussed in the}} context of <b>broadening</b> <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> of mentoring research and implications for applied practice...|$|E
40|$|This paper reviews whether {{geographic}} information systems (GIS) {{students from the}} United Arab Emirates University (UAEU) are well-prepared for the job market. A questionnaire was prepared and circulated by the author to alumni of the GIS program, {{as well as to}} ten organizations in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) who use GIS applications. Many of the alumni responded that they were dissatisfied with their undergraduate experience. These results indicate that <b>broadening</b> <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> of the coursework and emphasizing internships and real-world interaction would make the students ’ experience more satisfying and prepare them better for the job market they will face when they graduate...|$|E
30|$|Engagement {{not only}} {{improves}} students’ perceptions of schooling and {{themselves as a}} learner, but also there is persuasive international evidence that literacy attainment is enhanced when students engage actively in literacy activities, both in school and in out-of-school contexts. Although much of this {{research has focused on}} reading, Cummins (2015) <b>broadens</b> <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> from reading engagement to literacy engagement, which seems appropriate given the considerable research documenting how developing writing expertise plays in improving reading comprehension (Graham & Herbert, 2010).|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} further develop the framework, the {{findings}} from these empirical studies (Alänge and Steiber 2009, 2011) were then contrasted to and discussed {{in relation to other}} more recent research on the creation, diffusion, and sustaining of organizational innovation from a system perspective (e.g., Frambach and Schillewaert 2002; Buchanan et al. 2005; Birkinshaw et al. 2008; Ganter and Hecker 2013). This second literature review <b>broadened</b> <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> on both <b>the</b> creation and on the sustaining of organizational innovations and confirmed the view that the three concepts creation, diffusion, and sustaining are intertwined (Steiber 2012).|$|R

40|$|By <b>broadening</b> <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> beyond classic English detective fiction, the American ‘hard-boiled’ crime {{novel and}} the gangster movie, Crime Cultures {{breathes}} {{new life into}} staple themes of crime fiction and cinema. Leading international scholars from the fields of literary and cultural studies analyze a range of literature and film, from neglected examples of film noir and ‘true crime’, crime fiction by female African American writers, to reality TV, recent films such as Elephant, Collateral and The Departed, and contemporary fiction by J. G. Ballard, Kazuo Ishiguro, and Margaret Atwood. They offer groundbreaking interpretations of new elements such as the mythology of the hitman, technology and the image, and the cultural impact of ‘senseless’ murders and reveal why crime is a powerful way of {{making sense of the}} broader concerns shaping modern culture and society...|$|E
40|$|Understanding the {{contribution}} of marketing to economic and social outcomes is fundamental to <b>broadening</b> <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> of marketing. The authors develop a comprehensive model that integrates the impact of service quality and service satisfaction on both economic and societal outcomes. The model is validated using two random samples involving intensive health services. The results indicate that service quality and service satisfaction significantly enhance {{quality of life and}} behavioral intentions, highlighting that customer service has social as well as economic outcomes. This is an important finding given the movement toward recognizing social and environmental outcomes, such as emphasized through triple bottom-line reporting. The findings have important implications for managing service processes, for improving {{the quality of life of}} customers, and for enhancing customers 2 ̆ 7 behavioral intentions toward the organization...|$|E
40|$|This book aims to both {{reflect and}} take forward current {{thinking}} on comparative and cross-national and cross-cultural {{aspects of the}} history of crime.

Overall the book aims to <b>broaden</b> <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> of <b>the</b> historical context of crime and policing to take fuller account of cross-national and cross-cultural factors...|$|R
50|$|The {{ecological}} {{stability of}} human settlements {{is part of}} the relationship between humans and their natural, social and built environments. Also termed human ecology, this <b>broadens</b> <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> of sustainable development to include the domain of human health. Fundamental human needs such as the availability and quality of air, water, food and shelter are also the ecological foundations for sustainable development; addressing public health risk through investments in ecosystem services can be a powerful and transformative force for sustainable development which, in this sense, extends to all species.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a model which explains how mortgage-rate movements, transactions costs, changes in borrower income and house value, personal financial opportunities and the prepayment option embedded in fixed-rate mortgages affect a financially flexible borrower's decision to refinance an existing loan while retaining the underlying home. <b>Broadening</b> <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> of previous analytical work, the model explains why households with similar mortgage loans may react differently as financial market conditions change. It contains definitive empirical predictions that {{are supported by}} an analysis of a choice-based sample of individual loan transactions. Results suggest that refinancings are motivated both by movements {{in the level of}} interest rates and by borrowers' desires to alter their capital structures in the face of changing income and housing wealth.

40|$|Career {{clusters}} {{are part}} of a response to changing work and a changing workplace, a way of <b>broadening</b> <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> of secondary career and technical education (CTE). The following are some of the changes in work and the workplace: the nature and structure of work; leadership styles and organizational structures; the knowledge and skills needed; values and commitment; and the importance of lifelong learning. Changes in CTE include a longer, broader-term conception of work, strengthened academics, strong secondary-postsecondary articulation, and entrance to long-term careers beyond entry-level jobs. Career clusters can help students build career pathways by providing a broader focus on preparation for the workplace. Teachers, instructional designers, career counselors, and administrators need to learn about career clusters and adapt and enlarge their roles to support the use of clusters with students. A working knowledge of career clusters includes their nomenclature, complexity, and ways they are organized...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{was designed to}} examine how factors within young children's environment (e. g., school factors, neighborhood) contribute to explaining peer victimization. The sample comprised 2, 003 children (between 4 and 5 years of age) from 98 classrooms in 23 elementary schools in the Netherlands. Teachers {{were asked to complete}} a questionnaire on exposure to victimization for each child. Multilevel analyses revealed that gender and social climate of the school were directly related to victimization. Furthermore, results indicated that peer victimization in boys was less prevalent when they attended smaller schools. In low-SES neighborhoods victimization scores were significantly lower when schools had implemented clear antibullying policies. Finally, variation among school classes appeared to be strongly associated with victimization, even more so than variation among schools. These findings support <b>broadening</b> <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> beyond the individual child at risk. © 2009 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved...|$|E
