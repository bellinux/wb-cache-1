25|$|Marine animals include harbor seals, Steller and California sea lions, {{and river}} otter - {{which may be}} mistaken for a sea otter, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>like</b> to play on the sea shore, but there are no sea otters in this area.|$|E

25|$|The {{reason why}} the {{citizens}} of New York will pay so large {{a part of the}} tax is New York City is the chief financial and commercial centre of a great country with vast resources and industrial activity. For many years Americans engaged in developing the wealth of all parts of the country have been going to New York to secure capital and market their securities and to buy their supplies. Thousands of men who have amassed fortunes in all sorts of enterprises in other states have gone to New York to live <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>like</b> the life of the city or because their distant enterprises require representation at the financial centre. The incomes of New York are in a great measure derived from the country at large. A continual stream of wealth sets toward the great city from the mines and manufactories and railroads outside of New York.|$|E

50|$|It is {{believed}} {{that one of the}} reasons the Habsburgs build the Parenzana railway from Trieste to Poreč was <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>liked</b> the wines from the region (Refosco, Malvasia and Teran).

500|$|The {{decision}} also contradicted previous precedent as to {{the nature}} of evidence. John Baker notes that it violates strong rules which exclude the use of written evidence to interpret a document, unless the evidence was found in said document. Baker also argued that ministerial statements should not be used as evidence because they are irrelevant; [...] "no individual member of Parliament {{is in a position to}} state what that intention is or to speak for the silent majority. Parliament acts as a corporate body and the only expression of its common intention is the text to which the Queen and both Houses have given their unqualified assent. What passes in one House is not formally known to the other". An individual MP's statements, minister or not, may be based on a false understanding of the legal issues; MPs regularly vote for proposals having disagreed with the statements of the spokesman simply <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>like</b> the proposal itself.|$|E

[...] Lyrically, Ivy Queen highlights her position as the queen of reggaeton. [...] "Te Voy A Recordar" [...] (I'm Going To Make You Remember), also in a minor key, also employs a string ensemble and synthesizers. Lyrically, the song describes when the passion in a relationship has been lost. [...] "Me Quiere" [...] (They Like Me) is an R power ballad built on a snapping rhythm. Also in a minor key, it features synthesizers and percussion. In the song, Queen says that people listen to her <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>like</b> her. The lyrics reveal that when she wants it smooth she puts on R. Kelly, and when she is discontented she plays Mary J. Blige (both of whom Queen has said {{she would like to}} work with in the future). The song highlights her hip-hop status. [...] "De La Calle" [...] (From the Street) is an R power ballad exploring the love between two people ("love from the street"), with Queen and De La Ghetto reprising their 2006 collaboration on a remix of Luny Tunes' [...] "Noche de Entierro (Nuestro Amor)".|$|E

2500|$|Critic Erin Young {{believes}} this novel, along with Krentz's other novels Flash and Sharp Edges, are carving {{out a new}} subgenre of the romance novel, the corporate romance.

2500|$|The {{soul that}} is in all things devoted {{to the will of}} God rests quiet in Him, for she knows of {{experience}} and from the Holy Scriptures that the Lord loves us much and watches over our souls, quickening all things by His grace in peace and love. Nothing troubles the man who is given over to the will of God, be it illness, poverty or persecution. He knows that the Lord in His mercy is solicitous for us. The Holy Spirit, whom the soul knows, is witness therefore. But the proud and the self-willed do not want to surrender to God's will <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>like</b> their own way, and that is harmful for the soul.
