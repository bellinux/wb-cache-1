5000|$|The bomb {{is in fact}} Dr. Cliché's second attempt as [...] "his {{first attempt}} failed and instead lead to the {{creation}} of a ball, although, no ordinary ball." [...] The player controls this ball throughout the game. The ball can be transformed into different substances with various materials found in the landscape. Many hazards, including spikes, water, lava, and certain creatures can kill the <b>ball.</b> There are <b>warp</b> spots (save points) at certain places in the game areas. When the ball is killed, it reappears in the last warp spot visited.|$|R
500|$|The slate bed of a {{billiard table}} is often heated to about 5 °C (9 °F) above room temperature, which helps to keep {{moisture}} {{out of the}} cloth to aid the balls rolling and rebounding in a consistent manner, and generally makes a table play faster. A heated table is required under international carom rules and is an especially important requirement for the games of three-cushion billiards and artistic billiards. Heating table beds is an old practice.

40|$|We prove {{explicit}} {{upper and}} lower bounds for the $L^ 1 $-moment spectra for the Brownian motion exit time from extrinsic metric balls of submanifolds $P^m$ in ambient Riemannian spaces $N^{n}$. We assume that $P$ and $N$ both have controlled radial curvatures (mean curvature and sectional curvature, respectively) as viewed from a pole in $N$. The bounds for the exit moment spectra are given in terms of the corresponding spectra for geodesic metric <b>balls</b> in suitably <b>warped</b> product model spaces. The bounds are sharp in the sense that equalities are obtained in characteristic cases. As a corollary we also obtain new intrinsic comparison results for the exit time spectra for metric balls in the ambient manifolds $N^n$ themselves. Comment: 15 page...|$|R
50|$|In {{the process}} of {{manufacture}} the raw cotton is procured by the weavers from the Karnataka State Handicrafts Development Corporation. Cotton 3/10s, an unbleached yarn, {{is used for the}} warp and cotton 10s of 6-ply is used for weft. The yarns could also be purchased from the market in Hubli. After procurement of the required material, pre-weaving process is started. This is a four-stage process. The first step being preparation of warp, which is a set of threads which runs through the length of the durries and which is covered by the weft. The decision on the length of the durrie is dictated by the 3/10s cotton converted into <b>balls.</b> While <b>warp</b> of the small durries are made in the open yard of the house, in the case of larger size durries of say 8 x 12 ft size, the warps are made in large open grounds in the town. Then a detailed work procedure is followed with sticks to warp the required number of threads. This warp is then shifted to the loom inside the house and weaving is done in a set pattern using warp beams of the looms, sticks and threads. The yarn of the weft 10s cotton is then dyed with dyes of black, yellow, red, brown, blue and green colours, mixed with water, and the hanks are kept in the dye solution for 20 minutes before removal and drying. The warp is fixed on the loom (which is of vertical design, quite ancient, unlike the horizontal loom used at the ground level at other places in the country) and adequately stretched to obtain the required tension. The weaving is then started by two weavers facing each other. Patterns are introduced in the warp at the appropriate stage of weaving. Vertical and diagonal lines are marked and weaved suitably. Weft is then covered over the warp, and this covering decides the quality of the durries. Weft is layered over the warp and pressed properly by beating and tamping. The cloth beam is used to wind the cloth as the durrie gets made. The designs are decided by the weavers intuitively. The progress achieved on each loom is about 6 in per day.|$|R
