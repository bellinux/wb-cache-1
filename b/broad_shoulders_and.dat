25|$|Androgens, such as {{testosterone}} and dihydrotestosterone (DHT), are {{the major}} sex hormones in XY chromosomed individuals, and {{are responsible for the}} development and maintenance of masculine secondary sexual characteristics, such as a deep voice, <b>broad</b> <b>shoulders,</b> <b>and</b> a masculine pattern of hair, muscle, and fat distribution. In addition, they stimulate sex drive and the frequency of spontaneous erections and are responsible for acne, body odor, and masculine-pattern scalp hair loss. Androgens act by binding to and activating the androgen receptor (AR), their biological target in the body. In contrast to androgens, antiandrogens are drugs that prevent the effects of androgens in the body. They do this by preventing androgens from binding to the AR or by preventing the production of androgens. The most commonly used antiandrogens in transgender women are cyproterone acetate, spironolactone, and GnRH analogues.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} get into the male psyche, they spend a day at Walthamstow Stadium dog track and {{subsequently}} decide to invent six rules of fashion for men based on the way that the betting information is arranged. The six basic body shapes include man boobs, beer belly, short legs, thick neck, <b>broad</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>and</b> skinny. With each body shape, there includes a list of clothing items men must avoid, and others that are suitable. To test out the rules, Trinny and Susannah travel to a Cumbrian slate mine for the miners to take the rules and go shopping on their own. After the trial, they fear the rules are not simple enough. They seek the help from an advertising company who come {{up with the idea of}} arranging the six rules in the form of the Highway Code, therefore renaming the rules The Male Dress Code. Meanwhile, the fashion duo have arranged for the male section of an Oxford Street department store to be sectioned off to allow a male only day. The section has the six important rules displayed, complete with six live male manikins, one for each body shape, to demonstrate the clothing rules. They also invite some of the civil engineers and slate miners to test the newly formatted rules. Then outside of the store, Trinny and Susannah unveil the six male manikins in the shop window to the women outside.|$|E
500|$|By {{contemporary}} accounts, d'Hautpoul {{was a big}} man, possibly {{taller than}} Joachim Murat, who was nearly six feet tall. Endowed with <b>broad</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>and</b> a big voice. He spoke {{the language of the}} common soldier, and led from the front. Early in the French Revolution, commissioners visited the various regiments to weed out dangerous, and prospectively traitorous nobles; generally, [...] the commissioners cowed the army into submission, but d'Hautpoul's cavalry regiment refused to be intimidated. When the commissioners came for their colonel, a scion of impoverished nobility, his soldiers refused to give him up: [...] "No d'Hautpoul, no 6th Chasseurs." [...] Thus, despite his noble birth, at the exhortations of his soldiers he remained in the French Revolutionary Army.|$|E

500|$|Flashman is [...] tall, weighs [...] (12½ {{stone in}} the first book, {{fourteen}} {{stone in the}} last), has <b>broad</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>and</b> is attractive to women. He was forced into marriage in the first book, after he [...] "caddishly deflowered" [...] Elspeth Morrison, {{the daughter of a}} wealthy Scottish textile manufacturer with whom he had been billeted. Despite being married—and the fact he deeply loves his wife—Flashman is [...] "a compulsive womaniser" [...] who has bedded 480 women by the tenth book in the series, which was set in 1859. Elspeth is also probably unfaithful to him on several occasions. Flashman notes that he has three [...] "prime talents, for horses, languages, and fornication"; he was also described by the master-at-arms of the 11th Hussars as a strong swordsman and was skilled with a lance, particularly at tent pegging. When it is necessary for him to control his fear, he will perform bravely, although is more adept at saving his own skin at the expense of others.|$|E
500|$|Several {{film critics}} have {{described}} Mulan as a tomboy. Andy Patrizio of IGN observed, [...] "In this slightly modernized {{version of the}} story, Mulan... {{is something of a}} rebel and a tomboy. She has no interest in being a good little subservient wife, despite her sighing parents' wishes." [...] Jo Johnson, in contribution to the book Queers in American Popular Culture Volume 1: Film and Television, wrote that [...] "Unlike other Disney heroines, Mulan is immediately coded as a tomboy," [...] observing {{the way in which the}} character speaks using a full mouth. Johnson additionally noticed several ways in which Mulan's design and personality differ from those typically associated with traditional Disney heroines and princesses, citing the character's clumsy, awkward demeanor; <b>broad</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>and</b> muscular limbs; unruly single strand of hair; and choice of everyday attire which usually consists of loose, baggy clothing concealing her [...] "traditionally slim Disney waist." [...] Additionally, Mulan's intelligence has been observed in several professional analyses, with critics often citing the character as [...] "brainy." ...|$|E
2500|$|He was an {{aggressive}} batman, stocky in build like his father, particularly {{later in his}} career, with <b>broad</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>and</b> strong arms.

5000|$|Fleeman is {{described}} as having a large round head with dull hair that stood on end giving the impression he had been [...] "scared out of his wits", <b>broad</b> <b>shouldered</b> <b>and</b> possessing formidable strength.

2500|$|The Amitabha Buddha statue is 1.66meters {{in height}} and {{enshrined}} in Geuknakjeon. This gilt-bronze statue was probably {{cast in the}} late 8th or {{early part of the}} 9th century and it shares the style of National Treasure No.26. The head of the statue is made by fixing two shell-like pieces together. [...] The face has a distinctively aquiline nose. The Buddha has <b>broad</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>and</b> strong chest while the large lap gives the figure a sense of proportional harmony and stability. The style of the robe seems to be more stylized and haphazard. The position of the left hand raised at shoulder-level palm forward and the right hand is placed at the lap. The style of the Buddha seems to follow an abstract and stylized tradition rather than a representation of realism.|$|E
2500|$|According to the pathologist, John Burton Cleland, {{the man was}} of [...] "Britisher" [...] {{appearance}} and thought to be aged about 40–45; he was in [...] "top physical condition". He was [...] "180 centimetres (5ft 11 in) tall, with hazel eyes, fair to ginger-coloured hair, slightly grey around the temples, with <b>broad</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>and</b> a narrow waist, hands and nails that {{showed no signs of}} manual labour, big and little toes that met in a wedge shape, like those of a dancer or someone who wore boots with pointed toes; and pronounced high calf muscles like those of a ballet dancer. These can be dominant genetic traits (dystonia of the toes), and they are also a characteristic of many middle and long-distance runners." [...] He was dressed in a white shirt, red and blue tie, brown trousers, socks and shoes and a brown knitted pullover and fashionable grey and brown double-breasted jacket. All labels on his clothes had been removed, and he had no hat (unusual for 1948) or wallet. The body was clean-shaven and carried no identification, which led police to believe he had committed suicide. His teeth did not match the dental records of any known living person. Coroner Cleland remarked that if the body had been carried to its final resting place then [...] "all the difficulties would disappear".|$|E
2500|$|These {{technically}} rather inferior hydriai are 40–45cm. high. The {{bodies of}} these vases have high and very prominent necks, <b>broad</b> <b>shoulders,</b> <b>and</b> low ring {{feet in the}} form of upside-down chalices. Many of the hydriai are misshapen or show faulty firing. The painted images are in four zones: a shoulder zone, a belly zone with figures and one with ornaments, and a lower section. All but the belly zone with figures are decorated with ornaments. There is only one case of both belly friezes having figures. Their multiple colors distinguish them from all other black-figure styles. The style recalls Ionian vase painting and multicolored painted wooden tablets found in Egypt. Men are shown with red, black or white skin. Women are almost always portrayed with an opaque white color. The contours as well as the details are incised, as is typical for the black-figure style. Surfaces of black glossy slip are often covered with an additional colored slip, so that the black slip which becomes visible where there is scoring supplies the various shapes with internal details. [...] On the front side the images are always full of action, on the back heraldic designs are common. Ornaments are {{an important component of the}} hydrias; they are not subsidiary to other motifs. Stencils were used to paint the ornaments; they are not incised.|$|E

2500|$|His next {{release was}} Ashu Trikha's Deewaanapan, in which Rampal was paired with Dia Mirza. He earned {{critical}} acclaim for his performance, {{but the film}} flopped at the box office. Taran Adarsh of IndiaFM wrote: [...] "Arjun Rampal carries the film on his <b>broad</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>and</b> {{comes up with a}} sincere performance that is consistent throughout. He is wonderful in action sequences and springs a pleasant surprise in the emotional moments by delivering the apposite expressions." [...] Ashish Magotra of Rediff gave negative reviews on Rampal, writing: [...] "Among the actors, Arjun Rampal as the hero does pretty much what he has been known to do. He models. His acting capabilities leave a lot to be desired." [...] His last release of the year was Ashok Mehta's Moksha. It was actually his first film, but was released after Pyaar Ishq Aur Mohabbat. Rampal was paired with famous actress Manisha Koirala in a lead role in Moksha. This film marked Rampal's third consecutive flop at the box office, but Rampal earned critical acclaim. Taran Adarsh of IndiaFM wrote: [...] "Arjun Rampal excels in a role that was difficult to portray. He takes giant strides as a performer and proves that he's an actor with an amazing range." [...] Priyanka Bhattacharya of Rediff considered the movie to be [...] "more a 70-mm portfolio for Arjun Rampal than a story." ...|$|E
2500|$|After the {{occurrence}} of World War I, the Gibson Girl transformed into the Flapper, which dominated {{the period of the}} “Roaring Twenties”. Women transitioned towards androgynous looks, whereby hairstyles were kept short, and wore brassieres that flatten the chest. Loose clothing was also a trend, as it downplayed the waist by lowering it below the navel, resulting in a straight boyish figure. Dress senses soon become more casual as well, and {{is said to have been}} a representation of the reduction in social or political tension after the war, or an extensive disagreement with the Prohibition movement. With advertisements increasingly advocating the need to achieve a thinner frame, many women therefore pursued diets and exercises. Although slimmer body types were favoured, a sporty and healthy appearance was still prized above the frail and sickly look from the Victorian Era.The 1930’s and 1940’s witnessed the devastating effects of the 2nd World War, which unfortunately led to The Great Depression. While men were out on the battlefield, females began entering the workface. This resulted in more formal and traditional military dress styles for women, which caused another shift in body image. While waists’ remained thin but prominent, the media embraced a more curvaceous look similar to the hourglass figure, through the addition of <b>broad</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>and</b> large breasts as well. Since this era was part of the golden age of Hollywood, many celebrities continued to influence this trend by wearing tight fitted clothing that emphasized their figures. Pin-up girls and sex symbols radiating glamour soon followed in the 1950’s, and the proportions of the hourglass figure expanded. Notable names include Marilyn Monroe, Sophia Loren, and Jessica Rabbit. In order to achieve this ideal figure, women consumed weight-gain supplements [...] The release of Playboy magazine and the Barbie doll during this era were other additions in the need to achieve this ideal.Depictions of the perfect woman; however, slowly grew thinner from 1960’s onwards. The “Swinging Sixties” saw a similar look to the Flapper with the emergence of high-fashion model Twiggy, who promoted the thin and petite frame, with long slender legs, and an adolescent but androgynous figure. Other characteristics include, small busts, narrow hips, and flat stomachs. Hence, many women either underwent diets or switched to weight-loss supplements to achieve the new look. This eventually resulted in an increase in anorexia nervosa sufferers during the 1970’s. Nonetheless, greater importance was soon placed on fitness, and actress Farrah Fawcett introduced a more toned and athletic body type. The exercise craze continued in the 1980’s with Jane Fonda and the release of workout videos, motivating women to be thin but fit and svelte. This era also saw the rise of tall, long legged supermodels; such as Naomi Campbell and Cindy Crawford, dominating the industry, and setting a new beauty standard for females around the world.|$|E

50|$|Female dwarfs {{are very}} rarely seen outside dwarf realms {{which has led}} many {{people to believe that}} dwarf males can give birth or that dwarf women have beards. However they are fairly similar to their male {{counterparts}} in that they are <b>broad</b> <b>shouldered</b> <b>and</b> heavily built, but instead of long beards they have long hair wound into similar braids, worn beneath the helmet which they treasure as greatly as males do their beards.|$|R
50|$|Like men, {{who have}} a {{preference}} for a lower waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), a measure linked to female bodily attractiveness, women {{tend to be more}} attracted to men who have <b>broader</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>and</b> relatively narrow waists (the waist-to-chest ratio; WCR). The ratio, changed by the distribution of android fat in the torso, makes the characteristic V-shape and is related to levels of testosterone in males, also correlated with higher perceived dominance of males.|$|R

The color of the thick shell is yellowish white or pale orange, with close narrow, wavy, thread-like longitudinal chestnut strigations, interrupted by a chocolate, fairly narrow, revolving band above the middle. The base is stained chocolate, bordered upwards by progressively lighter bands. The aperture is banded, chocolate and white.|$|R
5000|$|Ideal {{races for}} this type of rider are the one-day {{classics}} in spring.These races are characterized by hills that have a 10-20% gradient and are 1-2 km long, examples include climbs at Liège-Bastogne-Liège, the Mur de Huy in the Flèche Wallonne and the Manayunk Wall in the Philadelphia International Championship. Puncheurs are usually relatively well built, with <b>broader</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>and</b> bigger legs than the average racing cyclist. The physique of this type of rider allows them to escape from the peloton through quick bursts usually with the assistance of a teammate.|$|R
