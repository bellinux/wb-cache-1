We describe for these three migrant categories {{a wide range of}} cross - <b>border</b> <b>ties</b> grouped together through factor analysis into three dimensions: sociopolitical, economic and re - migration. Our findings show that all migrants maintain trans - border activities, with particula r intensity among French overseas migrants. The sociopolitical, economic and re - migration dimensions of cross - border activities are also shown to be affected by similar determinants across the three categories of migrants. Building on the unique opportunit y offered by the data in comparing national and international migrants, our final analysis points towards some common determinants related to the type of the border between the origin and destination places involved in the migration process...|$|R

40|$|The {{globalization}} of economic processes, at first sight, suggests a very inter- related world of homogenous dimensions, with equal opportunities of development for all countries. But reality comes about with another logic: globalization furthers very segmented dynamics, {{where the world}} experiences the paradox of the establishment of regional blocks among countries and regions that are differentiated within such blocks. In this sense, border areas {{are one of the}} spaces where presently, due to one reason or another, peculiar relations occur. There are countries where <b>border</b> <b>ties</b> are expressed as ethnic and religious conflicts, whereas, there are others, in which the most important connections are of an economic and demographic nature. This is the case of the Mexico-US border, space where one of the most intense binational relations between countries takes place.

Our study provides comprehensive evidence on likely qualitative and/or quantitative differences in the values of estimated coefficients as a result of application of an alternative estimation method.

40|$|The study explores Filipino seafarers’ {{integration}} and cross-border practices using a transnational paradigm. As seafarers’ lives span {{the ship and}} the shore, a transnational framework entails looking at whether belongingness is manifested simultaneously {{and the extent to}} which this can be possible. The study’s multi-sited approach considers both the everyday realities in the community and on board the ship including the transnational linkages they maintain and deploy to remain part of both realms. The analyses show that seafarers’ repeated reincorporation and conformity in the community reflects how belongingness is largely constituted as aspirational at home. Integration on board, largely work-oriented and subject to a racialised hierarchy, favours less the social aspect of integration. The limited involvement in both contexts mutually reflects fringe belonging. Under conditions of high mobility, cross-border practices are constrained inasmuch as they are facilitated through access to communication technologies. The ties of reciprocity under extensive kin relations similarly accentuate the strain affecting connection at home. Such conflicting outcomes undermine the connectivity and continuity of social relations that is purportedly enhanced by linking across <b>borders.</b> Such <b>ties</b> are nonetheless employed as a strategy of counteracting labour insecurities despite the burden arising from such tenuous links. This thesis concludes that seafarers evince a form of transactional transnationalism such that they inhabit both worlds only if on board...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 79 - 86). Throughout {{the past}} three decades, a tremendous growth of international migration has coincided with the conceptual development of a transnational perspective among scholars in the social sciences. Increasingly, particular interest {{has been devoted to}} understanding the various connections and linkages that extend beyond national <b>borders</b> and <b>tie</b> distant individuals to one another. A great deal of literature now highlights how transnationalism provides social, political, and economic support for migrants in multiple and seemingly detached places. Although much work in migration studies now acknowledges and addresses some dimension of a transnational perspective, much less has explored its numerous dimensions and diversity, especially its more injurious varieties, which accordingly, are disproportionately experienced. In an effort to extend such an analysis, I trace how transnational networks, between indigenous communities in Oaxaca, Mexico and migrants in Southern California, materialize and are experienced in multiple and contradictory ways, many of which exhibit inequitable and exclusionary characteristics. Such an aim also includes exploring how differences are individually lived and felt through processes of transnationalism and migration. I argue that transnational networks between communities and individuals, in places such as Oaxaca and Southern California, are much more divergent and heterogeneous than previously theorized. Consequently, a more robust analysis of transnationalism and transnational networks - as heterogeneous, ephemeral, or uneven - is necessary to account for the complexity, difference, and plurality of transnational processes in the everyday lives of migrants and their families...|$|R
40|$|Square knots {{are often}} used in open surgery to {{approximate}} tissue <b>borders</b> or <b>tie</b> off tubular structures like vessels or ducts. Three common methods are used for surgical square-knot tying: one-hand tying, two-hand tying, and the instrument-tying technique. Two types of suture placements are studied in both the open and laparoscopic surgical fields. The first called equal length has suture segment ends placed at equal distances from the tying site. The second called unequal length has one suture end further away from the tying site than the other. Laparoscopic intracorporeal squareknot tying maneuvers are analyzed herein. Mechanical analysis of square-knot tying movements reveals that regardless of location or method used in construction, all square knots consist of 2 half-knots. For study purposes, these sets of movements are identified in laparoscopy as maneuver A and maneuver B. Further breakout of these maneuvers reveals that they consist of 5 motions. This study reveals that 16 different ways exist to place a square knot {{by means of the}} laparoscopic intracorporeal technique. It is likely that difficulty mastering this essential skill is not just the result of poor instrumentation, improper port placement, or the limitations of a 2 -dimensional video image. It may also be attributed to mixing up the different square-knot tying techniques during random practice exercises. This is possible if the surgeon is ignorant of the technical variations present in what most people consider a simple task...|$|R
