30|$|For {{some fish}} species {{found in the}} past one or two {{catching}} periods, such as the A. bipunctatus, L. leuciscus and the cyclostoma L. planeri, no definitive population trend analysis is currently available since the time period of their abundance is too short. However, as they are “native” to the <b>barbel</b> <b>region</b> {{it is very likely}} that their numbers will rise in future.|$|E
40|$|The ichthyofauna of the Warta River and its changes {{brought about}} by anthropogenetic factor shave been {{investigated}} for more than fourty years. The investigations have proved that the slightly altered ichthyofauna, which is characteristic for a <b>barbel</b> <b>region,</b> has survived only with in the boundaries of Załęcze Nature Park area. The fragment of the Warta River with in the boundaries is populated by barbus, nase, chub, zarthe and 15 other species of fish {{as well as by}} brook lamprey. In order to preserve the above-mentioned reophilous species and to protect their spawning-grounds the author proposes to establish a strict fauna - preserve (Fig. 1) (for summary see page 375 - 376).

40|$|Based on a {{personal}} research from 1991 - 1994 the ichthyofauna structure of {{the part of the}} Sava river upstream from Zagreb on the section from Podsused to Gradna mouth is presented. The data are being compared with the results of the research of this part of the Sava river before constructing the Krško nuclear power plant. The ichthyological samples were taken seasonally, on various water levels and temperatures of the Sava river. A qualitative and quantitive structure of the fish communities was identified (Tabels 1 to 7). The researched area is populated by fish of the transitional-plain type of the open waters, which means it belongs to the typical <b>barbel</b> <b>region</b> with all the related fish species. The most numerous is the Cyprinidae family, dominated by the chub species (Leuciscus cephalus L.). Around thirty species and subspecies of fish and Cyclostomata populates the area...|$|E
30|$|Furthermore, the S. glanis, G. cernua and C. carpio are {{not typical}} of the <b>barbel</b> <b>region</b> as they are more native to lentic {{habitats}} such as lakes and the lowlands of the Rhine. The increase in their relative abundance might be explained either by the direct connection to lentic harbours and bayous or especially by the rocky structure of the river bank which provides an excellent hiding habitat {{for at least the}} S. glanis and G. cernua. In addition, since the number of catfish was low in the Rhine in the past, this species was restocked several years ago and is now to be found in great numbers. Considering other species found more or less frequently over the 34 -odd years of investigation, it should be mentioned that fish usually migrate along the river but show a preference for a specific river section (as indicated by trout or barbel or bream region). Thus, it is probable that a fish species {{can be found in a}} river section where they are not usually abundant. The E. lucius, for example, was usually caught in the lentic harbour at the BASF SE site which in fact is the more appropriate habitat than the river itself und thus their relative low abundance compared to P. fluviatilis and S. lucioperca is not unexpected [27].|$|E
3000|$|The {{reduction}} in organic carbon load {{also had a}} positive effect on the oxygen content of the water, thus increasing the survival rate of the more oxygen-dependent fish species historically typical of this section of the Rhine (socalled <b>barbel</b> <b>region).</b> In the early 1970 s, oxygen concentrations were close to the lower limit for fish survival, resulting in a reduction of the macroinvertebrate species to about one third of the original 80 species known to be native in this area [22]. So more robust fish species like R. rutilus/S. erythrophthalmus ([...] these species were not exactly differentiated at that time), A. brama and A. anguilla were the predominant species in this section of the Rhine. This is in line with previous observations from the late 1960 s when R. rutilus and A. brama were found to be most abundant and fish species such as B. barbus, S. cephalus and S. lucioperca were rare in this area [23]. However, by the early 1990 s, water quality measurements showed oxygen concentrations close to 100 % saturation with corresponding NH 4 -N, NH 3 -N and P-total concentrations of < 0.5, < 4 and ≤ 20 mg/L, respectively [21]. The improvement in water quality around the BASF SE site is in line with the overall improved water quality observed at other sites along the Rhine [14, 24].|$|E
