5000|$|Ovotransferrin (conalbumin) is a {{glycoprotein}} of {{egg white}} albumen. Egg white albumen {{is composed of}} multiple proteins and ovotransferrin is the most heat reliable protein of them all. It has a molecular weight of 76,000 daltons and contains about 700 amino acids. Ovotransferrin makes up approximately 13% of egg albumen (in contrast to ovalbumin, which comprises 54%). As {{a member of the}} transferrin and metalloproteinase family, ovotransferrin has been found to produce heat shock proteins. When these heat shock proteins are induced in the skin, they provide protection against cold stress and other environmental stresses. Ovotransferrin is folded in a way that forms two lobes (N- and C- terminals) and each lobe consists of a binding site. Each lobe is then divided into two domains of 160 amino acid residues. Its structure also consists of fifteen disulfide crosslinks and no free sulfhydryl groups. Disulfide groups stabilize the tertiary structures of proteins. Transferrins, are iron binding proteins and acute phase reactants of animal serum. It has a <b>binding</b> <b>log</b> of 15 at a pH of 7 or above, meaning that the iron binding capacity of ovotransferrin rapidly decreased at a pH that is less than 6. This family is also known for their role in cell maturation by transporting essential nutrients to developing embryos. [...] Ovotransferrin functions as an antimicrobial agent and transports iron to the developing embryo. Because they bind to iron, this makes it difficult for harmful bacteria to be nutritionally satisfied with them so it acts as an antimicrobial.|$|E

N-Hydroxyarylamines can form adducts with DNA, tissue proteins, and the blood proteins albumin and hemoglobin in a dose-dependent manner. The determination of hemoglobin adducts is {{a useful tool for}} biomonitoring exposed populations. We have established the hemoglobin binding index (HBI) [(mmole compound/mole Hb) /(mmole compound/kg body weight) ] of several aromatic amines and nitroarenes in female Wistar rats. Incorporating values obtained by other researchers in the same rat strain, the logarithm of hemoglobin <b>binding</b> (<b>log</b> HBI) was plotted against several physicochemical parameters and against calculated electronic descriptors of nitroarenes and arylamines. Most arylamines and nitroarenes form hydrolyzable (e. g., sulfinamide) adducts with hemoglobin in rats. The amount of hemoglobin binding decreases with the oxidizability of the arylamines, except for compounds that are substituted with halogens in ortho or meta position. For halogen-substituted arylamines, the amount of hemoglobin binding is directly proportional to the pKa. Hemoglobin binding of nitroarenes increases with the reducibility of the nitro group. The structure activity relationships (SAR) for hemoglobin binding of nitroarenes and arylamines are comparable. The SAR found for hemoglobin binding were compared with the SAR found in the literature for mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, and cytotoxicity of arylamines and nitroarenes. In general, the mutagenicity or carcinogenicity of arylamines increases with their oxidizability. This first set of data suggests that the levels of hemoglobin binding, mutagenicity, and carcinogenicity of arylamines are not determined by the same electronic properties of the compounds, or not by these properties alone.

40|$|Fluorescent ligands {{have found}} {{numerous}} applications for studying interactions of drug molecules with their target {{and as a}} probe of biological systems. A common approach when designing and synthesising a fuorescent ligand is to separate the fluorophore and pharmacophore via a linker. One novel approach is to utilise click chemistry to allow the coupling of fluorophore to a pharmacophore. This thesis reports {{the results of an}} investigation into utilising click chemistry, specifically the alkyne-azide copper (I) cycloaddition to synthesis novel fluorescent GPCR ligands. Targets included the β 1, β 2 adrenoceptor and the muscarinic M 3 receptor. Investigations into the introduction of a 1, 2, 3 -triazole within the linker to the fluorophore resulted in 14 novel fluorescent antagonists active at the β 1 and β 2 adrenoceptor. The most promising ligand had log Ki values of - 6. 77 ± 0. 20 (β 1) and - 7. 32 ± 0. 05 (β 2). These ligands were used in a confocal microscopy studies to visualise the β 1 and β 2 adrenoceptors on the surface of CHO cells. However the ligands internalistion, and receptor visualisation was not possible. A range of structural modifications were made to reduce this with the introduction of a polar linker but this did not reduce the intracellular accumulation. The change to a longer wavelength fluorophore stopped intracellular accumulation but reduced the <b>binding</b> <b>log</b> Ki to - 5. 16 ± 0. 06 (β 1) - 5. 96 ± 0. 20 (β 2). Twenty two novel fluorescent M 3 ligands were synthesised and their inhibitory properties were investigated. An initial screen showed four promising ligands and further study into the binding affinities showed the ligands to have high potency (log Kb - 7. 97 ± 0. 07 to - 8. 89 ± 0. 11). These ligands were studied with confocal microscopy and intracellular accumulation did not occur. Structural changes to include a polar side chain or a sulfonic acid onto the fluorophore were investigated and led to three novel fluorescent ligands that had reduced lipophilicity. With this reduced lipophilicity, binding affinities were also reduced by ten fold compared to the original fluorescent ligand. The seven ligands were fully profiled physiochemically and kinetically. The physioschemical properties of these seven ligands gave a wide variety of lipophilic values. The kinetic profiles of the ligands exhibited very similar dissociation properties to those of the parent ligand with varying association rates. The Muscarinic M 3 ligands synthesised show great binding affinities for fluorescent ligands and kinetic profiles that are extremely similar to the parent ligand. These fluorescent ligands hold characteristics {{that can be used to}} further examine the pharmacology of muscarinic receptors and be used to replace radioligands for binding studies...|$|E
50|$|The {{molecular}} {{structure of the}} GHK copper complex (GHK-Cu) has been extensively studied using X-ray crystallography, EPR spectroscopy, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, NMR spectroscopy {{as well as other}} methods such as titration. In the GHK-Cu complex, the Cu (II) ion is coordinated by the nitrogen from the imidazole side chain of the histidine, another nitrogen from the alpha-amino group of glycine and the deprotonated amide nitrogen of the glycine-histidine peptide bond. Since such a structure couldn’t explain a high stability constant of the GHK-Cu complex (log 10 =16.44 vs. 8.68 of the GH copper complex, which is similar to the GHK-Cu structure), it was proposed that another amino group participates in the complex formation. According to the recent study by Hureau et al. the Cu(II) is also coordinated by the oxygen from the carboxyl group of the lysine from the neighboring complex. Another carboxyl group of lysine from a neighboring complex provides the apical oxygen, resulting in the square-planar pyramid configuration. Many researchers proposed that at the physiological pH, GHK-Cu complexes can form binary and ternary structures which may involve amino acid histidine and/or the copper binding region of the albumin molecule. Lau and Sarkar found also that GHK can easily obtain copper 2+ bound to other molecules such as the high affinity copper transport site on plasma albumin (albumin <b>binding</b> constant <b>log</b> 10 =16.2 vs. GHK <b>binding</b> constant 16 <b>log</b> 10 =16.44).

There are two major classes of motif model representations for sequence preferences of nucleic acidbinding (i. e. DNA-binding or RNA-binding) proteins (NBPs). The models in the first class (hereafter ”word frequency (motif) models”) represent a probability distribution over nucleic acid (NA) words. Models in the second class (hereafter ”affinity-based (motif) models”) parameterize a function that assigns the relative <b>binding</b> affinity (or <b>log</b> <b>binding</b> affinity) of the protein for NA words. Typically, algorithms that learn word frequency models take as input a set of sequences enriched for NBPs binding sites and fit their models using maximum likelihood or penalized maximum likelihood methods.

In contrast, most algorithms that learn affinity-based models directly also take as input a numerical value associated with each sequence. This value is interpreted as a measurement of the binding affinity of the NBP for the sequence. Typically, these types of models require examples of both bound and unbound sequences.

Competitive binding of bismuth to human albumin and transferrin was carried out at pH 7. 4 by FPLC and ICP-MS.

The distribution of bismuth between the two proteins was almost unchanged when Cys 34 of albumin was blocked. However, all bismuth binds to albumin when iron-saturated transferrin was used. Almost all of the bismuth was distributed over the fractions containing transferrin (70 %) and albumin (< 30 %) in serum. The percentage of bismuth associated with transferrin was further increased by 15 % with elevated transferrin in serum. Binding of bismuth to transferrin is much stronger than human albumin.

40|$|A {{new class}} of organic {{molecular}} probes (1 - 3) based on a 1, 3 -disubstituted diethynylbenzene core has been developed. Both 1 and 2 (with the esters of 1 replaced by diethylamides in 2) show good linear and three-photon induced photophysical properties with two-photon absorption cross-sections (185 - 210 cm 4 sphoton- 1 molecule- 1) that are suitable for biological applications in live specimens. The propeller π-conjugated systems of 3 (a C 3 analogue of 1) shows threefold enhancement for the two-photon absorption cross-section (650 cm 4 sphoton - 1 molecule- 1). Solvatochromism was observed in the fluorescence spectra of all these molecular probes; in acidic medium (pH = 4 - 5) their fluorescence emissions are slightly blueshifted with a threefold enhancement in intensity relative to those observed under basic conditions (pH = 10 - 11). In the fluorometric titration study against a variety of bioactive small molecules, only 2 shows strong <b>binding</b> affinity (<b>log</b> KB > 7) towards citrates and bicarbonates with approximately 30 nm redshift. The in vitro emission spectra of 2 obtained show the same emission upon addition of anions to the solution. The results of these studies could provide new molecular-design strategies for two-photo absorption (TPA) chromophores and new materials for two/multi-photon imaging in vitro. A {{new class of}} organic molecular probes has been developed, and the cell-permeable properties were improved dramatically by introducing diethylamide moieties. Only 2 shows strong emission enhancement uponbinding with citrates and bicarbonates. The emission spectra of 2 obtained in vitro show the same emission with citrate and hydrogencarbonate.

40|$|Bovine insulin {{solutions}} (pH= 9. 3) have maximum absorption at 278 2 nm and {{an intrinsic}} emission at 305 nm when excited at 282 nm. The relative fluorescence intensities show linear dependence on its concentration: 10 g/mL< [Ins] < 200 g/mL. When Eu(PDA) 3 − 3 tris complex {{is added to}} these solutions, it has a hyperchromic eect at 278 nm absorption band of insulin, sensitizing the emission intensities of central Eu 3 + metal ion of the complex at 590 and 615 nm, and simultaneously quenching the emission intensity of hormone at 305 nm. Stern-Volmer plots show that a mechanism of bimolecular quenching at 305 nm and sensitization at 615 nm are valid up to a mole ratio, R = [Eu(PDA) 3 − 3]/[Ins] < 2. 0. An intramolecular rather than an intermolecular energy transfer is proposed. An apparent <b>binding</b> constant, <b>log</b> Kapp= 4. 70 0. 13, is calculated for Ins-[Eu(PDA) 3 − 3] 2 type product, the presence of which may oer a new luminescence technique as a diagnostic tool and an alternative to radio-iodinated (131 I-) insulin. A simple, rapid and accurate quantitation of insulin is proposed by using a xed concentration of Eu(PDA) 3 − 3, and measuring its initial F 0 at exc / em= 282 / 615 nm and the dierence, F after sensitization when 100 microliters of insulin sample is added.

40|$|This study {{demonstrated}} that the greater infectivity of stationary-phase promastigotes of Leishmania donovani is related to increased complement fixation on the parasite surface, resulting in increased binding to host mononuclear phagocytes (MPs) via complement type 3 receptors (CR 3). The in vivo infectivity of log- and stationary-phase promastigotes was compared by measuring parasite loads in the livers of BALB/c mice 14 days after i. v. inoculation. The same populations were tested {{for their ability to}} bind to resident murine peritoneal macrophages (RPM) in vitro during a 20 -min serum-free incubation period. Stationary-phase parasites displayed both higher in vivo infectivity and increased in vitro binding. However, following uptake by RPM, {{no significant difference in the}} 72 hr survival of the two populations could be detected. The in vitro <b>binding</b> of <b>log</b> and stationary parasites was uniformly inhibited in the presence of a mAb (M 1 / 70) specific for CR 3, confirming that the interaction of this receptor with its ligand, iC 3 b, plays a vital role in initial attachment of both promastigote populations. Following incubation with a human serum source, the amount of ligand appeared to be greater on the surface of stationary-phase promastigotes, as indicated by their ability to trigger the alternative complement pathway and by solid-phase ELISA measurements using antiserum specific for human C 3. Collectively, these findings suggest that the infectivity of L. donovani promastigotes is influenced by the extent of initial attachment to host MPs, as determined by the levels of complement deposition and subsequent CR 3 -mediated binding...|$|R
40|$|The {{chemical}} speciation of dissolved Cu {{was investigated}} by voltammetric methods in Gullmar Fjord, Sweden, {{over the course}} of a year from September 1996 until August 1997. Sampling was carried out on a roughly monthly basis, with an intensive survey carried out in May 1997. Surface water temperatures ranged from � 1 to 22 �C, whereas bottom waters in the fjord were approximately 6 �C throughout. Macronutrient concentrations in the fjord during the period of the survey were investigated independently by the Göteborgs och Bohus läns Vattenva˚rdsförbund (Water Quality Association of Göteborg and Bohus). Surface phosphate concentrations were highest in early spring with low levels (� 0. 1 �mol kg� 1) over the late spring and summer. Nitrate and silicate showed a similar pattern to phosphate with the exception of high concentrations encountered in surface waters when low salinity plumes caused by runoff were encountered. A period of calm, sunny weather in January 1997 saw the initiation of the spring bloom some 2 months earlier than usual. Dissolved Cu speciation was dominated by organic complexation (over 99. 8 %) throughout this study. Strong Cu <b>binding</b> ligands (<b>log</b> K � 12. 5) were not detected during the winter or early spring and could be related to the temperature-related seasonal appearance of the cyanobacterium Synechoccocus in these waters. The appearance of the strong Cu ligands led to a decrease in the concentration of free copper, resulting in a seasonal cycle for free copper in the fjord. This is the first study to examine Cu speciatio...|$|R
40|$|Protonated biomass of the seaweed Sargassum muticum was {{investigated}} {{for its ability}} to remove cadmium(II) from aqueous solutions. In this work, a nonideal, semiempirical, thermodynamically consistent (NICCA) isotherm was proposed to fit the experimental ion binding data obtained in NaNO 3 0. 05 mol L- 1. This model describes the competition between protons and metal ions satisfactorily. Moreover, it reflects the complexity of the macromolecular systems that take part in biosorption considering the heterogeneity of the sorbent. It was demonstrated in this work that the NICCA isotherm constitutes a great improvement with respect to a simpler Langmuir competitive equation, which was not able to describe all the experimental data satisfactorily. Potentiometric acid-base titrations in the absence of cadmium were made to estimate the maximum amount of acid functional groups (2. 61 mmol g(- 1)) and the conditional proton <b>binding</b> parameters, <b>log</b> (K) over tilde (H) (3. 8) and m(H) (0. 54). The values of the binding parameters for the cadmium ion were chosen to provide the best simultaneous description of the isotherm at pH 4. 5, as well as the dependence of cadmium adsorption on pH. Values of log (K) over tilde (Cd) (3. 1), n(Cd) (1. 8), and p (0. 19) {{in the case of the}} NICCA isotherm or log K-Cd (2. 94 - 3. 4) for Langmuir competitive models were obtained. Kinetic experiments were performed at two different pH values (3. 0 and 4. 5), establishing the time dependence that represents the sorption of cadmium with a pseudo-second-order kinetic model. It was observed that 4 h is enough to ensure that the equilibrium uptake was reached. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{complexation}} of Fe(II) {{with organic}} matter (OM) and especiallywith humic acids (HAs) remains poorly characterized in the literature. In this study, batch experiments {{were conducted on}} a pH range varying from 1. 95 to 9. 90 to study HA-mediated Fe(II) binding. The results showed that high amounts of Fe(II) are complexed with HAdepending on the pH. Experimental datawere used to determine {{a new set of}} binding parameters by coupling PHREEPLOT and PHREEQC-Model VI. The new <b>binding</b> parameters (<b>log</b> KMA = 2. 19 ± 0. 16, log KMB= 4. 46 ± 0. 47 and ΔLK 2 = 3. 90 ± 1. 30) were validated using the LFER (linear free energy relationship) method and published adsorption data between Fe(II) and Suwannee River fulvic acid (SRFA) (Rose andWaite, 2003). Theywere then put in PHREEQC-Model VI to determine the distribution of Fe(II) onto HA functional groups. It was shown that Fe(II) forms mainly bidentate complexes, some tridentate complexes and only a few monodentate complexes with HA. Moreover, Fe(II) is mainly adsorbed onto carboxylic groups at acidic and neutral pH, whereas carboxy-phenolic and phenolic groups play a major role at basic pH. The major species adsorbed onto HA functional groups is Fe 2 +; Fe(OH) + appears at basic pH (frompH 8. 13 to 9. 9). The occurrence of OMand the resulting HA-mediated binding of Fe(II) can therefore influence Fe(II) speciation and bioavailability in peatlands and wetlands, where seasonal anaerobic conditions prevail. Furthermore, the formation of a cationic bridge and/or the dissolution of Fe(III) -(oxy) hydroxides by the formation of Fe(II) -OM complexes can influence the speciation of other trace metals and contaminants such as As...|$|R
40|$|Dissolved {{organic matter}} (DOM) is a {{universal}} part of all aquatic systems that largely originates with the decay {{of plant and animal}} tissue. Its polyelectrolytic and heterogeneous characters make it an effective metal-complexing agent with highly diverse characteristics. Microbes utilize DOM as a source of nutrients and energy and their enzymatic activity may change its composition, thereby altering the bioavailability and toxicity of metals. This study investigated the impacts of microbial inoculation upon the optical and copper-binding properties of freshly produced leaf-litter leachate over 168 [*]h. Copper speciation was measured using voltammetry, and using fluorescence quenching analysis of independent fluorophores determined using parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC). Two protein/polyphenol-like and two fulvic/humic-like components were detected. Thirty-five percent of total protein/polyphenol-like fluorescence was removed after 168 -h of exposure to riverine microbes. The microbial humic-like and tryptophan-like PARAFAC components retained significantly different log K values after 168 [*]h of incubation (p[*]<[*] 0. 05), while their complexing capacities were similar. Using voltammetry, a sixfold increase in copper-complexing capacity (CC, from 130 to 770 [*]μmol[*]Cu[*]g[*]C− 1) was observed over the exposure period, while the conditional <b>binding</b> constant (<b>log</b> K) decreased from 7. 2 to 5. 8. Overall binding parameters determined using voltammetry and fluorescence quenching were in agreement. However, the electrochemically based binding strength was significantly greater than that exhibited by any of the PARAFAC components, which {{may be due to the}} impact of non-fluorescent DOM, or differences in the concentration ranges of metals analyzed (i. e., different analytical windows). It was concluded that the microbial metabolization of maple leaf leachate has a significant impact upon DOM composition and its copper-binding characteristics...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Methanobactin (mb) is a small, copper binding {{bioactive}} peptides {{produced by}} methanotrophs. The transition between {{two forms of}} methane monooxygenase (MMO) expressed by methanotrophs depends {{on the amount of}} copper available in the surrounding. In this paper, the bioavailability of copper() in the presence of different chelating agents to a representative methanotroph, Methylosinus trichosporium 3011 is studied systematically according to the naphthalene oxidation assay. The result shows that purple naphthol diazo complex may be measured at A 530, and along with the increase of the concentration of the copper(), eight kinds of chelating agents have effect on the activity of sMMO. The copper bioavailability has been assessed after the changes in sMMO activity is monitored, it means that copper() can repress the expression of sMMO as well as reduce its activity. The affinity of mb excreted during growth was also measured and the chelate constants of the chelating agents to copper() are compared. Based on these studies, strongly <b>binding</b> chelating agents (<b>Log</b> K> 16) added into the medium at a concentration of 20 uM were able to reduce copper bioavailability...|$|R
40|$|This work {{reports a}} {{promising}} {{approach to the}} development of novel self-buffering and biocompatible ionic liquids for biological research in which the anions are derived from biological buffers (Good's buffers, GB). Five Good's buffers (Tricine, TES, CHES, HEPES, and MES) were neutralized with four suitable hydroxide bases (1 -ethyl- 3 -methylimidazolium, tetramethylammonium, tetraethylammonium, and tetrabutylammonium) producing 20 Good's buffer ionic liquids (GB-ILs). The presence of the buffering action of the synthesized GB-ILs was ascertained by measuring their pH-profiles in water. Moreover, a series of mixed GB-ILs with wide buffering ranges were formulated as universal buffers. The impact of GB-ILs on bovine serum albumin (BSA), here used as a model protein, is discussed and compared with more conventional ILs using spectroscopic techniques, such as infrared and dynamic light scattering. They appear to display, in general, a greater stabilizing effect on the protein secondary structure than conventional ILs. A molecular docking study was also carried out to investigate on the binding sites of GB-IL ions to BSA. We further used the QSAR-human serum albumin <b>binding</b> model, <b>log</b> K(HSA), to calculate the binding affinity of some conventional ILs/GB-ILs to HSA. The toxicity of the GB and GB-ILs was additionally evaluated revealing that they are non-toxic against Vitro fischeri. Finally, the GB-ILs were also shown to be able to form aqueous biphasic systems when combined with aqueous solutions of inorganic or organic salts, and we tested their extraction capability for BSA. These systems were able to extract BSA with an outstanding extraction efficiency of 100 % in a single step for the GB-IL-rich phase, and, as a result, the use of GB-IL-based ABS for the separation and extraction of other added-value biomolecules is highly encouraging and worthy of further investigation...|$|R
