5|$|There were {{no further}} Test matches before the First World War. The 1912–13 Australian season {{was a short}} one for Macartney, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> rare form, scoring 125, 96, 94, 76 not out, 91, 10 and 154 in four matches, to total 646 runs at 107.66. He also took four wickets at 30.50.|$|E
5|$|Castelli was {{not well}} {{received}} in Córdoba, where Liniers was popular, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> San Miguel de Tucumán. In Salta, despite a formal good reception, he had difficulty obtaining troops, mules, food, money, or guns. He took political leadership of the expedition to Upper Peru, displacing Hipólito Vieytes, and replaced Ocampo with Colonel Antonio González Balcarce. He was informed that Cochabamba revolted {{in support of the}} Junta, but was threatened by royalist forces from La Paz. Castelli intercepted a letter from Nieto to Gutiérrez de la Concha, governor of Córdoba, who was already executed for his support of Liniers. This letter mentioned a royalist army led by Goyeneche marching to Jujuy. Balcarce, who had advanced to Potosi, was defeated by Nieto in the Battle of Cotagaita, so Castelli sent two hundred men and two cannon to strengthen his forces. With these reinforcements, Balcarce achieved victory at the Battle of Suipacha, which allowed patriots to control all of Upper Peru unopposed. One of the men sent was Martín Miguel de Güemes, who would eventually lead the Guerra Gaucha in Salta years later.|$|E
5|$|When the {{operation}} was still in its development stages, Armstrong and Colonel Roscoe C. Wilson were the leading candidates to command the group who was designated to drop the atomic bomb. Wilson was the Army Air Force project officer who provided liaison support to the Manhattan Project. Armstrong was an experienced combat veteran against German targets, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> his forties and had been severely injured in {{a fire in the}} summer of 1943. Wilson had no combat experience and was qualified primarily because of his engineering background and association with the project. Tibbets was considerably younger than both men and had experience in both staff and command duties in heavy bomber combat operations. He was already an experienced B-29 pilot, which made him an ideal candidate for the top-secret project.|$|E

After the {{visitors}} collapsed for 97, Simpson then added 221 not out and took a total of 2/69 to help defeat the Caribbeans. He was then selected for an Australian XI in a virtual Test trial against the West Indies, but made only a duck and 17 and took a total of 1/103. In the last two matches before the Tests, against South Australia, Simpson's batting tapered off with 120 runs in four innings, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> fine form with the ball, taking a total of 11/206.|$|E

As a result of taking several legions and numerous auxiliary regiments with him to Parthia, Trajan had left Dacia and the remaining Danubian provinces below strength. The Roxolani, angry over a Roman decision to cease the payments to which Trajan had agreed, allied themselves with the Iazyges and both tribes revolted against Rome. Therefore, Hadrian dispatched the armies from the east ahead of him, and departed Syria {{as soon as he was}} able.|$|E

25|$|Goldman {{also claimed}} that when Lennon started making music again in 1980 {{following}} a long hibernation, {{he was not}} immune to Manhattan's cocaine-fueled disco scene. According to Goldman, on the day Lennon was murdered {{he was scheduled to}} undergo plastic surgery several days later to repair his nasal septum (due to snorting cocaine, which he supposedly did at the Hit Factory recording studio where he recorded his album Double Fantasy). Goldman did not cite a single name of anyone who might have witnessed this at the studio. Goldman alleged further that on December 8, 1980 (the day of Lennon's murder) not only did the singer's cocaine snorting warrant plastic surgery, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> such bad physical condition from drug abuse and lack of exercise that during his autopsy the medical examiner recorded observations to that effect, overlooking the four bullet wounds momentarily.|$|E
25|$|Emir Mahfuz, {{who would}} fight with {{successive}} emperors, caused {{the death of}} Emperor Na'od in 1508, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> turn killed {{by the forces of}} Emperor Dawit II (Lebna Dengel) in 1517. After the death of Mahfuz, a civil war started for the office of Highest Emir of Adal. Five Emirs came to power in only two years. But at last, a matured and powerful leader called Garad Abuun Addus (Garad Abogne) assumed power. When Garad Abogne was in power he was defeated and killed by Sultan Abu Bakr ibn Muhammad, and In 1554, under his initiative, Harar became the capital of Adal. This time not only the young Emirs revolted, but the whole country of Adal rose against Sultan Abu Bakr, because Garad Abogne was loved by the people of the sultanate. Many people went to join the force of a young imam called Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi, who claimed revenge for Garad Abogne. Al-Ghazi assumed power in Adal in 1527, however he did not remove the Sultan, but instead left him in his nominal office. Yet, when Abu Bakr waged war on him, Ahmad ibn Ibrahim killed Abu Bakr, and replaced him with his brother Umar Din.|$|E

Oxford (Harley) and St John had no intention of letting Britain's new Captain-General undertake any action, and issued Ormonde his [...] "restraining orders" [...] in May, forbidding him to use British troops in action against the French – an infamous step that ultimately ruined Eugene's campaign in Flanders.

500|$|Before {{the move}} to Broadway, the {{creative}} team hired director Tom O'Horgan, who had built a reputation directing experimental theater at the La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club. [...] He had been the authors' first choice to direct the Public Theater production, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> Europe at the time. [...] Newsweek described O'Horgan's directing style as [...] "sensual, savage, and thoroughly musical... disintegrates verbal structure and often breaks up and distributes narrative and even character among different actors.... He enjoys sensory bombardment." [...] In rehearsals, O'Horgan used techniques passed down by Viola Spolin and Paul Sills involving role playing and improvisational [...] "games". [...] Many of the improvisations tried during this process were incorporated into the Broadway script. O'Horgan and new choreographer Julie Arenal encouraged freedom and spontaneity in their actors, introducing [...] "an organic, expansive style of staging" [...] {{that had never been}} seen before on Broadway. [...] The inspiration to include nudity came when the authors saw an anti-war demonstration in Central Park where two men stripped naked as an expression of defiance and freedom, and they decided to incorporate the idea into the show. [...] O'Horgan had used nudity in many of the plays he directed, and he helped integrate the idea into the fabric of the show.|$|E
