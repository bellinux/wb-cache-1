5|$|For Metal Gear Solid 4, Raiden's {{new design}} was a {{response}} to the criticism that only his face remained in his cybernetic body. Shinkawa, himself, was surprised <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> came to illustrate Raiden. The staff noted that Raiden's debut in the Metal Gear Solid 4 trailer received notably positive responses; several video-game magazines promoted the game with Raiden's screenshots. Kojima echoed similar comments, indicating that he wanted to expand the character with another game. In designning him, Shinkawa wanted to convey both Raiden's beauty as well as sorrow in his cybernetic body. He was also made so that he could wield swords with his own legs giving the players the impressions he was a ninja. Raiden's first fight against Vamp in the game caused difficulty to motion and voice actors because of carefully planned movements performed by the two fighters. The staff was nevertheless satisfied with the outcome, considering it one of the best battles in the game. For the motion capture of Raiden, two actors were selected: one did most of his appearances while another did his action sequences.|$|E

500|$|Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club {{said that}} he was scared <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> liked the episode despite it {{focusing}} on Wesley. He noticed the similarity between the [...] "legendary" [...] planets of Aldea in the episode and Magrathea in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, a reference Handlen considered possibly deliberate. He thought that the child-heavy episode wasn't [...] "as bad as it could've been", and gave the episode a [...] "B" [...] grade. Michelle Erica Green in her review for TrekNation, described [...] "When the Bough Breaks" [...] as [...] "tedious, plodding and didactic" [...] with a [...] "preposterous" [...] ending. She thought that the plot element of ozone damage was not optimal and that the quality of the episode was typical of the first season.|$|E

500|$|In 2001, Frusciante began {{recording}} {{his fourth}} album with Red Hot Chili Peppers, By the Way (2002); {{he considered the}} time to be among the happiest in his life. He relished the chance the album gave him to [...] "keep writing better songs". While working on <b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>Way,</b> <b>he</b> also composed most of what would become Shadows Collide with People, as well as the songs created for the movie The Brown Bunny. His goal to improve his guitar playing on the album was largely driven by a desire to emulate guitar players such as Andy Partridge, Johnny Marr and John McGeoch; or as he put it, [...] "people who used good chords". The album marked Frusciante's shift to a more group-minded mentality within the Chili Peppers, viewing the band as a cohesive unit rather than as four separate entities.|$|E
500|$|Arcturus Mengsk {{has been}} left to rebuild the Dominion, and is {{consolidating}} his power while fending off harassment from rival Terran groups. [...] Mengsk has become power-hungry, declaring Jim Raynor an outlaw and showing little desire to protect or aid the colonies under his jurisdiction. [...] Valerian Mengsk, a character introduced in the novel Firstborn, will {{play an important role}} in Dominion politics, due to his position as heir apparent to the throne. Meanwhile, Jim Raynor, whose role in the events of StarCraft and Brood War has been marginalized by the media under the Dominion's control, has become a mercenary who spends his free time drinking in Joeyray's Bar. Chris Metzen, Vice President of Creative Development at Blizzard, has emphasized that by the events of StarCraft II, Raynor has become jaded and embittered <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> was used and betrayed by Arcturus Mengsk. Other new characters to the series include Tychus Findlay, an ex-convict and marine who becomes a member of Raynor's crew, and Matt Horner, Raynor's second in command, a character originally featured in the novel Queen of Blades.|$|E
500|$|Pei's first {{proposed}} design included a large glass pyramid that would fill the interior with sunlight, meant {{to represent the}} optimism and hope that Kennedy's administration had symbolized for so many in the US. Mrs. Kennedy liked the design, but resistance began in Cambridge, the {{first proposed}} site for the building, {{as soon as the}} project was announced. Many community members worried that the library would become a tourist attraction, causing particular problems with traffic congestion. Others worried that the design would clash with the architectural feel of nearby Harvard Square. By the mid-70s, Pei tried proposing a new design, but the library's opponents resisted every effort. These events pained Pei, who had sent all three of his sons to Harvard, and although he rarely discussed his frustration, it was evident to his wife. [...] "I could tell how tired he was <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> opened the door {{at the end of the}} day," [...] she said. [...] "His footsteps were dragging.

500|$|The band {{took the}} {{approach}} of recording one song at a time, and agreed with O'Brien to mix the songs as each one was finished. O'Brien had the band members set up {{much as they do}} live, and most of the songs were developed out of jam sessions. Guitarist Stone Gossard said, [...] "I think we allowed things to develop in a more natural, band-oriented sort of way, rather than me bringing in a bunch of stuff that was already arranged." [...] Gossard added that most of the songs were arranged once Vedder joined in and started singing, elaborating, [...] "You could tell when the music wanted to change just <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> was singing." [...] In a 2009 interview, Gossard stated, [...] " [...] was probably where it felt better recording wise. I saw how it could change and evolve which gave me a lot of inspiration to go we can do ballads, we can do fast stuff, we can do slow stuff, we can do punk stuff. That was where I realized there were gonna be a lot of places to go with Ed." ...|$|E
500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Bioscope from December 22, 1910. It states: [...] "A shortage is discovered in the accounts of John Hill, a young bank cashier. The manager of the bank agrees to give him three days' time in which to make good the shortage. John confides in his young wife, May, and a young reporter interviews May about her husband's shortage. He becomes interested in the plucky young woman, and decides to suppress the story. The husband fails to raise the money, and leaves his clothes, with a note telling of his intended suicide, on a wharf at the water's edge. After five years the young reporter wins May for his bride. On the day of their wedding, John is attracted to {{the house where the}} ceremony is to take place. Hearing of the many rich gifts which the bride has received, he enters the house, and witnesses a love scene between the young reporter and his (John's) wife. He finds it impossible to escape <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> entered, and attempts to leave by the floor window, falls to the ground and is killed. Here Hastings finds him, and has the body carried away, and leads May to the altar." ...|$|E
500|$|In early 2005, Frusciante {{entered the}} studio {{to work on his}} fifth and final studio album with the Chili Peppers, Stadium Arcadium. His guitar playing is {{dominant}} throughout the album, and he provides backing vocals on most of the tracks. Although usually following a [...] "less is more" [...] style of guitar playing, he began using a full twenty-four track mixer for maximum effect. In the arrangements, he incorporates a wide array of sounds and playing styles, similar to the funk-influenced Blood Sugar Sex Magik or the more melodic <b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>Way.</b> <b>He</b> also changed his approach to his playing, opting to contribute solos and allow songs to be formed from jam sessions. In an interview from Guitar World, Frusciante explained how he approached his guitar solos for their album Stadium Arcadium completely differently from those for their previous albums. On Blood Sugar Sex Magik and Californication, Frusciante had a general idea how he wanted his guitar solos to sound. For Stadium Arcadium, almost every guitar solo was completely improvised by Frusciante on the spot. Several reviews have stressed that the influence of Hendrix is evident in his solos on the album, with Frusciante himself backing this up. He also expanded the use of guitar effects throughout the album, and used various other instruments such as the synthesizer and mellotron. He worked continuously with Rubin over-dubbing guitar progressions, changing harmonies and using all his technical resources.|$|E

6000|$|Richards professed himself delighted, {{and shook}} hands with Babington with a fervour which seemed to imply that until he had met him life had been a dreary blank, but that now he could begin to enjoy himself again.

2500|$|History {{professor}} Ellen Fitzpatrick of the University of New Hampshire said that, [...] "It {{was really}} a sign of what we expect from our president, that is what a leader does {{in a time of}} crisis and division and tragedy is to reduce, not heighten tensions. And I thought by his example, the way he described the humanity of all of the people involved in this tragic event, that he showed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> spoke and what he asked Americans to do. He led by his own example in a very powerful way." ...|$|E
2500|$|Another related {{instrument}} is the callioflute, {{a type of}} hydraulophone played by blocking one or more water jets with the fingers. [...] Blocking a water jet forces water into a heater that converts it to steam. [...] While not a hydraulophone in the strictest sense (sound is produced by steam rather than by water) it facilitates the same expressive capabilities (i.e. polyphonic embouchure) that a hydraulophone facilitates. [...] In this sense, the callioflute improves on the calliope, in that the callioflute lets a musician make subtle changes in pitch, timbre, volume, and tone, <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> obstructs the water jets with the fingers.|$|E

2500|$|Persons {{of such a}} {{constitution}} will be dragged back into corporeal life, according to Socrates. These persons will even be punished while in Hades. Their punishment will be of their own doing, as they {{will be unable to}} enjoy the singular existence of the soul in death because of their constant craving for the body. These souls are finally [...] "imprisoned in another body". Socrates concludes that the soul of the virtuous man is immortal, and the course of its passing into the underworld is determined <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> lived his life. The philosopher, and indeed any man similarly virtuous, in neither fearing death, nor cherishing corporeal life as something idyllic, but by loving truth and wisdom, his soul will be eternally unperturbed after the death of the body, and the afterlife will be full of goodness.|$|E
2500|$|Former inmate Leon [...] "Whitey" [...] Thompson, {{who worked}} as a guide at Alcatraz for many years and later visited it {{regularly}} before his death in 2005, believed that Alcatraz Island is haunted and has stated that [...] "he could feel it" [...] while he was incarcerated there. [...] He later believed the prison to be [...] "damned", and often had the sense of being watched by spirits. During his time in the prison, Thompson was friendly with an inmate named Johnny Haus, a big Texan. He last saw him on 25 October 1962 when he left Alcatraz and knew he'd never see Haus again. One day in the 1980s when Thompson was alone in the cellhouse waiting for visitors to arrive for a tour, he claimed to have seen a large dark figure {{at the end of the}} [...] "Michigan Avenue" [...] corridor. [...] He saw the apparition walk around the corner and out of sight. Thompson rushed to the end of the corridor, but nobody was there. He believed the ghost to be that of Haus, <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> walked and the feeling which the figure gave off. [...] Afterwards, Thompson said [...] "I don't care what anybody says, that was Johnny Haus".|$|E
