The station's coal storage area would have stored a minimum 45 days worth of coal supply. All of the station's pulverised fuel ash (PFA) may have been sold to the construction industry, transported to which in dry dust tankers. Unsold PFA and furnace bottom ash would be taken to a landfill site by road.|$|E
5|$|Hypothyroidism {{is managed}} with {{replacement}} of the hormone thyroxine. This is usually given daily as an oral supplement, and may take {{a few weeks to}} become effective. Some causes of hypothyroidism, such as Postpartum thyroiditis and Subacute thyroiditis may be transient and pass over time, and other causes such as iodine deficiency may <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> rectified with dietary supplementation.|$|E
5|$|Nike-X also {{considered}} a cut down version of MAR known as TACMAR. This {{was essentially a}} MAR {{with half of the}} elements hooked up, reducing its price at the cost of shorter detection range. The processing equipment was likewise reduced in complexity, lacking some of the more sophisticated discrimination processing. TACMAR was designed from the start to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> upgraded to full MAR performance if needed, especially as the sophistication of the threat grew. MAR-II is sometimes described as the prototype TACMAR, but there is considerable confusion on this point in existing sources.|$|E

5|$|The {{station was}} the first to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> resupplied by the newly {{developed}} unmanned Progress freighters, although they could only dock at the rear port, as the front port lacked the plumbing used to refuel the propulsion system. The freighters docked automatically to the station via the Igla, and were then opened and emptied by the cosmonauts on board, whilst transfer of fuel to the station took place automatically under supervision from the ground.|$|E
5|$|To promote {{comfortable}} and accurate shooting from {{a standing position}} match air pistols must have fast lock times, shoot practically recoilless and vibration free and exhibit minimal movement and balance shifts during discharge. The pistol must also <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> tailored by adjustable user interfaces and various accessories to individual shooters personal preferences. Combined with appropriate match pellets the pistol has to produce a consistent 10 ring performance, so a non maximal result during the initial phase {{can be attributed to}} the participant.|$|E
5|$|Weather {{disasters}} {{and other natural}} occurrences are also sources of mortality. The West Indian manatee and Dugong face risks from hurricanes and cyclones, which are predicted to increase in the future. These storms may also damage seagrass populations. Exposure to brevetoxin from Karenia brevis during a red tide event are also sources of mortality; they may <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> exposed to brevetoxin after a red tide has subsided, as it could settle on seagrasses. African manatees can become stranded {{during the dry season}} when rivers and lakes become too small or dry up completely.|$|E

5|$|Days {{after the}} storm, fears of food {{shortages}} began to arise as railways, in which food would normally <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> delivered, were washed out. To {{deal with the}} large number of bodies {{in the wake of the}} disaster, Mexican officials decided to cremate and mass bury victims. By mid-September, between 1,600 and 1,800 people were hired to repair and rebuild the devastated railways in Nuevo León. In 2009, the third edition of the book El Río Fiera Bramaba: 1909 by Oswaldo Sánchez, re-accounting reports form people who experienced the flood, was planned. According to the director of publications at the Universidad Autónoma de Nuevo León, the book was considered one of historical quality. In memory of those who perished during the flood, the book was released to the public on August27, 2009, the 100year anniversary of the disaster.|$|E
5|$|Johnson was SI.com's Midseason 2007 NFL Draft Projection #1pick, though Johnson had {{stated that}} he {{intended}} to earn his degree from Georgia Tech. On January 8, 2007, Johnson declared himself eligible for the NFL Draft, bypassing his senior season at Georgia Tech. He was regarded as the best athlete {{to come out of the}} draft and was the #1player on most draft boards. Johnson was said by ESPN to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> productive as a rookie, much like receiver Randy Moss was as a rookie. In a mid-February workout with speed and conditioning coach Mark Pearsall, Johnson clocked a 4.33-second 40-yard dash, recorded an 11-foot standing broad jump, and had a vertical leap of 43inches.|$|E
5|$|The 61st Division {{retained}} its three infantry brigades, {{although there were}} changes to the divisional troops along the above lines. It was intended that the division would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> transferred by air to any theatre of war, and its personnel trained to fight in any terrain encountered. Once on the ground, the entire division would be mobile utilizing only jeeps. To help adapt to this new role, training exercises were carried out. The initial destination for the division was the Far East to support the fight against Imperial Japan. However, the Japanese surrender resulted in the move being cancelled, and the division never left the United Kingdom. In November, the division, over six {{years after it was}} formed, was disbanded.|$|E

5|$|Chaos;Head was {{originally}} released for Microsoft Windows on April 25, 2008 by Nitroplus. Around June {{of the same}} year, {{it was decided to}} port the game to Xbox 360. This version was released on February 26, 2009 under the title Chaos;Head Noah, and includes new content. Chaos;Head Noah was ported to multiple platforms: it was released for the PlayStation Portable on June 24, 2010, for iOS on November 18, 2010, for Android on January 24, 2012, and for PlayStation 3 on November 22, 2012. While the Xbox 360 version was given a Z rating (18 years and up) by CERO, the PlayStation Portable and PlayStation 3 versions were edited to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> released with a D rating (17 years and up). The PlayStation Vita version bundled the Z-rated version of Chaos;Head Noah with the follow-up Chaos;Head Love Chu Chu! under the title Chaos;Head Dual, and was released on August 21, 2014.|$|E
5|$|Isaac Newton had demonstrated, using prisms, {{that white}} lights, such as sunlight, are {{composed}} {{of a number of}} monochromatic components which could then be recombined into white light. Newton also showed that an orange paint made of yellow and red could look exactly like a monochromatic orange light, although being composed of two monochromatic yellow and red lights. Hence the paradox that puzzled physicists of the time: two complex lights (composed of more than one monochromatic light) could look alike but be physically different, called metameres. Thomas Young later proposed that this paradox could be explained by colours being perceived through a limited number of channels in the eyes, which he proposed to be threefold, the trichromatic colour theory. Maxwell used the recently developed Linear algebra to prove Young's theory. Any monochromatic light stimulating three receptors should <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> equally stimulated by a set of three different monochromatic lights (in fact, by any set of three different lights). He demonstrated that to be the case, inventing colour matching experiments and Colourimetry.|$|E
5|$|It's not literal {{about the}} drug for me, I've never taken lithium before. It's sort of a metaphor about {{numbness}} and happiness... it's me looking at happiness {{in a negative way}} because I've always been... kind of afraid to be happy. Like with the band and the art and everything else, it's always like I'm never letting myself break through into the happiness it seems like, because it's not cool or something. And describing happiness is lithium, it's like saying 'that's numbness, I won't <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an artist anymore if I'm happy', which is hilarious because that's just not true, I'm happy. So it's... this fight within the song of... 'do I do this and get out of here and get happy or do I wallow in it like I always do?' and it's cool because {{at the end of the}} song I say 'I'm going to let it go', like I am going to be happy.|$|E

5|$|Jim Henson {{originally}} {{conceived of}} his Muppets as characters aimed at an adult audience. He {{was disappointed that}} {{the popularity of the}} characters that appeared in Sesame Street, including Big Bird and Bert and Ernie, had solidified a public perception his Muppets were solely intended for educating children. Henson worried he would be stuck forever working on children's television series. He felt his Muppet characters should <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> appreciated by individuals of any maturity level. Henson told The Saturday Evening Post he had constantly dealt with others looking down upon the idea of puppet performers. He envied ventriloquist Edgar Bergen for his ability to appeal to a mature audience. Henson said he wanted to work on a program that was broadcast during the peak adult-viewing time and said he had prior difficulty persuading the major television networks to create a puppet program for mature audiences.|$|E
5|$|Megan's lawyer ex-husband Todd (Jeffrey Nordling) {{arrives at}} Megan's work, needing {{forensic}} testing for evidence {{that his client}} Manny Santos (Carlos Apostle), is a juvenile. Kate Murphy (Jeri Ryan) greets him, and she asks Curtis Brumfield (Windell Middlebrooks) to help examine him. Curtis finds evidence which suggests Manny has received recent trauma to ribs and other body parts, suggesting that he’s being abused. Curtis explains to Todd that Manny is a juvenile, but he will not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> released back to his former home, as he is being abused there. Meanwhile, the evidence for the murderer fits a partial match to Mike, so Megan concludes that Ed is not Mike's father. She goes to visit Jen; however she slams the door in her face. Megan walks into her house and finds Mike's real father Tim (Timothy Devlin), holding Ed's and Jen's baby daughter hostage. Tim takes Jen into the garden when the police arrive, so Bud shoots him in the leg and arrests him and Jen is reunited with Sophie and Mike.|$|E
5|$|Scottish estate {{houses were}} {{increasingly}} adorned with paintings, including portraits, landscapes and later classical, genre and historical paintings. Thomas Warrender (fl. 1673–1713) {{made his living}} as a house decorator, working closely with architects, including William Adam. He may have trained James Norie (1684–1757), who with his sons James (1711–36) and Robert (d. 1766) also worked with the Adams, painting the houses of the peerage with Scottish landscapes that were pastiches of Italian and Dutch scenes. They tutored many artists and have been credited with {{the inception of the}} tradition of Scottish landscape painting that would come to fruition from the late eighteenth century. The painters Allan Ramsay (1713–84), Gavin Hamilton (1723–98), the brothers John (1744–68/9) and Alexander Runciman (1736–85), Jacob More (1740–93) and David Allan (1744–96), mostly began {{in the tradition of the}} Nories, but were artists of European significance, spending considerable portions of their careers outside Scotland. Henry Raeburn (1756–1823) was the most significant artist of the eighteenth century to pursue his entire career in Scotland, and from this point Scottish painters would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> professionals in their homeland, often supplying the nobility and lairds with works to fill the walls of their houses.|$|E

5|$|Sometimes, {{a single}} rank of pipes may <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{controlled}} by several stops, allowing the rank {{to be played}} at multiple pitches or on multiple manuals. Such a rank {{is said to be}} unified or borrowed. For example, an 8 Diapason rank may also be made available as a 4 Octave. When both of these stops are selected and a key (for example, c) is pressed, two pipes of the same rank will sound: the pipe normally corresponding to the key played (c), and the pipe one octave above that (c). Because the 8 rank does not have enough pipes to sound the top octave of the keyboard at 4 pitch, it is common for an extra octave of pipes used only for the borrowed 4 stop to be added. In this case, the full rank of pipes (now an extended rank) is one octave longer than the keyboard.|$|E
5|$|The {{architecture}} of the Xgrid system is designed around a job based system; the controller sends agents jobs, and the agents return the responses. The actual computation that the controller executes in an Xgrid system {{is known as a}} job. The job contains all the files required to complete the task successfully, such as the input parameters, data files, directories, executables and/or shell scripts, the files included in an Xgrid job must <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> executed either simultaneously or asynchronously, or any benefits of running such a job on an Xgrid is lost. Once the job completes, the controller can be set to notify the client of the task's completion or failure, for example by email. The client can leave the network while the tasks are running. It can also monitor the job status on demand by querying the controller, although it cannot track the ongoing progress of individual tasks.|$|E
5|$|The cardiac {{examination}} includes inspection, {{feeling the}} chest with the hands (palpation) and listening with a stethoscope (auscultation). It involves assessment of signs {{that may be}} visible on a person's hands (such as splinter haemorrhages), joints and other areas. A person's pulse is taken, usually at the radial artery near the wrist, {{in order to assess}} for the rhythm and strength of the pulse. The blood pressure is taken, using either a manual or automatic sphygmomanometer or using a more invasive measurement from within the artery. Any elevation of the jugular venous pulse is noted. A person's chest is felt for any transmitted vibrations from the heart, and then listened to with a stethoscope. A normal heart has two hearts sounds – additional heart sounds or heart murmurs may also <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> heard and may point to disease. Additional tests may be conducted to assess a person's heart murmurs if they are present, and peripheral signs of heart disease such as swollen feet or fluid in the lungs may be assessed.|$|E
