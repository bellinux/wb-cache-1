5|$|The {{first case}} of HIV/AIDS in Malawi was {{reported}} at Lilongwe's Kamuzu Central Hospital in 1985. President Hastings Banda, {{who was in}} power at the time, responded with several small-scale prevention initiatives and created the National AIDS Control Programme, {{a division of the}} Ministry of Health, to manage the growing epidemic. Banda believed that issues relating to sex, including HIV transmission, should not <b>be</b> <b>addressed</b> <b>in</b> the public sphere; during this time, it was illegal for Malawian citizens to discuss the epidemic openly. In 1989, Banda introduced a five-year World Bank Medium Term Plan to combat the epidemic, but HIV prevalence had already increased drastically at this point.|$|E
5|$|Most {{teachers}} {{are required to}} address HIV/AIDS in their curricula; although instructors are, for the most part, committed to helping their students understand and avoid the disease, they face many obstacles that prevent them from informing their students about HIV/AIDS in productive ways. For example, some teachers cannot advise their students to remain faithful to their sexual partners without seeming hypocritical because they engage in extramarital sexual relations themselves. Others feel uncomfortable discussing sexual matters with their students, and some believe that, due to their limited training, they are not knowledgeable enough about HIV/AIDS to direct classroom discussions about the disease. In addition, many teachers feel unsupported by community members, who often either deny {{the extent of the}} epidemic or believe that HIV/AIDS should not <b>be</b> <b>addressed</b> <b>in</b> the classroom.|$|E
5|$|The first {{philosophical}} cosmologists reacted against, {{or sometimes}} built upon, popular mythical conceptions that had {{existed in the}} Greek world for some time. Some of these popular conceptions can be gleaned from the poetry of Homer and Hesiod. In Homer, the Earth {{was viewed as a}} flat disk afloat on the river of Oceanus and overlooked by a hemispherical sky with sun, moon, and stars. The Sun (Helios) traversed the heavens as a charioteer and sailed around the Earth in a golden bowl at night. Sun, earth, heaven, rivers, and winds could <b>be</b> <b>addressed</b> <b>in</b> prayers and called to witness oaths. Natural fissures were popularly regarded as entrances to the subterranean house of Hades and his predecessors, home of the dead.* K. Algra, The Beginnings of Cosmology, 45 Influences from other cultures always afforded new themes.|$|E

5|$|Whilst airport {{development}} in the UK is subject to local planning authority processes, the government regards airports as {{an important part of}} the national infrastructure and which therefore requires their development to be planned with a strategic approach. To support this, the government began a three-year public consultation process with the publication in December 2000 of The Future of Aviation consultation document. This outlined the issues underpinning air transport and sought views on how they should <b>be</b> <b>addressed</b> <b>in</b> any future policy. One of the main questions asked was whether policy should focus on meeting demand or whether it should focus instead on limiting the negative effects of air transport. Another key issue for which views were sought was how the industry might best meet the environmental costs it incurs. Between July 2002 and February 2003 a further seven regional consultation documents were published. These focussed on the economic, environmental, social and airspace appraisals relating to options for future airport development specific to the regions, and together they generated half a million responses. During the Spring of 2003 workshops based on a consultation document titled Aviation and the Environment - Using Economic Instruments were held to seek stakeholder views on the desirability and effectiveness of various financial measures that might address the environmental impacts of aviation. The consultation process ended in December 2003 with the publication of The Future of Air Transport White Paper which detailed the government's conclusions.|$|E

25|$|A third complex {{consists}} of species with rather large, openly coiled to nearly planispiral shells with pronounced prickly sculpture and widely expanded outer lips; the shells are often strongly patterned. The group contains Abbottella haitensis, and Abbottella moreletianus. Bartsch (1946) broke Abbottella moreletianus into five subspecies. Zoogeographically, this group presents a problem: {{the two species}} occur {{at opposite ends of}} the island (Thomazeau, Haiti and the Samaná Peninsula and environs). This group will <b>be</b> <b>addressed</b> <b>in</b> a future study.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{advantages}} of Coase's model is that it suggests that fairness (equity) can <b>be</b> <b>addressed</b> <b>in</b> the distribution of property rights, and that regardless of how these property rights are assigned, the market will produce the most efficient outcome (Goldemberg et al.., 1996, p.29). In reality, according to the held view, markets are not perfect, and it is therefore possible that a trade off will occur between equity and efficiency (Halsnæs et al.., 2007).|$|E

25|$|The {{main problem}} with {{producing}} such a modem was forwarding commands from the computer. This could <b>be</b> <b>addressed</b> <b>in</b> internal modems that plugged {{directly into the}} computer's motherboard. Such modems {{had access to the}} computer's main memory, and by dedicating certain memory locations (or registers) to various status readouts or commands, software programs running on the computer could control the modem. This was a straightforward and thus a popular solution; the Novation APPLE-CAT II for the Apple II computer was an early programmable modem of this type.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} LGBT-inclusive {{curriculum}} is {{introduced by the}} National Sexuality Education Standards set forth by the Future of Sex Education Initiative.

The identity topic presents lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender identities as possibilities for students as they progress through life and come to understand who they are. These standards, the Future of Sex Education argues, will start in kindergarten and will evolve into more complex topics throughout schooling as the students mature and age.|$|E

The Clipped Tag has been suggested by IBM researchers Paul Moskowitz and Guenter Karjoth. After the point of sale, a consumer may tear off {{a portion of the}} tag. This allows the transformation of a long-range tag into a proximity tag that still may be read, but only at short range– less than a few inches or centimeters. The modification of the tag may be confirmed visually. The tag may still be used later for returns, recalls, or recycling.|$|E
25|$|Both {{cases were}} marred by {{irregularities}} and were condemned as a joint attempt by Erdoğan and Gülen to curb {{opposition to the}} AKP.

Despite both domestic and international calls for these irregularities to <b>be</b> <b>addressed</b> <b>in</b> order to guarantee a fair trial, Erdoğan instead praised his government for bringing the coup plots to light. When Gülen publicly withdrew support and openly attacked Erdoğan in late 2013, several imprisoned military officers and journalists were released, with the government admitting that the judicial proceedings were unfair.|$|E
25|$|IBD - Intestinal Bowel Disease causes {{frequent}} {{vomiting and}} weight loss in cats. Similar to Crohn's disease in humans, a cat's intestinal antibodies view food as the enemy and attack nutritional absorption {{as well as the}} cat's own organs and intestinal fluids. A daily immunosuppressant (such as Prednisolone)is required, as well as changes to the diet that include canned foods with single-source proteins and limited ingredients. Most felines with IBD also have several food allergies, including red meat proteins, fish oils, and gluten, which must <b>be</b> <b>addressed</b> <b>in</b> tandem with the disease. Regular vomiting in a cat is not okay; discuss the possibility of IBD with your vet. Undiagnosed or poorly-treated IBD can lead to death through malnutrition even in a cat who is eating regularly.|$|E
