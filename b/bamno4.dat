25|$|Manganates, {{particularly}} the insoluble barium manganate, <b>BaMnO4,</b> {{have been used}} as oxidizing agents in organic synthesis: they will oxidize primary alcohols to aldehydes and then to carboxylic acids, and secondary alcohols to ketones. Barium manganate has also been used to oxidize hydrazones to diazo compounds.|$|E
50|$|The {{conversion}} is signaled by {{the color}} change from purple, characteristic of permanganate, to the green color of manganate. This reaction also shows that manganate(VII) can serve as an electron acceptor {{in addition to its}} usual role as an oxygen-transfer reagent. Barium manganate, <b>BaMnO4,</b> is generated by the reduction of KMnO4 with iodide in the presence of barium chloride. Just like BaSO4, <b>BaMnO4</b> exhibits low solubility in virtually all solvents.|$|E

5000|$|Barium {{manganate}} is an {{inorganic compound}} with the formula <b>BaMnO4.</b> It {{is used as}} an oxidant in organic chemistry. It belongs to a class of compounds known as manganates in which the manganese resides in a +6 oxidation state. Manganate should {{not to be confused}} with permanganate in which contains manganese(VII). Barium manganate is a powerful oxidant, popular in organic synthesis and can be used in a wide variety of oxidation reactions.|$|E
5000|$|The manganate(VI) ion is a d1 ion and is {{tetrahedral}} with bond {{angles of}} approximately 109.5°. The Mn-O bond lengths in <b>BaMnO4</b> and K2MnO4 are identical at 1.66 Å. In comparison, the Mn-O bond length in MnO4 2- {{is longer than}} in MnO4− of 1.56 Å and shorter than the Mn-O bond found in MnO2, 1.89 Å. Barium manganate is isomorphous with BaCrO4 and BaSO4. Barium manganate can appear as a dark blue or green to black crystals. [...] Barium manganate is indefinitely stable, active and can be stored for months in dry conditions.|$|E
