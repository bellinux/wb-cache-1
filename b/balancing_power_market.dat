40|$|As far {{as energy}} policy is concerned, {{the design of}} the {{regulatory}} framework for energy transmission and distribution is a key issue. Consequently, also the embodiment of <b>balancing</b> <b>power</b> <b>markets</b> drives mainly the effectiveness of political implications for the energy sector. Initially, tertiary control in Germany was solely offered by transmission system operators of the respective power control areas and their associated power plant. The recast of the Energy Industry Act of 2005 led in last consequence to a common procurement auction for the supply of tertiary control, which starts on December 1, 2006. Admittedly, the reform has fallen short of expectations so far, first concerning the intensification of market entry of tertiary control providers as well as the desired decline of the price level. Hence, this article examines the effects of the changeover on observable demand charges. In order to identify attributes of the common procurement auction for tertiary control hampering market entry of providers, giving stimuli to collusion and strategic behavior, reducing intensity of competition and encouraging an upswing of prices, we analyze the design under an auction theoretical approach and deduce empirically whether structural components of the auction design have to be touched up again. ...|$|R
40|$|Intermittent {{generation}} behaviour of {{wind and}} solar power units requires Transmission System Operators (TSOs) to activate balancing power to maintain a stable grid frequency. With the current strong growth in installed renewable energy capacity in The Netherlands, it is therefore expected that the volumes of activated balancing power will grow accordingly. In the Dutch <b>balancing</b> <b>power</b> <b>market</b> system, the activation of balancing power is remunerated against the highest activated balancing power bid in the respective time-block. Without a proportional increase in affordable balancing power bids, the economic costs of grid balancing in The Netherlands are expected to increase as a result. Imbalance power prices for positive balancing power, the counterbalancing of net shortages of power supply, may see a particularly strong rise, as the opportunity to quickly increase grid frequency places influential restrictions on the operation status of suitable power assets. The financial opportunities inherent to this trend have gained the attention of non-traditional suppliers of technical positive balancing power potential, amongst which the energy-intensive industry and greenhouse farmers. However, limited insight into the exact value potential of market participation, and contradictory developments in the German market are currently preventing these parties to invest in unlocking their technical balancing power potential. A limited supply of new balancing power bids will further increase the economic costs of grid balancing. This study therefore sets out to identify a method to quantitatively determine the profitability potential of providing positive balancing power to the Dutch <b>balancing</b> <b>power</b> <b>market</b> to an individual market participant. A case study is conducted at AkzoNobel, whose sizeable chlorine plant possesses significant balancing power potential. It is found that a Unit Commitment Model based on a Mixed Integer Linear Programming solver {{can be used to}} successfully replicate the market environment. To simulate market profitability to AkzoNobel over time, it should be supplied with input data of the future development of balancing power activation, the merit order of balancing power bids, and balancing power capabilities of the AkzoNobel plant. Whilst the balancing power capabilities of the plant can be relatively simply and accurately modelled into a Unit Commitment Model, the same does not hold for the future activation of balancing power and respective prices in the merit order of balancing power bids. On the one hand, the future development of the various factors that comprise these sub-systems is characterized by significant uncertainty, as power system dynamics are notoriously hard to predict. On the other, both are the emergent behaviour from complex systems of interacting power system agents and assets. Their actions result from a large number of factors that may vary strongly on a short time scale. This causes difficulties in obtaining accurate projections of their behaviour on the required minute-by-minute time scale. The activation of a high balancing power bid price in general also implies a strong grid frequency deviation. This implies that the profitability of providing balancing power is particularly sensitive to deviations in high imbalance power prices. As imbalance power prices are primarily determined by the specific height, volatility and frequency of high balancing power activation peaks relative to the height of prices in the merit order for those respective fifteen-minute time blocks, the choice of a method to obtain the input data of balancing power activation and the merit order must be based on a clear substantiation of their accuracy. Various approaches to obtain data projections with the required accuracy have been assessed, for which the following conclusions are drawn. To determine the development of the future activation of balancing power bids it is advised to evaluate a combined method of statistical convolution of probability distributions and hidden Markov chains. However, this method must be preceded by significant additional research on critical complexities and uncertain developments in the <b>balancing</b> <b>power</b> <b>market,</b> for which it may not be possible to draw definite conclusions. To obtain scenarios of the various potential developments in the volume and price elements of balancing power bids in the merit order it is suggested to use a stochastic modelling approach, such as Monte Carlo simulation, to evaluate the range of different compositions the merit order may take over time. It will, however, be difficult to strategize on the results, as the potential range of states of bid prices and volumes placed by individual agents with balancing power technologies are very wide. These methods must be synthesized into an approach to determine <b>balancing</b> <b>power</b> <b>market</b> profitability based on the above combination of methods. Projections of the development of the key determinants of profitability in the <b>balancing</b> <b>power</b> <b>market</b> will inherently be associated with strong uncertainty. Considering the sensitivity of model output to inaccuracies it is very questionable whether the effort of further research weighs up against the benefits. It is concluded that it is not deemed feasible to obtain quantitative long-term indications of <b>balancing</b> <b>power</b> <b>market</b> profitability to an individual market participant. As a result, it is not advised to proceed with the execution of the suggested methods. It appears that alternative approaches to ensure the future affordability of balancing the power grid are more worthwhile pursuing. It is instead advised to focus continued research on public incentive schemes to attract non-conventional suppliers of positive balancing power to provide their technical potential to the market if the market fails to find an economic optimum. Continued research could also focus on enhanced regulatory designs to reduce total balancing power requirements. Systems Engineering, Policy Analysis and Managemen...|$|E

40|$|Demand-side {{flexibility}} (DSF) in {{the electricity}} grid {{has become an}} active research area in recent years. While temporal flexibility (e. g. load shedding, load shifting) is already discussed intensively in literature, spatial load migration still is an under-researched type of DSF. Spatial load migration allows us to instantly migrate power-consuming activities among different locations. Data centers (DCs) are power-intensive and process information goods. Since information goods are easily transferable through communication networks, power-intensive processing of information goods is not necessarily tied to a specific location. Consequently, geographically distributed DCs inherit - in theory - a considerable potential to globally migrate load. We analyze the economics of spatially migrating load to provide <b>balancing</b> <b>power</b> using geographically distributed DCs. We assure that neither of the participating electricity grids will be burdened by this mechanism. By using historical data to evaluate our model, we find reasonable economic incentives to migrate positive as well as negative <b>balancing</b> <b>power.</b> In addition, we find that current scenarios favor the migration of negative <b>balancing</b> <b>power.</b> Our research thus reveals realistic opportunities to virtually transfer <b>balancing</b> <b>power</b> between different <b>market</b> areas worldwide...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Over {{the last}} decennia, wind power has gotten {{increasingly}} {{important as a}} source of electricity. In many countries with high wind penetration rates, wind assets deliver ancillary services like <b>balancing</b> <b>power</b> to the grid operator. In The Netherlands this is not yet the case. This thesis looks into the potential of a certain Dutch wind farm in delivering balancing power; its aim is to find the annual value of delivering <b>balancing</b> <b>power</b> based on 2012 market figures. Five sub-questions are defined that together form the building blocks for the answer to the main research question. A conventional business-as-usual scenario, in which <b>balancing</b> <b>power</b> is dispatched on non-renewable assets, is compared to a ‘Wind’ scenario in which the wind farm takes on the reservation for <b>balancing</b> <b>power</b> as much as possible. The research is divided into a market based ‘Power Markets’ part and a merely technical ‘Wind Assets’ part. The market based part models the conventional dispatch with respect to <b>balancing</b> <b>power</b> and the <b>market</b> for <b>balancing</b> <b>power.</b> Then, the wind farm is investigated for expected output, load factor and availability for <b>balancing</b> <b>power.</b> Finally, results are integrated to provide an answer to the research question. The findings of this study show a positive figure for the value of <b>balancing</b> <b>power</b> by the wind farm. Biggest value drivers are the change in reservation costs for <b>balancing</b> <b>power</b> (positive) and the change in <b>balancing</b> <b>power</b> earnings (negative) on conventional assets. A sensitivity analysis shows that the development of the ‘spread’ or difference between the APX power price and the fuel price of the conventional asset dispatched, has the biggest effect on the business case. The biggest uncertainty for further use and implementation of the research {{lies in the fact that}} it is based on 2012 inputs, that are potentially variable. A 15...|$|R

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{share of}} renewable energy sources is {{likely to lead to}} price effects in Nordic electricity market, resulting especially in increased volatility of spot and imbalance prices. The greater price volatility and amount of required balancing power increase the need for Demand-Side Management (DSM) in the electricity market and may as well increase the financial benefits of DSM participants. In this research I study the DSM in electricity mar-ket and evaluate how large the financial benefits of DSM participants could be. Monte Carlo simulation method is used to simulate imbalance prices with different volatilities for Finland and Sweden. The results show that increasing volatility may in some cases lead to substantial cost savings and additional revenues for the DSM participants. The revenues are higher in Finland compared to Sweden due to higher volatility of prices in the Finnish <b>balancing</b> <b>power</b> <b>market.</b> Lower threshold price (i. e. the lower opportunity cost of shifting or adjusting electricity demand) and higher flexible load capacity will in-crease the revenue obtainable from the DSM participation. However, there is a feedback effect, since the more DSM programs there are in the market, the less volatile the prices are likely to be. The magnitude of this effect, {{as well as that of}} the rebound effect (i. e. increased demand due to lower prices), is hard to quantify. If these feedback effects are large, cost savings and additional revenues for the DSM participants may be considerably smaller than what is documented in this study.

40|$|Liberalization of {{electricity}} markets {{has resulted in}} a competed Nordic electricity market, in which electricity retailers play a key role as electricity suppliers, market intermediaries, and service providers. Although these roles may remain unchanged in the near future, the retailers’ operation may change fundamentally {{as a result of the}} emerging smart grid environment. Especially the increasing amount of distributed energy resources (DER), and improving opportunities for their control, are reshaping the operating environment of the retailers. This requires that the retailers’ operation models are developed to match the operating environment, in which the active use of DER plays a major role. Electricity retailers have a clientele, and they operate actively in the electricity markets, which makes them a natural market party to offer new services for end-users aiming at an efficient and market-based use of DER. From the retailer’s point of view, the active use of DER can provide means to adapt the operation to meet the challenges posed by the smart grid environment, and to pursue the ultimate objective of the retailer, which is to maximize the profit of operation. This doctoral dissertation introduces a methodology for the comprehensive use of DER in an electricity retailer’s short-term profit optimization that covers operation in a variety of marketplaces including day-ahead, intra-day, and reserve markets. The analysis results provide data of the key profit-making opportunities and the risks associated with different types of DER use. Therefore, the methodology may serve as an efficient tool for an experienced operator in the planning of the optimal market-based DER use. The key contributions of this doctoral dissertation lie in the analysis and development of the model that allows the retailer to benefit from profit-making opportunities brought by the use of DER in different marketplaces, but also to manage the major risks involved in the active use of DER. In addition, the dissertation introduces an analysis of the economic potential of DER control actions in different marketplaces including the day-ahead Elspot market, <b>balancing</b> <b>power</b> <b>market,</b> and the hourly market of Frequency Containment Reserve for Disturbances (FCR-D) ...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{sheds light}} onto the {{integration}} of renewable energy generation into electricity markets based on five articles. The first article {{is concerned with the}} optimal strategies of renewable producers selling electricity in sequential markets. A model is developed in which renewable generators trade their production in two sequential markets, which can be regarded as the day-ahead and intraday markets. Trading in the first market takes place under uncertainty about the final production level of renewable generation. The results show that it might be optimal for renewable producers to sell less than the expected quantity in the day-ahead market. The second article focuses on the high variability in production from renewable electricity and its effect on prices. A model for the allocation of hourly and quarter-hourly electricity generation is developed, assuming that the participation in the market for quarter-hourly products is restricted. Restricted participation in the market for quarter-hourly products may have caused welfare losses of about EUR 96 million in 2015. In the third article, the hourly price elasticity of demand for electricity in the German day-ahead market is empirically estimated. The results indicate a high level of variation of price elasticity of demand throughout the day ranging from - 0. 02 to - 0. 13 depending on the time of the day in the German day-ahead market in 2015. The fourth article is concerned with the tariff design in retail markets for electricity. It focuses on the inefficiency from time-invariant pricing in combination with an increasing share of renewable energies. The last article finally takes {{a closer look at the}} <b>balancing</b> <b>power</b> <b>market</b> and the impact of different market designs on efficiency and competition.

40|$|The high {{penetration}} {{of renewable energy}} in electricity grids brings the role of balancing production and demand for Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) plants. Due to their thermal storage capability, CSP plants provide certain flexibility between collecting thermal energy {{from the sun and}} transforming it into electric energy by means of a power cycle. The dispatchability of CSP plants is based on the electricity demand and weather forecasts, to accurately schedule the electricity production over the following days. Such scheduling enables the participation of CSP plants in the <b>balancing</b> <b>power</b> <b>market,</b> ensuring the importance of such plants in the pathway to a highly renewable energy mix. Since weather forecasts include uncertainties, the dispatch schedule of CSP plants needs to take it into account. Modification of energy deliveries once scheduled is very limited and usually associated with drawbacks in form of penalties or reduced prices. Therefore, the uncertainty treatment in the energy delivery schedule is essential to ensure the optimization of solar thermal energy dispatch, with high dependency on type and accuracy of weather forecasts. Research on the precision of direct normal irradiance (DNI) forecast of different forecast methods was already performed, as shown by Law et al. (2014). Although, the impact of this accuracy on power scheduling and economic income of CSP plants is still a field to be studied. A dispatch optimization algorithm was developed at DLR, used to derive a CSP plant operation schedule for the upcoming 48 hours. It considers weather and electricity pricing forecasts with a special focus in the incorporation of uncertainty information. The strategy of the Dispatch Optimizer is based on a partitioned calculation between the optimization algorithm and the uncertainty processing. The optimization algorithm runs directly with all the possible weather scenarios, if the forecast is given as ensemble members, or deterministically with deviations, while the uncertainty is dealt as a post-processing. Therefore, the result of the optimization is a range of possible power schedules and the uncertainty post-processing is able to categorize single schedules suggestions according to the risk of meeting the promised energy delivery. This partitioned approach brings the possibility of including other parameters in the uncertainty treatment. The power schedule optimization considers not only the accuracy of the weather data but also electricity market characteristics. Therefore, several delivery strategies can be developed according to the decision maker’s point of view. This research shows as benefit the possibility of dealing with several types of weather forecast, such as probabilistic and deterministic methods, as well as enabling the evaluation of the quality of weather forecast data and its efficiency for optimizing the dispatch. Apart from that, it is possible to study the use of weather forecasts post-processing to improve accuracy of CSP plant operation schedule. Recent investigations on the economic benefit according to the type and accuracy of weather will be presented. It is expected that further results relating weather forecast accuracy and financial income expected from the CSP plant can be of great value for a better understanding on how to treat uncertainties for energy generation...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIncreasing {{shares of}} {{variable}} renewable energy (VRE) causes challenges related to <b>power</b> system <b>balancing.</b> The regulating <b>power</b> <b>market</b> {{is part of the}} Nordic electricity market and has as purpose to maintain the balance between total generation and consumption of power in real time. Currently, the <b>power</b> <b>balance</b> settlement is being carried on a national level, by the separate transmission operator in each Nordic country. Recent developments, {{in the form of a}} common project initiated by the system operators in Norway, Sweden and Finland, attempt to change the routinized course of the balance settlement by introducing a model for common Nordic balance and reconciliation settlement (NBS). The regulatory change will make the rules for balance settlement equal to all Nordic participants, ease market participation and possibly increase the number of smaller <b>market</b> actors. For <b>power</b> <b>market</b> participants it is of interest to analyze how the regulatory change will affect balancing market prices. This paper analyzes how the regulating price in different price areas in the Nord Pool region is affected by the level of the spot price and the volumes of regulating bids using historical market data. According to the estimated econometric models, the down-regulation price is more sensitive to the regulating volumes than the up-regulation price. At maximum the up-regulation price decreases by 0. 14 % as a result of a 1 % increase in the bids’ volume, while for the down-regulation price a greater than 0. 2 % increase is observed. Also, the results show relatively large differences in the sensitivity of spot prices and bid volumes across different areas and seasons...|$|R
40|$|I {{study the}} {{economic}} consequences of shifting bargaining power in relational contracts through interventions {{such as the}} formation of a Bargaining Group (BG) for the side of sellers in a market where buyers traditionally hold significant <b>market</b> <b>power.</b> Existing theories of relational contracts predict that such a power transfer will have no impact on market efficiency. In contexts where enforcement institutions are weak, a standard assumption from existing theories of relational contracts - the existence of an enforceable base payment - may not hold. In this case, I show that a transfer of bargaining <b>power</b> can erode <b>market</b> efficiency in a dynamic relational contracting environment, which contradicts findings from existing models of relational contracting. When buyers hold significant <b>market</b> <b>power,</b> they forgo short-term opportunistic behavior by honoring promised performance bonuses in order to keep sellers engaged in trade over time and to accumulate surplus over many periods. With <b>market</b> <b>power</b> eroded by interventions such as the BG, buyers’ long-run gains to trade shirk.

30|$|Reference [48] {{argues that}} {{existing}} bulk <b>power</b> <b>markets</b> are also examples of transactive energy systems, because prices and economic signals {{are used in}} these markets to drive economic efficiency and balance supply and demand. Wholesale <b>power</b> <b>markets</b> in California, Texas, and New York maintain the real-time <b>balance</b> in <b>power</b> supply and demand through largely centralized operations, such as security constrained economic dispatch (SCED) [49, 50, 51]. From the authors’ perspective, however, wholesale market mechanisms such as SCED may not be directly copied to distribution systems where the number of players can get extremely large. Transactions and control functionalities need to be decentralized and automated in a transactive energy ecosystem.|$|R

The {{aim of the}} paper {{is to examine the}} general technical feasibility of cogeneration plants as <b>balancing</b> <b>power</b> supply. Due to the lack of heat demand in summer, cogeneration plants are only promising for providing positive <b>balancing</b> <b>power.</b> Furthermore, {{there is a lack of}} seasonal similarities in <b>balancing</b> <b>power</b> demand. That’s why seasonal variation of switch-on priorities for conventional and cogeneration plants seems to be most promising. Today, only combustion engines and micro-turbines are suitable as <b>balancing</b> <b>power</b> supply because of short cold-start times...|$|R

In deregulated power systems, the electricity is traded in electricity markets by the balance responsible companies that can produce, consume or retail. Examples of electricity markets are the day-ahead (DA), intraday and regulating <b>power</b> <b>markets</b> [1]. The <b>balance</b> responsible trades in DA <b>market</b> and <b>balance</b> the <b>power</b> system for each operating period in the next day. If the power system comes out of balance on an operating day, owing to the update of wind power forecasts or the unavailability of <b>power</b> plants, the <b>balance</b> responsible trades again in intraday market for every operating period to one hour {{in advance of the}} actual operation hour. The intraday <b>market</b> <b>balances</b> the <b>power</b> system. However wind power forecast errors and other non-contingent events might create power imbalance within the actual operating hour. These imbalances are then minimized by activating the power bids, within minutes, from regulating <b>power</b> <b>market.</b> The TSOs select the dispatch bids with the foremost intent of preserving system integrity with minimum production cost.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn this paper, a {{new method}} is {{proposed}} for Locational Marginal Pricing (LMP) forecasting in Smart Grid. The marginal cost {{is required to}} supply electricity to incremental loads in case where a certain node increases power demands in a <b>balanced</b> <b>power</b> system. LMP {{plays an important role}} to maintain economic efficiency in <b>power</b> <b>markets</b> in a way that electricity flows from a low-cost area to high-cost one and the transmission network congestion is alleviated. The <b>power</b> <b>market</b> players are interested in maximizing the profits and minimizing the risks through selling and buying electricity. As a result, it is of importance to obtain accurate information on electricity pricing forecasting in advance so that their desire is reflected. This paper presents the Gaussian Process (GP) technique that comes from the extension of Support Vector Machine (SVM) in a way that hierarchical Bayesian estimation is introduced to express the model parameter as the stochastic variables. The advantage is that the model accuracy of GP is better than others. The proposed method is successfully applied to real data of ISONE(Independent System Operator New England) in USA...|$|R

These local generation units in distribution system can be organized as a virtual power plant (VPP) to make combined contribution to the <b>power</b> <b>balance</b> of the <b>power</b> system and can participate in the <b>power</b> <b>market.</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} results from an {{agent-based}} simulation model that comprises three interrelated {{markets in the}} electricity sector: a day-ahead electricity market, a <b>market</b> for <b>balancing</b> <b>power,</b> and a carbon exchange for CO 2 emission allowances. Agents seek to optimize trading strategies over the two electricity markets through reinforcement learning; they also integrate market results from emissions trading into their reasoning. Simulation outcomes show that the model is able to closely reproduce observed prices at the German <b>power</b> <b>markets</b> for the analysis period of 2006. The model is thus applicable for analyzing different market designs in order to derive evidence for policy advice; one example for such an analysis is given in this contribution...|$|R

The behaviour and motivation of the {{key players in the}} journal publishing value chain is thoroughly analyzed; for-profit publishers' responses to the threat from OA movement are investigated; and the functionalities and content coverage of Google Scholar are weighted against Scopus and PolySearch Engine. The study found that OA publishers fail to capitalize on their early adoption of IT and Internet to forge ahead by offering high quality and distinctive value added services. The arrival of Google Scholar (GS) enables the movement to offer the much needed integrated access to their journal articles and together they do bring enough credence to <b>balance</b> the <b>market</b> <b>power</b> against the for-profit publishers, however, in their current form and functionalities, they still lack the vigor to transform journal publishing...|$|R
