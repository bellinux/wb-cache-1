5|$|Interstitial {{radium therapy}} was {{common in the}} 1930s. Gold seeds filled with radon were used as early as 1942 until at least 1958. Gold shells were {{selected}} by Gino Failla around 1920 to shield <b>beta</b> <b>rays</b> while passing gamma rays. Cobalt needles were also used briefly after world war II. Radon and cobalt were replaced by radioactive tantalum and gold, before iridium rose in prominence.

5|$|Other more rare {{types of}} {{radioactive}} decay include ejection of neutrons or protons or clusters of nucleons from a nucleus, {{or more than}} one beta particle. An analog of gamma emission which allows excited nuclei to lose energy in a different way, is internal conversion— a process that produces high-speed electrons that are not <b>beta</b> <b>rays,</b> followed by production of high-energy photons that are not gamma rays. A few large nuclei explode into two or more charged fragments of varying masses plus several neutrons, in a decay called spontaneous nuclear fission.|$|E
5|$|While {{studying}} naturally fluorescing minerals in 1896, the French physicist Henri Becquerel {{discovered that}} they emitted radiation without any exposure to an external energy source. These radioactive materials {{became the subject of}} much interest by scientists, including the New Zealand physicist Ernest Rutherford who discovered they emitted particles. He designated these particles alpha and beta, {{on the basis of their}} ability to penetrate matter. In 1900, Becquerel showed that the <b>beta</b> <b>rays</b> emitted by radium could be deflected by an electric field, and that their mass-to-charge ratio was the same as for cathode rays. This evidence strengthened the view that electrons existed as components of atoms.|$|E

When the Korbinite's homeworld {{was destroyed by}} Surtur's Fire Demons, <b>Beta</b> <b>Ray</b> Bill was specially modified to oversee the Korbinite's survival on the Skuttlebutt with the race under cryogenic hibernation. When Surtur's Fire Demons attack the Skuttlebutt, <b>Beta</b> <b>Ray</b> Bill has the Skuttlebutt take refuge in an asteroid field. His presence was detected by Heimdall as Thor sets out to investigate. When Thor makes {{his way into the}} Skuttlebutt, he is ambushed by <b>Beta</b> <b>Ray</b> Bill (who mistakens Thor for a Fire Demon) and manages to pin him down. <b>Beta</b> <b>Ray</b> Bill successfully lifts Mjolnir and attacks Thor with it. <b>Beta</b> <b>Ray</b> Bill is then teleported to Asgard by Odin (who was trying to teleport Thor back) where <b>Beta</b> <b>Ray</b> Bill mistakens the Asgardians as Fire Demons and attacks Balder, Sif, and the Warriors Three before being subdued by Odin and finally realizes his error due to Odin's genuine concern and love for his son. Thor is teleported back to Asgard by Odin. When <b>Beta</b> <b>Ray</b> Bill reveals his people's plight and demands to wield Mjolnir to fight the Fire Demons, Sif offers to assist him in the battle and Thor offers Mjolnir. Odin denies the offer made by Thor and says he has an idea. After Thor convinces Eitri to help, <b>Beta</b> <b>Ray</b> Bill receives Stormbreaker (which was made from the remaining Uru following Surtur's raid) and uses it to help Thor and Sif fight the Fire Demons in order to keep them from harming the Korbinites. While Sif and the Skuttlebutt's defenses fight the Fire Demons, Thor and <b>Beta</b> <b>Ray</b> Bill fight Enchantress who has been converted into Surtur's mind-controlled pawn. After Thor and <b>Beta</b> <b>Ray</b> Bill defeat Enchantress which causes the Fire Demons to disappear, Surtur speaks through her telling Thor and <b>Beta</b> <b>Ray</b> Bill that Enchantress is now under his control. <b>Beta</b> <b>Ray</b> Bill then leaves with Skuttlebutt in order to find a safe place for the Korbinites to settle down and repopulate, but he promises to aid Thor in his battle with Surtur, the Fire Demon Lord of Muspelheim.|$|R

25|$|Gamma rays {{were first}} {{thought to be}} {{particles}} with mass, like alpha and <b>beta</b> <b>rays.</b> Rutherford initially believed {{that they might be}} extremely fast beta particles, but their failure to be deflected by a magnetic field indicated that they had no charge. In 1914, gamma rays were observed to be reflected from crystal surfaces, proving that they were electromagnetic radiation. Rutherford and his coworker Edward Andrade measured the wavelengths of gamma rays from radium, and found that they were similar to X-rays, but with shorter wavelengths and (thus) higher frequency. This was eventually recognized as giving them also more energy per photon, as soon as the latter term became generally accepted. A gamma decay was then understood to usually emit a single gamma photon.|$|E

500|$|A {{team led}} by Enrico Fermi in 1934 {{observed}} that bombarding uranium with neutrons produces the emission of <b>beta</b> <b>rays</b> (electrons or positrons from the elements produced; see beta particle). The fission products were at first mistaken for new elements with atomic numbers 93 and 94, which the Dean of the Faculty of Rome, Orso Mario Corbino, christened ausonium and hesperium, respectively. The experiments leading {{to the discovery of}} uranium's ability to fission (break apart) into lighter elements and release binding energy were conducted by Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann in Hahn's laboratory in Berlin. Lise Meitner and her nephew, the physicist Otto Robert Frisch, published the physical explanation in February 1939 and named the process [...] "nuclear fission". Soon after, Fermi hypothesized that the fission of uranium might release enough neutrons to sustain a fission reaction. Confirmation of this hypothesis came in 1939, and later work found that on average about 2.5 neutrons are released by each fission of the rare uranium isotope uranium-235. Fermi urged Alfred O.C. Nier to separate uranium isotopes for determination of the fissile component, and on February 29, 1940, Nier used an instrument he built at the University of Minnesota to separate the world's first uranium-235 sample in the Tate Laboratory. After mailed to Columbia University's cyclotron, John Dunning confirmed the sample to be the isolated fissile material on March 1. Further work found that the far more common uranium-238 isotope can be transmuted into plutonium, which, like uranium-235, is also fissile by thermal neutrons. These discoveries led numerous countries to begin working on the development of nuclear weapons and nuclear power.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{gamma ray}} source to be {{discovered}} historically was the radioactive decay process called gamma decay. In this type of decay, an excited nucleus emits a gamma ray almost immediately upon formation (it is now understood that a nuclear isomeric transition, however, can produce inhibited gamma decay with a measurable and much longer half-life). Paul Villard, a French chemist and physicist, discovered gamma radiation in 1900, while studying radiation emitted from radium. Villard knew that his described radiation was more powerful than previously described types of rays from radium, which included <b>beta</b> <b>rays,</b> first noted as [...] "radioactivity" [...] by Henri Becquerel in 1896, and alpha rays, discovered as a less penetrating form of radiation by Rutherford, in 1899. However, Villard did not consider naming them as a different fundamental type. Villard's radiation was recognized as being of a type fundamentally different from previously named rays, by Ernest Rutherford, who in 1903 named Villard's rays [...] "gamma rays" [...] by analogy with the beta and alpha rays that Rutherford had differentiated in 1899. The [...] "rays" [...] emitted by radioactive elements were named in order of their power to penetrate various materials, using the first three letters of the Greek alphabet: alpha rays as the least penetrating, followed by <b>beta</b> <b>rays,</b> followed by gamma rays as the most penetrating. Rutherford also noted that gamma rays were not deflected (or at least, not easily deflected) by a magnetic field, another property making them unlike alpha and <b>beta</b> <b>rays.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Ernest Rutherford was {{a physics}} {{professor}} at the University of Manchester. [...] He had already received numerous honors for his studies of radiation. [...] He had discovered the existence of alpha rays, <b>beta</b> <b>rays,</b> and gamma rays, and had proved that these were the consequence of the disintegration of atoms. In 1906, he received a visit from a German physicist named Hans Geiger, and was so impressed that he asked Geiger to stay and help him with his research. [...] Ernest Marsden was a physics undergraduate student studying under Geiger.|$|E

2500|$|Gamma rays (also called gamma radiation), {{denoted by}} the lower-case Greek letter gamma (γ or [...] ), are {{penetrating}} electromagnetic radiation {{of a kind}} arising from the radioactive decay of atomic nuclei. It consists of photons in the highest observed range of photon energy. Paul Villard, a French chemist and physicist, discovered gamma radiation in 1900 while studying radiation emitted by radium. In 1903, Ernest Rutherford named this radiation gamma rays. Rutherford had previously discovered two other types of radioactive decay, which he named alpha rays and <b>beta</b> <b>rays.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Early in the 20th century, {{radioactivity}} {{had been}} recently discovered in uranium and thorium. [...] Ernest Rutherford had separated radioactivity into three types: [...] alpha, beta, and gamma rays, {{depending on their}} ability to penetrate, or travel into, ordinary objects or gases. [...] These radiations were soon identified with known particles: [...] alpha rays were shown to be helium ions by Rutherford and Thomas Royds in 1907, <b>beta</b> <b>rays</b> were shown to be electrons by Henri Becquerel in 1900, and gamma rays were shown to be electromagnetic radiation (light) in 1914. [...] These radiations had also been identified as emanating from atoms, hence they provided clues as to processes occurring within atoms. [...] Conversely, the radiations were also recognized as tools that could be exploited in scattering experiments to probe the interior of atoms.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{example is}} gamma-ray bursts, now {{known to be}} {{produced}} from processes too powerful to involve simple collections of atoms undergoing radioactive decay. This {{has led to the}} realization that many gamma rays produced in astronomical processes result not from radioactive decay or particle annihilation, but rather in much the same manner as the production of X-rays. Although gamma rays in astronomy are discussed below as non-radioactive events, in fact a few gamma rays are known in astronomy to originate explicitly from gamma decay of nuclei (as demonstrated by their spectra and emission half life). A classic example is that of supernova SN 1987A, which emits an [...] "afterglow" [...] of gamma-ray photons from the decay of newly made radioactive nickel-56 and cobalt-56. Most gamma rays in astronomy, however, arise by other mechanisms. Astronomical literature tends to write [...] "gamma-ray" [...] with a hyphen, by analogy to X-rays, rather than in a way analogous to alpha rays and <b>beta</b> <b>rays.</b> This notation tends to subtly stress the non-nuclear source of most astronomical [...] "gamma-rays".|$|E
