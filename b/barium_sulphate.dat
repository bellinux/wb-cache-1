25|$|The Greenside {{fault is}} a normal fault with an average dip of 70° to the east. A fault plane is not a flat surface and the actual dip of the Greenside fault varies between 58° east and vertical; in one place it was 83° west. As the rock {{fractured}} and the two sides moved against each other, cavities were created, partly filled with broken rock (fault breccia and fault gouge). Hydrothermal circulation of sea water at temperatures of 110130°C, probably during the Carboniferous Period, led to mineralisation of the fault cavities. The metal content {{is believed to have}} been leached out of rocks of the Skiddaw Group, or the underlying granite batholith. The mineralisation of the fault shows some vertical zonation, with baryte (<b>barium</b> <b>sulphate)</b> in the upper part of the vein, and small amounts of both blende (sphalerite, zinc sulphide) and chalcopyrite (copper-iron sulphide) at deeper levels.|$|E
25|$|Also {{associated}} with the granite batholith {{was the creation of}} mineral veins in parts of the Lake District. The richest known lead vein of all was found crossing the south-east shoulder of Green Side. This, the Greenside Lead Vein runs in a north-south direction and dips steeply to the east at 70°. It was up to 59 feet (18m) wide in the highest workings of the Greenside Mine, but averaged about 8 feet (2.5m) wide in deeper workings. The vein contained galena in a mixture of quartz and smashed rock. Galena (lead sulphide) is an ore of lead. The ore from Greenside also yielded 10oz of silver per ton of lead. Higher levels of the vein also contained quantities of baryte (<b>barium</b> <b>sulphate),</b> although at the time this had no commercial value. Very small amounts of blende (zinc sulphide) and chalcopyrite (copper-iron sulphide) were found in the deeper levels, but never in recoverable quantities.|$|E

While the silver of that area has mostly been depleted, Sonora still plays a large part in Mexico’s standing {{as one of the top}} fifteen producers of minerals in the world, leading in silver, celestite and bismuth. Sonora is the leading producer of gold, copper, graphite, molybdenum, and wollastonite. There are still deposits of silver in the Sierra Madre Occidental. Sonora also has one of the largest coal reserves in the country. The state has the largest mining surface in Mexico, and three of the country’s largest mines: La Caridad, Cananea and Mineria María. It is also home to North America’s oldest copper mine, located in Cananea. Grupo México, with one of its principle mining operations in Cananea, is the world’s third-largest copper producer. In 2002, mines produced 6,634.5 kilograms of gold, 153,834 kilograms of silver, five tons of lead, 267,171 tons of copper, three tons of zinc, 18,961 tons of iron, 7,176 tons <b>barium</b> <b>sulphate.</b> However, annual production is heavily dependent on world market prices.|$|E
40|$|Problem statement: Scale {{deposition}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} serious oil field problems that inflict water injection systems primarily when two incompatible waters are involved. Approach: This study was conducted to investigate the permeability reduction caused by deposition of calcium, strontium and <b>barium</b> <b>sulphates</b> in sandstone cores from mixing of injected Malaysian sea waters (Angsi and Barton) and formation water that contained high concentration of calcium, barium and strontium ions at various temperatures (60 - 90 °C) and differential pressures (125 - 175 psig). The solubility of common oil field scales formed and how their solubilities were affected by changes in salinity and temperatures (40 - 90 °C) were also studied. The morphology and particle size of scaling crystals formed as shown by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) were also presented. Results: The results showed that a large extent of permeability damage caused by calcium, strontium and <b>barium</b> <b>sulphates</b> that deposited on the rock pore surface. The rock permeability decline indicates the influence of the concentration of calcium, barium and strontium ions. Conclusion: At higher temperatures, the deposition of CaSO 4 and SrSO 4 scales increases and the deposition of BaSO 4 scale decreases since the solubilities of CaSO 4 and SrSO 4 scales decreases and the solubility of BaSO 4 increases with increasing temperature. The deposition of CaSO 4, SrSO 4 and BaSO 4 scales during flow of injection waters into porous media was shown by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) micrographs...|$|R

40|$|IN {{a series}} of methods {{recently}} proposed (Robertson & Webb, 1939) for the micro-estimation of the principal constituents of sea water and of the body fluids of marine animals, that for sulphate was on the whole the least satisfactory. As there described it consists of precipitation by means of barium chloride and direct titration of the excess <b>barium</b> with sodium <b>sulphate,</b> using rhodizonic acid as indicator. The simplicity of the method is to some extent outweighed by the capricious behaviour of the indicator, which renders the judging of the end-point an operation which, even after considerable practice, {{it is difficult to}} perform with great confidence. Although the error may usually be kept without difficulty below 2 %, duplicate titrations are necessary if an occasional error somewhat larger than this is to be avoided. In cases where speed is of greater importance than the highest accuracy the method is probably the best that is available, but it was thought that an alter-native method, based on that of Van Slyke et al. (1927) for total base in blood, might be made to yield more accurate results and require less practice. The basic principle of this method is the same as that used by Sendroy (1937) for the estimation of chloride; namely, the addition of an insoluble iodate, which reacts with the ion to be estimated so as to form a more insoluble salt and liberate iodate ions'into the solution. For the estimation of chloride silver iodate is used; for <b>sulphate,</b> <b>barium</b> iodate. A few preliminary experiments with lead iodate and lead iodide showed that they were useless except perhaps for very high concentra-tions of sulphate.

Together with nuclear research, shielding of different types of radiation is an important current topic of research aiming at their safety.

Two-stage neutralisation using limestone {{in the first stage}} to pH 4, followed by second stage lime treatment appears to be an economically attractive approach.

40|$|Calcium {{sulphate}} dihydrate is {{a compound}} important among those which form troublesome scale in distillation apparatus {{for the production}} of potable water from the sea. Among methods employed for the reduction of scale-formation is the use of certain substances which inhibit the crystallization of scale-forming materials. The present study is an investigation of some of the factors involved in the inhibition of crystallization from supersaturated solutions. The crystallization of CaSO 4. 2 H 2 O, both seeded and unseeded, from solutions containing sodium chloride and sodium tripolyphosphate, has been studied {{as a function of the}} supersaturation and of the concentration of polyphosphate additive. The processes occurring have been monitored by following the concentrations of calcium and polyphosphate species in solution with time, using compleximetric and colorimetric analysis. Both in the seeded and unseeded crystallization, the presence of polyphosphate led to the inhibition of crystallization. Induction periods have been shown to be logarithmically related to supersaturation and additive concentration and in the seeded case to be dependent on the mass of seed crystals for small amounts of seed. The interaction between tripolyphosphate in solution and calcium sulphate dihydrate has been studied by measurements of concentration loss from solution and the take-up of polyphosphate shown to involve processes other than simple sorption.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} work was to {{investigate}} how different gaseous compounds, present in an automotive exhaust from lean-tuned combustion, interact with so-called NO x storage catalysts containing Al 2 O 3 as a support, BaO as the NO x storage compound and noble metals to provide oxidation and reduction functions. The investigations included model sample preparations, flow reactor studies with various gas mixtures and spectroscopic experiments (FTIR and XPS). The results show {{that several of the}} exhaust gas components (CO 2, NO x, SO 2, O 2) interact strongly with the catalyst, and both the storage compound (BaO) and the noble metals are affected. Due to the affinity of <b>barium</b> oxide for <b>sulphate</b> formation, and since sulphur is present in significant amounts in gasoline, diesel and lubricants, special attention was paid to sulphur compounds in the exhaust gas. The sulphur studies indicated that deactivation (poisoning) occurs in both net oxidising and net reducing gas mixtures containing SO 2. After exposure in oxygen excess significant amounts of sulphates were detected with XPS and FTIR. Sulphates were also detected during net reducing sulphur exposure, but in much smaller amounts. It is suggested that the mechanism for sulphur deactivation under net oxidising and net reducing conditions are different. During lean conditions sulphate formation on the NO x storage sites on BaO seems to be the dominant mechanism. The results obtained during rich conditions, with SO 2 in the gas mixture, suggest a mechanism dominated by deactivation of the NO oxidation and NO x reduction functions of the catalyst, e. g. by formation of (reduced) sulphur species on the noble metal particles...|$|R
40|$|It was {{the purpose}} of this {{research}} work to develop a method that gives indications for the fixation of heavy metals in hardenend cement paste. Animony, barium, lead, chromium, molybdenum and vanadium were investigated. Based on the development of pore solution concentrations of the heavy metals in the course of hydration conclusions concerning the binding mineral phases should be drawn. For this it was necessary to describe the process of hydration as precisely as possible. In order to determine the concentrations of environmentally relevant parameters in the pore solution it was essential to optimise the chemical analysis. This was done by the Central Division of Analytical Chemistry (ZCH) of the Research Centre Jülich. With the pore solution concentrations and the contents of the solids the dissolved proportions of the heavy metals were calculated. Subject of the investigations were hardenened cement pastes made of commercial Ordinary Portland Cements (OPC) with different chemical/mineralogical compositions. Additionally the leaching of the trace elements and the main constituents was investigated during the fresh concrete period and after hardening. The eluate concentrations were compared to the pore solution concentrations. For diffusion controlled leaching a concentration gradient from pore solution to eluate is necessary. If solution equilibrium is reached, the eluate concentrations are in ideal case equal to the pore solution concentrations. The findings concerning the binding of the considered heavy metals can be summarised as follows: Based on the development of pore solution concentrations of <b>barium</b> and <b>sulphate</b> it can be concluded that BaSO 4 precipitates. The leaching from hardened cement paste is controlled by diffusion. Chromium from chromate containing OPC as well as from chromate reduced OPC is in all probability incorporated into ettringite. In OPC {{a large proportion of the}} molybdenum is present in a readily soluble form as molybdate. Also for this element an incorporation into ettringite can be concluded. In the leaching tests molybdenum was detected only during the fresh concrete period. For vanadium a fixation as oxianion in ettringite is discussed in literature as well. For this trace element the dissolved proportions at the beginning of hydration were one to two orders of magnitude lower than for chromium and vanadium. This implies that the binding in the clinker phases is much better. The development of the dissolved proportions in the course of time differs from chromium, molybdenum and sulphate as well. Because of this a fixation in ettringite is unlikely. Presumably vanadium is sorped at CSH-phases. In the long-term tank test the concentrations of the eluate approached the pore solution concentrations. This implies that solution processes affect the leaching, a prognosis based on diffusion models is not realistic. The readily soluble lead content of OPC is also very low and decreases further during the induction period. Because of the low concentrations the fixation could not be clarified definitely. The kinetics of leaching imply a retention, meaning that the release of lead is lower than for diffusion controlled processes. The readily soluble antimony content of OPC is again one order of magnitude lower than for lead. During 28 days of hydration the dissolved proportion quadruplicates. Probably antimony is bound to C 3 S and a small proportion is dissolved during hydration. Most of the antimony remains in the hydration products, most probably in the CSH-phases. In the leaching tests concentrations of antimony were frequently below the detection limit. In addition to the leaching tests with deionised water experiments with tap water were included in the test program. During the fresh concrete period the influence of the eluent on the release of heavy metals was small, but for the hardened cement paste large differences were found. The pH-values were significantly lower for tap water, the redox potential was higher. The leaching of the main constituents calcium, silicon, aluminium and sulphate proved a solvent attack of the deionised water. Because of this the release of heavy metals increased by a factor of 6 to 16 times, for barium even 180 times compared to tap water. An increase of the release due to the lower pH-value in case of tab water was not observed in any case. A first step towards implementation of the results in practice could be a modification of the existing evaluation concept for the groundwater compatibility of concrete. The use of mineralised water instead of deionised water would result in a more realistic release in the long-term tank test. In order to check the applicability of diffusion models the analysis of pore solution is advisable...|$|R

40|$|Tese de mestrado, Geologia Aplicada (Hidrogeologia), Universidade de Lisboa, Faculdade de Ciências, 2016 Soil-Aquifer Treatment (SAT) is a {{well-established}} Managed Aquifer Recharge (MAR) complementary method which main {{purpose is to}} increase water availability in aquifers by enhancing {{the quality of the}} injected water. SAT-MAR methods are an important way of addressing water scarcity challenges by reusing water of impaired quality, such as wastewater, converting it into a reliable resource. They can be quite useful in water resource management, particularly in semi-arid regions, helping to face decrease of rainfall and long drought periods resulting from climate change. In this context, SAT can also present itself as a relatively simple and inexpensive complementary method of treatment, lessening possible environmental problems. The research presented in this dissertation was developed in the framework of EU 7 th Framework Project MARSOL project which aims to demonstrate the reliability of MAR processes to face water scarcity problems in Southern Europe and Mediterranean regions. Several soil characterization, soil-column and batch experiments were conducted at National Laboratory for Civil Engineering (LNEC) using a soil collected in São Bartolomeu de Messines, one of the projects demonstration sites where SAT-MAR basins are to be constructed using treated wastewater as primary infiltration water source. These experiments aimed to characterize the soil behaviour at lab scale by simulating infiltration basin conditions, determining hydraulic characteristics and contaminant retention capacities. Natural soil results obtained were later compared to those obtained for a soil mixture produced in LNEC. This soil mixture will act as a reactive layer to be installed {{in the bottom of the}} infiltration basins, increasing capacity to retain certain contaminants detected in inflow water, but also keeping acceptable hydraulic conductivity without hindering the water-soil interaction. The referred mixture results from a combination of cheap and easily available materials with the natural soil. Unregulated emerging contaminant problematic was also discussed, focussing in pharmaceutical compounds, considering the type of source water used in these experiments – São Bartolomeu de Messines (SBM) wastewater treatment plant effluent. High concentration of ammonia and sulphates were measured and traces of 17 pharmaceuticals were detected. SBM natural soil that was used in experiments is a loamy sand composed of 81. 91 % sand, 15. 95 % of silt and 2. 14 % clay, having quartz, calcite, montmorillonite and anorthite as major mineral constituents and traces of dolomite, illite, kaolinite and hematite. It has 24. 02 % of carbonates percentage, low organic matter content (2. 66 %), average bulk density of 1. 44 g/cm 3 and average porosity of 43. 6 %. Five soil-column experiments were conducted in this soil for different time lengths, testing different methods of column assembling, thickness, soil packing, saturation conditions and injection method (Column 1 to 5 – C 1 to C 5). For the three different soil mixtures produced, four soil column experiments were conducted (Column 6 to 9 – C 6 to C 9). Outflow samples were collected for the experiments that used wastewater as injection source (C 3 to C 5 and C 8 and C 9) – metals, nitrogen cycle components, major ions and pharmaceuticals were analysed. Pharmaceuticals were not measured for C 3 inflow. Considering hydraulic behaviour for natural soil, and taking as reference the first day of experiment, C 5 showed highest flow rate (1. 504 cm 3 /min) and permeability (2. 536 m/d) while C 4 showed the worst results (0. 363 cm 3 /min and 0. 589 m/d). For soil mixture behaviour, C 6 had higher flow rate and permeability (7. 722 cm 3 /min 12. 579 m/d) but this one along C 7 suffered high soil washing out along the experiment. Concerning inflow water quality, from 32 parameters analysed (excluding pharmaceuticals), C 3 had 17 values above the limit of recovery (LOR), C 4 and C 5 had 17 and C 8 and C 9 had 26. For pharmaceuticals, from the 24 parameters analysed, 14 were above LOR in C 4 and C 5 inflow, while in C 8 and C 9, nine parameters were above LOR. Comparing the outflow in terms of quality, and more precisely average concentration of metals, from 11 parameters considered, C 3 has 7 parameters where outflow concentration is higher than inflow, while C 4 has 6 and C 5 has 9. C 8 has only 3 parameters in which outflow average concentration surpasses the inflow, although inflow sample presents a slight enrichment in certain metals when compared to other columns. Phosphorus shows the highest reduction in all columns. For nitrogen cycle components, ammonia showed high concentration at inflow and a reduction at outflow for all columns, while nitrites present low concentration at inflow and high concentration at outflow. C 3, C 5 and C 8 show higher average concentration of nitrates when compared to inflow. Concentration at outflow in C 8 reaches 140. 46 mg/L, a very high value when compared to C 3 (0. 86 mg/L) and C 5 (6. 51 mg/L). Concerning major ions, for the 7 parameters considered, 4 were above inflow concentration C 4, C 5 and C 8. C 8 experiment shows a worse overall behaviour for these parameters than that with higher average concentrations. Soil samples were collected and analysed after C 3 and C 5 experiments stopped. C 3 shows almost equal concentration of boron, copper and zinc in top and bottom sections, but boron concentrations were lower. Ammonia showed higher concentrations when compared with nitrates and nitrites, being heavily retained in the soil top section, while nitrates where not detected in both sections and nitrites showed very small concentration. Phosphorous and phosphates show higher concentrations in the soil top section. From the set of selected pharmaceuticals, none showed concentrations above LOR in C 3. For C 5, boron and copper showed slightly lower concentrations to those detected in C 3, and ammonia shows a high concentration on the top section. Nitrates and nitrites were also detected in higher concentration on column top section. Phosphorous and phosphates show lower concentrations in both sections when compared to C 3 and sulphates where not detected in both sections. Caffeine was the only detected pharmaceutical compound in C 5. Batch experiments were also conducted in both natural soil and soil mixture. For the set of 32 parameters analysed in the inflow and outflow water of natural soil batch, eight showed a decrease in concentration in the outflow when compared to inflow. Highest percentage of removal is observed in aluminium, followed by iron, and the lowest in sodium. Nitrites, <b>sulphate,</b> <b>barium,</b> calcium, chromium, magnesium, manganese, nickel, vanadium and chloride showed an increased concentration in outflow. 14 of 24 pharmaceuticals analysed had values above LOR, only seven of those were persistent and were detected in the outflow (propanolol, bezafibrate, diclofenac, gemfibrozil, naproxen, indometacin and carbamazepine). For the persistent compounds, lowest removal rate was detected for naproxen while seven of the compounds showed 100 % removal (atenolol, betaxolol, bisoprolol, metoprolol, sotalol e pentoxifillin). For the same set of parameters, 25 were detected in soil mixture inflow water while only 20 were detected in the outflow water. Ammonia presented the highest adsorbed amount and copper, zinc, nitrites, calcium, magnesium, manganese, potassium and chloride showed an increase of concentration in outflow. Removal was higher in antimony and lowest in lithium. For the pharmaceuticals, 14 were above LOR in inflow water and only 1 in the outflow water. 100 % removal rate was observed in atenolol, betaxolol, bisoprolol, metoprolol, propranolol, sotalol, bezafibrate, diclofenac, gemfibrozil, ibuprofen, indomethacin, naproxen and pentoxifyllin. Carbamazepine showed recalcitrant behaviour, but a relatively high removal rate (86. 3 %). Transport of ammonia, nitrates and nitrites was modelled in Hydrus- 1 D to understand the conditions inside the column in continuous saturated conditions using C 3 and C 4 data. Simulations showed ammonia being retained on the top of the column whereas nitrites showed a small increase in concentration as ammonia concentration decrease. Then nitrites concentration decrease at the column bottom while nitrates concentration increased. Saturation indexes (Log SI) were determined at inflow and outflow for calcite, dolomite and hematite in C 3, C 4 and C 8 by hydrogeochemical speciation in PHREEQC. C 3 inflow water is unsaturated in calcite and dolomite and it’s in equilibrium with hematite. C 4 inflow solution is close to stability concerning dolomite and calcite while high Log SI for hematite was determined, showing saturation in this iron oxide. C 8 inflow solution is slightly unsaturated in calcite and dolomite, and hematite Log SI is showing oversaturation at inflow. For all columns, outflow solutions are saturated in hematite, and oscillate from unsaturation to saturation in calcite and dolomite along the experiment. Inverse modelling in PHREEQC was also used in C 3 to understand phase transfers that occur between inflow solution and the soil media along the experiments under invariable saturation conditions. The natural soil shows some suitability to be used as a base infiltration layer for the SAT-MAR infiltration basins in what concerns infiltration capacity, but is expected to show some problems in the long term, with a continuous decrease of permeability. The soil mixture resulted in a more pervious material with a good long term hydraulic behaviour, with better response to cycles of saturation and non-saturation allowing the oxygenation of the soil. The sequential use of oxic/anoxic conditions is the best approach to ensure maximum attenuation efficiency, since some elements degrade better in oxic conditions, and|$|R
