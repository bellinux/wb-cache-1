25|$|Count 4: Replacement of ThaiCom 4 with iPSTAR. A {{previous}} {{government had}} originally contracted with ShinSat to launch and operate ThaiCom 4 as a <b>backup</b> <b>satellite</b> for ThaiCom 3. Instead, ShinSat {{negotiated with the}} Thaksin government to launch iPSTAR, {{at the time the}} largest commercial satellite in history, which it claimed could offer commercial internet services while also providing backup for ThaiCom 3. However, the claim is not technically possible since iPSTAR does not have C-band transponders as ThaiCom 3. Shin Corp's ownership in ShinSat was subsequently reduced from 51% to 40%. The judges found that the changes in ownership and satellite specification change reduced Thailand's communications security by not having the <b>backup</b> <b>satellite</b> for ThaiCom 3 on the one-to-one basis. It also noted that the negotiations allowed ShinSat to launch a satellite with much greater commercial potential than ThaiCom 4 without having to bid for a separate concession agreement.|$|E

40|$|The authors {{propose to}} use an analog neural network {{controller}} implemented in hardware, independent of the active control system, {{for use in a}} <b>satellite</b> <b>backup</b> control mode. The controller uses coarse sun sensor inputs. The field of view of the sensors activate the neural controller, creating an analog dead band with respect to the direction of the sun on each axis. This network controls the orientation of the vehicle toward the sunlight to ensure adequate power for the system. The attitude of the spacecraft is stabilized with respect to the ambient magnetic field on orbit. This paper develops a model of the controller using real-time coarse sun sensor data and a dynamic model of a prototype system based on a satellite system.

40|$|The Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) Radio Occultation/Reflective (RO/R) {{instrument}} collects global atmospheric {{data and}} oceanic wind speed data for weather prediction and climate researches. This paper proposes the conceptual {{design of the}} satellite constellation and the satellite to realize the GNSS-RO/R mission based on the cubesat platform, with the goal to achieve cost effectiveness and minimum deployed schedule. The cubesat considered in the study is 6 U and within 10 kilogram. The proposed innovative constellation consists of 12 (minimum required) plus 6 (<b>backup)</b> <b>satellites</b> on three 500 km altitude sun synchronous planes, 6 satellites even phasing on each plane. It {{is expected to have}} 3000 profile measurements per day at minimum (3600 profiles as a goal). The payload instrument will be able to collect RO/R measurements via GPS and GLONASS. The mission lifetime is 3 years. The on-orbit redundancy, instead of redundant satellite components, is adapted to increase system reliability. The satellite design of this study faces very tough challenging to meet the 10 -kg mass constraint. The proposed solutions to lower down mass include the creative payload design, the plasma thruster based reaction control subsystem and attitude control subsystem, the use of special non-space grade made-in-Taiwan components, and the creative mission scheduling among satellites to optimize daily global coverage with limited duty cycle of each satellite (the duty cycle can not be 100 % because of mass saving on solar array and battery). The study demonstrates the feasibility to achieve the system design. The lessons learned of the system design study have also been introduced. The international cooperation and investment to realize this development is welcome...|$|R

40|$|E-Loran, or {{enhanced}} Loran, is {{the latest}} in the longstanding and proven series of low fre-quency, LOng-RAnge Navigation systems. eLoran evolved from Loran-C in response to the 2001 Volpe Report on GPS vulnerability. It improves upon previous Loran systems with updated equipment, signals, and operating procedures. The improvements allow eLoran to provide better performance and additional services when compared to Loran-C, and enable eLoran to serve as a <b>backup</b> to <b>satellite</b> navigation in many important applications. Different applications impose specific requirements on the navigation system’s accuracy, availability, integrity and continuity performance. In the maritime sector, accuracy require-ments are the most stringent. In order to comply with the requirements of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) for harbour entrance approach, eLoran has to provide an accuracy of better than 10 m (95 %).

40|$|The rapid {{development}} of satellite navigation and timing technologies and the broad availability of user equipment and applications has dramatically {{changed the world}} over the last 20 years. It took 38 years from {{the launch of the}} world’s first artificial satellite, Sputnik 1, (October 4, 1957) to the day NAVSTAR GPS became fully operational (July 17, 1995). In the next 20 years user equipment became widely available at the consumer level, and 10 global and regional satellite systems were partially or fully deployed. These highly precise signals provided free to the user have been incorporated by clever engineers into virtually every technology. At the same time interference with these signals (spoofing and jamming) have become a significant day to day problem in many societies and pose a significant threat to critical infrastructure.

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 30 -November 02, 1995 / Riviera Hotel, Las Vegas, NevadaSince June of 1993, an {{experimental}} GPS receiver {{system has been}} orbiting the earth aboard a small, low-altitude, polar-orbiting satellite called RADCAL. The purpose of the experiment was to prove the concept of using GPS for satellite navigation. If successful, the system would also provide a <b>backup</b> to the <b>satellite's</b> primary navigation beacon. The goal: provide position and velocity data to an accuracy of three to five meters, and provide attitude data to within a degree. The configuration of the RADCAL GPS experiment precluded realtime feedback loops for navigation; the data was stored and downloaded after a designated collection period. On the ground, a lengthy process was used to yield the position and attitude data days after the collection event. The GPS receivers and ground equipment were configured in several modes; they ultimately yielded a position accuracy of five meters, and attitude of two degrees. This was the original goal, and the experiment was considered successful. However, one of the receivers failed in November 1993, and the other failed in January 1995. The GPS receivers were commercially available and not spaceflight proven; they were suspected of being vulnerable to single-event upsets and latchups. This {{turned out to be}} the cause of the failure of both receivers. The interface between the GPS receivers and RADCAL's other subsystems proved to be the area which could not tolerate corrupt data. The single-event latchups problems would ultimately lead to the failure of the receivers. These difficulties, as well as other lesser obstacles, provide a host of lessons learned for future satellite navigation systems...|$|R
