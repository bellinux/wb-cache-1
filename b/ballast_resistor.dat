Design considerations of <b>ballast</b> <b>resistors</b> for SiGe power HBTs at these two frequencies are investigated for both good thermal stability and high RF power performance.

The ballast is a fixed resistor with usually two center taps, and the fan speed selector switch is used to bypass portions of the ballast: all of them for full speed, and none for the low speed setting. A very common failure occurs when the fan is being constantly run at the next-to-full speed setting (usually 3 out of 4). This will cause a very short piece of resistor coil to be operated with a relatively high current (up to 10A), eventually burning it out. This will render the fan unable to run at the reduced speed settings.|$|E

Some types of <b>ballast</b> <b>resistors</b> were built into an envelope like a tube that was easily replaceable. With mains voltages of around 220 V, the power dissipated by the additional resistance and the voltage drop across it could be quite high, and it was common to use a resistive power cable (mains cord) of defined resistance, running warm, rather than putting a hot resistor inside the case. If a resistive power cable was used, an inexperienced repairer might replace it with a standard cable, or use the wrong length, damaging the equipment and risking a fire.|$|R

Therefore, we have investigated the static current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of the MHCD for discharge currents up to l 5 mA and argon pressures up to 900 mbar. For the planar geometry, a scaling law of the microhollow cathode effect was found as function of the reduced pressure pD. On the contrary, for the closed cathode geometry a solely positive slope over the entire I-V characteristics is obtained.

40|$|Abstract — SiC device area is {{presently}} limited by material and processing defects. To meet the large current handling requirements of modern power conditioning systems, paralleling {{of a large}} number of devices is required. This can increase cost and complexity through dicing, soldering, inclusion of <b>ballast</b> <b>resistors,</b> and forming multiple wire bonds. Furthermore, paralleling numerous discrete devices increases package volume/weight and reduces power density. To overcome these complexities, PiN diodes were designed, fabricated at 83 % yield, tested, and interconnected on a three-inch 4 H-SiC wafer to form an 11. 72 -cm 2 active-area full wafer diode. The full wafer diode exhibited a breakdown voltage of 1790 V at an extremely low leakage current density of less than 0. 002 mA/cm 2. At a pulsed current density of 5. 5 kA/cm 2 and a rise time of di/dt = 1. 1 kA/µs, the peak current through the wafer interconnected diode was 64. 3 kA with a forward voltage drop of 10. 3 V.

Coatings deposited using plasma-enhanced {{chemical vapor deposition}} (PECVD) techniques attract many interests due to their economic and ecological advantages. Plasma deposited films are generally amorphous, insoluble, highly cross-linked, highly resistant to heat and corrosion and very adhesive to different substrates. Several atmospheric pressure plasma sources have been researched for thin film deposition. Compared to plasma sources that limit the plasma region between electrodes (inter-electrode distance: a few millimeters), plasma jets possess the characteristics of spatial separation between plasma region and processing region.
