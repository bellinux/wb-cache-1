5|$|The {{external}} morphology of Lepidoptera is {{the physiological}} {{structure of the}} bodies of insects belonging to the order Lepidoptera, also known as <b>butterflies</b> <b>and</b> <b>moths.</b> Lepidoptera are distinguished from other orders {{by the presence of}} scales on the external parts of the body and appendages, especially the wings. <b>Butterflies</b> <b>and</b> <b>moths</b> vary in size from microlepidoptera only a few millimetres long, to a wingspan of many inches such as the Atlas moth. Comprising over 160,000 described species, the Lepidoptera possess variations of the basic body structure which has evolved to gain advantages in adaptation and distribution.|$|E
5|$|RNAi has varying {{effects in}} {{different}} species of Lepidoptera (<b>butterflies</b> <b>and</b> <b>moths).</b> Possibly because their saliva and gut juice is better at breaking down RNA, the cotton bollworm, the beet armyworm and the Asiatic rice borer have {{so far not been}} proven susceptible to RNAi by feeding.|$|E

5|$|Bees are {{themselves}} Müllerian mimics of other aposematic insects {{with the same}} colour scheme, including wasps, lycid and other beetles, and many <b>butterflies</b> <b>and</b> <b>moths</b> (Lepidoptera) which {{are themselves}} distasteful, often through acquiring bitter and poisonous chemicals from their plant food. All the Müllerian mimics, including bees, benefit from the reduced risk of predation that results from their easily recognised warning coloration.|$|E
5|$|The {{red maple}} is a {{used as a}} food source by several forms of wildlife. Elk and white-tailed deer in {{particular}} use the current season's growth of red maple as {{an important source of}} winter food. Several Lepidoptera (<b>butterflies</b> <b>and</b> <b>moths)</b> utilize the leaves as food; see List of Lepidoptera that feed on maples.|$|E
5|$|<b>Butterflies</b> <b>and</b> <b>moths</b> {{are able}} to see ultra-violet (UV) light, and wing colours and {{patterns}} are principally observed by Lepidoptera in this region. The patterns seen on their wing under UV light differ considerably from those seen in normal light. The UV patterns act as visual cues which help differentiate between species {{for the purpose of}} mating. Studies have been carried out on Lepidoptera (mostly butterflies) wing patterns illuminated by UV light.|$|E

5|$|Mecoptera {{have special}} {{importance}} {{in the evolution of}} the insects. Two of the most important insect orders, Lepidoptera (<b>butterflies</b> <b>and</b> <b>moths)</b> and Diptera (true flies), along with Trichoptera (caddisflies), probably evolved from ancestors belonging to, or strictly related to, the Mecoptera. Evidence includes anatomical and biochemical similarities as well as transitional fossils, such as Permotanyderus and Choristotanyderus, which lie between the Mecoptera and Diptera. The group was once much more widespread and diverse than it is now, with four suborders during the Mesozoic.|$|E
5|$|Like most Old World warblers, {{this small}} species is insectivorous, moving restlessly though foliage or briefly hovering. It has been {{recorded}} as taking insects, mainly flies, from more than 50 families, along with other small and medium-sized invertebrates. It will take the eggs and larvae of <b>butterflies</b> <b>and</b> <b>moths,</b> particularly those of the winter moth. The chiffchaff has been estimated to require about one-third of its weight in insects daily, and it feeds almost continuously in the autumn to put on extra fat as fuel for the long migration flight.|$|E
5|$|The diet {{consists}} of insects {{and other small}} arthropods. One study of red-capped robin faeces conducted near Kambalda, Western Australia, revealed 96% of their diet {{was made up of}} beetles, while ants made up the remainder. Other prey recorded include spiders, and insects such as grasshoppers including the Australian Plague Locust (Chortoicetes terminifera), adult and larval <b>butterflies</b> <b>and</b> <b>moths,</b> including geometer moths, dragonflies and damselflies, mantises, antlions, true bugs, including chinch bugs of the family Lygaeidae and shield bugs, various types of beetles, earwigs, and flies such as blow-flies and horse-flies.|$|E
50|$|Some other Lepidoptera (<b>butterfly</b> <b>and</b> <b>moth)</b> larvae also feed on cotton - see list of Lepidoptera {{that feed}} on cotton plants.|$|R
25|$|Wheat {{is used as}} a {{food plant}} by the larvae of some Lepidoptera (<b>butterfly</b> <b>and</b> <b>moth)</b> species {{including}} the flame, rustic shoulder-knot, setaceous Hebrew character <b>and</b> turnip <b>moth.</b>|$|R

5|$|The main {{component}} of the diet of all antbirds is arthropods. These are mostly insects, including grasshoppers and crickets, cockroaches, praying mantises, stick insects and the larvae of <b>butterflies</b> <b>and</b> <b>moths.</b> In addition antbirds often take spiders, scorpions and centipedes. They swallow smaller prey items quickly, whereas they often beat larger items against branches in order to remove wings and spines. Larger species can kill and consume frogs and lizards as well, but generally these do not form {{an important part of}} the diet of this family. Other food items may also be eaten, including fruit, eggs and slugs.|$|E
5|$|The phylogenetic {{position}} of Diptera has been controversial. The monophyly of holometabolous insects {{has long been}} accepted, with the main orders being established as Lepidoptera, Coleoptera, Hymenoptera and Diptera, {{and it is the}} relationships between these groups which has caused difficulties. Diptera is widely thought {{to be a member of}} Mecopterida, along with Lepidoptera (<b>butterflies</b> <b>and</b> <b>moths),</b> Trichoptera (caddisflies), Siphonaptera (fleas), Mecoptera (scorpionflies) and possibly Strepsiptera (twisted-wing flies). Diptera has been grouped with Siphonaptera and Mecoptera in the Antliophora, but this has not been confirmed by molecular studies.|$|E
5|$|Chemical {{defense is}} another {{important}} defense found among species of Coleoptera and Lepidoptera, usually being advertised by bright colors, such as the monarch butterfly. They obtain their toxicity by sequestering the chemicals from the plants they eat into their own tissues. Some Lepidoptera manufacture their own toxins. Predators that eat poisonous <b>butterflies</b> <b>and</b> <b>moths</b> may become sick and vomit violently, learning not to eat those types of species; this is actually the basis of Müllerian mimicry. A predator who has previously eaten a poisonous lepidopteran may avoid other species with similar markings in the future, thus saving many other species as well. Some ground beetles of the Carabidae family can spray chemicals from their abdomen with great accuracy, to repel predators.|$|E

5|$|The south part of {{the woods}} {{is an area of}} former pasture {{woodland}} with old pollards, mainly oak and some small-leaved lime. To the north, the area comprises ancient woodland of old coppice with standards and contains a rich variety of trees. Rare trees include Bristol whitebeam (Sorbus bristoliensis) and wild service tree (Sorbus torminalis). There are multiple species of Sorbus within the woods with at least nine native and four imported species, {{making it one of the}} most important sites in Britain for this tree. Birds which live in the woods include the raven (Corvus) and peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus). Many <b>butterflies</b> <b>and</b> <b>moths</b> can be seen in summer including the white-letter hairstreak (Satyrium w-album).|$|E
5|$|Triaenops menamena is a bat in {{the genus}} Triaenops found on Madagascar, {{mainly in the}} drier regions. It was known as Triaenops rufus until 2009, when it was {{discovered}} that that name had been incorrectly applied to the species. Triaenops rufus is a synonym of Triaenops persicus, a Middle Eastern species closely related to T.menamena— the Malagasy species had previously been placed as a subspecies of T.persicus by some authors. Triaenops menamena is mostly found in forests, but also occurs in other habitats. It often roosts in large colonies and eats insects such as <b>butterflies</b> <b>and</b> <b>moths.</b> Because of its wide range, common occurrence, and tolerance of habitat degradation, it is not considered to be threatened.|$|E
5|$|Xerochrysum bracteatum, {{commonly}} known as the golden everlasting or strawflower, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae native to Australia. Described by Étienne Pierre Ventenat in 1803, it was known as Helichrysum bracteatum for many years before being transferred to a new genus Xerochrysum in 1990. It grows as a woody or herbaceous perennial or annual shrub up to a metre (3ft) tall with green or grey leafy foliage. Golden yellow or white flower heads are produced from spring to autumn; their distinctive feature is the papery bracts that resemble petals. The species is widespread, growing in a variety of habitats across the country, from rainforest margins to deserts and subalpine areas. The golden everlasting serves as food for various larvae of lepidopterans (<b>butterflies</b> <b>and</b> <b>moths),</b> and adult butterflies, hoverflies, native bees, small beetles, and grasshoppers visit the flower heads.|$|E
50|$|Nepeta {{species are}} used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera (<b>butterfly</b> <b>and</b> <b>moth)</b> species {{including}} Coleophora albitarsella, and as nectar sources for pollinators, such as honeybees and hummingbirds.|$|R
50|$|There is a {{butterfly}} museum built by Frederic Smetacek at Jones Estate, which has over 2500 <b>butterfly</b> <b>and</b> <b>moth</b> specimens <b>and</b> 1100 species of insects {{that are found}} in this region.|$|R
25|$|Coffee {{is used as}} a {{food plant}} by the larvae of some Lepidoptera (<b>butterfly</b> <b>and</b> <b>moth)</b> species, Dalcera abrasa, turnip <b>moth</b> <b>and</b> some members of the genus Endoclita, {{including}} E. damor and E. malabaricus.|$|R
5|$|Many {{animals and}} plants have taken up {{residence}} in urban environments. They tend to be adaptable generalists and use the town's features to make their homes. Rats and mice have followed man around the globe, pigeons, peregrines, sparrows, swallows and house martins use the buildings for nesting, bats use roof space for roosting, foxes visit the garbage bins and squirrels, coyotes, raccoons and skunks roam the streets. About 2,000 coyotes are thought to live in and around Chicago. A survey of dwelling houses in northern European cities {{in the twentieth century}} found about 175 species of invertebrate inside them, including 53 species of beetle, 21 flies, 13 <b>butterflies</b> <b>and</b> <b>moths,</b> 13 mites, 9 lice, 7 bees, 5 wasps, 5 cockroaches, 5 spiders, 4 ants {{and a number of other}} groups. In warmer climates, termites are serious pests in the urban habitat; 183 species are known to affect buildings and 83 species cause serious structural damage.|$|E
5|$|The {{reproductive}} {{stage of}} the insect is the winged adult or imago. The surface of both <b>butterflies</b> <b>and</b> <b>moths</b> is covered by scales, {{each of which is}} an outgrowth from a single epidermal cell. The head is small and dominated by the two large compound eyes. These are capable of distinguishing flower shapes or motion but not for clearly viewing distant objects. Colour perception is good, especially in some species in the blue/violet range. The antennae are composed of many segments and have clubbed tips (unlike moths that have tapering or feathery antennae). The sensory receptors are concentrated in the tips and can detect odours. Taste receptors are located on the palps and on the feet. The mouthparts are designed for sucking and the mandibles are usually reduced in size or absent. The first maxillae are elongated into a tubular proboscis which is curled up at rest and expanded when needed to feed. The first and second maxillae bear palps which function as sensory organs. Some species have a reduced proboscis or maxillary palps and do not feed as adults.|$|E
5|$|Triaenops menamena mainly {{occurs in}} the dry regions of western Madagascar, but has also been {{recorded}} in humid areas in the far southeast and northeast, and is found up to 1300m (4300ft) above sea level. It mainly occurs in forests, but has also been recorded outside forest and is not dependent on it. An obligate cave dweller, it is known to roost in large colonies, with one cave colony estimated to contain over 40,000 bats; this cave also contained an estimated 10,000 Paratriaenops furculus. The effective population size of the species {{is estimated to be}} about 121,000. Lepidoptera (<b>butterflies</b> <b>and</b> <b>moths)</b> form the main component of its diet, but it also eats Coleoptera (beetles) and Hemiptera (bugs) and fewer members of some other insect orders. It is unclear how the ecological niches of Triaenops and the less frequently captured Paratriaenops furculus are separated, as both eat lepidopterans and occur in the same regions.|$|E
40|$|Surveys of <b>butterfly</b> <b>and</b> <b>moth</b> {{diversity}} in tropical forest fragments suggest that nocturnality confers a dispersal, {{and possibly a}} survival, advantage. The butterfly faunas of smaller fragments were depauperate; in contrast, the species richness of nocturnal moths was similar in all fragments and even in pasture. The lack of correlation between <b>butterfly</b> <b>and</b> <b>moth</b> species richness among fragments (r 2 = 0. 005) is best explained by movements of moths at night when ambient conditions in forest and pasture are most similar; butterflies face substantial daytime temperature, humidity, and solar radiation barriers. This interpretation is supported by information on birds, beetles, and bats...|$|R
