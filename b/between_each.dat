5|$|Gibanica is a round-shaped pastry with crispy golden-brown crust. The {{inside is}} multi-layered, and {{includes}} crumpled dough with {{small pieces of}} cheese <b>between</b> <b>each</b> layer. Gibanica can be served hot {{in the morning and}} is commonly accompanied by yogurt.|$|E
5|$|Stereochemical {{affinity}}: {{the genetic}} code {{is a result of}} a high affinity <b>between</b> <b>each</b> amino acid and its codon or anti-codon; the latter option implies that pre-tRNA molecules matched their corresponding amino acids by this affinity. Later during evolution, this matching was gradually replaced with matching by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases.|$|E

5|$|The guns {{mounted in}} the open battery were lighter {{than those in the}} casemates and were not {{enclosed}} but traversed on rails in the open air.

50|$|At the {{conclusion}} of a valid wedding, the marrying parties acquire the status of married person and, while the marriage persists, a man is called a husband. In heterosexual marriages the woman is called a wife; in same-sex marriages <b>between</b> males, <b>each</b> male is called a husband; <b>between</b> females, <b>each</b> is called a wife. Regardless of gender, a married person is the spouse of the other party to the marriage.|$|R

5|$|Vanadinite is a lead {{chlorovanadate}} {{with the}} chemical formula Pb5(VO4)3Cl. It is composed (by weight) of 73.15% lead, 10.79% vanadium, 13.56% oxygen, and 2.50% chlorine. Each structural unit of vanadinite contains a chlorine ion surrounded by six divalent lead ions {{at the corners}} of a regular octahedron, with one of the lead ions provided by an adjoining vanadinite molecule. The distance <b>between</b> <b>each</b> lead and chlorine ion is 317picometres. The shortest distance <b>between</b> <b>each</b> lead ion is 4.48Å. The octahedron shares two of its opposite faces with that of neighbouring vanadinite units, forming a continuous chain of octahedrons. Each vanadium atom is surrounded by four oxygen atoms {{at the corners of}} an irregular tetrahedron. The distance <b>between</b> <b>each</b> oxygen and vanadium atom is either 1.72 or 1.76Å. Three oxygen tetrahedrons adjoin each of the lead octahedrons along the chain.|$|E
5|$|A {{course of}} {{brachytherapy}} {{can be completed}} {{in less time than}} other radiotherapy techniques. This can help reduce the chance for surviving cancer-cells to divide and grow in the intervals <b>between</b> <b>each</b> radiotherapy dose. Patients typically have to make fewer visits to the radiotherapy clinic compared with EBRT, and may receive the treatment as outpatients. This makes treatment accessible and convenient for many patients. These features of brachytherapy mean that most patients are able to tolerate the brachytherapy procedure very well.|$|E

5|$|A refresh {{programme}} {{started for}} the Southern units in June 2012. This included a repaint and interior changes, such as changes to the grab rails on the top <b>between</b> <b>each</b> door. 455808 was the first completed, followed by 455812 in August 2012. The project was completed in December 2013, 455801 being the last unit.|$|E
5|$|After {{problems}} with the first two airborne operations in Sicily, the Royal Air Force advisor assigned to the 1st Airborne Division suggested that the American C-47 pilots adopt the Royal Air Force bomber stream formation. This entailed the aircraft flying in pairs one behind the other with one minute <b>between</b> <b>each</b> aircraft, instead of flying in their normal 'V' formation. The suggestion was dismissed by the American pilots, who were mostly pre-war airline pilots, not least because their training had not included any instruction in night time navigation and the inexperienced crews relied heavily on following the aircraft in front.|$|E
5|$|Another {{factor in}} making the Zephyr lighter than {{conventional}} trains was that the individual carbodies in the train share their trucks with adjacent cars. In this design by Budd engineer Walter B. Dean, the train was three articulated compartments. On conventional passenger cars, each carbody rode upon a pair of trucks (pivot-mounted wheel-axle assembly), with one truck at each end. The articulation not only {{reduced the number of}} trucks under the train, but it also dispensed with the need for couplers <b>between</b> <b>each</b> of the carbodies, further reducing the train's weight. It did, however, mean that train lengths could not be easily changed by switching out cars.|$|E

5|$|As {{early as}} 1857 the Beetons had {{considered}} using the magazine columns {{as the basis}} of a book of collected recipes and homecare advice, Hughes believes, and in November 1859 they launched a series of 48-page monthly supplements with The Englishwoman's Domestic Magazine. The print block for the whole series of the supplements was set from the beginning so the break <b>between</b> <b>each</b> edition was fixed at 48 pages, regardless of the text, and in several issues the text of a sentence or recipe is split between the end of one instalment {{and the beginning of the}} next.|$|E
5|$|Built in 1897, it {{is a rare}} {{surviving}} {{example of}} a late Victorian orangery in the Classical style, constructed from ashlar and red brick. It has a seven-bay east/west plan with central entrances and three bays north/south, topped by a fully glazed ironwork hipped-roof. An entablature with protruding horizontal geison sits above Ionic half-column supports and corner pilasters. The centre entrance bay on the west front towards the kitchen garden breaks forward as a portico, with pairs of giant engaged columns and broken pediment with a small oculus. <b>Between</b> <b>each</b> pair of columns are large round-headed windows with Gibbs surrounds and keystones.|$|E
5|$|Cave 2 {{is similar}} to cave 1 in design. The veranda has two pillars and two {{pilaster}}s, a bench <b>between</b> <b>each</b> pillar and pilaster with curtains in the back, which have a rail pattern. Over the pillars rests the rail-patterned rock beam, above which is the ceiling. Parts of the pillars and pilasters are broken. In front over the beam project rock imitations of rafters. A doorway with grooves for a wooden frame, leads into a middle room, with a bench along the left wall. The position of the hall-cell and cell are exchanged with respect to cave 1 design. Each has a bench.|$|E

5|$|During {{the ensuing}} 75 million years, plants evolved {{a range of}} more complex organs – from roots to seeds.

5|$|Elves {{have few}} children, {{as a rule}} (Fëanor and Nerdanel were an exception, conceiving seven sons), and there are {{relatively}} sizeable intervals <b>between</b> <b>each</b> child (but see below for notes on Elvish birth rates in Middle-earth versus in Aman). They are soon preoccupied with other pleasures; their libido wanes and they focus their interests elsewhere, like the arts. Nonetheless, they take great delight in the union of love, and they cherish the days of bearing and raising children as the happiest days of their lives.|$|E
