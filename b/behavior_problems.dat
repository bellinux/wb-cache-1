With age, developing children are able to retain impulsivity but also gain control over their immediate desires and are increasingly able to prolong gratification.

5|$|Breckinridge studied {{education}} at a classical school operated by Dr. Louis Marshall, {{the brother of}} Chief Justice John Marshall, then followed his brothers, Cabell and John, to Princeton in 1817. His <b>behavior</b> <b>problems</b> continued there; in one year, he spent more than $1200. He was suspended for fighting, and although he was later reinstated, the incident soured him on Princeton, and he was granted an honorable release. (The school later awarded him an honorary Master of Arts degree in 1832.) Breckinridge enrolled at Yale University, but after three months, discovered that a one-year residency was required for graduation. Unwilling to complete this requirement, he moved to Union College in Schenectady, New York, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1819.|$|E
5|$|The {{effect of}} lead on children's {{cognitive}} abilities {{takes place at}} very low levels. There is apparently no lower threshold to the dose-response relationship (unlike other heavy metals such as mercury). Reduced academic performance {{has been associated with}} lead exposure even at blood lead levels lower than 5μg/dL. Blood lead levels below 10μg/dL have been reported to be associated with lower IQ and <b>behavior</b> <b>problems</b> such as aggression, in proportion with blood lead levels. Between the blood lead levels of 5 and 35μg/dL, an IQ decrease of 2–4 points for each μg/dL increase is reported in children. However, studies that show associations between low-level lead exposure and health effects in children may be affected by confounding and overestimate the effects of low-level lead exposure.|$|E

40|$|Establishing {{operations}} {{can alter}} <b>problem</b> <b>behaviors</b> {{by changing the}} momentary value of reinforcers associated with those <b>problem</b> <b>behaviors.</b> If establishing operations (EOs) precede the presentation of discriminative stimuli (SDs) for <b>problem</b> <b>behaviors,</b> {{it may be possible}} to introduce neutralizing routines that both reduce the value of reinforcers associated with <b>problem</b> <b>behaviors</b> and decrease the occurrence of <b>problem</b> <b>behaviors.</b> The present study examined this logic with 3 adolescents with severe intellectual disabilities. Initial functional analyses indicated that <b>problem</b> <b>behaviors</b> were motivated by either escape or tangible items. Functional assessment interviews identified possible establishing operations that were associated with the occurrence of <b>problem</b> <b>behavior</b> and indicated that these establishing operations occurred over 1 hr before presentation of the SD for <b>problem</b> <b>behaviors.</b> We used an alternating treatments design to examine <b>problem</b> <b>behaviors</b> during instruction under four conditions: EO + SD, SD only, EO only, and neither SD nor EO. For all 3 participants, <b>problem</b> <b>behaviors</b> occurred almost exclusively during the EO + SD condition.
