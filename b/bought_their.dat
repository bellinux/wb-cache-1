5|$|Firearm tracing {{starts at}} the {{manufacturer}} or importer and typically ends at the first private sale regardless if the private seller later sell to an FFL or uses an FFL for background checks. Analyzing data from a report released in 1997 by the National Institute of Justice, fewer than 2% of convicted criminals <b>bought</b> <b>their</b> firearm {{at a flea market}} or gun show. About 12% purchased their firearm from a retail store or pawnshop, and 80% bought from family, friends, or an illegal source.|$|E
5|$|Greyhound Express routes are {{assigned}} new or refurbished buses that {{are equipped with}} Wi-Fi, power outlets, leather seats, and extra legroom. In many stations Greyhound Express customers {{can take advantage of}} dedicated waiting areas, separate from passengers traveling on other Greyhound services or other carriers. Some stations also board passengers onto Greyhound Express buses using numbers printed on tickets. This number is assigned in the order in which the ticket was purchased, which means that passengers who <b>bought</b> <b>their</b> tickets earlier get to board the bus and choose their seats earlier.|$|E
5|$|Police {{were also}} {{investigating}} whether a copycat element was involved after it emerged that both Saari and Pekka-Eric Auvinen, the gunman in the Jokela school shooting, had <b>bought</b> <b>their</b> guns {{from the same}} store. Both gunmen had taken photographs of themselves in similar poses, and both exchanged videos related to school shootings on YouTube and Finnish social networking site IRC-Galleria. In March 2009, Police ruled out contact with Pekka-Eric Auvinen, {{and said that he}} had committed his crimes alone: 200 people were interviewed during the investigation, none of whom said they knew of Saari's plans.|$|E

5|$|Unlike most artisan cheese makers, Beecher's mainly uses {{pasteurized milk}} and {{operates}} a high-volume modern production facility, with multiple farms supplying milk. When Beecher's encountered problems in guaranteeing the standard {{flavor of the}} milks they were using to make cheese, the company <b>bought</b> <b>their</b> own herds of dairy cattle and farms to ensure control of the cheese products from beginning to end. Beecher's uses various cheese cultures when mixing cheeses, so a cheddar cheese produced by Beecher's may use cultures not normally intended for cheddar cheese production.|$|E
5|$|Mark Whitton founded Whitton's in {{the early}} 1900s {{carrying}} timber with a horse and cart. After World War I the company carried coal to the gas works and local paper mills. In 1923 they <b>bought</b> <b>their</b> first Sentinel steam lorry and carried paper to Bristol, returning with animal feed. During the Second World War they were run by the Ministry of Transport {{and after the war}} were nationalised to become part of British Road Services. The brothers who had owned the company moved back into haulage, setting up a new firm which went into receivership in the 1970s and was then bought by Wild Transport of Exeter in 1973.|$|E
5|$|Sega of America CEO Tom Kalinske wanted {{reassurance}} {{that the character}} would not fail. The global head of marketing, Al Nilsen, became involved, and playtested the game across the United States with Mario fans: they were shown Mario and then played Sonic the Hedgehog. 80 percent preferred Sonic the Hedgehog, and the game was shown at the 1991 Summer Consumer Electronics Show. The game was released in North America on June 23, 1991, and in the PAL regions and Japan the following month. Sega of America packaged it with American Genesis consoles, replacing Altered Beast. This tactic enabled Sega of America to sell 15 million Genesis units. Genesis owners who <b>bought</b> <b>their</b> consoles before the switch could request free copies of Sonic the Hedgehog by mail. Sega of America created a large-scale marketing campaign to promote the game and Sonic as a mascot for the company.|$|E

5|$|The American Smelting and Refining Company (ASARCO) funded Drinker to {{investigate}} the 1948 Donora smog, as the company {{had an interest in}} showing that its primary pollutants (sulfuric acid and sulfur dioxide) had not significantly contributed to the damage it caused. In the middle of 1953, Amdur and her husband developed a method of spraying a combination mist of sulfuric acid and sulfur dioxide into humid chambers containing guinea pigs {{to investigate}} the damage that it would cause to their lungs. Guinea pigs were used as they breathe more deeply through their mouths than smaller rodents which breathe through their noses. The Amdurs <b>bought</b> <b>their</b> own guinea pigs for the mini project, and spent a holiday weekend doing the investigation.|$|E
5|$|The elder Roddenberry {{became a}} patrolman, and held that rank {{for the next}} twenty years. The family {{expanded}} {{with the birth of}} Robert Leon Roddenberry in 1924, and Doris Willodean Roddenberry in 1925. During this time, the Roddenberrys <b>bought</b> <b>their</b> first home at 3243 Drew Street. During Gene's early years, he was saved by a quick thinking milkman who noticed that the house was on fire. He pounded on the door until Glen awoke and rushed out of the house with the children in tow. Roddenberry's father kept rabbits, and the children sold them outside the house. It was these animals that became the subject of Roddenberry's first published work in his school's twice-yearly newspaper, The Ace. During his childhood, Roddenberry was interested in reading, especially pulp magazines, and was a fan of stories such as John Carter of Mars, Tarzan, and the Skylark series by E. E. Smith.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} adults owning shares rose from 7 per cent to 25 per cent during her tenure, {{and more than a}} million {{families}} <b>bought</b> <b>their</b> council houses, giving an increase from 55 per cent to 67 per cent in owner occupiers from 1979 to 1990. The houses were sold at a discount of 33–55 per cent, leading to large profits for some new owners. Personal wealth rose by 80 per cent in real terms during the 1980s, mainly due to rising house prices and increased earnings. Shares in the privatised utilities were sold below their market value to ensure quick and wide sales, rather than maximise national income.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the deaths}} of two further partners, Backhouse in 1879 and Turnbull in 1880, Storey <b>bought</b> <b>their</b> shares to become the Echos chief proprietor. A year later, in 1881, he met Scottish-born millionaire Andrew Carnegie, and formed a {{syndicate}} with him to set up new newspapers and buy up others. Among those purchased were the Wolverhampton Express and Star, the Northern Daily Mail in Hartlepool and the Portsmouth Evening News. An attempt to buy the Shields Gazette, the country's oldest daily newspaper, failed. The syndicate finally broke up in 1885, with Storey retaining control of the Echo, Hampshire Telegraph, Portsmouth News and the Northern Daily Mail. These papers {{formed the basis of}} a new company, Portsmouth and Sunderland Newspapers Ltd, formed in the 1930s. The 19th century ended with the rivalry between the Echo and the Sunderland Daily Post intensifying. The Silksworth Colliery strike of 1891 pitted the two papers against each other, with the Post attacking Storey for having exploited the strike for political gain. Storey successfully sued for libel.|$|E
5|$|The Simpsons uses a {{floating}} timeline {{in which the}} characters do not physically age, and as such the show {{is assumed to be}} set in the current year. In several episodes, events have been linked to specific times, though sometimes this timeline has been contradicted in subsequent episodes. Maggie is the youngest child of Marge and Homer, and sister to Bart and Lisa. When Marge became pregnant with Bart, she and Homer got married at a chapel in Las Vegas. To support his impending family, Homer all but demanded a job at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, impressing its owner, Mr. Burns, with his aggressive submissiveness. When Marge became pregnant with Lisa, two years later, she and Homer <b>bought</b> <b>their</b> first house. Another six years later, Homer felt financially secure enough to finally quit his job at the Power Plant and take his dream job at Barney's Bowlarama. However, Marge became pregnant with Maggie, so Homer, once again unable to support his family, was forced to reapply for his old job. By the time Maggie was born, Homer had shown great signs of distress, but he managed to find motivation in the form of his newborn baby girl.|$|E
