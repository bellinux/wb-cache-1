5|$|Oklahoma has {{teams in}} several minor leagues, {{including}} Minor League Baseball at the AAA and AA levels (Oklahoma City Dodgers and Tulsa Drillers, respectively), hockey's ECHL with the Tulsa Oilers, {{and a number}} of indoor football leagues. In the last-named sport, the state's most notable team was the Tulsa Talons, which played in the Arena Football League until 2012, when the team was moved to San Antonio. The Oklahoma Defenders replaced the Talons as Tulsa's only professional arena football team, playing the CPIFL. The Oklahoma City <b>Blue,</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> NBA G League, relocated to Oklahoma City from Tulsa in 2014, where they were formerly known as the Tulsa 66ers. Tulsa is the base for the Tulsa Revolution, which plays in the American Indoor Soccer League. Enid and Lawton host professional basketball teams in the USBL and the CBA.|$|E

25|$|Kray {{was one of}} {{the best}} representatives of the old Austrian army.

25|$|Legend {{has it that}} in 1906, Boca played Nottingham de Almagro. Both teams wore {{so similar}} shirts that the match was played to decide which team would get to keep it. Boca lost, and decided to adopt {{the colors of the}} flag of the first boat to sail into the port at La Boca. This proved to be a Swedish ship, {{therefore}} the yellow and <b>blue</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Swedish flag were adopted as the new team colours. The first version had a yellow diagonal band, which was later changed to a horizontal stripe.|$|E
25|$|The invisibility {{effect was}} {{achieved}} by having someone wearing a bright red suit (because it was the farthest opposite of the green of the jungle and the <b>blue</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sky) {{the size of the}} Predator. The red was removed with chroma key techniques, leaving an empty area. The take was then repeated without the actors using a 30% wider lens on the camera. When the two takes were combined optically, the jungle from the second take filled in the empty area. Because the second take was filmed with a wider lens, a vague outline of the alien could be seen with the background scenery bending around its shape.|$|E

25|$|Seurat uses {{a variety}} of means to suggest the baking heat of a summer’s day at the riverside. A hot haze softens {{the edges of the}} trees in the middle-distance and washes out colour from the bridges and {{factories}} in the background—the <b>blue</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sky at the horizon is paled almost to whiteness. A shimmering appearance at the surface of Bathers at Asnières subtly reinforces this saturating heat and sunlight. Writing about these effects, the art historian Roger Fry reported his view that, “no one could render this enveloping with a more exquisitely tremulous sensibility, a more penetrating observation or more unfailing consistency, than Seurat”.|$|E
25|$|In {{international}} association football, blue is {{a common}} colour on kits, as a majority of nations wear the colours of their national flag. A notable exception is four-time FIFA World Cup winners Italy, who wear a blue kit based on the Azzuro Savoia (Savoy <b>blue)</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> royal House of Savoy which unified the Italian states. The team themselves are known as Gli Azzurri (the Blues). Another World Cup winning nation with a blue shirt is France, who are known as Les Bleus (the Blues). Two neighbouring countries with two World Cup victories each, Argentina and Uruguay wear a light blue shirt, the former with white stripes. Uruguay are known as the La Celeste, Spanish for 'the sky blue one', while Argentina are known as Los Albicelestes, Spanish for 'the sky blue and whites'.|$|E
25|$|This {{method of}} diving is {{commonly}} used in Philippines waters for pa-aling fishing, which is fishing with big nets on coral reef areas where a surface-dragged net would snag on coral; the compressor air hoses are also {{used to make a}} curtain of bubbles to corral and herd the fish into the nets, since muro-ami fishing was stopped in the area. At least one pa-aling fishing fleet has been found and arrested in a protected fishery area. Compressor diving was shown, and so called, used for pa-aling fishing, in episode 1 (Oceans: Into the <b>Blue)</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> BBC television series Human Planet. The cameramen used ordinary scuba gear, but one of them had a trial-dive with the crew's compressor-diving gear.|$|E

25|$|The Indian Navy from 1950 to 2001 used a {{modified}} version of the British Naval jack, with the Union flag replaced with the Indian Tricolor in the canton. In 2001, this flag was replaced with a white ensign bearing the Indian Navy crest, as the previous ensign was thought to reflect India's colonial past. However complaints arose that the new ensign was indistinguishable as the <b>blue</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> naval crest easily merged with the sky and the ocean. Hence in 2004, the ensign was changed back to the St. George's cross design, with the addition of the emblem of India in the intersection of the cross. In 2014, the ensign as well as the naval crest was further modified to include the Devanagari script: सत्यमेव जयते (Satyameva Jayate) which means 'Truth Alone Triumphs' in Sanskrit.|$|E
25|$|But {{with these}} {{potential}} hazards, Clayton and Bell consistently turned out windows {{in which the}} balance of colour is eminently satisfying to the eye. They had the happy knack of selecting exactly the right tonal values so that difficult colour combinations, (such as red and green laid side by side as the cloth and lining of a cloak) appear inevitable. Moreover, their colour choices are rarely timid. (A “safe” choice is to line every cloak with yellow {{in the form of}} an applied silver-stain.) Although most of the colours in their windows are primaries- basic red, yellow and blue with a mid-tone grassy green, they introduced judiciously placed tertiary colours such as russet, brownish purple and a sort of mustard colour. The mustard colour often appears in conjunction with a bright intense blue. They frequently clothed a central figure in a robe of this bright blue, in contrast to the dark <b>blue</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> background and the bright red of surrounding robes.|$|E
25|$|Les Baigneuses is an oil {{painting}} on canvas with dimensions 105 x 171cm (41.3 by 67.3 inches), signed Albert Gleizes and dated 1912, lower left. This work, painted {{at the outset}} of 1912, represents a series of naked elegant women at various points in the landscape foreground, their reflections along with the <b>blue</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sky echoing off the water at the lower edge of the canvas. Beyond the bathers can be observed protruding rock-like formations or boulders—with highlights of primary color—that appear to espouse elements of the foreground. Above these cliffs are found several deciduous woody plants of the genus Populus. Though native to many areas of the Northern Hemisphere, the Poplar, with its fastigiate branches tapered towards the top, is especially iconic of the western suburbs of Paris (la banlieue ouest) where Gleizes lived, 24 Avenue Gambetta, Courbevoie. The Gleizes family moved to Avenue Gambetta in 1887. Towards the end of the 19th century and extending through the early 20th century, Courbevoie witnessed a rapid growth in population, and a surge in the development of crafts, industry and transport (including rail). Of course, such a scene of naked bathers would have been unthinkable in Courbevoie, or anywhere else near the Parisian capital.|$|E

500|$|Ellis {{worked on}} his changeup for the [...] season. He was rewarded by being named the Pirates' Opening Day {{starting}} pitcher; he defeated the Philadelphia Phillies by a score of 4-2. After a strong start to the 1971 season, posting a 13–3 win-loss record, Ellis was named {{to appear in the}} 1971 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, held at Tiger Stadium in Detroit. The AL selected Vida <b>Blue</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Oakland Athletics as their starter, and Ellis publicly stated that National League All-Star Team manager Sparky Anderson would [...] "never start two brothers against each other". Anderson surprised Ellis by naming him the starting pitcher of the All-Star Game. Ellis was the losing pitcher in the game. During the game, Reggie Jackson hit a towering home run off of Ellis. The home run, estimated to have traveled , tied a 1926 home run hit by Babe Ruth for the longest measured home run on record. The next time the two opposed each other, Ellis beaned Jackson in the face in retaliation for his earlier home run.|$|E
