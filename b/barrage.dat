5|$|Once the {{infantry}} {{had reached the}} German trenches, the artillery shifted from the creeping <b>barrage</b> to the standing <b>barrage,</b> a static <b>barrage</b> that would protect {{the infantry}} from counter-attack while they consolidated the position. A variant was the box <b>barrage,</b> in which three or four barrages formed a box—or more often three sides of a box—around a position to isolate and prevent reinforcements being brought up into the front line. This was normally used to protect trench raids, although {{it could also be}} used offensively against a German unit. Another type of <b>barrage</b> was the SOS <b>barrage,</b> fired in response to a German counterattack. An SOS <b>barrage</b> could be brought down by firing a flare signal of a pre arranged colour, as a German <b>barrage</b> tended to cut the telephone lines. A pre-registered <b>barrage</b> would then descend on No Man's Land.|$|E

5|$|At 21:00 {{the first}} shells of what {{proved to be}} a two-hour North Korean {{artillery}} and mortar preparation against the American river positions of 2nd Platoon. As the <b>barrage</b> rolled on, North Korean infantry crossed the river and climbed the hills in the darkness under cover of its fire. At 23:00 the <b>barrage</b> lifted and the North Koreans attacked 2nd Platoon, forcing it from the hill after a short fight. Similar assaults took place elsewhere along the battalion outpost line.|$|E

40|$|New <b>Barrages</b> are {{currently}} under construction at Naga Hammadi {{in order to}} replace the Old Naga Hammadi <b>Barrages</b> located at 359 Km downstream Aswan High Dam. The new <b>barrages</b> provide hydropower generation in addition to enhancing the irrigation and navigational conditions already provided by the old <b>barrages.</b> The new <b>Barrages</b> are located downstream the old ones at El Dom island in a curved river reach. A flood flow of 7000 m 3 /s (about 605 Million m 3 /day) is considered as the maximum flood flow at the New Naga Hammdi <b>Barrages</b> and the maximum flood level upstream of the New <b>Barrages</b> is designated as (67. 05) m while the normal water level is (65. 9) m. The bed levels may reach a minimum value of (52. 0) m which may lead to bank heights {{in the order of}} 15. 0 m. Indeed such high bank height needs special considerations in order to ensure full bank stability. Therefore, utilization is made to the WAVES two-dimensional (2 D) numerical model, Hafez 2004, for predicting the velocity, water depth and extracting the conditions needed for bank stability analyses. The hydrodynamic analysis of the curved river reach between the Old and New Naga Hammadi <b>Barrages</b> using the WAVES- 2 D Model revealed that critical water depths up to 17. 0 m and velocities up to 1. 55 m/s exist at the vicinity of the left bank...|$|R

5|$|The 1917 Battle of the Strait of Otranto was {{the result}} of an Austro-Hungarian raid on the Otranto <b>Barrage,</b> an Allied naval {{blockade}} of the Strait of Otranto. The battle took place on 14–15 May 1917, and was the largest surface action in the Adriatic Sea during World War I. The Otranto <b>Barrage</b> was a fixed barrier, composed of lightly armed drifters with anti-submarine nets coupled with minefields and supported by Allied naval patrols.|$|E
5|$|The Austrians briefly {{took the}} {{advantage}} {{when they moved}} a battery from the ridge north of the village to cover their infantry; the fire from the battery allowed the infantry to deploy {{at right angles to}} their original front. Frederick responded by ordering the last of his reserved left wing to advance, but the Austrian battery drove it back. Finally, Frederick's heavy cannons on the Butterberg, a small knoll to the west of town, laid down a <b>barrage.</b> Some participants said it was this <b>barrage,</b> more than the Prussian infantry, which won the battle.|$|E
50|$|Proposals for damming or <b>barraging</b> the Severn Estuary (and Bristol Channel) {{have existed}} since the 19th century for reasons such as {{transport}} links and flood protection.

5|$|The Bulgarian {{high command}} {{did not attempt}} to perform a spoiling attack as they lacked the {{necessary}} vehicles and pack animals. The <b>barrage</b> did not cause a significant number of casualties but severely affected the Bulgarian esprit de corps. On the night between 14 and 15 September, Franco-Serbian patrols reported that the artillery <b>barrage</b> had dealt sufficient damage to the barbed wire entanglements separating the trenches.|$|E
5|$|The {{immediate}} {{response of the}} British was a two-hour cannon <b>barrage</b> at the heights, which had no effect because the British guns could not reach the American guns at such height. After {{the failure of the}} <b>barrage,</b> Howe and his officers agreed that the colonists must be removed from the heights if they were to hold Boston. They planned an assault on the heights; however, due to a storm the attack never took place, and the British elected instead to withdraw.|$|E

5|$|To keep enemy {{action to}} a minimum during the assault, a {{creeping}} <b>barrage</b> was planned. This required gunners to create a curtain of high explosive and shrapnel shell explosions that crept across the battlefield in lines, about one hundred metres {{in advance of the}} assaulting troops. The Allies had previously used creeping barrages at the battles of Neuve Chapelle and the Somme but had encountered two technical problems. The first was accurately synchronising the movement of the troops to the fall of the barrage: for Arras, this was overcome by rehearsal and strict scheduling. The second was the <b>barrage</b> falling erratically as the barrels of heavy guns wore swiftly but at differing rates during fire: for Arras, the rate of wear of each gun barrel was calculated and calibrated accordingly. While there was a risk of friendly fire, the creeping <b>barrage</b> forced the Germans to remain in their shelters, allowing Allied soldiers to advance without fear of machine gun fire. The new instantaneous No. 106 Fuze had been adapted from a French design for high-explosive shells so that they detonated on the slightest impact, vaporising barbed wire. Poison gas shells were used for the final minutes of the <b>barrage.</b>|$|E
5|$|Various {{proposals}} {{have been put}} forward to construct a Severn <b>Barrage</b> for tidal electricity production from Brean Down to Lavernock Point in south Wales. The proposals, which go back over 100 years, have never been successful so far, however Peter Hain and others are still working on further proposals and trying to persuade the government to fund either the <b>barrage</b> or tidal lagoons.|$|E
5|$|With {{his newly}} {{acquired}} flotillas, the Flanders Flotilla′s commander - Admiral Ludwig von Schröder - decided {{to launch a}} raid in the Dover Strait against the Dover <b>Barrage</b> {{as well as any}} Allied shipping that could be found in the Channel. Although the British had prohibited transports from being in the Channel at night in anticipation of a German raid, the Dover <b>Barrage</b> was not prepared to meet such an attack. Facing Schröder′s 23 boats, the Dover <b>Barrage</b> was guarded by only the old destroyer , the yacht Ombra, and the naval trawler H. E. Straud. The four divisions of drifters manning the barrage′s anti-submarine nets were armed with only a single rifle each for defence. In addition to the forces guarding the <b>Barrage,</b> there were six Tribal-class destroyers at Dover that could be called upon {{in the event of a}} raid as well as several units of Harwich Force dispersed at the Downs.|$|E

5|$|At 0730 the 44th (Lowland) Infantry Brigade and the 46th (Highland) Infantry Brigade of the 15th (Scottish) Infantry Division, {{supported}} by the 31st Tank Brigade moved off their start lines behind a rolling <b>barrage</b> fired from 344 guns. The 46th Brigade initially advanced without armoured support, because in bypassing the mine and booby trap-ridden village of Le Mesnil-Patry, its tanks were forced to negotiate minefields flanking the village. The 2nd Battalion, Glasgow Highlanders faced only light resistance, while the 9th Battalion The Cameronians, ran into the grenadiers of the 12th SS Panzer Division, who had allowed the <b>barrage</b> to pass over their positions before opening fire. Reuniting with their tanks at around 1000, by midday the two battalions were fighting for control of their initial objectives; Cheux and Le Haut du Bosq.|$|E

5|$|Hart {{was made}} {{commander}} of the 2nd Infantry Brigade when the 4th Brigade was disbanded in February 1918. He was mentioned in despatches for his work with the 4th Infantry Brigade while {{it was on the}} front line. His new brigade absorbed many of the soldiers of his previous command. However, on 18 February, just two weeks after taking command, he was badly gassed during an artillery <b>barrage</b> on his headquarters. The <b>barrage,</b> using a mixture of high explosive and mustard gas shells, also incapacitated most of his staff. Temporarily blinded, he was evacuated to a hospital in the rear and then to Étaples. After recovering his sight, which took about a week, he was dispatched to the south of France to convalesce.|$|E
