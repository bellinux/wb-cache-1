5000|$|Blank {{would often}} ask Herzog to repeat {{statements}} while being filmed that he originally made off-camera. In a 2009 interview with Jesse Pearson for Vice <b>magazine,</b> <b>Blank</b> {{was asked to}} recall a scene in the documentary showing Herzog delivering a monologue about the violence and destruction of the jungle around him. Blank says that the scene originally {{took place in the}} middle of a canoe ride, away from cameras, but he liked the speech enough to coax it out of Herzog again. [...] "When the moment was right," [...] Blank told Vice, [...] "I pulled him aside and said, 'Can I do a little interview?' And he said, 'Sure.' Goodwin led him around to something that sparked him off on that tangent again. That's how we got the speech." ...|$|R
50|$|Magazines issued {{with the}} L85A1 were aluminium, {{and not very}} robust. There are now three types of {{magazine}} issued with the L85A2, the most recent being the plastic Magpul EMAG purchased as an Urgent Operational Requirement (UOR), {{the other two are}} of steel construction with a stainless steel follower. The main variant is for live ammunition, and the other is exclusively used for blank ammunition. The blank variant is identified by yellow stripes on the magazine, and is designed to prevent the loading of live rounds. As blank rounds are shorter than live rounds, live rounds will not physically fit into the <b>blank</b> <b>magazine.</b> Blank rounds will fit into the normal magazine, but their slightly shorter length creates problems with jamming.|$|E
5000|$|Multispindle lathes {{have more}} than one spindle and {{automated}} control (whether via cams or CNC). They are production machines specializing in high-volume production. The smaller types are usually called screw machines, while the larger variants are usually called automatic chucking machines, automatic chuckers, or simply chuckers. Screw machines usually work from bar stock, while chuckers automatically chuck up individual <b>blanks</b> from a <b>magazine.</b> Typical minimum profitable production lot size on a screw machine is in the thousands of parts due to the large setup time. Once set up, a screw machine can rapidly and efficiently produce thousands of parts on a continuous basis with high accuracy, low cycle time, and very little human intervention. (The latter two points drive down the unit cost per interchangeable part much lower than could be achieved without these machines.) ...|$|R
