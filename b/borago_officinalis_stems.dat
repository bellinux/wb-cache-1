50|$|Some {{flowers are}} safe to eat only {{in small amounts}}. Apple flowers (Malus spp.) contain cyanide {{precursors}} and Johnny jump-ups (Viola tricolor) contain saponins. Borage (<b>Borago</b> <b>officinalis)</b> and daylily (Hemerocallis spp.) flowers are diuretics and sweet woodruff (Galium odoratum) can have blood-thinning effects. The flowers of linden trees (Tilia spp.) are reportedly safe in small amounts but heavy consumption can cause heart damage. Marigolds (Tagetes spp.) can be harmful in large amounts, and only certain species have an appealing flavor.|$|R
50|$|<b>Borago</b> <b>officinalis</b> is used medicinally, in {{companion}} planting, {{in cooking}} {{and as an}} oilseed. Cooked stalks are sometimes eaten as a vegetable. The large, hairy leaves taste mildly of cucumber, and star-shaped purple-blue flower are prized for their flavour. The leaves are often added to teas and salads, and the flowers {{have been added to}} wine (Borage has had a reputation to give one courage since Roman times). The flowers are highly attractive to bees. The hairs covering the plant are said to repel herbivores.|$|R
40|$|Several non-legume {{species have}} been tested for their {{suitability}} as cover crops, especially as constituent of mixtures with common vetch (Vicia sativa) and subterranean clover (Trifolium subterrananeum) in field trials performed in southern Germany from 2013 to 2016.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study is to compare changes in the total phenolic, {{flavonoid}} and reducing sugar content and antioxidant activity of alcoholic extracts of Oenothera biennis, <b>Borago</b> <b>officinalis</b> and Nigella sativa oilseed cakes before and after enzymatic hydrolysis. Extraction with ethanol and hydrolysis with different commercially available glycosidases: α-amylase, β-glucosidase, β-glucanase and their combinations in a ratio of 1 : 1 : 1 were investigated. Total phenolic, flavonoid and reducing sugar content, iron-chelating activity and antioxidant activity according to DPPH and ABTS tests were measured in non-hydrolysed extracts and compared with the results obtained for the extracts after the application of immobilised enzymes. As a result, the hydrolysed extracts had a higher phenolic and reducing sugar content as well as higher iron-chelating and antioxidant activities. Total phenolic content of Oenothera biennis, <b>Borago</b> <b>officinalis</b> and Nigella sativa oilseed cake extracts after enzymatic hydrolysis was higher in comparison with non-hydrolysed extracts, i. e. 2 times (for the enzyme combination), and 1. 5 and 2 times (for β-glucanase) (p< 0. 05), respectively. The best results in increasing the flavonoid and sugar content as well as in iron-chelating activity were obtained after enzymatic hydrolysis of oilseed cake extracts by β-glucanase. Oilseed cake extracts after hydrolysis with an enzyme combination in a ratio of 1 : 1 : 1 had the highest increase in antioxidant activity...|$|R
5000|$|Borage ( [...] , <b>Borago</b> <b>officinalis),</b> {{also known}} as a starflower, is an annual herb in the {{flowering}} plant family Boraginaceae. It is native to the Mediterranean region and has naturalized in many other locales. It grows satisfactorily in gardens in the UK climate, remaining in the garden from year to year by self-seeding. The leaves are edible and the plant is grown in gardens for that purpose in some parts of Europe. The plant is also commercially cultivated for borage seed oil extracted from its seeds. The plant contains pyrrolizidine alkaloids, some of which are hepatotoxic, mutagenic and carcinogenic (see below under Phytochemistry).|$|R

50|$|<b>Borago</b> <b>officinalis</b> {{grows to}} {{a height of}} 60 - 100 cm, and is bristly or hairy all over the stems and leaves; the leaves are alternate, simple, and 5 - 15 cm long. The flowers are complete, perfect with five narrow, triangular-pointed petals. Flowers are most often blue, {{although}} pink flowers are sometimes observed. White flowered types are also cultivated. The blue flower is genetically dominant over the white flower. The flowers arise along scorpioid cymes to form large floral displays with multiple flowers blooming simultaneously, suggesting that borage has {{a high degree of}} geitonogamy (intra-plant pollination). It has an indeterminate growth habit which may lead to prolific spreading. In temperate climate such as in the UK, its flowering season is relatively long, from June to September. In milder climates, borage will bloom continuously for most of the year.|$|R
