5|$|Dissolving praseodymium(IV) {{compounds}} in water results in solutions containing the yellow Pr4+ ions; <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>high</b> positive standard reduction {{potential of the}} Pr4+/Pr3+ couple at +3.2V, these ions are unstable in aqueous solution, oxidising water and being reduced to Pr3+. The value for the Pr3+/Pr couple is −2.35V.|$|E

5|$|Analgesics may {{be needed}} for the {{abdominal}} and joint pains. It is uncertain as to whether HSP needs treatment beyond controlling the symptoms. Most patients do not receive therapy <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>high</b> spontaneous recovery rate. Steroids are generally avoided. However, if they are given early in the disease episode, the duration of symptoms may be shortened, and abdominal pain can improve significantly. Moreover, the chance of severe kidney problems may be reduced. A systematic review of randomized clinical trials {{did not find any}} evidence that steroid treatment (prednisone) is effective at decreasing the likelihood of developing long-term kidney disease.|$|E
5|$|At {{the outset}} of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, {{in the second half of}} the 16th century, Poland–Lithuania became an {{elective}} monarchy, in which the king was elected by the hereditary nobility. This king would serve as the monarch until he died, at which time the country would have another election. This monarchy has been commonly referred to as a rzeczpospolita or republic, <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>high</b> degree of influence wielded by the noble classes, often seen as a single non-homogenous class.|$|E

It was in Sculptor from 1876 until 1929 and Phoenix from roughly 1840 until 1875. In 2036 it will enter Pisces and stay there until 2065, when it will enter Aries. It will then move into the northern sky, entering Perseus in 2128 and Camelopardalis (where it will reach its northernmost declination) in 2173.|$|E

5|$|<b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>high</b> {{reactivity}} of the metal, toxicological {{data are available}} only for compounds. Water-soluble barium compounds are poisonous. In low doses, barium ions act as a muscle stimulant, and higher doses affect the nervous system, causing cardiac irregularities, tremors, weakness, anxiety, shortness of breath, and paralysis. This toxicity {{may be caused by}} Ba2+ blocking potassium ion channels, which are critical to the proper function of the nervous system. Other organs damaged by water-soluble barium compounds (i.e., barium ions) are the eyes, immune system, heart, respiratory system, and skin causing, for example, blindness and sensitization.|$|E
5|$|<b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>high</b> {{toxicity}} of mercury, both the mining of cinnabar and refining for mercury are hazardous and historic causes of mercury poisoning. In China, prison labor {{was used by}} a private mining company {{as recently as the}} 1950s to develop new cinnabar mines. Thousands of prisoners were used by the Luo Xi mining company to establish new tunnels. Worker health in functioning mines is at high risk.|$|E
5|$|Beryllium is non-magnetic. Therefore, tools {{fabricated}} out of beryllium-based {{materials are}} used by naval or military explosive ordnance disposal teams for work on or near naval mines, since these mines commonly have magnetic fuzes. They are also found in maintenance and construction materials near magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machines <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>high</b> magnetic fields generated. In the fields of radio communications and powerful (usually military) radars, hand tools made of beryllium are used to tune the highly magnetic klystrons, magnetrons, traveling wave tubes, etc., that are used for generating high levels of microwave power in the transmitters.|$|E

30|$|The {{positive}} connection between unemployment and NPLs is consistent (Bofondi and Ropele; 2011), {{which suggests that}} seasonal employment or low-income borrowers have <b>higher</b> default rates <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>higher</b> risk <b>of</b> unemployment and consequently an inability to repay their loan obligations.|$|R
50|$|<b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>higher</b> amount <b>of</b> points awarded per game, {{the game}} is played until one team has 21 points, rather than 11. Sometimes a team that manages to capture all 10 coins in a single round wins the game immediately.|$|R
5|$|In 1972, Norsk Flytjeneste {{purchased}} two 50-passenger Douglas DC-6Bs from Braathens SAFE and leased {{one from}} Sterling Airways. They {{were used for}} domestic and international charter. The largest contract was from the Norwegian Church Aid, who contracted Norsk Flytjeneste to fly aid to Bangladesh. However, the airline failed to make money on the DC-6s, mostly <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>high</b> operating costs, and sold them after a year. The company followed up with purchasing a ten-seat Cessna Citation business jet that they offered in the charter market. However, the market was not large enough, and the jet was sold.|$|E
5|$|Less than a {{month after}} Pauline, Hurricane Rick struck the same general region, which brought {{additional}} rainfall and hampered relief efforts. Compared to Pauline, however, damage was minimal. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>high</b> death tolls and the extent of damage in Mexico, The name Pauline was retired in the spring of 1998 by the World Meteorological Organization and will never again be used for a Pacific hurricane. It was replaced by Patricia in the 2003 season.|$|E
5|$|Many organosodium {{compounds}} {{have been}} prepared. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>high</b> polarity of the C-Na bonds, they behave like sources of carbanions (salts with organic anions). Some well known derivatives include sodium cyclopentadienide (NaC5H5) and trityl sodium ((C6H5)3CNa). Because {{of the large}} size and very low polarising power of the Na+ cation, it can stabilize large, aromatic, polarisable radical anions, such as in sodium naphthalenide, Na+−, a strong reducing agent.|$|E

5|$|On 4 October, John II Casimir stormed Łęczyca in Greater Poland {{before heading}} for Royal Prussia, and on 8 October, Wincenty Korwin Gosiewski with 12,000 to 13,000 Lithuanian and Crimean Tartar cavalry overran a Brandenburgian-Swedish {{force in the}} Battle of Prostken in Ducal Prussia. Gosiewski then ravaged Ducal Prussia, burning 13 towns and 250 villages, in a {{campaign}} that entered folklore <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>high</b> death toll and {{the high number of}} captives deported to the Crimea.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the guns}} seen in the film and on the film's poster was an AMT Longslide pistol {{modified}} by Ed Reynolds from SureFire to include a laser sight. Both non-functioning and functioning versions of the prop were created. At the time the movie was made, diode lasers were not available; <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>high</b> power requirement, the helium–neon laser in the sight used an external power supply that Schwarzenegger had to activate manually. Reynolds states that his only compensation for the project was promotional material for the film.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{helicopters}} {{was bought by}} Widerøe in December 1976 and the operations were subcontracted to Offshore Helicopters. The second Sikorsky was bought from Helilift in March 1978 and also operated by Offshore Helicopters. Helikopter Service merged with Offshore Helicopters in 1980, and the new Helikopter Service took over the route. They introduced an eleven-seat Bell 212 helicopters from 1 January 1982 <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>high</b> maintenance costs of the S-58Ts. In 1982 the service to both islands handled 7,145 passengers and three tonnes of post and cargo, and made 744 landings. It received subsidies for NOK4 million.|$|E

50|$|For {{underground}} mines, rehabilitation is {{not always}} a significant problem or cost. This is <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>higher</b> grade <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ore and lower volumes of waste rock and tailings. In some situations, stopes are backfilled with concrete slurry using waste, so that minimal waste is left at surface.|$|R
25|$|Women with a {{multiple}} pregnancy are usually seen more regularly by midwives or doctors {{than those with}} singleton pregnancies <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>higher</b> risks <b>of</b> complications.
