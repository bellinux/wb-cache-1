5|$|Chris Stamper {{was born}} in 1958. He had a long-standing {{interest}} in electronics, and built an oscilloscope in his youth. While at university, he built a kit computer with an 8-bit processor and taught himself how to program by creating traffic light signalling software. He attended Loughborough University of Technology {{with the intent of}} earning degrees in electronics and physics, but left the university in 1981 to pursue computer programming full-time. Chris worked with arcade machine electronics, resolving software bugs and converting Space Invaders into Galaxian machines. He persuaded his brother Tim, two years younger (b. February 1961) to join him. The brothers worked as game designers at the arcade game company Associated Leisure with a college friend, John Lathbury. They followed the company's director when he started his own business, Zilec Electronics, which worked on arcade conversions. They worked on 12 arcade games, including Gyruss and <b>Blue</b> <b>Print,</b> and others whose names were kept secret and sold to other arcade manufacturers, including Konami and Sega. The job included international travel to Japan, where the brothers became acquainted with the Japanese game industry. During this time, Chris purchased, studied, and taught himself to program the new ZX80 processor within two years.|$|E

500|$|The ANAK Society {{played a}} major role in {{establishing}} several of Georgia Tech's most active student organizations, including two student publications and the student government. The society's existence was formally announced in the first edition of the <b>Blue</b> <b>Print</b> in 1908. Four ANAK charter members served on the first <b>Blue</b> <b>Print</b> editorial board. By 1911, ANAK admitted four more 1908 <b>Blue</b> <b>Print</b> editors into the society, including Editor-in-Chief John G. Chapman. These close relationships enabled the society to assert a great deal of control over the yearbook's direction in future decades. Along with several other clubs and societies, ANAK listed its membership roster and provided a group photograph in the yearbook.|$|E

500|$|The ANAK Society {{explained}} {{its name}} as originating from {{a passage in}} the Book of Numbers, one of the books of the Hebrew Bible. The passage, attributed to , reads, [...] "And there were the Nephilin, the sons of ANAK, who came of the giants: {{and we were in}} our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight." [...] Anak was a biblical figure said to be the forefather of the Nephilim, a race of giants. For unknown reasons, the society's name has sustained minor alterations over the years, from Anak in the 1908 <b>Blue</b> <b>Print,</b> the first edition of Georgia Tech's yearbook, to ANAK in recent editions of The Technique, Georgia Tech's student newspaper.|$|E
500|$|The {{words to}} Georgia Tech's famous fight song, [...] "Ramblin' Wreck from Georgia Tech", {{are said to}} have come from an early {{baseball}} game against rival Georgia. Some sources credit Billy Walthall, a member of the first four-year graduating class, with the lyrics. According to a 1954 article in Sports Illustrated, [...] "Ramblin' Wreck" [...] was written around 1893 by a Tech football player on his way to an Auburn game. In 1905, Georgia Tech adopted it in roughly the current form as its official fight song, although it had apparently been the unofficial fight song for several years. It was published {{for the first time in}} the school's first yearbook, the 1908 <b>Blue</b> <b>Print,</b> under the heading [...] "What causes Whitlock to Blush." [...] Words such as [...] "hell" [...] and [...] "helluva" [...] were censored in this first printing as [...] "certain words [...] too hot to print." [...] After Michael A. Greenblatt, the first bandmaster of the Georgia Tech Marching Band, heard the band playing the song to the tune of Charles Ives's [...] "A Son of a Gambolier", he wrote a modern musical version. In 1911, Frank Roman succeeded Greenblatt as bandmaster; Roman embellished the song with trumpet flourishes and publicized it. Roman copyrighted the song in 1919.|$|E

The recipe to this tricky {{combination of the}} limited federalisation, greatly lies on mutualisation for limiting the fiscal integration. In order for overindebted countries to stabilise the dwindling euro and economy, the overindebted countries require [...] "access to money and for banks to have a [...] "safe" [...] euro-wide class of assets that is not tied to the fortunes of one country" [...] which could be obtained by [...] "narrower Eurobond that mutualises {{a limited amount of}} debt for a limited amount of time". The proposition made by German Council of Economic Experts provides detailed <b>blue</b> <b>print</b> to mutualise the current debts of all euro-zone economies above 60% of their GDP. Instead of the break-up and issuing new national governments bonds by individual euro-zone governments, [...] "everybody, from Germany (debt: 81% of GDP) to Italy (120%) would issue only these joint bonds until their national debts fell to the 60% threshold. The new mutualised-bond market, worth some €2.3 trillion, would be paid off over the next 25 years. Each country would pledge a specified tax (such as a VAT surcharge) to provide the cash." [...] So far, German Chancellor Angela Merkel has opposed all forms of mutualisation.|$|E
