5|$|Final Damnation: Finally, {{those who}} persist in {{living in a}} state of mortal sin and do not repent <b>before</b> <b>death</b> subject {{themselves}} to hell, an everlasting separation from God. The Church teaches that no one is condemned to hell without having freely decided to reject God. No one is predestined to hell and no one can determine with absolute certainty who has been condemned to hell. Catholicism teaches that through God's mercy a person can repent at any point <b>before</b> <b>death,</b> be illuminated with the truth of the Catholic faith, and thus obtain salvation. Some Catholic theologians have speculated that the souls of unbaptised infants and non-Christians without mortal sin but who die in original sin are assigned to limbo, although this is not an official dogma of the Church.|$|E
5|$|Anthropologists {{are also}} able to see other markers present on the bones. Past {{fractures}} will be evident {{by the presence of}} bone remodeling. The examination of any fractures on the bones can potentially help determine cause of death as well by determining if a fracture occurred ante-mortem (<b>before</b> <b>death),</b> peri-mortem (at the time of death), or post-mortem (after death). Ante-mortem fractures will show signs of healing while peri- and post-mortem fractures will not. Peri-mortem fractures will usually appear clean while post-mortem breaks will appear brittle. Diseases such as bone cancer might be present in bone marrow samples and can help narrow down the list of possible identifications.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) medical {{examiners}} identified {{most of the}} bodies within 10 weeks of the accident. Due to extreme impact forces only one body was identifiable by sight. For approximately 100 bodies, the examiners used DNA; the DNA analysis {{has been referred to}} as the largest DNA identification project in Canadian history. About 90 bodies were identified by Canadian {{medical examiners}} using dental records. For around 30 bodies, examiners used fingerprints and ante mortem (<b>before</b> <b>death)</b> X-rays. The large number of ante mortem dental X-rays meant that around 90 bodies had been identified by the end of October. The RCMP contacted relatives of victims to ask for medical histories and dental records. Blood samples from relatives were used in the DNA identification of victims.|$|E
25|$|Skinner {{continued}} {{to write and}} work until just <b>before</b> his <b>death.</b> Just a few days <b>before</b> his <b>death,</b> {{he was given a}} lifetime achievement award by the American Psychological Association, and delivered a 15-minute address concerning his work.|$|R
25|$|Lawrence had a {{long and}} {{successful}} career as a surgeon. He {{reached the top of}} his profession, and just <b>before</b> his <b>death</b> the Queen rewarded him with a baronetcy (see Lawrence baronets) shortly <b>before</b> his <b>death</b> in 1867.|$|R
500|$|The CD {{features}} the characters Mitsuru Kirijo, Akihiko Sanada and Shinjiro Aragaki {{in a side}} story titled [...] "Seaside Vacation <b>before</b> <b>Death’s</b> Scythe" [...] which {{took place during the}} year 2008 and before the events of the film.|$|R
5|$|The {{transformation}} of Hungary into a Christian state {{was one of}} Stephen's principal concerns throughout his reign. Although the Hungarians' conversion had already begun in his father's reign, it was only Stephen who systematically forced his subjects {{to give up their}} pagan rituals. His legislative activity was closely connected with Christianity. For example, his First Book of Laws from the first years of his reign includes several provisions prescribing the observance of feast days and the confession <b>before</b> <b>death.</b> His other laws protected property rights and the interests of widows and orphans, or regulated the status of serfs.|$|E
5|$|Homer {{decides to}} take his family to the new sushi bar, The Happy Sumo. After {{sampling}} most of {{the items on the}} menu, he tries sushi made from fugu. The chef in charge is busy making love with Edna, so his apprentice has to slice the fish, of which certain parts are toxic. He tries to do it carefully, but Homer becomes impatient, only to have it served and become unsure if the poisonous portions have been removed. Homer considers it a treat, but the chef soon returns and believes that the fish has not been prepared correctly and tells Homer that he may have been poisoned. Homer and Marge go to the hospital, where Dr. Hibbert informs Homer that based on a chat he had with the sushi chef, Homer is found out that he has increased likeliness of death and has 22 hours left to live. At night with Marge by his side, he decides not to tell his children about the bad news and makes {{a list of all the}} things he wants to do <b>before</b> <b>death.</b>|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} {{government}} columbaria and 57 private ones. The government-operated columbaria are at Mandai, Yishun and Choa Chu Kang. (A fourth government columbarium at Mount Vernon {{is due to}} close at an unspecified date due to redevelopment of its surrounding area into a public housing estate.) Private columbaria are operated by the Kong Meng San Phor Kark See Monastery, the Roman Catholic Church of Saint Mary of the Angels in Bukit Batok, and the Singapore Soka Association, among others. As with crematoria, {{there is a significant}} price difference between niches in private and government columbaria. A standard niche in any government columbarium costs less than $900, but one at the Kong Meng San monastery costs more than $15,000. The government columbaria allocate niches sequentially, and charge an extra $250 for any location change request; for an extra price, the private columbaria allow families to choose niche locations subject to availability, and even to pre-book niches <b>before</b> <b>death.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Lawrence had a {{long and}} {{successful}} career as a surgeon. He {{reached the top of}} his profession, and just <b>before</b> his <b>death</b> the Queen rewarded him with a baronetcy (see Lawrence baronets) shortly <b>before</b> his <b>death</b> in 1867.|$|R
50|$|For {{several years}} <b>before</b> Oliveira's <b>death,</b> {{a feature film}} called A Igreja do Diabo (The Church of the Devil) was being developed. In an {{interview}} conducted less than five months <b>before</b> Oliveira's <b>death,</b> Oliveira had plans for future films.|$|R
25|$|Mutations causing laminopathies include {{recessive}} {{as well as}} dominant alleles {{with rare}} de novo mutations creating dominant alleles that do not allow their carriers to reproduce <b>before</b> <b>death.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Deuteronomic Code {{is remembered}} by Moses, {{in his last}} speeches <b>before</b> <b>death,</b> both {{covering}} the ground of prior codes, but also further laws not recorded earlier, which Moses has, by this point, remembered.|$|E
25|$|Because artery walls enlarge at {{locations}} with atheroma, detecting atheroma <b>before</b> <b>death</b> and autopsy {{has long}} been problematic at best. Most methods {{have focused on the}} openings of arteries; highly relevant, yet totally miss the atheroma within artery walls.|$|E
50|$|A {{few years}} <b>before</b> his <b>death</b> he visited California. In his old age he had acquired, by several judicious {{business}} investments, a comfortable competency, which he proposed shortly <b>before</b> his <b>death</b> to distribute among the benevolent societies of his church.|$|R
5000|$|Von guten Mächten: [...] "By Gracious Powers," [...] {{a prayer}} he wrote shortly <b>before</b> his <b>death.</b> Also shortly <b>before</b> his <b>death,</b> Bonhoeffer had a severe asthma attack that almost killed him. He was {{executed}} two days later. Various English translations.|$|R
50|$|The {{three kinds}} of Arishta that can strike a person {{at a very young}} age are - a) Balarishta or <b>death</b> <b>before</b> eight years, b) Madhyarishta or <b>death</b> <b>before</b> the age of twenty years and c) Yogarishta or <b>death</b> <b>before</b> thirty-two years.|$|R
25|$|Prosthetics, such as {{artificial}} {{toes and}} eyeballs, were also used; typically, they served {{little more than}} decorative purposes. In preparation for burial, missing body parts would be replaced; however, these do not appear as {{if they would have}} been useful, or even attachable, <b>before</b> <b>death.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{review of}} the medical {{findings}} to date found that he suffered from mild kyphoscoliosis, pes planus (flat feet), hypophalangism of the right foot, bone necrosis of second and third metatarsal bones of the left foot, malaria, and a complex fracture of the right knee shortly <b>before</b> <b>death.</b>|$|E
25|$|The St. Petersburg Times {{contacted}} five {{medical experts}} for their {{opinions about the}} report, and they confirmed Wood's opinion. The Church of Scientology responded that the five doctors should {{have been given the}} entire autopsy report, not just the vitreous fluid tests, which pathologists use to determine the composition of blood at the time <b>before</b> <b>death.</b>|$|E
50|$|One year <b>before</b> his <b>death,</b> Wadlow passed John Rogan as {{the tallest}} person ever. On June 27, 1940 (eighteen days <b>before</b> his <b>death),</b> he was {{measured}} at 8 ft by doctors C. M. Charles and Cyril MacBryde of Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri.|$|R
5000|$|In 2004, Kipping was {{diagnosed}} with a rare form of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, from which he died on April 1, 2007. [...] He continued to play with the Paul James Band until shortly <b>before</b> his <b>death,</b> and was painting until two days <b>before</b> his <b>death.</b>|$|R

25|$|Like all bishops, {{the pope}} has {{the option of}} resigning, though unlike other bishops, it is not required. The best known cases are those of Pope Celestine V in 1294, Pope Gregory XII in 1415 and Pope Benedict XVI in 2013. Approximately 10% of all popes left or were removed from office <b>before</b> <b>death.</b>|$|E
25|$|Some {{exceptional}} practitioners such as Padmasambhava and Vimalamitra {{are held}} to have realized a higher type of rainbow body without dying. Having completed the four visions <b>before</b> <b>death,</b> the individual focuses on the lights that surround the fingers. His or her physical body self-liberates into a nonmaterial body of light (a Sambhogakāya) {{with the ability to}} exist and abide wherever and whenever as pointed by one's compassion.|$|E
25|$|In {{the world}} of Dead Like Me, grim reapers do not wear black cloaks or carry scythes (cloaks and scythes are only {{featured}} during the opening credits, for humorous effect), but their role remains traditional: they remove {{the souls of the}} living shortly <b>before</b> <b>death</b> and escort them into their afterlife. One becomes a reaper by being the last soul collected when one's own reaper meets his or her secret quota.|$|E
50|$|The poem was {{abandoned}} <b>before</b> Keats's <b>death.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Before</b> his <b>death,</b> Sabatier {{was writing}} his memoirs.|$|R
50|$|He was knighted {{four weeks}} <b>before</b> his <b>death.</b>|$|R
25|$|If benevolence failed, Giuliano killed informers {{and enemies}} ruthlessly. Whenever {{possible}} {{they were allowed}} a minute to pray <b>before</b> <b>death</b> and a note of responsibility was left; to warn other spies, {{and to make sure}} that neither Giuliano nor other bandits were would be accused of crimes they didn't commit. From time to time, he and his men would attack Carabiniere and Polizia outposts and patrols, often killing lawmen. They killed 87 Carabinieri and 33 Polizia from 1943-49.|$|E
25|$|In 1746, the Jacobite officer Francis Towneley, {{along with}} other members of the Manchester Regiment, who had been {{captured}} during the failed Jacobite rising of 1745, were convicted of high treason and condemned to be hanged, drawn and quartered on the common on 30 July. However, by then executioners possessed some discretion as to how much the condemned should suffer <b>before</b> <b>death.</b> Townley was killed before his body was eviscerated. His head was placed on a pike on Temple Bar.|$|E
25|$|Title iii, Concerning Ecclesiastical Persons, {{is divided}} into seven chapters. (cap. i) Of metropolitans. (ii) Of bishops; they are to make a visitation of their dioceses frequently; they should provide support for aged and infirm priests; <b>before</b> <b>death</b> they should appoint an {{administrator}} sede vacante for their dioceses. If {{this has not been}} done, the metropolitan is to make the appointment, or if it be a question of the metropolitan church itself, then the senior suffragan bishop constitutes an administrator until the Holy See can provide.|$|E
