Flying with asymmetric thrust from the two left side engines (which were operating normally at that point), the captain decided to land at Byrd Field (now called Richmond International Airport), near Richmond, Virginia, as a precaution.|$|E
5|$|Most policy analysts (on <b>both</b> <b>right</b> and left) were {{critical}} of the employer mandate provision. They argued that the perverse incentives regarding part-time hours, {{even if they did}} not change existing plans, were real and harmful; that the raised marginal cost of the 50th worker for businesses could limit companies' growth; that the costs of reporting and administration were not worth the costs of maintaining employer plans; and noted that the employer mandate was not essential to maintain adequate risk pools. The effects of the provision generated vocal opposition from business interests and some unions not granted exemptions.|$|E

5|$|By this time, Agesilaus's army, after {{brushing}} off {{attacks from}} the Thessalians during its march through that country, {{had arrived in}} Boeotia, where it was met by an army gathered from the various states of the anti-Spartan alliance. Agesilaus's force from Asia, composed largely of emancipated helots and mercenary veterans of the Ten Thousand, was augmented by half a Spartan regiment from Orchomenus, and another half a regiment that had been transported across the Gulf of Corinth. These armies met each other at Coronea, in Theban territory; as at Nemea, <b>both</b> <b>right</b> wings were victorious, with the Thebans breaking through {{while the rest of}} the allies were defeated. Seeing that the rest of their force had been defeated, the Thebans formed up to break back through to their camp. Agesilaus met their force head on, and in the struggle that followed a number of Thebans were killed before the remainder were able to force their way through and rejoin their allies. After this victory, Agesilaus sailed with his army across the Gulf of Corinth and returned to Sparta.|$|E
5|$|The {{accident}} was {{investigated by the}} CAB and included two hearings where, among others, the surviving captain and flight engineer testified. Based on their investigation, the CAB concluded that the momentary fuel pressure fluctuations in the number 3 and 4 (right side) engines noticed by the flight engineer during takeoff, were most likely caused by a boost pump failure, and did not necessitate any action {{as long as the}} engines kept running normally. According to the CAB, by opening the cross-feed valves between the number 3 and 4 fuel tanks, and leaving them open with the boost pump on for much of the flight, the flight engineer most likely caused the number 4 tank to run dry, resulting in the failure of <b>both</b> <b>right</b> side engines due to fuel exhaustion or starvation during the final flight segment.|$|E
40|$|This book {{provides}} a critical and uniquely comprehensive {{examination of the}} main UN standards and mechanisms dealing with the rights to freedom of expression and information.

Different aspects of freedom of expression and information are foregrounded in different treaties, to ensure the effective enjoyment of <b>both</b> <b>rights</b> by particular groups, eg. children or persons with disabilities, or the meaningful application of the rights in particular situations, eg. combating racism.

5|$|The {{earthquake}} {{originated in}} the Eastern Tennessee Seismic Zone, among the most active seismic areas in the Southeastern United States and one capable of producing moderately strong earthquakes, a few of which have caused damage. The frequency for non-damaging earthquakes from this zone measures out to about one per year, and it has produced many faint earthquakes recorded on seismographs. Such earthquakes have been helpful in highlighting the activity of faults below the Paleozoic detachment. Fault-plane solutions of multiple earthquakes throughout the area confirmed strike-slip faulting between two steeply declining planes. <b>Both</b> <b>right</b> and left-lateral movement occurs in the area, most movement being associated with north-to-south planes (right-lateral) and east-to-west planes (left-lateral). All of these mechanisms indicate reactivation of basement faults below more-recent faults. These basement faults probably converge on one another, and one being strong and the other being weak, produce earthquakes.|$|E

25|$|Studies {{suggest that}} the {{analysis}} of pitch is primarily controlled by the right temporal region of the brain. The right secondary auditory cortex processes pitch change and manipulation of fine tunes; specifically, this region distinguishes the multiple pitches that characterize melodic tunes as contour (pitch direction) and interval (frequency ratio between successive notes) information. The right superior temporal gyrus recruits and evaluates contour information, while <b>both</b> <b>right</b> and left temporal regions recruit and evaluate interval information. In addition, the right anterolateral part of Heschl's gyrus (primary auditory cortex) is also concerned with processing pitch information.|$|E

40|$|Discussion {{regarding}} the balance and inherent worth of <b>both</b> <b>rights</b> and responsibilities is long-standing and exists outside the political domain. In recent times neo-conservative political agendas, including in Australia, have diminished {{the currency of}} rights with policy swings towards responsibilities and obligations, targeted at the most marginalised groups. At the same time rights are recognised and selectively applied to dominant and privileged groups in society. This paper explores some of the philosophical and political concepts of rights and responsibilities, grounding this discussion in Australian case examples of policies of responsibility directed at two groups 'othered' in the dominant policy domain - Indigenous Australians and migrants and refugees. Analysing these examples through the framework of horizontal and vertical axes of political obligation, we propose that <b>both</b> <b>rights</b> and responsibilities can provide a useful schema for critiquing and understanding Australian policies. They also provide leads for vigilance for policy activists and policy practitioners to ensure a critical engagement with ongoing policy trends...|$|R

After getting up from the second knockdown, Floyd abandoned his jab and connected with a left hook that knocked down Johansson. After that, Patterson came on with a strong body attack that wore down Johansson. In the 6th round, Johansson caught Patterson with a solid right. But the power in Ingemar's punches was gone. Patterson won the fight in the 6th round by knockout.|$|E
25|$|In the May 1994 election, the Socialists won a {{plurality}} of votes and 54% of the seats (with the new Prime Minister, Gyula Horn) after a campaign focused largely on economic issues and the substantial decline in living standards since 1990. This signaled a wish to {{turn back to the}} relative security and stability of the socialist era, but voters rejected <b>both</b> <b>right</b> and left-wing extremist solutions – no such party gained seats in parliament. After its disappointing result in the election, leadership of the Fidesz party opted for an ideological shift from a liberal to a conservative party. This caused a severe split in the membership and many members left for the other liberal party, the SZDSZ, which formed a coalition with the socialists, leading to a more than two-thirds majority.|$|E

25|$|The brain {{contains}} {{areas that}} are specialized to deal with language, located in the perisylvian cortex of the left hemisphere. These areas are crucial for performing language tasks, {{but they are not}} the only {{areas that are}} used; disparate parts of <b>both</b> <b>right</b> and left brain hemispheres are active during language production. In multilingual individuals, {{there is a great deal}} of similarity in the brain areas used for each of their languages. Insights into the neurology of multilingualism have been gained by the study of multilingual individuals with aphasia, or the loss of one or more languages as a result of brain damage. Bilingual aphasics can show several different patterns of recovery; they may recover one language but not another, they may recover both languages simultaneously, or they may involuntarily mix different languages during language production during the recovery period. These patterns are explained by the dynamic view of bilingual aphasia, which holds that the language system of representation and control is compromised as a result of brain damage.|$|E
25|$|After the Bolsheviks seized power, <b>both</b> <b>right</b> and left-wing armies rallied against them, {{generating}} the Russian Civil War. To secure {{access to the}} dwindling food supply, in May 1918 Sovnarkom sent Stalin to Tsaritsyn {{to take charge of}} food procurement in southern Russia. Eager to prove himself as a commander, once there he took control of regional military operations. He befriended two military figures, Kliment Voroshilov and Semyon Budyonny, who would form the nucleus of his military and political support base. Believing that victory was assured by numerical superiority, he sent large numbers of Red Army troops into battle against the region's anti-Bolshevik White armies, resulting in heavy losses; Lenin was concerned by this costly tactic. In Tsaritsyn, Stalin executed suspected counter-revolutionaries, sometimes without trial, and—in contravention of government orders—purged the military and food collection agencies of middle-class specialists, some of whom he also executed. His use of state violence and terror was at a greater scale than most Bolshevik leaders approved of. For instance, he ordered several villages to be torched to ensure compliance with his food procurement program.|$|E
25|$|The Doolittle Raiders held {{an annual}} reunion almost {{every year from}} the late 1940s to 2013. The high point of each reunion was a solemn, private {{ceremony}} in which the surviving Raiders performed a roll call, then toasted their fellow Raiders who had died during the previous year. Specially engraved silver goblets, {{one for each of}} the 80 Raiders, were used for this toast; the goblets of those who have died were inverted. Each Raider's name was engraved on his goblet <b>both</b> <b>right</b> side up and upside down. The Raiders drank a toast using a bottle of cognac that accompanied the goblets to each Raider reunion. In 2013, the remaining Raiders decided to hold their last public reunion at Fort Walton Beach, Florida, not far from Eglin Air Force Base, where they trained for the original mission. The bottle and the goblets had been maintained by the United States Air Force Academy on display in Arnold Hall, the cadet social center, until 2006.
