50|$|A <b>buy-side</b> <b>analyst</b> {{typically}} {{works in}} a mutual fund, pension fund, or other non-brokerage firm, and provides research and recommendations exclusively {{for the benefit of}} the company's own money managers (as opposed to individual investors). Unlike sell-side recommendations and reports - which are meant for the analyst's brokerage firm's clients, and the broad outlines of which the press often widely disseminates - buy-side recommendations are not available to anyone outside the firm. If the <b>buy-side</b> <b>analyst</b> stumbles upon a formula, vision, or approach that proves effective, it is kept secret.|$|E

40|$|In {{the first}} chapter, Informativeness of Analysts 2 ̆ 7 Recommendations, we {{investigate}} the informativeness of sell-side analysts 2 ̆ 7 recommendations by examining abnormal stock returns before, {{during and after}} changes in analysts 2 ̆ 7 ratings. First, we show that the market derives different information from the similar recommendations by different brokerage firms, {{especially in the case}} of downgrading from “buy”. The brokerage firms in the sample differ in terms of the impact of their analysts 2 ̆ 7 recommendations on subsequent stock returns, although they are all ranked highly. Second, we document that the market reacts quickly to the analysts 2 ̆ 7 recommendations, which contradicts the continuation of abnormal returns for months after recommendations, i. e., the so-called “post-recommendation drift”, documented by the literature. ^ In the second chapter, A Model of Inside and Outside Experts-the Example of Buy-side and Sell-side Equity Analysts, we model the information transmission from multiple equity analysts to a mutual fund manager. The <b>buy-side</b> <b>analyst</b> has the same preference as the manager while the sell-side has different preference. If the fund manager relies on only sell-side analysts, a subgame equilibrium always exists in which the analysts 2 ̆ 7 opinions are independent of their private signals and thus the information content is totally lost. With one <b>buy-side</b> <b>analyst</b> in the panel, however, truth-telling is the only subgame equilibrium under a certain range of parameters. The equilibrium outcome is that the manager relies on both sell-side and buy-side equity analysts to make investment decisions. ^ In the third chapter, Evaluating Preschool Programs when Length of Exposure to the Program Varies—A Nonparametric Approach, we develop a nonparametric multi-dimensional matching method and apply this method to a large, non-experimental data set to evaluate the effects of a preschool enrichment program. This generalized version of the matching method is able to control for nonrandom selectivity into the program or into alternative program duration by matching the group of interest to a comparison group on more than one dimension. It minimizes the impact of distributional assumptions. The third chapter is intimately related to the first two in that it develops the nonparametric multi-dimensional matching method which is applicable to a variety issues in corporate finance. ...|$|E
40|$|We present {{evidence}} on the trading and performance impact of <b>buy-side</b> <b>analysts.</b> Using data provided by a large global asset manager, we relate buy-side analysts' recommendations to fund transactions on a daily basis. We show that <b>buy-side</b> <b>analysts</b> significantly influence trading decisions: Fund managers strongly follow recent recommendation revisions, even after controlling for other trading determinants. Positive abnormal returns to buy-side analysts' revisions are also reflected {{in the performance of}} mutual fund trades: Trades triggered by buy-side recommendations have higher returns than other trades. Overall, the impact of <b>buy-side</b> <b>analysts</b> is more pronounced than that of sell-side analysts...|$|R
50|$|<b>Buy-side</b> <b>analysts</b> ("buy-siders") {{work for}} buy side money {{management}} {{firms such as}} mutual funds, pension funds, trusts, and hedge funds. They are incentivised to identify investment opportunities that will improve the net worth of the portfolio they work for.|$|R
50|$|Portfolio {{managers}} {{are presented with}} investment ideas from internal <b>buy-side</b> <b>analysts</b> and sell-side analysts from investment banks. It is their job to sift through the relevant information and use their judgment {{to buy and sell}} securities. Throughout each day, they read reports, talk to company managers and monitor industry and economic trends looking for the right company and time to invest the portfolio's capital.|$|R

50|$|Securities {{analysts are}} {{generally}} employed {{in one of}} three capacities: sell-side analysts (who work for a broker-dealer and indirectly for broker-dealer's trading customers), <b>buy-side</b> <b>analysts</b> (who work for institutional investors, such as hedge funds, mutual funds, pension funds, proprietary trading operations of banks and brokers, endowments, and insurance companies), and independent analysts, who work for firms which sell research to sell-side and/or buy-side firms, but who do not themselves engage in securities transactions.|$|R
40|$|Stock analysts provide {{research}} on companies and make recommendations on their stocks. When analysts are employed by brokerage firms and provide {{information for the}} firms’ retail and institutional clients, they are called sell-side analysts. Analysts who work specifically for institutional investors like mutual and pension funds are known as <b>buy-side</b> <b>analysts.</b> Because of their widespread presence in the national media, sell-side analysts’ recommendations {{have become part of}} the public domain and they can have significant influence on stock prices.

50|$|Financial {{analysts in}} {{investment}} banking departments of securities or banking firms often work in teams, analyzing the future prospects {{of companies that}} want to sell shares {{to the public for}} the first time. They also ensure that the forms and written materials necessary for compliance with Securities and Exchange Commission regulations are accurate and complete. They may make presentations to prospective investors about the merits of investing in the new company. Financial analysts also work in mergers and acquisitions departments, preparing analyses on {{the costs and benefits of}} a proposed merger or takeover. There are <b>buy-side</b> <b>analysts</b> and sell-side analysts.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the abilities of}} <b>buy-side</b> <b>analysts</b> by analyzing nontraditional mutual funds that are exclusively managed by in-house analysts rather than traditional portfolio managers. Analysts exhibit stronger general and job-specific investment abilities than traditional managers from {{within and outside the}} fund family. Using holdings of analystrun funds as a proxy for the analysts' best ideas, we document that more-skilled portfolio managers rely on analysts' ideas from the same family to a lesser extent than less-skilled managers. We find that analysts' abilities matter in that they are positively related to the future performance of other funds within the same family...|$|R
40|$|We {{hypothesize that}} {{connections}} with <b>buy-side</b> <b>analysts</b> provide a sell-side analyst with private information {{generated by the}} buy-side that enhances the quality of sell-side research. We proxy for these connections {{with the number of}} stocks at the intersection of stocks held in the portfolios of institutional investors and followed by the sell-side analyst. The larger this intersection, the more opportunities the sell-side analyst has to interact with institutional investors. We proxy for the research quality of the sell-side analyst with the relative accuracy of her earnings forecasts. We find that such connections enhance the accuracy of earnings forecasts, but up to a point of diminishing returns. Additional tests rule out that the observed association is due to reverse causality...|$|R
40|$|Purpose - To {{find out}} how UK {{investment}} analysts use valuation models. Design/methodology/approach - Cites prior studies using residual income and discounted cash flow (DCF) models, while proposing to interview analysts. Combines content analysis of 98 equity reports by investment bank analysts between 2000 and 2003, and 35 structured interview responses (in the form of Likert scales) about what models they use, why they use them and how. Findings - Finds that analysts prefer DCF to accruals-based methods, and combine it with price to earnings ratios. Notes they have many reasons for choosing this model, but it is most heavily used on IT and media firms. Adds a distinct preference for DCF among <b>buy-side</b> <b>analysts.</b> Research limitations/implications - Proposes setting up the discipline of 'sociology of financial accounting'. where sell-side analysts interact with fund managers. Originality/value - Uses a direct approach to the questgion of how accounts are used by third parties...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: We {{examine the}} {{incentives}} of <b>buy-side</b> <b>analysts</b> {{to participate in}} earnings conference calls, and how their participation and proactive involvement in the call affects information production during the call. Our results suggest that avoiding large losses on stocks in the buy-side portfolios is {{a major reason for}} their participation and involvement. Buy-side participation and early involvement lead to greater information production, but the effect exists only when the news around the earnings announcement event is negative. Sell-side analysts benefit from the information production – they revise their forecasts more often and make more accurate forecasts when buy-side involvement is more; however, again, this effect is present only when the news is negative. Finally, when the news around the earnings announcement is positive, greater buy-side participation ameliorates the post-announcement drift, but when the news is negative, the drift is more pronounced when there is more buy-side involvement in the earnings conference call...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Buy-side</b> <b>analysts</b> {{generally}} {{do their work}} in private; publishing research reports and issuing public opinions on a security is generally confined to sell-side and independent analysts. However, the amount of formally published sell-side research is generally thought to be declining, as it becomes more difficult for brokers to gain a clear revenue stream from the investment. The direct connection between securities research and the underwriting of new issues, which enabled research analysts to claim a share of investment banking fees, was severed {{as a result of}} government investigations into excesses of some sell-side analysts in the late 1990s; see, for example, Henry Blodget. In actuality, even before the government probes, direct contact was always an official violation of rules and ethics. Attorneys and compliance personnel, together known as Chinese wall personnel, were instructed to hinder all [...] "wall crossings" [...] {{to the best of their}} ability. However, in the late 1990s this proved to be extremely difficult as well-connected research analysts found ways to go [...] "over the wall." ...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} responses of 104 sell-side and <b>buy-side</b> security <b>analysts</b> {{to a survey}} sent out {{in order to understand}} how analysts conduct investment recommendations. Uncertainty about the quality of analysts’ investment recommendations is a major concern for retail investors. Specifically, the information gathering, processing and transferring process appears to be a black box for retail investors. The findings of our study provide insight into analyst-specific characteristics and sources of information used by analysts to undertake firm-specific research. By examining the practitioners’ responses we derive key factors which influence investment recommendations...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the use of}} valuation models by UK investment analysts. The study is based on, first, semi-structured interviews with 35 sell-side analysts from 10 leading investment banks and with 7 <b>buy-side</b> <b>analysts</b> from 3 asset management firms and, second, content analysis based on 98 equity research reports for FTSE- 100 companies covered by the sell-side interviewees. We observe that analysts perceive the discounted cash flow (DCF) (and to some extent 'sophisticated' models in general) to have become significantly more important than prior survey evidence suggests, although we also find the (somewhat paradoxical) continued importance of 'unsophisticated' valuation multiples, notably the price/earnings ratio (PE). We find perceived limitations in the technical applicability of the DCF, which cause analysts to rely in practice upon valuation multiples and subjective judgement of whether the market price 'feels right'. We also find that contextual factors, notably the analysts' need for their research to be credible to buy-side clients, cause the use of subjective, unsophisticated methods of valuation to be played down. Given the inherent flexibility of the DCF model, coupled with its ostensible credibility, it becomes the natural vehicle for conveying the analyst's research, {{even though it is}} very rarely relied upon to determine target prices and investment recommendations. We conclude that, while the literature has focused on the technical merits of alternative valuation models, analysts' actual usage of valuation models also requires an understanding of social and economic context and motivations. ...|$|R
40|$|Financial {{media are}} the most common {{information}} sources for retail in-vestors and closely watched by <b>buy-side</b> <b>analysts.</b> Previous literature focuses on media bias, mostly in political context. Studies on the relation between nancial media and capital markets have been neglected by researchers. In this paper, I investigate the reputation e¤ect of 8 ̆ 5 nancial media on asset pric-ing. In the model, 8 ̆ 5 rms need to issue shares to fund an investment project whose value is partially learned by a journalist. Uninformed investors price the new shares based on the articles written by the journalist and the public beleif on his honesty. The journalists comments are credible to the extend that he truthfully reports his private signals, rather than be corrupted by the rms. In equilibrium, stock prices increase with the journalists reputation. Firms are willing to pay more bribes to the journalist with a higher reputa-tion. The results also show that the reputation of the journalist may drop when he issues accurate favorable comments because the public anticipate the potential collusion with 8 ̆ 5 rms. Therefore, an opportunistic journalist prefers to release unfavorable articles if there is no collusion agreement between him and the 8 ̆ 5 rms. To retain his credibility in the long run, the opportunistic jour-nalist randomizes his strategies over colluding, telling the truth, and writing excessively critical articles. The model helps to understand why the market still reacts to the media reports even though investors have doubts about the integrity of journalists...|$|R
40|$|Purpose - This article {{examines}} the internationalisation of Tesco and extracts the salient lessons learned from this process. Design/methodology/ approach - This research draws on a dataset of 62 in-depth interviews with key executives, sell- and <b>buy-side</b> <b>analysts</b> and corporate advisers at the leading investment banks in the City of London to detail the experiences of Tesco's European expansion. Findings - The case study of Tesco illuminates {{a number of different}} dimensions of the company's international experience. It offers some new insights into learning in international distribution environments such as the idea that learning is facilitated by uncertainty or "shocks" in the international retail marketplace; the size of the domestic market may inhibit change and so disable international learning; and learning is not necessarily facilitated by step-by-step incremental approaches to expansion. Research limitations/implications - The paper explores learning from a rather broad perspective, although it is hoped that these parameters can be used to raise a new set of more detailed priorities for future research on international retail learning. It is also recognised that the data gathered for this case study focus on Tesco's European operations. Practical implications - This paper raises a number of interesting issues such as whether the extremities of the business may be a more appropriate place for management to experiment and test new retail innovations, {{and the extent to which}} retailers take self-reflection seriously. Originality/value - The paper applies a new theoretical learning perspective to capture the variety of experiences during the internationalisation process, thus addressing a major gap in our understanding of the whole internationalisation process. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to shed light on the nature of the work that {{financial}} analysts actually do in the context of the market for information and to further open up research in this area to qualitative and sociological inquiry. Design/methodology/approach: – A field study with 49 financial <b>analysts</b> (both <b>buy-side</b> and sell-side) was undertaken in order to understand the work that they actually do. This field study was theoretically informed by the sociology of Pierre Bourdieu. Findings: – The authors find, in contrast to both conventional wisdom and assumptions in prior (mostly quantitative) literature, that the primary value of sell-side analyst work lies not in the recommendations that analysts ultimately produce, but in the rich contextual information that they provide to <b>buy-side</b> <b>analysts.</b> In order to successfully provide this information, analysts have to embody large amounts of technical capital into their habitus. Research limitations/implications: – Much research in this area erroneously presumes that forecasting is the primary function of analysts. Analyst work needs to be understood as multifarious and requiring a well-developed habitus that is attuned to the accumulation of both technical and social capital. Future qualitative research might usefully explore in more detail the way in which corporate managers interact with analysts. The present study solicits the viewpoints only of the analysts themselves. The organisational context of the analysts was not explored in detail and the interviews were pre-crisis, which possibly explains why the technical capital of sell-side analysts was extolled by interviewees rather than lambasted. Originality/value: – The paper is one of few studies to look at analysts from a qualitative and sociological perspective. It both complements and extends both emerging sociological work on financial intermediaries and qualitative work on the “market for information”...|$|R
