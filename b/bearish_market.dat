Granville is probably best known for his <b>bearish</b> <b>market</b> calls during the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, when he claimed that the stock market was headed for imminent collapse. Granville was known as a great showman who would emerge from a coffin at an investment conference, or appear to walk across water (at a swimming pool) when meeting clients. According to Robert Shiller, Granville's market calls were said by major media sources to have caused large moves in the Dow Jones Industrial Average on April 22, 1980 (+4.05%) and on January 6, 1981.|$|E

Second, whether the portfolio manager minimizes the portfolio return volatility relative to the benchmark volatility. Third, whether the magnitude of premiums/discounts varies in bullish and <b>bearish</b> <b>market</b> conditions. Our findings suggest a significant difference in alpha-generation abilities of fund manager between the two market conditions. Tracking error was found to be relatively high in bearish conditions. The average premium is higher in bearish markets characterized with highest volatility. On the other hand, the average discount is higher in bullish markets characterized with least volatility.

Contrary to literature?s scenario of wealthy investors, average investors invest each month over life. Many purchases prevent investors from buying at peak, but horizons decrease, giving latter investments {{less time to}} offset losses. This paper accommodates timing using internal rates of return, facilitating the comparison of wealthy and average investors.

Therefore we can measure traders' behavior in both bullish and <b>bearish</b> <b>markets.</b> We observe underreaction of price changes {{to changes in}} fundamental value which induces overvaluation in bearish and undervaluation in bullish markets.

In bullish markets, institutional purchases have a bigger price impact than sells; however, in the <b>bearish</b> <b>markets,</b> sells have a higher price impact. This differs from previous findings on price impact asymmetry.

40|$|The article {{examines}} the impact of transaction costs on the trading strategy of informed institutional investors in a sequential trading market where traders can choose to transact a large or {{a small amount of}} stock. The analysis shows how the trading strategy of informed investors and the price impact of their trades depends on market conditions. The main prediction of the model is that institutional buyers are, on average, more aggressive than institutional sellers in <b>bearish</b> <b>markets</b> and less aggressive in bullish markets. Hence, the price impact is higher for purchases when <b>market</b> conditions are <b>bearish,</b> while it is higher for sales when market conditions are bullish. However, this asymmetry vanishes during strongly bearish or bullish phases, when information-based orders stop because the informational advantage of institutional investors becomes too small with respect to the transaction costs...|$|R

40|$|This paper backtests the {{performance}} of the two main dynamic portfolio insurance strategies, the option based portfolio insurance (OBPI) with synthetic puts and the constant proportion portfolio in- surance (CPPI) applied on the French index CAC 40 for the period from 1 / 1 / 2004 to 1 / 9 / 2011. The strategies are compared relatively to each other under di erent market conditions. The comparison is conducted using three types of criteria: return criteria, risk criteria and investor preferences criteria. The results showed neither OBPI nor CPPI outperforms the other in terms of terminal portfolio value and payo s. Neither of OBPI or CPPI returns stochastically dom- inate the other at rst order. The Vega function analysis showed that the OBPI is much more sensitive to the underlying risky asset volatility than CPPI where the sensitivity is negative and becomes more negative with higher multiples. In terms of oor protection CPPI dominated OBPI in a <b>bearish</b> <b>market</b> and has been domi- nated by OBPI in bullish and no trend markets. In terms of the cost of insurance, the CPPI dominated OBPI and provided lower cost of insurance at the majority of cases.

In bullish markets savings plans with a high equity ratio perform the best, in <b>bearish</b> <b>markets</b> the classic insurance concept shows better returns. A stop loss strategy suffers from gap risk, whence a CPPI strategy combines the strength of both gap risk minimization and equity ratio maximization. The effect of fees on the savings plans dominates the performance, especially in typical fee structures found in the German Riester-Rente.

Representative bias is indicated by three variables: gambler’s fallacy, halo effect, and familiarity effect. This research will prove that during the trading in stock market, investors act irrationally and cause representative bias. It will result negative impact on investor’s portfolio. This research uses a quantitative approach to T-Test model. Data were collected with questionnaire dan distributed to investors directly (personally) and indirectly (google form). The sample used in this research were 378 respondents. First, questionnaire was analyzed using frequency distribution. Second, questionnaire was assessed using Likert Scale and analyzed using one sample t-test dan paired t-test to answer the hypothesis and research questions. The result is gambler’s fallacy exists in investors when they trading in bullish stock market, {{but it does not}} exists in bearish stock market. Halo effect does not exists in investors when they trading in bullish and bearish stock market. While, familiarity effect exists in investors when trading in bullish and bearish stock market. In bullish stock market, familiarity effect was greater than bearish stock market.

We tested whether the best performing rule really beats its buy-and-hold benchmark strategy in bullish and <b>bearish</b> <b>markets,</b> respectively, during the in-sample testing period. The best rules' performance relative to the benchmark is also tested during the one-year out-of-sample period for all ten sets of data. A novel set of multi-indicator rules, MFI-RSI, and four popular categories of single-indicator rules, filter rules, moving averages, on-balance volume averages and momentum strategy in volume, were employed to form our universe of trading rules. The results on the SPA test suggest market efficiency in nine of the ten futures markets, while the results on the Sortino and reversed Sortino ratios reveal persistent outperformance of the best 'downside' and 'upside' rules relative to the buy-and-hold benchmark across time in four and three futures markets, respectively.
