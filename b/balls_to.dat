40|$|Abstract. Orthogonal {{experiment}} design and variance analysis were adopted {{to investigate the}} hydrogen desorption properties of NaAlH 4 and LiAlH 4, which consisted of three stages, ball-milled under argon. Optimum milling condition was {{very important for the}} performance of NaAlH 4 and LiAlH 4, which was obtained from the orthogonal experiments. The orthogonal {{experiment design}} considered three experimental factors, i. e. weight ratio of <b>ball</b> <b>to</b> power, weight ratio of ɸ 8 <b>ball</b> <b>to</b> ɸ 4 <b>ball</b> and milling time, which varied on three different levels, respectively. According to the range analysis and variance analysis from the orthogonal experiments, the weight ratio of <b>ball</b> <b>to</b> powder and ɸ 8 <b>ball</b> <b>to</b> ɸ 4 <b>ball</b> had more impacts on the hydrogen desorption time of NaAlH 4,while the most sensitive influencing factor of LiAlH 4 was milling time. NaAlH 4 had the optimum performance when the weight ratio of <b>ball</b> <b>to</b> power was 30 : 1, the weight ratio of ɸ 8 <b>ball</b> <b>to</b> ɸ 4 <b>ball</b> was 0. 5 : 1 and milling time was 0. 5 h. LiAlH 4 had the optimum performance when the weight ratio of <b>ball</b> <b>to</b> power was 40 : 1, the weight ratio of ɸ 8 <b>ball</b> <b>to</b> ɸ 4 <b>ball</b> was 0. 5 : 1 and milling time was 2 h...|$|R

5|$|At the Tenkaichi Budōkai {{three years}} later Goku and his allies oppose Kame-Sen'nin's rival and Taopaipai's brother, Tsuru-Sen'nin, and his {{students}} Tenshinhan and Chaozu. Kuririn is killed after the tournament and Goku tracks down and is defeated by his killer, Piccolo Daimao. The samurai Yajirobe takes Goku to the hermit Karin, where he receives healing and a power boost. Meanwhile, Piccolo fights Kame-Sen'nin and Chaozu, leading to both their deaths, and uses the Dragon <b>Balls</b> <b>to</b> regain his youth before destroying Shenlong. Goku then kills Piccolo Daimao, who, just before dying, spawns his son/reincarnation Piccolo. Karin then directs Goku to Kami-sama, the original creator of the Dragon <b>Balls,</b> <b>to</b> restore Shenlong and revive his slain friends. Goku trains under Kami {{for the next three}} years, once again reuniting with his friends at the Tenkaichi Budōkai, where he narrowly wins against Piccolo before leaving with Chi-Chi to keep his promise to marry her.|$|E
5|$|Australia toured New Zealand {{before the}} World Cup, and Poulton was {{dropped into the}} middle-order. She made four {{in the first two}} matches, both of which the hosts won. She {{struggled}} in these matches, taking 15 and 18 <b>balls</b> <b>to</b> score the four runs in either ODI, was omitted for the third match. She then returned to her customary opening position and scored 81 from 97 balls, including 11 fours, in the fourth match, helping to set up an Australia victory by 44 runs. The fifth match of the series was abandoned.|$|E

5|$|Australia {{went on to}} face India in the semi-final. Chasing {{a target}} of 120, Poulton came in to join captain Blackwell—who had {{promoted}} herself up the order—at 2/75, with 45 runs needed from 56 balls. Poulton hit 30 from 26 <b>balls</b> <b>to</b> seal an Australian victory with seven wickets and seven <b>balls</b> <b>to</b> spare. She brought up the winning runs with a lofted drive that bounced once before going for four runs. In the final against New Zealand, Australia started poorly after electing to bat. Nitschke fell in the third over to bring Poulton in at 1/10, before Villani and Blackwell fell quickly to leave Australia at 3/20 in the sixth over. This {{was followed by a}} consolidating partnership of 30 between Poulton and Cameron, but they were unable to lift the run rate substantially; their stand took 45 balls. Poulton was caught trying to loft a ball over cover, and two balls later, Cameron was bowled, leaving Australia at 5/51 in the 13th over. Only Poulton managed a solitary boundary. A later burst took Australia to 8/106 from their 20 overs and Poulton ended with the highest score of 20 from 28 balls. The Australians then restricted New Zealand to 6/103 to complete a three-run win. Poulton was Australian's highest run-scorer for the tournament and the third among all players.|$|E
5|$|Karthik {{was then}} {{displaced}} as the reserve gloveman for the two-Test home series against South Africa; Wriddhiman Saha was {{called up to}} be Dhoni's deputy. Karthik scored 183 and 150 in the Duleep Trophy final against West Zone, becoming the third player after Lalchand Rajput and Yuvraj Singh to score centuries in both innings of a Duleep Trophy final. However, {{it was not enough}} as Yusuf Pathan scored an unbeaten 210 from only 190 <b>balls</b> <b>to</b> set a new world record for a successful run-chase.|$|E
5|$|Somerset {{won their}} first match, in which Alfonso Thomas scored two {{boundaries}} {{off the last}} three balls of the match to secure victory. Their opponents, Deccan Chargers scored 153 off their 20 overs, and with three wickets remaining, Somerset required 55 runs off 37 <b>balls</b> <b>to</b> win. A record eighth-wicket partnership between James Hildreth and Thomas of 50 brought the victory within reach, and Thomas' highest-score in Twenty20 cricket granted Somerset the win. Somerset lost their second match, being bowled out for their second-lowest Twenty20 total, 106 by Trinidad and Tobago.|$|E

50|$|End of volley: A volley ends {{when the}} ball bounces twice, misses the {{opposite}} side, is double hit, or hits or sinks in the cups. A team that causes the volley to end by missing the opposing side or allowing the <b>ball</b> <b>to</b> bounce twice must then serve the <b>ball</b> <b>to</b> restart play. A hit or sink against an opponent results in the opponent serving the <b>ball</b> <b>to</b> restart play.|$|R
5|$|Stivetts {{struggled}} with the new distance initially; his first four starts of the season were largely ineffective. On April29, with the weather cold and rainy, he issued bases on <b>balls</b> <b>to</b> ten New York Giants batters, and surrendered 15runs. The next two starts were against Baltimore and he allowed seven runs to score the first game despite gaining the victory, and another 16runs in a loss in the second game. Another ten runs scored on May 10, in a loss versus the Washington Senators.|$|E
5|$|The {{return of}} Clarke to the ODI {{team for the}} Pakistan series also saw White move down the order again, {{although}} batting at number five, he made his second international century in the first match, scoring 105 from 88 <b>balls</b> <b>to</b> help drive Australia to victory. White continued to perform well with the bat in the series, making a half-century in the second match and making decent totals {{in a number of}} the other games as Australia swept the series 5–0.|$|E

5|$|After {{winning the}} toss, New Zealand captain Haidee Tiffen opted to bat first. Her side were bowled out in 47.2 overs {{for a total}} of 166 runs. All-rounder Lucy Doolan, batting at number nine, was the highest scorer for New Zealand with 48. England bowler Nicky Shaw took a career-best four wickets for 34 runs. In their response, England built an opening {{partnership}} of 74 runs and continued to score steadily. Despite regularly losing wickets, they reached the winning total with 23 <b>balls</b> <b>to</b> spare, earning England their first World Cup title for 16 years. Shaw, who had initially not been included in the England team, was named player of the match after replacing the injured Jenny Gunn just minutes {{before the start of the}} match.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 200708 season, she made her senior debut for the New South Wales Breakers in the Australian {{domestic}} one-day league. She was used as a specialist batsman in the top-order, as Leonie Coleman, a wicket-keeper in the Australian squad, also played for New South Wales. She made her debut against South Australia and was unsuccessful to begin with, scoring only 24 runs in her first five innings. After one month at senior level, she broke through with a match-winning performance in her sixth senior game. After Queensland had made 170, Healy came in with the score at 5/99 after 32 overs, with 18 overs remaining. She raised the run rate, scoring 41 not out from 50 balls, with eight fours, shepherding the tail-enders and guiding her state to a two-wicket win with 17 <b>balls</b> <b>to</b> spare.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{went on to}} face India in the semi-final. Healy stumped leading Indian batsman Mithali Raj {{from the}} bowling of Sthalekar and was not {{required}} to bat as Australia reached their target of 120 with seven wickets and seven <b>balls</b> <b>to</b> spare. Australia elected to bat first in the final against New Zealand, but was top-order struggled and Healy came to the crease to join Elliott at 5/51 in the 13th over {{after the fall of}} two wickets in quick succession. The pair lifted the run rate by adding 21 runs in 18 balls. Healy scored 10 from as many balls, but was then run out attempting a second run after being dropped by Sara McGlashan in the outfield. This left the score at 6/72 in the 16th over, and Australia eventually ended on 8/106.|$|E

In Puerto Rico, workers quickly responded to power and water outages. Similarly on Saint Croix, power systems were quickly restored. On November23, U.S. President Bill Clinton declared the U.S. Virgin Islands a disaster area. This allocated federal funding for loans to public and private entities and provided 75percent {{of the cost of}} debris removal. By December10, nearly 3,000residents had applied for assistance, mostly on St. Croix. In response, the federal government provided about $480,000 to the affected people. The United States Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance provided $185,000, mostly directed toward the United Nations Development Programme, for aid to other islands in the eastern Caribbean. Other agencies, including the Caribbean Development Bank, the United Kingdom's Department for International Development, and the European Union, provided $1.1million in assistance.|$|E
