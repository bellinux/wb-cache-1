It has pleasant sweet aroma reminiscent of jasmine. Consequently, it is used widely in perfumery and cosmetics for its aroma and in flavorings to impart apple and pear flavors.|$|E
50|$|The {{fragrance}} of ylang-ylang is rich and deep with notes of rubber and custard, and bright with hints of jasmine and neroli. The essential oil {{of the flower}} is obtained through steam distillation of the flowers and separated into different grades (extra, 1, 2, or 3) according to when the distillates are obtained. The main aromatic components of ylang-ylang oil are <b>benzyl</b> <b>acetate,</b> linalool, p-cresyl methyl ether, and methyl benzoate, responsible for its characteristic odor.|$|E
50|$|This oil {{can cause}} {{irritation}} {{in some people}} if used too frequently or in high concentrations, so use with caution, preferably in low concentrations.

The behavior of volatile collection is essentially unique in the animal kingdom. Single synthetic compounds are commonly used as bait to attract and collect males for study, and include many familiar flavorings and odors considered appealing to humans (e.g., methyl salicylate, eugenol, cineole, <b>benzyl</b> <b>acetate,</b> methyl benzoate, methyl cinnamate), and others which are not (e.g., skatole).|$|E

The chloride anion is then transferred to the aqueous phase. The transfer energies of the anions contribute to that given out by the reaction.|$|E

40|$|Fifty {{compounds}} {{related to}} <b>benzyl</b> <b>acetate</b> were evaluated quantitatively as attractants {{to the male}} oriental fruit fly (Dacus dorsalis) and the male melon fly (Dacus cucurbitae). Thienylmethyl acetate was nearly as attractive as <b>benzyl</b> <b>acetate</b> to both species, but cyclohexylmethyl acetate was completely unattractive, emphasizing {{the role of the}} planar aromatic ring in receptor interaction. Although <b>benzyl</b> <b>acetate</b> was equally attractive to both species, para substituents invariably reduced attraction to the oriental fruit fly. A number of derivatives, including p-hydroxy-, p-methoxy-, p-acetoxy-, and p-cyanobenzyl acetates were highly attractive to the melon fly. Selective fluorination indicated that the polarizability of the carbonyl carbon is important in receptor interaction with the melon fly but is not specifically involved in the oriental fruit fly. Attraction to the melon fly was lost with ortho, meta, or dimethoxy substitution of <b>benzyl</b> <b>acetate,</b> but the 3, 4 - and 2, 5 -dimethoxybenzyl acetates were attractive to the oriental fruit fly.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{increase}} the stability and water solubility of fragrance materials, to provide controlled release of these compounds, and to convert these substances from liquid to powder form by preparing their inclusion complexes with cyclodextrins (CDs).

The use of β-cyclodextrin (βCD) and 2 -hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (2 -HPβCD) for increasing the solubility of these 2 fragrance materials was studied. Linalool and <b>benzyl</b> <b>acetate</b> gave a B-type diagram with βCD, whereas they gave an AL-type diagram with 2 -HPβCD. Therefore, complexes of fragrance materials with 2 -HPβCD at 1 : 1 and 1 : 2 molar ratios (guest:host) were prepared. The formation of inclusion complexes was confirmed using proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1 H-NMR) spectroscopy and circular dichroism spectroscopy. The results of the solubility studies showed that preparing the inclusion complex with 2 -HPβCD at a 1 : 1 molar ratio increased the solubility of linalool 5. 9 -fold and that of <b>benzyl</b> <b>acetate</b> 4. 2 -fold, whereas the complexes at a 1 : 2 molar ratio increased the solubility 6. 4 - and 4. 5 -fold for linalool and <b>benzyl</b> <b>acetate,</b> respectively. The stability and in vitro release studies were performed on the gel formulations prepared using uncomplexed fragrance materials or inclusion complexes of fragrance materials at a 1 : 1 molar ratio.

A third experiment tested the activity of <b>benzyl</b> <b>acetate</b> in regard to its ability to induce acinar cell foci or to promote the growth of such foci in azaserine-treated rats. The results showed that equivalent doses of azaserine induce two to seven times more foci in LEW than in F 344 rats, and that LEW rats have {{a higher incidence of}} "spontaneous" foci than F 344 rats. Azaserine-treated LEW rats that were given 5 mL corn oil/kg body weight 5 days per week by gavage developed more acinar cell foci than rats fed a basal diet (chow).

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{the development of}} semiochemical identification expertise and methodology at the University of Pretoria. The Eucalyptus snout beetle Gonipterus scutellatus {{was used as a}} model insect in developing these methods, firstly because it is a known pest in the Eucalyptus forestry industry of South Africa. Secondly, nothing is known about its chemical ecology and lastly, it is a relatively large insect that is easily worked on. Three main techniques were used namely: Electroantennography (EAG), Gas Chromatography Electroantennography Detection (GC-EAD) and Gas Chromatog- raphy Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS). EAG was used to difierentiate and identify certain Eucalyptus species that were expected to contain compounds that may function as either kairomones or allomones for G. scutellatus. The EAG process revealed that G. scutellatus responds more intensely to damaged Eucalyptus leaves as compared to undamaged leaves. The crushed foliage of the known hosts Eucalyptus globulus and E. viminalis gave larger responses than the crushed foliage from a known non-host E. citriodora. We sampled the volatiles from the crushed foliage of these three species and tentatively identified sixteen compounds from the E. globulus volatile profile that was antennally active for G. scutellatus females. The presence of these volatiles were subsequently investigated for E. viminalis and E. citriodora. The green leaf volatiles, (Z) - 3 hexenyl acetate, (Z) - 3 -hexen- 1 -ol and (E) - 2 -hexenal and aromatic compounds, 2 -phenylethanol, <b>benzyl</b> <b>acetate</b> and ethylphenylacetate often gave larger responses than the terpenes such as α-pinene, β-pinene and camphene. Crushed E. globulus leaves contained 2 -phenyl ethanol, <b>benzyl</b> <b>acetate,</b> ethylphenylacetate, eucalyptol, α-pinene, (Z) - 3 hexenyl acetate, (Z) - 3 -hexen- 1 -ol and (E) - 2 -hexenal that were antennally active. The E. viminalis profile had very little 2 -phenylethanol and virtually no <b>benzyl</b> <b>acetate.</b> The E. citriodora volatile profile contained very little (Z) - 3 -hexen- 1 -ol, (E) - 2 -hexenal, 2 -phenylethanol, <b>benzyl</b> <b>acetate</b> and ethylphenylacetate. These compounds may influence the host selection behaviour of G. scutellatusfemales. These volatiles can be tested in a behavioural bioassay in order to determine their effect on the Eucalyptus snout beetle G. scutellatus. Dissertation (MSc) [...] University of Pretoria, 2010.

40|$|Esters are {{important}} {{contributors to the}} aroma of numerous flowers and fruits. Acetate esters such as geranyl acetate, phenylethyl acetate and <b>benzyl</b> <b>acetate</b> are generated {{as a result of}} the action of alcohol acetyltransferases (AATs). Numerous homologous AATs from various plants have been characterized using in-vitro assays. To study the function of rose alcohol acetyltransferase (RhAAT) in planta, we generated transgenic petunia plants expressing the rose gene under the control of a CaMV- 35 S promoter. Although the preferred substrate of RhAAT in vitro is geraniol, in transgenic petunia flowers, it used phenylethyl alcohol and benzyl alcohol to produce the corresponding acetate esters, not generated by control flowers. The level of benzyl alcohol emitted by the flowers of different transgenic lines was ca. three times higher than that of phenylethyl alcohol, which corresponded to the ratio between the respective products, i. e. ca. three times more <b>benzyl</b> <b>acetate</b> than phenylethyl acetate.
