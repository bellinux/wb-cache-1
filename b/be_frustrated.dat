5|$|In the First Test at Trent Bridge, Hassett hit 115 in a rain-affected {{match that}} ended in a draw. Over the next month, he {{struggled}} in the county matches, scoring only 30 runs in total. The Australians were to <b>be</b> <b>frustrated</b> {{in the next three}} Tests. In the Second Test at Lord’s, Hassett made 104, top-scoring in Australia’s 346 despite being hindered by a bandaged right arm and cramps. England took a 26-run first innings lead, but Australia replied with 368. Hassett’s bowlers reduced England to 3/12 but they hung on to deny Australia victory. The Third Test was another wet affair. Hassett made 26 as Australia scored 318 and took a 42-run first innings lead, but they then collapsed to be 8/35. Australia was saved from defeat by the rain, which meant that less than 14 hours of play was possible.|$|E
5|$|The new law was {{met with}} {{considerable}} resistance, especially in the towns and cities, where Tillman had less support. Dozens of clandestine saloons opened, fueled by barrels of illicit liquor, often transported by railroad. Tillman appointed dispensary constables, who tried to seize such shipments, to <b>be</b> <b>frustrated</b> {{by the fact that}} the South Carolina Railroad was in federal receivership, and state authorities could not confiscate goods entrusted to it. All of Tillman's constables were white, placing him at a disadvantage in dealing with the alcohol trade among African Americans. Some of the constables tried going undercover by blacking their faces like minstrels; later, Tillman hired an African-American detective from Georgia.|$|E

5|$|Puritans {{believed}} that God is sovereign {{over all of}} history and nature and that none of what were called his decrees would <b>be</b> <b>frustrated.</b> There was significant debate in the Assembly over the relationship of God's decree of predestination, or choice to save some people, to the redemption purchased by Christ's death. Many of the Reformed during this period taught that Christ died with the purpose only to save those who were eternally chosen to be saved, a doctrine called particular redemption. A vocal minority of the divines of the Assembly argued for a position known as hypothetical universalism. Edmund Calamy held such a view, and he argued that Christ's death, as well as saving {{those who had been}} chosen, offered salvation to all people on condition that they believe. The Assembly's Confession did not teach such a view, and its language is much more amenable to a particular redemption interpretation, but there is a general agreement among scholars that the Confession's language allows an hypothetical universalist interpretation.|$|E

At the end of 1962 the Woodville Football Club, based in a neighbouring suburb to Alberton, {{was admitted to the}} SANFL in an attempt to weaken Port Adelaide via taking up some of its suburban recruiting zone. In 1965, Fos Williams coached his last premiership in-front of 62,543 people, the largest ever crowd at Adelaide Oval. In that game Port Adelaide defeat Sturt by 3 points. After the 1965 Grand Final, Port Adelaide would <b>be</b> <b>frustrated</b> by the dominance of Sturt, which won seven premierships over this period under the leadership of Jack Oatey. In all, despite playing in 6 of the next 10 grand finals, Port Adelaide would fail to win a premiership until 1977.|$|E

Over several weeks between December and January, the Union ships had regularly sailed towards the Confederates on the Mississippi, Ohio, and Tennessee Rivers in order to provoke an engagement, to <b>be</b> <b>frustrated</b> by blank-cartridge shots from the latter's cannons, the Confederates being reluctant to be drawn into a full engagement. On the evening of January 10, the Union forces in Kentucky having just defeated their opponents at the Battle of Middle Creek, the Essex and the St Louis moved off in heavy fog from the ferry landings at Cairo in convoy escorting troop transports carrying Brigadier General John Alexander McClernand's brigade. Their path was blocked for part of the night by a steamer which had run aground north of Cairo, and by Cmdr. William Porter moving off-route to investigate two suspicious, but later revealed to be legitimate, boats moored on the riverside.|$|E

500|$|The film's {{experimental}} plot and dense dialogue were controversially received. Esquires Mike D'Angelo claimed that [...] "anybody who claims {{he fully understands}} what's going on in Primer after seeing it just once is either a [...] or a liar". Scott Tobias writes for The A.V. Club: [...] "The banter is heavy on technical jargon and almost perversely short on exposition; {{were it not for}} the presence of voiceover narration, the film would be close to incomprehensible." [...] For the Los Angeles Times, Carina Chocano writes: [...] "sticklers for linear storytelling are bound to <b>be</b> <b>frustrated</b> by narrative threads that start promisingly, then just sort of fall off the spool". Some reviewers were entirely put off by the film's obfuscated narrative. Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter complained that Primer [...] "nearly gets lost in a miasma of technical jargon and scientific conjecture".|$|E
500|$|Dylan and the Band were a major musical {{influence}} on Harrison {{at the end}} of his career with the Beatles. While on a visit to Woodstock in late 1968, he established a friendship with Dylan and found himself drawn to the Band's sense of communal music-making and to the creative equality among the band members, which contrasted with Lennon and McCartney's domination of the Beatles' songwriting and creative direction. This coincided with a prolific period in his songwriting and a growing desire to assert his independence from the Beatles, tensions among whom [...] surfaced again in January 1969, during the filming of rehearsals at Twickenham Studios for what became the album Let It <b>Be.</b> <b>Frustrated</b> by the poor working conditions in the cold and sterile film studio, as well as by what he perceived as Lennon's creative disengagement from the Beatles and a domineering attitude from McCartney, Harrison quit the group on 10 January, but agreed to return twelve days later.|$|E

[...] Laverdure's column consisted of six infantry companies of Algerian and Senegalese Tirailleurs, a party of irregular Goumiers, two batteries of 65mm and 75mm (the famous Soixante-Quinze) cannon and a squadron of Spahi cavalry: numbering 43 officers and 1,187 men in total. [...] This amounted to less than half the troops he had had in September when he was first denied permission to launch an attack. [...] Laverdure marched at 2.30 am on the morning of 13 November 1914 without informing his superiors, only leaving behind a note saying he was going to [...] "annihilate" [...] Hammou's camp.|$|E

[...] Scott Meslow of The Atlantic described the episode as one focused on love and relationships. IGN's Eric Goldman evaluated the episode as [...] "satisfying", and added that its character development was executed strongly. Ultimately, he issued [...] "Secrets" [...] an eight out of ten, signifying a [...] "great" [...] rating. Aaron Rutkoff of The Wall Street Journal echoed synonymous sentiments; [...] "Viewers tuning in each week {{in the hope of}} watching pulse-quickening battles between overmatched humans and armies of the undead are sure to <b>be</b> <b>frustrated.</b> Things are static in an action sense, but the show’s admirably nuanced characters are changing and reacting to the world in surprising and complicated ways."

[...] Due to a desire that Linda and Oscar should be believable as siblings, Nathaniel Brown, a non-professional, was cast because of his resemblance to Huerta. Noé feared that a professional actor would <b>be</b> <b>frustrated</b> by being shown almost exclusively from behind, but he felt that Brown, an aspiring director, would find it stimulating to merely be present on the set. Auditions were held for westerners living in Japan for other Tokyo-based roles. Cyril Roy went to an audition with a friend only because he wanted to talk with the director, whose previous films he admired. Roy was cast as Alex, since Noé found his talkative personality suitable for the role. Noé said about Brown and Roy: ...|$|E

Minogue publicly commented about the single's aftermath [...] "I think the static was that Elton had 75 percent of the sales that week, so mine didn't get off at a good start." [...] She went on to say [...] "I've told not to <b>be</b> <b>frustrated,</b> but I was frustrated because the album should be out [...] The point of it is to get it out and maybe people will like it, they may love it or they might hate it, but it was in my hands." [...] She also felt guilt for parting with Stock Aitken Waterman after her production team with Deconstruction was not in good terms; she later commented that she departed on [...] "good terms".|$|E

500|$|Reviewers criticized or {{had little}} {{praise for the}} game's {{emphasis}} on collecting items and backtracking—"an interactive egg hunt". This had become a trend in the developer's games, and Donkey Kong 64 followed the [...] "predictable formula" [...] of making players collect multiple sets of items and those sets in full for a special ending. Next Generation also saw the developer creating a habit of backtracking in their games. GameSpot was more diplomatic: those who liked collecting items would be titillated by its replay value, {{and those who did}} not would <b>be</b> <b>frustrated</b> by its chores. The puzzles and minigames are fun the first time through, according to EGM, but they quickly become worn when replayed with increasingly tighter time restrictions. GameSpot, however, considered parts of Donkey Kong 64 gameplay [...] "cerebral", requiring the player to consider several simultaneous tasks to solve later puzzles. Already familiar with the game's concepts borrowed from Super Mario 64, Ocarina of Time, and Banjo-Kazooie, reviewers considered the game's tasks less innovative or interesting to decipher. In retrospective reviews, Nintendo Life described the chore of collecting objects [...] "excessive" [...] and repetitive. They suggested that backtracking, for instance, could be reduced by letting the player switch between characters at any time.|$|E
500|$|Kaladze {{was limited}} to just six league {{appearances}} and 11 total appearances in the 2003–04 season. In the next season, Kaladze played just 19 Serie A matches and five in the Champions League as Milan finished as runners-up in both competitions. He was an unused substitute in that season's Champions League final, where Milan lost on penalties to Liverpool after a 3–3 draw. He was said to <b>be</b> <b>frustrated</b> with his lack of first-team options and a move to Chelsea, in exchange for Hernán Crespo or for £4 million, was widely reported. Kaladze himself said, [...] "I have agreed everything with the Chelsea management. Now {{it is necessary to}} wait for them to reach an agreement with Milan and I think I could become a Chelsea player next week." [...] Chelsea opted to sign Asier del Horno instead and Kaladze later declared himself [...] "glad" [...] that the deal fell through. On 30 June 2005, he extended his contract with Milan until 2010 and again on 4 September 2006, this time until 2011. In 2005–06, an injury to Paolo Maldini meant that Kaladze was moved back into the centre of defence, his favoured position. Milan finished third that season, although they would have finished second if there were no 2006 Italian football scandal which resulted in a 30-point deduction.|$|E
