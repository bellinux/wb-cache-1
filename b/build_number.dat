The English Electric Co, {{as they did with}} many of their diesel locomotives of the 1950s-60s, did not assemble them at the Preston works, but allocated the final assembly of <b>build</b> <b>numbers</b> 2254/E7821-2273/E7840 (road no. 750-769) to Robert Stephenson & Hawthorn and <b>build</b> <b>numbers</b> 2274/D353-2295/D374 (road no. 770-791) to Vulcan Foundry, both English Electric plants. The South Island allocated locomotives were initially classified DH because they were fitted with adjustable bogies that allowed a higher maximum axle weight and tractive effort.|$|R

In the build numbering system of macOS, every version has a unique beginning <b>build</b> <b>number,</b> which identifies what whole version of macOS it is part of. Mac OS X v10.0 had build numbers starting with 4, 10.1 had build numbers starting with 5, and so forth (earlier build numbers represented developer releases).|$|E

Both classes were used on express passenger services, greatly improving the economy and speed of long-distance passenger travel in Western Australia, the results of which were most visible on the West Australian stage of the Trans-Australian Railway and Westland Express.|$|E

25|$|The {{differences}} between the three versions of the Williams were largely a reflection of phase changes across the Clio range, e.g. the gradual addition of enhanced safety features and cosmetic variations. Other than this, the Williams 1 and 2 had no sunroof and were painted in 449 Sports Blue. The final Williams 3 was painted in a slightly brighter shade of blue (432 Monaco Blue) and finally gained a sunroof which had long been standard on virtually all previous Clios. The original Williams was the lightest of the three, lacking the electrics necessary for the sunroof or the mirrors, and {{was the only one}} to sport a metal plaque stating the <b>build</b> <b>number.</b>|$|E
