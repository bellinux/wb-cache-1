500|$|Although World WarI distracted public {{attention}} from Meeker and his activities, {{he used the}} time {{to plan for the}} future. On December 29, 1919, his 89th birthday, he began work on another book, Seventy Years of Progress in Washington, which was published to favorable reviews. [...] In association with Dr. Howard R.

500|$|The plateau was undefended {{save for}} Vergor's camp, as Vaudreuil had ordered {{one of the}} French regiments to {{relocate}} {{to the east of}} the city not long before the landing. Had the immediate defenders been more numerous, the British might have been unable to deploy or even been pushed back. [...] An officer who would normally have patrolled the cliffs regularly through the night was unable to {{on the night of the}} 12th because one of his horses had been stolen and his two others were lame. The first notice of the landing came from a runner who had fled from Vergor's camp, but one of Montcalm's aides felt the man was mad and sent him away, then went <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed.</b> Saunders had staged a diversionary action off Montmorency, firing on the shore emplacements through the night and loading boats with troops, many of them taken from field hospitals; this preoccupied Montcalm.|$|E

500|$|The video {{begins with}} Brown singing {{alone in a}} desert {{in front of a}} sunset backdrop. It then cuts to Brown waking up in a bedroom as he notices a mysterious woman (played by Araya Nicks) walking through the first of three doors behind him. Each door is labeled with hieroglyphics in gold. During the first chorus, Brown follows the woman through the door and enters a garden maze. This scene is intercut with scenes of Brown singing in the desert. He then returns to bed as the woman walks through the second door. Brown follows her again and appears in a city in the sky. This scene is also intercut with scenes of him in the desert. During the second chorus, Brown is hit by a tidal wave which sends him <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed.</b> He then enters the third door and appears driving a vintage car in the desert. Brown drives after the woman until he hits a sign that reads [...] "Road Closed", which causes him to drive off a cliff. The video then cuts to Brown and the woman lying in bed with {{electrodes}} attached to their heads.|$|E

2500|$|The show made self-deprecating {{references}} to the theme music controversy in the episode [...] "Mr. Monk and the TV Star", where obsessed fan Marci Maven and Sharona both express distaste for the new theme music to a CSI parody called Crime Lab: SF. In the epilogue of the story, Marci implores Monk to promise her that he will never change the theme music if he ever gets his own show. When Monk agrees to the promise (only so he can go <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed),</b> the original music is heard as the scene fades to credits, and it plays through the credits.|$|E

60|$|As for me, {{when they}} were gone I crept away, dazed and bewildered enough, and went <b>back</b> <b>to</b> my <b>bed,</b> having seen and heard more than I had a mind for, as disobedient people and eavesdroppers ever do.|$|R

2500|$|After the operation, Watson {{could barely}} walk, and the tumour had {{affected}} his pituitary gland which controls hormone levels: [...] "My mood swings went from ecstatic to suicidal. I remember one night {{standing on the}} balcony, full of dark thoughts and self-pity, thinking 'God, this is f**king terrible, why me?' I went <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed,</b> couldn't sleep, got up again. I thought I'd had enough. If it hadn't been for the girls ..." [...] His energy levels were very low {{and he did not}} leave his house for two months: [...] "I couldn't deal with more than {{one person at a time}} or with multitasking and I cried easily." [...] Watson was readmitted to hospital in Manchester for tests on 6 October 2006 after complaining of dizziness, headaches and blurred vision.|$|E
2500|$|Polgár {{has rarely}} played in women's-specific tournaments or {{divisions}} {{and has never}} competed for the Women's World Championship: [...] "I always say that women should have the self-confidence that they {{are as good as}} male players, but only if they are willing to work and take it seriously as much as male players." [...] While László Polgár has been credited with being an excellent chess coach, the Polgárs had also employed professional chessplayers to train their daughters, including Hungarian champion IM Tibor Florian, GM Pal Benko, and Russian GM Alexander Chernin. Susan Polgár, the eldest of the sisters, 5½ years older than Sophia and 7 years older than Judit, {{was the first of the}} sisters to achieve prominence in chess by winning tournaments, and by 1986, she was the world's top-rated female chess player. Initially, being the youngest, Judit was separated from her sisters while they were in training. However, this only served to increase Judit's curiosity. After learning the rules, they discovered Judit was able to find solutions to the problems they were studying, and she began to be invited into the group. One evening, Susan was studying an endgame with their trainer, a strong International Master. Unable to find the solution, they woke Judit, who was asleep in bed and carried her into the training room. Still half asleep, Judit showed them how to solve the problem, after which they put her <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed.</b> László Polgár's experiment would produce a family of one international master and two grandmasters and would strengthen the argument for nurture over nature, but also prove women could be grandmasters of chess.|$|E
2500|$|The Emperor did not {{normally}} get up until noon, had brunch at about 2pm before going <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> for another rest, {{to be followed}} up by playing tennis or table tennis, riding his bicycle or his car aimlessly around {{the grounds of the}} palace or listening to his vast collection of Chinese opera records. Puyi become a devoted Buddhist, a mystic and a vegetarian, having statues of the Buddha put up all over the Salt Tax Palace for him to pray to while banning his staff from eating meat. Puyi's Buddhism led him to ban his staff from killing insects or mice, but if he found any insects or mice droppings in his food, the cooks were flogged. When Puyi went into the gardens to mediate before a statue of the Buddha, there always had to be complete silence, and as there were two loud Japanese cranes living in the garden, the emperor always had his servants flogged if the cranes made a sound. One day when out for a stroll in the gardens, Puyi found that a servant had written in chalk on one of the rocks: [...] "Haven't the Japanese humiliated you enough?" [...] When Puyi received guests at the Salt Tax Palace, he gave them long lectures on the [...] "glorious" [...] history of the Qing as a form of masochism, comparing the great Qing Emperors with himself, a miserable man living as a prisoner in his own palace. The Empress Wanrong retreated in seclusion as she became addicted to opium, and her father stopped visiting the Salt Tax Palace as he could not bear to see what she had become. Wanrong, who detested her husband, liked to mock him behind his back by performing skits before the servants by putting on dark glasses and imitating Puyi's jerky movements. During his time in Tianjin, Puyi had started wearing dark glasses at all times, as during the interwar period wearing dark glasses in Tianjin was a way of signifying one was a homosexual or bisexual.|$|E
