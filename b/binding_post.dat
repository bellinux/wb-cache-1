5000|$|The Luttrell Psalter {{measures}} 370 x 270 mm (14 1/2 {{inches by}} 10 1/2 inches). It {{is written in}} Latin and comprises 309 high-quality vellum leaves with flyleaves of paper. Most of the pages are decorated in red paint with details in gold, silver and blind. The illustrations are stamped and tooled into the paper. The manuscript has eight cords which attach the pages together securely. It is sewn together and has a modern <b>binding</b> (<b>post</b> 1929) of dark brown Morocco leather. The scribes used ruling {{as a method of}} scribing, an expensive method. The scripts are fairly large. Each frame of the manuscript has about fourteen full lines of text. The strokes of the letters are flat and parallel to the writing line. This technique required a pen on which the nib is cut at an especially oblique angle, a [...] "strange pen". Unlike earlier illuminated manuscripts, the first letter of the first word on the line, for every two lines then other lines, are capitalized. Its style has many highlights and shadowing on the human figures, and its modelling of the human figure was more pronounced, muscular, and full of flesh.|$|E
40|$|Descriptive {{memorial}} of a chronograph {{made from}} a common chronoscop (Eastman Timer). The chronoscop has been modified in order to permit to adjust distinct cog-wheels, everyone in its turn, to the axis of the seconds hand. Each of these cog-wheels holds a definite number of teeth accordingly with the time interval ones desire to record. A wheel with 20 teeth, for instance, is available for recording time in periods of each three seconds, another wheel with 6 teeth, will reckon time in intervals of 10 seconds and so on. These wheels may be interchanged most easily, which enables, with the same apparatus, to have at hand a time recorder for any time interval between one and sixty seconds. To register the time the apparatus is connected with a dry cell. A wire {{is attached to a}} <b>binding</b> <b>post</b> on the metal case of the apparatus, another wire being connected with an isolated <b>binding</b> <b>post</b> placed in front of the cog-wheel and fastened to a platinum point allowing open or shut the circuit, every time one of the cogs of the wheel comes into contact with this platinum point. A signal magnet is placed also in the circuit for writing the time intervals on the revolving drum...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE Seminal {{pathogens}} can bind specifically or nonspecifically to spermatozoa, rendering semen {{decontamination procedures}} ineffective, whereby vertical or horizontal {{transmission of the}} infection could occur. Serine proteases have been demonstrated to effectively inactivate viruses and to break pathogen-sperm bonds. However, {{the addition of a}} protease to density gradient layers during semen processing could negatively impact on sperm parameters. This study investigated the effect of the addition of a recombinant, human-sequence protease (rhProtease) on sperm parameters during density gradient centrifugation. METHODS (i) Pooled semen samples (n 09) were split and processed by density gradient centrifugation, with the top density layers supplemented, or non-supplemented with rhProtease at three different concentrations (diluted 2, 10 and 20 times). Sperm parameters were then analysed by flow cytometry and computer-assisted semen analyses. (ii) Semen samples (n 05) were split and similarly processed using PureSperm® Pro, with rhProtease in the 40 % density gradient layer, or standard PureSperm® not supplemented with rhProtease (Nidacon, International) respectively. The Hemizona assay was then utilized to compare sperm-zona <b>binding</b> <b>post</b> processing. RESULTS Evaluation of sperm parameters indicated that rhProtease did not, at any of the tested concentrations, have an impact on (i) mitochondrial membrane potential, vitality, motility, or (ii) zona binding potential. CONCLUSION We report that the addition of rhProtease to density gradients is a non-detrimental approach that could improve the effectiveness of semen processing for the elimination of seminal pathogens, and benefit assisted reproduction outcome.

40|$|We have {{synthesized}} a model local anesthetic (LA), N-(2 -di-N-butyl- aminoethyl) - 4 -azidobenzamide (DNB-AB), {{containing the}} photoactivatable aryl azido moiety, {{which is known}} to form a covalent bond to adjacent molecules when exposed to UV light (Fleet, G. W., J. R. Knowles, and R. R. Porter. 1972. Biochemical Journal. 128 : 499 - 508. Ji, T. H. 1979. Biochimica et Biophysica Acta. 559 : 39 - 69). We studied the effects of DNB-AB on the sodium current (INa) under whole-cell voltage clamp in clonal mammalian GH 3 cells and on 3 [H]-BTX-B binding to sheep brain synaptoneurosomes. In the absence of UV illumination, DNB-AB behaved similarly to known LAs, producing both reversible block of peak INa (IC 50 = 26 microM, 20 degrees C) and reversible inhibition of 3 [H]-BTX- B (50 nM {{in the presence of}} 0. 12 microgram/liter Leiurus quinquestriatus scorpion venom) binding (IC 50 = 3. 3 microM, 37 degrees C), implying a noncovalent association between DNB-AB and its receptor(s). After exposure to UV light, both block of INa and inhibition of 3 [H]-BTX-B binding were only partially reversible (INa = 42 % of control; 3 [H]-BTX-B binding = 23 % of control) showing evidence of a light-dependent, covalent association between DNB-AB and its receptor(s). In the absence of drug, UV light had less effect on INa (post exposure INa = 96 % of control) or on 3 [H]-BTX-B <b>binding</b> (<b>post</b> exposure binding = 70 % of control). The irreversible block of INa was partially protected by coincubation of DNB-AB with 1 mM bupivacaine (IC 50 = 45 microM, for INa inhibition at 20 degrees C, Wang, G. K., and S. Y. Wang. 1992. Journal of General Physiology. 100 : 1003 - 1020), (post exposure INa = 73 % of control). The irreversible inhibition of 3 [H]-BTX- B binding also was partially protected by coincubation with bupivacaine (500 microM, 37 degrees C) (post exposure binding = 51 % of control), suggesting that the site of irreversible inhibition of both INa and 3 [H]-BTX-B binding is shared with the clinical LA bupivacaine...|$|E

50|$|Early speaker cable was {{typically}} stranded copper wire, insulated with cloth tape, waxed paper or rubber.
