25|$|The {{relationship}} between the <b>binding</b> <b>problem</b> and multisensory perception {{can be thought of}} as a question – the <b>binding</b> <b>problem,</b> and potential solution – multisensory perception. The <b>binding</b> <b>problem</b> stemmed from unanswered questions about how mammals (particularly higher primates) generate a unified, coherent perception of their surroundings from the cacophony of electromagnetic waves, chemical interactions, and pressure fluctuations that forms the physical basis of the world around us. It was investigated initially in the visual domain (colour, motion, depth, and form), then in the auditory domain, and recently in the multisensory areas. It can be said therefore, that the <b>binding</b> <b>problem</b> is central to multisensory perception.|$|E

25|$|The Mark 6's contact {{exploder}} mechanism {{descended from}} the Mark 3 contact exploder. Both exploders had the unusual feature that the firing pin's travel was perpendicular to the torpedo's travel, so the firing pin {{would be subject to}} side loading when the torpedo struck its target. The Mark 3 exploder was designed when torpedo speeds were much slower (the Mark 10 torpedo's speed was 30 knots), but even then the Mark 3 prototypes had problems with the firing pin binding during the high deceleration when the torpedo collided with the target. The solution was to use a stronger firing spring to overcome the binding. The Mark 14 torpedo had a much higher speed (46 knots), so it would see significantly higher deceleration, but BuOrd apparently just assumed the contact exploder would work at the higher speed. There were no live-fire tests of the Mark 14 torpedo, so there were no-live fire tests of its contact exploder. If BuOrd had tried some live-fire tests of the contact exploder during peacetime, it probably would have experienced some duds and rediscovered the <b>binding</b> <b>problem.</b>|$|E
500|$|Another {{idea that}} has drawn {{attention}} {{for several decades}} is that consciousness is associated with high-frequency (gamma band) oscillations in brain activity. [...] This idea arose from proposals in the 1980s, by Christof von der Malsburg and Wolf Singer, that gamma oscillations could solve the so-called <b>binding</b> <b>problem,</b> by linking information represented {{in different parts of}} the brain into a unified experience. [...] Rodolfo Llinás, for example, proposed that consciousness results from recurrent thalamo-cortical resonance where the specific thalamocortical systems (content) and the non-specific (centromedial thalamus) thalamocortical systems (context) interact in the gamma band frequency via synchronous oscillations.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the large}} amount of {{information}} available, many important aspects of perception remain mysterious. A great deal is known about low-level signal processing in sensory systems, but the ways by which sensory systems interact with each other, with [...] "executive" [...] systems in the frontal cortex, and with the language system are very incompletely understood. At a deeper level, there are still basic conceptual issues that remain unresolved. [...] Many scientists have found it difficult to reconcile the fact that information is distributed across multiple brain areas with the apparent unity of consciousness: this is one aspect of the so-called <b>binding</b> <b>problem.</b> There are also some scientists who have expressed grave reservations about the idea that the brain forms representations of the outside world at all: influential members of this group include psychologist J. J. Gibson and roboticist Rodney Brooks, who both argued in favor of [...] "intelligence without representation".|$|E

Criticality aware task schedulers can benefit from these opportunities by scheduling tasks to the most appropriate cores. However, these schedulers may suffer from priority inversion and static <b>binding</b> <b>problems</b> that limit their expected improvements. Based on the observation that task criticality information can be exploited to drive hardware reconfigurations, we propose a Criticality Aware Task Acceleration (CATA) mechanism that dynamically adapts the computational power of a task depending on its criticality. As a result, CATA achieves significant improvements over a baseline static scheduler, reaching average improvements up to 18. 4...|$|R

2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, some scientists, like Andrei Linde, have {{considered}} that consciousness, like spacetime, might {{have its own}} intrinsic degrees of freedom, and that one's perceptions may be as real as (or even more real than) material objects.

Electromagnetic theories of consciousness solve the <b>binding</b> <b>problem</b> of consciousness in saying that the electromagnetic field generated by the brain is the actual carrier of conscious experience, there is however disagreement about the implementations of such a theory relating to other workings of the mind.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an heuristic method {{to solve the}} combined resource selection and <b>binding</b> <b>problems</b> for the high-level synthesis of multiple-precision specifications. Traditionally, the number of functional (and storage) units in a datapath {{is determined by the}} maximum number of operations scheduled in the same cycle, with their respective widths depending on the number of bits of the wider operations. When these wider operations are not scheduled in such “busy ” cycle, this way of acting could produce a considerable waste of area. To overcome this problem, we propose the selection of the set of resources taking into account the only truly relevant aspect: the maximum number of bits calculated and stored simultaneously in a cycle. The implementation obtained is a multiple-precision datapath, where the number and widths of the resources are independent of the specification operations and data objects. 1...|$|R

40|$|Program {{generation}} {{is the process}} of generating code in a high-level language (e. g., C, C++, Java) to implement an abstract specification of a program. Generated programs are created by synthesizing and composing code fragments. Binding identifiers in generated code with their correct variable declarations {{has been the focus of}} a lot of research work in the context of macro-expansion (e. g., hygienic macro expansion and syntactic closures mechanisms). The common solutions include automatically maintaining identifier environments, which determine the legal bindings for an identifier. In this paper we present generation scoping: an adaptation of hygienic macro-expansion techniques to general-purpose program generation. The conceptual novelty of generation scoping lies in making identifier environments first-class objects and organizing them explicitly into directed graphs. This approach yields significant benefits: We are able to express scoping relationships independently of the structure of the generated program. This way we get a stronger tool for detecting errors in the specification of generated code. Additionally, we are able to simplify the specification by employing powerful implicit qualification. Thus, generation scoping becomes a useful layer of infrastructure for implementing software generators: it both solves <b>binding</b> <b>problems</b> and makes code specification more convenient...|$|R

5000|$|Rather than {{becoming}} more and more specific as visual processing proceeds from retina through the different visual centres of the brain, the image is partially dissected into basic features such as vertical lines, colour, speed, etc., distributed in various modules separated by relatively large distances.

50|$|Thus {{the claim}} is that when all these {{neuronal}} clusters oscillate together during these transient periods of synchronized firing, they help bring up memories and associations from the visual percept to other notions.

Examples include Lotka-Volterra population models [2] in ecology and game dynamics [3]. Similar dynamics {{has been used to}} describe various neuronal microcircuits, in particular winnerless competition (WLC) dynamics [4] {{has been the subject of}} intense recent study. For example, [5] find conditions on the connectivity scheme of the generalised Lotka-Volterra model to guarantee the existence and structural robustness of a heteroclinic cycle in the system, [6] consider generalised “heteroclinic channels”, [7] use them as a model for sequential memory and [8] suggest that they may be used to describe <b>binding</b> <b>problems.</b> One question raised by these studies is whether Lotka-Volterra type dynamics is necessary to give robust heteroclinic cycles as attractors and how these cycles relate to those found in other models [9, 10]. The purpose of this paper is to show that attracting heteroclinic cycles may be robust for a variety of reasons and appear in a variety of dynamical systems that model neural microcircuits. In doing so, we give a practical test for robustness of heteroclinic cycles within any particular context and demonstrate it in practice for several examples.|$|R

When protein folding follows anti-Arrhenius kinetics, we observe a speed limit for the number of folding transitions observed at the low temperature of interest, which depends on the maximum of the harmonic mean of the folding and unfolding transition rates at high temperature.
