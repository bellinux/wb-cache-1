5|$|After {{fulfilling}} her one-year {{commitment to}} the University of Louisville, Collins was named {{a fellow of the}} Harvard Institute of Politics' John F. Kennedy School of Government, teaching non-credit classes on leadership styles once a week. Concurrent with her position at Harvard, Collins was named to the board of regents for Midway College in 1989; the following year, she was removed from the board of regents of Southern Baptist Theological Seminary. Her removal was automatically triggered after she missed three consecutive <b>board</b> <b>meetings</b> between 1986 and 1989. In 1990, Collins accepted the presidency of Saint Catharine College in Springfield, Kentucky, becoming the first president of the small, Catholic college who was not a Dominican nun. College officials stated that Collins was recruited for the presidency to raise the college's profile.|$|E
5|$|Senior partner Anil Kumar, {{described}} as Gupta's protégé, left the firm after the allegations in 2009 and {{pleaded guilty in}} January 2010. While he and other partners had been pitching McKinsey's consulting services to the Galleon Group, Kumar and Rajaratnam reached a private consulting agreement, violating McKinsey's policies on confidentiality. Gupta was convicted in June 2012 of four counts of conspiracy and securities fraud, and acquitted on two counts. In October 2011, he was arrested by the FBI on criminal charges of sharing insider information from these confidential <b>board</b> <b>meetings</b> with Rajaratnam. At least twice, Gupta used a McKinsey phone to call Rajaratnam and retained other perks — an office, assistant, and $6 million retirement salary that year — as a senior partner emeritus.|$|E
5|$|Smallpeice {{arrived back}} in London during March 1964 and {{returned}} to meet with Cobbold, informing him of the offer with Cunard, a position which initially would be the management of Cunard's London operation, with a trip to Cunard's headquarters in Liverpool {{once a week for}} management and <b>board</b> <b>meetings.</b> Cobbold also had a job offer for Smallpeice, an accountancy position within the Queen's Household, a position formally to be titled Administrative Adviser. This position could be combined with the work at Cunard quite comfortably, but would preclude taking further directorships in the short term, as a result, Smallpeice was forced to turn down non-executive director positions with Charterhouse Group and Rugby Portland Cement.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{provides}} the <b>board</b> <b>meeting</b> proceedings analysis with text mining. Corporate management is executed {{based upon the}} decision made by the <b>board</b> <b>meeting</b> in general. However, the research which considered the contents of proceedings left behind the minutes of the company, and the relation of corporate profit with text mining is not enough so far. Therefore, we make an intensive research for the <b>board</b> <b>meeting</b> proceedings analysis with text mining to capture the change of the <b>board</b> <b>meeting</b> contents. As a result, the shift in the proceedings contents from short-term, store-based measures to long-term, corporate based planning coincides with the improvement of corporate performance...|$|R
