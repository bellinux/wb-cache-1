50|$|The Daniels escapement, however, {{achieves}} a double impulse with passive lever pallets serving only to lock and unlock the larger wheel. On one side, impulse {{is given by}} means of the smaller wheel acting on the lever pallet through the roller and impulse pin. On the return, the lever again unlocks the larger wheel, which gives an impulse directly onto an impulse roller on the <b>balance</b> <b>staff.</b>|$|E
50|$|Chronometers often {{included}} other innovations {{to increase}} their efficiency and precision. Hard stones such as ruby and sapphire were often used as jewel bearings to decrease friction and wear of the pivots and escapement. Diamond was often used as the cap stone for the lower <b>balance</b> <b>staff</b> pivot to prevent wear from years of the heavy balance turning on the small pivot end. Until the end of mechanical chronometer production {{in the third quarter}} of the 20th century, makers continued to experiment with things like ball bearings and chrome-plated pivots.|$|E
50|$|The pivots and jewel {{bearings}} {{that support}} a watch balance wheel are fragile {{in comparison to}} the mass they must support, and without shock protection are the part of the watch most likely to be damaged under impact.

50|$|The {{escapement}} serves two purposes. First, {{it allows}} the train to advance fractionally and record the balance's oscillations. At the same time, it supplies minute amounts of energy to counter tiny losses from friction, thus maintaining {{the momentum of the}} oscillating balance. The escapement is the part that ticks. Since the natural resonance of an oscillating balance serves as the heart of a chronometer, chronometer escapements are designed to interfere with the balance as little as possible. There are many constant-force and detached escapement designs, but the most common are the spring detent and pivoted detent. In both of these, a small detent locks the escape wheel and allows the balance to swing completely free of interference except for a brief moment at the centre of oscillation, when it is least susceptible to outside influences. At the centre of oscillation, a roller on the <b>balance</b> <b>staff</b> momentarily displaces the detent, allowing one tooth of the escape wheel to pass. The escape wheel tooth then imparts its energy on a second roller on the <b>balance</b> <b>staff.</b> Since the escape wheel turns in only one direction, the balance receives impulse in only one direction. On the return oscillation, a passing spring on the tip of the detent allows the unlocking roller on the staff to move by without displacing the detent. The weakest link of any mechanical timekeeper is the escapement's lubrication. When the oil thickens through age or temperature or dissipates through humidity or evaporation, the rate will change, sometimes dramatically as the balance motion decreases through higher friction in the escapement. A detent escapement has a strong advantage over other escapements as it needs no lubrication. An impulse from the escape wheel to the impulse roller is nearly dead-beat, meaning little sliding action needing lubrication. Chronometer escape wheels and passing springs are typically gold due to the metal's lower slide friction over brass and steel.|$|E
5000|$|Slava's own {{mechanical}} movements feature two mainspring barrels coupled {{together with}} an idler gear. There are many versions of the movement including manual wind 2414 and 2428 (double date)and self-winding 2416 and 2427 (double date). The movements are quite sensitive to shocks due to thin <b>balance</b> <b>staff.</b> Other frequent problems include premature wear of rotor bearing and the clutch driving the hands (not a typical cannon pinion). Also the date indicator malfunctions are common. The movements are thus considered unreliable, especially compared to other Russian calibres. Earlier the 2nd Moscow Factory produced movements derived from an old pre-war French movement, the Lip [...] "T-15" [...] (also some Poljot movements were derived from this French brand), and produced under license (brands Pobeda and Start). In addition to that, for relative brief periods, Slava also produced its own electronic movements using tuning fork and quartz systems. Some Slava watches were produced under Sekonda brand names.|$|E
40|$|Background: Rehabilitation Care is a {{treatment}} process that involves multiple disciplines, which are affiliated with different departments and use different planning horizons. This {{often results in}} planning difficulties and long waiting lists. In order to increase efficiency the Rehabilitation Centre "Het Roessingh" in the Netherlands has introduced the concept of treatment plans. Purposes: We support Het Roessingh to make their organizational process ready for implementation of treatment plans with the managerial purpose to prospectively assess the consequences of various interventions, without experimenting on the real-world system. Methods: We use mathematical models based on techniques from Operations Research and Management Science. A simulation model is {{used to analyze the}} integral impact of proposed organizational solutions on the patient flows. Findings: First, given the number of referrals per week, a necessary number of intake slots is determined in order to satisfy the access time requirements. Second, we quantify capacity losses resulting from cancellations of interdisciplinary meetings,. Third, we conclude that several disciplines are going to form bottlenecks in patient flow once the treatment plans are implemented. Fourth, a <b>balanced</b> <b>staffing</b> rule is computed for each discipline, by which bottlenecks will be avoided and higher efficiency will be achieved,. Finally, we show that the system cannot function at demand/capacity ratios close to 100 % because disciplines affect each other. Practice Implications: A sufficient number of intake slots must be planned weekly. The interdisciplinary meetings are of great importance and must have top priority for practitioners. When the treatment plans are implemented, the proposed <b>balanced</b> <b>staffing</b> rule enables a higher efficiency than the current staffing rule. It must be accepted by the management that multidisciplinary care cannot function with 100 % efficiency, because of the necessity to buffer for variation in demand, and the interdependency between the disciplines in each patient treatment...|$|R

50|$|Photographs of the {{escapement}} {{from above}} and below in the prototype watch and a diagram of the important features are shown in the figures. As the two escape wheels A and B rotate meshed together, {{one of them is}} locked when an impulse/locking tooth, standing upright from the escape wheel, rests on the wide straight locking stone of the detent. In the figure the balance is rotating counter-clockwise and just at the point that the unlocking pallet C on the balance is about to move the detent D to release peg E on escape wheel A which is resting on the jewelled locking surface underneath the detent arm. The impulse pallet F mounted on the <b>balance</b> <b>staff</b> just below the unlocking pallet C will have moved in front of peg G whilst the balance completes its unlocking arc. When the peg E is released by the detent, the escape wheels accelerate together and peg G will deliver an impulse on the jewelled rear face of impulse pallet F. After the impulse arc, tooth H from the escape wheel B locks {{on the other end of}} the detent locking jewel which has now been moved into its path. The depth of locking is limited by a banking pin J.|$|E

As the next generation of young and emerging professionals enter the workforce in increasing numbers as the Baby Boomer generation begins to retire, it has been forecasted that the non-profit sector, specifically, will begin to see a growing ‘leadership deficit. ’ With that said, what are the common factors driving away the next generation of non-profit leaders? What recommendations can be made to non-profits so that they may better prepare themselves for their own ‘leadership deficit?’ Furthermore, if these factors continue to exist, then how can the third sector continue to thrive and hold its own in the ‘war for talent ’ with for-profit and government entities? The following research takes an in-depth look at the driving forces of the non-profit sector and their effects on the long-term career plans of up-and-coming talent.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe United States Marine Corps (USMC) has 156, 000 active duty enlisted Marines and annually orders over 90, 000 {{of them to}} permanently change station. The Commandant of the Marine Corps requires assignments of the "Right Marine, {{to the right place}} with the right skills and quality of life. " USMC manpower planning uses staffing goals (billet requirements) to capture the Commandant's requirements, but, surprisingly, does not monitor how many Marines fill appropriate staffing goal billets. This thesis finds that although the staffing goals are completely achievable, only 45 % of active duty Marines fill a staffing goal billet and 47 % of staffing goal billets are under-staffed. The USMC has used the Enlisted Assignment Model (EAM) since the 1970 s to help enlisted monitors determine assignments. EAM has several shortcomings. Among these, enlisted monitors reject most of EAM suggested assignments and EAM offers no measure of effectiveness to gauge the quality of its assignments. This thesis presents a network model, EAM-GLOBAL to optimize the by-name assignment of Marines to staffing goal billets.

The AWCI hosts the largest online repair directory connecting consumers with local repair professionals who are AWCI members, however {{this does not include}} all local repair professionals. Horological Times, the official publication of AWCI, is currently the only monthly horological magazine serving the U.S. market (2011). The Institute is supported by numerous local affiliate chapters around the nation. AWCI also offers books and media on timekeeping topics to members and the general public.Continuing education and certification in certain areas of watchmaking and clock making are offered by AWCI. Several current (as of 2011) watch-related courses provided include: Basic Quartz Watch Repair, Modern Automatic Watches, <b>Balance</b> <b>Staffing</b> and Timing, Polishing and Waterproof Testing, Modern Mechanical Chronograph and more. These courses are conducted at the AWCI Marvin E. Whitney Academy of Watchmaking in Harrison, Ohio. Clockmaker courses can be scheduled by request. AWCI was organized in 1960 as the American Watchmakers Institute (AWI). This was the nation's first unified horological organization. It combined the members of the United Horological Association of America (UHAA) with those of the Horological Institute of America (HIA) to form AWI.

40|$|Before {{outlining}} our {{two approaches}} to incorporating legal theory into classic law subjects, some further general points are in order. First, law teachers {{should not expect}} to cover all of the material associated with a particular subject {{or all of the}} questions that could be asked about it. Just as we want students to do a fairly wide range of subjects so we want them to be confronted by a range of questions and theoretical answers to them. However, just as we do not attempt to teach every area of law in a single undergraduate law subject, so we would not attempt to pose all the theoretical questions about law nor attempt to use all the theoretical answers in a single subject. Both are tasks that can and should only be addressed by the law school as a whole rather than in individual subjects. Individual academics should ask the questions that are of interest to them and which the theory of law to which they adhere (be it a standard theory or idiosyncratic) tells them is important. This {{is not to say that}} we should all be autonomous islands in the choice of questions and theoretical answers. Some communication and cooperation between staff is necessary to ensure that students are exposed to a wide range of questions and theoretical answers to them. But this is no different from any other problem in designing the curriculum. The classic subject areas such as torts, contract, property have to be parcelled up and allocated among the staff. Not everyone can teach their favourite subjects, but the interests of a well <b>balanced</b> <b>staff</b> mean that most can teach most of those areas of law in which they are interested. As it is with the familiar division of traditional subjects, so it is with the division of theoretical elements in the curriculum...|$|R

40|$|Management of many Czech enterprises, {{especially}} SMEs, is able {{to respond}} flexibly to the current changes in their surroundings while using mainly {{the quality of its}} employees to gain a competitive advantage. Ever increasing is thus the importance of personal dispositions, skills and knowledge of employees that affect their work performance. It is undisputed that staff of the enterprise strongly influences all business operations, however, the measurement of these impacts is problematic, as they are mostly the so called soft factors. In terms of supporting the overall economic results of the company as well as in terms of ensuring employee satisfaction, it is, inter alia, very important to ensure the balance between the dispositions of a worker and his/her job function.

Most PAs have analysed poverty {{in terms of the}} constraints that prevent the poor from participating in labour intensive growth, with little appreciation of sociological and political factors involved. Most PERs have concentrated on three issues: increasing the share of the education and health sectors within total public expenditure, the composition of spending within these sectors and the <b>balance</b> between <b>staff</b> and non?staff costs. However, increased budgetary allocations to the social sectors often do not get translated into reality because of poor management and monitoring of public expenditure. In addition, the use of cash budgeting to eliminate fiscal deficits in line with IMF conditionality works against World Bank conditionality aimed at increasing spending in priority social sectors. Greater integration of PAs and PERs should be promoted by estimating the net impact of government expenditure and taxation/user charges on the poor.

Therefore the better implementation of their preferences into the scheduling problem might not only rise the work-life balance of doctors and nurses, but also may result into better patient care. This paper focuses on optimization of medical staff preferences considering the scheduling problem. Methodology/Approach: We propose a medical staff scheduling algorithm based on simulated annealing, a well-known method from statistical thermodynamics. We define hard constraints, which are linked to legal and working regulations, and minimize the violations of soft constraints, which {{are related to the}} quality of work, psychic, and work-life <b>balance</b> of <b>staff.</b> Findings: On a sample of 60 physicians and nurses from gynecology department we generated monthly schedules and optimized their preferences in terms of soft constraints.
