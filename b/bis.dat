40|$|Although Business Intelligence (<b>BI)</b> {{is highly}} {{promoted}} and praised, organisations implementing a <b>BI</b> solution {{do not always}} achieve expected benefits. Instead, numerous reports of failed <b>BI</b> implementations and challenges prevail. Even organisations indicating they receive benefit from their <b>BI</b> solutions strive for improvement in <b>BI.</b> This highlights a need for <b>BI</b> to improve and for it to overcome its challenges. In response, this thesis proposes a paradigm shift for <b>BI.</b> It provides a literature and case study, representing an interpretive enquiry using a qualitative research approach. The case study is set within a large South African bank, extending to <b>BI</b> vendors providing <b>BI</b> solutions to the bank. Two scenarios are {{used to compare the}} views of <b>BI</b> providers and <b>BI</b> customers. In one scenario, the bank’s internal <b>BI</b> departments represent the <b>BI</b> provider view, providing <b>BI</b> to other departments within the bank as their <b>BI</b> customers. In the other scenario, the <b>BI</b> vendors represent the <b>BI</b> provider view and the <b>BI</b> customer view is represented by the bank’s <b>BI</b> departments as well as other internal bank departments – who are also the <b>BI</b> customers of the <b>BI</b> departments. The thesis starts by identifying <b>BI’s</b> prevailing challenges, highlighting the restrictive tendency evident within <b>BI</b> literature and practice whereby typical Information System (IS) challenges are raised as <b>BI</b> challenges. Challenges are then examined to understand their BI-specific aspects and to identify a list of <b>BI’s</b> prevailing challenges. The thesis then examines current measures proposed to address <b>BI’s</b> challenges, establishing that these are largely ineffective. Rather than attempt to resolve <b>BI’s</b> challenges {{in the same manner as}} previous attempts do, this thesis then analyses <b>BI</b> at a conceptual level to reveal a common worldview of <b>BI</b> held by <b>BI</b> practitioners and academics. It is identified that this common worldview is predominantly based on a Goods-Dominant (G-D) Logic, resulting in many of <b>BI’s</b> challenges. A suggestion is made to shift this worldview to a Service-Dominant (S-D) Logic. Although S-D Logic is not a new lens, it has not yet been explicitly applied to <b>BI</b> or a BI-related discipline at a conceptual level, offering the opportunity to examine <b>BI</b> from a new perspective wherein new insights to address <b>BI’s</b> persistent challenges emerge.

But not all the <b>BI</b> initiatives are successful. This paper posits that a key antecedent of <b>BI</b> success is having the right <b>BI</b> Capabilities, and right <b>BI</b> Capabilities depend on the Decision Environment in which the <b>BI</b> is used.

Methods: 374 consecutive <b>BI</b> patients (231 men and 143 women) were admitted to our &shy;department between 2007 and 2008. Recurrent <b>BI</b> {{was defined as a}} prior history of <b>BI.</b> &shy;Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk profile, stroke mechanism subtypes and Bamford subtypes were compared between the first <b>BI</b> and the recurrent <b>BI</b> group. CVD risk factors, stroke subtypes of the first <b>BI</b> and preventative medication were analyzed in recurrent <b>BI</b> patients. Results: Recurrent <b>BI</b> existed in 72 patients (40 men and 32 women). Age of the recurrent <b>BI</b> group was significantly older than the first <b>BI</b> group (P &lt; 0. 01). In comparison to the first <b>BI</b> group, the recurrent <b>BI</b> group had a high frequency of hypertension (P &lt; 0. 01) and CVD comorbidity (P &lt; 0. 05). Recurrent rates were increased significantly in cardioembolic patients as compared to the first <b>BI</b> patients (P &lt; 0. 05). Bamford <b>BI</b> subtypes did not differ between both groups. Mean recurrent interval (SD) was 3. 1 (2. 3) years. Approximately half the patients experienced recurrent <b>BI</b> less than 2 years after the first <b>BI.</b> Antiplatelet agents were used in 33 patients and warfarin was used in 12 patients as preventative medication.

Organizations require technical capabilities to achieve <b>BI</b> success (Işık et al. 2013). Although most <b>BI</b> systems integration, information delivery and analysis techniques have already been incorporated into the commercial <b>BI</b> and analytics platforms offered by Microsoft, IBM, Oracle etc. (Schlegel et al. 2013), the greatest challenge for most organizations is not technology, but rather the ability to apply or application of new technologies (McKenney et al. 1995). Previous studies have shown that investment in information technology has not yielded clear benefits in the context of transitional economies (Samoilenko 2008; Osei-Bryson and Ko 2004). Additionally, numerous academics and practitioners have evaluated the outcomes of <b>BI</b> implementation. Unsurprisingly, evaluation results regarding the contribution of <b>BI</b> to organizational performance have been inconsistent (e.g., Jourdan et al. 2008; Chaudhuri et al. 2011; Elbashir et al. 2013; Rubin and Rubin 2013; Brands 2014). While <b>BI</b> success remains unrealized in numerous organizations, this study sought to provide a direction to improve the implementation performance of <b>BI</b> solutions through effective management of the BISE. More importantly, from monitoring to mastering, the critical predictive indicators of the BISE are essential to <b>BI</b> success. If those indicators could be effectively managed by constructing prediction models and rules for assessing the BISE in the <b>BI</b> implementation, <b>BI</b> performance might improve.
