Seismic design of precast reinforced concrete structures requires improved beam-column connections to transfer reversed load effects between structural elements.

40|$|The recent {{earthquakes}} in Christchurch {{have made}} it clear that issues exist with current RC frame design in New Zealand. In particular, beam elongation in RC frame buildings was widespread and resulted in numerous buildings being rendered irreparable. Design solutions to overcome this problem are clearly needed, and the slotted beam is one such solution. This system has a distinct advantage over other damage avoidance design systems in that it can be constructed using current industry techniques and conventional reinforcing steel. As the name suggests, the slotted beam incorporates a vertical slot along part of the beam depth at the beam-column interface. Geometric beam elongation is accommodated via opening and closing of these slots during seismically induced rotations, while the top concrete hinge is heavily reinforced to prevent material inelastic elongation. Past research on slotted beams has shown that the bond demand on the <b>bottom</b> <b>longitudinal</b> reinforcement is increased compared with equivalent monolithic systems. Satisfying this increased bond demand through conventional means may yield impractical and economically less viable column dimensions. The same research also indicated that the joint shear mechanism was different to that observed within monolithic joints and that additional horizontal reinforcement was required as a result. Through a combination of theoretical investigation, forensic analysis, and database study, this research addresses the above issues and develops design guidelines. The use of supplementary vertical joint stirrups was investigated as a means of improving bond performance without the need for non-standard reinforcing steel or other hardware. These design guidelines were then validated experimentally with the testing of two 80 % scale beam-column sub-assemblies. The revised provisions for bond within the <b>bottom</b> <b>longitudinal</b> reinforcement were found to be adequate while the top longitudinal reinforcement remained nominally elastic throughout both tests. An alternate mechanism was found to govern joint shear behaviour, removing the need for additional horizontal joint reinforcement. Current NZS 3101 : 2006 joint shear reinforcement provisions were found to be more than adequate given the typically larger column depths required rendering the strut mechanism more effective. The test results were then used to further refine design recommendations for practicing engineers. Finally, conclusions and future research requirements were outlined...|$|E

From the drift level of 4 %, several thin inclined cracks appeared in the joint panel zone and in the beam for a negative direction of loading.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{experimental}} {{validation of}} the concept of selective weakening (SW) for seismic retrofit of existing pre- 1970 s reinforced concrete frames is herein presented. The SW retrofit strategy is to modify the brittle inelastic mechanism to a more ductile mechanism by first weakening selected parts of the structure. Subsequently, the structure can be further upgraded to the desired strength/stiffness/ductility and energy dissipation capacity. Different levels of performance are achievable, from collapse prevention to damage control. For a beam-column (bc) joint, the proposed SW retrofit involves severing the <b>bottom</b> <b>longitudinal</b> reinforcement of the beam, and if required, adding external post-tensioning tendons. In this paper, the experimental implementation of the SW retrofit for poorly detailed exterior bc joint subassemblies is presented. Four 2 / 3 scaled exterior bc joint subassemblies are used to investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of selective weakening retrofit. Generally, the experimental results confirm previous numerical findings of the viability of SW retrofit to improve seismic performance of existing bc joints. By reducing the shear demand through beam weakening and/or increasing the joint capacity by adding horizontal axial load from external post-tensioning, the local inelastic mechanism is concentrated to a ductile flexural beam hinge, thus achieving the desirable weak-beam strong column/joint global mechanism.

40|$|A {{summary of}} the current {{research}} towards the development and validation of a counter-intuitive seismic retrofit strategy for non-ductile reinforced concrete (RC) frames, termed as selective weakening (SW) retrofit, is herein presented. The SW retrofit is conceived with the aim for wide-implementation, economical, and noninvasive structural retrofit solution for non-ductile (pre- 1970 s) RC frame structures. Contrary to the misconception that seismic retrofit must involved strengthening (force-based approach) SW retrofit relies upon targeted weakening of structural elements {{in order to achieve}} a ductile failure mechanism, thus explicitly enforcing capacity design philosophy within a displacement-based retrofit strategy. In this research, the SW retrofit is implemented to RC frames and more specifically to exterior beam-column (b-c) joints. The <b>bottom</b> <b>longitudinal</b> reinforcements of the beam are cut at the interface with the column and/or external horizontal pre-stressing is applied to the joint. A more desirable inelastic mechanism can be attained within the b-c connection, leading to improved global seismic performance for the RC frame. Experimental validations of the SW retrofit solution of exterior b-c joints are summarized to complement the conceptual development of the SW retrofit. Insights from quasi-static tests on nine 2 / 3 -scaled exterior b-c joint sub-assemblies (with and without retrofit) are discussed in respect to different retrofitting and as-built parameters. Lastly, a simple hand-calculation retrofit design procedure for a SW retrofit on b-c joints is presented.

40|$|The {{development}} of cheap, whilst effective and relatively non-invasive structural retrofit techniques for existing non-ductile reinforced concrete (RC) structures still {{remains the most}} challenging issue for a wide implementation on a macro scale. Seismic retrofit is too often being confused as purely structural strengthening. As part of a six-years national project on “Seismic retrofit solutions for NZ multi-storey building”, focus has been given at the University of Canterbury on the {{development of}} a counter-intuitive retrofit strategy for earthquake vulnerable existing rc frame, based on a “selective weakening ” (SW) approach. After an overview of the SW concept, this paper presents the experimental and numerical validation of a SW retrofit strategy for earthquake vulnerable existing RC frame with particular focus on the exterior beam-column (b-c) joints. The exterior b-c joint is a critically vulnerable region in many existing pre- 1970 s RC frames.

40|$|International audienceUnderstanding estuarine {{sediment}} dynamics, {{and particularly}} turbidity maximum dynamics, {{is crucial for}} the management of these coastal systems. Various processes impact the formation, movement and structure of the turbidity maximum. Several studies have shown that tidal asymmetry and density gradients are responsible for the presence of this suspended sedimentary mass. The Charente estuary is a highly turbid system (with suspended sediment concentrations mostly in excess of 5 g/L) that remains poorly understood, despite its strong impact on local activities. In this study, a three-dimensional hydrosedimentary model is developed to represent the sediment dynamics of this estuary. Model validation demonstrates good accuracy, especially on reproducing semi-diurnal and spring-neap variability. Several simulations are performed to evaluate the influence of tides and river discharge on the turbidity maximum. Mean and maximum suspended sediment concentrations (S S C) and sediment stratification, are calculated. S S C transects are also used to visualise the suspended sediment distribution along the estuary. The turbidity maximum generally oscillates between the river mouth and the Rochefort area (20 - 30 km upstream). The model shows strong variations at different time scales, and demonstrates that S S C is mainly driven by deposi-tion/resuspension processes. Spring-neap comparisons show that the turbidity maximum is not well-defined during neap tides, for low and mean runoff conditions. Simulations of spring tides and/or high runoff conditions all result in a compact suspended sedimentary mass. Performing simulations without taking density gradients into account demonstrates that tidal asymmetry is the main mechanism leading to the formation of the turbidity maximum. However, density gradients contribute to maintaining the stability of the turbidity maximum. Vertical stratification traps sediments at the <b>bottom.</b> <b>Longitudinal</b> stratification ensures a sharper edge at the downstream limit of the suspended sedimentary mass, preventing a massive export of sediments...|$|E

Appropriately designed hybrid material systems benefit from the performance and durability advantages of FRP materials yet remain more cost effective than comparable all-composite systems. Development of rapid rehabilitation systems for the decks of concrete box girder bridges, which are increasingly common throughout the United States, is presented. One goal {{of this research is}} to assess and validate the use of FRP composite panels for use as both stay-in-place formwork and as the <b>bottom</b> <b>longitudinal</b> and transverse reinforcement in the deck of concrete box girder bridges. Performance assessments for full-scale two -cell box girder bridge specimens through monotonic and extensive cyclic loading provided validation for the FRP panel system bridge deck as a viable rehabilitation solution for box girder bridge decks. The FRP panel system performed comparably to a conventionally reinforced concrete bridge deck in terms of serviceability, deflection profiles, and system level structural interaction and performed superior to the RC bridge deck in terms of residual deflections, and structural response under cyclic loading. Assessment of a damaged FRP panel bridge deck system, which was repaired using a resin injection technique, showed superior performance for the repaired system in terms of integrity of the FRP panel interface and cyclic response. Rapid rehabilitation techniques for strengthening reinforced concrete box girder bridge deck overhangs using near-surface-mounted (NSM) carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) were also evaluated. Analytical predictions of load carrying capacity and deflections provided correlation with experimental results, and the developed analysis methods provide an effective design tool for future research. Results from the laboratory testing of a bridge deck overhang strengthened with FRP showed significant increases in load carrying capacity as well as deformation capacity as compared to the as-built specimen without FRP.

40|$|Ductile {{plastic hinge}} zones in beams of {{reinforced}} concrete frames {{are known to}} incur extensive damage and elongate. This ‘beam elongation’ can inflict serious damage to adjacent floor diaphragms, raising concerns of life safety. In light of this, the slotted reinforced concrete beam was investigated as a promising non-tearing floor substitute for conventional design. It consists of a conventional reinforced concrete beam, modified with a narrow vertical slot adjacent to the column face, running approximately three-quarters of the beam depth. Seismic rotations occur about the remaining concrete “top-hinge”, such that deformations are concentrated in the bottom bars of the beam, away from the floor slab, and beam elongation is minimised. The inclusion of the slot raised several design issues which needed to be addressed. These were the shear transfer across the top-hinge, buckling of <b>bottom</b> <b>longitudinal</b> reinforcement, low cycle fatigue, bond anchorage of reinforcement in interior joints, interior joint design, detailing with floor units and beam torsion resulting from eccentric floor gravity loads. These issues were conceptually investigated in this project. It was found that most issues could be resolved by providing additional reinforcement and/or specifying alternative detailing. As part of the experimental investigation, quasi-static cyclic tests were performed on in-plane beam-column joint subassemblies. Specimens tested included exterior and interior joint subassemblies with slotted-beams and a conventional exterior joint as a benchmark. This {{was followed by a}} test on a slotted-beam interior joint subassembly with precast floor units and imposed gravity load. Experimental tests revealed significant reductions in damage to both the beam and floor when compared to conventional beams. Issues of bar buckling, bond-slip and altered joint behaviour were also highlighted, but were resolved in the final test. A simple analytical procedure to predict the moment-rotation response of slotted-beams was developed and verified with experimental results. This was used to perform sensitivity studies to determine appropriate limits for the concrete top-hinge depth, top-to-bottom reinforcement ratio and depth of diagonal shear reinforcement. For the numerical investigation, a multi-spring model was developed to represent the flexural response of slotted-beams. This was verified with experimental tests and implemented into a five-storey, three-bay frame for earthquake time history analyses. To provide a benchmark, a conventional frame was also setup using the plastic hinge element developed by Peng (2009). Time history analyses showed that the slotted-beam frame response was very similar to the response of a conventional frame. Due to greater hysteretic damping, there was a slight reduction in the average interstorey drift and lateral displacement envelopes. The slotted-beam frame also exhibited 40 % smaller residual drifts than the conventional frame. The research carried out in this thesis showed slotted reinforced concrete beams to be an effective non-tearing floor solution, which could provide a simple and practical substitute for conventional reinforced concrete design...|$|E

A finite element model of the existing bridge was created by using the commercial finite element software Straus 7 ®. The outcomes of an in situ experimental campaign were used to define the geometry of the BEAM and PLATE elements, as well as their material properties. A finite element model of the strengthened bridge was then developed to evaluate the increased load-carrying capacity and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique...|$|R
40|$|The bond problem {{regarding}} <b>bottom</b> reinforcing <b>longitudinal</b> continuous bars or anchorages or lapped splices of RC beams is analyzed. This is an asymmetric problem {{both for}} the geometry and the mechanics. The geometrical asymmetry {{is due to the}} difference in the extension of the concrete areas surrounding the bars: the concrete area below the horizontal plane crossing the bars' axes, and the concrete area over this plane Lip to the plane connecting the tips of the cracks. The mechanical asymmetry is due to the loading asymmetry with respect both to the above mentioned horizontal plane and to the vertical plane crossing the beam at the midspan of two consecutive cracks, Whenever a moment gradient exists, the equilibrium of the beam bottom portion bounded by two consecutive transversal cracks needs that the horizontal components of shear stress, acting on the plane connecting the tips of the cracks, balance the forces gradient acting along the bar. However, these components of shear stress have never been considered until now. The analytical solution to bond problems under asymmetrical conditions is worked out. Long and short anchorages are considered. Comparisons between 132 experimental results and values calculated by means of the proposed asymmetrical solution and an available symmetrical one are performed. The proposed Solution provides more accurate and consistent predictions than the symmetrical unreliable one, and it is useful for studying serviceability behavior of reinforced concrete members.
