50|$|The <b>blackfin</b> <b>snapper</b> (Lutjanus buccanella) is {{a species}} of snapper native to the western Atlantic Ocean {{including}} the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea. It is a commercially important species, though {{it has been reported}} to carry the ciguatera toxin.|$|E
40|$|The inshore {{environment}} of Broward County, Florida {{consists of three}} reef tracts, each separated by sand substrate, running parallel to the coastline in sequentially deeper water. A wide variety of artificial reef designs have been deployed in Broward County, many lying in sand flats between the reeftracts. From 1995 through 2002, over 1, 100 visual fish censuses (predominantly point-counts) were completed on the three natural reeftracts in water depths from 3 m to 30 m and over 1, 100 censuses were done on artificial reefs at depths of 7 m to 23 m. Curiously, the juvenile stages of two deeper-water species of the snapper/grouper complex, the <b>blackfin</b> <b>snapper</b> (Lutjanus buccanella) and the snowy grouper (Epinephelus niveatus), appear to prefer artificial reefs located in the sand flat separating {{the second and third}} reeftracts to nearby natural reef areas. Five hundred and forty <b>blackfin</b> <b>snapper</b> have been recorded in 64 visual censuses and nine snowy grouper have been observed in seven counts on artificial reefs. Despite the large volume of visual census data collected thus far, these two species have never been recorded on nearby natural reef tracts. The reasons for this unanticipated observation is unclear but it provides an excellent launch-point for an examination of juvenile habitat requirements, natural availability of these requirements, and the potential for artificial substrate to be used in managing these species...|$|E
