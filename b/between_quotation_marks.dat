Over time I continued exploring the possibilities of this brilliant comparison and expanding on the idea, which is turning out to be more serious and useful than I had expected. For me a [...] "nobela" [...] melds all of the heteroglossic elements that modern fiction either ignores or puts <b>between</b> <b>quotation</b> <b>marks.</b> All of this [...] "noise" [...] —and by [...] "noise" [...] I mean anything from bastardized spellings to colloquial mistakes and any kind of slang or language that is usually avoided in literature— is what a real novelist has to turn to if he wants to revitalize and pump new blood into a genre positioned like no other to give artistic shape to living language.|$|E

40|$|In {{a single}} short passage in 2 ̆ 2 On Sense and Reference 2 ̆ 2 Frege {{outlines}} {{his conception of}} direct quotation wherein words must not be taken as having their customary reference, but rather refer to the words themselves or the words of another speaker. What unifies these uses? What is the logical form of direct quotation sentences, and what is their analysis? How does this view fit in with Frege 2 ̆ 7 s general semantics? How far can it be extended? What problems does it face? We explore, if not completely answer, each of these questions. 2 ̆ 2 It can also happen, however, that one wishes {{to talk about the}} words themselves or their sense. This happens, for instance, when the words of another are quoted. One 2 ̆ 7 s own words then first designate words of the other speaker, and only the latter have their usual reference. We then have signs of signs. In writing, the words are in this case enclosed in quotation marks. Accordingly, a word standing <b>between</b> <b>quotation</b> <b>marks</b> must not be taken as having its ordinary reference, 2 ̆ 2 (2 ̆ 2 On Sense and Reference 2 ̆ 2, 144) The above quotation contains virtually everything Frege has to say about quotation and it raises a number of issues [...] some terminological, some substantive. First, note that in the passage cited, Frege opens with a discussion of quotation in general (2 ̆ 2 talk about 2 ̆ 2), then ends with the specific case of quotation marks in writing. Most discussions of Frege have concentrated on quotation marks in writing, and we shall do so here, but ultimately a Fregean account will have to be more general, a point we will return to later. Second, Frege speaks of words enclosed in quotation marks as about 2 ̆ 2 the words themselves 2 ̆ 2 and also as about 2 ̆ 2 words of another speaker 2 ̆ 2. But as we will see, these need not be the same. However, because Frege moved so easily between them he may have thought that referring to the words themselves is involved in reporting the words of another speaker. At least this is an idea we will exploit later, but first some terminology...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{comparative}} study in Al-Shari'a Al-Islamiya (The Islamic Law) and contemporary international {{law on the}} subject of the legality of `lq War. It must be pointed out at the outset that the term `lq War is not the precise term to apply to the subject of this thesis, and we often put this term <b>between</b> <b>quotation</b> <b>marks.</b> Other terms have been used in the United Nations Charter; and the meaning of Jihad in Al-Shari'a Al-Islamiya is not compatible with the term `lq war in international law. This thesis is divided into a Prologue, four Parts preceded by an Introductory Part and followed by an Epilogue. The Prologue deals with generalities relating to the topic presented as a necessary background for the Introductory Part. The Introductory Part entitled `lq Al-Shari'a Al-Islamiya And International Law is divided into Six Chapters. The main purpose of this Part is to explain the distinction between the principles of international law in Al-Shari'a Al-Islamiya and public international law, including the different sources and the basis of the obligatory nature of the two systems of law. Part I entitled `lq War and Legality aims to distinguish between certain conceptions in Al-Shari'a Al-Islamiya and public international law. It is divided into Five Chapters dealing with Jihad and legality in Al-Shari'a; and `lq War and legality in international law. Part II entitled `lq The Limitations Of The Legality Of War is divided into three Chapters. The First Chapters deals with the limitations of Jihad in Al-Shari'a Al-Islamiya, and explains, inter alia, the nature of relations between the Islamic State and non-Islamic States; and the legality of certain aspects of the use of force in Al-Shari'a. The Second Chapter deals with the limitations of the legality of `lq War in international law. In this Chapter, we traced the evolution of international law under the League of Nations and the United Nations, and the legality of certain aspects of the use of force in international law. The Third Chapter covers the study of the consequences of the unlawful use of force in Al-Shari'a Al-Islamiya and international law. Part III is entitled `lq The Legality Of `lq War Within The Framework Of Regional Organization. This Part is subdivided into Two Chapters. The First Chapter deals with Universalism and Regionalism in Al-Shari'a Al-Islamiya and international law. A new division of regional organizations is suggested in the Second Chapter to cope with the subject of this thesis. Thus, we divide regional organizations into three categories, regional organizations of Muslim Member States; regional Organizations of Muslim and non-Muslim Member States; and regional Organizations of non-Muslim Member States. Part IV entitled `lq The Judicial Approach To The Legality Of War is divided into Two Chapters. The First Chapter deals with the judicial approach to Muslim States. Thus, we studied the different projects to establish an Arab Court of Justice and an Islamic Court of Justice. In the Second Chapter, we studied the evolution in punishment of war crimes before the First World War, and after the First and Second World Wars. The Epilogue deals with the Conclusions of this comparative study...|$|E

40|$|A linguagem é originariamente heterogênea e, consequentemente, o discurso também o é, haja vista que não há discurso original, todos discursos são provenientes de outros discursos que dialogam entre si, influenciando uns aos outros. O discurso jornalístico, por sua vez, não foge à regra, ao contrário, nele é possível perceber um traspassamento de diversas vozes, o que comprova seu caráter heterogêneo. Recurso recorrente e que evidencia a heterogeneidade no texto jornalístico, as aspas têm, entre outras utilidades, marcar a alteridade, o discurso do outro na construção dos textos de forma a caracterizar distância entre as palavras do enunciador e o enunciado posto entre aspas, visando preservar a objetividade jornalística. As aspas também são usadas quando o enunciador quer evidenciar que uma palavra ou expressão utilizada em seu discurso é estranha a seu repertório linguístico. Também é possível que o enunciador queira demonstrar que a palavra aspeada está sendo usada num contexto diferente do usual, atribuindo-lhe um sentido diferente. E há, ainda, o aspecto irônico que também pode ser evidenciado pelas aspas. Independentemente dos motivos pelos quais são usadas, as aspas, na maioria das situações, imputarão um caráter metaenunciativo às palavras que marcam, gerando uma expectativa de interpretação cuja responsabilidade é atribuída predominantemente ao leitor. Considerando esse caráter metaenunciativo, é finalidade deste trabalho analisar as aspas sob tal aspecto, em textos jornalísticos opinativos, os editoriais. Analisaremos 133 editoriais de cada jornal, a saber: Agora São Paulo e Folha de S. Paulo, sendo que outro de nossos objetivos é observar como se constituem os editoriais na construção dos sentidos dos textos, tendo em vista o perfil dos leitores de cada jornal. Para tanto, nos utilizaremos da teoria de Authier-Revuz classificando os usos encontrados de acordo com as não-coincidências do dizer. Language is {{originally}} heterogeneous and, consequently, {{the discourse}} is as well, considering {{that there is}} no original discourse, since all discourses come from other discourses that interact with and influence each other. The journalistic discourse, in turn, is no exception, on the contrary, it is possible to perceive several voices trespassing it, which proves its heterogeneous character. As a recurring resource that highlights the heterogeneity into the news text, among other uses, the quotes can mark the otherness, the discourse of others in the construction of texts in order to characterize distance between the utterer and the utterance of the words put in quotation marks to preserve the journalistic objectivity. Quotation marks are also used when the utterer wants to highlight a word or expression used in his discourse that is strange to his linguistic repertoire. It is also possible that the utterer wants to demonstrate that the word <b>between</b> <b>quotation</b> <b>marks</b> is being used in a different context than the usual one, giving it a different meaning. There is also the ironic aspect that can also be evidenced by the quotation marks. Regardless of the reasons the quotation marks are used, in most situations they feature a metaenunciative trait on the quoted words, creating an expectation of interpretation whose responsibility is attributed predominantly to the reader. Considering this metaenunciative character, the purpose of this work is to analyze the quotation marks in that aspect in the opinionated news texts called editorials. We will analyze 133 editorials from the newspapers Agora São Paulo and Folha de S. Paulo. Another of our goals is to observe how the editorials build up meanings within the texts, considering the profile of readers of each newspaper. To do so, we make use of the theory of Authier-Revuz, classifying the uses found for the non-coincidence of saying...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{aimed at}} analyzing how is currently theoretically textualized the thematic of sense construction and sense making, while phenomenon and process, within organizations. In short, it deepens into the âsense makingâ category, {{so it can}} be better assessed and studied within organizational setting. How could it be processed and under which terms analyzed? How are these studies in Brazil and worldwide? Amidst questions like these, the author elected to perform an explanatory independent bibliographic research, to strength the database that could highlight the state-of-art of this sensemaking category. The diversified range of study sources and the cultural differences between Anglo-American and Brazilian patterns recommended the usage of a transcultural sensibility for understanding issues in Brazil. Analyses were undertaken in connection with phenomenon and process as regarding to sense making, as well a brief review of current usages of sense making, sense-making and sense-making in Anglo-American academic literature. Karl Weickâs Sensemaking in organizations (1995) work was referred with his set of seven properties approach. It is obvious the entan-glement of the subject with themes from philosophy, sociology, psychology, politics, economics, ontology, phenomenology, among other areas. The complexity starts with the explanation of term âconstruÃÃo-de-sentidoâ, a neologism by the author used for sensemaking (while category designated for deeper appreciation in this study), <b>between</b> <b>quotation</b> <b>marks</b> and hy- phenated, distinguished among construÃÃo de sentido e construÃÃo do sentido. In search to furthering the understanding, the sense concept is emerged, paralleled with mean and meaning. An emphasis is placed to sense in its straightforward line to relationship, to communica- tion, and with the possibilities in relationships within organizational life. Links are made between sensemaking and strategic management, learning organizations, knowledge management, organizational theory, and organizational behavior, the later being elected for shelter of the category, despite proven its irrelevant presence it this context. The problematic is tied with abundant controversial and paradoxal situations within organizational contexts, lessened involvement of collaborators with organizational goals, and the disinterest of managers for complex aspects of human behavioral knowledge, the basic problem being the frequent human relational incoherence amidst the component parts of an organizational whole. This research aims at contributing to the discussion of the theme inside academy in Brazil, currently not sufficiently exploited, far way from general public and mangers. In addition, intends to amplify the conditions for empirical researches, diffuse e deepen the knowledge, and favor the vision of âmanage with the senseâ and administrate with sense consciousness the managerial processes. The approach of the seven characteristics compiled by Weick supports the discussion of sensemaking in organizations and is linked to HR Strategic and Technological Management, research line of this theoretical investigation. In the final considerations, the natural- ness of human cognitive process is accentuated, and questioned the expectations whether the phenomenon-process analyzed can be intentionally provoked, with social consciousness of social construction, and as a factor capable of detracting organizational ambiguities. Last, suggestions for empirical approaches are given, taking into account advantages and needs of multidisciplinary interactions, distinguishing philosophy, psychology, and sociology. Esta dissertaÃÃo objetivou analisar como se textualiza teoricamente na atualidade a temÃtica da formaÃÃo e construÃÃo do sentido, enquanto fenÃmeno e processo, no Ãmbito organizacional. Enfim, aprofundar sobre a categoria da construÃÃo-de-sentido, a fim de que possa ser melhor avaliada e estudada dentro do cenÃrio organizacional. Como poderia se processar e sob que termos ser analisada? Como se encontram os estudos nessa Ãrea no Brasil e no mundo? Diante de questÃes como estas, o autor optou por realizar uma pesquisa bibliogrÃfica exploratÃria independente, para sedimentar uma base de dados que colaborasse na revelaÃÃo do estado- da-arte desta categoria âconstruÃÃo-de-sentidoâ. O espectro diversificado das fontes de estudo e as diferenÃas culturais entre os padrÃes Anglo-Americanos e Brasileiros recomendou a utilizaÃÃo da sensibilidade transcultural para o entendimento dos conteÃdos. AnÃlises foram elaboradas em conexÃo com fenÃmeno e processo, no que diz respeito Ã temÃtica construÃÃo-de-sentidoâ, assim como uma breve revisÃo sobre os usos correntes de sense making, sensemaking e sensemaking na literatura academia Anglo-Americana. A obra de Karl Weick, Sensemaking in Organizations (1995), foi referida com sua abordagem do conjunto das sete caracterÃsticas. Ã patente o intricamento do tema com Ãreas da filosofia, sociologia, psicologia, polÃtica, economia, ontologia, antropologia, etnologia, fenomenologia, dentre outros. A complexidade inicia-se com a explicaÃÃo do termo âconstruÃÃo-de-sentidoâ, para sensemaking (enquanto categoria designada para aprofundamento destes estudos) entre aspas e com hÃfens, indicando um neologismo criado pelo autor, distinguindo-o de construÃÃo de sentido e construÃÃo do sentido. Em busca de ampliar o entendimento, o conceito sentido Ã colocado em paralelo com significado e significaÃÃo. Ãnfase se dÃ ao sentido com linha direta na relaÃÃo, com a comunicaÃÃo, com as possibilidades nas relaÃÃes nos ambientes organizacionais. VÃnculos sÃo feitos entre sensemaking e as disciplinas de gestÃo estratÃgica, organizaÃÃes de aprendizagem, gestÃo do conhecimento, teoria das organizaÃÃes e comportamento organizacional, optando-se pelo acolhimento e avaliaÃÃo do termo por parte deste Ãltimo, apesar de demonstrada sua irrelevante presenÃa neste contexto. A problemÃtica prende-se a situaÃÃes controvertidas e paradoxais abundantes nos contextos organizacionais, ao reduzido envolvimento do colaborador com os objetivos da organizaÃÃo e o desinteresse dos gestores pelos aspectos complexos do conhecimento comportamental humano, constituindo o problema bÃsico a freqÃente inadequaÃÃo relacional humana entre as partes componentes de um todo organizacional. Esta pesquisa visa contribuir Ã discussÃo do tema na academia no Brasil, insuficientemente explorado, distanciado do pÃblico geral e dos gestores. AlÃm disso, objetiva ampliar condiÃÃes para pesquisas empÃricas, difundir e aprofundar o conhecimento e favorecer a visÃo de âgerir com o sentidoâ, e administrar com consciÃncia do sentido os processos administrativos. A abordagem das sete caracterÃsticas compiladas por Weick reforÃa o tÃpico âConstruÃÃo-de-Sentidoâ em OrganizaÃÃes e vincula-se Ã linha de pesquisa GestÃo EstratÃgica e TecnolÃgica de Pessoas. Dentre as consideraÃÃes finais Ã destacada a naturalidade do processo cognitivo do homem e Ã colocada em dÃvida a expectativa de que o fenÃmeno-processo analisado possa ser intencionalmente provocado com consciÃncia da construÃÃo social e como fator redutor de ambigÃidades organizacionais. Ao final sÃo apresentadas sugestÃes para abordagens empÃricas ressaltando-se as vantagens e necessidades das interaÃÃes multidisciplinares com destaque da filosofia, psicologia e sociologia...|$|E
