5|$|As {{of early}} April 2010, more than 200 environmentalists and {{indigenous}} people gathered in Tennant Creek to oppose a radioactive waste dump <b>being</b> <b>built</b> on Muckaty Station in the Northern Territory.|$|E
5|$|Benadir University (BU) was {{established}} in 2002 {{with the intention of}} training doctors. It has since expanded into other fields. Another tertiary institution in the city is the Jamhuriya University of Science and Technology. The Turkish Boarding School was also established, with the Mogadishu Polytechnic Institute and Shabelle University campus likewise undergoing renovations. Additionally, a New Islamic University campus is <b>being</b> <b>built.</b> In April 2014, Prime Minister Abdiweli Sheikh Ahmed also laid the foundation stone for the reconstruction of the former meteorological school in Mogadishu.

5|$|One {{estimate}} is that 12,000 people were forced to move in 1999-2000 while the all-weather road was <b>being</b> <b>built</b> between Melut, Paloic and Adar.|$|E
5|$|Since 2013, Bristol {{has seen}} an {{increase}} in buildings <b>being</b> <b>built</b> or office blocks being converted for student accommodation.

5|$|The {{surviving}} Western Chalukya monuments are temples {{built in}} the Shaiva, Vaishnava, and Jain religious traditions. None of the military, civil, or courtly architecture has survived; <b>being</b> <b>built</b> of mud, brick and wood, such structures may not have withstood repeated invasions.|$|E
5|$|Then in August 2009, {{speculation}} mounted {{that the}} UK would drop the F-35B for the F-35C model, {{which would have}} meant the carriers <b>being</b> <b>built</b> to operate conventional {{take off and landing}} aircraft using the US-designed Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS) catapults.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} many large plants under {{construction}}. The Desert Sunlight Solar Farm {{under construction in}} Riverside County, California and Topaz Solar Farm <b>being</b> <b>built</b> in San Luis Obispo County, California are both 550 MW solar parks that will use thin-film solar photovoltaic modules made by First Solar. The Blythe Solar Power Project is a 500 MW photovoltaic station under construction in Riverside County, California.

5|$|Three {{advanced}} learning centres are <b>being</b> <b>built</b> {{in central}} Ashton town {{and at the}} college’s Beaufort Road home.

The first store in the new mall officially opened on April 1, 2016.|$|E
50|$|The station itself uses a {{dark gray}} and light beige colour scheme, {{employing}} cold white lighting. The station is quite small, <b>being</b> initially <b>built</b> to service a rather low-density residential area.|$|R

50|$|The {{station was}} opened on 11 September 1933, <b>being</b> {{originally}} <b>built</b> of timber. This {{was replaced by}} a concrete structure, believed to be in the 1960s. The line was singled in 1968.|$|R
5|$|A {{number of}} {{companies}} were affected by inability to reach their premises even where the premises themselves were largely unaffected by the blast. Criticism was expressed by local citizens and the local MP that originally the depot had been constructed away from other buildings, but that developmental pressures had led to both houses and commercial premises <b>being</b> <b>built</b> near the depot.|$|E
5|$|Although {{authorised}} in 1864, work on {{the bridge}} was delayed by negotiations over the proposed Chelsea Embankment, since the bridge's design could not be completed until the exact layout of the new roads <b>being</b> <b>built</b> on the north {{bank of the river}} had been agreed. While plans for the Chelsea Embankment were debated, Ordish built the Franz Joseph Bridge over the Vltava in Prague to the same design as that intended for the Albert Bridge.|$|E
5|$|Among brachiopods {{only the}} lingulids have been fished commercially, and {{only on a}} very small scale. Brachiopods seldom settle on {{artificial}} surfaces, probably because they are vulnerable to pollution.

5000|$|Earth's {{population}} {{are described in}} the first novel as [...] "so amazingly primitive that they still think digital watches are a pretty neat idea."

Hyperintelligent pan-dimensional <b>beings</b> <b>built</b> the supercomputer Deep Thought in part to comprehend why people spend so much of their lives wearing digital watches. In the 1970s, when the series was first composed, digital watches were the height of techno-fashion. For , references to digital watches were replaced by mobile telephones.|$|R

5|$|Another council plan {{during the}} 1960s was to {{separate}} pedestrians and traffic, {{and it was}} proposed that any new buildings in City Square would be built with an overhead walkway – this never came to fruition, with only a short section ever <b>being</b> <b>built.</b>|$|E
5|$|As {{the cost}} of solar {{electricity}} has fallen, the number of grid-connected solar PV systems has grown into the millions and utility-scale solar power stations with hundreds of megawatts are <b>being</b> <b>built.</b> Solar PV is rapidly becoming an inexpensive, low-carbon technology to harness renewable energy from the Sun. The current largest photovoltaic power station {{in the world is}} the 850MW Longyangxia Dam Solar Park, in Qinghai, China.|$|E
5|$|Creeks {{traverse}} the UCSC campus within several ravines. Footbridges span those ravines on pedestrian paths linking various areas of campus. The footbridges {{make it possible}} to walk to any part of campus within 20 minutes in spite of the campus <b>being</b> <b>built</b> on a mountainside with varying elevations. At night, orange lights illuminate the occasionally fogged-in paths.|$|E
50|$|All the {{buildings}} in St Andrew Street {{have a long}} history, <b>being</b> either <b>built</b> or reconstructed upon an ancient site. Numbers 58 and 60 are reputed to be the oldest, perhaps 14th century or earlier.|$|R
