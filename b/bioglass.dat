2500|$|The {{biomaterial}} term is {{used for}} materials {{that can be used}} in biomedical and clinical applications. They are bioactive and biocompatible in nature. Currently, many types of metals and alloys (stainless steel, titanium, nickel, magnesium, Co–Cr alloys, Ti alloys), ceramics (zirconia, <b>bioglass,</b> alumina, hydroxyapatite) [...] and polymers (acrylic, nylon, silicone, polyurethane, polycaprolactone, polyanhydrides) [...] are used for load bearing application. This includes dental replacement and bone joining or replacement for medical and clinical application. Therefore their mechanical properties are very important. Mechanical properties of some biomaterials and bone are summarized in table 1. Among them hydroxyapatite is most widely studied bioactive and biocompatible material. However, it has lower young’s modulus and fracture toughness with brittle nature. Hence, it is required to produce a biomaterial with good mechanical properties.|$|E
50|$|High {{bioactivity}} is {{the main}} advantage of <b>Bioglass,</b> while its disadvantages includes mechanical weakness, low fracture resistance due to amorphous 2-dimensional glass network. The bending strength of most <b>Bioglass</b> is {{in the range of}} 40-60 MPa, which is not enough for load-bearing application. Its Young's modulus is 30-35 GPa, very close to that of cortical bone, which can be an advantage. <b>Bioglass</b> implants can be used in non-load-bearing applications, for buried implants loaded slightly or compressively. <b>Bioglass</b> can be also used as a bioactive component in composite materials or as powder.

30|$|In the {{selection}} of substances, potassium salts act on the regulation of nerve transmission through the release of potassium ions in the extracellular medium, which upon reaching a concentration higher than the physiological concentration begin to induce depolarization of nerve cells, making the nerve unable {{to respond to the}} excitatory stimuli. Strontium chloride and stannous fluoride act on mechanical occlusion by the deposition and precipitation of compounds in the dentinal tubules, while substances such as arginine and active <b>bioglasses</b> act on the mechanical blockage of the tubules by the formation and deposition of natural minerals [7].|$|R
50|$|Bioceramics and <b>bioglasses</b> are ceramic {{materials}} that are biocompatible. Bioceramics are an important subset of biomaterials. Bioceramics range in biocompatibility from the ceramic oxides, which are inert in the body, to the other extreme of resorbable materials, which are eventually replaced by the body after they have assisted repair. Bioceramics are used in many types of medical procedures. Bioceramics are typically used as rigid materials in surgical implants, though some bioceramics are flexible.

30|$|Despite {{being an}} {{aminoacid}} found in saliva, arginine, when administered {{in combination with}} calcium carbonate {{in the form of}} a prophylactic paste, potentiates its natural action mechanism, facilitating the sealing of exposed dentinal tubules by depositing material similar to dentin, producing immediate and lasting desensitization [8],[9]. Among the active <b>bioglasses,</b> Biosilicate®, which by nature is an osteoconductive material, can bind chemically to the dentin surface and obliterate the tubules, preventing the movement of fluid within them and thus eliminating the cause of pain [10].

40|$|Abstract—The {{past decades}} and current R&D of {{biomaterials}} and medical implants show some general trends.

While the biomaterials of the past and those in current use are essentially bulk materials (metals, ceramics, polymers) or special compounds (<b>bioglasses),</b> possibly with some additional coating {e. g., hydroxyapatite), the current R&D on surface modifications points toward much more complex and multifunctional surfaces for the future. Such surface modifications can be divided into three classes, one aiming toward an optimized three-dimensional physical micro-architecture of the surface (pore size distributions, "roughness", etc.), the second one focusing on the (bio) chemical properties of surface coatings and impregnations (ion release, multi-laye...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Bioglass</b> 45S5, {{commonly}} referred to by its commercial name <b>Bioglass,</b> is a glass specifically composed of 45 wt% SiO2, 24.5 wt% CaO, 24.5 wt% Na2O, and 6.0 wt% P2O5. [...] Glasses are non-crystalline amorphous solids that are commonly composed of silica-based materials with other minor additives. Compared to soda-lime glass (commonly used, as in windows or bottles), <b>Bioglass</b> 45S5 contains less silica and higher amounts of calcium and phosphorus. The 45S5 name signifies glass with 45 weight % of SiO2 and 5:1 molar ratio of calcium to phosphorus. This high ratio of calcium to phosphorus promotes formation of apatite crystals; calcium and silica ions can act as crystallization nuclei. [...] Lower Ca:P ratios do not bond to bone. [...] <b>Bioglass</b> 45S5’s specific composition is optimal in biomedical applications because of its similar composition to that of hydroxyapatite, the mineral component of bone. This similarity provides Bioglass’ ability to be integrated with living bone.|$|E
40|$|Fluoride-containing {{bioactive}} {{glasses are}} attracting {{particular interest in}} many fields of dentistry and orthopedic because they combine the bone-bonding ability of bioactive glasses with the anticariogenic protection provided by fluoride ions. Since the biomedical applications of these materials critically depend on the release of ionic species in the surrounding physiological environment, a deep knowledge of their environments is required. In this paper, Density Functional Theory calculations and Spin Effective Hamiltonians have been employed to analyse the NMR signatures of the various environments of 19 F, 29 Si, 31 P and 23 Na atoms in fluorinated <b>bioglasses</b> structural models previously generated by Car-Parrinello Molecular Dynamics simulations. Comparison with experimental spectra expressly recorded in this work shows a good agreement and allows the enlightenment of some longstanding issues about the atomic structure of fluorinated <b>bioglasses,</b> such {{as the presence of}} Si-F and Si-O-P bonds. In particular, it is shown that Si-F bonds cannot be resolved by using MAS NMR experiments only, and 29 Si{ 19 F} REDOR experiments, that probes directly spatial proximities among atoms, must be employed. Our results show that F is coordinated entirely to the modifier ions Na and Ca, and that no Si-F bonds are present in the real glass structure. Thus, addition of fluorine to the 45 S 5 Bioglass® increases the polymerization of the silicate network by removing modifiers from the siliceous matrix and reducing its reactivity. Finally, the computed isotropic chemical shifts of the various environments of phosphorous show that, if present, Si-O-P bonds should be clearly noticeable in the 31 P static NMR experimental spectrum. Instead, the latter shows that P is present as isolated orthophosphate units and does not enter into the siliceous matrix by forming Si-O-P bonds as conjectured by Molecular Dynamics simulations...|$|R
40|$|Some soda-lime-phospho-silicate glasses, such as Hench’s Bioglass® 45 S 5, form bone-like apatite ontheir surface when {{bound to}} living bone. To improve their osteointegration for {{clinical}} purposes, thefluoride insertion in their structure has been proposed, but we recently showed that fluoride causesoxidative damage in human MG- 63 osteoblasts, via inhibition of pentose phosphate oxidative path-way (PPP) and its key enzyme glucose 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase (G 6 PD). In the same cells we havenow investigated {{the role of}} nitric oxide (NO) in these effects. Fluoride-containing bioactive glasses andNaF caused, as expected, release of lactate dehydrogenase in the extracellular medium, accumulation ofintracellular malonyldialdehyde, inhibition of PPP and G 6 PD: we have now observed that these effectswere significantly reverted not only by superoxide dismutase (SOD) plus catalase (scavengers of reactiveoxygen species), but also by N-monomethyl l-arginine (l-NMMA, a NOS inhibitor) and 2 -phenyl- 4, 4, 5, 5,-tetramethylimidazoline- 1 oxyl 3 -oxide (PTIO, a NO scavenger). Moreover the two highest concentrationsof both fluoride-containing <b>bioglasses</b> and NaF caused increase of nitrite (a stable derivative of NO) levelsin the culture supernatant, which was inhibited by l-NMMA, erythrocytes, PTIO and SOD/catalase, andincrease of intracellular NO synthase (NOS) activity. The incubation with <b>bioglasses</b> or NaF increasedalso the phosphorylation of Ser 1177 in the endothelial NOS isoform. Furthermore, the NO donor spermineNONOate was able to inhibit G 6 PD activity in vitro, and this effect was partly reverted by PTIO. Thereforeour results suggest that most cytotoxic effects of fluoride are mediated by the production of NO: reactiveoxygen species are important, causing NOS phosphorylation. We also observed, for the first time, thatTempol, but not SOD/catalase, besides inhibiting the oxidative stress induced by fluoride, also scavengesfluoride ions. For this reason {{it is not a}} selective inhibitor of the oxidative effects of fluoride...|$|R

40|$|In bone regeneration, silicon-based calcium {{phosphate}} glasses (<b>Bioglasses)</b> {{have been widely}} used since the 1970 s. However, they dissolve very slowly because of their high amount of Si (SiO 2 > 45 %). Recently, our group has found that calcium ions released by the degradation of glasses in which the job of silicon is done by just 5 % of TiO 2 are effective angiogenic promoters, because of their stimulation of a cell-membrane calcium sensing receptor (CaSR). Based on this, other focused tests on angiogenesis have found that <b>Bioglasses</b> also have the potential to be angiogenic promoters even with high contents of silicon (80 %); however, their slow degradation is still a problem, as the levels of silicon cannot be decreased any lower than 45 %. In this work, we propose a new generation of hybrid organically modified glasses, ormoglasses, that enable the levels of silicon to be reduced, therefore speeding up the degradation process. Using electrospinning as a faithful way to mimic the extracellular matrix (ECM), we successfully produced hybrid fibrous mats with three different contents of Si (40, 52, and 70 %), and thus three different calcium ion release rates, using an ormoglass-polycaprolactone blend approach. These mats offered a good platform to evaluate different calcium release rates as osteogenic promoters in an in vivo subcutaneous environment. Complementary data were collected to complement Ca 2 + release analysis, such as stiffness evaluation by AFM, zeta-potential, morphology evaluation by FESEM, proliferation and differentiation analysis, as well as in vivo subcutaneous implantations. Material and biological characterization suggested that compositions of organic/inorganic hybrid materials with a Si content equivalent to 40 %, which were also those that released more calcium, were osteogenic. They also showed a greater ability to form blood vessels. These results suggest that Si-based ormoglasses can be considered an efficient tool for calcium release modulation, which could {{play a key role in}} the angiogenic promoting process.

TiN and anatase transformed into rutile and some new phases generated, which often enriched at pores and cracks. In the working-layer, part of nano-hydroxyapatite powders decomposed during coating preparation. Y 2 O 3 impaired the decomposition to some extent and BG 2 enhanced greatly.
