50|$|Because of the {{scarcity}} of wetlands in lowland Durham, species associated with this habitat also have a very localised distribution. Particularly noteworthy at Pike Whin Bog are greater spearwort, Ranunculus lingua, slender tufted sedge, Carex acuta, marsh stitchwort, Stellaria palustris, and <b>bog</b> <b>bean,</b> Menyanthes trifoliata.|$|E

50|$|Near the {{northern}} end of Allonby Bay is Salta Moss. This area is a designated Site of Special Scientific Interest within the Solway Coast AONB, and includes some rare plant and animal specimens, including the <b>bog</b> <b>bean</b> Menyanthus trifoliata, and Britain's only native venomous snake, the adder.|$|E
50|$|Its flower {{hay meadow}} is an {{ecological}} relict {{with a high}} plant diversity due to the continuing centuries old practice of receiving only a cut in late season for a hay crop. In June it is coloured by yellow flag, marsh cinquefoil, <b>bog</b> <b>bean,</b> and ragged robin (a source of nectar for the adult swallowtails). In early July, there are common sorrel, the purple glass Yorkshire fog, southern marsh orchids, yellow rattle and valerian. These are followed by purple loosestrife and meadowsweet.|$|E
50|$|Heather {{grows on}} dry, sandy soils {{alongside}} paths and in clearings as do {{plants such as}} German greenweed and broom, and the rare lance-shaped bellflower, whilst by the many brooks and wet meadows acid-loving marsh plants such as bog arum, marsh cinquefoil, <b>bog</b> <b>bean</b> and bog pondweed may be seen, {{all of which are}} rare in other regions of Germany. In addition reeds, marsh willowherb, marsh marigold and meadowsweet and, in dryer places also grey willow, eared willow and alder buckthorn, illustrate the variety that may be found in the marsh meadows alongside streams and brooks.|$|E
50|$|Deadman {{is one of}} {{the best}} {{remaining}} examples of a mixed valley mire in Somerset. It contains a rich mosaic of wet heath, bog pools and birch/willow carr grading into acid marshy grassland. These communities support several species of plant which are rare in the county. Ground water issues from numerous springs within the greensand producing a locally raised water table and shallow peaty surface horizon. It is at these points that bog communities develop, characterised by the floating leaves of bog pondweed (Potamogeton polygonifolia), <b>bog</b> <b>bean</b> (Menyanthes trifoliata) and marsh St John's-wort (Hypericum elodes). In places this wet heath has undergone a transition to birch (Betula sp.) and willow (Salix sp.) carr. This provides an important habitat for breeding nightingales and grasshopper warblers.|$|E
50|$|Much of the {{afforested}} {{portion of}} the site comprises relatively young conifer trees under which there still exists a bog flora, albeit modified and species-poor. A substantial area of high quality, uplanted blanket bog also occurs within the site and this area contains many large pools. The bog vegetation is generally dominated by purple moor-grass (Molinia caerulea) and black bog-rush (Schoenus nigricans) while the blanket bog pools are characterised by a sparse flora which includes <b>bog</b> <b>bean</b> (Menyanthes trifoliata), many-stemmed spike-rush (Eleocharis multicaulis) and pipewort (Eriocaulon aquaticum). The European distribution of this latter species is confined to lakes and pools in lowland blanket bog areas of Ireland and western Scotland. This area of bog has also a well- developed Sphagnum cover including some large hummocks of Sphagnum imbricatum and S. fuscum.|$|E
