25|$|When the <b>black-chested</b> <b>buzzard-eagle</b> {{was first}} {{described}} by Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot in 1819, it {{was placed in}} the genus Spizaetus, as Spizaetus melanoleucus. Nowadays, however, the monotypic genus Spizastur is merged in Spizaetus, and the black-and-white hawk-eagle, originally described as by Vieillot three years earlier as Buteo melanoleucus, is now known as Spizaetus melanoleucus. The earlier use of the specific epithet melanoleucus for the black-and-white hawk-eagle technically precludes its use for the <b>black-chested</b> <b>buzzard-eagle,</b> except when it is placed in Geranoaetus. In fact, in the mid-20th century Buteo fuscescens was the prevailing name for the <b>black-chested</b> <b>buzzard-eagle</b> for some years, but it was eventually dismissed as erroneous. This specific name was established – as Spizaetus fuscescens – by Vieillot for the immature of the <b>black-chested</b> <b>buzzard-eagle</b> at the very same time as he described the adult, because he could not believe that such differently-colored birds were conspecific.|$|E
25|$|The <b>black-chested</b> <b>buzzard-eagle</b> {{is readily}} {{identified}} in flight by its short wedge-shaped tail scarcely protruding from its long, broad wings. It is usually {{easy to make}} out the generally white underparts with the dark chest-band and tail if the birds are adult. Yet as this bird is usually encountered in the wild when it soars, you are less likely to see its grey upperparts.|$|E
25|$|This species {{could be}} close to the white-tailed hawk (Buteo albicaudatus), and perhaps to the grey-backed (Leucopternis occidentalis), white (L. albicollis), and mantled hawks (L. polionotus) which it resembles in habitus except for being larger. Its closest living {{relatives}} may well be the red-backed (B. polyosoma) and Puna hawks (B. poecilochrous). Particularly some populations of the former look like small black-chested buzzard-eagles. The barred hawk (L. princeps) looks similar to the <b>black-chested</b> <b>buzzard-eagle</b> in general color pattern, though the tail differs much in shape, size, and the bright white central band stands out.|$|E
25|$|Bones {{indistinguishable from}} those of living <b>black-chested</b> <b>buzzard-eagles</b> were found in a spring deposit at the Baños de Ciego Montero in Cienfuegos Province, Cuba. A partial left carpometacarpus – Specimen AMNH FR 6190 – {{as well as a}} fingerbone {{probably}} date from some time in the Pleistocene, during the last ice age. Its contemporary close relatives on Cuba, as far as it is known, consisted of the gigantic eagle-like buteonine hawks which were clearly distinct by size alone, while the Pleistocene record of similar-sized birds from continental North America is from the far west.|$|R
50|$|Very often, {{there will}} be three hawks {{attending}} one nest: two males and one female. Whether {{or not this is}} polyandry is debated, as it may be confused with backstanding (one bird standing on another's back). The female does most of the incubation. The eggs hatch in 31 to 36 days. The young begin to explore outside the nest at 38 days, and fledge, or start to fly, at 45 to 50 days. The female sometimes breeds two or three times in a year. Young may stay with their parents for up to three years, helping to raise later broods. Nests are known to be predated by coyotes (Canis latrans), golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos), red-tailed hawks (Buteo jamaicensis), great horned owls (Bubo virginianus) and flocks of common ravens (Corvus corax), predators possibly too formidable to be fully displaced by the Harris's hawk's cooperative nest defenses. In Chile, <b>black-chested</b> <b>buzzard-eagles</b> (Geranoaetus melanoleucus) are likely predators.|$|R
25|$|The food of this {{carnivore}} consists {{mainly of}} mid-sized mammals; the introduced European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) {{seems to have}} become a key prey item. The <b>black-chested</b> <b>buzzard-eagle</b> is helpful to farmers by keeping down the numbers of the rabbits, which can be serious agricultural pests. Among the native fauna degus (Octodon) and hog-nosed skunks (Conepatus) are important prey, but mammals as formidable as a gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus) – two to over three times as heavy as the birds and certainly not defenceless – are occasionally hunted and killed by this hawk. Its diet is rounded off with an occasional bird – including carnivorous species like the burrowing owl (Athene cunicularia) and sizeable prey such as Penelope guans or the Chilean tinamou (Nothoprocta perdicaria) –, large squamates, and if need be also arthropods and carrion. While not aggressive under normal circumstances, the black-chested eagle-buzzard will fiercely attack humans if it considers itself or its offspring threatened. It is {{near the top of}} the avian food chain in its range, in part since it is the only Andean eagle found outside forest habitats. It may compete for carrion with the much larger Andean condor.|$|E

2500|$|The <b>black-chested</b> <b>buzzard-eagle</b> is allied to the Buteo hawks, {{and it is}} {{sometimes}} included with these. Other authors place it in the monotypic genus Geranoaetus.

2500|$|The <b>black-chested</b> <b>buzzard-eagle</b> {{is found}} in mountainous or hilly terrain with sparse vegetation, shrubland or (in the south of its range) Nothofagus forest, where it {{spends a lot of}} time soaring in {{thermals}} and vertical drafts while looking for prey. It requires large territories with suitable habitat, the páramos at the north of its range, for example, while providing the latter, fail to provide the former, and thus it has only been recorded in the largest patches of such habitat, such as Páramo de Frontino.

2500|$|It nests in high {{trees or}} on rocky cliffs, or {{if these are}} not {{available}} on high trees or even cacti.
