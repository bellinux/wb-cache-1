40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} to examine the relationships between subjective symptoms of fatigue(SSF), subjective fatigue feeling (SFF) and life habits of students. A SSF questionnaire, including subjective feelings of fatigue and life habits, was administered to adolescent students aged 15 - 20 yr. Data from 5435 subjects who responded to the questionnaire were used for statistical analysis. Students with a higher SFF tend to have more complaints of SSF, especially in males, in the relationships between SFF and symptoms <b>of</b> <b>languor</b> and drowsiness, and in females, the incidence of drowsiness and physical disintegration were high. Relationships between SFF and physical condition during the day and waking in the morning were marked in males and females. The closes relationship between life habits and SSF involved symptoms <b>of</b> <b>languor</b> in males and females. In particular, the relationship between SFF and symptoms <b>of</b> <b>languor</b> was marked. It is considered that improving the level of physical fitness, thus reducing the feeling <b>of</b> <b>languor,</b> is important. The relationship between SFF and breakfast is not marked in males and females...|$|R
