40|$|Whole <b>body</b> <b>heating</b> {{decreases}} central {{venous pressure}} (CVP) while increasing muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA). In normothermia, similar decreases in CVP elevate MSNA, presumably via cardiopulmonary baroreceptor unloading. The purpose of this project was to identify whether increases in MSNA during whole <b>body</b> <b>heating</b> {{could be attributed to}} cardiopulmonary baroreceptor unloading coincident with the thermal challenge. Seven subjects were exposed to whole <b>body</b> <b>heating</b> while sublingual temperature, skin blood flow, heart rate, arterial blood pressure, and MSNA were monitored. During the heat stress, 15 ml/kg warmed saline was infused intravenously over 7 - 10 min to increase CVP and load the cardiopulmonary baroreceptors. We reported previously that this amount of saline was sufficient to return CVP to pre-heat stress levels. Whole <b>body</b> <b>heating</b> increased MSNA from 25 +/- 3 to 39 +/- 3 bursts/min (P 0. 05 relative to heat stress period) and did not alter mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) or pulse pressure. To identify whether arterial baroreceptor loading decreases MSNA during heat stress, in a separate protocol MAP was elevated via steady-state infusion of phenylephrine during whole <b>body</b> <b>heating.</b> Increasing MAP from 82 +/- 3 to 93 +/- 4 mmHg (P < 0. 05) caused MSNA to decrease from 36 +/- 3 to 15 +/- 4 bursts/min (P < 0. 05).

Whole <b>body</b> <b>heating</b> significantly increased sublingual temperature (P 0. 05). During both normothermic and heat stress conditions, MSNA increased and then decreased significantly when blood pressure was lowered and then raised via intravenous bolus infusions of sodium nitroprusside and phenylephrine HCl, respectively.

40|$|Inhibition of {{cutaneous}} {{nitric oxide}} (NO) synthase reduces {{the magnitude of}} cutaneous vasodilation during whole <b>body</b> <b>heating</b> in humans. However, this observation is insufficient to conclude that NO concentration increases in the skin during a heat stress. This {{study was designed to}} test the hypothesis that whole <b>body</b> <b>heating</b> increases cutaneous interstitial NO concentration. This was accomplished by placing 2 microdialysis membranes in the forearm dermal space of 12 subjects. Both membranes were perfused with lactated Ringer solutions at a rate of 2 microl/min. In both normothermia and during whole <b>body</b> <b>heating</b> via a water perfused suit, dialysate from these membranes were obtained and analyzed for NO using the chemiluminescence technique. In six of these subjects, after the heat stress, the membranes were perfused with a 1 M solution of acetylcholine to stimulate NO release. Dialysate from these trials was also assayed to quantify cutaneous interstitial NO concentration. Whole <b>body</b> <b>heating</b> increased skin temperature from 34. 6 +/- 0. 2 to 38. 8 +/- 0. 2 degrees C (P 0. 05). After the heat stress, administration of acetylcholine in the perfusate significantly increased skin blood flow (128 +/- 6 perfusion units) relative to both normothermic and heat stress values and significantly increased NO concentration in the dialysate (15. 8 +/- 2. 4 microM). These data suggest that whole <b>body</b> <b>heating</b> does not increase cutaneous interstitial NO concentration in forearm skin. Rather, NO may serve in a permissive role in facilitating the effects of an unknown neurotransmitter, leading to cutaneous vasodilation during a heat stress...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} whole <b>body</b> <b>heating</b> on human baroreflex {{function}} are relatively unknown. The {{purpose of this}} project was to identify whether whole <b>body</b> <b>heating</b> reduces the maximal slope of the carotid baroreflex. In 12 subjects, carotid-vasomotor and carotid-cardiac baroreflex responsiveness were assessed in normothermia and during whole <b>body</b> <b>heating.</b> Whole <b>body</b> <b>heating</b> increased sublingual temperature (from 36. 4 +/- 0. 1 to 37. 4 +/- 0. 1 degrees C, P < 0. 01) and increased heart rate (from 59 +/- 3 to 83 +/- 3 beats/min, P < 0. 01), whereas mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) was slightly decreased (from 88 +/- 2 to 83 +/- 2 mmHg, P < 0. 01). Carotid-vasomotor and carotid-cardiac responsiveness were assessed by identifying the maximal gain of MAP and heart rate to R wave-triggered changes in carotid sinus transmural pressure. Whole <b>body</b> <b>heating</b> significantly decreased the responsiveness of the carotid-vasomotor baroreflex (from - 0. 20 +/- 0. 02 to - 0. 13 +/- 0. 02 mmHg/mmHg, P < 0. 01) without altering the responsiveness of the carotid-cardiac baroreflex (from - 0. 40 +/- 0. 05 to - 0. 36 +/- 0. 02 beats x min(- 1) x mmHg(- 1), P = 0. 21). Carotid-vasomotor and carotid-cardiac baroreflex curves were shifted downward and upward, respectively, to accommodate the decrease in blood pressure and increase in heart rate that accompanied the heat stress. Moreover, the operating point of the carotid-cardiac baroreflex was shifted closer to threshold (P = 0. 02) by the heat stress. Reduced carotid-vasomotor baroreflex responsiveness, coupled with {{a reduction in the}} functional reserve for the carotid baroreflex to increase heart rate during a hypotensive challenge, may contribute to increased susceptibility to orthostatic intolerance during a heat stress...|$|R

5|$|Common {{threshers}} are active, strong swimmers; {{there are}} infrequent reports of them leaping {{completely out of}} the water. Like the fast-swimming sharks of the family Lamnidae, the common thresher has a strip of aerobic red muscle along its flank that is able to contract powerfully and efficiently for long periods of time. In addition, they have slow-oxidative muscles centrally located within their bodies and a blood vessel countercurrent exchange system called the rete mirabile ("wonderful net"), allowing them to generate and retain <b>body</b> <b>heat.</b> The temperature inside the red muscles of a common thresher averages 2°C (3.6°F) above that of the ambient seawater, though there is significant individual variation.

5|$|The addax are amply {{suited to}} live in the deep desert under extreme conditions. They can survive without free water almost indefinitely, because they get {{moisture}} from their food and dew that condenses on plants. Scientists believe the addax has a special lining in its stomach that stores water in pouches to use in times of dehydration. They also produce highly concentrated urine to conserve water. Pale colour of the coat reflects radiant heat, and the length and density of the coat helps in thermoregulation. In the day the addax huddle together in shaded areas, and in cool nights rest in sand hollows. These practices help in dissipation of <b>body</b> <b>heat</b> and saving water by cooling the body through evaporation.|$|E
5|$|The most {{dangerous}} aspects of narcosis are the impairment of judgement, multi-tasking and coordination, {{and the loss}} of decision-making ability and focus. Other effects include vertigo and visual or auditory disturbances. The syndrome may cause exhilaration, giddiness, extreme anxiety, depression, or paranoia, depending on the individual diver and the diver's medical or personal history. When more serious, the diver may feel overconfident, disregarding normal safe diving practices. Slowed mental activity, as indicated by increased reaction time and increased errors in cognitive function, are effects which increase the risk of a diver mismanaging an incident. Narcosis reduces both the perception of cold discomfort and shivering and thereby affects the production of <b>body</b> <b>heat</b> and consequently allows a faster drop in the core temperature in cold water, with reduced awareness of the developing problem.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of heating and cooling on time course of voluntary and electrically induced muscle force variation. Material and Methods.

Passive lower <b>body</b> <b>heating</b> increased muscle and core temperatures, while cooling lowered muscle temperature, but did not affect core temperature. We observed significantly lower muscle fatigue during voluntary contraction compared with electrically induced contractions. <b>Body</b> <b>heating</b> (opposite to cooling) increased involuntarily induced muscle force, but caused greater electrically induced muscle fatigue. In the middle of the exercise, the coefficient of correlation for electrically induced muscle torque decreased significantly as compared with the beginning of the exercise, while during maximal voluntary contractions, this relation for torque remained significant until the end of the exercise.

40|$|Heatstroke is {{characterized}} by excessive hyperthermia associated with systemic inflammatory responses, which leads to multiple organ failure, in which brain disorders predominate.

Immediately after termination of whole <b>body</b> <b>heating,</b> heated mice displayed excessive hyperthermia (body core temperature ~ 42. 5 °C). Four hours after termination of heat stress, heated mice displayed (i) systemic inflammation; (ii) ischemic, hypoxic, and oxidative damage to the hypothalamus; (iii) hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical axis impairment (reflected by plasma levels of both adrenocorticotrophic-hormone and corticosterone); (iv) decreased fractional survival; and (v) thermoregulatory deficits (e. g., they became hypothermia when they were exposed to room temperature). These heatstroke reactions can be significantly attenuated by human umbilical cord blood-derived CD 34 + cells therapy.

American palaeontologist Donald Prothero has proposed that, contrary to most depictions, Paraceratherium had large, elephant-like ears that it used for thermoregulation.

5|$|A {{high level}} of {{insulation}} was used to keep the building warm during the winter months. This approach, however, brings with it the potential problem of overheating during the summer due to solar heat gains through the glazing, <b>body</b> <b>heat</b> {{and the use of}} computers and electric lighting. Standard solutions to the problem usually involve using energy intensive HVAC systems. The Scottish Parliament Building, however, reduces the requirements for such systems to only 20% of the accommodation by a variety of strategies. Natural ventilation is used wherever possible. A computerised management system senses the temperature {{in different parts of the}} Parliament and automatically opens windows to keep the building cool. During summer months, the building opens the windows during the night time when it is unoccupied and permits the heavy concrete floors and structure to cool and rid themselves of heat absorbed during the day. This then helps to keep the building temperature down during the day by absorbing the excess heat from the glazing, occupants and electrical equipment. Some of the concrete floors are further cooled by water from 25metres (80ft) deep bore holes beneath the parliamentary campus which also provide water for the toilet facilities. The building achieves the highest rating in the Building Research Establishment's Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM).|$|E

Their vertebral columns, limbs, limb girdles and musculature needed to be strong enough to raise them off the ground for locomotion and feeding. Terrestrial adults discarded their lateral line systems and adapted their sensory systems to receive stimuli via the medium of the air. They needed to develop new methods to regulate their <b>body</b> <b>heat</b> to cope with fluctuations in ambient temperature.

Whole <b>body</b> <b>heating</b> significantly increased sublingual temperature, HR, and forearm skin blood flow. Spectral analysis of HR and SBP revealed that the heat stress significantly reduced HR and SBP variability within the high-frequency range (0. 2 - 0. 3 Hz), reduced SBP variability within the low-frequency range (0. 03 - 0. 15 Hz), and increased the ratio of low- to high-frequency HR variability (all P < 0. 01). Transfer function gain analysis showed that the heat stress reduced dynamic baroreflex regulation of HR within the high-frequency range (from 1. 04 +/- 0. 06 to 0. 54 +/- 0. 6 beats. min(- 1). mmHg(- 1); P < 0. 001) without significantly affecting the gain in the low-frequency range (P = 0. 63).
