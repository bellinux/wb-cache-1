5|$|After {{six years}} with no <b>buyers,</b> <b>in</b> late 1986 Northrop {{canceled}} the $1.2billion project. Northrop {{was reluctant to}} protest perceived favoritism of the F-16 in fear of losing support for the project for the Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit stealth bomber. Ongoing negotiations with the Royal Moroccan Air Force for 20 F-20s were canceled; along with the small order by Bahrain. Later on, a bribery scandal would emerge from the attempts to market the F-20 to South Korea, leading to several Northrop managers resigning and the reprimanding of chief executive Thomas V. Jones, who retired in 1989.|$|E

5|$|Chatwin's {{writing was}} shaped by {{his work as a}} {{cataloguer}} at Sotheby's, which provided him with years of practice writing concise yet vivid descriptions of objects with the intention of enticing <b>buyers.</b> <b>In</b> addition, Chatwin's interest in nomads also influenced his writing. One aspect of nomadic culture that interested him was the few possessions they had. Their spartan way of life appealed to his aesthetic sense, and it was something he sought to emulate in both his life and his writing. He strove to strip unnecessary objects from his life and unnecessary words from his prose.|$|E

5|$|The ITS-Davis {{study also}} found that a small but {{influential}} minority of dealers have introduced new approaches to better meet the needs of plug-in customers.

Some dealers assign seasoned sales people as plug-in experts, many of whom drive plug-ins themselves to learn and be familiar with the technology and relate the car’s benefits to potential buyers. The study concluded also that carmakers could do much more to support dealers selling PEVs.|$|E

5|$|Game {{development}} costs gradually increased, and Nintendo {{did not provide}} Rare with more capital nor did they purchase the company's remaining stake. According to Rare founders Tim and Chris Stamper, they were surprised that Nintendo did not directly acquire the studio. Rare then looked for potential <b>buyers.</b> <b>In</b> early 2000, workers from Activision and Microsoft began visiting Rare with purchase offers. Rare was interested in Activision's offer, but the deal collapsed and on 24 September 2002 Microsoft purchased Rare for $375 million. Rare became a first-party developer for Microsoft's Xbox. Character trademarks from games developed by Rare for Nintendo consoles, such as Conker of Conker's Bad Fur Day and Banjo of the Banjo-Kazooie series, were retained by Rare; intellectual property created by Nintendo, such as Donkey Kong and Star Fox, were retained by Nintendo. This left Donkey Kong Racing, due for release for the GameCube, unreleased. 30 employees left Rare during the transition.|$|E
5|$|Stringer did {{not expect}} the success of Glee Cast single releases, and {{estimated}} that four million copies would be sold by Christmas2009. He was unsure whether the high sales figures would help or hinder the release of Glee: The Music, Volume1, and as such, was eager for its release in order to gauge the physical and digital market response. The 17 tracks selected for the album were considered amongst the series' most popular, with Columbia and Fox aiming to attract casual buyers as well as Glee fans. Geoff Bywater, head of Fox's music department, anticipated considerable sales from impulse <b>buyers</b> <b>in</b> retail stores. Instrumental versions of some songs were included as bonus tracks, based on a trend of fans recreating the musical numbers in tribute to the show.|$|E
5|$|The strong {{cultural}} {{interest in}} British castles persisted in the 20th century. In some cases this had destructive consequences as wealthy collectors bought and removed architectural features and other historical artefacts from castles {{for their own}} collections, a practice that produced significant official concern. Some of the more significant cases included St Donat's Castle, bought by William Randolph Hearst in 1925 and then decorated with numerous medieval buildings removed from their original sites around Britain, and the case of Hornby, where {{many parts of the}} castle were sold off and sent to <b>buyers</b> <b>in</b> the United States. Partially {{as a result of these}} events, increasing legal powers were introduced to protect castles – acts of parliament in 1900 and 1910 widened the terms of the earlier legislation on national monuments to allow the inclusion of castles. An act of Parliament in 1913 introduced preservation orders for the first time and these powers were extended in 1931. Similarly, after the end of the Irish Civil War, the new Irish state took early action to extend and strengthen the previous British legislation to protect Irish national monuments.|$|E
