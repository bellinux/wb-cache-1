50|$|Alltech, {{an animal}} health and {{nutrition}} company located in Nicholasville, Kentucky (about 15 minutes from downtown Lexington and 30 {{minutes from the}} Horse Park), was the title sponsor of the 2010 Games. The sponsorship was valued at $10 million. However, Alltech's total support went far beyond the name sponsorship package. The company had nearly 60 employees involved with {{the promotion of the}} Games—more than the size of the official FEI World Games staff. When the organizing committee for the Games announced a <b>budget</b> <b>cutback</b> due to lower-than-expected ticket sales, Alltech stepped up its financial support. Company founder and president Pearse Lyons also brought in University of Kentucky basketball head coach John Calipari to promote a special luxury ticket package. At the time of the Games, the company's support was estimated to have been $32 million, and the company was expected to (and ultimately did) sponsor the next edition of the Games held in the French region of Normandy in 2014.|$|E
50|$|In 2008, under a <b>budget</b> <b>cutback</b> {{imposed by}} the new owners at Creative Loafing, the Reader laid off several of its most {{experienced}} journalists, including John Conroy, Harold Henderson, Tori Marlan and Steve Bogira. The paper had de-emphasized the tradition of offbeat feature stories in favor of theme issues and aggressive, opinionated reporting on city government, for example its extensive coverage of tax increment financing (TIFs) by Ben Joravsky, {{who has been a}} staff writer since the 1980s. Though the staff is much smaller than it was before the sale, many other key figures remained as of June 2010, including media critic Michael Miner, film critic J.R. Jones, arts reporter Deanna Isaacs, food writer Mike Sula, theater critic Albert Williams, and music writers Peter Margasak and Miles Raymer. In November 2009, James Warren, former managing editor for features at the Chicago Tribune, was named president and publisher. In March, 2010, Warren resigned. In June, longtime editor Alison True was fired by acting publisher Alison Draper and Creative Loafing CEO Marty Petty, sparking outrage among the paper's remaining audience. In July, Draper was named publisher, managing editor Kiki Yablon was promoted to editor, and Geoff Dougherty was named associate publisher. Dougherty had founded and subsequently closed the online Chi-Town Daily News and its successor, the print-and-online Chicago Current, which he closed to take the Reader job.|$|E
