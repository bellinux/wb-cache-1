40|$|AbstractThe {{advent of}} {{high-performance}} terrestrial laser scanners {{has made it}} possible to capture dense point-clouds of engineering facilities. 3 D shape acquisition from engineering facilities is useful for supporting maintenance and repair tasks. In this paper, we discuss methods to reconstruct <b>box</b> <b>shapes</b> and polygonal prisms from large-scale point-clouds. Since many faces may be partly occluded by other objects in engineering plants, we estimate possible <b>box</b> <b>shapes</b> and polygonal prisms and verify their compatibility with measured point-clouds. We evaluate our method using actual point-clouds of engineering plants...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to verify the {{hypothesis}} that cavity design does not affect the strength of direct composite restorations as do material properties. Finite element modeling (FEM) and empirical testing were done for two cavity designs: a <b>box</b> <b>shape</b> (cube) and a concave shape (U). Two microhybrid composites were used to prepare the samples with the help of split stainless steel moulds. Compressive strength was tested. The results were statistically analyzed. Both FEA and empirical testing were complementary to each other in that the concave shape showed a significantly higher strength than box. Material properties affected the values only when <b>box</b> <b>shape</b> was used. The null hypothesis is thus rejected, and it is concluded that design significantly affects the strength of direct composite restorations...|$|R
