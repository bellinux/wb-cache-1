Once this calibration process is complete, the SNP device will only recognize the user specific sips and puffs that have been saved into the SNP device.|$|R

However, our {{measurements}} indicate that this habitat could become hypoxic on calm nights ([O 2] minima= 2 – 30 % of air saturation) due to respiration by the coral and associated organisms. Moreover, at very low tides, the whole coral colony can be completely air exposed.

We characterized breathing patterns and pulmonary function changes in correlation to lung histopathology and survival by using a well-established murine model of p-GVHD. Lethally irradiated B 6 D 2 F 1 mice received SCT from either syngeneic B 6 D 2 F 1 or allogeneic C 57 BL/ 6 animals. Within 6 weeks, severe p-GVHD developed in allogeneic recipients characterized by progressive interstitial, alveolar, peribronchial, and periluminal inflammatory cell infiltration, whereas in syngeneic recipients lung histology remained normal. Allogeneic recipients demonstrated decreased minute ventilation (MV), reduced peak inspiratory and expiratory flow rates as early as 1 week after SCT. In addition, allo-SCT resulted in restrictive pulmonary function changes as early as 7 days after transplantation and in progressive airflow obstruction within 6 weeks. Decreased <b>breathing</b> <b>abilities</b> and pulmonary function changes of allogeneic recipients were associated with increased mortality and the severity of acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD).

Our general condition of well-being is dependent upon the rhythmic of breathing within us. Similarly, emotions change the rhythm of breath and when we become overexcited, then we lose control over the breath. By gaining control of the breath then we mastery of mind and body. Not only that, we also establish a connection with the world around us, {{of which we are}} pan, through the breath. Two healing initiatives based upon breath are used as illustration of breath both as a subtle organizing property and as a material manifestation. The first example is the use of breath through singing to intentionally organize the physiological abilities of another person as they recover from coma. Singing is literally the intentional use of breath to heal realized through a particular therapeutic form, which is imptovised music therapy. A fundamental property of breathing is that it has rhythm. In musical terms, rhythm has to have the property of intention otherwise it would be simply repetition or pulse. The second healing initiative is that of Qigong Yangsheng for the treatment of asthma. Breathing is used here also as an intentional activity, this time by the patient to improve his or her own <b>breathing</b> <b>abilities</b> and to heal what is essentially a breathing problem, the material manifestation of air-flow. In this latter example, the healer acts as a teacher and guide for the sufferer to influence her own breathing...|$|R

The objects which were selected for this thesis were chosen in accordance to their short distance to the studied sanatorium Hamzova léčebna in Luže and they are all located in the Pardubice region. Another aim of the thesis is a profound study of a chosen sanatorium, Hamzova léčebna in Luže, involving a dendrological assessment of the park and recommendations for the future vegetation care. The health centre Hamzova léčebna in Luže and its park was founded by MUDr. František Hamza in 1901. The centre was founded as a therapeutical place for treatment of patients, especially children, with tuberculosis. MUDr, Hamza believed that for good treatment of patients it is necessary that they will be surrounded by good climatic conditions. That is the reason why he chose the landscape of Luže as the right location for establishment of his therapeutical centre. On thepremises of the centre he founded little groves which created convenient microclimatic conditions for the patients' <b>breathing</b> <b>abilities.</b> The groves were used for the outdoor educational activities of the children as well. Nowadays, the main purpose of the centre is rehabilitation of the patients while the sport therapies take place in the premises of the health centre. A part of the centre is also an educational path "Hamza's park" and an arboretum. The sanatorium aspires to preserve the original concept of the park, e. g. by preserving the groves and tree alleys along the paths. Another of Hamza's interests was collecting foreign trees and shrub, that is why the park can be also seen as an arboretum...|$|R

Evaluation of pulmonary function in a longer perspective is lacking. In this prospective study pulmonary function and health-related quality of life were investigated 1 year after cardiac surgery. Methods: Pulmonary function measurements, health-related quality of life (SF- 36), dyspnoea, subjective <b>breathing</b> and coughing <b>ability</b> and pain were evaluated before and 1 year after surgery in 150 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting, valve surgery or combined surgery. Results: One year after surgery the forced vital capacity and forced expiratory volume in 1 s were significantly decreased (by 4 - 5 %) compared to preoperative values (p < 0. 05).

Of these 31 patients, 25 completed 18 to 28 months of methotrexate therapy. Intervention: Patients were treated for at least 18 months with low-dose methotrexate (range, 15 to 50 mg/wk). Results: The mean prednisone dose was reduced from 26. 9 mg/d to 6. 3 mg/d (P = 0. 0001) in the 25 patients treated with long-term methotrexate: Fifteen patients discontinued the regular use of prednisone, 9 patients reduced prednisone use by more than 50 %, and 1 patient failed to respond.
