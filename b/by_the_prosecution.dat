5|$|In March 1979 at Stafford Crown Court {{he pleaded}} not guilty to murder but instead pleaded guilty to {{manslaughter}} on the grounds of diminished responsibility. The plea was accepted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution,</b> after psychiatrists gave evidence that he had an active paranoid psychosis. His indefinite detention was ordered by the trial judge, Mr Justice Stephen Brown, and he was held in Broadmoor Hospital and at Ashworth Hospital, both high security units.|$|E
5|$|On March 26, 2012 the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania {{rejected}} {{his appeal}} for retrial that asserted, {{based on a}} 2009 report by the National Academy of Science, that forensic evidence presented <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> and accepted into evidence in the original trial was unreliable. It {{was reported to be}} the former death row inmate's last legal appeal.|$|E
5|$|The strongest {{piece of}} {{evidence}} presented <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> were details revealed in a secretly recorded telephone conversation between the defendant and her sister, Naima, in which LMme M'Barek discussed £100,000 (€150,000) blood money paid to her brother. She additionally recounted precisely how {{she was going to}} blame her brother for her husband's death.|$|E

5|$|To {{satisfy the}} {{prejudice}} prong of Strickland, a defendant who rejects the prosecution's plea offer must {{show that there}} is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's deficient performance, the offer would have been accepted by the defendant, not withdrawn <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution,</b> and accepted by the court, and that the sentence actually received exceeded that which would have been received under the plea.|$|E
5|$|During the investigation, {{unsuccessful}} {{attempts were}} made to match a knife taken from Beauchamp upon his arrest to the type of wound observed on Sharp's body. Efforts to match a footprint found near Sharp's house to Beauchamp were similarly unsuccessful. The posse that arrested Beauchamp had taken a bloody handkerchief from the crime scene, but had lost it on the trip back to Frankfort after the arrest. The best evidence presented <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> was the testimony of Sharp's wife Eliza that she heard the killer's voice and that it was distinctly high-pitched. When given the opportunity to hear Beauchamp's voice, she identified it as that of the killer.|$|E
5|$|Each man was {{subsequently}} released August 10 on $3,000 bail. The charge of murder was later amended to manslaughter by {{the grand jury}} indictment. The trial was convened November 26 under Judge Harding, with the widow of Patrick Langan, one of those slain on August 1, named as prosecutor. Of the 20 subpoenaed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> to {{bear witness to the}} peaceful nature of the protest, only six appeared to testify. Three admitted to seeing violence committed by the mob prior to the shooting. Many more testified on behalf of the accused.|$|E

5|$|He {{was tried}} before Curiohaus war crimes court in Rotherbaum, in Court Number 5 on Monday, 11 October 1948. Knöchlein's defence hinged on {{the claim that}} he was not present at the massacre, {{although}} his lawyers did not deny that the event took place. They also claimed that the British had used dumdum bullets during the battle and misused a flag of truce; all of which were vigorously denied <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution.</b> Evidence was given by Pooley, O'Callaghan, Madame Duquenne-Creton, and a French civilian who testified to recognising Knöchlein.|$|E
5|$|His {{trial for}} {{obstruction}} of justice was to have begun on March 2, 2009, but jury selection was postponed by 11th-hour appeals <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution.</b> The trial commenced on March 21, 2011, in U. S. District Court, Northern District of California, with Judge Susan Illston presiding. He was convicted on April 13, 2011 on the {{obstruction of justice}} charge, for giving an evasive {{answer to a question}} under oath. His sentence did not include prison. The conviction was initially upheld by a three judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in 2013, but a larger panel of the court voted 10-1 to overturn the conviction on April 22, 2015.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{information}} available on the allegations was released (officially or unofficially) <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> and unchallenged by Jackson. Jackson was largely portrayed as guilty by the media. The media bias {{was evident in the}} use of sensational headlines to draw in readers and viewers when the content itself did not support the headline, the purchasing of stories of his alleged criminal activity, the purchasing of confidential leaked material from the police investigation, deliberately using pictures of his appearance at its worst, using headlines that strongly implied his guilt, and a general lack of objectivity.|$|E

5000|$|The revolt was spurred <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecutions</b> {{launched}} <b>by</b> Minh Mạng against southern factions {{which had}} opposed his rule {{and tended to}} be favourable to Christianity. In particular, Minh Mạng prosecuted Lê Văn Duyệt, a former faithful general of Emperor Gia Long, who had opposed his enthronement.

5|$|Some of the {{evidence}} submitted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> {{took the form of}} depositions made by leading Nazis. The defence demanded that the men should be brought to Israel so that the defence's right to cross-examination would not be abrogated. But Hausner, in his role as Attorney General, declared that he would be obliged to have any war criminals who entered Israel arrested. The prosecution proved that Eichmann had visited places where exterminations had taken place, including Chełmno extermination camp, Auschwitz, and Minsk (where he witnessed a mass shooting of Jews), and therefore was aware that the deportees were being killed.|$|E
5|$|The {{family members}} are afraid to testify at the mock trial and at the real deposition; Buster fakes a coma, Lindsay and Lucille fake {{entering}} rehab, and Gob flees the country to perform in a USO Tour in Iraq. The deceptions are all uncovered <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution,</b> and in Iraq Gob is arrested for inadvertently inciting an anti-US riot. Buster and Michael travel to Iraq to rescue Gob, and while there, uncover evidence that the mini-palaces George Sr. built in Iraq were actually ordered and {{paid for by the}} CIA for wiretapping purposes. After this discovery, the US government drops all of the charges against George Sr. In the general confusion, everyone except George Michael forgets Maeby's sixteenth birthday.|$|E
5|$|In June 2011, Pre-Trial Chamber II {{requested}} that the Prosecutor, defendants, and victims comment {{on the possibility of}} holding the confirmation of charges hearings in Kenya rather than in The Hague. This move was supported by Amnesty International, which claimed that holding the hearings in Kenya would bring the justice process closer to victims. The idea of holding the hearings in Kenya was also supported by the defendants Francis Muthaura and Henry Kosgey, with Mathaura suggesting holding the hearings in a military barracks for enhanced security as well as suggesting the possibility of holding the hearings in Arusha, Tanzania, which is the location of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. The move was opposed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Prosecution,</b> who cited security concerns as an obstacle, and also by Ali, Kenyatta, Ruto, and Sang who cited the possibility that a change of venue would lead to delays in the trial process in submissions made to the Court. On 29 June Judge Trendafilova ruled that the hearings will take place at the seat of the Court in The Hague.|$|E

5|$|Nosanchuk then {{considered}} {{whether or}} not to call Lamb to the stand on his own behalf at the trial. He already had a strong defence, with five psychiatrists firmly behind him as well as George Scott of Kingston Penitentiary, who had agreed to testify on his behalf. The lawyer considered the boy's probable reaction to a cross-examination <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> in court. Lamb appeared calm and collected on the surface, and had so far answered questions about right and wrong in a somewhat rational way. Although the doctors had been able to see Lamb's answers for what they really were, Nosanchuk feared that Lamb's appearance could actually lead the jury to believe that he was sane, which might lead to a guilty verdict and the gallows. He therefore did not call Lamb to the stand.|$|E
5|$|The {{witnesses}} took {{ten hours}} to testify, {{during which time}} the court sat continuously. After a short break, the judge began his summing up, taking two hours to charge the jury. The judge urged the jury to put their prejudice at hearing that Thornton had sex with Ashford out of their heads; they were here to determine if Thornton was guilty of the offence charged. He pointed out to the jury the lack of concealment exhibited by Thornton, his admission of the sexual act and of being with Ashford until 4a.m. The judge told them {{it was not possible}} for Thornton to have committed the acts alleged <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> and still have made it to the Holden farm {{by the time he was}} seen by Heydon, and stressed that Thornton did not act like a man who ran. The judge concluded by reminding the jury that it was better a murderer go free than an innocent man be convicted.|$|E
5|$|Christopher Nolan reprised {{his duties}} as director, and brought his brother, Jonathan, to co-write {{the script for}} the second installment. The Dark Knight {{featured}} Christian Bale reprising his role as Batman/Bruce Wayne, Heath Ledger as The Joker, and Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent / Two-Face. Principal photography began in April 2007 in Chicago and concluded in November. Other locations included Pinewood Studios, Ministry of Sound in London and Hong Kong. On January 22, 2008, after he had completed filming The Dark Knight, Ledger died from a bad combination of prescription medication. Warner Bros. had created a viral marketing campaign for The Dark Knight, developing promotional websites and trailers highlighting screen shots of Ledger as the Joker, but after Ledger's death, the studio refocused its promotional campaign. The film depicts Gotham attempting to rebuild after Batman's actions have caused so much damage to its organised crime families, aided <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> of charismatic District Attorney Harvey Dent, but {{the involvement of the}} anarchic Joker threatens everything, as his actions lead to the death of Rachel Dawes and Harvey being scarred and transformed into Two-Face. Although Batman is able to stop the Joker from forcing two ferries- one loaded with civilians and the other with prisoners- to destroy each other, he is forced to take the blame for the murders committed by Dent to ensure that the city retains its hope for the future.|$|E

5|$|Evidence was {{presented}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> {{to suggest that}} Morgan continued to use the vehicle while Figard's body lay in the cab, and that the lorry was parked outside his house over the Christmas period. Farrer said Morgan bought a spade, axe and hacksaw {{with the intention of}} dismembering the body, but changed his mind, instead making an overnight delivery run to dispose of it. After removing a fuse from his lorry's tachograph to conceal the journey, he drove to Worcestershire. Discrepancies were subsequently found in his travel records for 29 December 1995 because he forgot to replace the fuse following the trip. DNA tests on spots of blood found in the cab matched Figard, while a blood-soaked mattress was found in Morgan's garage. Several items belonging to Figard, including photographs and a toilet bag, were recovered from his house. Some of her clothing was found close to a warehouse he had visited the night the body was dumped. Morgan gave two bottles of Pascal Chretien that Figard had brought to England as Christmas presents to two garage attendants who worked at a Shell station opposite his house.|$|E
