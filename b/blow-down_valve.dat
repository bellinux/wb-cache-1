50|$|They {{differed}} from the WAGR examples in having a skyline cowling running {{the length of the}} boiler and smokebox, Westinghouse air brakes and an additional <b>blow-down</b> <b>valve</b> {{in the middle of the}} bottom of the boiler barrel.|$|E
50|$|At 0612, {{the divers}} opened the <b>blow-down</b> <b>valve</b> and {{pressurized}} the bell. When Hoffman exited the bell {{he was wearing}} a hot-water suit while Hammond was dressed in a dry suit. Hoffman swam to the guide base 15 to 20 feet away, and, while holding onto one of the guideposts, noticed that it was not hinged, which meant that the wires had to be cut away. After retrieving a hacksaw from the bell, he began cutting one of the wires.|$|E
50|$|Work on flue {{installation}} by Fraser Shipyards began November 17, 2015, and {{was completed}} on December 26, 2015. The 28's wheels were given clearance by the FRA {{a few months}} later. In March 2016, the brass and cab water-level meters were reinstalled, the super-heater tubes were being reassembled for installation, and the <b>blow-down</b> <b>valves</b> were sent to Colorado for rebuilding. The hydro-test was scheduled for July 13, 2016. The FRA report was filed on July 20, 2016, stating the locomotive passed the test. The cab was painted black with red windows in June. The smoke box front was being installed in early August. Insulation and lagging and a new boiler jacket were supplied to the museum to finish locomotive assembly at no charge. Insulation was installed on the boiler beginning August 12, according to the North Shore Scenic Railroad's Facebook page.|$|R
40|$|Fuel {{efficiency}} and torque performance {{are two major}} challenges for highly downsized turbocharged engines. However, the inherent characteristics of the turbocharged SI engine such as negative PMEP, knock sensitivity and poor transient performance significantly limit its maximum potential. Conventional ways of improving the problems above normally concentrate solely on the engine side or turbocharger side leaving the exhaust manifold in between ignored. This paper investigates this neglected area by highlighting a novel means of gas exchange process. Divided Exhaust Period (DEP) is an alternative way of accomplishing the gas exchange process in turbocharged engines. The DEP concept engine features two exhaust valves but with separated function. The <b>blow-down</b> <b>valve</b> acts like a traditional turbocharged exhaust valve to evacuate the first portion of the exhaust gas to the turbine. While the scavenge valve feeding the latter portion of the exhaust gas directly into the low resistant exhaust pipe behaves similarly to valves in a naturally aspirated engine. By combining the characteristics of both turbocharged and naturally aspirated engines, high backpressure between the turbine inlet and the exhaust port is maintained in the blowdown phase while significant reduction of the backpressure could be achieved in the latter displacement phase. This is directly beneficial for pumping work and residual gas scavenging. Combustion phasing & stability and turbocharger efficiency could also benefit from such concept. This simulation study was carried out using a validated 1 D model of a highly downsized SI engine. Two degrees of freedom including the lift and {{the duration of the}} scavenge valve were optimized to achieve minimum BSFC. The potential for higher attainable BMEP was also briefly investigated at low engine speed...|$|E
