A series of <b>bubble</b> <b>collapse</b> flows induced by pressure waves of different strengths are investigated by positioning the cavitation bubble at different stand-off distances to the solid boundary. It is found that the Kelvin-Helmholtz vortices are formed when the liquid jet induced by the pressure wave penetrates the bubble surface.

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of a buoyant bubble near a rigid boundary at the null final Kelvin impulse state is investigated numerically {{by using a}} boundary integral method. The results of the numerical calculations provided the bubble profiles and the pressure contours in the liquid surrounding the bubble. Three cases are chosen to typify the jetting behaviour at the null final Kelvin impulse state: (i) formation of an asymmetric annular jet leading to bubble splitting; (ii) formation of an asymmetric annular jet and a high-speed axial jet directed away from the boundary, and (iii) formation of two opposite high-speed axial jets directed towards the bubble centre {{as a consequence of}} a more symmetric but weaker annular jet in the initial stage of <b>bubble</b> <b>collapse.</b> The complex behaviour is attributed to a slight difference between the strength of the opposite forces during <b>bubble</b> <b>collapse.</b> The present results indicate that the jetting behaviour in the neighbourhood of the neutral <b>bubble</b> <b>collapse</b> can be adequately described by the Kelvin impulse itself, but evaluated during the collapse phase of the bubble. Its direction determines the position of the annular jet in the initial phase of the collapse while its magnitude indicates the degree of asymmetry and the intensity of the annular jet.

40|$|Shockwave {{lithotripsy}} (SWL) is a non-invasive {{medical procedure}} in which shockwaves {{are focused on}} kidney stones {{in an attempt to}} break them. Because the stones are usually immersed in liquid, cavitation occurs during the process. However, the stone comminution mechanisms and the bubble dynamics of SWL are not fully understood. In the present thesis, numerical simulations are employed to study axisymmetric Rayleigh collapse and shock-induced collapse of a single gas bubble in a free field and near a wall. A high-order accurate, quasi-conservative, shock- and interface-capturing scheme is developed to solve the multicomponent Euler equations. The primary contributions of the present work are {{the development of a new}} numerical framework to study compressible multicomponent flows, the characterization of the dynamics of non-spherical <b>bubble</b> <b>collapse,</b> and quantitative measurements of wall pressures generated by <b>bubble</b> <b>collapse.</b> Because of asymmetries in the flow field, a re-entrant jet develops and generates a large water-hammer pressure upon impact onto the distal side. Jet properties are calculated and, as an indication of potential damage, wall pressures are measured; pressures on the order of 1 GPa are achieved locally. In shock-induced collapse, the wall pressure is amplified by the presence of bubbles within several initial radii from the wall. Thus, the pressure generated by the <b>bubble</b> <b>collapse</b> is larger than the incoming shock. The results extended to SWL show that shock-induced collapse has tremendous potential for damage along the stone surface. Furthermore, the simulations are coupled to an elastic wave propagation code to show that <b>bubble</b> <b>collapse</b> may cause damage within kidney stones as well. ...|$|R

Calculations for different gas state equations inside the bubble show that the Van der Waals law predicts a slightly higher liquid velocity at the shock front than when considering a perfect gas law. Finally, decreasing the value of the surface tension at the bubble/liquid interface results in an increase of the liquid velocity at the shock front.

However, the mechanism has not been examined in detail because, at present, numerical simulations capable of incorporating the acoustic impedance of various tissues do not exist.
