25|$|The {{design of}} the Normand gave a {{particularly}} large heating area (tube surface area) {{in relation to the}} grate area.

Cold downcomers outside the casing linked these drums, providing a path for the return circulation of cold water.|$|E
25|$|Steam was {{collected}} inside a dome {{on top of}} the top chamber, and in the Reed boiler all but the dome and the ends of the three water chambers was enclosed in a double-layered casing with an air gap and asbestos lining that reduced the temperature of the outer layer. The casing rose at the top to form an outlet for hot gases into a funnel. The furnace was fed with coal by stokers through firebox doors at one end, and, whereas the Normand boiler required a fire of about 18inches (460mm) depth, the Reed boiler required a shallower one of between 8and 12inches (200–300mm). Air for the furnace passed through the air gap in the <b>boiler</b> <b>casing,</b> thus providing a supply of heated air that was directed {{to the rear of the}} ashpan. This admitted air through three doors that closed automatically if a tube failed, the intention being to prevent flames, steam and debris escaping into the boiler room. A constant supply of pure water was essential for this type of boiler, as a shortage of water would rapidly result in an empty boiler liable to severe damage from the furnace, and the deposition of any contaminant, such as limescale, would result in a significant loss of efficiency and could block tubes. Each boiler had its own feedwater pump, and a feedwater regulator also of Reed's design.|$|E

5000|$|Following {{a series}} of missile tests in late May, and fleet {{exercises}} with Pacific naval units, the cruiser visited Seattle for the Fourth of July celebrations. After a visit to Vancouver the following week, Chicago returned to San Diego to begin overhaul preparations. From 9 September to 24 October, the cruiser underwent a major restricted availability as repairs were conducted to fuel tanks, <b>boiler</b> <b>casings,</b> and the main propulsion plant. Additional upkeep, tender availability, and type training continued through the new year as the cruiser prepared for another deployment. In February 1976, personnel in the Operations department underwent extensive team training in anti-air, anti-submarine, and electronic warfare {{in preparation for a}} fleet exercise in March. That operation, exercise [...] "Valiant Heritage", took place from 2-11 March with forces from Canada, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, and the United States.|$|R

2500|$|The boiler resembled two {{elongated}} marine Yarrow boilers, placed end to end.

50|$|Water {{circulation}} {{within the}} boiler furnace was assisted by fully immersed electrical pumps manufactured by Hayward Tyler Co. The pulverised fuel plant was built and installed by International Combustion Ltd. Four Lopulco coal roller mills with pulverised coal fans per boiler {{were located in}} the boiler house basement. Coal was fed from overhead bunkers by speed-regulated drum feeders to the mills and crushed to fine dust by three 7.5 ton roller doors per mill, then blown into the wind boxes through pipework and the PF nozzles. Combustion air was delivered by two forced draught fans located above the coal bunkers, taking warm air from above the <b>boiler</b> roof <b>casing</b> and discharging it though rotating heat exchangers to the furnace wind boxes. Hot gas was drawn from the furnaces through the pendants, water tube economisers, rotating heat exchanger, cyclone dust collectors and electrostatic precipitators by two induced draught fans before entering the chimney flue ducts and passing up the 500 ft high chimneys.|$|R
25|$|The Mumford boiler was {{a variety}} {{built by the}} {{boilermakers}} Mumford of Colchester, intended for use in smaller boats. The tube banks separated into two groups, with the short tubes slightly curved away from each other. Entry into the lower water drum was perpendicular, requiring an almost rectangular drum with the tubes entering on separate faces. The mechanical weakness of such a shape was acceptable in this small size, but limited the <b>boiler's</b> potential. The <b>casing</b> was small and only enclosed part of the upper steam drum, leading directly to a funnel. A single inverted tee-shaped downcomer linked the drums {{at the rear of}} the boiler.|$|R
5000|$|Stays, or ties, {{physically}} {{link the}} firebox and <b>boiler</b> <b>casing,</b> {{preventing them from}} warping. Since any corrosion is hidden, the stays may have longitudinal holes, called tell-tales, drilled in them which leak before they become unsafe.|$|E
50|$|Unlike coal or wood, the jet burners used did {{not require}} {{additional}} draught. The boiler was fired with a pressure jet burner, a small quantity of pressurised naphtha being tapped off from the boiler. A prominent tube and funnel {{on the front of}} the <b>boiler</b> <b>casing</b> (sometimes mistaken for a whistle) is the air inlet. The fuel jet mixes with the downwards air flow in this vertical tube, then the mixed air and fuel is fed to a ring-shaped burner inside the <b>boiler</b> <b>casing.</b> For starting, a hand air pump was used to pressurise the fuel tank and encourage fuel flow, together with pre-heating of the burner coil by lighting a little of the fuel in a tray below it.|$|E
50|$|As {{weight and}} power and length increased, there were {{experiments}} with flexible boiler casings; from 1910 the Santa Fe road introduced 2-6-6-2 locomotives weighing 392,000 lb, with a 37 ft long boiler barrel, with a firetube reheater and a firetube feedwater section in front, each separated by a blank section, and variants of a telescopic or bellows type <b>boiler</b> <b>casing.</b> These were unsuccessful, and later engines used conventional boilers.|$|E
50|$|The Doble Detroit {{incorporated}} key ignition, {{doing away}} {{with the need for}} manual ignition of the boiler system. John Doble also constructed a flash <b>boiler</b> with rectangular <b>casing</b> in which atomized kerosene fuel was ignited with a spark plug, in a carburetor-type venturi and used forced draft provided by an electrically driven fan. This rapidly heated the feedwater contained in vertical grids of tubes welded to horizontal headers. The steam-raising part of the boiler was partitioned off by a wall of heat-resisting material jacketed with planished steel from a smaller compartment in which were similar grids of tubes for feedwater heating. There seem to have been at least two versions of this boiler, the first with the burner and combustion chamber at the bottom, the other with them {{at the top of the}} casing; this led to the subsequent counterflow monotube boiler arrangement. Boiler operation was fully electro-mechanically automated: the bottom of the boiler housed a metal tray with a row of quartz rods. As heat increased, the tray expanded, pushing the rods forward and shutting off the burner. As the system cooled, the quartz rods receded, engaging the burner.|$|R
50|$|In May 1939 {{an order}} for five 38 class {{locomotives}} was placed with Clyde Engineering. They suffered many delays during construction, mostly due to resource shortages caused by World War II. The first five locomotives were built by Clyde Engineering and had distinctive streamlined <b>boiler</b> <b>casing.</b> The remaining 25 locomotives were built at the New South Wales Government Railways' Eveleigh Railway Workshops (13 even number locomotives) and Cardiff Locomotive Workshops (12 odd numbered locomotives).|$|E
50|$|The valves are {{installed}} {{at a high}} point of the system, where trapped air collects. They may be installed at the highest point in a system, but in a system with pumped circulation this is rarely necessary. Instead they are placed at some local high point, such as the highest point within a utility cupboard or boiler room, {{even though this is}} in a basement. European domestic gas boilers often include such a valve within the <b>boiler</b> <b>casing</b> itself.|$|E

5000|$|In 1898 Walter Peart and Henry Dean {{were the}} driver and fireman of the Great Western train known as the Windsor Express.

5000|$|The {{generally}} accepted smallest gauge for a live steam locomotive is [...] Gauge 1, although O scale live steam models are also common. Producing smaller-scale models remains problematic, as {{the laws of}} physics do not themselves scale: creating a small-scale boiler that produces useful quantities of steam requires careful engineering. Hornby Railways has produced commercial live steam-powered locomotives in OO scale by utilising an electrically heated boiler mounted in the tender, with cylinders in the locomotive, and control provided by electrical- signals fed through the track from a remote control unit. They are less mechanically realistic than models in larger scales; the visible valve gear is a dummy, as on the electric-motor-powered models, and steam admission to the cylinders is controlled by a rotary-valve servo inside the <b>boiler</b> <b>casing,</b> which is also a dummy. Nevertheless, the locomotive is driven by steam that is created on board the locomotive and is hence a genuine steam locomotive.|$|E

5000|$|To {{celebrate}} the centenary of the railways in Germany in 1935 {{a replica of}} the Adler was built beginning from 1933 by the Deutsche Reichsbahn in the Kaiserslautern repair shop (Ausbesserungswerk), which was largely true to the original. The original idea of the President of the Reichsbahn Julius Dorpmüller and the members of his staff was to use the Adler-replica as an instrument of propaganda for the [...] "new era" [...] in the city of the Reichsparteitag Nuremberg. They planned to contrast the Adler with modern gigantic steam locomotives like the high-speed DRG Class 05. For the realisation of the replica they used the results of the planning in 1925. Besides of different technical data the replica differed from the original with thicker <b>boiler</b> <b>casing</b> and additional cross bracings and spokes wheels made of steel.The replica attained an average speed of 33.7 km/h in tests on an 81 kilometre stretch of line. The route had gradients of between 1:110 and 1:140. From 14 July until 13 October 1935 visitors could travel with the reconstructed Adler-train on a track length of two kilometres on the area of the centenary exhibition in Nuremberg. On the driving cab were also the President of the Deutsche Reichsbahn Julius Dorpmüller and the Gauleiter of Franconia Julius Streicher. The Adler-replica was in use after that in 1936 at the Cannstatter Wasen in Stuttgart and during the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin. During the 100-years-jubilee of the first prussian railway in 1938 the Adler-train was in service between Berlin and Potsdam. After this event the Adler-train was sent to the Nuremberg Transport Museum.|$|E
5000|$|The {{outcome was}} a {{complete}} redesign, the Model D of 1922. The uniflow engine, perceived as {{the root of the}} troubles with the Doble Detroit, gave place to a two-cylinder compound type, still with Joy's valve gear, but with piston valves. Another crucial development was a coiled monotube once-through vertically-mounted cylindrical boiler following the thinking behind the later version of the Detroit boiler, the most distinctive feature of which was the placing of the burner {{at the top of the}} boiler. This plus drastic insulation was meant to cause the hot gases to reside within the <b>boiler</b> <b>casing</b> for an optimum length of time giving up the maximum amount of heat to the feedwater. There was a forced draft burner at the top of the boiler and an exhaust flue at the bottom. The venturi was placed horizontally at the top of the vertical boiler barrel and oriented in such a way as to avoid direct contact with the monotube while inducing a swirl motion to the gases. It was thus a counterflow design with water entering the lower end of the coiled monotube and progressing upward toward the burner, which meant that the hottest gases gave superheat to the steam at the top of the coil whilst the cooler gases preheated oncoming the feedwater at the bottom. The distinctive hand operated [...] "miniature steering wheel” rotating a throttle control rod that passed down the middle of the steering column can be observed in D2 which still exists (in the UK) at the present time. Photographic evidence shows that D1 retained the foot throttle pedal, so when the wheel throttle control was first applied is not clear. The latter probably gave more precise adjustment.|$|E
