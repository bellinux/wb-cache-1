Chicago had won {{three of the}} prior four matches, including a 15–6 victory over Michigan in 1900. Coach Yost noted, [...] "I knew long <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> to Michigan of the great rivalry existing between this University and the University of Chicago. It was my desire to win this game above all others." ...|$|E
500|$|Parker's {{experience}} {{playing in}} Israel left a positive impression upon him. He {{went on to}} wear jersey number 18 for both Toronto and Cleveland, explaining that: [...] "I played in Israel <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> back to the NBA, and I had such a great time... two of my sons were born while I was playing overseas and one was actually born in Israel. And I just had such a great experience that I wanted to take something from that experience. The number 18, in Judaism, it means 'chai'... and it's the symbol for life and good fortune in Judaism. And I thought that was something {{to take away from}} Israel and let them know I'm still representing them." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the largely}} {{positive}} view of Presley held by African Americans, a rumor spread in mid-1957 {{that he had}} at some point announced, [...] "The only thing Negroes can do for me is buy my records and shine my shoes." [...] A journalist with the national African American weekly Jet, Louie Robinson, pursued the story. On the set of Jailhouse Rock, Presley granted Robinson an interview, though {{he was no longer}} dealing with the mainstream press. He denied making such a statement or holding in any way to its racist view: [...] "I never said anything like that, and people who know me know that I wouldn't have said it ... A lot of people seem to think I started this business. But rock 'n' roll was here a long time <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> along. Nobody can sing that kind of music like colored people. Let's face it: I can't sing like Fats Domino can. I know that." [...] Also, Red Robinson stated, [...] "Take a look at the things that are only publicized now, of how he'd be driving down the street and see a destitute black woman with a little child. He went and bought her a Cadillac. Now if this guy hated blacks, he wouldn't even have gone near them". Robinson found no evidence that the remark had ever been made, and on the contrary elicited testimony from many individuals indicating that Presley was anything but racist. Blues singer Ivory Joe Hunter, who had heard the rumor before he visited Graceland one evening, reported of Presley, [...] "He showed me every courtesy, and I think he's one of the greatest." [...] Dudley Brooks, an African-American composer and studio musician who worked with Presley during the 1950s and 1960s, also disputed allegations that Presley was a racist. Though the rumored remark was wholly discredited at the time, it was still being used against Presley decades later. The identification of Presley with racism—either personally or symbolically—was expressed most famously in the lyrics of the 1989 rap hit [...] "Fight the Power", by Public Enemy: [...] "Elvis was a hero to most / But he never meant shit to me / Straight-up racist that sucker was / Simple and plain".|$|E

Pressed {{on this point}} during the BBC television programme Question Time, Cameron expressed the view that everybody was allowed to [...] "err and stray" [...] in their past.

Rabbi Judah the son of Rabbi Simon said {{in the name of}} Hezekiah that just as in [...] "few" [...] ( [...] , me'at) means 70 (people), so in [...] "little" [...] ( [...] , me'at) must also mean 70 (head of cattle and sheep).|$|E
2500|$|The Seattle group (originally the Seattle Artificial Kidney Center, {{later the}} Northwest Kidney Centers) started their home program in July 1964. [...] It was {{inspired}} by the fifteen-year-old daughter of a collaborator's friend, who went into renal failure due to lupus erythematosus, and had been denied access to dialysis by their patient selection committee. [...] Dialysis treatment at home was the only alternative and managed to extend her life another four years. Dr. Chris Blagg has stated that the first training predated the establishment of the home program: the [...] "first home patient wasn’t part of our program at all, he was president of a big Indian corporation, lived in Madras, and he came to Seattle just <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> in ’63. He came in early ’63, again, with his doctor and his wife and Dr. Scribner trained them to do dialysis at home and they went home to Madras." ...|$|E

2500|$|<b>Before</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> to this country, {{and in all}} {{the time}} I have been here, it has never {{occurred}} to me to think of New York as being beautiful. [...] Therefore all this talk of beautifying New York seems strange to me. If we were discussing Bismarck I might ask five hundred questions about him before I should think of asking whether he was beautiful. ... So it is with New York. We expect of her power and magnificence, but not beauty. If a European came over here and found that New York was beautiful {{in the same way as}} the European cities he knew he would be very much disappointed. I do not see how you can make New York beautiful in that way with the laws and the democratic spirit that you have here [...] The kind of beauty that makes Paris charming can only exist when private rights and personal liberty are or have been trampled on. [...] Only when the mob rules, or where kings rule, so that there is at one time absolutely no respect for the property of the rich and at another time for the rights of the poor can the beauties of Paris be realized.|$|E
2500|$|Spielberg {{suggested}} that Boam write the next draft, and Lucas agreed to it. Boam felt some nervousness {{going into the}} process. He joked that [...] "the battlefield was littered with writers <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> on to the scene. There were four or five before me. Each writer had their script next to them covered with blood." [...] Boam said that when Spielberg called to offer him the job, Spielberg said [...] "something like, 'You wanna get real rich?' and I said, 'Yeah, why?' and he said, 'I think you should do the next Indiana Jones movie.'" [...] Boam {{is reported to have}} replied to Spielberg's offer by saying, [...] "I just don't know why you didn't come to me before." [...] Boam spent two weeks filled with eight-hour days working with Lucas to develop the story. The two blocked out all other commitments to create the story, building it [...] "beat by beat". Lucas already knew many of the set pieces that were to be in the movie. During the two-week story conference, Boam worked to incorporate it all into the new narrative. [...] "Jeff was very collaborative," [...] Lucas said, adding, [...] "He'd try to include both Steven's ideas and my ideas, and tried to get what we wanted done." ...|$|E
