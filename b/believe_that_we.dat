For that reason, we believe any person with information that may lead us to the murderer should act in the interest of self-preservation.|$|E

The campaign continued through the winter, when the steppes were covered in snow. Describing the journey's ordeal, Su Dingfang {{is reported to have}} said: [...] "The fog shed darkness everywhere.
