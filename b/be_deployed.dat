When SNs <b>are</b> <b>deployed</b> at variable distances in RoI, then silhouettes stored over the entire network depends on {{the total number of}} SNs that <b>are</b> <b>deployed</b> in RoI. Silhouette table that <b>is</b> <b>deployed</b> on a SN depends on the factors listed below.|$|R
5|$|The ADF has {{domestic}} responsibilities. In most {{of these}} tasks the ADF supports the relevant civilian authorities. These responsibilities are typically undertaken by specialised elements of the ADF, though the services' combat elements can <b>be</b> <b>deployed</b> within Australia in response to major emergencies.|$|E
5|$|The {{group was}} reorganized and redesignated on 10 December 1971 as Headquarters and Headquarters Detachment, 220th Military Police Brigade, {{allowing}} it to command {{a larger number of}} military police units. On 16 April 1980 the brigade's command element was again reorganized as Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 220th Military Police Brigade. Prior to the Iraq War, the brigade remained on reserve status, prepared to deploy if needed, but it was never called upon for any contingency operations or conflicts, as other active duty military police commands, primarily the 16th Military Police Brigade, were called upon to <b>be</b> <b>deployed</b> instead. By 1999, after 40 years of existence, the brigade had yet to <b>be</b> <b>deployed</b> to a foreign theater of operations or participate in any conflicts or contingencies.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the Cold War, the US Army {{considered}} new {{options for}} the integration and organization of active duty, Army Reserve and Army National Guard units in training and deployment. Two division headquarters activated in the active duty component for training National Guard units. The 7th Infantry Division and the 24th Infantry Division headquarters were selected.

5|$|Autonomous {{underwater}} vehicles (AUVs) and {{remotely operated}} underwater vehicles (ROVs) can carry out some functions of divers. They can <b>be</b> <b>deployed</b> at greater depths and in more dangerous environments. An AUV is a robot which travels underwater without requiring real-time input from an operator. AUVs constitute {{part of a}} larger group of unmanned undersea systems, a classification that includes non-autonomous ROVs, which are controlled and powered from the surface by an operator/pilot via an umbilical or using remote control. In military applications AUVs are often referred to as unmanned undersea vehicles (UUVs).|$|E

5|$|Communication plans {{should be}} made {{beforehand}} to inform of mitigation actions being undertaken. Spare parts and back-up systems should be in place prior to ash fall events to reduce service disruption and return functionality as quickly as possible. Good preparedness also includes the identification of ash disposal sites, before ash fall occurs, to avoid further movement of ash and to aid clean-up. Protective equipment such as eye protection and dust masks should <b>be</b> <b>deployed</b> for clean-up teams in advance of ash fall events.|$|E
5|$|Device Firmware Upgrade (DFU) is a vendor- and device-independent {{mechanism}} for upgrading the firmware of USB devices with improved versions provided by their manufacturers, offering (for example) {{a way for}} firmware bugfixes to <b>be</b> <b>deployed.</b> During the firmware upgrade operation, USB devices change their operating mode effectively becoming a PROM programmer. Any class of USB device can implement this capability by following the official DFU specifications.|$|E
5|$|During August 2016, it was {{announced}} that 650 soldiers of the British Army would <b>be</b> <b>deployed</b> on an enduring basis in Eastern Europe, mainly in Estonia with some also being deployed to Poland.

50|$|The CH-146 Griffon have <b>been</b> <b>deployed</b> {{in various}} {{operations}} in Canada since their introduction in 1995. They have <b>been</b> <b>deployed</b> during the Operation Saguenay in 1996 and Operation Assistance in 1997. The CH-146 have {{also played a}} major role during the great ice storm of 1998. They <b>were</b> <b>deployed</b> during the 28th G8 summit and 36th G8 summit. They <b>were</b> also <b>deployed</b> to secure the 2010 Winter Olympics during the Operation Podium.

5|$|During World War II, Keating was {{stationed}} in the U.S., sometimes at Banana Creek in Florida, and flew Hellcats to armed services swimming meets. He narrowly escaped serious injury one night at Naval Air Station Vero Beach when he neglected to lower the landing gear on his Hellcat and wrecked the plane in an unexpected belly landing. Due to additional training on new intercept methods and the vagaries of squadron transfers, the war ended before he would <b>be</b> <b>deployed</b> to any combat theater.|$|E
5|$|During late 1969, Phase IV sensors {{began to}} <b>be</b> <b>deployed</b> in-theater. These {{had a greater}} number of {{available}} communications channels, which allowed the seeding of a larger sensor field without fear of signal interference. By 1971–1972 a new sensor with a commandable microphone (COMMMIKE III) and another with a vehicle ignition detector (EDET III, which could detect the unshielded ignition systems of gasoline engines) were introduced. In 1972 U.S. dollars the ADSID cost $619.00, the ACOUSID $1,452.00, and the engine detector $2,997.00. During the life of the operation approximately 20,000 sensors were deployed in Laos.|$|E
5|$|From May 1945 No.75 Squadron {{participated in}} the Borneo Campaign. While the squadron's ground crew landed on Tarakan with the {{invasion}} force in early May 1945, delays with repairing the island's airfield meant that its aircraft could not <b>be</b> <b>deployed</b> there until mid-July rather than 3May as had been originally planned. During this period No.75 Squadron's pilots remained at Morotai but conducted little flying, causing their morale to decline. Once established at Tarakan the Kittyhawks attacked targets near Sandakan and supported Australian forces during the Battle of Balikpapan in the war's last weeks.|$|E
50|$|Railway {{artillery}} {{became a}} permanent {{part of the}} CA, but <b>was</b> not widely <b>deployed.</b> All 47 8-inch railway guns <b>were</b> <b>deployed,</b> but only 16 of the 91 12-inch railway mortars <b>were</b> <b>deployed</b> at any one time.|$|R

A task group of CF-18s and CH-146 Griffons <b>were</b> <b>deployed</b> during [...] "Operation Grizzly" [...] to Kananaskis, Alberta in June 2002 where they <b>were</b> <b>deployed</b> to secure the airspace during the 28th G8 summit. In 2007, {{an unknown number of}} CF-18s <b>were</b> <b>deployed</b> to Alaska. They <b>were</b> <b>deployed</b> during two weeks to defend United States airspace {{as a result of the}} primary USAF F-15 fighter jet fleet being grounded due to structural defects. They <b>were</b> also <b>deployed</b> during [...] "Operation Podium" [...] to secure the 2010 Winter Olympics and 2010 Winter Paralympics games.|$|R
5|$|Hundreds of {{soldiers}} from the 29th Infantry Division completed nine days of training on 16 June 2001 at Fort Polk, Louisiana, to prepare for their peacekeeping mission in Bosnia, as the second division headquarters to <b>be</b> <b>deployed</b> {{as a part of}} SFOR 10. In all, 2,085 National Guard soldiers from 16 states from Massachusetts to California served with the multinational force that operated in the US sector, MND-N. Their rotation began in October 2001 and lasted six months.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, Westland made an {{unsuccessful}} unsolicited offer to the British Ministry of Defence, proposing an enhanced Merlin variant intended {{to satisfy the}} demand for additional lift capacity. An alternative measure was the acquisition of six AW101s from Denmark in 2007; designated Merlin HC3A, these {{were assigned to the}} RAF, allowing Merlins to <b>be</b> <b>deployed</b> in Afghanistan. The HC3A is used for training and not for frontline operations due to various configuration differences. In December 2007, a second Merlin squadron, No. 78 Squadron was formed at RAF Benson.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the Cold War, the US Army {{considered}} new options for the integration and organization of active duty, Army Reserve and Army National Guard units in training and deployment. Two active duty division headquarters were activated for training National Guard units; those of the 7th Infantry Division and the 24th Infantry Division. The subordinate brigades of the divisions did not activate, so they could not <b>be</b> <b>deployed</b> as combat divisions. Instead, the headquarters units focused on full-time training.|$|E
