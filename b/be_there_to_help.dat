25|$|Anti-lock brakes are {{the subject}} of some {{experiments}} centred around risk compensation theory, which asserts that drivers adapt to the safety benefit of ABS by driving more aggressively. In a Munich study, half a fleet of taxicabs was equipped with anti-lock brakes, while the other half had conventional brake systems. The crash rate was substantially the same for both types of cab, and Wilde concludes this was due to drivers of ABS-equipped cabs taking more risks, assuming that ABS would take care of them, while the non-ABS drivers drove more carefully since ABS would not <b>be</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> in case of a dangerous situation.|$|E
500|$|The {{main event}} at No Surrender was a No Surrender Dog Collar {{match for the}} NWA World Heavyweight Championship between then-champion Raven and the {{challenger}} Abyss. On the June24 episode of Impact!, James Mitchell returned to the promotion in a backstage segment with Abyss. Mitchell propositioned Abyss {{on the idea of}} an NWA World Heavyweight Championship match, which Abyss agreed to, creating a partnership between the two. With Mitchell as Abyss' new manager, Abyss attacked Raven later during the show, setting up a match between the two at the PPV. Raven challenged Abyss to a Dog Collar match with [...] "No Surrender" [...] rules in which the only way to win was by pinfall at No Surrender on the July1 episode of Impact!, which was accepted. During the July 15 episode of Impact!, Cassidy Reilly pledged his allegiance to Raven for past experiences in which Raven had saved him, going on to state he would <b>be</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> Raven anytime he needed it.|$|E

60|$|O! the starting-holes {{that the}} heart hath {{in the time}} of prayer; none knows how many bye-ways the heart hath, and back-lanes, to slip away from the {{presence}} of God. How much pride also, if enabled with expressions. How much hypocrisy, if before others. And how little conscience is there made of prayer between God and the soul in secret, unless the Spirit of supplication <b>be</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> <b>help?</b> When the Spirit gets into the heart, then there is prayer indeed, and not till then.|$|E
60|$|And Marian {{was ready}} to forgive them for the delay when she saw how glad it made Lionel look. Yes, rejoiced as she must be to escape from Oakworthy, she could not go without a {{chequered}} feeling. If she was adroit at managing people, she would make Clara take the place she held now with Lionel, which {{would be good for}} both, but she was far too clumsy to bring that about; and O! what a refuge Fern Torr would be after all this harassing life! It would be better for Lionel not to have her to divert his confidence from his own family, and at any rate she should <b>be</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> him through this sad autumn of uncertainty. Then would come the peace, rest, and guidance she had longed for all her life, in her own home, and that hope might well cheer her through life.|$|E
60|$|But, I am {{ashamed to}} say, {{it was all}} very {{different}} in the Boy's Town; and I might as well make a clean breast of it while I am about it. The fellows in that town were every one dreadfully lazy--that is, they never wanted to do any thing they were set to do; but if they set themselves to do anything, they would work themselves to death at it. In this alone I understand that they differed by a whole world's difference from the boys who read Harper's Young People. I am almost afraid to confess how little moral strength most of those long-ago boys had. A fellow would be very good at home, really and truly good, {{and as soon as he}} got out with the other fellows he would yield to almost any temptation to mischief that offered, and if none offered he would go and hunt one up, and would never stop till he had found one, and kept at it till it overcame him. The spirit of the boy's world is not wicked, but merely savage, as I have often said in this book; it is the spirit of not knowing better. That is, the prevailing spirit is so. Here and there a boy does know better, but he is seldom a leader among boys; and usually he is ashamed of knowing better, and rarely tries to do better than the rest. He would like to please his father and mother, but he dreads the other boys and what they will say; and so the light of home fades from his ignorant soul, and leaves him in the outer darkness of the street. It may be that it must be so; but it seems a great pity; and it seems somehow as if the father and the mother might keep with him in some word, some thought, and <b>be</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> him against himself, whenever he is weak and wavering. The trouble is that the father and mother are too often children in their way, and little more fit to be the guide than he.|$|E
