40|$|In total 1216 {{vegetables}} {{obtained from}} Dutch stores during 2012 and 2013 were analysed {{to determine the}} prevalence of 3 rd-generation cephalosporin (3 GC) resistant bacteria on soil-grown fresh produce possibly consumed raw. Vegetables grown conventionally and organically, from Dutch as well as foreign origin were compared. Included were the following vegetable types; <b>blanched</b> <b>celery</b> (n= 192), bunched carrots (n= 190), butterhead lettuce (n= 137), chicory (n= 96), endive (n= 188), iceberg lettuce (n= 193) and radish (n= 120). Overall, 3 GC-resistant Enterobacteriaceae were detected on 5. 2 % of vegetables. Based on primary habitat and mechanism of 3 GC-resistance, these bacteria could be divided into four groups: ESBL-producing faecal species (Escherichia coli, Enterobacter spp.), AmpC-producing faecal species (Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter spp.), ESBL-producing environmental species (Pantoea spp., Rahnella aquatilis, Serratia fonticola), and AmpC-producing environmental species (Cedecca spp., Hafnia alvei, Pantoea spp., Serratia plymuthica), which were detected on 0. 8 %, 1. 2 %, 2. 6 % and 0. 4 % of the vegetables analysed, respectively. Contamination with faecal 3 GC-resistant bacteria was most frequently observed in root and bulb vegetables (average prevalence 4. 4 %), and less frequently in stem vegetables (prevalence 1. 6 %) and leafy greens (average prevalence 0. 6 %). In Dutch stores, only four of the included vegetable types (<b>blanched</b> <b>celery,</b> bunched carrots, endive, iceberg lettuce) were available in all four possible variants: Dutch/conventional, Dutch/organic, foreign/conventional, foreign/organic. With respect to these vegetable types, {{no statistically significant difference}} was observed in prevalence of 3 GC-resistant Enterobacteriaceae between country of origin or cultivation type (5. 2 %, 5. 7 %, 5. 7 % and 3. 3 %, respectively). Vegetables consumed raw may be a source of dissemination of 3 GC-resistant Enterobacteriaceae and their resistance genes to humans. The magnitude of the associated public health risk presumably depends on the types of bacteria that are ingested, i. e., faecal or environmental species, and may therefore be higher for root and bulb vegetables compared to leafy greens...|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} {{kinetics}} of dehydration process was investigated according to dehydration temperature changes, samples dimensions and technological treatment of samples. Investigations were conducted at two working temperatures: 50 °C and 75 °C. Samples were cut into 5 x 5 x 5 mm cubes and 20 x 5 x 1 mm gratings. Tests {{were carried out}} on fresh and <b>blanched</b> samples. <b>Celery</b> samples dehydration was performed in a laboratory infrared dryer (DIR) Mettler LJ 16 (Mettler, Switzerland). Sample mass changes were followed during dehydration. For all process conditions (dehydration temperature, sample dimensions and technological treatment), the mass content of dry matter in samples, moisture content, diffusion coefficient and dehydration rate were determined. Diffusion coefficient was the highest for celery gratings at temperature of 75 °C – 2. 38 x 10 – 6 m 2 min– 1, and the lowest for celery cubes at temperature of 50 °C – 1. 4 x 10 – 6 m 2 min– 1...|$|R
