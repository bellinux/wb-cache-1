5|$|As {{early as}} May 1941, the NDH had asked Germany for, among other things, 22 Messerschmitt Bf 109s. Instead, they {{got some of}} the {{remaining}} largely obsolete aircraft of the VVKJ. At the same time, Germany appropriated six captured Dornier Do 17K bombers, which were then supplied to <b>Bulgaria.</b> <b>Romania</b> received six ex-VVKJ Hawker Hurricanes, as well as six Bristol Blenheims, whilst Finland received 20 half-completed Blenheims, together with manufacturing tools and production equipment, as well as a huge variety of spare parts.|$|E
5|$|Benzylpiperazine (BZP) is a {{recreational}} drug with euphoriant and stimulant properties. The effects produced by BZP {{are comparable to}} those produced by amphetamine. Adverse effects have been reported following its use including acute psychosis, renal toxicity and seizures. No deaths have been reported following a sole ingestion of BZP, {{although there have been}} at least two deaths from the combination of BZP and MDMA. Its sale is banned in several countries, including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United States, the Republic of Ireland, the United Kingdom, <b>Bulgaria,</b> <b>Romania</b> and other parts of Europe.|$|E

5|$|The Armeeoberkommando (AOK) {{acknowledged}} that an undefeated Serbia severed Austria-Hungary's {{connection to the}} Ottoman Empire and prevented {{the completion of the}} Berlin–Baghdad railway. The AOK also realized that the Austro-Hungarian Army's inability to defeat Serbia would discourage neutral countries—such as <b>Bulgaria,</b> <b>Romania</b> and Greece—from joining the Central Powers and would tempt Italy to open up a third front against Austria-Hungary. Nevertheless, the AOK was hesitant to authorize a third invasion of Serbia. This changed in September 1914, when Austro-Hungarian troops discovered a map in an abandoned Semlin bookshop, titled The New Division of Europe. Originally printed in a Russian newspaper, the map was widely sold in Serbia and depicted the borders of Europe as they would appear following the war. Germany was to be divided into northern and southern confederations and Austria-Hungary was to be abolished, its eastern provinces given to Russia, Romania, the Czechs and the Hungarians, and its southern provinces divided between Serbia and Italy. Alarmed by the prospect of Austria-Hungary's disintegration, Emperor Franz Joseph personally authorized a third invasion of Serbia in early October 1914.|$|E

40|$|EU's 2007 {{enlargement}} by <b>Bulgaria</b> and <b>Romania</b> is {{evaluated by}} applying a simple macroeconomic integration model able to encompass {{as many of}} the theoretically predicted integration effects possible. The direct integration effects of <b>Bulgaria</b> and <b>Romania</b> spill-over to EU 15, including Austria and the 10 new member states of the 2004 EU enlargement. The pattern of the integration effects is qualitatively similar to those of EU?s 2004 enlargement by 10 new member states. <b>Bulgaria</b> and <b>Romania</b> gain much more from EU accession than the incumbents in the proportion of 20 : 1. In the medium-run up to 2020, <b>Bulgaria</b> and <b>Romania</b> can expect a sizable overall integration gain, amounting to additional 2 percentage point real GDP growth per annum.

25|$|The {{discovery}} of the Tărtăria tablets in Romania by Nicolae Vlassa in 1961 reignited the debate. Vlassa believed the inscriptions to be pictograms and other items found {{at the same place}} were subsequently carbon-dated to before 4000 BC (the tablets themselves cannot be dated by physical or chemical methods), thirteen hundred years earlier than the date he expected, and earlier even than the writing systems of the Sumerians and Minoans. However, the authenticity of these tablets is disputed. To date, more than a thousand fragments with similar inscriptions have been found on various archaeological sites throughout south-eastern Europe, notably in Greece (Dispilio Tablet), <b>Bulgaria,</b> <b>Romania,</b> eastern Hungary, Moldova, and southern Ukraine.|$|E
25|$|Air and {{maritime}} transport is developing in Georgia, {{with the former}} mainly used by passengers and the latter for transport of freight. Georgia currently has four international airports; the largest of which is by far Tbilisi International Airport, hub for Georgian Airways, which offers connections to many large European cities. Other airports {{in the country are}} largely underdeveloped or lack scheduled traffic, although, as of late, efforts have been made to solve both these problems. There are a number of seaports along Georgia's Black Sea coast, the largest and most busy of which is the Port of Batumi; whilst the town is itself a seaside resort, the port is a major cargo terminal in the Caucasus and is often used by neighbouring Azerbaijan as a transit point for making energy deliveries to Europe. Scheduled and chartered passenger ferry services link Georgia with <b>Bulgaria,</b> <b>Romania,</b> Turkey and Ukraine.|$|E
25|$|While <b>Bulgaria</b> and <b>Romania,</b> which {{joined the}} EU in 2007, are also legally bound {{to join the}} Schengen Area, {{implementation}} has been delayed. <b>Bulgaria's</b> and <b>Romania's</b> bids to join the Schengen Area were approved by the European Parliament in June 2011 but rejected by the Council of Ministers in September 2011, with the Dutch and Finnish governments citing concerns about shortcomings in anti-corruption measures and {{in the fight against}} organised crime. Concern has also been expressed about the potential influx of illegal migrants through Turkey to <b>Bulgaria</b> and <b>Romania</b> and then to present Schengen countries. Although the original plan was for Schengen Area to open its air and sea borders with <b>Bulgaria</b> and <b>Romania</b> by March 2012, and land borders by July 2012, continued opposition from Germany, Finland and the Netherlands has delayed the two countries' entry to the Schengen Area.|$|R

25|$|G. nivalis is {{the best-known}} and most {{widespread}} {{representative of the}} genus Galanthus. It is native to a large area of Europe, stretching from the Pyrenees in the west, through France and Germany to Poland in the north, Italy, northern Greece, <b>Bulgaria,</b> <b>Romania,</b> Ukraine, and European Turkey. It has been introduced and is widely naturalised elsewhere. Although it is often {{thought of as a}} British native wild flower, or to have been brought to the British Isles by the Romans, it was probably introduced around the early 16th century and is currently not a protected species in the UK. It was first recorded as naturalised in the UK in Worcestershire and Gloucestershire in 1770. Most other Galanthus species are from the eastern Mediterranean, but several are found in southern Russia, Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan. Galanthus fosteri comes from Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, Turkey, and maybe Israel.|$|E
25|$|On July 2, 1966 (June 19 on the Julian calendar), St. John {{died while}} visiting Seattle {{at a time}} and place he was said to have foretold.

In 1994 he was solemnly glorified on the 28th anniversary of his death. His unembalmed relics now occupy a shrine in the cathedral's nave. His feast day is celebrated on the Saturday nearest to July 2.

25|$|In November 1943, Stalin {{met with}} Churchill and Roosevelt in Tehran, a {{location}} of Stalin's choosing. There, Stalin and Roosevelt got on well, with both desiring the post-war {{dismantling of the}} British Empire. At Tehran, the trio agreed that to prevent Germany rising to military prowess yet again, the German state should be broken up. Roosevelt and Churchill also agreed to Stalin's demand that the German city of Konigsberg be declared Soviet territory. Stalin was impatient for the UK and US {{to open up a}} Western Front to take the pressure off of the East; they eventually did so in the summer of 1944. Stalin insisted that, after the war, the Soviet Union should incorporate the portions of Poland it occupied pursuant to the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact with Germany, which Churchill opposed. Discussing the fate of the Balkans, later in 1944 Churchill agreed to Stalin's suggestion that after the war, <b>Bulgaria,</b> <b>Romania,</b> Hungary, and Yugoslavia would come under the Soviet sphere of influence while Greece would come under that of the West.|$|E
25|$|Soon the Balkan rebellions were {{beginning}} to falter. In Europe, papers were filled with reports of Ottoman soldiers killing thousands of Slavs. Even in Great Britain William Ewart Gladstone published his account of Ottoman atrocities in his Bulgarian Horrors and the Question of the East. Soon, a new Russo-Turkish war had begun. Despite fighting better than they ever had before, the advanced Ottoman armies still were not equal to the Russian forces. This time there was no help from abroad, in truth many European nations supported the Russian war, {{as long as it}} did not get too close to Istanbul. Ten and a half months later when the war had ended the age of Ottoman domination over the Balkans was over. The Ottomans had fought well, the new navy of Ironclads had won the battle for the Black Sea, and Russian advances in the Caucasus had been kept minimal. In the Balkans, however, the Russian army, supported by rebels, had pushed the Ottoman army out of <b>Bulgaria,</b> <b>Romania,</b> and much of East Rumelia {{and by the end of}} the war the artillery firing in Thrace could be heard in Constantinople.|$|E
25|$|Jill Upton {{was named}} the head coach, and Billie Jean Moore the {{assistant}} coach of the team representing the USA at the World University Games held in Moscow, Soviet Union in August 1973. The event, also called the Universiade, is the eighth event to have women's basketball, but the first in which the USA participated. The USA team {{was assigned to the}} same preliminary round group as the Soviet team, and drew them as their first opponent. The game was not close, as the USSR defeated the USA 92–43. The USA went on to defeat France and Mexico. Their 2–1 record qualified them for the medal round, but the rules of the competition carried the preliminary round results into the medal round, so they could not afford another loss. They won their next three games, all by single digit margins, against <b>Bulgaria,</b> <b>Romania</b> and Cuba. That performance qualified the USA team for the gold medal game, but it matched them up against undefeated USSR. While the game was closer, the Soviets were much too strong and won 82–44 to claim the gold. The USA team earned a silver medal in their first ever World University Games competition.|$|E
