40|$|A {{practical}} and inexpensive implementation of dimmable electronic <b>ballast</b> <b>for</b> <b>compact</b> fluorescent <b>lamps</b> is presented. Popular triac dimmer {{is used for}} dimming control, while phase-control methodology is employed in eliminating extra control wires. Various types of passive power factor correctors are examined in replacing active power factor correctors to reduce cost {{and complexity of the}} ballast. Charge pump techniques are being investigated in improving the power factor. To achieve stable control of the lamp, especially when it is dimmed down to 10 % of its maximum intensity, a novel application of switching frequency modulation is introduced. To minimize the effect due to fluctuation of the power line, feedforward control is added. The design of EMI (electromagnetic interference) filter is discussed, in arriving at a good performance lighting system. The thesis also discusses technical details of peripheral circuits for start up, dc supply, and automatic shutdown at low intensity...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a rationale for}} seeking increased use of dedicated pin-base fixtures <b>for</b> <b>compact</b> fluorescent <b>lamps</b> in residential applications and outlines {{the need for a}} national strategy to accelerate their adoption. About three billion light fixtures illuminate America’s 96 million homes. Each year, 500 + domestic and foreign manufacturers collectively sell about 165 million residential fixtures with a retail value of over four billion dollars, half of which are imported. Approximately 60 % of U. S. residential fixture sales are hardwired and 40 % are portable. In terms of energy use and market sales, ceiling-mounted fixtures and table lamps emerge as among the most significant segments of the market. A fundamental market barrier <b>for</b> <b>compact</b> fluorescent <b>lamps</b> (CFLs) is that screw-base systems often perform extremely poorly once installed within fixtures. Our measurements show up to a 75 % loss in nominal CFL light output when the suboptimal thermal and optical environment within fixtures is accounted for. We also find that the ideal CFL lamp type varies as a function of fixture type. With hardwired, dedicated CFL fixtures the lighting designer has the opportunity to develop a marriage between fixture and source leading to appropriate aesthetic and photometric integration, necessary functions if CFLs are to have a lasting place in the residential market place. Dedicated fixtures designed for optimal thermal and optical operation of CFLs also offer a solution least likely to allow a “snap back ” to less efficient incandescent sources...|$|R

2500|$|White LEDs have {{advanced}} to the stage where they are a good substitute <b>for</b> the <b>compact</b> fluorescent <b>lamp.</b> The latest types are exhibiting superior efficacies (mostly because no power is wasted on powering heated cathodes) and a choice of 'colour temperature'. The most common type consists of a blue light emitting diode with a coating of cerium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet which produces yellow light when the blue light from the diode lands on it. The combination of the yellow and blue light produces white light. [...] LED bulbs have a long life of around 25,000 hours.

40|$|The present {{research}} aimed to investigate some lighting characteristics of six commercial <b>compact</b> fluorescent <b>lamps</b> (CFLs). The lighting {{characteristics such as}} spectral power distributions (SPDs), and spectral mismatch correction factor (SCF) to human response eye curve V(λ) have important roles on visual health effects of the lamps.

40|$|This article {{presents}} an analysis and {{discussion on the}} performance of a circuit-based model <b>for</b> <b>Compact</b> Fluorescent <b>Lamps</b> (CFL) in a 120 V 60 Hz power grid. This model is proposed and validated in previous scientific literature for CFLs in 230 V 50 Hz systems. Nevertheless, the derivation of this model is not straightforward to follow and its performance in 120 V 60 Hz systems is a matter of research work. In this paper, the analytical derivation of this CFL model is presented in detail and its performance is discussed when predicting the current of a CFL designed to operate in a 120 V 60 Hz electrical system. The derived model is separately implemented in both MATLAB® and ATP-EMTP® software using two different sets of parameters previously proposed for 230 V 50 Hz CFLs. These simulation results are compared against laboratory measurements using a programmable AC voltage source. The measurements and simulations considered seven CFLs 110 / 127 V 60 Hz with different power ratings supplied by a sinusoidal (not distorted) voltage source. The simulations under these conditions do not properly predict the current measurements and therefore the set of parameters and/or the model itself need to be adjusted for 120 V 60 Hz power grids...|$|R
40|$|Human {{exposure}} to electric and magnetic fields has been amply investigated in the extremely-low frequency (ELF) and radiofrequency (RF) ranges.

The emissions contained either harmonic signals, with fundamental frequencies between 6 kHz and 100 kHz, or much more capricious spectra, dominated by 50 Hz harmonics emanating far in the IF domain. Use of appliances at close distance (20 cm) of certain appliances may result in a relatively high exposure, but no appliance's IF emissions exceeded the ICNIRP 2010 exposure summation rule (maximum electric-and magnetic-field exposure quotients were respectively 1. 00, <b>for</b> a <b>compact</b> fluorescent <b>lamp,</b> and 0. 13, for an induction cooker) ...|$|R

Intensity variation effects due to vibration are attributed to the dropping off loose phosphor coatings in the inside wall of the glass enclosures. This effect is more pronounced in CFLs compared to LED luminaires due to the difference in the way the phosphor is coated/sandwiched...|$|R
40|$|Several factors {{limit the}} energy savings {{potential}} {{and increase the}} costs of energy-efficient technologies to consumers. These factors may usefully be placed into two categories; one category is what economists would define as market failures {{and the other is}} related to consumer preferences. This paper provides a conceptual framework for understanding the roles of these factors, and develops a methodology to quantify their effects on costs and potentials of two energy efficient end uses - residential lighting and clothes washers. It notes the significant roles played by the high implicit cost of obtaining information about the benefits of the two technologies and the apparent inability to process and utilize information. <b>For</b> <b>compact</b> fluorescent <b>lamps,</b> this report finds a conservative estimate of the cost of conserved energy of 3. 1 cents per kWh.

About 18 million tons of CO 2 could be saved cost effectively from 2005 sales of these two technologies alone.

The present work {{focus on}} development of Electronic Ballast having almost unity power factor (UPF) improved power quality. The electronic ballast {{consists of a}} PFC (power factor corrected) Boost converter, which operates in discontinuous conduction mode (DCM), and a high frequency DC-AC inverter. It overcomes the drawback of [1] operating the boost converter in open loop by operating the boost converter in closed loop to provide a constant power to the load within in the specified ratings irrespective {{of the changes in}} the load. It uses less number of inductors and capacitors which reduces the cost of the total equipment, especially at high voltage ratings capacitor and inductor cost becomes more and overcomes the drawback of [2] high cost at higher voltage ratings. In the Series Resonant Parallel Loaded Inverter zero voltage switching is achieved by keeping the switching frequency more than the resonance frequency, which reduces the switching losses and improves the efficiency of the Electronic Ballast. The simulation is carried out in MATLAB SIMULINK software. The High Frequency Electronic Ballast, a SRPLI is used to feed constant current to lamp for specified voltage range applications.
