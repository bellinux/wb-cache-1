5|$|Perhaps the most-quoted anecdote {{concerning}} Hardee was that, on 9 October 1986 {{his house}} was searched by the police – who were looking for crumbs – two days after he and others stole Freddie Mercury's £4,000 40th <b>birthday</b> <b>cake.</b> No crumbs were found at the house as he had already by then donated the cake to a local nursing home. He used this incident {{as the title of}} his 1996 autobiography I Stole Freddie Mercury's <b>Birthday</b> <b>Cake</b> which he wrote with John Fleming. In another encounter with the police, Hardee was once questioned by Special Branch officers after being found on the balcony outside government minister Michael Heseltine's hotel room, wearing nothing but a pair of socks and a leather coat containing £5,200 in cash and a pack of pornographic playing cards. He had mistaken the room for that of a friend.|$|E

50|$|Edible art {{refers to}} food created to be art. It is {{distinguished}} from Edible Arrangements (which predominantly consist of fruit) {{because it is}} usually more elaborate dessert food. A common form of edible art is wedding cakes, but options for artistic confections range far beyond marital celebrations. Cakes made into art include <b>birthday</b> <b>cakes,</b> cakes for baby showers, for graduation celebrations, and many other types of event. Each piece looks unique, even if created for the same event, because each creator has their own idea in mind when creating their food art.|$|R

25|$|Memorabilia are {{singular}} objects {{which are}} passed {{down through the}} family with the stories and memories about events or individuals attached to them. In one family a doll, given once as a Christmas present, continued to be brought out each year to celebrate Christmas and have her picture taken with the (changing) family. For her hundredth birthday, a <b>birthday</b> <b>cake</b> for the doll {{was included in the}} Christmas celebration. Like the doll, almost any object imbued with family stories and memories can become a family heirloom. As such, it holds in the family a value often unrelated to its monetary value. As the stories and memories enveloping the object are slowly lost, the object itself becomes a simple hand-me-down, usually in poor condition and ready to be discarded.|$|E
