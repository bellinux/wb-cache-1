40|$|Titanium-sapphire laser {{ablation}} of silicon {{was investigated in}} atmospheric air, water and 20 % KOH solution. The number of overlapping pulses was tuned between 3 and 1000 by changing the processing time. The ablated surfaces were investigated using scanning electron microscopy, X-ray microanalysis and stylus profilometry. In each ambient, plasma formation was observed during ab-lation. X-ray microanalysis indicated that the process starts with surface oxidation in case of air and water ambient. With increasing pulse number the surface was roughened, resulting in larger struc-tures. Crater formation was observed in air and in water, with higher etching rate in the latter case. The depth profile of the ablation holes and grooves is rather different for this two ambient. Narrow conical grooves were observed in case of ablation in air, while flat <b>bottom</b> <b>grooves</b> were produced in water. Laser processing in KOH solution {{did not result in}} etching, only the native oxide layer was removed. Etching occurred in these areas, if the samples were left in KOH solution for a longer time. Based on these observations the material removal by fs laser pulses is attributed to evaporation and reactions of Si with radicals in the laser induced plasma, such as atomic or ionic oxygen. The appli-cation of KOH introduces K ions or atoms into the laser induced plasma, which may react faster with oxygen than with Si, thus resulting in decrease in etching rate during laser processing...|$|E

30|$|According to the STM images {{displayed}} in Fig. 5, {{at the higher}} growth temperature, Ge islands nucleate exclusively at the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>grooves</b> and they rapidly transform from pyramids to domes as growth proceeds. On the contrary, at low-temperature Ge islands form predominantly {{on the top of}} the ridges and retain their pyramidal shape even up to 7 ML coverage and only slowly grow in size. At 520 °C, also the size of the sidewall ripple progressively increases with Ge coverage up to 7 ML, whereas the ripple amplitude quickly saturates at 600 °C. These observations indicate a large lateral mass transport and material redistribution at the higher growth temperature, whereas it is only very small at 520 °C, where lateral mass transport obviously only occurs on a very limited length scale. Indeed, at 520 °C, the average island distance is only around 40 nm, compared to more than 350 nm (=lateral stripe period) at 600 °C. The kinetically limited adatom diffusion at 520 °C leads to nearly conformal wetting layer growth up to 4 ML Ge coverage. Thus, the critical coverage for island formation is reached simultaneously at the ridges and the sidewall surfaces, where 3 D islands also form (see Fig. 5 b). At 600 °C, however, due to the higher adatom mobility, the capillary force arising from the high curvature at the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>grooves</b> [18] invokes a significant Ge downward mass transport. As a result, a flattening, i.e., filling of the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>grooves</b> occurs during Ge wetting layer growth as seen by STM in Fig. 5 d and thus, also ripple formation is delayed. The Ge transfer to the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>grooves</b> leads to a local thickening of the Ge layer and thus to an exclusive Ge island nucleation at the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>grooves.</b> Once formed, nearly all additionally deposited Ge is sucked into these islands due to the large energy gain associated with the elastic strain relaxation. Therefore, STM images recorded at higher coverages show that even up to 11 ML, no new islands are formed on any other surface location.|$|R

40|$|Semiconductor quantum wires (QWRs) are {{promising}} structures for optoelectronics applications, since {{they can provide}} quantum confinement for charge carriers in two dimensions. The advantage that they offer over conventional quantum wells (QWs) {{is due to the}} sharper density of states characteristic of these structures, yielding narrower spectral lines and higher optical gain. However, to exhibit clear confinement characteristics, QWRs must meet stringent requirements in terms of size, uniformity and interfacial quality. Different methods have been explored for QWR fabrication. Techniques based on etching and regrowth suffer from defect incorporation into the lateral interfaces, since they are not formed in situ, and are limited in size by the lithographic features. On the other hand, growth of fractions of monolayers on vicinal substrates, although overcoming the above limitations, gives rise to size nonuniformities and graded interfaces. In this project, (In) GaAs/AlxGa 1 -xAs QWRs are obtained by organometallic chemical vapor deposition (OMCVD) growth of quantum wells on patterned, V-grooved substrates. In this way, the lithographically defined pattern serves as a seed for QWR formation. The self-ordering properties of OMCVD on nonplanar surfaces ensure the creation of a self-limiting profile at the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>grooves,</b> on which the wires are grown. This method overcomes the size limitations imposed by lithography, allows the in situ formation of interfaces and, thanks to the self-ordering mechanism, yields structures with high uniformity, whose characteristics are determined solely by the growth conditions. Although nonplanar growth has been employed for more than ten years for QWR fabrication, the understanding of the self-ordering mechanisms originating the profiles at the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>grooves</b> has been until now only phenomenological. The attainment of self-limiting profiles takes place via transients of the growth rates at the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>groove.</b> Current models of nonplanar growth can predict the formation, evolution or disappearance of facets at the 100 nm-μm size. However, they cannot describe the transient behaviors at the nm scale that lead to self-limiting growth. This thesis project has been aimed at elucidating the physical mechanisms of this self-organized growth. A fundamental part of the project has been the creation of a wide experimental database to understand the dependence of the self-limiting profiles on the materials and growth conditions. The profiles at the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>groove</b> exhibit a faceted structure, consisting of a central (100) plane, surrounded by two { 311 }A ones. Cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (TEM) shows that the bottom facets become wider as the growth temperature increases and as the Al mole fraction x of AlxGa 1 -xAs layers decreases. It appears therefore that surface diffusion is a key element in determining self-limiting growth. TEM cross sections show also that the establishment of self-limiting profiles takes place via self-adjusting growth rates on these facets. In addition to this geometrical self-ordering, AlxGa 1 -xAs alloys exhibit also a compositional self-ordering at the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>groove.</b> Due to the higher mobility of Ga species, with respect to the Al ones, the facets at the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>groove</b> are Ga rich, with respect to the sidewall planes, giving rise to so-called vertical quantum wells (VQWs). To determine the composition of the VQWs, we have developed a technique employing cross-sectional atomic force microscopy (AFM) in air. This method is based on the dependence of the AlxGa 1 -xAs oxidation rates on the Al content x. Through a calibration on a reference sample, we were able to measure compositions with an accuracy of ± 0. 02. The enhanced Ga content of the VQWs follows classical models of segregation, and reaches a maximum of Δx ≅ 0. 15 for x ≅ 0. 55 at a growth temperature of 700 °C. We also studied the three dimensional structure of the self-limiting surface profiles by top-surface AFM in air of the nonplanar samples after cool-down and removal from the OMCVD reactor. Each of the planes composing the groove presents a monolayer step structure that reflects directly the morphology of surfaces of the same orientation found in planar epitaxy. However, on the facets forming on corrugated substrates the step structure exhibits a higher degree of ordering, with respect to planar epitaxy. This is due to a modification of surface diffusion, when the trench width becomes comparable to or lower than the adatom surface diffusion length. In {{the last part of the}} project, we have developed a model ascribing the self-ordering phenomena observed above to local variations of the surface chemical potential μ. Since μ becomes lower as the concavity of the surface increases, it induces a curvature-dependent capillarity flux towards the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>groove.</b> In the absence of capillarity, if the growth rate is higher on the sidewall planes than on the bottom facets, the capillarity-enhanced growth rate at the bottom can balance exactly the sidewall growth rate, thus leading to self-limiting growth. The different behavior of nonplanar OMCVD (where self-ordering is usually observed at the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>grooves)</b> and molecular beam epitaxy (where self-ordering rather takes place at the top of the corrugations) can be explained by the different growth rate anisotropies of the two techniques. In a ternary alloy, the composition is locally different at the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>groove,</b> due to the different diffusion lengths of Ga and Al. The resulting entropy of mixing, which is lower than the one for a uniform composition, tends however to oppose this segregation, thus affecting the alloy self-limiting profiles. The predictions of the model have been successfully verified on our OMCVD-grown profiles. They can be used to design and optimize a variety of nanostructures, including VQWs, QWRs and QWR superlattices in the GaAs/A 1 GaAs system, and can be further extended to the strained InGaAs/AlGaAs system...|$|R

30|$|In this work, in situ RHEED {{monitoring}} of Si and Ge growth on stripe-patterned Si substrates was demonstrated as a sensitive tool for controlling {{the changes in}} the pattern structure {{as well as of the}} island formation process. This allowed to observe the transformation of the pattern geometry from multifaceted “U” to single-faceted “V” stripes. For subsequent Ge growth, ripple and island formation was observed by RHEED and STM, from which the onset of 3 D islanding and sidewall roughening was precisely deduced. It was revealed that these processes significantly differ as a function of growth temperature, such that at 600 °C ripple formation is significantly delayed compared to low-temperature growth at 520 °C, whereas 3 D islands starts slightly earlier. This is explained by the higher adatom mobility at the higher growth temperature, which leads to a substantial downward mass transport to the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>grooves.</b> As a result, site-controlled growth of Ge islands aligned in the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>grooves</b> can be obtained only at 600 °C, whereas for lower temperatures islands nucleate randomly on the ridges as well as sidewalls of the stripes.|$|R
