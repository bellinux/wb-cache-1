40|$|We {{study the}} {{magnetic}} response of buckled honeycomb-lattice materials. The <b>buckling</b> <b>breaks</b> the sublattice symmetry, enhances the spin-orbit coupling, {{and allows the}} tuning of a topological quantum phase transition. As a result, there are two doubly degenerate spin-valley coupled massive Dirac bands, which exhibit an unconventional Hall plateau sequence under strong magnetic fields. We show how to externally control the splitting of anomalous zeroth Landau levels, the prominent Landau level crossing effects, and the polarizations of spin, valley, and sublattice degrees of freedom. In particular, we reveal that in a p-n junction, spin-resolved fractionally quantized conductance appears in a two-terminal measurement with a spin-polarized current propagating along the interface. In the low-field regime where the Landau quantization is not applicable, we provide a semiclassical description for the anomalous Hall transport. We comment briefly {{on the effects of}} electron-electron interactions and Zeeman couplings to electron spins and to atomic orbitals...|$|R
50|$|The wood wasp {{ovipositor}} {{contains two}} interlocking valves. Each valve {{is covered with}} teeth that are backward-facing. While the teeth of one valve catch onto the wood to provide resistance, the other valve moves forward taking a slight step. Then that valve catches the wood to provide resistance while the first valve moves forward. Thus by quick oscillation, the valves alternate in providing resistance and moving forward. This process leads in the ovipositor drilling almost an inch into the sapwood. The force used for this process is minimal. <b>Buckling</b> or <b>breaking</b> does not take place during the process.|$|R

Success was dependent on the presence of a correctly placed scleral <b>buckle</b> underlying all <b>breaks.</b> Surgical revision was thereby avoided in these patients. However, when the scleral buckle was inadequate the technique failed...|$|R
50|$|This was <b>Buckle's</b> big <b>break</b> {{and during}} the pre-war years {{and after the war}} until 1963 Buckle {{produced}} some estimated 85 posters and 25 carriage prints for the railways making him one of the most prolific and recognised railway poster artists. He was a close friend of Terence Cuneo whom he met frequently on travels around England recording scenes for the railway posters that were a common site on railway station platforms and booking halls. Both Artists have surviving artwork in the National Railway Museum NRM. However when the work started to dry up in 1963, following the Beeching Axe, Buckle relied more and more on the private market place to earn a living. On the advice of Terence Cuneo, he moved away almost entirely from oil painting to concentrate his efforts on watercolours.|$|R
40|$|Cell cortex {{remodeling}} during {{cell division}} {{is a result}} of myofilament-driven contractility of the cortical membrane-bound actin meshwork. Little is known about the interaction between individual myofilaments and membrane-bound actin filaments. Here we reconstituted a minimal actin cortex to directly visualize the action of individual myofilaments on membrane-bound actin filaments using TIRF microscopy. We show that synthetic myofilaments fragment and compact membrane-bound actin while processively moving along actin filaments. We propose a mechanism by which tension builds up between the ends of myofilaments, resulting in compressive stress exerted to single actin filaments, causing their buckling and breakage. Modeling of this mechanism revealed that sufficient force (∼ 20 pN) can be generated by single myofilaments to <b>buckle</b> and <b>break</b> actin filaments. This mechanism of filament fragmentation and compaction may contribute to actin turnover and cortex reorganization during cytokinesis...|$|R
40|$|Examples {{have been}} given of the {{principles}} {{to follow in the}} design of roof flashings. It has been recommended that base flashings are to be kept free of items penetrating a roof; that metal counter flashings are to be separated from the roofing membrane; and that metal counter flashings are to shed water and be free to move at end joints to prevent <b>buckling</b> or <b>breaking.</b> The flashings, of course, cannot be divorced from the over-all design of the building wall and roof systems. The roof, for instance, must be sloped to provide drainage, and the walls designed to control rain penetration. Because of this, all details of the complete water control system should be worked out by the building designer.

40|$|Cytokinesis and abscission are {{complicated}} events that involve changes in membrane transport and cytoskeleton organization. We {{have used the}} combination of time-lapse microscopy and correlative high-resolution 3 D tomography to analyze the regulation and spatio-temporal remodeling of endosomes and microtubules during abscission. We show that abscission {{is driven by the}} formation of a secondary ingression within the intracellular bridge connecting two daughter cells. The initiation and expansion of this secondary ingression requires recycling endosome fusion with the furrow plasma membrane and nested central spindle microtubule severing. These changes in endosome fusion and microtubule reorganization result in increased intracellular bridge plasma membrane dynamics and abscission. Finally, we show that central spindle microtubule reorganization is driven by localized microtubule <b>buckling</b> and <b>breaking,</b> rather than by spastin-dependent severing. Our results provide a new mechanism for mediation and regulation of the abscission step of cytokinesis...|$|R
40|$|A {{polysilicon}} bridge-slider {{structure in}} which {{one end of the}} bridge is fixed and the other is connected to a plate sliding in two flanged guideways, is designed and fabricated to study the strain at fracture of LPCVD polysilicon. In the experiments, a mechanical probe is used to push against the plate end, compressing and forcing the bridge to <b>buckle</b> until it <b>breaks.</b> The distance that the plate needs to be pushed to break the bridge is recorded. Nonlinear beam theory is then used to interpret the results of these axially-loaded-bridge experiments. The measured average fracture strain of as-deposited LPCVD polysilicon is 1. 72 %. High-temperature annealing of the bridge-sliders at 1000 °C for 1 h decreases the average fracture strain to 0. 93 %...|$|R
40|$|We {{have used}} {{multimode}} fluorescent speckle microscopy (FSM) and correlative {{differential interference contrast}} imaging to investigate the actin–microtubule (MT) interactions and polymer dynamics known to play {{a fundamental role in}} growth cone guidance. We report that MTs explore the peripheral domain (P-domain), exhibiting classical properties of dynamic instability. MT extension occurs preferentially along filopodia, which function as MT polymerization guides. Filopodial bundles undergo retrograde flow and also transport MTs. Thus, distal MT position is determined by the rate of plus-end MT assembly minus the rate of retrograde F-actin flow. Short MT displacements independent of flow are sometimes observed. MTs loop, <b>buckle,</b> and <b>break</b> as they are transported into the T-zone by retrograde flow. MT breakage results in exposure of new plus ends which can regrow, and minus ends which rapidly undergo catastrophes, resulting in efficient MT turnover. We also report a previously undetected presence of F-actin arc structures, which exhibit persistent retrograde movement across the T-zone into the central domain (C-domain) at ∼ 1 / 4 the rate of P-domain flow. Actin arcs interact with MTs and transport them into the C-domain. Interestingly, although the MTs associated with arcs are less dynamic than P-domain MTs, they elongate efficiently as a result of markedly lower catastrophe frequencies...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackground: In {{migrating}} cells, the retrograde flow of filamentous actin (f-actin) {{from the}} leading edge toward the cell body is accompanied by the synchronous motion of microtubules (MTs, [1]), whose plus ends undergo net growth. Thus, MTs must depolymerize elsewhere in the cell to maintain polymer mass over time. The source and location of depolymerized MTs is unknown. Here, we test the hypothesis that MT polymer loss occurs in central cell regions and is induced by the convergence of actin retrograde and anterograde flow, which <b>buckles</b> and <b>breaks</b> associated MTs and promotes minus-end depolymerization. Results: We characterized the effects of calyculin A and ML- 7 on the movement of f-actin and MTs by multi-spectral fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) and fluorescent speckle microscopy (FSM). Our studies show that these drugs affect the rate of f-actin and MT convergence and MT buckling in a central cell region we call the “convergence zone. ” Increases in f-actin convergence are associated with faster MT turnover {{and an increase in}} both MT breakage and minus-end depolymerization, but they have no effect on MT plus end dynamic instability. Conclusions: We propose that f-actin movement into the convergence zone {{plays a major role in}} spatially modulating MT turnover during cell migration by regulating MT breakage, and thus minus-end dynamics, in central cell regions...|$|R
2500|$|Boat 7 was {{the first}} to be launched, at about 12:40a.m., under the {{supervision}} of First Officer Murdoch, supported by Fifth Officer Lowe. It had a capacity of 65 persons but was lowered with only 28 aboard. The two officers had tried for some minutes to encourage passengers to board but they were reluctant to do so. Later testimony at the U.S. Senate inquiry into the disaster stated the ship's officers believed the lifeboats were at risk of <b>buckling</b> and <b>breaking</b> apart if they were lowered while fully loaded. They intended that once the boats reached the water they would pick up passengers from doors in the ship's side or would pick up passengers in the water. The first did not happen at all and the second only happened in one instance. In fact, the lifeboats had keels reinforced with steel beams to prevent buckling while in the davits. [...] Moreover, Harland & Wolff's Edward Wilding testified that the lifeboats had in fact been tested safely with the equivalent of a full load of passengers. However, the results had not been passed on to the crew of Titanic. [...] A significant degree of negligence in the training and continuing education of officers and crew in the White Star Line seems apparent, especially when noting the improper manner in which distress rockets were actually fired that night (regulations called for firing at one-minute intervals).|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackground: Interactions between microtubules and actin {{filaments}} (F-actin) {{are critical}} for cellular motility processes ranging from directed cell locomotion to cytokinesis. However, the cellular bases of these interactions remain poorly understood. We have analyzed the role of microtubules in generation of a contractile array comprised of F-actin and myosin- 2 that forms around wounds made in Xenopus oocytes. Results: After wounding, microtubules are transported to the wound edge in association with F-actin that is itself recruited to wound borders via actomyosin-powered cortical flow. This transport generates sufficient force to <b>buckle</b> and <b>break</b> microtubules at the wound edge. Transport is complemented by local microtubule assembly around wound borders. The region of microtubule breakage and assembly coincides with a zone of actin assembly, and perturbation of the microtubule cytoskeleton disrupts this zone {{as well as local}} recruitment of the Arp 2 / 3 complex and myosin- 2. Conclusions: The results reveal transport of microtubules in association with F-actin that is pulled to wound borders via actomyosin-based contraction. Microtubules, in turn, focus zones of actin assembly and myosin- 2 recruitment at the wound border. Thus, wounding triggers the formation of a spatially coordinated feedback loop in which transport and assembly of microtubules maintains actin and myosin- 2 in close proximity to the closing contractile array. These results are surprisingly reminiscent of recent findings in locomoting cells, suggesting that similar feedback interactions may be generally employed in a variety of fundamental cell motility processes...|$|R
40|$|We have {{discovered}} several novel features exhibited by microtubules (MTs) in migrating newt lung epithelial cells by time-lapse imaging of fluorescently labeled, microinjected tubulin. These cells exhibit leading edge ruffling and retrograde {{flow in the}} lamella and lamellipodia. The plus ends of lamella MTs persist in growth perpendicular to the leading edge until they reach {{the base of the}} lamellipodium, where they oscillate between short phases of growth and shortening. Occasionally “pioneering” MTs grow into the lamellipodium, where microtubule bending and reorientation parallel to the leading edge is associated with retrograde flow. MTs parallel to the leading edge exhibit significantly different dynamics from MTs perpendicular to the cell edge. Both parallel MTs and photoactivated fluorescent marks on perpendicular MTs move rearward at the 0. 4 μm/min rate of retrograde flow in the lamella. MT rearward transport persists when MT dynamic instability is inhibited by 100 -nM nocodazole but is blocked by inhibition of actomyosin by cytochalasin D or 2, 3 -butanedione– 2 -monoxime. Rearward flow appears to cause MT <b>buckling</b> and <b>breaking</b> in the lamella. 80 % of free minus ends produced by breakage are stable; the others shorten and pause, leading to MT treadmilling. Free minus ends of unknown origin also depolymerize into the field of view at the lamella. Analysis of MT dynamics at the centrosome shows that these minus ends do not arise by centrosomal ejection and that ∼ 80 % of the MTs in the lamella are not centrosome bound. We propose that actomyosin-based retrograde flow of MTs causes MT breakage, forming quasi-stable noncentrosomal MTs whose turnover is regulated primarily at their minus ends...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} based on {{analysis}} of rainfall data from 1951 - 2010 collected at the climatic station of Bamenda. We also use {{the results of a}} questionnaire survey applied to 172 households in at-risk neighborhoods. The inventory of some cases of flooding that occurred in the city of Bamenda was done through focus groups. The appreciation of the socio-economic and demographic environment {{is based on}} surveys among Cameroonian Households by the National Institute of Statistics (NIS) and General Census of Population and Housing. Statistical examination revealed that annual rainfall in the city of Bamenda experienced a break in 1958. This <b>break</b> <b>buckled</b> the wettest decade of the series. After three decades of worsening, rainfall is experiencing rising since early 1990. The average profile of the annual distribution of rainfall shows a concentration of over 53 % in 03 months (July, August and September). During these three months, the rivers of the city know their flood flows and populations in the valleys are affected. The analysis of the annual number of rainy days shows a downward trend and an increase of extreme rainfall event frequency (≥ 50 mm in 24 h). It is also apparent that more and more years are experiencing erratic distribution of their precipitation. Then, the perception of people is significantly reduced. Subsistence activities are also affected and development is facing new subtleties. In conclusion, the rainfall experienced strong variability in the city of Bamenda. This situation reinforces the risk of flooding by increasing flood water and increasing the vulnerability of populations...|$|R
40|$|International audienceHigh powered, {{nanosecond}} duration, pulsed electric fields (nsPEF) cause {{cell death}} by a mechanism that is not fully understood and have been proposed as a targeted cancer therapy. Numerous chemotherapeutics work by disrupting microtubules. As microtubules are affected by electrical fields, this study looks {{at the possibility of}} disrupting them electrically with nsPEF. Human glioblastoma cells (U 87 -MG) treated with 100, 10 ns, 44 kV/cm pulses at a frequency of 10 Hz showed a breakdown of their interphase microtubule network that was accompanied by a {{reduction in the number of}} growing microtubules. This effect is temporally linked to loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and independent of cellular swelling and calcium influx, two factors that disrupt microtubule growth dynamics. Super-resolution microscopy revealed microtubule <b>buckling</b> and <b>breaking</b> as a result of nsPEF application, suggesting that nsPEF may act directly on microtubules. Traditional cytotoxic chemotherapies are associated with severe side-effects and new generation targeted therapies can fail due to drug resistance. High powered, nanosecond duration pulsed electric fields (nsPEF) have been proposed as a minimal side-effect, electrical cancer therapy that is unlikely to result in resistance. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is an incurable brain cancer showing resistance to surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy 1. The need for an effective treatment for GBM, and its previously demonstrated sensitivity to pulsed electric fields 2, makes it of interest for targeting by nsPEF. Studies have demonstrated that nsPEF induce cell {{death by a}}poptosis and necrosis in vitro and reduce the size of tumours both in animal models and in humans 3 – 8. The effect of nsPEF on cells is characterized by nanopora-tion of the plasma membrane 3, 9 – 12, rapid phosphatidylserine externalisation 6, 13, 14, transient spikes in intracellular calcium concentration that are proportional to pulse intensity 3, 15 – 17, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (Δ Ψ m) 18, 19 and cellular swelling and blebbing 12, 20, 21. Apoptosis following nsPEF treatment can be either dependent or independent of caspase activation 6, 7, 13. Whilst nsPEF induced apoptotic death has been well studied, the mechanism whereby nsPEF triggers apoptosis remains unclear. Microtubules are hollow, cylindrical, structures composed of repeating α and β heterodimers of the protein tubulin. Forming part of the cell cytoskeleton, microtubules are highly dynamic structures subject to constant lengthening and shortening. In interphase cells they are nucleated in microtubule-organizing centres and grow out towards the cell periphery. Depolymerisation of the interphase microtubule network is an intrinsic, early event in the execution phase of normally occurring apoptosis, aiding phagocyte attachment 22 and the release of microtubule sequestering proapoptotic proteins 23. Due to the polarity of their protein structure and charge, it has been shown in vitro that purified microtubules will align with an electric field 24, 25 and that, in cells, electric fields can disrupt their polymerization 26. Given these properties, we hypothesized that nsPEF might have a direct effect on microtubules...|$|R
