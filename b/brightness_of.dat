5|$|During {{and after}} World War II, the Yehudi lights project {{developed}} counter-illumination camouflage using lamps {{to increase the}} <b>brightness</b> <b>of</b> the aircraft to match the <b>brightness</b> <b>of</b> the sky. This was abandoned with improvements in radar, which seemed to render visible light camouflage redundant. However, aircraft continue to be painted in camouflage schemes; recent experiments have again explored active camouflage systems which allow colors, patterns and brightness to be changed to match the background, and some air forces have painted their fighters in digital camouflage patterns. Stealth technology, as in the Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk, aims to minimize an aircraft's radar cross-section and infrared signature, effectively providing multi-spectral camouflage {{at the price of}} reduced flying performance. Stealth may extend to avoiding or preventing vapor contrails.|$|E

5|$|The <b>brightness</b> <b>of</b> a star, as {{seen from}} Earth, is {{measured}} with a standardized, logarithmic scale. This apparent magnitude is a numerical value that decreases in value with increasing <b>brightness</b> <b>of</b> the star. The faintest stars visible to the unaided eye are sixth magnitude, while the brightest, Sirius, is of magnitude −1.46. To standardize the magnitude scale, astronomers chose Vega to represent magnitude zero at all wavelengths. Thus, for many years, Vega {{was used as a}} baseline for the calibration of absolute photometric brightness scales. However, this is no longer the case, as the apparent magnitude zero point is now commonly defined in terms of a particular numerically specified flux. This approach is more convenient for astronomers, since Vega is not always available for calibration.|$|E
5|$|The {{supernova}} SN 1006 {{appeared in}} the southern constellation of Lupus during the year 1006 CE.

It may also have been noted in France, Syria, and North America. Egyptian physician, astronomer and astrologer Ali ibn Ridwan gave the <b>brightness</b> <b>of</b> this star as one-quarter the <b>brightness</b> <b>of</b> the Moon.

Although predicting the maximum apparent <b>brightness</b> <b>of</b> new comets with {{any degree of}} certainty is difficult, Hale–Bopp met or exceeded most predictions when it passed perihelion on April 1, 1997. It was {{visible to the naked eye}} for a record 18months, twice as long as the previous record holder, the Great Comet of 1811. Accordingly, Hale–Bopp was dubbed the Great Comet of 1997.|$|E
5|$|In {{many animals}} {{of the deep}} sea, {{including}} several squid species, bacterial bioluminescence is used for camouflage by counterillumination, in which the animal matches the overhead environmental light as seen from below. In these animals, photoreceptors control the illumination to match the <b>brightness</b> <b>of</b> the background. These light organs are usually separate from the tissue containing the bioluminescent bacteria. However, in one species, Euprymna scolopes, the bacteria are an integral component of the animal's light organ.|$|E
50|$|In practice, radio astronomers rarely {{recover the}} <b>brightness</b> {{distribution}} <b>of</b> a source by directly taking the inverse Fourier transform of a measured visibility function. Such a process {{would require a}} sufficient number of samples to satisfy the Nyquist sampling theorem; this is many more observations than are needed to approximately reconstruct the <b>brightness</b> distribution <b>of</b> the source. Astronomers therefore take advantage of physical constraints on the <b>brightness</b> distribution <b>of</b> astronomical sources {{to reduce the number of}} observations which must be made. Because the brightness distribution must be real and positive everywhere, the visibility function cannot take on arbitrary values in unsampled regions. Thus, a non-linear deconvolution algorithm like CLEAN or Maximum Entropy may be used to approximately reconstruct the <b>brightness</b> distribution <b>of</b> the source from a limited number of observations.|$|R

5|$|In the {{diffused}} lighting camouflage project, the Royal Canadian Navy experimented with variable counter-illumination camouflage to match horizon light levels and minimize ships' silhouettes during prolonged arctic twilight. During the experiments, {{one side of}} the test ship was faintly illuminated by projectors mounted outboard. Results were improved with the use of blue-green filters, and then with a photocell to measure the <b>brightness</b> <b>of</b> the night sky. The ship's visibility was reduced, but the technology was inconvenient and never adopted in practice.|$|E
5|$|Many main {{sequence}} stars of spectral type A {{fall into a}} region of the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram called the instability strip, which is occupied by pulsating variable stars. In 2003, photometric monitoring of the star revealed variations in <b>brightness</b> <b>of</b> around 1–2 millimagnitudes on frequencies between about 30 and 40 minutes. Radial velocity studies of Beta Pictoris also reveal variability: there are pulsations at two frequencies, one at 30.4 minutes and one at 36.9 minutes. As a result, the star is classified as a Delta Scuti variable.|$|E

M32 was discovered in 1749 by French astronomer Guillaume Le Gentil and has since been found to lie closer to Earth than the Andromeda Galaxy itself. It is viewable in binoculars from a dark site owing to its high surface <b>brightness</b> <b>of</b> 10.1 and overall magnitude of 9.0.
