Hunziger, is dying of {{pancreatic}} cancer, but maintains his distance from his son over the crime; his wife Adele, however, still believes her son to <b>be</b> <b>innocent.</b> Black visits the terminal Hunziger, hoping to change his mind, but the elderly man holds his position. Adele gives Black a folder full of documents relating to the case, which Black reviews.

5|$|Keseberg {{brought a}} {{defamation}} suit against {{several members of}} the relief party who accused him of murdering Tamsen Donner. The court awarded him $1 in damages, but also made him pay court costs. An 1847 story printed in the California Star described Keseberg's actions in ghoulish terms and his near-lynching by the salvage party, reporting that he preferred eating human flesh over the cattle and horses that had become exposed in the spring thaw. Historian Charles McGlashan amassed enough material to indict Keseberg for the murder of Tamsen Donner, but after interviewing Keseberg he concluded that no murder occurred. Eliza Donner Houghton also believed Keseberg to <b>be</b> <b>innocent.</b>|$|E

5|$|Thomas filmed a twelve-minute teaser for his {{new concept}} and {{presented}} it to The CW. The teaser was later released on the Veronica Mars third season DVD and the internet. The clip begins in medias res with Veronica, {{pretending to be a}} high schooler, talking to a teacher. The teaser flashes back to her first FBI meeting, and the viewers discover that she is investigating the teacher for sexual abuse allegations. She successfully catches the teacher on camera, and at the FBI, she runs into a former acquaintance named Seth. She investigates a potential bomber with another novice agent, and they speak to a man who appears to <b>be</b> <b>innocent.</b> However, he points a gun at Veronica's partner as the clip ends.|$|E
5|$|Watts later shows Black {{a picture}} {{taken at the}} murder scene, with Sammael {{recognizable}} among a crowd of people. Elsewhere, a man named Martin (Guy Fauchon) is arrested after slitting a babysitter's throat at a public park; despite the seemingly random nature of the crime, Black believes that the man may be connected to Bletcher's murder. However, he soon starts to suspect that Martin may <b>be</b> <b>innocent</b> of the crime he has been arrested for. Black also has a dream in which a mutilated Bletcher tries and fails to speak to him, which leads Black to believe he has lost his ability to see into the minds of others.|$|E
5|$|Mark befriends Stephanie Scully (Carla Bonner), {{and they}} share a kiss, before {{deciding}} to remain friends. After a jealous Paige fights with Steph, Mark and Steph have sex and begin a relationship. Following an explosion at Lassiter's Hotel, Mark finds evidence Paul was responsible and arrests him. Released on bail, Paul convinces Steph of his innocence, causing trouble in her and Mark's relationship. Tyler is later questioned and Mark {{is removed from the}} case. Mark raises the subject of having children with Steph and she tells him she is open to {{the idea of having a}} child with him in the future. Mark starts to think Paul could <b>be</b> <b>innocent,</b> but is threatened with dismissal if he continues to investigate. He later discovers that Jacka Hills (Brad McMurray) caused the explosion on Julie Quill's (Gail Easdale) orders. Mark investigates the release of snakes in Ramsay Street and soon realises that Steph is being stalked. Hearing that someone has made a confession to Father Jack Callahan (Andrew Morley), Mark bugs the confessional, despite being ordered not to. Mark learns from Steph's former girlfriend Belinda Bell (Nikki Shiels) that one of her patients Ari Philcox (Dylan Watson) is behind the release of the snakes.

His injuries are not life-threatening. Steph and Mark are saddened when Charlie has to return home. Sonya offers to be their surrogate, as Steph is wary of her mental health problems returning.

25|$|Opinion polls at {{the time}} of Corby's arrest in 2004 found that most Australians {{believed}} her to <b>be</b> <b>innocent.</b> Subsequently, an ACNielsen poll published in June 2005, a week after the verdict, found that opinion was divided whether Corby was guilty but there was a perception that the trial had not been carried out fairly. A Morgan poll at the same time found that 51 per cent of Australians believed she was not guilty. However, an August 2010 Nielsen poll found that 1 in 10 respondents believed Corby to <b>be</b> <b>innocent,</b> 41 per cent thought she was guilty, and 48 per cent did not know. Forty per cent of Australians believed Corby should have had her 20-year prison sentence reduced.|$|E
25|$|Ultimately, the Tsarist {{government}} officially {{recognized the}} Karaim as being of Turkic, not Jewish, origin. Because the Karaim were judged to <b>be</b> <b>innocent</b> {{of the death}} of Jesus, they were exempt from many of the harsh restrictions placed on other Jews. They were, in essence, placed on equal legal footing with Crimean Tatars. The related Krymchak community, which was of similar ethnolinguistic background but which practiced rabbinical Judaism, continued to suffer under Tsarist anti-Jewish laws.|$|E
25|$|Uekusa {{was arrested}} again at Keikyū Kamata Station for molesting {{a girl in}} a Keikyu train on September 13, 2006, at around 10:10p.m. On September 27, 2006, Nagoya University of Commerce & Business {{announced}} that they had dismissed him from his duties as a visiting professor.

25|$|After Jesus' {{return from}} Herod's court, Pilate {{publicly}} declares that he finds Jesus to <b>be</b> <b>innocent</b> of the charges, {{but the crowd}} insists on capital punishment. The universal rule of the Roman Empire limited capital punishment strictly to the tribunal of the Roman governor and Pilate decided to publicly wash his hands as not being privy to Jesus' death. Pilate thus presents himself as an advocate pleading Jesus' case {{rather than as a}} judge in an official hearing, yet he orders the crucifixion of Jesus.|$|E
25|$|Five {{years after}} the trial, former Lord Advocate, Lord Fraser, who issued the arrest {{warrants}} in 1991, was alleged to have {{said that he was}} not entirely happy with the evidence presented against Megrahi during his trial in 2000, and in his subsequent appeal in 2002. However, {{he made it clear that}} this did not mean that he believed Megrahi to <b>be</b> <b>innocent.</b> According to The Sunday Times of 23 October 2005, Lord Fraser allegedly cast doubt upon the reliability of the main prosecution witness, Tony Gauci.|$|E

In November 2008, Hobbs sued Maines and the Dixie Chicks for defamation {{as a result of her}} statements. On December 2, 2009 a U.S. federal judge dismissed the defamation case on the grounds that Hobbs had not shown the statements were made with actual malice.|$|E

Stotesbury, {{to come to the}} defense of Grace Fortescue, Edward J. Lord, Deacon Jones, and Thomas Massie, Fortescue's son-in-law, who were accused of murdering Joseph Kahahawai. Kahahawai had been accused, along with four other men, of raping and beating Thalia Massie, Thomas's wife and Fortescue's daughter; the {{resulting}} 1931 case ended in a hung jury (though the charges were later dropped and repeated investigation has shown them to <b>be</b> <b>innocent).</b> Enraged, Fortescue and Massie then orchestrated the murder of Kahahawai in order to extract a confession and were caught by police officers while transporting his dead body.|$|E
25|$|Miller's {{experience}} with the HUAC affected him throughout his life. In the late 1970s he became {{very interested in the}} highly publicized Barbara Gibbons murder case, in which Gibbons' son Peter Reilly was convicted of his mother's murder based on what many felt was a coerced confession and little other evidence. City Confidential, an A Network series, produced an episode about the murder, postulating that part of the reason Miller took such an active interest (including supporting Reilly's defense and using his own celebrity to bring attention to Reilly's plight) was because he had felt similarly persecuted in his run-ins with the HUAC. He sympathized with Reilly, whom he firmly believed to <b>be</b> <b>innocent</b> and to have been railroaded by the Connecticut State Police and the Attorney General who had initially prosecuted the case.|$|E
25|$|Carlos flees by {{shifting}} to the timeline that the copies of Diana and Sigma had been transported to.

They realize that only one team is active at a time, while the rest are kept asleep in the pods. Sean reveals Zero's true identity: he is Delta, an elderly man thought to be wheelchair-bound, deaf, blind and mute, who had been with Q-Team the entire time, but off-camera from the player's perspective. He admits that he killed Mira, and prevents the participants from escaping by using his esper abilities to make Eric shoot everyone but Diana.|$|E
