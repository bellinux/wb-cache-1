He {{quit his job}} as a machinery draughtsman in 1926 and began studying business intensively. As Nurmi started a new career as a share dealer, his financial advisors included Risto Ryti, director of the <b>Bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>Finland.</b> In 1926, Nurmi broke Wide's world record for the 3000 m in Berlin and then improved the record in Stockholm, despite Nils Eklöf repeatedly trying to slow his pace down in an effort to aid Wide. Nurmi was furious at the Swedes and vowed never to race Eklöf again. In October 1926, he lost a 1500 m race along with his world record to Germany's Otto Peltzer. This marked the first time in over five years and 133 races that Nurmi had been defeated at a distance over 1000 m. In 1927, Finnish officials barred him from international competition for refusing to run against Eklöf at the Finland-Sweden international, cancelling the Peltzer rematch scheduled for Vienna. Nurmi ended his season and threatened, until late November, to withdraw from the 1928 Summer Olympics. At the 1928 Olympic trials, Nurmi was left third in the 1500 m by eventual gold and bronze medalists Harri Larva and Eino Purje, and he decided to concentrate on the longer distances. He added steeplechase to his program, although he had only tried the event twice before, the latest being a two-mile steeplechase victory at the 1922 British Championships.|$|E

In Finland, another marathon bearing the name has been held in Nurmi's hometown of Turku since 1992, along with the athletics competition Paavo Nurmi Games that was started in 1957. Finlandia University, an American college with Finnish roots, named their athletic center after Nurmi. A ten-mark bill featuring a portrait of Nurmi was issued by the <b>Bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>Finland</b> in 1987. The other revised bills honored architect Alvar Aalto, composer Jean Sibelius, Enlightenment thinker Anders Chydenius and author Elias Lönnrot, respectively. The Nurmi bill {{was replaced by a}} new 20-mark note featuring Väinö Linna in 1993. In 1997, a historic stadium in Turku was renamed the Paavo Nurmi Stadium. Twenty world records have been set at the stadium, including John Landy's records on the 1500 m and the mile, Nurmi's record on the 3000 m and Zátopek's record on the 10,000 m. In fiction, Nurmi appears in William Goldman's 1974 novel Marathon Man as the idol of the protagonist, who aims to become a greater runner than Nurmi. The opera on Nurmi, Paavo the Great. Great Race. Great Dream., written by Paavo Haavikko and composed by Tuomas Kantelinen, debuted at the Helsinki Olympic Stadium in 2000. In a 2005 episode of The Simpsons, Mr. Burns brags that he once outraced Nurmi in his antique motorcar.|$|E

We concentrate on {{the first stage of}} the monetary policy transmission mechanism; namely, the effect <b>of</b> the <b>Bank's</b> actions on domestic market interest rates and the exchange rate. The questions we analyse include: What is the impact of a change in the <b>Bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>Finland's</b> one month tender rate on interest rates of longer maturities and on the exchange rate? How do Finnish interest rates and the exchange rate react to turmoil in foreign money and bond markets? To what extent can recent developments in Finnish interest rates be attributed to the <b>Bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>Finland's</b> policies? We find that the effect of a monetary policy shock is limited to the short end of the yield curve. Changes in the <b>Bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>Finland's</b> tender rate seem to signal the future path of short rates for a period of 1 - 2 years. On the other hand, Finnish bond rates appear to follow closely circumstances in the international financial market and do not seem to react systematically to changes in the <b>Bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>Finland's</b> tender rate. We find that monetary policy has contributed little to the large swings in Finnish bond rates experienced over the last few years. Most of the variation in bond rates can be attributed to changes in international long rates and changes in the perceived overall credibility of the Finnish economy.

The cheapest bid, 80 million Finnish markka (20 million United States dollar by exchange rates of the time), was made by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries of Japan who outbid the Finnish Wärtsilä shipyard by 36 million markka. On 13 September 1977, SF Line signed a contract with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries for construction of a ferry. However, the funding of the project was subject to approval by the <b>Bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>Finland</b> and as at the time the employment level in Finland's shipyards was low, the <b>Bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>Finland</b> decided not to grant its approval to the project's funding with hopes of forcing the company to order a ship from a Finnish shipyard.

40|$|We {{study the}} effect of the zero bound {{constraint}} of interest rates on international transmission of eco-nomic policy and supply shocks. After some preliminary analysis with a simple theoretical model, we ap-ply a rich two-country simulation model to the problem. The model framework consists <b>of</b> EDGE, <b>Bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>Finland’s</b> dynamic equilibrium model for the euro area, linked to a similar model calibrated to resem-ble the US economy. The models have new Keynesian properties because of price rigidities and forward-looking pricing, consumption and investment behaviour. We assume freely floating exchange rates. Monetary policies are modelled with Taylor type policy rules, taking into account the zero bound con-straint for interest rates. We find that effects of policy and supply side shocks differ significantly from the ‘normal’ situation if one of the countries is in the ‘liquidity trap’, ie if the interest rate is constrained by the zero bound. Being in the liquidity trap amplifies the domestic effects of fiscal policy, but mitigates its spillover to abroad. Changing the long run inflation target, which does not have international spillovers in the normal case, does have effects abroad if the country where the target is changed is in a temporary li-quidity trap. The effects of supply shocks are also very different in the liquidity trap case compared to the normal case. zero bound; liquidity trap; international spillovers; edge...|$|R
40|$|The <b>Bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>Finland’s</b> Finnish Payment Habits 2010 project {{predicts that}} Finnish payment habits will face {{substantial}} changes. The causes for these changes include: the standardisation {{and integration of}} European payment systems, development of payment services-related legislation and regulation at EU level, changes in payment services-related cost factors and pricing, and new opportunities offered by technological advances. The last few years have seen a surge in new payment instruments and services. Increasing reliance on information and communication technology is characteristic {{to the development of}} these payment instruments, the vast majority of which have however failed to entice consumers. To increase our understanding of changes in payment patterns, this report analyses consumer needs, tastes and payment habits as new payment systems are adopted. Research data was collected in September 2005 using a mail-survey covering the central payment methods and addressed to 2, 000 randomly-sampled Finnish consumers. According to our findings, security and trustworthiness are the most important characteristics of any new payment instrument. Other essential characteristics are the ability to produce good transaction-related information, compatibility with shopping and payment habits, accessibility, ease of use, time and cost savings, as well as time and place independence. New payment instruments – electronic billing and paying for shopping by mobile phone – are not likely to supersede conventional payment methods by 2010 when judged by the aforementioned characteristics: Trust and cost factors do not separate consumers well-disposed towards electronic bills and mobile payments from those set against these payment methods. A relatively restricted group of differentiating factors was found. Ease of use is a common differentiating factor for both electronic bills and mobile payments adoption. Additionally, accessibility is a differentiating characteristic in mobile payments adoption. payment habits; payment services to consumers; consumer behaviour; diffusion of innovations; theory of planned behaviour (TPB) ...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE OF THE STUDY The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to address the limited {{understanding}} of the relevance of accounting information to the credit markets. Consequently, using credit default swap (CDS) spreads {{as a proxy for}} investors’ perceived default risk, the ultimate aim of the thesis is to find out whether accounting information is in fact a relevant source of information to the credit markets and if so, to what extent. More specifically, the thesis provides a detailed comparative analysis on the abilities of accounting and market information to explain the variation in credit default swap spreads. Furthermore, the thesis offers evidence on the industry effects of accounting data relevance {{as well as on the}} effects of the global financial crisis of 2008 / 10. DATA The data on European credit default swap spreads for the period reaching from the first quarter of 2005 to the second quarter of 2010 was acquired from Datastream. The necessary accounting and market metrics were obtained from Thomson Worldscope. Data on control variables, namely the risk free interest rate and iTraxx constituent information, was attained from the <b>Bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>Finland’s</b> website and Reuters 3000 Xtra, respectively. The final sample consists of 2 032 firm-quarter observations and it comprises of 155 distinct CDS entities from 10 different sectors and 17 different countries. RESULTS The results indicate that accounting information is a relevant source of information to the credit markets. It was, however, found that market information is, in accordance with a priori expectations, able to provide more relevant information to the holders of credit derivatives than that which is provided by accounting information. In other words, the market-based regression model is able to explain a larger proportion of the variation in CDS spreads than the accounting-based model. It was furthermore found that accounting information is of incremental relevance which implies that accounting and market information are used in tandem by the CDS markets. Supporting evidence of the existence of industry effects was found while it was similarly witnessed that accounting information relevance decreased in the global financial crisis of 2007 - 2010...|$|R
