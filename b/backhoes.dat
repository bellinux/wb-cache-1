25|$|By September 1, 2005, {{the mouth}} of the 17th Street Canal had been sealed with the sheet piling {{preventing}} lake water from getting to the levee breach. Since no additional water can get through the breach it was no longer necessary to seal the breach itself. The next step was to get existing pumps working, and to bring in additional pumps to drain the surrounding city and the canal. Later, the canal was drained so that permanent repairs could be made to the levee. To allow drainage, <b>backhoes</b> mounted on marsh buggies and draglines mounted on barges cut breaches in some other levees. Marsh buggies are tracked vehicles whose wide tracks enable them to operate in soft, marshy terrain.|$|E
25|$|The {{rescue effort}} was {{hampered}} by the weather, terrain, and other problems. Emergency vehicles could not approach due to a fuel pipeline destroyed by the crash and blocking the narrow road. United States Navy Seabees of NMCB133 {{were some of the}} first on the scene as they utilized their earth moving equipment to clear roadways and timber from the crash site approach. The Seabees used <b>backhoes</b> to crack open the still-burning plane to rescue survivors and erected mortuary tents for first responders. There was confusion over the administration of the effort; the crash occurred on land owned by the United States Navy but civil authorities initially claimed authority. The hull had disintegrated, and jet fuel in the wing tanks had sparked a fire which was still burning eight hours after impact.|$|E

5000|$|A <b>backhoe</b> loader is a tractor-like {{vehicle with}} a <b>backhoe</b> at one end, a front loader {{on the other}} and a {{swivelling}} seat to position the operator facing whichever he is using at the time. In North America, this arrangement {{is often referred to}} as simply a <b>backhoe</b> or, when on a chassis originally derived from farm tractors, a tractor loader <b>backhoe</b> (TLB). To differentiate, a <b>backhoe</b> on its own dedicated chassis may then be referred to as an [...] "excavator".|$|R

2500|$|Excavation is {{the most}} {{expensive}} phase of archaeological research, in relative terms. Also, as a destructive process, it carries ethical concerns. As a result, very few sites are excavated in their entirety. Again the percentage of a site excavated depends greatly on the country and [...] "method statement" [...] issued. Sampling is even more important in excavation than in survey.Sometimes large mechanical equipment, such as <b>backhoes</b> (JCBs), is used in excavation, especially to remove the topsoil (overburden), though this method is increasingly used with great caution. Following this rather dramatic step, the exposed area is usually hand-cleaned with trowels or hoes to ensure that all features are apparent.|$|E
2500|$|For the {{building}} of the bunker an effective and simple new procedure was employed. First an underground [...] "extraction tunnel", fitted with a single train track and a gated roof, was built along {{the entire length of the}} planned bunker. Next the foundations for the abutments, which were up to 17 m thick, were dug. The gravel extracted from the foundations was piled up between the foundations to support the arches while they were being built, essentially serving as formwork instead of traditional wooden scaffolding. As each arch was completed, the gravel beneath it was dug out and dumped through the gates of the extraction tunnel into waiting mine carts, which would then be taken away. When the tunnel had been completely uncovered it would be disassembled and <b>backhoes</b> would continue the excavation to a depth of 19.2 meters. Starting from the east, one arch after another was erected in this way. Eight floors were to be erected beneath the arches, but this was only begun with the first arch. By the end of April 1945 only seven of the projected twelve arches were completed. In the last months of the war it was no longer possible to obtain the necessary materials and workers in order to stay on schedule.|$|E
50|$|A backhoe/dipper dredger has a <b>backhoe</b> like on some excavators. A crude but usable <b>backhoe</b> dredger {{can be made}} by {{mounting}} a land-type <b>backhoe</b> excavator on a pontoon. The six largest <b>backhoe</b> dredgers in the world are currently the Vitruvius, the Mimar Sinan, Postnik Jakovlev (Jan De Nul), the Samson (DEME), the Simson and the Goliath (Van Oord). They featured barge-mounted excavators. Small <b>backhoe</b> dredgers can be track-mounted and work from the bank of ditches. A <b>backhoe</b> dredger is equipped with a half-open shell. The shell is filled moving towards the machine. Usually dredged material is loaded in barges. This machine is mainly used in harbors and other shallow water.|$|R

50|$|A <b>backhoe</b> loader, {{also called}} a loader <b>backhoe,</b> digger in layman's terms, or colloquially {{shortened}} to <b>backhoe</b> within the industry, {{is a heavy}} equipment vehicle that consists of a tractor like unit fitted with a loader-style shovel/bucket {{on the front and}} a <b>backhoe</b> on the back. Due to its (relatively) small size and versatility, <b>backhoe</b> loaders are very common in urban engineering and small construction projects (such as building a small house, fixing urban roads, etc.) as well as developing countries. This type of machine is similar to and derived from what is now known as a TLB (Tractor-Loader-Backhoe), which is to say, an agricultural tractor fitted with a front loader and rear <b>backhoe</b> attachment.|$|R

50|$|<b>Backhoe</b> loaders can be {{designed}} and manufactured from the start as such, or can {{be the result of}} a farm tractor equipped with a front end loader (FEL) and rear <b>backhoe.</b> Though similar looking, the purpose-designed <b>backhoe</b> loaders are much stronger, with the farm variation unsuitable for heavy work. The farm variation also requires that the operator switch seats from {{sitting in front of the}} <b>backhoe</b> controls to the tractor seat in order to reposition the equipment while digging, and this often slows down the digging process.|$|R

[...] In 1965, they would follow this with the world's first 360° excavator.|$|R

40|$|The {{excavator}} working {{device is}} a typical mechanical system of electromechanical liquid that is complex. Traditional optimization design methods are difficult to get global optimized results of excavator <b>backhoe</b> device through the serial mode of “mechanism-load-structure”. Thus, the theory of parallel collaborative optimization (CO) is applied. To establish a sophisticated CO model of the <b>backhoe</b> device, a certain excavator is investigated as a sample multidisciplinary CO (MDCO) design. To generate the CO model, an improved optimization algorithm called the particle swarm-genetic algorithm （PS-GA）is proposed. To verify the MDCO design of the excavator <b>backhoe</b> device, a parameterized virtual prototype (VP) of the <b>backhoe</b> device is established in ADAMS. This VP is optimized by applying the MDCO design results to the parameterized VP. The VP of the <b>backhoe</b> device is also optimized by a single discipline when the optimization results from a single discipline are inputted into the parameterized VP. Both optimized VPs are simulated under similar conditions, and results show that in the MDCO design, the arm crowd force of the <b>backhoe</b> device is 8. 1 % stronger than that in the design optimized by a single discipline under constant power and oil pressure conditions. Similarly, breakout force increased by approximately 8. 3 %. The quality (volume) of the entire <b>backhoe</b> device decreased by 9. 5 %; however, the maximum stress of each characteristic partition changed only slightly. Therefore, the MDCO design effectively and practically addresses problems regarding the optimization of the design of complex mechanica...|$|R

5000|$|The name [...] "backhoe" [...] {{refers to}} {{the action of the}} shovel, not its {{location}} on the vehicle : a backhoe digs by drawing earth backwards, rather than lifting it with a forward motion like a man shovelling, a steam shovel or a bulldozer. Confusingly, the buckets on some <b>backhoes</b> may be reconfigured facing forward, making them [...] "hoes". However they are not as effective in that orientation, since the dimensions of the various components are optimized for back-hoeing. Most <b>backhoes</b> are at their strongest curling the bucket, with the dipper arm next most powerful, and boom movements the least powerful.|$|E
5000|$|With {{the advent}} of {{hydraulic}} powered attachments such as a tiltrotator, breaker, a grapple or an auger, the backhoe is frequently used in many applications other than excavation and with the tiltrotator attachment, serves as an effective tool carrier.
