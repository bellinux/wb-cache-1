The tabu search (TS) method {{is combined with}} the genetic algorithm (GA) to identify and provide solutions for assembly line <b>balancing</b> <b>problems.</b> With the proposed HTS method, the TS method can well address the number of tasks assigned for each workstation, while the GA can also assign the sequence of tasks for each workstation according to precedence constraints. In this paper, four single-model assembly line <b>balancing</b> <b>problems</b> from literature are tested against the proposed method. From the simulation results compared with the conventional method, {{it was found that}} the proposed HTS method is capable of producing solutions superior to the conventional method.

50|$|The most {{challenging}} <b>balancing</b> <b>problem</b> arises in application to SLAPP claims {{which do not}} sound (give rise to a claim) in tort. The common law and constitutional law have developed in the United States to create a high substantive burden to tort and tort-like claims which seek redress for public speech, especially public speech which addresses matters of public concern. The common law in many states requires the pleader to state accurately the content of libelous words. Constitutional law has provided substantive protection which bars recovery against a first amendment defense except upon clear and convincing evidence {{that there has been}} deliberate or reckless falsehood. For this reason, ferreting out the bad faith SLAPP claim at an early stage of litigation should be accomplished with relative ease. Extension of the SLAPP penalties to factually complex cases, where the substantive standard of proof at common law is lower presents special challenges.|$|E

40|$|AIM: The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the {{connection}} between <b>balance</b> <b>problems</b> and reading speed in children with and without a familial risk of dyslexia by controlling for the effects of attention, hyperactivity, and cognitive and motor functioning. METHOD: The prevalence of <b>balance</b> <b>problems</b> was studied in 94 children (48 females, 46 males) with a familial risk of dyslexia (at-risk group) and 85 children (38 females, 47 males) without a risk of dyslexia (comparison group). Further, the relationships between <b>balance</b> <b>problems</b> (at age 8 y 6 mo), reading proficiency (at age 9 y), attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder (at age 8 y), and cognitive (at age 8 y 6 mo) and motor functioning (at age 6 y 6 mo) were examined. Inclusion criteria for the at-risk group were that at least one parent had a confirmed reading problem and one or more of the parents' close relatives also had a reading <b>problem.</b> The Good <b>Balance</b> System was used to assess static standing balance, word-list and text reading tasks were used to measure reading proficiency. The Behavioural Assessment System for Children - Parent Rating Scale was used to assess attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder, the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children was used to assess cognitive functioning, and the Movement Assessment Battery for Children was used to measure motor functioning. RESULTS: Balance (F((1, 177)) = 4. 82; p= 0. 029; = 0. 027) and reading (F((1, 176)) = 11. 95; p= 0. 001; = 0. 064) problems were more common in the at-risk group than in the comparison group. Furthermore, attention, hyperactivity, IQ, and motor functioning were not related to <b>balance</b> <b>problems.</b> However, attention (F((1, 154)) = 10. 80; p= 0. 001; = 0. 066) and IQ (F((1, 170)) = 22. 08; p< 0. 001; = 0. 115) were individually connected to reading speed. INTERPRETATION: <b>Balance</b> <b>problems</b> alone could not produce any differences in reading skills. Instead, both <b>balance</b> <b>problems</b> and reduced reading skills were mainly associated separately with a familial risk of dyslexia. This indicates that there may be a shared genetic mechanism between <b>balance</b> and reading <b>problems...</b>|$|R

40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. In this thesis, we study {{the problem of}} {{assembly}} line balancing with stochastic task process times. The research considers both the well-known straight line <b>balancing</b> <b>problem</b> and U-line <b>balancing</b> <b>problem</b> where the line is paced, with no buffer inventories between stations. The objective is to minimize a two component cost function where the cost terms come from cost of manning the line and cost of finishing the incomplete units off the line. Cost is measured by an existing exact method for straight line balancing and a heuristic cost measurement method is developed for U-line balancing. The key idea {{in the core of}} this research is a task's marginal desirability for assignment at a given station. This idea is embedded in a beam search heuristic for solving both the straight line and U-line <b>balancing</b> <b>problem.</b> Extensive computational experiments and simulation experiments are made with well-known problems in the literature under the assumption of normally distributed task processing times. The quality of the solutions found by beam search for the straight-line <b>balancing</b> <b>problem</b> is compared to an existing method in literature. A simulation model of the assembly design is constructed and sample results from the U-line <b>balancing</b> <b>problem</b> are tested against the simulation results.

40|$|The {{traditional}} {{assembly line}} <b>balancing</b> <b>problem</b> considers {{the manufacturing process}} of a product where production is specified {{in terms of a}} sequence of tasks that need to be assigned to workstations. Each task takes a known number of time units to complete. Also, precedence constraints exist among tasks: each task can be assigned to a station only after all its predecessors have been assigned to stations. The U-shaped assembly line <b>balancing</b> <b>problem</b> is a relatively new problem derived from the traditional assembly line <b>balancing</b> <b>problem.</b> In the U-shaped assembly line <b>balancing</b> <b>problem</b> tasks can be assigned to stations either after all its predecessors or all of its successors have been assigned to stations.

We developed six different assignment algorithms as a means for interpreting a chromosome and assigning tasks to workstations. The results show the GA to be an excellent technique for this problem. In the 61 standard test cases from the literature, our GA obtained the same results as previous researchers in 49 cases, superior results in 11 cases, and in only one case did worse. Moreover, the GA proved to be computationally eficient. 1...|$|E

Patients with known spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) meet several of the criteria for psychogenic <b>balance</b> <b>problem</b> and risk being misclassified as having imbalance of psychogenic origin. However, our research shows that patients with SCA may be distinguished from patients with psychogenic <b>balance</b> <b>problems</b> in several ways. We compared test performance on CDP and the observation of specific behaviors {{that are associated with}} psychogenic <b>balance</b> <b>problems</b> in patients with SCA (n[*]=[*] 43) and patients with known psychogenic <b>balance</b> <b>problems</b> (n[*]=[*] 40). Chi-square analysis was used to determine if there were significant differences between the groups for the frequency of each criterion for psychogenic CDP and Observed Behaviors. Level of significance was Bonferroni corrected for multiple comparisons. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive likelihood ratios were calculated for each criterion. Hierarchical cluster analysis was used to examine whether the two patient groups demonstrated similar groupings of criteria. Comparison of the results of these analyses identified two criteria that were significantly more frequent in the psychogenic group than in the SCA group: regular periodicity of sway and circular sway. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive likelihood ratios identified two additional criteria, inconsistent motor responses and large lateral sway that also seem to suggest a psychogenic component to a personâs imbalance.
