5|$|Final Resolution was {{announced}} in mid-October 2007 to <b>be</b> <b>taking</b> <b>place</b> on January 6, 2008. The location for the gathering was not specified. In late-November 2007 the TNA Impact! Zone in Orlando, Florida was revealed as the location for the spectacle. TNA created a section regarding their event on their website to help promote the event. TNA released a poster featuring Kurt Angle, Christian Cage, A.J. Styles, and Tomko sometime prior to help promote the event. TNA moved Final Resolution to December {{later in the year}} and held a second event for unknown reasons.|$|E
5|$|In March 1971, Chotiner {{resigned}} from his White House job {{and returned to}} the private practice of law. He represented former Teamsters president Jimmy Hoffa, who had been informally promised early parole from his jury tampering sentence. Chotiner wrote to Haldeman in November 1971, noting that no action on Hoffa's release seemed to <b>be</b> <b>taking</b> <b>place,</b> and President Nixon granted Hoffa clemency later that month. When Chotiner's role became public in 1973, he stated that he was proud of his actions on behalf of Hoffa. Chotiner also lobbied the White House on behalf of milk producers, who were seeking increased price supports and who were major contributors to the Republican Party.|$|E
5|$|The TNA Women's Knockout Championship was {{defended by}} Gail Kim against Awesome Kong in a No Disqualification match at Final Resolution. Kim first defended the title against Kong at Turning Point, {{which ended in}} a {{disqualification}} after Kong attacked the referee. On the December 6, 2007 episode of Impact!, Kong attacked Kim after Kim lost a bout to ODB, {{which led to a}} brawl that was broken up by security. The two had another brawl on the December 20, 2007 episode of Impact!. On the December 27, 2007 episode of Impact!, the match was announced to <b>be</b> <b>taking</b> <b>place</b> at Final Resolution.|$|E

40|$|This article {{analyses}} whether industrial upgrading <b>is</b> <b>taking</b> <b>place</b> in {{firms in}} the Fiji garment industry. The research findings shows that 'industrial upgrading' <b>is</b> <b>taking</b> <b>place</b> only in Fijian owned garment firms and not in foreign Australian, New Zealand and Chinese owned garment firms. The Fiji owned garment firms are the most dynamic and a trajectory of industrial upgrading <b>is</b> <b>taking</b> <b>place</b> as they <b>are</b> shifting from half-package production networks to full-package networks...|$|R
50|$|Spatial {{distance}} is the physical distance {{at which the}} events <b>are</b> <b>taking</b> <b>place</b> from each other. If the event, such as a graduation, <b>is</b> <b>taking</b> <b>place</b> down the street it is being processed on a low level. If the graduation <b>is</b> <b>taking</b> <b>place</b> in another state, then it is processed on a high level. When an event is located far from a person, it is viewed more abstractly. Likewise, when events are at a near location they are viewed more concretely.|$|R
5|$|Whereas the {{dynamics}} of Jovian magnetosphere mainly depend on internal sources of energy, the solar wind probably has a role as well, particularly {{as a source of}} high-energy protons. The structure of the outer magnetosphere shows some features of a solar wind-driven magnetosphere, including a significant dawn–dusk asymmetry. In particular, magnetic field lines in the dusk sector are bent in the opposite direction to those in the dawn sector. In addition, the dawn magnetosphere contains open field lines connecting to the magnetotail, whereas in the dusk magnetosphere, the field lines are closed. All these observations indicate that a solar wind driven reconnection process, known on Earth as the Dungey cycle, may also <b>be</b> <b>taking</b> <b>place</b> in the Jovian magnetosphere.|$|E

Eleven teams automatically qualified for the event, with four further places being played for in regional qualifiers and one place played for in playoffs made up of the regional runners-up.|$|E
25|$|Without {{permission}} from the British authorities, the French attempted to illegally transport Indian workers to their sugar producing colony, the Reunion Island, from as early as 1826. By 1830, over 3,000 labourers had been transported. After this trade was discovered, the French successfully negotiated with the British in 1860 for permission to transport over 6,000 workers annually, on condition that the trade would be suspended if abuses were discovered to <b>be</b> <b>taking</b> <b>place.</b>|$|E

25|$|During the Northeast Blackout of 2003, O'Brien and {{the staff}} taped a short 10-minute {{introduction}} explaining that the episode they had planned would not <b>be</b> <b>taking</b> <b>place</b> due to the blackout. Studio 6A was powered by a generator and lit by battery-powered floodlights. A standby show was aired in-progress after the intro. One of the scheduled guests that night, The Dandy Warhols, commandeered the studio's green room, where they stayed until they performed on the show the next night.|$|E
25|$|In August 2017, the BBC {{announced}} that three new episodes would be produced {{to mark the}} twentieth anniversary of the show's debut on BBC Radio. Filming for the specials took place from late September through mid October 2017, with guest star David Morrissey on set with the cast. On 24 October 2017, the first official image confirmed the return of Pauline Campbell-Jones, alongside Ross and Mickey. On the same day, it was {{announced that}} a special screening of one of the episodes would <b>be</b> <b>taking</b> <b>place</b> at the British Film Institute on 12 December 2017.|$|E

25|$|So I think {{individual}} {{women will}} react differently; some will not cook that day, some will engage {{in dialog with}} their husband, some will be out at the rallies and demonstrations that will <b>be</b> <b>taking</b> <b>place</b> all over the country. Others will be writing things {{that will help them}} to define where they want to go. Some will be pressuring their Senators and their Congressmen to pass legislations that affect women.

25|$|The first combat {{operation}} the 133rd (Parachute) Field Ambulance {{was involved}} in was Operation Slapstick, a landing {{at the port of}} Taranto during the Allied invasion of Italy in September 1943. Slapstick was in part a deception operation, to divert German forces away from the main Allied landings at Salerno (Operation Avalanche), which would <b>be</b> <b>taking</b> <b>place</b> on the same day and also an attempt to seize intact the ports of Taranto and Brindisi. The main advantage of Tranato was its large port. Positioned on {{the eastern side of the}} country, together with the expected capture of Naples in the west by the Americans, it would give the Allies two supply points, on opposite sides of the country.|$|E
25|$|The {{sequence}} of steps {{in which the}} reorganization of chemical bonds may <b>be</b> <b>taking</b> <b>place</b> {{in the course of}} a chemical reaction is called its mechanism. A chemical reaction can be envisioned to take place in a number of steps, each of which may have a different speed. Many reaction intermediates with variable stability can thus be envisaged during the course of a reaction. Reaction mechanisms are proposed to explain the kinetics and the relative product mix of a reaction. Many physical chemists specialize in exploring and proposing the mechanisms of various chemical reactions. Several empirical rules, like the Woodward–Hoffmann rules often come in handy while proposing a mechanism for a chemical reaction.|$|E

25|$|In May 2009, {{publisher}} Activision {{was rumored}} {{to be looking for}} licensing regarding Vietnam War-era music which led to speculation that Call of Duty 7 would be set in Vietnam. In May 2009, Treyarch employee David Kim revealed on his LinkedIn profile that he would work as a senior animator on Call of Duty 7. In November 2009, only a few days before Modern Warfare 2s release, Activision officially announced a new Call of Duty title for 2010 through their third quarter financial call. In February 2010, a casting call for Call of Duty 7 led to speculation that the game would <b>be</b> <b>taking</b> <b>place</b> during the Cold War era with some battles taking place in South Vietnam. On April 30, 2010, Black Ops was officially announced.|$|E
25|$|On {{his return}} to the US, Spitzer {{calculated}} that something was wrong with the ZETA results. He noticed that the apparent temperature, 5 million K, would not have time to develop during the short firing times. ZETA did not discharge enough energy into the plasma to heat it to those temperatures so quickly. If the temperature was increasing at the relatively slow rate his calculations suggested, fusion would not <b>be</b> <b>taking</b> <b>place</b> early in the reaction, and could not be adding energy that might make up the difference. Spitzer suspected the temperature reading was not accurate. Since it was the temperature reading that suggested the neutrons were from fusion, if the temperature was lower, it implied the neutrons were non-fusion in origin.|$|E
25|$|North American beavers {{were also}} {{released}} in Finland in 1937, {{before it was}} realized that they formed a separate species. (Eurasian beavers had been extirpated from the region, so the release {{was intended as a}} reintroduction project.) By 1999, it was estimated that 90% of beavers in Finland were the American species. The species is not considered invasive, as in Europe it has a similar keystone effect to European beavers, which have not recolonized the area. The beaver population has been controlled by issuing hunting licenses. A report in 2010 concluded that while the current population was not problematic, as the species has larger litters than European beavers and builds somewhat larger dams, it could become a problem if its range continues expanding into Russia, but this does not seem to <b>be</b> <b>taking</b> <b>place.</b>|$|E
