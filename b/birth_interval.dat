As this peculiarity generally is not known, for the calculation of <b>birth</b> <b>intervals</b> we resort to the formulation of hypotheses on mean age of fertility at last child birth. In the recent fertility trend such hypotheses seem unsatisfactory as they lead, for some Tuscan birth cohorts of women, to evidently wrong estimation of <b>birth</b> <b>intervals.</b> Therefore we suggest a different procedure that permits, using ratios calculated by the data of the fertility table for which we want to measure <b>birth</b> <b>intervals,</b> to partition women with j children in two groups: those who have stopped their fertility and those who have carried on their fertility.

40|$|A {{growing body}} of {{research}} has examined whether <b>birth</b> <b>intervals</b> influence perinatal outcomes and child health, as well as long-term educational and socioeconomic outcomes; to date, however, very little research has examined whether birth spacing influences long-term health.

In models where we do not adjust carefully for family background we find that short and long <b>birth</b> <b>intervals</b> are clearly associated with height, physical fitness, being overweight or obese, and mortality. However, after carefully adjusting for family background using a within-family sibling comparison design, we find that birth spacing is generally not associated with long-term health, though we find that men born after very long <b>birth</b> <b>intervals</b> have a higher probability of being overweight or obese in early adulthood. Overall we conclude that <b>birth</b> <b>intervals</b> have little independent effect on long-term health outcome...|$|R

50|$|The {{gestation}} period is 18-22 months, {{and the female}} gives birth to one calf, only occasionally twins.

5000|$|Gibbons were {{previously}} reported to practice monogamous sexual relationships. [...] They {{are known to}} form pair bonds, as well documented {{in the majority of}} gibbon species. [...] Upon the discovery of single male, multi-female living groups, the question arose to determine if all females were mating. The observation that offspring of similar ages lived within a multi-female group confirmed that polygyny did in fact occur. The current hypothesis remains that both monogamous and polygamous relationships exist. [...] There may be various selection pressures for polygyny within previously monogamous groups. Parents tend to be hostile towards maturing offspring, with males leaving the group more quickly than females do. [...] Yet, upon tolerance by the mother, adult female offspring may remain in the group, as the group continues to forage and feed as family members. The mutual tolerance of females is likely to be caused by “weak territoriality of females.” Further selection occurs due to the <b>birth</b> <b>interval</b> for a single female averaging 2-2.5 years. Male fitness would benefit from inseminating other females during a <b>birth</b> <b>interval.</b> [...] This hypothesis is supported by the large scrotal size allowing for increased sperm production. [...] Other observations have been made that males will share child carrying to place less of a burden on the female, delaying her interbirth time. [...] The conflicting observations support the hypothesis that black-crested gibbons demonstrate both monogamous and polygamous sexual relationships.|$|E
50|$|Evolutionary theory {{dictates}} that all organisms invest heavily in reproduction {{in order to}} replicate their genes. According to parental investment, human females will invest heavily in their young {{because the number of}} mating opportunities available to them and how many offspring they are able to produce in a given amount of time is fixed by the biology of their sex. This inter <b>birth</b> <b>interval</b> (IBI) is a limiting factor in how many children a woman can have because of the extended developmental period that human children experience. Extended childhood, like the extended post-reproductive lifespan for females, is unique to humans. Because of this correlation, human grandmothers are well-poised to provide supplemental parental care to their offspring's children. Since their grandchildren still carry a portion of their genes, it is still in the grandmother’s genetic interest to ensure those children survive to reproduction.|$|E

40|$|Background. Studies {{examining}} the associations between short birth spacing and child mortality have often {{concentrated on the}} strength of the associations whilst the public health importance of short spacing in specific communities has received less attention. This study re-examines the association between short <b>birth</b> <b>intervals</b> and child mortality in rural Senegal and discusses the potential direct effects of efforts to delay births on child mortality in this community. Methods. The study uses longitudinal data in a cohort of 4852 children born between 1983 and 1989. The associations between birth spacing and child mortality are examined using logistic and Cox proportional hazards regression models. Results. The probability of dying before age five is 224 per 1000 livebirths. The median <b>interval</b> between <b>births</b> is 33 months and only 12 % of the <b>birth</b> <b>intervals</b> are less than 24 months in length. The odds of dying in the neonatal and post-neonatal period is 2. 27 and 2. 12 times higher respectively for children born after preceding <b>birth</b> <b>intervals</b> of one year or less compared to children born after longer intervals. Children born within two years of a subsequent birth are at 4. 09 times higher risk of dying in the second year of life than children whose mother gave birth more than 2 years after the index birth. Conclusions. In this community where prolonged breastfeeding causes women to space their <b>births</b> at long <b>intervals,</b> short <b>birth</b> <b>intervals</b> are a consequence rather than a cause of child mortality and the potential direct effects of birth spacing efforts on child mortality are limited. To reduce the high levels of child mortality, efforts will have to be made to ensure effective preventive and curative health services, and to maintain the traditional pattern of breastfeeding...|$|R

50|$|Females reach sexual {{maturity}} at 6-7 {{years of age}} while males reach {{sexual maturity}} between 10-12 years of age. Courtship is often a difficult affair. The male stays beyond {{the point where the}} female acts aggressively and will give out a call when approaching her. The male chases and or blocks the way of the female while squealing or wailing loudly if the female tries to leave his territory. When ready to mate the female curls her tail and gets into a stiff stance during the half-hour copulation. Breeding pairs stay together between 5-20 days before they part their separate ways. The gestation period of a white rhino is 16 months. A single calf is born and usually weighs between 40 and 65 kg. Calves are unsteady for their first 2 to 3 days of life. When threatened the baby will run in front of the mother, who is very protective of her calf and will fight for it vigorously. Weaning starts at 2 months, but the calf may continue suckling for over 12 months. The <b>birth</b> <b>interval</b> for the white rhino is between 2 and 3 years. Before giving birth the mother will chase off her current calf. White rhinos can live to be up to 40-50 years old.|$|E
