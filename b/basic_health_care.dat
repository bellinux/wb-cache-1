5|$|For {{the next}} two days, the Australians {{continued}} to provide protection to the US engineers before being replaced by an American infantry battalion. 1 RAR subsequently flew out on 26 February, returning to Bien Hoa airbase. Meanwhile, following the attack at Tan Binh the Viet Cong attempted to avoid further contact, choosing instead to harass the American work parties with occasional mortar and sniper fire. These tactics proved ineffective, and although the Americans lost a further three killed and 29 wounded, the road was completed by 2 March. The Americans then launched an extensive civic action program {{in an attempt to}} consolidate their gains, repairing damaged houses, distributing food and providing <b>basic</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> to the local population. Despite such efforts though, American commanders were pessimistic about the possibility of achieving any long term gains in Binh Duong Province unless the South Vietnamese Army was able to provide lasting protection for the local population. On 7 March, just five days after the completion of Operation Rolling Stone, the US 1st Brigade was redeployed with US 173rd Airborne Brigade and 1 RAR on Operation Silver City, sweeping the south-west sector of War Zone D.|$|E

25|$|One of the {{identifying}} {{characteristics of}} slums {{is the lack}} of or inadequate public infrastructure. From safe drinking water to electricity, from <b>basic</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> to police services, from affordable public transport to fire/ambulance services, from sanitation sewer to paved roads, new slums usually lack all of these. Established, old slums sometimes garner official support and get some of these infrastructure such as paved roads and unreliable electricity or water supply.|$|E

25|$|For the {{provision}} of primary care, Spain is currently divided geographically in <b>basic</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> areas (áreas básicas de salud), each one containing a primary health care team (Equipo de atención primaria). Each team is multidisciplinary and typically includes GPs, community pediatricians, nurses, physiotherapists and social workers, together with ancillary staff. In urban areas all the services are concentrated in a single large building (Centro de salud) while in rural areas the main center is supported by smaller branches (consultorios), typically single-handled.|$|E
25|$|Premier Wen went on {{to focus}} heavily on the Three Rural Issues of agriculture, the countryside, and farmers. This {{particular}} topic was echoed throughout the speech. He pledged government finances towards building rural infrastructure and funding towards {{the development of new}} technologies. Wen pledged a change in policy towards agricultural insurance, which is almost nonexistent in the current framework. On the topic of rural health care, Wen promised a twofold increase in funding, and vowed that over 80% of the Chinese rural population will receive guaranteed <b>basic</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> in the year ahead.|$|E
25|$|This {{increase}} will be {{most dramatic}} on the least-urbanized continents, Asia and Africa. Surveys and projections indicate that all urban growth over the next 25 years will be in developing countries. One billion people, almost one-seventh of the world's population, now live in shanty towns. In many poor countries overpopulated slums exhibit high rates of disease due to unsanitary conditions, malnutrition, and lack of <b>basic</b> <b>health</b> <b>care.</b> By 2030, over 2 billion {{people in the world}} will be living in slums. Over 90% of the urban population of Ethiopia, Malawi and Uganda, three of the world's most rural countries, already live in slums.|$|E

25|$|Pakistan {{has taken}} certain {{initiatives}} {{in the health}} sector to redress gender imbalances. The SAP was launched in 1992–1993 to accelerate improvement in the social indicators. Closing the gender gap is the foremost objective of the SAP. The other major initiative is the Prime Minister's program of lady health workers (LHWs). Under this community-based program, 26,584 LHWs in rural areas and 11,967 LHWs in urban areas have been recruited to provide <b>basic</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> including family planning to women at the grassroots level. Other initiatives include the village-based family planning workers and extended immunisation programs, nutritional and child survival, cancer treatment, and increased involvement of media in health education.|$|E
25|$|Widening income disparities, {{periodic}} economic shocks, and rampant urbanization have disrupted {{disease control}} efforts {{and contributed to}} widespread reemergence of cholera, malaria, TB, and dengue, especially in the poorer Central American and Caribbean countries and in the Amazon basin of South America. According to the AFMIC typology, Latin America's health care capacity is substantially more advanced than that of Sub-Saharan Africa and somewhat better than mainland Asia's, with 70–90% of populations having access to <b>basic</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> in Chile, Costa Rica, and Cuba on {{the upper end of}} the scale. Less than 50 percent have such access in Haiti, most of Central America, and the Amazon basin countries, including the rural populations in Brazil.|$|E

2500|$|Health {{literacy}} {{is a common}} and serious safety concern.

2500|$|Royal Decree 1277/2003, of 10 October, {{establishes}} the general bases for authorization of health centers, services and establishments.

The macro level of the issue is the proportion of total gross national product allotted to <b>health</b> <b>care,</b> the micro level is which individual patient will receive specific forms of <b>health</b> <b>care,</b> e.g., [...] "whether Mrs. White should receive this available liver for transplantation." [...] In between are the <b>basic</b> or essential <b>health</b> <b>care</b> services that should be provided to each citizen.
