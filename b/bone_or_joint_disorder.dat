30|$|Although no {{primary focus}} of {{infection}} could be located in our patient, the mode of involvement is most likely hematogenous, as suggested by its multicentric nature.

30|$|The most {{important}} factor regarding the treatment of stress fractures is early diagnosis.

Sensitivity may also present with extraintestinal symptoms, including headache, [...] "brain fog", tingling and/or numbness in hands and feet, fatigue, {{as well as}} muscular disturbances and <b>bone</b> <b>or</b> <b>joint</b> pain; also neuropsychiatric manifestations ("gluten-sensitive idiopathic neuropathies") have been reported on.|$|R
40|$|Osteomyelitis is an {{infection}} in bone most frequently occurring in children. The current incidence is 1 in 5000. Septic arthritis is {{an infection}} of a synovial joint which may occur in {{all age groups}} in children but has a specific infantile form affecting the infant from birth to {{the first year of}} life. The majority of infections of <b>bone</b> <b>or</b> <b>joint</b> are caused by spread of bacteriae through the bloodstream or occasionally by entry of organisms through an open wound, by puncture or by extension of infection from adjacent tissue. The most common causative organism is Staphylococcus aureus but many other organisms may be responsible for a <b>bone</b> <b>or</b> <b>joint</b> infection. The treatment of both osteomyelitis and septic arthritis is based on antibiotic therapy in combination with sur-gical drainage if pus or infected tissue is present. Early diagnosis followed by adequate treatment gives good outcome. Inappropriate or delayed treatment may result in chronic osteomyelitis <b>or</b> irreversible <b>joint</b> destruction...|$|R
50|$|Valgus is a {{term for}} outward {{angulation}} of the distal segment of a <b>bone</b> <b>or</b> <b>joint.</b> The opposite condition is called Varus, which is a medial deviation of the distal bone.The terms varus and valgus always refer to the direction that the distal segment of the joint points.

50|$|In skin {{infections and}} in {{secondary}} infection sites topical mupirocin is used successfully. For bacteremia and endocarditis, vancomycin or daptomycin is considered. For children with MRSA infected <b>bone</b> <b>or</b> <b>joints,</b> treatment is individualized and long-term. Neonates can develop Neonatal pustulosis {{as a result}} of topical infection with MRSA. Clindamycin is not approved for the treatment of MRSA infection it is still used in children for soft tissue infections.|$|R

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{a series of}} four cases of {{children between the ages}} 5 and 14  years with <b>bone</b> <b>or</b> <b>joint</b> infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis diagnosed between June 2006 and March 2008 in the Blackburn area of England. All of the cases were of South Asian descent. The diagnosis was confirmed by the presence of M. tuberculosis on the culture of <b>bone,</b> synovium <b>or</b> <b>joint</b> fluid, <b>or</b> by the presence of the typical histology of tuberculosis (TB). The sites of tuberculous disease were the hip joint, the sacro-iliac joint and the talus. A recent paper by Sandher et al.
