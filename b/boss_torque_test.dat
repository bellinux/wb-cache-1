Manual <b>torque</b> bond <b>test</b> is known {{to be one of the}} tests to determine mechanical properties of bond between adjacent pavement layers. However, the test has several drawbacks that may affect the accuracy of results. This paper is focused on the development a mechanically controlled automatic <b>torque</b> bond <b>test</b> in order to eradicate the drawbacks associated with the manual <b>torque</b> bond <b>test.</b> A trial test and calibration of the newlydeveloped apparatus was performed to ensure the accuracy of results. The nominal loading rate of the manual <b>torque</b> bond <b>test</b> performed at 600 Nm/min was found to be lower than the target loading rate, leading to a lower measured shear strength compared to that of the automatic <b>torque</b> <b>test.</b> It was also found that the appearance of lateral shear would not significantly affect the shear strength...|$|R

To avoid the environment pollution, we should develop environmental protection grinding coolants. So {{it is important to}} research the performance evaluation for grinding coolants. In this paper, three different test methods for grinding performance evaluation of grinding coolants are used to investigate the influence of three coolants on grinding process. The three test methods are four balls <b>test,</b> tapping <b>torque</b> <b>test</b> and real grinding test. The test results showed that the mechanism of four balls test is simple, and the test results have good repeatability, but there is a large divagation with real grinding test results.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{performed}} to assess the bone healing supporting characteristics of porous calcium phosphate (Ca-P) cement when implanted in a rabbit segmental defect model {{as well as to}} determine the reliability of <b>torque</b> <b>testing</b> as a method to verify bone healing. The middiaphyseal radius was chosen as the area to create bilaterally increasing defect sizes (5, 10, and 15 [*]mm), which were either filled with porous Ca-P cement or left open as a control. After 12 weeks of implantation, <b>torque</b> <b>test</b> measurements as well as histological and radiographic evaluation were performed. In two of the open 15 [*]mm control defects, bone bridging was visible at the radiographic and histological evaluation. Bone was observed to be present in all porous Ca-P cement implants (5, 10, and 15 [*]mm defects) after 12 weeks. No significant differences in torque measurements were observed between the 5 and 10 [*]mm filled and open control defects using a t-test. In addition, the mechanical strength of all operated specimens was similar compared with nonoperated bone samples. The torsion data for the 15 [*]mm open defect appeared to be lower compared with the filled 15 [*]mm defect, but no significant difference could be proven. Within the limitation of the study design, porous Ca-P cement implants demonstrated osteoconductive properties and confirmed to be a suitable scaffold material in a weight-bearing situation. Further, the used <b>torque</b> <b>testing</b> method was found to be unreliable for testing the mechanical properties of the healed bone defect...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the osseointegration of implants which were surface-treated with various diameters of TiO 2 nanotubes (30 [*]nm, 70 [*]nm, and 100 [*]nm) in rabbit. Resorbable blast media (RBM) surfaced implants (Osstem, Busan, Korea) 3. 5 [*]mm in diameter and 8. 5 [*]mm in length were designated as the control group and the implants surface-treated with various diameters of nanotubes (30 [*]nm, 70 [*]nm, and 100 [*]nm) with the same shapes were designated as the experimental groups. The implants were maintained unloaded for 4 and 12 weeks. After this period, the animals were sacrificed and micro-CT analysis, histomorphometric analysis (bone to implant contact (BIC), bone volume (BV)), and removal <b>torque</b> <b>test</b> were performed. Micro-CT analysis, histomorphometric analysis, and removal <b>torque</b> <b>test</b> results all showed the similar pattern, showing that 70 [*]nm experimental group had the highest value at 4 weeks while 30 [*]nm experimental group had the highest value at 12 weeks.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to assess the effects of {{surgical}} technique and implant surface roughness on implant fixation. A total of 48 screw implants with machined or etched surface topographies were placed into the femoral condyles of goats. The implant sites were prepared by a conventional technique, by undersized preparation, or by the osteotome technique. Bone tissue responses were evaluated after 12 weeks of healing by removal <b>torque</b> <b>testing</b> and histologic analysis using scanning electron microscope. The cumulative removal torque value of the etched implants placed with the undersized technique (98 +/- 29 Ncm) was higher (50 +/- 35 Ncm) to a level of statistical significance than machined surface implants placed by the osteotome technique. Scanning electron microscope evaluation indicated that all implants showed interfacial bone contact. The <b>torque</b> <b>test</b> resulted in fracture at the bone-implant interface for all experimental conditions. Installation of etched implants using an undersized preparation of the implant bed resulted in superior bonding strength with the surrounding bone at 12 weeks after surgery. Evidently, the undersized preparation technique improved the early fixation of oral implants in this study...|$|R
50|$|Another {{method is}} a reverse <b>torque</b> <b>test,</b> {{in which the}} implant carrier is unscrewed. If it fails to unscrew under the reverse torque {{pressure}}, the implant is stable. If the implant rotates under the pressure it is deemed a failure and removed. This method comes {{at the risk of}} fracturing bone that is mid-way in the process of osseointegration. It is also unreliable in determining the osseointegration potential of a bone region, as tests have yielded that a rotating implant can go on to be successfully integrated.|$|R

40|$|International {{industry}} {{standards set}} out requirements to mount ski bindings, test equipment functionality, provide guidelines {{on how to}} maintain the ski-binding-boot interface, and calculate correct release values. The standards call {{for the use of}} a <b>torque</b> <b>testing</b> device to assess functionality of the ski-binding with release values based on parameters of age, weight, height, boot-sole length, and skier type. To determine whether these standards were being applied in New Zealand a cross-sectional study was completed with a national survey of ski technicians and structured interviews with senior ski industry personnel. In setting up ski bindings, only 10 % of ski technicians used a torque-testing device, and substantial proportions did not take into account appropriate skier characteristics or check the boot–binding interface. Interviews of senior personnel indicated that there was good intent about quality of rental service; however, there were inconsistencies between operating procedures and international standards. The interviews also highlighted a need for better standardized questioning techniques for ski technicians to accurately determine skier type, and increased education for both ski technicians and skiers on correct setup to prevent injury related to non-release or inadvertent release. In conclusion, Ski-Binding-Boot (SBB) system inspection, routine <b>torque</b> <b>testing</b> to ensure safe functional ski-bindings, and consistent application of the international standards for correct setup of ski-binding-boot systems continues to be elusive in New Zealand.

40|$|This in vivo study {{evaluated}} the fixation of {{two types of}} titanium implants {{with the use of}} an injectable calcium-phosphate (CaP) cement. The cement was either used to create a cement mantle (Type A implant) or as an additive to press-fit placed titanium plasma sprayed implants (Type B implant). The implants were placed in trabecular bone of the medial femoral condyle of goats and left in place for 2 and 10 weeks. Mechanical evaluation of the implant fixation was done by <b>torque</b> <b>testing.</b> This showed that for the Type A implants the calcium-phosphate cement's performance was significantly inferior (P < 0. 05) to that of polymethylmethacrylate cement fixation. For the two-week Type B implants a significant increase (P < 0. 05) in failure load was found for calcium-phosphate cemented implants compared with just press-fitted Type B implants. Histological evaluation revealed that for Type A implants, failure during <b>torque</b> <b>testing</b> occurred at the implant-cement interface. In contrast, for Type B implants, failure occurred in the bone-implant interface for press-fit-placed devices and in the cement layer for CaP-cemented devices. Further, the CaP cement was found to be overgrown with new formed bone already after 2 weeks of implantation. The cement showed resorption due to regular bone remodeling. On the basis of these observations, it was concluded that the use of injectable CaP cement might facilitate earlier loading of press-fit inserted titanium implants.

40|$|The {{influence}} of Ca-P magnetron sputter coated implants on the mechanical anchorage was evaluated in a goat model. Therefore, uncoated and coated screw designed commercially pure titanium TiO 2 -blasted implants were {{inserted into the}} trabecular bone of the femoral condyles of 12 goats. The thicknesses of the coatings were 0. 1 mu m (CaP- 0. 1), 1. 0 mu m (CaP- 1) and 4. 0 mu m (CaP- 4). In addition, uncoated TiO 2 -blasted implants (Ti) were used as control. Evaluation of the interface strength and appearance, using <b>torque</b> <b>test</b> and scanning electron microscopy, was done at implantation periods of 6 and 12 weeks. Although, especially at 6 weeks of implantation, the Ca-P coated implants showed higher failure torque values than the TiO 2 blasted implants, the observed differences for type of implant and evaluation period were not significant (P> 0. 1). SEM evaluation showed that all implants with failure values of more than 100 N conducted bone growth into their screw threads. In addition, we observed that the fracture plane for the CaP- 3 implants was situated at the coating-implant interface or inside the coating. For the Cap- 1 and CaP- 0. 1 the fracture line could not be determined definitely. For the Ti implants, the fracture <b>torque</b> <b>testing</b> resulted in failure at the bone-implant interface. Therefore, we conclude that all implants resulted in a good bonding strength with the surrounding bone.
