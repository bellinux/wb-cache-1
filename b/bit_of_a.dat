5|$|During the summer, with United only losing three matches, {{and either}} winning or drawing their other league fixtures, the club ascended {{in the standings}} and eventually, into a {{position}} that offered a berth into the wildcard round of the playoffs.

5|$|Intelligent, passionate, and {{the moral}} center of the family, Lisa Simpson, at eight years old, is the second child of Homer and Marge, younger sister of Bart, and older sister of Maggie. Lisa's high intellect and liberal {{political}} stance creates a barrier between her and other children her age, therefore she is a <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> loner and social outcast. Lisa is a vegetarian, a strong environmentalist, a feminist, and a Buddhist. Lisa enjoys many hobbies, including reading and playing the baritone saxophone. Lisa's character develops {{many times over the}} course of the show: she becomes a vegetarian in season 7 and converts to Buddhism in season 13. A strong liberal, Lisa advocates for a variety of political causes and stands with the Tibetan independence movement. She has appeared in other media relating to The Simpsons– including video games, The Simpsons Movie, The Simpsons Ride, commercials and comic books– and inspired a line of merchandise.|$|E

5|$|Sophie {{was one of}} Mozart 's pups seen on Meerkat Manor. She had two {{brothers}} and one sister named Sparkle. Only one of her brothers was given a name and he was called Spud. They were born some time after Tosca, Mozart's sister, gave birth to three pups. Their uncle Yossarian decided to move their pups who {{were only a few}} days old. He brought each up above ground and started to move them to a new burrow. The babysitters followed him and carried each pup. The Whiskers returned and Yossarian dropped the pup he was carrying, who was Sophie's sister. Her sister got left behind and died later that night. The other pups were moved to the new burrow. One day, while being babysat by Yossarian, Mitch, Sophie's other uncle, viciously attacked her without warning. Yossarian failed to stop the assault and simply waited until Mitch was proud of the beating. Afterwards, little Sophie {{was in a state of}} shock, but thankfully Tosca gave Sophie a comforting cuddle. Sophie didn't re-appear in the series until much later, when she was older. She was seen babysitting a litter, but was finding them a <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> handful. That was the last time Sophie was mentioned in Season 1. In this season and up until season 3, she was played by Tina Sparkle since the real Sophie was the one Youssarian unintentionally killed.|$|E

5000|$|The {{above-mentioned}} {{technique is}} inadequate when the multiplicand {{is the most}} negative number that can be represented (e.g. if the multiplicand has 4 bits then this value is &minus;8). One possible correction to this problem is to add one more bit to the left <b>of</b> <b>A,</b> S and P. This then follows the implementation described above, with modifications in determining the <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> <b>A</b> and S; e.g., the value of m, originally assigned to the first x <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> <b>A,</b> will be assigned to the first x+1 <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> <b>A.</b> Below, the improved technique is demonstrated by multiplying &minus;8 by 2 using 4 bits for the multiplicand and the multiplier: ...|$|R
