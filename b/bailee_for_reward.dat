He is therefore entitled to divest himself of the certificate regardless of a duty of care, so long as he does no malicious or intentional harm to another.|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to measure the effects of task difficulty and reward opportunity on motivation. The participants, 20 undergraduate students, were {{randomly assigned to one of}} four experimental conditions: reward opportunity-hard proofreading task, reward opportunity-easy proofreading task, no reward opportunity-hard proofreading task, or no reward opportunity-easy proofreading task. It was hypothesized that the participants offered an opportunity <b>for</b> <b>reward</b> would perform better than those not offered an opportunity <b>for</b> <b>reward</b> by indicating and correcting more spelling and grammatical errors. Also, it was hypothesized that participants offered an opportunity <b>for</b> <b>reward</b> would return the completed proofreading task quicker than participants not offered an opportunity <b>for</b> <b>reward.</b> Two, 2 x 2 ANOVAs were carried out with the results showing no main effects of task difficulty or opportunity <b>for</b> <b>reward</b> on number of errors corrected or time of return (in days), indicating no change in motivation. As the original hypothesis was not supported, issues with the study and areas for further research were discussed...|$|R

40|$|M. Comm. Statistics {{on private}} road freight {{transportation}} services (not <b>for</b> <b>reward)</b> (defined as: “a business’s own vehicles {{that are used}} to transport its own products to its own customers”) are very limited in South Africa. Statistics South Africa’s (SSA) research focuses on road freight carriers <b>for</b> <b>reward</b> and excludes the data on private (not <b>for</b> <b>reward)</b> carriers. The CSIR in 2004 published a report entitled Second Annual State of Logistics Survey for South Africa. The focus of this study was on land freight transport, i. e. road and rail. Maritime, air and pipeline volumes were not included in this study’s scope. Therefore, the number of studies investigating the private (not <b>for</b> <b>reward)</b> road freight market and even the total freight market in South Africa is limited to the above-mentioned two sources and the Rand Afrikaans University’s (RAU) 1991 -study (published in 1993), entitled Freight Transport Survey.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{evolution}} and the co-evolution of both characteristics of reciprocity- {{the willingness to}} reward friendly behavior and the willingness to punish hostile behavior. Firstly, both preferences <b>for</b> <b>rewarding</b> and preferences <b>for</b> punishing can survive in evolution provided individuals interact within separate groups. This holds even with randomly formed groups and even when individual preferences are unobservable. Secondly, preferences <b>for</b> <b>rewarding</b> survive only in coexistence with self-interested preferences, but preferences for punishing tend either to vanish or to dominate the population entirely. Finally, the evolution of preferences <b>for</b> <b>rewarding</b> {{and the evolution of}} preferences for punishing influence each other decisively. The existence of rewarders enhances the evolutionary success of punishers, but punishers crowd out rewarders...|$|R

40|$|Of the {{putative}} psychopathological endophenotypes in {{major depressive disorder}} (MDD), the anhedonic subtype is particularly well supported. Anhedonia is generally assumed to reflect aberrant motivation and reward responsivity. However, research has been limited {{by a lack of}} objective measures of reward motivation. We present the Effort-Expenditure <b>for</b> <b>Rewards</b> Task (EEfRT or "effort"), a novel behavioral paradigm as a means of exploring effort-based decision-making in humans. Using the EEfRT, we test the hypothesis that effort-based decision-making is related to trait anhedonia. 61 undergraduate students participated in the experiment. Subjects completed self-report measures of mood and trait anhedonia, and completed the EEfRT. Across multiple analyses, we found a significant inverse relationship between anhedonia and willingness to expend effort <b>for</b> <b>rewards.</b> These findings suggest that anhedonia is specifically associated with decreased motivation <b>for</b> <b>rewards,</b> and provide initial validation for the EEfRT as a laboratory-based behavioral measure of reward motivation and effort-based decision-making in humans...|$|R
