40|$|As per Reserve Bank of India, Financial {{inclusion}} can {{be called}} as facilitating financial and banking services to the low income group people especially in rural areas in a very low transaction cost. But the presence of Commercial Banks will not be possible in the unreached segments of all the districts in our country. Therefore Reserve bank of India has recommended to adopt <b>Lead</b> <b>Bank</b> Scheme in all the districts of our country to meet the credit needs of the rural people and improve the credit structure in lending priority sectors. This study has investigated the performance of various districts of Tamil Nadu {{as well as its}} corresponding <b>lead</b> <b>banks</b> towards implementing financial inclusion under <b>lead</b> <b>bank</b> scheme. The study has adopted secondary data by considering the district name, <b>Lead</b> <b>Banks,</b> Achievement of Number of Bank Accounts and Amount credited for the priority sectors like agriculture, small scale industries, etc. The study has also ranked and highlighted the district name that has achieved the highest percentage of bank accounts in its <b>Lead</b> <b>Bank...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{shows that}} the {{structure}} of the syndicate affects the spread in addition to the borrower’s characteristics. Because the <b>lead</b> <b>bank</b> is the principal syndicate member collecting information about the borrower, there is an information asymmetry within the lending syndicate that leads to moral hazard and/or adverse selection problems, thereby, impacting the loan spread. Consequently, the share retained by the <b>lead</b> <b>bank</b> can help to mitigate these problems. However, the observed relationship between syndicate structure and the loan spread is influenced, not only by information asymmetry, but also by diversification considerations. I use an instrumental variables approach to separate these two effects. By combining loan information with novel data on default correlations, I construct a direct measure of the risk-based loan spread premium required by the <b>lead</b> <b>bank.</b> This variable exogenously affects the diversification of the <b>lead</b> <b>bank</b> and has no direct effect on information asymmetry within a syndicate. The main results are that informational frictions between the <b>lead</b> and participant <b>banks</b> have an important economic impact on the spread, and an increase {{in the size of the}} <b>lead</b> <b>bank's</b> share causes a reduction in the loan spread. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first paper that addresses the endogenous relationship between loan spread and syndicate structure...|$|R
40|$|We {{document}} {{that the structure}} of syndicates affects loan renegotiations. <b>Lead</b> <b>banks</b> with large retained shares have positive effects on renegotiations. In contrast, more diverse syndicates deter renegotiations, but only for credit lines. The former result can be explained with coordination theories. The puzzling effect of syndicate diversity in term loan renegotiations derives from the growth of collateralized loan obligations (CLOs) in the syndicated loan market and the coordination between these vehicles and <b>lead</b> <b>banks.</b> CLOs that {{have a relationship with}} the <b>lead</b> <b>bank</b> of the renegotiated loan are strong supporters of amount-increase renegotiations, arguably because this gives them access to attractive investments. Related CLOs fund not only their portion of the loan increase, but also the portion {{that was supposed to be}} funded by the <b>lead</b> <b>bank.</b> Our findings highlight the previously unrecognized role of the growing presence of non-bank lenders in corporate lending...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{estimates}} the cost arising from information asymmetry between the <b>lead</b> <b>bank</b> {{and members of}} the lending syndicate. In a lending syndicate, the <b>lead</b> <b>bank</b> retains {{only a fraction of the}} loan but acts as the intermediary between the borrower and the syndicate participants. Theory predicts that asymmetric information will cause participants to demand a higher interest rate and that a large loan ownership by the <b>lead</b> <b>bank</b> should reduce this effect. In equilibrium, however, the asymmetric information premium demanded by participants is offset by the diversification premium demanded by the lead. Using shifts in the idiosyncratic credit risk of the <b>lead</b> <b>bank's</b> loan portfolio as an instrument, I measure the asymmetric information effect of the lead's share on the loan spread and find that it accounts for approximately 4 % of the total cost of credit.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the certification roles of <b>lead</b> <b>bank</b> retention in US syndicated loans {{with respect to}} interest rates, then explore how lead banks' reputation and previous relationships with the borrower alter such certification effects. Our findings support the certification hypothesis. Loan spreads are found to decrease with a higher retention ratio, after controlling for the endogeneity of loan price and retention. The magnitude of certification effect is reduced when the <b>lead</b> <b>bank</b> is a more reputable lender and when there are prior bank-borrower relationships. <b>Lead</b> <b>bank</b> reputation and prior lending relationships can therefore substitute for the need to certify.

40|$|Loan {{syndication}} {{involves a}} repeated game between <b>lead</b> <b>banks</b> and syndicate members. <b>Lead</b> <b>banks</b> {{do not use}} their private information to exploit syndicate participants but rather focus on accurately certifying loan quality. Using borrowers' financial ratios (shifts in Altman's Z scores) after origination to proxy for bank private information, we find that <b>lead</b> <b>banks</b> syndicate larger proportions of loans that subsequently do not experience lower Z scores. Performance pricing covenants under which borrowers commence to pay higher spreads if ratios (or credit ratings) deteriorate constitute a positive signal reducing agency costs and are associated with higher proportions of syndication.

40|$|There {{have been}} {{widespread}} claims that credit derivatives {{such as the}} credit default swap (CDS) have lowered the cost of firms 2 ̆ 019 debt financing by creating for investors new hedging opportunities and information. However, these instruments also give banks an opaque means to sever links to their borrowers, thus reducing lender incentives to screen and monitor. In this paper, we evaluate {{the effect that the}} onset of CDS trading has on the spreads that underlying firms pay at issue when they seek funding in the corporate bond and syndicated loan markets. Employing matched-sample methods, we find no evidence that the onset of CDS trading affects the cost of debt financing for the average borrower. However, we do find economically significant adverse effects to risky and informationally-opaque firms. It appears that the onset of CDS trading reduces the effectiveness of the <b>lead</b> <b>bank</b> 2 ̆ 019 s retained share in resolving any asymmetric information problems that exist between a <b>lead</b> <b>bank</b> and non-lead participants in a loan syndicate. On the plus side, we do find that CDS trading has a small positive effect on spreads at issue for transparent and safe firms, in which the <b>lead</b> <b>bank</b> 2 ̆ 019 s share is much less important. Moreover, we document that the benefit of CDS trading on spreads increases once the market becomes sufficiently liquid.

40|$|Loan syndication, where a {{group of}} banks makes a loan jointly to a single borrower, offers several benefits. Syndication allows banks to diversify, {{expanding}} their lending to broader geographic areas and industries. Second, syndication allows banks that are constrained by their capital-asset ratios to participate in loans to larger borrowers.; Despite these benefits, loan syndication could pose additional risks for the banking system, if the originating or <b>lead</b> <b>banks</b> withhold information about the borrower from participating banks, misleading them into making loans that are riskier than they thought.

40|$|This {{paper is}} the first to study the impact of a borrower's {{reorganization}} filing on its <b>lead</b> lending <b>bank</b> and second lending bank. This study analyzes 96 reorganization filings in Taiwan during the period 1995 - 2006.

Additionally, the second lending banks experience stock price reactions in the opposite manner to those of the <b>lead</b> lending <b>banks,</b> indicating dominant positive effects.

In this setting, a bank run has a permanent effect on the capital stock and {{on the level of}} output. In addition, the possibility of a bank run changes the portfolio choice of banks and thereby affects the long-run growth rate. We consider two different equilibrium selection rules. In the first, a run is triggered by sunspots and occurs with a fixed probability. A higher probability of a run in this case <b>leads</b> <b>banks</b> to hold a more liquid portfolio, which decreases total investment and thereby reduces capital formation. Hence the economy grows slower, even when a run does not occur. Under the second selection rule, the probability of a run is influenced by the bank's portfolio choice. This <b>leads</b> <b>banks</b> to place more resources in long-term investment, and the economy both grows faster and experiences fewer runs...|$|R
