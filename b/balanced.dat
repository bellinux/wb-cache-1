5000|$|In some situations, {{terms on}} either side of the global <b>balance</b> {{equations}} cancel. The global <b>balance</b> equations can then be partitioned to give a set of local <b>balance</b> equations (also known as partial <b>balance</b> equations, independent <b>balance</b> equations or individual <b>balance</b> equations). These <b>balance</b> equations were first considered by Peter Whittle. The resulting equations are somewhere between detailed <b>balance</b> and global <b>balance</b> equations. Any solution [...] to the local <b>balance</b> equations is always a solution to the global <b>balance</b> equations (we can recover the global <b>balance</b> equations by summing the relevant local <b>balance</b> equations), but the converse is not always true. Often, constructing local <b>balance</b> equations is equivalent to removing the outer summations in the global <b>balance</b> equations for certain terms.|$|R

The model of social <b>balance</b> theory provides us an interesting tool to see how a social group evolves to the possible <b>balance</b> state. We introduce the <b>balance</b> index {{that can be used}} to measure social <b>balance</b> in macro structure level (global <b>balance</b> index) or in micro structure (local <b>balance</b> index) to see how the local <b>balance</b> index influences the global <b>balance</b> structure.
