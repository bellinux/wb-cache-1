The artwork and title track led to Christian groups in the United States branding the band as Satanists, encouraging people to destroy copies of the release. The band's manager, Rod Smallwood, later commented that Christians initially burnt the records, but later decided to destroy them with hammers through fear of <b>breathing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> melting vinyl's fumes. The protests were not restricted to the US, with Christian organisations preventing Iron Maiden from performing in Chile in 1992.|$|E

2500|$|The term spirit means [...] "animating or vital {{principle}} in man and animals". It {{is derived from}} the Old French espirit which comes from the Latin word spiritus (soul, courage, vigor, breath) and is related to spirare (to <b>breathe).</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> Vulgate the Latin word spiritus is used to translate the Greek pneuma and Hebrew ruah.|$|R

25|$|Over {{the early}} 1890s, Demetrescu's {{condition}} worsened, and he sought treatment for tuberculosis in the Alpine climate regions of German Empire and in Austria-Hungary. In 1894, {{he was in}} Munich and later at the Rheyer Villa in Bad Reichenhall. He subsequently traveled to Vienna, where he visited the Cathedral of Saint Stephen. The following year, he was present in the Bukovinan town of Solca, where he attempted to cure his illness by living in the close proximity of firs and <b>breathing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> scented air. Tradem's efforts were fruitless, and he died one year later, {{at the age of}} 29, after a particularly severe episode of hemoptysis.|$|E
25|$|During the Middle Ages, {{scientific}} discoveries were {{few and far}} between in much of Europe. However, the scientific culture flourished {{in other parts of the}} world. By AD 700, the tracheotomy was well documented in Indian and Arabian literature, although it was rarely practiced on humans. In 1000, Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi (936-1013), an Arab who lived in Al-Andalus, published the 30-volume Kitab al-Tasrif, the first illustrated work on surgery. He never performed a tracheotomy, but he did treat a slave girl who had cut her own throat in a suicide attempt. Al-Zahrawi (known to Europeans as Albucasis) sewed up the wound and the girl recovered, thereby proving that an incision in the larynx could heal. Circa 1020, Ibn Sīnā (980–1037) described the use of tracheal intubation in The Canon of Medicine to facilitate <b>breathing.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> 12th century medical textbook Al-Taisir, Ibn Zuhr (1091–1161) of Al-Andalus (also known as Avenzoar) provided an anatomically correct description of the tracheotomy operation.|$|E

25|$|Normally, {{the face}} is in the water during front crawl with eyes looking at {{the lower part of}} the wall in front of the pool, with the {{waterline}} between the brow line and the hairline. Breaths are taken through the mouth by turning the head to the side of a recovering arm at the beginning of the recovery, and <b>breathing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> triangle between the upper arm, lower arm, and the waterline. The swimmer's forward movement will cause a bow wave with a trough in the water surface near the ears. After turning the head, a breath can be taken in this trough without the need to move the mouth above the average water surface. A thin film of water running down the head can be blown away just before the intake. The head is rotated back at the end of the recovery and points down and forward again when the recovered hand enters the water. The swimmer breathes out through mouth and nose until the next breath. Breathing out through the nose may help to prevent water from entering the nose. Swimmers with allergies exacerbated by time in the pool should not expect exhaling through the nose to completely prevent intranasal irritation.|$|E
25|$|As {{a nearly}} {{universal}} standard practice in modern recreational diving, the typical single-hose regulator has a spare demand valve fitted for emergency {{use by the}} diver's buddy, typically {{referred to as the}} octopus because of the extra hose, or secondary demand valve. The octopus was invented by Dave Woodward at UNEXSO around 1965-6 to support the free dive attempts of Jacques Mayol. Woodward believed that having the safety divers carry two second stages would be a safer and more practical approach than buddy <b>breathing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> event of an emergency. The medium pressure hose on the octopus is usually longer than the medium pressure hose on the primary demand valve that the diver uses, and the demand valve and/or hose may be colored yellow to aid in locating in an emergency. The secondary regulator should be clipped to the diver's harness in a position where it can be easily seen and reached by both the diver and the potential sharer of air. The longer hose is used for convenience when sharing air, so that the divers are not forced to stay in an awkward position relative to each other. Technical divers frequently extend this feature and use a 5-foot or 7-foot hose, which allows divers to swim in single file while sharing air, which may be necessary in restricted spaces inside wrecks or caves.|$|E

2500|$|Preventing Valley fever is {{challenging}} {{because it is}} difficult to avoid <b>breathing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fungus should it be present, however, the public health effect of the disease is essential to understand in areas where the fungus is endemic. [...] Enhancing surveillance of Coccidiodomycosis is key to preparedness in the medical field in addition to improving diagnostics for early infections. [...] Currently there are no completely effective preventive measures available for people who live or travel through Valley Fever -endemic areas. Recommended preventive measures include avoiding airborne dust or dirt, but this does not guarantee protection against infection. People in certain occupations may be advised to wear face masks. The use of air filtration indoors is also helpful, in addition to keeping skin injuries clean and covered to avoid skin infection.|$|E
2500|$|There {{is only a}} short {{window for}} <b>breathing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> butterfly. If this window is missed, {{swimming}} becomes very difficult. Optimally, a butterfly swimmer synchronizes the taking of breaths with the undulation {{of the body to}} simplify the breathing process; doing this well requires some attention to butterfly stroke technique. The breathing process begins during the underwater [...] "press" [...] portion of the stroke. As the hands and forearms move underneath the chest, the body will naturally rise toward the surface of the water. With minimum effort, the swimmer can lift the head to fully break the surface. The swimmer breathes in through the mouth. The head goes back in the water after the arms come out of the water as they are swinging forward over the surface of the water. If the head stays out too long, the recovery is hindered. The swimmer breathes out through mouth and nose till the next breath.|$|E
2500|$|Once neurulation is {{complete}} and {{has given rise}} to the nervous system, fetal memory becomes responsible for a variety of tasks. One of its main functions at this point is to control <b>breathing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fetus. [...] Also noted, was its ability to control eye movement and coordination during all nine months of development. [...] There is evidence that these are practiced in the womb and carried out similarly after birth. Learning language as an infant also requires fetal memory. It is now known that the mother's voice is clearly heard from inside the womb and that the fetus can differentiate speech sounds, particularly the phonemes (a single segment of sound) in speech. This is evident in the baby when born, showing many signs of early language comprehension. It has also been shown that infants prefer their mother’s native language after being exposed to it in the womb. Evidence also exists that the infant, when born, prefers its mother's smell from having memorized her scent as a fetus. Memory is critical for the recognition process that takes place between the mother and infant through breastfeeding. Breast milk contains contents recognizable by the infant that they were exposed to through amniotic fluid (fluid that encompasses the fetus and is responsible for its nutrition in the womb) in the fetal stage. Since the baby is so dependent upon the mother, maternal nutrition also plays a large role in the infant developing healthy brain functioning; including memory function, which the infant cannot live without. Thus, fetal memory is critical to the survival and healthy development of the infant before and after birth. Many of these functions are measured through methods such as classical conditioning, habituation and exposure learning, being the most popular.|$|E
