5|$|Fantasy Black Channel was {{recorded}} between 2006 and 2008 in Sam Eastgate's <b>bedroom</b> <b>in</b> Castle Donington {{and at the}} following studios in London.|$|E
5|$|On {{the first}} floor is the upper hall and the captain's chamber, used in the 16th century as a living and working space by the castle's commander, and {{converted}} into a dining room and a <b>bedroom</b> <b>in</b> the 19th century. On the opposite side to the captain's private chamber are two other bedrooms, possibly originally {{for the use of}} the castle's lieutenant.|$|E
5|$|Following {{a fire at}} the Ajuda Palace in 1794, the Prince Regent John VI and {{his wife}} Carlotta Joaquina began to use Queluz themselves. The Robillon wing was {{enlarged}} and given an upper floor {{for the use of}} the princess and her nine children. These additions were destroyed in the fire of 1934. To escape the forces of Napoleon I in 1807, the Portuguese royal family abandoned Queluz and fled to Brazil. The French occupational forces took control of the palace, and their commander, General Junot, made several alterations to the building. On the royal family's return from exile in 1821, the King preferred to live at Mafra, leaving his wife, the Spanish Queen Carlotta Joaquina, to occupy Queluz with her aunt Princess Maria Francisca Benedita. The King visited Queluz infrequently. It was on one of these rare visits that João VI died in the circular domed King's <b>Bedroom</b> <b>in</b> 1826.|$|E

5|$|M.I.A. {{made her}} North American live debut in February 2005 in Toronto where concertgoers already knew {{many of her}} songs. In March 2005, M.I.A.'s debut album Arular was {{released}} worldwide to critical acclaim after several months delay. The album title is the nom de guerre that M.I.A.'s father took {{when he joined the}} Tamil independence movement, and many of the songs acknowledge her and her father's experiences in Jaffna. While making Arular in her <b>bedroom</b> <b>in</b> west London, she built tracks off her demos, using beats she programmed on the Roland MC-505. The album experiments with bold, jarring and ambient sounds, and its lyrics address the Iraq War and daily life in London as well as M.I.A.'s past.|$|E
5|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} in frontman Sam Eastgate's <b>bedroom</b> <b>in</b> Castle Donington, England, and at several locations in London. It went through a fractured creative process that lasted {{for more than two}} years. It was eventually produced by Eastgate and DJ Erol Alkan between 2007 and 2008. Fantasy Black Channel does not contain a unifying musical or lyrical theme; rather, it is a collage of all the ideas, genres, and studio effects that fascinated the band members and Alkan, especially during live recording sessions. The record was very well received by critics. It was often treated {{as one of the best}} British albums of 2008 because of its eclecticism and spirit of invention. Late of the Pier did not record any further albums following the death of drummer Ross Dawson in 2015.|$|E
5|$|The {{first phase}} of the works to the Southwark {{building}} started in 1986 and were completed in 1989, during which time the museum was closed to the public. The work included the conversion of what was previously the hospital's courtyard into a centrepiece Large Exhibits Gallery. This gallery featured a strengthened ground floor (to support the weight of very heavy exhibits), a first floor mezzanine and second storey viewing balcony. Into this space were placed tanks, artillery pieces, vehicles, ordnance and aircraft from the First World War to the Falklands War. For some years the museum was marketed as 'The new Imperial War Museum'. This atrium, with its concentration of military hardware, has been described as 'the biggest boys' <b>bedroom</b> <b>in</b> London'. This first phase cost £16.7 million (of which £12 million was provided by the government) and the museum was reopened by The Queen on 29 June 1989.|$|E

5|$|Other {{spirits are}} also said {{to remain at}} The Octagon as well. Dolley Madison's spirit has been seen near the {{fireplace}} in the main ballroom as well as heading through a closed door to the garden, and her ghost's presence is accompanied {{by the smell of}} lilacs, her favorite flower. A slave girl in the house was allegedly thrown from the third floor landing to the first floor below and killed by a British soldier during the War of 1812, and eyewitnesses have reported hearing her scream. The specter of a British soldier in War of 1812 dress was seen by caretaker James Cypress in the 1950s, and museum superintendent Alric H. Clay claimed that in the 1960s spirits would often turn on the lights and open The Octagon's doors late at night. A gambler shot to death in the house's third-floor <b>bedroom</b> <b>in</b> the late 19th century has sometimes been seen still in the bed he died in, and ghostly footmen have been seen at the front door waiting to receive guests. He was said to have rung a bell shortly before his death and that the ring of the bell often heard in the house is from him. Various witnesses have also reported hearing assorted moans, screams, and footsteps.|$|E
5|$|William Moreton III used what {{is today}} {{known as the}} Exhibition Room as a <b>bedroom</b> <b>in</b> the mid-17th century; it is entered through a doorway from the {{adjoining}} Withdrawing Room. Following William's death in 1654 his children Ann, Jane and Philip divided the house into three separate living areas. Ann, whose accommodation was in the Prayer Room above, then used the Exhibition Room as a kitchen. The adjoining Chapel, begun in 1508, is accessible by a doorway from the courtyard. The Chapel contains Renaissance-style tempera painting, thought to date from the late 16th century. Subjects include passages from the Bible. The chancel was probably a later addition dating from the mid-16th century. It is separated from the nave by an oak screen and projects eastwards from the main plan of the house, with a much higher ceiling. The stained glass in the east wall of the chancel is a 20th-century addition installed by Charles Abraham, the last private owner of Little Moreton Hall, as a parting gift on his transfer of ownership to the National Trust.|$|E

25|$|In United States usage, {{the word}} {{dormitory}} means a building primarily providing sleeping and residential quarters for {{large numbers of}} people, often boarding school, college or university students. In the US {{it is common for}} residents (typically two) to share a <b>bedroom.</b> <b>In</b> the US these buildings are often single sex, or sexes are accommodated on separate floors.|$|E
