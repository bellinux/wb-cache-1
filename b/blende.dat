5|$|The Jesuits in the Chiquitania had a {{secondary}} objective, {{which was to}} secure a more direct route to Asunción than the road then being used via Tucumán and Tarija to link the Chiquitania with the Jesuit missions in Paraguay. The missionaries in Chiquitos founded their settlements increasingly further east, towards the Paraguay River, while those south of Asunción {{moved closer to the}} Paraguay River by establishing their missions increasingly farther north, thereby avoiding the impassable Chaco region. Although Ñuflo de Chávez had attempted a route through the Chaco on an expedition as early as 1564, subsequent Jesuit explorations from Chiquitos (e.g. in 1690, 1702, 1703, and 1705) were unsuccessful. The Jesuits were stopped by the hostile Payaguá and Guaycuru tribes, and by the impenetrable swamps of Jarayes. In 1715, de Arce, the co-founder of the first mission in San Xavier, set out from Asunción on the Paraguay River with the Flemish priest Fr. Bartolomé <b>Blende.</b> Payaguá warriors killed <b>Blende</b> during the journey, but de Arce struggled on to reach San Rafael de Velasco in the Chiquitania. On the return trip to Asunción he too was killed in Paraguay. Not until 1767, when the missions had encroached sufficiently on the hostile region and just before the Jesuits were expelled from the New World, did Fr. José Sánchez Labrador manage to travel from Belén in Paraguay to Santo Corazón, the easternmost Chiquitos mission.|$|E

5|$|Zinc is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Zn and atomic number 30. It {{is the first}} element in group 12 of the periodic table. In some respects zinc is chemically similar to magnesium: both elements exhibit only one normal oxidation state (+2), and the Zn2+ and Mg2+ ions are of similar size. Zinc is the 24th most abundant element in Earth's crust and has five stable isotopes. The most common zinc ore is sphalerite (zinc <b>blende),</b> a zinc sulfide mineral. The largest workable lodes are in Australia, Asia, and the United States. Zinc is refined by froth flotation of the ore, roasting, and final extraction using electricity (electrowinning).|$|E
5|$|The {{hexagonal}} structure {{has a point}} group 6mm (Hermann-Mauguin notation) or C6v (Schoenflies notation), and the space group is P63mc or C6v4. The lattice constants are a = 3.25 Å and c = 5.2 Å; their ratio c/a ~ 1.60 {{is close to the}} ideal value for hexagonal cell c/a = 1.633. As in most group II-VI materials, the bonding in ZnO is largely ionic (Zn2+–O2−) with the corresponding radii of 0.074nm for Zn2+ and 0.140nm for O2−. This property accounts for the preferential formation of wurtzite rather than zinc <b>blende</b> structure, as well as the strong piezoelectricity of ZnO. Because of the polar Zn-O bonds, zinc and oxygen planes are electrically charged. To maintain electrical neutrality, those planes reconstruct at atomic level in most relative materials, but not in ZnO – its surfaces are atomically flat, stable and exhibit no reconstruction. This anomaly of ZnO is not fully explained. However, studies using wurtzoid structures explained the origin of surface flatness and the absence of reconstruction at ZnO wurtzite surfaces in addition to the origin of charges on ZnO planes.|$|E

B 37, 8215 (1988) ] {{to include the}} effects of the bulk inversion asymmetry (BIA) present in zinc <b>blendes.</b> This is accomplished without adding to the number of basis states or extending the range of interaction. We have also investigated a variant form of the EBOM proposed in the original formulation that offers improved zone-center behavior, but may also generate spurious solutions in heterostructure calculations due to poor description of bulk zone-boundary band structure. We offer suggestions for avoiding this problem so that this variant form of EBOM may be used safely. In general, we find that the addition of BIA effects in EBOM results in improved descriptions of zone-center band structure, but also in a loss of accuracy far from the Brillouin-zone center. We illustrate the use of the BIA extension with band-structure calculations for bulk GaSb. We show that the spin splitting predicted by the extended EBOM method for an AlSb/GaSb superlattice is in good agreement with k·p calculations that include BIA effects...|$|R
25|$|Indium is {{the fourth}} element of the boron group but was {{discovered}} before the third, gallium, and after the fifth, thallium.

Reich heated the ore in a coil of platinum metal and observed the lines that appeared in a spectroscope. Instead of the green thallium lines that he expected, he saw a new line of deep indigo-blue.

25|$|The Greenside {{fault is}} a normal fault with an average dip of 70° to the east. A fault plane is not a flat surface and the actual dip of the Greenside fault varies between 58° east and vertical; in one place it was 83° west. As the rock {{fractured}} and the two sides moved against each other, cavities were created, partly filled with broken rock (fault breccia and fault gouge). Hydrothermal circulation of sea water at temperatures of 110130°C, probably during the Carboniferous Period, led to mineralisation of the fault cavities.

40|$|To better {{understand}} the process of miniaturization and the behavior of molecular structures under this effect we appeal to the calculations based in Quantum Mechanics (QM) with the purpose to corroborate theoretical and experimental data as electronic structure as well as electric properties. Another method sufficiently known consists simulate solute-solvent effect through the probabilistic Monte Carlo (MC) method. Of ownership of these computational tools we develop simulations QM/MC that translate the behavior of organic composites Methyl Red (MR) and 1, 4 -bis (5 -phenyl- 2 -oxazolyl) benzene (POPOP), when suffer structural changes, modification in the optic answers, etc., due miniaturization processes, environment variations, external actions. The Methyl Red composite {{is known as a}} sensible dye of pH variation and meets in the basic and acid (isoeletrônico, zwitteriônico) forms is classified as azo-composite for the presence of (– N = N –) bonding in its structure. The POPOP is a luminescent dye of intense fluorescence in the blue region of the UV-Visible spectrum; we stand out that to investigate the functional and mannering principles of this structure we consider two conformational structures protonated derivatives of POPOP: C 1 (N+) and C 2 (N+). Initially all organic composites structures of MR and POPOP had been optimized through of the quantum methods: semiempirical PM 3 (Parametric Method 3) and ab initio HF (Hartree-Fock) and DFT (Density Functional Theory), getting the geometric parameters and the conformations of lowest energy of each system, {{for the study of the}} electronic structure. Sequentially, two distinct stages of simulation had been used for the study of composites: 1 st) The MR and POPOP structures had been optimized through the method PM 3 + External Electric Field (the EEC), getting the geometric parameters and charge parameters. We use this method with the purpose to simulate the electronic transport properties of organic composites as the electric reply characterized by the charge transport (e) curve in function of the variation of the tension (V) in the structures. By means of the electric reply [(e) × V] we characterize this function to use them in nanostructured devices, as photodiodes, photodetector, solar cells, etc. The 2 nd stage consists of simulate organic composites through the Monte Carlo method, to investigate its behaviors in liquid. The systems distinct consist of the addition of VM (basic, acid: isoelectronic and zwitterionic) and POPOP [C 1 (N+) and C 2 (N+) ] in 1000 water molecules to analyze the solute-solvent interactions for development of interchange systems optoelectronic systems as sensory. In MC simulation had been carried 1 × 1010 steps MC for both thermalization and equilibrium stages in NVT ensemble. Generate a set of 105 configurations, from these we select a set reduced of 103 descorrelantion configurations of which we obtain the convergence average of the electronic transitions π→π*. The convergence average of the electronic transitions π→π* for MR: basic s of 434. 33 ± 1, 0 [436, 34 ± 2, 0 nm], isoelectronic 485, 80 nm ± 2, 0 nm [480, 66 nm ± 3, 0 nm], and zwitterionic [502. 13 nm ± 3. 0 nm]; for POPOP C 1 [361, 25 nm ± 2, 0 nm], C 1 (NP+P) [485. 0 ± 26. 0 nm], C 2 [355, 39 nm ± 3, 0 nm] and C 2 (NP+P) [472. 0 ± 24. 0 nm]. The averages of the electronic transitions π→π* had been obtained through semiempirical ZINDO/S-CIS (Zerner Intermediate Neglect of Orbital Diffential Spectroscopic - Configurations Interaction, Single excitation) method that better translates the spectroscopic parameters of the organic molecules in the UV-visible region. Experimentally we develop two distinct types of systems through of the techniques: Sol-Gel that consists in the incorporation of composites in host matrix of APP (Aluminum Polyphosphate), and <b>Blendes</b> that consist in the manufacture of volume devices within active monolayer. The MR and POPOP composites had been diluted in hybrid solution (10 % etanol + 90 % water), aliquots of these solutions had been incorporated in the synthesis of APP/Gel. The samples obtain for the Sol-Gel process had been submitted to the variation pH and characterized by spectroscopy of absorption in the UV-Visible region, whose bands of maximum absorption are of [431 nm, 513 nm, 511 nm] for MR and [358 nm, 511 nm and 472 nm] for POPOP and values of [355 nm, 361 nm] for POPOP in solution, that corroborate the theoretical results from the averages of the electronic transitions π→π*. The monolayer devices of MR and POPOP had been manufactured by overlapped of thin films in vitreous substrate/FTO (1 st electrode) /PEDOT/P 3 HT/ active monolayer -Aluminum (2 nd electrode) and characterized electrically for charge density (J) in function of applied voltage (V), under dark current and under 550 nm monochromatic light. The MR devices present curve (J×V) characteristic of a rectifier junction p-n of higher electric current signal under reverse polarization for dark current, being this signal intensified under light 550 nm; under forward bias the device presents the same behavior how much to the current signal, this is intensified when measured on monochromatic light (550 nm) in comparison with dark current, however under reverse polarization and forward bias the device presents curve characteristic (J×V) analogous of the conventional photodetector and diode tunnel. For POPOP intensification of the electric chain signal is observed under forward bias and reverses when the devices are under monochromatic light in comparison with measures made under dark current, in way that the characteristic curve (J×V) has similar behavior of the conventional photodiodes. The theoretical-experimental results of the electric (J×V) properties of composites had presented similar behaviors in the voltage range [- 2. 0 V – 2. 97 V] for MR and [- 2. 86 V - 2. 86 V] for POPOP. We development a complete study with polymers of low bandgap (gap 1 eV) based in monomers bridges composition for carbon forming polymeric chains had been investigated by the methods AM 1 (Austin Model 1), PM 3 and DFT [B 3 LYP/ 6 - 31 G] to corroborated the results of the oligomers of CDM (4 -dicyano methyllene- 4 H-cyclopente [2. 1 - 3 : 4 -b'] dithiophene) and BDT (1, 3 -benzodithiole- 4 H-cyclopenta [2, 1 -b: 3, 4 -b'] dithiophene), derived from the ditiophene. The results show that the growth of the polymeric chain formed by monomers of CDM and BDT provokes the reduction bandgap of the oligomers, analogous behavior to the polymers based on (3 -alkylthiophenes) whose electronic transition π→π* energy is of 1. 67 eV, the maximum absorption of the CDM and BDT are of 1. 28 eV and 1, 73 eV, respectively The theoretical methods used in this study to describe satisfactorily this behavior, whose maximum absorption is of approximately 1, 28 eV for CDM and 1, 74 eV for BDT, these results had been obtain from the polymeric chains formed by 5 monomers units, demonstrating that the geometric conformations of the polymeric chains simulated are equiprobability, proving the trustworthiness of the methods used in our investigation. In general lines, the results presents to demonstrate that the organic composites investigated are good candidates for employ in nanostructured organic devices applied in the molecular electronics and new technology of materials.

Outro método bastante conhecido e utilizado consiste em simular o efeito soluto-solvente através do método probabilístico Monte Carlo (MC). De posse de ferramentas computacionais voltadas para estas metodologias, desenvolvemos simulações MQ/MC que traduzem o comportamento dos compostos orgânicos Vermelho de Metíla (VM) e 1, 4 -bis (5 -phenyl- 2 -oxazolyl) benzene (POPOP), quando sofrem mudanças estruturais bem como modificações em suas propriedades ópticas; devido aos processos de miniaturização, variações de ambiente, ações externas, etc. O composto Vermelho de Metila é conhecido como um corante sensível a variação de pH e encontra-se nas formas básico e ácido (isoeletrônico, zwitteriônico) é classificado como um azocomposto pela presença de uma ligação (-N = N-) em sua estrutura.

It was up to 59 feet (18m) wide in the highest workings of the Greenside Mine, but averaged about 8 feet (2.5m) wide in deeper workings. The vein contained galena in a mixture of quartz and smashed rock. Galena (lead sulphide) is an ore of lead. The ore from Greenside also yielded 10oz of silver per ton of lead. Higher levels of the vein also contained quantities of baryte (barium sulphate), although at the time this had no commercial value.

500|$|In stark {{contrast}} to this, all four silver(I) halides are known. The fluoride, chloride, and bromide have the sodium chloride structure, but the iodide has three known stable forms at different temperatures; that at room temperature is the cubic zinc <b>blende</b> structure. They can all be obtained by the direct reaction of their respective elements. As the halogen group is descended, the silver halide gains more and more covalent character, solubility decreases, and the color changes from the white chloride to the yellow iodide as the energy required for ligand-metal charge transfer (X−Ag+ → XAg) decreases. The fluoride is anomalous, as the fluoride ion is so small {{that it has a}} considerable solvation energy and hence is highly water-soluble and forms di- and tetrahydrates. The other three silver halides are highly insoluble in aqueous solutions and are very commonly used in gravimetric analytical methods.

2500|$|Copper(I) iodide, {{like most}} [...] "binary" [...] (containing only two elements) metal halides, is an {{inorganic}} polymer.

[...] The ions are tetrahedrally coordinated when in the zinc <b>blende</b> or the wurtzite structure, with a Cu-I distance of 2.338 Å. [...] Copper(I) bromide and copper(I) chloride also transform from the zinc <b>blende</b> structure to the wurtzite structure at 405 and 435°C, respectively. Therefore, the longer the copper – halide bond length, the lower the temperature needs to be to change the structure from the zinc <b>blende</b> structure to the wurtzite structure. The interatomic distances in copper(I) bromide and copper(I) chloride are 2.173 and 2.051 Å, respectively.|$|E

2500|$|Another fragile {{candidate}} mineral is sphalerite (zinc <b>blende).</b> Gem-quality {{material is}} usually a strong yellow to honey brown, orange, red, or green; its very high RI (2.37) and dispersion (0.156) make for an extremely lustrous and fiery gem, {{and it is also}} isotropic. But here again, its low hardness (2.5–4) and perfect dodecahedral cleavage preclude sphalerite's wide use in jewelry. Two calcium-rich members of the garnet group fare much better: these are grossularite (usually brownish orange, rarely colorless, yellow, green, or pink) and andradite. The latter is the rarest and most costly of the garnets, with three of its varieties—topazolite (yellow), melanite (black), and demantoid (green)—sometimes seen in jewelry. Demantoid (literally [...] "diamond-like") especially has been prized as a gemstone since its discovery in the Ural Mountains in 1868; it is a noted feature of antique Russian and Art Nouveau jewelry. Titanite or sphene is also seen in antique jewelry; it is typically some shade of chartreuse and has a luster, RI (1.885–2.050), and dispersion (0.051) high enough to be mistaken for diamond, yet it is anisotropic (a high birefringence of 0.105–0.135) and soft (hardness 5.5).|$|E

5000|$|Copper(I) iodide, {{like most}} [...] "binary" [...] (containing only two elements) metal halides, is an {{inorganic}} polymer. It has a rich phase diagram, {{meaning that it}} exists in several crystalline forms. It adopts a zinc <b>blende</b> structure below 390 °C (γ-CuI), a wurtzite structure between 390 and 440 °C (β-CuI), and a rock salt structure above 440 °C (α-CuI). The ions are tetrahedrally coordinated when in the zinc <b>blende</b> or the wurtzite structure, with a Cu-I distance of 2.338 Å. Copper(I) bromide and copper(I) chloride also transform from the zinc <b>blende</b> structure to the wurtzite structure at 405 and 435 °C, respectively. Therefore, the longer the copper - halide bond length, the lower the temperature needs to be to change the structure from the zinc <b>blende</b> structure to the wurtzite structure. The interatomic distances in copper(I) bromide and copper(I) chloride are 2.173 and 2.051 Å, respectively.|$|E
