5|$|Holofcener {{wrote the}} script, which was partly {{inspired}} <b>by</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> life, {{after she was}} approached by two producers from Fox Searchlight Pictures who offered to produce her next project. It was filmed in Los Angeles on a budget of $8 million. Gandolfini died after the film was completed but before it was released; Holofcener dedicated the film to him.|$|E
5|$|The {{evidence}} of the wreck refutes Goodall's theory of a torpedo explosion, while the eyewitness {{evidence of}} venting from the 4-inch magazine prior to the main explosion conflicts with {{the theory that the}} Hood was blown up <b>by</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> guns.

5|$|In 1946, Ferrier {{made her}} stage debut, in the Glyndebourne Festival premiere of Benjamin Britten's opera The Rape of Lucretia. A year later {{she made her}} first {{appearance}} as Orfeo in Gluck's Orfeo ed Euridice, a work with which she became particularly associated. <b>By</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> choice, these were her only two operatic roles. As her reputation grew, Ferrier formed close working relationships with major musical figures, including Britten, Sir John Barbirolli, Bruno Walter and the accompanist Gerald Moore. She became known internationally through her three tours to the United States between 1948 and 1950 and her many visits to continental Europe.|$|E
5|$|Kogălniceanu's nephew, Grigore, {{himself a}} local {{leader of the}} Conservative Party and a major landowner, married to Adela Cantacuzino-Pașcanu, {{a member of the}} Cantacuzino family. He died in 1904, leaving his wife a large fortune, which she spent on a large {{collection}} of jewels and fortune-telling séances. Adela Kogălniceanu was robbed and murdered in October 1920; rumor had it that she had been killed <b>by</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> son, but this path was never pursued by authorities, who were quick to cancel the investigation (at the time, they were faced with the major strikes of 1920).|$|E
5|$|Larsen's {{exploration}} of race was informed <b>by</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> mixed racial heritage and the increasingly common practice of racial passing in the 1920s. Praised upon publication, the novel {{has since been}} celebrated in modern scholarship for its complex depiction of race, gender and sexuality, and {{is the subject of}} considerable scholarly criticism. As one of only two novels that Larsen wrote, Passing has been significant in placing its author at the forefront of several literary canons.|$|E

5|$|Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark {{consists}} of twenty-five letters that address an extensive range of contentious political topics, such as prison reform, land rights, and divorce laws, {{as well as}} less controversial subjects, such as gardening, salt works, and sublime vistas. Wollstonecraft's political commentary extends the ideas she had presented in An Historical and Moral View of the French Revolution (1794); her discussion of prison reform, for example, is informed <b>by</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> experiences in revolutionary France and those of her friends, {{many of whom were}} jailed.|$|E
5|$|Phillips, by now divorced, {{spent the}} {{following}} years on a downward spiral which included, <b>by</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> account, spending $120,000 on cocaine, before entering therapy to recover from her addiction. Then, in 1988, having been out of Hollywood for eleven years, she sold all her assets to produce The Beat, about {{a kid in a}} tough neighbourhood trying to teach poetry to local gangs. It was a critical and commercial disaster, grossing less than $5,000 at the box office, and Phillips turned to penning her scathing memoir to escape her financial difficulties.|$|E
5|$|The pilot episode {{introduced}} {{three additional}} primary cast members. Montag, who was previously featured on Laguna Beach {{in a limited}} capacity, became Conrad's housemate by the time production had begun on the first season of The Hills. On the series, it was depicted as if Montag had befriended Patridge <b>by</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> doing, though Patridge claimed that a producer offered her {{a position on the}} series to become friends with Conrad and Montag. Port was introduced to the series as Conrad's co-intern at Teen Vogue.|$|E

5|$|The {{ship was}} blown up <b>by</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> guns. At the second board, eyewitnesses {{reported}} unusual types of {{discharge from the}} 15-inch guns of Hood, suggesting that a shell could have detonated within the gun, causing an explosion within the gunhouse. It is possible that, under the stress of combat, the safety measures, introduced after the disasters at Jutland to prevent such an explosion reaching the magazines, could have failed.|$|E
5|$|Tracy Enid Flick is {{a fictional}} character, {{subjected}} in the 1998 novel Election by Tom Perrotta and portrayed by Reese Witherspoon in the 1999 film {{adaptation of the}} same title.

In both the novel and the film, she is the main antagonist.|$|E
5|$|España, Alfonso XIII, and Jaime I {{served in}} the 1st Squadron of the Spanish Fleet, which became the Training Squadron in the 1920s. They all saw action during the Rif War in the early 1920s {{supporting}} Spanish ground forces in North Africa. España ran aground in August 1923 and the Navy could not salvage her; she instead broke up under tidal forces. Alfonso XIII was renamed España in 1931 after her namesake, King Alfonso XIII was forced into exile. The two surviving ships served {{on opposite sides of}} the Spanish Civil War, and both were destroyed during the conflict. España struck a naval mine laid <b>by</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> side in on 30 April 1937 and sank, and Jaime I was destroyed by an internal explosion in June 1937.|$|E

Sabin brings with him Cyan Garamonde, whose family was killed during the Empire's siege of Doma Castle when Kefka Palazzo ordered the water supply poisoned, and Gau, a feral child he befriended on the Veldt. In Narshe, the Returners prepare to defend the frozen esper from the Empire. After the player successfully thwarts the Imperial invasion, Terra approaches the frozen esper, prompting her to transform into an esper-like form herself. She flies away, confused and horrified <b>by</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> transformation.|$|E
5|$|In 1931, {{after the}} {{overthrow}} of King Alfonso XIII, his namesake battleship was renamed España. In the mid-1930s, the Spanish Navy considered modernization programs for the two surviving battleships, but none came to fruition, primarily {{as a result of}} the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936. The two ships found themselves on opposite sides during the conflict; España served on the side of Francisco Franco's Nationalists, and Jaime I fought for the Republicans. España was used for coastal bombardment and to enforce the blockade of Republican ports, while Jaime I unsuccessfully attempted to disrupt the blockade, though neither ship engaged the other. In August 1936, Jaime I was attacked and moderately damaged by Nationalist bombers; while undergoing repairs in Cartagena, she was destroyed by an internal explosion in June 1937. España was sunk on 30 April 1937 after striking a mine laid <b>by</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> side off the coast of Santander in northern Spain.|$|E
5|$|The keel for U-38 {{was laid}} down on 15 April 1937 and after {{over a year}} and a half of {{construction}} she was commissioned on 24 October 1938 with Oberleutnant zur See Heinrich Liebe in command. Upon commissioning, U-38 was assigned to the 6th U-boat Flotilla. Like U-37, U-38 conducted eleven patrols. During these patrols she managed to sink or damage over 30 enemy vessels. Like U-37, U-38 ranks as one of the most successful U-boats of World War II, holding 10th place. With World War II drawing to a disastrous close for Germany, U-38 was scuttled <b>by</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> crew west of Wesermünde on 5 May 1945.|$|E

5|$|The {{ship was}} {{transferred}} to Halifax, Nova Scotia that same month for convoy escort duties. In October 1939, York was assigned to Force F at Halifax, which was active in hunting for commerce raiders and protecting convoys. She was briefly refitted in Bermuda between 31 October and 22 November before she returned to Great Britain for a more thorough refit in December. Upon its completion on 9 February York {{was assigned to the}} 1st Cruiser Squadron of Home Fleet. On 3 March 1940 the ship intercepted the German blockade runner Arucas in the Denmark Strait near Iceland, but she was scuttled <b>by</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> crew before she could be captured.|$|E

In this episode, after Mulder is forced to accept that his mother’s death was <b>by</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> hand, he is led by a man whose son disappeared years earlier to another truth: that his sister, Samantha, was among the souls taken by ‘walk-ins’, saving the souls of children doomed to live unhappy lives.|$|E
