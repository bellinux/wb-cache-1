The study aimed at assessing the impact of a Clinical Pathway (CP) implementation, required by the Regional Healthcare Service, in terms of effectiveness (virological and immunological conditions) and efficiency (economic resources absorption), from the <b>budget</b> <b>holder</b> perspective. Data derived from a multi-centre cohort of patients treated in 6 Hospitals that provided care to approximately 42 % of the total HIV+ patients, in Lombardy Region, Italy. Two phases were compared: Pre-CP (2009 - 2010) vs. Post-CP implementation (2011 - 2012). All HIV infected adults, observed in the participating hospitals during the study periods, were enrolled and stratified into the 3 categories defined by the Regional CP: first-line, switch for toxicity/other, and switch for failure. The study population was composed of 1, 284 patients (Pre-CP phase) and 1, 135 patients (Post-CP phase). The results showed that the same level of virological and immunological effectiveness was guaranteed to HIV+ patients: 81. 2 % of Pre-CP phase population and 83. 2 % of Post-CP phase population had undetectable HIV-RNA (defined as < 50 copies/mL) at 12 -month follow up. CD 4 + cell counts increased by 28 ± 4 cells/mm 3 in Pre-CP Phase and 39 ± 5 cells/mm 3 in Post-CP Phase. From an economic point of view, the CP implementation led to a substantial advantage: the mean total costs related to the management of the HIV disease (ART, hospital admission and laboratory tests) decreased (- 8. 60 %) in the Post-CP phase (p-value < 0. 0001).

This paper considers {{the costs and benefits}} of PBs - to local authority Social Services Departments, and to people using PBs, respectively - in a single English local authority setting. A comparative design was used to collect data from a large sample of 'traditional' social services users and a cohort of people who were using PBs as Direct Payments. Benefits relative to costs were compared using a statistical technique known as 'bootstrapping'. The authors found that, compared to younger adults, older people did not greatly benefit from possessing a budget on the outcome measures used, but costs were higher for budget holders across all care groups. These findings support evidence from an earlier study (Glendinning et al., 2008) and raise important questions about the suitability of PBs as a means of achieving personalised services for older people and the implications for social work practice...|$|E

40|$|Devolution {{has become}} a {{cornerstone}} of modern public-service management and this tendency is confirmed by several reforms carried out during the 1990 s, namely in Europe, in the health sector. In this context, resource allocation decisions depend on multiple <b>budget</b> <b>holders.</b> Our objective is therefore to discuss possible consequences of relaxing the hypothesis of a single budget, which has been widely adopted in the literature about the equity-efficiency trade-off in health care resource allocation. We compare the baseline case of centralisation with decentralisation. In the former scenario, a fixed budget, M, is allocated to all {{or some of the}} individuals that benefit from the available health care technologies (t 1 and t 2), in order to achieve efficiency and equity. In the case of decentralisation, M is allocated to jurisdictions A and B, giving rise to local budgets, Mj, j=A,B. These budgets are in turn allocated by local <b>budget</b> <b>holders</b> to local residents that benefit from existing technologies, assuming a constant set of objectives of health care. We analyse both contexts of perfect information and uncertainty. If the unique objective of health care is health maximisation, then, in the presence of information asymmetry, decentralisation is likely to improve health outcomes. However, when we consider equity objectives as well, there might be a trade-off between the optimal allocation of M and the optimal allocation of local budgets. To illustrate the pertinence of these questions, we discuss our analysis {{in the light of the}} English case, where 75 % of NHS resources have been devolved to Primary Car...|$|R

40|$|In their {{discussion}} - Participative Budgeting and Participant Motivation: A Review of the Literature - by Frederick J. Demicco, Assistant Professor, School of Hotel, Restaurant and Institutional Management, The Pennsylvania State University and Steven J. Dempsey, Fulton F. Galer, Martin Baker, Graduate Assistants, College of Business at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, the authors initially observe: “In recent years behavioral literature has {{stressed the importance}} of participation In goal-setting by those most directly affected by those goals. The common postulate is that greater participation by employees in the various management functions, especially the planning function, will lead to improved motivation, performance, coordination, and functional behavior. The authors analyze this postulate {{as it relates to the}} budgeting process and discuss whether or not participative budgeting has a significant positive impact on the motivations of budget participants. ” In defining the concept of budgeting, the authors offer: “Budgeting is usually viewed as encompassing the preparation and adoption of a detailed financial operating plan…” In furthering that statement they also furnish that budgeting’s focus is to influence, in a positive way, how managers plan and coordinate the activities of a property in a way that will enhance their own performance. In essence, framing an organization within its described boundaries, and realizing its established goals. The authors will have you know, to control budget is to control operations. What kind of parallels can be drawn between the technical methods and procedures of budgeting, and managerial behavior? “In an effort to answer this question, Ronen and Livingstone have suggested that a fourth objective of budgeting exists, that of motivation,” say the authors with attribution. “The managerial function of motivation is manipulative in nature. ” Demicco, Dempsey, Galer, and Baker attempt to quantify motivation as a psychological premise using the expectancy theory, which encompasses empirical support, intuitive appeal, and ease of application to the budgetary process. They also present you with House 2 ̆ 7 s Path-Goal model; essentially a mathematics type formula designed to gauge motivation. You really need to see this. The views of Argyris are also explored in particular detail. Although, the Argyris study was primarily aimed at manufacturing firms, and the effects on line-supervisors of the manufacturing budgets which were used to control and evaluate their performance, its application is relevant to the hospitality industry. As the title suggests, other notables in the field of behavioral motivation theory, and participation are also referenced. “Behavioral theory has been moving away from models of purported general applicability toward contingency models that are suited for particular situations,” say the authors in closing. “It is conceivable that some time in the future, contingency models will make possible the tailoring of budget strategies to individual <b>budget</b> <b>holder</b> personalities. ...|$|E
40|$|For {{thirty years}} it has been {{government}} policy to shift the balance of mental health care from institutional to community care. But progress towards the objectives of ‘normalisation’ and integration of individuals with a mental health problem in the wider community has been slow. The fragmentation of responsibility and resources {{for the provision of}} care in the community has been a major deterrent to the development of services. For this reason, establishing a <b>budget</b> <b>holder</b> with clearly defined responsibility for meeting the needs of individuals with a mental health problem is necessary for more efficient and equitable service delivery. Sir Roy Griffiths (1988) and the Audit Commissions (1986) have suggested that this reform be accompanied by greater competition between the suppliers of services, however, the nature of mental health care rules out significant efficiency improvements from such competition. The evidence presented in this paper shows that the decline in the psychiatric in-patient population, 1976 - 86, exceeded the development of services in the community. More individuals with a mental health problem now spend a greater part of their life in the community, but for many {{the quality of life in}} the community is likely to be poor, given the lack of services available to give these individuals the support they require. Assessing whether the development of community care has been stifled by a lack of resources is difficult because there is no budget for community care that can be examined and data on the expenditure on mental health care are incomplete. Figures presented in this paper show that, so far, resources have not been diverted from in-patient care. Consequently, additional funds must be relied upon to develop new services in the community. The growth of real expenditure on mental health care at £ 137. 5 m (13 %) 1976 / 77 - 1986 / 87 has probably been insufficient to develop a comprehensive community care service. As savings made by the hospitals lag behind the discharge of patients, there is a strong case for bridging finance in the short term to facilitate the transition to community care. Given the fragmentation of responsibility and resources for the provision of community care, the disincentives inhibiting the development of the service are such that, even if additional resources were available, there is no guarantee that this would result in the development of the appropriate services. The proposal of both the Audit Commission (1986) and Sir Roy Griffiths (1988) to make one authority responsible for meeting all the community care needs of individuals with a mental health problem is essential to the success of the policy. But at present no authority possesses the skills to arrange for both the ‘medical’ and ‘social’ needs of individuals to be met. One solution is to invest in training NHS staff to meet the ‘social’ needs of individuals with a mental health problem, which would enable the NHS to assume the lead agency role. The Audit Commission and the Griffiths Report both advocate the introduction of competition to the provision of care in the community, insisting that the lead agency purchases services from a number of providers and does not act as a monopoly service provider. The expectation is that competition will improve efficiency but it is demonstrated in this paper that a number of the characteristics of mental health care provision are likely to limit efficiency gains from competition. mental health...|$|E

Following an extensive literature review on budgeting within Corporations and Third Level Educational Institutions a mail survey questionnaire on the subject of budgeting and ERP control systems was sent to a selection of universities and third level institutions in the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom. The comparisons between budgeting within corporations and the third level educational sector are examined as well as the changing attitudes towards the 'traditional' budgeting methodologies. The emerging role ERP and information technology is having on budgeting processes is also investigated. Responses from the mail questionnaire were analysed to determine the budgeting and control methods adapted within third level educational institutions in the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom and to investigate the role of ERP and information technology on budgeting within the sector. The results of the emerging role ERP and information technology is having on budgeting processes is also investigated.

40|$|Purpose: This paper {{reviews the}} {{literature}} for evaluation studies that might fulfil {{the criteria of}} evidence-based medicine (EBM) in the specialism of 'supported education for people with long-term mental health needs', {{with a view to}} justifying the efficacy of these initiatives and attracting the associated funding. Design and Methods: A review of the literature was conducted for supported education evaluation studies that might fulfil the criteria of EBM. The methodologies for the studies found were examined both for appropriateness to the initiative being undertaken, and to what extent it complied with EBM. A recently developed and implemented evaluation methodology of supported education conducted over three years in a further education (FE) college (Morrison & Clift 2006) was then examined {{in the light of the}} above findings, with a view to attempting to overcome major difficulties and confirm outcomes. Results: Currently, the literature has few examples of programme evaluations that meet EBM criteria, which might convince <b>budget</b> <b>holders</b> of the efficacy of supported education. However, those that are available have consensus in their findings of the positive outcomes and the associated causative reasons. For the future, a recently developed and implemented triangulated evaluation methodology, and using Antonovsky's short-form Sense of Coherence questionnaire (SOC- 13) as a test, retest instrument, has been successful in answering the dichotomy of rigour with appropriateness, and issues of consistency of evaluation methods and reducing the multitude of measuring instruments founds in present studies. Implications: This research has government target implications for <b>budget</b> <b>holders,</b> health promotion staff and mental health teams working within the recovery model of health, in the collaborative use of resources to assist people recovering from or managing mental health difficulties to move forward in their lives. Conclusion: This study offers an appropriate and rigorous methodology and test, retest instrument for a non-randomised control trial suitable for the social sciences, and especially for evaluating supported education initiatives, so that they can be properly validated and attract funding. It also supports the cost benefits of mental health promotion for those recovering from or managing their mental health needs. ...|$|R
