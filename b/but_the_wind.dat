5|$|Commander George Eyre {{took over}} command of Speedy in February1794. Speedy {{supported}} the siege and capture of Bastia, after which Eyre {{was ordered to}} join Diadem off Nice. While making his way there on 9June, he ran into a French fleet under Rear-Admiral Pierre Martin, which had sailed from Toulon several days earlier. Eyre attempted to escape, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> and sea favoured the larger vessels, and Speedy was chased down and captured. Eyre was brought aboard Admiral Martin's flagship {{and was told that}} the National Convention had recently ordered that no quarter should be given to the English or Hanoverians, and that had Martin's ship been first alongside, he would have sunk Speedy. The sudden appearance of a British fleet curtailed the interview, and the French hurried back to Gourjean roadstead outside Toulon, taking Speedy and the captured British crew with them.|$|E
5|$|Pliny the Elder and {{his party}} saw flames coming from several parts of the crater. After staying overnight, the party was driven from the {{building}} by an accumulation of material, presumably tephra, which threatened to block all egress. They woke Pliny, who had been napping and emitting loud snoring. They elected {{to take to the}} fields with pillows tied to their heads to protect them from the raining debris. They approached the beach again <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> prevented the ships from leaving. Pliny sat down on a sail that had been spread for him and could not rise even with assistance when his friends departed. Though Pliny the Elder died, his friends ultimately escaped by land.|$|E
5|$|Although {{it was not}} {{immediately}} obvious to the men on Bellone, the new arrival was Plampin's Powerful, which had arrived in Indian waters on 13 June 1806. Finding no trace of Willaumez, who had elected {{to remain in the}} Atlantic, Plampin briefly anchored at Madras and subsequently cruised off Ceylon. There, following intelligence sent by Pellew, he captured the 20-gun French privateer Henriette near Trincomalee after an 11-hour chase. From information possibly supplied by prisoners removed from Henriette or possibly from a merchant ship sailing from Colombo, Plampin learned of Perroud's operations and had arranged to meet Rattlesnake off the Little Basses Reef. In the hope of luring the privateer into a confrontation, he disguised his large warship to look like an East Indiaman. Perroud rapidly saw through the disguise, and also noticed that while the wind remained strong off the coast, Powerful was further out to sea and appeared becalmed. Realising that his only option was to sail between Powerful and the shore, Perroud turned eastwards, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> gradually strengthened for Powerful and by 17:00 the ship of the line was within range of Bellone with her bow chasers.|$|E

5|$|During the afternoon, {{satellites}} {{revealed that}} Laura {{had developed a}} deep warm core, a characteristic of a tropical cyclone, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> field remained subtropical in nature. By the nighttime hours, the radius of the strongest winds contracted to 80mi (130km), much smaller than what is typical of a subtropical cyclone. However, Laura was still {{under the influence of}} an upper-level low and cloud tops remained shallow. However, the cloud tops became colder overnight and Laura {{was on the verge of}} becoming a tropical cyclone by the morning of September30, but strong interaction with the upper-level low meant it was still subtropical. Despite moving over colder waters, a water vapor satellite image determined that Laura had separated itself from the upper-level low, signifying it had developed into a tropical cyclone. Laura was re-classified as a tropical storm at a relatively high latitude, 40.6°N. Not long after being declared tropical, early signs of an extratropical transition appeared. Cold air began to enter the storm on the west side and forecast models showed Laura becoming extratropical the next morning and non-tropical later the next day.|$|E
25|$|The {{start time}} for the second race {{of the day was}} pushed back several times due to the wind {{exceeding}} the allowed limit. At one point the teams were able to enter the box, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> then exceeded the limit again. Racing was then postponed for the day, allowing Oracle to stay alive for another day.|$|E
25|$|The second {{race of the}} day {{suffered}} a 15-minute wind delay postponement, right as the boats hit the start line. Barker had nailed a time on distance sprint to the line to jump out to a lead {{on the way to}} the reach mark. The boats made their way back to the starting area, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> and the strong outgoing tide combined to confirm the postponement of racing for the day.|$|E
25|$|Eigtved {{became the}} Art Academy's first {{director}} in 1751. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>winds</b> of artistic change were already blowing, and Eigtved’s rococo style, {{which had been}} popular for so long, was about to suffer with the absolutist King's change of interest.|$|R

25|$|Between May and September, Lieutenant Viscount Falkland {{was acting}} captain of Cameleon. Boyer {{returned}} to command in November, and on 1 March 1798 was 10 leagues north of Guernsey when he sighted a cutter. Cameleon gave chase, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> was slight and the cutter's crew {{was able to}} row her to the safety under the guns on the Île de Batz. Boyer stated in his letter reporting the action {{that if he had}} had three more leagues he would have captured the cutter.|$|E
25|$|Flamethrowers were {{employed}} in naval combat in the Yangtze river, and large-scale use of the flamethrower is recorded in 975, when the Southern Tang navy employed flamethrowers against Song naval forces, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> blew the other way, causing the Southern Tang fleet to be immolated, and allowing the Song to conquer South China.During Song times, the flamethrower was used not only in naval combat but also in defense of cities, where they {{were placed on the}} city walls to incinerate any attacking soldiers.|$|E
25|$|During April 1881, {{under the}} command of John William Nicholson, the Advance got away from a near miss when leaving the Grey River at Greymouth under tow of the steam tug Dispatch. The tow ropes were lost and the vessel drifted into the breakwater, moving too fast for the anchor to have held her. The sails were raised, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> had died away, and the crew lost control of the vessel. The Dispatch, however, managed to take the Advance in tow once again and left her on the flat {{opposite}} the town. Three feet of water had washed aboard, but no major damage was sustained.|$|E

25|$|Just {{before dawn}} on 27 April, the 16th (Irish) Division {{and part of}} the 15th (Scottish) Division were {{subjected}} to a cloud gas attack near Hulluch. The gas cloud and artillery bombardment were followed by raiding parties, which made temporary lodgements in the British lines. Two days later the Germans began another gas attack <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> turned and blew the gas back over the German lines. A large number of German casualties were caused by the change in the wind direction and the decision to go ahead against protests by local officers, which were increased by British troops, who fired on German soldiers as they fled in the open.|$|E
25|$|Two more ships {{entered the}} sound — San Juan de Ragusa (650 tons, 285 men), the other unidentified. San Juan de Ragusa was in {{distress}} and sank — perhaps on striking Dunbinna reef. San Juan de Bautista attempted {{to take advantage}} of an ebb tide and sail south out of the sound, but ended up tacking about on the flood tide to avoid the numerous reefs, before sailing through the north-west passage. After a difficult night, the crew were dismayed to find themselves {{at the mouth of the}} sound once more. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> blew from the south-east, and San Juan de Bautista finally escaped on 25 September and made it home to Spain through a terrible storm.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} many shipwrecks on Chesil Beach, {{particularly}} during the age of sail. The beach was particularly dangerous within the English Channel, as it forms an extended lee shore during south-westerly gales. A ship coming up the Channel had to clear Portland Bill to be safe, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> and tide would be pushing it northwards into Lyme Bay. When sailing ships were common, a strong string of coastguards were based along the beach, with lookouts and cottages at Chiswell, Wyke Regis, Chickerell, Langton Herring, Abbotsbury, East Bexington, Burton Bradstock and West Bay. At present there are no manned stations along the beach, as coverage is provided when required from Portland Coastguard.|$|E

5|$|At Vauxhall, Sir Samuel Morland built a fine room, anno 1667, {{the inside}} all of looking-glass, and fountains very {{pleasant}} to behold, {{which is much}} visited by strangers: it {{stands in the middle}} of the garden, covered with Cornish slate, on the point of which he placed a punchinello, very well carved, which held a dial, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>winds</b> have demolished it.|$|R
25|$|Following Operation Desert Storm, the 1st Infantry Division {{returned}} to Fort Riley. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>winds</b> of change {{were once again}} blowing across the Army and affected the post.

Budget cuts and revised strategic thinking resulted in troop cutbacks.|$|R
25|$|On 25 October, Hawkins sighted two strange vessels {{some five}} or six leagues off Pointe du Raz. Dispatch {{captured}} both, which {{proved to be the}} French gun-vessels No. 345 and No. 353. Each was armed with two brass guns, one a 32-pounder and the other a 6-pounder. Each had a crew of 20 soldiers. They had left Brest for Odierne (or Dandiorne) <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> had blown them out to sea. Conquest arrived on the scene and then the British sighted two more gun-vessels. Dispatch captured one, No. 371, armed like the two already captured, but with a crew of 22. Hawkins thought it too dangerous to try to send the three gun-vessels to England so he sank them after having removed the guns.|$|E
25|$|Pliny and {{his party}} saw flames coming from several parts of the mountain, which Pliny and his friends {{attributed}} to burning villages. After staying overnight, the party was driven from the building by an accumulation of material which threatened to block all egress. They woke Pliny, who had been napping and emitting loud snoring. They elected {{to take to the}} fields with pillows tied to their heads to protect them from rockfall. They approached the beach again <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> had not changed. Pliny sat down on a sail that had been spread for him and could not rise even with assistance when his friends departed, escaping ultimately by land. Very likely, he had collapsed and died, which is the most popular explanation of why his friends abandoned him, although Suetonius offers an alternative story of his ordering a slave to kill him to avoid the pain of incineration. How the slave would have escaped to tell the tale remains a mystery. There is no mention of such an event in his nephew's letters.|$|E
25|$|The French were {{severely}} mauled by Saumarez's squadron, several French ships also running aground, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> {{prevented the}} British from {{taking advantage of}} the opportunity to closely engage them. Hannibal was under heavy fire from the anchored Formidable and an array of Spanish batteries and gunboats, and could not bring her guns to bear on them. The main and mizzen masts were shot away, and her casualties mounted, while attempts to pull the ship off the shoal failed. The British force had suffered considerable damage to sails, masts and rigging, and in the light breeze, Saumarez saw there was the danger that the remainder of his ships might run aground like the Hannibal. At 13:35 he ordered his squadron to withdraw to Gibraltar, leaving the damaged Hannibal behind. Ferris ordered the survivors of his crew below decks to escape the worst of the fire as the combined guns of the French and Spanish forces turned on the last remaining target. He held out until 14:00, when seeing that further resistance would be futile, he ordered the colours struck, and the Hannibals ensign came down.|$|E

25|$|At dawn on {{the next}} day, Loredan sent two galleys, bearing the Banner of Saint Mark, to the entry of the port of Gallipoli to open negotiations. In {{response}} the Turks sent 32 ships to attack them. Loredan withdrew his two galleys, and began to withdraw, while shooting at the Turkish ships, in order to lure them away from Gallipoli. As the Ottoman ships could {{not keep up with}} their oars, they set sail; on the Venetian side, the galley from Napoli di Romania tarried during the manoeuvre and was in danger of being caught by the pursuing Ottoman ships, so that Loredan likewise ordered his ships to set sail. Once they were had made ready for combat, Loredan ordered his ten galleys to lower sails, turn about, and face the Ottoman fleet. At that point, however, the eastern wind rose suddenly, and allowed the Ottomans to break off the pursuit and head back to Gallipoli. Loredan in turn tried {{to catch up with the}} Ottomans, firing at them with his guns and crossbows and launching grappling hooks at the Turkish ships, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> and the current allowed the Ottomans to retreat speedily behind the fortifications of Gallipoli. According to Loredan, the engagement lasted until the 22nd hour.|$|E
500|$|According {{to local}} tradition, two small Mason {{children}}, William and Ann, were {{playing in the}} estate's yard when a storm arrived. William took shelter in the estate's chicken coop <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> toppled the structure, killing him. Soon after William's death, his sister Ann drowned in a bathtub at Colross. Both children were interred in the estate's burial vault in the garden. Successive residents at Colross, including members of the Smoot family, claimed the estate was haunted by the deceased Mason children; they reported hearing children [...] "giggling, singing, and talking", and witnessed apparitions of children in pre-Civil War attire.|$|E
