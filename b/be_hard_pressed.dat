When {{earlier in the season}} one would <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> <b>pressed</b> to find more than a brief mention of the previous nights results, suddenly they were getting major linage in the major daily papers, nightly features on the TV news, and players making the rounds on local radio shows.|$|E
25|$|The {{strategic}} {{situation in}} Europe had altered considerably by January 1805. The Spanish had allied with France, but Napoleon {{was concerned about}} Austria and Russia, {{who appeared to be}} in negotiations with Britain. The danger of committing most of his forces across the Channel, from where they could not easily be recalled, had become clear to him. Should a combined Russian and Austrian force open a second front to the east, Napoleon would <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> <b>pressed</b> to deal with it. He decided to temporarily put his plans for invasion on hold, and developed a new strategy whereby his largely idle fleet could cause trouble for Britain. Villeneuve and Missiessy were ordered to embark troops and take their fleets to sea, where they would sail to the West Indies and attack the British possessions there. This would force the British to reallocate resources to defend them. Missiessy duly sailed from Rochefort on 11 January with five ships of the line, evaded Vice-Admiral Thomas Graves's blockading force and escaped into the Atlantic. Rear-Admiral Alexander Cochrane took his forces in pursuit, and both fleets sailed to the West Indies.|$|E
500|$|Fearing Tecumseh's {{imminent}} {{return with}} reinforcements, Harrison ordered {{his men to}} fortify their camp with works {{for the rest of}} the day. As the sentries moved back out, they discovered and scalped the bodies of 36 warriors. The following day, November 8, Harrison sent a small group of men to inspect the Shawnee town and found it was deserted except for one elderly woman too sick to flee. The remainder of the defeated Natives had evacuated the village during the night. Harrison ordered his troops to spare the woman, but to burn down Prophetstown and destroy the Native Americans' cooking implements, without which the confederacy would <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> <b>pressed</b> to survive the winter. Everything of value was confiscated, including 5,000 bushels of corn and beans stored for winter. Some of Harrison's soldiers dug up bodies from the graveyard in Prophetstown to scalp.|$|E

[...] A writer of DesiHits wrote that the video brought the [...] "same magic" [...] from his tribute to Jackson at the 2010 BET Awards, and added that it included [...] "great lighting and even better choreography." [...] Robbie Daw of Idolator found the video [...] "mildly enjoyable". Brad Wete of Entertainment Weekly called Brown's dancing [...] "tremendous" [...] and wrote, [...] "You'd <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> <b>pressed</b> {{trying to find a}} singer out there with enough dancing abilities to even attempt a proper Jackson tribute. Brown is one of the few—if not the only." [...] At the 2011 Soul Train Music Awards, the video was nominated for Best Dance Performance.|$|E
500|$|Although Game of Thrones was {{dismissed}} by some critics before it began, its {{success has been}} credited {{with an increase in}} the popularity of fantasy themes. On the eve of the second season's premiere, a CNN.com blog post by Joel Williams read, [...] "After this weekend, you may <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> <b>pressed</b> to find someone who isn't a fan of some form of epic fantasy" [...] and cited Ian Bogost as saying that the series continues a trend of successful screen adaptations beginning with Peter Jackson's 2001 The Lord of the Rings film trilogy and the Harry Potter films establishing fantasy as a mass-market genre; they are [...] "gateway drugs to fantasy fan culture". Its success in the face of its genre was attributed by writers to a longing for escapism in popular culture, frequent female nudity and a skill in balancing lighthearted and serious topics (dragons and politics, for example) which provided it with a prestige enjoyed by conventional, top-tier drama series.|$|E
500|$|Maeda {{focused on}} making jokes an {{important}} part of Angel Beats!, leading Toba to seek out Seiji Kishi to be the director, because of his experience in directing and his pulling power influence on the staff of P.A.Works, where there are many that are still young. Kishi was ultimately approached by P.A.Works representative director Kenji Horikawa about working on a [...] "school comedy written by a game scenario writer" [...] and was shocked after taking the director's position to discover Maeda was the screenwriter. Kishi commented how, far from just being a comedy, the series contains many different aspects, including flashy action scenes, live musical performances, and drama. Kishi stated that normally he would <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> <b>pressed</b> to cover this range of aspects, but was motivated by Maeda's uncompromising attitude in regards to the script. The decision to add in the all female band Girls Dead Monster was due to Maeda's intent to add in many different and interesting elements into the series.|$|E

500|$|On May17,2002, Robert S. Stephens and Roger A. Roffman of The Seattle Times {{wrote an}} {{analysis}} of [...] "Weekend at Burnsie's" [...] in a guest column for the newspaper. The two argued that drugs are almost always shown as having only negative effects, even though 10million people in the United States use marijuana for recreational purposes. [...] "We believe {{there are good reasons}} for a more honest dialogue about the positive and negative effects of marijuana use. A recent episode of the popular TV show The Simpsons highlighted {{the pros and cons of}} marijuana use, and Homer Simpson's experiences with marijuana provide an example of what we mean", they wrote. For example, when under the influence of marijuana, Homer is relieved from the pain in his eye, and he also finds himself having a variety of sensory experiences and an enhanced appreciation of music and food. [...] "These are real effects reported by many marijuana users, and we would <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> <b>pressed</b> to call them anything other than benefits", Stephens and Roffman wrote. However, Homer is also depicted spending more time with other drug users than with his family, and his friends find that his personality has changed. Eventually, Homer is shown having problems with memory and attention, losing track of the date on which a pro-marijuana rally takes place. Stephens and Roffman wrote that the side effects shown in the episode are [...] "Perhaps a bit exaggerated, but clearly there are costs of marijuana use similar to these that are experienced by real-life users." ...|$|E

[...] Since she is always perfectly straight, Gordon's own gift for projecting comic ambiguity in language and movement can shine all the brighter, with an innocence beyond stain.

2500|$|Westfall notes that, in {{the early}} modern period, the “word 'friend' carries special connotations within a context of patronage; {{authorities}} on patronage distinguish what they call instrumental friendship from emotional friendship… [...] Galileo's [...] "friends" [...] in Venice appear to have understood that the [...] "friendship" [...] entailed {{the use of their}} connections and influence on his behalf. In all of Galileo’s attempts to rise up the ladder of Patronage, one of his connections, Sagredo, would write him words that Westfall considers “ne would <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> <b>pressed</b> to find a better example of the language of patronage.” Westfall writes, “Sagredo, who was clearly tiring of the exercise, wanted to be sure that Galileo understood he had fulfilled his duty as a patron [...] ‘Since I have already satisfied abundantly enough the friendship I hold for you, the obligations to you which I acknowledge, and the favor and help that true gentlemen try to extend to the qualified who deserve it,’ he thought he might now honorably desist.” [...] Westfall also provides fantastic evidence directly from the mouth of Galileo as to the importance of Patronage to himself ...|$|E
2500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave Eagle Eye a {{score of}} two stars out of four, saying: [...] "The word 'preposterous' is too {{moderate}} to describe Eagle Eye. This film contains not a single plausible moment after the opening sequence, and that's borderline. It's not an assault on intelligence. It's an assault on consciousness." [...] James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave the film {{one and a half}} stars out of four, saying: [...] "This movie tests the viewing public's tolerance for enduring crass stupidity when the payoff is a series of repetitive, ADD-infected chase scenes. Director D.J. Caruso does a moderately good job of hiding how incredibly dumb this screenplay is by keeping things moving at such a whirlwind pace that a lot more seems to be happening than actually is. In reality, the chase scenes don't mean anything because they don't advance the plot—it's mice on a treadmill, running and running and not getting anywhere." [...] The Hollywood Reporter called it a [...] "slick, silly techno-thriller" [...] and [...] "Even those who surrender all disbelief at the door will <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> <b>pressed</b> not to smirk at some of the wildly improbable plotting." ...|$|E

[...] However, he was critical of the difficulty, claiming [...] "from the moment they brandish a weapon in-game, RPG veterans will most likely tell that EA {{went to great lengths}} to make The Third Age as accessible as possible." [...] He also criticized the story, writing [...] "gamers will <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> <b>pressed</b> to find an ounce of character development throughout the entire adventure," [...] and calling the characters [...] "soulless archetypes." [...] However, he concluded [...] "For the most part, The Third Age rips gamers from their living rooms and dumps them in a detailed rendition of Middle-earth. EA Redwood Shores has faithfully recreated everything from the glowing majesty of Rivendell to the murky depths of Helm's Deep. Suffice to say, this is one of the best looking games based on Tolkien's classic trilogy. But, as gamers everywhere know, looks aren't everything. It's one thing to have video games look as good as the movies they're based on, but what good is any of it if the actual gameplay isn't enough to keep you playing. Thankfully, this combat heavy RPG delivers the goods, although some die hard RPG fans may be put off by its overly streamlined approach." ...|$|E
