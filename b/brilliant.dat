5|$|Commander Alfred Godsal led {{the assault}} in HMS <b>Brilliant</b> {{and it was}} he who {{stumbled}} into the most effective German counter-measure first. As <b>Brilliant</b> staggered through the murk, the lookout spotted the buoy ahead and Godsal headed directly for it, coming under even heavier fire as he did so. Passing the navigation marker at speed, the cruiser was suddenly brought to a halt with a juddering lurch, throwing men to the decks and sticking fast in deep mud well outside the harbour mouth. Before warnings could be relayed to the Sirius following up close behind, she too passed the buoy and her captain Lieutenant-Commander Henry Hardy was shocked to see <b>Brilliant</b> dead ahead. With no time to manoeuvree, Sirius ploughed into the port quarter of <b>Brilliant,</b> the blockships settling into the mud in a tangle of wreckage.|$|E

5|$|In late 1758 <b>Brilliant</b> {{joined a}} Royal Navy {{squadron}} supporting amphibious raids along the French coastline. In company with other frigates she protected fleet transports and bomb vessels and assisted with shore bombardment in the Battle of Saint Cast on 11 September 1758. The progenitor of the Royal Geographic Society, James Rennell, was a midshipman aboard <b>Brilliant</b> {{during this period}} and produced his first coastal map while the frigate was stationed off Saint Cast. <b>Brilliant</b> played an undistinguished role in this engagement as her draught was too deep for her to approach the shore. By {{the afternoon of the}} battle she was close enough to the beach for her crew to witness the surrounding and defeat of the British Grenadier Guards, but was too distant to range her guns onto their French assailants.|$|E

5|$|On 24 December <b>Brilliant</b> and Coventry {{encountered}} {{their second}} privateer, the 24-gun Le Dragon. There {{was a brief}} exchange of fire in which four French sailors were killed and up to 12 wounded, against six wounded men aboard Coventry. After the outgunned French vessel struck her colours the British took her surviving 280 crew prisoner. On the following day a third French ship hove into view, the Intrepid, a 14-gun snow-rigged privateer. After a short chase she fell within range of Brilliants guns; the French fired first, wounding one British sailor. The responding broadside from <b>Brilliant</b> capsized Intrepid and killed ten men among her crew of 120. The survivors were taken prisoner aboard <b>Brilliant</b> and handed over to British authorities at Plymouth.|$|E

5|$|The Admiralty Board also {{considered}} <b>Brilliant</b> too lightly armed for her size. She measured an additional 50 tons burthen over a standard 32-gun frigate but carried only four more cannon. For these reasons, <b>Brilliant</b> {{was the last}} vessel {{to be built in}} the Venus-class. Subsequent generations of Royal Navy frigates preserved elements of her design, but with an extended hull to allow for additional gun ports and the carrying of larger weapons including the 18-pounder long gun.|$|E

5|$|Bellona {{opened fire}} on Corageux while <b>Brilliant</b> engaged Maliceuse and Hermione. Through {{skillful}} sailing, Logie {{was able to keep}} both French frigates at bay and unable to assist Courageux, which surrendered to Bellona after ninety minutes of fighting. At 7.30 a.m. Maliceuse and Hermione made sail and retreated, with <b>Brilliant</b> too damaged to give chase. British losses in the battle numbered six killed and 28 wounded on Bellona and five killed and 16 wounded on <b>Brilliant.</b> On the French side, losses on Courageux alone were 240 killed and 110 wounded. Historian William Laird Clowes has suggested that the much higher French casualty rate was the result of differences in tactics, with the French gun crews trained to fire at the masts and rigging of an enemy ship in order to disable them ahead of a boarding attempt. By contrast, British crews were trained to fire into the hulls of enemy ships.|$|E
