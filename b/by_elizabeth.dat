Calbovista subsculpta is a good edible species while its interior flesh (the gleba) is still firm and white. As the puffball matures, its insides become dark brown and powdery from mature spores.|$|E

5|$|By 1914 the non-militant {{elements}} of the suffrage movement had built up a steady presence and, although damaged by the bad press violent action brought, they also gained from the publicity. A summer school {{had been set up}} by the NUWSS in the Conwy Valley the previous year and now their members were benefitting from the training in public speaking that was given.
