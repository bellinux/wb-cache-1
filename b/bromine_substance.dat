Recent observations show that very short-lived substances, with lifetimes generally under six months, are also {{an important source of}} stratospheric halogens(4, 5). Short-lived <b>bromine</b> <b>substances</b> are produced naturally by seaweed and phytoplankton, whereas short-lived chlorine substances are primarily anthropogenic. Here we used a chemical transport model to quantify the depletion of ozone in the lower stratosphere from short-lived halogen substances, and a radiative transfer model to quantify the radiative effects of that ozone depletion. According to our simulations, ozone loss from short-lived substances had a radiative effect nearly half that from long-lived halocarbons in 2011 and, since pre-industrial times, has contributed a total of about - 0. 02 W m(- 2) to global radiative forcing. We find natural short-lived <b>bromine</b> <b>substances</b> exert a 3. 6 times larger ozone radiative effect than long-lived halocarbons, normalized by halogen content, and show atmospheric levels of dichloromethane, a short-lived chlorine substance not controlled by the Montreal Protocol, are rapidly increasing.

40|$|We {{conducted}} {{measurements of}} the five important short-lived organic bromine species in the marine boundary layer (MBL). Measurements {{were made in the}} Northern Hemisphere mid-latitudes (Sylt Island, North Sea) in June 2009 and in the tropical Western Pacific during the TransBrom ship campaign in October 2009. For the one-week time series on Sylt Island, mean mixing ratios of CHBr 3, CH 2 Br 2, CHBr 2 Cl and CH 2 BrCl were 2. 0, 1. 1, 0. 2, 0. 1 ppt, respectively. We found maxima of 5. 8 and 1. 6 ppt for the two main components CHBr 3 and CH 2 Br 2. Along the cruise track in the Western Pacific (between 41 ° N and 13 ° S) we measured mean mixing ratios of 0. 9, 0. 9, 0. 2, 0. 1 and 0. 1 ppt for CHBr 3, CH 2 Br 2, CHBrCl 2, CHBr 2 Cl and CH 2 BrCl. Air samples with coastal influence showed considerably higher mixing ratios than the samples with open ocean origin. Correlation analyses of the two data sets yielded strong linear relationships between the mixing ratios of four of the five species (except for CH 2 BrCl). Using a combined data set from the two campaigns and a comparison with the results from two former studies, rough estimates of the molar emission ratios between the correlated substances were: 9 / 1 / 0. 35 / 0. 35 for CHBr 3 /CH 2 Br 2 /CHBrCl 2 /CHBr 2 Cl. Additional measurements were made in the tropical tropopause layer (TTL) above Teresina (Brazil, 5 ° S) in June 2008, using balloon-borne cryogenic whole air sampling technique. Near the level of zero clear-sky net radiative heating (LZRH) at 14. 8 km about 2. 25 ppt organic bromine was bound to the five short-lived species, making up 13 % of total organic bromine (17. 82 ppt). CH 2 Br 2 (1. 45 ppt) and CHBr 3 (0. 56 ppt) accounted for 90 % of the budget of short-lived compounds in that region. Near the tropopause (at 17. 5 km) organic <b>bromine</b> from these <b>substances</b> was reduced to 1. 35 ppt, with 1. 07 and 0. 12 ppt attributed to CH 2 Br 2 and CHBr 3, respectively...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{investigate}} distributions of 32 volatile chlorinated and/or brominated halocarbons that are currently believed {{to be present in}} the tropical upper troposphere and stratosphere and to contribute to stratospheric ozone depletion and also to global warming. For this purpose an analytical system was established, which is capable to measure ultra-low concentrated atmospheric trace gases. A quadrupole Mass Spectrometric (MS) Detector was attached to an existing Gas Chromatograph with pre-concentration system and Electron Capture Detector (ECD). The characterisation of the chromatographic system was significantly enhanced by the subsequent identification of 48 additional volatile organic compounds. Furthermore a Gaussian fit algorithm, which was developed in the workgroup, was applied to the chromatographic signals. This algorithm was proven to reflect peaks quantitatively and to enhance the performance of the integration process – especially the reproducibilities for peaks with a low signal to noise ratio. As it is known that the Electron Capture Detector responds nonlinear the new MS detector was checked for such behaviour and found to respond linear. In logical consistency the complete quantification process including e. g. pre-concentration of trace gases and signal integration can be considered as linear responding within the investigated parameter ranges. Moreover, the long term stability of the targeted halocarbons was proven inside the calibration standard containers over a period of 25 months. Many substances were also found to be stable inside the containers used for storage of air samples but a number of substances showed significant concentration changes. These were mainly CH 3 Cl (methyl chloride), CH 3 Br (methyl bromide), CH 2 Cl 2 (dichloromethane), CHCl 3 (chloroform), CCl 4 (tetrachloromethane), C 2 Cl 4 (tetrachloroethene), CH 3 CCl 3 (methyl chloroform), CH 2 ClCH 2 Cl (1, 2 -dichloroethane) und C 2 H 5 Cl (chloroethane). But the number of affected substances and also the corresponding concentration changes varied between the individual containers. A systematic investigation of the influence of possible causes (e. g. air sampling methods, container materials) is recommended. Results from both internal detectors were compared and revealed biases and disadvantages of the ECD caused by its lower selectivity and its nonlinear response behaviour. Consequently the MS detector was chosen for the quantification of atmospheric trace gases. The quantification process was performed relative to externally calibrated air standards. To assess the uncertainties connected with different absolute calibration scales cross-comparisons between calibration standards of three different laboratories were carried out. Most substances’ calibrations agreed within the measurement uncertainties but significant differences were observed for CF 2 ClBr (H 1211), CH 3 Cl (methyl chloride), CH 2 Cl 2 (dichloromethane), CHCl 3 (chloroform), CCl 4 (tetrachloromethane) and CH 3 CCl 3 (methyl chloroform). As five of these substances were also observed to show concentration changes inside sample containers it is likely, that such changes are responsible for calibration differences. In addition to the detailed assessment of uncertainties connected with the analytical quantification process a set of air samples was available for measurements. These samples mainly originated from the upper troposphere and lower and middle stratosphere in the tropics and the determined halocarbon quantities were used to investigate their distributions in the respective atmospheric regions. In detail, the altitudinal distributions and interrelations of 17 long-lived halocarbons in the tropical stratosphere were determined and compared with those of other stratospheric regions. Tracer-tracer-correlations of these substances in the tropical stratosphere were found to differ from those in mid- and high-latitudes. Characteristic fit functions relative to CF 2 Cl 2 (F 12) which are valid for the tropical stratosphere in 2005 were derived as well as time-independent fit functions of fractional release factors (FRFs) relative to the mean age of air. Both sets of correlations could be used for the parameterisation and evaluation of models and also to reassess the Global Warming Potentials (GWPs) of the corresponding halocarbons which might affect future climate predictions. However, the data set on halocarbons in the tropical stratosphere is still insufficient to investigate the variability of tracer-tracer-correlations and FRFs caused by dynamical and photochemical processes. Therefore it is important for future research to perform additional measurements there and – if possible – to extend the measurements to the upper tropical stratosphere in order to characterise the sink of those halocarbons that are still present in these altitudes. In addition, the amount of chlorine and bromine present in the form of organic compounds inside and above the main stratospheric entrance region (the Tropical Tropopause Layer, TTL) was quantified in the frame of a case study. This was possible because of a cooperation with scientists from the University of East Anglia which carried out measurements of six additional halocarbons leading to a total of 28 quantified target substances. Ten of these substances have short atmospheric lifetimes compared with the mean transport times of tropospheric air to the stratosphere (i. e. lifetimes below 0. 5 years) and show non-uniform distributions in the upper troposphere. The contribution of these substances to stratospheric ozone depletion is subject of an ongoing scientific debate. In the performed case study a fraction range of short-lived halocarbons of 6 – 8 % (0. 98 – 1. 25 ppt) relative to the sum of <b>bromine</b> from organic <b>substances</b> and of 1. 1 – 1. 4 % (36. 6 – 47. 1 ppt) for the corresponding sum of chlorine was calculated to enter the stratosphere above Brazil in June 2005. Moreover by combining the data with tropospheric reference data and age of air observations the abundances of inorganic chlorine and bromine (Cly and Bry) were derived. At an altitude of 34 km an amount of 3062 ppt of Cly and 17. 5 ppt of Bry from organic source gases was calculated. The latter is significantly lower than Bry mixing ratios inferred from quasisimultaneous BrO measurements at 33 km altitude above Brazil (Dorf, 2005, Dorf et al., 2008). But at the University of East Anglia indications for the presence of unknown brominated organic substances in the TTL were found which might cause this difference. Finally, a major result of this thesis adds to the knowledge of the composition of the troposphere as three Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) were first observed. Trifluorochloroethene, 3 -chloropentafluoropropene and 4, 4 -dichlorohexafluoro- 1 -butene were found in air samples collected at the Taunus Observatory near Frankfurt (Main) and the Jungfraujoch High Altitude Research Station in Switzerland (Laube and Engel, 2008). Identification was possible because of an air plume containing high concentrations of these substances. It is suggested that the abundances found on this occasion originated from a local source. The atmospheric lifetimes of these substances are expected to be rather short as they contain a double bond. A quantitative calibration could only be derived for trifluorochloroethene but not for the other species by now. Thus, a relative sensitivity method was derived to get a first indication of the observed atmospheric abundances. All three CFCs could also be detected in air masses representative of background conditions, though with much lower concentrations. These species and some of their degradation products are toxic and could also be relevant for stratospheric and tropospheric ozone depletion. It is important {{to find out more about}} their atmospheric distributions, lifetimes, sinks and sources and their ability to reach the stratosphere to assess their possible influence on the global atmosphere. This will be done in the frame of the project "CLEARFOGG – Checking Layers of the Earths AtmospheRe For halogenated Ozone-depleting and Greenhouse Gases". This research project aims to perform a systematic scan of the atmosphere because there are indications for the presence of a number of halogenated organic compounds which are unknown by now. It was recently decided to be funded by the British National Environmental Research Council and will be carried out at the University of East Anglia mainly by the author of this thesis. Das Ziel dieser Arbeit war die Untersuchung der Verteilung von 32 flüchtigen halogenierten Kohlenwasserstoffen in der oberen Troposphäre sowie unteren und mittleren Stratosphäre in den Tropen. Die Zielsubstanzen waren 32 chlorierte und/oder bromierte Kohlenwasserstoffe, die bereits in der oberen tropischen Troposphäre (der stratosphärischen Haupteintragsregion) nachgewiesen worden sind und somit nicht nur nicht nur zur globalen Erwärmung sondern auch zum stratosphärischen Ozonabbau beitragen können (WMO, 2007, IPCC, 2007). Es existieren bisher nur sehr wenige Beobachtungen von Halogenkohlenwasserstoffen in der tropischen Stratosphäre. Diese sind zum Teil veraltet (z. B. Goldan et al., 1980) oder beschränken sich auf die untere Stratosphäre (z. B. Volk et al., 1997, Schauffler et al., 1999). Die chemische Zusammensetzung der tropischen Stratosphäre beeinflusst jedoch den dortigen Strahlungshaushalt und somit das Klima dieses Planeten. Deswegen war es äußerst wichtig, die Höhenverteilungen von Halogenkohlenwasserstoffen in dieser atmosphärischen Region zu charakterisieren. Für die Untersuchung der Verteilungen wurde zunächst ein analytisches System zur Messung von äußerst gering konzentrierten atmosphärischen Spurengasen aufgebaut.
