There are many differences between {{what would be}} the best floor for various sports and forms of dance.

25|$|However, {{the campus}} is found wanting {{in some of}} the more <b>basic</b> <b>requirements</b> of an {{educational}} institution. For instance, there are no separate common rooms for girls or boys, and only one of the two lecture halls, is big enough {{to keep up with the}} growing number of students applying. With the number of students per batch increasing every year, the need to expand this campus will become more serious in the near future.|$|E

25|$|The <b>basic</b> <b>requirements</b> {{build upon}} {{the first step}} in the pyramid: physiology. If there are deficits on this level, all {{behavior}} will be oriented to satisfy this deficit. Essentially, if you have not slept or eaten adequately, you won't be interested in your self-esteem desires. Subsequently, we have the second level, which awakens a need for security. After securing those two levels, the motives shift to the social sphere, the third level. Psychological requirements comprise the fourth level, while the top of the hierarchy consists of self-realization and self-actualization.|$|E

No specific physical security mechanisms are required in a Security Level 1 cryptographic module beyond the <b>basic</b> <b>requirement</b> for production-grade components.

The decision-maker must carry out the consultation with an open mind, but is not bound by views expressed to it.|$|E
25|$|In the {{academic}} world, plagiarism by students is usually considered {{a very serious}} offense that can result in punishments such as a failing grade on the particular assignment, the entire course, or even being expelled from the institution. Generally, the punishment increases as a person enters higher institutions of learning. The seriousness with which academic institutions address student plagiarism may be tempered by a recognition that students may not fully understand what plagiarism is. A 2015 study showed that students who were new to university study {{did not have a}} good understanding of even the <b>basic</b> <b>requirements</b> of how to attribute sources in written academic work, yet students were very confident that they understood what referencing and plagiarism are. The same students also had a lenient view of how plagiarism should be penalised.|$|E
