25|$|Two of {{the birds}} were {{captured}} for trade in 1987. A single male, paired with a female <b>blue-winged</b> <b>macaw,</b> was discovered at the site in 1990. A female Spix's macaw released from captivity at the site in 1995 was killed by collision with a power line after seven weeks. The last wild male disappeared from the site in October 2000; his disappearance was thought to have marked the extinction of this species in the wild. However, wild Spix's macaws may have been sighted in 2016.. While the IUCN Red List views its status as Critically Endangered and possibly extinct in the wild, ornithologist Nigel Collar of Birdlife International, the authority for the IUCN Redlist of birds now calls this bird extinct in the wild.|$|E

50|$|The <b>blue-winged</b> <b>macaw</b> attain sexual {{maturity}} between 2 and 4 {{years after they}} are born. Adult females usually produce two eggs which take approximately 29 days to hatch. Young blue-winged macaws learn to fly about 11 weeks after they have hatched. They stay with their parents {{for about a year}} after learning to fly. Relatively little information exists on its reproduction in the wild, but the breeding season in north-eastern Brazil is apparently from December to February. However, in 1990, a female <b>blue-winged</b> <b>macaw</b> was discovered with a male Spix's macaw in a site.|$|E
50|$|It has a {{total length}} of about 38 cm, of which almost half is tail feathers. The general plumage is green, with a {{distinct}} yellow collar that is broadest {{on the back of}} the neck. The yellow collar develops as the bird ages, with more vibrant colors found in mature birds. The front and crown is brownish black. The remiges and primary coverts are blue and the long, pointed tail has a red base, a narrow green center and a blue tip. The underside of the tail and flight feathers are greenish-yellow, similar to that of several other small macaws such as the <b>blue-winged</b> and red-bellied <b>macaw.</b> The legs are a dull pinkish color, and the iris is reddish to dull yellow. It has extensive bare white facial skin and the heavy bill is black, often tipped pale grey.|$|R
50|$|The <b>blue-winged</b> <b>macaw</b> (Primolius maracana), in aviculture more {{commonly}} known as Illiger's macaw, is a species of macaw found {{in central and eastern}} South America. It was previously placed in the genus Ara or Propyrrhura. Blue-winged macaws have been known to reach an age of 50-60 years.|$|E
50|$|The {{area for}} the natural {{monument}} is semi-arid, with typical caatinga vegetation, and subject to desertification.It has sandstone formations {{more than a billion}} years old, which have their own flora and endemic species.These include the endangered <b>blue-winged</b> <b>macaw</b> (Primolius maracana) and a newly reported skink of the Mabuya genus.|$|E
50|$|A {{census of}} birds from October 2005 to December 2006 {{recorded}} 226. Another 68 {{species have been}} reported by other authors, making a total of 293 in the ESEC. Many were endemic to the Atlantic Forest of cerrado, and some were endangered {{in the state of}} São Paulo.The <b>blue-winged</b> <b>macaw</b> (Primolius maracana) is considered vulnerable.|$|E
50|$|The <b>blue-winged</b> <b>macaw</b> {{occurs in}} eastern and {{southern}} Brazil (with a remnant population north-east), eastern Paraguay and, at least formerly, in far north-eastern Argentina and east of Bolivia. It occurs in evergreen and deciduous forests, with a preference for gallery forest. They mainly feed on seeds of Cnidoscolus phyllacanthus, Jatropha, Guazuma ulmifolia, and the non-native Melia azedarach. However, the birds also feed on fruits and nuts.|$|E
5000|$|... 346 {{bird species}} have been recorded, {{although}} some are dubious.Species include bare-faced curassow (Crax fasciolata), <b>blue-winged</b> <b>macaw</b> (Primolius maracana), blue-bellied parrot (Triclaria malachitacea), red-spectacled amazon (Amazona pretrei), purple-winged ground dove (Claravis geoffroyi), Temminck's seedeater (Sporophila falcirostris), Brazilian merganser (Mergus octosetaceus), grey-bellied hawk (Accipiter poliogaster), harpy eagle (Harpia harpyja) and canebrake groundcreeper (Clibanornis dendrocolaptoides).The park is an important site for conserving the black-fronted piping guan (Pipile jacutinga) in Argentina.|$|E
50|$|The varied {{relief and}} flora support a very diverse bird {{population}} and favour endemism.The white-banded mockingbird (Mimus triurus) {{passes through the}} reserve from June to August.409 species are known {{to occur in the}} reserve including the threatened hyacinth macaw (Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus), Chaco eagle (Buteogallus coronatus), red-necked aracari (Pteroglossus bitorquatus) and <b>blue-winged</b> <b>macaw</b> (Primolius maracana). There are 22 regionally endemic species including red-throated piping guan (Pipile cujubi), snow-capped manakin (Lepidothrix nattereri) and masked tanager (Tangara nigrocincta).Rare species include the Tapajós hermit (Phaethornis aethopygus), bald parrot (Pyrilia aurantiocephala) and the chorozinho-do-cachimbo, a recently discovered species of Herpsilochmus.|$|E
