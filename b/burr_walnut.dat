50|$|Jensen-Healey {{interiors}} {{started out}} comparatively austere and functional, with plastic centre consoles and all-black colour schemes. (Some earlier models do sport brown interiors, however.) In August 1973, aesthetic extras {{such as a}} clock, wood grain on the dashboard and glove-box and padding as well as air conditioning as an option were added. 1976 Jensen GT models went even further by offering an elaborate <b>burr</b> <b>walnut</b> wood dashboard and paisley-patterned cloth seats, with leather as an option.|$|E

50|$|Inside the Series III {{the changes}} were more evident. Rootes stylists {{completely}} redesigned the seats and interior panels and specified that they be trimmed in single colour vinyl with contrasting piping. For the first time, deep pile carpets were fitted as standard in the foot-wells (previous versions had rubber mats). The steering wheel, control knobs and switches were in black plastic instead of beige. The dashboard, instead of being, as in the earlier cars, padded metal and plastic, was covered in <b>burr</b> <b>walnut</b> veneer surmounted by a padded crash roll fitted with black-faced British Jaeger instruments.|$|E
5000|$|The 3-Litre {{was largely}} {{identical}} to the Pininfarina-designed Austin A99 Westminster and Wolseley 6/99 which used the same chassis and body. The Princess was given its own identity with a special Vanden Plas grille (fairly square, with a thick surround and vertical slats), round headlamps, and horn grilles on the front. The interior was lavish in typical Vanden Plas style, featuring <b>burr</b> <b>walnut</b> wood trim, leather seats and panels, and high-quality carpeting. A division between the driver and the rear compartment was an optional extra. Initially, it was powered by BMC's 3-litre C-Series engine, developing [...]|$|E

According to author and Cortina expert Graham Robson, the 1600E would be the first Cortina recognized as a classic.|$|E

50|$|Aug 1980: Introduction of the Maxi 2 {{range in}} 1750 L, 1750 HL and 1750 HLS variations. All models feature new {{revisions}} including new bumpers incorporating indicators (front) and reversing lights (rear), new side repeaters, full cover plastic wheel trims and broader side moulding inserts.

The HL gained intermittent screen wipe, velour seats, tinted glass and extra sound insulation. The HLS gained a <b>burr</b> <b>walnut</b> veneer dashboard. However, LHD export Maxi 2s were still referred to as 'Austin' Maxis in sales literature, only one version being available, the single carburettor HL, though unlike the UK spec cars it did not feature a radio as standard.|$|E
5000|$|When {{released}} {{the car had}} leather and walnut internal fittings and a hand-beaten aluminium skin. The Rio was advertised as:"Combining characteristics combined in no other single car [...] - [...] the very highest level of luxury, appointments and smooth quietness with superb handling, a 115 mi/h km/h maximum speed, 0-60 mph acceleration in 8.7 seconds, the opulence of Connolly Leather, deep pile carpeting and <b>burr</b> <b>walnut</b> in the finest limousine traditions with the fuel economy and manoeuvrability of a compact family saloon; Panther coachbuilt quality and safety engineering with total functionalism; hand-crafted exclusivity without ostentation." [...] The compact family saloon was offered in two forms: the 1850 cc version, which was the [...] "base" [...] model; and the 2.0 litre 16-valve version (using the engine from the Dolomite Sprint), called the Rio Especial. Problems for the Rio included {{the fact that the}} new thicker, fatter seats resulted in a more cramped interior than the Dolomite.|$|E
5000|$|The Dolomite changed {{very little}} (in all its variants) from the {{beginning}} to the very end, only minor trim differences and additional standard equipment being the main changes. 1979 saw the introduction of the Dolomite SE, of which 2163 were built. The bodyshell was of the basic 1500 (single headlamps) but the interior was fitted with luxury trim including <b>burr</b> <b>walnut</b> dashboard and door cappings (the dashboard was the same style as fitted to that of the Dolomite 1300), grey velour seats and matching carpet. All the cars were painted black with wide silver stripes running full length, with the letters [...] "SE" [...] {{at the end of the}} rear wing. The SE also sported a front spoiler and Spitfire style road wheels. By the late 1970s the Dolomite was looking increasingly old fashioned against newer competition, though still popular. Designer Giovanni Michelotti delivered a promising new design (Sprint based) and resembling a Fiat 132 [...] with a squared front and BMW style 'kink'. At least one full-size example was built. With severe problems at BLMC, management refused, there was simply not enough money. Production continued until August 1980 when BL closed the Canley Factory as part of a restructuring process which also resulted in the closure of the MG factory at Abingdon two months later.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "Blue Train" [...] is a Limited Edition {{version of}} the Bentley Mulsanne Speed created to {{celebrate}} the 1930 Bentley Speed Six coupe that famously outran the so-called “Blue Train” Calais-Mediterranée Express from Cannes to Calais, {{going so far as}} to return to London four minutes before the train reached the English Channel. A total of four Bentley Mulsanne Speed [...] "Blue Train" [...] models will be built, in celebration of the four-minute victory. Two of the cars were rendered in Beluga (solid black) and the other two cars were open to custom paint schemes. Other features specific to this model include 21-inch black wheels with polished centers, a chrome grille surround with a black square-mesh insert evocative of the original Blue Train, a Bentley Driver’s Club badge fixed to the grille, a retractable Flying 'B' engraved with the words “Blue Train 85 Years”, Burnt Oak and Camel leather, door stitch patterns that mimic the original car, sill plates and headrests showcasing the original car’s silhouette, and a rendering of the original car in the <b>burr</b> <b>walnut</b> passenger-side wood veneer. The first production unit featured a unique picnic set, trimmed with the same two-tone leathers as the interior of the car, containing Robbe & Berking silver cutlery, Haviland Limoges porcelain, Linley crystal champagne flutes, and an Angora picnic rug. The Mulliner team handcrafted the leather cutlery holders as well as the leather rug holder which featured [...] "Blue Train" [...] embroidery. The picnic set was offered as an option for the other three cars.|$|E
5000|$|In 1947, Austin {{produced}} two virtually identical chassis, {{one for the}} A110 (later A125 Sheerline, built entirely by Austin at their Longbridge factory) and the A120 (later A135) chassis used by Vanden Plas to produce the Princess at their Kingsbury works (North London). Although Vanden Plas was by now wholly owned by Austin {{and much of the}} running gear and instrumentation was the same in the two cars, the Princess was the Austin flagship, with a higher specification leather, wool and <b>burr</b> <b>walnut</b> interior.The original Princess was powered by a 3.5-litre straight six engine. This was enlarged to a 4.0-litre unit without further modifications. The Princess was often built to order. Customers could specify the colour required and a range of different setups were available. These included triple or single carburetors and twin or single exhaust systems. Whilst the sportier multiple carb version performed better, it tended to achieve only 12 to 14 mpg. The single carb however gave slightly better fuel consumption [...] Performance was very good for a car of its size, with a top speed of 90 mph and acceleration 0 to 60 mph of 20 seconds.In 1950, the Limousine version was introduced. The chassis length and passenger area were enlarged to enable a pair of drop down seats to be mounted on the rear of the front seats and a glass division was standard.All of these early cars are now extremely rare, especially the saloon versions. Many of the saloons were converted for use as taxis in the late 1950s, fitted with Perkins diesel engines to overcome economy issues. The 3993cc 6-cylinder engine was also fitted, as a petrol option seldom taken up, to the Austin and Morris normal-control (i.e. [...] "bonneted") WEK and WFK commercial vehicles.|$|E
