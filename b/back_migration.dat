Na-Dene languages are spoken by Native Alaskans and some people from the First Nations of Western Canada, in the Pacific Northwest, and also includes the Southern Athabaskan languages spoken in the American Southwest (e. g., the languages Apache and Navajo).

It remains a possibility that some or even most of these cases may be R1b* (R-M343*), R1a* (R-M420*), an otherwise undocumented branch of R1, and/or back-mutations of a marker, from a positive to a negative ancestral state, constituting, in other words, undocumented subclades of R1b.

50|$|Some geneticists and {{archaeologists have}} {{argued for a}} <b>back</b> <b>migration</b> of proto-Afroasiatic {{speakers}} from Western Asia to Africa {{as early as the}} 10th millennium BC. They suggest the Natufian culture might have spoken a proto-Afroasian language just prior to its disintegration into sub-languages. The hypothesis is supported by the Afroasiatic terms for early livestock and crops in both Anatolia and Iran. Recent Bayesian analysis identified an origin for Proto-Semitic language in the Levant around 7400 BC and for Semitic around 3800 BC, with a later single introduction from South Arabia into the Horn of Africa around 800 BC.|$|E

Fundamental studies have improved our understanding of the effects of temperature on DBM population dynamics and distributions and of interactions between DBM and its well-established parasitoid fauna.

50|$|Haplogroup N {{is derived}} from the ancestral L3 macrohaplogroup, which {{represents}} the migration discussed in the theory of the recent African origin of modern humans. Haplogroup N is the ancestral haplogroup to almost all clades today distributed in Europe and Oceania, as well as many found in Asia and the Americas. It is believed to have arisen at a similar time to haplogroup M. Haplogroup N subclades like haplogroup U6 are also found at moderate to low frequencies in the Northwest and Northeast Africa due to a <b>back</b> <b>migration</b> from the Near East around 27,000 years ago. U6 has been found among Iberomaurusian specimens in Taforalt.|$|E
50|$|The {{scenarios}} {{outlined by}} Hammer include an out of Africa migration over 100,000 years ago, the YAP+ insertion on an Asian Y-chromosome 55,000 {{years ago and}} a <b>back</b> <b>migration</b> of YAP+ from Asia to Africa 31,000 years ago by its subclade haplogroup E. This analysis {{was based on the}} fact that older African lineages, such as haplogroups A and B, were YAP negative whereas the younger lineage, haplogroup E was YAP positive. Haplogroup D, which is YAP positive, was clearly an Asian lineage, being found only in East Asia with high frequencies in Andaman Islands, Japan and Tibet. Because the mutations that define haplogroup E were observed to be in the ancestral state in haplogroup D, and haplogroup D at 55kya, was considerably older than haplogroup E at 31kya, Hammer concluded that haplogroup E was a subclade of haplogroup D.|$|E
50|$|The Semitic {{family is}} a member of the larger Afroasiatic family, all of whose other five or more {{branches}} have their origin in North Africa or the Maghreb. Largely for this reason, the ancestors of Proto-Semitic speakers were originally believed by some to have first arrived in the Middle East from North Africa, possibly as part of the operation of the Saharan pump, around the late Neolithic. Diakonoff sees Semitic originating between the Nile Delta and Canaan as the northernmost branch of Afroasiatic. Blench even wonders whether the highly divergent Gurage languages indicate an origin in Ethiopia (with the rest of Ethiopic Semitic a later <b>back</b> <b>migration).</b> Identification of the hypothetical proto-Semitic region of origin is therefore dependent on the larger geographic distributions of the other language families within Afroasiatic, whose origins are also hotly debated. According to Christy G. Turner II, there is an archaeological and physical anthropological reason for a relation between the modern Semitic-speaking populations of the Levant and the Natufian culture.|$|E

5000|$|The models {{supporting}} an African origin or an Asian {{origin of}} the YAP+ insertion both required the extinction of the ancestral YAP chromosome to explain the current distribution of the YAP+ polymorphism. Paragroup DE* possesses neither the mutations that define haplogroup D or haplogroup E. If paragroup DE* was found in one location but not the other, it would boost one theory of the other. [...] Haplogroup DE* has recently been found in Nigeria, Guinea-Bissau and also in Tibet. The phylogenetic relationship of three DE* sequences {{has yet to be}} determined, but it is known that the Guinea Bissau sequences differ from the Nigerian sequences by at least one mutation. Weale et al. state that the discovery of DE* among Nigerians pushes back the date for the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of African YAP chromosomes. This, in his view, has the effect of reducing the time window through which a possible <b>back</b> <b>migration</b> from Asia to Africa could occur.|$|E
50|$|Early {{research}} into the origins of R1b focused on Europe. In 2000, Ornella Semino and colleagues argued that R1b had been in Europe {{before the end of}} the Ice Age, and had spread north from an Iberian refuge after the Last Glacial Maximum. Age estimates of R1b in Europe have steadily decreased in more recent studies, at least concerning the majority of R1b, with more recent studies suggesting a Neolithic age or younger. On the other hand, Morelli et al. have recently (in 2010) attempted to defend a Palaeolithic origin for R1b1b2. Irrespective of microsatellite coalescence calculations, Chikhi et al. pointed out that the timing of molecular divergences does not coincide with population splits; the TMRCA of haplogroup R1b (whether in the Palaeolithic or Neolithic) dates to its point of origin somewhere in Eurasia, and not its arrival in western Europe. Summing up, Michael R. Maglio argues that the closest branch of R1b is from Iberia and its small subclades found in West Asia, the Near East and Africa are examples of <b>back</b> <b>migration,</b> and not of its origin.|$|E

In 2015, linguist Paul Kiparsky endorsed Dené-Yeniseian, saying that [...] "the morphological parallelism and phonological similarities among corresponding affixes is most suggestive, but most compelling evidence for actual relationship comes from those sound correspondences which can be accounted for by independently motivated regular sound changes".|$|E

40|$|As {{the number}} of nodes in {{high-performance}} computing environments keeps increasing, faults are becoming common place. Reactive fault tolerance (FT) often does not scale due to massive I/O requirements and relies on manual job resubmission. This work complements reactive with proactive FT at the process level. Through health monitoring, a subset of node failures can be anticipated when one’s health deteriorates. A novel process-level live migration mechanism supports continued execution of applications during much of processes migration. This scheme is integrated into an MPI execution environment to transparently sustain health-inflicted node failures, which eradicates the need to restart and requeue MPI jobs. Experiments indicate that 1 - 6. 5 seconds of prior warning are required to successfully trigger live process migration while similar operating system virtualization mechanisms require 13 - 24 seconds. This self-healing approach complements reactive FT by nearly cutting {{the number of}} checkpoints in half when 70 % of the faults are handled proactively.

The objective of our study was to learn these issues by studying the genetic origins of H. pylori in Sudan and their comparison to global isolates. We used multilocus sequence typing (MLST) of 7 housekeeping genes (atpA, efp, ureI, ppa, mutY, trpC, yphC). We de ned a new population, hspEastAfrica, which predominates in all Sudanese strains, irrespective of geographic or ethnic origin. Our observations suggest the origin of ancestral H. pylori (hsp-Europe) in the Sudan, which is in agreement with an out of Africa <b>migration.</b> Despite several <b>back</b> <b>migrations</b> to Sudan, the hspEastAfrica remained dominant while other ancestral population only contributed minimally.
