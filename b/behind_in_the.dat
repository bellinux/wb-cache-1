5|$|In {{the fifth}} stage, nails {{on the road}} again causing punctures. As {{mechanical}} assistance was not allowed, Cornet had to ride the last 40km on two flat tires. Aucouturier won this stage, his third one, but was way <b>behind</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> general classification, which Garin lead, with only 28 seconds margin to Pothier.|$|E
5|$|The Cambrian {{explosion}} {{took place}} around 540 to 520 {{million years ago}} (Mya). In this geologically brief period, all the major animal phyla diverged and these included the first creatures with mineralized skeletons. Brachiopods and bivalves made their appearance at this time, and left their fossilized remains <b>behind</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rocks.|$|E
50|$|In June, Moon Madness {{finished}} third <b>behind</b> Triptych <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Coronation Cup at Epsom and third again <b>behind</b> Almaarad <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Hardwicke Stakes at Royal Ascot. He finished {{last of the}} ten runners <b>behind</b> Mtoto <b>in</b> <b>the</b> King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes, and was sixth <b>behind</b> Top Class <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Geoffrey Freer Stakes.|$|R
50|$|A half forward, Hendrie {{was a good}} {{mark and}} had a {{sweeping}} left foot kick. Hendrie kicked 2 goals 8 <b>behinds</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1976 Grand Final.|$|R

5|$|Artanis is {{the central}} {{character}} of , {{the third and final}} part of StarCraft II. He leads the Protoss to invade Aiur but as the invasion went on, many Protoss fell under Amon's control. Amon has seized the Khala and is controlling the Protoss via their nerve cords. Artanis initially fell under their control but Zeratul severed his nerve cord, dying in the process. Shortly afterwards, Artanis leaves Aiur <b>behind</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ship Spear of Adun and begins his quest to destroy Amon.|$|E
5|$|As the 1880s progressed, Cope's and Marsh's men faced stiff {{competition}} {{from each other}} and from third parties interested in bones. Professor Alexander Emanuel Agassiz of Harvard sent his own representatives west, while Carlin and Frank Williston formed a bone company to sell fossils to the highest bidder. Reed left and became a sheep herder in 1884, and Marsh's Como quarries yielded little after his departure. Despite these setbacks, Marsh had more operational quarries than Cope at this point of time; Cope, who at the early 1880s had more bones than he could fit in a single house, had fallen <b>behind</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> race for dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|Coulthard's victory {{allowed him}} to narrow the lead of Michael Schumacher in the World Drivers' Championship to 12 points. Häkkinen {{retained}} third with Barrichello a further seven points <b>behind.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> World Constructors' Championship, Ferrari retained their lead which was reduced to five points over McLaren. Fisichella's strong result reduced the gap to Benetton's rivals Williams to one point, with ten races of the season remaining.|$|E
50|$|Blue Canari ran {{four times}} as a four-year-old. He {{finished}} seventh <b>behind</b> Bago <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Prix Ganay, sixth <b>behind</b> Geordieland <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Grand Prix de Chantilly, and fourth <b>behind</b> Ostankino <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Prix Maurice de Nieuil. On his final appearance of the year, he was moved up in distance and finished fourth to Reefcape <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 3100 metre Prix Gladiateur at Longchamp in September.|$|R
50|$|Hamas ran {{poorly on}} his two {{subsequent}} starts, finishing last on both occasions. He finished seventh <b>behind</b> Wolfhound <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Haydock Sprint Cup in September, and ninth <b>behind</b> Catrail <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Diadem Stakes at Ascot in October.|$|R
50|$|The rest of Art Connoisseur's racing {{career was}} a {{complete}} disappointment: in four races he failed to finish <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first ten and never finished within nine lengths of the winner. He finished twelfth of thirteen <b>behind</b> Fleeting Spirit <b>in</b> <b>the</b> July Cup, fifteenth <b>behind</b> Borderlescott <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Nunthorpe Stakes (when his saddle slipped) and twelfth <b>behind</b> Regal Parade <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Haydock Sprint Cup.

5|$|Despite {{their strong}} first half {{up to that}} point, Bolton went a goal <b>behind</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 37th minute. Liverpool midfielder Steve McManaman {{received}} the ball from John Barnes, he ran past Bolton defender Alan Stubbs, then past Scott Green. His subsequent shot was not powerful, but Bolton goalkeeper Keith Branagan could not stop the ball from going into the goal, giving Liverpool a 1–0 lead.|$|E
5|$|Expansion of Highbury was {{restricted}} because the East Stand had been {{designated as a}} Grade II listed building {{and the other three}} stands were close to residential properties. These limitations prevented the club from maximising matchday revenue during the 1990s and first decade of the 21st century, putting them in danger of being left <b>behind</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> football boom of that time.|$|E
5|$|Following this, {{the first}} {{race of the}} season, Vandoorne led the Drivers' Championship with 43 points, ten ahead of second-placed Haryanto. Rossi was in third on 23 points, with Berthon in fourth. King rounded out the top five with 12 points. ART Grand Prix assumed {{the lead of the}} Teams' Championship with 50 points; Racing Engineering and Campos Racing were close <b>behind</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> battle for second place with 35 and 33 points. Lazarus was fourth on 16 points, four in front of Rapax in fifth place, with ten races left in the season.|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} year he kicked 152 goals, {{which was an}} Australian record until 1953, when Bernie Naylor, from the South Fremantle Football Club kicked 167 goals (including finals matches). <b>In</b> <b>the</b> 1934 season George kicked 19 goals, 3 <b>behinds</b> <b>in</b> one match (then an Australian record) followed by 13 goals, 4 <b>behinds</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> following match.|$|R
50|$|Her {{last two}} starts were disappointing, despite {{returning}} to the minimum distance of five furlongs. She ran unplaced <b>behind</b> Elbio <b>in</b> <b>the</b> King's Stand Stakes at Royal Ascot and then finished last of the eleven starters <b>behind</b> Lochsong <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Nunthorpe.|$|R
50|$|Circus Plume {{stayed in}} {{training}} in 1985, {{but failed to}} add to her reputation in two starts. She was unplaced <b>behind</b> Kirmann <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Jockey Club Stakes at Newmarket in May and fourth <b>behind</b> Shernazar <b>in</b> <b>the</b> September Stakes at Kempton Park Racecourse.|$|R
5|$|For these {{long-range}} desert operations, it {{was necessary}} for all supplies to be well-organised and suitably packaged for transportation on camels, moving with the column or following closely behind. It was vital that the soldiers were well trained for these conditions. If a man was left <b>behind</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> inhospitable Sinai, he might die in the burning desert sun during the day, or bitter cold at night. If a water bottle was accidentally tipped up or leaked, it could mean no water for its owner, for perhaps 24 hours in extreme temperatures.|$|E
5|$|In previews, {{publications}} such as IGN and GameSpot {{noted that}} the graphics had been improved, {{and that there were}} many new characters and locations. The new minigames were previewed, and IGN pointed out that they offered enough complexity to back up the simple gameplay. In an interview with GameSpot, Ted Price stated that the emphasis for the title was on the new critters, but that Spyro would not be left <b>behind</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> story. Year of the Dragon also implemented crack protection, in addition to the copy protection previous games had contained. This helped prevent hackers from cracking the game until two months after release.|$|E
5|$|Internet {{censorship}} in Hong Kong operates {{under different}} principles and regulations {{from those of}} mainland China. In November 2015, the newly established Innovation and Technology Bureau pushed for the legislation of the Copyright (Amendment) Bill 2014, more popularly known as the Internet Article 23, which would severely limit the legality of derivative works and other activities previously permitted on the Internet. Supporters of the bill {{point to the fact}} that Hong Kong is lagging <b>behind</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> protection of intellectual property rights, but detractors state that creative work on the Internet should be exempt from legislation, and the ordinance would severely violate human rights.|$|E
50|$|Tobougg {{failed to}} live up to his trainer's {{prediction}} in four starts in 2002. He finished last of the fifteen runners <b>behind</b> Nayef <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Dubai Sheema Classic, and on his return to Europe, ran fifth <b>behind</b> Rebellline <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Tattersalls Gold Cup.|$|R
50|$|Essendon won comfortably despite {{trailing}} at half time. A {{tally of}} 11 goals and 8 <b>behinds</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> third quarter by Essendon took the game away from Melbourne. This remains the best third quarter score by {{any team in}} a VFL/AFL Grand Final.|$|R
50|$|Bint Pasha {{remained}} in {{training as a}} four-year-old but failed to win in three races. She finished last of four <b>behind</b> Triptych <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Coronation Cup and eighth of ten <b>behind</b> Village Star <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud. On her final appearance she finished fourth of the seven runners <b>behind</b> Ela Romara <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Nassau Stakes at Goodwood on 30 July.|$|R
5|$|Isolated {{inside the}} Tower, the royal {{government}} {{was in a}} state of shock at the turn of events. The King left the castle that morning and made his way to negotiate with the rebels at Mile End in east London, taking only a very small bodyguard with him. The King left Sudbury and Hales <b>behind</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Tower, either for their own safety or because Richard had decided it would be safer to distance himself from his unpopular ministers. Along the way, several Londoners accosted the King to complain about alleged injustices.|$|E
5|$|S. A. Andrée's Arctic balloon {{expedition}} of 1897 was {{an effort}} to reach the North Pole in which all three expedition members perished. S.A.Andrée (1854–97), the first Swedish balloonist, proposed a voyage by hydrogen balloon from Svalbard to either Russia or Canada, which was to pass, with luck, straight over the North Pole on the way. The scheme was received with patriotic enthusiasm in Sweden, a northern nation that had fallen <b>behind</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> race for the North Pole.|$|E
5|$|The Eagles {{opened the}} season by {{traveling}} to Kent State, whom the Eagles defeated, 21–0. The Eagles' home opener was their second {{game of the season}} and was also their first conference game of the year. Against Georgia Tech, the Eagles eked out a 9–7 halftime lead, but fell <b>behind</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second half, eventually losing, 19–16, on a Georgia Tech touchdown that came with 8:26 remaining in the game. Despite the loss, the Eagles recovered quickly, beating Central Florida, 34–7, two weeks after the Georgia Tech game. The victory was the first in an eventual four-game win streak that culminated with a 28–23 defeat of then-No. 17 Virginia Tech.|$|E
50|$|Scenic {{began his}} third season <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Earl of Sefton Stakes at Newmerket on 18 April and {{finished}} {{fourth of the}} ten runners <b>behind</b> Terimon. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> Brigadier Gerard Stakes at Sandown Park Racecourse on 29 May Scenic finished second <b>behind</b> Husyan. <b>In</b> June at Royal Ascot, Scenic contested his final race and finished last of the eight runners <b>behind</b> Batshoof <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Prince of Wales's Stakes.|$|R
50|$|Magnificent Star {{remained}} in {{training as a}} four-year-old but was badly affected by a viral infection early <b>in</b> <b>the</b> year and did not race until August. The filly failed to recover her best form and made little impact in three starts. She finished seventh <b>behind</b> Magic Night <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Prix de Pomone, last of eight <b>behind</b> User Friendly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Yorkshire Oaks and ninth <b>behind</b> Niodini <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Park Hill Stakes.|$|R

5|$|The {{motion of}} the fluid is {{sustained}} by convection, motion driven by buoyancy. The temperature increases towards {{the center of the}} Earth, and the higher temperature of the fluid lower down makes it buoyant. This buoyancy is enhanced by chemical separation: As the core cools, some of the molten iron solidifies and is plated to the inner core. In the process, lighter elements are left <b>behind</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fluid, making it lighter. This is called compositional convection. A Coriolis effect, caused by the overall planetary rotation, tends to organize the flow into rolls aligned along the north-south polar axis.|$|E
5|$|Van Kempen is a {{supervisor}} at a tea plantation named Ciranu in West Java. He keeps a mistress, or njai, named Siti. Together {{they have two}} children, Adolf and Annie. One day, van Kempen returns to the Netherlands, leaving Siti and their young mixed-race children <b>behind.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> Netherlands he marries a young widow and takes her daughter, Ervine, as his step-daughter. Siti, meanwhile, lives with her uncle in a hut in the forest and prays fervently for van Kempen's return, even asking for help from the local shaman (dukun).|$|E
5|$|When Vardanes II of Parthia {{rebelled against}} his father Vologeses I in 55AD, Vologeses withdrew his forces from Armenia. Rome quickly {{attempted}} {{to fill the}} political vacuum left <b>behind.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> Roman–Parthian War of 58–63AD, the commander Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo achieved some military successes against the Parthians while installing Tigranes VI of Armenia as a Roman client. However, Corbulo's successor Lucius Caesennius Paetus was soundly defeated by Parthian forces and fled Armenia. Following a peace treaty, Tiridates I traveled to Naples and Rome in 63 AD. At both sites the Roman emperor Nero (r.54–68AD) ceremoniously crowned him king of Armenia by placing the royal diadem on his head.|$|E
