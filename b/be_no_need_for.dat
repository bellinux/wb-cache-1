5|$|In 1919, local {{politicians}} {{proposed that the}} line be built administratively {{as part of the}} Jæren Line, but this was rejected by the government. Instead, the ministry wanted to again consider the Ålgård Line as part of the Sørlandet Line, and proposed that the Ålgård Line be built with standard gauge—which would be used for the Sørlandet Line—instead of the narrow gauge used by the Jæren Line. However, there would <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> standard gauge until the Sørlandet Line was extended to Rogaland, so the line was planned to be built with narrow gauge track, but all other installations would be prepared for standard gauge.|$|E
5|$|Historians have {{disagreed}} {{about its}} age, {{and the existence}} of an older church on the same site. The tower has been dated by its architecture to between 1230 and 1240, but other historians question this date and suggest the tower and the body of the church both date to the 14thcentury. The porch appears to be a 17thcentury addition. There is a tomb of Margaret deCamois in the nave. It has been suggested that its location there, rather than the chancel as would be expected for the family of the lord of the manor (which her surname suggests she was), may indicate that the church was built on the site of an earlier, smaller, church and the tomb was in the chancel of that church. Local historian Roger Chatterton-Newman disagrees, saying there would <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> a church on the site any earlier.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{plans for}} the station were for access to be from Monmouth Road, which runs {{parallel}} to the railway, north of the line. There {{was to be a}} fully accessible footbridge across the line, with both ramp and stairs, as well as a pedestrian crossing across Monmouth Road and a lit 50-space car park on the old goods yard at the eastern end of Monmouth Road. The very end of the goods yard would be maintained for Network Rail access. These plans were changed following an agreement to acquire a property on Station Road. The new plans have the entrance to be on Station Road, at the east end of the site, meaning there would <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> a footbridge. There would be disabled parking and a pick up/drop off point adjacent to the entrance, although the exact design of this area is still under consideration. Noise mitigation options are to be investigated and there will be improvements to local footpaths. The line is due to reopen in 2020.|$|E

25|$|Most {{denominations}} make {{no effort}} {{at all to}} maintain a national membership database and must rely on local churches or surveys of the general population. Local church membership rolls are often maintained poorly because there may <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> an official membership list (Bahá'ís at least must maintain accurate voting lists) and local congregations sometimes do not provide their denomination's membership data even when asked.|$|E

However, by the end of 2012, a number of states had enacted same-sex marriage both through the actions of their state legislatures (Vermont, New Hampshire, New York), and through popular vote (Maine, Maryland, Washington).|$|E
25|$|Housing First is an {{initiative}} to help homeless people reintegrate into society, {{and out of}} homeless shelters. It was initiated by the federal government's Interagency Council on Homelessness. It asks cities {{to come up with}} a plan to end chronic homelessness. In this direction, there is the belief that if homeless people are given independent housing to start, with some proper social supports, then there would <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> emergency homeless shelters, which it considers a good outcome. However this is a controversial position.|$|E

By controlling their productive life, he believes that individuals can gain job satisfaction, a sense of fulfillment, and purpose to their work. He argues that unpleasant and unpopular jobs could be fully automated, carried out by workers who are specially remunerated, or shared among everyone.|$|E
25|$|The Ålgård Line was {{originally}} launched {{as an alternative}} route for the Sørlandet Line. In 1910, a committee was appointed to conduct preliminary planning. Although NSB's board supported the line, construction was placed on hold. In 1919, local politicians proposed that the line be built administratively {{as part of the}} Jæren Line, but this was rejected by the government. Instead, the ministry wanted to again consider the Ålgård Line as part of the Sørlandet Line, and proposed that the Ålgård Line be built with standard gauge—which would be used for the Sørlandet Line—instead of the narrow gauge used by the Jæren Line. However, there would <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> standard gauge until the Sørlandet Line was extended to Rogaland, so the line was planned to be built with narrow gauge track, but all other installations would be prepared for standard gauge. The first train to operate on the line went from Stavanger on 20 December 1924, and the Ålgård Line became the last state-owned railway in Norway to be opened with narrow gauge. Not until 1930 was a branch built from the railway station in Sandnes to the port.|$|E
25|$|EVA 1 {{started with}} astronauts Dave Wolf and Tim Kopra {{switching}} their spacesuit power to internal battery at 16:19 UTC. Despite a communication {{problem with the}} spacewalkers, the Japanese Exposed Facility was successfully installed on the Japanese Experiment Module {{by means of a}} complex series of steps involving the robotic arms of both the station and the shuttle. The JEF was first unberthed from the shuttle payload bay by the station arm, after which the shuttle arm took the load. The station arm was then moved to the worksite on Node-2 (Harmony), wherefrom it took the 4.1 ton facility back. The facility was then successfully latched on to the Experiment Module. As part of the EVA, the spacewalkers successfully deployed the port Unpressurized Cargo Carrier Attach System (UCCAS), which could not be deployed during STS-119. During the prior mission, the deployment failed due to a jamming caused by a stuck detent pin. Engineers designed a custom tool to force the pin to release, which was used to deploy the mechanism. Meanwhile, the shuttle managers announced that there would <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> a focused inspection of the heat shield. The nose cap and wing leading-edge panels of the shuttle were cleared for entry as they were, but a reentry clearance was not given. Beyond one impact site having a gouge, the rest of the impacts were found to be mostly a loss of coating. The other activity scheduled for EVA 1, the deployment of a starboard side cargo carrier, was postponed for want of time. A fuel cell issue found before launch was analyzed, though the cell continued to function as expected with no impact to the mission.|$|E

500|$|Because the Atlas {{was flying}} on a {{slightly}} lofted trajectory, the booster engines cut off 2seconds earlier than planned, but the sustainer engine burned for about 10seconds longer than intended, giving an extra [...] of velocity {{and putting the}} spacecraft in a slightly higher orbit than planned. Initial analysis of the trajectory confirmed that the capsule could remain in a stable orbit for at least seven orbits, ensuring there would <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> an early de-orbit.|$|E
500|$|Folk {{psychology}} retains {{characteristics of}} now obsolete theories or legends from the past.

Today, eliminativists argue, {{there is no reason}} not to accept an effective scientific account of people's cognitive abilities. If such an explanation existed, then there would <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> folk-psychological explanations of behavior, and the latter would be eliminated {{the same way as the}} mythological explanations the ancients used.|$|E
500|$|In a 2010 lecture to {{students}} of the Singapore Management University School of Law, Chief Justice Chan Sek Keong briefly discussed the decision in Stansfield. He pointed out that Justice Khoo's statements on Anisminic were obiter dicta because the decision had been [...] "based on a breach of natural justice and not the doctrine of error of law". He also considered an academic argument that an ouster clause may be inconsistent with Article 93 of the Singapore Constitution which vests the judicial power of Singapore in the courts. Chief Justice Chan stated that if this proposition was answered in the affirmative, it would follow that the supervisory jurisdiction of the courts cannot be ousted, and there would thus <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> Singapore courts to draw the distinction between jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional errors of law. Nevertheless, he highlighted {{the fact that he}} was not expressing an opinion on the issue.|$|E

A week after Will's writing appeared in a column, Reagan praised Springsteen in a stump speech given in Hammonton, New Jersey. Soon after Reagan's speech, Springsteen expressed discontent with the president and his policies, and [...] "Born in the U.S.A." [...] was dropped from the campaign. Reagan's team then reached out to John Cougar Mellancamp to use his song [...] "Pink Houses" [...] and were turned down. The campaign then adopted [...] "God Bless the U.S.A." [...] by country singer Lee Greenwood. Greenwood played the song for the Second inauguration of Ronald Reagan and at the inaugurations of the next three Republican presidents.|$|E
