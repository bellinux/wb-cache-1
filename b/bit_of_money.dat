5|$|In the 1970s, {{the hotel}} {{fell into a}} {{turbulent}} period. Terrorist threats from the Irish Republican Army became the chief concern, and bomb scares were not uncommon. The oil crisis in the early 1970s directly affected business and prompted the Bracewell-Smith family to sell their stake to Trafalgar House on 5 April 1976 for £2.75m. At {{the time of the}} sale, the hotel's occupancy rate was just 45 percent; the Ritz Grill Room had been closed and it had lost quite a <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> in recent times. In 1984, the Ritz brought back its weekly Sunday tea dances which were popular during the 1920s and 1930s. Because of demand, the hotel considered restricting afternoon tea at the Ritz to hotel guests only, as those staying at the Ritz were often unable to get a table. Many Londoners who would have been barred by this restriction voiced disapproval and the Ritz compromised by requiring reservations for afternoon tea at the hotel. Proper attire for tea is a must; the Ritz once refused to admit Mick Jagger for tea because he was not wearing a jacket and tie.|$|E

Additionally, he reportedly once accepted over $160,000 to fly a wanted felon out of the country.|$|E

Pickard said, about {{the beginning of this}} storyline, [...] "Cindy is with Darren and she's realised I’ve got a <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>money.</b> They’re scamming me!" [...] Darren and Cindy begin sleeping together and are caught by Tony but do not continue to see each other. Cindy and Tony divorce; Cindy begins a relationship with Alistair Longford (Terence Harvey) and agrees to marry him. Darren proposes to Cindy on the day of her wedding but she declines stating she wants to give Holly a better life and more financial security which Alistair can give her.|$|E
500|$|The {{work was}} carried out in twelve-hour shifts, with a day shift under Zinn and a night shift under Anderson. For a work force they hired thirty high school {{dropouts}} that were eager to earn a <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> before being drafted into the Army.

Here they met the captain of an English man-of-war, fell in talk with him, went on board his ship, and, in short, had so agreeable a time that day was breaking when we came alongside the HISPANIOLA.|$|R

His black 1957/63 (the body {{is from a}} '63; the neck from a '57) Stratocaster, {{previously}} owned by late Free guitarist Paul Kossoff, was used circa 1978–1990.

40|$|In {{this new}} {{long-lasting}} period of crisis, public investments in general, and {{particularly those in}} support of innovation and economic development at regional level, are depressed by stability policies. The shortage of resources for any type of expansive policy poses regional decision makers straight questions to be answered: which has the primacy among the objectives of cohesion and growth? How to achieve more with less resource? New smarter forms of policymaking to support innovation and economic development are then needed. This {{can be achieved by}} going beyond the simplistic idea that distributing small <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> to SMEs is in any case good support to industries. On the contrary, the focus of support policy has to be narrowed on targets in the perspective of a `selective investment of public resources'. Policies in support of company creation may offer a good example of this. entrepreneurship; innovation; knowledge-based economy; regional development; smart specialization...|$|R

I didn't {{really know what to}} do, so I hung on for a while, and then, since I'd managed to keep a <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>money,</b> I decided to go to Paris." [...] Bacon then spent the next year and a half in Paris. He met Yvonne Bocquentin, pianist and connoisseur, at the opening of an exhibition. Aware of his own need to learn French, Bacon lived for three months with Madame Bocquentin and her family at their house near Chantilly. He travelled into Paris to visit the city's art galleries. At the Château de Chantilly (Musée Condé) he saw Nicolas Poussin's Massacre of the Innocents, a painting which he often referred to in his own later work. From Chantilly, he went to an exhibition that inspired him to take up painting.|$|E
