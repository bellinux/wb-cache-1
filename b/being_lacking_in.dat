Dennis had received threats from his enemies and almost every competitor in the business wanted him dead. Therefore, he moved around with no less than 20 heavily armed bodyguards who carried bags packed with submachine guns and grenades, and who communicated with each other with walkie-talkies. He had also tightened security with surveillance cameras on the streets where the Ah Kong casino was located.|$|E

40|$|Objective To survey medical {{graduates}} from the University of Hong Kong {{on how well}} they perceived their learning needs had been fulfilled by the old (before 1997) and the new (after 1997) curricula. Design Retrospective questionnaire survey. Setting The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong. Participants Medical {{graduates from}} the University of Hong Kong who graduated between 1997 and 2006 were invited to complete a questionnaire online or in paper form; 1997 - 2001 graduates were trained under the old curriculum, and 2002 - 2006 graduates under the new curriculum. Results The response rate was 23 %. Thesurvey showed thatthe graduates of both curricula felt that research skills, population health, and ophthalmology were not emphasised enough in the medical programme. In addition, some graduates of the old curriculum mentioned interpersonal skills, ethics and professionalism, and language skills, which were pinpointed in the curriculum reform in 1997. Some graduates of the new curriculum mentioned anatomy, microbiology, and diagnostic radiology. Graduates of both {{the old and the}} new curricula perceived the same top five areas as <b>being</b> <b>lacking</b> <b>in</b> their respective curricula, in relationship to their clinical career and personal growth, namely: business administration, law, professional English, life coaching, and humanities. A small percentage of graduates also took courses in these areas after graduation. Conclusions The survey showed that the curriculum reform in 1997 at the University of Hong Kong had correctly pinpointed some of the learning needs. The survey also identified educational needs in the existing curriculum that need to be dealt with in the forthcoming curriculum reform in 2012. published_or_final_versio...|$|E
40|$|The {{need for}} {{accurate}} material models {{to simulate the}} deformation, damage and failure of polymer matrix composites under impact conditions is becoming critical as these materials are gaining increased usage in the aerospace and automotive industries. While there are several composite material models currently available within commercial transient dynamic finite element codes, several features {{have been identified as}} <b>being</b> <b>lacking</b> <b>in</b> the currently available material models that could substantially enhance the predictive capability of the impact simulations. A specific desired feature pertains to the incorporation of both plasticity and damage within the material model. Another desired feature relates to using experimentally based tabulated stress-strain input to define the evolution of plasticity and damage as opposed to specifying discrete input properties (such as modulus and strength) and employing analytical functions to track the response of the material. To begin to address these needs, a combined plasticity and damage model suitable for use with both solid and shell elements is being developed for implementation within the commercial code LS-DYNA. The plasticity model is based on extending the Tsai-Wu composite failure model into a strain-hardening based orthotropic plasticity model with a non-associative flow rule. The evolution of the yield surface is determined based on tabulated stress-strain curves in the various normal and shear directions and is tracked using the effective plastic strain. The effective plastic strain is computed by using the non-associative flow rule in combination with appropriate numerical methods. To compute the evolution of damage, a strain equivalent semi-coupled formulation is used, in which a load in one direction results in a stiffness reduction in multiple coordinate directions. A specific laminated composite is examined to demonstrate the process of characterizing and analyzing the response of a composite using the developed model...|$|E
40|$|The {{changing}} Information Security (IS) {{landscape and}} increased legal, regulatory and audit compliance requirements have driven organisations to collect, maintain, securely store and regularly analyse application, system and network event logs. For some organisations, collecting and storing event logs is primarily to satisfy national or industry specific compliance requirements and secondarily for event based information security monitoring. For other organisations, the collection, storage {{and analysis of}} event logs is to add an additional dimension to the increasingly multidimensional approach to information security. Monitoring the security of networks through the collection, filtering, aggregation, normalisation, correlation and analysis of archived or real-time event logs has indeed increasingly {{become one of the}} core activities in the day to day operations of information security professionals. While event logs have in the past been primarily used for monitoring the health and operational status of networks, from purely a system and network administration perspective, they are today considered a critical source of deriving important information on the overall security status of applications, systems, networks, data and information. From a security perspective these event logs are mined or analysed to identify potential or real security threats, breaches, anomalies or any other suspicious behaviour. Beyond their storage, the presentation of event messages has also become important in order to enable timely response to any anomalies within the network, improve decision making and assist in the restoration of a network to normal operation after security breach. Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) technology have in the recent decade seen an increase in adoption by organisations responding to a rapidly evolving information security landscape spurred by the complexity of information security threats currently being observed. Threats that today are in some instances appropriately name Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs). The need to equip information security professionals with a level of ease in proactively identifying security threats or reactively in forensic analysis post a security breach also stand as some of the enablers for SIEM adoption. Regulatory compliance has perhaps been the most significant driver for the adoption of SIEM by organisations. SIEM capability includes collection, filtering, aggregation, normalisation and correlation of events messages, collected {{from a wide range of}} systems, network devices and applications. These capabilities represent a significant enhancement from the basic event log collection and storage of Log Management technologies from which SIEM was an outgrowth. Log management technologies have traditionally <b>being</b> <b>lacking</b> <b>in</b> similar capabilities to SIEM, and as mentioned mostly capable of basic collection and storage of event logs. This research investigated the applicability of SIEM technology within the context of IT Security, essentially researching into the role and significance thereof if any that SIEM might have in IT security. Specifically the research sought to answer the questions of whether SIEM technology enhanced the ability to monitor and respond to application, system and network security events as in an environment comprising a high volume of security, network and device system logs...|$|E
