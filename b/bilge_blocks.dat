25|$|Loading a {{submarine}} was a lengthy process that took weeks. The {{first step was}} to pump the forward ballast tanks empty which elevated the bow out of the water. Once it was dismantled, the ballast tanks were then filled to lower the bow and flood the well deck to allow the submarine to be winched aboard. The well deck's water-tight doors were then closed and the water in the dock was pumped overboard while the submarine settled onto its wooden <b>bilge</b> <b>blocks.</b> The bow was then reassembled and hatch covers were installed over the well deck. These prevented the ship from taking on water during a storm and allowed the crew to perform any necessary maintenance on the submarine while under way.|$|E
5000|$|The keel blocks {{as well as}} the <b>bilge</b> <b>block</b> {{are placed}} {{on the floor of the}} dock in {{accordance}} with the [...] "docking plan" [...] of the ship. Routine use of dry docks is for the [...] "graving" [...] i.e. the cleaning, removal of barnacles and rust, and re-painting of ships' hulls.|$|R
5000|$|The Dartmouth Marine Slips {{were opened}} as the Chebucto Marine Railway in 1859 under the {{supervision}} of an American engineer, H.I. Crandall. His plans to use <b>bilge</b> and keel <b>blocks</b> to operate in conjunction with the current marine railway to haul ships {{in and out of the}} water was genius.|$|R
50|$|The ocean voyage between Newburyport and Mystic Seaport {{was almost}} {{the demise of the}} Sabino. She hit large waves on the trip which stirred up all the dormant coal from the <b>bilge</b> and <b>blocked</b> the onboard <b>bilge</b> pumps, causing the engine room to fill with water. Luckily, there was a large {{gasoline-powered}} pump on board that was used to keep her afloat. She limped into Groton to be immediately pulled from the water. The Mystic Seaport shipyard experts recalked her bottom, and she became a popular attraction, prompting the museum to purchase her. Under the museum's care, Sabino received a complete make over and was brought back to her former glory. In 1992, she was designated a National Historic Landmark.|$|R
