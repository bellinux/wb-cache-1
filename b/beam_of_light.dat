5|$|Electron {{microscopy}} {{offers a}} higher resolution image. In an electron microscope, {{a beam of}} focused electrons interacts with the sample rather than a <b>beam</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> as in traditional microscopy. In conjunction with rapid freezing techniques, electron microscopy has also been used to study the mechanisms of inter- and intracellular transport, for instance in demonstrating that exocytotic vesicles are the means of chemical release at synapses.|$|E

5|$|Interferometry {{is another}} method {{to find the}} {{wavelength}} of electromagnetic radiation for determining the speed of light. A coherent <b>beam</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> (e.g. from a laser), with a known frequency (f), is split to follow two paths and then recombined. By adjusting the path length while observing the interference pattern and carefully measuring the change in path length, the wavelength of the light (λ) can be determined. The speed of light is then calculated using the equationc=λf.|$|E
5|$|If a bound {{electron}} {{is in an}} excited state, an interacting photon with the proper energy can cause stimulated emission of a photon with a matching energy level. For this to occur, the electron must drop to a lower energy state that has an energy difference matching {{the energy of the}} interacting photon. The emitted photon and the interacting photon then move off in parallel and with matching phases. That is, the wave patterns of the two photons are synchronized. This physical property is used to make lasers, which can emit a coherent <b>beam</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> energy in a narrow frequency band.|$|E
5|$|They {{designed}} and built the telemetry modules {{in their homes and}} garages but they were only able to sell a few hundred units. Mims had sold a feature article about the new solid-state device, light-emitting diodes, to Popular Electronics (circulation 400,000) that May. With the hope of selling kits to the larger readership; Roberts and Mims designed a device that would transmit voice over a <b>beam</b> <b>of</b> <b>light,</b> the Opticom. The editors accepted the project story and both articles were featured {{on the cover of the}} November 1970 issue. The payment for the articles was $400 but meeting Les Solomon, Popular Electronics technical editor, proved to be significant to both Mims and Roberts future success.|$|E

5|$|A {{new method}} to study lipid bilayers is Atomic force {{microscopy}} (AFM). Rather than using a <b>beam</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> or particles, {{a very small}} sharpened tip scans the surface by making physical contact with the bilayer and moving across it, like a record player needle. AFM is a promising technique because {{it has the potential}} to image with nanometer resolution at room temperature and even under water or physiological buffer, conditions necessary for natural bilayer behavior. Utilizing this capability, AFM has been used to examine dynamic bilayer behavior including the formation of transmembrane pores (holes) and phase transitions in supported bilayers. Another advantage is that AFM does not require fluorescent or isotopic labeling of the lipids, since the probe tip interacts mechanically with the bilayer surface. Because of this, the same scan can image both lipids and associated proteins, sometimes even with single-molecule resolution. AFM can also probe the mechanical nature of lipid bilayers.|$|E
5|$|Pictures of {{shooting}} the music video in Lyngby, Denmark were released on Aqua's Facebook page on 14 September 2011. A take {{of the video}} was also uploaded on their YouTube channel. The video was officially uploaded on YouTube on 22 September. Directed by Michael Sauer Christensen, it is set in an eerie, empty house that is reminiscent of a horror film, where a black cloud wanders through {{the halls of the}} house. The members wear black and gray clothing in the video, with Nystrom's costume gradually changing throughout. The video ends by the members exiting the house through the roof and transforming into a <b>beam</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> shooting into the sky. The video uses a shortened radio edit of the original song, omitting the bridge.|$|E
5|$|The early-to-mid 1800s were {{a period}} of intense debate on the particle-versus-wave nature of light. Although the {{observation}} of the Arago spot in 1819 may seem to have settled the matter definitively in favor of Fresnel's wave theory of light, various concerns continued {{to appear to be}} addressed more satisfactorily by Newton's corpuscular theory. Arago had suggested in 1838 that a differential comparison of the speed of light in air versus water would serve to prove or disprove the wave nature of light. In 1850, racing against Foucault to establish this point, Fizeau engaged L.F.C. Breguet to build a rotary-mirror apparatus in which he split a <b>beam</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> into two beams, passing one through water while the other traveled through air. Beaten by Foucault by a mere seven weeks, he confirmed that the speed of light was greater as it traveled through air, validating the wave theory of light.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} {{papers in}} the series were treatises on gravitational radiation (one with Sachs, one with Trümper). The work with Sachs studies, among other things, vacuum solutions with special algebraic properties, using the 2-component spinor formalism. It also gives a systematic exposition of the geometric properties of bundles (in mathematical terms: congruences) of light beams. Spacetime geometry can influence the propagation of light, making them converge on or diverge from each other, or deforming the bundle's cross section without changing its area. The paper formalizes these possible changes in the bundle {{in terms of the}} bundle's expansion (convergence/divergence), and twist and shear (cross-section area-conserving deformation), linking those properties to spacetime geometry. One result is the Ehlers-Sachs theorem describing the properties of the shadow produced by a narrow <b>beam</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> encountering an opaque object. The tools developed in that work would prove essential for the discovery by Roy Kerr of his Kerr solution, describing a rotating black hole – {{one of the most important}} exact solutions.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor and Clara {{attend the}} ceremony, where the Doctor {{explains}} {{that since the}} Rings were settled {{there has been a}} constant song sung to keep an angry god asleep. The people fear that the god, which they call Grandfather, will awaken and consume the entire universe if the song is ever interrupted. Merry begins singing, joined by a chorister at the pyramid. During the song, a mummy in a glass case at the pyramid begins to awaken. Merry panics, believing she got the song wrong. A <b>beam</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> from the pyramid envelops her, and she is pulled toward the pyramid and the mummy. The Doctor and Clara find Dor'een and rent the space bike using Clara's mother's ring as payment. They ride the bike to the pyramid where they find the mummy struggling to escape the case and consume Merry's soul. The Doctor promises Merry that she does not have to sacrifice herself and that he will stop Grandfather. As they attempt to leave, a group of creatures called the Vigil arrive and attempt to force Merry to sacrifice herself. The Doctor holds the Vigil at bay long enough to let Clara and Merry escape from the throne room, but then the case shatters and the mummy breaks free. A ray of light strikes the planet, revealing that Grandfather is Akhaten itself, a planet-sized parasitic creature.|$|E
5|$|The party {{arrives at}} a giant Mechat base in the clouds and are tossed into the throne room of Nene, the {{apparent}} leader. Nene explains to them how he enjoys hearing the screams of the dying victims of the Land Shark. The party battles Nene, but are easily defeated. They are {{thrown out of the}} base and start to fall to their deaths, but a <b>beam</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> from the base catches them, and brings them back to the base. The party find three small floating spheres {{in the middle of the}} room; a mysterious voice commands them to swallow the spheres. The party refuses, and instead hold onto the spheres for safekeeping. As they try to reach another Mechat to escape the base, they are forced to fight a large army of Nene's robots. When the battle seems it will never end, and with the unseen voice promising them knowledge of how to pilot the Mechat, the party members eat the spheres. As they consume the spheres, a strange transformation occurs to each, changing the forms of their shadows into powerful beings that are able to destroy the robot army. The party escapes the base and crash in a desert.|$|E

5|$|Quatermass is {{rescued by}} a group of elderly people living in a scrap yard. At the hospital, the doctors are shocked when Isabel levitates off her bed and explodes in a cloud of dust. Elsewhere, the devastated Kapp is left alone in the ruins of his cottage and observatory. More and more young people are joining the Planet People, {{including}} the gangs that have been terrorising the cities and the soldiers assigned to keep them away from the Megalithic sites. Contact is restored with Chuck Marshall and with the Russians in the form of Gurov (Brewster Mason). Quatermass theorises {{that this is not the}} first time this has happened; megalithic sites such as prehistoric stone circles are in fact markers where beacons have been left by the alien force for its next visit. Quatermass believes the force is a sphere of energy surrounding the Earth. The Russians and the Americans send a space shuttle, commanded by Marshall, to make contact with the force. Quatermass is sceptical; he believes they are dealing not with an intelligence but with a machine constructed to harvest human protein. The space shuttle is destroyed but not before Marshall reports a giant <b>beam</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> stretching in all directions. Meanwhile, the Planet People are gathering at Wembley Stadium in the tens of thousands. Annie and Quatermass travel to the stadium but are powerless to prevent the Planet People from gathering. When they are attacked, Annie drives their car into the underground car park beneath the stadium where she crashes the vehicle and is killed. The lightning strikes the stadium.|$|E
5|$|Redeemed Warrior - The Redeemed Warrior, also {{referred}} to as the champion, is the unnamed protagonist of the graphic novel Rise of the Warrior who becomes the player's multiplayer character in Ascension. In Rise of the Warrior, it is shown that he was a native of Kirra whose father was killed by a general. Before dying, the warrior swore to his father that he would bring no harm to his family. The warrior then gathered soldiers of the village and sought after the general, also recruiting the witch Circe. Finding the general, he discovered that the general was actually his uncle and Circe's lover. After negotiations, the warrior tricked his uncle into drinking poisonous Cerberus blood, killing his uncle. Circe was aghast and fled. Because he killed his uncle, it broke his oath to his father. The Giver appeared, revealing himself to be Orkos, and imprisoned the warrior in the Prison of the Damned. In Ascension during Kratos' pursuit of Megaera, Kratos encountered the warrior, who was rejoiced to see an opportunity for freedom from his prison. Before being attacked by an arm of the Hecatonchires, the warrior vanished in a <b>beam</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> upon praying to the gods. This transported him to the Rotunda of Olympus. There, he started his trials for redemption to become a champion of the gods and was given a choice to either swear an allegiance to Ares, Hades, Poseidon, or Zeus. Several people are credited for the character in Ascensions multiplayer: Dave Carter, Neil Kaplan, Kevin Killebrew, Alem Brhan Sapp, Isaac C. Singleton Jr., Anthony Skordi, and Jimmie Wood.|$|E
25|$|When a <b>beam</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> {{crosses the}} {{boundary}} between a vacuum and another medium, or between two different media, the wavelength of the light changes, but the frequency remains constant. If the <b>beam</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> is not orthogonal (or rather normal) to the boundary, the change in wavelength results in {{a change in the}} direction of the beam. This change of direction is known as refraction.|$|E
