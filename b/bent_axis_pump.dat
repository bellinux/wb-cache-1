This research paper presents the mechanical model of a <b>bent</b> <b>axis</b> <b>pump</b> that simulates the dynamic behaviour of the main measurable quantities (e. g. the shaft torque) and the mutual forces in interacting components. The model is parametric and thus apt in predicting the influence of geometric design variables on pumps mechanical characteristics.

The Thoma-principle (engineer Hans Thoma, Germany, patent 1935) with max 25 degrees angle and the Wahlmark-principle (Gunnar Axel Wahlmark, patent 1960) with spherical-shaped pistons in one piece with the piston rod, piston rings, and maximum 40 degrees between the driveshaft centreline and pistons (Volvo Hydraulics Co.). These have the best efficiency of all pumps. Although in general the largest displacements are approximately one litre per revolution, if necessary a two-liter swept volume pump can be built. Often variable-displacement pumps are used, so that the oil flow can be adjusted carefully. These pumps can in general work with a working pressure of up to 350-420 bars in continuous work.|$|R

The key requirements of this project are the precise alignment of the joint, as well as the accuracy of the measurements. The EPA requires us to have measurement accuracies of up to 0. 1 degrees in some of our measurements and to align certain joint surfaces to within. 010 in.

40|$|N-terminal acetylation, catalysed by N-terminal acetyltransferases (NATs), {{is among}} the most common protein {{modifications}} in eukaryotes and involves the transfer of an acetyl group from acetyl-CoA to the α-amino group of the first amino acid. Functions of N-terminal acetylation include protein degradation and sub-cellular targeting. Recent findings in humans indicate that a dysfunctional Nα-acetyltransferase (Naa) 10, the catalytic subunit of NatA, the major NAT, is associated with lethality during infancy. In the present study, we identified the Danio rerio orthologue zebrafish Naa 10 (zNaa 10). In vitro N-terminal acetylation assays revealed that zNaa 10 has NAT activity with substrate specificity highly similar to that of human Naa 10. Spatiotemporal expression pattern was determined by in situ hybridization, showing ubiquitous expression with especially strong staining in brain and eye. By morpholino-mediated knockdown, we demonstrated that naa 10 morphants displayed increased lethality, growth retardation and developmental abnormalities like <b>bent</b> <b>axis,</b> abnormal eyes and bent tails.

40|$|Conventional {{variable}} displacement hydraulic pumps and motors suffer from poor efficiency at low displacements, {{primarily due to}} the friction and leakage associated with hydrodynamic bearings, which do not scale with output power. A {{variable displacement}} adjustable linkage pump has been developed which can achieve zero displacement and has a constant top dead center position of the pistons, regardless of displacement. This architecture employs roller element bearings in its pin joints, significantly reducing the mechanical losses at low displacements {{as compared to the}} hydrodynamic bearings of variable axial piston and <b>bent</b> <b>axis</b> machines.

40|$|The {{application}} of switched mode control to hydraulic systems {{has the potential}} of decreasing component complexity, size, and cost. This is accomplished by enabling variable pump or motor functionality using a single on/off valve paired with a compact, inexpensive fixed displacement machine. A 4 -way tandem rotary on/off valve is presented in this paper that extends a novel rotary valve concept (experimentally validated for pump applications) to hydraulic pump/motors. The pump/valve system is referred to as a Virtually Variable Displacement Pump/Motor (VVDPM) since the effective displacement of the system is variable and not the physical displacement of the pump itself. This paper investigates the design and efficiency of the proposed rotary valve when utilizing the VVDPM on a light weight powersplit hydraulic hybrid passenger vehicle that is driven over a standard federal drive cycle. Simulated VVDPM efficiency maps are presented for motoring and pumping and the cycle efficiency of an optimized VVDPM is compared to that of a typical <b>bent</b> <b>axis</b> unit.

5000|$|Axial {{piston pumps}} using the {{swashplate}} principle (fixed and adjustable displacement) have {{a quality that}} is almost {{the same as the}} <b>bent</b> <b>axis</b> model. They have the advantage of being more compact in design and also allow use of [...] "through-drive" [...] series mounted auxiliary rotating equipment, based on their in-line design. The pumps are easier and more economical to manufacture; the disadvantage is that they are more sensitive to oil contamination. The axial piston pump is likely the most widely used variable displacement type, being found in everything from heavy industrial to mobile applications. By using different compensation techniques, the variable displacement type of these pumps can continuously alter fluid discharge per revolution and system pressure based on load requirements, maximum pressure cut-off settings, horsepower/ratio control, and even fully electroproportional systems, requiring no other input than electrical signals. This makes them potentially hugely power saving compared to other constant flow pumps in systems where prime mover/diesel/electric motor rotational speed is constant and required fluid flow is non-constant.|$|R

40|$|Pitx 3 is a {{homeodomain}} {{transcription factor}} {{with an expression}} pattern conserved across phyla: in the dopaminergic neurons of the midbrain, in the lens during all stages of lens development and in the forming somites. In Xenopus laevis, this gene shows novel expression areas, such as the pituitary gland, {{the heart and the}} gut. Morpholino-based knockdown of pitx 3 results in phenotypes characterized by small or absent lens, <b>bent</b> dorsal <b>axis</b> and randomized coiling of the heart and gut. Comparing gene expression changes in wild-type versus knockdown embryos by microarray, we generated a vast list of genes possible downstream targets for pitx 3. Confirming a number of those genes as affected by the absence of pitx 3 allowed for positioning pitx 3 in a variety of pathways. Given that a significant number of these genes were known as major players during somitogenesis, corroborated with the <b>bent</b> dorsal <b>axis</b> phenotype initiated the further discovery for the role of pitx 3 in this developmental process. To determine direct targets for pitx 3 we needed a reporter assay to test the protein-promoter interaction. Since the existing assays were deemed unsatisfactory in terms of accuracy and sensitivity we developed a new technique which permits precise detection of the reporter gene in a homogenous population of cells containing both the transcription factor and the reporter. This also enables the assessment of cooperativity for the tested transcription factors. Lastly, this new technique was employed to examine the promoters of some of the microarray candidate genes and to determine new direct targets for pitx 3, thus redesigning existing pathways to incorporate the new interactions...|$|R
5000|$|A section plane across any {{elongated}} form {{in principle}} is {{held to be}} transverse if it is orthogonal to the axis (e.g., a transverse section of a finger; {{if there is no}} length axis, {{there is no way to}} define such sections, or there are infinite possibilities). Therefore, transverse body sections in vertebrates are parallel to the ribs, which are orthogonal to the vertebral column, that represents the body axis both in animals and man. The brain also has an intrinsic longitudinal axis - that of the primordial elongated neural tube - which becomes largely vertical with the erect posture of Man, similarly as the body axis, except at its rostral end, as commented above. This explains that transverse spinal cord sections are roughly parallel to our ribs, or to the ground. However, this is only true for the spinal cord and the brainstem, since the forebrain end of the neural axis bends crook-like during early morphogenesis into the hypothalamus, where it ends; the orientation of true transverse sections accordingly changes, and is no longer parallel to the ribs and ground, but perpendicular to them; lack of awareness of this morphologic brain peculiarity (present in all vertebrate brains without exceptions) has caused and still causes erroneous thinking on forebrain brain parts. Acknowledging the singularity of rostral transverse sections, tradition has introduced a different descriptor for them, namely coronal sections. Coronal sections divide the forebrain from rostral (front) to caudal (back), forming a series orthogonal (transverse) to the local <b>bent</b> <b>axis.</b> The concept cannot be applied meaningfully to the brainstem and spinal cord, since there the coronal sections become horizontal to the axial dimension, being parallel to the axis.|$|R

40|$|Centrifugal training, {{based on}} the {{extinction}} procedure, is an innovative type of apple tree training recently used in French apple orchards. The thinning cut of fruiting spurs along the trunk and on the proximal and underside parts of the fruiting branches modifies the within-tree leaf density and light environment, {{which is likely to}} affect the development of some apple pests and pathogens. In this study, the development of the most serious foliar pests (aphids, mites) and disease (apple scab) was assessed over 3 years in an organic apple orchard with two training systems: the centrifugal training (CT) system, and the original Solaxe (OS) system, using a <b>bent</b> <b>axis</b> with no removal of fruiting spurs, as a control. Infestation levels were significantly lower in 2002 and 2004 in the CT system than in the OS system for the most prevalent pest, the rosy aphid, Dysaphis plantaginea, and in 2003 for the red spider mite, Panonychus ulmi. Infestation by the green apple aphid, Aphis pomi, was higher in June 2002 and June 2004 and lower in 2003 in the CT system, compared to the control. The incidence of leaf scab was lower in the CT system than in the control in Spring 2002 and Spring 2004; but, later in the Summer, it increased more in CT trees, resulting in no difference between training systems in the level of fruit infection at harvest. Hypotheses considered were based mainly on: (i) the removal of pests or inoculum due to the thinning cut of fruiting spurs for CT trees; (ii) the within-tree microclimate, providing a more aerated canopy in the CT system; (iii) the shoot density and distribution, allowing greater distances between growing shoots in CT trees; and/or (iv) the shoot growth dynamics, allowing the presence of attractive or susceptible leaves in late June. Since the most serious apple pests and diseases were less prevalent in the CT system during the 3 years of the experiment, this proved to be a complementary, but sustainable, means to contribute to crop protection, especially in organic or integrated pest management orchards...|$|R
40|$|To modern eyes, the {{internal}} logic expected in architecture {{is lacking in}} Minoan structures. Minoan buildings and the spaces within them were complex and multi-use, rather than functionally derived and specific, and the modern concept of privacy did not exist. As a necessary {{step in the process}} of understanding how the Minoans utilized their architecture, this dissertation creates a new method of determining whether spaces were seen as public or private, or rather where they fit on a spectrum. ^ The methodology presented in the dissertation is a typology of access and circulation patterns, which provides a means of assessing relative privacy. The management of access and circulation by means of fixed architectural features forms the basis for the new typology. Within the typology, five circulation patterns are identified; they are, from most to least private: room to room, matrix, circulatory nexus, corridor, and exterior. Additionally, there exists a sixth morphological variant, <b>bent</b> <b>axis,</b> which increases the privacy of the other types. ^ The dissertation applies the typology to examples from the corpus of Minoan houses: Nirou Chani, Kommos, Pseira, the Mochlos Artisans 2 ̆ 7 Quarters Building A, and the Mochlos Chalinomouri Farmhouse Building A. Based on the typology, the dissertation addresses the relative privacy of spaces within the structures on two levels: that of the inhabitants in relation to other inhabitants and that of inhabitants in relation to visitors. For each case study, the results of access and circulation pattern analysis are then supplemented by the evidence of artifacts. ^ Unlike Gamma Analysis or other quantitative methods, this typology does not divorce the measurement of access and circulation from the plans or the finds. It is easy to apply in the field to guide research. As a result, the typology both confirms and clarifies the interpretations made about structures by archaeologists. Finally, the study provides new evidence of how the Minoans viewed privacy, which will assist in future interpretations of functions. The access and circulation pattern typology provides valuable new evidence about Minoan architecture and its usage. ...|$|R

Consideration of the soliton energy of translocation provides a novel dynamical picture of sliding: steep potential gradients correspond to deterministic motion, while "flat" regions, corresponding to homogeneous AT or GC content, are governed by random, thermal motion.
