Similarly, Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly wrote that the [...] "spiky, Europop throb" [...] of [...] "Radio" [...] expertly taunt the boys and fill the dance floor. Darryl Sterdan of Jam! was surprised by the new musical direction of Beyoncé but concluded that [...] "... you <b>better</b> <b>believe</b> it ... it kinda works". Daniel Brockman of The Phoenix described [...] "Radio" [...] as the most believable song on the album, and complimented its [...] "amid bland testaments to love's timeless endurance and the smut and thuggin of the 'Sasha Fierce' persona, [...] is one with sensual overtones sung to an electronic device that, unlike men, 'never lets me down'". Echoing Brockman's sentiments, Amy Linden of Vibe magazine, who wrote that 1980's electropop and the sleek Valentine music of [...] "Radio" [...] tells the story of Beyoncé's alter ego. Similarly, Nana Ekua Brew-Hammond of The Village Voice wrote that [...] "Radio" [...] "show [...] Sasha [...] just a good girl playing fierce". By contrast, Matos Michaelangelo of The A.V.

500|$|In June 2003, Gravel gave {{a speech}} on direct {{democracy}} at a conference hosted by the American Free Press. The event was cosponsored by the Barnes Review, a journal that endorses Holocaust denial. In the wake of criticism for his appearance, Gravel has said repeatedly {{that he does not}} share such a view, stating, [...] "You <b>better</b> <b>believe</b> I know that six million Jews were killed. I've been to the Holocaust Museum. I've seen the footage of General Eisenhower touring one of the camps. They're [...] nutty as loons if they don't think it happened". The newspaper had intended to interview Gravel about the National Initiative. Gravel later recounted the background to the event:"He [...] liked the idea of the National Initiative. I figured it was an opportunity to discuss it. Whether it is the far right, far left, whatever, I'll make my pitch to them. They gave me a free subscription to American Free Press. They still send it to me today. I flip through it sometimes. It has some extreme views, {{and a lot of the}} ads in it are even more extreme and make me want to upchuck. Anyways, sometime later, Carto contacted me to speak at that Barnes Review Conference. I had never heard of the Barnes Review, didn't know anything about it or what they stood for. I was just coming to give a presentation about the National Initiative. I was there maybe 30 minutes. I could tell from the people in the room (mainly some very old men) that they were pretty extreme. I gave my speech, answered some questions and left. I never saw the agenda for the day or listened to any of the other presentations." ...|$|E
