5|$|Initially, {{the caps}} {{are covered by}} a peridium—an outer {{covering}} layer of tissue. After the fruit body matures and <b>begins</b> <b>to</b> <b>dry</b> out, {{the lower part of}} the peridium starts to rip, usually starting from small longitudinal slits near where the peridium attaches to the top of the stem. However, the pattern of tearing is variable; in some instances, the slits may appear higher up on the peridium, in others, the peridium rips more irregularly. The peridium may also rip in such a way that it appears as if there is a ring at the top of the stem. The torn peridium exposes the internal gleba. The gleba is divided into wavy plates or lamellae, some of which are fused together to form irregular chambers. The gleba is a drab brown to blackish-brown color, and it becomes tough and brittle as it dries out. The flesh is firm when young, white, and will stain light to bright yellow when it is bruised.|$|E

Using a device he finds in the room, the Doctor reverses Cassandra's teleport and brings her back onto the station. In the elevated temperature and without moisturising, Cassandra <b>begins</b> <b>to</b> <b>dry</b> out and crack. She begs for mercy from the Doctor, but he refuses to listen and Cassandra ruptures. Rose notes that with all the events that occurred no one had witnessed the actual destruction of Earth. The Doctor returns Rose to her present time, and explains {{to her that he}} is the last of the Time Lords, and that his planet of Gallifrey was destroyed {{in the wake of a}} great war. The episode closes with Rose and the Doctor going off to get chips on a sunny London afternoon.|$|E
500|$|The current {{formulation}} of smallpox vaccine is a live virus preparation of infectious vaccinia virus. The vaccine is given using a bifurcated (two-pronged) needle that is dipped into the vaccine solution. The needle {{is used to}} prick the skin (usually the upper arm) {{a number of times}} in a few seconds. If successful, a red and itchy bump develops at the vaccine site in three or four days. In the first week, the bump becomes a large blister (called a [...] "Jennerian vesicle") which fills with pus, and begins to drain. During the second week, the blister <b>begins</b> <b>to</b> <b>dry</b> up and a scab forms. The scab falls off in the third week, leaving a small scar.|$|E

Berger took the place but he too retired with suspension problems six laps later. It rained {{again and the}} leaders now pitted for wets.

500|$|During the post-monsoon {{months of}} October to December, a {{different}} monsoon cycle, the northeast (or [...] "retreating") monsoon, brings dry, cool, and dense air masses to {{large parts of}} India.It is called autumn. Winds spill across the Himalayas and flow to the southwest across the country, resulting in clear, sunny skies. Though the India Meteorological Department (IMD) and other sources refers to this period as a fourth ("post-monsoon") season, other sources designate only three seasons. Depending on location, this period lasts from October to November, after the southwest monsoon has peaked. Less and less precipitation falls, and vegetation <b>begins</b> <b>to</b> <b>dry</b> out. In most parts of India, this period marks the transition from wet to dry seasonal conditions. Average daily maximum temperatures range between [...]|$|E
500|$|The tusks of an {{elephant}} are modified incisors {{in the upper}} jaw. They replace deciduous milk teeth when the animal reaches 6–12 months of age and grow continuously at about [...] a year. A newly developed tusk has a smooth enamel cap that eventually wears off. The dentine is known as ivory and its cross-section consists of crisscrossing line patterns, known as [...] "engine turning", which create diamond-shaped areas. As a piece of living tissue, a tusk is relatively soft; it is as hard as the mineral calcite. Much of the incisor can be seen externally while the rest is fastened to a socket in the skull. At least one-third of the tusk contains the pulp and some have nerves stretching to the tip. Thus {{it would be difficult}} to remove it without harming the animal. When removed, ivory <b>begins</b> <b>to</b> <b>dry</b> up and crack if not kept cool and moist. Tusks serve multiple purposes. They are used for digging for water, salt, and roots; debarking or marking trees; and for moving trees and branches when clearing a path. When fighting, they are used to attack and defend, and to protect the trunk.|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, tick. Now, {{it struck}} me that this would do for the crackers. We should have to cut it in strips three or four times the width of the cracker. Then we could get Maria to make us some stiff paste; starch would be better, but of course we have none. Then, taking a strip of the cloth, we would turn over one side of it an inch from the edge to make a sort of trough, pour in the gunpowder, {{carefully}} paste {{all the rest of it}} and fold it over and over, and then, when it <b>begins</b> <b>to</b> <b>dry,</b> double it up and tie it with string. We should then only have to add touch-paper, which, of course, we could make out of anything, and put into the end fold. We could break up a few of the cartridges, soak them in wetted powder, and then cut them up into small pieces and stick them into the ends of the crackers. I think that would do first-rate. I have made dozens of crackers, and feel sure that I could turn out a good lot of them now. The squibs will be easier; we should only have to paste one side of the strips and roll them up so as to form suitable cases. When these are dry we should put a thimbleful of powder into each, and then fill them up with powder and charcoal. In order to make sure of a loud bang we could undo a piece of rope and wind the strands round each case for an inch and a half from the bottom. Of course, when we had ground down the burned wood we would mix it with powder and try one or two of the squibs, so as to find the proportions of charcoal to be used." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{potential}} for soil salination {{is a large}} risk when choosing the placement of water wells. Soil salination is caused when the water table of the soil drops over time and salt begins to accumulate. In turn, the increased amount of salt <b>begins</b> <b>to</b> <b>dry</b> the soil out. This is a very detrimental problem because the increased level of salt in the soil can result in the degradation of soil and can be very harmful to vegetation.|$|E
5000|$|Adults {{emerge in}} the late spring, usually in mid-May, and remain a pest for several weeks {{depending}} on the weather. [...] Larvae are orange-colored and live in damp soils. The complete life cycle takes two years from egg to adult. Adults emerge when the soil <b>begins</b> <b>to</b> <b>dry</b> and cracks develop. In areas with this soil type, lawns are common sources of these tiny flies. Larvae can diapause for 3 years or longer depending on environmental conditions.|$|E

50|$|Amphibious xerocoles, such as {{species of}} the Phyllomedusa genus of frogs, have wax-like {{coatings}} on their skin to reduce water loss. The frogs secrete lipids from glands in their skin: when their skin <b>begins</b> <b>to</b> <b>dry</b> out, they move their limbs over the glands on their backs, and wipe the lipids over their bodies. Other desert amphibians, such as the Cyclorana genus of frogs, avoid desiccation by burrowing underground during dry periods and forming a cocoon from shed skin: rather than being sloughed off, the skin remains attached to create the cocoon. As skin layers amass, water impermeability increases.|$|E
