40|$|Using {{quantum dot}} {{fluorescence}} imaging, we investigated the interference of surface plasmon beams in branched silver nanowire structures. Depending on the phases and polarizations {{of the incident}} light, interferences of plasmon beams modulate the plasmon propagation in the branched structures and the output light intensity in the distal ends. The interference visibility {{is strongly dependent on}} the incident polarization at the main wire terminal, and the mechanism is revealed by quantum dot fluorescence imaging of the near field distribution of propagating plasmons. The near field distribution pattern resulting from the beating of different plasmon modes plays a critical role in the plasmon interference. The overlap of the antinode in the near field pattern with the connection junction in the nanowire structure is required for a large interference visibility, since the overlap makes the electric field intensity difference of the two plasmon beams smaller. It is found that the plasmon interference is strongly dependent on the polarization of the excitation light at the main wire terminal, but weakly dependent on the polarization at the <b>branch</b> <b>wire</b> terminal...|$|E

40|$|Department of Energy EngineeringThere {{are many}} kinds of {{one-dimensional}} (1 -D) nanomaterials such as nanofiber, nanoribbon, nanotube and nanowire. They have been widely studied over a decades because they are promising materials for applications in various optoelectronic devices such as organic photovoltaic cell, flexible sensor, phototransistor, organic light-emitting diode. Recently, on the other hand, 1 -D nanomaterials with unique structure morphologies have been developed and applied to optoelectronic devices that can exhibit unusual electrical characteristics, and these unconventional 1 -D nanomaterials were employed for fundamental study in organic electronics. In this work, 1 -D organic semiconductor nanomaterials with unconventional structures including branched nanowires have been developed and used for various optoelectronic devices. In addition, the fundamental charge transport mechanisms have been investigated. First, we synthesized <b>branched</b> <b>wires</b> by modifying the morphology of 1 -D nanowires from solution phase. The injection {{of different kinds of}} non-solvents, such as methanol, ortho-dichlorobenzene or a nanowire-dispersed solution, greatly affected the growth mechanism of nanowires during the π- π stacking of molecules and resulted in the formation of <b>branched</b> <b>wires.</b> Organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) were fabricated for the fundamental study on the charge transport of these branched nanowires. Electrical characterizations of over one hundred samples and investigation of activation energy by temperature analysis suggests that there is difference in the electron mobility of <b>branched</b> <b>wires</b> upon switching the source-drain direction. For second experiment, a highly photo-sensitive material (2 Z, 2 'Z) - 3, 3 '-(2, 5 -dimethoxy- 1, 4 -phenylene) bis(2 -(3, 5 -bis(trifluoromethyl) phenyl) acrylonitrile) (DM-R) and other three materials were synthesized with high purity. These materials were easily fabricated into nanowires by stacking π-π self-assembly in solution-phase. By using these nanowires, highly photo-sensitive field-effect transistor was fabricated and their photo-responsivity was measured in high-vacuum condition to compare with their thin film structure. For third experiment, nanoparticle-embedded magnetically-alignable nanowires were synthesized via the injection of iron oxide nanoparticle dispersed ethanol as a non-solvent in a hot BPE-PTCDI solution. The nanowire was aligned by external magnetic force due to the embedded magnetic nanoparticles inside the body of nanowire. For the application to the memory, the field-effect transistor device was fabricated and its memory characteristics were measured. ope...|$|R

In these cases one finds large deviations from the transposing schemes. For example, in some such transpositions, only two of the three conductors on the pylons change their place. Also transpositions on pylons near power substations are used to get an optimal arrangement of the feeding system without crossing of conductors.|$|R

The presence of Sn during {{growth has been}} shown to strongly influence the morphology of the resulting structures, including Sn doped <b>branched</b> <b>wires,</b> whips, and needles. Subsequent codoping with Cr is achieved through thermal diffusion for photonic purposes. The formation mechanism of the branched structures has been studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Epitaxial growth has been demonstrated in some cases, revealed by a very high quality interface between the central rod and the branches of the structures, while in other cases, formation of extended defects such as twins has been observed in the interface region. The influence of dopants on the energy levels of Ga and O within the structures has been studied by XPS. Micro-Raman spectroscopy was used to assess the influence of Sn doping, and Sn-Cr codoping on the vibrational properties of single nanowires. Cathodoluminescence (CL) measurements show a Sn-related complex band in the Sn-doped structures. Temperature-dependent and excitation-density-dependent CL indicates that this is a thermally activated emission. In the Sn-Cr codoped samples, the characteristic, very intense Cr^ 3 + red luminescence emission quenches the bands observed in the Sn-doped samples.

5000|$|Tuttle's {{reputation}} as a master was secured in Europe as it swiftly embraced Tuttle's minimalist art. In the United States, however, acceptance of his work was slower. His works on paper are considered seminal works in American art. His first works, small monochrome reliefs, were followed by making palm-size paper cubes with cut-out designs and shaped wood reliefs that seemed like a twist on geometric abstraction. Beginning in the mid-1960s, he began to create eccentrically-shaped painted wood reliefs, followed by ideograms made of galvanized tin, and unstretched, shaped canvases dyed in offbeat colors. Tuttle had a survey exhibition in 1975 at the Whitney Museum of American Art. The exhibit was controversial and the show's curator Marcia Tucker lost {{her job as a}} result, after a scathing review by Hilton Kramer. Kramer, then art critic for The New York Times, wrote, referring to Ludwig Mies van der Rohe's dictum [...] "less is more", [...] "in Mr. Tuttle's work, less is unmistakably less ... One is tempted to say, where art is concerned, less has never been as less than this". According to art critic Christopher Knight of the Los Angeles Times, Tuttle's Wire pieces, which the artist made in 1971 and 1972, [...] "collectively rank as his most distinctive contribution to art history".
