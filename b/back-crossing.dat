40|$|Using peritoneal {{macrophage}} cultures it {{was found}} that both PRI mice and their macrophages in culture were susceptible to mouse hepatitis virus and that C 3 H mice and macrophages were resistant. All F 1 macrophages and some <b>back-cross</b> cell cultures were susceptible. The degeneration of F 1 and <b>back-cross</b> macrophages obtained either from adult mouse peritoneal exudate or newborn mouse liver, occurred more slowly than PRI macrophages. Segregation of susceptibility occurred in the first <b>back-cross</b> generation. Tests of three <b>back-cross</b> generations from susceptible mice yielded about one-quarter of the mice shown to be susceptible either by direct test or test of their macrophages. A clear correlation between susceptibility in vivo and in vitro was established both in the test of the percentage segregation and in tests of individual <b>back-cross</b> mice. A small series of tests, however, indicated that 50 per cent of the <b>back-cross</b> mice had the genetic capacity to transmit susceptibility. Thus a hypothesis of two genes for susceptibility, although not excluded, may yield to a hypothesis of a single dominant gene, incompletely expressed. Resistant cells were converted into susceptible cells by ingestion of a relatively large particle containing a heat-stable substance. This susceptibility, although complete, was temporary. The nature of the factor causing the change has been discussed...|$|R
40|$|Rat T cells, {{like those}} of mouse and human origin, respond {{strongly}} to superantigens (SAg) derived from Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxins A and B (SEA, SEB). Lewis and ACI are high responders, whereas Brown Norway (BN) is a low responder. Congenic and <b>back-cross</b> rat studies indicate {{that the degree of}} responsiveness is controlled by at least one non-MHC gene. The action of these genes may reside in the antigen-presenting cells (APC), since both Sephadex G 10 non-adherent BN spleen cells and purified BN T cells in the presence of Lewis APC can respond well to SE. Responses to concanavalin A (Con A) and SEA generally segregate together in <b>back-cross</b> rats. Surprisingly, the degree of responsiveness to Con A and SEA is not correlated with the susceptibility to experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) either in independently derived inbred rat strains or in (Lewis x BN) x BN <b>back-cross</b> rats...|$|R

500|$|In North America, {{there is}} a need for this fruit to have {{resistance}} to white pine blister rust. New cultivars such as 'Crusader', 'Coronet' and 'Consort' have been developed there by crossing R. nigrum with R. ussuriense and these show resistance to the disease. However the quality and yield of these varieties are poor as compared to non-resistant strains and only Consort is reliably self-fertile. <b>Back-crossing</b> these varieties to a parent have produced new strains such as 'Titania' that have a higher yield, better disease resistance, are more tolerant of adverse weather conditions and are suitable for machine harvesting.

40|$|One of {{the early}} {{developments}} {{in the study of}} linkage in Drosophila was the discovery that the phenomenon of crossing over is confined to the female sex (Morgan 1912). The fact that no crossing over occurs in the male Drosophila holds true not only for sex-linked genes but for factors in the autosomes as well and is so well established that it affords a most convenient method of determining to which of the different linkage groups a new factor belongs. The same phenomenon, but with the sexes reversed, obtains in the silkworm moth. Tanaka (1914, 1915) has found from <b>back-cross</b> tests of both sexes in this organism, that crossing over occurs in the male but not in the female. Similarly Goodale (1917) has observed crossing over in the sex chromosome of the male fowl but none in the female and more recently Cole and Kelley (1919) have reported that crossing over occurs in the male pigeon but not in the female. In the latter case <b>back-cross</b> tests were made of both sexes though the number of progeny from <b>back-cross</b> F 1 females to double-recessive males is not large. In the experiments with fowls Goodale made <b>back-cross</b> tests with the F 1 males but not with the F 1 females. No crossing over in the females, however, was noted in any of his original crosses...|$|R

Segregation in F 2 progenies of family 3 and progenies from <b>back-crosses</b> to P 3, the most resistant parent, indicated that 2 modifiers, in addition to PmÂ², differentiated extreme resistance.

40|$|Reciprocal mass crosses and <b>back-crosses</b> were {{performed}} between two homogeneous {{strains of the}} housefly (Musca domestica L.), representing the extremes in susceptibility and resistance to dieldrin.

The F 2 generation segregated in an approximate ratio of 1 : 2 : 1 into susceptible, heterozygote and resistant phenotypes, while the <b>back-cross</b> to the susceptible parent yielded 49. 8 : 50. 2 susceptible: resistant males, and 48. 8 : 51. 2 susceptible: resistant females. Elimination of susceptible forms in the <b>back-cross</b> progeny by use of a discriminating dosage and interbreeding the survivors produced offspring segregating into 26 % susceptible, 50. 1 % heterozygote and 23. 9 % resistant, in excellent statistical agreement with a ratio of 1 : 2 : 1 expected in simple Mendelian inheritance.

40|$|The Sgp- 1 c trait is {{associated}} with H- 2 s and relates to the small content of serum gp 70 {{as well as the}} lack of serum gp 70 responsiveness to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Northern hybridization of RNA from B 10. S liver and its hybrid with NZB showed that the suppression of gp 70 in Sgp- 1 c carrying mice can be regulated at the transcriptional level. However, the inheritance of this trait shows the complicated manner of segregation in certain crosses. All (B 10. S x NZB) F 1 hybrid mice and F 1 x B 10. S <b>back-cross</b> mice had low amounts of serum gp 70 and did not respond to LPS with increased levels of serum gp 70. In contrast, F 1 x NZB <b>back-cross</b> progeny varied widely in serum gp 70 levels. The serum gp 70 levels of most F 1 x NZB <b>back-cross</b> mice was increased by LPS, although the range of increases was broad. These results indicate that the Sgp- 1 c alone is not sufficient to lower serum gp 70 levels, unless B 10 background is present.

40|$|To {{determine}} the inheritance patterns of both IgM class and IgG class hypergammaglobulinaemias, {{the locations of}} genes and the relations of these genes to other autoimmune traits in NZB X NZW (B/W) F 1 hybrid, we measured serum levels of both IgM and IgG in NZB, NZW, B/W F 1 hybrid, B/W F 1 X NZW <b>back-cross</b> and B/W F 1 X NZB <b>back-cross</b> mice. The highest serum IgM levels were observed in NZB mice, however the serum IgG levels were normal. In contrast, {{a large amount of}} IgG was produced in B/W F 1 hybrids, in which the serum IgM levels were lower than those observed in NZB mice. The NZW mice had fairly normal values for both measures. Progeny studies suggested that a single dominant locus (Imh- 1) of NZB strain, which is loosely linked to brown-black coat colour locus b and Mup- 1 locus on chromosome 4, determines the IgM class hypergammaglobulinaemia. The estimated gene order was Mup- 1 :b:Imh- 1. This IgM class hypergammaglobulinaemia in NZB mice was suppressed to a considerable extent in B/W F 1 hybrid mice by either a gene dosage effect or more likely, a regulatory gene locus of NZW strain, being also loosely linked to Mup- 1 locus on chromosome 4. As for the IgG class hypergammaglobulinaemia, a complementary effect of two or three genes, either one or two dominant genes derived from NZB and a single dominant gene from NZW strains, determines this trait in B/W F 1 hybrid mice. There appeared to be no relationships between the genes responsible for the IgM class and IgG class hypergammaglobulinaemias. When looking at the correlations between the hypergammaglobulinaemias and the traits, anti-double stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibodies and renal disease in both <b>back-cross</b> mice, we found a significant quantitative correlation only between the IgG class hypergammaglobulinaemia and the IgG class anti-dsDNA antibodies in B/W F 1 X NZB <b>back-cross</b> mice...|$|R
