5|$|Tactically, {{the pass}} at Thermopylae was {{ideally suited to}} the Greek style of warfare. A hoplite phalanx could block the narrow pass with ease, with no risk of being outflanked by cavalry. Moreover, in the pass, the phalanx would have <b>been</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> to assault for the more lightly armed Persian infantry. The major weak point for the Greeks was the {{mountain}} track which led across the highland parallel to Thermopylae, that could allow their position to be outflanked. Although probably unsuitable for cavalry, this path could easily be traversed by the Persian infantry (many of whom were versed in mountain warfare). Leonidas was made aware of this path by local people from Trachis, and he positioned a detachment of Phocian troops there in order to block this route.|$|E

25|$|An {{alternative}} {{explanation is}} {{the mixture of}} savanna and scattered forests increased terrestrial travel by proto-humans between clusters of trees, and bipedalism offered greater efficiency for long-distance travel between these clusters than quadrupedalism. In an experiment monitoring chimpanzee metabolic rate via oxygen consumption, {{it was found that}} the quadrupedal and bipedal energy costs were very similar, implying that this transition in early ape-like ancestors would have not have <b>been</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> or energetically costing. This increased travel efficiency is likely to have been selected for as it assisted the wide dispersal of early hominids across the savanna to create start populations.|$|E

Nazified street signs were torn down and their names changed back from Nazi to Habsburg heroes.|$|E
25|$|Upon the {{completion}} of their model, Crick and Watson had invited Wilkins to be a co-author of their paper describing the structure. Wilkins turned down this offer, as he had taken no part in building the model. He later expressed regret that greater discussion of co-authorship had not taken place as this might have helped to clarify the contribution the work at King's had made to the discovery. There {{is no doubt that}} Franklin's experimental data were used by Crick and Watson to build their model of DNA in 1953.

25|$|Lee's army {{suffered}} 5,355 casualties (versus 3,214 Union) in this wasted effort, {{but continued}} to follow the Union army {{all the way to}} Harrison's Landing. On Evelington Heights, part of the property of Edmund Ruffin, the Confederates had an opportunity to dominate the Union camps, making their position {{on the bank of the}} James potentially untenable; although the Confederate position would be subjected to Union naval gunfire, the heights were an exceptionally strong defensive position that would have <b>been</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> for the Union to capture with infantry. Cavalry commander Jeb Stuart reached the heights and began bombardment with a single cannon. This alerted the Federals to the potential danger and they captured the heights before any Confederate infantry could reach the scene.|$|E

25|$|The Flatiron Building, {{designed}} by Daniel Hudson Burnham and standing 285ft (87m) high, {{was one of}} the tallest buildings in New York City upon its completion in 1902, made possible by its steel skeleton. It {{was one of the}} first buildings designed with a steel framework, and to achieve this height with other construction methods of that time would have <b>been</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult.</b> (The Tower Building, {{designed by}} Bradford Gilbert and built in 1889, is considered by some to be New York City's first skyscraper, and may have been the first building in New York City to use a skeletal steel frame, while the Home Insurance Building in Chicago, which was built in 1884, is considered the world's first skyscraper due to its steel skeleton). Subsequent buildings such as the Singer Building and the Metropolitan Life Tower were higher still.|$|E
25|$|Analysis of {{the wreck}} could not {{determine}} whether the escape hatch was workable from the inside. Analysts theorise that the men may have rejected risking the escape hatch {{even if it were}} operable, and would have preferred to wait for a submarine rescue ship to attach itself to the hatch. The sub was relatively close to shore {{and in the middle of}} a large naval exercise. The sailors had every reason to believe that rescue would arrive quickly. Using the escape trunk was risky. The sailors were in a compartment that was initially at surface atmosphere pressure, so they did not risk decompression sickness ('the bends') if they used the rescue hoods to ascend to the surface. But the Arctic water was extremely cold and they could not survive long in the water. Also, water was slowly seeping into the ninth compartment, increasing the atmospheric pressure and thus the risk of decompression sickness and death when they ascended to the surface. In addition it was likely that some of the men were seriously injured and escape would have <b>been</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> for them.|$|E
25|$|While repressive {{measures}} were relaxed {{starting in the}} mid-1970s, gaining new converts proved difficult. One method involved members traveling in pairs by train, starting a conversation on religious topics and beginning to proselytize after gaining the interest of others in their compartment. Another strategy was to start religious discussions in cemeteries or in crowded areas like rail and bus stations. The Watchtower was sent into Romania in English, translated by Witnesses into Romanian, the manuscript sent into Austria and copies then brought back into Romania, distributed to members and used in conversion efforts. According to British political scientist Tom Gallagher, by the 1980s, one source of converts to the Witnesses, {{as well as to}} Protestant denominations, was the new working class housed in urban high-rise settlements, as the Orthodox hierarchy was reluctant {{to take care of this}} group's religious needs. In an interview with the World Council of Churches' official magazine, Metropolitan Antonie Plămădeală of the dominant Romanian Orthodox Church said that gaining official recognition would have <b>been</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> for Jehovah's Witnesses in Romania because of their attitude toward the Communist state and to military service, but it would not have been impossible if the state had better understood their views and been less paranoid. He claimed that if they kept a low profile and were not active against the state, the authorities would be unconcerned about them.|$|E

25|$|The Nyasaland {{government}} had imprisoned Banda, not realising {{that he was}} the only African politician they could negotiate with on a credible constitution for the protectorate. Devlin's conclusion that there was no murder plot and that Banda, unlike other Congress leaders, was not involved in promoting violence opened the way for the British government to deal with him. Had Devlin found there was a murder plot and that Banda had encouraged violence, this would have <b>been</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult.</b> Despite Lennox-Boyd's rejection of the Devlin Report, once Iain Macleod replaced him at the Colonial Office late in 1959, Devlin was approached by Macleod for advice. The Royal Commission {{on the future of the}} Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland (the Monckton Commission) toured the Federation in February 1960. It had been given limited terms of reference and was boycotted by the opposition Labour Party and the African nationalists in Nyasaland and Northern Rhodesia. As the Commission's composition seemed weighted towards a continuation of the Federation, its report disappointed the British government. The Monckton Commission reported widespread and sincere opposition to the Federation in the two northern territories. It considered Federation could not survive without at least a major devolution of powers to Nyasaland and Northern Rhodesia, giving more voting rights to Africans and lessening racial discrimination. Most importantly, it also recommended that Britain should retain the right to allow the secession of either northern territory, recognising that African nationalists would not accept even a modified Federation.|$|E

The game was remembered as {{contentious}} for Tyrone fans, for the fact that a point that would have equalised the match in the dying seconds was controversially disallowed, because the blind-sided referee deemed Canavan to have touched the ball on the ground. The referee, Paddy Russell stated in his autobiography that he was certain the ball was on the ground, but Canavan contested in the same book that he managed to get elevation on the ball as he punched, which would have <b>been</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> to do if it was touching the ground.|$|E
500|$|The RAAF {{was highly}} {{satisfied}} {{with the performance of}} the F-4Es, and they {{played an important role in}} preparing No.82 Wing to operate the F-111.

In particular, the Phantoms gave RAAF personnel experience operating aircraft fitted with sophisticated avionics and capable of using a wide range of weapons, and the intensive training program undertaken by No.82 Wing during this period significantly improved its professionalism. In his book Going Solo: The Royal Australian Air Force 1946–1971, Alan Stephens also argued that the speed with which the Air Force's aircrew and technical personnel adapted to operating Phantoms [...] "illustrated the RAAF's exceptional technical competence".|$|E
