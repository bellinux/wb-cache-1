50|$|The {{long-term}} growth in imports was facilitated by several major factors. The most important was general {{growth in the}} Japanese economy and income levels. Rising real incomes increased demand for imports, both those consumed directly and those entering into production. Another factor was the shift in the economy toward greater reliance on imported raw materials. Primary energy sources in the late 1940s, for example, were domestic coal and charcoal. The shift to imported oil and coal as major energy sources did not come until the late 1950s and 1960s. The small size and poor quality {{of many of the}} mineral deposits in Japan, combined with innovations in ocean transportation, such as <b>bulk</b> <b>ore</b> <b>carriers,</b> meant that as the economy grew, demand outstripped domestic supply and cheaper imports were utilized.|$|R

5000|$|The tramp trade {{first took}} off in Britain around the mid 19th century. The {{dependability}} and timeliness of steam ships {{was found to be}} more cost-effective than sail. Coal was needed for ships' boilers, and the demand created a business opportunity for moving large amounts of best Welsh coal to various seaports in Britain. Within a few years tramp ships became the workhorses of trade, transporting coal and finished products from British cities {{to the rest of the}} world. [...] The size of tramp ships remained relatively constant from 1900 to 1940, at about 7,000 to 10,000 deadweight tons (dwt.). During the Second World War, the United States created the Liberty Ship; a single design that could be used to carry just about anything, which weighed in at 10,500 dwt. [...] The U.S. produced 2,708 Liberty Ships and they were used on every international trade route. [...] After the Second World War, economies of scale took over and the size of tramp ships exploded to keep up with a booming supply and demand cycle. During this time the bulk carrier became the tramp of choice for many owners and operators. The bulk carrier was designed to carry coal, grain and ore, which gave it more flexibility and could service more ports than some of its ancestors, which only carried a single commodity. [...] Today the tramp trade includes all types of vessels, from bulk carriers to tankers. Each can be used for a specific market, or ships can be combined like the oil, <b>bulk,</b> <b>ore</b> <b>carriers</b> to accommodate many different markets depending where the ship is located and the supply and demand of the area. Tramp ships often carry with them their own gear (booms, cranes, derricks) in case the next port lacks the proper equipment for loading or discharging cargo.|$|R

40|$|A sunken ship load {{needs more}} and more {{to be taken into account}} in the design of an {{immersed}} tunnel. Such a load is often governing the design. The designer gets often a prescribed value (in kN/m 2) from the client for a sunken ship load. The range in prescribed values show however a big scatter. There are also a lot of tunnels over which a lot of ships are passing, without having a sunken ship load taken into account in the design. This gives the need to get more insight in the behaviour of a sunken ship to predict a representative sunken ship load. Another important question is, if a ship sinks on an immersed tunnel, whether the tunnel collapses or not. If the tunnel collapses, the users are not safe anymore. The insight in the behaviour of a sunken ship is gained through a literature study. From this literature study it resulted that a sunken ship load depends on a lot of parameters. It depends on the mass density of the carried cargo, the size of the ship, the depth of the waterway, and the way how a ship sinks. To determine a sunken ship load, all events in which a ship hits the tunnel are set out in a fault tree. All those events are evaluated with respect to the probability of occurrence an the magnitude of load. The magnitude of load is determined with the aid of a developed model. In that model the different parameters on which a sunken ship load depends are taken into account. The event in which a ship sinks with its bow on the tunnel deck appears to be the most important one. Sunken ship loads ranging from 50 – 300 kN/m 2 are found then. The response of an immersed tunnel depends on the type of tunnel. Concrete tunnels appear to be the most important type of tunnel. Concrete tunnels on a typical Dutch subsoil are evaluated with respect to a large sunken ship load of 300 kN/m 2. For the cross sectional analysis, an globally increase in U. C. of 1. 3 for shear and a decrease in U. C. of 0. 7 for bending moment was found. For the longitudinal analysis, monolithic tunnels obtain shear forces in the joints which are three times bigger than the strength. The bending moments cause through cracking of the tunnel structure. The deformation of the water seals remain below the requirements. The shear forces in the joints for a segmented tunnel lie in the same order of magnitude as the strength. The bending moments remain small and cause no through cracking of the tunnel structure. The deformations of the water seals can become twice as high as allowed. The Wijkertunnel is used as a case study to evaluate the response of a specific tunnel when subjected to a sunken ship load. The Wijkertunnel is a segmented tunnel with an immersed part of 575 m consisting out of 6 elements. Each element contains four segments. The sunken ship loads applied on the tunnel are derived from the shipping characteristics of the ships passing that tunnel. The tunnel is evaluated for a small ship (a general cargo carrier) and a big ship (an iron <b>ore</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>carrier).</b> For the general cargo carrier only the event of the (bow of the) ship sinking on the tunnel deck is evaluated. For the iron <b>ore</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>carrier</b> the same event is evaluated, and also the event if the ship sinks just next to the tunnel. If the tunnel sinks just next to the tunnel, a load is induced on the tunnel wall. From the cross sectional analysis it resulted that one tunnel tube fails under the load from the general cargo carrier and the load from the iron <b>ore</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>carrier</b> when sinking on the deck. Shear failure is the governing failure mechanism. From the longitudinal analysis it followed that the shear kay fails in the wall if the tunnel is loaded from aside. Failure of one tube of the cross section implies that the structure is no longer structural safe. The users of the tunnel are in great danger then. Failure of the shear key in the wall causes only big leakage problems. The tunnel remains structural safe then. Users of the tunnel are still able to leave the tunnel safely. The risk of a sunken ship load leading to failure of the Wijkertunnel is lower than the risk of a BLEVE. The risk of a BLEVE is often accepted and not covered in the design of immersed tunnels. It is therefore concluded that the risk of a sunken ship load also can be accepted. Civil Engineering and GeosciencesStructural Engineerin...|$|R
