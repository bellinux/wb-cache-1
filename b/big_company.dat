The ethics of buying fair trade from a company that is not committed to the cause are questionable; these products are only making a small dent in a <b>big</b> <b>company</b> even though these companies' products account for a significant portion of global fair trade.|$|E

25|$|During 1918–1921 {{development}} of the Petrograd tram network stalled due to the Civil War. In 1921 the tram deal was eventually improved and new lines were constructed. In 1922 the last line was electrified and tram movement was re-established in the old city center. The tram network then further developed as the first automated needles appeared, three tram parks and a few substations were built. Among the passenger lines, the city had cargo and service tram lines; every <b>big</b> <b>company</b> had its branch from the main tram lines.

500|$|On October 4, 2011, 20th Century Fox Television {{released}} a statement saying: [...] "23 seasons in, The Simpsons is as creatively vibrant as ever and beloved by millions around the world. We believe this brilliant series can and should continue, but we cannot produce future seasons under its current financial model. We are hopeful that we can reach {{an agreement with the}} voice cast that allows The Simpsons to go on entertaining audiences with original episodes for many years to come." [...] One of the problems was that The Simpsons was possibly worth more cancelled than on the air. A 17-year-old syndication deal with local TV stations prohibits Fox from selling the show to cable networks. As long as The Simpsons still produces new episodes, Fox cannot break this deal. In the mean time, cable networks have grown to become just as big a market as the local TV stations. Another consideration was that Fox's parent company News Corp was having meetings discussing the possibility of a cable channel that would only air The Simpsons episodes. Analysts consider a cancellation and subsequent second-run deal that includes cable networks to be worth $750 million. On this issue, Jean commented in an interview with TV Guide that [...] "It's a <b>big</b> <b>company,</b> and there are definitely people whose interests would have been better served by ending it. Those interests were superseded because we're still valuable to the network in terms of our ratings." ...|$|E

500|$|Development of {{the game}} begun {{after the release of}} Nights into Dreams... in July 1996, after Sonic Team {{received}} a lot of letters from fans asking [...] "who Sonic was". Naka and Naoto Ohshima thought it was important to introduce people to the Sonic character, which was the basis for introducing [...] "Project Sonic" [...] to the public. Until the release of Sonic Jam, the studio themselves had not worked on a Sonic title since Sonic & Knuckles in 1994, in which Naka thought that Sonic Team had a good rest period to [...] "recharge our batteries" [...] and had new ideas regarding a new game. [...] "Sonic World"—Sonic Jams 3D hub world—served as a prototype for the first fully 3D Sonic game—Sonic Adventure—which began development for the Saturn but was moved to its successor, the Dreamcast. In a retrospective interview, Naka stated that the 3D section of Sonic Jam was part of an experiment to see how a Sonic the Hedgehog game would work in full 3D. [...] "Sonic World" [...] uses the same engine as Nights; there is speculation that Naka's refusal to share the Nights engine with the Sega Technical Institute (STI) team developing Sonic X-treme—a factor in the latter's cancellation—was motivated by his preference for Sonic Team's own efforts to create an original 3D Sonic title. Naka later expressed [...] "relief" [...] that X-treme was cancelled. Naka and Ohshima reflected that the most difficult part during the development process was gathering game-specific information in [...] "Sonic World", as [...] "there are so many games we have never even heard of... Sega's a <b>big</b> <b>company</b> and before we knew it lots of different game systems had sprung up (including Game Gear, Master System and Pico)." ...|$|E

40|$|We {{challenge}} {{the view that}} technology transfer from <b>big</b> <b>companies</b> to small and medium (SM) size companies helps SM companies to prosper. With a large dataset of SM companies in Korea, we utilize the stochastic production frontier (SPF) model to examine the productivity of inputs and the generalized linear model (GLM) to compare business performance between two groups of SM companies: SM companies that receive technology transfer {{and those that do}} not receive technology transfer from <b>big</b> <b>companies.</b> The empirical results demonstrate that the transfer of technology from <b>big</b> <b>companies</b> to SM companies help SM companies to enjoy productivity of capital. Nonetheless, SM companies receiving technology transfer were found to underperform in terms of labor productivity and profit margin compared to their counterparts. We further investigate the reasons why SM companies receiving technology transfer from <b>big</b> <b>companies</b> underperform relative to their counterparts, and our findings shows that the former do not export much of their product and face more difficulties such as lower price for their products imposed by <b>big</b> <b>companies</b> than the latter. By identifying the negative rather than the conventionally assumed positive effect of technology transfer, this paper contributes to the literature on the relationship between technology transfer and SM companies’ prosperity in the case of Korea. Our findings have important implications for how SM companies should strategize and rethink about the clauses embedded in the transfer of technology that they receive from <b>big</b> <b>companies</b> because technology transfer plays as a barrier to their prosperity...|$|R
