5|$|Following {{his tenure}} as <b>baseball</b> <b>commissioner,</b> Chandler {{returned}} to his law practice. He also engaged in farming and published The Woodford Sun newspaper. The Kentucky Press Association and the Kentucky Broadcasting Association both named him Man of the Year. He continued his involvement in sports, presiding over the International Baseball Conference from 1952 to 1955.|$|E
5|$|Hawke {{lives in}} Boerum Hill, a Brooklyn {{neighborhood}} in New York City, and owns {{a small island}} in Nova Scotia, Canada. Hawke is a great-grandnephew of Tennessee Williams on his father's side.

5|$|On September 11, <b>Baseball</b> <b>Commissioner</b> Kenesaw Mountain Landis {{met with}} representatives from four of the top teams {{in each of the}} two major leagues. The group gave home field to the AL for World Series Games 1–2 (scheduled for October 2 and 3) and 6–7, while the NL would host Games 3–5. Each game was to start at 1:30p.m. local time.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Baseball</b> <b>Commissioner's</b> Office {{met with}} Schoeneweis in 2007 to discuss {{allegations}} {{filed in the}} Mitchell Report, an independent investigation into the use of steroids in major league <b>baseball.</b> The <b>Commissioner's</b> Office announced on December 6, 2007, that there was insufficient evidence against Schoeneweis to warrant any disciplinary action.|$|R

50|$|In general, the commissioners' {{powers and}} {{responsibilities}} in the NFL, NBA and NHL are not substantially {{different from those}} of the presidents that preceded them. Although <b>baseball's</b> subsequent <b>commissioners</b> have not had the absolute power that Landis did, former Commissioner Bud Selig has succeeded in centralizing authority over Major League <b>Baseball</b> in the <b>commissioner's</b> office, relegating the position of league president to an honorary title and giving <b>baseball's</b> <b>commissioner</b> competencies similar to those of his colleagues in the other major sports.|$|R
5|$|After the Series, Ruth and {{teammates}} Bob Meusel and Bill Piercy {{participated in a}} barnstorming tour in the Northeast. A rule then in force prohibited World Series participants from playing in exhibition games during the offseason, the purpose being to prevent Series participants from replicating the Series and undermining its value. <b>Baseball</b> <b>Commissioner</b> Kenesaw Mountain Landis suspended the trio until May 20, 1922, and fined them their 1921 World Series checks. In August 1922, the rule was changed to allow limited barnstorming for World Series participants, with Landis's permission required.|$|E
5|$|Chandler {{remained}} {{involved in}} politics throughout his tenure as <b>baseball</b> <b>commissioner.</b> In 1948, he became {{the leader of the}} Dixiecrat movement in Kentucky. He hosted Dixiecrat presidential candidate Strom Thurmond at his home when he visited the state, but did not officially endorse Thurmond's campaign. By the time he had permanently returned to the state in mid-1951, {{it was too late to}} influence the gubernatorial contest. He spent the next four years rebuilding his political base in preparation for another run at the office.|$|E
5|$|Chandler's {{contract}} as <b>baseball</b> <b>commissioner</b> was not due {{to expire}} until April 1952, but he asked for the owners to extend it in December 1949. The owners voted against offering the extension at that time, but promised to consider the request again in December 1950. The vote in 1950 was nine votes for Chandler and seven against, leaving him three votes short of the necessary three-fourths majority. Chandler asked that the extension be considered again at the owners' meeting on March 12, 1951, but the vote was again 9–7. Upset that his contract was not extended, Chandler resigned effective July 15, 1951.|$|E

5|$|The Cy Young Award {{is given}} {{annually}} {{to the best}} pitchers in Major League Baseball (MLB), one each for the American League (AL) and National League (NL). The award was first introduced in 1956 by <b>Baseball</b> <b>Commissioner</b> Ford Frick in honor of Hall of Fame pitcher Cy Young, who died in 1955. The award was originally given to the single best pitcher in the major leagues, but in 1967, after the retirement of Frick, the award was given to one pitcher in each league.|$|E
5|$|The first Jackie Robinson Day was on April 15, 2004. That {{day was a}} {{start to}} an annual {{tradition}} throughout Major League Baseball and an inspirational reminder about what happened on that day exactly fifty-seven years earlier when Jackie Robinson became a Major League Baseball player. The day {{would be the first}} official league-wide Jackie Robinson Day, having festivities taking place at all 23 ballparks where Major League games were scheduled to be played. <b>Baseball</b> <b>Commissioner</b> Bud Selig made the announcement with Sharon Robinson (daughter of Rachel and Jackie Robinson).|$|E
5|$|April 15, 2005, was the 58th {{anniversary of}} Jackie Robinson's major league debut. <b>Baseball</b> <b>Commissioner</b> Bud Selig officially {{declared}} that every April 15 would be designated as Jackie Robinson Day {{and it would}} be celebrated each year throughout Major League Baseball. Every ballpark in Major League Baseball in the United States celebrated Jackie Robinson Day, unlike in 2004 when it was only celebrated in 13 ballparks. Each ballpark showed a video tribute to Robinson, and many brought out Jackie Robinson Foundation scholars onto the field before the games. In Cincinnati, Ohio, Ken Griffey, Jr. spoke of how much every African-American baseball player owes Robinson, who was chosen by manager Branch Rickey to break the color line because of Robinson's inner courage and ability to keep his temper in check.|$|E
50|$|As sports author Jim Thielman notes, it {{was common}} at the time for <b>baseball's</b> <b>commissioner</b> to have input on World Series rosters, and Commissioner Ford Frick {{suggested}} the Twins bring their roster to 25 men by dropping a player who had not participated for the entire season. As a late-season replacement who played in the outfield, where the Twins were well-stocked with veterans, Kosco was kept off the World Series roster.|$|R
50|$|Rowland was the {{cheerleader}} for the PCL {{battle cry}} of independence. Air travel was still primitive, and the PCL teams had near major-league {{standing in the}} rapidly growing cities of the Western United States. He took on major league <b>baseball</b> <b>commissioners</b> Kenesaw Mountain Landis and Happy Chandler, trying to free the league from losing players to the American and National League for a minuscule $7,500.00 buyout of their contract.|$|R
5000|$|George [...] "Buck" [...] Weaver, third baseman. Weaver {{attended}} the initial meetings, {{and while he}} did not go in on the fix, he knew about it. Landis banished him on this basis, stating [...] "Men associating with crooks and gamblers could expect no leniency." [...] On January 13, 1922, Weaver unsuccessfully applied for reinstatement. Like Jackson, Weaver continued to profess his innocence to successive <b>baseball</b> <b>commissioners</b> to no effect.|$|R
5|$|Chandler, who {{was also}} {{allegedly}} at the meeting, made no public mention of it until a 1972 interview. In the interview, Chandler then corroborated the essentials of Rickey's story, although he placed the meeting at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in January 1947. He also recounted that later in 1947, Rickey came {{to his home in}} Kentucky to discuss the matter further. According to Chandler, Rickey professed that he would not move forward with Robinson's transfer unless he had Chandler's full support, which Chandler subsequently pledged. Aside from Chandler's anecdote, which he frequently repeated after the 1972 interview, {{there is no evidence that}} his meeting with Rickey ever took place. Nevertheless, future <b>baseball</b> <b>commissioner</b> Bowie Kuhn and Washington Post sportswriter Bob Addie maintained that Robinson would not have played had it not been for Chandler's intervention.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the death}} of <b>Baseball</b> <b>Commissioner</b> Kenesaw Mountain Landis in November 1944, John O. Gottlieb, a friend of Chandler's in the War Department, {{suggested}} Chandler as a successor. Baseball owners who had been afraid that their players would be made eligible for the draft during the war had decided that their new commissioner needed to have the skills and influence to represent baseball's interests in Washington, D. C. As a senator, Chandler had advocated on behalf of baseball during the war, endearing him to the owners. Furthermore, the commissioner's $50,000 annual salary—about five times that of a US senator at the time—proved a significant enticement, and Chandler agreed {{to be considered for}} the job.|$|E
5|$|The All-Star Game {{managers}} {{selected the}} entire lineups from 1933 to 1946. In 1947, the fans {{were given the}} ability to select the starting lineups. This continued until 1957, when Cincinnati Reds fans stuffed the ballot box and selected seven Reds and Stan Musial. This forced <b>Baseball</b> <b>Commissioner</b> Ford Frick {{to step in and}} replace Wally Post and Gus Bell with Willie Mays and Hank Aaron that season and to turn over the starting lineup selection to players, coaches and managers for several subsequent seasons. Since 1970, the fans have elected the starting lineup of one player for each baseball position (except the pitcher) for both the National League and American League teams.|$|E
50|$|Holtzman wrote or edited {{more than}} a dozen books, {{including}} No Cheering in the Press Box, a collection of interviews with 18 sportswriters that was published in 1974. A revised edition in 1995 added interviews with six new subjects. Among his other notable books are The Commissioners, which contained biographies of <b>baseball's</b> <b>commissioners</b> and a history of the office, and Baseball Chicago Style, a history of the Chicago Cubs and Chicago White Sox.|$|R
5000|$|On May 16, 2008, the White Sox fired Wilder and two scouts {{after an}} {{investigation}} in Latin America. Federal authorities {{were called in}} as well, and the <b>baseball</b> <b>commissioner's</b> office was investigating the parents of several Latin players about bonuses {{that they may have}} received from major-league baseball teams. [...] A major league baseball investigator confirmed to the Chicago Tribune that the investigation involved skimming and was limited only to the White Sox.|$|R
50|$|Major League Baseball's {{disaster}} plan {{is covered}} in Rule 29 of its official rules.The plan is triggered by an event causing the death, dismemberment, or permanent disability of at least five players from a team's active, disabled, or suspended roster during a season (including the playoffs), or at least six players during the off-season. Major League <b>Baseball's</b> <b>commissioner</b> will decide if the disabled club can continue play, {{in consultation with the}} MLB Players' Association and the club.|$|R
5|$|As {{professional}} baseball became increasingly profitable, players frequently raised grievances against owners over issues {{of control and}} equitable income distribution. During the major leagues' early decades, players on various teams occasionally attempted strikes, which routinely failed when their jobs were sufficiently threatened. In general, the strict rules of baseball contracts and the reserve clause, which bound players to their teams even when their contracts had ended, tended to keep the players in check. Motivated by dislike for particularly stingy owner Charles Comiskey and gamblers' payoffs, real and promised, members of the Chicago White Sox conspired to throw the 1919 World Series. The Black Sox Scandal {{led to the formation}} of a new National Commission of baseball that drew the two major leagues closer together. The first major league <b>baseball</b> <b>commissioner,</b> Kenesaw Mountain Landis, was elected in 1920. That year also saw the founding of the Negro National League; the first significant Negro league, it would operate until 1931. For part of the 1920s, it was joined by the Eastern Colored League.|$|E
25|$|In August 1941 Lacy {{moved to}} Chicago {{to work for}} another black newspaper, the Chicago Defender, where he served as its {{assistant}} national editor.

25|$|Busch {{persuaded the}} company's board to name him team president, and {{in later years}} he would often be {{described}} as the owner, although it was always the company's property. He further prevailed on the board to spend a combined $1.2 million to buy Sportsman's Park and renovate it. After <b>baseball</b> <b>commissioner</b> Ford Frick discouraged him from renaming it Budweiser Stadium, he chose instead to call it Busch Stadium, the name all Cardinals' home fields have borne since.|$|E

25|$|Prior to {{deciding}} on LeMay, Wallace gave serious consideration to former U.S. Senator, Governor, and <b>Baseball</b> <b>Commissioner</b> A.B.
