5000|$|The term [...] or tate, meaning [...] "to carry", can {{be traced}} back to the 17th century but was not used to {{describe}} bags until 1900. However, the <b>tote</b> <b>bag</b> craze in the United States began in the 1940s with the release of L.L. Bean's Boat Bag in 1944. Because they were easier than carrying luggage, most people opted for using <b>tote</b> <b>bags.</b> During the 1950s, <b>tote</b> <b>bags</b> began to enter into the main culture. Women primarily utilized them as practical handheld bags because they didn't require much care. It wasn't until the 1960s when the <b>tote</b> <b>bag</b> embraced personal style. Bonnie Cashin released her own line of <b>tote</b> <b>bags</b> called Cashin Carry <b>Tote</b> <b>Bags</b> which combined style and functionality. In the 1990s, Kate Spade ultimately transformed how American culture embraced <b>tote</b> <b>bags</b> when she began carrying them as fashion bags.
