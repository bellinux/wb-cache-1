Transmission networks presently cope with outages of other generation plants and daily changes in electrical demand, but the variability of intermittent power sources such as wind power, is more frequent than those of conventional power generation plants which, when scheduled to be operating, may <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>deliver</b> their nameplate capacity around 95% of the time.|$|E
5|$|Hitler {{decided that}} the summer 1942 {{campaign}} would be concentrated in the south; efforts would be made to capture the oilfields in the Caucasus. The Battle of Stalingrad, a major turning point of the war, began on 23 August 1942 with a bombing campaign by the Luftwaffe. The Sixth Army entered the city, but because of its location on the front line, it was still possible for the Soviets to encircle and trap it there without reinforcements or supplies. When the Sixth Army was surrounded {{by the end of}} November in Operation Uranus, Göring promised that the Luftwaffe would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>deliver</b> a minimum of 300 tons of supplies to the trapped men every day. On the basis of these assurances, Hitler demanded that there be no retreat; they were to fight to the last man. Though some airlifts were able to get through, the amount of supplies delivered never exceeded 120 tons per day. The remnants of the German Sixth Army—some 91,000 men out of an army of 285,000—surrendered in early February 1943; only 5,000 of these captives survived the Russian prisoner of war camps to see Germany again.|$|E

25|$|The {{power supply}} must <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>deliver</b> large currents, {{sustained}} and controlled over a useful amount of time. The most important gauge of power supply effectiveness is the energy it can deliver. As of December 2010, the greatest known energy used to propel a projectile from a railgun was 33 megajoules. The most common forms of power supplies used in railguns are capacitors and compulsators which are slowly charged from other continuous energy sources.|$|E
25|$|The {{first sale}} in Sweden was to ASEA-Atom in 1974 to control nuclear power plants. A Swedish {{subsidiary}} was established the following year. Because of the proprietary system architecture of each manufacturer, companies {{would fall into}} a vendor lock-in; therefore purchase of computer systems were often more of a strategic than product-specific purchase.

Most flow testing is done at 10 and 28inches of water pressure (2.5 to 7 kilopascals). Although other test pressures will work, {{the results would}} have to be converted for comparison to the work of others. The pressure developed must account for the test pressure plus the loss across the metering element plus all other system losses. The greater the accuracy of the metering element the greater is the loss. Flow volume of between 100 and 600 cubic feet per minute (0.05 to 0.28 m³/s) would serve almost all applications {{depending on the size of}} the engine under test.|$|E

500|$|There will be losses {{between the}} DC {{output of the}} solar modules and the AC power {{delivered}} to the grid, due {{to a wide range}} of factors such as light absorption losses, mismatch, cable voltage drop, conversion efficiencies, and other parasitic losses. [...] A parameter called the 'performance ratio' has been developed to evaluate the total value of these losses. The performance ratio gives a measure of the output AC power delivered as a proportion of the total DC power which the solar modules should <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>deliver</b> under the ambient climatic conditions. In modern solar parks the performance ratio should typically be in excess of 80%.|$|E

[...] That same year the US Navy began an interim capability program employing the Lockheed P-2 Neptune as its first carrier launched nuclear bomber aircraft until the Savage was in service, the Neptune launched using JATO assist but could not land on existing carriers, if launched they had to either ditch at sea after its mission or land at a friendly airbase.|$|E
