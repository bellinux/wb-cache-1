40|$|The {{mechanism}} of reaction of partial benzylation of cotton fibers has been followed through a systematic study of such parameters as crystallinity, crystallite size, and crystal-lite orientation. Benzylation {{was found to}} be accompanied by a general loss in crystal-linity of the fibers, shifting of the amorphous maximum towards the small angle region, and a possible change in the shape of crystallite. Unit cell dimensions for benzyl cel-lulose with a degree of substitution less than 1 have been determined from a study of partially benzylated flax. An explanation is given for the persistence of (101) peak in amorphous <b>benzyl</b> <b>cellulose...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{dissertation}} was {{an advanced}} investigation of the viscose process. In particular, the substitution pattern within the monomeric unit and {{the characteristics of the}} processes during the viscose ripening were analysed. A new method for the determination of the xanthogenate group distribution within the monomeric unit was developed, which is based on the 13 C-NMR spectroscopy measurements of the stabilized cellulose xanthogenate. In particular, the xathogente groups were stabilized by alkylation of the cellulose xanthogenate by N,N-diethyl chloracetamide or by benzyl bromide. Since the <b>benzyl</b> <b>cellulose</b> xanthogenate had better solubility in eligible NMR solvents, the benzyl bromide was then preferred for further analysis of the industrial viscoses. The substituent distribution of cellulose xanthogente was investigated {{as a function of the}} polymerisation degree of alkali cellulose and of the carbon disulfide for two special cases: a double alkalisation and an application of frozen alkali cellulose. The investigation of the influence of the carbon disulfide input showed a preferred substitution at C- 6 throughout the whole researching DS range (from 0. 5 to 1. 65). In both cases, either using the alkali cellulose after a double slurry alkalisation or using the frozen alkali cellulose, a decrease in the substitution degree of cellulose xanthogenate was observed. This can be explained by the experimental detection of a decreasing of alkali cellulose reactivity. Concerning the substituent distribution, a drop in the substitution at C- 2 position was found. The investigation of the viscose ripening showed an increase in the C- 6 substitution at the initial stage of the ripening which indicates the redistribution of xanthogenate groups. This increase was independent from the carbon disulfide input as well as from the ripening temperature (20 °C and 25 °C). Furthermore, a correlation between the course of the C- 6 substitution and the viscosity during the ripening process could be demonstrated. In each process, the maximum in the substitution at C- 6 corresponded to the minimum in the viscosity. Only at the C- 6 position the xanthogenate groups were proven to exist after a long ripening time. Further experiments were conducted in order to analyse the influence of the hemicellulose on the cellulose xanthogenate substitution. Results showed that an enhancement above 30 g/l of the hemicellulose concentration in the alkalisation lye implies a decrease of the substitution degree as well as of the C- 6 substitution. The addition of hemicellulose to the dissolving lye had no effect on the course of xanthogenate group distribution during the ripening process...|$|E

30|$|To {{the best}} of our knowledge, there has been no attempt to {{evaluate}} electrospun polymer nanofibers as sorbents for urinary 1 -hydroxypyrene. To date, synthetic polymers are the most popular class of electrospun materials employed as SPE sorbents owing {{to the fact that they}} show the greatest potential for tuning of sorptive chemistries. Hence, in this study, 11 polymers [nylon 6, polystyrene (PST), poly(vinyl <b>benzyl</b> chloride) (PVBC), <b>cellulose</b> acetate (CA), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polysulfone (PSO in DMF and pyridine), poly(styrene acryl amide), poly(styrene methacrylic acid), poly(styrene-co-p-sodium styrene sulfonate), poly(styrene-co-divinyl benzene)] were synthesized, fabricated into nanofibers, and evaluated for their efficiency in selectively extracting 1 -hydroxypyrene. It was anticipated that the sorbents would interact well with 1 -hydroxypyrene based on hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bonding, van der Waal interactions or pore-filling. In addition, some of the sorbents have been reported to impart selectivities based on acidity, basicity, and polarity (Kang et al. 2009; Chigome et al. 2011; Wardencki et al. 2007; Fontanals et al. 2007; Kloskowski et al. 2009).|$|R
