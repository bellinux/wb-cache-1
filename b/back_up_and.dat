5|$|In Boston, an {{undercover}} cop {{waits for the}} subway, alone. Suddenly, a suspicious man appears, jumping the fare barrier. Eventually, they both get onto a train and the police officer draws his gun as the man starts to walk towards him from behind. Suddenly, the subway comes to a screeching halt, flashes of light are seen, and the train loses power. Later, when the train is <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> running, a batch of commuters enter the subway car and find the undercover cop with the flesh on half his face and his left arm stripped down to the bone.|$|E
5|$|Galactica departs {{the station}} and rises a chain lift hill. The ride's first drop dips to the right, before rising <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> flying through the ride's centrepiece theming element, a portal, which links to the ride's space theme. Followed by this, riders are turned from the prone {{position}} onto their backs. The coaster then performs a large upward left turn before twisting again, returning riders to the prone position. After exiting from the lie-to-fly element, Galactica passes underneath a small ravine before pitching up, into a tight turn over the plaza area. A 360 degrees inline twist is followed up {{by a series of}} straight flying, and several turns and dips in the track. The train then comes to a stop on the brake run before returning to one of the station's two stations.|$|E
5|$|In Chicago, {{a man by}} {{the name}} of Henry Weems wins $100,000 playing poker against a mobster named Joe Cutrona, though Weems appears ignorant of the basic rules of poker. Suspecting that Weems cheated, Cutrona {{attempts}} to kill him by throwing him off the 29th story of the building they are in. After Weems lands in an access hatch to a basement, he stands right <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> walks away, completely uninjured. Two agents in a car stationed outside witness the event and eventually tell Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), who promptly take the case. Mulder initially believes the man has the ability to cure himself, but Scully thinks he may just be very lucky by landing in a pile of laundry that was right under the access hatch.|$|E

5|$|The {{design of}} a Floorless Coaster has one main {{difference}} from traditional steel roller coasters around the world: it has no floors between the seats. While a train is in the station, a floor is used only for loading and unloading purposes. Because the front row has nothing {{in front of it}} to stop riders from walking {{over the edge of the}} station, a gate is placed in front of the train to prevent this from happening. Once all the over-the-shoulder restraints are locked, the floor separates into several pieces and moves underneath the station. The gate then opens, allowing the train to move forward. When the train returns to the station, the floor is brought <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> the gate is closed as the next riders board the roller coaster. Aside from the station, a Floorless Coaster has several inversions similar to B's Sitting Coasters.|$|E
5|$|Lisa imagines she and all {{the other}} Springfield Elementary {{students}} are Hebrews in ancient Egypt, with the Pharaoh (Principal Skinner) making them build a pyramid. Only Moses (Milhouse) can liberate the Hebrews. When Bart defaces the Pharaoh's sarcophagus, supposedly incited by the burning bush, he gets the other students punished. Lisa helps Milhouse produce plagues to scare the Pharaoh into freeing the Israelites; they fail. This in turn gets Lisa and Milhouse thrown in a Pyramid prison. When they escape, Milhouse gathers all the students and they attempt to leave. When they reach the sea, Lisa has an idea to get across: They simultaneously flush all the Egyptians' toilets to drain the sea. As they cross, the Pharaoh and his guards follow, but the water fills the sea <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> swallows them. They enjoy splashing each other, and then return to the shore. Pleased that they have escaped, Milhouse asks Lisa what the future holds for the Israelites, but Lisa disappoints Milhouse when she says that they have to wander the desert for forty years. Milhouse then asks if {{it is going to be}} smooth sailing for the Jews after that. Rather than disappoint Milhouse again with news of the ongoing anti-Semitism that will plague the Jews for many centuries, she distracts the crowd by sending them to search for manna.|$|E
5|$|Pollet {{started the}} game by {{retiring}} the first three Brooklyn hitters. Eddie Stanky grounded out, Cookie Lavagetto flied out to center field, and Joe Medwick grounded out to end the inning. Branca took the mound {{in the bottom of}} the first, striking out Red Schoendienst and allowing a single to Terry Moore. After National League MVP Musial struck out, Enos Slaughter singled and Whitey Kurowski walked to load the bases. Joe Garagiola, Sr. brought in a run before being tagged out to end the inning with the score 1–0. In the second inning, Carl Furillo reached base on an error by Pollet. Pee Wee Reese singled, but Furillo was out at second. Another groundout brought the Cardinals <b>back</b> <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> the Dodgers got all three batters quickly out to end the inning. In the top of the third, Howie Schultz hit a home run on the first pitch he saw, tying the score at 1–1. After three more outs, St. Louis came back up to bat. Moore flied out, then Musial walked, and Slaughter singled. Musial scored on Kurowski's hit while Slaughter was called out, and after two more singles, the latter bringing in Kurowski, Branca was taken out of the game.|$|E

25|$|After Robert's {{death in}} 1879 his son William Thompson Crawshay {{took over the}} Cyfarthfa works. William finally modernised the works, {{introducing}} steel production. However it took until 1882 to get the works <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> running. It never fully {{caught up with the}} times and with other steel making areas. The ironworks closed once again in 1910. The works briefly made a comeback during the First World War but finally closed for good in 1919.|$|E
25|$|The {{distance}} between the defender line and the midfielder line should be kept constant at about 15 metres. However, the defensive line should <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> thus increase this distance, stand off, {{when there is no}} pressure on the opponent in possession, as this increases the possibility of a through ball. With tough pressure on the opponent, the distance may be reduced to below 15 metres. Also, as opponents move in close to the penalty area, the defending team will be forced to move their midfielders ever closer to their defenders.|$|E

The Eagles finally got on the scoreboard with a field goal before halftime, making the score 17–3. In the third quarter the Eagles recovered an Amani Toomer fumble at the Giants 32-yard line, but the Giants defense managed to halt the ensuing drive at the 13-yard line, and David Akers' 31-yard field goal attempt went wide right. The Giants then added another field goal to increase their lead to 20–3.|$|E

25|$|Early in {{the fourth}} quarter, Yepremian {{increased}} Miami's lead to 19–14 with a 46-yard field goal. Later in the period, Oakland got the ball on their own 17-yard line. Stabler started the drive with an 11-yard completion to Biletnikoff. On the next play, he threw a pass to Cliff Branch at the Dolphins' 27-yard line. Branch made a spectacular diving catch and then got <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> ran {{the rest of the}} way to the end zone for a 72-yard touchdown reception, giving the Raiders a 21–19 lead with 4:37 left in the game. With 2:08 left to play, the Dolphins took a 26–21 lead with a 68-yard, 4-play drive that ended with Benny Malone's 23-yard touchdown run, evading four tackle attempts by Raider defenders on the way to the end zone.|$|E

Jason Elam capped off the drive with a 49-yard field goal to cut their deficit to 7–3, {{but it was as}} close as Denver would ever get {{for the rest of the}} game. After the kickoff, Harrison caught three passes for 70 yards, including a pass in which he made a diving catch around three Denver players.

25|$|The fourth {{match of}} Triplemanía XIX saw Extreme Tiger and Jack Evans {{defending}} the AAA World Tag Team Championship in a steel cage match against TNA X Division Champion Abyss and TNA World Heavyweight Champion Mr. Anderson. The team whose both members {{managed to escape}} the cage would be declared the winner. Abyss and Anderson dominated the match early, but eventually Extreme Tiger {{was able to get}} away from Abyss and escape the cage. In a two–on–one advantage the TNA team was even more dominant and after more double–teaming, Mr. Anderson eventually climbed out of the cage. Left in the cage with Abyss, Evans managed to dodge his attack, use his speed to take him down and hit him with a 450° splash. Evans attempted to escape the cage, but Abyss stopped him, opened the bag he had entered the cage with and emptied its contents, thumbtacks, on the mat. Abyss attempted to chokeslam Evans off the ropes, but Evans escaped the hold by biting his fingers and then powerbombed him onto the tacks. Evans {{climbed to the top of}} the cage, but, instead of escaping, dove back into the ring onto Abyss with a crossbody. Immediately afterwards, Evans climbed <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> escaped the cage to successfully defend the AAA World Tag Team Championship.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the opening}} match, AAA paid {{homage to the}} promotion's founder, Antonio Peña, while the ring crew set up a steel cage for the second match of the evening, a four-way Parejas Suicidas match, {{featuring}} the teams of Chessman and Juventud Guerrera, Extreme Tiger and Halloween, Jack Evans and Teddy Hart, and Joe Líder and Psicosis. The match was contested under escape rules, with all eight participants starting inside the cage and after only one is left inside, that person will then wrestle his partner in a Lucha de Apuestas. Psicosis allowed Halloween to {{climb to the top}} of the cage, believing that he was going to dive back in onto his opponents, but instead Halloween betrayed his Perros del Mal stablemate and became the first man to escape the cage. Extreme Tiger and Jack Evans, former AAA World Tag Team Champions, worked together against Psicosis and Teddy Hart, the other two Perros del Mal members in the match, but were then attacked by Juventud Guerrera, swinging a garbage can. Guerrera then became the second man to escape the cage and was followed shortly afterwards by Tiger, who dove from the top of the cage outside onto Halloween and Guerrera. This meant that the former La Familia de Tijuana was the first team to successfully avoid the Lucha de Apuesta. This was followed by Psicosis turning on and attacking Líder, who had publicly announced prior to the event that he hoped to lose the Parejas Suicidas match to get a shot at Psicosis' hair, before escaping the cage. Evans was the next to escape the cage, after avoiding Teddy Hart's attempts to stop him. Hart then climbed on top of the cage and dove onto Chessman and Líder with a moonsault, before climbing <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> escaping, saving himself and Evans from a Hair vs. Hair match and leaving only Chessman and Líder inside. Psicosis, realizing he was in danger of being forced to a Hair vs. Hair match, climbed up the cage and put his hand out to Líder, offering to help him up. Líder grabbed the hand and started to climb, but was dropped to the mat following a kick from Chessman, who then climbed {{to the top of the}} opposite side of the cage to become the last escapee, meaning that the former La Hermandad 187 partners were forced to a Lucha de Apustas later in the event. As Chessman celebrated at the top of the cage, the lights in the arena suddenly went out, leading to Vampiro making a surprise appearance and pushing his rival down from the top of the cage, dropping him through a set of tables on the floor of the Arena Ciudad de México. Afterwards, Chessman was stretchered out of the arena, while Vampiro showed his support for Líder in his upcoming match.|$|E
