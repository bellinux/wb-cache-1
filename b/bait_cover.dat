40|$|Insecticide-treated net is {{currently}} the best available method to control malaria. The extensive use of pyrethroid insecticides and the challenges of mosquito resistance to these chemical compounds are {{the main reasons for}} undertaking this study. The excito-repellency impacts of three different concentrations of three synthetic pyrethroid insecticide (lambdacyhalothrin, deltamethrin and cyfluthrin) impregnated bednets were evaluated against the susceptible and endophilic primary malaria vector, Anopheles stephensi Liston (Diptera: Culicidae) India susceptible strain under laboratory conditions. Young unfed female adult mosquitoes were exposed to animal <b>bait</b> <b>covered</b> with net in a dark exposure chamber. For each test, the results of mosquitoes` behavior were recorded after half an hour as dead, survived, blood-fed, recovered and retrieved in the exit trap. These studies clearly showed that populations of malaria vectors can be effectively controlled by the use of pyrethroid-treated bednets. The results inferred that deltamethrin was partially superior to other insecticides in terms of toxicity and revealed that cyfluthrin was clearly least effective and deltamethrin was most effective. The latter was 1. 6 and 2. 0 times more effective than lambdacyhalothrin and cyfluthrin, respectively, in killing An. stephensi mosquitoes. In addition, the mean recovery rate due to deltamethrin was 3. 8 and 2. 4 times less effective than cyfluthrin and lambdacyhalothrin, respectively. In conclusion, these data ranked the relative potency of the three pyrethroids in the order deltamethrin > lambdacyhalothrin > cyfluthrin...|$|R
40|$|Mitigation of {{feral pig}} (Sus scrofa) impacts in Australia's Wet Tropics World Heritage Area has been impeded {{by the lack}} of a target-specific method for {{delivering}} toxic baits in the region. This study evaluated methods to reduce bait-take by susceptible nontarget species without inhibiting bait-take by pigs, to enable more effective pig management. We predicted that dingoes would not select an unprocessed corn bait and that other potential nontarget bait consumers would be unable to access the same bait presented under a lightweight cover. Neither of these methods was expected to reduce bait selection or access by pigs. We tested these predictions by monitoring animal interactions with covered and uncovered corn <b>baits,</b> and <b>covered</b> corn and manufactured baits. Use of corn as a bait substrate effectively prevented bait-take by dingoes. <b>Covering</b> <b>baits</b> substantially reduced bait-take by other nontarget species and completely prevented nontarget bait-take when uncovered feed was provided simultaneously. The corn bait preparation was highly acceptable and accessible to feral pigs. We conclude that the methods evaluated here could enable the consideration of poison baiting as a viable method for controlling feral pigs in the World Heritage Area, where it has previously been unavailable...|$|R
50|$|To catch a bird, a thin rope, a sandy place, {{and some}} bait, such as corn, are needed. To trap a dove, a thin rope is knotted in a loop, {{placed in the}} sand, and lightly <b>covered.</b> <b>Bait</b> {{is placed in the}} middle of the trap.

But in this instance the trappers had utilized a special steel cage which could withstand all the strength and cunning of a baboon. It was only necessary, therefore, to drive away the herd which they knew were surrounding the prison and wait for their boys who were even now following them to the trap.|$|R

40|$|Worldwide, lethal {{control is}} an {{important}} means of mitigating the adverse impacts of vertebrate pests. The range of lethal control tools available for any given situation is generally limited by a range of constraints, including the risk of non-target species being harmed by pest control activities. Non-target impacts are particularly problematic in complex faunal communities, where the target pest shares a substantial degree of functional similarity, such as dietary preferences, {{with one or more}} non-target species. In these situations, {{it can be difficult to}} identify differences between pest and non-target species that can be exploited to develop target-specific pest control tools. Here, I present a methodological framework that can assist in the identification of exploitable differences between pest and non-target species. The model consists of five steps: 1) selection of the most appropriate basis for control; 2) identification of opportunities to prevent non-target species from interacting with control activities; 3) classification of non-target species by dissimilarity to the target pest; 4) use of a recognition systems approach to identify further differences between pests and non-target species; and, 5) experimental evaluation of prototype control tools. The framework is demonstrated by using it to develop target-specific methods for poison baiting of feral pig (Sus scrofa) populations in the tropical rainforests of the Daintree region, in north-eastern Australia’s Wet Tropics World Heritage Area. Application of the framework identified several bait design features that could potentially prevent or substantially reduce the incidence of bait consumption by specific groups of non-target species, without inhibiting bait consumption by feral pigs. These bait design features were systematically evaluated in a series of experiments between 2007 and 2009. The first experiment evaluated design features identified in the third step of the framework, which sought to test simple measures to reduce bait consumption by the majority of non-target species. All known resident species were dichotomously classified according to dissimilarities to the feral pig in aspects of their behaviour that related to the selection of food or foraging habitat. Consistent with predictions generated using this method, the monitoring of animal-bait interactions at 18 sites showed that nocturnal bait distribution prevented bait-take by diurnal foragers, and shallow burial substantially reduced bait-take by non-fossorial species. The ability of bait containing both animal and vegetable material to prevent bait selection by dietary specialists could not be tested because these species failed to take either omnivore or vegetarian control baits. Application of the fourth step of the framework indicated that bait consumption by feral pigs and non-target species to which pigs were most similar should vary seasonally. The second experiment tested whether differences in seasonal variation in bait encounter and acceptability between pigs and non-target species could be exploited to identify optimal seasonal conditions for baiting. Animal-bait interactions were monitored at six sites bi-monthly for 18 months, and analysed in relation to temporal change in the availability of alternative foods for small mammals, the physiological condition of feral pigs, and variability in the activity levels of small mammals and pigs. This required the development of a novel camera-trapping method to index the relative abundance of feral pigs. The seasonal study was hampered by poor bait encounter and consumption by feral pigs, and did not identify exploitable seasonal differences in bait consumption by pigs and non-targets. However, observations that the number of small mammals that encountered baits was correlated with the number of small mammals trapped at a site, and that the physiological condition of pigs was inversely related to the preceding two months’ rainfall, suggested that seasonal influences might be important if a bait that was more attractive to pigs could be developed. The third experiment also evaluated a bait design feature identified using the fourth step of the framework. Detailed interspecific comparisons of the behaviour of small mammals and feral pigs indicated that small nocturnal mammals should be deterred from foraging at sites that were augmented with cues indicating an enhanced risk of predation for these species, whereas feral pigs should not. Animal-feed interactions were monitored using giving-up-densities at depletable feeding stations, and remote cameras at pig baiting sites. When applied to an attractive bait, the illumination of baiting sites consistently reduced the foraging intensity of small mammals, but did not inhibit bait encounter or consumption by feral pigs. Auditory repellents were consistently ineffective. The preceding studies showed that manufactured baits were often removed by dingoes, whereas bait encounter and consumption by feral pigs was generally low. The fourth experiment aimed to overcome these problems by developing a bait substrate that was attractive and acceptable to pigs, but not available to dingoes or other non-targets. Using the fourth step of the methodological framework, it was predicted that pigs should find a starch-rich bait acceptable, whereas dingoes should not, and that a lightweight cover could prevent small-bodied omnivores from accessing baits. Remote cameras and sandplots were used to monitor interactions between animals and three <b>bait</b> treatments: <b>covered</b> manufactured <b>baits,</b> <b>covered</b> corn and copra meal bait, and uncovered corn and copra meal bait. Results showed that feral pigs found the corn and copra meal bait much more acceptable than manufactured baits; dingoes did not find the corn bait acceptable; and that small mammals did not access <b>covered</b> <b>baits</b> when uncovered bait was available. These studies have shown that poison baiting for feral pig control in the Wet Tropics World Heritage Area can be conducted in a manner that does not pose a high risk to non-target species. Until now, poison baiting has not generally been available for pig control in the region because of its potential non-target impacts. Further studies should assess the effects of poison baiting on populations of pigs and non-target species, as well as the damage caused by pigs. More generally, the studies reported in this thesis have highlighted the difficulties of developing target-specific pest control tools for use in complex faunal communities, and have demonstrated a useful methodological framework to overcome this problem. The framework should also have applications in areas other than lethal pest control, such as the development of pharmaceutical baits for wildlife populations...|$|R
40|$|Rats with {{perirhinal cortex}} (PRC), hippocampal, or sham lesions were trained on a {{successive}} discrimination go/no-go task to examine recognition memory for {{an array of}} visual objects with varying interference among the objects in the array. Rats were trained to recognize a target array consisting of four particular objects that could be presented {{in any one of}} four possible configurations to <b>cover</b> <b>baited</b> food wells. If the four target objects were presented, the rat should displace each object to receive food. However, if a novel object replaced any {{one or more of the}} target objects, then the rat should withhold its response. The number of novel objects presented on nonrewarded trials varied from one to four. The fewer the number of novel objects in the array, the more interference the array shared with the target array, therefore increasing task difficulty. An increased number of novel objects should result in less interference with the target array and decreased task difficulty. Although accuracy was slightly lower in rats with hippocampal lesions compared with controls, the learning of the groups was not statistically different. In contrast, rats with PRC lesions were significantly impaired in learning compared with both control and hippocampal-lesioned rats. The results suggest that recognition memory for complex visual discriminations is affected by stimulus interference in rodents with PRC damage...|$|R
40|$|Larvae {{of common}} green lacewings (Chrysop- erla carnea species-complex) are {{important}} generalist predators, and {{can serve as}} valuable biological control agents. Since only larvae are predatory, oviposition is of crucial importance. Recently, a ternary floral bait was described, attractive to females that would then lay their eggs {{in the vicinity of}} the baits. Earlier studies have shown that females prefer to lay their eggs on spines and hairs of plants. In the present study, we tested whether the number of eggs laid could be increased by combining chemical, visual and tactile stimuli. Common green lacewings were caught equally well in <b>baited</b> funnel traps <b>covered</b> with white, yellow, fluorescent yellow, light blue or black sheets, showing no preference to any of the colours. In further tests the field effect of the ternary floral bait on the oviposition site choice of common green lacewings was confirmed, as in the absence of the bait only negligible numbers of eggs were recorded on egg-laying plates. In the presence of the ternary floral bait, lacewings laid more eggs on spiny than on smooth surfaces. Removal of previously laid eggs did not affect the number of eggs laid afterwards. Our studies demonstrated that by combining the ternary floral bait and an appropriate spiny surface, oviposition of common green lacewings can be increased and concentrated to a relatively small area. Possible practical applications are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The octopus {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} marine resources in Portugal, especially in the South, the Algarve region. The fishing gears mostly used are the “alcatruz” and the “covo”. The “alcatruz” is a shelter-pot traditionally made of clay, with an amphora shape, but recently plastic cylindrical pots were introduced and became more popular. “Covos” are <b>baited</b> metal cage-traps <b>covered</b> by a plastic net. Although very popular among fishermen, the traditional “alcatruz” made of clay has been replaced by cylindrical plastic pots with great success, due to its resistance to brake. In an attempt to continue using the traditional amphora-shape, a new type of plastic pot was built in association with fishermen. To study the behaviour of the common octopus (Octopus vulgaris) towards the traditional amphora clay shelter-pot, the cylindrical plastic shelter-pot and the new amphora plastic shelter-pot, several experiments were performed in controlled tanks. Three main questions were attempted to answer concerning the preferences of the common octopus towards the pots: 1) What kind of material: plastic or clay (traditional); 2) What shape: cylindrical or amphora (traditional); 3) What colour: white, black or red brick (traditional). The results showed no particular preference towards the material of the fishing gear; a strong preference for the traditional amphora shape; and a strong preference for the black colour...|$|R
40|$|The {{management}} of biodiversity {{in urban areas}} provides a challenge for conservation managers {{who are interested in}} the recovery of native species by controlling exotic species. Exotic-animal control programs using poisons can be contentious in terms of {{the health and safety of}} nontarget species, including people. Managing exotic predators in urban areas must be effective at 2 levels: controlling the target species and minimizing impacts to nontarget species. We investigated the feasibility of instigating a poison-baiting program to control nonindigenous European red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) in city conservation reserves (Perth, Australia). We selected 3 reserves to assess the safety and efficacy of baiting for foxes by maximizing bait uptake by the target species, and minimizing uptake by nontarget species. We tested 2 types of meat bait using 4 bait presentation methods (untethered, uncovered; untethered, covered; tethered, uncovered; tethered, <b>covered).</b> <b>Bait</b> uptake by foxes was highest in urban reserves compared to that in a peri-urban reserve. Bait type and presentation method equally explained bait uptake by foxes. Untethered and uncovered baits were removed 10 % more often by foxes, and untethered baits had been cached more often than tethered baits. Baits cached by foxes for up to 1 week were not removed by species other than foxes. Domestic dogs and native birds were common nontarget species to remove baits. Dogs showed no aversion to removing any bait type, nor did bait presentation method influence bait removal. Birds removed fewer baits that had been tethered and covered. We provide an evidence base to demonstrate that bait uptake by nontarget species can be minimized, although we suggest that a fox control program is likely to be more of an organizational challenge to change public attitudes toward responsible dog ownership rather than a technical challenge to poison foxes...|$|R
