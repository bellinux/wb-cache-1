5|$|As {{the tunnels}} were constructed, they were {{generally}} supported by wooden beams and posts. Once the mine had been finished, the internal space {{was filled with}} combustibles, such as brushwood, firewood, resin, and other incendiary substances; once ignited, these would <b>burn</b> <b>the</b> supporting props, causing the mine to collapse, bringing down with it the structures lying above. From the 15th century, gunpowder was also used, although the aim remained to <b>burn</b> <b>the</b> props.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, guitarists Mark Morton and Matt Conner, bassist John Campbell {{and drummer}} Chris Adler started a band named <b>Burn</b> <b>the</b> Priest. The band members {{knew each other}} from the college they were all attending, Virginia Commonwealth University, in Richmond, Virginia. Morton and Conner left the band soon after its {{inception}} to pursue master's degrees. Adler and Campbell replaced Morton with Abe Spear. For the next five years, the band practiced in Richmond and around Virginia. In 1995, the band released its self-titled first demo. After the demo, <b>Burn</b> <b>the</b> Priest recorded two split EPs with Agents of Satan and ZED respectively. After the band's first three demos, <b>Burn</b> <b>the</b> Priest added vocalist Randall Blythe to its line up.|$|E
5|$|Approximately {{three hours}} into the flight, Commander Ken Cameron and Pilot Jim Halsell fired the orbiter's {{reaction}} control thrusters {{in the first of}} a series of rendezvous burns that refined Atlantiss path towards Mir.

5|$|During the 1960s and 1970s, Chile {{completed}} {{the acquisition of}} Hunters from Britain for service in the Chilean Air Force. In June 1973, the Liberian oil tanker Napier ran aground on Guamblin Island, accidentally releasing 30,000 tons of oil.

At the end of 1943, Meyszner was awarded the Iron Cross 2nd Class.|$|E

5|$|Most {{exploitation}} of oil shale involves mining followed by shipping elsewhere, after {{which one can}} <b>burn</b> <b>the</b> shale directly to generate electricity, or undertake further processing. The most common methods of surface mining involve open pit mining and strip mining. These procedures remove most of the overlying material to expose the deposits of oil shale, and become practical when the deposits occur near the surface. Underground mining of oil shale, which removes less of the overlying material, employs the room-and-pillar method.|$|E
5|$|Posner also {{rejected}} {{the argument that}} the defendants were removing the painting to save Chicago from racial riots that the continued showing of the painting might have started, and in which it might have been destroyed. He found that Tillman herself threatened to <b>burn</b> <b>the</b> painting on the spot, {{and that there was no}} mob. In addition, the court found that because Nelson had not intended to provoke a riot, the First Amendment could still be used to protect his speech.|$|E

Linge later noted the fire did not completely destroy the remains, as the corpses were being burned in the open, where the distribution of heat varies. The corpses burned from 16:00 to 18:30. At approximately 18:30, Lindloff and Reisser covered up the remains in a shallow bomb crater.|$|E

5|$|The small burns {{that are}} tributaries to the East Burn {{contributed to the}} {{draining}} of the lands of Dunnikier Estate. The burn emerges from a deep-set culvert to flow under the Victoria Viaduct, down a deep gorge, through the site of Hutchison's Flour Mills before running parallel to the harbour wall and into the sea. From the mid-19th century, the Hutchison's buildings became a significant landmark adjacent to the <b>burn.</b> <b>The</b> flour millers chose this area for its railway connection which linked the main station to the harbour, rather than for the {{need to use the}} burn to power the mills. The West (or Tiel) Burn, was also important, providing power for textile mills. This burn flowed out of the Raith Estate lands where scenically and recreationally it was used to create Raith Lake (with its tributary, the Dronachy <b>Burn).</b> <b>The</b> mill owners in Linktown also made use of the burn.|$|E

5|$|A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man is {{a nearly}} {{complete}} rewrite {{of the abandoned}} novel Stephen Hero. Joyce attempted to <b>burn</b> <b>the</b> original manuscript {{in a fit of}} rage during an argument with Nora, though to his subsequent relief it was rescued by his sister. A Künstlerroman, Portrait is a heavily autobiographical coming-of-age novel depicting the childhood and adolescence of protagonist Stephen Dedalus and his gradual growth into artistic self-consciousness. Some hints of the techniques Joyce frequently employed in later works, such as stream of consciousness, interior monologue, and references to a character's psychic reality rather than to his external surroundings are evident throughout this novel.|$|E
5|$|Burns {{that affect}} only the {{superficial}} skin layers {{are known as}} superficial or first-degree burns. They appear red without blisters and pain typically lasts around three days. When the injury extends {{into some of the}} underlying skin layer, it is a partial-thickness or second-degree burn. Blisters are frequently present and they are often very painful. Healing can require up to eight weeks and scarring may occur. In a full-thickness or third-degree <b>burn,</b> <b>the</b> injury extends to all layers of the skin. Often there is no pain and the burn area is stiff. Healing typically does not occur on its own. A fourth-degree burn additionally involves injury to deeper tissues, such as muscle, tendons, or bone. The burn is often black and frequently leads to loss of the burned part.|$|E
5|$|Crawford's {{officers}} held {{a council}} of war. Some argued the abandoned village {{proved that the}} Indians knew about the expedition and were concentrating their forces elsewhere. Others expressed the desire to call off the expedition and return home immediately. Williamson asked for permission to take 50 men and <b>burn</b> <b>the</b> abandoned village, but Crawford refused as he {{did not wish to}} divide his forces. The council decided to continue the march {{for the rest of the}} day, but then to go no further. As the column halted for lunch, John Rose was sent north with a scouting party. Soon, two men returned to report that the scouts were skirmishing with a large force of Indians which was advancing towards the Americans.|$|E
