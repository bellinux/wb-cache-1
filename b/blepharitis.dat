25|$|Blepharokeratoconjunctivitis is the {{combination}} of conjunctivitis with <b>blepharitis</b> and keratitis. It is clinically defined by changes of the lid margin, meibomian gland dysfunction, redness of the eye, conjunctival chemosis and inflammation of the cornea.|$|E
25|$|It {{is used in}} eye hygiene {{to treat}} <b>blepharitis.</b> This is done by {{addition}} of a teaspoon of sodium bicarbonate to cool water that was recently boiled, followed by gentle scrubbing of the eyelash base with a cotton swab dipped in the solution.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes the {{appearance}} of floaters has to be attributed to dark specks in the tear film of the eye. Technically, these are not floaters, but they do look the same {{from the viewpoint of}} the patient. Persons with <b>blepharitis</b> or a dysfunctional meibomian gland are especially prone to this cause, but ocular allergies can also cause the problem. To differentiate between material in the vitreous humour of the eye and debris in the tear film, one can look at the effect of blinking: debris in the tear film will move quickly with a blink, while floaters are largely unresponsive to it. Tear film debris is diagnosed by eliminating the possibility of true floaters and macular degeneration.|$|E
25|$|Isotretinoin {{and other}} retinoids {{are well known}} to affect the eyes. Dry eyes are very common during {{treatment}} and is caused by isotretinoin's apoptotic effect on the meibomian glands. Some patients develop contact lens intolerance as a result. In some patients, these changes are long-lasting or irreversible and represent Meibomian Gland Dysfunction (MGD). Other common effects on the eyes include inflammation of the eyelid (<b>blepharitis),</b> red eye caused by conjunctivitis and irritation of the eye. More rare ocular side effects include blurred vision, decreased night vision (which may be permanent), colour blindness, development of corneal opacities, inflammation of the cornea (keratitis), swelling of the optic disk (papilloedema, associated with IIH), photophobia and other visual disturbances.|$|E

5000|$|Ophthalmologic conditions: {{there are}} {{multiple}} types of infections and are common. The gray line of the eye is a line that divides the eyelid into parts: anterior part is skin and muscle while posterior is tarsus and conjunctiva. The <b>blepharitis</b> is classified based {{on the type of}} eyelid involvement. Anterior <b>blepharitis</b> is either staphylococcal blepharitis,or seborrhoeic <b>blepharitis</b> which have symptoms of the presence of scales that are along the hair shaft. Posterior <b>blepharitis</b> is usually due to meibomian gland dysfunction.|$|E
50|$|Blepharoconjuctivitis is {{combined}} <b>Blepharitis</b> and Conjuctivitis. <b>Blepharitis</b> is inflammation and irritation of eyelids and Conjuctivitis is inflammation and irritation of conjuctiva. Blepharoconjunctivitis occurs when normal bacteria that {{live on the}} eyelid skin cause irritation and inflammation to your eyelids. The irritation and inflammation also spreads to conjuctiva.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Blepharitis</b> {{can cause}} blurred vision {{due to a}} poor tear film. Also, the tears might seem frothy or bubbly in nature and mild {{scarring}} might occur to the eyelids. The symptoms and signs of <b>blepharitis</b> are often erroneously ascribed by the patient as being due to [...] "recurrent conjunctivitis".|$|E
5000|$|<b>Blepharitis</b> ( [...] ) is {{a common}} eye {{condition}} characterized by inflammation of the eyelid, resulting in inflamed, irritated, itchy, and reddened eyelids. A number of diseases and conditions can lead to <b>blepharitis.</b> It {{can be caused by}} the oil glands {{at the base of the}} eyelashes becoming clogged, a bacterial infection, allergies, or other conditions.The severity and course can vary. Onset and resolution can be acute, resolving without treatment within 2-4 weeks (this can be greatly reduced with lid hygiene), but often <b>blepharitis</b> is a long-standing chronic inflammation of varying severity.|$|E
5000|$|Staphylococcal <b>blepharitis</b> is a {{condition}} which may start in childhood and continue through adulthood. It is commonly recurrent and it requires special medical care. The prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus in the conjunctival sac and on the lid margin varies among countries, probably due to climate. Chronic bacterial <b>blepharitis</b> may lead to ectropion.|$|E

5000|$|A Cochrane Systematic Review of topical {{antibiotics}} {{were shown}} {{to be effective in}} providing symptomatic relief and clearing bacteria for individuals with anterior <b>blepharitis.</b> Topical steroids provided some symptomatic relief but were ineffective in clearing bacteria from the eyelids. Lid hygiene measures such as warm compresses and lid scrubs were found to be effective in providing symptomatic relief for participants with anterior and posterior <b>blepharitis.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Blepharitis</b> {{usually does}} not cause {{permanent}} eyesight damage. Chronic <b>blepharitis</b> may result in damage of varying severity which may {{have a negative effect}} upon vision and therefore upon the eyeglass prescription. Long-term untreated <b>blepharitis</b> can lead to eyelid scarring, excess tearing, difficulty wearing contact lenses, development of a stye (an infection near the base of the eyelashes, resulting in a painful lump {{on the edge of the}} eyelid) or a chalazion (a blockage/bacteria infection in a small oil glands at the margin of the eyelid, just behind the eyelashes, leading to a red, swollen eyelid), chronic pink eye (conjunctivitis), keratitis, and cornea ulcer or irritation. The lids may become red and may have ulcerative, non-healing areas which may bleed.|$|E

50|$|Dysfunctional meibomian glands often cause dry eyes, one of {{the more}} common eye conditions. They may also {{contribute}} to <b>blepharitis.</b> Inflammation of the meibomian glands (also known as meibomitis, meibomian gland dysfunction, or posterior <b>blepharitis)</b> causes the glands to be obstructed by thick waxy secretions. Besides leading to dry eyes, the obstructions can be degraded by bacterial lipases, resulting in the formation of free fatty acids, which irritate the eyes and sometimes cause punctate keratopathy.|$|E
50|$|Posterior <b>blepharitis</b> is {{inflammation}} of the eyelids secondary to dysfunction of the meibomian glands. Like anterior <b>blepharitis,</b> it is a bilateral chronic condition and is manifested by {{a broad spectrum of}} symptoms involving the lids including inflammation and plugging of the meibomian orifices and production of abnormal secretion upon pressure over the glands. It may be associated with skin rosacea, and there is growing evidence that in some cases it is caused by demodex mites.|$|E

50|$|<b>Blepharitis</b> is {{characterized}} by chronic inflammation of the eyelid, usually {{at the base of}} the eyelashes. This results in inflamed, irritated, itchy, and reddened eyelids.|$|E

50|$|<b>Blepharitis</b> {{caused by}} demodex mites {{can be treated}} using a diluted {{solution}} of tea tree oil and using a cotton swab for 5-10 minutes per day.|$|E

50|$|<b>Blepharitis</b> is the {{irritation}} of the lid margin, where eyelashes {{join the}} eyelid. The eyelids are red and itching, the skin often becomes flaky, and the eyelashes may fall out.|$|E
