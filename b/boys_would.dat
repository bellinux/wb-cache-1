5|$|At {{the end of}} the day, the <b>boys</b> <b>would</b> play sports, boxing, {{or other}} leisure activities, or have hockey or rugby league {{training}} if the weather was suitable. Weekends revolved mainly around sports. Field hockey, rugby league, and other sports were commonly played during the winter time. The boys of the orphanage had a well-known reputation in Goulburn for their sports abilities; boys who participated in tournaments and games usually did well, winning many trophies. The orphanage also had a football team. Sometimes, the <b>boys</b> <b>would</b> hold fetes or participate in annual concerts and operettas, where they would sing and dance.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, it {{was found}} that {{families}} failed to seek medical treatment for their daughters because of the stigma associated with negative medical histories. A study conducted by Pednekar et al. in 2011 found that out of 100 boys and girls with congenital heart disease, 70 <b>boys</b> <b>would</b> have an operation while only 22 girls will receive similar treatment.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} {{building}} reopened, a bomb {{fell on the}} nearby Law Courts, and the staff sent pupils home for a week. However, some pupils were due to take public exams. After Marlborough College refused permission to take the exams there, {{it was decided that}} <b>boys</b> <b>would</b> take the Higher Certificate papers in the Guildhall Crypt.|$|E

5|$|A {{school was}} founded in Deir Ghassaneh in 1925. Prior to the British Mandate period, <b>boys</b> <b>would</b> {{normally}} receive education in a kuttab, an elementary-type school with Islamic law and tradition having {{a major influence on}} the curriculum. Today, there is one elementary school (Bani Zeid Elementary School) and one secondary school (Bashir al-Barghouti Secondary School) in the town of Bani Zeid, both run by the government. According to the Palestinian Ministry of Education and Higher Education, in the 2010-2011 academic year there were 26 classes occupied by 691 students, both male and female. There was 45 teaching staff. There are no kindergartens in Bani Zeid. The closest institution for higher learning is Birzeit University in the village of Bir Zeit to the southeast.|$|E
5|$|Ernest, Hereditary Prince of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, {{was born}} at Ehrenburg Palace in Coburg on 21 June 1818. He was the elder son of Ernest III, Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld and his first wife Princess Louise of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg. He was soon joined by a brother, Prince Albert, who would later become the husband of Queen Victoria. Though Duke Ernest fathered {{numerous}} children in various affairs, the two <b>boys</b> <b>would</b> have no other legitimate siblings. In 1826, their father succeeded as Ernest I, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha through an exchange of territories {{after the death of}} the duke's uncle, Frederick IV, Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg.|$|E
5|$|On January 30, 2017, the Boy Scouts of America {{announced}} that transgender <b>boys</b> <b>would</b> {{be allowed to}} enroll in boys-only programs, effective immediately. Previously, the sex listed on an applicant's birth certificate determined eligibility for these programs; going forward, the decision {{would be based on}} the gender listed on the application. Joe Maldonado became the first openly transgender boy to join the Scouts on February 7, 2017. In 2016, he was rejected from the Boy Scouts for being transgender, but the policy was changed after his story became nationally known.|$|E

5|$|Young Aurobindo {{was brought}} up {{speaking}} English but used Hindustani to communicate with servants. Although his family were Bengali, his father believed British culture to be superior. He and his two elder siblings {{were sent to the}} English-speaking Loreto House boarding school in Darjeeling, in part to improve their language skills and in part to distance them from their mother, who had developed a mental illness soon after the birth of her first child. Darjeeling was a centre of British life in India and the school was run by Irish nuns, through which the <b>boys</b> <b>would</b> have been exposed to Christian religious teachings and symbolism.|$|E
5|$|A week-long {{visit to}} White House Farm had been {{arranged}} for the August at the Bambers' request; the plan was that the <b>boys</b> <b>would</b> visit their grandparents with Sheila before going on holiday to Norway with their father. Daniel and Nicholas were reluctant {{to stay at the}} farm. They disliked that June made them pray, and in the car on the way asked their father to speak to her about it. In addition Daniel had become a vegetarian and was worried about being forced to eat meat. When their father dropped them off at the house on 4 August, {{it was the last time}} he saw them. The boys are buried together in Highgate Cemetery. Sheila was cremated, and the casket with her ashes was placed in their coffin.|$|E
5|$|As the SAS {{operation}} concluded, the Chinooks ferried {{prisoners and}} bodies from Gberi Bana to the Jordanian battalion of UNAMSIL. From there, the bodies would {{be identified and}} buried, and those prisoners identified as West Side <b>Boys</b> <b>would</b> be {{handed over to the}} Sierra Leonean Police. Operation Barras also freed 22 Sierra Leonean civilians who had been held captive by the West Side Boys—the men were used as servants and put through crude military training by the West Side Boys, possibly with the intention of forcing them to fight in the future, while the women were used as sex slaves. Planners had been concerned that West Side Boys might try to conceal themselves among the civilians and so the civilians were also restrained and taken to the Jordanian peacekeepers' base to be identified. A 23rd civilian was caught in the crossfire and killed during the assault.|$|E

Once he had handed it to Nosmo, Nosmo would say to him [...] "how much do I owe you" [...] and the <b>boy</b> <b>would</b> say [...] "2 nicker" [...] whilst flicking the V at him (meaning to show the 2 fingers), Nosmo took it as an insult and <b>would</b> slap the <b>boy</b> across the face and then the <b>boy</b> <b>would</b> slap across the face back.|$|R

5|$|The work {{performed}} by breaker boys was hazardous. Breaker boys {{were forced to}} work without gloves {{so that they could}} better handle the slick coal. The slate, however, was sharp, and breaker <b>boys</b> <b>would</b> often leave work with their fingers cut and bleeding. Breaker boys sometimes also had their fingers amputated by the rapidly moving conveyor belts. Others lost feet, hands, arms, and legs as they moved among the machinery and became caught under conveyor belts or in gears. Many were crushed to death, their bodies retrieved from the gears of the machinery by supervisors only {{at the end of the}} working day. Others were caught in the rush of coal, and crushed to death or smothered. Dry coal would kick up so much dust that breaker boys sometimes wore lamps on their heads to see, and asthma and black lung disease were common. Coal was often washed to remove impurities, which created sulfuric acid. The acid burned the hands of the breaker boys.|$|E

25|$|The {{festival is}} {{traditionally}} celebrated by boys throwing water over girls they like and spanking them with pussy willows. <b>Boys</b> <b>would</b> sneak into girls' homes at daybreak on Easter Monday and throw containers of water over {{them while they}} were still in bed. This was usually accompanied by a rhyme; in the Polish-American community of Pine Creek, Wisconsin, the <b>boys</b> <b>would</b> chant Dyngus, dyngus, po dwa jaja; nie chcę chleba tylko jaja ("Dyngus, dyngus, for two eggs; I don't want bread, only eggs").|$|E

25|$|A form {{of forced}} {{conversion}} became institutionalized during the Ottoman Empire {{in the practice}} of devşirme, a human levy in which Christian boys were seized and collected from their families (usually in the Balkans), enslaved, converted to Islam, and then trained as elite military unit within the Ottoman army or for high-ranking service to the sultan. From the mid to late 14th, through early 18th centuries, the devşirme–janissary system enslaved an estimated 500,000 to one million non–Muslim adolescent males. These <b>boys</b> <b>would</b> attain a great education and high social standing after their training and conversion.|$|E
