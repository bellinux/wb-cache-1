40|$|The {{possibility}} {{of increasing the}} age at which Social Security benefits are first paid merits renewed scrutiny for at least three reasons: • a decrease in overall benefits would imply that those claiming reduced benefits before the 'full benefits age' may accept benefits that seem adequate when claimed but are insufficient when income earnings ends and savings are depleted; • life expectancy has increased; and • an enlarged labor force would increase potential national income and ameliorate projected future deficits. This paper examines differences in personal circumstances between those who retire and those who remain at work for pay at various ages. The findings, based on the Health and Retirement Survey, are that there are differences between these two groups, but they are rather small. Some who claim retirement benefits before the full benefits age would face serious hardship if those benefits were no longer available, however. For that reason, if the age of initial eligibility is increased, consideration should be given to measures targeted on this group. The paper then goes on to consider <b>back-up</b> <b>protections</b> that might be provided to those who now claim early retirement benefits should the age of initial eligibility be increased. ...|$|R
40|$|In 14 th August 2003, the Northeast USA {{suffered}} {{its worst}} power outage event in history. The power disturbance spreading {{through the system}} caused mal-trips of the distance relay remote <b>back-up</b> <b>protections,</b> which indeed contributed to the power outage cascading a wide area. The power outage in the Northeast USA was constrained {{by the presence of}} HVDC interconnections between the HVAC networks in Ontario and New York. The system collapse did not progress beyond the HVDC interconnection interface with Quebec. The HVDC link can regulate the voltage and current therefore impacts on the performance of the protection and system stability. The distance relay mal-operations were one of the main cause of the Northeast USA blackout {{as well as the other}} recent major large area blackouts which were pointed out by the previous papers.

The research work was carried out by modelling and testing a classic signal processing distance relay in a simple AC network which was based on Kunder’s two areas system using MATLAB/SIMULINK at first. Then the modeled distance relay’s performance was investigated by combining the distance relay and a simple HVDC link based on the Kunder’s two areas system. The research work firstly combined the signal processing distance relay and the HVDC link together to investigate the distance relay’s performance when the protected feeder containing DC link.

40|$|To {{monitor and}} protect the power system the energy flow is to be measure. To connect a meter, relay or other current sensing device in series with a large current source would be impractical. Current Transformer is a device that {{has been around for}} a long time and will monitor the {{electrical}} power system. The current transformer is measuring device to determine current flow in a power system. For the reliable and correct operation of the protection relays, the current transformer has to be carefully chosen. The distortion of the secondary current of a saturated CT may endanger the operation, selectivity and co-ordination of the protection. This dissertation proposing the selection of a CT, thus enables fast and reliable protection. In this dissertation the calculation of the actual accuracy limit factor (ALF) for protection type (P) current transformer (CT) is described. First the calculation of the Voltage knee point and the burden of the CT, including connection wires and protection relay impedance, are presented. The scope of this calculation involves the cost, value and the safety of protection in power. The CT accuracy primary limit current defines the highest fault current magnitude at which the CT will need the specified accuracy. Beyond this level, the secondary current of the CT will be distorted, and this may cause severe effects on the performance of the protection relay. This dissertation is based on PMU PERLING substation and all the CT data are collected accordingly for calculation purposes.

Proposed ANN based method was tested with huge number of fault cases by varying different fault parameters. Test results shows that proposed relaying schemes can provide primary as well as <b>back-up</b> <b>protection</b> to the forward and reverse line sections respectively. Reach setting of the relay is 99.5 % and fault detection time is half cycle {{in most of the}} cases. As speed of the relay is an important criterion in directional relaying, proposed ANN based method will be efficient to use. The results based on extensive study indicate that the proposed scheme can reliably protect the transmission line against different fault situations and thus, is a potential candidate for effective protection measure. Moreover, the proposed scheme correctly identifies the faulty section and its direction when tested with real time fault events. Thus it can be implemented for protection of real power system networks as well.|$|E
40|$|Disturbance {{recordings}} {{are used}} together with {{sequence of events}} (SOE) data to document and understand a power system fault; to manually verify the behaviour of digital protection relay; and nowadays, to perform automatic fault analysis (AFA) {{for the sake of}} fast and accurate fault location and to assist fault analysis engineers in their task. This paper focuses on two additional uses of the disturbance recordings. The general purpose is to gain insight into the condition of the monitorable assets using information from recorded signals. The authors suggest that each significant power system event provides an opportunity to verify that key processes behave within their design limits. The first field of application is circuit breaker monitoring. If sampled currents are recorded, it is shown that a system can monitor virtually all switching events, provide some alerts in near real-time if some critical conditions are found, and produce history data that are usable for long-term statistics in asset management systems. The second area of interest is automatic monitoring of protection schemes. The paper presents a literature survey about this topic, then it describes a methodology to verify major protection scheme automatically, on the occasion of every recorded short-circuit fault occurring in the grid, provided that enough event-related data are collected. The verifications consider essential design targets like maximum fault clearance time, phase-segregated tripping, maximum allowable time delay of teleprotection signals, pick-up for <b>back-up</b> <b>protection</b> of distant lines, etc. This process may issue some alerts or warnings for immediate consideration by fault analysts, drawing their attention on potential weaknesses of the protection system that may have severe consequences on security. But the main use of the presented technology is to generate statistical inputs for off-line verification of the protection behaviour on a large scale, since utilities routinely manage thousands of protection relays. Monitoring of their field performance complements routine protection testing very nicely. As an example, a relay that picked up recently and correctly hardly requires testing, except a verification of the tripping circuit. On the other hand, a distance relay that failed to pick up in protection zone 3 or 4, to provide <b>back-up</b> <b>protection</b> of a remote line, may be considered for an early inspection even if its self-check functions indicate that the device is operating.

The relays in the power system should be coordinated correctly so as to prevent mal-operation and therefore to avoid the unneeded outage of healthy section of the system.

A {{possible}} {{lower cost}} alternative to medium voltage line arresters and parallel-connected surge arresters {{is the use}} of parallel-connected spark gaps across a metal oxide surge arrester. The function of the spark gap is to protect the transformer when the surge arrester fails. Clearly the breakdown voltage characteristics of such a gap need to be carefully co-ordinated with the transformer insulation and those of the arrester. Eskom (Electricity Supply Commission of South Africa) is the national electrical utility that provides the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity in South Africa. The majority of Eskom's electricity reticulation is done with either 11 kV or 22 kV electrical overhead networks. An unacceptable number of Eskom's pole mounted power transformers on these networks have failed over the past few years. The high failure rate of Distribution transformers in Eskom, South Africa has previously been highlighted and investigated in an MSc thesis, the most recent being the thesis completed at the University of KwaZulu-Natal by Chatterton [6]. The thesis proposed possible solutions to the problem but experienced high implementation costs and particular technical issues before widespread implementation could prove viable for the Distribution System. The average transformer failure rate for the Distribution Eastern Region for the twelve month period taken as a moving average was calculated to be 5. 19 % per annum at the end of November 2005 and 3. 84 % at the end of November 2006. (Eskom Eastern Region Plant report, November 2006). International norms seem to indicate that a transformer failure rate of between 0. 5 % and 1. 0 % per annum is acceptable, Chatterton [6]. The reason for the increased failure rates during 2005 was attributed to incorrect Ground Lead Disconnect (GLD) specifications by one of the major surge arrester manufacturers. The incorrect GLD specifications have resulted in premature and nuisance operations. These were triggered by low intensity lightning storms {{as a result of the}} lower threshold trigger values. These premature operations have left numerous transformers vulnerable for periods as long as six months and have resulted in the transformer failures increasing from 2. 4 % quoted by Chatterton [6] in 2002 to 5. 19 % in 2005 and a reduction to 3. 84 % in November 2006 once the problem was identified and the GLDs corrected. See annexure A, Figure A 1 of the Plant report for November 2006 for performance details. Hence, this manufacturing flaw and the GLD's sensitivity to specification necessitate further investigation into the spark gap as <b>back-up</b> <b>protection.</b> The spark gap therefore becomes more viable than line or double surge arresters due to its cost effectiveness and robustness. This thesis was based on an idea proposed by Eskom's (Industrial Association Resource Centre) IARC. The aim was to investigate the technical feasibility of using a spark gap to grade with a distribution class surge arrester whilst the surge arrester was operational. The purpose of the spark gap was to act as <b>back-up</b> <b>protection</b> when the arrester fails. Experimentation was undertaken via simulation using the FEMLAB software to model the most suitable gap and geometry for a given rod diameter. The breakdown characteristic of the rod was well understood and verified. Thus, the results obtained from the simulation were compared against the laboratory experiments for the same rod diameters and tip shapes used in the simulation. The results have been analyzed to determine whether the spark gap is a feasible solution for use with surge arresters to protect the transformer from induced strikes following arrester failure. A possible lower cost alternative to medium voltage line arresters and parallel-connecte...|$|E
30|$|If the {{previous}} scheme designs of substation area protection and wide area protection are adopted directly {{to address the}} need, there will be lots of problems in suitability and reliability. Mounts of previous works focused on substation protection. A novel reliability modeling and analysis methodology were proposed in [5] for modern substation protection systems. An integrated control and protection system are proposed in [6] with a hierarchical coordination control strategy. In [7], a substation backup protection scheme based on multiple limitedly overlapped divisions was proposed. In general, the integrated protection or the substation area protection usually acts as <b>back-up</b> <b>protection</b> of substation, especially in high voltage systems. However, the reliability {{of this type of}} structure is still in doubt, related technologies and strategies cannot directly apply to such a design that integrates the primary equipment and secondary device into an entity. Although seldom adopted in substation area protection, the distributed protection mode is widely accepted in the field of wide area protection. In [8], a study of communication was presented based on wide area agents for primary and backup coordinated protection. A multi-agent based adaptive wide area current differential protection system was proposed in [9]. In [10], a faulted element identification algorithm was proposed based on multisource information fusion for wide area protection. A novel wide area backup protection algorithm was presented in [11] using information shared across wide area communication networks. In [12], a multi-agent system based wide area protection and control scheme was proposed to deal with the long-term voltage instability induced cascading trips. The researches on distributed protection are valuable for the integration of primary or secondary devices and for that an agent or a distributed unit works in the same way in the wide area or the substation area. However, the intelligent secondary devices designed to be placed in substation master control room cannot well match the life span of primary devices. Besides, their adaptation for strong electromagnetic interference and atrocious operation environment is yet to be testified [13]. Therefore, there are lots of problems in feasibility and reliability of the integration of primary device and secondary device in the same equipment.|$|E
