5|$|At {{the inauguration}} of its new {{assembly}} line, the 767's order <b>backlog</b> numbered approximately 50, only enough for production to last until 2013. Despite the reduced <b>backlog,</b> Boeing officials expressed optimism that additional orders would be forthcoming. On February 24, 2011, the USAF announced its selection of the KC-767 Advanced Tanker, an upgraded variant of the KC-767, for its KC-X fleet renewal program. The selection followed two rounds of tanker competition between Boeing and Airbus parent EADS, and came eight years after the USAF's original 2003 announcement of its plan to lease KC-767s. The tanker order encompassed 179 aircraft and was expected to sustain 767 production past 2013.|$|E
5|$|On July 27, 2016, in its {{quarterly}} {{report to the}} Securities and Exchange Commission, Boeing discussed the potential termination of 747 production due to insufficient demand and market for the aircraft. With a firm order <b>backlog</b> of 21 aircraft and a production rate of six per year, program accounting {{has been reduced to}} 1,555 aircraft, and the 747 line could be closed {{in the third quarter of}} 2019. In October 2016, UPS Airlines ordered 14 -8Fs to add capacity, along with 14 options, which doubles its official <b>backlog</b> of 15 – including some to refractory airlines – and could extend production by two more years.|$|E
30|$|When {{shortages}} occur, some of {{the customers}} are willing to wait and others could turn to buy from other retailers. The inventory model of deteriorating items with time-proportional <b>backlogging</b> rate has been developed by Chang and Dye (1999) and Dye et al. (2007) who studied shortages and partial <b>backlogging</b> in an inventory system. Min and Zhou (2009) derived a perishable inventory model under stock-dependent selling rate and partial <b>backlogging</b> with capacity constraint. Tripathy and Pradhan (2010) developed an inventory model with partial <b>backlogging</b> with Weibull deterioration. Cheng et al. (2011) developed inventory model for deteriorating items with trapezoidal demand and partial <b>backlogging.</b> Ahamed et al. (2013) developed inventory model with ramp-type demand and partial <b>backlogging.</b> Readers are referred to Taleizadeh et al.

40|$|The main {{result of}} this paper is to provide an O(n 3) {{algorithm}} for the single item constant capacity lotsizing problem with <b>backlogging</b> and a general number of installable batches, i. e in each time period t we may install up to mt multiples of the batch capacity, where the mt are given and are time-dependent. This generalizes earlier results [12, 16] as we consider <b>backlogging</b> and a general number of installable batches. We also give faster algorithms for three special cases of this general problem. When <b>backlogging</b> is not allowed and the costs satisfy the Wagner-Whitin property the problem is solvable in O(n 2 logn) time. In the discrete case it is possible to solve the problem with and without <b>backlogging</b> in O(n 2) and O(n 2 logn) time respectively. lotsizing, complexity, constant capacity, <b>backlogging...</b>|$|R
5|$|A {{controversial}} plan, {{known as}} the Major Moves plan, was passed in 2006. The Indiana Toll Road was leased to Statewide Mobility Partners, a joint venture company owned by Spanish firm Cintra and Australia's Macquarie Infrastructure Group for 75 years {{in exchange for a}} one time payment of $3.85 billion. The measure was opposed by most Democrats, who began an advertising campaign accusing Daniels of selling the road to foreign nations. The income from the lease was used to finance a <b>backlog</b> of public transportation projects and create a $500 million trust fund to generate revenue for the maintenance of the highway system.|$|E

In addition, the Navy intercept station in the islands, known as Station CAST, had an ultra secret Purple cipher machine, which decrypted Japanese diplomatic messages, and partial codebooks for the latest JN-25 naval code. Station CAST sent MacArthur its entire output, via Sutherland, the only officer on his staff authorized to see it.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The {{stochastic}} network calculus is {{an analytical}} tool which was mainly developed to compute tail bounds on <b>backlogs</b> and delays. From these, bounds on average <b>backlogs</b> and delays are derived {{in the literature}} by integration.

30|$|Next, {{the greedy}} status of each station can be {{determined}} by detecting the dropped or <b>backlogged</b> packets on both uplink and downlink queues in each station. Dropped and <b>backlogged</b> packets can be detected by periodically observing the statistics of each packet queue from the tc command on the access router. If there is a dropped or <b>backlogged</b> packet on any queue, it implies that the queue does not satisfy its desired rate and indicates that it is greedy.|$|R

In 2006, Biman took the unprecedented step of removing the business–class seats from its dedicated Hajj flights to accommodate more economy-class passengers. Procedural irregularities by the Hajj agencies delayed the confirmation of pilgrims' visas, and Biman had to cancel 19 flights owing to lack of sufficient passengers. Once the situation was resolved, Biman was then unable to offer the required number of flights {{to cope with the}} <b>backlog</b> of passengers.|$|E

5|$|In 1884, a {{deputation}} led by Lord Shaftesbury {{was made}} to the Great Eastern Railway and Great Northern Railway, proposing that for trains due to arrive in central London prior to 8am, third class tickets should be sold at a fare of 3d providing the return journey was not made before 4pm. By May 1885 both railways had adopted this policy. However, the delays and uncertainty caused by the fares dispute had discouraged prospective tenants, leaving large numbers of properties vacant and causing further building work to slow considerably. In 1887, construction work was temporarily suspended altogether, {{in response to the}} large <b>backlog</b> of un-let properties.|$|E

Assembly began in 1917 and the first, No.790, emerged in July of that year. It was based at Bricklayers Arms depot, preceding the earlier Nclass design into service by one month. Further construction was deferred until after Ashford had caught up with the maintenance <b>backlog</b> caused by the war.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{second to}} the 747 as Boeing's most {{profitable}} jetliner, the 777 became the company's most lucrative model in the 2000s. Program sales accounted for an estimated US$400million of Boeing's pretax earnings in 2000, US$50million more than the 747. By 2004, the airliner comprised the bulk of wide-body revenues for the Boeing Commercial Airplanes division. In 2007, orders for second-generation 777 models approached 350 aircraft, and in November of that year, Boeing announced that all production slots were sold out to 2012. The program <b>backlog</b> of 356 orders was valued at US$95billion at list prices in 2008.|$|E
5|$|Mindful of {{the long}} time {{required}} to bring the 777X to the market, Boeing continued to develop improvement packages which improve fuel efficiency, as well as lower prices for the existing product.

In January 2015, United Airlines ordered 10 Boeing 777-300ERs, normally costing around $150 million each but paid around $130 million, a discount to bridge the production gap to the 777X.|$|E

When <b>backlogging</b> is not allowed and the costs satisfy the Wagner-Whitin property, the problem is solvable in O(n(2) log n) time.
