Many different terms exist for the charges laid and include statutory rape, illegal carnal knowledge, or corruption of a minor. In some cases, sexual activity with someone above the legal age-of-consent <b>but</b> <b>beneath</b> the age of majority can be punishable under laws against contributing to the delinquency of a minor.|$|E
25|$|<b>But,</b> <b>beneath</b> the surface, resentment was {{building}} among the socii about their second-class status as peregrini i.e. non-citizens (except for the Latin colonists, who could regain their citizenship by moving to Roman territory). The Roman military confederation now became {{a victim of}} its own success in forging a united nation out of the patchwork of ethnicities and states. The socii rebelled en masse, including many that had remained steadfast in the past, launching the so-called Social War. But, unlike on previous occasions, their aim was to join the Roman state as equal citizens, not to secede from it. Although the socii were defeated on the battlefield, they gained their main demand. By {{the end of the}} war in 88 BC, all inhabitants of peninsular Italy had been granted the right to apply for Roman citizenship.|$|E

He also wrote that [...] "out of the cruelty and stupidity of the Old Russia nothing could ever emerge, <b>but</b> (...) <b>beneath</b> the cruelty and stupidity of the New Russia a speck of the ideal may lie hid", which together with other comments may be construed as anti-Russian and antisemitic.|$|E

500|$|Stephen Holden of The New York Times {{said that}} the album was [...] "refreshing", and that Collins was [...] "adept" [...] at setting a suspenseful or menacing mood. Holden {{described}} [...] "Only You Know and I Know" [...] as an [...] "angry love song" [...] that had some sampling of [...] "Motown" [...] style music mixed in. [...] "In 'One More Night', Mr. Collins's recent number-one hit, a ticking snare drum injects a whisper of lurking fear into a song that suggests a sweeter, tenderer reprise of 'Against All Odds'", says Holden. Holden concluded by saying [...] "On the surface, No Jacket Required, is an album bursting with soulful hooks and bright peppy tunes. <b>But</b> <b>beneath</b> its shiny exterior, Mr. Collins's drums and his voice carry on a disjunctive, enigmatic dialogue between heart and mind, obsession and repression." ...|$|E
500|$|Oxford's {{period of}} {{predominance}} was now at an end, and Anne turned to Bolingbroke and Marlborough {{to assume the}} reins of government and ensure a smooth succession. <b>But</b> <b>beneath</b> the weight of hostility the Queen's health, already fragile, rapidly deteriorated, and on 1 August 1714 (O.S.) – the day the Marlboroughs returned to England – she died. The Privy Council immediately proclaimed the Elector of Hanover King GeorgeI of England. The Jacobites had proved incapable of action; what Daniel Defoe called the [...] "solidity of the constitution" [...] had triumphed, and the regents chosen by George prepared for his arrival. The accession boded ill for the [...] "men of Utrecht" [...] – Bolingbroke and Oxford. Bolingbroke (a staunch Jacobite) fled to France, while vengeful Whigs pursued Oxford to the Tower. In contrast, Marlborough was received with the greatest cordiality. The new King had not entirely forgiven him his flirtations with Saint-Germain, {{and he had no}} intention of employing him in any but military capacities. However, reappointed as Captain-General, Master-General of Ordnance, and Colonel of the 1st Foot Guards, Marlborough once more became a person of influence and respect at court.|$|E

500|$|Upon release, Strange Days {{polarized}} film critics. Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film {{four out of}} four stars and described it as [...] "a technical tour de force... The pacing is relentless, and the editing, by Howard Smith, creates an urgency and desperation". He also highlighted the film's astute use of SQUID technology, stating that [...] "Bigelow is able to exploit the idea of what is happening; she forces her audience {{to deal with the}} screen reality, instead of allowing us to process it as routine 'action.'" [...] In a mixed review, Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a [...] "B-" [...] rating, concluding that Strange Days [...] "has a dazzling atmosphere of grunge futurism, <b>but</b> <b>beneath</b> its dark satire of audiovisual decadence lurks a naggingly conventional underworld thriller." [...] Edward Guthmann of San Francisco Chronicle criticized the film for failing to commentate its violence, saying that [...] "Bigelow's style is so visceral [...] that her movie reminds us of a snuff film, rather than a well-reasoned cautionary tale about our animal instincts." [...] New York magazine writer David Denby stated similar cons and called the rape scene [...] "the sickest sequence in modern movies".|$|E
500|$|Greatest Hits: My Prerogative {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from music critics. Mary Awosika of the Sarasota Herald-Tribune selected [...] "(I've Just Begun) Having My Fun" [...] {{as the best}} of the new tracks, and added that [...] "The rest of the album is a romp down memory lane of when Spears was the 'It' girl of popular culture, ruling the pop charts as a multi-million dollar entertainment should. [...] In all honesty, no one can deny Spears has recorded some great dance songs, and this album {{is the best way to}} get all the songs in one swoop". Faridul Anwar Farinordin of the New Straits Times said, [...] "rest assured, fans will surely grab this one" [...] and selected [...] "Oops!... I Did It Again" [...] and [...] "Overprotected" [...] as the best tracks. Annabel Leathes of BBC Online deemed it [...] "calorific as the KFC burgers dished up at her chav-style wedding; twenty finger lickin' tracks that mirror her trajectory from pretty pop puff to lusty strumpet". Christy Lemire of the Associated Press stated that it was premature for Spears to release a greatest hits album compilation after only five years, but highlighted [...] "I'm a Slave 4 U", [...] "Toxic" [...] and [...] "Everytime". Andy Petch-Jex of MusicOMH highlighted the first four tracks and commented [...] "true some of the tunes are complete pony plops, <b>but</b> <b>beneath</b> the occasional reek there beats a solid gold pop heart".|$|E

2500|$|Michael Berenbaum {{writes that}} Luther's {{reliance}} on the Bible as the sole source of Christian authority fed his later fury toward Jews over their rejection of Jesus as the messiah.

Graham Noble writes that Luther wanted to save Jews, in his own terms, not exterminate them, <b>but</b> <b>beneath</b> his apparent reasonableness toward them, there was a [...] "biting intolerance", which produced [...] "ever more furious demands for their conversion to his own brand of Christianity".

2500|$|His debut single, [...] "Should've Been a Cowboy", went {{to number}} 1 [...] on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart in 1993, in {{addition}} to reaching number 93 on the Billboard Hot 100. This song led off his self-titled debut album. By {{the end of the}} decade, [...] "Should've Been a Cowboy" [...] received more than three million spins at radio, thus making it the most-played country song of the 1990s. Certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments of one million copies, the album produced three more top 5 hits on the country charts: [...] "He Ain't Worth Missing" [...] at number 5, followed by [...] "A Little Less Talk and a Lot More Action" [...] (originally the B-side of [...] "Should've Been a Cowboy") and [...] "Wish I Didn't Know Now" [...] both at number 2. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic wrote of the album, [...] "It is given a production that's a bit too big, clean, glossy and cavernous for Keith's good — it fits the outsized sound of early-'90s radio, but not his outsized talent — <b>but</b> <b>beneath</b> that sheen the songs are very strong." [...] He also thought that it showed the signs of the style that Keith would develop on subsequent albums The album's success led to Keith touring with then-labelmates Shania Twain and John Brannen.|$|E
2500|$|Although some Antelope Creek {{people lived}} in the multi-family dwellings, more often they {{clustered}} in hamlets of individual homes {{with a population of}} not more than eight families. [...] Between hamlets were isolated farmsteads of one or two houses. [...] Most dwellings were located on terraces above the Canadian River or near a spring-fed stream or tributary. [...] The population in some areas was dense. [...] The five-mile long Buried City complex on Wolf Creek has more than 100 dwellings capable of housing 15–20 people each. [...] The dwellings are spaced about 100 yards from each other, thus resembling the settlement pattern of an American suburb with houses on large lots. [...] If all these dwellings were occupied at the same time, the population may have been 2,000. Along 50 miles of the Canadian River were more than 300 multi-family dwellings with a population that may have exceeded 10,000. [...] The total population of the Texas Panhandle during the Antelope Creek Phase may have amounted to as many as 30,000. Water can be scarce on the Great Plains, <b>but</b> <b>beneath</b> the surface is the Oglalla aquifer. The water of the Canadian River is salty, so the Antelope Creek people often lived where streams had cut 100 to 200 feet deep into the caprock and springs and small spring-fed watercourses were abundant and reliable. [...] Timber for building and fuel was found in these valleys and canyons.|$|E
2500|$|Reaction to {{the album}} in the U.S. was more {{enthusiastic}} {{than it had}} been for Byrdmaniax but still wasn't wholly positive. [...] Andy Mellen, reviewing the album in the Winnipeg Free Press in February 1972, noted [...] " [...] not being anywhere the equal of Younger Than Yesterday or even Dr. Byrds & Mr. Hyde, it is an encouraging LP, offering some assurance that Roger McGuinn and friends still have their fingers on the pulse of what's happening musically in 1972." [...] Ben Gerson commented on both the band and the album in the March 1972 issue of Rolling Stone magazine: [...] "There is a programmatic certainty to their music at this point which at first glance happily signifies that a first-generation band has successfully remade itself, but, after repeated exposure disappoints one with its inflexibility." [...] Gerson concluded his review of Farther Along by commenting [...] "This is not an outstanding album, either by Byrds or contemporary standards, though, for at least a Byrds fan, it contains several seductive tunes and some exemplary musicianship. <b>But</b> <b>beneath</b> the old Byrds sound, and this new, quartered approach, there is a more fundamental commitment, and that is to survival." [...] The question of The Byrds' continued existence was also echoed in a contemporary review by Bud Scoppa in the March 1972 edition of Rock magazine, in which he opined [...] "The Byrds recognized their failure on Byrdmaniax, but placed the blame on the lavish production job rather than their own disunity. [...] So what we have with Farther Along, evidently rushed out to rectify the problems caused by the last LP, is more disunity, but this time in a basic unadorned state." ...|$|E
