5|$|After boiling, the {{hopped wort}} is now cooled, {{ready for the}} yeast. In some breweries, the hopped wort may pass through a hopback, which is a small vat filled with hops, to add {{aromatic}} hop flavouring and {{to act as a}} filter; but usually the hopped wort is simply cooled for the fermenter, where the yeast is added. During fermentation, the wort becomes <b>beer</b> <b>in</b> a process which requires a week to months {{depending on the type of}} yeast and strength of the <b>beer.</b> <b>In</b> addition to producing ethanol, fine particulate matter suspended in the wort settles during fermentation. Once fermentation is complete, the yeast also settles, leaving the beer clear.|$|E

5|$|The {{purpose of}} brewing is {{to convert the}} starch source into a sugary liquid called wort and to convert the wort into the {{alcoholic}} beverage known as <b>beer</b> <b>in</b> a fermentation process effected by yeast.|$|E
5|$|Yeast is the {{microorganism}} that {{is responsible}} for fermentation in beer. Yeast metabolises the sugars extracted from grains, which produces alcohol and carbon dioxide, and thereby turns wort into <b>beer.</b> <b>In</b> addition to fermenting the beer, yeast influences the character and flavour.|$|E
5|$|Guinness Flavour Extract, a dehydrated, {{hopped wort}} extract made from barley malt and roasted barley, {{is used for}} {{overseas}} production of the stout.

5|$|In 2000, a {{total of}} 500 barrels were produced; this was {{forecast}} to grow to 1,000 barrels by 2009.

It also produces other Worthington beers such as Red Shield and seasonal beers. In 2012, increasing demand saw White Shield production moved to the main Coors brewery in Burton.

5|$|The {{story begins}} on April Fools' Day as Homer is playing pranks on Bart {{throughout}} the day. Bart, {{angered by the}} numerous tricks he has fallen for, attempts to get revenge by shaking up a <b>beer</b> <b>in</b> a paint shaker. When Homer opens the beer, it results in a massive explosion that puts him in the hospital, paralyzed {{and placed in a}} wheelchair. While everyone waits for Homer to get well, the family remembers surviving similar hardships, shown in the form of clips from past episodes.|$|E
5|$|The temperance {{movement}} {{remained a}} strong influence though, and when new breweries were set up, the outcry led to the Welsh Sunday Closing Act in 1881, an act that forced the closure of public houses in Wales on a Sunday. Wales' passion for beer remained; the Wrexham Lager Beer Company opened in 1881, as the first lager producer in Britain. The Felinfoel Brewery {{made a deal with}} the local tin works and became the first brewery in Europe to put <b>beer</b> <b>in</b> cans.|$|E
5|$|Various legal {{definitions}} of beer exist in different countries. Historically, {{the most famous}} of these was the Reinheitsgebot, which applied to parts of the Holy Roman Empire and Germany and required beer to be made from only water, hops, and barley. Today in Canada, the Canadian Government’s Food and Drug Regulations state that beer must have alcohol content that ranges from 1.1% to 8.6%, though it also includes a stipulation that it could be greater than 8.6% and labeled accordingly. <b>Beer</b> <b>in</b> South Korea must have less than 25% ABV, which means {{that it has to be}} 25 mL of alcohol or less per 100 mL of solution and can be considered ‘lite’ only if it has less than 30 kcal per 100ml. Additionally, <b>beer</b> <b>in</b> South Korea must use only water, hops, and starches (wheat, rice, barley, corn, or potato) as ingredients in the brewing process. In Singapore, beer must have at minimum 1.0% alcohol by volume concentration at 20°C. It is often brewed from a mixture of grains like malt, sugars or its equivalent, and hops or other vegetables.|$|E

5|$|While {{a variety}} of beers are popular across Northern England, the region is {{especially}} associated with brown ales such as Newcastle Brown Ale, Double Maxim and Samuel Smith's Nut Brown Ale. <b>Beer</b> <b>in</b> the North is usually served with a thick head which accentuates the nutty, malty flavours preferred in Northern beers. On the non-alcoholic side, the North – in particular, Lancashire – was {{the hub of the}} temperance bar movement which popularised soft drinks such as dandelion and burdock, Tizer and Vimto.|$|E
5|$|For {{many years}} Burger King has sold <b>beer</b> <b>in</b> {{several of its}} {{international}} locations, such as Germany, but not in its home territory. The company began to sell beer at its BK Whopper Bar limited service concept restaurants in Miami, New York, and Los Angeles in 2010. The company is selling products from SABMiller and Anheuser-Busch, including Budweiser, Bud Lite, and Miller Lite in aluminum bottles designed to maintain temperature. The move, designed to target the important 30-and-under demographic, has been called risky by industry analysts because the company {{is known as a}} fast food purveyor and not as an alcoholic beverages seller. Other industry consultants have disagreed with the assessment, believing that the move is timely because the company is growing with its aging customer base.|$|E
5|$|The O'Brien Brewing and Malting Company, {{also known}} as the Klondike Brewery, was a brewery founded by Thomas O'Brien in Klondike City, an {{adjoining}} settlement to Dawson City, Yukon Territory, Canada from 1904 to 1919. It was established during a period in which Dawson City was expected to become an important regional city, and used modern techniques and equipment imported from California. It was initially successful, selling 68,748 gallons of <b>beer</b> <b>in</b> 1905, but Dawson's population declined and growing temperance attitudes threatened the business. O'Brien sold the company in 1915, and in 1919 prohibition forced its closure. The brewery was abandoned, and the remains of the site are now owned by the Tr'ondek Hwech'in First Nation.|$|E
