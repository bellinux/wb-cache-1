This study was conduced to evaluate the prevalence of iron deficiency and its related factors in <b>blood</b> <b>donors</b> at Shiraz <b>blood</b> transfusion centre in 2005. Methods: This descriptive study was done on all <b>blood</b> <b>donors</b> who donated their blood at Shiraz BTO in 2005. We selected 200 first time <b>blood</b> <b>donors</b> (100 female & 100 male), 200 <b>blood</b> <b>donors</b> who had history of one blood donation every year for at least 3 years and 200 <b>blood</b> <b>donors</b> who had history of 3 to 4 times blood donation per year. Then we filled out a questionnaire and measured Hb, ferretin, MCV and MCHC. Results: The results showed that reduction in iron stores was directly related to the number of donations. (P< 0. 05). In this study, 34 % of female first time <b>blood</b> <b>donors</b> and 11. 9 % of male first time donors had decreased iron stores. 34 % of female first time <b>blood</b> <b>donors,</b> 47. 9 % of female <b>blood</b> <b>donors</b> with history of one blood donation a year and 77 % of female <b>blood</b> <b>donors</b> who had history of 3 time blood donations in one year had decreased levels of iron. 11. 9 % of male first time <b>blood</b> <b>donors,</b> 14. 5 % of male <b>blood</b> <b>donors</b> who had history of one blood donation a year and 37. 5 % of male <b>blood</b> <b>donors</b> who had history of 3 blood donations every year had iron deficiency or iron deficiency anemia. Conclusion: It seems that blood donation affects the iron status and if not compensated, it may cause complication in <b>blood</b> <b>donors.</b> The prevalence of iron deficiency in female <b>blood</b> <b>donors</b> is more who therefore require more attention. Iron store levels are more related to number of blood donations per year rather than the number of blood donations in a lifetime. Therefore, these donors as a group require more attention...|$|R

There is scarce {{information about the}} epidemiology of T. gondii {{infection in}} <b>blood</b> <b>donors</b> in Mexico. Therefore, we sought to determine the prevalence of T. gondii infection and associated socio-demographic and behavioral characteristics in a population of healthy <b>blood</b> <b>donors</b> of Durango City, Mexico. Methods Four hundred and thirty two <b>blood</b> <b>donors</b> in two public blood banks of Durango City, Mexico were examined for T. gondii infection between August to September 2006. <b>Blood</b> <b>donors</b> were tested for anti- T. gondii IgG and IgM antibodies by using enzyme-linked immunoassays (Diagnostic Automation Inc., Calabasas, CA, USA). Socio-demographic and behavioral characteristics from each participant were also obtained. Results Thirty two (7. 4 %) of 432 <b>blood</b> <b>donors</b> had IgG anti- T. gondii antibodies. Eight (1. 9 %) of them had also IgM anti- T. gondii antibodies. Multivariate analysis using logic regression showed that T. gondii infection {{was associated with the}} presence of cats at home (adjusted OR = 3. 81; 95 % CI: 1. 45 – 10. 01). The age group of 45 – 60 years showed a significantly higher frequency of T. gondii infection than the group of 25 – 34 years (p = 0. 02). <b>Blood</b> <b>donors</b> without education had a significantly higher frequency of infection (15. 8 %) than those with 13 – 19 years of education (4. 5 %) (p = 0. 04).

The prevalence of SEN virus in otherwise healthy individuals, including <b>blood</b> <b>donors,</b> differs markedly by geographic region.

Methods: Sera of 260 <b>blood</b> <b>donors</b> who were negative for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and third-generation hepatitis C virus antibody (anti-HCV) were tested for SEN virus-D and-H DNA.

Results: SEN virus-D viremia was detected in four (1. 5 %) of the 260 <b>blood</b> <b>donors</b> (95 % confidence interval (CI), 0. 0 – 3 %). SEN virus-H viremia was detected in 47 (18. 08 %) of the 260 <b>blood</b> <b>donors</b> (95 % CI, 13. 4 – 22. 8 %).
