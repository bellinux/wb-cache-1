2500|$|By 1817, the Pinkerton Academy {{accepted}} {{young women}} as well. An advertisement placed on May 17, 1817, in the Farmer's Cabinet, the only newspaper {{of the era}} serving that part of New Hampshire, stated, [...] "The female apartment in this academy will be opened on Monday the 26th of May, instant; wherein will be taught all the useful and ornamental branches of female instruction usually attended in similar institutions. At the same time an additional instructor will {{be placed in the}} male apartment. The tuition is two dollars a quarter. Board may be had in respectable families, within a convenient distance of the Academy, on reasonable terms." [...] According to the New Hampshire Historical Society, preceptresses of the academy were Sarah Fitz, 1816, Mary Knight, 1817–18, and Mary Adams, 1819. In 1821, Pinkerton stopped accepting young women, and the Adams Female Academy opened in Derry to educate young women. For the following years, the Scottish immigrants of Londonderry helped maintain the academy and also contributed funds for it. In 1853 the academy became coeducational with the erection of a ladies' <b>boarding</b> <b>hall.</b>|$|E

Nevertheless, the soft-spoken Abbot remained president for twenty-two years and helped stabilize the College {{during and after the}} Civil War. One of the College's main concerns was that its Morrill Act endowment had attracted the University of Michigan's attention. [...] Advocates for the University brought a bill before the State Legislature to merge with the Agricultural College and move the Lansing faculty and facilities to the Ann Arbor campus.

[...] Andrew Dickson White, Cornell University co-founder and first president, noted, “The State of Michigan [...] [...] [...] indeed gave its Agricultural College an excellent faculty and they have achieved much success considering their means but infinitely better would it have been to combine that Agricultural College with their noble University.” [...] While the plan initially had broad support across the state, merger opponents pointed out that Ann Arbor had inadequate facilities for an agricultural education; a move to Ann Arbor would require so much investment capital as to make the UM plan financially untenable. The Legislature voted down UM's proposal in 1863, but it returned to the floor in 1865, 1867, and again in 1869.

The school was called Tekijuku, where distinction of status was unknown and competition abounded. Ogata encouraged this competitive learning, especially of the Dutch language to which he had dedicated much of his own study. However, the competition escalated and eventually students bent to the rigorous pressure of the academy, acting recklessly to vent frustrations. For example: [...] "slashing their swords against the central pillar of the main <b>boarding</b> <b>hall,</b> leaving gashes and nicks".

50|$|The old station {{building}} {{stood on}} the site of the present-day town post office on Dr.-Konrad-Adenauer-Platz (lately Postplatz, formerly Bahnhofsplatz). The post office at first used the station building of the old station. At the start of the 20th century the station building was replaced by a new post office block, that still exists today. Directly behind the post office - on Hallplatz - is another large section of the original Einsteighalle (<b>boarding</b> <b>hall)</b> of the old station. Over the course of time the hall was slightly shortened. It serves today as a storage hall for vehicles of the volunteer fire service in Hof, the Freiwillige Feuerwehr Hof. In the yard of the former station on the edge of Hof's city centre there are still one or two former goods sheds. On the site of the first station the name of the restaurant, Alter Bahnhof opposite the post office recalls the existence of the old station as do plaques on the post office building and the Einsteighalle.|$|E
50|$|During one of {{the annual}} {{meetings}} on January 13, 1857, the Board of Trustees authorized the Executive Committee {{to plan for the}} creation of a new <b>Boarding</b> <b>Hall.</b> With an estimated cost of $10,000, on May 24, 1859, the Executive Committee voted {{for the creation of a}} new building across from Ballou. On May 29, 1860, they commissioned Thomas W. Silloway, a Boston architect who was also an ordained Unitarian clergyman to prepare plans and specifications for the new building. While he was primarily known for his ecclesiastical architecture, Silloway also secured commissions for public and higher education buildings. On May of 1861, the Executive Committee reported the completion of East Hall at a cost of $19,191.90. The larger than expected expense was funded by a $50,000 state pledge made in 1859. When it opened, it contained a central staircase from which double-loaded corridors extended. A dining facility known as 'The Dive' was moved from Packard Hall to the basement, along with a kitchen and washroom, due to its advantage of being on the hill side with three walls having windows. It was used as the Commons dining hall for Tufts until the construction of Commons Hall, now Curtis Hall, in 1893. The interior has been remodeled several times in 1937, 1945, and 1966. During World War II it was put to military use where each of the two-person suites were converted to three-person rooms. and in 1966, it was converted from a men's dormitory and became the academic headquarters for the Departments of English, German and the Romance Languages. In 1989 with the construction of Olin Hall, the German and Romance Language Departments moved out, being replaced by the Department of History.|$|E

40|$|Albert Gardner Boyden, who {{assumed the}} principalship of Bridgewater in 1860 {{and served in}} that post for forty-six years, had been {{assistant}} to Tillinghast and Conant, and so was well-prepared for his duties. In his years as principal, the school underwent a tremendous change and expansion {{to meet the needs}} of the times. A native of South Walpole, Massachusetts, where he was born on February 5, 1927, he had taught school for several years before coming to Bridgewater to study under Mr. Tillinghast. After completing his course, Mr. Boyden was invited to stay on as an assistant in the school, which he did from August, 1850, to October, 1853, when he left to serve in the public schools for four years. He returned to the college as Mr. Conant’s first assistant in 1857. In Mr. Boyden’s administration, the curriculum of the school underwent a radical change. College-level courses were added, particularly in the sciences, mathematics, and in psychology, a four-year course of study was introduced, and the school developed an amazing expansion and building program. A model school was constructed, laboratories and classified collections in the sciences were obtained, a science building was built, and the library holdings were increased extensively. Additional land was obtained, sometimes paid for by the principal out of his small salary, so that by the turn of the century the school owned fourteen acres. The original wooden building was enlarged in 1861 and again in 1871, then torn down and replaced by a large brick building in 1891, just after the semi-centennial anniversary of the school was commemorated. A <b>boarding</b> <b>hall</b> was built in 1869 and enlarged in 1873. To the normal school faculty came a succession of outstanding teachers, some to serve long terms and others to use the normal school as a stepping-stone for advancement in public education. Many students came from other states, and foreign students came from Armenia, Syria, Japan, Burma, Mexico, Brazil, Canada, and other countries, and returned to their homelands to spread the Bridgewater tradition. Only recently the college was visited by a great-grandson of one of these students, who told of the reverence with which the name of Boyden is held in his family to this day. A Japanese educator recently visited Bridgewater because he knew it as the training school of the famous Shuze Isawa, a Bridgewater graduate who is recognized as the founder of teacher education in Japan. Even after his official retirement in 1906, Mr. Boyden continued to serve the school as a part-time teacher and lecturer until his death in 1915. The best expression of his philosophy is found in the conclusion of his address at the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of Bridgewater Normal School. He said: “Let every graduate of the normal school and every friend of this country cherish these institutions with a jealous care and a generous support; and may all their graduates go forth in the spirit of Him who is the friend of all children and the master of all teachers, who came in this world not as the hireling cometh, but ‘that men might have life and that they might have it more abundantly,’ a more abundant physical, intellectual, emotional, and spiritual life, so that our public schools shall be a fountain of life, sending out its streams, to help perpetuate through all times the blessings of a Christian civilization. ”[URL]...|$|E
