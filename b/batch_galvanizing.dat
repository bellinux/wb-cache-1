50|$|Individual metal articles, such as steel girders or {{wrought iron}} gates, can be hot-dip {{galvanized}} {{by a process}} called <b>batch</b> <b>galvanizing.</b> Other modern techniques have largely replaced hot-dip for these sorts of roles. This includes electrogalvanizing, which deposits the layer of zinc from an aqueous electrolyte by electroplating, forming a thinner and much stronger bond.|$|E
40|$|There is a {{constant}} drive to improve automobiles by enhancing safety, reducing weight and containing cost. This, combined with a new focus on resource efficiency during manufacturing, forces role players to rethink and improve current processes and to develop novel manufacturing techniques. One such novel resource saving technique, currently being researched at the Chemnitz University of Technology and Fraunhofer IWU, combines a modified <b>batch</b> <b>galvanizing</b> process with a direct hot stamping process. In doing so it eliminates the tradetionally required surface coating process with its energy requirements. In this study the process uses molten zinc alloy at 850 °C to simultaneously heat and apply a corrosion protective coating to 22 MnB 5 for subsequent use in hot stamping. A CFX simulation was conducted {{in order to understand}} the thermal behaviour of the bath containing the alloy and the treated steel during the dipping process...|$|E
40|$|Corrosion {{tests of}} 1015 {{low-carbon}} steel and two stainless steels (410 and 316 L) {{were conducted in}} a pure zinc bath (99. 98 wt pct Zn) {{in order to better}} understand the reaction mechanisms that occur during the degradation of submerged hardware at industrial general (<b>batch)</b> <b>galvanizing</b> operations. Through this testing, it was found that, in general, 316 L stainless steel showed the best dissolution resistance among these three alloys, while 1015 carbon steel provided a lower solubility than 410 stainless steel. Investigating the failure mechanisms, both metallurgical composition and lattice structure played important roles in the molten metal corrosion behaviors of these alloys. High contents of nickel combined with the influence of chromium improved the resistance to molten zinc corrosion. Moreover, a face-centered-cubic (fcc) structure was more corrosion resistant than body-centered-cubic (bcc) possibly due to the compactness of the atomic structure. Analogously, the body-centered-tetragonal (bct) martensite lattice structure possessed enhanced susceptibility to zinc corrosion {{as a result of the}} greater atomic spacing and high strain energy. Finally, an increased bath temperature played an important role in molten metal corrosion by accelerating the dissolution process and changing the nature of intermetallic layers...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} has been undertaken {{to determine the}} major factors influencing the corrosion resistance of duplex-zinc coatings on steel substrates. Premature failure of these systems {{has been attributed to}} the presence of defects such as craters and pinholes in the polymer film and debonding of the polymer film from the zinc substrate. Defects found on commercially produced samples have been carefully characterised using metallographic and scanning electron microscopy techniques. The influence of zinc substrate surface roughness, polymer film thickness and degassing of conversion coatings films on the incidence of defects has been determined. Pretreatments of the chromate, chromate-phosphate, non chromate, and alkali-oxide types were applied and the conversion coatings produced characterised with respect to their nature and composition. The effect of degassing on the properties of the films was also investigated. Electrochemical investigations were carried out to determine the effect of the presence of the eta or zeta phase as the outermost layer of the galvanized coating. Flow characteristics of polyester on zinc electroplated hot-dip continuous and <b>batch</b> <b>galvanized</b> and zinc sprayed samples were investigated using hot-stage microscopy. The effects of different pretreatments and degassing after conversion coating formation on flow characteristics were determined. Duplex coatings were subjected to the acetic acid salt spray test. The effect on adhesion was determined using an indentation debonding test and the results compared with those obtained using cross-cut/peel and pull-off tests. The locus of failure was determined using scanning electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy techniques...|$|R
40|$|Segregation of {{aluminum}} and antimony of spangles on a <b>batch</b> hot-dip <b>galvanized</b> Zn- 0. 05 Al- 0. 2 Sb coating were investigated by {{scanning electron microscopy}} (SEM) in backscattered electron mode and with energy dispersive spectrometry, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Results showed that the coating surface displays shiny, feathery and dull spangles, in which considerable metallic oxides and precipitates are detected on coating surface. The metallic oxides on coating surface are identified as mainly ZnO and Al 2 O 3, whilst {{the nature of the}} precipitates is identified as Sb 3 Zn 4. Aluminum and antimony are enriched in layers within a thickness of 10 – 20 nm underneath the outer surface of the coating. The segregation behavior {{of aluminum}} and antimony is studied and discussed in terms of the solidification process of the coating...|$|R
40|$|This Reference Document on best {{available}} techniques in ferrous metals processing reflects an information exchange carried out according to Article 16 (2) of Council Directive 96 / 61 /EC. The document has {{to be seen in}} the light of the preface which describes the objectives of the document and its use. This BREF document consists of 4 Parts (A – D). Parts A to C cover the different industrial sub-sectors of the Ferrous Metals Processing sector: A, Hot and Cold Forming; B, Continuous Coating; C, <b>Batch</b> <b>Galvanizing.</b> This structure was chosen because of the differences in nature and scale of the activities covered by the term FMP. Part D does not cover an industrial sub-sector. It comprises the technical descriptions of a number of environmental measures which are techniques to be considered in the determination of BAT in more than one sub-sector. This was done to avoid repetition of technical descriptions in the three Chapters 4. These descriptions have to be viewed always in connection with the more specific information, referring to the application in individual sub-sectors, which is given in the relevant Chapter 4. Part A: Hot and Cold Formin...|$|E
