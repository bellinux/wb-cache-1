5|$|There {{were four}} classes when the {{championship}} started in 1949; 500cc, 350cc, 250cc and 125cc. The 50cc class {{was introduced in}} the 1962 season. Due to escalating costs that resulted in a number of manufacturers leaving the championship, the FIM limited the 50cc <b>bikes</b> to a single cylinder, the 125cc and 250cc <b>bikes</b> were limited to two cylinders and the 350cc and 500cc <b>bikes</b> were limited to four cylinders. The 350cc class was discontinued in 1982; two years later the 50cc class was replaced with an 80cc class, which was discontinued in 1989. In 2002, 990cc <b>bikes</b> replaced the 500c <b>bikes</b> and the class was renamed as MotoGP. 600cc <b>bikes</b> replaced the 250cc <b>bikes</b> in the 2010 season, with the class re-branded as Moto2.|$|E

50|$|A bicycle map or <b>bike</b> map is a map {{designed}} specifically for bicyclists. <b>Bike</b> maps often include features not on general purpose street maps such as <b>bike</b> lanes, <b>bike</b> paths, <b>bike</b> routes, <b>bike</b> shops, topographical features like major hills, etc. Earlier in the 20th century, <b>bike</b> maps {{tended to focus on}} showing pavement quality.|$|R
5|$|<b>Bikes</b> may {{experience}} {{a variety of}} longitudinal forces and motions. On most <b>bikes,</b> when the front wheel is turned to {{one side or the}} other, the entire rear frame pitches forward slightly, depending on the steering axis angle and the amount of trail. On <b>bikes</b> with suspensions, either front, rear, or both, trim is used to describe the geometric configuration of the bike, especially in response to forces of braking, accelerating, turning, drive train, and aerodynamic drag.|$|E

5|$|First {{proposed}} in 2008 by the New York City Department of Transportation, Citi Bike's scheduled 2011 opening was delayed by Hurricane Sandy and technological problems.

5|$|For most <b>bikes,</b> {{depending}} on geometry and mass distribution, capsize is stable at low speeds, and becomes less stable as speed increases {{until it is}} no longer stable. However, on many <b>bikes,</b> tire interaction with the pavement is sufficient to prevent capsize from becoming unstable at high speeds.|$|E

5|$|After a {{year away}} from the bike, Marchant {{returned}} to cycling and turned professional in 1958. Within a year he left for Europe with Ron Murray and Alan McLellan on the professional racing circuit. The trip was unsuccessful. The group did not take their track <b>bikes</b> with them, with Marchant ordering one from Italy. The equipment never arrived and he competed in Belgium and Copenhagen on borrowed <b>bikes.</b> Marchant only displayed glimpses of his ability, defeating the Italian champion in one outing and also winning the La Trobe race in Tasmania. Marchant then retired in 1961.|$|E
5|$|Although {{longitudinally}} stable when stationary, <b>bikes</b> {{often have}} a high enough center of mass and a short enough wheelbase to lift a wheel off the ground under sufficient acceleration or deceleration. When braking, depending on {{the location of the}} combined center of mass of the bike and rider with respect {{to the point where the}} front wheel contacts the ground, <b>bikes</b> can either skid the front wheel or flip the bike and rider over the front wheel. A similar situation is possible while accelerating, but with respect to the rear wheel.|$|E

50|$|Lastly, {{maintenance}} of the rider's <b>bike</b> needs {{to be carried out}} more frequently for mountain <b>biking</b> than for casual commuter <b>biking.</b> Mountain <b>biking</b> places higher demands on every part of the <b>bike.</b> Jumps and impacts can crack the frame or damage components or the tire rims, and steep, fast descents can quickly wear out brake pads. Thus, whereas a casual rider may only check over and maintain their <b>bike</b> every few months,a mountain biker should check and properly maintain the <b>bike</b> before and after every ride.|$|R
