40|$|Vent blocking, the {{covering}} of the filter ventilation zone on a cigarette during smoking, is a potentially {{important aspect of}} smoking behavior. Various techniques {{have been used to}} assess the incidence of vent blocking, and widely different views have been expressed on its importance. Studies relevant to filter vent blocking have been reviewed with two overall objectives: to examine critically the evidence on the occurrence of vent blocking and to assess the effects of vent blocking on the smoke yield to the smoker. The reviewed studies fall into four main categories: (1) measurements of the incidence of filter vent blocking among smokers; (2) the observed effects of vent blocking on cigarette ventilation and machine smoke yields; (3) the effect of experimentally blocking vents on human smoke yields; and (4) simultaneous determination of vent blocking and smoke yield under human smoking conditions. Direct observation indicates that only 4 % of smokers have their fingers in direct contact with the cigarette during puffing. Estimates of vent blocking incidence by lips during smoking range from 15 - 24 % (saliva-staining technique) to up to 50 % ('tar’ staining pattern technique) of smokers. For those smokers who do block the ventilation zone, a mean of 27 % of the vents are blocked, and a maximum of about 50 %. When the cigarettes are machine-smoked, the smoke yield increases in a highly non-linear manner as the blocked portion of the filter ventilation zone increases. This effect is also more pronounced at higher original filter ventilation levels. In contrast, smoking behavior monitoring techniques have shown that when the experimenter deliberately blocks the vent zone, the human smoker adjusts by taking smaller and fewer puffs. The <b>blocked</b> <b>filter</b> affects the yields of smoke components to the smoker less than it does smoking-machine measured yields. It is concluded that the incidence of vent zone blocking by fingers is quite low and relatively insignificant. The most reliable estimate for lip blocking is that up to 25 % of smokers may cover the vent zone during at least one puff and for most smokers the coverage is partial. Ventilation zone blocking as it occurs in practice has only a relatively minor effect on human smoke yields compared to other smoker behavior factors. When a human smoker inadvertently partially or completely blocks the filter ventilation zone during smoking, he/she adjusts by taking smaller and fewer puffs. Because of these changes in puffing behavior during human smoking, predictions of the effects of filter vent blocking on smoke yields based solely on smoking machine yields are deceptive...|$|E
40|$|Purpose - The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to come up with proposals that will reduce the amount off spec products that are produced at the in-container sterilization stage and to reduce the total water consumption of this particular stage at Propack, a subsidiary of Royal Friesland Foods. At the stage coffee supplements in bottles and dairy-based products in cans are treated. Furthermore, stage consists out of two nearly identical Stork hydrostatic sterilization towers, ‘C 4 ’ and ‘C 5 ’. Research limitations - The research was limited to a period of 5 months and the scope of {{this research}} was on the sterilization stage. Methodology – This research follows the regulative cycle. First the problem of off spec products is quantified with the use of production data. Theory about sterilization and product properties that are affected by this treatment is explored to gain insight in the process and the reasons why products are rejected. The backbone {{of this research is}} a comprehensive Root Cause Analysis (RCA). Various RCA tools are evaluated; eventually the Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) tool is selected. With the use of the FTA a number of presumptive causes that lead to off spec products are identified. These presumptive causes are verified with a variety of techniques and tools including interviews with directly and indirectly involved personnel, observations, tracer measurements and a Matlab simulation. Last step is the development of solutions for the identified root causes. Furthermore, a thorough system analysis, which is part of a FTA, showed opportunities to reduce the water consumption of the stage. Findings - The FTA resulted in 22 presumptive causes that could lead to the production of off spec products. After a thorough verification process 5 root causes were identified: (1) too much steam is injected in C 4 due to failing temperature controllers (2) the inlet water can be too cold (3) a <b>blocked</b> <b>filter</b> in the water circulation (4) the design of the products feed system (5) mistakes of operators while setting the sterilization temperature. Furthermore, a number of 3 external root causes have been identified but these were {{beyond the scope of this}} research and are therefore not further investigated. Regarding the water consumption; after analyzing the system it was found that C 4 uses significantly more water than C 5 (60 % to 40 % of the total consumption). It was found that this is also caused by the failing controllers of C 4. The company is advised to conduct a research to investigate the possibilities of water recycling at the stage. Solutions - Several solutions are proposed to solve the identified root causes. The most important proposal is the replacement of the instrumentation of the steam injection control schemes of C 4; this will lead to a reduction of off spec products and a reduction in water consumption; the Net Present Value of this solution is estimated to be nearly € 80. 000 over 5 years while the initial investments are € 7. 700. Other solutions include the installation of flow rate recorders and displays to improve process monitoring by operators; better monitoring enables earlier problem notification which reduces the impact the problem. To solve the problem with the cold inlet water, a plate heat exchanger is designed. The Net Present Value of this project is currently unacceptable, therefore this proposal is rejected. Originality - Currently there is hardly any literature available about in-container sterilization. This research provides insights in relevant aspects of operating an incontainer sterilization stage form both a technological and management point of view. However, the outcome of this research is not general applicable as the systems are, at least to a certain extent, custom designed and only a limited range of dairy products are considered. This research might be useful as a case study for a theoretical evaluation of the RCA methodology and techniques. ...|$|E

A maximally decimated filter bank is well known for its application in subband coding. Another application of maximally decimated filter banks is in <b>block</b> <b>filtering.</b> Convolution through <b>block</b> <b>filtering</b> has the advantages that parallelism is increased and data are processed at a lower rate. However, the computational complexity is comparable to that of direct convolution. More recently, another type of filter bank convolver has been developed. In this scheme, the convolution is performed in the subbands. Quantization and bit allocation of subband signals are based on signal variance, as in subband coding. Consequently, for a fixed rate, the result of convolution is more accurate than is direct convolution. This type of filter bank convolver also enjoys the advantages of <b>block</b> <b>filtering,</b> parallelism, and a lower working rate. Nevertheless, like <b>block</b> <b>filtering,</b> there is no computational saving. In this article, under-decimated systems are introduced to solve the problem.

Two types of filter banks can be used in the under-decimated system: the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) filter banks and the cosine modulated filter banks. They are well known for their low complexity. In both cases, the system is approximately alias free, and the overall response is equivalent to a tunable multilevel filter. Properties of the DFT filter banks and the cosine modulated filter banks can be exploited to simultaneously achieve parallelism, computational saving, and a lower working rate.

A maximally decimated filter bank is well-known for its application in subband coding. Another application of maximally decimated filter banks is in <b>block</b> <b>filtering,</b> [a]. Convolution through <b>block</b> <b>filtering</b> has the advantages that parallelism is increased and data is processed at a lower rate. However, the computational complexity is comparable to that in direct convolution. In [3], filter banks are used to map long convolutions into smaller ones in the subbands. Computations are then performed in parallel at a lower rate. More recently 641, another type of filter bank convolver has been developed. In this scheme the convolution is performed in the subbands and for a fixed rate the re-sult of convolution is more accurate than direct convolu-tion.
