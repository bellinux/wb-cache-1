500|$|The {{video was}} really relaxed... {{it was so}} hot. I was {{literally}} dripping! Not nice! In between takes I had about 5 fans on me, one up {{the front of my}} dress, one up the back of my dress. I was wearing trainers again—I learnt from the day <b>before</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> needed to bandage my feet up so they couldn't expand anymore! We couldn't play music on the street so I was wearing an ear piece with my track playing. Loads of people were stopping and looking at me like I'd lost it, jumping up and down to what they thought was no music playing! Gotta do what you gotta do! Everyone worked so hard in getting the video together considering the conditions, I was really grateful! ...|$|E
2500|$|Hard rock {{musician}} Lemmy of {{the band}} Motörhead gained a lot from his tenure in Hawkwind. He has remarked, [...] "I really found myself as an instrumentalist in Hawkwind. <b>Before</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was just a guitar player who was pretending to be good, when actually I was no good at all. In Hawkwind I became a good bass player. It was where I learned I was good at something." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Wonderful!" [...] Peter repeated, with {{twinkling}} eyes. [...] "I {{have never}} been called <b>that</b> <b>before.</b> <b>I</b> feel <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have no claim whatever to distinction, especially in a gathering like this." ...|$|R
60|$|CLARE. Right? Whatever else is right--our life is not. [She {{puts her}} hand on her heart] <b>I</b> swear <b>before</b> God <b>that</b> I've tried and tried. <b>I</b> swear <b>before</b> God, <b>that</b> if <b>I</b> {{believed}} we could ever again love each other only a little tiny bit, I'd go back. <b>I</b> swear <b>before</b> God <b>that</b> <b>I</b> don't want to hurt anybody.|$|R

2500|$|Bright {{attributed}} {{his poor}} form {{in part to}} his league stint in England, saying [...] "the wickets were so slow that I ended up bowling a lot quicker. It took me a long, long time to renegotiate what I needed to do in Australian conditions." [...] He added that [...] "another thing was that the batsman weren't taking any risks against me. <b>Before</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> suppose they had underestimated me, but after I was selected for New Zealand they took no risks and I had to really fight for my wicket." ...|$|E
2500|$|Keane {{has done}} media work but {{expressed}} {{his lack of}} enthusiasm to do so again in future when he said, [...] "I was asked last week by ITV to do the Celtic game," [...] he said. [...] "A couple of weeks <b>before</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was asked to do the United game against Celtic at Old Trafford. I think I've done it once for Sky. Never again. I'd rather go to the dentist. You're sitting there with people like Richard Keys and they're trying to sell something that's not there." [...] Keane added, [...] "Any time I watch a game on television I have to turn the commentators off".|$|E
2500|$|Lady Isabel {{hears the}} horn of an elf-knight and wishes she had the horn and the knight [...] "to sleep in my bosom". He {{immediately}} appears and asks {{her to go to}} the greenwood. They ride there, and he tells her that he has killed seven kings daughters there and she is to be the eighth. She suggests that he put his head on her knee [...] "that we may hae some rest <b>before</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> die". She puts him to sleep with a [...] "small charm" [...] and after tying him up with his own belt she kills him with his own dagger.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is not {{the going}} <b>before</b> me <b>that</b> <b>I</b> object to," [...] said Bessie; [...] "it is their {{thinking}} {{that they have a}} right to do it--A RIGHT <b>THAT</b> <b>I</b> RECOGNIZE." ...|$|R

2500|$|In June 1986, Sting {{reunited with}} the Police {{for the last}} three shows of Amnesty's six-date A Conspiracy of Hope concerts in the U.S. The day after the final concert, he told NBC's Today Show: [...] "I've been a member of Amnesty and a support member for five years, due to an {{entertainment}} event called The Secret Policeman's Ball and <b>before</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> did not know about Amnesty, I did not know about its work, I did not know about torture in the world."

2500|$|In 1887, {{four years}} after Turgenev's death, Goncharov {{attached}} a note to this novel's original text, which read: [...] "This manuscript contains the material for a novel which in 1869, as Vestnik Evropy was about to publish it, I gave the title The Precipice. <b>Before</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{used to refer to}} is as Raisky, the Artist and was freely expounding upon it to my fellow writers, mostly to Turgenev. It was to him that in 1855, soon after returning from my around-the-world journey, I recounted in detail, in the course of several meetings, all the details of it [...] because he, being a perceptive and sensitive [...] man of art, seemed to be most sympathetic to those of my works that he promised a great future for." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I think I’ve {{always been}} a seeker. All during Fanny I was reading books that really appealed to me – on Buddhism; all the forms of Hindu asceticism; Chinese Tao; Japanese forms of discipline, both {{physical}} and mental; Sufism; Gurdjieff; Madame Blavatsky; Paramahansa Yogananda; Alan Watts; Carl Jung; Chinese poetry; and so on. What has seemed to take the greatest hold is Buddhism, particularly the Tibetan style. As I’ve learned so often during discourses, {{it all depends on}} one’s karmic predisposition. Mine seems to be constantly investigating, although once I understood the four Noble Truths in conjunction with the Eightfold Path and actually experienced moments of no consciousness; slowly, my life was transformed. <b>Before</b> <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> had a deep feeling of hopelessness. These practices haven’t been easy but pretty brutal to go through in many instances.|$|E

2500|$|... "delighted to get it, because she'd only {{done little}} tiny bit parts {{in a couple}} of {{pictures}} <b>before</b> <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> was pleasantly surprised by her. She called me one day and asked if she could bring her sister along with her onto location. I said, 'Sure, of course, no problem.' And I was delighted because she was going out {{with the head of the}} studio. She could have been the biggest pain in the ass alive. And I would be in a terribly awkward position if she started with the limousines and the special means and whatever the hell it is—or complaining about whatever. But never a peep out of her. Most pleasant, most charming, very cooperative, very hard-working. She was always there half an hour before her call and she always stayed on for a half hour just in case. Interested in everything that went on, and was a total joy. I couldn't ask for a more cooperative actor." ...|$|E
2500|$|I became {{terrified that}} I {{was going to}} be a full-time, bomb-throwing {{terrorist}} if I stayed [...] because it was the beginning of really bad times in America. It was '66–'67, it was the first police riot in Los Angeles.... In college my major was political science, so my brain worked that way.... And I drove around this little English Hillman Minx—top down—and every night I'd be hauled over by the cops. Up against the wall, and all this stuff. They had this monologue with me; it was never a dialogue. It was that I was a long-haired drug addict living off some rich guy's foolish daughter. And I said, [...] "No, I work in advertising. I make twice as much as you do." [...] Which is a stupid thing to say to a cop....And it was like an epiphany. I suddenly felt what it was like to be a black or Mexican kid living in L.A. <b>Before</b> <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> thought I knew what the world was like, I thought I knew what poor people were, and then suddenly it all changed because of that simple thing of being brutalized by cops. And I got more and more angry and I just felt, I've got to get out of here—I'm a better cartoonist than I am a bomb maker. That's why so much of the U.S. is still standing.|$|E

6000|$|... "Mrs. Gardner," [...] he said, [...] "I will confess <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{have been}} {{wasting my time}} with this young man. You are a trifle severe upon me. You may find, and <b>before</b> long, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am your best friend." ...|$|R
