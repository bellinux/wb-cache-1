The working environment of <b>gas</b> <b>turbine</b> blade is very hot, aggressive and harsh for blade material. But blade metallurgy and coating always saves the blade material for long period of time. It is observed that <b>gas</b> <b>turbine</b> blade fails due to hot flowing fluid over its profile.
