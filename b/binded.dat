Ash repeatedly brushes him off however as time goes on Baal appears to drive Ash insane with illusions of his friends and convinces him to kill Pablo, who has <b>binded</b> with the Necronomicon and {{is the only thing that}} can send Baal back to hell. Ash attempts to destroy the Necronomicon (Pablo) when he sees the real Ruby, Kelly and Pablo pulling up a car outside the asylum. Ash succeeds in capturing Pablo and brings him to Baal. Much to everybody's shock, Ash reveals he was tricking Baal the whole time to get Pablo in the same room so they could send the demon back to hell. Lacey (who was a Deadite all along) and Emery the sheriff are killed, but Linda survives, eager to avenge the deaths of her loved ones. Pablo reads the spell to return Baal to hell. During the process Pablo's body is ripped and torn a part as Baal is forcibly sent back to hell; Pablo then collapses dead moments after.|$|E
50|$|L1 is {{involved}} in neuron-neuron adhesion, neurite fasciculation, outgrowth of neurites, cerebellar granule cell migration, neurite outgrowth on Schwann cells and interactions among epithelial cells of intestinal crypts. As a consequence, mutations in the L1CAM gene cause the Nervous System to malfunction. The main disorders linked to this mutation are known by the acronym CRASH or can be also referred as L1 syndrome. This includes disorders such as HSAS, MASA syndrome, agenesis of the corpus callosum and spastic paraplegia. Lower limb spasticity, mental retardation, hydrocephalus and flexion deformity of the thumbs {{are some of the}} symptoms expressed mostly in male individuals who suffer from this condition. Although the pathological mechanisms leading to L1syndrome are still unknown, about 200 mutations of the L1CAM gene have been identified and then associated with the syndrom. These mutations mostly affect structurally important key residues in the extracellular region of L1 causing alterations in the protein binding properties, which correlate to the impairment of neuronal physiological mechanisms such as cell adhesion or specific interacting with other molecules. Ankyrin interaction with L1CAM {{is an example of a}} protein binding that fails in CRASH patients due to a mutation that causes leucine and histidine to replace serine and tyrosine respectively, in the SFIGQY motif, where aknkyrin should be <b>binded</b> in the L1CAM family cytoplasmic terminus. Ankyrin-L1CAM interaction {{is involved}} in the growth cone initiation, consequently, a failure in this interaction causes neurites to not reach synaptic target.|$|E
30|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the feasibility of newly developed controlled low strength material (CLSM) using industrial wastes (pond ash, artificial aggregate made by red mud) and cementless binder as a full substitute of Portland cement in mixtures. The compressive strength of pond ash based CLSM <b>binded</b> with Portland cement meets in the desirable range of excavatable CLSM while pond ash based CLSM <b>binded</b> with cementless binder, which fully replaces the cement, shows slightly lower strength than excavatable CLSM strength ranges. In order to improve engineering properties of pond ash based CLSM <b>binded</b> with cementless binder, artificial aggregate that was made of Bauxite residues, red mud, was mixed with pond ash. Several mixtures made with binders and aggregates were systematically tested to determine the engineering properties of controlled low strength material such as flow consistency, compressive strength and thermal conductivity.|$|E
40|$|Reversible binding among {{components}} of the cellular submembrane cytoskeleton and reversible binding {{of some of these}} components with the plasma membrane likely play a role in nonelastic morphological changes and mechanoplastic properties of cells. However, relatively few studies have been devoted to investigating directly the kinetic aspects of the interactions of individual {{components of}} the membrane skeleton with the membrane. The experiments described here investigated whether one component of the erythrocyte membrane cytoskeleton, protein 4. 1, binds to its sites on the membrane reversibly and if so, whether the different 4. 1 -binding sites display distinct kinetic behavior. Protein 4. 1 is known to stabilize the membrane and to mediate the attachment of spectrin filaments to the membrane. Protein 4. 1 previously has been shown to bind to integral membrane proteins band 3, glycophorin C, and to negatively charged phospholipids. To examine the kinetic rates of dissociation of carboxymethyl fluorescein-labeled 4. 1 (CF- 4. 1) to the cytofacial surface of erythrocyte membrane, a special preparation of hemolyzed erythrocyte ghosts was used, in which the ghosts became flattened on a glass surface and exposed their cytofacial surfaces to the solution through a membrane rip in a distinctive characteristic pattern. This preparation was examined by the microscopy technique of total internal reflection/fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (TIR/FRAP). Four different treatments were employed to help identify which membrane binding sites gave rise to the multiplicity of observed kinetic rates. The first treatment, the control, stripped off the native spectrin, actin, 4. 1, and ankyrin. About 60 % of the CF- 4. 1 bound to this control <b>binded</b> irreversibly (dissociation time > 20 min), but the remaining approximately 40 % <b>binded</b> reversibly with a range of residency times averaging approximately 3 s. The second treatment subjected these stripped membranes to trypsin, which presumably removed most of the band 3. CF- 4. 1 <b>binded</b> significantly less to these trypsinized membranes and most of the decrease was a loss of the irreversibly binding sites. The third treatment simply preserved the native 4. 1 and ankyrin. CF- 4. 1 <b>binded</b> less to this sample too, and the loss involved both the irreversible and reversible sites. The fourth treatment blocked the gycophorin C sites on the native 4. 1 -stripped membranes with an antibody. CF- 4. 1 again <b>binded</b> less to this sample than to a nonimmune serum control, and almost all of the decrease is a loss of irreversible sites. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS...|$|E

Limited progress has been reported in the dispersion and controlled placement of carbon nanotubes. In the present study, we dispersed carbon nanotubes using an optical tweezer cum microdissector system and then <b>binded</b> them onto a silicon surface. –OH groups were created on the silicon surface. Carbon nanotubes were processed to form a carboxylic group at their ends. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded to confirm the functionalization. These carbon nanotubes were made to react with silicon surface. The silicon surface was investigated under scanning electron microscope (SEM). The image showed the presence of a number of carbon nanotubes <b>binded</b> to the silicon surface.

40|$|There were {{investigated}} {{the action of}} viscum, ricin, agglutinin ricin and their complexes with lactose or galactose on the fMLF induced respiratory burst in the neutrophils. The peritoneal zymosan evoked neutrophils of mice NMRI strain were used. Production of the reactive oxygen species was estimated by luminol-dependent chemiluminescence. It was shown that investigated RIPs II could exhibit properties of chemoattractant receptor antagonist (fMLP receptor) and modulate fMLP-induced respiratory burst. Ricin is more effective modulator of fMLP-induced respiratory burst than agglutinin ricin. This effect {{could be related to}} interaction of RIPs II with galactose but not mannose receptors. It was shown that modulating action of RIPs increased as the amount of lactose or galactose <b>binded</b> to molecular of RIPs was added. We assume that affinity of RIPs to galactose receptor increased as the amount of saccharides <b>binded</b> with molecular of RIPs increased. Structure peculiarities of RIPs II lead to character of their modulating effects.

40|$|The True Characteristic of All Dharmas (Shohō Jissō-shō 諸法実相抄) is {{traditionally}} {{believed to be}} one of the twelve epistles sent by Nichiren (日蓮, 1222 – 1282) to the ex-Tendai monk Sairen-bō (最蓮房, 13 th century) during their exile on Sado Island. Because the only surviving copy of this epistle is the one included in The Writings “Outside the Records” in <b>Binded</b> Fascicles (Rokuge-gappon 録外合本) from 1480 by Nicchō (日朝, 1422 – 1500), the eleventh abbot of Kuon-ji monastery (久遠寺), it is classified as one of Nichiren’s “nonautographical writings” (Shahon-ibun 写本遺文). The present study aims to introduce some relevant problems about the origin of The True Characteristic of All Dharmas, with due consideration given to the results of research realized by several scholars on the biography of Sairen-bō, and on the circumstances of the collection of Nichiren’s writings following his death. Clarifying the origin of this epistle can lead us to a deeper understanding of the relationship between Nichiren’s non-autographical writings and Medieval Tendai Thought (Chūko Tendai-gi 中古天台義). As I argue, upon his return from Sado Island, Sairen-bō brought the original text of The True Characteristic of All Dharmas, along with the other eleven epistles he received from Nichiren, to Kyoto, where he concluded his life. However, another collection of Nichiren’s writings, The Writings “Inside the Records” in <b>Binded</b> Fascicles (Rokunai-gappon 録内合本) compiled by Nicchō from 1479, includes four other epistles to Sairen-bō. This fact leads us to the hypothesis that the material that became the primary source of both The Writings “Inside” and “Outside the Records” in <b>Binded</b> Fascicles was delivered from Kyōto to Minobu respectively by the third abbot of Kuon-ji monastery, Nisshin (日進, 1271 – 1347), who copied epistles to Sairen-bō while in Kyoto, and by the twelfth abbot Nichi’i (日意, 1444 – 1519), disciple of Nicchō, during his mission in the capital between 1470 and 1479. I argue that considering that the primary sources for both The Writings “Inside” and “Outside the Records” in <b>Binded</b> Fascicles were still being transferred from Kyoto since the time of Nisshin, these two compilations by Nicchō were nothing more than a copy of what was already arranged earlier. Moreover, this fact makes plausible the hypothesis that the origin of The True Characteristic of All Dharmas arose before the second half of 15 th century, and suggests the necessity of further verifying the movements not only of Sairen-bō but also of Nisshin and Nichi’i...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} {{was to develop a}} water-stable and {{palatable}} diet for the supplementary feeding of wrasse deployed in salmon sea-pens using a gelling agent mixed with a manufactured dry-feed component. Three binders (gelatine from cold water fish skin, beef gelatin and agar-agar) were compared for water-gel strength over a range of concentrations. Gel formed using agar was found to be significantly stronger than the other binders tested. An experimental aqua-feed made using a grinded, dry ingredient mix <b>binded</b> with 20 g/L agar solution at 1 / 1. 6 (w/v) ratio and offered as blocks within individual feeders was water-stable for 7 days when deployed fresh or following a week of preservation at - 20 °C. Farmed ballan wrasse in tanks fed on the agar-based diet within 2 days of deployment. Wild wrasse stocked in salmon sea-pens at low density (1. 2 - 2. 1 %), up to 4 weeks prior the start of the trial and not previously fed a manufactured diet first ingested the agar feed within 2 weeks and total feed intake significantly increased afterwards. Feed intake was significantly higher from feeders placed within a small feeding shelter made of artificial kelp than within the large wrasse shelter. No nutrient leaching after water immersion and no alterations in the fatty acid profile after preparation of the experimental feed was found. A manufactured grinded ingredient mix <b>binded</b> with 20 g/L agar solution at a 1 / 1. 6 (w/v) ratio and offered within static feeders is proposed as the basis of a novel supplementary feeding methodology for cleaner fish wrasse deployed in salmon sea-pens.
