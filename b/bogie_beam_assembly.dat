40|$|The work {{investigates the}} {{application}} of a novel frame model to reduce the computational cost of the mistuning analysis of bladed disc systems. A full-scale finite element (FE) model of the bladed disc is considered as benchmark. The single blade frame configuration is identified via an optimization process. The individual blades are then assembled by 3 D springs, whose parameters are determined via calibration process. The dynamics of the novel <b>beam</b> frame <b>assembly</b> is also compared to those obtained from three state-of-the-art FE-based reduced order models (ROMs) : a lumped parameter approach; a Timoshenko <b>beam</b> <b>assembly,</b> and component mode synthesis (CMS) based techniques with free and fixed interfaces. The development of these classical ROMs to represent the bladed disc is also addressed in detail. A methodology to perform the mistuning analysis is then proposed and implemented. A comparison of the modal properties and forced response dynamics between the aforementioned ROMs and the full-scale FE model is presented. The case study demonstrates that the <b>beam</b> frame <b>assembly</b> can predict the variations of the blade amplitude factors with results being in agreement with the full-scale FE model. The CMS based ROMs underestimate the maximum amplitude factor, while the results obtained from <b>beam</b> frame <b>assembly</b> are generally conservative. The <b>beam</b> frame <b>assembly</b> is 4 times more computationally efficient than the CMS fixed-interface approach. This study proves that the <b>beam</b> frame <b>assembly</b> can efficiently predict the mistuning behavior of bladed discs when low order modes are of interest...|$|R
40|$|The major {{features}} and {{physics of the}} aerodynamic interactions between various main components of a generic four-wheel landing gear are studied. The study was conducted {{as a part of}} the UK ATI ALGAAP (Advanced Landing Gear Aero-loads and Aero-noise Prediction) project. Delayed Detached-Eddy Simulations with the Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model with fixed laminar-turbulent transition are performed to compare three configurations of landing-gear components. The wheel geometry is the same as in the tandem-wheel configuration that was previously studied for the ALGAAP project. For this geometry both simulations and experiments are available for validation and comparison with the current results on the four-wheel bogie. The effect of the fixed transition are also assessed on the four-wheel geometry and compared with the tandem wheels. The results show strong effects of the axles and the <b>bogie</b> <b>beam</b> on the low past the wheels. The axles generate a wide low-pressure wake in the aft part of the front wheels, which increases the mean drag coefficient of the front wheels. The flow features observed on the three configurations show some similarities with the flow features that were reported on tandem wheels, with a few differences. Adding axles and <b>bogie</b> <b>beam</b> increases the mean drag significantly on the front wheels, and slightly on the downstream wheels. Adding a main strut reduces the mean drag of the downstream wheels, but the mean drag of the front wheels slightly increases. A similar trend is seen with the RMS. The effect of the fixed transition in the four-wheel case is important in order to capture the transitional ow features but does not show an effect on the mean force coefficients as strong as on the tandem wheels...|$|R
40|$|The Mast Flight System is {{composed}} of several subsystems. Primary among these is the Deployable Mast Subsystem (DMS) which consists of a <b>beam</b> <b>assembly</b> and an associated mechanism for deploying and retracting the <b>beam.</b> The <b>beam</b> <b>assembly</b> is a joint dominated graphite epoxy and titanium truss as is expected of future large space structures. Integral to the <b>beam</b> <b>assembly</b> are actuators, sensors and associated electronics which are available for excitation and damping as desired by the experimenter. The beam structural characteristics can also be modified as desired by the experimenter using the Parameter Modification Device installed {{at the end of}} the beam. Data measured on the beam by the sensors and commands to the actuators are transmitted along the beam digitally at 150 Hz using a standard 1553 type bus. The Modular Distributed Information Sybsystem (MDIS) computer functions as bus master and ensures that all experimental data is saved for future analysis. The MDIS computer also performs a safing function to prevent inadvertent overexcitation of the beam.

40|$|AbstractA {{recently}} more used {{method of}} improving weld quality at the weld {{transition to the}} plate called HFMI (High Frequency Mechanical Impact) has been investigated and tried on two demonstrators, a <b>bogie</b> <b>beam</b> in an articulated hauler and a dipper arm in an excavator, see fig. 1. The designs of the beams have been made so that thinner plates can be used and higher material strength can be utilized. Such an approach needs {{to make use of}} local based analysis methods and in this case the effective notch method was used. Recently made research has suggested SN-curves where the use of HFMI in combination with different material yield strengths are described and these FAT values have been used to develop allowed stress levels in the beams to fulfill the life requirements. All this resulted in components which were 24 % and 18 % lighter using plate thicknesses of 8 - 12 mm in material yield 700 MPa. They were then produced and tested in a rig to verify the designs. The results imply that the HFMI treatment is a very promising method to build lighter welded structures, however, the design needs to take some new considerations into account to succeed...|$|R

40|$|Presented in {{this thesis}} is an {{evaluation}} of a novel box beam system of Pul- truded Fibre Reinforced Polymer (PFRP) shapes. The flat-pack modular beam system consists of separate PFRP flange and web shapes joined together with a new method of mechanical fastening. It {{is based on the}} first generation Star- tlink building system, conceived by UK engineers in 1999. The Startlink building system is introduced, and classified within the scope of Modern Methods of Con- struction (MMC), and its merits are discussed. In the context of MMC a critical review by the author finds that, although the proposed 1999 generation Startlink system offers design flexibility, it will probably have a limited market potential. The novel use of the steel MlO Unistrut connection method as a means of fastening distinct PFRP shapes in a building system is characterised. Individ- ual connector design parameters for joint stiffness and resistance are identified and determined, under pure shear loading. The results of a series of physical tests show no significant loss of stiffness or strength with long term environmen- tal exposure. Values of key mechanical properties for design calculations are recommended. A 400 x 200 x 2848 mm prototype PFRP box <b>beam</b> <b>assembly</b> is fabricated from two flange and two web panel-type shapes, cut from existing off-the-shelf PFRP shapes. This is 60 mm deeper than the largest single PFRP shape that {{could be used as a}} <b>beam.</b> The <b>assembly</b> is joined at the web-flange junction with M 10 Unistrut connectors set at various spacing's, in the range 50 to 400 mm. These connectors carry the longitudinal shear that is generated between the joined shapes when the modular assembly is in flexure, Theoretical deflections, cal- culated using a modified form of a partial-interaction analysis model developed for composite concrete and steel structures, are predicted for the assembly ac- counting for the finite shear stiffness of the web-flange connection. A series of 16 four-point bending load tests on the <b>beam</b> <b>assembly,</b> across two load arrange- ments, show that its performance is linked to the designated spacing of the M 10 Unistrut connections. The flexural rigidity and degree of interaction present in the assembly are determined from analysis of vertical deflections and longitudi- nal strains, as the beam is deformed. The influence of secondary effects, due to the poor tolerances achieved in the hand fabrication of the <b>beam's</b> <b>assembly,</b> are found to greatly affect the ability of the deflection analysis to give the required measured deflections. Comparison of the effective joint shear rigidities obtained from theory and testing indicates a higher individual connection stiffness in the prototype beam than previously determined by way of the individual Unistrut connector characterisation. It is found through the combined analytical and physical testing research that the M 10 Unistrut connection method can only provide the necessary joint shear stiffness and resistance to the 400 mm deep beam if the connector spacing, along the four joints, is ≤ 50 mm. The total number of connectors this represents in the beam is likely to make this modular construction approach too expensive for it to be commercially viable. Although the M 10 connector could be used to fabricate beams of lesser depths, since the number of connectors will then be reduced, these beams would find it difficult to compete with the available off-the-shelf PFRP beam shapes, of up to 300 mm deep. There is however scope to use the Unistrut method of connection to provide longitudinal shear resistance in building systems where, for example, a floor panel is to be stiffened by a channel shaped beam and the overall depth is ≤ 300 mm. The research work contained {{in this thesis}} has contributed to a radical change in the PFRP product offerings now proposed in the 2006 generation Startlink building system. ...|$|R
