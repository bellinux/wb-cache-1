25|$|For {{hundreds}} of years the English ancestors of the colonists had consumed beer and ale.

Because importing a continuing supply of beer was expensive, the early settlers brewed their own. However, {{it was difficult to}} make the beer they were accustomed to because wild yeasts caused problems in fermentation and resulted in a bitter, unappetizing brew. Although wild hops grew in New England, hop seeds were ordered from England in order to cultivate an adequate supply for traditional beer.

25|$|In Tamil Nadu, a plain rice porridge, or {{the thick}} {{supernatant}} water from overcooked rice, {{is known as}} kanji. Kanji or Congee is also prepared with different grains available {{in different parts of}} Tamil Nadu, for example minor millet or pearl millet, finger millet, broken wheat, maize.The people of Kerala also call this preparation of rice in a watery state kanji, and it is eaten as a porridge with green lentils or chutney. Kanji is prepared with rice or ragi. Nuts and spices are added to the kanji depending on the economic status or health requirements. Rice kanji is prepared by boiling rice in large amounts of water. To this preparation, either milk and sugar (usually jaggery) or curd (yoghurt) and salt are added. Ragi kanji is prepared by drying ragi sprouts in shade, and then grinding them into a smooth powder. This powder is added to water and cooked. Milk and brown sugar are added to this cooked preparation for taste. Ragi kanji can be given to infants after six months. Another kanji preparation uses jevvarisi (sago in English, sabudana in Hindi) in kanji. Sago is dry roasted and powdered with/ without sugar. Powdered sago is <b>boiled</b> <b>in</b> <b>water</b> until cooked. This is eaten by all ages from adults to infants as young as three months.|$|E
25|$|Rice (vary) is the {{cornerstone}} of the Malagasy diet and is typically consumed at every meal. The accompaniment served with rice is called laoka in the highlands dialect, the official version of the Malagasy language. Laoka are most often served in some kind of sauce: in the highlands, this sauce is generally tomato-based, while in coastal areas coconut milk is often added during cooking. In the arid southern and western interior where herding zebu is traditional, fresh or curdled zebu milk is often incorporated into vegetable dishes. Laoka are diverse and may include such ingredients as Bambara groundnuts with pork, beef or fish; trondro gasy (freshwater fish); ravitoto (shredded cassava leaves) with peanuts, beef or pork; henan'omby (beef) or akoho (chicken) sauteed with ginger and garlic or simmered in its own juices (a preparation called ritra); various types of seafood, which are more readily available along the coasts or in large urban centers; and many more. A variety of local greens such as anamamy (Morelle greens), anamafaitra (Martin greens) and particularly anamalao (paracress)—distinguished by the mildly analgesic effect the boiled leaves and flowers produce—are commonly sold alongside anandrano (watercress) and anatsonga (bok choy). In the arid south and west, such as among the Bara or Tandroy peoples, staples include sweet potato, yams, taro root and especially cassava, millet and maize, generally <b>boiled</b> <b>in</b> <b>water</b> and occasionally served in whole milk or flavored with crushed peanuts.

500|$|The {{artificial}} propagation of American paddlefish {{began with the}} efforts of the Missouri Department of Conservation during the early 1960s, and focused primarily on maintenance of the sport fishery. [...] However, it was the growing importance of American paddlefish for their meat and roe that became the catalyst for further development of culture techniques for aquaculture in the United States. [...] Artificial propagation requires broodstock which, because of the late sexual maturation of American paddlefish, are initially obtained from the wild and brought into a hatchery environment. [...] The fish are injected with LH-RH hormone to stimulate spawning. [...] The number of eggs a female may produce depends {{on the size of the}} fish and can range anywhere from 70,000–300,000 eggs. [...] Unlike most teleosts, the oviduct branches of American paddlefish and sturgeons are not directly attached to the ovaries; rather, they open dorsally into the body cavity. [...] To determine the status of progression toward maturation, ova staging is performed. [...] The process begins with a minor procedure that involves a small abdominal incision from which to extract a few sample oocytes. [...] The oocytes are <b>boiled</b> <b>in</b> <b>water</b> for a few minutes until the yolk is hardened, and then they are cut in half to expose the nucleus.

40|$|The giant {{internode}} {{cells of}} Nitella axillaris exhibit acid-induced growth {{similar to that}} found in higher plants. The threshold pH is 4. 5, with a maximum at 3. 5. The acid growth effect is transient, lasting no more than 32 min. Extensibility measurements of isolated cell walls showed a similar pattern of acid enhancement. Prolonged <b>boiling</b> <b>in</b> <b>water</b> (12 hr) only partially inhibited the acid-induced wall extensibility and actually increased the extensibility at pH 6. It was concluded that physical, rather than enzymatic, processes were responsible for acid-enhanced continuous extension ("creep") in Nitella walls. A complex cation-sensitive mechanism that affects extensibility was also characterized. Among the stimulatory (wall-softening) cations, divalents were generally more effective than monovalents, with magnesium being the most stimulatory. The inhibitory (wall-hardening) cations included divalents and trivalents, aluminum being the most inhibitory. Ionic effects on extensibility were even less sensitive to prolonged <b>boiling</b> <b>in</b> <b>water</b> than acid effects...|$|R

A more {{important}} schism from Antoinism was initied by Pierre Dor (born 15 May 1862, Mons-Crotteux), Louis Antoine's nephew, and was named [...] "Dorism". He first participated in the Spiritist circle of his uncle, [...] "The Vine Growers of the Lord", but decided to splinter off, as he believed he had himself gifts of healing. He tried to heal sufferers, but did not achieve success and returned to the group of his uncle. However, he accompanied one of his patients in Russia, where he enjoyed success since he healed about 7,000 people per week, but came back to Belgium after complaints from doctors. In Roux-Wilbeauroux, he built a hall called [...] "The Moral School" [...] ("L'École Morale") where he healed the sick and dispensed roughly the same teachings as that of his uncle. He explained his theory in two books respectively published in 1912 and 1913, entitled Catechism of the Restoration of the Soul (Catéchisme de la restauration de l'âme) and Christ Speaks Again (Le Christ parle à nouveau)—as he identified himself to Jesus Christ, and Antoine to John the Baptist—which Debouxhtay considered as a potential plagiarism of Antoine's writings. Dor encouraged a diet of vegetables <b>boiled</b> <b>in</b> <b>water</b> and chastity before marriage. In 1916, he was convicted of illegally practicing the healing art. Thereafter, he moved to Uccle, and his movement disappeared following his death on 5 March 1947. As Antoinism, Dorism was criticized by some Catholic clergy members.|$|E
