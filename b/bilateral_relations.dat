5|$|Serbian–American {{relations}} are <b>bilateral</b> <b>relations</b> between {{the governments of}} Serbia and the United States. They were first established in 1882.

5|$|<b>Bilateral</b> <b>relations</b> {{with the}} United States are {{strained}} because the U.S. Department of State supports various anti-Lukashenko non-governmental organizations (NGOs), {{and also because}} the Belarusian government has made it increasingly difficult for United States-based organizations to operate within the country. Diplomatic relations remained tense, and in 2004, the United States passed the Belarus Democracy Act, which authorized funding for anti-government Belarusian NGOs, and prohibited loans to the Belarusian government, except for humanitarian purposes. Despite this political friction, the two countries do cooperate on intellectual property protection, prevention of human trafficking, technology crime, and disaster relief.|$|E

5|$|Duhalde was {{appointed}} {{president in the}} aftermath of the September 11 attacks, when the foreign policy of the United States was strictly focused on the War on Terror. Initially, the Argentine society was divided on how to manage the <b>bilateral</b> <b>relations</b> with the US. One group wanted to keep the close relations of the previous decade, as Argentina might need foreign help to deal with the crisis. The other group preferred to maintain more distant relations. Duhalde sought to strike a balance between both options, and eventually leaned towards the second when the US refused to help Argentina.|$|E
5|$|From 1945 to 1947 Molotov {{took part}} in all four {{conferences}} of foreign ministers of the victorious states in World War II. In general, he was distinguished by an uncooperative attitude towards the Western powers. Molotov, {{at the direction of}} the Soviet government, condemned the Marshall Plan as imperialistic and claimed it was dividing Europe into two camps, one capitalist and the other communist. In response, the Soviet Union, along with the other Eastern Bloc nations, initiated {{what is known as the}} Molotov Plan. The plan created several <b>bilateral</b> <b>relations</b> between the states of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union; and later evolved into the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA).|$|E
5|$|The other {{defining}} {{aspect of}} Turkey's {{foreign policy is}} the country's long-standing strategic alliance with the United States. The common threat posed by the Soviet Union during the Cold War led to Turkey's membership of NATO in 1952, ensuring close <b>bilateral</b> <b>relations</b> with Washington. Subsequently Turkey benefited from the United States' political, economic and diplomatic support, including in key {{issues such as the}} country's bid to join the European Union. In the post–Cold War environment, Turkey's geostrategic importance shifted towards its proximity to the Middle East, the Caucasus and the Balkans.|$|E
40|$|Approaching the {{implementation}} of ASEAN Community by early 2016, Indonesia-Malaysia relation has always been very dynamics. As cooperation between both countries has been going on, both have also involved in various crisis or conflicts on several issues. Both have actually tried hard to solve bilateral problems through various bilateral talks. However, these problems seemed to be unfinished in a sustainable and comprehensive form. Furthermore, the dynamics of neighboring relations seem to be exist until now. This paper suggests that these two countries should develop a comprehensive partnership. Looking at the on-going problematic relations, this partnership model is of importance {{for the fact that}} the <b>bilateral</b> <b>relation</b> should also involve people participation. By enhancing people initiative in strengthening the existing state-oriented relations, a comprehensive partnership can be developed in the purpose of reducing misunderstanding between both countries. Therefore, this paper offers the idea of building a comprehensive partnership between two countries with the purpose of developing a more sustainable <b>bilateral</b> <b>relation.</b> Keywords: Indonesia, Malaysia, comprehensive partnership, people participation, state-led <b>bilateral</b> <b>relation...</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{following}} year, <b>bilateral</b> <b>relations</b> between Thailand and Cambodia became strained due to overlapping {{claims on}} the land area surrounding Preah Vihear Temple. Sihanouk issued a communique in July 2008 emphasizing the Khmer architecture of the temple as well as ICJ's 1962 ruling of the temple in favour of Cambodia. In August 2009 Sihanouk stated that he would stop posting messages on his personal website as he was getting old, {{making it difficult for}} him to keep up with his personal duties. Between 2009 and 2011, Sihanouk {{spent most of his time}} in Beijing for medical care. He made a final public appearance in Phnom Penh on his 89th birthday and 20th anniversary of the Paris Peace Accords on 30October 2011. Thereafter, Sihanouk expressed his intent to stay in Cambodia indefinitely, but returned to Beijing in January 2012 for further medical treatment at the advice of his Chinese doctors.|$|E
5|$|The Song (960–1276) were a Chinese dynasty. To their north {{were the}} Jurchens, a {{confederation}} of semi-agrarian tribes from Manchuria in northeast Asia. While the Song and Jurchen {{had once been}} military allies, the Jurchen tribes, unified {{under the rule of}} Wanyan Aguda, plotted a revolt in 1114 to end their vassalage under the Khitan-led Liao dynasty. Aguda established the Jin dynasty in 1115 and adopted the title of emperor. The Jin negotiated a joint attack with the Song against the Khitans. They planned the attack for 1121 and then rescheduled to 1122. In 1122, the Jurchens captured the Liao Supreme and Western Capitals. The Song tried yet failed to capture the Liao Southern Capital of Yan (modern Beijing), which fell later that year to the Jin. The military weakness of the Song gave the Jin more diplomatic leverage over them. Negotiations between the Song and Jin produced a treaty in 1123, but <b>bilateral</b> <b>relations</b> deteriorated because of territorial disputes over the Sixteen Prefectures. In 1125, the Jurchens invaded the Song.|$|E
5|$|In late March 2012, a US {{military}} official {{stated that the}} United States would have to use routes through the Northern Distribution Network (NDN) for supplies to Afghanistan if Pakistan refused to reopen its supply lines. However, he conceded the expensiveness of these routes and noted that negotiations with Pakistan regarding the possibility of opening of the supply routes were ongoing. After reviewing United States-Pakistan relations and outlining what was needed to repair <b>bilateral</b> <b>relations,</b> the Pakistani parliament turned the decision of reopening the NATO supply lines over to the government in April 2012. Due to an upcoming general election in Pakistan, with widespread anti-American sentiments in the country, the Pakistani government was reluctant to reopen the lines, and postponed its decision until the United States responded positively to Pakistani demands outlined in the parliamentary recommendations, such as a US apology for the November 2011 incident, the bringing {{of those involved in}} the strike to justice, and a stop to US drone airstrikes. Talks between Pakistan and the United States failed in April 2012 after Pakistan could not get an unconditional apology from the United States for the November 2011 incident. The White House refused to apologise after Taliban attacks in Kabul and other cities in Afghanistan on 15 April 2012, which according to US military and intelligence officials came from the Haqqani network, an Afghan group working from a base in North Waziristan along the Afghanistan border in Pakistan's tribal belt. Pakistani officials said they cannot open the NATO supply routes in Afghanistan without a US apology.|$|E
