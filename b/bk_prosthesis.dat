40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to compare sockets for below-knee (<b>BK)</b> <b>prostheses</b> made by Computer Aided Design-Computer Aided Manufacture (CAD-CAM) to those made by hand. The {{patients}} in the study were provided with two prostheses each. which apart from the sockets, were identical. One socket. was made by the CAD-CAM technique developed at the Bioengineering Centre, Roehampton. University College London and one was made by hand at the OT-Centre, Stockholm, Sweden. The results were based on investigation of eight unilateral below-knee amputees evaluating their own sockets by Visual Analogous Scale with respect to combrt, pressure, and pain. The sockets were evaluated on seven occasions, at two tests. on delivery, after use every second day for six days and every second week for two weeks. All CAD-CAM sockets except one had to be changed once as compared to the hand made of which only two had to be changed. As to comfort it could not be demonstrated that there was any significant difference between the two types of sockets and both types were well accepted by all patients. Differences in pressure and pain were rarely reported. There were obvious differences between the two types of socket with respect to height, width, and inner surface configuration. The authors feel that CAD-CAM will in the near future be an excellent tool for design and manufacture of prosthetic sockets. All correspondence to be addressed to Dr. P. Kohler...|$|R
40|$|A {{detailed}} design synthesis {{analysis of the}} <b>BK</b> Syme <b>prosthesis</b> is provided, to determine the socket's cutout orientation size and shape, cutout fillet shape, socket wall thickness distribution and the reinforced fiber distribution in the socket wall, for a minimally stressed structurally safe lightweight prosthesis. For analysis purposes, the most adverse socket loading is obtained at the push-off stage of gait; this loading is idealized as an axial in-plane loading on the bottom edge of the circular cylindrical socket shell whose top edge is considered fixed. Finite element stress analysis of the socket shell (with uniform and graded wall thickness) are performed for various orientations of the cutout and for various types of corner fillets. A lateral cutout with a streamline fillet is recommended. The wall material (i. e., thickness) distribution is determined so as to minimize the stresses, while ensuring that the wall material's stress limits are not exceeded. For such a maximally stressed lightweight socket shell, the panels {{in the neighborhood of}} the cutout are checked to ensure that they do not buckle under their acquired stresses. A fiber-reinforced laminated composite socket shell is also analyzed in order to recommend optimum variables in orientations and densities of reinforcing fibers...|$|R
