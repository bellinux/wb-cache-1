We combine a mean-field theory developed from a lattice model with a level surface analysis of the periodic structures of soft-sphere aggregates to study stable morphologies for all clustering potentials. We develop a systematic approach to the thermodynamics of mesophase assembly in the low-temperature, strong-segregation and predict a generic sequence of phases including lamella, hexagonal-columnar and <b>body-center</b> <b>cubic</b> phases, as well as the associated inverse structures. We discuss the finite temperature corrections to strong segregation theory in terms of Sommerfeld-like expansion and how these corrections affect the thermodynamic stability of bicontinuous mesophase structures, such as gyroid. Finally, we explore the opposite limit of weakly-segregated particles, and predict the generic stability of a bicontinuous cluster morphology within the mean-field phase diagram...|$|R

The present study shows that the crystallography of twinning can be described by two twinning modes along the complete Bain transformation path and beyond connecting <b>body-centered</b> and face-centered <b>cubic</b> structures. To probe this concept, we used strained epitaxial films of the Fe-Pd magnetic shape memory system.

Soc. 2005, 127, 14388] of nanoparticle growth in the clear solution synthesis of silicalite- 1 (MFI). We have implemented the model on a <b>body-center</b> <b>cubic</b> (bcc) lattice with second-neighbor repulsions, to generate a four-coordinate network that mimics the tetrahedral structure of silica. With this low-coordination lattice model we observe that the nanoparticles are metastable, possessing a core-shell structure with mostly silica in the core and templates forming a shell. Nanoparticle size is found to increase with temperature and decrease with solution pH, in qualitative agreement with results from experiment and the previous lattice model study. The low-coordination model makes it possible to model porosity in the silica core of nanoparticles. We use this feature to investigate the extent of template penetration into the silica core, a level of nuance missing in experimental data on the core-shell model. We find that template penetration is rare for bulky templates. We discuss the implications of this result for understanding the role of these nanoparticles in the growth of MFI, especially in light of recent experiments on the long-time behavior of nanoparticle suspensions.

40|$|Block {{copolymers}} forming glassy spheres in {{the matrix}} of rubbery chains can exhibit elastomeric properties. It {{is well known}} that the spherical microdomains are arranged in the <b>body-center</b> <b>cubic</b> (bcc) lattice. However, recently, we have found packing in the face-centered cubic (fcc) lattice, which is easily transformed into the bcc lattice upon uniaxial stretching. In the same time, the packing regularity of the spheres in the bcc lattice was found to be enhanced for samples completely recovered from the stretched state. This reminds us that a cycle of stretching-and-releasing plays an important role from analogy of densification of the packing in granules upon shaking. In the current paper, we quantify the enhancement of packing regularity of spherical microdomains in the bcc lattice upon uniaxial stretching of the same elastomeric triblock copolymer as used in our previous work by conducting small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements using high brilliant synchrotron radiation. Isotropically circular rings of the lattice peaks observed for the unstretched sample turned into deformed ellipsoidal rings upon the uniaxial stretching, with sharpening of the peaks in the direction parallel to the stretching direction and almost disappearing of the peaks in the perpendicular direction. By quantitatively analyzing the SAXS results, {{it was found that the}} packing regularity of the spherical microdomains was enhanced in the parallel direction while it was spoiled in the perpendicular direction under the stretched state. The enhanced regularity of packing was unchanged even if the stretching load was completely removed...|$|R

40|$|For a {{broad range}} of {{applications}} the most important transport property of porous media is permeability. Here we calculate the permeability and porosity of ordered sphere packs, simple, <b>body-centered</b> and face-centered <b>cubic,</b> as simple diagenetic processes reduces their pore spaces.

For flow simulations at selected porosity levels we use the lattice-Boltzmann method with a 15 -speed and 19 -speed models on three dimensional lattices. For validation purposes, the lattice-Boltzmann method is compared against an explicit finite-difference method for incompressible flow in simpler geometries. Simulating slow creeping flow through three-dimensional channels of different polygonal cross sections and three-dimensional porous structures of intermediate complexity checked the accuracy of the lattice-Boltzmann scheme used.

5|$|Like most lanthanides, {{praseodymium}} {{usually only}} uses three electrons as valence electrons, as afterwards the remaining 4f electrons are too strongly bound: {{this is because}} the 4f orbitals penetrate the most through the inert xenon core of electrons to the nucleus, followed by 5d and 6s, and this increases with higher ionic charge. Praseodymium nevertheless can continue losing a fourth and even occasionally a fifth valence electron because it comes very early in the lanthanide series, where the nuclear charge is still low enough and the 4f subshell energy high enough to allow the removal of further valence electrons. Thus, similarly to the other early trivalent lanthanides, praseodymium has a double hexagonal close-packed crystal structure at room temperature.

Their lustre tarnishes rapidly in air due to oxidation.

The structural sequence of potassium under compression to 1 Megabar is as follows: bcc - fcc - h-g (tI 19 *), hP 4 - oP 8 - tI 4 - oC 16. We consider configurations of Brillouin-Jones zones and the Fermi surface within a nearly-free-electron model {{in order to}} analyze {{the importance of these}} configurations for the crystal structure energy that contains two main contributions: electrostatic (Ewald) and electronic (band structure) energies. The latter can be lowered due to a formation of Brillouin zone planes close to the Fermi surface opening an energy gap at these planes. Under pressure, the band structure energy term becomes more important leading to a formation of complex low-symmetry structures. The stability of the post-fcc phases in K is attributed to the changes in the valence electron configuration implying the overlap of valence band with the upper core electrons.

5|$|Among the lanthanides, {{lanthanum}} is exceptional as it {{does not}} have any 4f electrons; indeed, the sudden contraction and lowering of energy of the 4f orbital that is important for the chemistry of the lanthanides only begins to happen at cerium. Thus it is only very weakly paramagnetic, unlike the strongly paramagnetic later lanthanides (with the exceptions of the last two, ytterbium and lutetium, where the 4f shell is completely full). Furthermore, since the melting points of the trivalent lanthanides are related to the extent of hybridisation of the 6s, 5d, and 4f electrons, lanthanum has the second-lowest (after cerium) melting point among all the lanthanides: 920°C.

Lanthanum has a relatively high resistivity of 615nΩm at room temperature; in comparison, the value for the good conductor aluminium is only 26.50nΩm. Lanthanum is the least volatile of the lanthanides. Like most of the lanthanides, lanthanum has a hexagonal crystal structure at room temperature.
