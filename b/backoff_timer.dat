In this paper, we propose a novel and efficient contention-based MAC protocol for wireless local area networks, namely, the Fast Collision Resolution (FCR) algorithm. This algorithm is developed based on the following innovative ideas: {{to speed up the}} collision resolution, we actively redistribute the <b>backoff</b> <b>timers</b> for all active nodes; to reduce the average number of idle slots, we use smaller contention window sizes for nodes with successful packet transmissions and reduce the <b>backoff</b> <b>timers</b> exponentially fast when a fixed number of consecutive idle slots are detected.

Immediate access can be granted for the transmission attempt of any AC[n] queue (n = 0, 1, 2, 3) {{only after the}} medium is idle longer than AIFS(AC[n]). In case of busy medium, a fixed time interval plus a random backoff time is needed before AC[n] can transmit a packet. AIFS(AC[n]) is the minimum time interval after which the QSTA detecting the idle channel can start a random <b>backoff</b> <b>timer</b> chosen from [0, CW(AC[n])] for collision avoidance among ACs. For each channel access attempt, CW(AC[n]) is initialized to CWmin(AC[n]) and the random <b>backoff</b> <b>timer</b> starts to count down in units of slot when the channel is free for one AIFS. The station starts to transmit when the <b>backoff</b> <b>timer</b> reaches zero and the channel is still idle. If unsuccessful, CW(AC[n]) is doubled for another channel access attempt until up to CWmax(AC[n]). TXOPlimit(AC[n]) is the maximum duration which allows the QSTA to transmit a burst of MAC frames without entering another channel contention period. Notably, {{as shown in the}} last column of Table 1, AC[2] (video) has a longer TXOPlimit than AC[3] (voice), whereas the zero values of TXOPlimit for both AC[1] and AC[0] represent that the QSTA can only transmit one MAC frame in a new contention period.|$|E

Some of these approaches modify the 802. 11 e Backoff procedure, either by changing the way the Contention Window is determined or by changing the way the <b>backoff</b> <b>timer</b> is decreased.

30|$|This {{distortion}} is {{the result}} of exceeding a critical channel congestion threshold when increasing the DENM message size with 44 bytes. As discussed by Ma and Chen[54], congested IEEE 802.11 ad hoc networks can suffer from a phenomenon called consecutive freeze process (CFP). This effect can be observed when a station that has just completed a transmission and that has a new packet to send chooses zero as its initial MAC <b>backoff</b> <b>timer.</b> It will start to transmit right after a DIFS, giving other stations no chances to back off. The impact of CFP is higher in case of broadcasting, leading to longer packet delays under network congestion. This longer delay causes more intermediate nodes to rebroadcast received DENM messages, since their <b>backoff</b> <b>timer</b> defined by the opportunistic forwarding scheme becomes empty before the nodes located further away get the opportunity to relay the message. This again leads to more load and hence congestion on the wireless channel, leading to longer CFP effects, leading to a further distortion of the opportunistic forwarding scheme, and so on.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — IEEE 802. 11 a/e {{has become}} a {{worldwide}} {{wireless local area network}} (W-LAN) standard, with a rapid development. Many proposals have been made for its further expansion, and some of them focus on multicarrier code division multiple access (MC-CDMA), a novel, high capacity, multicarrier modulation scheme. From {{the point of view of}} medium access control (MAC) layer, by the use of MC-CDMA, the frequency channel is divided in many channels separated by different spreading sequences, which we refer to as codechannels (cchs). Previous work [1] has proven the achievements of this approach. The network reaches higher net throughput while the queue and transmission delays are kept low since almost no collisions occur. In this paper we present and evaluate a new distributed coordination function (DCF) for the MAC protocol, best suited for W-LANs with multiple channel structure. Although in this work the new DCF is analysed for the MC-CDMA approach, its functionality is not limited to spread spectrum systems. Scope of the new DCF is to reduce the queue delay and prioritize some mobile stations (MS) by allowing them to start parallel <b>Backoff</b> <b>timers</b> in more than one cch. The outcome is a more symmetric distribution of load among the codechannels, which enhances the network performance, which can be seen from the simulation results...|$|R
40|$|Distributed {{coordination}} function (DCF) {{is a primary}} random access mechanism of IEEE 802. 11, which is the basic protocol of wireless LAN based on the CSMA/CA protocol.

The current DCF, however, {{is known to be}} unsuitable for real-time applications such as voice message transmission. In this paper, we focus on the performance issues of IEEE 802. 11 which accommodates the prioritized messages. Existing results use the initial window size and backoff window-increasing factor as tools to handle the priority of the messages. Instead, we introduce a novel scheme which chooses the <b>backoff</b> <b>timer</b> with arbitrary probabilities. By this, one can greatly reduce the backoff delay of the lower priority messages without degrading the performance of higher priority.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{intermittent}} disconnections due to host motions {{on the performance}} of TCP connections are investigated.

40|$|Since their {{emergence}} {{within the}} past decade, which has seen wireless networks being adapted to enable mobility, wireless networks have become increasingly popular {{in the world of}} computer research. A Mobile Ad hoc Network (MANET) is a collection of mobile nodes dynamically forming a temporary network without the use of any existing network infrastructure. MANETs have received significant attention in recent years due to their easiness to setup and to their potential applications in many domains. Such networks can be useful in situations where there is not enough time or resource to configure a wired network. Ad hoc networks are also used in military operations where the units are randomly mobile and a central unit cannot be used for synchronization. The shared media used by wireless networks, grant exclusive rights for a node to transmit a packet. Access to this media is controlled by the Media Access Control (MAC) protocol. The Backoff mechanism is a basic part of a MAC protocol. Since only one transmitting node uses the channel at any given time, the MAC protocol must suspend other nodes while the media is busy. In order to decide the length of node suspension, a backoff mechanism is installed in the MAC protocol. The choice of backoff mechanism should consider generating <b>backoff</b> <b>timers</b> which allow adequate time for current transmissions to finish and, at the same time, avoid unneeded idle time that leads to redundant delay in the network. Moreover, the backoff mechanism used should decide the suitable action to be taken in case of repeated failures of a node to attain the media. Further, the mechanism decides the action needed after a successful transmission since this action affects the next time backoff is needed. The Binary exponential Backoff (BEB) is the backoff mechanisms that MANETs have adopted from Ethernet. Similar to Ethernet, MANETs use a shared media. Therefore, the standard MAC protocol used for MANETs uses the standard BEB backoff algorithms. The first part of this work, presented as Chapter 3 of this thesis, studies the effects of changing the backoff behaviour upon a transmission failure or after a successful transmission. The investigation has revealed that using different behaviours directly affects both network throughput and average packet delay. This result indicates that BEB is not the optimal backoff mechanism for MANETs. Up until this research started, no research activity has focused on studying the major parameters of MANETs. These parameters are the speed at which nodes travel inside the network area, the number of nodes in the network and the data size generated per second. These are referred to as mobility speed, network size and traffic load respectively. The investigation has reported that changes made to these parameters values have a major effect on network performance. Existing research on backoff algorithms for MANETs mainly focuses on using external information, as opposed to information available from within the node, to decide the length of <b>backoff</b> <b>timers.</b> Such information includes network traffic load, transmission failures of other nodes and the total number of nodes in the network. In a mobile network, acquiring such information is not feasible at all times. To address this point, the second part of this thesis proposes new backoff algorithms to use with MANETs. These algorithms use internal information only to make their decisions. This part has revealed {{that it is possible to}} achieve higher network throughput and less average packet delay under different values of the parameters mentioned above without the use of any external information. This work proposes two new backoff algorithms. The Optimistic Linear-Exponential Backoff, (OLEB), and the Pessimistic Linear-Exponential Backoff (PLEB). In OLEB, the exponential backoff is combined with linear increment behaviour in order to reduce redundant long backoff times, during which the media is available and the node is still on backoff status, by implementing less dramatic increments in the early backoff stages. PLEB is also a combination of exponential and linear increment behaviours. However, the order in which linear and exponential behaviours are used is the reverse of that in OLEB. The two algorithms have been compared with existing work. Results of this research report that PLEB achieves higher network throughput for large numbers of nodes (e. g. 50 nodes and over). Moreover, PLEB achieves higher network throughput with low mobility speed. As for average packet delay, PLEB significantly improves average packet delay for large network sizes especially when combined with high traffic rate and mobility speed. On the other hand, the measurements of network throughput have revealed that for small networks of 10 nodes, OLEB has higher throughput than existing work at high traffic rates. For a medium network size of 50 nodes, OLEB also achieves higher throughput. Finally, at a large network size of 100 nodes, OLEB reaches higher throughput at low mobility speed. Moreover, OLEB produces lower average packet delay than the existing algorithms at low mobility speed for a network size of 50 nodes. Finally, this work has studied the effect of choosing the behaviour changing point between linear and exponential increments in OLEB and PLEB. Results have shown that increasing the number of times in which the linear increment is used increases network throughput. Moreover, using larger linear increments increase network throughput.
