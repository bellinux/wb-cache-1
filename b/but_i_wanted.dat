[...] Ebert gave the film {{two and a half stars}} out of four and said that while he enjoyed it and that it was a very good film from a talented director, [...] "I liked what I saw, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> more."

500|$|In an {{interview}} with Rolling Stone, Spears revealed that her idea initially was to make an album that was [...] "fresh-sounding [...] for the clubs or something that you play in your car when you're going out at night that gets you excited, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> it to sound different from everything else out right now." [...] "(Drop Dead) Beautiful" [...] is a party song with a heavy club beat. The elements used on the song's background were compared to similar used on songs by The Black Eyed Peas, Usher, Rihanna, and Lady Gaga, while its bass line {{was said to be}} [...] "a cousin of the ground" [...] for the Eurythmics' 1983 single [...] "Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)".|$|E

Spears called the show and explained the video explored reincarnation. She added, [...] "It's more like a movie. It's different than anything I've ever done. It's dark, and it shows me in a different light. Of course, I'm {{going to go back}} and do dance videos, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to be inspired and challenged."

500|$|Chris Robinson, {{a renowned}} music video director, was {{contacted}} {{with an offer}} to direct Austin and Watkins' visualization, and took on his first feature with ATL. The films producers decided Robinson would be well-suited for the project because {{of his ability to}} capture the music-driven aspects of the film, as provided by his experience in the field. They also cited his talent in storytelling. According to producer Austin, [...] "a lot of music video directors can't capture the story, so what we'd do was turn on the directors' tapes, turn down the music and just watch {{to see if we could}} find the story. Chris was far and away the best." [...] About making ATL his first feature, Robinson stated that [...] "as a music video director, I'd get a lot of scripts that had to do with really big visual pictures. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to start off doing something that had heart." [...] After being hired, Robinson traveled to Atlanta and spent time with Austin to try to soak up the vibe and energy of the unique city.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "All Is Full of Love" [...] was {{directed}} by Chris Cunningham. Björk was impressed by Cunningham's original music videos for IDM musicians Autechre, Squarepusher, and Aphex Twin, and by his clear lines, science fiction inclinations, and discordant imagery. This resulted in the singer contacting him to meet at his London office; she brought Chinese Kama Sutra {{as a guide to}} what she wanted. Cunningham had also associated the track with sex upon hearing it, but could not {{figure out how to make}} the video explicit yet broadcastable. Regarding this, the singer confessed, [...] "I think the only thing I said was that I thought it was very white [...] and I'm trying to describe some sort of a heaven. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> also to have the other level there, there would be lust, it wouldn't be just clean". She complemented saying she mentioned that the video should be [...] "white" [...] and [...] "frozen", and then it [...] "melts because of love" [...] and [...] "making love".|$|E

500|$|To {{support the}} new album, Blink-182 created {{an entirely new}} logo, a [...] "smiley face" [...] with Xs for each eye and five arrows {{on the left side}} of its face. According to Barker, the Blink-182 logo {{originated}} at his clothing line, Famous Stars and Straps. Barker wanted to brand an icon for the band: [...] "It just had to be a cool kind of happy face <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> arrows. You know, like The Jam were my favorite band, they always had arrows in their logos and stuff. It was just kind of inspired by pop-art." [...] Hoppus seconded this sentiment: [...] "He spearheaded all the artwork for the record. There were smiley-face stickers and posters all over Los Angeles, and that was his idea." [...] Barker invited his tattoo artist, Mister Cartoon, to create artwork for the record, and his good friend Estevan Oriol to handle photography. [...] "His style, incorporated into Blink's, didn’t make us too gangster: it just gave us a bit of an edge. It was cool to feel like Blink had a dangerous side", Barker later remembered.|$|E
500|$|Yiddish theatre {{composer}} Herman Yablokoff {{claimed in}} his biography, Memoirs of the Yiddish Stage, that the melody to [...] "Nature Boy" [...] was plagiarized from his song [...] "Shvayg mayn harts" [...] ("Hush My Heart"), {{which he wrote}} for his play Papirosn (1935). When met with a lawsuit in 1951 for the plagiarization, ahbez first proclaimed his innocence, and telephoned Yablokoff to explain that he [...] "had heard the melody as if angels were singing it... in the California mountains. He offered me $10,000 to withdraw the suit. I said that the money was not important, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> him {{to admit that the}} song was geganvet and if he heard angels, they must have bought a copy of my song." [...] Eventually ahbez's lawyers offered to have an out-of-court settlement, offering $25,000 ($ in [...] dollars) to Yablokoff, which he accepted. Freidwald remarked that [...] "it struck no one as ironic that a song with message of love and peace should come to symbolize how cutthroat the pop music business was becoming".|$|E
500|$|In 1983, Baker {{published}} an autobiography titled Baby Doll: An Autobiography, which detailed {{her life and}} career as an actress and revealed the issues with Paramount and Warner Bros. that had led her to move to Europe in the 1970s and pursue a career in Italian films. Baker said to Regis Philbin, when he interviewed her for Lifetime Television in 1986, that she [...] "didn't want to write an autobiography... <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to write, and I knew {{that would be the}} easiest thing to get published." [...] She further commented to Philbin on her writing, saying: [...] "I think I always wanted to write, but I was a little self-conscious about it. I never had a formal education, and I've always had such a respect for writing. While I could go out and say, even before I started to act, 'Yes, I'm an actress,' I couldn't really say 'I'm a writer.'" [...] In spite of Baker's misgivings, Baby Doll: An Autobiography was well received. She later wrote two other books, To Africa with Love (1986), detailing her time spent in Africa, and a novel titled A Roman Tale (1987).|$|E

500|$|Blackhill Enterprises {{provided}} a [...] high stage, with the speakers being {{housed in a}} thirty-foot-high tower so that people {{at the far end}} of the park would be able to hear the music. The stage was flanked by palm trees in pots and behind the performers there was a blowup of the cover of the Beggars Banquet album. Richards had started experimenting with open tunings by this point in the band's career, particularly after hearing Ry Cooder, and the Hyde Park gig was the first chance audiences got to hear them. He played a Gibson ES-330 tuned to open E tuning with a capo on the fourth fret, and a Gibson Flying V. Taylor, meanwhile, played a Gibson Les Paul for the opening number, followed by an SG for the majority of the set. The PA system was supplied by Watkins Electric Music, who already handled amplification at previous Hyde Park shows. Company founder Charlie Watkins recalls it was the largest PA he had assembled to that point and, unable to provide enough gear himself, he was forced to borrow extras from other groups, later saying, [...] "I didn't have many columns, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to put 1500W up. I borrowed some from T-Rex. They all chipped in — that's what we used to do." ...|$|E
500|$|By {{the end of}} 2006, Villa {{had become}} an {{integral}} part of Luis Aragonés' plans and ousted Raúl from the team. Proving vital in Spain's qualification for Euro 2008, he scored six goals, including a bicycle kick against Liechtenstein. He was subsequently called up for the tournament where he formed a striking relationship with Torres, with whom he would often celebrate his goals. He scored a hat-trick in Spain's 4–1 win over Russia, making him the first player to do so at a UEFA European Championship since Patrick Kluivert in 2000, and only the seventh overall. After the third goal, he went out of his way to meet Torres, who was on the bench at the time, to celebrate with him: [...] "I had just scored a hat-trick and I knew people would be talking about me, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> them to see that I had benefited from Torres's work, just as he sometimes benefits from mine." [...] In the next match, he secured a 2–1 win against Sweden with a goal in the 92nd minute. Rested for the next match against Greece, he started once again in the quarter-finals, where Spain beat Italy 4–2 on penalties; Villa took the first penalty and scored.|$|E
500|$|In July 2013, it was {{reported}} that Jeethu Joseph will be directing a film titled My Family with Mohanlal in the lead. In August 2013, Jeethu clarified that the film was titled Drishyam. A thread similar to that of Drishyam has been with the director since the early 1990s. He was inspired by a conversation he had overheard about the plight of two families involved in a legal battle. Jeethu had penned the story of Drishyam even before Memories (2013). He says, [...] "I started working on the subject some two years back. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to stick to the planned order and hence postponed the project till I finished Memories". The script was initially planned to be filmed by another director but since that director could not find a producer, Jeethu took back the script and decided to direct it himself. Drishyam contrasts from the director's previous films. He says, [...] "Different films require different treatment. I toiled hard while filming Memories as the film was full of twists and turns and the handling of the subject mattered a lot. But Drishyam is a complete script-oriented film that does not require any special effort. We shot the film sticking completely to the script, and the shooting was completed effortlessly." ...|$|E
