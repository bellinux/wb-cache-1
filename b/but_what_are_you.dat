500|$|An {{unusually large}} amount of in-camera effects {{were used for the}} pilot in place of {{computer}} generated imagery, including [...] "upside-down day"; shots of Haller using his abilities, where multiple takes of debris were filmed in controlled camera movements and then overlayed on shots of Stevens acting on his own; a montage that appears as a single camera movement, pulling [...] "back in slow motion as we see David Haller’s childhood progress"; and a one-shot action sequence—actually filmed in two shots that were later connected with visual effects—that saw the camera mounted on a cable and run down a hill side. Hawley admitted {{that it would be a}} challenge for the series' other directors to maintain this quality of visuals with much less time to film each episode: Hawley had 21 days to film the pilot, but the subsequent episodes were only scheduled 8 days of filming each. Some of these shoots ultimately had to be extended to 10 or 11 days filming to meet Hawley's vision, which he said were [...] "not good calls to have <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> going to do? It’s a huge show." [...] Keller felt that each episode in the season was noticeably different from the others, calling the series a uniquely [...] "director-driven show. It's almost like the episode prior doesn't set you up for how the next episode is going to go." ...|$|E
2500|$|Botham {{went on to}} Bucklers Mead Comprehensive School {{where he}} {{continued}} {{to do well in}} sport and played for the school's cricket and football teams. He became captain of their under-16 cricket team when he was thirteen. His performances for the school drew the attention of Somerset County Cricket Club's youth coach Bill Andrews. Still thirteen, he scored 80 runs on debut for Somerset's under-15s side against Wiltshire, but the team captain Phil Slocombe did not call on him to bowl as he considered him to be a specialist batsman. Two years later, Botham had the opportunity to choose between football and cricket: Bert Head, manager of Crystal Palace offered him apprentice forms with the First Division club. He already had a contract with Somerset and, after discussing the offer with his father, decided to continue to pursue a cricket career, as he believed he was a better cricketer. When informed {{that he wanted to be}} a sportsman, Botham's careers teacher said to him: [...] "Fine, everyone wants to play sport, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> really going to do?" ...|$|E

6000|$|Grace smiled. [...] "You look surprised! There is {{a library}} at Tarnside, {{although}} it is not often used, and we have books about the voyages of the buccaneers. One book <b>is</b> rather fascinating. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>were</b> <b>you</b> doing in the lagoons?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dreadful pity! <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> to do?" [...] He laughed comically. Then {{he became}} grave. [...] "No," [...] he said. [...] "She's an {{impossible}} person." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I won't, then. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> {{in such a}} {{hurry to}} have mother know for? She's not going to object. And if she does--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Quite so. Sentiment is a {{beautiful}} thing, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> going to do?' He did not condescend to particulars, but kept repeating the sentiment, which, as I promised, I record.|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear Frank," [...] {{said the}} other, [...] "if men selling horses could also sell their inward {{convictions}} with them, {{what a lot}} of articles of that description there would be in the market! <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>were</b> <b>you</b> going to say you'd do?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What! {{me go to}} a temperance meetin'?" [...] {{cried the}} trooper with {{something}} of scorn in his laugh. [...] "You might as well ask the devil to go to church! No, no, Armstrong, I'm past prayin' for--thank you all the same for invitin' me. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>you</b> askin' about news bein' true? What news?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Impossible," [...] said Otto. [...] "There's {{a little}} fly {{that has made}} up its mind to go into my nose. I can neither drive it away nor catch it while both hands are engaged with the oars, so there's no {{resource}} left but to screw my nose about. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>were</b> <b>you</b> going to say you delighted in?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hello yourself, Tommy Tit!" [...] shouted Peter joyously. [...] "My, my, my, but I {{am glad to}} see you! <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> {{doing up}} here in the Old Pasture yourself?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{heard the}} clock strike as I crossed the square," [...] she answered. [...] "I was sent for {{to go to}} the Hospital St. Denis. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> doing here?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Ah, {{it was a}} {{great day}} for me! A great day! The Regent was there, and a fine body of a man too! 'The ridgment is proud of you,' says he. 'And I'm proud of the ridgment,' say I. 'A damned good answer too!' says he to Lord Hill, and they both bu'st out a-laughin'. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>be</b> <b>you</b> a-peepin' out o' the window for?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have not}} the least idea he is worth a fourth of it, though I do not pretend to know. To me half a million of dollars seems {{a great deal of}} money, and I know my father {{considers}} himself poor--poor, at least, for one of his station. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>were</b> <b>you</b> about to say of political economy? I am curious to hear how THAT can have any thing to do with your handkerchief." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll do it, Sandy. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> it <b>you</b> <b>was</b> {{saying about}} unsacrilegious things, which people expect to get, {{and will be}} {{disappointed}} about?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{we are all}} agreed. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> {{thinking}} of, Sergeant?" [...] asked Oliver, addressing Quick, {{who stood}} {{in a corner of}} the room, lost apparently in contemplation of the floor.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{had better}} ask your master," [...] is the reply. The tone is suggestive of an {{unpleasant}} five minutes so {{soon as the}} girl shall have withdrawn, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> to do? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{guess it}} is," [...] replied Jerry, {{trying to be}} polite, [...] "though I like lily roots and clams better. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> {{going to do with}} it? Where is your storehouse?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> it <b>you</b> {{would have}} me do?" [...] asked Mr. Labouchere, who often had claimants on his bounty and his autographs.|$|R

6000|$|... "He {{came to my}} house. I put up with him, which I think {{describes}} it best, though I fail to see much reason for doing so any longer. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> {{going to do about}} the lode?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He did not. Willis {{was badly}} rattled {{and started for}} the muskeg. Thought he might get the track thrown across the hole, perhaps! I'm rather sorry for the kid. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> going to do about it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, you haven't!" [...] said Mary {{beginning}} to smooth her ruffled plumes. [...] "Well, I'm sorry I said it; <b>but</b> <b>what</b> explanations <b>are</b> <b>you</b> {{going to give}} of this scene? It must have surprised her very much." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Partly," [...] Freudenberg answered, [...] "because I {{was really}} {{curious to know}} <b>what</b> those fellows <b>were</b> driving at; and partly," [...] he added, [...] "because, alas! I am possessed of that restless spirit, that {{everlasting}} craving for adventures, which drives one on into any place where life stirs. I knew {{that these people were}} plotting something against me. I wanted to hear it with my own ears, to understand exactly <b>what</b> it <b>was</b> against which I must be prepared.
