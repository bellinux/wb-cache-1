5000|$|Oneindia gave a very {{positive}} review to the movie saying, [...] "Arakshaka is the best suspense-thriller made in the Kannada film industry in the recent years.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project is to explore the use of <b>story</b> <b>boxes</b> for school populations {{in which there are}} {{visually}} impaired children. <b>Story</b> <b>boxes</b> are boxes which accompany a story in which props and items related to a story are kept. The items in the box represent important characters and items in the text. As these students cannot see the pictures in the stories and gain information from them, a <b>story</b> <b>box</b> serves as a way to animate the text as it is read. The first objective of this project is to collect information and review literature on the topic of <b>story</b> <b>boxes</b> and needs {{of students with visual impairments}} during literary experiences. The second objective is to use information from the literature to develop instructions for creating <b>story</b> <b>boxes.</b> Additionally, four detailed lessons will be included as part of this project, they will integrate use of a <b>story</b> <b>box</b> in presenting a story...|$|R

5000|$|When Magic Carpet Magazine {{opened up}} as a {{companion}} to Weird Tales, Howard took some of the unsold Costigan stories and submitted them to the potential new market. The editor of both Magic Carpet and Weird Tales, Farnsworth Wright, was already publishing one story by Robert E. Howard, and requested the author use a pseudonym for the <b>boxing</b> <b>story.</b> Howard chose [...] "Patrick Ervin" [...] for himself, and then not wanting readers to question why someone named Ervin would write about Robert E. Howard's Steve Costigan character from Fight Stories, decided to change his main character’s name as well. Howard resurrected the “Dorgan” surname from an earlier <b>boxing</b> <b>story</b> that was changed to a Costigan yarn, and added the more alliterative first name of “Dennis.” Every other character in the story remained the same; {{the name of the}} ship, the crew, and the bulldog. Dorgan {{was little more than a}} disguise for Costigan. With the pseudonyms in place, Wright accepted four Dennis Dorgan stories. After the fact, Howard changed the name of the Sea Girl to the Python, and the Mike into Spike. Bill O’Brien, Mushy Hanson, and Sven Larson stayed the same.|$|R

5000|$|Years before writing [...] "Fifty Grand", Hemingway wrote a <b>boxing</b> <b>story</b> which {{appeared}} in the April 1916 edition of Oak Park High School’s literary magazine Tabula. This story, called [...] "A Matter of Colour", was more obviously comical than [...] "Fifty Grand", but the two bear several similarities, such as a non-protagonist narrator and a [...] "trickster out-tricked" [...] theme. Though authors today seldom write about <b>boxing,</b> <b>stories</b> like [...] "Fifty Grand" [...] were common and popular in the late 19th and early 20th century. For example, George Bernard Shaw's Cashel Byron's Profession, written in 1882 but not popular until about 20 years later, featured a prizefighter as its protagonist (though Shaw said the fight scenes in the novel were supposed to turn the public away from boxing). Jack London's [...] "A Piece of Steak" [...] was published in the Saturday Evening Post in November 1909. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle also wrote several <b>stories</b> about <b>boxing,</b> such as Rodney Stone and The Croxley Master, and made his famous Sherlock Holmes an amateur boxer. Octavus Roy Cohen's [...] "Last Blow", published on 2 October 1926 issue of Colliers,http://www.philsp.com/homeville/HanniganV2/t37.htm#A2960 appeared the year before [...] "Fifty Grand" [...] and P.
