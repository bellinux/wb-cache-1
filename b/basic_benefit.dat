5000|$|Sharma {{asserts that}} [...] "political compulsions {{have led the}} {{government}} to propose an imperfect model of VAT", as it 'goes against the basic premise of VAT', as it lacks both the removal of distortions in movement of goods across states and the uniformity in the tax structure. Chanchal Kumar Sharma (2005:929) states, [...] "Local or state level taxes like octroi, entry tax, lease tax, workers contract tax, entertainment tax and luxury tax are not integrated into the new regime, which goes against the basic premise of VAT, which is to have uniformity in the tax structure. The fact that no tax credit will be allowed for inter-state trade seriously undermines the <b>basic</b> <b>benefit</b> of enforcing a VAT system, namely {{the removal of the}} distortions in movement of goods across the states." ...|$|E
5000|$|Obamacare {{maintained}} {{the concept of}} health insurance exchanges as {{a key component of}} health care. President Obama stated that it should be [...] "a market where Americans can one-stop shop for a health care plan, compare benefits and prices, and choose the plan that's best for them, {{in the same way that}} Members of Congress and their families can. None of these plans should deny coverage on the basis of a preexisting condition, and all of these plans should include an affordable <b>basic</b> <b>benefit</b> package that includes prevention, and protection against catastrophic costs. I strongly believe that Americans should have the choice of a public health insurance option operating alongside private plans. This will give them a better range of choices, make the health care market more competitive, and keep insurance companies honest." [...] Although the House of Representatives had sought a single national exchange as well as a public option, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) as passed used state-based exchanges, and the public option was ultimately dropped from the bill after it did not win filibuster-proof support in the Senate. States may choose to join together to run multi-state exchanges, or they may opt out of running their own exchange, in which case the federal government will step in to create an exchange for use by their citizens.|$|E
50|$|Substantial {{increases}} {{were made}} to social security benefits such as married couple’s benefits, single benefits, and pensions. The <b>basic</b> <b>benefit</b> was also increased and sickness benefit was liberalised: where a married couple had both been in full-time employment for at least 12 months and intended to remain members of the regular workforce, a sickness benefit would be paid {{for up to three}} months at half the rate payable to married couples, if one couple became sick. There would be no income test on this. Prior to this reform, if a husband had fallen ill while his wife was working, no Social Security payment was made. Pensions were increased and state insurance rebates were also introduced for pensioners. Fathers became entitled to the Domestic Purposes Benefit in 1973, albeit under more restrictive conditions than those applying to mothers. In addition, the Xmas bonus was subsequently repeated in 1973 and 1974, while age benefits were adjusted six times from 1972 to 1975. The real incomes of many means-tested beneficiaries were further increased by the introduction of telephone, television, and rates rebates in 1973. In 1974, aid was given to help pay the insurance premiums on the homes of pensioners, and a major effort was undertaken to increase the availability of suitable accommodation for the elderly. Increased financial assistance was also provided to voluntary groups working with handicapped or underprivileged persons, while four weeks paid relief was provided for those caring for the disabled and handicapped at home. From January 1974 onwards, approved day-care centres for children received a government grant of $4.50 per week per child. In addition, wheelchair access to buildings was promoted.|$|E

This paper, examining the introduction of the <b>basic</b> <b>benefit</b> package and formal co-payments, elucidates how international involvement in Tajikistan's health sector has impacted on national health governance. Based on documentary sources and information provided by key informants, we find that external agencies have both strengthened and weakened national health governance. Although they have played a major part in supporting Tajikistan's health sector, these efforts have often been fragmented, as donor coordination was at times less than optimal. A key challenge for national health governance is the limited technical and institutional capacity of the Ministry of Health and further efforts are needed to build national capacity.

40|$|With the {{introduction}} of the Health Insurance Act in 2006 in the Netherlands, the basic package of the former sickness funds became valid for all citizens. The <b>basic</b> <b>benefit</b> package has been subject to change, responding to increasing health care expenditures, medical innovations and the economic crisis. In this paper we address the decision criteria used to assess the package annually since 2006 and describe some developments that do not follow the criteria, leading to a yo-yo effect. We discuss the formation of the decision for in- or exclusion and why some treatments seem to follow an, at first sight, arbitrary in- and exclusion pathway. We first describe the official way of establishing the <b>basic</b> <b>benefit</b> package and than will describe why some treatments follow a deviated path. We conclude that political pressure and pressure from interest groups may lead to inclusion or postponement of exclusion. Reform of the organization of certain forms of health care (in our example mental care) may lead to seemingly inconsequent changes. The yo-yo effect of some treatments or pharmaceuticals may have negative effects on health care providers, insurers and patients. The seemingly well defined criteria available for defining the basic package appear to be broadly interpretable and other influences may determine the final decision of inclusion or exclusion...|$|E

40|$|In the USSR in 1990, social {{security}} reforms {{led to the}} imposition of a uniform system of benefits in a large and demographically diverse country. This required inter-regional transfers, which are now no longer feasible with the demise of the USSR. Relatively high contribution rates also pose a problem for a nascent commercialized sector. The paper argues that benefit levels in some former Soviet Union countries are now unsustainable. The price shock associated with the “transition” to a market economy should lead to a consideration of a “mix” of policies, including a <b>basic</b> <b>benefit</b> in kind.

40|$|Since the 1970 s, the out-of-wedlock {{birthrate}} {{has been}} increasing rapidly in the United States and has prompted several states to propose (and in some cases, enact) legislation to deny access to higher AFDC benefits for families in which the mother gives birth while receiving AFDC. The authors investigate whether AFDC benefit levels are systematically related to the family-size decisions of never-married women. Using a Poisson Regression model, applied to Current Population Survey data from the years 1980 - 1988, they find that the <b>basic</b> <b>benefit</b> level positively influences family size for white and Hispanic women, but not for black women. Incremental benefits for larger families, however, do not affect family-size decisions, suggesting that reducing (or eliminating) this differential will not necessarily {{reduce the number of}} illegitimate births. The <b>basic</b> <b>benefit</b> level positively affects the family-size decision of high school dropouts, but not of high school graduates. This suggests that to discourage nonmarital births, policymakers should consider altering the AFDC benefit structure {{in such a way as}} to encourage single mothers to complete high school. However, being a high school dropout might be a proxy for some other underlying characteristic of the woman, and inducing women to complete high school who otherwise would not might have no effect whatsoever on nonmarital births. ...|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} {{the extent to which}} the technologies expected to emerge from genetic research are likely to be covered under Government-mandated health insurance programs such as those being proposed by advocates of national health reform. Genetic technologies are divided into three broad categories; genetic information services, including screening, testing, and counseling; experimental technologies; and gene therapy. This article concludes that coverage of these technologies under national health reform is uncertain. The <b>basic</b> <b>benefits</b> packages provided for in the major health reform plans are likely to provide partial coverage of experimental technologies; relatively broad coverage of information services; and varying coverage of gene therapies, on the basis of an evaluation of their costs, benefits, and the degree to which they raise objections on political and religious grounds. Genetic services that are not included in the <b>basic</b> <b>benefits</b> package will be available only to those who can purchase supplemental insurance or to those who can purchase the services with personal funds.

40|$|Objective: To {{examine the}} {{prevalence}} and determinants of <b>basic</b> and/or attendance <b>benefits</b> among children {{involved with the}} child welfare system (CWS). Design: A register study of all children involved with CWS in Norway from 1997 - 2006. Participants: 96, 354 children from the CWS group and 149, 030 children who had never been in the CWS as a comparison group. Results: 11 % of children involved with CWS received <b>basic</b> and/or attendance <b>benefits</b> compared to 3 % in the comparison group. In multivariate logistic regression, the boys’ chances of ever receiving <b>basic</b> and/or attendance <b>benefits</b> were greater than the girls’ chances. The chances of receiving benefits increased nearly four to sixfold as a child becomes older. However, they decrease as the age at debut to CWS increases. It was also revealed that those children who stayed under child welfare for two or more years had an increased chance of ever receiving <b>basic</b> and/or attendance <b>benefits.</b> For children with reported behavioral disorders, the chances of <b>basic</b> and/or attendance <b>benefits</b> were nearly twofold. For children under home-based support and medication interventions, the chances of receiving <b>basic</b> and/or attendance <b>benefits</b> were greater than for children who were not under these interventions. Conclusion: Chronic health conditions that claim <b>basic</b> and/or attendance <b>benefits</b> were more prevalent among children involved with CWS than the general children’s population.
