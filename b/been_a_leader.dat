5|$|Churchill has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>leader</b> of Colorado AIM's annual {{protests in}} Denver against the Columbus Day holiday and its {{associated}} parade. Colorado AIM's leadership has come into conflict with some leaders in the Denver Italian American community, the main supporters of the parade. As early as 2004, Churchill had claimed that such parades are unconstitutional, arguing that the Ninth Amendment to the Constitution provides Native Americans with a right not {{to be subjected to}} such displays, overriding the First Amendment rights of non-Native Americans.|$|E
5|$|Ecgfrith succeeded Oswiu as king of Northumbria in 670. Soon after, the Picts rose in {{rebellion}} against Northumbrian subjugation at the Battle of Two Rivers, {{recorded in the}} 8th century by Stephen of Ripon, hagiographer of Wilfrid. Ecgfrith was aided by a sub-king, Beornhæth, who may have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>leader</b> of the Southern Picts, and the rebellion ended in disaster for the Northern Picts of Fortriu. Their king, Drest mac Donuel, was deposed {{and was replaced by}} Bridei mac Bili.|$|E
5|$|Nhất Hạnh {{has also}} <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>leader</b> in the Engaged Buddhism {{movement}} (he coined the term), promoting the individual's {{active role in}} creating change. He cites the 13th-century Vietnamese king Trần Nhân Tông with the origination of the concept. Trần Nhân Tông abdicated his throne to become a monk and founded the Vietnamese Buddhist school of the Bamboo Forest tradition.|$|E

5|$|In 1787, Hamilton {{served as}} assemblyman from New York County in the New York State Legislature and {{was chosen as}} a {{delegate}} for the Constitutional Convention by his father-in-law Philip Schuyler. Even though Hamilton had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>leader</b> in calling for a new Constitutional Convention, his direct influence at the Convention itself was quite limited. Governor George Clinton's faction in the New York legislature had chosen New York's other two delegates, John Lansing, Jr. and Robert Yates, {{and both of them}} opposed Hamilton's goal of a strong national government. Thus, whenever the other two members of the New York delegation were present, they decided New York's vote, to ensure that there were no major alterations to the Articles of Confederation.|$|E
5|$|Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>leader</b> in laser-driven {{inertial}} confinement fusion (ICF) since the initial concept {{was developed by}} LLNL employee John Nuckols in the late 1950s. The basic idea was to use a driver to compress a small pellet known as the target that contains the fusion fuel, a mix of deuterium (D) and tritium (T). If the compression reaches high enough values, fusion reactions begin to take place, releasing alpha particles and neutrons. The alphas may impact atoms in the surrounding fuel, heating them {{to the point where}} they undergo fusion as well. If the rate of alpha heating is higher than heat losses to the environment, the result is a self-sustaining chain reaction known as ignition.|$|E
5|$|The United States has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>leader</b> in {{technological}} innovation {{since the late}} 19th century and scientific research since the mid-20th century. Methods for producing interchangeable parts were developed by the U.S. War Department by the Federal Armories {{during the first half}} of the 19th century. This technology, along with the establishment of a machine tool industry, enabled the U.S. to have large scale manufacturing of sewing machines, bicycles and other items in the late 19th century and became known as the American system of manufacturing. Factory electrification in the early 20th century and introduction of the assembly line and other labor saving techniques created the system called mass production.|$|E

5|$|On June 19, 2013, Microsoft {{announced}} (in {{response to}} the negative reaction) that it would reverse its changes to Xbox One's DRM and game licensing model. As with Xbox 360, users {{would be able to}} share and resell physical games without restrictions, and beyond a mandatory software update upon the console's initial setup process to enable playback of Blu-ray and DVD video, the console would not require a permanent internet connection to operate. These changes required the family sharing features, along with the ability to play games without their disc after installation, to be dropped. Xbox One chief product officer Marc Whitten stated that the family sharing feature may return in the future, but could not be implemented on launch due to time restraints. Don Mattrick, the then president of Microsoft's Interactive Entertainment Business, stated that the licensing changes were in {{response to the}} negative public reaction. Other analysts believed that the change was in direct response of Sony's aggressive position during its E3 press conference. Mattrick, who had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>leader</b> in Xbox One development, announced his departure from Microsoft on July 1, 2013, to become CEO of Zynga. Analysts speculated that his departure was predicated on the poor response and subsequent reversal of the plans for Xbox One.|$|E

Carnegie also founded the Union Railroad in 1894 for heavy freight services and it still serves the area's steel industry, while George Westinghouse's Wabtec has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>leader</b> in rail engines and switching since 1869.|$|E
25|$|Schumer has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>leader</b> in {{the fight}} to {{continue}} fully funding the FIRE Grant program administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The program allows fire departments and first responders nationwide to apply for grant funding for major purchases that localities have difficulty providing, namely apparatus and emergency vehicles. When the Bush administration pushed a plan to reduce the program from $1 billion to just under $300 million, Schumer helped lead an effort with local firefighters to block the cuts.|$|E
25|$|The United States has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>leader</b> in {{technological}} innovation {{since the late}} 19th century and scientific research since the mid 20th century.

Thomas Edison's laboratory developed the phonograph, the first long-lasting light bulb, and the first viable movie camera. Nikola Tesla pioneered the AC induction motor and high frequency power transmission used in radio. In the early 20th century, the automobile companies of Ransom E. Olds and Henry Ford popularized the assembly line. The Wright brothers, in 1903, made the first sustained and controlled heavier-than-air powered flight.|$|E
