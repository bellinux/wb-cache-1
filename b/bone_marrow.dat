40|$|Background: Bone {{cancer pain}} seriously affects {{the quality of}} life of cancer patients. Our {{previous}} study found that endogenous formaldehyde was produced by cancer cells metastasized into <b>bone</b> <b>marrows</b> and played an important role in bone cancer pain. However, the mechanism of production of this endogenous formaldehyde by metastatic cancer cells was unknown in bone cancer pain rats. Lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD 1) is one of the major enzymes catalyzing the production of formaldehyde. The expression of LSD 1 and the concentration of formaldehyde were up-regulated in many high-risk tumors. Objective: This study aimed to investigate whether LSD 1 in metastasized MRMT- 1 breast cancer cells in <b>bone</b> <b>marrows</b> participated in the production of endogenous formaldehyde in bone cancer pain rats. Methodology/Principal Findings: Concentration of the endogenous formaldehyde was measured by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Endogenous formaldehyde dramatically increased in cultured MRMT- 1 breast cancer cells in vitro, in <b>bone</b> <b>marrows</b> and sera of bone cancer pain rats, in tumor tissues and sera of MRMT- 1 subcutaneous vaccination model rats in vivo. Formaldehyde at a concentration as low as the above measured (3 mM) induced pain behaviors in normal rats. The expression of LSD 1 which mainly located in nuclei of cancer cells significantly increased in <b>bone</b> <b>marrows</b> o...|$|R

5|$|The {{clinical}} {{signs and symptoms}} of AML result from the growth of leukemic clone cells, which tends to displace or interfere with the development of normal blood cells in the <b>bone</b> <b>marrow.</b> This leads to neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. The symptoms of AML are, in turn, often due to the low numbers of these normal blood elements. In rare cases, people with AML can develop a chloroma, or solid tumor of leukemic cells outside the <b>bone</b> <b>marrow,</b> which can cause various symptoms depending on its location.|$|E

40|$|Mice {{exposed to}} high {{concentrations}} of ethanol vapour (25 - 38 mg/l of inhaled air) for 24 h develop leucopenia, neutropenia, lymphopenia, monocytopenia and thrombocytopenia but not anaemia or macrocytosis. Their <b>bone</b> <b>marrows</b> usually give normal deoxyuridine-suppressed values and contain normal numbers of granulocyte-macrophage progenitor cells and slightly reduced numbers of megakaryocytes. Mice exposed to lower concentrations of ethanol vapour (10 - 25 mg/l of inhaled air) for 20 - 43 days develop thrombocytopenia only and, like the mice exposed for 24 h, do not develop anaemia or macrocytosis. The <b>bone</b> <b>marrows</b> of mice exposed to ethanol for 24 h or for 20 - 43 days, did not show either megaloblastic or sideroblastic erythropoiesis.

30|$|Guided bone {{regeneration}} (GBR) is {{a valuable}} procedure that uses a membrane to reconstruct bone defect in the oral and maxillofacial area [1]. As a barrier of bone defect, a membrane guards the region from invasion of in-growth cells from fibrous connective tissue and promotes a favorable environment for cells derived from <b>bone</b> <b>marrows</b> [2]. For achieving a competent result, the GBR barrier membrane requires certain properties such as bioactivity, biocompatibility, cell viability, and space-maintaining ability during the bone healing process [1].|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Rho kinases (ROCKs) are serine-threonine protein kinases that {{regulate}} the actin cytoskeleton. Recent {{studies suggest that}} ROCKs also {{play an important role}} in cardiovascular disease. However, the isoform- and tissue-specific role of ROCKs in mediating this process is unknown. Using homologous recombination, we generated mutant mice harboring alleles with homozygous deletion of ROCK 1 (ROCK 1 –/ –). Most ROCK 1 –/ – mice die perinatally. However, a few ROCK 1 –/ – mice survive to adulthood, are phenotypically normal, and have no apparent compensatory changes in ROCK 2. Using these ROCK 1 –/ – mice, we show that ROCK 1 in bone marrow-derived macrophages is critical to the development of atherosclerosis, in part, by mediating foam cell formation and macrophage chemotaxis. Lipid accumulation and atherosclerotic lesions were reduced in atherosclerosis-prone LDLR –/ – mice, whose <b>bone</b> <b>marrows</b> have been replaced with <b>bone</b> <b>marrows</b> derived from ROCK 1 –/– mice. Bone marrow-derived ROCK 1 -deficient macrophages exhibited impaired chemotaxis to monocyte chemotactic protein- 1 and showed reduced ability to take up lipids and to develop into foam cells when exposed to modified low-density lipoprotein. These findings indicate that ROCK 1 in bone marrow-derived cells is a critical mediator of atherogenesis and suggest that macrophage ROCK 1 may be an important therapeutic target for vascular inflammation and atherosclerosis. —Wang...|$|R
