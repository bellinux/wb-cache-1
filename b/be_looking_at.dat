Many important artificial intelligence applications like vision or natural language require simply {{enormous amounts of}} information about the world: the program needs to have some idea of what it might <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> or what it is talking about. This requires that the program know most of the same things about the world that a child does. Researchers soon discovered that this was a truly vast amount of information. No one in 1970 could build a database so large and no one knew how a program might learn so much information.|$|E
5|$|While {{portraying the}} bonds between {{the members of}} Class Zero, and between them and their summoned monsters, along with the game's themes of death and war, Naora drew {{inspiration}} from {{when he saw a}} cat killed by a car surrounded by other cats. Nomura was in charge of choosing the voice cast, which featured several well-known voice actors. When listening to the samples and picking the actors, Nomura focused on whether they could successfully project the characters' personalities. The actors and actresses helped define the characters, adding individual touches during voice recording sessions. Sayoko Hoshino acted as the game's character texture artist. Originally, she was going to put in black voids where a female character's panties would have been due to hardware limitations. However the staff realized that the players would <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> the backs of characters a lot, so Hoshino designed panties for each female character and worked with the staff to incorporate them into the character models.|$|E

25|$|Self-objectification can {{increase}} in situations which heighten {{the awareness of}} an individual’s physical appearance. Here, {{the presence of a}} third person observer is enhanced.

Examples of the enhanced presence of an observer include the presence of an audience, camera, or other known observer.|$|E

25|$|Gardner {{argues that}} there is a wide range of {{cognitive}} abilities, but that there are only very weak correlations among them. For example, the theory postulates that a child who learns to multiply easily is not necessarily more intelligent than a child who has more difficulty on this task.

500|$|The message {{behind the}} verses' {{recurring}} lines [...] "I do, I do" [...] and [...] "Should someone <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> me" [...] has invited conflicting interpretations. Leng {{suggests that in}} the first of these lines, Harrison might be restating his marriage vow, and that the second line is an early example of the singer viewing his life [...] "as a battle with an unseen enemy waiting to pounce". To Inglis, the characters in [...] "Let It Down" [...] are engaged in an adulterous affair, with the [...] "constant threat" [...] of being discovered – hence the conclusion to verse one: [...] "Hiding it all behind anything I see / Should someone <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> me." ...|$|E

500|$|Flight Unlimited was a {{commercial}} success. It debuted in twelfth {{place on a}} June 1995 sales chart compiled by NPD Group, while Microsoft Flight Simulator 5.1 took first place. The game went on to sell more than 300,000 copies by 1997, and more than 780,000 by 2002. According to Constantine von Hoffman of the Boston Herald, Flight Unlimited successfully competed with Microsoft Flight Simulator. PC Gamers Lee Buchanan wrote that it [...] "soars above the pack of flight simulations", and he considered it to be [...] "the most fun [...] had in a computerized cockpit". Frank Vizard of Popular Mechanics hailed it as [...] "the new top gun of flight simulators", and Doug Bailey of The Boston Globe considered {{it to be the}} [...] "first real serious challenge to Microsoft's dominance of the genre". The Records David Noack believed that the game's physics and stereoscopic terrain set [...] "a new standard in flight simulation". Writing for Computer Gaming World, Bob and John Nolan stated, [...] "If anything, you should at least {{take a look at this}} product, because you'll <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> the future of simulations." ...|$|E

500|$|Reception of {{the race}} was mainly negative. Italian {{newspaper}} Corriere dello Sport – Stadio called it [...] "boring", while fellow Italian paper Corriere della Sera wrote of [...] "Formula One like a sleeping pill". Sky Sports described the race as [...] "mundane" [...] and [...] "soporific". Spanish newspaper Sport highlighted Max Verstappen's [...] "spectacular" [...] overtaking as bringing [...] "the only colour" [...] into the race. The Independent wrote, referring to Hamilton's desperate attempts to pass Rosberg: [...] "If {{there was ever a}} race which confirmed that Formula One should <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> ways to facilitate overtaking, this was it." [...] In the wake of his experience, Hamilton called for Formula One to adjust rules to enhance overtaking, saying: [...] "I guess for fans it's probably not too exciting to watch. Of course, it's always nice when you're at the front, as we have been for some time now - but still, being able to race is what... and also down the back, {{the rest of the field}} is probably what fans want to see. That's probably a change that would be looked positively on." [...] Sebastian Vettel agreed, calling for more grip created by the tyres to make it easier to follow a car closely.|$|E
500|$|Because of his {{aggressive}} style-of-play, Selwood {{has gathered}} {{a reputation as}} a [...] "head–over–the–ball specialist" [...] and for consistently putting himself in positions to break tackles and win free kicks. His ability to [...] "buckle his knees, (get) down and pull his arm up so that the tackler's arm goes up above the neck" [...] has been declared by former Hawthorn captain Shane Crawford as [...] "almost impossible to stop at times" [...] and is reflected in his regular standing among league leaders for total free kicks received. It has also led to opposition players noting specific techniques to tackling Selwood—Carlton’s Kade Simpson admitted it was important to [...] "get in low" [...] because [...] "he’s such a master at lifting the elbows, which tries to slip the tackle up around the neck ... there’s no doubt it’s a skill". Selwood has declared the technique as a [...] "benefit and an advantage I’m getting at the moment on someone else because I see a weakness in what they are doing ... the majority of the time they are doing 95 per cent of the tackle right. It’s just that five per cent where I can use my upper body strength, I can dip at the knees slightly". Former Brisbane Lions captain Michael Voss agrees, stating [...] "all he’s doing is keeping his feet, dropping his legs and he’s got a fantastic tenchique in rolling his shoulder ... Selwood shouldn’t be penalised because he’s stronger than the tackler. If I was playing today and I could develop that technique, I’d <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> it".|$|E
