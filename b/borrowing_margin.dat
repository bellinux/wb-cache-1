40|$|Recently, {{sharing the}} {{radio access network}} (RAN) has become an {{important}} issue for 3 G and beyond mobile wireless operators. In addition to user and service considerations, there are economic and technical advantages to 3 G and beyond shared networks. This is driving optimizations in the deployment and development of national 3 G and 4 G rollouts. However, shared 3 G and 4 G networks exhibit many of the resource management opportunities and challenges as more complex heterogeneous traffic and sharing techniques are considered. In this paper, we propose a roaming-based sharing adaptive partitioning with borrowing (APB) scheme where an operator is allowed to borrow from the unutilized resources originally belonging to other operators sharing the same RAN. This algorithm controls the resource sharing between the operators in addition to controlling the admission control (CAC) within each operator's domain. The <b>borrowing</b> <b>margin</b> is specified either as a fixed portion or an adaptive percentage of the unutilized resource. Furthermore, the APB CAC function makes a distinction between newly originating calls and handoff calls by assuming a higher priority level for handoff calls {{in the form of}} possibility of queuing...|$|E

40|$|Using {{geometric}} illustrations, {{we investigate}} what implications of portfolio optimization in equilibrium {{can be generated}} by the simple mean-variance framework, under margin bor-rowing restrictions. First, we investigate the case of uniform marginability on all risky assets. It is shown that changing from unlimited <b>borrowing</b> to <b>margin</b> <b>borrowing</b> shifts the market portfolio to a riskier combination, accompanied by a higher risk premium and a lower price of risk. With the linear risk-return preference, more stringent margin requirements lead to a riskier market portfolio, contrary to the conventional belief. Second, we investigate the effects of differential marginability on portfolio optimization by allowing {{only one of the}} risky assets to be pledged as collateral. It is shown that the resulting optimal portfolio is not always tilted towards holding more of the marginable asset, when the margin requirement is loosened.

2500|$|If {{the short}} {{position}} {{begins to move}} against the holder of the short position (i.e., {{the price of the}} security begins to rise), money is removed from the holder's cash balance and moved to their margin balance. [...] If short shares continue to rise in price, and the holder does not have sufficient funds in the cash account to cover the position, the holder begins to <b>borrow</b> on <b>margin</b> for this purpose, thereby accruing margin interest charges. [...] These are computed and charged just as for any other margin debit. Therefore, only margin accounts can be used to open a short position.|$|R
50|$|The Pattern Day Trading rule {{regulates the}} use of margin and is defined only for margin accounts. Cash accounts, by definition, do not <b>borrow</b> on <b>margin,</b> so day trading is subject to {{separate}} rules regarding Cash Accounts. Cash account holders may still engage in certain day trades, {{as long as the}} activity does not result in free riding, which is the sale of securities bought with unsettled funds. An instance of free-riding will cause a cash account to be restricted for 90 days to purchasing securities with cash up front. Under Regulation T, brokers must “freeze” an investor’s account for 90 days if he/she sells securities that have not been fully paid (i.e.,paid for with unavailable funds). During this 90-day period, the investor must fully pay for any purchase on the date of the trade.|$|R
40|$|The authors show that, {{when some}} investors hold levered {{portfolios}} {{by engaging in}} <b>margin</b> <b>borrowing,</b> repeated rounds of trading can result in market instability [...] {{in the sense that}} prices can move rationally [...] {{even in the absence of}} any change in fundamentals. They show this with a simple model in which all agents are rational and symmetrically informed. The authors discuss welfare implications of price stability and explore the effects of market composition and market trading rules on the stability of the market. A major result of this article is that price limits might enhance market stability by excluding potentially destabilizing market prices. Copyright 1998 by University of Chicago Press. ...|$|R
40|$|An {{increase}} in margin requirements in the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange {{is followed by}} a decline in <b>margin</b> <b>borrowing,</b> trading volume, the proportion of trading performed through margin accounts, the growth in stock prices, and the conditional volatility of daily returns. The nonmarginable Second Section stocks show a smaller change in volatility and only a delayed weak price response. The hypothesis that margin requirements restrict the behavior of destabilizing speculators can explain these correlations but cannot explain the observation that individuals, the most active users of margin funds, appear to be good market timers.

40|$|We {{propose a}} Separation Theorem of Active Management. It asserts {{that in the}} {{so-called}} Enhanced Active Portfolio framework the efficient frontier is linear in the active return/active risk space, and one can separate the determination of optimal active portfolio weights from the determination of optimal leverage ratio. The risk preference of investors does not play any role in the former decision. The theorem holds under a fairly general set of conditions on portfolio restrictions. As such it enlightens {{to understand how the}} optimal overall portfolio is determined under realistic portfolio constraints, and how, given a specification of a tracking error, the optimal leverage ratio is determined. In Japan the enhanced prime brokerage structure, which enables the short-extension without <b>borrowing</b> on <b>margin,</b> is yet to come. An idea to overcome this institutional incompleteness is to use the futures contract to construct Synthetic Enhanced Active Strategies. A typical 130 / 30 -enhanced active strategy is replaced by (1) 100 % long position in individual stocks, (2) (30 +f) % long position in index futures, and (3) (30 +f) % short position in individual stocks. We explain how this problem can be formulated as an optimal portfolio problem, and show that the synthetic strategy is very cost-effective as long as the required short-extension is not too large. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{examine the}} effect of central banking on funding {{liquidity}} from 1815 - 1925. Our study is motivated by the fact that this period experienced the dismantlement of the Second Bank of the US (1816 - 1836), a quasi-central bank, and the creation of the Federal Reserve (1915 - 1925), a modern lender-of-last resort. We exploit the seasonal nature of early US financial markets to identify the impact of funding liquidity shocks on market volatility, stock returns, and market liquidity. US markets were often illiquid and prone to crises in September and October because of financial stress from the harvest. Using the call loan rate (the interest rate at which traders <b>borrowed</b> on <b>margin)</b> as a direct measure of funding liquidity, we find that market volatility was much higher and market liquidity significantly lower in September and October than {{during the rest of the}} year. However, there was no such difference during the periods when there were financial institutions such as the Second Bank of the US (1816 - 1836) and the Federal Reserve (1915 - 1925) that could reduce funding liquidity risk.

40|$|The Greek debt {{restructuring}} of 2012 {{showed that the}} legal terms of sovereign bonds can protect creditors against losses, in particular the type of governing law. This paper studies whether sovereign bonds that are issued in foreign jurisdictions trade at a premium vis-a-vis domestic-law bonds. We use the Eurozone between 2007 and 2014 as a unique testing ground to assess this ``legal safety premium'' and collect secondary market bond yield data for the near-universe of Eurozone government bonds issued in foreign jurisdictions. Controlling for currency risk, liquidity risk, and term structure, we find that foreign-law bonds indeed carry lower yields on average. But a sizable premium only emerges for large values of credit risk (CDS spreads beyond 500 bp). At those levels, a 100 bp increase in CDS spreads {{is associated with a}} 30 - 80 bp larger yield premium on foreign-law bonds. In contrast, we do not find a premium for countries that are perceived as low risk. These results indicate that sovereigns in distress can, at the <b>margin,</b> <b>borrow</b> at lower rates under foreign law...|$|R
40|$|The first essay investigates how credit risk, {{the risk}} that a bond issuer will default, affects bond market liquidity. Specifically, we depart from the current {{literature}} in that we analyze the direct and indirect channels through which credit risk affects market liquidity, rather than determining whether both are priced in the bond. We focus on the Italian sovereign bond market, which allows us to determine how central bank interventions affect {{the sensitivity of the}} liquidity provision by market makers to default risk. We motivate our empirical analysis with a simple model of a risk averse market maker, holding an inventory of a risky asset and setting her optimal marginal quotes (and, therefore, the optimal bid-ask spread), in the presence of <b>margin</b> constraints and <b>borrowing</b> costs. The <b>margins,</b> set by a clearing house, depend on the risk of the asset, as measured by the CDS spread, and the actions of the central bank. The CDS market is fundamental to the market maker’s and the clearing house’s decisions, since it is from the CDS market that they deduce the future volatility of the asset return. In addition, the market maker can pledge her assets at the central bank to finance her positions at rates influenced by the central bank’s actions. The model provides several empirical predictions that we test in the empirical section of the paper...|$|R
