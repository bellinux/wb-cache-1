5|$|A 1994 {{analysis}} of Ramanujan's medical records and symptoms by Dr. D. A. B. Young concluded that his medical symptomsmdash&including his past relapses, fevers and hepatic conditionsmdash&were {{much closer to}} those resulting from hepatic amoebiasis, an illness then widespread in Madras, rather than tuberculosis. He had two episodes of dysentery <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> India. When not properly treated, dysentery can lie dormant for years and lead to hepatic amoebiasis, whose diagnosis was not then well established. Amoebiasis was a treatable and often curable disease at the time.|$|E

5|$|After the NSDAP came {{to power}} in Germany in 1933, Franck {{resigned}} his post in protest against the dismissal of fellow academics. He assisted Frederick Lindemann in helping dismissed Jewish scientists find work overseas, <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> Germany in November 1933. After a year at the Niels Bohr Institute in Denmark, he moved to the United States, where he worked at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore and then the University of Chicago. During this period he became interested in photosynthesis.|$|E
5|$|Antonio Banderas was {{the first}} actor to secure {{a role in the}} film. He was cast as Ché when Glenn Gordon Caron was hired to direct the film, and {{remained}} involved when Stone returned to the project. <b>Before</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> the project, Stone had considered casting Michelle Pfeiffer in the lead role of Eva, and this was confirmed in July 1994. Pfeiffer left the production when she became pregnant with her second child. Parker also considered Glenn Close, along with Streep, to play Eva.|$|E
5|$|As the Second World War progressed, Sellers {{continued}} {{to develop his}} drumming skills, and played {{with a series of}} touring bands, including those of Oscar Rabin, Henry Hall and Waldini, as well as his father's quartet, <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> and joined a band from Blackpool. Sellers {{became a member of the}} Entertainments National Service Association (ENSA), which provided entertainment for British forces and factory workers during the war. Sellers also performed comedy routines at these concerts, including impersonations of George Formby, with Sellers accompanying his own singing on ukulele.|$|E

5|$|At a {{literary}} salon in January 1909, Pound met the novelist Olivia Shakespear {{and her daughter}} Dorothy, who became his wife in 1914. Through Olivia Shakespear he was introduced to her former lover W. B. Yeats, in Pound's view the greatest living poet. Pound had sent Yeats a copy of A Lume Spento the previous year, <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> for Venice, and Yeats had apparently found it charming. The men became close friends, although Yeats was older by 20 years.|$|E
5|$|By late 1940 Naujocks {{had been}} removed from his {{position}} after he fell out of favour with Heydrich. The counterfeiting unit continued under Langer <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> in early 1942 at which point it closed down; he later stated that over 18 months, the unit had produced around £3 million in forged notes; the historian Anthony Pirie puts the figure at £500,000. Most of the currency produced in Operation Andreas was never used.|$|E
5|$|In 1900, Dunne {{moved to}} New York. Dooley's musings, since the war, had been entirely on affairs outside Chicago, with no Bridgeport columns, as Dunne needed {{to satisfy the}} demands of a {{national}} audience. In January 1900, just <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> the Journal, he wrote a Bridgeport piece, in which many of the earlier ones were recalled. This was the last Dooley piece written for a newspaper not to be syndicated; it appeared exclusively in the Journal.|$|E

5|$|Kundla was {{succeeded by}} Bowling Green head coach Bill Fitch. Fitch {{remained}} with the Gophers for two seasons before being {{hired by the}} Cleveland Cavaliers as their first head coach in 1970 {{to make the leap}} to the NBA, where he later won an NBA title as coach of the Boston Celtics. Fitch did recruit Jim Brewer <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>left,</b> laying the first seed for the 1972 Big Ten title. George Hanson, a longtime assistant coach at the school, was hired as his replacement, but resigned after only one season.|$|E
5|$|Like Maradona, Ronaldo only {{stayed a}} short time <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> for Internazionale. However, new heroes emerged, such as Luís Figo, Patrick Kluivert, Luis Enrique and Rivaldo, and the team won a Copa del Rey and La Liga double in 1998. In 1999, the club celebrated its centenari, winning the Primera División title, and Rivaldo became the fourth Barcelona player to be awarded European Footballer of the Year. Despite this {{domestic}} success, the failure to emulate Real Madrid in the Champions League led to van Gaal and Núñez resigning in 2000.|$|E
5|$|On January 7, 1989, Reagan {{underwent}} surgery at Walter Reed Army Medical Center {{to repair a}} Dupuytren's contracture of the ring finger of his left hand. The surgery lasted {{for more than three}} hours and was performed under regional anesthesia. This procedure was done just thirteen days <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> office. For this reason he had a hand and finger bandage the day of his farewell speech and the day of the inauguration of George H. W. Bush.|$|E

5|$|While the {{previous}} two films had concentrated on the Caribbean and Europe, Goldfinger was chosen by Eon for the third film, with the American cinema market in mind. Because Terence Young was refused {{a share of the}} profits, he declined to direct Goldfinger and worked on The Amorous Adventures of Moll Flanders instead, although he had done some pre-production work <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>left.</b> In his place, Eon turned to Guy Hamilton to direct; he was keen to inject elements of humour into the series, have more gadgets and build bigger and more elegant sets.|$|E
5|$|After Wade's resignation, Crisp {{was again}} {{retained}} {{on the football}} staff. Working under Frank Thomas, Crisp continued in his role of line coach, and again won {{a share of the}} national championship after the 1934 season. Under Thomas, Crisp's role outside of his duties as the line coach was that of the team disciplinarian to compliment the soft-spoken, diplomatic style of Thomas. He continued in his role as line coach {{through the end of the}} 1941 season when he took a leave of absence to serve as a civilian physical training instructor for the U.S. Navy pre-flight school at the University of Georgia. He then returned to Alabama and again served as line coach for the 1945 season, <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> to take an assistant coaching position with the Miami Seahawks.|$|E
5|$|Arcadelt wrote over 200 madrigals <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> Italy in 1551 {{to return}} to France, where he spent the {{remainder}} of his life; his numerous chansons date from this and subsequent years. In 1557 he published a book of masses, dedicated to his new employer, Charles de Guise, Cardinal of Lorraine (Arcadelt was maître de chapelle, i.e. choirmaster for him). In this publication he was mentioned {{as a member of the}} royal chapel, and therefore must have served both Henry II (died 1559) and Charles IX during this late phase of his career. In Paris he employed the publishing house of Le Roy and Ballard, who printed his abundant chansons, masses and motets just as the Venetian printers had earlier printed his madrigals.|$|E

50|$|Tomb of King Mindon Min - King Mindon died in 1878. He was {{the tenth}} of the Konbaung dynasty, {{which was founded in}} 1753. <b>Before</b> <b>he</b> died, <b>he</b> <b>left</b> {{instructions}} that his body should be buried and not cremated, thus violating the time-honoured custom of burning the dead bodies {{of the members of the}} royal family. The mausoleum erected over his remains within the Mandalay Palace enclosure is a good specimen of Burmese work in glass mosaic.|$|R
5|$|<b>Before</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> for Cranfield Braham was {{involved}} in another car accident which removed him from duty. He was injured when the Austin 7 {{in which he was}} travelling left the road at speed. He had been on a night out celebrating his success. The five passengers (three officers and two girls) were all wounded, but one of the women later died in hospital. Once recovered Bob survived two scares on duty at Cranfield. On 13 March a Beaufighter's engines cut out forcing him to make an emergency landing, and on the same day, his second flight ended with the aircraft's engines catching fire. Braham managed to conduct a safe landing.|$|E
5|$|Between 1895 and 1914, {{he lived}} in Switzerland (except for one year in Prague, 1911–12), where he {{received}} his academic diploma from the Swiss Federal Polytechnic in Zürich (later the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule, ETH) in 1900. He later taught there at the same institute {{as a professor of}} theoretical physics between 1912 and 1914 <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> for Berlin. In 1901, after being stateless for more than five years, Einstein acquired Swiss citizenship, which he kept {{for the rest of his}} life. In 1905, Einstein was awarded a PhD by the University of Zürich. The same year, his annus mirabilis (miracle year), he published four groundbreaking papers, which were to bring him to the notice of the academic world, at the age of 26.|$|E
