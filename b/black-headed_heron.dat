50|$|There is a bird {{sanctuary}} bordering the dam to the west, {{with the goal}} of protecting birds that are not classified as game birds.The reservoir is home to a variety of bird life, with as many as seventy species being recorded at different times of the year including 11 species of herons and egrets, 14 species of ducks and geese and 24 species of waders. In summer the shallows are used by waders, and <b>Black-headed</b> and Grey <b>Herons,</b> Cattle Egret, Reed Cormorant and African Spoonbill breed in the reed beds {{in the center of the}} shallows when they are surrounded by water.Orange-breasted Waxbill and Fan-tailed Cisticola are found in the reeds and grasses around the reservoir.|$|R
40|$|Multi-species heronry at Soor Sarovar Bird Sanctuary, Agra was {{studied for}} some {{breeding}} and ecological aspects. This is an established heronry in semi-arid region {{with less than}} 600 mm rainfall and temperature range of 2 oC to 48 oC. Two near threatened (Black-headed Ibis and Darter) and twelve least concerned species nested in colony during late summer and rainy season. They were categorized as the early arrivers (Black-crowned Night Heron, Little Egret, Cattle Egret, Darter and Grey Heron), late arrivers (Intermediate Egret, Indian Pond <b>Heron,</b> Great Egret, <b>Black-headed</b> Ibis, Purple <b>Heron</b> and Asian Openbill) and very late arrivers (Eurasian Spoonbill, Little Cormorant and Indian Cormorant). Total Nest occupancy at a time followed the rainfall pattern of the locality. Nest occupancy calendar was recorded {{in the form of}} pre-egg laying, egg laying and chick rearing dates for all the species. Nesting height-bird size hypothesis was checked as mixed results as the stratum specific birds proved the hypothesis right, while stratum interface birds suggested relook of the hypothesis. Heronry threat, disturbance behavior of the birds and disturbance distance were recorded. Buffer establishment and heronry protection measures are recommended for conservation of the source population. The breeding phenology data could be used as baseline as indicator tool for climate change impact...|$|R
25|$|Yala {{is one of}} the 70 Important Bird Areas (IBAs) in Sri Lanka. Of 215 {{bird species}} of the park, seven are endemic to Sri Lanka. They are Sri Lanka grey hornbill, Sri Lanka junglefowl, Sri Lanka wood pigeon, crimson-fronted barbet, black-capped bulbul, blue-tailed {{bee-eater}} and brown-capped babbler. The number of waterbirds inhabiting wetlands of Yala is 90 and half of them are migrants. Waterfowl (lesser whistling duck, garganey), cormorants (little cormorant, Indian cormorant), large waterbirds (grey <b>heron,</b> <b>black-headed</b> ibis, Eurasian spoonbill, Asian openbill, painted stork), medium-sized waders Tringa spp., and small waders Charadrius spp. are among the most common waterbirds. Black-necked stork and lesser adjutant are many of the rare birds that {{can be seen in the}} park. The migrant great white pelican and resident spot-billed pelican are also have been recorded. Other waterbirds attracted to the Yala lagoons include lesser flamingo, pelicans, and rare species such as purple heron, night herons, egrets, purple swamphen, and Oriental darter. Thousands of waterfowls migrate to the lagoons of Yala during the northeast monsoon. They are northern pintail, white-winged tern, Eurasian curlew, whimbrel, godwits, and ruddy turnstone. The visiting species mingled with residing lesser whistling duck, yellow-wattled lapwing, red-wattled lapwing, and great stone-curlew. Rock pigeon, barred buttonquail, Indian peafowl, black stork, black-winged stilt, and greater flamingo are among the other bird species. Crested serpent eagle and white-bellied sea eagle are the raptors of the park. The forest birds are orange-breasted green pigeon, hornbills, Old World flycatchers, Indian paradise flycatcher, Asian barbets, and orioles.|$|R
50|$|The <b>black-headed</b> <b>heron</b> {{is a large}} bird, {{standing}} 85 cm tall, {{and it has a}} 150 cm wingspan. It {{is nearly}} as large as the grey heron, which it resembles in appearance, although it is generally darker. Its plumage is largely grey above, and paler grey below. It has a powerful dusky bill.|$|E
50|$|Predators {{include the}} leopard, serval, cats, the <b>black-headed</b> <b>heron,</b> dark {{chanting}} goshawk, African hawk-eagle and Wahlberg's eagle.

50|$|The Tanji Bird Reserve has had around 300 {{species of}} birds {{recorded}} within it, including 82 species of Palearctic migrants. The reserve has been declared as an Important Bird Area by Birdlife International. Species seen regularly on the reserve's lagoons include <b>Black-headed</b> <b>heron,</b> white-fronted plover, Caspian tern, spur-winged plover, sanderling, Western reef heron, royal tern and lesser black-backed gull. While the Bijol Islands are an important feeding and roosting area for substantial numbers of shorebirds, seabirds, ospreys, and other birds, including Gambia's only breeding seabirds, including colonies of grey-headed gulls, slender-billed gulls, royal terns, Caspian terns, long-tailed cormorants and Western reef herons.|$|E
50|$|The diet {{consists}} of insects including Coleoptera which {{were found in}} 100% of stomach contents sampled, as were Orthoptera while Isoptera, Diplopoda, Hymenoptera and spiders were also recorded. Some vegetation was also recorded but this is assumed to have been swallowed accidentally when capturing animal prey. The aggregation of breeding frogs attracts several bird predators and these have included yellow-billed kite Milvus aegyptius, marabou stork Leptoptilos crumeniferus, saddle-billed stork Ephippiorhynchus senegalensis, intermediate egret Mesophoyx intermedia, grey heron Ardea cinerea and <b>black-headed</b> <b>heron</b> Ardea melanocephala. Some edible bullfrogs were seen to lunge at water birds that got too close, possibly these were males aggressively defending their territories. After spawning the males guard the tadpoles and may dig channels for them if their natal pool is drying out too quickly.|$|E

50|$|Verreaux's eagle-owl takes {{a diverse}} range of birds as prey. More than 50 avian prey species have been {{identified}} and they may locally exceed mammals in importance in the diet, somewhat unusually for eagle-owls. No one type of bird {{can be said to}} be predictably favored as prey and any avian species unfortunate enough to have a nighttime roost or nest that happens to be in an eagle-owl's foraging path may fall victim to this species. Many cases of predation involve nest robbery, with nestlings or fledglings being taken, although adult birds may be taken just as often, especially for species with less conspicuous nests. In South Africa's De Hoop Nature Reserve, it was found that birds were somewhat better represented by both number, 43.3% of remains, and biomass, 57.84% of remains, than mammals or any other prey group. The species best represented in biomass in the prior study was the <b>black-headed</b> <b>heron</b> (Ardea melanocephala) with several adults estimated to average 1260 g being found among the prey remains. Other fairly common, largish herons are also known to fall prey at night to Verreaux's eagle-owl including the 873 g great egret (Ardea alba), the 1443 g grey heron (Ardea cinerea) and the 975 g purple heron (Ardea purpurea). Other medium-sized water birds known to have been represented in this species diet include the 1008 g yellow-billed duck (Anas undulata), the 983 g African black duck (Anas sparsa), the 596 g African swamphen (Porphyrio madagascariensis) and the 825 g red-knobbed coot (Fulica cristata). Besides herons, another well-represented group of birds in the diet are galliforms. Perhaps the most widely prey species reported from this group is the 1229 g helmeted guineafowl (Numida meleagris), which may seasonally dominate the eagle-owl's food in Kenya. More modestly sized wild galliform species reported in the diet including the 96 g common quail (Coturnix coturnix) and the 390 g grey-winged francolin (Francolinus africanus). Domestic fowl, especially those allowed back to a semi-feral state and thus sleeping in the open as is prevalent in Africa, are taken when encountered, including chickens and peafowls.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of the survey was to compare habitats and bird life in the Asir region, particularly Jebal Souda and the Raydah escarpment protected area of the Saudi Wildlife Commission, and adjacent regions of the tihama, with those observed in July 1987 (Jennings, et al., 1988). The two surveys were approximately the same length and equal amounts of time were spent in the highlands and on the tihama. A number of walked censuses were carried out during 2010 on Jebal Souda, using the same methodology as walked censuses in 1987, {{and the results are}} compared. Broadly speaking the comparison of censuses revealed that in 2010 there were less birds and reduced diversity on the Jebal Souda plateau, compared to 1987. However in the Raydah reserve the estimates of breeding bird populations compiled in the mid 1990 s was little changed as far as could be assessed in 2010. The highland region of south-west Saudi Arabia, especially Jebal Souda, has been much developed since the 1987 survey and is now an important internal recreation and resort area. This has lead to a reduction in the region’s importance for terraced agriculture. These changes may be a contributing factor to changes in bird numbers on the plateau. Subsidiary tasks that arose during the 2010 survey were to help locate satellite tagged Bald Ibises Geronticus eremita from Syria which were transiting Saudi Arabia at the time. Secondly to search for the Asir subspecies of the Eurasian Magpie Pica pica asirensis, which is endemic to the south-west Saudi Arabia highlands, and is reported to be in decline. A separate team searching for the Bald Ibis located some individuals and one was found dead. Few Magpies were located and it seems clear that this very scarce bird has declined further in numbers in recent years. A number of interesting records of birds were obtained, especially on the tihama, where two new birds for Saudi Arabia were observed, <b>Black-headed</b> <b>Heron</b> Ardea melanocephala and Painted Snipe Rostratula benghalensis and one species, Glossy Ibis Plegadis falcinellus was found breeding {{for the first time in}} the Arabian Peninsula. Some recommendations for the protection and management of the Raydah reserve are presented. A systematic list of all birds seen is provided...|$|E
