5|$|Although {{both were}} invited, neither Hirst nor Rhodes toured Australia {{in the winter}} of 1901–02 with Archie MacLaren's team, as the Yorkshire {{committee}} wanted both players to <b>be</b> <b>well</b> rested before the new season. Hirst was statistically less successful in 1902, but he nevertheless returned to the Test team. The summer was very wet, resulting in many rain-affected pitches, known as sticky wickets, which favoured slower bowlers and made batting difficult. Hirst scored 1,413 runs in the season, at an average of 31.11 with two centuries. He took fewer wickets than the previous year, partly as he was often used for a few overs early in an innings by Yorkshire before giving way to slow bowlers Rhodes and Schofield Haigh, who topped the national first-class bowling averages for the season. In total, Hirst took 83 wickets at an average of 20.33.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of his death, his {{reputation}} and fame were waning, and his passing was little noticed within the artistic community. His artwork had certainly been acknowledged during his lifetime, but not widely. While the close study of landscape and an emphasis on the spiritual elements of nature were commonplace in contemporary art, his work was too original and personal to <b>be</b> <b>well</b> understood. By 1838, his work no longer sold or received attention from critics; the Romantic movement had been moving away from the early idealism that the artist had helped found.|$|E

5|$|During the 11th century, {{political}} rivalries divided {{members of}} the court due to the ministers' differing approaches, opinions, and policies regarding the handling of the Song's complex society and thriving economy. The idealist Chancellor, Fan Zhongyan (989–1052), was the first to receive a heated political backlash when he attempted to institute the Qingli Reforms, which included measures such as improving the recruitment system of officials, increasing the salaries for minor officials, and establishing sponsorship programs to allow a wider range of people to <b>be</b> <b>well</b> educated and eligible for state service.|$|E

Over the next two centuries the condition of the castle fluctuated. Around 1390 the castle roof was stripped for its lead, to be used on castles in Cornwall. The castle well was possibly dug during the 15th century. After 1425, the Crown let it to a range of individuals, including Sir Walter Hungerford and Sir Philip Courteney.|$|E

5|$|Epilepsy cannot {{usually be}} cured, but {{medication}} can control seizures effectively in about 70% of cases. Of those with generalized seizures, more than 80% can <b>be</b> <b>well</b> controlled with medications {{while this is}} true in only 50% of people with focal seizures. One predictor of long-term outcome {{is the number of}} seizures that occur in the first six months. Other factors increasing the risk of a poor outcome include little response to the initial treatment, generalized seizures, a family history of epilepsy, psychiatric problems, and waves on the EEG representing generalized epileptiform activity. In the developing world, 75% of people are either untreated or not appropriately treated. In Africa, 90% do not get treatment. This is partly related to appropriate medications not being available or being too expensive.|$|E
5|$|Fears of an Ottoman attack {{rose again}} {{after the fall of}} Candia in 1669, and the {{following}} year Grand Master Nicolas Cotoner invited the military engineer Antonio Maurizio Valperga to improve the fortifications. At the time the Floriana Lines were still under construction, and a number of weak points had been identified in their original design, especially since the demi-bastions forming the two extremities of the land front were too acute and could not <b>be</b> <b>well</b> defended. Valperga attempted to correct these flaws by making a number of alterations to San Salvatore Bastion on the western end of the lines, and constructing a faussebraye around the entire land front and a crowned hornwork near the eastern end. In the 1680s some minor modifications were made by the Flemish engineer Carlos de Grunenbergh.|$|E
5|$|First-run Lassie was {{televised}} September 12, 1954 to March 24, 1973 {{with its}} first 17 seasons airing on CBS Sundays at 7:00p.m. EST. In 1971, {{in order to}} promote community-related programming among local affiliates, the Federal Communications Commission moved primetime Sundays to 8:00 P.M. EST with the institution of the Prime Time Access Rule. CBS executives felt Lassie would not <b>be</b> <b>well</b> received in a time slot other than its traditional 7:00p.m. slot, and, with the network's other family programs set, the show was canceled. (Lassie was among several shows that CBS canceled during this time period as part of a change in its target demographics.) Lassie then entered first-run syndication with Jack Wrather and Campbell's Soup still on board, and remained on the air for another two years with its final episode airing in March 1973. All totaled, 591 episodes were produced.|$|E
