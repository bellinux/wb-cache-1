American paleontologist Storrs Olson suggested [...] in 1973 that it was related to the [...] "Rallus assemblage", which included the genera Rallus and Hypotaenidia (now lumped with Gallirallus), based on the structure of the skeleton.

Olson suggested the pro-Rallus rails have a relict distribution and would have been present in Africa and South America, from where the ancestors of the Inaccessible Island rail came from. The most recent study to include the genus, in 1998, compared the morphology of the rails and other Gruiformes and placed it in the crake clade, subtribe Crecina. Its exact position was uncertain but it appears to be basal within that clade, and perhaps the sister taxon to the genus Laterallus, a genus of small crakes found mostly in South America.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Natural nocardial {{infection}} {{has been}} reported in many different species including mammals and fish, but reports in birds remain uncommon. Eight juvenile <b>Black</b> <b>Crakes</b> (Limnocorax flavirostra) died unex-pectedly at the Basle Zoo. Necropsy revealed disseminated white, firm nodules, 1 â€“ 3 mm in diameter, throughout the lung parenchyma. Histologically, the lungs contained multiple, often confluent granulomas with central necrosis. Delicate, gram-positive, 0. 5 - to 1. 0 -m-wide, branching, occasionally beaded, filamentous organisms were visible in necrotic centers. These organisms were acid fast when stained with Fite-Faraco. No histologic lesions were seen in other organs. Nocardia nova was isolated from liver, spleen, kidney, and lung. Granulo-matous and necrotizing nocardial pneumonia with agonal septicemia was diagnosed, suggesting an aerogenous infection. To our knowledge, this is the first reported epizootic outbreak of nocardiosis in birds, which is additionally unusual because it was caused by N. nova. Key words: Avian nocardiosis; Black Crakes; granulomatous pneumonia; lungs; Nocardia nova. Natural nocardial infection {{has been reported}} in many dif-ferent mammalian species including monkeys and humans, as well as in fishes and birds. 14, 18 However, reports in birds remain uncommon. 3, 5, 9, 11, 15, 16 Avian nocardiosis caused by Nocardia asteroides {{has been reported in}} parrots, birds of prey, and passeriforms. 3, 7 Lesions were mainly localized in the lung and airsacs, 3, 9, 11, 14, 16 and only few reports describe lesions in other organs. 5, 14 To our knowledge, this is the first description of an epizootic outbreak of nocardiosis in birds. From September 1996 to February 1997, eight juvenile <b>Black</b> <b>Crakes</b> (Limnocorax flavirostra) from a group of 12 individuals died unexpectedly at the Basle Zoo (Zoologisch...|$|R

50|$|The <b>black</b> <b>crake</b> (Amaurornis flavirostra) is a waterbird in {{the rail}} and crake family, Rallidae. It breeds in most of sub-Saharan Africa except in very arid areas. It {{undertakes}} some seasonal movements in those parts of its range which are subject to drought. No subspecies have been described.|$|E
50|$|The <b>black</b> <b>crake</b> is diurnal, {{and this}} confiding bird will feed close to humans and {{often in the}} open. It eats {{a wide range of}} invertebrates, small fish, frogs and seeds. It will take the eggs of birds and {{scavenge}} on carcasses. It will forage on the ground or climb reeds to find prey including flying insects.|$|E
50|$|The {{habitat of}} this common to {{abundant}} species is freshwater marshes of all types, {{as long as}} there is some vegetation to provide cover. Many rails are very secretive, but the <b>black</b> <b>crake</b> is often seen out in the open. It has benefited from human activity in the form of deforestation, and is rarely hunted because of its unpalatable flesh.|$|E
50|$|The adult <b>black</b> <b>crake</b> is 19 - 23 cm {{long with}} a short tail and long toes. As its name implies, the adult has mainly black plumage, with a brown olive tone on the wings and upperparts which is rarely {{detectable}} in the field. The eye is red, the bill is yellow (hence the flavirostra of the binomial name), and the legs and feet are red, duller when not breeding.|$|E
