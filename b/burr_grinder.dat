25|$|Coffee may be brewed by {{steeping}} in {{a device}} {{such as a}} French press (also known as a cafetière, coffee press or coffee plunger). Ground coffee and hot water are combined in a cylindrical vessel and left to brew for a few minutes. A circular filter which fits tightly in the cylinder fixed to a plunger is then pushed {{down from the top}} to force the grounds to the bottom. The filter retains the grounds at the bottom as the coffee is poured from the container. Because the coffee grounds are in direct contact with the water, all the coffee oils remain in the liquid, making it a stronger beverage. This method of brewing leaves more sediment than in coffee made by an automatic coffee machine. Supporters of the French press method point out that the sediment issue can be minimized by using the right type of grinder: they claim that a rotary blade grinder cuts the coffee bean into a wide range of sizes, including a fine coffee dust that remains as sludge {{at the bottom of the}} cup, while a <b>burr</b> <b>grinder</b> uniformly grinds the beans into consistently-sized grinds, allowing the coffee to settle uniformly and be trapped by the press. Within the first minute of brewing 95% of the caffeine is released from the coffee bean.|$|E
2500|$|Poppy seeds can {{be ground}} using a generic tool {{such as a}} mortar and pestle or a small {{domestic}} type electric blade grinder, or a special purpose poppy seed grinder. [...] A poppy seed grinder (mill) is a type of <b>burr</b> <b>grinder</b> with a set aperture that is too narrow for intact poppy seeds to pass through. [...] A <b>burr</b> <b>grinder</b> produces a more uniform and less oily paste than these other tools.|$|E
50|$|Special purpose coffee {{grinders}} {{usually are}} either blade <b>grinders</b> or <b>burr</b> grinders: blade <b>grinders</b> being {{less expensive and}} having additional uses, <b>burr</b> <b>grinders</b> giving {{a better quality of}} grind (see Coffee preparation#Grinding). Special purpose spice grinders usually are either blade grinders or mortar and pestle (or related tools).|$|R
50|$|<b>Burr</b> <b>grinders</b> are of two types-conical burrs {{and flat}} wheel burrs. Both of them grind coffee bean {{consistently}} and with uniform size. Almost every <b>burr</b> coffee <b>grinder</b> grinds at low noise, offer large hopper for storing whole coffee bean, {{easy to use}} with portafilter for espresso grind, body made with stainless steel or ceramic with modern design as well as slow operating system ensures find grind all the time.|$|R

50|$|Electric <b>burr</b> <b>grinders</b> are {{powered by}} {{electricity}} from a battery or mains supply. An electric motor drives the grinding elements against each other. Electric grinders grind faster than manual grinders with no effort, butfriction and waste {{heat from the}} motor may heat the ground product slightly.|$|R
50|$|Manual <b>burr</b> <b>grinders</b> {{are turned}} by hand, {{rotating}} one grinding surface against the other. Coffee mills {{usually have a}} handle, providing leverage for the many turns required to grind enough coffee for a cup. The ground coffee is collected in a container {{which is part of}} the mill.|$|R
50|$|These mills offer a {{wide range}} of grind settings, making them {{suitable}} to grind coffee for various brewing systems such as espresso, drip, percolators, French press, and others. Many <b>burr</b> <b>grinders,</b> including almost all domestic versions, are unable to achieve the extremely fine grind required for the preparation of Turkish coffee; traditional Turkish hand grinders are an exception.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Burr</b> <b>grinders</b> obtain these lower speeds {{through two}} mechanisms. The lower cost models {{generally}} {{use a small}} electric motor to drive a series of reduction gears, while better constructed and more costly examples use a larger commercial motor and a belt, with no gear reduction to spin the burrs. The latter example is termed [...] "direct drive". The reduction gear versions are noisier and usually {{do not have the}} lifespan of the direct drive units.|$|R
50|$|Coffee beans can be chopped {{by using}} blades {{rotating}} {{at high speed}} (20,000 to 30,000 rpm), either in a blade grinder designed specifically for coffee and spices, or in a general use home blender. Devices of this sort are cheaper than <b>burr</b> <b>grinders,</b> but the grind is not uniform and will produce particles of widely varying sizes, while ideally all particles {{should have the same}} size, appropriate for the method of brewing. Moreover, the particles get smaller and smaller during the grinding process, which makes it difficult to achieve a consistent grind from batch to batch. The ground coffee is also warmed by friction, although it is debatable whether this heating effect has any detectable effect on the flavor of the coffee.|$|R

50|$|A burr mill, or <b>burr</b> <b>grinder,</b> is a mill used {{to grind}} hard, small food {{products}} between two revolving abrasive surfaces {{separated by a}} distance usually set by the user. When the two surfaces are set far apart, the resulting ground material is coarser. When the two surfaces are set closer together, the resulting ground material is finer and smaller. Often, the device includes a revolving screw that pushes the food through. It may be powered electrically or manually.|$|E
50|$|Salt, pepper, {{and spice}} mills, {{essentially}} the same as coffee mills, usually do not have a handle, the entire top rotating instead. While this is less convenient, only a few turns are required to grind enough. The ground product falls directly onto the food being seasoned; the mill has no container. A few designs have abrasive surfaces which do not rotate; each squeeze of the handles moves one flat plate past another, then the plates are restored to their original position by a spring. Many hard spices are available in containers incorporating a simple cone <b>burr</b> <b>grinder,</b> intended to be discarded when empty.|$|E
5000|$|Electrical powered <b>burr</b> <b>grinders</b> are {{available}} in many variations. Some grinders are [...] "stepped" [...] meaning that they are fixed by the factory into a set series of adjustments while [...] "stepless" [...] varieties use a worm drive or other mechanisms to offer {{an infinite number of}} adjustments within their grind range. Other variations include grinders that are equipped with dosers and others that are [...] "doserless". Dosers function as a catch bin to collect the ground coffee and by using a lever, users are able to dose a set amount of coffee. Doserless versions remove the bin and dosing function, and the grinder outputs the ground coffee directly into an espresso machine portafilter or into another container. The doserless examples normally feature additional functions such as weight based or advance time based grinding in order for a barista to grind for an exact amount of grounds required for a specific espresso shot.|$|R
2500|$|The most {{essential}} robot peripheral {{is the end}} effector, or end-of-arm-tooling (EOT). Common examples of end effectors include welding devices (such as MIG-welding guns, spot-welders, etc.), spray guns and also grinding and deburring devices (such as pneumatic disk or belt <b>grinders,</b> <b>burrs,</b> etc.), and grippers (devices that can grasp an object, usually electromechanical or pneumatic). Another common means of picking up an object is by vacuum. End effectors are frequently highly complex, made to match the handled product and often capable of picking up an array of products at one time. [...] They may utilize various sensors to aid the robot system in locating, handling, and positioning products.|$|R
40|$|To help contend rising wheat costs Central American bakers {{are looking}} for {{alternative}} ways to produce their baked products at a low cost without sacrificing nutritional value or taste. Sorghum flour {{is the answer to}} their problems. Sorghum flour is about half the cost of wheat flour so using sorghum flour helps bakers save money and make more of a profit. Particle size of sorghum flour must be sufficiently fine in order to substitute for wheat flour in baking recipes. However, small grinders adequate for family level bakers have not been available in Central America. That is until a collaborative project involving the NGO Compatible Technology International (CTI) of Minneapolis, MN, USA, INTSORMIL and CENTA (Centro Nacional de Tecnología Agropecuaria y Forestal) El Salvador introduced the CTI grinders into El Salvador. The CTI <b>grinders</b> are hand-cranked <b>burr</b> mills, or <b>grinders,</b> which produce flour from various grains. The two grinder models, Omega VI and Ewing were designed specifically for families in developing countries to process crops for consumption in the home and to sell in local markets. Sturdy and easy to use, CTI’s grinders are built to withstand challenging environments. Unlike other burr mills on the market, they come equipped with heat treated burrs that withstand wear. Both models can grind various grains such as sorghum...|$|R
5000|$|In 1818, Alex Skinner {{built the}} first mill along the Black Fork River in Loudonville. The mill flourished, and in 1861 it was {{acquired}} by Augustus Taylor, who expanded the business and doubled production capacity. Taylor hired a man named Jacob Stitzel, who discovered a way to produce a high grade of flour. His [...] "patent flour" [...] was made using a <b>burr</b> <b>grinder,</b> a process that remained a mystery to many other millers until the introduction of roller mills revolutionized the industry. In 1876, Stitzel oversaw a display of patent flour at the Philadelphia Centennial. Eventually, his flour became the national standard, {{and it continues to}} be the main form of flour used in the United States.|$|E
50|$|The uniform {{particle}} size achieved using a <b>burr</b> <b>grinder</b> can be desirable for coffee preparation. However, some methods of brewing {{may be more}} tolerant {{of the range of}} {{particle size}}s produced by a blade grinder; this may be the case for percolated coffee. Regardless, burr coffee grinders are more suited for keeping the flavor and aroma of the coffee beans intact. This is because burr mills produce less heat from friction compared to blade grinders; this is especially important for coffee aficionados looking to get the most flavor from the freshly ground beans, as heat from friction lessens or taints the natural flavor. Burr grinders create less friction and require lower motor speeds, which reduces potential flavor loss due to heat.|$|E
