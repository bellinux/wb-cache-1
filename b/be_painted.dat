5|$|At an Ashfield Council {{meeting on}} 28 May 2013 the council passed a motion that a {{permanent}} {{outline of a}} rainbow <b>be</b> <b>painted</b> in Summer Hill Square, {{with the understanding that}} this may be periodically 'chalked in' by children, families and community members.|$|E
5|$|Cannon {{recovered}} from the sea are often extensively damaged from exposure to salt water; because of this, electrolytic reduction treatment is required to forestall the process of corrosion. The cannon is then washed in deionized water to remove the electrolyte, and is treated in tannic acid, which prevents further rust and gives the metal a bluish-black colour. After this process, cannons on display may be protected from oxygen and moisture by a wax sealant. A coat of polyurethane may also <b>be</b> <b>painted</b> over the wax sealant, to prevent the wax-coated cannon from attracting dust in outdoor displays.|$|E
5|$|In many {{recreational}} diving {{settings where}} air and nitrox are the widely used gases, nitrox cylinders are {{identified with a}} green stripe on yellow background. Aluminium diving cylinders may <b>be</b> <b>painted</b> or anodized and when anodized may be coloured or left in their natural silver. Steel diving cylinders are usually painted, to reduce corrosion, often yellow or white to increase visibility. In some industrial cylinder identification colour tables, yellow shoulders means chlorine and more generally within Europe it refers to cylinders with toxic and/or corrosive contents; but this is of no significance in scuba since gas fittings would not be compatible.|$|E
25|$|Two Class 31 diesels <b>were</b> <b>painted</b> {{in trial}} liveries. No.D5578 <b>was</b> <b>painted</b> in an unlined 'Light Electric blue', and No.D5579 <b>was</b> <b>painted</b> in a colour {{variously}} described as 'Bronze Gold' and 'Golden Ochre'.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} contains classrooms, art studios, {{faculty and}} administrative offices, an art gallery, computer labs, print and wood shops {{and a small}} 100 person theater. For most of its life it <b>was</b> <b>painted</b> brown, but in early 2005 the administrative offices <b>were</b> <b>painted</b> yellow, the college proper <b>was</b> <b>painted</b> green and the Old Little Theatre <b>was</b> <b>painted</b> red.|$|R
50|$|In the 1966-67 offseason, {{during the}} period in which Rice owned the stadium, the {{concrete}} exterior <b>was</b> <b>painted</b> white, and the interior <b>was</b> <b>painted</b> blue. The metal frieze circling the upper deck <b>was</b> <b>painted</b> white.|$|R
5|$|Stainless steel {{provided}} {{many benefits}} over traditional wood and hardened steel for railroad carbodies; {{it was a}} lighter and stronger material, and its natural silver appearance and resistance to corrosion meant {{that it would not}} have to <b>be</b> <b>painted</b> to protect it from the weather. Since the carbody was much lighter than similar cars, it would be able to carry a higher revenue load for the same cost.|$|E
5|$|During {{and after}} World War II, the Yehudi lights project {{developed}} counter-illumination camouflage using lamps {{to increase the}} brightness of the aircraft to match {{the brightness of the}} sky. This was abandoned with improvements in radar, which seemed to render visible light camouflage redundant. However, aircraft continue to <b>be</b> <b>painted</b> in camouflage schemes; recent experiments have again explored active camouflage systems which allow colors, patterns and brightness to be changed to match the background, and some air forces have painted their fighters in digital camouflage patterns. Stealth technology, as in the Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk, aims to minimize an aircraft's radar cross-section and infrared signature, effectively providing multi-spectral camouflage at the price of reduced flying performance. Stealth may extend to avoiding or preventing vapor contrails.|$|E
5|$|In the Age of Sail, {{deception}} {{was often}} used by ships, and paint was applied ad hoc by ships' captains for temporary tactical advantage. A ship might <b>be</b> <b>painted</b> {{to look like}} another, it might have its cannon ports hidden by painted canvas to look harmless, or it might have additional cannon ports painted on to appear more powerful. For example, {{in one of his}} battles during 1778–1782, American privateer Jonathan Haraden hid the guns of his ship the General Pickering, to appear {{as if it were a}} slow merchant ship. Haraden allowed his ship to be approached at close range by a much faster British privateer, then he quickly pulled the painted canvas away and delivered a full broadside, capturing the enemy.|$|E
50|$|Most Polish RWD-13 <b>were</b> <b>painted</b> red, with {{a silver}} {{lightning}} painted on a fuselage and silver wings. RWD-13S <b>were</b> <b>painted</b> in ivory, with Red Cross markings, while RWD-13TS <b>were</b> <b>painted</b> in ivory, with a red lightning on the fuselage.|$|R

25|$|The NFL logo <b>was</b> <b>painted</b> at midfield for {{the first}} time since Super Bowl XXX, and the Super Bowl XXXVIII logo was placed on the 25-yard lines. From Super Bowls XXXI through XXXVII, the Super Bowl logo <b>was</b> <b>painted</b> at midfield, and the helmets of the teams painted at the 30-yard lines. From Super Bowl VI through Super Bowl XXX, the NFL logo <b>was</b> <b>painted</b> on the 50-yard line, except for Super Bowls XXV and XXIX. The Super Bowl XXV logo <b>was</b> <b>painted</b> at midfield and the NFL logo <b>was</b> <b>painted</b> at each 35-yard line. In Super Bowl XXIX, the NFL 75th Anniversary logo <b>was</b> <b>painted</b> at midfield with the Super Bowl logo at each 30-yard line.|$|R
5|$|Lutyens' {{designs were}} {{complete}} by 1920 and approved in November of that year, {{but as the}} chosen site {{was part of the}} churchyard, and several graves would have to be relocated to accommodate the memorial, the war memorial committee had to seek a faculty from the Diocese of Peterborough (the diocese in whose jurisdiction Northampton falls), which delayed the installation. The Reverend Geoffrey Warden, vicar of All Saints' Church, submitted the application in 1922, supported by two church wardens and two parishioners. Construction work commenced only in 1926, six years after the completion of the designs. By July 1926, the Northampton Independent reported that the obelisks had been carved and were waiting for the flags to <b>be</b> <b>painted</b> before they could be erected.|$|E
5|$|Military {{ambulances}} {{have historically}} included vehicles based on civilian designs {{and at times}} also included armored, but unarmed, vehicles ambulances based upon armoured personnel carriers (APCs). In the Second World War vehicles such as the Hanomag Sd Kfz 251 halftrack were pressed into service as ad hoc ambulances, and in more recent times purpose built AFVs such as the U.S. M1133 Medical Evacuation Vehicle serve the exclusive purpose of armored medical vehicles. Civilian based designs may <b>be</b> <b>painted</b> in appropriate colours, depending on the operational requirements (i.e. camouflage for field use, white for United Nations peacekeeping, etc.). For example, the British Royal Army Medical Corps has a fleet of white ambulances, based on production trucks. Military helicopters have also served both as ad hoc and purpose-built air ambulances, since they are extremely useful for MEDEVAC.|$|E
5|$|The Garden Lobby of Althorp also {{contains}} a number of pieces of porcelain from reputable European manufacturers, but also several rare Oriental pieces. Of note in the Garden Lobby aside from its many plates is a Sèvres tobacco jar with double strap handles, believed to <b>be</b> <b>painted</b> by Louis Jean Thévenet in 1765, two Chelsea vases decorated with putti which metaphorically represent the four seasons, which the Red Earl had bought {{as a gift for}} his wife Charlotte, an extremely finely carved Meissen flower bowl with hundreds of tiny gilded blooms which dates to around 1745, a Meissen card box, and a blue and gold cherubic Meissen chocolate set-for-one which was believed to have been made for Marie Antoinette in 1781 as a present celebrating the birth of her son Dauphin.|$|E

5|$|When Phantoms {{were first}} {{delivered}} to interceptor squadrons, they {{remained in the}} grey-green camouflage colour scheme more associated with the strike and close air support missions they had undertaken. During the late 1970s, the RAF began experimenting with new colours for its air defence units, with 56 Squadron tasked with trialling proposed new schemes. In October 1978, a Phantom FGR.2 of 56 Squadron became the first to <b>be</b> <b>painted</b> in the new air superiority grey colour, combined with small, low visibility roundels and markings. However, although the roundel remained in low visibility colours, individual squadron markings eventually returned to more observable sizes and colours.|$|E
5|$|Whilst {{the last}} members were signing it Doctor. Franklin looking towards the Presidents Chair, {{at the back}} of which a rising sun {{happened}} to <b>be</b> <b>painted,</b> observed to a few members near him, that Painters had found it difficult to distinguish in their art a rising from a setting sun. I have said he, often and often {{in the course of the}} Session, and the vicissitudes of my hopes and fears as to its issue, looked at that behind the President without being able to tell whether it was rising or setting: But now at length I have the happiness to know that it is a rising and not a setting Sun.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1951, Maple Leafs owner Conn Smythe watched special {{television}} feeds of games {{in an attempt to}} determine whether it would be a suitable medium for broadcasting hockey games. Television already had its detractors within the NHL, especially in Campbell. In 1952, even though only 10% of Canadians owned a television set, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) began televising games. On November 1, 1952, Hockey Night in Canada was first broadcast on television, with Foster Hewitt calling the action between the Leafs and Bruins at Maple Leaf Gardens. The broadcasts quickly became the highest-rated show on Canadian television. Campbell feared televised hockey would cause people to stop attending games in person, but Smythe felt the opposite. CBS first broadcast hockey games in the United States in the 1956–57 season as an experiment. Amazed with the initial popularity of the broadcasts, it inaugurated a 21-game package of games the following year. The NHL itself adapted to be viewer-friendly. In 1949, the league mandated that the ice surface <b>be</b> <b>painted</b> white to make the puck easier to see. On January 18, 1958, Willie O'Ree joined the Bruins as an injury call-up for a game in Montreal. In doing so he became the first black player in the NHL.|$|E

50|$|The class have <b>been</b> <b>painted</b> in {{a variety}} of {{different}} liveries during their careers, reflecting their mixed-traffic role. For the initial trials nos. 337 and 338 <b>were</b> <b>painted</b> in red oxide, and after acceptance they <b>were</b> <b>painted</b> in dove grey, lined with black and white for the official photographs (see above). Thereafter members of the class <b>were</b> <b>painted</b> plain black by the LB&SCR. Under Southern Railway ownership three examples <b>were</b> <b>painted</b> in lined umber, and others in passenger green and lined black. During the Second World War they <b>were</b> either <b>painted</b> in unlined dark green or black. Under British Railways the usual livery was lined black.|$|R
5|$|Lindow Man and LindowIII {{were found}} to have {{elevated}} levels of copper on their skin. The cause for this was uncertain as there could have been natural causes, although a study by Pyatt et al. proposed that the bodies may have been painted with a copper-based pigment. To test this, skin samples were taken from places likely to <b>be</b> <b>painted</b> and tested against samples from areas where painting was unlikely. It was found that the copper content of the skin of the torso was higher than the control areas, suggesting that the theory of Pyatt et al. may have been correct. However, the conclusion was ambiguous as the overall content was above that expected of a male, and variations across the body may have been due to environmental factors. Similarly, green deposits were found in the hair, originally thought to be a copper-based pigment used for decoration, but it was later found {{to be the result of}} a reaction between the keratin in the hair and the acid of the peat bog.|$|E
5|$|Love, sex {{and desire}} become {{important}} elements of the plot in Sant Singh Sekhon's Punjabi play Kalakar (1945), which places the epic drama in the modern age. It depicts Ahalya as a free-spirited woman, who dares to <b>be</b> <b>painted</b> nude by Inder (Indra), a pupil of the art professor, Gautama, and defends her decision against her husband's criticisms. N. S. Madhavan's Malayalam story (April 2006) also retells Ahalya's tale in a modern setting, wherein Ahalya, accused of adultery, is beaten by her husband, leaving her in a coma from which the neurologist, Rama, revives her. The 2015 film Ahalya gives a feminist twist to the tale where the policeman Indra turns into a stone doll, after visiting Ahalya. The tale was also parodied in the Telugu film Attarintiki Daredi. However, the practice of retelling the classical Ahalya–Indra tale in a contemporary setting is not new. The Yoga Vasistha (1001–1400) narrates {{a tale of two}} adulterous lovers, Queen Ahalya and the Brahmin Indra. Here, Ahalya and Indra fall in love and continue their affair, despite being punished by Ahalya's jealous husband. After death, they reunite in their next birth.|$|E

25|$|Painting The Rock has its {{own rules}} of etiquette. The Rock can only <b>be</b> <b>painted</b> between sunset and sunrise. Any group {{currently}} next to The Rock is guarding it, and it cannot be taken by another group at that time (although the occasional fight {{has happened in the}} past). The Rock can <b>be</b> <b>painted</b> several times in one night; however, it is a gentlemanly tradition among the fraternities not to paint over a sorority Rock for at least two to three days.|$|E
25|$|In February the Pacific Fleet, {{deciding}} {{that the primary}} threat to its ships was now kamikaze, directed that all ships be repainted in Measure 12, 21 or 22, and dazzle schemes began to disappear again. All auxiliaries and odd-numbered cruiser divisions, destroyer squadrons and destroyer-escort divisions were to <b>be</b> <b>painted</b> in Measure 21, and all even-numbered CA/CL divisions, DD squadrons and DE divisions in Measure 22. Ironically, the Atlantic Fleet {{did not get the}} memo, and during 1945 ships scheduled for Pacific transfer were repainted in dazzle, only to <b>be</b> <b>painted</b> again in Measure 21 or 22 on arrival at the West Coast or Hawaii.|$|E
