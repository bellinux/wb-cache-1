They discovered that the Flexner bacillus could go into intermission and be undetectable for periods of four to five weeks, making it very difficult to say when someone was no longer a carrier. They also found that men who were carriers of Shiga's bacillus would be prone to depression and would be no longer fit to be soldiers.|$|E

5|$|Four locals had <b>been</b> <b>identified</b> <b>by</b> the {{committee}} as witnessing Cornfoot being killed and {{being involved in}} her mistreatment although the three main perpetrators, who had by then left the area, were an Orcadian, a man from Burntisland and a Sea captain's son. A schoolboy, two Englishmen and another person were also implicated but had absconded. The committee determined that Bailie Cook, whose residence the mob had seized Cornfoot from, should carry {{a significant amount of}} the blame. Four males suspected of being present at the murder were held in custody but were released by Cowper in defiance of the Privy Council's instruction for them to be taken to Edinburgh for trial.|$|E
5|$|In the 19th and 20th centuries, some taxonomists {{inspected}} serval {{skins and}} identified two {{species on the}} basis of coat pattern: Felis serval (serval), with large, pronounced spots, and F. servalina or F. ornata (servaline cat), marked by freckle-sized dots. F. servalina was first described in 1839 by Irish naturalist William Ogilby from Sierra Leone; in 1867, British zoologist John Edward Gray described F. herschelii from an Indian skin, which was probably the same as the servaline cat. In 1907, British zoologist Reginald Innes Pocock commented that the two forms should be considered independent species, but reverted from this in 1917. Eventually, the two forms came to be recognised as the same species. Another form, F. himalayanus (Himalayan serval), was described from a skin procured from the Himalayan region; however, Scottish naturalist William Jardine noted in The Naturalist's Library (1843) that no such specimen had <b>been</b> <b>identified</b> <b>by</b> him or his colleagues, and that it differed considerably from the common serval. In 1944, Pocock identified three races of the serval from northern Africa.|$|E
5|$|Momolo {{returned}} to Bologna in late September 1858 after his two brothers-in-law wrote {{to him that}} if he stayed in Rome any longer the family might be ruined. He left Scazzocchio to represent the family's cause in Rome. Momolo shifted his priority to attempting to undermine Morisi's credibility, either by disproving aspects of her story or by showing her to be untrustworthy. He also resolved to confront Cesare Lepori, the grocer who Morisi said had both suggested the baptism and shown her how to perform it. Based on Morisi's story, Lepori had already <b>been</b> <b>identified</b> <b>by</b> many observers as being ultimately to blame for the affair. When Momolo visited his shop in early October, Lepori vehemently denied that he had ever spoken to Morisi about Edgardo or any baptism, and said that he was prepared to testify to this effect before any legal authority. He claimed that he did not himself know how to administer baptism, so had such a conversation occurred it could hardly have gone as Morisi described.|$|E

5000|$|The Lake Abert sites {{represent}} {{at least}} 11,000 years of human occupation. [...] Archeologists have divided the occupation timeline into six periods. The oldest is the Initial Archaic period from 11,000 to 7,000 years ago. This period <b>is</b> <b>identified</b> <b>by</b> the Great Basin stemmed projectile points {{found at the}} Initial Archaic sites. The second period is the Early Archaic which stretched from 7,000 to 4,000 years ago. This period <b>is</b> <b>identified</b> <b>by</b> the northern side-notched points found at Early Archaic locations. The Middle Archaic period covers 4,000 to 2,000 years ago and {{is divided into two}} sub-periods. The earlier sub-period <b>is</b> <b>identified</b> <b>by</b> the Gatecliff split-stem points found at its sites, and the more recent sub-period <b>is</b> <b>identified</b> <b>by</b> its Elko series points. The Late Archaic period, which lasted from 2,000 years ago until the mid-18th century, also has two sub-periods. The earlier sub-period <b>is</b> <b>identified</b> <b>by</b> a mix of Elko and Rosegate series points found at its locations, and the last period has only Rosegate points.|$|R
5|$|Specimens {{that have}} <b>been</b> <b>identified</b> <b>by</b> {{morphology}} as Beringian wolves (C.lupus) and radiocarbon dated 25,800–14,300 YBP {{have been found}} in the Natural Trap Cave {{at the base of the}} Bighorn Mountains in Wyoming, in the western United States. The location is directly south of what would at that time have been a division between the Laurentide Ice Sheet and the Cordilleran Ice Sheet. A temporary channel between the glaciers may have existed that allowed these large, Alaskan direct competitors of the dire wolf, which were also adapted for preying on megafauna, to come south of the ice sheets. Dire wolves were absent north of 42°Nlatitude in the Late Pleistocene; therefore, this region would have been available for Beringian wolves to expand south along the glacier line. How widely they were then distributed is not known. These also became extinct at the end of the Late Pleistocene, as did the dire wolf.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Nebi Samuel has officially <b>been</b> <b>identified</b> <b>by</b> the British as {{beginning}} on 17 November and finishing on 24 November 1917. But until 21 November infantry from the 75th Division was still continuing its advance towards Bireh. On that day, as the infantry division turned north east cutting {{across the front}} of the 52nd (Lowland) Division, their progress was blocked at Biddu by Ottoman forces entrenched on the height of Nebi Samuel, dominating Jerusalem and its defences. This hill, the traditional site of the tomb of the Prophet Samuel, was taken late in the evening by the 234th Brigade, 75th Division, after fierce fighting. The 52nd (Lowland) Division had taken the more difficult line, while the 75th Division was directed to the south western approaches. Several counterattacks by Ottoman forces during the following days failed. In close fighting, Ottoman soldiers strongly counterattacked, reaching the gates of the mosque before Gurkha infantry fought them off. Fevzi's Seventh Army had fought Allenby's two infantry divisions to a standstill.|$|E
5|$|The Preston By-pass, {{opened in}} 1958, {{was the first}} {{motorway}} in the UK, and today an extensive network connects the major cities of the North. The main western route through the North is the M6, part of a chain of motorways from London to Glasgow, while the main eastern motorway is the M1/A1(M), which runs {{as far north as}} Newcastle. The M62 links Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds and Hull across the Pennines. Other trans-Pennine roads are comparatively minor, and the lack of any dual-carriageway connection between the east and west coasts anywhere in England north of the M62 has <b>been</b> <b>identified</b> <b>by</b> the Department for Transport as a significant hindrance to the Northern economy. In many cases, modern roads still follow ancient routes: the M62 motorway effectively duplicates the Roman road between York and Chester, while the Great North Road, the stagecoach route from London to Scotland, became the modern A1 road.|$|E

About 90 bodies were identified by Canadian {{medical examiners}} using dental records. For around 30 bodies, examiners used fingerprints and ante mortem (before death) X-rays. The large number of ante mortem dental X-rays meant that around 90 bodies had <b>been</b> <b>identified</b> <b>by</b> the end of October. The RCMP contacted relatives of victims to ask for medical histories and dental records. Blood samples from relatives were used in the DNA identification of victims.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} ranks W21–1 {{along with}} N75–136 and S1–61 {{are all of}} horsemen and constitute 46% of the whole frieze. They are divided into two lines of ten ranks – the same number {{as that of the}} Attic tribes. All figures are beardless youths with the exception of two, W8 and W15, who along with S2–7 wear Thracian dress of fur cap, a patterned cloak, and high boots; these have <b>been</b> <b>identified</b> <b>by</b> Martin Robertson as hipparchs. Next are the four-horse chariots, each with charioteer and armed passenger, there are ten on the south frieze and eleven on the north. Since these passengers are sometimes depicted as dismounting they may be taken to represent the apobatai, participants in the ceremonial race found in Attica and Boeotia.|$|E
5|$|The {{remains of}} Beringian wolves {{have been found}} in Alaska and as far eastward as the Yukon in Canada. Specimens that have <b>been</b> <b>identified</b> <b>by</b> their skull {{morphology}} to be Beringian wolves {{have been found in}} the Natural Trap Cave {{at the base of the}} Bighorn Mountains in Wyoming, United States. These were radiocarbon dated to between 25,800 and 14,300YBP, and this location is directly south of what would at that time have been the division between the Laurentide Ice Sheet and the Cordilleran Ice Sheet. This suggests that a temporary channel existed between the glaciers from 25,800YBP until the advance of the ice sheets 16,000-13,000YBP. The migration of the Beringian wolf southwards is assumed to have been the result of pursuing prey species, as this cave also contained specimens of steppe bison that had migrated from Beringia and would have been prey for wolves, and muskox that is known to be an important prey species of the Beringian wolf. Dire wolves were absent north of 42°N latitude in the Late Pleistocene; therefore, this region would have been available for Beringian wolves to expand southwards. There is no evidence of expansion beyond this region.|$|E
