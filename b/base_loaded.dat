40|$|Nowadays {{diesel engines}} prevail as ship {{propulsion}}. However, steam propulsion is still primary drive for LNG carriers. In the presented paper high-pressure feed water heater was analyzed, {{as one of}} the essential components in LNG carrier steam propulsion system. Measurements of all operating parameters (fluid streams) at the analyzed heat exchanger inlets and outlets were performed. Change of the operating parameters was measured at different steam system loads, not at full load as usual. Through these measurements was enabled the insight into the behaviour of the heat exchanger operating parameters during the whole exploitation. The numerical analysis was performed, based on the measured data. The changes in energy and exergy efficiency of the heat exchanger were analyzed. Energetic and exergetic power inputs and outputs were also calculated, which enabled an insight into the change of energetic and exergetic power losses of the heat exchanger at different steam system loads. Change in energetic and exergetic power losses and operating parameters, which have the strongest influence on the high-pressure feed water heater losses, were described. Analyzed heat exchanger was compared with similar heat exchangers in the <b>base</b> <b>loaded</b> conventional steam power plants. From the conducted analysis, it is concluded that the adjustment and control modes of these high-pressure heat exchangers are equal, regardless of whether they were mounted in the <b>base</b> <b>loaded</b> conventional steam power plants or marine steam systems, while their operating parameters and behaviour patterns differ greatly...|$|E

40|$|The {{following}} {{conclusions are}} made {{based on this}} analysis effort: (1) High-temperature PEM data are not available; (2) Stack development effort for Phase II is required; (3) System results are by definition preliminary, mostly due to the immaturity of the high-temperature stack; other components of the system are relatively well defined; (4) The Grotthuss conduction mechanism yields the preferred system characteristics; the Grotthuss conduction mechanism is also much less technically mature than the vehicle mechanism; (5) Fuel processor technology is available today and can be procured for Phase II (steam or ATR); (6) The immaturity of high-temperature membrane technology requires that a robust system design be developed in Phase II {{that is capable of}} operating over a wide temperature and pressure range - (a) Unpressurized or Pressurized PEM (Grotthuss mechanism) at 140 C, Highest temperature most favorable, Lowest water requirement most favorable, Pressurized recommended for <b>base</b> <b>loaded</b> operation, Unpressurized may be preferred for load following; (b) Pressurized PEM (vehicle mechanism) at about 100 C, Pressure required for saturation, Fuel cell technology currently available, stack development required. The system analysis and screening evaluation resulted in the identification of the following components for the most promising system: (1) Steam reforming fuel processor; (2) Grotthuss mechanism fuel cell stack operating at 140 C; (3) Means to deliver system waste heat to a cogeneration unit; (4) Pressurized system utilizing a turbocompressor for a base-load power application.

40|$|We {{examine the}} effects of {{competition}} and decentralized ownership on resource scheduling. We show that centralized scheduling of multi-owned resources under imperfect information may face difficulties that do not arise when resources are centrally owned. We perform a simulation case study using a Lagrangian relaxation-based unit commitment algorithm modified to simulate proposed second-price pool auction procedures. This algorithm is based on the Hydro-Thermal Optimization (HTO) program used in short-term resource scheduling at PG&E. We demonstrate both the volatility of simulation outcomes for resources not <b>base</b> <b>loaded,</b> and the especially negative consequences of volatility for marginal resources (i. e., resources that frequently determine system marginal costs). Specifically, we show that variations in near optimal unit commitments that have negligible effect on total costs could have significant impact on the profitability of individual resources. These results raise serious question regarding the feasibility of proper mechanisms to oversee the efficiency and equity of a mandatory centrally dispatched pool. 1...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} this paper is to study dynamic-characteristics of asphalt-pavement on {{semi-rigid}} <b>base</b> <b>loaded</b> with moving, heavy-load. Based on transient-dynamics theory, three-dimensional finite-element (FE) model was developed for structural dynamic-responses analysis using ANSYS software. The heavy-duty axle-load model was established according to Belgium-Design Code, and the dynamic-load was simplified as sinusoidal-wave load. For the pavement mechanics indexes(road-surface deflection, the vertical and lateral stress, the shear stress and the strain), the time-history curves and distribution conditions in the structure were presented. Expect tensile-strain at surface-layer, the relationship between axle-load weight and mechanic-indexes are almost linearly proportional. The calculation shows that under moving heavy-load, the surface-layer suffers from rather high vertical compressive-stress and shear-stress, the base and subbase are loaded with high tensile-stress and the subgrade top undergoes large vertical-strain. For asphalt-pavement on semi-rigid loaded with moving, heavy-load, besides the conventional indexes (including road-surface deflection and tensile-stress at the bottom of base or subbase), the design indexes should also include the shear-stress on road surface, the vertical-strain on the top of subgrade and the vertical compressive-stress on road surface...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{the unit}} {{commitment}} and dispatch {{of a power}} system with and without a pumped storage unit is examined for increasing levels of installed wind power, from 17 % of total energy to 80 % of total energy generated by wind 3 (3 GW to 15 GW of installed wind on the Irish system in 2020). At high levels of installed wind, it is shown that storage reduces curtailment and increases the use the <b>base</b> <b>loaded</b> plant on the system. This reduces system costs. However, when the additional capital costs of storage are taken into account, it is shown that storage is not viable from a system perspective until extremely large levels of wind power are seen on the system. At these levels of installed wind, while the system can operate without storage, it is less costly to do so with storage. The capacity credit of the storage unit is also examined, using a simplified approach, and shown to decrease as larger amounts of intermittent wind power {{are added to the}} system...|$|E
40|$|Demand {{response}} {{has long been}} an integral part of power system control and operation. Recently, demand {{response has}} received more interest as a potentially effective tool to help gain higher levels of asset utilization on the bulk power grid and to avoid or delay the need for new transmission-line construction. Autonomous demand response is defined as load response to system-based signals rather than to master control signals or price signals from a central dispatch center. The most readily available systembased signal is frequency, which can be a very reliable indicator of grid instability, problems, or abnormal conditions. Speed governing systems at central generating stations, when operating in droop mode, employ frequency as the primary feedback signal. These governors are largely responsible for affecting primary frequency response of the bulk power grid thereby maintaining a continuous balance between supply and demand. This research examines the use of autonomous demand response to provide primary frequency response in an interconnected grid. Ultimately, it is conceivable that all primary frequency response might be delivered by responsive load leaving dispatchable generation to be <b>base</b> <b>loaded</b> or ramped with very slow ramp rates. If this objective were to be achieved, numerous benefits might be realized...|$|E
