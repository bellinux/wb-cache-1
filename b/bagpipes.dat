5|$|Although Collins {{used it as}} a {{catharsis}} for her {{opposition to}} the Vietnam War, two years after her rendition, the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards, senior Scottish regiment of the British Army, recorded an instrumental version featuring a bagpipe soloist accompanied by a pipe and drum band. The tempo of their arrangement was slowed to allow for the <b>bagpipes,</b> but it was based on Collins': it began with a bagpipe solo introduction similar to her lone voice, then it was accompanied by the band of <b>bagpipes</b> and horns, whereas in her version she is backed up by a chorus. It topped the RPM national singles chart in Canada for three weeks, and rose as high as number 11 in the U.S. It is also a controversial instrumental, as it combined pipes with a military band. The Pipe Major of the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards was summoned to Edinburgh Castle and chastised for demeaning the <b>bagpipes.</b> Funeral processions for killed police, fire, and military personnel have often played a <b>bagpipes</b> version ever since.|$|E
5|$|A {{second group}} of {{students}} headed for central London, waving effigies of the brown dog, joined by a police escort and, briefly, a busker with <b>bagpipes.</b> As the marchers reached Trafalgar Square, they were 1,000 strong, facing 400 police officers, 15 of them on horseback. The students gathered around Nelson's Column, where the ringleaders climbed onto its base to make speeches.|$|E
5|$|Field's musical {{influences}} include Lightning Hopkins, Elvis Presley, and the Rolling Stones. He plays several instruments, {{including the}} tin whistle, <b>bagpipes,</b> guitar, drums, trumpet, violin, percussion instruments and didgeridoo, {{and has been}} known to sing in a deep rich bass voice. Field, with input from the other members, produced most of the Wiggles' music, DVDs, and live shows.|$|E
50|$|Chieftain's Salute is a concerto in one {{movement}} for Great Highland <b>Bagpipe</b> and orchestra by Graham Waterhouse. The work {{is one of}} few to use the <b>bagpipe</b> with a classical orchestra. A version for <b>bagpipe</b> and string orchestra, Op. 34a, was composed in 2001. It {{is based on an}} earlier work for <b>bagpipe</b> and string quartet. Jacobean Salute was also derived from the early work, with a wind quintet replacing the <b>bagpipe,</b> published in 2003. A version for <b>bagpipe</b> and orchestra was composed and first performed in 2015.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>bagpipe</b> {{practice}} chanter is {{a double}} reed woodwind instrument whose main function is {{as an adjunct to}} the Great Highland <b>Bagpipe.</b> As its name implies, the practice chanter is used as a practice instrument, firstly for learning to finger the different melody notes of <b>bagpipe</b> music, and after the <b>bagpipe</b> is mastered to practice new music.|$|R
50|$|Guest musicians of {{the band}} vary but {{included}} in the past: Pavel Terziiski (vocal), Vlado Chivlidjanov (duduk, <b>bagpipe),</b> Kalin Yordanov (vocals, daf, bendir, darbouka) and Shtoni Kokudev (<b>bagpipe,</b> typan), Tsvetan Hadjiiski (vocals and <b>bagpipe,</b> from the Bulgarian band Smallman) among others.|$|R
5|$|Next, Tatanka {{defeated}} The Berzerker by pinfall. This {{match was}} originally scheduled {{as part of}} the pay-per-view. Due to time constraints it was cut from the PPV lineup in post-production. The match, however, later aired on WWF Prime Time Wrestling. On the Silver Vision home video release in the UK, this match was placed after the WWF World Heavyweight Championship match. Up next, Rowdy Roddy Piper joined the Balmoral Highlanders in playing Scotland the Brave on the <b>bagpipes.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Peasant Wedding (1567) and The Peasant Dance (1569) {{are also}} by Bruegel which {{share the same}} wedding theme and {{elements}} and were painted {{in the same period}} in Bruegel's later years. They are considered to be a trilogy of works by Bruegel. In all three of the paintings, there are pipers playing the pijpzak (<b>bagpipes),</b> they also exude pride and vanity, for example in The Peasant Dance the man seated next to the pijpzak player is wearing a peacock feather in his hat.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{attempts}} of the Kirk {{to limit the}} tradition of secular popular music, it continued. This period saw {{the adoption of the}} highland <b>bagpipes</b> and the fiddle. Ballads, some of which probably date from the Medieval period, existed as part of an distinctive oral tradition. Allan Ramsey advocated the creation of a national musical tradition and collaborated with Italian composer and cellist Lorenzo Bocchi on the first Scottish opera the Gentle Shepherd. A musical culture developed around Edinburgh and a number of composers began to produce collections of Lowland and Highland tunes grafted on to Italian musical forms. By the middle of the eighteenth century a number of Italian musicians and composers were resident in Scotland and Scottish composers of national significance had begun to emerge.|$|E
5000|$|... 5 Bn also {{maintains}} {{the tradition of}} having a <b>bagpipe</b> platoon. The tradition started when an officer of KOSB was seconded to 5 Bn Royal Malay in 1953. 5 Bn have just then formed a pipe platoon. The Scottish officer introduced the <b>bagpipe</b> and helped train the pipers, and the <b>bagpipe</b> platoon was formed. To this day, the <b>bagpipe</b> platoons of both battalions maintained their alliance. The <b>bagpipe</b> platoon has, in the past, been invited to attend the Edinburgh Festival. The last time 5 Bn attended the festival was in January 1990, celebrating the KOSB’s 300th anniversary.|$|R
5000|$|Great Irish Warpipes {{are similar}} to the Great Highland <b>bagpipe,</b> but have two drones instead of the Great Highland <b>bagpipe's</b> third.|$|R
50|$|The rakkopilli {{is a type}} of <b>bagpipe,</b> with no drone with a <b>bagpipe</b> made of a pig's bladder, {{from the}} Votic region.|$|R
5|$|Slavonia is a {{distinct}} region of Croatia in terms of ethnological factors in traditional music. It is a region where traditional culture is preserved through folklore festivals. Typical traditional music instruments belong to the tamburica and bagpipe family. The tamburica is the most representative musical instrument associated with Slavonia's traditional culture. It developed from music instruments brought by the Ottomans during their rule of Slavonia, becoming {{an integral part of}} the traditional music, its use surpassing or even replacing the use of <b>bagpipes</b> and gusle. A distinct form of traditional song, originating in Slavonia, the bećarac, is recognized as an intangible cultural heritage by UNESCO.|$|E
5|$|The first clear {{reference}} {{to the use of}} the Highland <b>bagpipes</b> is from a French history, which mentions their use at the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh in 1547. George Buchanan claimed that they had replaced the trumpet on the battlefield. This period saw the creation of the ceòl mór (the great music) of the bagpipe, which reflected its martial origins, with battle-tunes, marches, gatherings, salutes and laments. The Highlands in the early seventeenth century saw the development of piping families including the MacCrimmonds, MacArthurs, MacGregors and the Mackays of Gairloch. There is also evidence of adoption of the fiddle in the Highlands with Martin Martin noting in his A Description of the Western Isles of Scotland (1703) that he knew of eighteen players in Lewis alone.|$|E
5|$|The ninth century {{revealed}} the first <b>bagpipes,</b> which spread throughout Europe and had many uses from folk instruments to military instruments. The construction of pneumatic organs evolved in Europe starting in fifth-century Spain, spreading to England in about 700. The resulting instruments varied {{in size and}} use from portable organs worn around the neck to large pipe organs. Literary accounts of organs being played in English Benedictine abbeys {{toward the end of}} the tenth century are the first references to organs being connected to churches. Reed players of the Middle Ages were limited to oboes; no evidence of clarinets exists during this period.|$|E
50|$|The first adopter of the {{electronic}} <b>bagpipe</b> as a performance instrument was Hevia. Hevia’s CD “No Man’s Land” was released in 1998 and {{more than two million}} copies were sold worldwide. Since then {{the electronic}} <b>bagpipe</b> has established itself as a versatile tool in the new musical discourse of European <b>bagpipe</b> playing.|$|R
50|$|Because of the {{accompanying}} drone or drones, {{the lack of}} modulation in <b>bagpipe</b> melody, and stable timbre of the reed sound, in many <b>bagpipe</b> traditions the tones of the chanter are tuned using just intonation, although <b>bagpipe</b> tuning is highly variable across traditions. On the Great Highland <b>bagpipe,</b> tuning of the individual notes of the chanter is done using tape to slightly cover the finger holes as needed. Historically, it was done with wax, as was done with other woodwind instruments.|$|R
50|$|The Lancashire <b>bagpipe</b> or Lancashire greatpipe {{has been}} attested in literature, and {{commentators}} {{have noticed that}} the Lancashire <b>bagpipe</b> was also believed proof against witchcraft.|$|R
5|$|Evidence {{of musical}} {{instruments}} in use by early civilizations of India is almost completely lacking, {{making it impossible}} to reliably attribute instruments to the Munda and Dravidian language-speaking cultures that first settled the area. Rather, the history of musical instruments in the area begins with the Indus Valley Civilization that emerged around 3000 BC. Various rattles and whistles found among excavated artifacts are the only physical evidence of musical instruments. A clay statuette indicates the use of drums, and examination of the Indus script has also revealed representations of vertical arched harps identical in design to those depicted in Sumerian artifacts. This discovery is among many indications that the Indus Valley and Sumerian cultures maintained cultural contact. Subsequent developments in musical instruments in India occurred with the Rigveda, or hymns. These songs used various drums, shell trumpets, harps, and flutes. Other prominent instruments in use during the early centuries AD were the snake charmer's double clarinet, <b>bagpipes,</b> barrel drums, cross flutes, and short lutes. In all, India had no unique musical instruments until the Middle Ages.|$|E
5|$|In {{this era}} Scotland {{followed}} {{the trend of}} Renaissance courts for instrumental accompaniment and playing. James V, {{as well as being}} a major patron of sacred music, was a talented lute player and introduced French chansons and consorts of viols to his court, although almost nothing of this secular chamber music survives. The return of Mary, Queen of Scots from France in 1561 to begin her personal reign, and her position as a Catholic, gave a new lease of life to the choir of the Chapel Royal, but the destruction of Scottish church organs meant that instrumentation to accompany the mass had to employ bands of musicians with trumpets, drums, fifes, <b>bagpipes</b> and tabors. Like her father she played the lute, virginals and (unlike her father) was a fine singer. She brought French musical influences with her, employing lutenists and viol players in her household.|$|E
5|$|Just after midday, the 21st Panzer Division {{received}} {{permission to}} attack the landings. Luck ordered the 125th Panzergrenadier Regiment, east of the River Orne, towards the bridges. The column was quickly spotted, and engaged {{for the next two}} hours by Allied artillery and aircraft causing heavy losses. The 1st Battalion, 192nd Panzergrenadier Regiment and the 100th Panzer Regiment, attacking from west of the canal, had more success reaching the beaches between the British landing area of Sword and the Canadian Juno. At 13:30, the men at the bridges heard the sound of <b>bagpipes,</b> played by Bill Millin of the 1st Commando Brigade. As the commandos arrived, they crossed the bridges and joined the rest of 6th Airborne Division defending the eastern perimeter. Some of the tanks accompanying the commandos moved into Bénouville to reinforce its defences, while others crossed the bridges with the commandos. At 15:00, a boat loaded with German infantry approached from Caen. It was engaged with the anti-tank gun manned by number One Platoon, hit in the stern by the second round fired and then retreated back toward Caen.|$|E
50|$|Gudmund Nils Larsson (1892 - 1949 CE) was a Swedish <b>bagpipe</b> {{players from}} Dala-Järna, western Dalarna, {{and the last}} of the {{traditional}} Dalarna <b>bagpipe</b> players. Larsson was interviewed and studied in the 1930s by ethnologist Mats Rehnberg and music teacher Ture Gudmundsson, who compiled information on the <b>bagpipe</b> tradition, enabling its eventual revival later that century.|$|R
50|$|The Association Sonneurs de Veuzes ("Association of Veuze <b>bagpipe</b> Players") {{was formed}} in Nantes in 1976 for players of the veuze, a {{traditional}} <b>bagpipe</b> of Brittany and Nantes.|$|R
50|$|Only {{recently}} {{this type}} of <b>bagpipe</b> has been recovered through the gathering of repertoires, aided by {{the promotion of the}} instrument from several <b>bagpipe</b> associations from Portugal and Galicia.|$|R
5|$|Scottish {{music is}} a {{significant}} aspect of the nation's culture, with both traditional and modern influences. A famous traditional Scottish instrument is the Great Highland Bagpipe, a wind instrument consisting of three drones and a melody pipe (called the chanter), which are fed continuously by a reservoir of air in a bag. Bagpipe bands, featuring <b>bagpipes</b> and various types of drums, and showcasing Scottish music styles while creating new ones, have spread throughout the world. The clàrsach (harp), fiddle and accordion are also traditional Scottish instruments, the latter two heavily featured in Scottish country dance bands. There are many successful Scottish bands and individual artists in varying styles including Annie Lennox, Amy Macdonald, Runrig, Boards of Canada, Cocteau Twins, Deacon Blue, Franz Ferdinand, Susan Boyle, Emeli Sandé, Texas, The View, The Fratellis, Twin Atlantic and Biffy Clyro. Other Scottish musicians include Shirley Manson, Paolo Nutini and Calvin Harris.|$|E
5|$|Traditional {{folk music}} in Northern England is a {{combination}} of styles of England and Scotland – what is now called the Anglo-Scottish border ballad was once prevalent as far south as Lancashire. In the Middle Ages, much of Northern folk was accompanied by <b>bagpipes,</b> with styles including the Lancashire bagpipe, Yorkshire bagpipe and Northumbrian smallpipes. These disappeared {{in the early nineteenth century}} from the industrialising south of the region, but remain in the music of Northumbria. The British brass band tradition began in Northern England at around the same time: the dismissal of the Cheshire, Lancashire and Yorkshire military bands after the Napoleonic Wars, combined with the desire of industrial communities to better themselves, led to the founding of civilian bands. These bands provided entertainment at community events and led protest marches during the era of radical agitation. Although the style has since spread across much of Great Britain, brass bands remain a stereotype of the North, and the Whit Friday brass band contests draw hundreds of bands from across the UK and further afield.|$|E
5|$|The {{influences}} between Scotland and Donegal went {{both ways}} and were furthered {{by a wave}} of immigration from Donegal to Scotland in the 19th century (the regions share common names of dances), as {{can be heard in}} the volume of strathspeys, schottisches, marches, and Donegal's own strong piping tradition, has influenced and been influenced by music, and by the sounds, ornaments, and repertoire of the Píob Mhór, the traditional <b>bagpipes</b> of Ireland and Scotland. There are other differences between the Donegal style and the rest of Ireland. Instruments such as the tin whistle, flute, concertina and accordion were very rare in Donegal until modern times. Traditionally the píob mór and the fiddle were the only instruments used and the use of pipe or fiddle music was common in old wedding customs. Migrant workers carried their music to Scotland and also brought back a number of tunes of Scottish origin. The Donegal fiddlers may well have been the route by which Scottish tunes such as Lucy Campbell, Tarbolton Lodge (Tarbolton) and The Flagon (The Flogging Reel), that entered the Irish repertoire. These players prided themselves on their technical abilities, which included playing in higher positions (fairly uncommon among traditional Irish fiddlers), and sought out material which would demonstrate their skills.|$|E
50|$|The Army School of <b>Bagpipe</b> Music and Highland Drumming is a British Army {{training}} establishment that provides instructions of Scottish <b>bagpipe</b> music to military pipers, drummers and pipe bands.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1990s a {{multidisciplinary}} team composed of Alberto Arias, Miguel Dopico and José Ángel Hevia patented the first electronic <b>bagpipe</b> in history.

5|$|The {{return of}} James V's {{daughter}} Mary from France in 1561 to begin her personal reign, and her {{position as a}} Catholic, gave a new lease of life to the choir of the Scottish Chapel Royal, but the destruction of Scottish church organs meant that instrumentation to accompany the mass had to employ bands of musicians with trumpets, drums, fifes, <b>bagpipes</b> and tabors. Like her father she played the lute, virginals and (unlike her father) was a fine singer. She brought French musical influences with her, employing lutenists and viol players in her household. James VI was a major patron {{of the arts in}} general. He made statutory provision to reform and promote the teaching of music, attempting to revive burgh song schools from 1579. He rebuilt the Chapel Royal at Stirling in 1594 and the choir was used for state occasions like the baptism of his son Henry. He followed the tradition of employing lutenists for his private entertainment, as did other members of his family. When he went south to take the throne of England in 1603 as James I, he removed one of the major sources of patronage in Scotland. Beginning to fall into disrepair, the Scottish Chapel Royal was now used only for occasional state visits, leaving the court in Westminster as the only major source of royal musical patronage.|$|E

40|$|The <b>BAGPIPE</b> sub-critical {{experiment}} was executed on September 26, 1998, at about 13 : 07 hours. A steel and fibercrete containment barrier {{had been built}} {{at the entrance to}} the U 1 a. 101 b drift at the Nevada Test Site to form the <b>BAGPIPE</b> zero-room. The invert of the zero-room was covered with concrete and the ribs and back were covered with about 15 cm of fibercrete. The face was left uncovered to facilitate gas bleed-off into the alluvial formation. The volume of the room was approximately 3894 ft{sup 3 }. Four small experimental packages were detonated. The LLNL containment goal for the <b>BAGPIPE</b> {{experiment was}} to confine all special nuclear material (SNM) to the zero-room and the alluvium surrounding the zero-room. The experiment and containment objectives are discussed more fully in the <b>BAGPIPE</b> Containment Prospectus and the associated addendum. Alpha-particle radiation detectors outside the <b>BAGPIPE</b> zero-room remained at pre-shot background levels after the experiment. A large number of swipes were taken around the <b>BAGPIPE</b> primary containment barrier and in the diagnostics room. No evidence that any SNM was released into the tunnel complex was found and the <b>BAGPIPE</b> containment was considered successful...|$|R
