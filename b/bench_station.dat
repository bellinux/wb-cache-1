30|$|Introduction: There is a {{great need}} to {{evaluate}} manual laparoscopic skills in surgery. So far it is not feasible. In need for accreditation of endoscopic courses, we designed an easy to repeat <b>bench</b> <b>station</b> training consisting of four tasks and a standardized score sheet.|$|E
30|$|Objective: Assessing {{surgical}} {{skills is}} not feasible. Methods for skills assessment consist of log books, surgical or video observation {{with or without}} criteria in different valid and reliable proportions. The criteria based video assessment reaches almost valid and reliable proportions. To establish a skill assessment tool for course participants of the Giessen School of Endoscopic Surgery, {{we set up a}} <b>bench</b> <b>station</b> training and evaluated manual skills with defined criteria.|$|E
40|$|Abstract This chapter proposes three {{closed-loop}} control topologies based on model predictive control (MPC) for a small-scale pasteurization plant. The topolo-gies are designed {{taking into account}} the role of the predictive controller within the loop: (i) as supervisor control for the computation of the references for regulatory controllers, (ii) as unique controller within the closed loop, and (iii) acting simul-taneously as supervisor and regulatory controllers together with other regulatory controllers. All control designs have been applied in real time to a test <b>bench</b> <b>station</b> then experimental results are both presented and discussed. The main advantages and drawbacks for each topology are presented for the regulation of the tempera-ture of the output product while the energy consumption of the overall system is minimised. ...|$|E

40|$|The gear {{which is}} the central safety element of the {{friction}} drive lift during braking is exposed to overloading connected with changeable weight which loads the lift braking system. In the article the results of numerical analysis for braking process of CHP 2000 type progressive gear distinguished by an innovative design have been presented. The numerical analysis was conducted {{with the use of}} a simulation of the gear roller displacement depending on changeable loading with the support of Abaqus/CAE software. Displacement of the gear roller from the neutral position in which the gear starts loosing energy of speeding up weight to zero was simulated. The results obtained from computer simulations were verified on the basis of a physical experiment at the <b>bench</b> <b>station</b> created to verify braking parameters of the gears with the use of free fall method...|$|E

50|$|A <b>bench</b> {{from the}} <b>station,</b> bearing the station name, {{is on display}} at the National Railway Museum, York.|$|R
50|$|There {{is a basic}} {{waiting room}} and {{sheltered}} area on each platform with some <b>bench</b> seating. The <b>station</b> has cycle access but no wheelchair access.|$|R
50|$|The {{station is}} located on the Coryton Line 2.5 mi north of Cardiff Central. The High Level station {{is located on}} the Rhymney Line. The station has one {{platform}} with a wheelchair accessible entrance from a minor residential road. On the platform is a brick built waiting shelter and open aired <b>benches.</b> The <b>station</b> is unmanned.|$|R
50|$|Passenger comfort {{sometimes}} {{suffers from}} (homeless) beggars or pickpockets, especially in large cities. Measures taken to remedy this include installation of CCTV, locking waiting {{rooms in the}} evening, and sometimes removal of <b>benches</b> from <b>station</b> halls. Also, a valid train ticket is required to access platforms. Passengers with large luggage should note that no luggage trolleys are provided (except at the station of Schiphol airport), although platforms are accessible by elevator.|$|R
5000|$|From 1895 {{the parish}} priest was Fr Francis John Gillow and in 1895-6 {{a number of}} {{alterations}} were made by him to {{the interior of the}} church. The floor was lowered by about 2 ft and the steps at the west entrance were removed. At the same time Pugin's altar was moved to a side chapel and the rood screen was relocated to the west end of the church and altered to fit. [...] In 1906 Gillow installed a new main altar, a pulpit, <b>benches,</b> and <b>Stations</b> of the Cross.|$|R
50|$|The {{station was}} opened by the Cardiff Railway on 1 March 1911 as Coryton Halt; it was renamed Coryton Halt (Glam) by the Great Western Railway in 1926, and {{relocated}} in 1931. It was proposed for closure in the Beeching Report of 1963, but survived. The line beyond here closed to all traffic in 1952. The station was renamed Coryton on 5 May 1969. There is one platform {{with a single}} bus-stop style shelter and <b>benches.</b> The <b>station</b> has two entrances, one wheelchair accessible from Park Crescent and one {{down a flight of}} steps from the A4054 road bridge over the track.|$|R
5000|$|Since the {{construction}} of a series of offshore breakwaters known locally as [...] "the Five Sisters" [...] in the 1930s, a significant volume of sediment has accumulated behind the Five Sisters creating a large tombolo. These offshore breakwaters have also contributed to increased erosion on the southern portion of Winthrop Beach, leaving the seawall, Winthrop Shore Drive and adjacent residences vulnerable to storm damage. In addition to repairing degraded [...] "groin structures," [...] the project's final phase calls for widening sidewalks on Winthrop Shore Drive, and the addition of new lighting, <b>benches,</b> sand-rinsing <b>stations,</b> and upgraded beach entrances.|$|R

50|$|Stations include {{at least}} two ticket machines, {{wayfinding}} displays, electronic displays, and <b>bench</b> seating. Surface <b>stations</b> are designed with shade canopies. Many suburban stations also have free or reserved parking available and some have bike storage available. After many years lacking them, locking fare gates (turnstiles) have been phased in at all underground stations and many surface stations.|$|R
50|$|During the Network SouthEast era, {{the station}} was {{refurbished}} with the trademark red lighting poles, <b>station</b> <b>benches</b> and monitor screens for train arrivals. Rubble from the rebuilt Weymouth station was used {{to fill in the}} former Abbotsbury platform for use as a car park. This was done in time for the extension of electrification from Bournemouth to Weymouth in 1988.|$|R

50|$|Currently, {{the station}} is located on an open cut at Lincoln Avenue and Railroad Avenue on the main line. It has two side {{platforms}} and aqua green walls. There are two exits; the main exit {{at the south end}} leads to Lincoln Avenue and has brick a station house on street level. There are no <b>benches</b> inside the <b>station</b> house. The secondary exit at the middle of this station leads to Fremont Avenue on both sides and utilizes an overpass to connect both platforms.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{decoration of}} the Métro's underground train halls was austere. Stations featured plain white tiles, enamel plaques for the station name, a few wooden <b>benches</b> and the <b>station</b> manager's kiosk {{in the middle}} of the platform. Within a few years advertising billboards and confectionery machines appeared. The now-famous beveled white tiles (of Gien earthenware) were chosen for their effective reflection of ambient light. Start of the 20th century electric lighting had a strength of only 5 lux, making it impossible to read a book.|$|R
50|$|In {{the short}} westernmost portion, between Grand Army Plaza and Prospect Park (where it intersects with Prospect Park West, Flatbush Avenue, and Vanderbilt Avenue) and Washington Avenue, the {{thoroughfare}} {{consists of a}} broad, bidirectional avenue of six lanes, separated by a median from a narrow parallel side street on the north side. It passes Brooklyn Museum in this area. The section between Washington and Ralph Avenues has also a southern side street, separated by another median. Both medians have trees, <b>benches,</b> subway <b>station</b> entrance, and paths for pedestrians, and the southern one also has a bike path, part of the Brooklyn-Queens Greenway which runs south from the western end through Prospect Park to Ocean Parkway and east from the eastern end through Forest Park. The parkway passes Bedford, Rogers, and Nostrand Avenues in this fashion before passing Chabad-Lubavitch world headquarters and the Jewish Children's Museum in Crown Heights. It continues east, crossing Utica and Ralph Avenues.|$|R
50|$|For those {{interested}} in historical buildings, meticulous care has been taken by the Maywood Station Historical Committee to show the museum in a historical context. The museum features the original woodwork painted and stained in its original colors and original Maywood Station furnishings have been restored and displayed such as the potbelly stove, station agent's desk, chairs, telegraph keys and freight scale. Victorian-period original light fixtures and sconces adorn the ceilings and walls. Additional items have been painstakingly reproduced to the exact original specifications of over one-hundred years ago including the <b>station</b> <b>benches</b> and bay window area.|$|R
60|$|Late at night, {{the train}} arrived at Allahabad. Here {{there was a}} stop, till morning. The men alighted from the train; {{and lay down on}} their folded blankets, with their knapsacks for pillows, on the {{platform}} or in the waiting rooms. A plentiful supply of water had been prepared for their use, at the station; and outside were several water carriers; and many of the men stripped off their shirts, and had water poured over their heads and bodies. Will Gale was among these and, greatly refreshed, he enjoyed some fruit and cakes which he purchased from native vendors; and then, lying down on a <b>bench</b> in the <b>station,</b> was soon asleep.|$|R

50|$|Metro stations, {{more so than}} railway and bus stations, {{often have}} a {{characteristic}} artistic design that can identify each stop. Some have sculptures or frescoes. For example, London's Baker Street station is adorned with tiles depicting Sherlock Holmes. The tunnel for Paris' Concorde station is decorated with tiles spelling the Déclaration des Droits de l'Homme et du Citoyen. Every metro station in Valencia, Spain has a different sculpture on the ticket-hall level. Each of the original four stations on Line 8 of the Beijing Subway is decorated traditionally with elements of Chinese culture. Alameda station is decorated with fragments of white tile, like the dominant style of the Ciutat de les Arts i les Ciències. On the Tyne and Wear Metro, the station at Newcastle United's home ground St James' Park is decorated in the clubs famous black and white stripes. Each station of the Red Line and Purple Line subway in Los Angeles was built with different artwork and decorating schemes, such as murals, tile artwork and sculptural <b>benches.</b> Every <b>station</b> of the Mexico City Metro is prominently identified by a unique icon {{in addition to its}} name, because the city had high illiteracy rates at the time the system was designed.|$|R
50|$|In 2011/2012 a large {{development}} project took place following 5 years of fundraising and applying for various permissions. An extension {{was built on}} the rear of the building to provide the railway's first proper toilet facilities, disabled facilities and a store room fitted with a silent generator to provide power for the building. New paving was added to the patio area, ramped pathways to a new paved station platform area. The remaining area being landscaped with turf and planting of appropriate shrubs, and the replacement of the time-expired station nameboards, along with new signage, fencing and <b>station</b> <b>benches</b> and CCTV. Inside the building was developed further as a free visitor centre with displays and artefacts depicting the history of the line and its restoration. It partially reopened for Easter 2012, and fully reopened as a Visitor Centre in May 2012.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} St. Basil’s Church was small, {{more accurately}} described as “very lofty, very short and definitely unfinished”. At its consecration the Church was 100’ {{in length and}} 50’ in width, with stone foundation walls some 30” thick tapering to 13” above which were double brick walls with small buttresses topped by a gabled roof with dormers. The initial brick work was done in Flemish bond style, the later brick work in English bond style. The ceiling was of open timber construction, the great oak beams visibly supporting the roof. A small sanctuary was formed by a semi-circular apse extending out from the north wall. It contained an altar and several choir stalls enclosed by a semi-circular communion rail. Three glass windows behind the main altar and the two side altars were covered with some colored material, probably red bunting. There were two side aisles but no centre aisle. Seating was provided by rough wood <b>benches.</b> The <b>Stations</b> of the Cross were simple etchings. The church had a small manual organ, purchased for $800.00. At the rear (south) end of the nave a wooden partition extending from the side walls separated the nave from small vestibule area that contained two confessionals, {{one on each side}} wall. The entrance from the south façade consisted of a high wooden platform reached by two steep flights of stairs from both the east and west sides down to ground level. There was no choir loft or steeple.|$|R
50|$|In October 2014, MassPort {{announced}} {{the plans for}} East Boston's first dog park, giving residents a place to bring their dogs. Dedicated on September 14, 2015, the Bremen Street Dog Park {{is located at the}} southeast terminus of Bremen Street Park, underneath the Route 1A overpass near the Sumner Tunnel, where the neighborhoods of Jeffries Point and lower Eagle Hill intersect. The $250,000 half-acre dog park is divided into a 17,000-square-foot section for larger dogs and a 5,500-square-foot part for smaller ones, fenced off from each other. Each area has its own dog exercise centers including agility courses, pet waste <b>stations,</b> <b>benches,</b> separate water fountains for dogs and their owners, and benches. Pressley Associates Landscape Architects of Boston designed the park's dog play area with a surface of crushed gravel, replacing the site's original cobblestones. An asphalt track for dog owners to socialize, run around, or watch their dogs at play surrounds the graveled area. The remainder of Bremen Street Park does not allow dogs.|$|R
50|$|Prior to the City & County {{taking over}} the HRT in 1971, outdoor {{advertising}} was allowed on {{the exterior of the}} buses. However, since the transfer of ownership the advertising has been restricted to the interior of the fleet, even though there was never a restriction or ban on placing ads on the exterior of the buses, a move that the Outdoor Circle (a group that is opposed to outdoor advertising in Hawaii) actively supports. On December 4, 2013, Mayor Kirk Caldwell announced a plan to place ads {{on the outside of the}} buses again in an effort to generate money to help fund more revenue, restore routes that were cut, prevent fare increases, and improve the system's infrastructure. If the deal is approved by the City Council, outdoor advertising on TheBus would be restored, but only restricted to the buses because they are moving vehicles; since state law bans non-moving outdoor advertising, they will not be placed at bus stop locations, transfer <b>stations,</b> <b>benches,</b> or shelters.|$|R
5000|$|The Vodnik may {{be fitted}} {{with the same}} BPU-1 turret, {{designed}} in late 1970s, as the BTR-80 {{on the top of}} the vehicle towards the rear. The turret is fitted with the 14.5 mm KPV heavy machine gun and 7.62 mm PKT coaxial light machine gun. The main gun is not stabilized (neither in the BTR-80 nor the BTR-80A), so accurate fire on the move is limited (to low speeds), and the rotation mechanism is manually operated. In some cases, it is fitted with a BPPU turret with a 30-mm 2A72 and a PKT. The gunner sits in a roof mounted chair located above the flat floor behind the driver/commander and two passengers, and before the passenger <b>bench.</b> The gunner's <b>station</b> is basic, but uncharacteristically uncramped for a Soviet-designed armored vehicle. The gunner is equipped with daytime sight. There are six 902V [...] "Tucha" [...] 81 mm smoke grenade launchers mounted on the rear of the turret.|$|R
50|$|In 1984, the Soviets began {{production}} of a diesel-engined variant of the BTR-70, which they called the BTR-80. The Soviets have retrofitted some BTR-70s with several of the improvements incorporated into the BTR-80, including the high-angle-of-fire turret. The twin doors are designed to allow the infantry to disembark while the vehicle is in motion, and allow the infantry inside to exit from one side if the other is receiving fire. The 30mm Cannon variants are effective against most targets apart from main battle tanks, against which they can still cause significant damage to optics, weapons, and important systems. The main gun is not stabilized, so accurate fire on the move is limited to low speeds, and the turret's rotation mechanism is manually operated. The gunner sits in a roof-mounted chair located above the flat floor behind the driver/commander and two passengers, and before the passenger <b>bench.</b> The gunner's <b>station</b> is basic, but uncharacteristically spacious for a Soviet armored vehicle. The gunner is equipped with both a day time optical sight and an infrared night sight.|$|R
40|$|Objective: The Royal College of Surgeons’ (RCS) {{three days}} Basic Surgical Skills (BSS) course focuses on {{teaching}} surgical trainees safe techniques {{in a controlled}} workshop environment early in their career. The course was introduced in Norway in 2009 and is so far voluntary in the Norwegian surgical training program. Our objectives were to evaluate if the participants improved their surgical skills after completing the course. We also wanted to investigate whether the improvement was dependent on the participants’ previous surgical experience. Methods: Fifty-seven participants {{were included in the}} study. We used objective structured assessment of technical skills (OSATS) to assess the participants’ performance on two <b>bench</b> model <b>stations</b> from the BSS curriculum before and after completion of the course. In addition the participants were tested on a low-fidelity boxtrainer. For the laparoscopic test, time and numbers of hurdles passed were registered. All the participants completed a self-assessment form on surgical skills before and after the course. Results: Mean total score for all the participants on the OSATS were significantly improved after completing the course (p < 0, 001), without correlation to the participants’ previous length (p from 0, 166 to 0, 549) and type (p from 0, 150 to 0, 965) of surgical training. They also completed the laparoscopic test significantly faster after training (p < 0, 001) The results from the self-assessment forms showed that most participants felt more competent in the surgical skills trained and taught in the course. Conclusion: Our study indicates that the BSS course is beneficial for Norwegian surgical trainees with up to three years of training. Previous studies have shown that technical skills acquired on simulators are transferable to the operating theater (OR), and that skills courses improve performance in the OR compared to educational programs without practical skills training...|$|R
