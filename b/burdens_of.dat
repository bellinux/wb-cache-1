5|$|Muhammad Yunus was {{inspired}} during the Bangladesh famine of 1974 {{to make a}} small loan of US$27 to a group of 42 families as start-up money so that they could make items for sale, without the <b>burdens</b> <b>of</b> high interest under predatory lending. Yunus believed that making such loans available to a larger population could stimulate businesses and reduce the widespread rural poverty in Bangladesh.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the paper is to analyze, how rules <b>of</b> the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> proof and rules <b>of</b> the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> argumentation justify a thesis, which is found as a true {{statement}} by court. Two concepts of the truth discussed in the Polish civil procedure (the objective/material truth and the judicial truth) are compared {{in connection with the}} rules <b>of</b> the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> proof and the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> argumentation. The rules <b>of</b> <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> proof and the rules <b>of</b> the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> argumentation are constitutive rules. They state under what conditions a thesis counts as justified. The justification of a decision of applying law based on the rules <b>of</b> the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> proof or rules <b>of</b> the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> argumentation is institutional, not substantial...|$|R
2500|$|The term [...] "burden of proof" [...] {{is used to}} mean {{two kinds}} <b>of</b> burdens: The <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> {{production}} (or the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> [...] "going forward with the evidence") and the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> persuasion.|$|R
5|$|Chappell had {{a direct}} {{influence}} on Hughes' successor, Allan Border. Early in his captaincy tenure, Border was struggling with the <b>burdens</b> <b>of</b> the position so the ACB appointed Bob Simpson as team coach to assist. This led to animosity between Chappell and Simpson as Chappell derided {{the need for a}} coach. Simpson responded by writing that the peer influence of older players helping younger players fell away during the era when the Chappell brothers led the team, and he was redressing the problem.|$|E
5|$|Expanding on {{the dense}} {{production}} style of West's 2010 album My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, Watch the Throne incorporates orchestral and progressive rock influences, unconventional samples, and dramatic melodies in its sound. Jay-Z and West's braggadocio lyrics exhibit themes of opulence, fame, materialism, power, and the <b>burdens</b> <b>of</b> success, {{as well as}} political and socioeconomic context. The album expresses other topics such as Jay-Z's thoughts on fatherhood, West's reflection on being deemed a social villain, and their success as performers. Music writers interpreted the subject matter to concern the rappers' plight as African Americans struggling with financial success in America.|$|E
5|$|The ACLU {{continues}} to defend individuals who feel abused or improperly {{treated by the}} government. Often the American Civil Liberties Union is the group {{to stand up for}} an individual when being discriminated against because of their religion, sex, gender, sexuality, race, or class, even when they are not the popular opinion. The Reproductive Freedom Project, however, goes deeper than the ACLU. The Project promotes sexual and reproductive health by providing lessons about contraception, knowing about one's reproductive rights and assisting with the financial <b>burdens</b> <b>of</b> abortions and all of the logistics that may go into that.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} logical {{modelling}} of presumptions {{and their effects}} on the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> proof. Presumptions are modelled as default rules and their effect on the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> proof is {{defined in terms of}} a distinction between the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> production, the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> persuasion and the tactical <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> proof. These notions are logically characterised {{in such a way that}} presumptions enable a party to fulfil a <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> production or persuasion while shifting a tactical burden to the other party. Finally, it is shown how debates about what can be presumed can be modelled as debates about the backings of default rule...|$|R

5|$|The {{prevalence}} of Alzheimer's Disease in the United States {{is estimated at}} 5.1 million, and of these two thirds are women. Furthermore, women {{are far more likely}} to be the primary caregivers of adult family members with depression, so that they bear both the risks and <b>burdens</b> <b>of</b> this disease. The lifetime risk for a woman of developing Alzeimer's is twice that of men. Part of this difference may be due to life expectancy, but changing hormonal status over their lifetime may also play a par as may differences in gene expression. Deaths due to dementia are higher in women than men (4.5% of deaths vs. 2.0%).|$|E
5|$|Animals are {{susceptible}} {{to a number of}} diseases and conditions that may affect their health. Some, like classical swine fever and scrapie are specific to one type of stock, while others, like foot-and-mouth disease affect all cloven-hoofed animals. Where the condition is serious, governments impose regulations on import and export, on the movement of stock, quarantine restrictions and the reporting of suspected cases. Vaccines are available against certain diseases, and antibiotics are widely used where appropriate. At one time, antibiotics were routinely added to certain compound foodstuffs to promote growth, but this practice is now frowned on in many countries because of the risk that it may lead to antibiotic resistance. Animals living under intensive conditions are particularly prone to internal and external parasites; increasing numbers of sea lice are affecting farmed salmon in Scotland. Reducing the parasite <b>burdens</b> <b>of</b> livestock results in increased productivity and profitability.|$|E
5|$|Fish and {{shellfish}} {{have a natural}} tendency to concentrate mercury in their bodies, often {{in the form of}} methylmercury, a highly toxic organic compound of mercury. Species of fish that are high on the food chain, such as shark, swordfish, king mackerel, bluefin tuna, albacore tuna, and tilefish contain higher concentrations of mercury than others. As mercury and methylmercury are fat soluble, they primarily accumulate in the viscera, although they are also found throughout the muscle tissue. When this fish is consumed by a predator, the mercury level is accumulated. Since fish are less efficient at depurating than accumulating methylmercury, fish-tissue concentrations increase over time. Thus species that are high on the food chain amass body <b>burdens</b> <b>of</b> mercury that can be ten times higher than the species they consume. This process is called biomagnification. Mercury poisoning happened this way in Minamata, Japan, now called Minamata disease.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} allocation <b>of</b> <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> proof {{in environmental}} disputes in the WTO system. Besides laying down the natural principles that (i) the complainant carries the burden to (ii) make a {{prima facie case}} that its claim holds, WTO adjudicating bodies have said little of more general nature. The paper therefore examines the case law of relevance to environmental policies, to establish the rules concerning <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> proof {{that are likely to}} be applied in such disputes. Evaluating this case law, the paper makes two observations,: First, in cases submitted under the GATTWTO, adjudicating bodies have committed errors regarding the required amount <b>of</b> evidence (the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> persuasion); and second, such errors, as well as errors concerning the determination of the party to carry the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> providing this evidence (the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> production), have been committed in disputes submitted under the TBT/SPS Agreements. These errors largely seem attributable to the general absence of methodology regarding the interpretation of some key substantive provisions featuring in the three Agreements. <b>Burden</b> <b>of</b> Proof; <b>Burden</b> <b>of</b> Production; <b>Burden</b> <b>of</b> Persuasion; WTO; Environment...|$|R

5000|$|Instead, the {{defendant}} {{in a criminal}} case only has a <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> production on the issue of self-defense. This means that a defendant who wishes to invoke the doctrine only needs to [...] "generate the issue" [...] by introducing some evidence that he or she acted in self-defense. If {{the defendant}} satisfies that <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> production and thus generates the issue, then it is the prosecution that has the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> proving that the defendant did not act in self-defense. In other words, once the defendant satisfies his or her <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> production on the issue of self-defense, then the prosecution has the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> persuasion on the issue of self-defense.|$|R
5|$|Randall {{worked with}} Republicans {{to shift the}} source of federal funds from taxes to tariffs. He {{believed}} the taxation of alcohol spread the <b>burdens</b> <b>of</b> taxation unfairly, especially as concerned his constituents, who included several distillers. He also believed the income tax, first enacted during the Civil War, was being administered unfairly, with large refunds often accruing to powerful business interests. On this point, Randall was successful, and the House accepted an amendment that required all cases for refunds over $500 to be tried before a federal district court. He also worked toward the elimination of taxation on tea, coffee, cigars, and matches, all of which Randall believed fell disproportionately on the poor. Relief from taxation made these items cheaper for the average American, while increasing reliance on tariffs helped the industrial owners and workers in Randall's district, as it made foreign products more expensive.|$|E
5|$|Serving as Secretary of the Treasury in the {{administration}} of Rutherford B. Hayes, Sherman continued his efforts for financial stability and solvency, overseeing an end to wartime inflationary measures and a return to gold-backed money. He returned to the Senate after his term expired, serving there for a further sixteen years. During that time he continued his work on financial legislation, as well as writing and debating laws on immigration, business competition law, and the regulation of interstate commerce. Sherman was the principal author of the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, which was signed into law by President Benjamin Harrison. In 1897, President William McKinley appointed him Secretary of State. Failing health and declining faculties made him unable to handle the <b>burdens</b> <b>of</b> the job, and he retired in 1898 {{at the start of the}} Spanish–American War. Sherman died at his home in Washington, D.C. in 1900.|$|E
5|$|The Roman Empire {{reached its}} {{greatest}} territorial extent {{during the second}} century AD; the following two centuries witnessed the slow decline of Roman control over its outlying territories. Economic issues, including inflation, and external pressure on the frontiers combined to create the Crisis of the Third Century, with emperors coming to the throne only to be rapidly replaced by new usurpers. Military expenses increased steadily during the third century, mainly {{in response to the}} war with the Sasanian Empire, which revived {{in the middle of the}} third century. The army doubled in size, and cavalry and smaller units replaced the Roman legion as the main tactical unit. The need for revenue led to increased taxes and a decline in numbers of the curial, or landowning, class, and decreasing numbers of them willing to shoulder the <b>burdens</b> <b>of</b> holding office in their native towns. More bureaucrats were needed in the central administration to deal with the needs of the army, which led to complaints from civilians that there were more tax-collectors in the empire than tax-payers.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{problems}} {{pertaining to the}} allocation <b>of</b> the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> proof in mixed disputes in legal and non-legal contexts are addressed. First the traditional view on the allocation <b>of</b> the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> proof based on Whately’s legal conception of ‘presumption’ is discussed. Whately’s proposal is not adequate for the solution of problems related to the allocation <b>of</b> the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> proof in everyday mixed disputes {{where there is no}} presumption of status quo. Using the pragma-dialectical perspective it is explained how practical questions regarding the division <b>of</b> the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> proof are solved in a legal context. It is shown that for argumentation theory, the combination of material and procedural rules for the allocation <b>of</b> the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> proof offer an instrument for the allocation <b>of</b> the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> proof in both legal and non-legal discussions...|$|R
5|$|France voiced {{concerns}} over the artificially low price of gold in 1968 and called for returns to the former gold standard. Meanwhile, excess dollars flowed into international markets as the United States expanded its money supply to accommodate the costs of its military campaign in the Vietnam War. Its gold reserves were assaulted by speculative investors following its first current account deficit since the 19th century. In August 1971, President Richard Nixon suspended the exchange of U.S. dollars for gold {{as part of the}} Nixon Shock. The closure of the gold window effectively shifted the adjustment <b>burdens</b> <b>of</b> a devalued dollar to other nations. Speculative traders chased other currencies and began selling dollars in anticipation of these currencies being revalued against the dollar. These influxes of capital presented difficulties to foreign central banks, which then faced choosing among inflationary money supplies, largely ineffective capital controls, or floating exchange rates. Following these woes surrounding the U.S. dollar, the dollar price of gold was raised to $38 USD per ounce and the Bretton Woods system was modified to allow fluctuations within an augmented band of 2.25% as part of the Smithsonian Agreement signed by the G-10 members in December 1971. The agreement delayed the system's demise for a further two years. The system's erosion was expedited not only by the dollar devaluations that occurred, but also by the oil crises of the 1970s which emphasized the importance of international financial markets in petrodollar recycling and balance of payments financing. Once the world's reserve currency began to float, other nations began adopting floating exchange rate regimes.|$|E
5|$|Obama's {{inaugural address}} {{received}} mixed reviews, with some describing {{the tone of}} the speech a praiseworthy one of restraint and plain speaking, while others described the speech as low-brow and cliched. Despite his optimism, Obama was critical of former Presidents GeorgeW. Bush and BillClinton. David E. Sanger, chief Washington correspondent for The New York Times, described the speech as the harshest rebuke of an outgoing President during an inaugural address since Franklin Roosevelt's call for restoration of American values. The Bush administration was upset about {{the tone of the}} speech, saying that the speech veered from that of a ritualistic but respectful thanks to that of a public diatribe. Members of the Republican party viewed the speech as a missed chance to seek unity, while Rahm Emanuel, Obama's White House Chief of Staff, described the speech as a reflection of the mandate of the people. In an analysis of the inaugural address, one reporter described the speech as one that emphasized the <b>burdens</b> <b>of</b> the moment and the cloudy future whose challenges may be met with the resolve that is part of our American heritage.|$|E

The <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> proof in objective sense and the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> proof in material sense is a specific working method available to court after the evidence procedure is carried out, when the use of free assessment of evidence method did not result in its conviction that a certain disputed legally relevant fact is true, which disables the court to form the factual substratum of the judgment.

2500|$|The <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> proof (...) is {{the duty}} of a party in a trial to produce the {{evidence}} that will prove the claims they have made against the other party. In a legal dispute, one party is initially presumed to be correct and gets the benefit of the doubt, while the other side bears the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> proof. When a party bearing the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> proof meets their <b>burden,</b> the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> proof switches to the other side. <b>Burdens</b> may be <b>of</b> different kinds for each party, in different phases <b>of</b> litigation. The <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> production is a minimal burden to produce at least enough evidence for the trier of fact to consider a disputed claim. After litigants have met the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> production and their claim is being considered by a trier of fact, they have the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> persuasion, that enough evidence has been presented to persuade the trier of fact that their side is correct. There are different standards of persuasiveness ranging from a preponderance of the evidence, where there is just enough evidence to tip the balance, to proof beyond a reasonable doubt, as in United States criminal courts.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} formal, {{mathematical}} model of argument structure and evaluation, taking seriously the procedural and dialogical aspects of argumentation. The model applies proof standards {{to determine the}} acceptability of statements on an issue-by-issue basis. The model uses different types of premises (ordinary premises, assumptions and exceptions) and information about the dialectical status of statements (stated, questioned, accepted or rejected) to allow the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> proof to be allocated to the proponent or the respondent, as appropriate, for each premise separately. Our approach allows the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> proof for a premise to be assigned to a different party than {{the one who has}} the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> proving the conclusion of the argument, and also to change the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> proof or applicable proof standard as the dialogue progresses from stage to stage. Useful for modeling legal dialogues, the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> production and <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> persuasion can be handled separately, with a different responsible party and applicable proof standard for each. Carneades enables critical questions of argumentation schemes to be modeled as additional premises, using premise types to capture the varying effect on the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> proof of different kinds of questions.
