5|$|Planetary atmospheres are {{affected}} by the varying insolation or internal energy, leading to the formation of dynamic weather systems such as hurricanes, (on Earth), planet-wide dust storms (on Mars), a greater-than-Earth-sized anticyclone on Jupiter (called the Great Red Spot), and holes in the atmosphere (on Neptune). At least one extrasolar planet, HD 189733 b, has been claimed to have such a weather system, similar to the Great Red Spot <b>but</b> <b>twice</b> as large.|$|E
5|$|Statius {{mentions}} Orion {{four times}} in his Thebaïd; twice as the constellation, a personification of storm, <b>but</b> <b>twice</b> as the ancestor of Dryas of Tanagra, one of the defenders of Thebes. The very late Greek epic poet Nonnus mentions the oxhide story in brief, while listing the Hyrians in his Catalogue of the Boeotian army of Dionysius.|$|E
5|$|The flotilla's second {{success was}} the night of 19/20 December 1941, again in the North Sea off the Dutch coast, when two boats engaged two R boats and one E boat. They passed twice at high speed before losing contact, <b>but</b> <b>twice</b> during the night they located them and {{eventually}} carried out depth charge attacks. Both Hichens and {{the commander of the}} other boat received a MID for this action.|$|E

5|$|Former England captain Bryan Robson {{took over}} as new manager during the {{following}} season, but, under his management, City won only seven games from 28 and were relegated in 23rd place. Robson left {{and was replaced by}} his assistant Colin Todd. The club went into administration for a second time, but Todd led them to 11th in each of the following two seasons. Following fan pressure and a poor run of results, Rhodes sacked Todd on 12 February 2007, with City just three points above the relegation zone. Wetherall was appointed player-manager on a temporary basis and then {{for the rest of the}} season, but City were relegated following a 3–0 defeat to Chesterfield. During the summer of 2007, former midfielder Stuart McCall returned as manager with City in the bottom tier for the first time in 25years. He set himself a target of earning promotion back to League One in his first season, <b>but</b> <b>twice</b> missed out on promotion before he left the club in February 2010 with City lying 16th in League Two.|$|E
5|$|Pope Innocent III {{also began}} preaching {{what became the}} Fourth Crusade in 1200, {{primarily}} in France but also in England and Germany. After gathering in Venice, the Crusade was used by Doge Enrico Dandolo and Philip of Swabia to further their secular ambitions. Dandolo's aim was to expand Venice's power in the Eastern Mediterranean, and Philip intended to restore his exiled nephew, Alexios IV Angelos, along with Angelos's father, Isaac II Angelos, to the throne of Byzantium. This would require overthrowing the present ruler, Alexios III Angelos, the uncle of Alexios IV. When an insufficient number of knights arrived in Venice, the Crusaders were unable to pay the Venetians for a fleet, so they agreed to divert to Constantinople and share what could be looted as payment. As collateral, the Crusaders seized the Christian city of Zara; Innocent was appalled, and promptly excommunicated them. However, the French Crusaders eventually had their excommunications lifted. When the original purpose of the campaign was defeated by the assassination of AlexiosIV Angelos, they conquered Constantinople, not once <b>but</b> <b>twice.</b> Following upon their initial success, the Crusaders captured Constantinople again and this time sacked it, pillaging churches and killing many citizens. The Fourth Crusade never came within 1,000 miles of its objective of Jerusalem.|$|E
5|$|The normal peacetime British Army cavalry {{formation}} was the brigade, <b>but</b> <b>twice</b> a cavalry division {{had been}} formed. The {{first time was}} during the Anglo-Egyptian War in 1882. The second was during the Second Boer War (1899–1901) in South Africa, the last major conflict fought by the British Army before the First World War. During the fighting in South Africa, it was the 7,000-strong colonial mounted contingent, not the 5,000-strong regular cavalry, that {{led the way in}} tactical development. They were better trained, better armed, and more efficient, if only because they had been correctly trained to use the right weapons and tactics for the conflict. Since 1880 British cavalrymen had been armed with only carbines and swords, although some carried a lance; it was not until 1903 that the cavalry were issued rifles, the same ones used {{by the rest of the}} army. The regular cavalry regiments were considered so poor in quality that General Sir Redvers Henry Buller, commanding the advance into Northern Natal, left his six cavalry regiments behind at Ladysmith, trusting in the irregular mounted forces to carry out patrols in their stead.|$|E

5|$|Their {{first season}} in the Third Division was a {{successful}} one and they ended up in second place. Three years later, in 1924–25, they were champions and won promotion to the Football League Second Division. The 15th-place finish in 1926 remains Darlington's best League performance, but they were relegated back to the Third Division in 1927, where they remained until the Second World War {{put an end to}} competitive football. They came as high as third in 1929–30, <b>but</b> <b>twice</b> had to apply for re-election to the League, in 1932–33 and 1936–37, after finishing in last place in the section. In 1934, they enjoyed their first success in a nationally-organised cup competition, defeating Stockport County 4–3 at Old Trafford to win the Football League Third Division North Cup, and reached the final again two years later, this time losing 2–1 at home to Chester.|$|E

25|$|The Glastonbury Thorn in Glastonbury, England {{is a small}} Crataegus monogyna {{regarded}} as sacred by many Christians.

Of further religious significance and indeed scientific interest, the tree displays a rare phenomenon for its species, blooming not once <b>but</b> <b>twice</b> per year. The second bloom occurs around the holiday of Christmas.|$|E
25|$|Later that autumn, on 1 October 1969, Widgeon was {{decommissioned}} {{and placed}} in reserve; she got underway the next day for her new home port, San Diego.

25|$|During the {{majority}} of the year caribou roam the tundra in small herds, <b>but</b> <b>twice</b> a year large herds of caribou cross the inland regions. Caribou have excellent senses of smell and hearing so that the hunters must be very careful when in pursuit. Often, Inuit hunters set up camp miles away from the caribou crossing and wait until they are in full view to attack. There are many ways in which the caribou can be captured, including spearing, forcing caribou into the river, using blinders, scaring the caribou, and stalking the caribou. When spearing caribou, hunters put the string of the spear in their mouths and the other end they use to gently spear the animal.|$|E
25|$|The {{brothers}} then {{staged a}} silent coup. Byattaba consolidated {{power at the}} palace. E Bya Bon took over the defenses of Lagun Byi, a town north of Martaban while U-Lo took over Moulmein (Mawlamyaing), the town immediately south of Martaban, across the Salween (Thanlwin). In the delta, Laukpya had fortified Myaungmya. Only their half-brother Lagun, governor of a small eastern delta town of Let-Hlyit remained loyal to the king. The king did not learn about the coup until four months into the trip. He rushed back to the capital. His troops recaptured Lagun Byi from E Bya Bon <b>but</b> <b>twice</b> failed to take Martaban, losing his two best generals in the process. In the western theater, Laukpya tried to seize Dala–Twante but could not get past the defenses of his half-brother Lagun.|$|E
25|$|In Chicago some 50,000 {{turned out}} to cap 10 days of radical protests and police repression.

Despite the climate of fear, an estimated 50,000 turned out for the International Unemployment Day protest, marching through the streets 12 abreast for about four hours. The demonstration concluded with a large open air meeting at the Chicago stockyards, addressed by CPUSA district organizer Clarence Hathaway, TUUL organizer Nels Kjar, and representatives of the Young Communist League and black workers.|$|E

25|$|The accusations {{brought about}} the end of Robinson's career at the age of 25 as he was largely blacklisted by {{promoters}} on the European track circuit. In spite of this, he stood by the statements he had made in his interviews. His personal life grew increasingly difficult after his retirement. One of his children was beaten to death by the mother and when his daughter, by another woman, moved to Canada he was blocked from seeing her. An attempt to take his daughter back to the United States resulted in charges for assault and abduction, and he served five months in jail. He began seeing a psychiatrist in Tacoma, <b>but</b> <b>twice</b> attempted suicide in 1996. He married former US skier Lisl Hager in the late 1990s and retreated from public life, refusing to take calls from the press and asking to be left alone.|$|E
25|$|In the 1969–70 season, Osgood and Hutchinson scored 53 goals between them, {{helping the}} club finish {{third in the}} league and reach another FA Cup final. This time the opponents were Leeds United, reigning league champions and one of the {{dominant}} sides of the era. Chelsea were generally second best in the first match at Wembley played on a boggy pitch, <b>but</b> <b>twice</b> came from behind to gain a 2–2 draw, first through Houseman and then a late headed equaliser (four minutes from full-time) from Hutchinson. The replay was staged at Old Trafford a fortnight later and is as well known for the uncompromising tactics employed by both sides as the skill and talent on display. Chelsea again went behind but equalised {{for the third time in}} the match with a diving header from Osgood from a Cooke cross. As the game went into extra time, Chelsea took the lead for the first time when Webb headed in a Hutchinson throw-in to seal a 2–1 win.|$|E
25|$|Hanno the Great {{was given}} {{command of the}} Punic army, which was raised from Carthaginian {{citizens}} and mercenaries recruited from abroad, plus cavalry squadrons and 100 elephants. Hanno sailed to Utica {{in the spring of}} 241 BC, obtained siege equipment from the city and overran the rebel camp, the rebels fleeing before the charging Punic elephants. Hanno, accustomed to fighting Libyans and Numidians, did not anticipate any further trouble and left his army for Utica. However, the rebels regrouped, and observing lax discipline among the Punic troops, launched a surprise sortie and routed the Punic army while Hanno was absent, driving the survivors to Utica and capturing all the baggage. Hanno marshaled his soldiers, <b>but</b> <b>twice</b> failed to engage the rebels under favorable conditions and twice failed to surprise them on other occasions. The Carthaginian government then raised an army of 10,000 soldiers and 70 elephants and put Hamilcar Barca in command. Hanno posted his army near Hippo Acra, where Matho’s army was besieging the town.|$|E
