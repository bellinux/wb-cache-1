In April 1985, Michaels {{went to work}} for another NWA {{territory in}} Kansas City called Central States Wrestling. There, he and tag team partner Marty Jannetty defeated The Batten Twins for the NWA Central States Tag Team Championship, later losing it back to the <b>Battens.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{crucifix}} measures 448cm x 390cm and {{consists of}} five basic physical components; a vertical board reaching from the base to the cymatium onto which Christ is nailed, two horizontal cross-arms, and two vertical pieces acting as aprons adjacent to the central board. There are another eight minor pieces; mostly terminals, bases or framing devices. The structure is reinforced by two full length vertical <b>battens.</b> The horizontal cross-arms extend the full width of his outstretched body and are slotted into ridges in the vertical supports. The timber would have been cut and arranged by carpenters before Cimabue applied his design and paintwork.|$|E
5|$|The present bridge {{dates from}} 1842. The bridge was {{constructed}} with a Town lattice, patented by Ithiel Town who {{is said to}} have supervised the construction of the bridge. If accurate, Town would have supervised the construction of the current bridge in the years preceding his death. The bridge has vertical planking and the seams are covered by <b>battens</b> and the roof of the structure has wood shingles. A lot of the joinery has been preserved, though the queen-post trusses around the Town lattices are not original.|$|E
50|$|Billy <b>Batten</b> had two {{brothers}} {{who were also}} famous players and the <b>Batten</b> dynasty continued with his three sons who all played at the top level, with Eric appearing in a record eight Challenge Cup Finals. Batten's marriage to Annie (née Glover) (birth registered April→June 1889 in Hemsworth district) was registered during January→March 1909 in Wakefield district. They had children; William <b>Batten</b> (birth registered during July→September 1909 in Hemsworth district), Sydney M. <b>Batten</b> (birth registered during July→September 1911 in Hemsworth district), Mary <b>Batten</b> (birth registered during January→March 1913 in Hemsworth district), Frederick E. <b>Batten</b> (birth registered during July→September 1914 in Hemsworth district), Florence M. <b>Batten</b> (birth registered during July→September 1916 in Hemsworth district), Emily <b>Batten</b> (birth registered during April→June 1919 in Hemsworth district), Ann V. <b>Batten</b> (birth registered during July→September 1923 in Hemsworth district), and Robert <b>Batten</b> (birth registered during January→March 1927 in Hemsworth district).

5|$|The magazines, {{situated}} deep {{under the}} casemates, consist of alternating pairs of shell and cartridge rooms accessed via an ammunition passage {{at the front}} and a lighting passage behind. Great care was taken to reduce {{the possibility of an}} accidental explosion. The magazine workers wore special clothes and shoes to eliminate the risk of striking sparks and the floors of the cartridge stores were covered by wooden <b>battens.</b> The lighting was provided from oil lamps situated behind glass windows and accessed only from the lighting passage, which was physically separated {{from the rest of the}} magazine. Sets of lifting gear enabled the workers to winch the cartridges and ammunition up to the casemates, with which they could communicate via voice tubes.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} New Paltz station {{burned down}} around 4:45 A.M. on April23, 1907, damaging freight and killing station agent E. J. Snyder's dog. The fire {{originated in the}} office stove, and spread rapidly before local fire companies could arrive. A passenger car {{was used as a}} temporary station while the building was rebuilt. By late September 1907, the concrete foundation and the framework of the new building had been put in place, but work on the interior did not begin until November because the lumber had not arrived. The depot was completely rebuilt by December31, 1907, and in active use by February7, 1908. While the original station had a gabled roof, the rebuilt station was hipped. The direction of the new station's <b>battens</b> was horizontal; the original station had had vertical slats. The rebuilt freight house was placed a distance from the depot.|$|E
5|$|In 1869 {{the island}} was visited by a {{magistrate}} P. Cloete aboard the Thetis investigating a possible murder. He was accompanied by Charles Moore, director of the Botanic Gardens in Sydney, and his assistant William Carron who forwarded plant specimens to Ferdinand Mueller at the botanic gardens in Melbourne who, by 1875, had catalogued and published 195 species. Also on the ship was William Fitzgerald, a surveyor, and Mr Masters from the Australian Museum. Together they surveyed the island with the findings published in 1870 when the population was listed as 35 people, their 13 houses built of split palm <b>battens</b> thatched {{on the roof and}} sides with palm leaves. At about this time there began a downturn of trade with the demise of the whaling industry and sometimes six or twelve months passed without a vessel calling. With the provisions rotting in the storehouses the older families lost interest in market gardening.|$|E

50|$|The {{origins of}} Church House {{can be traced}} back to 1792 when Edward <b>Batten</b> formed Messrs. <b>Batten</b> & Co. <b>Batten</b> was the senior of three {{partners}} and was later joined by his son John <b>Batten</b> in 1829. After a number of mergers and acquisitions in the nineteenth and early twentieth century the bank grew, until a number of the members of the <b>Batten</b> family were casualties of the First World War, leading to the company being purchased by what became the Westminster Bank.|$|R
25|$|A {{ledge and}} brace door often called plank or batten doors {{are made from}} {{multiple}} vertical planks or narrower <b>battens</b> fixed together by two or more horizontal timbers called ledges and sometimes kept square by additional diagonal timbers called braces.|$|E
25|$|A {{solid wood}} floor is a floor laid with planks or <b>battens</b> created {{from a single}} piece of timber, usually a hardwood. Since wood is hydroscopic (it acquires and loses {{moisture}} from the ambient conditions around it) this potential instability effectively limits the length and width of the boards.|$|E
25|$|In {{one of the}} gables was a {{hallmark}} of the station's architects, a bargeboard with the scroll-sawn word FREIGHT. Aesthetically, it reflects the Stick style common in the period of its construction, with its well-integrated forms and flamboyant detailing leaving the building's singular function apparent. The <b>battens</b> provide vertical scale and the window trim the horizontal.|$|E

50|$|Loads are {{attached}} to the <b>batten</b> in various ways. Most lighting fixtures, for example, utilize a C-clamp to rigidly secure the light onto the <b>batten,</b> in conjunction with a safety cable that is looped around the <b>batten</b> to prevent the light from falling should the C-clamp connection fail. Non-traveling curtains (e.g., borders) often employ cloth ties, similar to shoestrings, that are hand tied onto the <b>batten.</b>|$|R

25|$|The new and {{slightly}} larger St James, built of weatherboard and <b>battens,</b> was dedicated in 1878. It was another 85 {{years before the}} church was extended to its present-day size to cater for a growing congregation (1963). In 1968 a damaging tornado hit Kerikeri with enough force to skew St James' off line. Services had to be held elsewhere until a major repair and restoration was completed. The church bell came from HMNZS Black Prince, a light cruiser which had served with the Royal New Zealand Navy.|$|E
25|$|The Sumbanese clan {{house is}} largely a timber and bamboo constructions, bamboo being more used {{on the western side}} of Sumba Island than on the east. Tree trunks {{constitute}} the four principal house posts and other load bearing elements. Only certain hardwoods are reserved for the construction of special ancestral houses (uma marapu). Walls are made from panels of plaited bamboo, or woven coconut leaf. Whole bamboo culms constitute the floor. The roof is made of a dense thatch of alang-alang grass, tied with coconut leaf to <b>battens</b> made from saplings.|$|E
25|$|The keeper's {{residence}} {{includes two}} cottages, timber framed, clad with asbestos cement sheets and timber <b>battens,</b> painted white.

30|$|During {{the past}} decades, several {{researches}} {{have concentrated on}} the performance of steel built-up <b>batten</b> columns due to axial loads (Hosseini Hashemi and Jafari 2009, 2012). Following the Bam earthquake of 2003 in south-eastern Iran, several steel structures were damaged (Eshghi et al. 2003). Failure of the built-up <b>batten</b> columns {{was one of the most}} observable failure modes in damaged buildings (Hosseini Hashemi and Jafari 2004; Hosseinzadeh 2004). In most of these studies, the behavior of the <b>batten</b> columns due to gravitational loads was investigated. In other words, most of the researchers neglected the effect of the lateral loads on the behavior of steel <b>batten</b> columns (Hosseini Hashemi and Jafari 2004). Following the Bam earthquake, some studies were conducted to investigate the behavior of <b>batten</b> columns due to the earthquake. Razzaghi et al. (2010) investigated the performance of built-up <b>batten</b> columns due to axial and cyclic lateral loads. The results of this study revealed that laterally loaded <b>batten</b> columns had extremely unstable behaviors in the post-buckling region. It was also shown that existing code provisions are not sufficient for seismic design of <b>batten</b> columns. Furthermore, Hosseini Hashemi and Hassanzadeh (2008) studied the performance of the damaged steel building with <b>batten</b> columns due to the Bam earthquake.|$|R
