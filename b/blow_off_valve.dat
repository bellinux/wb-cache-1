25|$|The {{primary use}} of this valve is to {{maintain}} the spinning of the turbocharger at a high speed. The air is usually recycled back into the turbocharger inlet (diverter or bypass valves), but can also be vented to the atmosphere (<b>blow</b> <b>off</b> <b>valve).</b> Recycling back into the turbocharger inlet is required on an engine that uses a mass-airflow fuel injection system, because dumping the excessive air overboard downstream of the mass airflow sensor causes an excessively rich fuel mixture—because the mass-airflow sensor has already accounted for the extra air {{that is no longer}} being used. Valves that recycle the air also shorten the time needed to re-spool the turbocharger after sudden engine deceleration, since load on the turbocharger when the valve is active is much lower than if the air charge vents to atmosphere.|$|E
50|$|Both SOHC and DOHC {{versions}} have an aluminium head. The SOHC versions have 2 valves per cylinder and the DOHC versions have 4 valves per cylinder; each {{cam lobe}} moves only one valve. All RB engines have belt-driven cams and a cast iron block. Most turbo models have an intercooled turbo (the exceptions being the single cam RB20ET & RB30ET engines), {{and most have}} a recirculating factory <b>blow</b> <b>off</b> <b>valve</b> (the exceptions being when fitted to Laurels and Cefiros) to reduce compressor surge when the throttle quickly closes. The Nissan RB Engine {{is derived from the}} six cylinder Nissan L20A engine which has the same bore and stroke as the RB20. All RB engines were made in Yokohama, Japan where the new VR38DETT is now made. Some RB engines were rebuilt by Nissan's NISMO division at the Omori Factory in Tokyo as well. All Z-Tune Skylines were completely rebuilt at the Omori Factory.|$|E

50|$|Repairs were {{completed}} {{towards the end}} of October. On 30 October, as she raised steam to get underway and rejoin the fleet, the valve began to leak once more. The bonnet <b>blew</b> <b>off</b> the <b>valve,</b> flooding the boiler room with steam from two boilers. Ten of the eleven crewmen in the room were killed, with the last surviving until 23:30 that evening.|$|R
25|$|The ported shroud is a {{performance}} enhancement {{that allows the}} compressor to operate at significantly lower flows. It achieves this by forcing a simulation of impeller stall to occur continuously. Allowing some air to escape at this location inhibits the onset of surge and widens the operating range. While peak efficiencies may decrease, high efficiency may be achieved over a greater range of engine speeds. Increases in compressor efficiency result in slightly cooler (more dense) intake air, which improves power. This is a passive structure that is constantly open (in contrast to compressor exhaust <b>blow</b> <b>off</b> <b>valves,</b> which are mechanically or electronically controlled). The ability of the compressor to provide high boost at low rpm may also be increased marginally (because near choke conditions the compressor draws air inward through the bleed path). Ported shrouds are used by many turbocharger manufacturers.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: After {{investigating}} {{the operation of}} the TRT system of the blast furnace and analyzing the structure of the speedy cutting <b>off</b> <b>valve,</b> the functions of the speedy cutting <b>off</b> <b>valve</b> are decomposed by using the reverse fishbone diagram and function analysis. From {{the point of view of}} the system function, the problems of the speedy cutting <b>off</b> <b>valve</b> are described. After the new principle solution is confirmed by effects and the function structure is improved by trimming, the solution to the problems existing in the speedy cutting <b>off</b> <b>valve</b> is put forward...|$|R
