2500|$|The Wall Street Journal critic Joe Morgenstern commented, [...] "'Knight and Day' {{woke me up}} to {{just how}} awful some summer {{entertainments}} have become. It isn't that the film is harmful, except to moviegoers' wallets and movie lovers' morale, {{but that it is}} truly phenomenal for the purity of its incoherence." [...] Writing for the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert rated the movie 3 stars out of 4 and wrote, [...] "'Knight and Day' aspires to the light charm of a romantic action comedy like 'Charade' or 'Romancing the Stone,' but would come closer if it dialed down the relentless action. The romance part goes without saying after a Meet Cute contrived in an airport, and the comedy seems to generate naturally between Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz. <b>But</b> <b>why</b> <b>do</b> so many summer movies find it obligatory to inflict us with CGI overkill? I'd sorta rather see Diaz and Cruise in action scenes on a human scale, rather than have it rubbed in that for long stretches, they're essentially replaced by animation." [...] Ty Burr of The Boston Globe stated, [...] "The movie’s a piece of high-octane summer piffle: stylish, funny, brainless without being too obnoxious about it, and Cruise is its manic animating principle." [...] Writing for the Associated Press, Christy Lemire commented, [...] "Cruise's presence also helps keep things light, breezy and watchable when the action – and the story itself – spin ridiculously out of control." [...] Bill Goodykoontz of The Arizona Republic observed, [...] "Mangold, working from a script by Patrick O'Neill, accelerates events {{in a way that is}} either a perfect representation of how current action films are made or a demonstration of everything that's wrong with movies today. Maybe it's both." [...] Joshua Starnes of ComingSoon.net gave the film a rating of 6.5 out of 10, and concluded his review, [...] "Instead of watching it, you're better off putting [...] "Knight and Day" [...] in a time capsule and singing some Don McLean, 'cause this is the day the movie star died." [...] In a subsequent [...] "mini review", Edward Douglas of ComingSoon.net gave the film a rating of 8 out of 10, and concluded, [...] "The entertainment comes from how much fun it is watching [...] on screen together and that's what separates Knight and Day from previous attempts at mixing romance, comedy, and action." [...] In a review for CNN, Tom Charity commented, [...] "there's a creeping anxiety about this project, a tendency to over-compensate that speaks to underlying inadequacies." ...|$|E
