500|$|The {{match between}} The Steiner Brothers (Rick and Scott) and The Headshrinkers (Samu and Fatu) had little background, {{although}} Afa, who managed The Headshrinkers, claimed {{that his team}} would [...] "tear [...] heads off". Doink the Clown and Crush had been feuding since the January 2, 1993, episode of WWF Superstars of Wrestling. After Crush's match on that show, he confronted Doink, who had thrown a ball at {{a child in the}} audience. Crush grabbed Doink <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> warned him not to play any more pranks on children. Doink, wearing a cast on the arm that Crush had supposedly injured by grabbing, came to ringside during Crush's match on the January 18 episode of WWF Monday Night Raw. He apologized to Crush and gave him a flower; when Crush walked away, Doink removed a prosthetic arm from his cast and attacked Crush, who was later taken away in an ambulance due to kayfabe (storyline) injuries. For storyline purposes, Crush was said to be too injured to compete in the 1993 Royal Rumble match. Doink continued his pranks by squirting Crush with a water pistol and recording video messages to Crush, which showed two Doinks on the screen.|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins at}} a formal party in which Spears {{seems to be}} looking for someone. The opening shot of her was {{inspired}} by the scene of Jennifer Love Hewitt walking into the party in Can't Hardly Wait (1998). Her boyfriend (Bradshaw) talks with two people next to her. He persuades her to smile to avoid embarrassment from the guests then verbally abuses her and grabs her face, after which she leaves to the restroom, where she wipes away a tear and puts on her fragrance Radiance. She comes back to the party and catches her boyfriend flirting with another woman; Spears tells her [...] "So you're not working the street corner tonight I see?", making her boyfriend angry. He apologizes to the other woman for his girlfriend's remark then grabs Spears <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> carries her outside the building. After he slaps her, one of the waiters of the party (Trawick) wearing a leather jacket punches her boyfriend several times. The waiter asks Spears if she is okay, and after she kicks her boyfriend in the crotch goodbye, she replies [...] "Now I'm okay." [...] She and the waiter climb on his motorcycle and leave the scene. When they get to his house, it is revealed by a newspaper that he is a criminal. She opens one of the lockers in his house and finds a gun, after which the couple kisses. This is followed by scenes of them having sex.|$|E

60|$|While these executioners were employed, the Captain's {{excitement}} had {{a little}} time to abate; and when, at last, old Ushant was tied up <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> legs and his venerable back was exposed--that back which had bowed at the guns of the frigate Constitution when she captured the Guerriere--the Captain seemed to relent.|$|R

2500|$|In response, Indiana University {{president}} Myles Brand {{announced that}} he had adopted a [...] "zero tolerance" [...] policy with regard to Knight's behavior. Later in the year, in September 2000, Indiana freshman Kent Harvey reportedly said, [...] "Hey, Knight, what's up?" [...] to Knight. According to Harvey, Knight then grabbed him <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> lectured him for not showing him respect, insisting that Harvey address him as either [...] "Mr. Knight" [...] or [...] "Coach Knight" [...] instead of simply [...] "Knight." [...] Brand stated that this incident was only one of numerous complaints that occurred after the zero-tolerance policy had been put into place. Brand asked Knight to resign on September 10, and when Knight refused, Brand relieved him of his coaching duties effective immediately. Knight's dismissal was met with outrage from students. That night, thousands of Indiana students marched from Indiana University's Assembly Hall to Brand's home, burning Brand in effigy.|$|E
