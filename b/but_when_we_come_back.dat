"I {{know that}} you have all engaged in this affair for love of Sir Marmaduke or myself, and because you hate to see a loyal gentleman made the victim of lying knaves; <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> with the king, you may be sure that Sir Marmaduke and I will well reward the {{services}} you have rendered." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The motive, Paret--the motive {{that sends}} us all {{wandering}} into is divine, is inherited from God himself. And the same motive, after our eyes shall have been opened, after {{we shall have}} seen and known the tragedy and misery of life, after we shall have made the mistakes and committed the sins and experienced the emptiness--the same motive will lead us back again. That, too, is an adventure, the greatest adventure of all. Because, when we go back we shall not find the same God--or rather we shall recognize him in ourselves. Autonomy is godliness, knowledge is godliness. We went away cringing, superstitious, we saw everywhere omens and evidences of his wrath in the earth and sea and sky, we burned candles and sacrificed animals in the vain hope of averting scourges and other calamities. <b>But</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> it will be with a knowledge of his ways, gained at a price,--the price he, too, must have paid--and we shall {{be able to stand}} up and look him in the face, and all our childish superstitions and optimisms shall have been burned away." ...|$|E
30|$|In {{classical}} metric spaces, {{the following}} result Lemma  3.5 is clear. <b>But</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> to RN modules, {{it is not}} easy to be proved.|$|R
60|$|There {{were three}} parcels, two {{very small and}} one pretty big, lying on the table, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> to look for names there were none.|$|R
6000|$|... "Was awfully afraid you'd think <b>we</b> were fresh, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> in last night, and {{saw your}} car--didn't like {{the looks of}} the hotel much, and thought we'd stick around." ...|$|R
60|$|The Bart was {{of opinion}} {{that this was}} the best that <b>we</b> could do, <b>but,</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> to talk it over, the Abbot made us see that there were {{difficulties}} in the way.|$|R
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> {{to call to}} {{mind the}} last words of parties who took the trouble to make the proper {{preparation}} for the occasion, we immediately notice a happy difference in the result.|$|R
6000|$|... "The late Mr. Matthew Vassar," [...] said he, [...] "was truly a benefactor to his kind, {{and a man}} {{worthy of}} all respect; <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> to {{consider}} {{the way in which}} the leading circles of society are made up--" ...|$|R
60|$|Harold came, {{and stood}} towering above {{us with his}} hands in his pockets; <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> to the Temptation of Eve, Dora broke out into an exclamation that excited my curiosity too much not to be pursued, though it was hardly edifying.|$|R
6000|$|When {{you asked}} them {{the price of}} their wares they always said, [...] "Au plaisir" [...] i. e., {{whatever}} you please; <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> to offer them money, we found [...] "au plaisir" [...] meant so much at any rate, and as much more as they could get.|$|R
6000|$|The Spaniard flung {{his arms}} up when Austin {{translated}} this. [...] "Who knows?" [...] he said. [...] "I am only an ignorant sailorman, and cannot tell; <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> here the SeÃ±or Austin promised {{us that we}} should have all that was reasonable. It is not fitting that men should die and nothing be done to save them." ...|$|R
60|$|We passed those seas {{with less}} {{difficulty}} {{than in other}} places, the winds {{to the south of}} Java being more variable, and the weather good, though sometimes we met with squally weather and short storms; <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> in among the Spice Islands themselves we had a share of the monsoons, or trade-winds, and made use of them accordingly.|$|R
60|$|This view {{does not}} seen to involve any {{necessary}} contradiction with itself {{or with the}} accepted facts of Logic. <b>But,</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> to test it, as applied to the actual facts of life, we shall find I think, that it fits in with them so badly that its adoption would be, {{to say the least}} of it, singularly inconvenient for ordinary folk.|$|R
5000|$|However, {{the truth}} is the photo does not spell any message at all in semaphore. Robert Freeman {{confirms}} this: [...] "I had the idea of semaphore spelling out the letters HELP. <b>But</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> to do the shot the arrangement of the arms with those letters didn't look good. So we decided to improvise and ended up with the best graphic positioning of the arms." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Only your brother, Myers, my dear; {{somehow or}} other, {{we made a}} mistake in our figures, which made out a demand in his favor of $100,000. I paid it in property, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> to look over the figures it was {{discovered}} that a cypher too much had been thrown in, and Myers paid back the difference like a man, as he is." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{album cover}} shows the Beatles {{with their arms}} {{positioned}} to spell out a word in flag semaphore. According to cover photographer Robert Freeman, [...] "I had the idea of semaphore spelling out the letters [...] "HELP". <b>But</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> to do the shot, {{the arrangement of the}} arms with those letters didn't look good. So we decided to improvise and ended up with the best graphic positioning of the arms." ...|$|R
5000|$|Some {{songs were}} already written before I joined, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> {{back from the}} US tour with Testament last year, we started writing the last songs, which became [...] "Bury Your Dead", [...] "Leech", [...] "Trespass" [...] and [...] "Revelation". Jonas, Anders or Jensen will bring in riffs, or a verse and chorus, and all the members can then have their input {{on the way the}} song will go. Per Möller Jensen ...|$|R
60|$|In short, I {{hired the}} honest {{man and his}} horse; <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> to a town upon the road (I do not {{remember}} the name of it, but it stands upon a river), I pretended myself very ill, and I could go no farther that night but if he would stay there with me, because I was a stranger, I would pay him for himself and his horse with all my heart.|$|R
60|$|The people cheered also {{and made}} jests, saying that I should soon {{practice}} astrology in the palace. But, {{as soon as}} we might, I and my uncle escaped, and made our way back to the house. All the while he rated me for my rashness; <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> to the chamber of the house he embraced me and rejoiced greatly, because I had overthrown the giant with so little hurt to myself.|$|R
6000|$|... 'When {{will he be}} back?'--she kept on {{fiercely}} {{repeating the}} question; and then burst out,--'Curse you gentlemen all! Cowards! you are all in a league against us poor girls! You can hunt alone when you betray us, and lie fast enough then? <b>But</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> for justice, you all herd together like a flock of rooks; and turn so delicate and honourable all of a sudden--to each other! When will he be back, I say?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wait! Yes, {{and what}} has <b>come</b> of waiting? <b>We</b> don't wait at all in {{doubling}} our population every thirty-three years; <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> to the feeding of them we are always for waiting. It is that waiting which has reduced the intellectual development of {{one half of the}} human race to its present terribly low state--or rather prevented its rising in a degree proportionate to the increase of the population. No more waiting for me, mother, if I can help it." ...|$|R
40|$|The {{researches}} {{of systematic}} botanists in Australia have been chiefly directed to elucidate {{the members of}} the more conspicuous phyla. Inquiry into the Flowering plants, Gymnosperms, Pterydophyta, Biyophyta, and the larger marine Algae has steadily progressed, though many forms belonging to most of these groups yet remain to be discovered and described. <b>But</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> to the important groups of the freshwater Algae and the Fungi we find information still in a very backward condition. We have six genera of the family, and the following key was used to assist in their recognition...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes; he was {{to teach}} Bertha. We found him helping the little Sandbrook to slide, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> he sent him in with the little maid, and gave Bertha a lesson, which did not last long, for she grew nervous. Really her nerves will never be what they were! Then Maria begged for a slide, {{and you know what}} any sort of {{monotonous}} bodily motion is to her; there is no getting her to leave off, and I never saw anything like the spirit and good-nature with which he complied.' ...|$|R
60|$|Soon, {{another shot}} was fired, and the cow fell. Leaving {{some of the}} natives {{to look after the}} dead cattle, the rest of us hurried on after the bull; his dreadful bellowing guiding us to the spot where he lay. Wounded in the shoulder, in his fright and agony he had bounded into the wood; <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> up to him, he had sunk to the earth in a green hollow, {{thrusting}} his black muzzle into a pool of his own blood, and tossing it over his hide in clots.|$|R
6000|$|... "Lead on," [...] he cried, [...] "show it to us." [...] He {{went ahead}} with me, {{travelling}} so fast that I must needs run to keep up, and fairly lifting me over the logs. <b>But</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> in sight of the place he darted forward alone and went through it like a hound on the trail. The others followed him, crying out {{at the size of}} the place and poking among the ashes. At length they all took up the trail for a way down the creek. Presently Clark called a halt.|$|R
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> to Madrid, <b>we</b> {{being all}} of us strangers to Spain, were willing to stay some {{time to see the}} court of Spain, and to see what was worth observing; but it being {{the latter part of the}} summer, we hastened away, and set out from Madrid about the middle of October; <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> to the edge of Navarre, we were alarmed, at several towns on the way, with an account that so much snow was fallen on the French side of the mountains, that several {{travellers}} were obliged to come back to Pampeluna, after having attempted, at an extreme hazard, to pass on.|$|R
60|$|So also in {{that same}} sweet valley, of which I have just been speaking, between Chamouni and the Valais, at every turn of the {{pleasant}} pathway, where {{the scent of the}} thyme lies richest upon its rocks, we shall see a little cross and shrine set under one of them; and go up to it, hoping to receive some happy thought of the Redeemer, by whom all these lovely things were made, and still consist. <b>But</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> near--behold, beneath the cross, a rude picture of souls tormented in red tongues of hell fire, and pierced by demons.|$|R
5000|$|... “Stevie Wonder, Sam Cooke, Ras Shorty, Bob Marley; {{they focused}} on the {{betterment}} and education of mankind that was the prime purpose of the music, {{for you to get}} the music and for you to live it out at the same time. We artistes are human beings too and we have so much power with the microphone in our hands, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> off that stage we go back to normal life and it’s about practicing what you are preaching as well … you need to live what you teach … I try to be the best I can be every single day.” ...|$|R
60|$|Doctrine, therefore, {{does not}} cause dissensions; rather a {{doctrine}} alone can cure our dissensions. It is necessary to ask, however, roughly, what abstract and ideal shape in state or family would fulfil the human hunger; and this apart from whether we can completely obtain it or not. <b>But</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> to ask what is the need of normal men, what is the desire of all nations, what is the ideal house, or road, or rule, or republic, or king, or priesthood, then we are confronted with a strange and irritating difficulty peculiar to the present time; and we must call a temporary halt and examine that obstacle.|$|R
6000|$|... "I think, Hilda, that {{although}} the matter cannot be decided, it certainly points to your theory that this man is not the John Simcoe who left Stowmarket twenty years ago. He attempted, and I think very cleverly, to establish his identity by a visit to Stowmarket, and no doubt did so to everyone's perfect satisfaction; <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> {{to go into the}} thing step by step, we see that everything he did might have been done by anyone who happened to have a close resemblance to John Simcoe in figure and some slight resemblance in face, after listening for three days to Miss Simcoe's gossip." ...|$|R
60|$|June 20.--We settled {{this morning}} {{to go to church}} at Lochore, that is, at Ballingray; <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> to the earthly paradise so called, we were let off for there was no sermon, for which I could not in my heart be sorry. So, after looking at Lochore, back <b>we</b> <b>came</b> to lounge and loiter about till dinner-time. The rest of the day was good company, good cheer, and good conversation. Yet to be idle here is not the thing, and to be busy is impossible, so I wish myself home again in spite of good entertainment. We leave to-night after an early dinner, and I will get to work again.|$|R
60|$|Here we took in water, {{and stood}} {{off and on}} upon the Arabian shore. We had not cruised here above three days, or thereabouts, but I spied a sail, and gave her chase; <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> up with her, never was such a poor prize chased by pirates that looked for booty, for we found nothing in her but poor, half-naked Turks, going a pilgrimage to Mecca, to the tomb of their prophet Mahomet. The junk that carried them had no one thing worth taking away but a little rice and some coffee, which was all the poor wretches had for their subsistence; so we let them go, for indeed we knew not {{what to do with}} them.|$|R
5000|$|After {{extensive}} {{national and}} international shows they started working on their final album, Mercury, which was released in 1995. Originally the band {{wanted to do a}} worship-based album. Campuzano says [...] "When we were were discussing this record, {{a lot of people said}} Shawl was a negative album, so we all kinda wanted to do this real drony 'get lost in the music' type record -- only with praise songs. But we really started just disliking each other, so that didn't allow us to fully praise God, because there's just too much disconnection in the band. [...] Taber says [...] "before Mercury, I wanted to record a more worshipful album. Eric Campuzano did too, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> together, the dynamic in the band produced something different." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, it's {{very well}} to say [...] "don't" [...] Miss Floy,' {{returned}} the Nipper, much exasperated; 'but raly begging your pardon we're coming to such passes that it turns all the blood in a person's body into pins and needles, with their pints all ways. Don't mistake me, Miss Floy, I don't mean nothing again your ma-in-law who has always treated me as a lady should though she is rather high I must say not that I have any right to object to that particular, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> to Mrs Pipchinses and having them put over us and keeping guard at your Pa's door like crocodiles (only make us thankful that they lay no eggs!) we are a growing too outrageous!' ...|$|R
60|$|At {{our first}} {{coming into the}} island we were terrified {{exceedingly}} with {{the sight of the}} barbarous people, whose figure was made more terrible to us than it really was by the report we had of them from the seamen; <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> to converse with them awhile, we found they were not cannibals, as was reported, or such as would fall immediately upon us and eat us up; but they came and sat down by us, and wondered much at our clothes and arms, and made signs to give us some victuals, such as they had, which was only roots and plants dug out of the ground for the present, but they brought us fowls and flesh afterwards in good plenty.|$|R
60|$|At {{first we}} did not suffer so much as I had {{expected}} from the fire of the pirate; <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> had <b>come</b> within one hundred or two hundred yards of them, and when within range of the musketry in their fore and main tops, their fire was truly dreadful.|$|R
