25|$|Mass {{finishing}} is a {{group of}} manufacturing processes that allow large quantities of parts to be simultaneously finished. The goal of this type of finishing is to <b>burnish,</b> deburr, clean, radius, de-flash, descale, remove rust, polish, brighten, surface harden, prepare parts for further finishing, or break off die cast runners. The two main types of mass finishing are tumble finishing, also known as barrel finishing, and vibratory finishing. Both involve the use of a cyclical action to create grinding contact between surfaces. Sometimes the workpieces are finished against each other; however, usually a finishing medium is used. Mass finishing can be performed dry or wet; wet processes have liquid lubricants, cleaners, or abrasives, while dry processes do not. Cycle times can be as short as 10minutes for nonferrous workpieces or as long as 2hours for hardened steel.|$|E
