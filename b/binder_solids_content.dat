40|$|In 2008, the dry-grind ethanol {{industry}} produced 23 {{million metric}} tons of dried distillers grains with solubles (DDGS). Currently DDGS is sold as a feedstock but due to its quality and handling issues, competing with other feed products is challenging. Pellet mills {{have been used in}} the past to enhance DDGS handling and prevent particle segregation during transportation. The current drawback to pelleting DDGS is the high capital and maintenance costs. Instead of using expensive pellet mills, the use of wet granulation has been proposed to enhance DDGS densification and handling while minimizing costs. ^ A lab scale drum granulation process was used to manufacture granules of DDGS by adding condensed distillers solubles (CDS) to wet distillers grains (WDG) under varying formulation and process conditions. A full factorial experimental design was used to test all combinations of factor levels which included CDS binder addition (30, 35, and 40 % (wt/wt)), CDS solids content (22 and 38 %, wet basis), screen size opening (3. 175 and 6. 35 mm), and residence time (1, 2. 5, 5, and 10 min). Measured response variables included mean particle size, bulk density, true density, granule yield (3. 35 - 1. 68 mm), and porosity. Results from the experiment indicated that as binder addition increased between 30, 35, and 40 % mean particle size of the final granules increased to 2. 08, 3. 15, and 4. 45 mm, respectively. As <b>binder</b> <b>solids</b> <b>content</b> increased, the bulk density increased due to the increased amount of dry matter in the final granular product. Porosity decreased as solids content increased mainly due to greater shrinkage of the granules during the drying process. Screen size opening also affected nucleation which influenced the final size and yield of the granules produced. Compression testing of wet granule compacts indicated that increasing CDS binder addition and increasing solids content enhanced granule plasticity. Growth was observed for granules prepared from high binder additions, and low solids content while minimal growth occurred for material prepared from the high solids content CDS. The highest granular yields (~ 80 %) were observed at residence times between 2. 5 and 10 minutes with 35 % binder addition using the high solids content CDS and the small screen size opening. ...|$|E

Hence, in this study, the relationship between the ink rheology and the screen-printed film properties were investigated using nickel/scandia-stabilized-zirconia (NiO/ScSZ) anode inks having various binder (0 - 5 wt%) and <b>solid</b> <b>contents</b> (20 - 35 vol%). Ink rheological tests showed increased particle network strength in the inks with increasing <b>binder</b> and <b>solids</b> <b>content.</b> The electronic conductivity and electrochemical performance of anode films also increased as a function of <b>binder</b> and <b>solids</b> <b>content.</b> These can be related to increased particle network strength within the inks, as confirmed from the rheological studies.

They are fine grained mine tailings with significant clay content, with a small dosage of a General Purpose Cement (GPC) or pozzolanic binder such as Blended Cement (BC) containing slag or fly ash. This paper summarises the findings from an extensive laboratory test program carried out to understand the effects of <b>binder</b> dosage and <b>solid</b> <b>content</b> on the strength development over 56 days of curing. Ten different mixes were studied using 80 specimens, and it was shown that the blended cement mixes give an early gain in strength and stiffness, along with higher long-term values compared to the GPC mixes. It was also shown that the E/UCS, which is the ratio of Young’s modulus (E) to Uniaxial Compressive Strength (UCS), values for the CPB throughout the curing period were {{in the range of}} 150 - 350, with an average value of 250. Two simple mathematical expressions were developed to express UCS as a function of time and the 14 -day UCS value (UCS 14).

Typical chemical coagulants such as alum, ferrous chloride, and polyelectrolytes were employed {{for some of the}} experiments at the optimal dosage. It was found that increasing salinity resulted an increase in SRF. For the range of the salinity tested, the SRF increased from 4 E 14 to about 8 E 12 m/kg. The chemical coagulants show insignificant effect on SRF. For the final <b>solid</b> <b>content</b> of sludge, increase salinity from 5000 to 20 000 ppm can bring 3 - 4 % increase in sludge final <b>solid</b> <b>content</b> due to salting out effect.

40|$|Surface sizing at high at <b>solids</b> <b>contents</b> from 8 % to 30 % yields up to 75 % {{savings in}} afterdrying capacity. Decreasing the wetting {{of the sheet}} will also {{increase}} paper machine efficiency by {{reducing the number of}} web breaks. Also, the same afterdrying capacity can be used for both MSP coating and surface sizing at size <b>solids</b> <b>contents</b> of 20 %- 30 %. Surface sizing <b>solids</b> <b>contents</b> of up to 30 % have not been used due to the insufficient stability of starch at elevated <b>solids</b> <b>contents</b> and maintaining the binding power of the starch. Also the ability to maintain the amount of starch at the MSP application at very high <b>solids</b> <b>contents</b> has been lacking. Here, both the chemistry of the starch solutions and the application technology used needed to be developed in order to produce the desired applied starch amount at starch <b>solids</b> <b>contents</b> of up to 30 % with desired binding properties. The features of the base paper also needed to be adjusted to fit the features of high solids surface sizing. The findings of this study prove {{that it is possible to}} use a wide variety of starch viscosities and molecular weights even at increased <b>solids</b> <b>contents.</b> Increasing starch <b>solids</b> <b>contents</b> with more stable starches is therefore not restricted to highly degraded starches only with their lower binding power. When the <b>solids</b> <b>content</b> of the starch solution is increased from 8 % to 30 %, less starch penetrates into the sheet and more starch remains on the paper surface. The concentration of starch on the surface of paper decreases sheet porosity, oil absorption and internal strength, as well as increases its surface strength and bending stiffness. At very high <b>solids</b> <b>contents</b> internal strength behavior also suggests that starch may locally penetrate into the larger sheet pores. This observation is supported by pore size distribution analysis. The base paper for high solids surface sizing can also be optimized by adjusting the press to dryer web draw. Here, the aim could be to minimize the press draw below 2 % when internal strength or air permeability are critical. A method for obtaining more informative starch distribution curves was developed to provide a helpful tool in characterizing the effect of various process parameters on the z-distribution of starch in the sheet. An additional feature of this method is the definition of a dimensionless penetration number Qtot that can be used to quantitatively compare the penetration of surface sizing starch in different paper samples. A novel interpretation is presented of the role of surface sizing starch with respect to the elastic modulus and bending stiffness properties of the sheet. When increasing the elastic modulus or bending stiffness of the sheet, starch may merely promote shrinkage potential instead, which leads – when shrinkage is not allowed – to increased drying stress that, in turn, leads to an increase in the elastic modulus of the sheet and a further increase in bending stiffness. reviewe...|$|R
