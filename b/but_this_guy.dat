His final public concerts were held in Fukuoka Dome in Japan on December 19–20, 1994. The {{following}} year, Sinatra sang for the very last time on February 25, 1995, before a live audience of 1200 select guests at the Palm Desert Marriott Ballroom, on the closing night of the Frank Sinatra Desert Classic golf tournament. Esquire reported of the show that Sinatra was [...] "clear, tough, on the money" [...] and [...] "in absolute control". Sinatra was awarded the Legend Award at the 1994 Grammy Awards, where he was introduced by Bono, who said of him, [...] "Frank's {{the chairman of the}} bad attitude...

2500|$|Sergi López as Captain Vidal, Ofelia's new {{stepfather}} and a Falange officer. Del Toro {{met with}} López in Barcelona, {{a year and}} a half before filming began, to ask him to play Vidal. In Spain, López was considered a melodramatic or comedic actor, and the producers told Del Toro [...] "You should be very careful because you don't know about these things because you're Mexican, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> is not going to be able to deliver the performance"; del Toro replied [...] "Well, it's not that I don't know, it's that I don't care". Of his character, López said: [...] "He is the most evil character I've ever played in my career. It is impossible to improve upon it; the character is so solid and so well written. Vidal is deranged, a psychopath who is impossible to defend. Even though his father's personality marked his existence—and is certainly one of the reasons for his mental disorder—that cannot be an excuse. It would seem to be very cynical to use that to justify or explain his cruel and cowardly acts. I think it is great that the film does not consider any justification of fascism." ...|$|E

5000|$|The third last episode [...] "Annihilated" [...] was {{predicted}} {{to be an}} Emmy contender for Christopher Meloni in the Envelope section of The LA Times. Dylan Walsh guest starred as Malcolm Royce, a family man involved in a murder suicide. Meloni described Walsh's character as [...] "outwardly a family man like Elliot, who has everything going for him, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>guy's</b> living a double life." [...] In the second last episode [...] "Pretend", Misti Traya guest starred {{as a woman who}} had been posing as a teenager for years. Noting the similarities, Neal Baer said the writers were [...] "stunned" [...] to hear about the sex offender Neil Havens Rodreick who was caught disguising himself as a twelve-year-old shortly after the episode was written. In the season finale [...] "Screwed", Chris [...] "Ludacris" [...] Bridges concluded the storyline of his character Darius Parker by defending himself in court. Baer described his performance saying [...] "He defends himself which is cool. So now he takes on the role of a lawyer with Steven Weber playing his lawyer as well." ...|$|R
5000|$|The TVParty site {{reviewer}} wrote, [...] "Stephen Lynch's musical tour {{de force}} through his demented psyche begins with a heaping hunk of blasphemy followed by even more sacrilegious tuneage along with peppy songs about dating white girls, loving Nazis, wishing for his grandfather's death, and a cute ditty about Satan (more blasphemy). <b>But</b> it works. <b>This</b> <b>guy</b> can really write some funny tunes {{and he has the}} vocal chops to pull it off." ...|$|R

5000|$|Frankie Dettori recalls: [...] "Many years ago, when I was 17 or 18, {{there was}} a {{programme}} on Channel 4 at about midnight called After Dark, a discussion show for people who couldn't sleep! I came in from a night out and there was McCririck {{and a couple of}} others sitting there on the TV talking a load of rubbish. <b>But</b> there was <b>this</b> <b>guy,</b> sitting there quietly, who would chip in every now and again and say something which was quite outstanding. That was Barney Curley and I was drawn to him like a magnet." ...|$|R
5000|$|Film critic Roger Ebert {{awarded the}} film three stars out of four, praising {{the film as}} [...] "art crossed with anthropology" [...] with a [...] "painful underside". In her review for The New York Times, Janet Maslin wrote, [...] "Dazed and Confused has an enjoyably playful spirit, one that amply {{compensates}} for its lack of structure". Desson Howe, in his review for The Washington Post, wrote, [...] "Dazed succeeds {{on its own terms}} and reflects American culture so well, it becomes part of it". In her review for The Austin Chronicle, Marjorie Baumgarten gave particular praise to Matthew McConaugheys performance: [...] "He is a character were all too familiar with in the movies <b>but</b> McConaughey nails <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> without a hint of condescension or whimsy, claiming this character for all time as his own".|$|R
5000|$|... "As a rule, safeties aren't {{talked about}} going that high. <b>But</b> <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> I think in everybody's mind impacts the game.

Following Tennessee's 37-14 loss to Virginia Tech in the 2009 Chick-fil-A Bowl, Berry announced his decision to forgo his final year of college football eligibility, entering the 2010 NFL Draft. At the NFL combine, Berry officially ran a 4.47 40-yard dash time.|$|E
5000|$|Reviews of the singer's {{most recent}} {{tribute to the}} Great White Way were positive: Michael Portantiere of TheaterMania.com wrote that [...] "Mathis comes across with the smooth, rich, velvety vocalism {{for which he is}} legendary," [...] noting that certain songs covered on the album [...] "require the kind of breath support, legato, and phrasing that {{precious}} few singers of Mathis's age can supply. <b>But</b> <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> still has the right stuff, in abundance." [...] Billboard magazine echoed these sentiments: [...] "The legendary performer breathes fresh perspective into songs that might sound overdone in lesser hands." [...] And William Ruhlmann of AllMusic {{goes so far as to}} say that [...] "the lesser talents among the composers -- Lloyd Webber, Wildhorn, Claude-Michel Schönberg -- owe Mathis a debt for making their music sound so good, while Sondheim can be grateful that Mathis makes him sound so accessible.|$|E
5000|$|Rob {{begins a}} {{relationship}} with Roxanne Miller (Lisa Lackey); but Lackey was unhappy with the storyline. She told a writer from Inside Soap that their relationship was [...] "ridiculous" [...] {{because she did not}} believe that Roxanne would be with [...] "someone like Rob". She added that her character is [...] "into equal rights for women, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> she's falling in love with seems so sexist - he's everything she hates." [...] Rob manages to convince Roxanne to date him and they become a couple; but soon after she discovers that she is ill. Rob and Roxanne decide to shower together and he finds a lump in her breast. She is later diagnosed with breast cancer. Lackey explained that [...] "Rob can't cope and Roxy's afraid he's going to leave her". She is only twenty-five and she needs Rob to reassure her that she is still attractive.|$|E
5000|$|The single's video, {{directed}} by Stéphane Sednaoui, was {{included as a}} bonus video on the DVD release of In View - The Best of R.E.M. 1988-2003. [...] "I {{wanted to work with}} Stephane for a long time," [...] Stipe explained to MTV UK during An Hour with R.E.M. in 2001 after selecting the video for airplay. [...] "Since I saw the video that he did with Björk for, what was that called, [...] "Big Time Sexuality" [...] or something? Where she looks exactly like Shirley MacLaine, 1959-1961. The Apartment, I think, {{was the name of the}} film. Shirley McLaine and Björk as Shirley MacLaine on the back of a pick-up truck driving down 5th Avenue in New York City, probably. <b>But</b> I thought <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> exudes sex, he's like sex on a stick, and I wanted to work with him for that reason.

5000|$|In a video {{released}} by the CIA, the CIA observers can be heard discussing whether the plane is a [...] "bandido" [...] (drug plane) or [...] "amigo" [...] (friendly). A CIA officer then tells a Peruvian Air Force official {{that it may be}} possible to have the plane land to check. The Peruvian Air Force plane then issues a warning to the plane for not having an authorized flight plan, but the pilot did not hear it because he was on a different frequency. As the Peruvian Air Force plane prepared to open fire, a CIA officer can be heard saying that the plane [...] "doesn't fit the profile", and another CIA official says, [...] "Ok, I understand this is not our call, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> is at 4,500 feet and he is not taking any evasive action.

5000|$|When {{asked if}} the series would deal with the new Batman being unable to fill Bruce Wayne's proverbial shoes, Morrison answered, [...] "When I started out I had that in mind, and I thought we'd finally prove that nobody else could be Batman. But I do believe certain aspects of RIP were about how nobody <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> could be Batman. I think with this, it's fun to start by seeing what happens when someone else tries. Sometimes it goes wrong, and {{sometimes}} it goes really well. Some of the things these guys do are things that Bruce Wayne would never have thought to do." [...] In regards to using Frank Quitely as the opening artist, Morrison described the difference between this particular collaboration with previous ones, specifically on JLA Earth-2 and All-Star Superman. For instance, Morrison asked Quitely to choreograph {{the flow of the}} action in his own way, rather than through Morrison's normally heavily detailed scripts.|$|E

5000|$|That afternoon, a Yolo County {{deputy sheriff}} patrolling along {{a stretch of}} California State Route 16 along Cache Creek north of Rumsey saw a black Nissan Maxima sedan in a county park's lot for the second {{straight}} day. He looked inside and saw CDs, credit cards, and various papers scattered around. The car had not been reported stolen, so his superiors contacted the Alhambra police when they found out who it was registered to, and officers there informed Fernandez that it had been found, but not her son. How does this guy not pop up somewhere? I mean, big guy has to eat {{three or four times a}} day... I can see how a lot of people who don't stand out can disappear, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> stands out. Dean Nyland, Yolo County sheriff's detective A search of the surrounding terrain of Cache Creek Canyon began shortly afterward. Search and rescue teams began looking over the lightly forested terrain surrounding the stream. They were assisted by teams on all-terrain vehicles and helicopters. An airplane with a thermographic camera flew over the area, and search dogs were brought in as well. The area within a five-mile (5 mi) radius of the parking lot was covered, as well as the 27 mi of Route 16 through the canyon.|$|E
5000|$|In April 2013, in an {{interview}} with XXL, Currensy spoke about the incorporation of flutes on the EP, saying: [...] "Let’s think about what Ron Burgundy’s jazz flute did to Mrs. Corningstone. Ron Burgundy mastered that flute and it made him able to bring her to Pleasure Town on animated horses and they were fuckin’ out in the solar system and all of that. So how could we not employ the talents of Ron Burgundy and his jazz flute on as many cuts as possible for Live in Concert. Nah, man. Honestly, that is the genius that is Bobbi Humphrey and his album that was put together long before me and my brother Wiz ever thought about rapping. Laughs I think at one point there’s maybe like two minutes of flute and nothing else. It’s for everybody’s soul, man. Some people don’t understand it immediately, but after they give it a second and third listen, they understand the music." [...] He went on to explain the sample clearance issues with the EP, saying: [...] "These are them sans one record that we didn’t put on because the person who owned the rights to that record…See we have no problem paying for clearances. I got no problem with that. <b>But</b> <b>this</b> <b>guy,</b> not only were we going to pay him for the sample clearance but he was trying to change lyrics. Things he didn’t like that Wiz said about a chick and shit he didn’t like that I said about weed. Basically we were like “Fam, if you don’t wanna make the bread then cool. We just won’t put the record out.” So homie chose not to pick up the bread and that’s fine. We’re not gonna jump through all these hoops on someone’s behalf when I feel like what we’re doing is going to put some more light on a body of work that our listeners don’t know shit about. We want them to know about it. That’s why we went through the proper channels to do it that way, so people who do their due diligence will see what this project sampled and want to hear that whole album. Then you pick up more money. You pick up the money ’cause we paid you to clear it and then you pick up the money from the kids who go to get the original album." ...|$|E
