I think of the organisers of the Tour, who shortened the time trial to make him lose. His home town of Rouen organises commemorations <b>but,</b> <b>me,</b> I haven't forgotten that it was in Antwerp that he made his farewell appearance. More than once, I saw him crying in his hotel room after suffering the spitting and insults of spectators. People said he was cold, a calculator, a dilettante. The truth is that Jacques was a monster of courage. In the mountains, he suffered as though he was damned. He wasn't a climber. But with bluffing, with guts, he tore them to shreds (il les a tous couillonnés).|$|E

And in effect you are chained down by your inability to say what you feel or go after what you want.

You do it because you choose to. No one put the chain around this neck <b>but</b> <b>me.</b> I wrote 'Express Yourself' to tell women around the world that pick and choose the best for yourself, before that chain around your neck, kills you instead.

500|$|In September 1936, Mickal played {{quarterback for}} the Centennial College All-Stars, a team {{composed}} of college players from southern schools to play against the National Football League's Chicago Bears at Cotton Bowl stadium. He scored the All-Stars' only touchdown with a dive {{into the end zone}} from the one-foot line in the third quarter. The Bears scored their only touchdown later that quarter on a 5-yard run by Bronko Nagurski. Mickal had a chance to tackle Nagurski before the goal line. [...] "A lot of things flashed through my mind," [...] explained Mickal. [...] "There was nothing between him and the goal line <b>but</b> <b>me.</b> I thought about making the perfect tackle and reading about being the All-Stars' hero. Then I thought about Nagurski's size. I thought about the Nagurski legend. I thought about going to med school. I thought about possible brain damage." [...] He decided to step aside and let Nagurski score. The extra point, however, was blocked by Bob Reynolds, and the game ended 7–6 in favor of the All-Stars. It was the first time a team of college players defeated a professional American football team.|$|E

The idea for the episode was pitched by former staff writer George Meyer, who wanted to make an episode in which Homer becomes addicted to medicinal marijuana. Executive producer and current showrunner Al Jean thought that the premise sounded [...] "very funny" [...] and assigned Vitti to write the episode's first draft. Vitti wrote the script at his home and {{did not participate in}} any rewriting sessions with the other staff writers.

Producer and former showrunner Mike Reiss has stated that he thoroughly enjoyed working on [...] "Weekend at Burnsie's".

Some of the songs on Return to Base we thought were some of the best songs that we'd ever written.
