40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} method for fault {{detection}} and replacement of the sensor responsible by the measurement of the <b>burning</b> zone <b>temperature</b> in a rotary cement kiln. The control of the <b>burning</b> zone <b>temperature</b> is crucial for the control of kiln temperature and therefore for the con-trol of the cement quality, pollutant emissions, and con-sumed energy. However the flying dust within the kiln can block the pyrometer sensor, causing faults in the tempera-ture sensor. Exploring the analytical redundancy that usu-ally exist in industrial processes, the proposed methodol-ogy uses a neural network trained using an online sequen-tial extreme learning machine to online construct a model to estimate the <b>burning</b> zone <b>temperature.</b> Using the error between the measured and estimated temperatures, faults in the measurement can be detected and thus the replace-ment of the measured temperatures by the estimated out-put is made. ...|$|R

For such purpose, inert materials (e.g. clay, diatomaceous earth, alumina, silica, magnesium oxide, or others) or endothermically decomposing materials (e.g. carbonates) are added. Oxamide is used as a high performance burning rate suppressant in some propellant compositions. Strontium carbonate is used as a fire retardant in some gunpowders.|$|E

The change from conventional combustion of powdered North Bohemian brown coal to its combustion in fluidised bed boilers in several Czech power and heating plants calls for detailed mineralogical and geochemical characterisation of the {{combustion residues}}. The main differences between fly ashes from both combustion systems result from different <b>burning</b> <b>temperatures</b> and differing systems of desulphurisation (coeval with combustion / post-combustion).

40|$|Following on {{from the}} first publication, (12) {{concerning}} the burning of plastics, another 13 chemical pure polymers were burnt in an electric oven to determine the level of solid and gaseous air pollution caused by their stackgases. All 13 polymers are highly combustible but require different <b>burning</b> <b>temperatures</b> (300 - 900 degrees C) {{in order to be}} burnt completely (i. e. without ashrest). With the exception of PMMA and PTFE, all plastics leave a very heavy tar- and soot deposit after burning.

50|$|An {{important}} development during World War II was {{the addition}} of another explosive, nitroguanidine, to the mixture to form triple-base propellant or Cordite N and NQ. The formulations were slightly different for artillery and naval use. This solved two {{problems associated with the}} large naval guns fitted to British Navy's capital ships: gun flash and muzzle erosion. Nitroguanidine produces large amounts of nitrogen when heated, which had the benefit of reducing the muzzle flash, and its lower <b>burning</b> <b>temperature</b> greatly reduced the erosion of the gun barrel.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the later}} (1991) {{successful}} gun fuels was a saturated solution of ammonium perchlorate in ammonia. This has a vapor pressure of one atmosphere at 20C, and generally forms a convenient liquid that is stable and possible to handle. The mixture is notable for its low <b>burning</b> <b>temperature</b> per impetus, with resulting lowered damage to expensive gun tubes and liners, or alternatively, increased firing rates. A typical impetus is 388,000 ft-lb/lb. The ammonia vapors are toxic, but the toxicity is readily apparent to ordinary people and can be handled with normal industrial precautions.|$|E
5000|$|Vaporizers (vape pens and/or {{stationary}} platform) are devices used {{to extract}} the active ingredients of cannabis, tobacco (E-cigarettes) or any plant material at lower than <b>burning</b> <b>temperature,</b> eliminating carbon monoxide and carcinogenic [...] "tars" [...] found hazardous in smoke. 197 °C / 385 °F is frequently mentioned as a good vaporizing temperature for favored cannabinoids.

Ovis aries rib bones were burnt at different temperatures and for varying time intervals. Results of a linear regression analysis indicated that burn temperatures can be predicted with a standard error of ± 70 °C from defleshed bone spectra. Exposure time {{does not have a}} significant impact on prediction accuracy. The presence of soft tissue has a significant impact on heat-induced changes of the bone matrix in low (800 °C), slowing down combustion in the former and accelerating it in the latter (p < 0. 05).

5000|$|In the United States {{the most}} {{commonly}} used masonry lime is Type S hydrated lime which is intended to be added to Portland cement to improve plasticity, water retention and other qualities. The S in type S stands for special which distinguishes it from Type N hydrated lime where the N stands for normal. The special attributes of Type S are its [...] "...ability to develop high, early plasticity and higher water retentivity and by a limitation on its unhydrated oxide content." [...] The term Type S originated in 1946 in ASTM C 207 Hydrated Lime for Masonry Purposes. Type S lime is almost always dolomitic lime, hydrated under heat and pressure in an autoclave, and used in mortar, render, stucco, and plaster. Type S lime is not considered reliable as a pure binder in mortar due to high <b>burning</b> <b>temperatures</b> during production.|$|R
5000|$|As {{the mass}} of solid fuel is melted and consumed, the candle becomes shorter. Portions of the wick that are not {{emitting}} vaporized fuel are consumed in the flame. The incineration of the wick limits the exposed length of the wick, thus maintaining a constant <b>burning</b> <b>temperature</b> and rate of fuel consumption. Some wicks require regular trimming with scissors (or a specialized wick trimmer), usually to about one-quarter inch (~0.7 cm), to promote slower, steady burning, and also to prevent smoking. In early times, the wick needed to be trimmed quite frequently. Special candle-scissors, referred to as [...] "snuffers" [...] were produced for this purpose in the 20th century and were often combined with an extinguisher. In modern candles, the wick is constructed so that it curves over as it burns. This ensures {{that the end of}} the wick gets oxygen and is then consumed by fire—a self-trimming wick.|$|E
50|$|Matches, or {{separately}} lit {{slivers of}} wood are often considered preferable to lighters because of lower <b>burning</b> <b>temperature.</b> Butane lighters made specifically for pipes emit flame sideways or {{at an angle}} {{to make it easier to}} direct flame into the bowl. Torch-style lighters should never be used to light a pipe because their flames are too hot and can char the rim of the pipe bowl. Matches should be allowed to burn for several seconds to allow the sulfur from the tip to burn away and the match to produce a full flame. A naphtha fueled lighter should also be allowed to burn a few seconds to get rid of stray naphtha vapors that could give a foul taste to the smoke. When a flame has been produced, it is then moved in circles above the rim of the bowl while the smoker puffs to draw the flame down and light the tobacco. Packing method and humidity can affect how often a pipe must be relit.|$|E
50|$|Fire-resistant pits (FRP) are {{a safety}} feature of modern nuclear weapons, {{reducing}} plutonium dispersal {{in case of}} fire. The current pits are designed to contain molten plutonium in temperatures up to 1000 °C, the approximate temperature of a burning aircraft fuel, for several hours. Fire-resistant pits would be of no help in cases where pits were scattered around by an explosion; they are used therefore together with insensitive high explosives, which should be resistant to accidental detonation by impact or fire, and undetonable propellants when used in missiles. Vanadium cladding was tested for design of fire-resistant pits, but it is unknown {{if it is in}} use or only experimental. The W87 warhead {{is an example of a}} FRP-employing assembly. FRP does not, however, provide protection if the pit cladding is mechanically damaged, and may fail if subjected to missile fuel fire, which has a higher <b>burning</b> <b>temperature</b> (about 2000 °C) than does aircraft fuel. Severe weight and size constraints may preclude the use of both FRP and insensitive explosives. SLBMs, with their size considerations and more energetic and vulnerable fuel, tend to be less safe than ICBMs.|$|E

50|$|Carbondale {{takes its}} name from Carbondale, Pennsylvania, {{hometown}} of some of Carbondale's early settlers. Carbondale's economy was initially agriculturally based. Farmers and ranchers capitalized on open lands around Carbondale to supply food for miners in nearby Aspen, then a booming center of silver mining activity. Early in the 20th century, before the rise of industrial agriculture in Idaho, Carbondale's primary agricultural product was potatoes. The legacy lives on in Potato Day, an annual fall parade and cookout in Sopris Park. Despite the non-geologic origins of the town's name, the Carbondale area does in fact possess significant coal resources. Until the late 1980s Carbondale's economy was primarily based on coal operations up the Crystal River Valley. The coal mined from the area was favored for its high <b>burning</b> <b>temperature,</b> low sulphur content, and density. However, the coal deposits also contained significant amounts of methane gas. In 1981, a methane gas explosion killed 15 miners http://www.postindependent.com/article/20060416/VALLEYNEWS/104160006 and by 1991 the mines closed down permanently. The rise of Aspen as a skiing mecca and subsequent hyperinflation of its real estate prices has forced a majority of its workers downvalley to other towns like Carbondale. Thus, especially since the 1980s, Carbondale has partly served as a bedroom community to Aspen. More recently Carbondale has seen a boom of second-home construction, arts and recreational amenities, and tourism as the area's wealth and renown has grown. KDNK is an FM radio station licensed to Carbondale.|$|E

40|$|Material emitted as ejecta from ONe novae outbursts is {{observed}} {{to be rich}} in elements as heavy as Ca. The bottleneck for the synthesis of elements beyond sulphur is the (30) P(p,γ) (31) S reaction. Its reaction rate is, however, not well determined due to uncertainties in the properties of key resonances in the burning regime. In the present study, gamma-ray transitions are reported {{for the first time}} from all key states in (31) S relevant for the (30) P(p,γ) (31) S reaction. The spins and parity of these resonances have been deduced, and energies have been measured with the highest precision to date. The uncertainty in the estimated (30) P(p,γ) (31) S reaction rate has been drastically reduced. The rate using this new information is typically higher than previous estimates based on earlier experimental data, implying a higher flux of material processed to high-Z elements in novae, but it is in good agreement with predictions using the Hauser-Feshbach approach at higher <b>burning</b> <b>temperatures...</b>|$|R
