5|$|The three Canadian {{ships were}} used to {{transport}} troops back to Canada {{after the end of}} the war before <b>being</b> <b>broken</b> up in 1947. Most of the British ships were broken up around the same time, although one ship was sold to the Dominican Navy in 1949 and served until 1968.|$|E
5|$|With {{the end of}} the war in November 1918 and the {{dissolution}} of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Kronprinz Erzherzog Rudolf was transferred to the fledgling Royal Yugoslav Navy, who renamed her Kumbor. She remained in the Yugoslav inventory only briefly, <b>being</b> <b>broken</b> up for scrap in 1922.|$|E

50|$|The {{grounds of}} Buenavista are {{distinguished}} by <b>being</b> very <b>broken,</b> with {{a type of}} steep soil and steep slopes.|$|R
50|$|Struck in 1867, she {{was used}} as a coaling hulk in Brest before <b>being</b> {{eventually}} <b>broken</b> up in 1890.|$|R
5|$|A {{convenient}} {{means of}} determining {{the order of a}} given sigmatropic rearrangement is to number the atoms of the bond <b>being</b> <b>broken</b> as atom 1, and then count the atoms in each direction from the broken bond to the atoms that form the new σ-bond in the product, numbering consecutively. The numbers that correspond to the atoms forming the new bond are then separated by a comma and placed within brackets to create the sigmatropic reaction order descriptor.|$|E
5|$|After World War I, most battleships, {{dreadnought}} and pre-dreadnought alike, were disarmed {{under the}} terms of the Washington Naval Treaty. Largely this meant the ships <b>being</b> <b>broken</b> up for scrap; others were destroyed in target practice or relegated to training and supply duties. One, Mikasa, was given a special exemption to the Washington Treaty and was maintained as a museum and memorial ship.|$|E
5|$|Assiniboine {{returned}} to Canada in June and was briefly {{used as a}} troop transport before a boiler room fire on 4 July effectively ended her career. She was paid off on 8 August and placed on the disposal list. Whilst on tow to the breakers in Baltimore, she ran aground near East Point, Prince Edward Island. Attempts to get her off failed, and she was left to rust until eventually <b>being</b> <b>broken</b> up in place in 1952.|$|E
50|$|The site {{accident}} {{history was}} exceptionally safe {{with the worst}} injury <b>being</b> a <b>broken</b> ankle. A record was set of 2.4 million consecutive injury-free hours.|$|R
50|$|A young Padawan named Mace Windu {{was sent}} to Hurikane to {{negotiate}} with these beings and possibly obtain some of the crystals. After events went poorly, several of the native gave chase to Windu, resulting in Mace panicking and pushing them into a canyon. Having realized the error of his ways, the young Jedi apprentice healed the <b>being's</b> <b>broken</b> body by piecing it back together with the Force. In gratitude, Mace received some of the Hurrikaine crystals from the being's body, which he used to create his purple lightsaber blade.|$|R

5|$|Jean Bart was demilitarised {{and became}} a school hulk in Toulon in 1936. She {{remained}} there during World War II and was captured there on 27 November 1942, although she was not scuttled. She was used for experiments with large shaped charge warheads by the Germans until she was sunk by the Allies in 1944 before <b>being</b> <b>broken</b> up in place beginning on 14 December 1945.|$|E
5|$|Monument 3 {{is broken}} into various fragments, five {{of which were}} {{recovered}} from various locations in Ocosingo and Toniná {{through the course of}} the 20th century and most of which were reunited in the Toniná site museum. Aside from <b>being</b> <b>broken,</b> the stela is largely complete and only lightly eroded, it is a statue of a ruler with inscriptions describing the accession of K'inich Baaknal Chaak and the promotion to the priesthood of Aj Ch'aaj Naah.|$|E
5|$|Novara {{changed hands}} several times {{as the war}} ended, being {{transferred}} first to the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, a successor state to Austria-Hungary, and then to France as a war prize {{under the terms of}} the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye. Commissioned into the French fleet as Thionville, the ship served from 1920 to 1932 as a training ship, and from 1932 to 1941 as a barracks ship in Toulon before <b>being</b> <b>broken</b> up for scrap.|$|E

60|$|The {{ground at}} the spot <b>being</b> much <b>broken,</b> and affording {{facility}} for concealment, especially to men on foot, Eskiwin and Ali Bobo crept unseen upon a low cliff, and lay down behind a mass of rocks.|$|R
60|$|Arranging things {{according}} to directions, the Indian held the canoe steady while the brothers stepped carefully in--for {{they had learned}} from experience that the birch-bark canoe, besides <b>being</b> easily <b>broken,</b> is apt to overturn on small provocation.|$|R
5|$|Stela 3 {{is badly}} damaged, <b>being</b> <b>broken</b> into three pieces. It was found {{somewhere on the}} San Isidro Piedra Parada {{plantation}} although its exact original location is not known. It was moved to a museum in Guatemala City. The lower portion of the stela depicts two legs facing to the left standing upon a horizontal band divided into three sections, each section containing a symbol or glyph.|$|E
5|$|After the {{collapse}} {{of the power of the}} Howards, the county of Suffolk was controlled by an oligarchy of Protestant gentry by the 17th century and did not play a prominent part in the English Civil War that occurred between 1642–6. Framlingham Castle escaped the slighting that occurred to many other English castles around this time. Hitcham's bequest had meanwhile become entangled in the law courts and work did not begin on the poorhouse until the late 1650s, by which time the internal buildings of castle were <b>being</b> <b>broken</b> up for the value of their stone; the chapel had been destroyed in this way by 1657.|$|E
5|$|Castelfidardo {{participated in}} the Battle of Lissa during the Third Italian War of Independence in 1866. She was {{stationed}} in the van of the Italian fleet, which became separated {{from the rest of}} the fleet and was not heavily engaged. Her career was limited after the war, owing to the emergence of more modern ironclads and a severe reduction in the Italian naval budget following their defeat at Lissa. She was rebuilt as a central battery ship some time after Lissa, and was modernized several more times in the 1870s and 1880s. From 1900 to 1910 she served as a training ship before <b>being</b> <b>broken</b> up for scrap.|$|E
60|$|The ice of {{ceremony}} <b>being</b> once <b>broken,</b> {{it seemed}} matter of rivalry between the guest and the entertainer which should display the best appetite; {{and although the}} former had probably fasted longest, yet the hermit fairly surpassed him.|$|R
50|$|CPU shims are {{nowadays}} largely obsolete {{because most}} modern processors designed for home users since {{the introduction of}} the Athlon 64 and Pentium 4 have an Integrated Heat Spreader (IHS) which prevents the CPU core from <b>being</b> accidentally <b>broken.</b>|$|R
50|$|Love's Sacrifice is a Caroline era stage play, {{a tragedy}} written by John Ford, and first {{published}} in 1633. It is one of Ford's three surviving solo tragedies, the others <b>being</b> The <b>Broken</b> Heart and 'Tis Pity She's a Whore.|$|R
5|$|During World War I, Suwo {{served as}} the {{flagship}} for the Japanese squadron during the Battle of Tsingtao from 27 August to 7 November 1914. The ship served as flagship of the Second Squadron of the Second Fleet in 1915–16 before becoming a gunnery training ship {{for the rest of}} the war. In April 1922, in compliance with the Washington Naval Treaty, Suwo was disarmed at the Kure Naval Arsenal. While her armor was being removed, the ship capsized on 13 July. She was probably scrapped in 1922–23, but at least one source suggests she was refloated and hulked, serving until <b>being</b> <b>broken</b> up at Kure in 1946.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} the war, Z31 was {{transferred}} to Great Britain. Following testing in August 1945, she was passed on to France, being transferred to the French Navy at Cherbourg on 2 February 1946, and was commissioned as Marceau on 1 April. From 1948–1950, Marceau underwent a major refit, in which the forward 10.5cm gun was replaced by a 15.0cm gun, the ship's anti-aircraft outfit changed to eight Bofors 40 mm guns and US radar fitted. She went into reserve in 1953, and on 1 February 1954 was laid up as a hulk. She was stricken on 2 January 1958 and sold for scrap later that year, <b>being</b> <b>broken</b> up in the early 1960s.|$|E
5|$|In October 2007, Stuart {{was held}} in custody by Essex Police on {{suspicion}} of assault, in relation to an incident involving Chris Beardsley which resulted in Beardsley's jaw <b>being</b> <b>broken</b> in two places. The incident occurred during a match with York City on 22 September 2007. He was charged with grievous bodily harm in December 2007. He made a further 43 appearances for Grays during the season, failing to score. Following the departure of Stuart Thurgood to Gillingham in November 2007, Stuart was handed the captaincy {{for the remainder of}} the season, having previous served as vice-captain.|$|E
60|$|They {{walked on}} side by side. Will didn't feel like <b>being</b> rudely <b>broken</b> in {{on in this}} way. The two men were rivals, but Will, being the victor, would have been magnanimous, only {{he wanted to be}} alone with his lover's dream.|$|R
25|$|HMS Dart {{was one of}} two sloops {{built to}} an {{experimental}} design by Sir Samuel Bentham and launched in 1796. She served the Royal Navy during the French Revolutionary wars and {{the early part of the}} Napoleonic wars before <b>being</b> sold <b>broken</b> up in 1809.|$|R
50|$|The Yarmouth {{was broken}} up in 1707 and rebuilt {{according}} to the 1706 Establishment by John Wicker at his Deptford private shipyard, being re-launched on 9 September 1709. She served until 1740, when she was hulked at Portsmouth, <b>being</b> finally <b>broken</b> up in 1769.|$|R
5|$|Karlsruhe sank at 15:50; {{the rights}} to {{salvaging}} the ship were sold in 1962. She has not been raised for scrapping, however. Emden was boarded by British sailors who beached her before she could be completely sunk. After being refloated, she was ceded to France and used as a test ship for explosives before <b>being</b> <b>broken</b> up in 1926. Nürnberg was also beached by British sailors. She was eventually sunk off the Isle of Wight as a gunnery target. Königsberg was meanwhile stricken from the naval register on 20 July 1920 and ceded to France. She was renamed Metz and served with the French Navy until 1933. She was ultimately broken up for scrap in 1936.|$|E
5|$|Macdonald {{was content}} to lead the Conservatives in a relaxed manner in {{opposition}} and await Liberal mistakes. He took long holidays and resumed his law practice, moving his family to Toronto and going into partnership with his son Hugh John. One mistake that Macdonald believed the Liberals had made was a free-trade agreement with Washington, negotiated in 1874; Macdonald {{had come to believe}} that protection was necessary to build Canadian industry. The Panic of 1873 had led to a worldwide depression; the Liberals found it difficult to finance the railroad in such a climate, and were generally opposed to the line anyway—the slow pace of construction led to British Columbia claims that the agreement under which it had entered Confederation was in jeopardy of <b>being</b> <b>broken.</b>|$|E
5|$|Players {{are often}} awarded after record-breaking or near-record-breaking {{offensive}} seasons. Running back O. J. Simpson won {{the award for}} 1973 after rushing for a record 2,003 yards, becoming the first NFL player to rush for 2,000 yards in a season. When his record was broken by Eric Dickerson in 1984, Dickerson placed second in voting behind quarterback Dan Marino, who that year {{was the first to}} pass for 5,000 yards in a season. Marino's 5,084 yards stood as the record for 27 years before <b>being</b> <b>broken</b> by Drew Brees in 2011, who won that season's award. In turn, 2013 winner Peyton Manning set league single-season records for passing yards (5,477) and passing touchdowns (55).|$|E
50|$|She {{also held}} {{hearings}} on the seeming absence of toilet paper. She reported many parents' complaints about toilets <b>being</b> dirty, <b>broken,</b> or closed citywide and her own experience {{as a high school}} student with having to go across the street to a medical facility.|$|R
5000|$|The egg carton {{was invented}} in 1911 by {{newspaper}} editor Joseph Coyle of Smithers, British Columbia, to solve a dispute between a local farmer and hotel owner in Aldermere, near present day Telkwa, in British Columbia, over the farmer's eggs often <b>being</b> delivered <b>broken.</b>|$|R
50|$|HDMS Friderichssteen or HMS Frederichsteen was a Danish Navy frigate, {{built in}} 1800, and {{captured}} by the Royal Navy in 1807 at the Battle of Copenhagen.
