50|$|The styling was {{radical and}} upright forks {{and a short}} engine contributed to a stubby {{wheelbase}} on a bike that was rather tall. The CX500 {{was one of the}} first recipients of Honda's new Comstar wheels (and later, on B models, reverse Comstar and a square <b>brake</b> <b>fluid</b> <b>reservoir),</b> which measured 19 in in front and 16 in at the back.|$|E
5000|$|The 1978 CX500 Standard {{had a large}} fuel tank, stepped seat, a round <b>brake</b> <b>fluid</b> <b>reservoir</b> and {{a plastic}} mini-fairing that was thought to look unusual at the time, and gave the bike the {{nickname}} [...] "plastic maggot". Turn signals extend out through the mini fairing from the headlight's centerline. The CX500 Standard had silver Comstar wheels, 19 inch in front and 18 inch in the rear.|$|E
40|$|An {{inertial}} {{energy storage}} device is disclosed which uses flywheel made of flexible material {{such as a}} twisted rope ring. A small number of the strands of the rope ring have a tensile strength that is {{lower than that of}} most of the other strands so that should any of these strands fail, they will begin to whiplash allowing such a failure to be detected and braked before a castastrophic failure occurs. This accomplished by the inclusion of glass tubes located around the periphery of the flywheel. The tubes are in communication with a <b>braking</b> <b>fluid</b> <b>reservoir.</b> The flywheel and glass tubes are enclosed within a vacuum-tight housing. The whiplashing of a broken strand breaks one or more glass tubes. This causes the housing to be flooded with the <b>braking</b> <b>fluid</b> thereby <b>braking</b> the rotation of the flywheel...|$|R

50|$|In a {{hydraulic}} brake system, when the brake pedal is pressed, a pushrod exerts {{force on the}} piston(s) in the master cylinder, causing fluid from the <b>brake</b> <b>fluid</b> <b>reservoir</b> to flow into a pressure chamber through a compensating port. This results {{in an increase in}} the pressure of the entire hydraulic system, forcing fluid through the hydraulic lines toward one or more calipers where it acts upon one or more caliper pistons sealed by one or more seated O-rings (which prevent leakage of the fluid).|$|E

5000|$|In December 2010, certain 2005-2007 model Acura RLs {{were subject}} to a safety recall for {{potential}} leaking of the brake master cylinder seal. [...] A seal in the brake master cylinder may be susceptible to damage following the use of brake fluid other than the recommended Acura or (Honda) Genuine DOT3 brake fluid. If the seal is damaged, it {{can result in a}} brake fluid leak under certain conditions. If a leak should occur, the driver might see a low brake fluid indicator light or a BRAKE FLUID LOW or CHECK BRAKE SYSTEM message. If the driver continues to drive the vehicle after receiving this message without refilling the <b>brake</b> <b>fluid</b> <b>reservoir,</b> it could result in a brake pedal that feels soft or spongy, and may eventually affect braking performance, increasing the risk of a crash. Affected vehicles were to be inspected and repaired, as applicable, at no charge. Reportedly, this recall applied to both 2005-2007 Acura RL and 2005-2007 Honda Odyssey models.|$|E
50|$|When a skid developed, {{the wheel}} would stop, {{stopping}} the drum along with it. The flywheel, {{driven by the}} one-way clutch, continued to spin. If the relative angle between the drum and flywheel reached 60 degrees, the drum would be driven forward to press on a valve. This released <b>brake</b> <b>fluid</b> into a <b>reservoir,</b> lowering hydraulic pressure, and releasing the brakes. As soon as the drum started spinning again and reached the (slowing) speed of the flywheel, the valve was released and the brakes re-applied. The system could cycle about ten times a second, and could hold the brakes off for up to four seconds in total before the reservoir filled.|$|R
50|$|The Twingo III {{is about}} 100 mm {{shorter than the}} Twingo II. The rear-engine layout {{improves}} the manoeuvrability and the cabin space, but reduced the boot capacity. The suspension is composed by MacPherson struts on the front axle and a De Dion tube on the rear. The car uses a five-door architecture, which differs it from its three-door predecessors. Brakes are ventilated disks {{on the front and}} drums on the rear, except in the base model (SCe 70) which uses drum brakes all-round. The bonnet features a special opening mechanism and allows only partial opening to give access to the windscreen washer <b>fluid,</b> <b>brake</b> <b>fluid</b> and coolant <b>reservoirs,</b> and to the battery.|$|R

5000|$|Unlike {{polyethylene}} glycol based fluids, Dot 5 is hydrophobic. An advantage over {{other forms of}} <b>brake</b> <b>fluid</b> is that silicone has a more stable viscosity index over a wider temperature range.

50|$|The {{hydraulic}} {{braking system}} is designed as a closed system: {{unless there is a}} leak in the system, none of the <b>brake</b> <b>fluid</b> enters or leaves it, nor does the fluid get consumed through use. Leakage may happen, however, from cracks in the O-rings or from a puncture in the brake line. Cracks can form if two types of <b>brake</b> <b>fluid</b> are mixed or if the <b>brake</b> <b>fluid</b> becomes contaminated with water, alcohol, antifreeze, or any number of other liquids.|$|R

40|$|Abstract‘Turbo Braking Assists’ (TBA) {{employs the}} {{principles}} of turbo machinery and automotive engineering {{in order to achieve}} effective braking assistance for the modern day disc as well as drum brakes. These brakes are intended for the purpose of braking assists during high speed motion. The major components include a turbine or rotor, pump, nozzle, enlarged <b>brake</b> <b>fluid</b> chamber, DOT 5. 1 <b>braking</b> <b>fluid.</b> The functioning involves directing a jet of high velocity <b>brake</b> <b>fluid</b> (DOT 5. 1 in this case) at the blades of the rotor which is coupled with the wheel. The braking circuit is used as such with the enlargement of the <b>brake</b> <b>fluid</b> chamber. A pump is added to the set up to enable increase of mass flow rate of fluid and also to ensure the continuity of fluid flow in the entire circuit. A speed sensor is integrated along with the circuit to activate the pump such that the braking assists are put to use only after a particular velocity is reached as braking assists are not necessary at lower speed...|$|R

5000|$|A small drop in <b>brake</b> <b>fluid</b> {{level in}} the master {{cylinder}} reservoir can be [...] "topped up" [...] but if the level consistently drops, the cause should be investigated and repaired. <b>Brake</b> <b>fluid</b> {{level in the}} master cylinder will drop as the linings (pads or shoes) wear and the calipers or wheel cylinders extend further to compensate. Overspill from pushing back pistons should be avoided, because glycol based fluid will quickly lift or strip paints and other coatings on contact (it can be removed by quickly washing with water, not wiping). <b>Brake</b> <b>fluid</b> level may also be low because of a leak, which {{could result in a}} loss of hydraulic pressure and consequently a significant loss of braking ability.
