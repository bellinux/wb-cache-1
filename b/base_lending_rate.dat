5000|$|Effective January 2, 2015, the <b>Base</b> <b>Lending</b> <b>Rate</b> (BLR) {{structure}} {{was replaced with}} a new Base Rate (BR) system. Under BR, which will now serve as the main reference rate for new retail floating rate loans, banks in Malaysia can determine their interest rate based on a formula set by Bank Negara, the Malaysian central bank.|$|E
5000|$|Eurocredits are short-to-medium-term loans of Eurocurrency {{extended}} by Eurobanks to corporations, sovereign governments, nonprime banks, or international organizations. The loans are denominated in currencies {{other than the}} home currency of the Eurobank. Because these loans are frequently too large for a single bank to handle, Eurobanks will band {{together to form a}} bank lending syndicate to share the risk.The credit risk on these loans is greater than on loans to other banks in the interbank market. Thus, the interest rate on Eurocredits must compensate the bank, or banking syndicate, for the added credit risk. On Eurocredits originating in London the <b>base</b> <b>lending</b> <b>rate</b> is LIBOR. The lending rate on these credits is stated as LIBOR +X percent, where X is the lending margin charged depending upon the creditworthiness of the borrower. Additionally, rollover pricing was created on Eurocredits so that Eurobanks do not end up paying more on Eurocurrency time deposits than they earn from the loans. Thus, a Eurocredit may be viewed as a series of short-term loans, where {{at the end of each}} time period (generally three or six months), the loan is rolled over and the <b>base</b> <b>lending</b> <b>rate</b> is repriced to current LIBOR over the next time interval of the loan.|$|E
50|$|In Malaysia, {{changes in}} the OPR trigger {{a chain of events}} that affect the <b>base</b> <b>lending</b> <b>rate</b> (BLR), {{short-term}} interest rates, fixed deposit rate, foreign exchange rates, long-term interest rates, the amount of money and credit, and, ultimately, a range of economic variables, including employment, output, and prices of goods and services which is the micro and macro factors on the economic. The new base rate (BR) framework encourages greater transparency from banks and will enable customers to make better financial decisions. Previously, calculations of BLR lacked transparency and some banks were lending below the BLR to attract customers and boost loan growth. Under the new system, customers cannot borrow below the base rate. The BLR is usually adjusted at the time in correlation to the adjustments of the OPR which is determined by Bank Negara Malaysia during one its monetary policy meetings.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} bank <b>lending</b> <b>rates</b> and their cost of funds in New Zealand. Our results show that on average mortgage rates respond more quickly {{to changes in the}} cost of funds than <b>base</b> business <b>lending</b> <b>rates.</b> We also find an asymmetry in the initial (short-run) response of banks to changes in funding costs; in particular, our results show banks adjust mortgage rates downwards faster than upwards. The speed to which <b>lending</b> <b>rates</b> revert back to their equilibrium relationship with funding costs varies across the lending markets. We find the adjustment speed is faster when mortgage rates are below equilibrium, whereas it is slower when business <b>lending</b> <b>rates</b> are above long-run levels in relation to funding costs. Our analysis suggests that banks prefer the plain-vanilla type of lending such as mortgages in comparison to small business lending consistent with asymmetric information associated with business loans. <b>Lending</b> <b>rate</b> Cost of funds Small and medium enterprises Information asymmetry Error-correction models...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} to examine the {{relationship}} of Malaysia‟s <b>lending</b> interest <b>rate</b> with other countries which include China, Singapore, United States, Indonesia and Thailand. Those five countries are Malaysia‟s major trading partners. The daily <b>base</b> <b>lending</b> interest <b>rates</b> from 2006 to 2014 were applied to this study. The associations of the interest rates were tested by coefficient correlation and multivariate regression analysis. Results showed that Malaysian <b>lending</b> interest <b>rate</b> is significant and positively related to those of China, Thailand and the United States. Among the five countries‟ interest rates, only the changes in interest rates of China, Thailand and the United States would affect Malaysia‟s <b>lending</b> <b>rate.</b> The independence of monetary policy would hardly be expected by the Malaysian authority, Bank Negara, in its decision on <b>lending</b> interest <b>rate.</b> In addition, it may affect the trade finance and money market hedge decisions by the international traders.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} impact of {{interest}} rate changes on the demand for Islamic financing in a dual banking system where Islamic financing is dominated by Bai Bithamin Ajil (BBA) asset financing which replicate conventional bank loans. Using monthly data from 1999 to 2007, {{the study found that}} Islamic residential property financing exhibits a positive and fairly significant response to a shock in conventional residential property loans. This would imply a substitution effect. However, the response is not immediate and takes place only after one month. A possible explanation for this slow reaction is that, because BBA financing rate is fixed customers need time to reach a decision on whether or not to obtain financing from the Islamic bank based on their expectations of future interest rates movements. It is also found that unlike conventional bank residential property loans, Islamic residential property financing seems to respond more readily to a shock in the BLR. This again suggests that given the fixed rate of BBA financing, any change in the <b>base</b> <b>lending</b> <b>rate</b> would influence customers’ decision in obtaining Islamic bank asset financing. Overall, the study concludes that the structural weakness of the fixed BBA mechanism exposes Islamic banks in a dual system to risks of interest rate movements. This study therefore proposes that Islamic banks detach themselves from fixed rate instruments and move into more profit sharing financing. A viable alternative would be the property financing facility under musyarakah mutanaqisah...|$|E
40|$|This study {{attempts}} to restructure a more innovative Sharia compliant product in Islamic home financing. By examining {{the components of}} residential rental index and addressing some unresolved issues particularly in Musyarakah Mutanaqisah, the study seeks to propose rental index as an alternative benchmark to current interest rates. This paper employs library research derived from the pedigree of Islamic home financing. However, some mathematical modelings are employed to strengthen the analysis. The paper proposes a new structure of rental rate as a benchmark instead of the conventional interest rate in pricing of loans. This structure comprises of Islamic rental rates, risk premium, overhead expenses and profit margin. Our findings suggest that these components are better-able to capture the market conditions {{as compared to the}} element of interest in BLR (<b>Base</b> <b>Lending</b> <b>Rate)</b> as practiced by banking industry. This paper also recommends the solution for default payment {{and at the same time}} addresses inconsistencies of MM contract offered by Islamic banks. Since rental index is regarded as new approach in Islamic home financing, this study limits its scope with one contract namely musharakah mutanaqishah. This limitation might wreak different views from industries for implementation and thus needs to be further tested. The findings also reveal some future challenges in applying more innovative Sharia compliant approach since up to date, there are no general consensus derived from different schools of thought in resolving the issues of pricing in Islamic home financing. Islamic banks might be resistant in accepting this newly proposed structure of rental rate since it generates lesser amount of profits...|$|E
