5000|$|A blowoff valve, (sometimes [...] "hooter valve" [...] or BOV) {{performs}} the same task but releases the {{air into the}} atmosphere instead of recirculating it. This type of valve is typically an aftermarket modification. The blowoff action produces a range of distinctive hissing sounds, depending on the exit design. Some <b>blowoff</b> <b>valves</b> are sold with a trumpet-shaped exit that intentionally amplifies the sound. Some turbocharged vehicle owners may purchase a blowoff valve solely for the auditory effect even when the function is not required by normal engine operation. Motor sports governed by the FIA have made it illegal to vent unmuffled <b>blowoff</b> <b>valves</b> to the atmosphere.|$|E
50|$|This {{pressure}} wave can cause major problems, from {{noise and vibration}} to pipe collapse. It is possible to reduce {{the effects of the}} water hammer pulses with accumulators, expansion tanks, surge tanks, <b>blowoff</b> <b>valves,</b> and other features.|$|E
50|$|The engine has a 14-stage axial-flow compressor, {{producing}} compression ratios between 9:1 to 13:1 {{depending on}} altitude, also controlled by variable {{inlet guide vanes}} and <b>blowoff</b> <b>valves.</b> The combustion system used is a cannular-type: each flame tube is centrally mounted on a downstream injector that ends in an annular secondary region. The contra-rotating propellers and compressor are driven by the five-stage axial turbine. Mass flow is 65 kg (143 lb) per second.|$|E
50|$|A <b>blowoff</b> <b>valve</b> is {{connected}} by a vacuum hose to the intake manifold after the throttle plate. When the throttle is closed, the relative manifold pressure drops below atmospheric pressure and the resulting pressure differential operates the <b>blowoff</b> <b>valve's</b> piston. The excess pressure from the turbocharger is then vented into the atmosphere or recirculated into the intake upstream of the compressor inlet.|$|R
5000|$|An {{alternative}} method for utilizing both a MAF and a <b>blowoff</b> <b>valve</b> {{is to have}} the MAF located down stream between the intercooler and the throttle plate. This is known as Blow-through rather than the traditional Draw-through set up. Care must be taken as to the position of the MAF to prevent damage to the sensitive element. For example, on a SR20DET engine, the MAF must be at least 12" [...] from the throttle plate, and the <b>blowoff</b> <b>valve</b> must be 6" [...] from the MAF sensor. By using a blow-through method, the MAF won't be affected by the <b>blowoff</b> <b>valve</b> opening as the pressure is vented before the air reaches the MAF.|$|R
50|$|A <b>blowoff</b> <b>valve</b> (BOV), {{dump valve}} or {{compressor}} bypass valve (CBV) is a pressure release system present in most turbocharged engines.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Blowoff</b> <b>valves</b> {{are used}} to prevent {{compressor}} surge, a phenomenon that readily occurs when lifting off the throttle of an unvented, turbocharged engine. The sound produced is called turbo flutter ( [...] the slang term ' choo-choo' is sometimes used [...] ). When the throttle plate on a turbocharged engine closes, the high pressure air in the intake system is trapped by the throttle and a pressure wave is forced back into the compressor. The compressor wheel slows rapidly and can sometimes stall, and the driver will notice a fluttering air sound. The effect is similar to how planes' wings stall if not enough air is flowing past them. The rapid slowing or stalling stresses the turbo compressor and can impart severe turbo lag depending on how fast the driver accelerates immediately after the surge event and how much psi the turbocharger is set up for.|$|E

5000|$|... #Caption: A typical piston-type dump valve, used in auto racing. Unlike a <b>blowoff</b> <b>valve,</b> {{this one}} does not vent to the atmosphere. The small hose at the top is a feed from the intake manifold.|$|R
50|$|Some {{military}} diving rebreathers have a diffuser {{over the}} <b>blowoff</b> <b>valve,</b> which helps {{to conceal the}} diver's presence by masking the release of bubbles, by breaking them up to sizes which are less easily detected. A diffuser also reduces bubble noise.|$|R
50|$|In {{the case}} where a mass airflow sensor (MAF) is used and is located {{upstream}} from the <b>blowoff</b> <b>valve,</b> the engine control unit (ECU) will inject excess fuel because the atmospherically vented air is not subtracted from the intake charge measurements. The engine then briefly operates with a fuel-rich mixture after each valve actuation.|$|R
5000|$|In 2012, a [...] "Technical Update" [...] {{was applied}} to the N63, {{resulting}} in the N63TU variants (also known as N63B44O1). The main upgrade was the addition of Valvetronic. Other changes include revised turbochargers, removal of the <b>blowoff</b> <b>valve,</b> lighter pistons, forged conrods and crankshaft, addition of an oil catch can system, revised fuel system and addition of a second coolant pump.|$|R
50|$|On {{turbocharged}} {{internal combustion}} engines, a fluid hammer {{can take place}} when the throttle is closed while the turbocharger is forcing air into the engine. A pressure relief valve placed before the throttle prevents the air from surging against the throttle body by diverting it elsewhere, thus protecting the turbocharger from pressure damage. This valve can either recirculate the air into the turbocharger's intake (recirculation valve), or it can blow the air into the atmosphere and produce the distinctive hiss-flutter of an aftermarket turbocharger (<b>blowoff</b> <b>valve).</b>|$|R
25|$|The GT-EX {{replaced}} the discontinued GT-R with a turbocharged engine, the L20ET. As {{installed in the}} recently renewed Nissan Cedric/Gloria, this {{had been the first}} turbo engine to power a Japanese production vehicle. One notable aspect of the turbo versions was that they were not intercooled and there was no form of <b>blowoff</b> <b>valve,</b> only an emergency pressure release valve. As usual with Japanese cars of this period, there were four- or five-speed manuals and a three-speed automatic, with a column-shifted three-speed manual available on lower end cars and vans.|$|R
50|$|There {{are other}} {{outdated}} methods of boost control, such as intake restriction or bleed off. For instance, {{it is possible}} to install a large butterfly valve in the intake to restrict airflow as desired boost is approached. It is also possible to actually release large amounts of already compressed air similar to a <b>blowoff</b> <b>valve</b> but on a constant basis to maintain desired boost at the intake manifold. The currently popular exhaust gas bypass via wastegate is quite superior if compared to creating intake restriction or wasting energy by releasing air that has already been compressed. These methods are rarely used in modern system due to the large sacrifices in efficiency, heat, and reliability.|$|R
5|$|Forsythe Racing {{teammates}} Tagliani and Carpentier rounded {{out the top}} ten qualifiers; Carpentier was {{hampered by}} an electrical problem which overheated his engine {{and was unable to}} improve his time when his <b>blowoff</b> <b>valve</b> opened {{between the first and second}} turns. Adrián Fernández was the fastest driver not to qualify in the top ten; his best lap time was more than two-tenths of a second slower than Bräck. Fittipaldi's car developed a large amount of oversteer and reduced his pace in turn four and he took 12th. Jimmy Vasser and Oriol Servià took the 13th and 14th positions; Servià's car had oversteer after his first timed lap and drove into the pit lane where his crew made adjustments allowing him to drive faster for his second attempt. Nakano, 15th, had a large amount of understeer which slowed him in turn four. Dixon moved from his back-up car to his primary vehicle for qualifying and took 16th. Manning worked on his race setup but gearbox issues before the session prevented his team from focusing on a qualifying tune and he qualified in 17th. Mario Domínguez and Jourdain completed the qualifiers; Jourdain reduced his speed through the third and fourth turns after he oversteered and his slower pace prevented him from spinning.|$|R
