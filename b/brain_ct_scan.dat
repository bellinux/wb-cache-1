A second seizure occurred 16 months later at age 5 years and 6 months. At around 10 in the morning he walked into lounge looking pale and irritable. He fell to the floor and developed writhing movements, shaking arms and legs, hypersalivation and incontinence of urine. Convulsions stopped 15 min later with rectal diazepam. He recovered but remained very sleepy. He was febrile ~38.5°C. He was treated in a major teaching hospital with triple therapy for suspected encephalitis but in the third day after admission this was stopped and he was discharged home. <b>Brain</b> <b>CT</b> <b>scan,</b> EEG and CSF were normal.

40|$|Background: Head {{trauma is}} one of the most common reasons for {{emergency}} department (ED) care. Over the past decade, initial management strategies in mild and moderate head trauma have become focused on selective computed tomography (CT) use based upon presence or absence of specific aspects of patient history and/or clinical examination which has received more attention following reports of increased cancer risk from <b>CT</b> <b>scans.</b> Recently changes in serum brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels following head trauma have been studied. We investigated the changes in serum levels of BNP in patients with mild and moderate head trauma, in whom the first <b>brain</b> <b>CT</b> <b>scanning</b> was normal. Materials and Methods: This study is a cross-sectional, descriptive research. It was performed in patients with mild and moderate head trauma. Forty-one patients with isolated mild and moderate traumatic brain injury (Glasgow Coma Scale = 9 – 15) were included. First <b>brain</b> <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> were obtained during 2 h after ED arrival and the second one after 24 h. Plasma BNP levels were determined using a specific immunoassay system. Results: Twenty-three patients were in Group A (with normal first and second <b>brain</b> <b>CT)</b> and 18 patients in Group B (with normal first and abnormal second <b>brain</b> <b>CT).</b> With P = 0. 001, serum BNP level = 9. 04 was determined for differentiating two groups.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Minor {{head injury}} {{is the most}} common type of head injury. Despite its high {{prevalence}} and a lot of studies, there is much controversies about the management of these patients. We performed this study to find indications for <b>brain</b> <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> according to clinical signs and symptoms. &# 13; METHODS: We did this prospective cohort study in two university hospitals (Alzahra and Kashani) for one year enrolling 682 consecutive patients with minor head injury (GCS = 15) and recording all clinical signs and symptoms to find which could be used as predictors for brain injuries. X 2 and logistic regression with 95 % confidence interval were used for analysis. &# 13; RESULTS: Of 682 patients, 46 (6. 7 %) had brain injuries in CT scan. All patients with abnormal CT scans had at least one of the following risk factors: post traumatic amnesia, post traumatic unconsciousness, post traumatic seizure, headache, confusion, vomiting, focal neurological deficit, skull fracture, coagulopathy or history of taking anticoagulants and age more then 60 years. We didn't find any abnormality in <b>brain</b> <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> of patients who did not have any of these factors on admission. Confusion, Vomiting, skull fracture and age > 60 years had significant correlation with brain injuries. We also found those patients who had more than one risk factor had more abnormalities in CT scan. &# 13; CONCLUSION: Not all patients with minor head injury need <b>brain</b> <b>CT</b> <b>scan.</b> Clinical factors can be used as indications for <b>brain</b> <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> in these patients. &# 13; KEY WORDS: minor head injury, <b>brain</b> <b>CT</b> <b>scan...</b>|$|E
40|$|There {{is still}} a {{controversy}} among the neurologists whether <b>brain</b> <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> must be performed on the mild head trauma patients. This study was executed {{to find out the}} correlation between the <b>brain</b> <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> image findings and its clinical impairment among the mild head trauma patients with Glasgow coma scale (GCS) score of 13 to 15. The study was a retrospective study by analyzing the uniform medical records of the head trauma patients hospitalized at the Neurology ward of Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital within the period of 1999 to 2001. During that period 1, 663 patients were hospitalized due to head trauma, and 1, 166 of them (70. 1 %) were suffered from mild head trauma patients with GCS score of 13 - 15. Among those with <b>brain</b> <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> examinations (N: 271), the neurological abnormalities were found on 144 (53. 1 %) of patients, consisted of cerebral edema (11, 4 %), intracerebral hemorrhage (5. 5 %), epidural hemorrhage (16. 2 %), subdural hemorrhage (18. 1 %), subarachnoid hemorrhage (5. 5 %), and combination (13. 8 %). The further analysis showed that cranial nerves disturbance, amnesia, loss of conciousness for more than 10 minutes, and vomiting are significantly correlated to the <b>brain</b> <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> abnormality. Combination of the above four clinical signs and symptoms have sensitivity of 90 % in predicting brain insults. This findings may be used as a simple set of clinical criteria for identifying mild head trauma patients who need undergo CT scan examination.

40|$|Objective　To {{compare the}} brain {{protection}} effect of unilateral and bilateral selective cerebral perfusion (SCP) techniques in patients undergoing total aortic arch replacement for DeBakey type Ⅰ aortic dissecting aneurysm. Methods　Twentyfour patients from Dec. 2013 to Dec. 2014 in General Hospital of PLA who underwent total aortic arch replacement {{were divided into}} two groups: unilateral SCP group (USCP group, n= 16) and bilateral SCP group (BSCP group, n= 8), according to different brain protective techniques applied during deep hypothermia and circulatory arrest. Preoperative and postoperative neurological examinations and <b>brain</b> <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> were performed in two groups. During the operation, the cerebral oxygen saturation of patients was continuously monitored. The occurrence of postoperative temporary neurological dysfunction (TND) of all patients was observed and recorded. Results　After the operation, all patients recovered smoothly. Three patients suffered from postoperative TND in the USCP group and 1 patient in the BSCP group. Preoperative and postoperative <b>brain</b> <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> showed no significant difference between two groups. Also there was no intergroup difference in the cerebral oxygen saturation of patients (P> 0. 05). Conclusion　 In the surgery of total aortic arch replacement, the technique for unilateral selective cerebral perfusion is easy to perform, feasible, and effective on the protection of the brain in patients suffering from DeBakey type I aortic dissecting aneurysm.

40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} the number of brain CT scans carried out in patients with mild head injury (MHI) during 13 months of trauma registry, and to investigate means of reducing the rate of unnecessary scans. Methods: During a trauma registry (from August 23, 1999 to September 21, 2000) in 6 general Hospitals (Imam Hussein, Moayer, Sina, Hafteteer, Imam Khomeini and Shariatti) in Tehran, Iran, 1209 cases with Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score > 13 underwent <b>brain</b> <b>CT</b> <b>scan.</b> To be included in the study, patients must have sustained their injury within one week prior to presentation to Emergency Rooms, and were hospitalized for more than 24 hours. The attending physicians formally reported all <b>brain</b> <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> findings. Results: For 1209 patients, there were the following characteristics: mean age was 29. 4 years; the main cause of injury was traffic accidents (60. 1 %), followed by falls (28. 5 %), fights (7. 2 %), and other reasons (4. 2 %). Seventyseven cases (6. 4 %) had a GCS score of 13, 212 (17. 5 %) had a score of 14, and 920 (76 %) had a score of 15. A total of 481 abnormalities on CT scan were reported for 405 patients (33. 5 %) with positive report of <b>brain</b> <b>CT</b> <b>scan,</b> while 804 cases (66. 5 %) did not report abnormalities. The most common intracranial lesion was epidural hemorrhage with 146 cases (30. 3 %). The rate of negative reporting of <b>brain</b> <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> in patients who had GCS score of 15 was 72. 2 %. Conclusion: Patients who have GCS score of 13 or 14 on admission should be considered to have a moderate rather than a mild head injury.
