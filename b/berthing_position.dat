40|$|The task of {{capturing}} a space target using a space robot carrying robotic manipulators {{can be divided}} into two phases: controlling the robot to reach a desired <b>berth</b> <b>position</b> near the floating target, and manipulating the manipulator to grasp the target. Most of the existing planning strategies only focus on a point-to-point trajectory planning of the manipulator to ensure the end-effector to reach adesired pose, while the <b>berth</b> <b>position</b> is usually set manually. In this paper, we propose an optimal coordinated planning strategy for space robots to grasp targets. Both the manipulator’s joint trajectories and the robot’s <b>berth</b> <b>position</b> are considered to autonomously accomplish the coordinated planning of the end-effector and the robot base. From the perspective of the task-space constraints, the manipulator is first planned to satisfy the attitude constraints of the end-effector and base, and then the <b>berth</b> <b>position</b> is planned to meet the end-effector’s position. A Modified Generalized Jacobian Matrix (MGJM) is proposed to describe the velocity mapping from the joint space to the attitude of the end effector and the base. Based on the MGJM and Particle Swarm Optimization [18] (PSO), the whole planning task is turned to optimize the joint trajectories and the <b>berth</b> <b>position.</b> Simulated experiments have verified that the proposed planning strategy can successfully automate the two phases of a space robot to grasp target in the space...|$|R
40|$|Too little {{attention}} has been given to container transshipment issues when new container terminals are being planned or existing ones are being enlarged or reorganized. Container transshipment accounts for a substantial and often a dominant fraction of the total container traffic in major international ports. Transfer containers have different needs than those who originate or terminate their sea travel at the port in question; they use the port to transfer from one mode of transportation to another with a temporarily limited storage in the marshalling area. Various configurations of container terminals will serve one type of containers better than the other. This research studies the standard terminal configurations with respect to the handling operations of containers in the terminal, taking into account the size of the terminal in terms of <b>berth</b> <b>positions,</b> the assignment of ships to <b>berth</b> <b>positions,</b> the location of the marshalling area, the number of terminal vehicles, the assignment of the container handling jobs to vehicles, and the mix of the various segments of container traffic. A detailed simulation model was developed using 2 ̆ 7 AutoMod 2 ̆ 7 to compare the performance measure indicators presented in this research for the different terminal configurations.

40|$|In {{container}} terminal operations, {{the allocation of}} berth-side resources to serve calling vessels is called berth planning. For each vessel, berth planning generally involves determining the time interval for berth stay (i. e., berthing and departure times and the handling of start and end times), the <b>berthing</b> <b>position</b> along the quay, {{and the number of}} quay cranes that will be dedicated to handle it. The objectives are to maximize the vessel service levels (i. e., minimize the departure lateness) and minimize operating costs during a planning horizon. In this paper, we describe the implementation of an operations research-based solution at Shanghai Guandong International Container Terminal (SGICT), one of the largest {{container terminal}}s at the Port of Shanghai, to optimize its daily berth planning. We embed our solution into a decision support system (BAPOPT), which provides SGICT's planners with effective and executable berth plans. Using BAPOPT, SGICT expects to improve its vessel-handling productivity by at least 15 percent.

40|$|During the {{assembly}} flights of the Space Station Freedom (SSF), the Orbiter will either dock with the SSF and retract {{to the final}} <b>berthed</b> <b>position,</b> or will grapple the SSF using the Shuttle Remote Manipulator System (SRMS) and maneuver the SRMS coupled vehicles to their final <b>berthed</b> <b>position.</b> The SRMS method {{is expected to take}} approximately one to one and a half hours to complete and require periodic attitude corrections by either the Orbiter or the SSF reaction control system (RCS) or continuous control by a control moment gyro (CMG) system with RCS desaturation as required. Free drift of the attached vehicles is not currently thought to be acceptable because the desired system attitude will quickly deteriorate due to unbalanced gravity gradient and aerodynamic torques resulting in power generation problems, thermodynamic control problems, and communications problems. This paper deals with the simulation and control of the SRMS during trunnion/latch interaction dynamics and during RCS maneuvers. The SRMS servo drive joints have highly non-linear elastic characteristics which tend to degrade sensitive control strategies. In addition the system natural frequencies are extremely low and depend on the drive joint deflections and SRMS geometric position. The lowest mean period of oscillation for the Orbiter/SRMS/SSF(MB 6) system in brakes hold mode positioned near the final <b>berthed</b> <b>position</b> is approximately 120 seconds. A detailed finite element model of the SRMS has been developed and used in a newly developed SRMS systems dynamics simulation to investigate the non-linear transient response dynamics of the Orbiter/SRMS/SSF systems. The present SRMS control strategy of brakes only recommended by the Charles Draper Labs is contrasted with a robust controller developed by the authors. The robust controller uses an optimal inear quadratic regulator (LQR) to optimally place the closed-loop poles of a multivariable continuous-time system within the common region of an open sector with the sector angle plus or minus 45 degrees from the negative real axis, and the left-hand side of a parallel to the imaginary axis in the complex s-plane. This guarantees that the critical damping ratio for the desired control modes is equal to or in excess of 0. 707. The matrix sign function is used for solving the Riccati equations which appear in the controller design procedure. Fast and stable algorithms have recently been developed for the computation of the matrix sign function.

40|$|In {{order to}} solve the {{large-scale}} integral dynamic scheduling of continuous berths and quay cranes problem, a method based on rolling-horizon strategy is proposed. A multiobjective optimization model that is established minimizes the total penalty costs considering vessels’ deviations to their preferred <b>berthing</b> <b>positions,</b> delayed times for berthing comparing to their estimated arrival times, and delayed times for departure comparing to their estimated departure times. Then, the scheduling process was divided into a set of continual scheduling interval according to the dynamic arrival sequences.

The input parameters of the model in the next rolling window are updated according to the optimal results of each time window which have been obtained. The model is solved by choosing appropriate rolling and freezing window lengths that represents the numbers of adjacent vessels in the sequence of calling vessels. The holistic optimal solution is obtained by gradually rolling and combining the results of each window.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} allocating <b>berth</b> <b>positions</b> for vessels in tidal bulk port terminals. A berth {{is defined as a}} specific location alongside a quay where a ship loader is available for loading or unloading vessels, accommodating only one vessel at a time. In tidal ports, draft conditions depend on high tide conditions, since available depth at low tide is not adequate for the movement of ships. Some port terminals are associated with important transnational enterprises which maintain strong control over the stock level of their goods. Since the stock level sometimes depends on a continuous process of consumption or production of minerals, the decision to load or unload vessels must {{consider the}} amount of the bulk cargo stored in the port yards. Therefore, a basic criterion for decision making is to give priority to the vessels related to the most critical mineral stock level. A second basic criterion is to decide what sequence of vessels reduces the overall demurrage within a given planning horizon. This paper presents an integer linear programming model based on the transportation problem to represent the Berth Allocation Problem in Tidal Bulk ports with Stock level conditions (BAPTBS). Problem instances are solved by a commercial solver and by a Simulated Annealing-based algorithm (SA).

40|$|On a {{national}} level need has arisen for Turkey to realise a new large capacity gateway port. At the Black Sea coast in the province Zonguldak a flat area {{is available at the}} delta of the regional river Filyos. According to a previous feasibility study this location is considered optimal for the port. The extent of the captive area is promising. There is expected cargo transport demand from the metropolitan area of Ankara and of the planned local industry. Furthermore, the site conditions and possibility to connect with the hinterland are favourable at Filyos. The objective for the thesis study is to develop a port layout that offers capacity for the forecasted throughput at adequate operational conditions. To guarantee that the requirements with respect to operational conditions are met, several engineering solutions are implemented in the design. The operational conditions for merchant vessels depend to a large extent on the possibility to manoeuvre in the harbour and to load and unload at berth. These conditions are amongst others influenced by the climate of wind, waves and currents. Focus laid in this thesis study is on the wave climate in the harbour and at the berths. A well considered allocation, orientation and shape of the harbour entrance and berths is therefore essential. The other focus is laid on the dry infrastructure. Sufficient space for storage and through transport of cargo is required. Furthermore, advisory is needed with respect to the superstructures and the use of human resources. In order to design the port layout a thorough analysis is carried out in the thesis. The various boundary conditions for the project are analysed and reported. Amongst others, an overview is provided of socio-economic developments, hinterland connections and forecasts of throughput & vessel sizes for various scenarios. Furthermore, physical conditions are analysed, which are primarily based on obtained survey data. Where information about boundary conditions lacked, starting points are used of which a separate overview is provided. For the main requirements of the project an overview is made, which completes the boundary condition analysis. In order to develop the layouts, minimum component dimensions are required in combination with an overview of the preferred shape, orientation and location. For this purpose different design guidelines are followed. In order to derive required dimensions in time phasing of the project is chosen. Three significantly different alternatives are considered in the project including phasing for the medium term (until 2020) and long term (until 2030). These layouts are evaluated {{on the basis of the}} following requirements: nautical accessibility and safety, loading and unloading ability at berth, through transport and storage ability, robustness and coast morphological impact. The best layout is selected for further refinement on basis of a qualitative Multi-Criteria Evaluation (MCE) and on an analysis of capital costs. Costs have turned out to be decisive in the selection of the best alternative. The most promising alternative of the previous step is refined with respect to the inner harbour configuration. Different terminal and <b>berth</b> <b>positions</b> and orientations are considered, resulting in two variants of the layout alternative. The layouts are given a quantitative value with the use of an MCE, which are based on model simulations and engineering judgement. A coast morphological model (UNIBEST CL+) and a wave model (SWAN) have been setup for this purpose. Both the resulting values and estimated capital costs of the different layout variants turned out to be close to each other. The layout with the highest ratio of value over cost is selected as best.

On the one side, collaboration between port terminals and shipping liners can lead to costs savings and help achieve a sustainable supply chain, and on the other side, the optimization of operations and sailing times leads to reductions in bunker consumption and, thus, to fuel cost and air emissions reductions. To that effect, there is an increasing need to address the integration opportunities and environmental issues related to container shipping through optimization.
