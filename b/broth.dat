5|$|Louis Pasteur (1822–1895) exposed boiled broths to the air, in {{vessels that}} {{contained}} a filter to prevent particles from passing {{through to the}} growth medium, and also in vessels without a filter, but with air allowed in via a curved tube so dust particles would settle and not {{come in contact with}} the <b>broth.</b> By boiling the <b>broth</b> beforehand, Pasteur ensured that no microorganisms survived within the broths {{at the beginning of his}} experiment. Nothing grew in the broths in the course of Pasteur's experiment. This meant that the living organisms that grew in such broths came from outside, as spores on dust, rather than spontaneously generated within the <b>broth.</b> Thus, Pasteur dealt the death blow to the theory of spontaneous generation and supported the germ theory of disease.|$|E

40|$|The {{detection}} of thermonuclease by the Oxford strain and eight clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus {{in a variety}} of bacteriological <b>broths</b> with and without added blood was examined using a toluidine blue-DNA-agar plate method. In Isosensitest, brain-heart infusion, tryptic soy, nutrient and gas-liquid chromatography <b>broths</b> (all of which do not contain liquoid) thermonuclease detection was uncomplicated. In Bactec <b>broths</b> (containing liquoid) detectable thermonuclease activity was greatly reduced in the absence of blood. The addition of 10 % blood to the Bactec <b>broths</b> restored the activity. Liquoid was shown to be responsible for the inhibition of thermonuclease activity, and its effect could be neutralised by the addition of blood, albumin, or haemoglobin. In specimens containing no blood, or insufficient blood to neutralise the liquoid in culture <b>broths,</b> more has to be added to prevent false negative reporting of S aureus. This can be done after growth at the time of thermonuclease testing. Clinical consequences of delayed identification of S aureus in routine blood cultures may be serious. The application of the thermonuclease test to blood culture <b>broths</b> is both fast and specific...|$|R

He concluded that Reich's control measures to prevent infection from airborne bacteria were not as foolproof as Reich believed. Kreyberg accused Reich of being ignorant of basic bacteriological and anatomical facts, while Reich accused Kreyberg of having failed to recognize living cancer cells under magnification.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the most}} common {{constituents}} of a medieval meal, either as part of a banquet or as a small snack, were sops, pieces of bread with which a liquid like wine, soup, <b>broth,</b> or sauce could be soaked up and eaten. Another common sight at the medieval dinner table was the frumenty, a thick wheat porridge often boiled in a meat <b>broth</b> and seasoned with spices. Porridges were also made of every type of grain and could be served as desserts or dishes for the sick, if boiled in milk (or almond milk) and sweetened with sugar. Pies filled with meats, eggs, vegetables, or fruit were common throughout Europe, as were turnovers, fritters, doughnuts, and many similar pastries. By the Late Middle Ages biscuits (cookies in the U.S.) and especially wafers, eaten for dessert, had become high-prestige foods and came in many varieties. Grain, either as bread crumbs or flour, was also the most common thickener of soups and stews, alone or in combination with almond milk.|$|E
5|$|Qidra is a rice dish {{named after}} the clay vessel and oven it is baked in. Rice is cooked with pieces of meat inside of the vessel, often using lamb, whole garlic cloves, {{garbanzo}} beans, cardamom pods, and various other spices such as, turmeric, cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg and cumin. Plain rice cooked in meat or chicken <b>broth</b> and flavored with mild spices including cinnamon is known as fatteh ghazzawiyyeh. The rice is layered over a thin markook bread known as farasheeh, smothered in ghee and topped with stuffed chicken or lamb. The meal is eaten with green peppers and lemon sauce.|$|E
5|$|Coimbatore cuisine is {{predominantly}} south Indian with rice as its base. Most local restaurants still retain their rural flavor, with many restaurants serving food over a banana leaf. Eating on a banana leaf {{is an old}} custom and imparts a unique flavor to the food and is considered healthy. North Indian, Chinese and continental cuisines are also available. Idly, dosa, paniyaram and appam are popular dishes. Coimbatore has an active street food culture and various cuisine options for dining. Arisi Paruppu Sadam, made from a mixture of dal and rice is a recipe that existed from fourth century CE and unique to the area. Kaalaan is a popular dish prepared by simmering deep fried mushrooms (usually chopped mushroom) in a spicy <b>broth,</b> until it reaches a porridge like consistency and served sprinkled with chopped onions and coriander leaves.|$|E
25|$|Seafood is also popular, {{especially}} in coastal areas.

Some versions may use edible mushrooms such as porcini, wild herbs, and leaf vegetables/greens such as arugula, endive, mint, chard, chicory, dandelion greens, watercress, valerian and others. As the greens boil down, {{they contribute to}} the broth's flavor. The dish may be topped with a poached egg. Contemporary versions may be prepared in advance from {{a few hours to}} a day, stored in a cold place or refrigerated, and then reheated prior to serving. It can also be preserved by freezing.|$|E
5|$|In 1876, Robert Koch (1843–1910) {{established}} that microorganisms can cause disease. He {{found that the}} blood of cattle which were infected with anthrax always had large numbers of Bacillus anthracis. Koch found that he could transmit anthrax from one animal to another by taking {{a small sample of}} blood from the infected animal and injecting it into a healthy one, and this caused the healthy animal to become sick. He also found that he could grow the bacteria in a nutrient <b>broth,</b> then inject it into a healthy animal, and cause illness. Based on these experiments, he devised criteria for establishing a causal link between a microorganism and a disease and these are now known as Koch's postulates. Although these postulates cannot be applied in all cases, they do retain historical importance to the development of scientific thought and are still being used today.|$|E
5|$|Optimum {{growth of}} E. coli occurs at 37°C (98.6°F), but some {{laboratory}} strains can multiply at temperatures up to 49°C (120°F). E. coli {{grows in a}} variety of defined laboratory media, such as lysogeny <b>broth,</b> or any medium that contains glucose, ammonium phosphate, monobasic, sodium chloride, magnesium sulfate, potassium phosphate, dibasic, and water. Growth can be driven by aerobic or anaerobic respiration, using a large variety of redox pairs, including the oxidation of pyruvic acid, formic acid, hydrogen, and amino acids, and the reduction of substrates such as oxygen, nitrate, fumarate, dimethyl sulfoxide, and trimethylamine N-oxide. E. coli is classified as a facultative anaerobe. It uses oxygen when it is present and available. It can, however, continue to grow in the absence of oxygen using fermentation or anaerobic respiration. The ability to continue growing in the absence of oxygen is an advantage to bacteria because their survival is increased in environments where water predominates.|$|E

Manioc and green bananas are staples most commonly eaten when other more preferable foods are too expensive or out of season. The Antankarana were historically herders and although they are now generally agriculturalists, cattle are kept for milk. They are also viewed as a form of wealth; the number of cattle one gives away indicates generosity, and the number sacrificed to the ancestors is a measure of loyalty. The sacrifice of zebu is a typical element of many major rituals and celebrations ranging from Muslim holidays to life events like marriage, death and birth.|$|E
5|$|The black meat of a Silkie is {{generally}} considered an unusual attribute in European and American cuisines. In contrast, several Asian cuisines consider Silkie meat a gourmet food. Chinese cuisine especially values the breed, {{but it is also}} a common ingredient in some Japanese, Cambodian, Vietnamese and Korean dishes. Areas where Chinese cuisine has been a strong influence, such as Malaysia, may also cook Silkie. As early as the 7th century, traditional Chinese medicine has held that chicken soup made with Silkie meat is a curative food. The usual methods of cooking include using Silkie to make <b>broth,</b> braising, and in curries. Traditional Chinese soup made with Silkie also uses ingredients such as wolfberries, Dioscorea polystachya (mountain yam), orange peel, and fresh ginger. A few fusion restaurants in metropolitan areas of the West have also cooked it as a part of traditional American or French cuisine, such as in confit.|$|E
5|$|The {{stock is}} {{typically}} made by boiling meat, bones, or both. Beef, pork {{or a combination}} of both are most commonly used, with brisket, ribs, shank and chuck considered to give the most flavorful results, especially if cooked on a high flame. Marrow bones are considered best for the bone stock. Meat stock is usually cooked for about two hours, whereas bone stock takes four to six hours to prepare. Meat and bones are usually removed afterwards and the meat is only added back into the soup about 10–15 minutes before the borscht is done. Some recipes call for smoked meats, resulting in a distinctively smoky borscht, while others use poultry or mutton stock. Fasting varieties are typically made with fish stock to avoid the use of meat, while purely vegetarian recipes often substitute forest mushroom <b>broth</b> for the stock.|$|E

40|$|The {{detection}} of Listeria monocytogenes from food is currently carried out using a double enrichment. For the ISO methodology, this double enrichment {{is performed using}} Half-Fraser and Fraser <b>broths,</b> in which the overgrowth of Listeria innocua can occur in samples when both species are present. In this study, we analysed the induction of phage and phage tails of Listeria spp. in these media and in two BHI <b>broths</b> (Brain Heart Infusion) [BioMérieux (BHIM) and Biokar (BHIK) ] to identify putative effectors. It appears that Na 2 HPO 4 at concentrations ranging from 1 to 40 g/L with initial pH= 7. 5 can induce phage or phage tail production of Listeria spp., especially with 10 g/L of Na 2 HPO 4 and pH= 7. 5, conditions used in Half-Fraser and Fraser <b>broths.</b> An exposure to LiCl in BHIM (18 to 21 g/L) can also induce phage and phage tail release but in Half-Fraser and Fraser <b>broths,</b> the concentration of LiCl is much lower (3 g/L). Low phage titers were induced by acriflavine and/or nalidixic acid. We also show that the production of phages and phage tails can occur in Half-Fraser and Fraser <b>broths.</b> This study points out that induction of phages and phage tails could be triggered by compounds present in enrichment media.
