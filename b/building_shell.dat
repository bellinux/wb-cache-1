40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the {{effectiveness}} of using the program Epiqr in analysing the condition and shell renovation scenarios for apartment buildings. Epiqr has been developed {{as part of an}} EU research project in cooperation with a large group of experts from Switzerland, Germany, Denmark, the Netherlands, France, Great Britain and Greece, and research institutes working in the framework of the EU's Joule Programme. The thesis initially describes the state of apartment buildings in Slovenia through individual construction periods, the main features of the building techniques and the greatest shortcomings of the <b>building</b> <b>shells.</b> It also describes the most common interventions undertaken in building renovation. The second part presents the Epiqr program, why it has been developed, how data is entered and how it operates. In the review and operation of the programme, I have focused on elements of <b>building</b> <b>shells,</b> hence the description of measures for the renovation of the shells thereinafter. In {{the last part of the}} thesis, I present case studies on the use of Epiqr for assessing the condition of <b>building</b> <b>shells...</b>|$|R
50|$|Having {{faced the}} house towards the sun, high {{performance}} windows {{are used to}} draw in as much light and warmth as possible.

5000|$|In 1883 the {{building}} grounds were {{chosen as the}} site for Santa Fe's [...] "Tertio-Millennial" [...] celebration, and the <b>building</b> <b>shell</b> received a temporary roof. The grounds were cleared and an oval racetrack, about 1/3 mile long, was set up surrounding the site. Indian participants were housed in the first floor during the celebration.|$|E
50|$|Building {{began in}} the summer of 1961 on the Weltersbitz meadowlands. The {{cornerstone}} was laid on 1 October 1961. Until early 1962, the <b>building</b> <b>shell</b> was being put up. The topping-out ceremony was held on 17 May 1962. The consecration was finally done on 16 June 1963, although the first services had already been held the foregoing Christmas.|$|E
50|$|Following World War II, a {{new owner}} Mr Epps bought the House in 1954 and {{stripped}} its lead off the roof, leaving the <b>buildings</b> <b>shell</b> exposed. He was apparently {{able to sell}} the lead for {{more than he had}} bought the property for.|$|R
50|$|Arajuno {{was built}} by the Shell Oil Company as a base to conduct {{prospecting}} in the area. The company employed many Quechuas to build an airstrip and <b>buildings.</b> <b>Shell</b> abandoned Arajuno in 1948 when the company decided to discontinue its prospecting in Ecuador.|$|R
50|$|After World War II, a {{new owner}} bought the House, and {{stripped}} its lead off the roof, leaving the <b>buildings</b> <b>shell</b> exposed, {{because he was}} able to sell the lead for more than he had bought the property for, according to local legend.|$|R
50|$|The project entailed the {{complete}} demolition and {{reconstruction of the}} C, D, and E Rings {{in the area of}} the boundary between the recently renovated Wedge 1 and the unrenovated Wedge 2. Wedge 1 space would be fully rebuilt, while only the <b>building</b> <b>shell</b> would be rebuilt for Wedge 2. A full build-out for the Wedge 2 space would be completed at a later time.|$|E
50|$|Today’s bermed earth {{structures}} are built quite differently {{from those of}} the past. Common construction employs large amounts of steel reinforced concrete acting as structural support and <b>building</b> <b>shell.</b> Bulldozers or bobcats are used to pile earth around the building and on the roof instead of stacking earth in place. One modern example of bermed earth structures is the Hockerton Housing Project, a community of 5 homes in Nottinghamshire, England.|$|E
5000|$|The {{neighborhood}} was completely {{destroyed in the}} 1906 Earthquake and Fire (although miraculously, the area's skyscrapers survived). By 1910, the area was largely rebuilt with low-rise, masonry-clad buildings ranging from six to twelve stories in height. [...] During the late 1920s, several Neo-Gothic high rises, reaching three to four hundred feet in height, were constructed, including the Standard Oil Building, Russ Building, Hunter-Dulin <b>Building,</b> <b>Shell</b> Building, and the Pacific Telephone Building.|$|E
50|$|On Thursday the 16th of April 2015, {{the company}} Carbonell Figueres, which {{had won the}} tender in which 35 {{companies}} had participated, started the construction work on the new facility. This consisted of constructing the <b>building’s</b> <b>shell.</b> The cost is 2,727,331 €.|$|R

50|$|Using sprayed {{concrete}} construction, he creates <b>building</b> <b>shells</b> which encompass maximum {{space with a}} minimum of surface area, reducing the energy needed for heating. These constructions eschew right angles, and their spatial diversity overcomes the monotony of traditional designs. They recall Antoni Gaudí's organic forms as well as Jugendstil architecture.|$|R
50|$|The Shell Club - Previously {{known as}} Shell Senior Staff Club. It first {{operated}} under a thatched roof joint from mid 1957 — early 1958. By mid 1960, the club {{had moved into}} a new space which would become its permanent <b>building.</b> <b>Shell</b> Club is known to offer facilities for fitness, such as gym, swimming pools, and courts for racket sports. There are also a number of bars and restaurants serving at the complex.|$|E
50|$|CABS is {{only one}} {{designation}} for a facade concept that can been described by a range of different terms. Several variations on the term ‘adaptive’ can be used, including: active, advanced, dynamic, intelligent, interactive, kinetic, responsive, smart and switchable. In addition, the concepts of responsive architecture, kinetic architecture, intelligent building are closely related. The main difference with CABS is that the adaptation {{takes place at the}} <b>building</b> <b>shell</b> level, whereas the other concepts consider a whole-building approach.|$|E

50|$|Newgulf (or New Gulf) is an unincorporated {{community}} in Wharton County, Texas, United States. Newgulf, founded {{as a company}} town for Texas Gulf Sulphur Company, once boasted a population of over 1,500, but today {{is little more than}} a ghost town. Some downtown buildings remain as well as a few company houses, the country club clubhouse, and the massive twin smokestacks and <b>building</b> <b>shell</b> from the sulphur mine, which provide a glimpse of the town's history. Newgulf's functioning elementary school is part of the Boling Independent School District.|$|E
5000|$|The 1924 Arthur Barnett {{building}} {{designed by}} Edmund Anscombe was a landmark {{on the northern}} part of George Street, Dunedin. It was devastated by fire in 1959, with only the <b>building</b> <b>shell</b> and one major stained glass window surviving. It was rebuilt in 1960s modernist style behind the existing facades, the main retail floor being a soaring glass-roofed structure, inspiring the store's slogan of that era: [...] "the Daylight Store." [...] This was demolished progressively in 1995-7 and replaced by the Meridian Mall incorporating a reduced-size Arthur Barnett store across two levels.|$|E
50|$|Climate {{adaptive}} <b>building</b> <b>shell</b> (CABS) {{is a term}} {{in building}} engineering that describes the group of facades and roofs that interact with the variability in their environment in a dynamic way. Conventional buildings have static building envelopes, and can therefore not act in response to changing weather conditions and occupant requirements. Climate adaptive building shells, {{on the other hand}} do have the ability to change with time. Well-designed CABS have two main functions: they contribute to energy-saving for heating, cooling, ventilation and lighting; and they induce a positive impact on the indoor environmental quality of buildings.|$|E

50|$|From late 1987 to mid-1990, two {{buildings}} were constructed on the memorial's northern perimeter. The eastern of the {{two buildings}} was selected for the memorial's visitors center. The <b>building's</b> <b>shell</b> was sufficiently completed by September 1989 to allow construction to begin for {{the interior of the}} Visitors Center.

40|$|As {{opposed to}} {{traditional}} <b>building</b> <b>shells,</b> climate adaptive <b>building</b> <b>shells</b> (CABS) {{do have the}} ability to change their properties and behavior over time. Provided they are designed and operated effectively, CABS offer the potential for energy savings without the need for compromising comfort levels. This paper explores the role that building performance simulation (BPS) can play in designing CABS. After analyzing the distinguishing characteristics of CABS, the need for BPS is introduced. The potential role of BPS is then illustrated via the case study of Smart Energy Glass. Based on a description of underlying physics, the model abstraction process is discussed first. This results in an integrated model for performance simulations that couples TRNSYS and DAYSIM. This model is empirically validated and subsequently used to evaluate the potential of Smart Energy Glass in a renovation case under various operational scenario’s. The paper concludes with some suggestions for future research and development of Smart Energy Glass...|$|R

50|$|In 2005, the {{building}} underwent extensive renovations including: adding 2 new art rooms, 2 new computer rooms, 1 new library, a new main entrance and new gymnasium entrance. The renovations also included upgrades to the <b>building</b> <b>shell,</b> HVAC system, electrical service and distribution, telephone and data line installation throughout {{the building}}, reconfiguration of the music, special ed, science and student drop off areas. The kitchen and cafeteria were also upgraded. In 2014, the North Allegheny School Board voted to realign the attendance {{area of the}} school to relieve overcrowding. Students were reassigned to the district's other middle schools effective with the 2014-15 school year.|$|E
50|$|With {{the passive}} and active solar gains, insulation, draft proofed <b>building</b> <b>shell</b> and heat {{recovery}} system, eco-houses could be zero heat, that is, in theory, you shouldn’t {{need to keep}} pumping heat into them from a central heating system. In practice life isn’t like that. Kids leave the door open, pets come in and out, people go out all day, cold snaps happen and some people like to sleep with the window open. An eco-house can incorporate design to have heating systems that can react quickly and efficiently to any changes in room temperature {{as well as providing}} a heat boost to the water temperature down-stream of the solar panels.|$|E
5000|$|The {{adaptable}} {{mechanisms in}} CABS {{can be divided}} in two classes. The adaptive behaviour is either based on a change in properties or behaviour at the macro scale, or at the micro scale.The first type of adaptability in <b>building</b> <b>shells</b> is often {{also referred to as}} ‘kinetic envelopes’, which implies that a certain kind of observable motion is present. Adaptation on the macro scale usually results in changes in the <b>building</b> <b>shell's</b> configuration via moving parts. The types of motion that can be observed vary widely, and are typically described by one of the following gerunds: folding, sliding, expanding, creasing, hinging, rolling, inflating, fanning, rotating, curling, etc.In the other type of CABS (micro scale), changes directly affect the internal structure of a material. Here, adaptability is either manifested via changes in thermophysical or opaque optical properties, or through the exchange of energy from one form to another. Smart materials such as shape-memory alloys or temperature-responsive polymers are often applied to achieve this type of adaptation.|$|R
