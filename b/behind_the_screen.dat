5|$|A Gothic {{screen was}} also {{added to the}} Norman nave at Peterborough, {{but this is an}} {{architectural}} oddity with no precedent or successor. The screen is composed of three enormous open arches, the two outer ones being much wider than that which frames the central door. The overwhelming composition is somewhat spoilt by the later porch and the fact that two towers of very different height pop up from <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen.</b> Despite this, it is {{regarded as one of the}} supreme masterpieces of Gothic, revealing the enormous diversity and imagination of English medieval architects.|$|E
5|$|The short fifth {{passage is}} a {{continuation}} of the previous events and relates an exchange of courtesies between court ladies and a monk who had kept night watch telling religious and other stories. Murasaki Shikibu tells him: You cannot see such a lovely thing every day, to which he replies: Indeed! indeed! clapping his hands in joy and neglecting his Buddha. The illustration shows an elderly priest near the left border of the painting pushing open a folding screen beyond which three court ladies are seated. Murasaki Shikibu is seated closest to the monk directly <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen.</b>|$|E

5|$|Soon {{after the}} success of Kedok Ketawa, Saeroen joined Union Films and wrote four films for the company. These were not {{directed}} by Jo An Djan, who left Union for the competitor Populair's Film, but by the newly hired R Hu and Rd Ariffien. Union Film ultimately produced a total of seven films in 1940 and 1941 before being closed following the Japanese invasion in early 1942. Of the film's main cast, only Fatimah and Oedjang are recorded as continuing their acting career, both appearing in several further Union productions. However, in the 1950s Resobowo continued his career <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen,</b> serving as art director of such films as Darah dan Doa (The Long March; 1950).|$|E
5|$|The Beatles first {{played a}} full show with Best on 17 August 1960 at the Indra club in Hamburg, {{and the group}} slept in the Bambi Kino cinema in a small, dirty room with bunk beds, a cold and noisy former {{storeroom}} directly <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen.</b> Upon first seeing the Indra, where they were booked to play, Best remembered it as a depressing place filled with a few tourists, and having heavy, old, red curtains that made it seem shabby compared to the larger Kaiserkeller. As Best {{had been the only}} group member to study O-Level German at school, he could talk with the club's owner, Bruno Koschmider, and the clientele. After the Indra closed due to complaints about the noise, the group started a residency in the Kaiserkeller.|$|E

5|$|As {{far back}} as the Vitascope days, some exhibitors had {{screened}} films accompanied by phonographs playing appropriate, though very roughly timed, sound effects; {{in the style of the}} Kinetophone described above, rhythmically matching recordings were also made available for march and dance subjects. While Edison oversaw cursory sound-cinema experiments after the success of The Great Train Robbery (1903) and other Edison Manufacturing Company productions, it was not until 1908 that he returned in earnest to the combined audiovisual concept that had first led him to enter the motion picture field. Edison patented a synchronization system connecting a projector and a phonograph, located <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen,</b> via an assembly of three rigid shafts—a vertical one descending from each device, joined by a third running horizontally the entire length of the theater, beneath the floor. Two years later, he supervised a press demonstration at the laboratory of a sound-film system of either this or a later design. In 1913, Edison finally introduced the new Kinetophone—like all of his sound-film exhibition systems since the first in the mid-1890s, it used a cylinder phonograph, now connected to a Projecting Kinetoscope via a fishing line–type belt and a series of metal pulleys. While it met with great acclaim in the short term, poorly trained operators had trouble keeping picture in synchronization with sound and, like other sound-film systems of the era, the Kinetophone had not solved the issues of insufficient amplification and unpleasant audio quality. Its drawing power as a novelty soon faded and when a fire at Edison's West Orange complex in December 1914 destroyed all of the company's Kinetophone image and sound masters, the system was abandoned.|$|E

25|$|The dalang, {{sometimes}} referred to as Dhalang or Kawi Dalang, is the puppeteer artist behind the entire performance. It is he who sits <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen,</b> sings and narrates the dialogues of different characters of the story. With a traditional orchestra in the background to provide a resonant melody and its conventional rhythm, the dalang modulates his voice to create suspense thus heightening the drama. Invariably, the play climaxes with the triumph of good over evil. The dalang is highly respected in Indonesian culture for his knowledge, art and as a spiritual person capable of bringing to life the spiritual stories in the religious epics.|$|E

This is because Ford plans to marry her to Dr Caius, a man {{old enough to be}} her grandfather; the women reassure her that they will prevent it. Mistress Quickly announces Falstaff's arrival, and Mistress Ford has a large laundry basket and a screen placed in readiness. Falstaff's attempts to seduce Alice with tales of his past glory ("Quand'ero paggio del Duca di Norfolk" [...] / [...] "When I was page to the Duke of Norfolk I was slender") are cut short, as Mistress Quickly reports the impending arrival of Ford with a retinue of henchmen to catch his wife's lover.

In the meantime Fenton and Nannetta hide <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen.</b> The men hear the sound of a kiss behind it.

[...] "Music emerging from one speaker <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> sounds thin, tinkly and strainy. We wanted to reproduce such beautiful masterpieces... so that audiences would {{feel as though}} they were standing at the podium with Stokowski". For the recording of The Sorcerer's Apprentice in January 1938, engineers at Disney collaborated with RCA Corporation for using multiple audio channels which allowed any desired dynamic balance to be achieved upon playback. The stage was altered acoustically with double plywood semi-circular partitions that separated the orchestra into five sections to increase reverberation. Though as the production of Fantasia developed, the setup used for The Sorcerer's Apprentice was abandoned for different multi-channel recording arrangements.|$|E
500|$|Mutual gave Chaplin his own Los Angeles {{studio to}} work in, {{which opened in}} March 1916.

For The Pawnshop, he recruited the actor Henry Bergman, who was to work with Chaplin for 30 years. <b>Behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>Screen</b> and The Rink completed Chaplin's releases for 1916. The Mutual contract stipulated that he release a two-reel film every four weeks, which {{he had managed to}} achieve. With the new year, however, Chaplin began to demand more time. He made only four more films for Mutual over the first ten months of 1917: Easy Street, The Cure, The Immigrant, and The Adventurer. With their careful construction, these films are considered by Chaplin scholars to be among his finest work. [...] Later in life, Chaplin referred to his Mutual years as the happiest period of his career. However, Chaplin also felt that those films became increasingly formulaic over the period of the contract and he was increasingly dissatisfied with the working conditions encouraging that.|$|E
