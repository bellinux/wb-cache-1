5000|$|The Excelsior Diamond {{was found}} on June 30, 1893 at the Jagersfontein Mine in the Orange Free State, one of the South African Republics {{during the second half}} of the 19th century, by a worker in a shovelful of gravel he was loading into a truck. Instead of handing it over to his overseer, he {{delivered}} it directly to the mine manager, who rewarded him with £500 in cash and a horse equipped with a saddle and bridle. [...] On the day of the diamond's discovery the contract between the mining company and the syndicate of firms in London which purchased its diamonds expired. This may have contributed to the fact that its discovery was not reported in any of the prestigious British newspapers, and the diamond, despite its fine quality and exceptional size, remained largely unremarked upon. It was shipped to the London offices of Messrs Wernher, Beit and Company, one of the members of the diamond <b>buying</b> <b>syndicate,</b> with the mining company retaining a 50 percent share in the ownership of the diamond. Wernher, Beit attempted to insure the diamond for £40,000, but eventually settled for £16,250.|$|E
50|$|By early 1995 KCNC was airing 41 {{hours of}} news a week, and the station had newscasts on when NBC didn't have network {{programming}} on, because the station didn't <b>buy</b> <b>syndicated</b> programming. This ended {{almost as soon}} as Group W/CBS took over after the affiliation switch.|$|R
5000|$|In 1971, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission {{passed the}} Prime Time Access Rule and Financial Interest and Syndication Rules, which {{prevented}} networks from programming one particular hour of prime time programming on its television stations each night and required the networks {{to spin off}} their syndication arms as independent companies. Although {{the intent of the}} rule was to encourage local stations to produce their own programs for this time slot, budgetary limits instead prompted stations to <b>buy</b> <b>syndicated</b> programs to fill the slot. This, coupled with an increase in UHF independent stations, caused a boom in the syndication market. In the 1970s, first-run syndication continued to be an odd mix: cheaply produced, but not always poor quality, [...] "filler" [...] programming. These included the dance-music show Soul Train, and 20th Century Fox's That's Hollywood, a television variation on the popular That's Entertainment! theatrically released collections of film clips from the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer library.|$|R
5000|$|A 1926 Time {{magazine}} cover story described his influence like this:The New York American, the Chicago Herald-Examiner, the San Francisco Examiner and many another newspaper owned by Publisher Hearst, {{to say nothing}} of some 200 non-Hearst dailies and 800 country weeklies which <b>buy</b> <b>syndicated</b> Brisbane, all publish what Mr. Brisbane has said. His column is headed, with simple finality, [...] "Today," [...] a column that vies with the weather and market reports for the size of its audience, probably beating both. It is said to be read by a third of the total U. S. population. Obviously this is an exaggeration, but half that many would be some 20 million readers, [...] "Today" [...] and every day.Several volumes of Brisbane's editorials were published, including [...] "The Book of Today," [...] "The Book of Today and the Future Day," [...] and [...] "The Brisbane advertising philosophy." [...] At the time of his death, he was considered the [...] "virtual executive director" [...] of the Hearst news and media empire.|$|R
40|$|By picking unpopular sets {{of numbers}} in a lottery, it is {{possible}} to increase one's expected winnings. We have used the Maximum Entropy method to estimate the probability of each of the 14 million tickets being chosen by players in the UK National Lottery. We discuss the parallel solution of the non-linear system of equations on a variety of platforms and give results which indicate the returns achieved by a <b>syndicate</b> <b>buying</b> a large number of tickets each week...|$|R
5000|$|The {{deal between}} Fox and TVX had one catch. If one of TVX's underperforming {{stations}} (like WCAY/WXMT) was sold, that station could lose its Fox affiliation. As a result, in 1990, Fox pulled its affiliation from WXMT {{and moved it}} to WZTV. Act III was not done yet. The company approached MT about <b>buying</b> WXMT's <b>syndicated</b> programming inventory and moving it to WZTV, which would have left WXMT with only religious shows and Home Shopping Network programming. MT initially agreed, but {{backed out of the}} deal a few days later. He came up with another idea in which WXMT would sell its sitcoms, dramas and movies to WZTV, while WXMT would keep barter shows and cartoons. The deal closed in mid-February, around the same time that WZTV changed its on-air name to the current [...] "Fox 17".|$|R
40|$|The Canadian 6 / 49 Lotto©, {{despite its}} unusual payout structure, {{is one of}} the few {{government}} sponsored lotteries that has the potential for a favourable strategy we call "buying the pot". By "buying the pot" we mean that a <b>syndicate</b> <b>buys</b> one of each ticket in the lottery, ensuring that it holds a jackpot winner. We assume that the other bettors independently buy small numbers of tickets. This paper presents (1) a formula for the syndicate's expected return, (2) conditions under which buying the pot produces a significant positive expected return, and (3) the implications of these findings for lottery design...|$|R

5000|$|Priestley had {{recently}} collaborated with Edward Knoblock on the dramatisation of The Good Companions and now wished [...] "to prove {{that a man}} might produce long novels and yet {{be able to write}} effectively, using the strictest economy, for the stage." [...] While it was praised highly by James Agate, Dangerous Corner received extremely poor reviews and after three days he was told that the play would be taken off, a fate that he averted by <b>buying</b> out the <b>syndicate.</b> It then ran for six months. Priestley's action was further vindicated by the worldwide success the play was to enjoy, although he soon lowered his estimate of this work and as early as 1938 remarked [...] "It is pretty thin stuff {{when all is said and}} done." ...|$|R
2500|$|Bonds {{are issued}} by public authorities, credit institutions, {{companies}} and supranational {{institutions in the}} primary markets. The most common process for issuing bonds is through underwriting. When a bond issue is underwritten, one or more securities firms or banks, forming a <b>syndicate,</b> <b>buy</b> the entire issue of bonds from the issuer and re-sell them to investors. The security firm takes {{the risk of being}} unable to sell on the issue to end investors. Primary issuance is arranged by bookrunners who arrange the bond issue, have direct contact with investors and act as advisers to the bond issuer in terms of timing and price of the bond issue. The bookrunner is listed first among all underwriters participating in the issuance in the tombstone ads commonly used to announce bonds to the public. [...] The bookrunners' willingness to underwrite must be discussed prior to any decision on the terms of the bond issue as there may be limited demand for the bonds.|$|R
50|$|In 1990, WZTV's owner, Act III Broadcasting - who {{was known}} for buying its competitors' {{stronger}} programming assets and having the competitor change formats to religious or home shopping programming and in one case, even having it go dark altogether - offered to <b>buy</b> WXMT's entire <b>syndicated</b> programming inventory and move most of the shows over to WZTV, alongside programs that were already broadcast on that station. Fox also planned to exercise its option to moving its Nashville area affiliation to WZTV. Originally, WXMT was {{to switch to a}} hybrid format of home shopping for 18 hours a day and religious programs for six hours a day, but MT Communications still wanted some of the programming and to keep some entertainment shows on the schedule. The deal was called off early in February. But {{in the middle of the}} month when Fox moved over to WZTV, negotiations resumed and immediately it was decided that WZTV would get only cash programming (including sitcoms, movies, and some of the cartoons), while WXMT would keep barter cartoons, a few barter sitcoms as well as some religious shows.|$|R
