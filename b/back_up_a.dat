25|$|The leg in {{the initial}} {{position}} bends very slightly at the knees, and then kicks the lower leg and the foot downwards similar to kicking a football. The legs may be bent inward (or occasionally outward) slightly. After the kick, the straight leg moves <b>back</b> <b>up.</b> <b>A</b> frequent mistake of beginners is to bend the legs too much or to kick too much out of the water.|$|E

500|$|In 1987–88, {{the club}} {{came close to}} {{returning}} to the top division when they missed out on promotion {{on the final day}} of the season. Following relegation back to Division Three, after Geoffrey Richmond became chairman in January 1994 the club's fortunes were lifted. He helped to take them to their first appearance at Wembley and subsequently into the Premier League, where they played for two seasons. Following Richmond's self-proclaimed [...] "six weeks of madness" [...] and the collapse of television channel ITV Digital, the club suffered its first spell in administration. Another period under administration followed, and City dropped through the leagues of professional English football back to the bottom tier of The Football League, until promotion in 2012–13 brought them <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> division. In January 2013, City became the first club from the fourth tier of English football since 1962 to reach the Football League Cup final, and the first fourth-tier club ever to reach a major Wembley Cup Final.|$|E
500|$|The video opens, {{looking down}} on Martin who is singing, as he lies on his back on a {{mattress}}. As the camera shot pulls back, the mattress is revealed to be outside. A cyclist cycles past in reverse and Martin leaps up from the mattress. He walks in reverse through a city, out into the suburbs and eventually crossing a railway line [...] and into woods, picking up his suit jacket as he goes. Upon arriving at his car, a black BMW, he gets in and briefly passes out. A woman, at first shown lying unresponsive {{on the ground in}} front of the car, is shown flying back in through the shattered windscreen. The car rolls <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> hill in the woods and through a broken fence, which joins back together as the car passes through it. As the video closes, the couple is shown driving back up the road. It is revealed that Martin's passenger had removed her seat belt, in order to put her jacket on, just before the car accident, causing her death. Irish actress Elaine Cassidy portrays the female passenger.|$|E
500|$|After {{producing}} {{the music for}} Oni, O'Donnell was tasked with composing the music for Bungie's next project, which would be unveiled at E3 2000. After talking with Joseph Staten, O'Donnell decided the music needed to be [...] "big, exciting, and unusual with a classical orchestra touch to give it some weight and stature. We also wanted it {{to have some sort}} of 'ancient' feel to it." [...] O'Donnell came up with the idea of opening the piece with gregorian chant and jotted down the melody in his car. Because he did not know how long the presentation would be, O'Donnell created [...] "smushy" [...] opening and closing sections that could be expanded or cut as time required to <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> rhythmic middle section. The music was recorded and sent to New York the same night the piece was finished; the resulting music became the basis for the Halo series' [...] "highly recognizable" [...] signature sound, and what has been called one of the best-known video game themes. The use of the chant in the main theme has been credited with contributing to popular interest in the genre. Halos music used an interactive engine to change music in response to player's actions; this non-linear method has since become widespread. The scores for Halo and its sequel Halo 2 garnered awards such as The Game Developer's Choice Award and Best Original Video Game Soundtrack from Rolling Stone.|$|E

50|$|The {{costs of}} disk storage have {{decreased}} faster {{than that of}} tapes.

Drive prices offer capacities of hundreds to thousands of megabytes on relatively inexpensive machines. <b>Backing</b> <b>up</b> to <b>an</b> external USB drive became cheaper, and the drive more compact, than tape for a non-networked machine used by a business or serious user.|$|R
2500|$|In {{addition}} to these marketing strategies, Google Chrome has created several [...] "Chromebook minis" [...] that demonstrate the ease of use and simplicity of the devices in a comical manner. For example, when the question [...] "How do you <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> Chromebook" [...] is asked, it is implied to refer to data backup, but instead, shows two hands pushing a Chromebook back {{to the end of}} a table.

2500|$|However, {{there is}} still a fair amount of {{controversy}} over whether these techniques are reliable enough to be used in a legal setting [...] Some studies indicate that while there is an overall positive correlation, {{there is a great deal}} of variation between findings and in some cases considerable difficulty in replicating the findings. A federal magistrate judge in Tennessee prohibited fMRI evidence to <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> defendant's claim of telling the truth, on the grounds that such scans do not measure up to the legal standard of scientific evidence.. Most researchers agree that the ability of fMRI to detect deception in a real life setting has not been established.|$|E
2500|$|The war's end saw the {{elements}} that had been unified under big band swing scattered into separate styles and markets. [...] Some [...] "progressive" [...] big bands such as those led by Stan Kenton and Boyd Raeburn stayed oriented towards jazz, but not jazz for dancing. [...] Much of the top instrumental talent of the period were performing in small band formats ranging from R to bebop. [...] The hard core dancing niche formerly occupied by hot big band swing was occupied by small [...] "jump" [...] bands and R [...] Popular music had vocalists as the star attractions and a full-time big band to <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> vocalist was increasingly seen as an unnecessary expense. [...] In 1947 the economics of popular music led to the disbanding of many established big bands. [...] Big band music would experience a resurgence during the 1950s, but {{the connection between the}} later big band music and the swing era was tenuous.|$|E

2500|$|Hand {{quilting}} is {{the process}} of using a needle and thread to sew a running stitch by hand across the entire area to be quilted. This binds the layers together. A quilting frame or hoop is often used to assist in holding the piece being quilted off the quilter's lap. A quilter can make one stitch at a time by first driving the needle through the fabric from the right side, then pushing it back up through the material from the wrong side to complete the stitch; this is called a stab stitch. Another option is called a rocking stitch, where the quilter has one hand, usually with a finger wearing a thimble, on top of the quilt, while the other hand is located beneath the piece to push the needle <b>back</b> <b>up.</b> <b>A</b> third option is called [...] "loading the needle" [...] and involves doing four or more stitches before pulling the needle through the cloth. Hand quilting is still practiced by the Amish and Mennonites within the United States and Canada, and is enjoying a resurgence worldwide.|$|E
2500|$|The 2010 {{season was}} {{a myriad of}} {{troubles}} for Ambrose. Engine problems, unlucky crashes and pit road troubles plagued his racing season. However, in the Zippo 200 at The Glen, Ambrose won his third straight Watkins Glen he held off Joey Logano and Kevin Harvick to win. Since the win, he started to gain some form, recording a top 10 at Atlanta and a top 5 at Richmond. At the Toyota/Save Mart 350 at Sonoma, Ambrose led 35 laps, and held a ten-second lead over Jimmie Johnson. His lead got erased by a caution on lap 104. During the caution, Ambrose turned off his car's engine to conserve fuel, {{but was unable to}} restart it. As a result, Ambrose attempted to return to his spot, but was forced to fall to seventh on the restart due to not maintaining a particular speed during the caution, and finished sixth. After the race, Ambrose stated, [...] "I was leading the race and had trouble getting the motor cranked <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> little bit there, and NASCAR made the call. I was trying to save fuel and the motor shut off. It didn’t recrank the way it should. I didn’t stop rolling, but it is what it is." ...|$|E

60|$|There was no {{discernible}} {{reason why the}} little town should have been called Tyre, and yet its name was as characteristically American as its architecture.

Being a county town, it had a court-house in a yard near {{the centre of the}} town, and a big summer hotel. Curiously shaped and oddly distributed hills rose abruptly out of the valley sand, forming a sort of amphitheatre in which the village lay. These square-topped hills ended at a common level, showing that they were not the result of an upheaval, but were the remains of the original stratification formations left standing after the scooping action of the post-glacial floods had ceased.|$|E

Or it may be a reason for being as cruel as the tiger. It is one way to train the tiger to imitate you, it is a shorter way to imitate the tiger.
