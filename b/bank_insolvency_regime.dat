CHRONOLOGY OF EVENTS Northern Rock was created by the merger of two “building societies, ” the Northern Counties and the Rock, on July 1, 1965. Building societies were mutual organizations, owned by their depositors and their borrowers. Their deposits came primarily from retail customers, and their major (essentially sole) lending activity was to individuals to buy residences. In the 1990 s these organizations were allowed to demutualize and “convert ” (in the terminology of the time) to banks. Most large societies converted, and Northern Rock was among them.

40|$|<b>Bank</b> <b>insolvency</b> <b>regimes</b> vary widely.

Second, some countries rely on an administrative process for bank closure in which the bank supervisor, bank insurer, or other agency {{has the power to}} appoint the conservator or receiver, and, in some instances, may appoint itself to the job.

The distance-to-default, a widely used market-based measure of corporate default risk, ignores such regulatory actions. To overcome this limitation, this paper introduces the concept of distance-to-capital that accounts for pre-default regulatory actions {{such as those in}} a prompt-corrective-actions framework. We show that both risk measures can be analyzed using the same theoretical framework but differ depending on the level of capital adequacy thresholds and asset volatility.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} about the design of {{contingent}} capital (CoCos) to induce monitoring and to therefore reduce the expected size of taxpayer funded bailouts. CoCos are debt instruments that either convert into debt or are written down when a bank approaches distressâbased on {{a reduction in the}} bank's capital. The thesis begins with a moral hazard model that provides a stylised illustration of the circumstances where either shareholders or CoCo investors can be induced to monitor. It predicts that shareholders will monitor if conversion reduces their claim to zero and CoCo investors will monitor if conversion reduces the value of their claim below what they paid when the CoCo was issued. It then assess different elements of the modelâincluding the social cost that gives rise to the need for bailouts, the usual mechanisms to reduce the need for bailouts, and the <b>bank</b> specific <b>insolvency</b> <b>regime</b> adopted in the European Union. The focus then turns to monitoring incentives induced by CoCos. It discusses triggers and advocates higher minimum trigger levels. It then defines monitoring in the context of CoCos, assesses the extent to which monitoring is undertaken in CoCo markets, and makes recommendations about how incentives to monitor might be strengthened. </p...|$|R
40|$|As {{a result}} of cross-sector and {{cross-border}} integration, European financial systems have become more interwoven, both nationally and internationally. More particularly, they have become more complex in terms of risk interdependencies. Financial stability is obviously affected by these financial changes. Based on a critical analysis of the current European prudential framework?s ability to face this new risk profile, we argue in favour of an holistic approach to the financial safety net through {{the concept of a}} regulatory regime which is wider than the prevailing set of rules established by regulatory agencies. More precisely, this paper investigates two essential and interdependent aspects of a coherent and global financial safety net in Europe that favours the complementarities between prudential policy in a narrow sense (set of rules established by regulatory agencies, monitoring and supervision), market discipline and bank resolution policy. On one hand, {{on the basis of the}} American experience of prompt corrective action policy, we suggest promoting stronger complementarities between public financial regulation and market discipline. On the other hand, we plead for an institutionalisation of insolvency procedures for pan-european financial groups. Indeed, the European situation is characterized by a damaging heterogeneity of national <b>insolvency</b> <b>regimes</b> even though the European Directive on the Reorganization and Winding-Up of Credit Institutions provides a legal framework dealing with the crossborder aspects of European <b>bank</b> <b>insolvency.</b> This Directive undoubtedly represents an important development in the framework of E.

40|$|In {{order to}} protect the public's {{confidence}} in deposit money, governments usually guarantee bank deposits implicitly or through an explicit deposit insurance system. Thus <b>bank</b> <b>insolvency</b> does not induce immediate bank runs. In many episodes of banking crises, several years passed quietly after <b>bank</b> <b>insolvency</b> had occurred, with the insolvency continuing to develop under the surface, and the rash of bank failures broke out only when the <b>bank</b> <b>insolvency</b> exceeded a certain level. In this paper I present a simple model that describes the dynamics of <b>bank</b> <b>insolvency</b> in a form that eventually results in banking system failure or bank recapitalization by the government. The main results are as follows: (1) The government cannot indefinitely postpone recognizing the fiscal loss associated with <b>bank</b> <b>insolvency.</b> (2) The consumption level is too high (low) before (after) bank recapitalization compared with the optimal level. Thus the price conditions become deflationary (inflationary) before (after) bank recapitalization. (3) Social welfare decreases as bank recapitalization is delayed. ...|$|R

40|$|Politics, {{finance and}} <b>bank</b> <b>insolvency</b> procedures! It is a trite {{statement}} that Britain, in 2008, was {{caught off guard}} by the financial collapse of its banking sector. The distinct lack of <b>bank</b> <b>insolvency</b> procedures and the scramble to reshape overnight the relevant legal instruments bears testament to {{the weakness of the}} system at that time. Yet, this paper, through an analysis that is both doctrinal and empirical, seeks to boldly challenge this assertion. Thus, the lack of <b>bank</b> <b>insolvency</b> procedures, also in part due to the weak harmonisation of the <b>Bank</b> <b>Insolvency</b> Directive (Directive 2001 / 24 /EC), presented the British Government with a stroke of luck and the good fortune {{to be in a position}} to re-organise in a more flexible way its banking industry. Accordingly, the significant power left in the hands of the Government, and the de facto public money bail-out, contributed tellingly to the comparatively successful performance that the UK banks are currently demonstrating. Nor has Britain departed from the legacy of the financial crisis: the new Special Resolution Regime, shaped by the Banking Act 2009, still leaves room for significant political discretion. The comparison with Italy, a traditional counterpart manifesting opposing national characteristics, particularly in terms of legal systems and cultural background, may confirm this assumption, rather than dispel it. Ultimately, there are many of the opinion that the legislative framework in this area should be revamped so that a proper harmonisation of the <b>Bank</b> <b>Insolvency</b> Procedures is achieved.

40|$|During {{some recent}} {{financial}} crises, {{the majority of}} domestic banks -or indeed the entire banking sector- became insolvent. We have analyzed the welfare effects of policy responses to <b>bank</b> <b>insolvency</b> by examining {{a modified version of}} the Diamond-Rajan model, introducing a fiat currency. The sources of inefficiency in our model are the "moral hazard in banking" and the "premature liquidation of bank assets". The model assumes that <b>banking</b> system <b>insolvency</b> is caused by an exogenous macroeconomic shock that destroys a portion of banks' assets. If the government does not intervene in very severe cases of <b>bank</b> <b>insolvency,</b> a fire sale of all bank assets can occur along with dis-intermediation of the economy and falls in price levels (debt deflation). We have analyzed the consequences of the following three different policy responses to bank insolvency: (1) providing deposit guarantees (without immediate recapitalization), (2) providing unlimited liquidity support, and (3) effecting bank recapitalization through either cash creation (monetary policy) or bond issuance (fiscal policy). In doing so, we showed that bank recapitalization by fiscal measures provides the optimal solution. Our findings imply that Japan's protracted recession and deflation problem may have been caused by an inappropriate policy response to <b>bank</b> <b>insolvency.</b> ...|$|R
