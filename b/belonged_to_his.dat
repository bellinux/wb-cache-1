5|$|Pedro II was acclaimed, crowned and consecrated on 18 July 1841. He {{wore a white}} robe {{that had}} <b>belonged</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> {{grandfather}} Francis II, an orange pallium made of feathers from the Guianan cock-of-the-rock (a homage to Brazil's birds and indigenous Brazilian chieftains) woven by Tiriyó Indians especially for the emperor and a green mantle emblazoned with branches of cacao and tobacco, both symbols of the Brazilian empire. After being anointed, he received the Imperial insignia (the Imperial Regalia of Brazil): the Sword (which had <b>belonged</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> father), the Scepter (of pure gold with a wyvern on its tip, symbol of the House of Braganza), the Imperial Crown (made especially for the coronation with jewels removed from Pedro I’s crown), the Globe, and the Hand of Justice.|$|E

As a token of appreciation and admiration, Radar gives him an inscribed Winchester cartridge; a surprised Henry returns the favor by spontaneously giving Radar a rectal thermometer that once <b>belonged</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> father.|$|E
5|$|The {{death of}} Tvrtko's {{maternal}} uncle Mladen III Šubić, in 1348, {{led to a}} decline of the Šubić noble family and a long conflict over their lands. In May 1355, Jelena and Tvrtko marched with an army to Duvno in order to claim Tvrtko's share of his uncle's patrimony. An agreement was reached with the vice-Ban of Dalmatia by which Tvrtko was to inherit all the cities held by his maternal grandfather and a city which <b>belonged</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> aunt Katarina, but it is unknown whether he actually took possession of them.|$|E
5|$|Unaware of {{her death}} four years prior, the Swedish {{mathematician}} Gösta Mittag-Leffler considered nominating her for the 1926 Nobel Prize in Physics, and wrote to Shapley requesting more information on her work on Cepheid variables, offering to send her his monograph on Sofia Kovalevskaya. Shapley replied, letting Mittag-Leffler know that Leavitt had died, and suggesting that the true credit <b>belonged</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> (Shapley's) interpretation of her findings. She was never nominated, because the Nobel Prize is not awarded posthumously.|$|E

5|$|As {{time goes}} by, Rumpelstiltskin and Belle develop a strong bond with each other. After {{a few months}} of living with him, Belle asks the dark one why she found children's {{clothing}} upstairs. Rumpelstiltskin tells her it <b>belonged</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> son whom he unfortunately lost along with his wife. Gaston arrives to take Belle back but Rumpelstiltskin turns him into a rose and presents it to her as a gift. When asked about Gaston, Belle says that it was an arranged marriage, not one of love. She left him because she wanted to be heroic and there are not many chances for women to be heroic. Rumpelstiltskin asks Belle to go into town to buy more straw, and she cannot believe he trusts her to come back. Rumpelstiltskin says he does not expect to see her again.|$|E
5|$|In his youth, Stojanović wrote poems, {{only one}} of which is published—in a 1918 issue of the {{literary}} magazine Književni jug, whose editor was future Nobel Prize winner Ivo Andrić. For this poem, Stojanović was inspired by the Serbian epic hero Ailing Dojčin. A number of Stojanović's poems are preserved in a notebook that <b>belonged</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> closest school friend Todor Ilić. According to the poet Dragan Kolundžija, Stojanović's poems are lyrical miniatures composed in free verse, focused on man and nature, and filled with melancholy. Kolundžija finds that what inspired Stojanović to write poetry is reflected in his verse Krvav je bol (Pain is bloody). According to poet Miroslav Feldman, who first met Stojanović in 1919 in Zagreb, his poems were sad and permeated with a yearning for a brighter, more joyous life.|$|E
5|$|The Norman Kingdom {{was created}} on Christmas Day, 1130, by RogerII of Sicily, with the {{agreement}} of Pope Innocent II, who united the lands Roger had inherited from his father RogerI of Sicily. These areas included the Maltese Archipelago, which was conquered from the Arabs of the Emirates of Sicily; the Duchy of Apulia and the County of Sicily, which had <b>belonged</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> cousin WilliamII, Duke of Apulia, until William's death in 1127; and the other Norman vassals. Roger threw his support behind the Antipope AnacletusII, who enthroned him as King of Sicily on Christmas Day 1130.|$|E
5000|$|Certain {{other aspects}} of the Akan culture are {{determined}} patrilineally rather than matrilineally. There are 12 patrilineal Ntoro (spirit) groups, and everyone <b>belongs</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> or her father's Ntoro group, but not <b>to</b> <b>his</b> family lineage and abusua. Each Ntoro group has its own surnames, taboos, ritual purifications and forms of etiquette. [...] A person thus inherits one's Ntoro from one's father, but does not <b>belong</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> family.|$|R

In this episode, Michael deals with a case where a girl is found after on a hotel top {{in which she was}} pushed or jumped from.

Meanwhile, Rex's (Dylan Minnette) racket is broken by his best friend Cole (Logan Miller), which was an accident. Rex is angry because it <b>belonged</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> mother, Hannah (Laura Allen).|$|E
5|$|White owned {{a number}} of {{antiques}} and pieces of furniture of historical interest. Among these were items once possessed by Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron including a pair of andirons with heavy brass heads and a fender, possibly used at Lord Fairfax's Greenway Court estate. White also had a richly inlaid table made of several types of wood, which once <b>belonged</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> grandfather, Virginia judge Robert White. Beneath the table's framework was pasted a small slip of paper on which Robert White signed his name and the date, 1789. Historian Hu Maxwell noted the similarity between the handwriting of White, his father John Baker White, and his grandfather Robert White. White also owned a sugar bowl from Switzerland that had originated in China and {{had been in the}} possession of the Streit and White families for over two centuries.|$|E

At Delta State, he was an All-American, an All-Gulf South Conference, and an All-Region player all three years with the baseball team.

5|$|Henry III (1 October 1207– 16 November 1272), {{also known}} as Henry of Winchester, was King of England, Lord of Ireland, and Duke of Aquitaine from 1216 until his death. The son of King John and Isabella of Angoulême, Henry assumed the throne {{when he was only}} nine {{in the middle of the}} First Barons' War. Cardinal Guala {{declared}} the war against the rebel barons to be a religious crusade and Henry's forces, led by William Marshal, defeated the rebels at the battles of Lincoln and Sandwich in 1217. Henry promised to abide by the Great Charter of 1225, which limited royal power and protected the rights of the major barons. His early rule was dominated first by Hubert de Burgh and then Peter des Roches, who re-established royal authority after the war. In 1230, the King attempted to reconquer the provinces of France that had once <b>belonged</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> father, but the invasion was a debacle. A revolt led by William Marshal's son, Richard, broke out in 1232, ending in a peace settlement negotiated by the Church.|$|E
5|$|Verdi paid close {{attention}} to his financial contracts, making sure he was appropriately remunerated as his popularity increased. For I Lombardi and Ernani (1844) in Venice he was paid 12,000 lire (including supervision of the productions); Attila and Macbeth (1847), each brought him 18,000 lire. His contracts with the publishers Ricordi in 1847 were very specific about the amounts he was to receive for new works, first productions, musical arrangements, and so on. He began to use his growing prosperity to invest in land near his birthplace. In 1844 he purchased Il Pulgaro, 62 acres (23 hectares) of farmland with a farmhouse and outbuildings, providing a home for his parents from May 1844. Later that year, he also bought the Palazzo Cavalli ({{now known as the}} Palazzo Orlandi) on the via Roma, Busseto's main street. In May 1848, Verdi signed a contract for land and houses at Sant'Agata in Busseto, which had once <b>belonged</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> family. It was here he built his own house, completed in 1880, now known as the Villa Verdi, where he lived from 1851 until his death.|$|E
5|$|The provincial presidents were {{appointed}} by the national government and were, in theory, charged with governing the province. In practice, however, their power was intangible, varying from province to province based upon each president's relative degree of personal influence and personal character. Since the national government wanted to ensure their loyalty, presidents were, in most cases, sent to a province {{in which they had}} no political, familial or other ties. In order to prevent them from developing any strong local interests or support, presidents would be limited to terms of only a few months in office. As the president usually {{spent a great deal of}} time away from the province, often traveling to their native province or the imperial capital, the de facto governor was the vice-president, who was chosen by the Provincial Assembly and was usually a local politician. With little power to undermine provincial autonomy, the president was an agent of the central government with little function beyond conveying its interests to the provincial political bosses. Presidents could be used by the national government to influence, or even rig, elections, although to be effective the president had to rely on provincial and local politicians who <b>belonged</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> own political party. This interdependency created a complex relationship which was based upon exchanges of favors, private interests, party goals, negotiations, and other political maneuvering.|$|E
