Based on rich first-principle knowledge combined with experimental data at both conception and calibration stages, and leveraging our insights on disease processes and drug pharmacology, <b>biophysical</b> <b>modeling</b> may provide a novel and unique opportunity to interactively characterize detailed drug transport, distribution, and subsequent therapeutic effects. This innovative approach is exemplified through a three-dimensional (3 D) computational fluid dynamics model of the spinal canal motivated by questions arising during pharmaceutical development of one molecular therapy for spinal cord injury. The model was based on actual geometry reconstructed from magnetic resonance imaging data subsequently transformed in a parametric 3 D geometry and a corresponding finite-volume representation. With dynamics controlled by transient Navier–Stokes equations, the model was implemented in a commercial multi-physics software environment established in the automotive and aerospace industries. While predictions were performed in silico, the underlying <b>biophysical</b> <b>models</b> relied on multiple sources of experimental data and knowledge from scientific literature. The results have provided insights into the primary factors that can influence the intrathecal distribution of drug after lumbar administration. This example illustrates how the approach connects the causal chain underlying drug distribution, starting with the technical aspect of drug delivery systems, through physiology-driven drug transport, then eventually linking to tissue penetration, binding, residence, and ultimately clearance. Currently supporting our drug development projects with an improved understanding of systems physiology, <b>biophysical</b> <b>models</b> are being increasingly used to characterize drug transport and distribution in human tissues where pharmacokinetic measurements are difficult or impossible to perform.

Historically, the development of these methods has been largely empirical but has led to a remarkably efficient, yet invasive treatment: deep brain stimulation (DBS). However, the efficiency of DBS is limited by our lack of understanding of the underlying physiological mechanisms and by the complex relationship existing between brain processing and behaviour. <b>Biophysical</b> <b>modelling</b> of brain activity, describing multi-scale spatio-temporal patterns of neuronal activity using a mathematical model and taking into account the physical properties of brain tissue, represents one way to fill this gap.

40|$|The {{most common}} type of {{sustained}} arrhythmia is atrial fibrillation (AF), affecting about 2 % of the general population and 8 % to 11 % of the elderly, more than 65 years of age. The treatment of atrial arrythmia is still based on empirical considerations and is usually evaluated in clinical studies or in animal experiments. The main drawbacks of animal experiments lie in the difficulty of technically accessing the whole atria and in the differences between animal and human anatomy. In the last years, ever-increasing computer power has permitted the development of <b>biophysical</b> <b>models</b> of the human atria. It has become possible to simulate cellular electrical propagation in the whole human heart. Compared to clinical and animal studies, an in silico approach has the advantages of repeatability and reproducibility under controlled conditions. In this thesis, a <b>biophysical</b> <b>model</b> of the human atria has been used to investigate therapies of atrial arrhythmias: surgical ablation and therapeutic pacing. First, a brief review of the concepts of <b>biophysical</b> <b>modeling</b> of human atria developed until now is presented, as well as a brief description of several types of arrhythmia that can be simulated with the <b>biophysical</b> <b>model.</b> Second, measures of organization are considered to quantify and classify the different types of AF. With these measures, AF organization is evaluated at the electrogram signals level {{as well as at the}} cellular level. Four types of atrial arrhythmia are differentiated with the use of the biophysical model: atrial flutter, chronic AF, meandering AF and cholinergic AF. Finally, simulations of atrial therapies are investigated. The <b>biophysical</b> <b>model</b> has been used to test the efficacy of ablation lines. The surgical Maze-III procedure has proven to be highly effective in treating chronic AF. However, due to the technical difficulty and the risk of the procedure, less invasive ablation techniques have been investigated. The results confirm the superiority of aggressive surgical procedures in the termination of AF, as described in the clinical studies. Furthermore, an ideal ablation pattern has been proposed using the <b>biophysical</b> <b>model.</b> The ideal pattern should be able to prevent AF with a limited number of ablation lines of minimal length, while allowing for the maintenance or recovery of mechanical activity of both atria during sinus rhythm. The second therapeutic approach investigated is that of pacing. An algorithm of pacing and different pacing sites are investigated during this research. Antitachycardia pacing on different types of AF are carried out. The simulations showed that more organized arrhythmia such as atrial flutter can be pace-terminated. On the other hand, only local capture is possible on more complex AF. The results obtained with the <b>biophysical</b> <b>model</b> are in agreement with the clinical studies. The results of the present research prove that atrial therapies can be approached by means of a <b>biophysical</b> <b>model</b> of the human atria.

40|$|To {{date the}} concept of the {{bioeconomy}} - an economy based primarily on biogenic instead of fossil resources - has largely been associated with visions of "green growth" and the advancement of biotechnology and has been framed from within an industrial perspective. However, there is no consensus as to what a bioeconomy should effectively look like, and what type of society it would sustain. In this paper, we identify different types of narratives constructed around this concept and carve out the techno-political implications they convey. We map these narratives on a two-dimensional option space, which allows for a rough classification of narratives and their related imaginaries into four paradigmatic quadrants. We draw the narratives from three different sources: (i) policy documents of national and supra-national authorities; (ii) stakeholder interviews; and (iii) scenarios built in a <b>biophysical</b> <b>modelling</b> exercise. Our analysis shows that there is a considerable gap between official policy papers and visions supported by stakeholders. At least in the case of Austria there is also a gap between the official strategies and the option space identified through <b>biophysical</b> <b>modelling.</b> These gaps testify to the highly political nature of {{the concept of}} the bioeconomy and the diverging visions of society arising from it...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Economic models {{used for}} {{analysis}} of climate impacts or alternative climate policies are continually evolving to better handle agriculture, forestry, biofuels, and the competition for land among these uses. Ideally, these economic models should be linked to <b>biophysical</b> <b>models</b> that simulate crop or forest growth under varying conditions such as climate, soil, and fertilizer application. However, the <b>biophysical</b> <b>models</b> usually operate on much smaller time steps and geographical areas than the economic models. This paper surveys the way that land is represented in <b>biophysical</b> and economic <b>models</b> commonly used in analysis of climate impacts or climate policy. The survey covers both the representation of land and the economics of land competition in partial and general equilibrium models. A well-known example of a partial-equilibrium model is the Forest and Agricultural Sector Optimization Model (FASOM). An example of a general equilibrium model is the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) model. FASOM covers only the United States, but simulates trade in agricultural products with other countries using external demand relationships.

40|$|The Hox gene {{collinearity}} enigma {{has often}} been approached using models based on biomolecular mechanisms. The <b>biophysical</b> <b>model,</b> is an alternative approach, speculating that collinearity is caused by physical forces pulling the Hox clusters from a territory where they are inactive to a distinct spatial domain where they are activated in a step by step manner. Hox gene translocations have recently been observed {{in support of the}} <b>biophysical</b> <b>model.</b> Furthermore, genetic engineering experiments, performed in embryonic mice, gave rise to some unexpected mutant expressions that biomolecular models could not predict.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{our initial}} attempts to reconcile powerful neural network learning rules derived from computational principles with learning rules derived “bottom-up ” from biophysical mechanisms. Using a <b>biophysical</b> <b>model</b> of synaptic plasticity (Shouval, Bear, and Cooper, 2002), we generated numerical synaptic learning rules and compared {{them to the}} performance of a Hebbian learning rule in a previously studied neural network model of self-organized learning. In general, the biophysically derived learning rules did not perform as well as the analytic rule, but their performance could be improved by adjusting various aspects of the <b>biophysical</b> <b>model.</b> These results show that some {{progress has been made in}} integrating our understanding of biological and artificial neural networks. Most artificial neural networks rely on analytic learning rules that are selected for their ability to successfully solve problems (e. g., Hopfield 1982, Oja 1982, Kohonen 1984), or that represent biologically plausible but highly idealized functions of the activity of the input and output neurons over a set of stimuli (e. g., Bienenstock et al. 1982). Conversely, many <b>biophysical</b> <b>models</b> of synaptic plasticity are developed primarily for the purpose of comparison with known experimental biological results (e. g., Shouval, Bear, and Cooper 2002, Froemke and Dan 2002, Sjöström et al. 2001).

Neuronal modelling is a very active area of research, with applications ranging from the characterization of neurobiological and cognitive processes, to constructing artificial brains in silico and building brain-machine interface and neuroprosthetic devices. <b>Biophysical</b> <b>modelling</b> has always benefited from interdisciplinary interactions between different and seemingly distant fields; ranging from mathematics and engineering to linguistics and psychology. This Research Topic aims to promote such interactions by promoting papers that contribute to {{a deeper understanding of}} neural activity as measured by fMRI or electrophysiology. In general, mean field models of neural activity can be divided into two classes: neural mass and neural field models. The main difference between these classes is that field models prescribe how a quantity characterizing neural activity (such as average depolarization of a neural population) evolves over both space and time as opposed to mass models, which characterize activity over time only; by assuming that all neurons in a population are located at (approximately) the same point.

40|$|Aim: Connectivity {{assessments}} {{are crucial to}} large-scale conservation planning, in particular for establishing and monitoring connected networks of marine protected areas (MPAs). Using <b>biophysical</b> <b>modelling</b> and genetic analyses, we assessed potential and realized connectivity among MPA populations of a benthic foundation species, the Mediterranean endemic seagrass Posidonia oceanica. Location: Adriatic and Ionian seas (central Mediterranean). Methods: We assessed potential and realized connectivity among eight P. oceanica meadows, mostly located in MPAs. Potential connectivity was assessed over a time horizon of 10 years via an individual-based biophysical model whose physical component relies on fine-scale spatio-temporal ocean circulation fields. Genetic assessments of realized connectivity were carried out {{by means of a}} set of 14 neutral microsatellite loci, as well as a larger dataset of 19 loci including outlier loci that did not conform to expectations under neutrality. Results: Our findings point out a relatively high potential connectivity through long-range dispersal of floating fruits. Genetic connectivity analyses show a complex scenario with an apparent lower realized connectivity. The P. oceanica meadow within Torre Guaceto MPA (TOG), a well-enforced MPA within our study area, showed one of the highest levels of genotypic richness, indicative of high levels of sexual reproduction and/or recruitment of foreign genotypes. Both <b>biophysical</b> <b>modelling</b> and population genetics indicate that TOG is important to ensure the viability of the species at the local scale, and does likely play a key role as a source of propagules for the whole Adriatic area. Main conclusions: Our results show that realized dispersal does not necessarily match with the potential for dispersal. Still, both genetic and physical connectivity analyses show good agreement in identifying hotspots of connectivity.
