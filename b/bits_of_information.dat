5|$|Several {{recent studies}} have shown that adding seductive details does not have a {{significant}} impact on learner outcomes. Park et al. (2011) looked at cognitive load theory to explain these controversial results. The experiment asked high school students to learn about biology using a multimedia environment (one with seductive details and one without). The experiment also varied the cognitive load for the students. The results showed that students performed significantly higher when seductive details were present in a low cognitive load environment as compared with all other conditions. Another study by Park et al. (2015) showed that while seductive details were detrimental to learning in high cognitive load text conditions, seductive details actually improved motivation and learning outcomes in narration conditions where the cognitive load was low. This means that slideshows or webcasts with well-prepared narration that use motivating <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> increase learner motivation.|$|E

50|$|Dynamic RAM (DRAM) is {{very popular}} due to its cost effectiveness. If a {{computer}} has 1 gigabyte or 512 megabytes of RAM, the specification describes dynamic RAM (DRAM).

Saadon's family members even visited Yassin in an Israeli prison, in an attempt to obtain new information on the whereabouts of Ilan Saadon. Over the years there were various allegations made by various organizations claiming that they were holding Saadon alive, and that he would be returned in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners – these organizations even presented the dog tag of Saadon as evidence. Nevertheless, these claims turned out eventually to be false.|$|E

This portion of the city hosts businesses, including shopkeepers who sell holy items for each temple's worshipers, a jewelry shop, and retailers who provide arms and armor. A party can also contract with the clerk of the city council for various commissions; proclamations fastened to the halls within City Hall offer <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> to aid the party.

500|$|An {{alternative}} educational approach {{informed by}} cognitive flexibility is hypertext, which is frequently computer-supported instruction. Computers allow for complex {{data to be}} presented in a multidimensional and coherent format, allowing users to access that data as needed. The most widely used example of hypertext is the Internet, which dynamically presents information in terms of interconnection (e.g. hyperlinks). Hypertext documents, therefore, include nodes – <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> – and links, the pathways between these nodes. Applications for teacher education have involved teacher-training sessions based on video instruction, whereby novice teachers viewed footage of master teachers conducting a literacy workshop. [...] In this example, the novice teachers received a laserdisc of the course content, a hypertext document that allowed the learners to access content in a self-directed manner. These [...] (CFH) provide a “three-dimensional” and “open-ended” representation of material for learners, enabling them to incorporate new information and form connections with preexisting knowledge. While {{further research is needed}} to determine the efficacy of CFH as an instructional tool, classrooms where cognitive flexibility theory is applied in this manner are hypothesized to result in students more capable of transferring knowledge across domains.|$|E

500|$|Samus {{has been}} well {{received}} by the video game community. In 2001, IGN remarked that Samus has a cult following greater than most other female video game characters. She was chosen by the users of IGN as the most requested character who should have her own movie franchise by the website's users, the staff remarking that her tragic past makes her a perfect candidate for a movie, especially the loss of both her parents to the Space Pirates. Among their list of voted characters, IGN considered Samus to be the video game character that [...] "could lead the pack of video game adaptations that actually manage {{to live up to}} the source material." [...] Samus appeared in multiple GameFAQs [...] "Character Battle" [...] contests, winning the [...] "Character Battle V" [...] in 2006. In 2009, GameSpot featured her in their poll [...] "All-Time Greatest Game Hero", in which she lost to Mario in the semi-finals. Paul O'Connor, the lead game designer for Sammy Studios and a fan of the Metroid series, remarked that players empathize and identify with Samus because she is often rewarded for indulging in her curiosity. The book Videogames and Art noted that in the original Metroid the player is not briefed on Samus's past or future; the only interaction that they have with the character is by being her through gameplay, while <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> can be gleaned from the handbook and through concept art, adding, [...] "Samus is very rare for the character intimacy gained solely through game play and for her stasis and then drastic change," [...] referring to the revelation that she is a woman.
