Ginóbili produced numbers closely identical to his successful 2004–05 campaign despite starting in only 36 of 75 games, his second lowest since arriving at San Antonio.

In Week 3, in the first quarter against the New York Giants Van Buren scored his 39th career rushing touchdown, surpassing Ernie Nevers as the all-time leader. That game—a 45–0 shutout win—was the first in an eight-game winning streak for the Eagles in which they scored 275 points total and allowed 49. The team finished the regular season with the <b>best</b> <b>record</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Eastern Division and were to meet the Chicago Cardinals again for the league championship.|$|E
5|$|The Hitmen have {{finished}} with the <b>best</b> <b>record</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> WHL four times, and qualified for the playoffs for thirteen consecutive seasons between 1998 and 2010.

The Hitmen hold numerous WHL attendance records, and in 2004–05 became the first team in Canadian Hockey League history to average 10,000 fans per game. Thirty-nine former Hitmen players have gone on to play in the National Hockey League.|$|E

Lou Gehrig played his first full season as the Yankees' starting first baseman, and the team traded for rookie shortstop Tony Lazzeri in the offseason, eventually playing him at second base. Gehrig, Lazzeri and Ruth led the offense, while Pennock and Urban Shocker led the starting rotation with 42 wins between them.|$|E

2500|$|Up until 2006, the {{division}} champions were guaranteed {{no worse than}} the third seed, while the non-division winners could do {{no better than the}} fourth seed regardless of record.

5|$|The playoff {{structure}} {{used from}} 1933 to 1966 was considered inequitable by some {{because of the}} number of times it failed to match the teams with the two best records in the championship game, as only the conference winners would qualify for playoff contention. Four times between 1950 and 1966 (in 1951, 1956, 1960, and 1963) the team with the second-best win-loss record did not qualify for the playoffs while the team with the <b>best</b> <b>record</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> other conference, but only the third-best in the league, would advance to the championship game.|$|E
5|$|After {{missing the}} playoffs in 1988, the Giants started the 1989 season 8–1 and did not allow more than 24 points in any game. After {{suffering}} through a 1–3 stretch, including a 31–10 loss to the Los Angeles Rams in Anaheim, the Giants rallied to win their final three games to secure the second <b>best</b> <b>record</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> NFC at 12–4. The division clinching season finale was highlighted by kick returner Dave Meggett's first career punt return for a touchdown. Though many people predicted an NFC Championship showdown between the Giants and the 49ers, the Giants lost their divisional playoff game to the Rams 19–13 in overtime. The highlight of the game was wide receiver Flipper Anderson's catch of the game-winning touchdown pass over cornerback Mark Collins. After he caught the pass, Anderson raced down the sideline, through the end zone, and into the tunnel {{that led to the}} locker rooms, silencing the crowd.|$|E
5|$|General Manager Bryan Colangelo {{continued}} to surround Bosh with complementary players, and signed two-time Euroleague Most Valuable Player Anthony Parker. Spanish international Jorge Garbajosa and former slam dunk champion Fred Jones were also signed from free agency. The Raptors concluded pre-season transactions by re-signing veteran Darrick Martin. With this new lineup, Toronto looked {{to maintain a}} team who could both pass and shoot the ball, but was also stronger defensively than the 2005–06 roster. As a showcase of their new roster, on 15 October 2006, the 119 points by Toronto marked the third highest total in a pre-season game in franchise history. The Raptors finished the pre-season with a 7–1 win-loss record, which was the <b>best</b> <b>record</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> league and a franchise record.|$|E

The team was also the league's best scoring with an average of 3.38 goals scored per game. The Avalanche met the two lowest seeds of the Western Conference in the first two rounds of the playoffs: the Chicago Blackhawks and the Edmonton Oilers, and defeated them in six games and five games, respectively. During a rematch of the previous year Western Conference Finals, the Avalanche lost to the Detroit Red Wings in six games. Detroit went on to sweep the Stanley Cup Finals just as the Avalanche had done the year before. Sandis Ozolinsh was elected for the league's first All-Star team {{at the end of the}} season.|$|E

With a 1–0 victory over the Houston Dynamo at Crew Stadium on April 26, Schmid became the second MLS coach to win 100 regular-season games.
