Neurocognitive dysfunction has often been reported in other psychotic disorders, although there are inconsistencies in the literature. In the context of four distinct diagnostic groups, the authors compared neuropsychological performance among patients experiencing their first psychotic episode. Data were derived from a population-based, case-control study of patients with first-episode psychosis. A neuropsychological test battery was administered to patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia (N= 65), <b>bipolar</b> disorder or <b>mania</b> (N= 37), depressive psychosis (N= 39), or other psychotic disorders (N= 46) following index presentation, {{as well as to}} healthy comparison subjects (N= 177). The presence of specific and generalized cognitive deficits was examined. The schizophrenia group presented widespread neuropsychological impairments and performed significantly worse than healthy comparison subjects on most neuropsychological measures. Patients with other psychotic disorders and depressive psychosis also demonstrated widespread impairments. Deficits in patients with <b>bipolar</b> disorder or <b>mania</b> were less pervasive but evident in performance scores on verbal memory and fluency tests. Differences between the four patient groups and healthy comparison subjects and among the patient groups were attenuated after controlling for differences in general cognitive ability (IQ).

40|$|Objective: Popularity of {{complementary}} {{and alternative}} medicines (CAM) {{in the treatment}} of bipolar disorder continues to grow as patients search for natural or more holistic alternatives to pharmacotherapy. In recent years research into the efficacy of CAM has increased however most of this focuses on depression per se rather than bipolar disorder, with few controlled studies targeting <b>bipolar</b> depression or <b>mania.</b> Hence, findings of research into CAM and bipolar disorders are critically reviewed. Method: Studies on the topic were identified through a literature search in Medline, PsychInfo, and EMBASE using the terms <b>bipolar</b> disorder, <b>mania,</b> hypomania, and depression in conjunction with the terms complementary/alternative medicine, complementary/alternative therapy, as well as the names of specific treatments. Further articles were identified from the bibliographies of published articles. Results: Results from previous studies of CAM and bipolar disorder are discussed with respect to treatment efficacy, methodological issues, and reported side effects. Conclusion: CAM is routinely used by patients with bipolar disorder. Controlled studies examining the treatment of bipolar disorder using CAM are needed to better understand the putative benefits and possible risks. Future research should evaluate not only efficacy but also the effectiveness and potential side effects of CAM treatments as both monotherapy and adjunctive therapy...|$|R
