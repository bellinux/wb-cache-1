25|$|In {{the sport}} of cricket, {{different}} fielding restrictions are imposed {{depending on the type}} of match. They are used to discourage certain bowling tactics, or to encourage the batsmen to play <b>big</b> <b>shots,</b> enabling them to hit fours and sixes. Each team has nine fielders other than the wicket-keeper and bowler. The captain decides the fielding positions usually after consulting with the bowler. In Test cricket matches, the fielding restrictions are relaxed as compared to a One Day International.|$|E
25|$|Louisville {{dominated}} top-seeded Washington, using a big spurt late in {{the first}} half and then cruising from there. After an evenly matched sixteen minutes that saw Washington lead 30-29, Louisville went on an 18-5 run to close the first half, with the <b>big</b> <b>shots</b> coming from Francisco García, who nailed two three-pointers during that stretch to extend the lead. Washington tried a second-half comeback, cutting Louisville's lead to 67-61 with 8:41 left, but Louisville had enough to pull away.|$|E
50|$|Its first {{published}} title was the anthology title <b>Big</b> <b>Shot</b> Comics, {{the premiere of}} which introduced Skyman and The Face. <b>Big</b> <b>Shot</b> Comics would run for 104 issues until 1949, when Columbia went out of business. Other titles published by Columbia included spinoff series from <b>Big</b> <b>Shot</b> Comics featuring Skyman (four issues) and The Face.|$|R

Instead of taking the dog to the pound, <b>Big</b> <b>Shot</b> intends to have him stow away on a train to Alabama. Buckwheat instead talks <b>Big</b> <b>Shot</b> into letting the gang adopt the dog, whom they name [...] "Smallpox" [...] (opting for a more {{interesting}} name for the spotted dog than [...] "Spot"). However, when Froggy, Mickey, and Janet overhear Buckwheat and <b>Big</b> <b>Shot's</b> plans to [...] "surprise them with S/smallpox," [...] they fear the worst and call all their friends and the Greenpoint Board of Health. A panic grips the small town, with the gang's parents worried about their whereabouts and well-being, {{and the rest of the}} neighborhood kids running away from Buckwheat and <b>Big</b> <b>Shot</b> wherever they turn up.|$|R
5000|$|The Fox-Whitney team {{continued}} on <b>Big</b> <b>Shot</b> Comics confirmably through #44 (March 1944) and almost certainly beyond; <b>Big</b> <b>Shot</b> #97 (Jan. 1949), for example, contains a Whitney written-and-drawn Skyman story. <b>Big</b> <b>Shot</b> itself ran through issue #104 (Aug. 1949). The cover of <b>Big</b> <b>Shot</b> #67 (July 1946) welcomes home [...] "Ex-Sgt. Ogden Whitney", who draws Skyman again [...] "starting this issue", {{and the first}} page of its six-page Skyman story is headlined, [...] "Welcome home, Ogden Whitney!" [...] and calls it his first one since his return from WWII service.|$|R
25|$|In 1976, Frazier (32–3) fought George Foreman for {{a second}} time. With a shaved head for a new image Frazier fought well enough, {{somewhat}} more restrained than usual, avoiding walking onto the <b>big</b> <b>shots</b> which he had done in their first match. However, Foreman awaited his moment and then lobbed in a tremendous left hook that lifted Frazier off his feet. After a second knock down it was stopped in the fifth. Shortly after the fight, Frazier announced his retirement.|$|E
25|$|Exhibiting his {{trademark}} poise {{in front of}} an unfriendly crowd during a tough second-round game against Louisville, Law again provided a number of <b>big</b> <b>shots.</b> Hitting 13 of his 15 free-throw attempts, he ended the game with 26 points, including the final two points of the game. The Aggie's 72–69 victory earned them a berth in the Sweet 16 {{for the first time since}} 1980. In a show of good sportsmanship, Law spent time after the game consoling disappointed Louisville freshman Edgar Sosa, complimenting him on his performance. On March 22, however, Law and his teammates faced the #2 seed Memphis Tigers. The score was close throughout and Law had a chance to put A up by three on a break away lay up that he missed with just a few seconds to play. The Aggies lost in a narrow contest 65–64, ending his collegiate career.|$|E
25|$|Entering the 1969–70 season, Chappell hit four {{hundreds}} {{to earn a}} {{place on}} an Australian A trip to New Zealand. Scoring 519 runs at 57.70, he was the dominant batsman of the tour and with the Test team failing in South Africa, he only needed a solid start to the next season to force his way in to play against England in the 1970–71 Ashes Series. After acting as twelfth man in the first Test, he was selected to bat at number seven for the second match, the first Test played at Perth's WACA ground. During an historic century on debut, he teamed with Ian Redpath to add 219 runs and haul Australia out of a difficult situation. Just days after the Test, he belted 102 in two hours against the English in a tour match. However, the dream start affected Chappell, who struggled {{for the rest of}} the series, apart from a score of 65 in the last Test. In the main, he was getting out by playing too many <b>big</b> <b>shots</b> early in his innings.|$|E

25|$|Ashraful went {{on after}} lunch, making 42 before a slower ball from Fernando ended his 43-run stand with Aftab Ahmed, and after that, wickets fell quickly. Muttiah Muralitharan added three to his series tally, which now stood at 12, and eight people {{were caught in}} the Bangladeshi innings, which lasted 45.4 overs. It would have been even less but for a {{determined}} half-hour between Mashud and Enamul - the pair added 25 in 9 overs before Mashud was stumped shortly after tea. Bangladesh were asked to follow on, and once again gave up catches - Nafees Iqbal had been promoted to opener, and made 30 quickly, before giving up a leg side catch to Sangakkara. Earlier, Javed Omar and Habibul Bashar had been out to expansive shots for low scores, and once again it was down to Ashraful. He recorded 21 runs in the evening session, at an unusually slow pace, while Shahriar Nafees were left to hit the <b>big</b> <b>shots,</b> taking eight fours off the Sri Lankan bowlers as he moved to 51. Two balls before the close of play, however, he edged to Samaraweera at slip, giving Muralitharan another wicket, and Bangladesh closed on 131 for 4, still 135 short of Sri Lanka's first innings score.|$|E
25|$|In the offseason, {{after the}} {{departure}} of Trevor Ariza, the Wizards signed veteran small forward Paul Pierce to a two-year contract. Pierce's veteran leadership {{proved to be a}} major factor on and off the court in the team's improvement. On November 12, 2014, the Wizards defeated the Detroit Pistons 107–103, extending their record to 6–2 {{for the first time since}} the 1975–76 season. The following game three days later, the Wizards defeated the Orlando Magic 98-93 as they won their third straight and moved to 7–2, their best start since opening 7–1 during the 1974–75 season. With a 104-96 win over the Los Angeles Clippers on December 12, the Wizards moved to an 11–2 record at home to start the season for the first time in franchise history. They would struggle throughout the later months of the season but the Washington Wizards would finish the season with a 46–36 record, their best record since the 1978–1979 season. They played the Toronto Raptors in the first round of the NBA Playoffs and won in four games, marking their first sweep in franchise history. Following the victory over Toronto, the Wizards next had to play the top seeded Atlanta Hawks. The Wizards managed to take the first game in the series, but suffered the loss of Wall due to a fractured wrist. Although small forward Paul Pierce made several <b>big</b> <b>shots</b> throughout the series, the loss of Wall proved too much, and Atlanta took the series in six games.|$|E
500|$|By early April, most NBA draft analysts {{thought he}} would be {{selected}} in the second round, but Larry Butler, his former AAU coach with the Illinois Warriors, thought he might go late in the first round. He's shown his toughness, his will to win. He brings all those little intangibles to the table that the elite players do. He's always making the right pass, always making the <b>big</b> <b>shots,</b> always making the big plays, always making his free throws.... The kid is a winner. He's always been a winner.|$|E
50|$|The Skyman {{was created}} by writer Gardner Fox and artist Ogden Whitney in the Columbia Comics omnibus title <b>Big</b> <b>Shot</b> Comics #1 (May 1940). After {{appearing}} in the first eight issues of <b>Big</b> <b>Shot,</b> the character was spun off into his own series, in which one issue each appeared in 1941, 1942, 1947, and 1948. The Skyman went on to appear in virtually every issue of <b>Big</b> <b>Shot</b> through issue #101 (May 1949). That comic itself lasted only three more issues. The Skyman additionally appeared in a story in Sparky Watts #1 (1942).|$|R

500|$|The caption to the {{published}} photograph {{referred to the}} group as solemn. It was true {{that many of the}} group had reservations at appearing in a mainstream media publication; Rothko especially. Yet none could have mistaken the consequences of Pollock's three-page spread in Life of August 8, 1949. Pollock's next show, opening November 21, 1949, at Betty Parsons Gallery, was an unmistakable triumph. Famously, Willem de Kooning was heard to say to Milton Resnick: [...] "Look around. These are the <b>big</b> <b>shots.</b> Jackson has finally broken the ice." [...] In the ensuing year, Betty Parsons sent Pollock checks totalling $6,508.23 on gross sales of over $10,000, at a time when more than two thirds of American families lived on less than $4,000 per year. Pollock seems to have been invited to sign the Studio 35 open letter, at least in part, because of his notoriety, almost entirely attributable to the Life article. In the end the sitting was an uncomfortable accommodation between the system of values under which the artists had laboured and their desire for career success.|$|E
500|$|In the Gold Medal {{match in}} London, the team faced the Australia women's {{national}} wheelchair basketball team, who had defeated them 48–46 in Sydney {{just a few}} months before, in front of a capacity crowd of over 12,000 at the North Greenwich Arena. The German team had been undefeated up to that point, but had started off slow in its games against the United States and China, winning these games by six-point margins, and seemed to play its best basketball only in the final minutes of a game. Adermann scored 19 points, more than any other player in the match, and was a key factor in Germany winning 58-44. [...] "Most of my shots weren’t even any crazy shots or any outside shots,” Adermann said. [...] "They were the same shots I took in the others games, but I played more in this game, and I had many more easy opportunities getting into the paint." [...] "I’m always one of the shooters, but I think Australia underestimated me and didn’t defend me {{as well as some of}} the other girls. They left me open a lot and I got some <b>big</b> <b>shots,</b> so it went well for me. It just worked out that I scored the most points in the final, but it wasn’t deliberate." ...|$|E
500|$|On January 19, 2011 in a {{press conference}} at Times Square, New York, Bob Arum and Don King, working {{together}} for the first time in five years, officially announced that Cotto would defend his WBA light middleweight title against former two-division world champion Ricardo Mayorga at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada on March 12, 2011 live on Showtime PPV. In front of 7,247 at the MGM, Cotto defeated Mayorga via TKO in the 12th round, retaining his WBA light middleweight title. Throughout the fight, Mayorga looked to engage, however the discipline on Cotto played a big part in the win, saving his <b>big</b> <b>shots</b> for the final round. A left hook ended, which dropped Mayorga ended the bout. At the time of stoppage, Cotto was ahead by five points on all three judges scorecards. With the win, Cotto's record for world title fights improved to (17-2). Cotto earned $1 million from the fight and compubox stats showed that Cotto out punched Mayorga 249 to 176 in total punches. In the post-fight, Cotto explained how he won the fight, [...] "The game plan was not to get caught up in any of his antics. He was very heavy handed, I felt his punches the whole fight." [...] He also mentioned how before the last round, his trainer Emanuel Steward told him he would be able to stop Mayorga in the last round, which was the conclusion of the fight.|$|E

On May 10, a 12-year-old girl Michèle won the contest of The Voice Kid in Germany after performing the song on the final show. Sam Bailey sang [...] "Listen" [...] on August 31, 2013 during the tenth season of The X Factor in the UK.

500|$|Chapman's {{team won}} the second Test comfortably after scoring 636 in their first innings, the highest team total in Tests at that time. In the third Test, England began the fourth innings {{requiring}} 332 to win on a rain-damaged pitch, a task critics believed impossible. A large opening partnership from Hobbs and Sutcliffe gave England a chance, and Hobbs {{sent a message to}} the England dressing room suggesting a tactical change in the batting order. But the team could not find Chapman, who according to Percy Fender, in attendance as a journalist, {{spent most of his time}} socialising with guests in the Ladies' Stand. Consequently, the team followed Hobbs' plan without the approval of the captain. England's batsmen took the total to within 14 of victory when the fourth wicket fell. Chapman came in and batted in an unusual way; after attempting some <b>big</b> <b>shots,</b> he played ultra-defensively, possibly in an attempt to allow Patsy Hendren to reach fifty runs before England won. Hendren was out soon after, then Chapman tried to hit a six and was caught. The batsmen continued to play recklessly and a further wicket fell to a run out. Douglas describes the end of the match: [...] "Meanwhile, [...] was quite unruffled by the sudden upsets. He wound up for the next delivery and thumped it through mid-on for 4, bellowing, 'Dammit, we've done 'em!' It was an appropriate way for a side under Chapman to win the Ashes." [...] England's victory in the third Test ensured the Ashes were retained, and the team also won the fourth Test to take a 4–0 lead in the series.|$|E
