5|$|The London Naval Treaty of 1930 {{mandated}} that Wyoming be demilitarized; she accordingly was {{converted into a}} training ship, with half of her main <b>battery</b> turrets, <b>belt</b> armor, and anti-torpedo bulges removed. Arkansas was permitted to continue in service with the fleet, however. After the United States entered World War II, Arkansas was used to escort convoys to North Africa. By 1944, she served as a coastal bombardment vessel; in this role, she supported Allied landings at Normandy (Operation Overlord) and southern France (Operation Dragoon) before being transferred to the Pacific, where she provided fire support to Marines fighting on Iwo Jima and at Okinawa in 1945. Wyoming meanwhile continued as a training ship, being modified further in 1944 to include {{the various types of}} anti-aircraft guns that trainees would operate in the fleet.

50|$|With {{growing demand}} for Datsun cars in the 1970s, the Tan {{brothers}} considered the possibility of constructing their own assembly plant. Prior to 1976, Tan Chong Motor {{had to rely on}} third parties for the local assembly of their popular Datsun vehicles. The prospect of a new Malaysian plant was welcomed by Nissan's top executives, and it was decided that the plant would be constructed in Segambut, on the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur. Nissan's engineers would contribute to the plant's design, and its overall layout would mirror the prestigious Nissan Zama plant, while a separate subsidiary, Tan Chong Motor Assemblies Sdn. Bhd. (TCMA) would handle plant operations. Advanced manufacturing techniques would also be incorporated, including the electro-dipping (ED) system of applying primer to car bodies, in which the entire bodyshell of a car is electrically charged and immersed in a tank of primer paint, ensuring that every bit of bare metal is covered and safeguarded against rust. At the time, TCMA's plant was the nation's first to implement this technology. In 1976, the new plant commenced operations, and the first Datsun from TCMA was flagged off by Tan Yuet Foh in an official ceremony. The following year, TCMA began assembling Nissan Diesel trucks and buses, and by 1980, locally manufactured parts for TCMA's models had grown to include shock absorbers, leaf springs, tyres, glass, <b>batteries,</b> seat <b>belts</b> and wiring harnesses among others.|$|R
5000|$|The armour was {{thicker than}} that of many other cruisers of the time (such as the Italian Condottieri), heavy enough to {{withstand}} opposing cruiser main <b>batteries.</b> The <b>belt</b> and deck armour was substantially thicker than usual. Condottieri s Group III had only 60 mm belt and 30 mm deck, while La Galissonnière had a 75-105 mm armoured belt, and 37-50 mm deck armor thickness. This was enough to withstand a 152 mm round at combat range (navweaps.com gives 76 mm at 11,000 m, when fired from a British gun), while Italian counterparts cannot {{have done the same}} with their light armour, sacrificed for the best speed. Only the last group of Condottieri was superior, with a heavier displacement of 9,100 tons (20% more than French cruisers), 10 guns, and up to 130 mm armour (thought to withstand 152 mm as well), but they were only two ships. In any event, these powerful ships never fought one another. The La Galissonière-class cruisers 105 mm armored belt was also thicker than the Nürnbergs (50 mm), the HMS Didos (76.2 mm), or the Fijis (3.5-inch or 88 mm), and equivalent to the Leanders. The turret protection, with 100 mm (4-in.) on faces, and 50 mm (2-in.) on sides, back, and roofs was also better than on other cruisers with similar displacement (1.25-inch on German cruisers, 1-in, on the British ones, 2-in on Town or Fiji classes, and 3 to 5-in on [...] ).|$|R
40|$|An {{electrically}} operated knapsack sprayer of ten (10) liters capacity was developed using locally available materials and its performance evaluated. This device is developed {{to reduce the}} constant application of energy to throttle to regulate air pressure a problem in conventional knapsack sprayers. The major components include; tank, 12 volts electric water pump, 12 volts accumulator <b>battery,</b> strap (<b>belt),</b> delivery pipe and a sprayer handle together with lance and nozzle. Electric water pump that bended with the designed parameter was Mercedes Benz wind screen washer pump, powered by 12 volts, 2. 5 amperes battery (motorcycle type). Laboratory and field tests were conducted to determine flow rate, application rate and distribution rate. Basic hydraulic principles were considered for determining flow rate, while application rate was determined by effective use of walking speed on field. The {{results showed that the}} sprayer has a flow rate of 531 ml, application rate of 250 l/ha and a spray distribution area of 0. 000675 m 2. The result from the laboratory test indicated that decrease in liquid head leads to decrease in flow rate and vice versa. Efficiency of spray decreased with decrease in voltage of battery and application rate is influenced by walking speed. The sprayer is capable of spraying 250 l/ha in 4. 17 hrs at a walking speed of 0. 7 m/s. This device cannot be operated continuously for more than 2 hrs due to decrease in voltage. It is advisable for extra batteries to be carried along to the farm for large hectare spraying...|$|R
40|$|Among all fossil fuels, {{natural gas}} is {{probably}} the most attractive one because of its higher heating value, and approximately 97 % methane content, which creates less hazardous emissions during power generation. Considering these important facts and the demand for natural gas in the world market, it would be unlikely to think of converting natural gas. However, if we want to utilize our planet’s limited natural gas resources better, then we need to explore alternative ways. A way to achieve that goal is direct cracking of natural gas via solar thermal processing. This paper describes advantages of solar cracking of natural gas from energy, environment and economic point of view. Results show that products of natural gas decomposition contain 8 % more energy per mole compared to natural gas itself, while the decomposition process does not emit any hazardous emissions to the environment. As for the economics, once the decomposition products of natural gas, namely hydrogen and carbon black, are sold separately, it is possible to make up to three times more revenue than the selling of natural gas. The products of natural gas decomposition have a very wide use in chemical and petroleum industries. For example, hydrogen is a crucial commodity to refine crude oil, while carbon black is the fundamental component in car tire, <b>battery,</b> conveyer <b>belt,</b> and printer ink manufacturing industries. Currently, petroleum industry produces hydrogen via steam reforming of methane and the chemical industry produces carbon black from coal or natural gas combustion in furnace, which are both highly toxic and global warming emissive processes. With solar cracking of natural gas, these two important commodities can be produced without any emissions to the environment. status: publishe...|$|R
5000|$|The {{internal}} combustion engine requires regular maintenance to ensure its continued function. Engine oil, power steering and brake fluid are examples of engine maintenance that must be kept and checked at regular intervals. Often wear and tear over time can leave an engine totally unusable, {{in which case the}} restorer might remove the existing engine {{and replace it with a}} similar or modern engine substitute. In order to conduct an engine restoration first a technician will conduct a thorough inspection. Often pre-restored vehicle have engines that have gone without maintenance for years and therefore require engine restoration to return them to working order. The engine is removed from the car and inspected for broken and non-functional parts. Typical parts that require replacing include the pistons, spark plugs, fuel lines <b>battery,</b> fuses, timing <b>belt</b> and various gaskets. All are subject to deterioration over time. Structural components like the engine block, cam shaft and crank shaft are less likely to require repair but not uncommon. [...] Typically, after all required parts are gathered, the disassembled pieces will be cleaned, lubricated (if required), and reassembled. The engine is then replaced within the car. A mechanic will then perform a series of tests to ensure that the engine is in working, road worthy condition. [...] This is known as a pre-start engine check. First all the lines and hoses are checked for breaks and leaks. Second the radiator is topped off with water to ensure that the system is sealed off. Next the oil level is replenished. Finally the battery charge is checked and the ignition system is inspected. The engine is then ready to be started.|$|R
