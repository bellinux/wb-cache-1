5|$|By the 18th century, the Royal Audiencia of Quito <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{economic}} problems; a lack {{of roads}} led to limited communications. Obrajes—a type of textile factory—had provided jobs, but now found themselves in decline, mainly due to a crackdown on smuggled European cloths {{and a series of}} natural disasters. Obrajes were replaced by haciendas, and the dominant groups continued to exploit the indigenous population.|$|E
5|$|Daniels' {{support for}} such {{controversial}} legislation {{led to a}} rapid drop in his approval rating; in May 2005, a poll showed an 18-point drop in support and that only 42% of Hoosiers approved {{of the way he}} was doing his job. In the following months, many of his reforms <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a positive effect; and his ratings began to improve, and his approval rebounded.|$|E
5|$|In December 2001, {{a series}} of deposit runs <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a severe impact {{on the health of}} the banking system, leading the Argentine {{authorities}} to impose a partial deposit freeze. With Argentina no longer in compliance with the conditions of the expanded IMF-supported program, the IMF decided to suspend disbursements. At the end of December, in a climate of severe political and social unrest, the country partially defaulted on its international obligations; in January 2002, it formally abandoned the convertibility regime.|$|E

5|$|In {{the second}} half, Virginia Tech's offense <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> success. Tech earned the only {{points of the}} third quarter—a 28-yard field goal from kicker Brandon Pace—to narrow Louisville's lead to 17–13. In the fourth quarter, however, the game fully turned in the Hokies' favor. Though Louisville scored a {{touchdown}} early in the quarter, the Hokies' scored 22unanswered points in the final 13 minutes of the game to take a 35–24 lead and earn the win.|$|E
5|$|Levin <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{difficulty}} with his balance {{as early as}} 1988, although Alzheimer's disease was not diagnosed until the early 1990s. From September 1995 his Times column appeared once weekly instead of twice, and in January 1997 the editor, Peter Stothard, concluded, despite a great admiration for Levin, that the weekly column should cease. Levin retired, though he continued to write for the paper occasionally over the next year.|$|E
5|$|Now the strip's sole writer, Wagner {{was free}} {{to return to the}} Democracy theme, this time with a more {{sympathetic}} depiction of Dredd's character in which Dredd <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> misgivings about his role in suppressing the Democratic March. Dredd's qualms would become the catalyst to take the whole Judge Dredd strip in a new direction.|$|E

5|$|Petrović {{worked for}} a number of landlords {{throughout}} Šumadija until 1787, when he and his family left the region and settled in the Austrian Empire, fearing persecution {{at the hands of the}} Ottoman janissaries. It is said that as they were preparing to cross the Danube into Austria, Petrović's father <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> second thoughts about leaving Šumadija. Knowing that the entire family would be put in jeopardy if his father stayed behind, Petrović either took his father's life or arranged for someone to kill him instead.|$|E
5|$|The 1804 treaty {{allowed the}} tribes to {{continue}} using the ceded land {{until it was}} sold to American settlers by the U.S. government. For the next two decades, Sauks continued to live at Saukenuk, their primary village, which was located near {{the confluence of the}} Mississippi and Rock Rivers. In 1828, the U.S. government finally <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the ceded land surveyed for white settlement. Indian agent Thomas Forsyth informed the Sauks that they should vacate Saukenuk and their other settlements east of the Mississippi.|$|E
5|$|The nascent magazine, {{under the}} {{editorial}} control of Armijn and Alisjahbana, was initially poorly received by {{political parties and}} actors; they considered the magazine, which was generally non-political, liable to weaken the nationalist movement by diverting it into less important areas. To guarantee better support, {{people who were not}} writers or literary critics were accepted onto the editorial board. The first, Sumadang, was accepted in 1935. Other politicians involved during the end of the 1930s included Amir Sjarifuddin, Mohamad Sjah, and Sugiarti. During this period the magazine <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a wider scope.|$|E

5|$|Weizenbaum <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> serious ethical {{doubts about}} AI when Kenneth Colby wrote DOCTOR, a chatterbot therapist. Weizenbaum was {{disturbed}} that Colby saw his mindless {{program as a}} serious therapeutic tool. A feud began, and the situation was not helped when Colby did not credit Weizenbaum for his contribution to the program. In 1976, Weizenbaum published Computer Power and Human Reason which argued that the misuse of artificial intelligence {{has the potential to}} devalue human life.|$|E
5|$|A {{company of}} R-2s was {{assigned}} to the Popescu Armoured Detachment after King Michael's Coup and Romanian's defection from the Axis at the end of August 1944. The Detachment was tasked with preventing the German units stationed around Ploiești from breaking out to the north and finding refuge in Hungary. They accomplished their task and the R-2s were withdrawn from combat operations until the following year. Romania had concentrated all of its remaining tanks and armoured fighting vehicles in the 2nd Armoured Regiment in early 1945 as the unofficial Soviet arms embargo <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> effect. It had five R-2s on hand in early February 1945 when it was sent to the front, but the Soviets confiscated most of them when it arrived. Both R-2s were serviceable when the regiment entered Bratislava on 4 April 1945, but these were probably destroyed when the regiment was virtually surrounded in Austria on 10 April because they are no longer listed among the regiment's vehicles afterwards.|$|E
5|$|CTW {{solicited}} the Educational Testing Service (ETS) {{to conduct}} its summative research. CTW and ETS hired and trained coordinators, testers, and observers from local communities to conduct these studies. The most relevant {{tests of the}} show's effectiveness were comparisons between children who watched it regularly {{and those who did}} not. After the first season, however, Sesame Street was so widely watched that it was difficult to make this distinction; ETS <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> problems finding subjects for their non-viewing groups, which weakened the experimental design. It solved this problem by selecting control-group households from areas that did not broadcast the show. Instead of using groups of viewers and non-viewers, later large-scale studies used statistical designs and methods for estimating cause-effect relationships.|$|E

5|$|Following its {{significantly}} increased {{popularity in the}} early 21st century, reality television <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{a significant impact on}} the British music industry. Of the 274 albums that reached number one in the UK charts, 15 were by artists that had found fame through a reality TV programme. The first such act was Hear'Say, a British pop group formed by the television show Popstars. In March 2001, their debut album Popstars topped the chart and became the fastest-selling debut in UK chart history to that date. The only reality television stars to top the album chart with two different releases were Will Young, the 2002 winner of Pop Idol, Girls Aloud, the girl group formed by the TV series , and Leona Lewis, the 2006 winner of The X Factor. Like Hear'Say, Lewis's first album Spirit broke the record for the fastest-selling debut in UK chart history.|$|E
5|$|In 746, {{he moved}} to the capital in an attempt to resurrect his {{official}} career. He took the civil service exam a second time during the following year, but all the candidates were failed by the prime minister (apparently in order to prevent the emergence of possible rivals). He never again attempted the examinations, instead petitioning the emperor directly in 751, 754 and probably again in 755. He married around 752, and by 757 the couple had had five children—three sons and two daughters—but one of the sons died in infancy in 755. From 754 he <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> lung problems (probably asthma), {{the first of a series}} of ailments which dogged him for the rest of his life. It was in that year that Du Fu was forced to move his family due to the turmoil of a famine brought about by massive floods in the region.|$|E
5|$|In early March 1704 Beatrix Laing {{approached}} Patrick Morton, a 16-year-old {{working in}} his father's smithy, {{to ask if he}} would make her some nails. Morton refused as he was already assigned an urgent task making nails for a merchant's ship in the harbour. Displeased, Laing left threatening revenge on him. The following day Morton noticed a bucket filled with water and burning coal outside Laing's house; he thought it was there to cast a spell on him. Laing had a reputation as a witch having already appeared before the Kirk session in 1696 for charming. Morton immediately felt weak and had difficulty standing or walking. His health deteriorated; he <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> fits and convulsions, his stomach became distended and his body was rigid and twisted. People claimed they could see marks left on his skin by fingernails where Morton said he had been pinched. He refused food and his breathing was laboured.|$|E
