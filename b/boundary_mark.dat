25|$|Cadover Cross {{is located}} on Wigford Down, about 250metres north-west of Cadover Bridge on the minor road between Plympton and Yelverton. Two {{important}} 12th century routes used the river crossing here: one leading from Tavistock to Plympton Priory, the other to Ivybridge via Cornwood, so {{it is likely that}} the cross existed then. The first documentary evidence for it is a mention as a <b>boundary</b> <b>mark</b> in 1381.|$|E
2500|$|According to the Waitangi Tribunal, the Fitzroy block {{deal was}} less a {{purchase}} than a [...] "political settlement {{based on the}} reality that there were already settlers on the land, {{who had to be}} either accepted or driven out ... (the sale was) more akin to a treaty, because Maori also imposed two significant conditions. The first was that settlers still outside the Fitzroy block would be brought back into it and the second was that the settlers would expand no further." [...] A 12-metre high <b>boundary</b> <b>mark,</b> known as the FitzRoy Pole, was later erected {{on the banks of the}} Waiwakaiho River to indicate the limit of Pākehā settlement.|$|E
2500|$|The Sifre {{asked why}} [...] says, [...] "You shall not remove your neighbor's landmark," [...] when [...] already says, [...] "You shall not rob." [...] The Sifre {{explained}} that [...] teaches that one who removes a neighbor's <b>boundary</b> <b>mark</b> violates two negative commandments. The Sifre further explained that lest one {{think that this}} conclusion applies outside the Land of Israel, [...] says, [...] "in your inheritance that you will inherit in the land," [...] indicating that only in the Land of Israel would one violate two negative commandments. Outside the Land of Israel, one would violate only the one commandment of [...] "You shall not rob." [...] The Sifre further taught that one violates the command of [...] not to move a neighbor's landmark (1) if one moves an Israelite's landmark, (2) if one substitutes the statement of Eliezer ben Hurcanus for that of Rabbi Joshua or vice versa, or (3) if one sells a burial plot purchased by an ancestor.|$|E

60|$|Walking over sown land, or {{sending a}} woman of your mundium to do so, in {{accordance}} with an ancient superstition, is a severe offence; so is injuring a vineyard, or taking more than tres uvae (bunches of grapes, I presume) from the vine.

6000|$|Dr. Munro, however, [...] "sees {{nothing against}} the supposition" [...] that [...] "Dr. Murray is right," [...] but Dr. Munro's {{remarks about the}} {{hypothesis}} of modern cairns, as a theory [...] "against which he sees nothing," [...] have the air of being an inadvertent obiter dictum. For, in his conclusion and summing up he writes, [...] "We claim to have established that the structures of Dunbuie, Dumbuck, and Langbank are remains of inhabited sites of the early-Iron Age, dating to some time between the fifth and twelfth centuries." [...] {46a} I accept this conclusion, and will say as little as may be about the theory of a modern origin of the sites, finally discarded by Dr. Munro. I say [...] "discarded," [...] for his {{theory is that the}} modern corporation utilised an earlier structure as a cairn or beacon, or <b>boundary</b> <b>mark,</b> which is perfectly possible. But, if this occurred, it does not affect the question, for this use of the structure has left no traces of any kind. There are no relics, except relics of the fifth (?) to twelfth (?) centuries.|$|E
60|$|Adam {{had on his}} working-dress again, now, for he {{had thrown}} off the other {{with a sense of}} relief as soon as he came home; and if he had had the basket of tools over his shoulder, he might have been taken, with his pale wasted face, for the spectre of the Adam Bede who entered the Grove on that August evening eight months ago. But he had no basket of tools, and he was not walking with the old erectness, looking keenly round him; his hands were thrust in his side pockets, and his eyes rested chiefly on the ground. He had not long entered the Grove, and now he paused before a beech. He knew that tree well; it was the <b>boundary</b> <b>mark</b> of his youth--the sign, to him, of the time when some of his earliest, strongest {{feelings}} had left him. He felt sure they would never return. And yet, at this moment, there was a stirring of affection at the remembrance of that Arthur Donnithorne whom he had believed in before he had come up to this beech eight months ago. It was affection for the dead: THAT Arthur existed no longer.|$|E
