5000|$|Known as the Autobuggy from 1906 to 1908, it {{was billed}} as [...] "the {{cheapest}} high-grade car in America", and was available with [...] two-cylinder and [...] four-cylinder engines, friction drive, and pneumatic or solid tires. The drive system used a cone and two <b>bevel</b> <b>wheels,</b> one for forward {{and the other for}} reverse. This allowed it to reach its 30 mph top speed in either direction. A larger engine was fitted in 1908, and the wheelbase grew from 72 in to 90 in. Its high ground clearance made it popular in rural areas.|$|R
50|$|The Daimler Company began {{production}} of motor boats in 1897 from its manufacturing base in Coventry. The engines had two cylinders and the explosive charge of petroleum and air was ignited by compression into a heated platinum tube. The engine gave about six horse-power. The petrol was fed by air pressure {{to a large}} surface carburettor and also an auxiliary tank which supplied the burners for heating the ignition tubes. Reversal of the propeller was effected by means of two <b>bevel</b> friction <b>wheels</b> which engaged with two larger <b>bevel</b> friction <b>wheels,</b> the intermediate shaft being temporarily disconnected for this purpose. It was not until 1901 that a safer apparatus for igniting the fuel with an electric spark was used in motor boats.|$|R

50|$|The {{steam engine}} {{was located in}} a brick {{building}} built against the north-east side of the windmill, and drove two pairs of millstones, a centrifugal governor, and a sack hoist. The steam driven millstones were located on 2 levels and driven by a 2+1/2 in square shaft of 50 ft length, those on the upper floor being driven by a cast-iron <b>bevel</b> <b>wheel</b> with wooden cog inserts. It was also able to work various dressing machines in the windmill, but not the wind driven stones. There is some difference over the exact type of engine, it being variously described as a grasshopper engine built by Napiers, and a Cornish boiler by Davey Paxman & Co. Both sources agree that the engine had formerly been used in a Thames steamboat. The steam engine itself was removed in 1940 and taken to South West Essex Technical College in Walthamstow, while the building and remaining contents were removed in 1960 {{with two of the}} millstones remaining at the windmill entrance.|$|E
50|$|Transmission {{was through}} a {{single plate clutch}} to a {{separately}} mounted four speed gearbox. The rear axle was unconventional with the differential mounted ahead of the axle. The spiral <b>bevel</b> crown <b>wheel</b> and pinion arrangement had two crown wheels each attached to a half shaft allowing them to be arranged {{at an angle to}} each other to give the rear wheels a positive camber.|$|R
50|$|During the First World War the Steiger firm {{repaired}} aeroplanes and aeroplane engines. In 1917 {{the owner}} and his engineer, Paul Henze, began to work on motorized vehicles. Plans for the manufacture of tractors were abandoned in favour {{of the development of}} automobiles. Their first model, the Steiger 10/50 PS, was produced in 1920. This touring model with a 2.6 litre four cylinder engine (50 hp / 37 kW) became Steiger’s most significant product, and was still in production when the firm collapsed in 1926. Its modern OHC engine was distinctive because of an overhead camshaft driven by spiral-toothed <b>bevel</b> gear <b>wheels.</b> These cars, with ‘u’ shaped pressed steel frames, two axles with leaf spring suspension and a pointed radiator, were considered to be the most significant technical innovation of the early 1920s and the most progressive German serially-produced cars of their time.|$|R
40|$|Defining {{manufacturing}} tolerances {{is an important}} task for a process planner before starting production of a new product or introducing new processes. One of the more complex processes to handle is the heat treatment of gears. Press quenching is a heat treatment method where the gear is mechanically forced to keep or attain the desired geometry, with less geometrical distortions in comparison to oil bath quenching. The objective {{of this paper is}} to discover how design of experiments can be used to scrutinize press quenching of bevel gears. The first part of this investigation shows how different process parameter settings influence geometry of the bevel gear. Based on the results of the experiments, predictions and statistical simulations, the outcome of the press quenching process can be estimated. Estimations for the number of defect parts then form the basis for evaluating whether the proposed tolerances meet the quality requirements. The work is based on an industrial case where 55 <b>bevel</b> gear crown <b>wheels</b> for heavy trucks are carburized and then case hardened in a Gleason press quenching machine.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The process for coating functional surfaces of symmetrically toothed components such as tooth flanks (3) of toothed wheels (1) using a coating source (2) rotating relative to the component and emitting a coating material in the form of electrically charged particles in the direction of the component, comprises shielding the component during the coating process in a peripheral area with a flat functional surface alignment inclined to a beam direction through an aperture (4) from coating beam arranged between the component and coating source transverse to the beam direction. The component and the coating source are rotated relative to each other around a component axis irregularly with longer dwell times in the rotating position of the functional surfaces steeply engaged to the beam direction. The component is completely coated on half-side over the limit of the peripheral area through the aperture for single-side functional surface coating of the component. The coating is carried out with ion beam or plasma beam. The coating beam is deflected and/or bundled with magnetic and/or electric field. For toothed flanks coating of the bevel wheels, the <b>bevel</b> <b>wheel</b> is rotated around a bevel axis during the coating process and the bevel axis is obliquely engaged in the direction of the coating source. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for a device for coating functional surfaces of symmetrically toothed components such as tooth flanks of toothed wheels. USE - Process for coating functional surfaces of symmetrically toothed components such as tooth flanks of toothed wheels. ADVANTAGE - The process is capable of simply and effectively coating the functional surfaces of the components with high-quality in a less time-consuming manner...|$|E
5000|$|The concentrating {{machine for}} slimes, which has {{hitherto}} {{been a great}} favourite, is the round buddle, and this was perhaps due to the great simplicity of its construction, which permitted its being made out of the odds and ends of machinery usually to be found on a mine. The fixed and revolving cast-iron heads, shafting, <b>bevel</b> <b>wheels,</b> and driving pulleys, are usually procured from a firm of machinery makers.The buddle itself consists of a shallow circular pit formed in the ground from 14 ft. to 22 ft. diameter, and from 1 ft. to 1½ ft. deep. The poorer the slimes the greater the diameter, and as the product from the buddle always requires re-treatment, it is usual to concentrate first in a machine of small diameter, and then to re-treat the concentrates thus produced in one of a larger diameter. The sides of the buddle pit are formed of stone or brick, set in mortar, and the floor, which has an inclination outwards of 1 in 30, is made either of smooth planed boards or cement run upon a layer of concrete. The centre head is from 6 ft. to 10 ft. in diameter, and may even be less. A revolving head is fixed to the shaft, and this carries four arms. The revolving head receives the slime waters from the trough, and distributes them on an even layer over the fixed head the liquid stream, which {{should be in a}} uniform thin film, falls {{over the edge of the}} fixed head, and distributes itself outwards over the sloping floor of the buddle towards the circumference, depositing in its passage the rich ore it contains, according to its specific gravity, the richest first, close to the fixed head, and the poorest at the circumference. To each of the four arms a board is attached, carrying a cloth or a series of brushes, which sweep round and smooth out each successive layer of mineral as soon as it is formed. In some cases sprays of fresh water are used instead of the cloths or brushes, the number of revolutions in either case being 3 or 4 per minute.The outflow of the waste waters takes place through the small sluice gate shown in the circumference of the huddle. In the door of this sluice is a vertical line of holes, and, as the layer of mineral thickens on the floor, a plug is placed in the lowest hole, and so successively up the series, until the full thickness of the deposit equal to the height of the cone is reached. At this point the machine is stopped, a groove is cut from the cone to the circumference, and samples of the ore are taken and washed on a vanning shovel. By this means an idea is formed as to where the divisions should be made for at the head the concentrates are rich in galena, and then follow the mixed ores, either of galena, blende, and gangue, if blende is present, or of galena and gangue, if it is absent. Two qualities of the mixed ores are formed. Rings are formed around the deposit on the buddle to indicate the division lines. The rich heads are taken out and reworked once in another buddle, when they will be rich enough to be sent to the dolly tub. The middles are likewise re-treated, the ores of approximately the same percentage being treated in the same machine until all the mineral is abstracted, and the waste contains not more than ½ per cent. of lead, and 1 to 1½ per cent. of zinc. By successive re-treatment the minerals may thus be enriched up to 50 to 60 per cent. Pb., and when blende is present, to about 42 per cent. Zn. These concentrates may either be sold as they are, or further enriched in a dolly tub.The great drawbacks to the round buddle are the facts that no clean products can be made straight away. The mineral must be handled several times, always a costly proceeding, and the machine must be stopped when full, and lie idle until emptied. A large number of buddles are always required to cope with the slimes from even a small mill, while in large mills, especially when blende is present, from sixteen to twenty would be needed.|$|R
40|$|Ceramic fibers {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} categories of reinforcements for composite materials. This study deals with a novel melt extraction system which has been developed to produce fine oxide ceramic fibers. Four oxide compounds were selected for the production of fibers and characterization of the extraction system. These compounds were CaO-$ rm Al sb 2 O sb 3 $ (CA), ZrO$ sb 2 $-$ rm Al sb 2 O sb 3 $ (ZA), ZrO$ sb 2 $-$ rm Al sb 2 O sb 3 $-SiO$ sb 2 $ (ZAS), and ZrO$ sb 2 $-$ rm Al sb 2 O sb 3 $-TiO$ sb 2 $ (ZAT). Using a 150 W CO$ sb 2 $ laser, these materials were melted to obtain a small molten drop, and through shallow contact with a sharpened and <b>bevelled</b> molybdenum <b>wheel,</b> fibers were extracted at various wheel velocities. At low speeds (v 000 $ sp circ$C) was measured using a novel technique. Various parameters such as laser power (temperature), wheel tip radius and feed rate have been studied and their effects on the extracted fiber dimensions were investigated. It is suggested that momentum transfer controls the extracted layer thickness and fiber dimensions. The viscosity of the liquid ceramics is a crucial factor in the system, and is estimated to be $<$ 0. 5 poise (0. 05 Pa$ cdot$s) at ${ approx} 2400 sp circ$C. Due to the fine fiber dimensions and strong conductive cooling of the molybdenum wheel, the extracted liquid layer was rapidly solidified, and fibers with amorphous, partially crystalline and/or metastable phases were formed. Uniform diameter fibers were amorphous, transparent, flexible and exhibited excellent tensile properties. Fine fibers with a diameter of ${ approx}$ 10 $ mu$m showed tensile strengths up to 3300 MPa, however, only moderate elastic moduli were achieved (95 - 143 GPa) due to the amorphous nature of the fibers. The rapidly solidified fibers were thermodynamically metastable, and as shown by differential thermal analysis (DTA), they devitrified in the temperature range of 930 - 980 $ sp circ$C. Heating the fibers at higher temperatures resulted in the formation of various crystalline phases and the development of different grain morphologies...|$|R
