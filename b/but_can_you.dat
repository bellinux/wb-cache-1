500|$|Since [...] "Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da" [...] {{was not a}} {{song that}} McCartney's bandmates enjoyed recording, the motive behind Harrison's {{appropriation}} of the title has invited speculation. Author Jeffrey Roessner considers it significant that Harrison mispronounces the title; in addition, he contends that the full statement – [...] "We all know Ob-la-di-bla-da / <b>But</b> <b>can</b> <b>you</b> show me where you are?" [...] – serves {{as an example of}} Harrison, like Lennon, mocking those listeners who obsessively scanned the Beatles' lyrics for [...] "clues". Music journalist Robert Fontenot interprets the lines as an expression of distaste for [...] "Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da", since Harrison and Lennon were openly critical of McCartney's composition.|$|E

Later in the year, Timbaland was {{featured on the}} deluxe edition of Chris Brown's album, F.A.M.E., producing the songs [...] "Paper, Scissors, Rock" [...] (feat. Big Sean) and the Japan-only bonus track, [...] "Talk Ya Ear Off". Timbaland was also featured on David Guetta's LP, Nothing But the Beat, on [...] "I Just Wanna F." [...] with Dev and Afrojack. Timbaland also worked with teen star Demi Lovato; he produced and had a small feature in her song [...] "All Night Long" [...] on Lovato's Unbroken album. In November 2010, Timbaland {{announced that he would}} be releasing a new song every Thursday, called Timbo Thursdays; a copy of the initiative shown by artists such as Kanye West (via G.O.O.D. Fridays), and Swizz Beatz (via Monster Mondays). In an interview with Rap-Up.com Timbaland stated, [...] "So, my brother told me Kanye is puttin' out a new song every Friday called G.O.O.D. Fridays, Swizz got Mondays, I don't know if they are on Twitter <b>but</b> <b>can</b> <b>you</b> hit them up, and tell them reserve that Thursday for Timbo the king baby. We’ll call it Timbo Thursday, cool?" ...|$|E

2500|$|During {{the second}} episode of series sixteen, Hammond {{suggested}} {{that no one}} would ever want to own a Mexican car, since cars are supposed to reflect national characteristics and so a Mexican car would be [...] "lazy, feckless, flatulent, overweight, leaning against a fence, asleep, looking at a cactus with a blanket with a hole in the middle on as a coat." [...] Hammond finished with the remark [...] "I'm sorry, <b>but</b> <b>can</b> <b>you</b> imagine waking up and remembering you're Mexican?!" [...] Following complaints, the BBC defended the broadcast of this segment on the grounds that such national stereotyping was a [...] "robust part" [...] of traditional British humour.|$|E
2500|$|The {{term was}} coined by Angular Records founder Joe Daniel and was {{featured}} on the [...] "An Angular Disco" [...] flyer used to advertise Klaxons's first gig. Klaxons later declared they were not new rave, describing it as a [...] "joke that's got out of hand" [...] and that the term was originally ironic, not serious. In reaction to the media overkill of the [...] "genre", Klaxons banned the use of glowsticks at their gigs in April 2007, saying that [...] "We kept getting asked to explain it. The whole idea of new rave {{was to take the}} piss out of the media by making them talk about something that didn't exist, just for our own amusement. And they'd say, I appreciate that, <b>but</b> <b>can</b> <b>you</b> tell me more about new rave?" [...] Los Angeles Times critic Margaret Wappler comments that the [...] "minimalist dance-punk of LCD Soundsystem, the analog classicism of Simian Mobile Disco, the fanatical electro-thrash of Justice, the international amalgam of M.I.A., the agitated funk of [...] (Chk Chk Chk) and the art-schooled disco-sleaze of Cansei de Ser Sexy" [...] contributed to the thriving 'new rave' dance scene, which led to a rediscovery of indie rockers, and a critical and intellectual revolution in dance music.|$|E
