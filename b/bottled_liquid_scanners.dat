50|$|Ethylene oxide {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} raw materials used in large-scale chemical production. Most ethylene oxide is used for synthesis of ethylene glycols, including diethylene glycol and triethylene glycol, that accounts for up to 75% of global consumption. Other important products include ethylene glycol ethers, ethanolamines and ethoxylates. Among glycols, ethylene glycol is used as antifreeze, in the production of polyester and polyethylene terephthalate (PET - raw material for plastic <b>bottles),</b> <b>liquid</b> coolants and solvents.|$|R

50|$|Selected-ion flow-tube mass {{spectrometry}} (SIFT-MS) is a quantitative {{mass spectrometry}} technique for trace gas analysis which involves the chemical ionization of trace volatile compounds by selected positive precursor ions during a well-defined time period along a flow tube.

Total luminescence spectra were recorded by measuring the emission spectra in the range 300 – 700 nm at excitation wavelengths from 250 to 590 nm. Discrimination of teas based on their spectral data was performed by principal component analysis, a common chemometric method used for data reduction and visualisation. The results demonstrate the ability of fluorescence techniques to differentiate between green tea (unfermented), black tea (fermented) and oolong tea (partially fermented) ...|$|R

40|$|A {{study of}} the substituents {{electronic}} effects on the methanogenic toxicity of aromatic compounds was realized at room temperature using the standard method of serum bottles. The pig digested manure and sodium acetate (pH 7) were used as inoculum and substrate, respectively.

The obtained results indicate a correlation between {{the nature of the}} substituents on the aromatic ring and their inhibitory effects on the biosynthesis of the methane gas by the acetoclastic methanogenic bacteria.

40|$|Beverage {{lines are}} very common {{installations}} in food production industry.

The present paper concentrates {{on the process of}} bottling. It aims filling the bottles with beverages such as beer or any kind of carbonized soft drink. For the purposes of bottling, it is essential, a constant liquid pressure in the bottle to be provided. This can be achieved by numerous of ways listed below. Providing constant fluid pressure for the bottling machine is the main problem treated by the present work. The method used depends on manipulating the hydrostatic pressure of the liquid in a tank. A controller is designed, particularly for this purpose. It serves as a relay regulator of fluid level in a container, keeping it between two values (minimum and maximum) ...|$|R
40|$|Fast and {{reliable}} identification of liquids {{is of great}} importance in, for example, security, biology and the beverage industry. An unambiguous identification of liquids {{can be made by}} electromagnetic measurements of their dielectric functions in the frequency range of their main dispersions, but this frequency range, from a few GHz to a few THz, is not covered by any conventional spectroscopy. We have developed a concept of liquid identification based on our new Hilbert spectroscopy and high-T-c Josephson junctions, which can operate at the intermediate range from microwaves to THz frequencies. A demonstration setup has been developed consisting of a polychromatic radiation source and a compact Hilbert spectrometer integrated in a Stirling cryocooler. Reflection polychromatic spectra of various <b>bottled</b> <b>liquids</b> have been measured at the spectral range of 15 - 300 GHz with total scanning time down to 0. 2 s and identification of liquids has been demonstrated...|$|R
