50|$|Curly {{pondweed}} {{is widespread}} and common across {{most of its}} native range, growing in standing and slow-flowing water including small ponds and ditches. It is strictly a lowland plant and requires fine substrates in standing or slow-flowing calcareous water. However, it is tolerant of significant nutrient pollution, and this has allowed it to persist in intensively farmed areas where more sensitive pondweeds have declined. Its production of both seed and turions makes it resistant to disturbance such as dredging, in contrast {{to some of the}} larger <b>broad-leaved</b> <b>pondweeds.</b>|$|R
50|$|The most {{interesting}} feature ecologically is {{a chain of}} old ponds. Starting from the east, they are Burnham's Pond, Warren Pond, Long Pond, Ellern Mede Pond and Pink Cottage Pond. They vary in character, but all have interesting wetland flora, and most are valuable for dragonflies, other invertebrates and amphibians. Plants to be found {{around the edges of}} the ponds include lesser spearwort, trifid bur-marigold and fool's watercress (Apium nodiflorum). In deeper water, white water-lily and curled and <b>broad-leaved</b> <b>pondweeds</b> can be found. Long Pond is used for angling.|$|R
25|$|P. perfoliatus {{grows in}} a wide range of {{freshwater}} habitats including lakes, rivers and streams, large ponds, canals and larger drains and ditches. It does not tolerate drying out, and the most robust plants tend to occur in >1 m water depth. Unlike most other <b>broad-leaved</b> <b>pondweeds</b> it is reasonably tolerant of water flow and so can use running waters to a significant extent. It is not especially sensitive to water chemistry provided that the water remains reasonably clear and is not too base-poor, occurring in such diverse habitats as exposed Scottish lochs and lowland fenland rivers. However, at high nutrient concentrations it is vulnerable to shading from phytoplankton and epiphytic algae and filamentous algae. It may also grow in brackish or estuarine habitats, notably in Chesapeake Bay. However, elevated salt concentrations have a negative effect on both growth and flowering.|$|R
5000|$|Potamogeton natans (<b>broad-leaved</b> <b>pondweed,</b> {{floating}} pondweed, floating-leaf pondweed) is an aquatic {{species in}} the genus Potamogeton native to quiet or slow-flowing freshwater habitats throughout the Holarctic Kingdom.|$|E
50|$|DNA {{analysis}} {{indicates that}} P. lucens {{is one of}} the <b>broad-leaved</b> <b>pondweed</b> clade (section Potamogeton) and is probably most closely related to P. gramineus and the North American P. illinoensis.|$|E
50|$|Potamogeton amplifolius, {{commonly}} known as largeleaf pondweed or <b>broad-leaved</b> <b>pondweed,</b> is an aquatic plant of North America. It grows in water bodies such as lakes, ponds, and rivers, often in deep water.|$|E
25|$|Potamogeton alpinus {{generally}} {{grows in}} neutral to mildly acid (but not very base-poor) water bodies such as lakes, slow-moving rivers and streams, and ponds. P. alpinus needs a deep fine substrate such as sand, silt or peat to root in {{and appears to}} avoid exposed situations. It is, mainly restricted to fairly nutrient-poor waters. In European rivers, it is associated with high quality environments. In a large-scale study of the plant communities of 3447 British lakes, red pondweed was found in 169, with a preference for circumneutral, moderate alkalinity lakes. Unlike other <b>broad-leaved</b> <b>pondweeds,</b> the stolons of red pondweed die back in winter, leaving constellations of resting buds rooted in the substrate, which regrow in spring. In rivers, red pondweed can persist entirely by asexual means (rooting of stem fragments and turion-like resting bodies, and growth in summer) though this may reflect weed cutting suppressing flowering and seed set.|$|R
50|$|In Britain, it {{has shown}} {{the same pattern of}} decline as other <b>broad-leaved</b> <b>pondweeds</b> such as P. praelongus and P. alpinus, with most losses {{occurring}} in southern Britain, and is now classed as near threatened in England. This likely reflects increasing eutrophication, canalization of rivers leading to loss of backwater habitats and other floodplain standing waters, and degradation or loss of pond and lake habitats. P. gramineus may also grow in open reedbeds, and the loss of traditional reed cutting practices may have caused the loss of populations from this habitat. It is Critically Endangered in the Czech Republic, Endangered in Germany, Flanders and Switzerland, Near Threatened in the Netherlands, and scarce and of conservation importance in Spain. Local extinction has also been recorded in Lower Saxony between 1948 and 1986. In the USA, P. gramineus is listed as Threatened in Illinois and Endangered in Ohio and Pennsylvania.|$|R

40|$|Since 1987 the {{distribution}} of many plant species in the central and eastern parts of the province Noord-Brabant has been mapped for country use planning by the Provincial Authorities. Distribution maps (with a 5 x 5 km² grid) of the Potamogeton (<b>broad-leaved</b> <b>pondweed)</b> species, which are important indicators of water quality, are presented and compared with data of previous periods. It is obvious that several Potamogeton species suffered a decline, whereas others have increased. Potamogeton nodosus, a species so far restricted to large rivers, turned up at considerable distance from a river as a side-effect of water-intake from the river Meuse, meant to restore the local desiccation. Potamogeton praelongus was recorded in this province {{for the first time}} since 1920...|$|E
30|$|In Sweden, Nyström and Strand [22] {{compared}} grazing {{behavior of}} native noble crayfish and invasive signal crayfish on seedlings and adult macrophytes. Seedlings and adult plants of tule (Scirpus lacustris) and <b>broad-leaved</b> <b>pondweed</b> (Potamogeton natans) {{as well as}} Chara vulgaris were offered to both species. Chara vulgaris was preferred over other plant species. Signal crayfish consumed significantly more Chara than noble crayfish—especially at higher temperatures. Results indicate that signal crayfish are the more voracious grazers with a larger negative impact. Chara seems to be particularly vulnerable since it is preferred by crayfish and the genus contains {{a large number of}} rare species. The occurrence of signal crayfish thus harbors a higher risk of reduction or even extinction of submersed plants than that of the native and less voracious noble crayfish [22].|$|E
40|$|Water {{tables in}} the Netherlands have been greatly lowered in recent decades, largely in order to favour {{agricultural}} activities. Drought and increased nitrate (NO 3 -) leaching from agricultural land lead to oxidation of iron-sulphide (FeSx) in the subsoil, resulting in increased sulphate (SO 42 -) concentrations in the groundwater. In addition, increased atmospheric sulphur (S) deposition and leaching of SO 42 - from agricultural land have increased SO 42 - concentrations in the groundwater. Attempts to retain groundwater in desiccated wetlands by simply damming drainage ditches have resulted in greatly increased retention times of the water, die-back of the original vegetation and massive development of algae and lemnids in summer. In order to determine whether stagnation of SO 42 [...] rich groundwater {{plays an important role}} in eutrophication, nine bottomless enclosures were placed in the sediment of an open water body to block the supply of groundwater. Na 2 SO 4 was added to three enclosures twice a year to simulate a minimised input of SO 42 [...] rich groundwater. In addition NaCl was added to three enclosures, while three enclosures were left untreated. (Pore) water quality and vegetation development were compared with those at seepage-fed sites outside the enclosures. The results show that stagnating SO 42 [...] rich groundwater led to increased SO 42 - reduction in the sediment, resulting in phosphate (o-PO 43 -) mobilisation from the sediment and eutrophication of the water layer, due to the interference of S 2 - with the iron-phosphorous cycle. This was accompanied by massive growth of common duckweed (Lemna minor) and filamentous algae and a decreased growth of <b>broad-leaved</b> <b>pondweed</b> (Potamogeton natans). The consistently high input of SO(4) 2 - via seepage did not lead to eutrophication. The results indicated that SO 42 - reduction rates at sites fed by seepage were very low. This was probably caused by the consistently high input of Fe and NO 3 - via the groundwater, which prevents reduction of SO 42 - by providing energetically more favourable electron acceptors. In fens with stagnating groundwater, Fe and NO 3 - will be rapidly depleted, stimulating SO 42 - reduction resulting in development of toxic S 2 - concentrations and eutrophication of the water layer...|$|E
