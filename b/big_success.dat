5|$|Development {{within the}} Albert Dock was rapid {{and the newly}} renovated Edward Pavilion (formerly north east stack) was ready {{in time for the}} 1984 Cutty Sark Tall Ship Race. The race was a <b>big</b> <b>success</b> for the city with over one million {{visitors}} into Liverpool over a period of four days, of which 160,000 visited the Albert Dock. In total it is estimated that the two flagship regeneration schemes of the MDC, the tall ships race and International Garden Festival, attracted over 3.5 million visitors to Liverpool in 1984. Also completed in 1984 was the renovation of the dock traffic office, which was fitted out and leased to Granada Television.|$|E

The band's first album, Burn My Eyes, was a <b>big</b> <b>success</b> in Europe where it garnered attention on MTV's Headbangers Ball. In America (with HBB taken off the air during the grunge movement) Machine Head would not have success until later albums.|$|E

The film grossed $49 million worldwide (2008 equivalent of $1.5 million in the 1930s). It was the second most popular film at the British box office in 1935-36.|$|E
5|$|The next Gilbert and Sullivan opera, Patience, {{opened at}} the Opera Comique in April 1881 and was another <b>big</b> <b>success,</b> usurping Pinafore's {{position}} as the longest running piece in the series with the second-longest run in musical theatre history. Patience satirised the self-indulgent aesthetic movement of the 1870s and '80s in England. To popularise the opera in America, in 1882 Carte sent one of the artistes under his management, the young poet Oscar Wilde, on a lecture tour to explain to Americans what the aesthetic movement was about. Carte told an interviewer {{at that time that}} he had fifteen theatrical companies and performers touring simultaneously in Europe, America and Australia.|$|E
5|$|The piece premiered in New York {{rather than}} London, in an (unsuccessful) attempt {{to secure the}} American copyright, and was another <b>big</b> <b>success</b> with both critics and audiences. Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte tried {{for many years to}} control the American {{performance}} copyrights over their operas, without success. Nevertheless, Pirates was a hit both in New York, again spawning numerous imitators, and then in London, and it {{became one of the most}} frequently performed, translated and parodied Gilbert and Sullivan works, also enjoying successful 1981 Broadway and 1982 West End revivals by Joseph Papp that continue to influence productions of the opera.|$|E

5|$|According to a podcast {{interview}} with Chris Jericho, Copeland {{said that he}} did not initially like the idea of the ladder match and even told WWE management not to include him on the Wrestlemania 21 card altogether. However, he was talked into competing by the other participants like Jericho and Glenn Jacobs (Kane) who said the match had {{the potential to be a}} <b>big</b> <b>success.</b> At Backlash, Edge defeated Chris Benoit in a Last Man Standing match to end the feud. Several weeks after, Edge was then paired with Lita, his real-life girlfriend at the time, in an angle in which she betrayed her storyline husband Kane, by costing him a number-one contender match for the World Heavyweight Championship. Edge faced even more scorn from fans due to this relationship, which lasted over a year. The next week, Edge received his World Heavyweight Championship match against Batista, which he lost. Edge started a feud with Kane leading to several matches between them including one at Vengeance, when Edge lost to Kane. After trading several victories on Raw, the feud ended in a stretcher match on the July 25 episode of Raw that Edge won, but shortly after, Kane performed a tombstone piledriver on Lita.|$|E
5|$|Jardine {{planned to}} use Verity to contain the batsmen and prevent them scoring runs, while the fast bowlers rested. However, Verity was not {{expected}} to be a <b>big</b> <b>success</b> on the tour. The good batting conditions, the aggressive Australian approach to playing spin bowlers and Verity's lack of experience led critics to dismiss his potential contribution to the English bowling attack, but Verity had a successful start to the tour. Assisted by overnight rain, he took seven for 37, including the wicket of Don Bradman, against a Combined XI, comprising some of the best Australian players. In the following game, against South Australia, Verity took eight wickets, including five for 42 in the second innings. By now, the press had begun to pay attention to Verity's achievements, and former Australian batsman Clem Hill expressed his admiration for Verity. Selected for the first Test on the strength of his early tour performances, Verity bowled just 17overs in the game, mainly being used to give the fast bowlers a rest. He did not take any wickets and Verity himself believed he had bowled poorly. England won the match, using Bodyline tactics which had first been used earlier in the tour. After the Test, the tourists travelled to Tasmania to play two matches against the state team. Verity played in the second, and although rain interrupted play, restricting Verity to five overs, he scored his first half-century in first-class cricket. However, he was left out of the team for the second Test and was replaced by Bill Bowes. England played four fast bowlers but Jardine had misjudged the playing surface; the Australian spinners were very effective on a slow-paced pitch and Australia levelled the series.|$|E
