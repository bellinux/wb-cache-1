This article offers the first systematic and comparative analysis of the role of electoral institutions in shaping county-level allocations of SIF. Drawing on theories of distributive politics and federalism, this article argues that electoral institutions provide politicians in the executive branch of national government with incentives to use at least a part of the SIF to buy votes in NUTS 3 -level counties, whereby vote-buying is more common under majority voting than under proportional representation. The results of a statistical analysis of SIF allocations across 202 Italian and French NUTS 3 -level counties during 2007 – 13 confirm this argument.

To device a means by which the budgetary system could be applied meaningfully and advantageously, linking the conventional/traditional methodology to the neo-supra system. To highlight outstanding advantages of priority-based-budgeting, when cautiously applied and strictly adhered by its norms. It is a neolithic advent of budgeting implementation. Priority-based-budgeting is a non-conventional <b>budgetary</b> <b>implementation,</b> hence, its data collection is marred by myopic tendency of the budget segment of the concerned organization. Data procurement has been a stumbling block due to unfamiliarity of the system to the public sector as well as private segment of the economy. A structured questionnaire was adopted to harness the concept of priority-based-budgeting as a focus to the respondents.

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} growth and {{composition}} of Federal Government spending in Malaysia during the Post-New Economic Policy era, with a comprehensive approach and analytical outlook. Between 1970 and 1997 the {{compound annual growth rate}} of total government expenditure was estimated at 11. 3 percent. During the 1970 s and 1980 s, a fiscal imbalance in expenditure pattern emerged as a result of excessive growth in operating expenditure against that of developing expenditure. Government spending as percentage of GNP declinedfvom 34. 1 percent in 1990 to 20. 3 percent in 1997. In a relative sense, this suggests that Malaysia currently has the smallest government involvement, even compared to Japan and the USA's market-oriented mixed economies. The expenditure pattern and policy of the Malaysian government reveals its real concern for the social sector development and eradication of poverty, besides sound fiscal fundamentals contained in surplus budgets in recent years. Our study, however, suggests that economizing in government spending is more important than budgetary curtailment. The government should appoint an advisory Public Expenditure Committee, and publish a 'White Paper' on spending programmes on a regular basis. The fiscal management may further be improved by incorporating 'rolling expenditure programming' in the <b>budgetary</b> <b>implementation.</b> The on-going fiscal reforms should be made more effective to establish a prudent government sector with enhanced efficiency and productivity...|$|E
40|$|Using {{real-time}} {{data from the}} annual budgets over the period 1958 - 2009, we explore <b>budgetary</b> planning and <b>implementation</b> in the Netherlands. Three fiscal policy regimes are distinguished. Our key findings are the following. First, plans are on average unbiased, although they are overoptimistic during earlier parts of our sample and overly pessimistic during the later parts of our sample, when revenues are under-projected. Second, general economic conditions {{and the state of}} the public finances are important determinants of both plans and their implementation. Third, this is also the case for political and institutional factors. Expenditure overruns are partly related to political factors, whereas cautious revenue forecasts relate to the institutional setting. Fourth, under the most recent regime of "trend-based budgeting" implementation was strongest relative to planning. In fact, this regime may contain some elements that are useful for designing national fiscal arrangements elsewhere...|$|R
30|$|The {{approach}} to strategy and external threats is to stage internal workshops, use embedded expertise in scenario analysis, ‘stress test’ the plans {{not only in}} the business-as-usual context but also for when things are unusual, and supplement with independent review. Strategy and external threats are poorly quantifiable, so they are uncertainties rather than risks. On most projects the ESIAs, environmental authorizations, ESMPs and day-to-day management poorly cover strategy and external threats. Managing the project affected people on LHWP is an exception. Hundreds of households were relocated, water and sanitation programs instituted, living standards maintained, and advice given on investing compensation payments, not without shortcomings and failings, but with policy formulation, planning, <b>budgetary</b> provision, diligent <b>implementation</b> and learning from experience. On other projects, building a fish barrier is done better than relocating displaced land dwellers, culvert design for a new road takes precedence over possible destroyed livelihoods that the road could cause, and a behind-schedule project does not have time to take flood protection precautions and so slips further when flood occurs.|$|R
40|$|Participatory budgeting, via {{which the}} common citizen {{is given the}} ability to {{interact}} with the elected politicians in the drafting of the local budget, became a popular political reform in Brazilian municipalities in the 1990 s and attracted widespread attention across the world. This paper investigates whether the use of participatory budgeting in Brazilian municipalities in the period 1991 - 2004 has a¤ected the pattern of municipal expenditures and had any measurable impact on living conditions. I show that the municipalities that made use of this participatory mechanism favoured an allocation of public expenditures that closely matched the “popular preferences ” and channeled a larger fraction of their total budget to key investments in sanitation and health services. I also …nd that this change in the composition of municipal expenditures is associated with a pronounced reduction in the infant mortality rates for municipalities which adopted participatory budgeting. This suggests that promoting a more direct interaction between service users and elected o ¢ cials in <b>budgetary</b> design and <b>implementation</b> can a¤ect both how local resources are spent and associated living standard outcomes...|$|R

Public discourse of budgeting process includes not only participants, who are legally empowered, but also other actors involved in the formation of the informational agenda regarding the budget. For example, the subjects of media discourse of the budget process are executive and legislative bodies, regulatory authorities, recipients of budgetary funds, political parties, professional and expert communities, civil society activists. Sociocommunicative description of the budgeting process and its subjects is presented based on analytical and inductive methods. At the same time political journalism is not only a space for the formation of media discourse and reflection of the budgetary process, but also one of the indicators of the state of the political system as a whole.

40|$|The {{budgeting}} {{process has}} been recently reformed in Italy (L. 196 / 2009) {{in order to improve}} control of budget and transparency in the provision of clear information on government fiscal policy. Indeed, the general government final expenditures often deviate significantly from the initial forecasted amounts. Therefore, although the initial budget is often formulated in contractionary stance compared with the previous year’s final account, the final outcome turns out to be expansionary. As a consequence, confidence in the reliability of expenditure estimates in the initial budget and {{in the value of the}} initial budget as an indicator of the stance of fiscal policy have been undermined. Using real-time data for Italy, reported in the Relazione Previsionale e Programmatica (RPP) and in the Relazione Unificata sull’Economia e la Finanza Pubblica (RUEF), we explore fiscal plans and their implementation for GDP and general government aggregated and disaggregated items of revenue, expenditure and budget balance over the period 1998 - 2009. Both reports are employed with the aim of measuring the <b>budgetary</b> policy <b>implementation</b> error, following the methodology of Beetsma et al. (2009). We focus on the first year of the fiscal plans because budgetary slippages mainly occur in this year (Balassone et al. 2010). The main findings suggest that implemented budgetary adjustment falls systematically short of planned adjustment for GDP, for primary balance and overall balance. Actually, the main determinants of the implementation error of both primary and overall balance are the expenditures, in particular, the capital expenditures. Moreover, it seems that errors in macroeconomic forecasts cannot be considered the driving force of the budgetary slippages. Our results are in line with the strand of literature (von Hagen 1992; von Hagen and Harden 1994; Alesina and Perotti 1999; Tanaka 2003) according to which credible plans are the conditio sine qua non for healthy budget outcomes and resorting fiscal transparency and accountability. To improve public budgeting in Italy, we deem necessary a renewed commitment by policy makers in term of planning and control of public expenditures. ...|$|R
30|$|In this study, an {{enhanced}} multi-objective maintenance workforce optimisation model for maintenance workforce planning problem is presented. The presented model {{made use of}} an FGP-cum-DE approach. The FGP-cum-DE approach addresses the problem of incorporating decision-makers’ opinions with respect to model objective function into an optimisation model. Based on a selected model from literature, the FGP-cum-DE approach generated satisfactory results for maintenance workforce reliability, efficiency, availability and quality of work done when tested with data from a brewery plant. This assertion {{was based on a}} comparative analysis of DE algorithm performance with those of GA and PSO algorithm. Furthermore, the FGP-cum-DE approach application can be easily be integrated into an existing optimisation model that is multi-objective. The method proposed in the current report probably will create an avenue for enhancing the decision-making capabilities of maintenance managers as information on the workforce planning is obtained in advance. So, the manager has a good control of <b>budgetary</b> plans and <b>implementation.</b> The built-up framework also provides a chance for maintenance managers to enhance their hiring and firing decision-making abilities, by hunting for candidates with the highest potentials of “return-on-investment”. Employment of such candidates potentially puts the organisation at a technological advantage and a good chance to survive in these turbulent business times.|$|R

Our analysis was restricted to two strategic business units, engineering projects and electricity distribution service, from a Brazilian electric power concessionaire. We postulate a mediated moderation association between uncertainty (treatment), bonus scheme (mediator), dispersion of payment scheme and the strength of causal relations proposed in the PMM (moderators) on budgetary slack (outcome). Additionally, we postulate that the use of accounting based measures also mediates the effect of uncertainty on budgetary slack. We gathered monthly observations from 102 indicators containing the target and achievement values throughout 2002 - 2006 periods. Managers were later asked to answer questionnaires about the possible cause-effect relations between these indicators, then 215 causal maps of the department and corporate indicators were drawn up. Econometric analysis find evidence that the budgetary slack observed is directly impacted by uncertainty, and this impact is moderated by the dispersion of payment scheme.

The features of control {{in the public sector}} performance are grounded as well as the relationship between verifiability and the controllability. It is proved that the achievement of public finance management needs its controllability. There is no alternative verifiability by ensuring controllability of budget resources. The classification criteria of budgetary control types according to the different classification criteria are developed. It has allowed to distinguish its following types: scheduled, unscheduled, previous, current, next, state, municipal, specialized, departmental, public, external, internal, solid, selective, comprehensive, effective, ineffective, centralized, decentralized, legislative, realizable, further, active, passive, available, projected, intermediate, final, mixed. The purpose of the article is to provide a classification criteria of budgetary control development, taking into account the role and functions of control in public finance management. The subject of the study is a set of financial relationships arising during the budgetary control due to appropriation of financial resources. Methodology. The following methods have been used in the process of writing: cognition, induction, deduction, analysis and synthesis. Results of the survey. Thus, the main directions of <b>budgetary</b> control <b>implementation</b> we can consider the following ones: monitoring compliance with procedures for preparation, review and approval of state and local budgets; the implementation of revenue and expenditure of the budget at the national and local levels control; detection of theft of public funds, as well as their misuse; accuracy of accounting control; increasing the revenue base of the state budget detection; preventive measures to combat corruption and bribery in the public sector.

40|$|Background People with Severe Mental Illness (SMI) {{frequently}} experience {{problems with}} regard to societal participation (i. e. work, education and daily activities outside the home), and require professional support in this area. The Boston University approach to Psychiatric Rehabilitation (BPR) is a comprehensive methodology that can offer this type of support. To date, several Randomised Controlled Trials (RCT’s) investigating the effectiveness of BPR have yielded positive outcomes {{with regard to}} societal participation. However, information about the cost-effectiveness and budgetary impact of the methodology, which may be important for broader dissemination of the approach, is lacking. BPR may be more cost effective than Care As Usual (CAU) because an increase in participation and independence may reduce the costs to society. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} study is to investigate, from a societal perspective, the cost-effectiveness of BPR for people with SMI who wish to increase their societal participation. In addition, the budget impact of implementing BPR in the Dutch healthcare setting will be assessed by means of a budget impact analysis (BIA) after completion of the trial. Methods In a multisite RCT, 225 adults (18 – 64 years of age) with SMI will be randomly allocated to the experimental (BPR) or the control condition (CAU). Additionally, a pilot study will be conducted with a group of 25 patients with severe and enduring eating disorders. All participants will be offered support aimed at personal rehabilitation goals, and will be monitored over a period of a year. Outcomes will be measured at baseline, and at 6 and 12 months after enrolment. Based on trial results, further analyses will be performed to assess cost-effectiveness and the <b>budgetary</b> impact of <b>implementation</b> scenarios. Discussion The trial results will provide insight into the cost-effectiveness of BPR in supporting people with SMI who would like to increase their level of societal participation. These results can be used to make decisions about further implementation of the method. Also, assessing budgetary impact will facilitate policymaking.
