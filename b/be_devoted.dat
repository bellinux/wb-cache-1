5|$|This {{concept of}} the double burden with married couples is a {{worldwide}} phenomenon. Throughout different cultures of the world, women spend more total hours in work than men do. In Japan, once married, they are still expected to <b>be</b> <b>devoted</b> wives and mothers who give all off their effort to the home, even after {{a full day of}} work. Latin American women, now entering the work force in large numbers, still face what they call doble jornada, or double day's journey. Although in the Latin American culture, men are starting to interact more with the children and helping around the house more, the main domestic responsibilities still fall upon the women of the house. Sometimes women who are primary wage earners are still relegated to most of the domestic work. European men are more likely to play and interact with their children but not likely to participate fully in their daily care. They are more likely to help their wives at home, yet rarely do they tackle all domestic task equally. Men commonly fail to live up to their belief of equal sharing of domestic labor: they may believe in an equal workload in the house, but the inconvenience of taking on work done by their wives stops many from following through.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{reconstruction}} of a building, starting from a point cloud. The shape of this building is a non-stellar concave and multi-connected structure, composed of sowns and chains. A sown is the representation of a horizontal plane formed by dense points. A chain is a planar loop modeled by rare points. CCTV structure is defined only by the three orthogonal Cartesian coordinates. The reconstruction uses a sequence of procedures and the desired output is a consistent 3 D model. The first procedure <b>is</b> <b>devoted</b> to attributing points to their voxel and to estimating the three values needed afterwards. The second procedure <b>is</b> <b>devoted</b> to analyzing clusters vertically and horizontally, to preliminarily distinguishing chains from sowns and to generating relational matching. The third procedure <b>is</b> <b>devoted</b> to building closed loops between all chains and all their projections on sowns.
