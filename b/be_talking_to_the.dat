6000|$|... "What can be {{the secret}} of this man's hold on me? How is it that he alters me so that I hardly know myself again? I was like myself in the railway {{carriage}} yesterday with Armadale. It was surely frightful to <b>be</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> living man, through the whole of that long journey, with the knowledge in me all the while that I meant to be his widow--and yet I was only excited and fevered. Hour after hour I never shrunk once from speaking to Armadale; but the first trumpery falsehood I told Midwinter turned me cold when I saw that he believed it! I felt a dreadful hysterical choking in the throat when he entreated me not to reveal my troubles. And once--I am horrified when I think of it--once, when he said, 'If I could love you more dearly, I should love you more dearly now,' I was within a hair-breadth of turning traitor to myself. I was on the very point of crying out to him, 'Lies! all lies! I'm a fiend in human shape! Marry the wretchedest creature that prowls the streets, and you will marry a better woman than me!' Yes! the seeing his eyes moisten, the hearing his voice tremble, while I was deceiving him, shook me in that way. I have seen handsomer men by hundreds, cleverer men by dozens. What can this man have roused in me? Is it Love? I thought I had loved, never to love again. Does a woman not love when the man's hardness to her drives her to drown herself? A man drove me to that last despair in days gone by. Did all my misery at that time come from something which was not Love? Have I lived to be five-and-thirty, and am I only feeling now what Love really is?--now, when it is too late? Ridiculous! Besides, what {{is the use of}} asking? What do I know about it? What does any woman ever know? The more we think of it, the more we deceive ourselves. I wish I had been born an animal. My beauty might have been of some use to me then--it might have got me a good master.|$|E

5000|$|Another {{criterion}} {{present in}} patients with paranoid schizophrenia is auditory hallucinations, in which the person hears voices or sounds that are not really present. The patient will sometimes hear multiple voices and the voices can either <b>be</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> patient or to one another. These voices that the patient hears can influence them to behave in a particular manner. Researchers at the Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research provide the following description: “They voices may make ongoing criticisms of what you’re thinking or doing, or make cruel comments about your real or imagined faults. Voices may also command you {{to do things that}} can be harmful to yourself or to others." [...] A patient exhibiting these auditory hallucinations may be observed talking to themself because the person believes that the voices are actually present.|$|E

50|$|Through research, {{the gang}} {{finds that the}} {{creature}} is a Queller demon, {{and that it is}} periodically summoned to rid the world of plagues of crazy people. At the Summers' home, Buffy and Dawn put their mother, whose mental clarity continues to deteriorate, to bed. Dawn listens from her bedroom as Joyce babbles loudly. At first, she appears to <b>be</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ceiling; however, it is soon revealed that she is talking to the Queller demon, which is watching her from the ceiling. Dawn tries to ignore the babble, and Buffy, who is downstairs washing dishes, turns on loud music and begins to sob. In Joyce's room, the demon falls from the ceiling and spits a thick layer of slime onto Joyce's face. Dawn hears the commotion and runs to check on her mother. When she sees the demon attacking her mother, she comes to the rescue, knocking it onto the floor with a coat rack. It flees from the room, and Dawn slams all the doors and screams for Buffy. Buffy runs upstairs to check on her mother and sister. They tell her about the demon, and she chases it downstairs where she finds Spike coming out of her basement. He asks her if she heard a noise, and she notices that he has been stealing pictures of her, but the demon attacks before she has a chance to berate him. Together, they fight off the demon, and Buffy ultimately kills it with a butcher knife while wrestling with it on the floor. Spike walks over and offers his hand to help her up. He pulls her to her feet, and their hands remain connected as Riley bursts through the door with the soldiers. Spike informed Riley that he had missed quite a show, making sure that Riley understood that Spike had been there to help.|$|E
5000|$|In May 2001, it was {{revealed}} that Coronation Street would feature a storyline in which the issue of paedophiles [...] "grooming" [...] kids over the internet will be played out by Sarah. In the storyline, Sarah turns to the internet in her bedroom as a way of meeting people. While visiting chatrooms, she is befriended by a 16-year-old boy who shares her interests and sends her a photo of himself. It turns out however that it is a man posing as a 16-year-old, and when he persuades Sarah to meet him face-to-face, she finds herself in a very dangerous situation. A spokeswoman for Granada confirmed the writers would <b>be</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Home Office regarding the story. [...] "We have been in touch with the Home Office," [...] But it is very difficult at the moment with the election on and the government in purdah. We hope to work with it afterwards though." [...] As for the reason behind the plot, the spokeswoman said they hoped to highlight the issue of internet crime, given recent publicity by the Tonight with Trevor MacDonald show and TV presenter Carol Vorderman. The show should also prove a far more effective measure in tackling concern over internet chatrooms than either the melodramatic outpourings of celebrities or the authoritarian and legislative approach of the government. [...] "Sarah is hugely popular and a great role model for teenagers," [...] the spokeswoman said. [...] "No matter how many politicians talk about the problem, they will never beat a peer in getting the message across. Plus, we know that many parents and kids watch the show side by side. Hopefully, we will spark some debate and then we would have done a good public service." [...] It's hard to argue with that logic. However, while the show should do more to make kids aware of the potential dangers of chatrooms, we remain concerned that it could also be used to kick up a storm that will see unnecessary and draconian legislation pushed through on a wave of public worry.|$|E
5000|$|The video {{involves}} the band performing {{the song in}} a warehouse with black walls. The shots of the band's performance are broken up by a story being told {{during the course of}} the song. The story begins with a class of military students watching as [...] "Sergeant Perry" [...] walks into the room, and appears to make clear his name but underlining it on a blackboard. As the sergeant begins talking to the class, a shot is shown of a young man listening. The sergeant appears to <b>be</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> class about being a patriot to the USA as he points to the USA flag and pats his chest, near his heart. The young man is then shown to be at home in the kitchen, cooking eggs in a frying pan while his younger brother sits at the kitchen table. The young man serves up the eggs to his younger brother. The story then continues with the young man on a building site, measuring up some wood. There then appears to be two men who seem to know the young man who see him, and start pointing at him, talking and laughing. The young man is next seen in the kitchen of a presumed fast food outlet, in the kitchen cleaning dishes. It appears the sergeant from earlier is in the fast food outlet. The young man sees him and they acknowledge each other. Later the sergeant is seen talking to another man with an army cap on, pointing at a location on a map, and writing names up on a white board. The story then cuts back to the classroom scene, with the sergeant talking to the class. He appears to focus on the young man from earlier, and indicates something by sticking up four fingers. The young man nods. The class is then dismissed and various students shake the sergeant's hand as they leave. The sergeant is then seen wiping names off of the blackboard from under his name. The young man from earlier then comes up and shakes the sergeant's hand.|$|E

5000|$|Back at Wolfram & Hart, Nina is {{preparing}} for her second werewolf night when Puppet Angel pays her a visit to apologize {{for the way he}} treated her earlier. Shes shocked to see that hes a puppet and he notes, [...] "Im made of felt. And my nose comes off." [...] She tells him that he shouldnt care what people think of him, since hes a hero. Puppet Angel turns away starting to say how hard its been to be a hero— when Nina suddenly wolfs out and attacks him from her cage. Upstairs, Lorne comes across a tattered Puppet Angel and yells, [...] "Is there a Geppetto in the house?" [...] Gunn heads to the medical wing to see Dr. Sparrow, explaining that hes losing his law knowledge. Sparrow examines him and tells him that the implant is failing in an [...] "Acute Flowers For Algernon Syndrome"; the Senior Partners gave it to {{him in the first place}} because they wanted him to have it, and if its fading, they must have wanted that as well. Gunn says that he doesnt want to go back to the person he was, so Sparrow makes a deal with him - hell give him a “permanent upgrade” if Gunn signs something out of customs for him. In the science lab, Fred and Wesley agree theyre starting to really like Smile Time, though that may be from sleep deprivation. Knox brings Fred coffee, but she orders him to go home. After he leaves, Fred confesses that she decided Knox wasnt right for her, and tries to tell Wesley that she has developed feelings for him; however, he doesnt get the message. Suddenly, while the sound of the show is muted, Wesley notices Polo seems to <b>be</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> audience.Puppet Angel is trying to sew himself up in his office when Wesley and Fred arrive to tell him the puppets singing acts as a cloaking device, allowing Polo to address the children directly. Wesley says the “nest egg” holds the life forces of the kids, so if they can break the magic on it, theyll save the kids and turn Angel human again. Gunn, whos regained his law knowledge, announces the puppets are actually running the show - Framkin made a deal with some devils to improve his ratings. Elsewhere in L.A., a little girl watches Smile Time and gets the message from Polo that all of the kids in the audience should put their hands on the TV.|$|E
5000|$|Frelimo’s {{immediate}} {{warning was}} that {{there was no such thing}} as democratic colonialism, and that nobody should imagine that Mozambicans would tolerate Portuguese rule just because there had been a change of government in Lisbon.Frelimo’s fears were well-founded. The MFA allowed General António de Spínola to become the first post-coup President. He had been commander of the Portuguese forces in Guinea-Bissau, then Portuguese Guinea, and was believed to be deeply implicated in the assassination of the Guinean nationalist leader, Amílcar Cabral. Spinola had no intention of letting Mozambique and Angola go. He dreamed of a Lusophone commonwealth run from Lisbon, and wanted a referendum on independence. Machel rejected such plans with the pithy remark “You don’t ask a slave if he wants to be free, particularly when he is already in revolt, and much less if you happen to be a slave-owner”. Initial discussions between Frelimo and the new Portuguese government, held in Lusaka in June 1974, proved fruitless. It was clear to Machel that the Portuguese foreign minister, Socialist Party leader Mário Soares, had no power to negotiate independence. So Machel sent one of his top advisers, Aquino de Bragança, to Lisbon to find out who really held power in Portugal. His answer was that Frelimo should really <b>be</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> MFA, particular to military intellectuals such as Col. Ernesto Melo Antunes, whose power was on the rise, as that of Spinola waned. Machel refused to give the Portuguese the ceasefire they wanted. For as long as there was no commitment to Mozambican independence, the war would continue. Frelimo re-opened its front in Zambezia province, and stepped up operations throughout the war zone.There was little resistance. Following the collapse of the Caetano government, rank and file Portuguese soldiers saw little point in continuing to fight, preferring to stay in their barracks. More serious talks between the Lisbon government and Frelimo ensued, and this time the MFA played a dominant role. The result was an agreement, signed in Lusaka on September 7, 1974, which agreed to transfer full power to Frelimo with the date for independence set for June 25, 1975. That day there was a short lived settler revolt against the agreement, put down within a day by Portuguese and Frelimo troops acting jointly. A transitional government was set up, containing ministers appointed by both Frelimo and Portugal, but headed by Frelimo’s Joaquim Chissano as Prime Minister. Machel continued to run Frelimo from Tanzania. He returned home triumphantly, in a journey [...] "from the Rovuma to the Maputo" [...] (the rivers marking the northern and southern boundaries of the country), in which he addressed rallies in every major population centre in the country. The journey was interrupted at the beach resort of Tofo, in Inhambane Province, for a meeting of the Frelimo Central Committee, which drew up Mozambique’s first Constitution. This gave the outline of the one-party, socialist state which Frelimo intended to establish. Frelimo was constitutionally the leading force in Mozambican society, and the President of Frelimo would automatically be President of Mozambique.On June 25, 1975, Machel proclaimed [...] "the total and complete independence of Mozambique and its constitution into the People’s Republic of Mozambique". This, he said, would be [...] "a state of People's Democracy, in which, under the leadership of the worker-peasant alliance, all patriotic strata commit themselves to the destruction of the sequels of colonialism, and to annihilate the system of exploitation of man by man". Machel’s government moved quickly to bring key areas under state control. All land was nationalized - individuals and institutions could not hold land, but leased it from the state. On July 24, 1975, just a month after independence, all health and education institutions were nationalized. National health and education services were set up, and all private schools and clinics were abolished. The Catholic Church immediately lost the privileged position it had held in these areas. On February 3, 1976, the government nationalized all rented housing. “Landlords? What do we want landlords for in our country for?”, asked Machel at the rally announcing the measure. Private ownership of houses was not banned. Anyone, Mozambican or foreign, could own a house for their own use - but building private property for rent was forbidden. This changed the face of Mozambican cities - black Mozambicans moved from the suburbs into blocks in the centre of the cities, occupying houses and flats, once owned by Portuguese landlords, and many of which had now been abandoned. In February 1977, at its 3rd Congress, Frelimo declared that it was now a Marxist-Leninist party, dedicated to the building of socialism, based on the “worker-peasant alliance”. The Congress re-elected Machel as President of Frelimo, and thus automatically as President of the Republic. Frelimo was reorganized into celulas (“branches”) throughout the county. The party was to be a Leninist vanguard, and state institutions, at whatever level, were to be subordinate to the party. In 1978 elections were held. Since this was a one-party state, there was no organized opposition. Instead candidates were presented by Frelimo at meetings - and were sometimes rejected when people complained of offences ranging from wife-beating and drunkenness to acting as an informer for the PIDE during the colonial government. Frelimo faced a hostile environment, with the white minority governments of Ian Smith’s Rhodesia and apartheid South Africa on Mozambique’s borders. In March 1976, Machel’s government implemented United Nations sanctions against the Smith government, and closed the borders with Rhodesia. In retaliation, Smith’s Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO) recruited dissatisfied Mozambicans and former Portuguese settlers and helped set up an anti-Frelimo movement. Initially this “Mozambique National Resistance” operated as an auxiliary branch of the Rhodesian armed forces. Frelimo dismissed them as “armed bandits”.|$|E
40|$|This is {{the first}} in a series of podcasts that New Books in History is {{offering}} in conjunction with the National History Center. The NHC and Oxford University Press have initiated a book series called 2 ̆ 2 Reinterpreting History. 2 ̆ 2 The volumes in the series aim to convey to readers how and why historians revise and reinterpret their understanding of the past, and they do so by focusing on a particular historical topic, event, or idea that has long gained the attention of historians. The first contribution to the 2 ̆ 2 Reinterpreting History 2 ̆ 2 series is Atlantic History: A Critical Appraisal (Oxford University Press, 2008). Today we 2 ̆ 7 ll <b>be</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> editors of the volume, Jack P. Greene and Philip D. Morgan. You may think that historians normally study states or nations, like France and China. But they also study areas of international or imperial interaction. The most famous example of this sort of 2 ̆ 2 international 2 ̆ 2 history is Fernand Braudel 2 ̆ 7 s The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean World in the Age of Philip II (1949), but there are many others. Among them one finds contributions to 2 ̆ 2 Atlantic History, 2 ̆ 2 itself a relatively new field. Its object is the 2 ̆ 2 Atlantic World, 2 ̆ 2 roughly, the history of the interaction of four continents (Africa, Europe, North America and South America) from the fifteenth to the eighteenth century. In this podcast, Greene and Morgan talk about the origin of the field, its work to date, and its prospects. For an introduction to Atlantic history, see Bernard Bailyn, Atlantic History. Concepts and Contours (Harvard University Press, 2005) and J. H. Elliot, Empires of the Atlantic World. Britain and Spain in America, 1492 - 1830 (Yale University Press, 2006).
