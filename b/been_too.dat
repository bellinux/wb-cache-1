Instead, Adkison asked Garfield if he could invent a game that was both portable and quick-playing, to which Garfield agreed.|$|E

5|$|Kinne's appeal, {{rather than}} {{overturning}} her sentence, lengthened it. The three-man superior court which heard her case overturned {{one aspect of}} her conviction—charges of attempted robbery—but upheld her murder conviction and increased her sentence from ten to thirteen years, saying that her original sentence had <b>been</b> <b>too</b> lenient.|$|E
5|$|The crests and frills of some dinosaurs, {{like the}} marginocephalians, theropods and lambeosaurines, may have <b>been</b> <b>too</b> fragile {{to be used}} for active defense, and so they were likely used for sexual or {{aggressive}} displays, though little is known about dinosaur mating and territorialism. Head wounds from bites suggest that theropods, at least, engaged in active aggressive confrontations.|$|E
5|$|Legler {{held the}} record {{for well over a}} year. As 2000 ended and 2001 began, the {{producers}} of Millionaire decided that it had <b>been</b> <b>too</b> long (71 games over a five-month period) since their top prize had been won, and instituted an accumulating jackpot which added $10,000 to the grand prize amount for each game it was not won. Kevin Olmstead claimed the top prize on April 10, 2001, winning a jackpot of $2,180,000. Olmstead became the first contestant to top $2,000,000 in total winnings on a game show and supplanted Legler as the all-time leader.|$|E

5|$|Stunned, the {{remaining}} Chili Peppers, {{who had no}} suitable replacement for Frusciante, hired Arik Marshall to play {{the remaining}} dates after being forced to reschedule. Upon returning to Hollywood, the band placed {{an ad in the}} L.A. Weekly for open guitar auditions, which Kiedis considered to be a waste of time. After several months of unsuccessfully looking for a suitable guitarist, drummer Chad Smith suggested Dave Navarro. He had always been the band's first choice, but had <b>been</b> <b>too</b> busy following the 1991 breakup of Jane's Addiction. Navarro eventually accepted the position after productive jam sessions.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{plan had}} been to take the songs out on the road, but no new tour transpired. Thus, Bush {{deliberately}} aimed for a live-band feel, with less of the studio trickery that had typified her last three albums and which would have <b>been</b> <b>too</b> difficult to re-create on stage. The result alienated some of her fan base, who had enjoyed the intricacy of her earlier compositions, but others found a new complexity in the lyrics and the emotions they expressed.|$|E
5|$|The {{selection}} of Leech and Morgan for the 6 December final generated controversy, {{as they were}} the two youngest swimmers in the squad and lacked experience at open level competition. Both had competed only once at senior Australian level; Morgan had twice false started at the 1956 Australian Championships, while Leech had <b>been</b> <b>too</b> ill to compete. Australia was the favourite for the relay, having swept the medals in the individual 100-metre event; Fraser, Crapp and Leech finished first, second and third. The favouritism was even more marked because Fraser and Crapp were three seconds faster than {{everyone else in the}} world.|$|E

5|$|There have <b>been</b> <b>too</b> few {{published}} {{studies on the}} etymology of the figure of Wade's Bel (whether that refers to his milkmaid wife or to the cow) to provide a firm etymological or mythological basis. Wade is firmly rooted in Norse mythology and there are parallels between Wade's cow/milkmaid wife Bel and the milkmaid figure of Beyla in Norse mythology, who some authorities have suggested derives etymologically from baula, meaning cow. There is no published work suggesting such a link, so {{the origin of the}} figure remains unproven.|$|E
5|$|With the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War, almost all design work was halted, although work on turrets and gunnery arrangements by Germaniawerft's designers continued until the German invasion of the Netherlands in May. The first 1047-class ship was scheduled to be completed in 1944, so would in any case have <b>been</b> <b>too</b> late to stop the Japanese advance into the Dutch East Indies. Due to the war, final plans for the ships were never completed, and the ships were never constructed.|$|E
5|$|After the drawn Second Test, Simpson {{contracted}} chickenpox, so Booth {{was again}} captain for the Third Test {{in front of}} his home crowd at the SCG. It was an extra burden, as Booth had made only 49 runs in the first two Tests; his teammates felt that their captain had <b>been</b> <b>too</b> anxious following his struggles against Griffith in the Caribbean. However, there was to be no fairytale for Booth, who later admitted to being in psychological disarray; he was unaware if the rolling done on the pitch after the toss was legal, and Philpott arrived late and ran onto the field just as play was starting.|$|E

5|$|After the election, Reid orchestrated a quick {{transfer}} of power. The Social Credit victory had provoked a bank run, {{and he wanted}} to re-establish stability as quickly as possible. Moreover, the province needed to borrow a large sum of money to meet even its short-term obligations, and the UFA, as a lame duck government, was unable to make promises to would-be creditors. Once in office, confronted with a dire financial situation, Aberhart accused the UFA government of mismanagement. Reid responded in January 1936 that there had been no such mismanagement, that the province's financial problems were due to Social Credit's policies, both real and promised, and that had the UFA won re-election in 1935 it could have continued governing without serious difficulty. He also resisted insinuations that it had <b>been</b> <b>too</b> restrained in helping impoverished farmers: as late as 1969 he was offering the view that shrinking sources of provincial revenue made further assistance impossible.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with most}} of the Pleistocene megafauna, Smilodon became extinct 10,000 years ago in the Quaternary {{extinction}} event. Its extinction has been linked to the decline and extinction of large herbivores, which were replaced by smaller and more agile ones like deer. Hence, Smilodon could have <b>been</b> <b>too</b> specialized at hunting large prey and may have been unable to adapt. A 2012 study of Smilodon tooth wear found no evidence that they were limited by food resources. Other explanations include climate change and competition with humans (who entered the Americas around the time Smilodon disappeared), or a combination of several factors, all of which apply to the general Pleistocene extinction event, rather than specifically to the extinction of the saber-toothed cats.|$|E
5|$|Also {{during the}} 1970s, Bill Morris was {{studying}} giant lambeosaurine remains from Baja California. He named them ?L. laticaudus in 1981 (type specimen LACM 17715). Morris used {{a question mark}} in his work because no complete crest had been found for his species, and without it a definitive assignment could not be made. From what was known of the skull, he considered it to be most like Lambeosaurus. He interpreted this species as water-bound, due to features like its size, its tall and narrow tail (interpreted as a swimming adaptation), and weak hip articulations, {{as well as a}} healed broken thigh bone that he thought would have <b>been</b> <b>too</b> much of a handicap for a terrestrial animal to have survived long enough to heal. This species was later (2012) assigned to the new genus Magnapaulia.|$|E

So a proper step size is important to maintain the search as efficient as possible.|$|R
5|$|Another {{argument}} for sociality {{is based on}} the healed injuries in several Smilodon fossils, which would suggest that the animals needed others to provide it food. This argument has been questioned, as cats can recover quickly from even severe bone damage and an injured Smilodon could survive if it had access to water. The brain of Smilodon was relatively small compared to other cat species. Some researchers have argued that Smilodons brain would have <b>been</b> <b>too</b> small for it to have been a social animal. An analysis of brain size in living big cats found no correlation between brain size and sociality. Another argument against Smilodon being social is that being an ambush hunter in closed habitat would likely have made group-living unnecessary, as in most modern cats. Yet it has also been proposed that being the largest predator in an environment comparable to the savanna of Africa, Smilodon may have had a social structure similar to modern lions, which possibly live in groups primarily to defend optimal territory from other lions (lions are the only social big cats today).|$|E
5|$|Bamber first sought {{leave to}} appeal in November 1986, arguing that the judge had {{misdirected}} the jury. The application was heard and refused by a single judge in April 1988. Bamber's lawyer requested a full hearing before three judges, arguing that the trial judge's summing up had been biased against Bamber, that his language had <b>been</b> <b>too</b> forceful, {{and that he had}} undermined the defence by advancing his own theory. The lawyer also argued that the defence had not pressed Julie Mugford about her dealings with the media, but should have, because as soon as the trial was over her story began to appear in newspapers. The judges rejected the application in March 1989.|$|E

The main armor belt was retained, but was reduced in height to save weight.
