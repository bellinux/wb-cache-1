5|$|A {{number of}} risk scores exist to predict <b>bleeding</b> in people using {{warfarin}} and similar anticoagulants. A commonly used score (HAS-BLED) includes known predictors of warfarin-related bleeding: uncontrolled {{high blood pressure}} (H), abnormal kidney function (A), previous stroke (S), known previous <b>bleeding</b> condition (B), previous labile INR when on anticoagulation (L), elderly as defined by age over 65 (E), and drugs associated with <b>bleeding</b> (e.g. aspirin) or alcohol misuse (D). While their use is recommended in clinical practice guidelines, they are only moderately effective in predicting <b>bleeding</b> risk and do not perform well in predicting hemorrhagic stroke. <b>Bleeding</b> risk may be increased in people on hemodialysis. Another score used to assess <b>bleeding</b> risk on anticoagulation, specifically Warfarin or Coumadin, is the ATRIA score, which uses a weighted additive scale of clinical findings to determine <b>bleeding</b> risk stratification. The risks of <b>bleeding</b> are increased further when warfarin is combined with antiplatelet drugs such as clopidogrel, aspirin, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin {{can cause}} {{prolonged}} <b>bleeding</b> after operations {{for up to}} 10 days. In one study, 30 of 6499 people having elective surgery required reoperations to control <b>bleeding.</b> Twenty had diffuse <b>bleeding</b> and 10 had <b>bleeding</b> from a site.

5|$|Hematomas, also focal lesions, are {{collections}} {{of blood in}} or around the brain that can result from hemorrhage. Intracerebral hemorrhage, with <b>bleeding</b> in the brain tissue itself, is an intra-axial lesion. Extra-axial lesions include epidural hematoma, subdural hematoma, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and intraventricular hemorrhage. Epidural hematoma involves <b>bleeding</b> into the area between the skull and the dura mater, the outermost of the three membranes surrounding the brain. In subdural hematoma, <b>bleeding</b> occurs between the dura and the arachnoid mater. Subarachnoid hemorrhage involves <b>bleeding</b> into {{the space between the}} arachnoid membrane and the pia mater. Intraventricular hemorrhage occurs when there is <b>bleeding</b> in the ventricles.|$|E
40|$|An {{analytical}} <b>bleed</b> {{system design}} procedure {{is applied to}} a Mach 3. 5, axisymmetric, translating centerbody inlet. The design features a traveling centerbody <b>bleed</b> system with a ducting arrangement separating low-, medium-, and high-pressure <b>bleed.</b> Three forward plenums and nine throat plenums are installed on the centerbody to meet the <b>bleed</b> requirements in the started Mach range between 1. 6 and 3. 5. The cowl contains four stationary plenums, three for forward and one for throat <b>bleed.</b> To achieve maximum <b>bleed</b> plenum pressure and thereby minimize <b>bleed</b> drag all <b>bleed</b> holes are inclined 20 deg to the surface except in the cowl throat region. Here the requirement of high stability margin with minimum total pressure recovery penalty resulted in 90 deg <b>bleed</b> holes. The <b>bleed</b> hole diameter varies from <b>bleed</b> plenum to <b>bleed</b> plenum to achieve the most efficient boundary layer control, while the <b>bleed</b> exits are sized to operate at the highest possible plenum pressure without unchoking the <b>bleed</b> holes. <b>Bleed</b> flow rates, <b>bleed</b> plenum pressures, and boundary layer development along the cowl and centerbody are predicted over the entire started Mach range...|$|R

The <b>bleed</b> manifold system was operated over a range of <b>bleed</b> rates corresponding {{to as much as}} 6 % of the fan flow at approach thrust and 4. 25 % of the fan flow at takeoff thrust. Acoustic results indicate that a <b>bleed</b> rate of 4 % of the fan flow reduces the fan maximum approach 200 foot (61. 0 m) sideline PNL 0. 5 PNdB and the corresponding takeoff thrust noise 1. 1 PNdB below the level with zero <b>bleed.</b> However, comparison of the standard casing (no <b>bleed</b> slot) and the slotted <b>bleed</b> casing with zero <b>bleed</b> shows that the <b>bleed</b> slot itself caused a noise increase...|$|R

5|$|Combined {{hormonal}} contraceptives {{include both}} an estrogen and a progestogen. Estrogen negative {{feedback on the}} anterior pituitary greatly decreases the release of FSH, which makes combined hormonal contraceptives more effective at inhibiting follicular development and preventing ovulation. Estrogen also reduces the incidence of irregular breakthrough <b>bleeding.</b> Several combined hormonal contraceptives—the pill, NuvaRing, and the contraceptive patch—are usually used {{in a way that}} causes regular withdrawal <b>bleeding.</b> In a normal cycle, menstruation occurs when estrogen and progesterone levels drop rapidly. Temporarily discontinuing use of combined hormonal contraceptives (a placebo week, not using patch or ring for a week) has a similar effect of causing the uterine lining to shed. If withdrawal <b>bleeding</b> is not desired, combined hormonal contraceptives may be taken continuously, although this increases the risk of breakthrough <b>bleeding.</b>|$|E

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{study was}} performed to investigate the shock-wave/boundary-layer interactions on a flat plate with <b>bleed</b> through one or more circular holes that vent into a plenum. The bleed-hole patterns considered for the study include in-line multiple holes and staggered multiple-row holes that are configured to simulate the patterns used in inlet <b>bleed</b> systems of high performance aircraft. The focus {{of the study was}} to examine how the <b>bleed</b> through multiple holes affect <b>bleed</b> rate and the pressure and Mach number distributions. Since the <b>bleed</b> performance was found sensitive to the change in <b>bleed</b> conditions, a computational procedure was developed to give a good turnaround computational time for parametric studies involving changes in <b>bleed</b> hole geometry and the structure of shock-wave/boundary-layer flowfield. The procedure includes the grid-generation methodology and the flow simulation with solutions from the Navier-Stokes equations.

A three-month course is also recommended for those with proximal DVT provoked by a transient risk factor, and three months is suggested over lengthened treatment when <b>bleeding</b> risk is low to moderate. Unprovoked DVT patients {{should have at least}} three months of anticoagulation and be considered for extended treatment. Those whose first VTE is an unprovoked proximal DVT are suggested for anticoagulation longer than three months unless there is a high risk of <b>bleeding.</b> In that case, three months is sufficient.

40|$|A {{model has}} been {{developed}} to simulate a fixed-exit porous <b>bleed</b> system for supersonic inlets. The fixed-exit model allows the amount of <b>bleed</b> flow to vary according to local flow conditions and fixed-exit characteristics of the <b>bleed</b> system. This variation {{is important for the}} control of shock-wave/boundary-layer interactions within the inlet. The model computes the <b>bleed</b> plenum static pressure rather than requiring its specification. The model was implemented in the Wind-US computational fluid dynamics code. The model was then verified and validated against experimental data for <b>bleed</b> on a flat plate with and without an impinging oblique shock and for <b>bleed</b> in a Mach 3. 0 axisymmetric, mixed-compression inlet. The model was able to accurately correlate the plenum pressures with <b>bleed</b> rates and simulate the effect of the <b>bleed</b> on the downstream boundary layer.

5|$|The major {{side effect}} of {{warfarin}} use is <b>bleeding.</b> Risk of <b>bleeding</b> is increased if the INR is out of range (due to accidental or deliberate overdose or due to interactions). Many drug interactions can increase the effect of warfarin, also causing an overdose.|$|E

40|$|The {{modeling}} of porous <b>bleed</b> regions as boundary conditions in {{computational fluid dynamics}} (CFD) simulations of supersonic inlet flows has been improved through a scaling of sonic flow coefficient data for 90 deg <b>bleed</b> holes.
