40|$|ABSTRACT This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} sugarcane growth and its agricultural and industrial yield influenced by phosphorus (P) sources {{and forms of}} application. The experiment was carried out at the Paisa Sugar Mill, in Penedo-AL, Brazil, from February 2012 to February 2013. The adopted experimental design was a randomized block in a factorial arrangement, with four replicates. The treatments consisted of five doses of triple superphosphate applied in the planting furrow (0, 50, 100, 150 and 200 kg ha- 1 of P 2 O 5), and three doses of <b>Bayóvar</b> reactive phosphate rock (0, 100 and 200 kg ha- 1 of P 2 O 5) applied in the total area. Phosphorus applied in the planting furrow improved sugarcane quality through the reduction of fiber and increases in purity, corrected pol, total recoverable sugar, ton of pol per hectare (TPH) and ton of sugarcane per hectare (TSH). The <b>Bayóvar</b> reactive phosphate rock promoted increases in stem diameter at 120 days after planting (DAP), TPH and TSH.

40|$|The {{eucalyptus}} has {{a pronounced}} demand for phosphorus (P) {{in the initial}} growth. Therefore, its P critical level is higher {{in the early stages}} of development, decreasing with plant age. The study was carried out to evaluate the response to fertilization and relative efficiency (RE) of phosphates (RPs) in the initial growth of eucalyptus. For this, two experiments were conducted in a greenhouse, from October 2010 to February 2011, at the University of Santa Catarina (UDESC), in Lages, Santa Catarina state, one with Eucalyptus dunnii and another with Eucalyptus benthamii using the following phosphorus sources: <b>Bayovar,</b> Gafsa, Djebel and triple superphosphate, plus a control without P. These P treatments were applied in soils with and without liming. The experimental design was completely randomized in a 5 x 2 factorial arrangement and with four replications. Plants were grown for 110 days and after harvest, were determined dry matter (by difference of wet weight and dry weight) and P accumulation in plant tissue from different parts of the plant (determined by spectrophotometry at a wavelength of 882 nm after reduction of phospho-molibidate complex with ascorbic acid). The relative efficiency of RPs (%) was calculated from data obtained from dry matter of shoots and total dry matter. For the correlation between the parameters of P content in the plants and soil available P it was applied Pearson’s correlation (P < 0. 05). All sources of P were similar to each other, but were higher than the control one, however, the use of these sources resulted in an increase in dry matter production and P content accumulated in the shoots of Eucalyptus benthamii and Eucalyptus dunnii compared to the control treatment regardless the soil amendment. In soil without lime, the RE averages were 75, 91 and 94 %, respectively for RPs <b>Bayovar,</b> Gafsa and Djebel. For soils with lime, the RE averages were 65, 24 and 25 % for the same phosphate sources. In treatments without liming the relative efficiency of RPs was higher compared to soils with lime...|$|E

40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} phosphorus application rates from various sources and in {{the presence or absence}} of filter cake on soil phosphorus, plant phosphorus, changes in acid phosphatase activity, and sugarcane productivity grown in Eutrophic Red Ultisol. Three P sources were used (triple superphosphate, Araxa rock phosphate, and <b>Bayovar</b> rock phosphate) and four application rates (0, 90, 180, and 360 [*]kg[*]ha− 1 of P 2 O 5) in {{the presence or absence of}} filter cake (7. 5 [*]t[*]ha− 1, dry basis). The soil P, the accumulated plant P, the leaf acid phosphatase activity and straw, the stalk productivity, the concentration of soluble solids in the juice (Brix), the juice sucrose content (Pol), and the purity were the parameters evaluated. We found that P applications increased levels of soil, leaf, and juice phosphorus and led to higher phosphorus accumulation and greater stalk and straw productivity. These levels were highest in the presence of filter cake. Acid phosphatase activity decreased with increasing plant phosphorus concentration. Phosphate fertilization did not show effect on sugarcane technological quality. We concluded that P application, regardless of source, improved phosphorus nutrition and increased productivity in sugarcane and, when associated with filter cake, reduced the need for mineral fertilizer...|$|E
40|$|Current {{knowledge}} and theories of large scale Andean tectonics {{as they relate}} to site planning for the NASA Crustal Dynamics Program's proposed high precision geodetic measurements of relative motions between the Nazca and South American plates are summarized. The Nazca Plate and its eastern margin, the Peru-Chile Trench, is considered a prototype plate marked by rapid motion, strong seismicity and well defined boundaries. Tectonic activity across the Andes results from the Nazca Plate subducting under the South American plate in a series of discrete platelets with different widths and dip angles. This in turn, is reflected in the tectonic complexity of the Andes which are a multitutde of orogenic belts superimposed on each other since the Precambrian. Sites for Crustal Dynamics Program measurements are being located to investigate both interplate and extraplate motions. Observing operations have already been initiated at Arequipa, Peru and Easter Island, Santiago and Cerro Tololo, Chile. Sites under consideration include Iquique, Chile; Oruro and Santa Cruz, Bolivia; Cuzco, Lima, Huancayo and <b>Bayovar,</b> Peru; and Quito and the Galapagos Islands, Ecuador. Based on scientific considerations, Santa Cruz, Huancayo (or Lima), Quito and the Galapagos Islands should be replaced by Isla San Felix, Chile; Brazilia or Petrolina, Brazil; and Guayaquil, Ecuador.

40|$|The Tertiary diatomaceous sediments in the {{sequences}} {{along the}} continental margin from Ecuador to Chile are recognized in 4 horizons {{at the last}} stage of transgression-regression cycle. (1) The uppermost Eocene Chira Formation in <b>Bayovar</b> of northern Peru was resulted from high-latitude cooling and consequently strengthened oceanic circulation, the Terminal Eocene Event. (2) The Caballas Formation in Cerro Las Salinas of Pisco consists of calcareous siltstone and sandstone with interbedded diatomaceous intervals. It is assigned to the late Oligocene to early Miocene based on diatom biostratigraphy. The diatom assemblages contain many tropic to equatorial species. (3) The significant diatomaceous sediments in Ecuador, Peru, and Chile occur in early middle Miocene at 14 to 12 Ma. They were triggered by intensified coastal upwelling and oceanic circulation from pole to equatorial zone caused by the increased thermal gradients resulted from the permanent establishment of the major East Antarctic ice sheet. Sedimentary facies changes simultaneously both in the Pacific coastal area of South America and in the North Pacific region. (4) The upper Miocene to Pliocene diatomaceous sediments such as Pisco Formation in Pisco-Ice of Peru contain abundantly coastal upwelling-related genus Thalassionema and Chaetoceros, and suggest high productivity conditions linked to coastal upwelling.

40|$|Actiniid sea anemones possess few {{characteristics}} of taxonomic value, which makes columnar outgrowths {{one of the}} most important features for systematic work. There are two species of actiniid sea anemones known from Chile and southern Peru that exhibit a column densely covered with non-adhesive vesicles: Phymactis papillosa (Lesson, 1830) (= Phymactis clematis) and Phymanthea pluvia (Drayton in Dana, 1846). Hereby both are re-described in detail. The re-descriptions are based on observations of about 100 living animals in their habitat and in aquaria and on the examination of 21 specimens of P. papillosa and seven specimens of P. pluvia collected in Chile between 1995 and 2003. In Chile, specimens of both species occur in tide-pools, on vertical and overhanging rock-walls in the intertidal zone and in shallow water down to depths of 16 m. Large size, numerous short tentacles, and acrorhagi characterize both species. Phymactis papillosa is a widely distributed species: its occurrence is confirmed from Playa Tantalean, Peninsula <b>Bayovar,</b> Peru (05 ° 48 ’ 15 ’’S, 81 ° 04 ’ 99 ’’W), to the Archipelago de los Chonos (44 ° 24 ’S; 73 ° 34 ’W), south Chile, for the Gulf of California (24 ° 08 ’N; 110 ° 15 ’W) and for the Pacific coast of Mexico (23 ° 26 ’N; 110 ° 15 ’W) as well as for some Pacific Islands. Phymactis papillosa occurs solitarily and in clonal aggregations and exhibits four distinct colour varieties: var. rubra, var. viridis, var. cyanea and var. fusca as well as some mixed morphs. Phymanthea pluvia can be found between Caleta Yasila, Paita, Peru (05 ° 07 ’ 38 ’’S, 81 ° 10 ’ 07 ’’W), and the region of Valparaíso, central Chile (33 ° 02 ’S, 71 ° 38 ’W). Specimens of P. pluvia always have a hardly varying orange colour; the apexes of its vesicles are whitish. Morphologically both species are quite similar; besides the colour they can be distinguished by the histological structure of the vesicles and by the numerous rod-like basitrichs in the acrorhagi of P. papillosa. Structure and histology of the vesicles of both species are described in detail and possible functions and the taxonomic value of vesicles are discussed.
