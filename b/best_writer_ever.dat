He later worked for the Portage la Prairie Press, the Calgary Herald, Canadian Press and Southam News. He won the Bowater Award for Business Journalism in 1960, and a National Newspaper Award in 1961. Colleague Charles Lynch described Phillips as the <b>best</b> <b>writer</b> <b>ever</b> to grace the Parliamentary Press Gallery, stating that he was [...] "capable of prose that came close to poetry". He was Southam News' Washington, DC correspondent in the 1960s before joining CTV in 1968.|$|E

Ultimately, with [...] "half a minute"'s thought, they [...] "amazingly... all agreed, pound for pound, page for page" [...] that the unequivocal choice was Warren Publishing's Creepy, a high point unmatched since [...] "there has never been such a collection of stellar artists assembled under one banner publication" [...] as in Creepy, whose pages were host to (among others) [...] "Toth, Frazetta, Williamson, Torres, Colan, Ditko, Wrightson, Corbenetc.."Chiarello notes that [...] "most of those stories" [...] were written by one man: Archie Goodwin [...] "probably the very best editor ever to work in comics, probably the very <b>best</b> <b>writer</b> <b>ever</b> to work in comics," [...] (and early mentor to Chiarello when the two worked at Marvel) whose Warren work was itself an [...] "homage to the favorite comics of his youth, the E.C. line." ...|$|E

50|$|Albert Camus, a French-Algerian (or pied noir), is {{undoubtedly}} the <b>best</b> known <b>writer</b> <b>ever</b> {{to come from}} Algeria. A philosopher, novelist and playwright, Camus won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1957. While most of his stories are set in Algeria and he supported civil rights for the indigenous Algerians, he opposed Algerian independence, which has hurt his reputation in his homeland.|$|R
5000|$|We {{figured out}} that we shared {{pretty much the same}} experiences; we’d been doing similar things on {{opposite}} sides of the Atlantic. Then I got invited to the studio to write some songs with Lady Gaga; we did “Starstruck”, we did a song called “Christmas Tree” She’s super-creative, she’s amazing — the <b>best</b> <b>writer</b> I’d <b>ever</b> seen, and best performer.

50|$|Raymond Chandler, often {{considered}} Hammett's successor, summarized his accomplishments in The Simple Art of Murder:Hammett was the ace performer... He {{is said to}} have lacked heart; yet the story he himself thought the most of, The Glass Key, is the record of a man's devotion to a friend. He was spare, frugal, hard-boiled, but he did over and over again what only the <b>best</b> <b>writers</b> can <b>ever</b> do at all. He wrote scenes that seemed never to have been written before.|$|R
5000|$|William Forrest [...] "Blackie" [...] Sherrod ( [...] November 9, 1919 - April 28, 2016) was an American {{journalist}} and sportswriter who {{wrote for the}} Temple Telegram, Fort Worth Press, Dallas Times Herald and The Dallas Morning News in a career that spanned more than six decades. Voted Texas Sportswriter of the Year a record sixteen times, he was called [...] "the <b>best</b> <b>writer</b> I <b>ever</b> read" [...] by Don January and [...] "the best newspaperman I ever knew" [...] by Felix McKnight who hired Sherrod at the Times Herald in 1958. Despite not being as well known nationally {{as he was in}} Texas, he was the mentor to both Dan Jenkins and Bud Shrake.|$|R
50|$|Charles Rosen was a {{comprehensive}} musician, an outstanding pianist {{and one of}} the <b>best</b> <b>writers</b> on music <b>ever.</b> The scope of his knowledge was immense, and its depth showed on every page of his many and various books and articles, from The Classical Style to The Romantic Generation to Sonata Forms, and even to books on Schoenberg and Elliott Carter. Today's students and knowledgeable music lovers return to Rosen's writings again and again, not only to read about the great composers and their works, but to comprehend them historically and as components of the literary and dramatic traditions, which Rosen knew thoroughly.|$|R
5000|$|In the New Statesman, Jason Cowley wrote, [...] "In journalistic mode, Amis {{is without}} peer: {{when he writes}} about writers — indeed, when he writes about anyone, such as Hugh Hefner — the long profile becomes, in his hands, a capacious, {{infinitely}} flexible form in which to combine reportage, criticism, humour, exalted phrase-making, and a clear-eyed, penetrating sense of purpose...Not a month passes, but I encounter someone who has read, and been influenced by, The Moronic Inferno and Other Visits to America, a collection of journalism first published in 1986, but one that continues to enjoy a radiant afterlife. The Moronic Inferno includes some of the <b>best</b> profiles of <b>writers</b> <b>ever</b> written. They are as memorable as any postwar literary essay I have read." [...] In his study Understanding Martin Amis, critic James Diedrick called the book, [...] "A superb collection." ...|$|R
5000|$|Among {{the writers}} who claim Pancake {{as a strong}} {{influence}} are Chuck Palahniuk, author of Fight Club and Andre Dubus III, author of House of Sand and Fog. After Pancakes death, author Kurt Vonnegut {{wrote in a letter}} to John Casey, [...] "I give you my word of honor that he is merely the <b>best</b> <b>writer,</b> the most sincere <b>writer</b> Ive <b>ever</b> read. What I suspect is that it hurt too much, was no fun at all to be that good. You and I will never know." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{great ones}} don't {{just give us}} stories and {{characters}} and plots and locales. The great ones give us worlds, fully imagined, fully detailed. Nero Wolfe's brownstone. Agatha Christie's English village. Raymond Chandler's Southern California. And now, Tony Hillerman's world of Navajo culture[...] [...] [...] Hillerman has a poet's way with the land. He rightly understands that his entire drama is being played out against a ragged and rugged land that {{is as much a}} participant in the drama as Chee and Leaphorn themselves. Without getting corny or patronizing, he's able to convey the Navajo reverence for the land and to differentiate how the white man and the Native American view the planet. He is also wise enough not to depict all white people as know-nothing boobs. Boobism is, alas, something shared by all cultures. There's plenty to go around. Hillerman stage-manages all the various plot points — the brain-dead cop, the missing woman, the possible plague, the violent eagle — skillfully and subtly. None of the seams show. And he does it all with a lively, easygoing style that never calls attention to itself, never jars the reader out of the world he's creating before our eyes. There's a simple reason for Tony Hillerman's popularity. He's one of the <b>best</b> mystery <b>writers</b> who <b>ever</b> lived.|$|R
