5|$|Shaw was {{originally}} a hamlet and sub-district of Crompton, {{and appears to}} have originated as the commercial and ecclesiastic centre of Crompton because of a small chapel sited there {{dating back to the}} 16th century. Before then, Whitfield had been the largest village in Crompton. In 1872, Shaw was noted as one of three villages in Crompton. However, due to Shaw's urbanisation following the construction of a major road from Werneth to Littleborough, and the establishment of a post office sub-district named and situated in Shaw, it came to dominate Crompton. Additionally, a separate ecclesiastical parish was created for the township in 1835, which was given the name Shaw because of the church's location on Shaw Moor, in Crompton. The names merged to form the present day Shaw and Crompton, which <b>boundary</b> <b>markers</b> have used since at least the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|Although Hudson {{anticipated}} that the trip would take less than a month, it took 56 days. Most of the journey was by water, and ice on the Niagara River, inclement weather and ice on Lake Erie, and unnavigable portions of the Cuyahoga River contributed to the travelers' slow progress. Although ice on Lake Erie and the Buffalo River near Niagara Falls destroyed one boat, the group reached Cleaveland (present-day Cleveland, Ohio) on June 9, 1799. After purchasing more supplies, they set off down the Cuyahoga River. Although Hudson believed that the river could carry their boats {{as far south as}} required, they only reached present-day Northfield on June 20. When the settlers arrived in the vicinity of their parcel they had difficulty locating its four <b>boundary</b> <b>markers,</b> finding the southwest marker in late June. Only one of the two groups herding cattle overland reached the settlement.|$|E

25|$|On {{the night}} of 15 March, however, Kingi and about 80 men built an L-shaped pā, or {{defensive}} strong point, at Te Kohia, at the south-west extremity of the block, commanding the road access. The next day, they uprooted the surveyors' <b>boundary</b> <b>markers</b> and when ordered the following day, 17 March, to surrender, they refused.

25|$|In {{the state}} of Hidalgo, in which most maguey is grown, fields of this plant are disappearing, with barley taking its place. Most maguey plants here serve as <b>boundary</b> <b>markers</b> between properties. Many of these plants do not survive long, as they are often vandalized. An {{estimated}} 10,000 plants are mutilated each week by cutting off the lower leaves for barbacoa or destroying them completely {{to look for the}} edible white grubs or ant eggs that can inhabit them.|$|E
25|$|Each {{country has}} the {{responsibility}} for maintenance of its <b>boundary</b> <b>markers</b> and keeping the clear-cut zone. Most of the maintenance is undertaken during the summer. In August each year {{there is a common}} inspection of the entire border. The practical responsibility alternates between the two countries each year. It is carried out by three groups, each which cover a third of the border. Each group consists of two Norwegians and two Russians and the inspection takes two to three days. Afterwards there is a common debriefing.|$|E
25|$|The Dartmoor crosses are {{a series}} of stone crosses found in Dartmoor National Park in the centre of Devon, England. Many of them are old navigational aids, needed because of the {{remoteness}} of the moorland and its typically bad weather. Some mark medieval routes between abbeys. Other crosses were erected as memorials, for prayer, as town or market crosses, in churchyards, and as <b>boundary</b> <b>markers.</b> The crosses were erected {{over a long period of}} time, some as recently as 100 years ago, the earliest probably almost 1,000 years ago.|$|E

25|$|The Garuda {{was also}} {{adopted by the}} Royal Thai Government as its {{official}} emblem. The Garuda emblem appears on the letterhead of almost all Thai government documents. The position of the king as the earthly personification of Narayana is symbolised {{through the use of}} the Garuda. This symbolism also illustrates the belief that the government (as represented by the Garuda) is the vehicle (or instrument) of the king. The figure of the Garuda is also used as symbol of state property, and as such is displayed on government buildings, title deeds, <b>boundary</b> <b>markers</b> and in the uniforms of the Royal Thai Police and Royal Thai Armed Forces.|$|E
25|$|According to {{one theory}} that has {{received}} considerable scholarly acceptance, Hermes himself originated {{as a form of}} the god Pan, who has been identified as a reflex of the Proto-Indo-European pastoral god *Péh2usōn, in his aspect as the god of <b>boundary</b> <b>markers.</b> Later, the epithet supplanted the original name itself and Hermes took over the roles as god of messengers, travelers, and boundaries, which had originally belonged to Pan, while Pan himself continued to be venerated by his original name in his more rustic aspect as the god of the wild in the relatively isolated mountainous region of Arcadia. In later myths, after the cult of Pan was reintroduced to Attica, Pan was said to be Hermes's son.|$|E

500|$|In December 1742, the County Court of Orange County {{ordered the}} {{construction}} of another wagon road from Caudy's land to the South Branch Potomac River. In 1743, a wagon road connecting Winchester and Moorefield traversed Caudy's land using a ford in the Cacapon River. This road led to a watermill near Old Fields on the South Branch Potomac River. Due {{to the location of}} Caudy's settlement along the Winchester–Moorefield route, his residence served as an overnight stopping point for George Washington and George William Fairfax in April 1748. Washington and Fairfax were returning to Winchester en route to Belvoir following their surveying expedition in the South Branch Potomac River valley in present-day Hardy County. Washington and his surveying party stayed overnight in Caudy's log cabin.
