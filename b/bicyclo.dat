50|$|Bicyclic {{molecules}} have {{a strict}} nomenclature. The {{root of the}} compound name depends on {{the total number of}} atoms in all rings together, possibly followed by a suffix denoting the functional group with the highest priority. Numbering of the carbon chain always begins at one bridgehead atom (where the rings meet) and follows the carbon chain along the longest path, to the next bridgehead atom. Then numbering is continued along the second longest path and so on. Fused and bridged bicyclic compounds get the prefix <b>bicyclo,</b> whereas spirocyclic compounds get the prefix spiro. In between the prefix and the suffix, a pair of brackets with numerals denotes the number of carbon atoms between each of the bridgehead atoms. These numbers are arranged in descending order and are separated by periods.For example, the carbon frame of norbornane contains a total of 7 atoms, hence the root name heptane. This molecule has two paths of 2 carbon atoms and a third path of 1 carbon atom between the two bridgehead carbons, so the brackets are filled in descending order: 2.2.1. Addition of the prefix <b>bicyclo</b> gives the total name bicyclo2.2.1heptane.|$|E
50|$|Dimethyl fumarate is an ester and an α,β-unsaturated electrophilic {{compound}} {{which can}} quickly undergo Michael additions with nucleophiles. Dimethyl fumarate {{is also an}} effective diene acceptor in the thermal Diels-Alder reaction, where the reactivity of its vinylenic bond is enhanced by the two electron-withdrawing ester groups. Due to the geometry of the starting ester, the Diels-Alder product will have a trans configuration. With this reaction, compounds with <b>bicyclo</b> skeletons can be synthesized, e.g. a diester with a norbornene (bicyclo2.2.1heptene) skeleton from dimethyl fumarate and cyclopentadiene.|$|E

50|$|The carbon {{frame of}} camphor also counts 7 atoms, but is {{substituted}} with a carbonyl in this case, hence the suffix heptanone. We start with numbering the carbon frame at the bridgehead atom {{with the highest}} priority (methyl goes before proton), hence the bridgehead carbon in front gets number 1, the carbonyl gets number 2 and numbering continues along the carbon chainfollowing the longest path, until the doubly substituted top carbon (number 7). Equal to norbornane, this molecule also has two paths of 2 carbon atoms and one path of 1 carbon atom between the two bridgehead carbons, so the numbers within the brackets stay 2.2.1. Combining the brackets and suffix (now filling {{in the position of}} the carbonyl as well) gives us 2.2.1heptan-2-one. Besides <b>bicyclo,</b> the prefix should also specify the positions of all methyl substituents so the complete, official name becomes 1,7,7-trimethylbicyclo2.2.1heptan-2-one.|$|E

The derivatives substituted at the 4 -position were prepared via halogen-metal exchange reactions. Beginning with the 4 -bromo derivative of indole and the appropriate piperidone derivative, compounds 37, 38 and 39 were generated. Birch reduction of the intermediate tertiary alcohol was necessary to derive the final compounds. Syntheses of 12 and 13 also utilized the halogen-metal exchange reaction. Direct condensation under basic conditions, as was utilized in the synthesis of 11, was unsuccessful, possibly due to the formation of a double bond within a 5 -membered ring, as seen in the [2. 2. 1] <b>bicyclo</b> derivative.

It is found that the chemical modification of alkyd resin by replacing phthalic anhydride on bicyclic dicarboxylic acid anhydride allows to increase hardness, strength, adhesion of coatings formed on steel substrates...|$|E
40|$|The {{anthracycline}} antibiotic nogalamycin, which binds to DNA, {{is composed}} of a planar aglycone substituted on each end to form an unusual dumbbell-shaped molecule. At one end nogalamycin contains an uncharged nogalose sugar and a methyl ester. At the other end nogalamycin contains a positively charged <b>bicyclo</b> amino sugar. We report the crystal structure of nogalamycin bound to the self-complementary DNA hexamer d(m 5 CGTsAm 5 CG). In this complex, the cytosines are methylated at the 5 position and the DNA contains a phosphorothioate linkage at the TpA step. Two nogalamycin molecules bind to the 6 -base-pair fragment of double-helical DNA. The drug has threaded between the phosphodiester backbones with three aromatic rings intercalated within the DNA. In the major groove, the <b>bicyclo</b> amino sugar forms two direct hydrogen bonds to span a CG base pair and interacts indirectly with the next base pair of the duplex via a water-mediated hydrogen bond. In the minor groove, a carbonyl oxygen of nogalamycin forms a hydrogen bond directly to N 2 of a guanine. The DNA base pairs are severely buckled by up to 26 degrees and are also distorted in directions perpendicular to the Watson-Crick hydrogen bonds. This complex illustrates the deformable nature of DNA...|$|E
