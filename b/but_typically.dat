5|$|Biological {{pest control}} is a method of {{controlling}} pests such as insects and mites by using other organisms. It relies on predation, parasitism, herbivory or other natural mechanisms, <b>but</b> <b>typically</b> also involves an active human management role. Classical biological control involves the introduction of natural enemies of the pest that are bred in the laboratory and released into the environment. An alternative approach is to augment the natural enemies that occur {{in a particular area}} by releasing more, either in small, repeated batches, or in a single large-scale release. Ideally, the released organism will breed and survive, and provide long-term control. Biological control can be an important component of an integrated pest management programme.|$|E
5|$|Dunstanburgh Castle has closely {{associated}} with the legend of Sir Guy the Seeker since at least the early 19th century. Different versions of the story vary slightly in their details, <b>but</b> <b>typically</b> involve a knight, Sir Guy, arriving at Dunstanburgh Castle, where he was met by a wizard and led inside. There he comes across a noble lady imprisoned inside a crystal tomb and guarded by a sleeping army. The wizard offers Guy a choice of either a sword or a hunting horn to help free the lady; he incorrectly chooses the horn, which wakes the sleeping knights. Sir Guy finds himself outside Dunstanburgh Castle, and spends {{the rest of his life}} attempting to find a way back inside.|$|E

50|$|Diesel engines {{generally}} achieve greater {{fuel efficiency}} than petrol (gasoline) engines. Passenger car diesel engines have energy efficiency {{of up to}} 41% <b>but</b> more <b>typically</b> 30%, and petrol engines of up to 37.3%, <b>but</b> more <b>typically</b> 20%. That {{is one of the}} reasons why diesels have better fuel efficiency than equivalent petrol cars. A common margin is 25% more miles per gallon for an efficient turbodiesel.|$|R
5|$|From October to December each year, a {{very large}} area of south India, {{including}} Tamil Nadu, the coastal regions of Andhra Pradesh and the union territory of Puducherry, receives up to 60 percent of its annual rainfall from the northeast monsoon (or winter monsoon). The northeast monsoon {{is the result of}} the annual gradual retreat of monsoonal rains from northeastern India. Unlike during the regular monsoon, rainfall during the northeast monsoon is sporadic, <b>but</b> <b>typically</b> far exceeds the amount produced by the regular monsoon by up to 90 percent. This excessive rainfall can be exacerbated by an El Nino year, which 2015 was.|$|E

5|$|Stela 4 is {{dated to}} AD 396, {{during the reign}} of Yax Nuun Ayiin after the {{intrusion}} of Teotihuacan in the Maya area. The stela displays a mix of Maya and Teotihuacan qualities, and deities from both cultures. It has a portrait of the king with the Underworld Jaguar God under one arm and the Mexican Tlaloc under the other. His helmet is a simplified version of the Teotihuacan War Serpent. Unusually for Maya sculpture, <b>but</b> <b>typically</b> for Teotihuacan, Yax Nuun Ayiin is depicted with a frontal face, rather than in profile.|$|E

5|$|There is no {{cure for}} psoriasis; however, various {{treatments}} can help control the symptoms. These treatments include steroid creams, vitamin D3 cream, ultraviolet light and immune system suppressing medications, such as methotrexate. About 75 percent of cases can be managed with creams alone. The disease affects two to four percent of the population. Men and women are affected with equal frequency. The disease may begin at any age, <b>but</b> <b>typically</b> starts in adulthood. Psoriasis is {{associated with an increased}} risk of psoriatic arthritis, lymphomas, cardiovascular disease, Crohn's disease and depression. Psoriatic arthritis affects up to 30 percent of individuals with psoriasis.|$|E
5|$|Augmentative and {{alternative}} communication {{is used by}} individuals to compensate for severe speech-language impairments in the expression or comprehension of spoken or written language. People making use of AAC include individuals {{with a variety of}} congenital conditions such as cerebral palsy, autism, intellectual disability, and acquired conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, traumatic brain injury and aphasia. Prevalence data vary depending on the country and age/disabilities surveyed, <b>but</b> <b>typically</b> between 0.1 and 1.5% of the population are considered to have such severe speech-language impairments that they have difficulty making themselves understood, and thus could benefit from AAC. An estimated 0.05% of children and young people require high technology AAC. Well-known AAC users include physicist Stephen Hawking, broadcaster Roger Ebert and poet Christopher Nolan. Award-winning films such as My Left Foot and The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, based on books by AAC users Christy Brown and Jean-Dominique Bauby respectively, have brought the lives of those who use AAC to a wider audience.|$|E

5|$|Even {{before the}} Old Kingdom, the ancient Egyptians had {{developed}} a glassy material known as faience, which they treated {{as a type of}} artificial semi-precious stone. Faience is a non-clay ceramic made of silica, small amounts of lime and soda, and a colorant, typically copper. The material was used to make beads, tiles, figurines, and small wares. Several methods can be used to create faience, <b>but</b> <b>typically</b> production involved application of the powdered materials {{in the form of a}} paste over a clay core, which was then fired. By a related technique, the ancient Egyptians produced a pigment known as Egyptian Blue, also called blue frit, which is produced by fusing (or sintering) silica, copper, lime, and an alkali such as natron. The product can be ground up and used as a pigment.|$|E
5|$|Long-term {{misuse of}} alcohol {{can cause a}} wide range of mental health problems. Severe {{cognitive}} problems are common; approximately 10 percent of all dementia cases are related to alcohol consumption, making it the second leading cause of dementia. Excessive alcohol use causes damage to brain function, and psychological health can be increasingly affected over time. Social skills are significantly impaired in people suffering from alcoholism due to the neurotoxic effects of alcohol on the brain, especially the prefrontal cortex area of the brain. The social skills that are impaired by alcohol abuse include impairments in perceiving facial emotions, prosody perception problems and theory of mind deficits; the ability to understand humour is also impaired in alcohol abusers. Psychiatric disorders are common in alcoholics, with as many as 25 percent suffering severe psychiatric disturbances. The most prevalent psychiatric symptoms are anxiety and depression disorders. Psychiatric symptoms usually initially worsen during alcohol withdrawal, <b>but</b> <b>typically</b> improve or disappear with continued abstinence. Psychosis, confusion, and organic brain syndrome may be caused by alcohol misuse, which can lead to a misdiagnosis such as schizophrenia. Panic disorder can develop or worsen {{as a direct result of}} long-term alcohol misuse.|$|E
5|$|The first {{generation}} of Early Netherlandish painters did not usually {{pay much attention to}} landscape backgrounds. They were often included, showing strong influence from the Italian painters, <b>but</b> <b>typically</b> as minor elements of the composition, seen in the far distance and lacking any real observation of nature. This diptych, however, contains {{one of the most memorable}} landscape backgrounds in Northern 15th-century art. The panoramic view of Jerusalem extends upwards in the distance to the mountainous peaked range in the background. The sky, which continues to the upper part of the right hand panel, is rendered in deep blues and lined with cumulus clouds. These clouds are similar to those in the Ghent Altarpiece and, as in that work, are included to give depth to and enliven the background skyscape. The sky seems to have just darkened, in keeping with the idea that the panel captures the moment of Jesus' death. Faint cirrus clouds can be seen in the far high-ground, with the presence of the sun is suggested by a shadow falling on the top left area of the panel.|$|E

5|$|The middlegame is {{the part}} of the game which starts after the opening. There is no clear line between the opening and the middlegame, <b>but</b> <b>typically</b> the middlegame will start when most pieces have been developed. (Similarly, there is no clear {{transition}} from the middlegame to the endgame; see start of the endgame.) Because the opening theory has ended, players have to form plans based on the features of the position, {{and at the same time}} take into account the tactical possibilities of the position. The middlegame is the phase in which most combinations occur. Combinations are a series of tactical moves executed to achieve some gain. Middlegame combinations are often connected with an attack against the opponent's king. Some typical patterns have their own names; for example, the Boden's Mate or the Lasker–Bauer combination.|$|E
5|$|They are {{responsible}} for pollination of approximately {{one third of the}} United States' crop species, including such species as almonds, peaches, apples, pears, cherries, raspberries, blackberries, cranberries, watermelons, cantaloupes, cucumbers, and strawberries. Many, but not all, of these plants can be (and often are) pollinated by other insects in the U.S., including other kinds of bees (e.g., squash bees on cucurbits), <b>but</b> <b>typically</b> not on a commercial scale. While some farmers of a few kinds of native crops do bring in honey bees to help pollinate, none specifically need them, and when honey bees are absent from a region, there is a presumption that native pollinators may reclaim the niche, typically being better adapted to serve those plants (assuming that the plants normally occur in that specific area).|$|E
5|$|IWGC war cemeteries {{featured}} {{grass and}} flowers within a walled area, intended to resemble an English garden; almost all were constructed around a War Stone and a Cross of Sacrifice, described {{in more detail}} below. The style varied slightly by architect and location, <b>but</b> <b>typically</b> the cemeteries followed classical influences in buildings and monuments, sometimes adapted slightly to appeal to the style of a particular Dominion. The buildings at the cemeteries were important symbolically and formed a key part of these designs. The graves proved controversial: initially they were marked by wooden crosses but, after some argument, it was agreed to replace these with Portland stone markers; the original wooden memorials were in some cases returned to the soldier's next of kin. Each marker was identical in shape and individualised only through the inscription of the name, regiment, date of death, a religious symbol and a short text agreed by the next of kin. Public debate ensued about these graves throughout the 1920s. British officials were concerned about families erecting their own memorials on the sites and detracting from the appearance of the cemeteries; critics complained about the secular nature of the memorials, the limited options for families to individualise the graves and the excessive role of the IWGC in determining how the soldiers were buried.|$|E
