5|$|At {{the end of}} 1905 {{football}} {{looked about}} to be abolished due {{to all of the}} reoccurring violence during games. Football was a sport that had degenerated into dangerous tactics such as: the flying wedge, punching, kicking, piling-on, and elbows to the face. Almost any violent <b>behavior</b> <b>was</b> allowed. Fatalities and injuries mounted during the 1905 season.|$|E
5|$|According to Mifune, in 1904 Maeda lost to Yoshitake Yoshio by hane goshi, after {{defeating}} three adversaries in succession, but in {{a following}} tsukinami-shiai defeated eight adversaries {{in a row and}} was awarded the rank of 4th dan (yondan). Mifune also states that Maeda {{was one of the most}} vigorous promoters of judo, although not by teaching the art, instead generating recognition of judo through his many combats with contenders from other disciplines. Maeda treated experienced and inexperienced students alike, throwing them as if in real combat. He reasoned that this <b>behavior</b> <b>was</b> a measure of respect towards his students, but it was often misunderstood and frightened many youngsters, who would abandon him in favor of other professors.|$|E
5|$|Another {{witness who}} had {{attended}} the {{concert at the}} rear of the crowd testified that Blythe's <b>behavior</b> <b>was</b> standard to metal concerts, saying that metal bands always put on angry and tough acts and the concert at issue was no exception. She said that it was evident that Blythe did not want any fans on the stage. Neither the two nor any other witness who took the stand that day gave a testimony as to the moment of Nosek's fall at the end of the concert.|$|E
30|$|Retrospective {{rationality}} theories, unlike {{theories that}} assert that <b>behavior</b> <b>is</b> prospectively rational and consciously chosen to obtain some goal, suggest that <b>behavior</b> <b>is</b> largely under some external control and <b>behavior</b> <b>is</b> rationalized {{after the fact}} (e.g. Aronson 1972).|$|R
50|$|Abnormal <b>behavior</b> <b>is</b> {{broken up}} to two types: {{atypical}} and maladaptive. Atypical <b>behavior</b> <b>is</b> not necessarily harmful, but maladaptive <b>behavior</b> could potentially <b>be</b> harmful.|$|R
50|$|The first form of {{defensive}} <b>behavior</b> <b>is</b> evaluation. These {{are known as}} “you” statements and put all {{the focus on the}} other person. This kind of <b>behavior</b> <b>is</b> about judging the other communicator. In return the supportive <b>behavior</b> <b>is</b> description. This focuses on the communicator’s ideas rather than putting blame on someone else. Description <b>behavior</b> <b>is</b> about the feelings of the speaker and can be described as “I” statements.|$|R
5|$|As an {{intoxicated}} Holly displays erratic {{behavior at}} Heidi and Spencer's rehearsal dinner, Stephanie is dismayed by {{her lack of}} irresponsibility. After Spencer explains that her <b>behavior</b> <b>was</b> inappropriate, Holly tearfully leaves the restaurant. The next morning, she apologizes to Heidi for her actions, and confirms that an invitation has been sent to a special guest. Charlie later tells Spencer that he invited Stacie, the bartender that Heidi clashed with for flirting with Spencer, to the wedding. Meanwhile, Brody and Stephanie make peace at Lauren and Lo's farewell party, while Lauren tells Stephanie that {{she will not be}} attending the ceremony.|$|E
5|$|At the 2006 FIBA World Championship in Japan, James took on {{a greater}} role for Team USA, {{averaging}} 13.9 points, 4.8 rebounds, and 4.1 assists per game as co-captain. The team finished the tournament with an 8–1 record, winning another bronze medal. James' <b>behavior</b> <b>was</b> again questioned, this time by teammate Bruce Bowen, who confronted James during tryouts regarding his treatment of staff members.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in late 1933 and {{escalating}} {{throughout the}} first half of 1934, American Roman Catholics launched a campaign against what they deemed the immorality of American cinema. This, plus a potential government takeover of film censorship and social research seeming to indicate that movies which were seen to be immoral could promote bad <b>behavior,</b> <b>was</b> enough pressure to force the studios to capitulate to greater oversight.|$|E
50|$|Operant {{conditioning}} (or instrumental conditioning) {{is a form}} {{of learning}} in which an individual's <b>behavior</b> <b>is</b> modified by its consequences. Two complementary motivations drive instrumental learning: the maximization of positive outcomes and minimization of aversive ones. There are two ways in which <b>behavior</b> <b>is</b> reinforced or strengthened: positive reinforcement occurs when a <b>behavior</b> <b>is</b> strengthened by producing some desirable consequence; negative reinforcement occurs when a <b>behavior</b> <b>is</b> strengthened by avoiding some undesirable consequence. There are two ways in which <b>behavior</b> <b>is</b> decreased or weakened: negative punishment occurs when a <b>behavior</b> <b>is</b> weakened by not producing a reinforcing consequence; and positive punishment occurs when a <b>behavior</b> <b>is</b> weakened by producing a consequence that is a disincentive. In combination, these basic reinforcing and punishing contingencies provide four ways for modifying behavior. Reinforcement increases the relative probability or frequency of the behavior it follows, while punishment decreases the relative probability or frequency of the behaviour it follows.|$|R
5000|$|In his 1943 cybernetic {{classification}} [...] "Behavior, Purpose and Teleology", purpose <b>is</b> a <b>behavior</b> subclass. <b>Behavior</b> <b>is</b> active or {{passive and}} active <b>behavior</b> <b>is</b> purposeful or random. Active purposeful <b>behavior</b> <b>is</b> then either feedback teleological on non-teleological. Negative feedback {{is important to}} guide the positive goal route. Purposeful teleological feedback helps guide the predictive <b>behavior</b> orders. Teleology <b>is</b> feedback controlled purpose.|$|R

5|$|By most {{accounts}} Allen's first marriage was an unhappy one. His wife was rigidly religious, prone to criticizing him, and {{barely able to}} read and write. In contrast, Allen's <b>behavior</b> <b>was</b> sometimes quite flamboyant; and he maintained an interest in learning. In spite of these differences the marriage survived until Mary's death in 1783. Allen and Mary had five children together (Loraine, Joseph, Lucy, Mary, and Pamela), only two of whom reached adulthood.|$|E
5|$|Further {{separation}} {{was carried}} out {{in the presence of a}} citric acid/ammonium buffer solution in a weakly acidic medium (pH≈3.5), using ion exchange at elevated temperature. The chromatographic separation <b>behavior</b> <b>was</b> then unknown for the element 97, but was anticipated by analogy with terbium (see elution curves). First results were disappointing as no alpha-particle emission signature could be detected from the elution product. Only the further search for characteristic X-rays and conversion electron signals resulted in the identification of a berkelium isotope. Its mass number was uncertain between 243 and 244 in the initial report, but was later established as 243.|$|E
5|$|Halfway through Gather Together, an {{incident}} occurs that demonstrates {{the different ways}} in which Rita and her grandmother handle racism. Rita, when she is insulted by white clerk during a visit to Stamps, reacts with defiance, but when Momma hears about the confrontation, she slaps Rita and sends her back to California. Rita feels that her personhood was being violated, but the practical Momma knows that her granddaughter's <b>behavior</b> <b>was</b> dangerous. Rita's grandmother is no longer an important influence on her life, and Angelou demonstrates that she had to move on in the fight against racism.|$|E
5000|$|Only {{observable}} <b>behavior</b> <b>is</b> to be assessed: A crew members' personality {{or emotional}} attitudes are ignored during the evaluation, and only visible <b>behavior</b> <b>is</b> recorded.|$|R
5000|$|Violation valences are {{determined}} by three factors: (1) The evaluation of the behavior; (2) {{whether or not the}} <b>behavior</b> <b>is</b> more or less favorable than the expectation; and (3) the magnitude of the violation. A positive violation occurs when the <b>behavior</b> <b>is</b> more favorable than the expectation. A negative violation occurs when the <b>behavior</b> <b>is</b> less favorable.|$|R
50|$|Social <b>behavior</b> <b>is</b> <b>behavior</b> among {{two or more}} organisms, {{typically}} {{from the}} same species.

5|$|In {{the week}} {{leading up to}} the 25th, French, German, and British {{soldiers}} crossed trenches to exchange seasonal greetings and talk. In some areas, men from both sides ventured into no man's land on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day to mingle and exchange food and souvenirs. There were joint burial ceremonies and prisoner swaps, while several meetings ended in carol-singing. Men played games of football (soccer) with one another, giving {{one of the most memorable}} images of the truce. Peaceful <b>behavior</b> <b>was</b> not ubiquitous; fighting continued in some sectors, while in others the sides settled on little more than arrangements to recover bodies.|$|E
5|$|Majungasaurus was a {{main focus}} of the fifth episode of the mini-series When Dinosaurs Ruled hosted by Jeff Goldblum. It also {{featured}} in the pilot episode of Jurassic Fight Club, in which its cannibalistic <b>behavior</b> <b>was</b> explored. In both series, the animal {{was referred to as}} Majungatholus. It was properly referred to as Majungasaurus in the third episode of BBC's Planet Dinosaur, in which its killing technique as well as its cannibalistic nature were explored.|$|E
5|$|Marsh {{and then}} Hatcher {{assumed that the}} animal was aquatic, because of the {{position}} of its nasal openings at the apex of the cranium. Similar aquatic <b>behavior</b> <b>was</b> commonly depicted for other large sauropods, such as Brachiosaurus and Apatosaurus. A 1951 study by Kenneth A. Kermack indicates that sauropods probably could not have breathed through their nostrils {{when the rest of the}} body was submerged, as the water pressure on the chest wall would be too great. Since the 1970s, general consensus has the sauropods as firmly terrestrial animals, browsing on trees, ferns, and bushes.|$|E

2500|$|When social ants {{encounter}} ants {{from another}} colony, <b>behavior</b> can <b>be</b> either aggressive or non-aggressive. Aggressive <b>behavior</b> <b>is</b> very commonly seen; the attacking worker usually bites the opponent at the petiole. In non-aggressive behavior, antennation {{occurs when the}} two ants meet. In the case of Monomorium pharaonis, <b>behavior</b> <b>is</b> almost always non-aggressive even when the ants are from different colonies and of different castes. [...] Very few cases exist where aggressive <b>behavior</b> <b>is</b> seen in these ants.|$|R

5|$|O'Neal {{played in}} two more games before the NBA's case was {{brought before the}} U.S. District Court in Brooklyn, New York on December 30. The NBA argued that {{under the terms of}} the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA), Stern had {{absolute}} authority to hand out suspensions and hear appeals for all on-court incidents. But the judge ruled that because O'Neal's <b>behavior</b> <b>was</b> an off-court incident, arbitration was allowed under the CBA, and thus the arbitrator was within his rights to reduce the suspension. Despite O'Neal's successful appeal, no further appeals were made to reduce Artest's and Jackson's suspensions.|$|E
5|$|River otters are {{renowned for}} {{their sense of}} play. Otter play mostly {{consists}} of wrestling with conspecifics. Chasing is also a common game. River otters rely upon play to learn survival skills such as fighting and hunting. However, playful <b>behavior</b> <b>was</b> found in only 6% of 294 observations in a study in Idaho, and was limited mostly to immature otters.|$|E
5|$|The most {{extensive}} early study of female homosexuality {{was provided by}} the Institute for Sex Research, who published an in-depth report of the sexual experiences of American women in 1953. More than 8,000 women were interviewed by Alfred Kinsey and the staff of the Institute for Sex Research in a book titled Sexual Behavior in the Human Female, popularly known as part of the Kinsey Report. The Kinsey Report's dispassionate discussion of homosexuality as a form of human sexual <b>behavior</b> <b>was</b> revolutionary. Up to this study, only physicians and psychiatrists studied sexual behavior, and almost always the results were interpreted with a moral view.|$|E

5|$|The olive baboon also {{actively}} hunts prey, {{from small}} rodents and hares to foxes and other primates. Its limit is usually small antelope, such as Thomson's gazelle and also, rarely, sheep, goats, and live chickens, which may amount to 33.5% of its food from hunting. Hunting {{is usually a}} group activity, with {{both males and females}} participating. Interestingly, this systematic predation was apparently developed recently. In a field study, such <b>behavior</b> <b>was</b> observed as starting with the males of one troop and spreading through all ages and sexes.|$|E
5|$|The work of Krafft-Ebing and Ellis {{was widely}} read, {{and helped to}} create public {{consciousness}} of female homosexuality. The sexologists' claims that homosexuality was a congenital anomaly were generally well-accepted by homosexual men; it indicated that their <b>behavior</b> <b>was</b> not inspired by nor {{should be considered a}} criminal vice, as was widely acknowledged. In the absence of any other material to describe their emotions, homosexuals accepted the designation of different or perverted, and used their outlaw status to form social circles in Paris and Berlin. Lesbian began to describe elements of a subculture.|$|E
5|$|Unlike most animals, {{whales are}} {{conscious}} breathers. All mammals sleep, but whales cannot afford to become unconscious for long {{because they may}} drown. They are believed to exhibit unihemispheric slow-wave sleep, in which they sleep {{with half of the}} brain while the other half remains active. This <b>behavior</b> <b>was</b> only documented in toothed whales until footage of a humpback whale sleeping (vertically) was shot in 2014.|$|E
