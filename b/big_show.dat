5|$|The other {{featured}} preliminary {{match was}} Kurt Angle versus The <b>Big</b> <b>Show</b> in a singles match. The buildup to the match began on September 9, 2004 during {{an episode of}} SmackDown!, where a Lumberjack match (a standard match where non-participating wrestlers prevent contestants from fleeing the ring) was scheduled between Kurt Angle and Eddie Guerrero. The match ended in a no contest when The <b>Big</b> <b>Show</b> marked his return to SmackDown! by interfering in the match, chokeslamming both Angle and Guerrero in the process. The following week, <b>Big</b> <b>Show</b> was given two contracts to choose from; one contract to face Guerrero and one contract to face Angle. <b>Big</b> <b>Show</b> signed the contract with Guerrero's name on it.

As part of the segment, <b>Big</b> <b>Show</b> destroyed Swagger's trophies and memorabilia. The following week, <b>Big</b> <b>Show</b> mocked Swagger in promos throughout the show and distracted Swagger during Swagger's match with Kofi Kingston, allowing Kingston to win.|$|E

5|$|At Royal Rumble on January 23, 2000, The Rock {{entered the}} Royal Rumble match {{and was one}} of the final two remaining, along with Big Show; Show {{seemingly}} intended to throw The Rock over the top rope in a running powerslam-like position, but Rock countered the move on the ring apron, sending <b>Big</b> <b>Show</b> to the floor before re-entering the ring as the winner. However, The Rock's feet hit the floor first, although those watching the event on TV did not see that, until <b>Big</b> <b>Show</b> proved this with additional video footage, and claimed to be the rightful winner. Despite this proof, the original decision could not be reversed, so a number one contender's match for the WWF Championship was held at No Way Out, which <b>Big</b> <b>Show</b> won after Shane McMahon interfered and hit The Rock in the head with a steel chair as he attempted to execute a People's Elbow. The Rock defeated <b>Big</b> <b>Show</b> on March 13 episode of Raw Is War to regain the right to face the WWF Champion, Triple H, at WrestleMania 2000 in a fatal four-way elimination match, also including <b>Big</b> <b>Show</b> and Mick Foley.

Once he was in the ring, The Undertaker began to choke Guerrero, but the <b>Big</b> <b>Show</b> turned heel, becoming a villainous character, by striking The Undertaker and freeing Guerrero.
