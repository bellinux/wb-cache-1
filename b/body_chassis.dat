It {{was the first time}} in 90 years that Ford cars had not been made in Britain, although production of the Transit van continued at the company's Southampton facility until mid-2013, engines at Bridgend and Dagenham, and transmissions at Halewood. Development of European Ford is broadly split between Dunton in Essex (powertrain, Fiesta/Ka, and commercial vehicles) and Cologne (<b>body,</b> <b>chassis,</b> electrical, Focus, Mondeo) in Germany. Ford also produced the Thames range of commercial vehicles, although the use of this brand name was discontinued circa 1965.|$|E

50|$|The Elan ceased {{production}} in 1973 and the Elan +2 in 1975, {{replaced by the}} Elite II and Lotus Eclat. An estimated total of 17,000 original Elans and Elans +2 were built. Because of its successful design and rigorous attention to cost control on the <b>body,</b> <b>chassis,</b> engine and the transmission, the Elan {{went on to become}} Lotus' first commercial success, reviving a company stretched thin by the more exotic and expensive to build Lotus Elite with fiberglass monocoque body/chassis and all-aluminium Coventry Climax engine; and enabled funding of the Lotus success in racing over the next ten years.|$|E
5000|$|The {{transition}} {{of the bus}} manufacturing subsidiary of Navistar began in 2000 as AmTran introduced a new-generation cowled-chassis conventional. While still based upon the International 3800 and sharing much of the body with its AmTran Volunteer/CS predecessor, the new bus featured a redesigned drivers compartment and larger windshield. The new bus was given the International IC name (IC standing for Integrated Coach/Chassis), the model emphasized how the entire vehicle (<b>body,</b> <b>chassis,</b> engine) was produced under a single corporate entity. To distinguish the IC from other Type C buses sharing the International 3800 chassis, the IC was given its own grille and hood badging.|$|E
5000|$|Penned by Etienne Planche under {{direction}} from Louis Chevrolet, the Chevy with its low running boards had a design more resembling European cars. Radiator shell and Chevrolet nameplate {{on the dashboard}} (the [...] "bow-tie" [...] emblem did not appear until the 1914 Chevrolet Series H and L models) were polished metal, the <b>body,</b> <b>chassis</b> and wheels were only Chevrolet blue. The hood, fenders, and splash aprons were black. Light gray striping {{was found on the}} body and wheels. The first prototype car appeared in late 1911, and Louis Chevrolet himself tested it on the back streets of Detroit. Throughout 1912 refinements were made to the design. Later in that same year the new 1913 model was released at the New York Auto Show.|$|E

The same <b>body</b> shapes and <b>chassis</b> were used for Hillman's 16 horsepower offering though that smaller engine was not offered with their long wheelbase cars.|$|R
25|$|Some smaller {{vehicles}} were also produced alongside model track workers, passengers, station staff and other O scale track side accessories (Meccano Dinky 1934 p.332). All {{of these early}} cars were inaccurate representations and had die-cast metal <b>bodies,</b> <b>chassis</b> and wheels with rubber tyres. By August 1935 there were around 200 different products in the Dinky Toys range which included die-cast ships, aeroplanes and small trains. Dinky Toys model cars were available individually in trade packs of 6 cars per pack. Most models would not be available in individual boxes until 1952.|$|R
