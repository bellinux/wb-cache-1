40|$|Abstract Background Dual energy x-ray {{absorptiometry}} (DXA) {{is widely}} used for body composition measurements in normal-weight and overweight/obese individuals. The limitations of <b>bone</b> <b>densitometers</b> have been frequently addressed. However, the possible errors in assessing body composition in overweight individuals due to incorrect positioning or limitations of DXA to accurately assess both bone mineral density and body composition in obese individuals have not received much attention and {{are the focus of}} this report. Discussion We discuss proper ways of measuring overweight individuals and point to some studies where that might not have been the case. It appears that currently, the most prudent approach to assess body composition of large individuals who cannot fit under the scanning area would be to estimate regional fat, namely the regions of thigh and/or abdomen. Additionally, using two-half body scans, although time consuming, may provide a relatively accurate measurement of total body fat, however, more studies using this technique are needed to validate it. Summary Researchers using <b>bone</b> <b>densitometers</b> for body composition measurements need to have an understanding of its limitations in overweight individuals and address them appropriately when interpreting their results. Studies on accuracy and precision in measurements of both bone and soft tissue composition in overweight individuals using available densitometers are needed. </p...|$|E

40|$|We {{analysed}} thirty {{healthy children}} (15 boys and 15 girls) and four patients under steroid therapy on bone mineral density (BMD), using a newly developed ultrasound <b>bone</b> <b>densitometer.</b> BMD was estimated with {{the value of}} stiffness of bone, which was calculated with SOS and BUA. The stiffness in boys increased from 75 to 96 in parallel with aging, as a regression line of Y= 67. 58 ± 2. 27 X. And those in girls showed a regression line of Y= 68. 38 + 1. 40 X, ranging from 67 to 88. These results were correlative to those using DEXA.

40|$|We {{previously}} {{showed that}} it is possible to cross-calibrate peripheral <b>bone</b> <b>densitometers</b> using the European Spine Phantom (ESP), We have now performed a multinational study of cross-calibrated radius bone density based on normal subjects of both sexes in eight European centers. Six centers were equipped with machines made by Scanco or Stratec for determining distal radial trabecular bone density by quantitative computed tomography (QCT) and two were equipped with Lunar SP 2 single photon absorptiometry (SPA) equipment for measuring midshaft cortical bone density. Subjects recruited ranged from 20 to over 80 years of age, Over one hundred and fifteen men were studied by QCT and a different cohort of 104 men were studied with SPA; the equivalent figures for women were 235 and 123. Reference ranges were derived for bone density against age for each of the four groups, and their applicability is discussed in relation to between-center differences in the results obtained, There were insignificant differences (P > 0. 05 with Bonferroni correction) between centers in the values obtained by QCT in the different populations. However, there were considerably larger and highly statistically significant differences between midshaft cortical bone density values of about 10 % of overall means between subjects from eastern Finland and central Belgium (P < 0. 001), with higher Finnish values. Women had considerably lower radial trabecular bone density values than men at all ages, a result that differentiates the radius from the spine. This sex difference widened after menopause. These results have important implications for understanding the contribution of bone density to the differential risk of Colles' fracture in the two sexes and suggest that further work is needed to establish young normal reference ranges for radial bone density in Europe. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Osteoporosis is {{currently}} defined {{on the basis}} of the T-score by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Despite its limitations, this definition is applied worldwide. However, the normal values provided by manufacturers may not be fully representative of specific local populations. So far, there are no normative data in the Italian population using Hologic densitometers. The Densitometric Italian Normative Study (DINS) is an ongoing multi-center study that aims to establish reference values for bone densitometry with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) in the male and female Italian population. In this paper we report the results of the lumbar vertebrae (L 2 -L 4) and proximal femur in 1, 622 women aged 20 - 79 years. Bone mineral density (BMD) was determined using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) on Hologic <b>bone</b> <b>densitometers</b> (Hologic, Waltham, Mass.). Most of the subjects were examined with a QDR 4500. The BMD of the lumbar vertebrae was virtually constant between 20 and 49 years (test for trend: P= 0. 66); the BMD values between 20 - 45 in premenopausal women (mean 1. 036; SD 0. 109 g/cm(2)) were thus defined as the peak bone mass values, significantly lower compared to the Hologic reference curve (mean 1. 079, SD 0. 11 g/cm(2)). The mean BMD values of the femoral neck were virtually identical to those of the NHANES study in the first 3 decades; after the age of 50 the BMD values were slightly greater than those of the NHANES subject. The subject classification according to the WHO criteria was similar using the DINS and NHANES reference values for the femur; for the spine, the Hologic reference values classified a larger proportion of women as osteoporotic (21 vs. 16 %) or osteopenic (42 vs. 38 %) compared to DINS...|$|E
40|$|Osteoporosis is {{a common}} disease with a strong genetic {{component}} characterized by reduced bone mass and {{an increased risk of}} fragility fractures. Bone mineral density (BMD) is the most important determinant of osteoporotic fracture risk, but the genes responsible for BMD regulation and fracture are incompletely defined. To enable multi-center studies to examine the genetic influences on BMD there is a requirement to standardize measurements across different manufacturers of <b>bone</b> <b>densitometers,</b> different versions of machines and different normative ranges. This paper describes a method developed to allow near-identical subjects with low age-adjusted BMD (based on Z-scores) to be recruited in 17 centers using 27 different densitometers. Cross-calibration was based on measurements using a European spine phantom circulated to all centers and measured ten times on each individual machine. From theses values an individual exponential curve, based on nominal versus observed BMD, was derived for each machine. As expected, there were large and significant variations in nominal BMD values, not only between scanners from different manufacturers but also between different versions of scanners from the same manufacturer. Hologic scanners tended to underestimate the nominal BMD, while Lunar scanners overestimated the value. Norland scanners gave mixed values over estimating BMD at the lower nominal value (0. 5 g/cm 2) while underestimating the value at the higher value (1. 5 g/cm 2). The validity of the exponential equations was tested using hip and spine measurements on 991 non-proband women from a familial osteoporosis study (FAMOS). After cross-calibration there was a considerable reduction in variation between machines. This observation, coupled with the absence of a similar reduction in variation attributable to a linear regression on age, demonstrated the validity of the cross-calibration approach. Use of the cross-calibration curves along with a standard normative range (in the case of this study, the Hologic normative range) allowed age-specific Z-scores to be used as an inclusion criterion in this genetic study, a method that will be useful for other trials where age-specific BMD inclusion criteria are required...|$|E

VFA, a method for imaging thoracolumbar spine on <b>bone</b> <b>densitometer,</b> was developed because vertebral fractures, although common and predictive of future fractures, are often not clinically diagnosed. The study objective {{was to develop a}} strategy for selecting patients for VFA. A convenience sample from a university hospital bone densitometry center included 892 subjects (795 women) referred for bone mineral density (BMD) testing. We used questionnaires to capture clinical risk factors and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry to obtain BMD and VFA. Prevalence of vertebral fractures was 18 % in women and 31 % in men (p[*]=[*] 0. 003 for gender difference). In women, age, height loss, glucocorticoid use, history of vertebral and other fractures, and BMD T-score were significantly and independently associated with vertebral fractures. A multivariate model which included above predictors had an area under the receiver operating curve of 0. 85 with 95 % confidence interval (CI) of 0. 81 to 0. 89. A risk factor index was derived from the above multivariate model. Using a level of 2 as a cut-off yielded 93 % sensitivity (95 % CI 87, 96) and 48 % specificity (95 % CI 69, 83). Assuming a 15 % prevalence of vertebral fractures, this cut-off value had a 24 % positive and 97 % negative predictive value and required VFA scanning of three women at a cost of $ 60 (assuming a $ 20 cost/VFA scan) to detect one with vertebral fracture(s).

40|$|We {{described}} {{a method for}} automatically identifying and separating pixels representing bone from those representing soft tissue in a dual- energy point-scanned projection radiograph of the abdomen. In order to achieve stable quantitative measurement of projected bone mineral density, a calibration using sample bone in regions containing only soft tissue must be performed. In addition, the projected area of bone must be measured. We show that, using an image with a realistically low noise, the histogram of pixel values exhibits a well-defined peak corresponding to the soft tissue region. A threshold at a fixed multiple of the calibration segment value readily separates bone from soft tissue {{in a wide variety}} of patient studies. Our technique, which is employed in the Hologic QDR- 1000 <b>Bone</b> <b>Densitometer,</b> is rapid, robust, and significantly simpler than a conventional artificial intelligence approach using edge-detection to define objects and expert systems to recognize them...|$|R
40|$|Background: Reduction of {{bone mineral}} density (BMD) is a known and {{established}} phenomenon in {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD). However, {{there have been}} no data regarding osteoporosis/osteopenia in COPD patients in India. Aim: To look for the degree and frequency of osteoporosis/osteopenia in our OPD patients being diagnosed as COPD. Materials and Methods: Thirty-seven randomly selected patients with COPD were assessed for BMD with commercially available ultrasound <b>bone</b> <b>densitometer</b> (HOLOGIC SAHARA) in a pulmonary OPD. Some cofactors for reduced BMD were also noted. Results: Out of the 37 COPD (all belonging to the GOLD III/IV category) patients studied, the BMD was found to be normal in 10 (27 %) patients, while 27 (73 %) patients were found to have osteopenia/osteoporosis [19 (51. 35 %) and 8 (21. 62 %) patients having osteopenia and osteoporosis, respectively]. Conclusion: Frequency of osteoporosis and osteopenia was found to be very high (73 %) in our population of advanced COPD. The data suggest a need for further in-depth study regarding the issue...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To explore {{potential}} {{factors that}} could be associated with low bone mineral density (BMD) in female endurance runners. Methods: Fifty two female endurance runners (1500 m to marathon), aged 18 – 44 years, took part. Body fat percentage, lumbar spine BMD, and femoral neck BMD were measured using the Hologic QDR 4500 w <b>bone</b> <b>densitometer.</b> Data on training, menstrual cycle status, osteoporosis, and health related factors were obtained by questionnaire. Dietary variables were assessed from a prospective seven day dietary record of macronutrients and micronutrients. Results: The mean (SD) lumbar spine and femoral neck BMD were 1. 11 (0. 11) and 0. 89 (0. 12) g/cm 2 respectively. A backward elimination regression analysis showed that age, body mass, body fat, distance run, magnesium, and zinc intake were the variables significantly associated with BMD.

We recruited 1, 143 adolescents {{with a mean age}} of 14. 8 ± 1. 8 years (501 boys and 642 girls). The subjectsʼ calcaneus QUS-SI was measured using an ultrasound <b>bone</b> <b>densitometer.</b> We also measured the subjectsʼ height, weight, and grip strength. Data on prenatal and postnatal factors were obtained from maternal and child health handbooks. A self-reporting questionnaire was used to obtain information on subjectsʼ secondary sexual characteristics and lifestyle factors. We found that maternal weight gain during pregnancy was independently associated with calcaneus QUS-SI in girls, and that grip strength was also significantly associated with calcaneus QUS-SI in both sexes. The present findings suggest that excessive restriction of maternal weight gain would have a negative effect on the calcaneus QUS-SI of girls, and that exercise and strength-building activities are likely to result in a higher calcaneus QUS-SI in both sexes of adolescents...|$|R

40|$|Objective: to {{estimate}} {{the time course of}} bone mineral density (BMD) changes during 4 -year rituximab (RTM) therapy in postmenopausal women with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Subjects and methods. Seventy-nine postmenopausal women with a valid diagnosis of RA were followed up. According to the basic therapy option, all the patients were allocated into two groups: 1) 44 patients who received combination therapy with RTM and methotrexate (MT); 2) 35 patients who had MT monotherapy. BMD was estimated by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry using an Excell XR- 46 stationary dualenergy X-ray <b>bone</b> <b>densitometer</b> (Norland, USA). Results. There was a statistically significant increase in femoral neck BMD and T score as compared to the baseline values in the RTM group after 3 years of follow-up. The MT monotherapy group showed no statistically significant densitometric changes in the femoral neck. The similar positive BMD changes were observed 4 years following RTM and MT therapy. Conclusion. Following 2 therapy cycles, femoral neck BMD parameters were noted to be stabilized in the patients with RA. After 3 therapy cycles, there was a positive densitometric change that remained by the fourth therapy cycle. </p...|$|R

Subjects and methods. 132 patients with the significant RA diagnose are included into the research among them there are 80 males (the main group), 28 females with retained menstrual cycle, 24 females in post-menopause. The control group (for the main) is 84 males without RA compared by the age. MBD {{was measured by the}} method of double-energetic absorptiometry with the help stationary radiological double-energetic <b>bone</b> <b>densitometer</b> Exceell XR- 46 (Norland, USA). Results. The patients with RA had the significant decreasing of T-criteria and MBD in comparison with indexes of the control group. The average meaning of densitometric indexes at the males with the 3 rd activity degree were significantly lower than at the males with the 2 nd activity degree. The most risk of osteoporosis (OP) development has been noted at the males and females in post-menopause at the 3 rd activity degree. RA at the males is reasonable to consider as a prognostic marker of unfavorable influence on MBD and high activity as a risk factor of OP development associated with the disease itself...|$|R
