25|$|Doberman Pinschers {{are well}} known as intelligent, alert, and tenaciously loyal companions and guard dogs. Personality varies a great deal between each individual, but if taken care of and trained {{properly}} {{they tend to be}} loving and devoted companions. The Doberman is driven, strong, and sometimes stubborn. Owning one requires commitment and care, but if trained well, they can <b>be</b> <b>wonderful</b> family dogs. With a consistent approach they can be easy to train and will learn very quickly. As with all dogs, if properly trained, they can be excellent with children.|$|E

[...] Her health began to {{deteriorate}} not long after her final screen appearance, and she was hospitalized in March 1993 for exhaustion. In the winter of 1996, she was hospitalized with pneumonia. By 1997, she had become very weak, was speaking and eating very little, and it was feared she would die. She showed signs of dementia in her final years. In May 2003, an aggressive tumor was found in Hepburn's neck. The decision was made not to medically intervene, and she died on June 29, 2003, a month after her 96th birthday at the Hepburn family home in Fenwick, Connecticut. She was buried in Cedar Hill Cemetery in Hartford. Hepburn requested that there be no memorial service.|$|E

Kaling was proud of their acting, though she admitted that their presence on set was at first [...] "mortifying." [...] She commented, [...] "Of course I sort of lapsed back into that pre-teen attitude of every single thing my parents do embarrasses me. But they were great about it. They were such pros – they had all these scenes with Steve Carell and they were completely unafraid. They got along effortlessly." [...] Kaling injected elements of Romeo and Juliet and Pride and Prejudice into her character's relationship with Ryan, with her parents attempting to persuade her to date an Indian doctor. She remarked, [...] "Kelly's family has, like, nine daughters, and if only they could marry them off it would <b>be</b> <b>wonderful.</b> But Kelly is {{the oldest and most}} idiotic of them all." ...|$|E

500|$|Ede Teller {{was born}} on January 15, 1908, in Budapest, Hungary (then part of Austria-Hungary), into a Jewish family. His parents were Ilona (born Deutsch), a pianist, and Max Teller, an attorney. He later became an agnostic. [...] "Religion {{was not an issue}} in my family", he later wrote, [...] "indeed, it was never discussed. My only {{religious}} training came because the Minta required that all students take classes in their respective religions. My family celebrated one holiday, the Day of Atonement, when we all fasted. Yet my father said prayers for his parents on Saturdays and on all the Jewish holidays. The idea of God that I absorbed was that it would <b>be</b> <b>wonderful</b> if He existed: We needed Him desperately but had not seen Him in many thousands of years." [...] Like Einstein and Feynman, Teller was a late talker. He developed the ability to speak later than most children but became very interested in numbers, and would calculate large numbers in his head for fun.|$|E
500|$|Rado {{described}} {{the inspiration for}} Hair as [...] "a combination of some characters we met in the streets, people we knew and our own imaginations. [...] We knew this group of kids in the East Village who were dropping out and dodging the draft, and there were also lots of articles in the press about how kids were being kicked {{out of school for}} growing their hair long". [...] He recalled, [...] "There was so much excitement in the streets and the parks and the hippie areas, and we thought if we could transmit this excitement to the stage it would <b>be</b> <b>wonderful....</b> We hung out with them and went to their Be-Ins [...] let our hair grow." [...] Many cast members (Shelley Plimpton in particular) were recruited right off the street. [...] Rado said, [...] "It was very important historically, and if we hadn't written it, there'd not be any examples. [...] You could read about it and see film clips, but you'd never experience it. [...] We thought, 'This is happening in the streets,' and we wanted to bring it to the stage." ...|$|E

They can <b>be</b> <b>wonderful</b> Jews, fully deserving of our love, respect, and support. They {{should be encouraged to}} seek professional guidance. Moreover, in an uninfected Torah society, appropriate sympathy for discreet shomrei Torah u'mitzvos who experience but do not act upon ssa is clearly distinguished from brazen public identification of their yetzer hara [...] for forbidden behavior. ...|$|E

2500|$|Irwin {{said in an}} {{interview}} in 2000 that the greatest disappointment of his career was not at the British Open, but at the 1984 U.S. Open at Winged Foot. Irwin had led the tournament after the first three rounds, but shot a final round of 79 to finish 6th. Reflecting on his final round collapse, Irwin said: [...] "A number of factors were in play and it was very emotional. I thought it would be great to win 10 years later at the same venue and, more than anything else, my father was dying of cancer then and I thought it would <b>be</b> <b>wonderful</b> to give him a victory. I destroyed myself with the pressures I'd built up." ...|$|E
2500|$|While {{there have}} been no {{proposals}} to restore Amtrak service to Nashville, {{there have been}} repeated calls from residents. However, Tennessee state officials have advised it will not be happening anytime soon due to scarce federal funding. [...] "It would <b>be</b> <b>wonderful</b> to say I can be in Memphis and jump on a train to Nashville, but the volume of people who would do that isn't anywhere close to what the cost would be to provide the service," [...] said Ed Cole, chief of environment and planning with the Tennessee Department of Transportation. Ross Capon, executive director of the National Association of Railroad Passengers, said rail trips would catch on if routes were expanded, but conceded that it would be nearly impossible to resume Amtrak service to Nashville without a substantial investment from the state because federal money has dried up.|$|E

On a whim, she suggested a show about a mother and daughter but had put little thought into the idea. Having to create a pilot, she drew inspiration for the show's setting of [...] "Stars Hollow, Connecticut" [...] after making a trip to Washington Depot, Connecticut, where she stayed at the Mayflower Inn. She explained: [...] "If I can make people feel this much of what I felt walking around this fairy town, I thought that would <b>be</b> <b>wonderful</b> ... At the time I was there, it was beautiful, it was magical, and it was feeling of warmth and small-town camaraderie ... There was a longing for that in my own life, and I thought—that's something that I would really love to put out there." ...|$|E

2500|$|The 20th century {{historian}} of Paris René Héron de Villefosse {{shared the same}} view of Haussmann's renovation: [...] "in less than twenty years, Paris lost its ancestral appearance, its [...] character which passed from generation to generation... the picturesque and charming ambiance which our fathers had passed onto us was demolished, often without good reason." [...] Héron de Villefosse denounced Haussmann's central market, Les Halles, as [...] "a hideous eruption" [...] of cast iron. [...] Describing Haussmann's renovation of the Île de la Cité, he wrote: [...] "the old ship of Paris was torpedoed by Baron Haussmann and sunk during his reign. It was perhaps the greatest crime of the megalomaniac prefect and also his biggest mistake...His work caused more damage than a hundred bombings. It was in part necessary, and one should {{give him credit for}} his self-confidence, but he was certainly lacking culture and good taste...In the United States, it would <b>be</b> <b>wonderful,</b> but in our capital, which he covered with barriers, scaffolds, gravel, and dust for twenty years, he committed crimes, errors, and showed bad taste." ...|$|E
2500|$|On April 14, 2012, former Guns N' Roses members Slash, Duff McKagan, Gilby Clarke, Steven Adler and Matt Sorum all reunited at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The group {{performed}} [...] "Mr. Brownstone", [...] "Sweet Child o' Mine", and [...] "Paradise City" [...] with Alter Bridge and Slash's band vocalist Myles Kennedy in Rose's absence. Slash {{mentioned in}} an interview that [...] "All things considered, I don't think any of us {{wanted to be a part}} of it initially, didn't think any of us were going to go. It was a thorn in everybody's—well, at least a thorn in my side—because I was busy doing other stuff. When it finally came down to the wire at the very, very, very last-minute—I'm talking about the 11 hours and 30 seconds mark—Axl had pulled out." [...] In the same interview, Slash mentioned the prospects of a reunion, stating [...] "It's not even something I like to dwell on. I don't even like to make comments because you end up with quotes that sometimes exacerbate the issue. I've got other things going on. I'm very, very proud—endlessly proud—of everything the band stood for and everything that's gone on with it." [...] Slash then stated in a July 2012 interview that [...] " [...] will 'never reunite'". In a later interview, former drummer Steven Adler stated that Matt Sorum would not take part in a potential reunion unless Adler was involved. Duff McKagan said in 2015, [...] " [...] could happen, and it could not. And I think it would <b>be</b> <b>wonderful,</b> one day, if we reconciled, first and foremost.
