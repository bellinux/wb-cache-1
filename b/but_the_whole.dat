5|$|Ulriken Tunnel {{represents}} the largest bottleneck on the Bergen Line, {{due to the}} commuter trains to Arna. Building double track on the westernmost part of Bergensbanen would free up capacity not only of {{that part of the}} line, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> line across the mountains.|$|E
5|$|Aspasia, who {{was noted}} for her {{ability as a}} conversationalist and adviser, was accused of corrupting the women of Athens {{in order to satisfy}} Pericles' perversions. The accusations against her were {{probably}} nothing more than unproven slanders, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> experience was very bitter for Pericles. Although Aspasia was acquitted thanks to a rare emotional outburst of Pericles, his friend, Phidias, died in prison and another friend of his, Anaxagoras, was attacked by the ecclesia for his religious beliefs.|$|E
6000|$|... 54. I {{can recall}} any single object {{or group of}} objects, <b>but</b> not <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> table at once. The things {{recalled}} are generally clearly defined. Our table is a long one; I can in my mind pass my eyes all down the table and see the different things distinctly, <b>but</b> not <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> table at once.|$|R
60|$|March is windy, <b>but</b> on <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> a good month, {{except for}} Khamsin, which begins about March 20th.|$|R

5|$|Edward made {{alliances with}} the German king, the Counts of Flanders and Guelders, and the Burgundians, who would attack France from the north. The alliances proved volatile, however, and Edward was facing trouble {{at home at}} the time, both in Wales and Scotland. It was not until August 1297 that he {{was finally able to}} sail for Flanders, at which time his allies there had already {{suffered}} defeat. The support from Germany never materialised, and Edward was forced to seek peace. His marriage to Margaret in 1299 ended the war, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> affair had proven both costly and fruitless for the English.|$|E
5|$|At the game, {{bisexual}} drama teacher Andrew LeGustambos {{attempts to}} grab the attention of both Larry and Miracle, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> school stands in shock as Stuart arrives with two full and augmented breasts; the pills he had taken were actually librarian Helen Klench's female hormone replacements. Nonetheless, the school loses the game. Sue finally reveals she was not planning on actually firing any teacher on her watch. Helen arrives to inform them {{that they did not}} need to win the game after all; she had found a rare time capsule with treasures. Upon opening the time capsule, it is revealed that it is full of Willard's porn magazines that Ennis hid. Sue pitifully looks at Willard and tells him he is fired.|$|E
25|$|Charles XII {{attempted}} to invade Norway 1716; however, {{he was shot}} dead at Fredriksten fortress in 1718. The Swedes were not militarily defeated at Fredriksten, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> structure and organization of the Norwegian campaign fell apart with the king's death, and the army withdrew.|$|E
5000|$|Electromagnets: {{they need}} {{electrical}} power, like batteries, to work. <b>But</b> lifting <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> pod {{would require a}} lot of batteries.|$|R
50|$|Spion Kop was {{attacked}} and held between <b>the</b> 23-24 <b>but</b> ultimately <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> force retreated {{back across the}} Tugela River.|$|R
50|$|On {{the river}} {{there is a}} {{settlement}} of Demianka, <b>but</b> on <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>the</b> Demianka basin is weakly populated. There are no large settlements.|$|R
25|$|Kingsford Smith Airport (commonly Sydney Airport, and locally {{referred}} to as Mascot Airport or just 'Mascot'), located in the southern Sydney suburb of Mascot is the major airport for not just the state <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> nation. It is a hub for Australia's national airline Qantas.|$|E
25|$|Torquay Tramways {{operated}} electric street trams in Torquay, Devon, England, from 1907. They {{were initially}} {{powered by the}} unusual Dolter stud-contact electrification, but in 1911 was converted to more conventional overhead-line supply. The line was extended into neighbouring Paignton in 1911 <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> network was closed in 1934.|$|E
25|$|The summit has two cairns of {{very similar}} height, {{that to the}} north-west being nearer to the cliff edge and having the better view. Northwards along Borrowdale the vista is unsurpassed, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> {{panorama}} is excellent. The heads of the gullies can also be approached for startling views down the face.|$|E

25|$|Historically {{the various}} stages were {{performed}} manually <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> process is now automated for most wines. In {{connection with the}} filling of the missing volume, {{it is common to}} add a certain amount of sugar dissolved in wine to give the sparkling wine a smoother taste. Sugar addition is called dosage and the added liquid liqueur d'expedition.|$|E
25|$|The RCAF {{tested the}} 45-80 in October 1937, {{investigating}} its {{potential as a}} photographic platform, but ultimately rejecting it. Canadian Airways tests showed that the new design had a payload capacity no greater than the single-engine types that they were already operating. A second prototype was built, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> project was soon abandoned with the completed prototypes along with three unassembled production examples being scrapped.|$|E
25|$|I am {{very proud}} of the 19 wickets I took against the Rest of the World, even though, laughably, they have now been officially deducted from my Test playing record. They were earned the hard way against the best batsmen in the world, each trying to upstage the rest...It was tough, very tough, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> {{exercise}} provided ideal practice for the coming tour of Australia.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the most}} urgent and most {{difficult}} problems which affect not only SKM, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> Tricity transport system, {{is the lack of}} a common ticket for the whole agglomeration and different modes of transport. Riders must buy different types of tickets for trams and buses in Gdańsk, trolleybuses and buses in Gdynia, and for SKM trains. Attempts to correct this situation are in progress.|$|E
25|$|Shortly afterwards, Rostislav led a {{large portion}} of his troops off to Bohemia in order to assist his {{father-in-law}} against King Ottokar II of Bohemia. Thus his Vidin province became undermanned, and the situation was ideal for Tsar Constantine Tikh who attacked the token forces left behind in Vidin and regained not only the city <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> province to the borders of the province of Braničevo.|$|E
25|$|The region {{lies in the}} humid-subtropical zone, and {{experiences}} hot summers from March to June, the monsoon from July to October and mild winters from November to February. The interior states have a drier climate and slightly more extreme climate, especially during the winters and summers, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> region receives heavy, sustained rainfall during the monsoon months. Snowfall occurs in the extreme northern regions of West Bengal.|$|E
60|$|George was {{exceedingly}} quiet. He spoke a {{few words}} {{now and then to}} Mrs Raphael, <b>but</b> on <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> he was altogether silent, listening.|$|R

25|$|Brown and Bedser {{deserved}} {{at least}} two day's rest – <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> English side {{was in and out}} while the sun was still shining. One of the saddest sights I have seen on a cricket field was the weary Bedser trudging out to bat less than two hours after his marathon bowling effort...Bailey batted one handed and Wright did not bat. It was a sickening blow for the Englishmen, to lose by an innings after such heroic efforts by the bowlers, but Iverson was just too good.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes the {{original}} {{meaning of the}} adjective is retained, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> compound still means something more specific {{than the sum of}} the elements. For example, savanyú káposzta, lit. ’sour cabbage’, actually ’sauerkraut’, is more than a cabbage that tastes sour: it means a type of pickled food, yet it is written with a space. On the other hand, mobiltelefon ’mobile phone’ is written in one word, although it is actually a telephone that is mobile – writing in one word may be justified by the different technology, as distinguished from a cordless telephone, which is also portable.|$|E
25|$|In 1833, the English {{economist}} William Forster Lloyd {{published a}} pamphlet {{which included a}} hypothetical example of over-use of a common resource. This was the situation of cattle herders sharing a common parcel of land on which they are each entitled to let their cows graze, as was the custom in English villages. He postulated that if a herder put more than his allotted number of cattle on the common, overgrazing could result. For each additional animal, a herder could receive additional benefits, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> group shared damage to the commons. If all herders made this individually rational economic decision, the common could be depleted or even destroyed, {{to the detriment of}} all.|$|E
