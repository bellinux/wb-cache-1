40|$|The {{conservation}} {{efficiency of}} Protected Areas (PA) {{is influenced by}} the health and characteristics of the surrounding landscape matrix. Fragmentation of adjacent lands interrupts ecological flows within PAs and will decrease the ability of species to shift their distribution as climate changes. For five periods across the 21 (st) century, we assessed changes to the extent of primary land, secondary land, pasture and crop land projected to occur within 50 km <b>buffers</b> <b>surrounding</b> IUCN-designated PAs. Four scenarios of land-use were obtained from the Land-Use Harmonization Project, developed for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Fifth Assessment Report (AR 5). The scenarios project the continued decline of primary lands within <b>buffers</b> <b>surrounding</b> PAs. Substantial losses are projected to occur across buffer regions in the tropical forest biomes of Indo-Malayan and the Temperate Broadleaf forests of the Nearctic. A number of buffer regions are projected to have negligible primary land remaining by 2100, including those in the Afrotropic's Tropical/Subtropical Grassland/Savanna/Shrubland. From 2010 - 2050, secondary land is projected to increase within most buffer regions, although, as with pasture and crops within tropical and temperate forests, projections from the four land-use scenarios may diverge substantially in magnitude and direction of change. These scenarios demonstrate a range of alternate futures, and show that although effective mitigation strategies may reduce pressure on land surrounding PAs, these areas will contain an increasingly heterogeneous matrix of primary and human-modified landscapes. Successful management of buffer regions will be imperative to ensure effectiveness of PAs and to facilitate climate-induced shifts in species ranges...|$|R

In particular, four types of sampling (1 – the whole study area; 2 – transects running parallel to the general slope direction of the study area with a total surface of about 1 / 3 of the whole study area; 3 – <b>buffers</b> <b>surrounding</b> the phenomena with a 1 / 1 ratio between the stable and the unstable area; 4 – <b>buffers</b> <b>surrounding</b> the phenomena with a 1 / 2 ratio between the stable and the unstable area), two variable coding modes (1 – grouped variables; 2 – binary variables), and two types of elementary land (1 – cells units; 2 – slope units) units have been tested. The obtained results must be considered as statistically relevant in all cases (Aroc values > 70 %), thus confirming the soundness of the LR analysis which maintains high predictive capacities notwithstanding the features of input data. As for the area under investigation, the best performing methodological choices are the following: (i) transects produced the best results (0 P(y) ≤ 93. 4 %; Aroc = 79. 5 %); (ii) as for sampling modalities, binary variables (0 P(y) ≤ 98. 3 %; Aroc = 80. 7 %) provide better performance than ordinated variables; (iii) as for the choice of elementary land units, slope units (0 P(y) ≤ 100 %; Aroc = 84. 2 %) have obtained better results than cells matrix...|$|R

We used a hospital-based perinatal database including more than 80, 000 births to study the relationships between greenness exposure and three pregnancy outcomes: birth weight in term born infants, preterm deliveries and preeclampsia. Greenness was characterized using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) within circular <b>buffers</b> <b>surrounding</b> maternal homes.

40|$|Hedgerows are linear {{structures}} {{found in}} agricultural landscapes that may facilitate dispersal {{of plants and}} animals and also serve as habitat. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the relationships among diversity and ecological traits of woody plants, hedgerow characteristics (size, age, and origin), and the structure of the surrounding Atlantic Forest landscape. Field data were collected from 14 hedgerows, and landscape metrics from 1000 -m <b>buffers</b> <b>surrounding</b> hedgerows were recorded from a thematic map. In all sampled hedgerows, arboreal species were predominantly zoochoric and early-succession species, and hedgerow width was an important factor explaining the richness and abundance of this group of species. Connection with forest vegetation did not explain richness and abundance of animal-dispersed species, but richness of non-zoochoric species increased in more connected hedgerows. These results suggest that hedgerows are probably colonized by species arriving from nearby early-succession sites, forest fragment edges, and isolated trees in the matrix. Nonetheless, hedgerows provide resources for frugivorous animals and influence landscape connectivity, highlighting the importance of these elements in the conservation of biodiversity in fragmented and rural landscapes...|$|R

40|$|Underground test {{sites for}} {{disposal}} of {{high-level radioactive waste}} (HLW) are commonly equipped with instrumentation for documentation {{of the evolution of}} engineered barriers and of changes in the physical state of the host rock. The rate of hydration of the clay <b>buffer</b> <b>surrounding</b> waste canisters determines the physical interaction with the rock and waste canisters and is recorded by use of RH meters and by measuring the swelling pressure exerted on cells installed in the clay. They are connected to cables and tubings extending to the recording units placed in room atmosphere. If they pass from the rock through the buffer groundwater under pressure can migrate through or along bunches of cables and tubings and reach the points of measurement earlier than in clay without instrumentation. The inconvenience is avoided by tight embedment of individual cables and tubings and placement of the pressure gauges such that they do not pass through the clay. Incorrect rates of hydration has led to the inadequate conclusion that water flows in unsaturated parts of the buffer according Darcy’s law while it is in fact migrating by coupled diffusion processes.

40|$|Synthetic {{molecular}} motors typically take nanometer-scale steps through rectification {{of thermal}} motion. Here we propose Inchworm, a DNA-based motor that employs a pronounced power stroke to take micrometer-scale steps on a time scale of seconds, and we design, fabricate, {{and analyze the}} nanofluidic device needed to operate the motor. Inchworm is a kbp-long, double-stranded DNA confined inside a nanochannel in a stretched configuration. Motor stepping is achieved through externally controlled changes in salt concentration (changing the DNA's extension), coordinated with ligand-gated binding of the DNA's ends to the functionalized nanochannel surface. Brownian dynamics simulations predict that Inchworm's stall force is determined by its entropic spring constant and is ∼ 0. 1 pN. Operation of the motor requires periodic cycling of four different <b>buffers</b> <b>surrounding</b> the DNA inside a nanochannel, while keeping constant the hydrodynamic load force on the DNA.
