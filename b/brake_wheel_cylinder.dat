5000|$|The 1979 {{model year}} saw a new {{downsized}} Newport on the Chrysler R platform, a derivative of the circa 1962 Chrysler B platform. This reduced model availability {{to a single}} [...] "pillared hardtop" [...] 4-door sedan. While GM and Ford had downsized their big cars by engineering smaller bodies around more spacious passenger accommodations, Chrysler took a different approach. The existing Chrysler B platform was modified to improve fuel efficiency {{through a number of}} weight saving measures. Examples include plastic <b>brake</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>cylinder</b> pistons, which tended to swell and bind up the brakes after a some years in service. Chrome-plated aluminum bumpers were another innovation, but were replaced in 1980 with a stronger steel rear bumper. The large displacement V8 engines were dropped.|$|E
50|$|Drum brake {{components}} {{include the}} backing plate, <b>brake</b> drum, shoe, <b>wheel</b> <b>cylinder,</b> and various springs and pins.|$|R
50|$|The {{process is}} {{performed}} by forcing clean, bubble-free brake fluid {{through the entire}} system, usually from the master cylinder(s) to the calipers of disc <b>brakes</b> (or the <b>wheel</b> <b>cylinders</b> of drum <b>brakes),</b> but in certain cases in the opposite direction. A brake bleed screw is normally mounted at the highest point on each cylinder or caliper.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This study {{presents}} {{the development and}} validation of an analytical dynamic model of an air-over-hydraulic (AOH) brake system for a commercial vehicle (CV). The brake system model includes the controller, intensifier, <b>brake</b> lines, <b>wheel</b> <b>cylinder,</b> and foundational drum brake, which are presented for the interaction with the application system. A generalized AOH brake system, based on systems analysis level for the components, is formulated in detail. The pipeline hysteresis and fluid fluctuation of the brake system have been investigated in detail. Many experiments were performed on a bench setup of the AOH brake system and real vehicles. The experimental data is compared with the model simulation results. Preliminary {{results show that the}} simulation matches the experimental data closely. The models, which are developed from physical laws, are intended for use in the design and analysis of vehicle control systems for CVs...|$|R
50|$|One <b>wheel</b> <b>cylinder</b> {{operates}} the <b>brake</b> on each <b>wheel.</b> Two pistons operate the shoes, one {{at each end}} of the <b>wheel</b> <b>cylinder.</b> The leading shoe (closest to the front of the vehicle) is known as the primary shoe. The trailing shoe is known as the secondary shoe. Hydraulic pressure from the master cylinder acts on the piston cup, pushing the pistons toward the shoes, forcing them against the drum. When the driver releases the brakes, the brake shoe springs restore the shoes to their original (disengaged) position. The parts of the <b>wheel</b> <b>cylinder</b> are shown to the right.|$|R
500|$|Off-site, the new <b>brake</b> <b>wheel</b> and fantail were made. The {{original}} <b>brake</b> <b>wheel</b> was too rotten to repair, {{and showed}} {{evidence that it}} had been altered from the original one installed in 1819. The original <b>brake</b> <b>wheel</b> was [...] diameter to allow the Common sails to run at their optimum speed. When the mill was modernised in 1832 it was necessary to alter the gear ratios within the mill, as Patent sails run at a slower speed than Common sails. The great spur wheel was increased in diameter and the stone nuts reduced in diameter. The <b>brake</b> <b>wheel</b> was also rebuilt, with a cast iron segment ring fitted in place of the original cogs, resulting in a wheel [...] in diameter. The opinion of professional millwrights was sought, and it was decided that a scaled-up version of the original <b>brake</b> <b>wheel</b> would be made, but retaining the cast iron teeth segments. The remains of the original <b>brake</b> <b>wheel</b> were retained as an exhibit in the mill. The original iron segments were all broken, so a pattern was made and new segments were cast in heat-treated malleable cast iron. When the <b>brake</b> <b>wheel</b> was completed it was dismantled and transported to the mill ready for reassembly.|$|R

50|$|Some repairs {{were done}} {{to the body of}} the mill in the 1930s. The mill was {{restored}} in 1959 by R.F. Collinson, who had bought the mill house and discovered the mill in the garden. This entailed the complete replacement of the frame of the mill, including the crowntree. On 2 January 1976, the sails ran away in a gale and the <b>brake</b> <b>wheel</b> disintegrated.

50|$|The <b>wheel</b> <b>cylinder</b> {{consists}} of a cylinder that has two pistons, one on each side. Each piston has a rubber seal and a shaft that connects the piston with a brake shoe.

50|$|Chillenden {{windmill}} {{is a white}} open-trestle {{post mill}} with four spring sails carried on a cast-iron windshaft. The windshaft carries a cast-iron <b>brake</b> <b>wheel</b> with a wooden rim. The <b>brake</b> <b>wheel</b> has fifty wooden cogs, driving a cast-iron wallower on a cast-iron upright shaft. This carries a cast-iron great spur wheel which drives two pairs of underdrift millstones in {{the head of the}} mill. The mill formerly had a maize kibbler, but this was removed when the mill was restored in 1958. The mill is winded by a tailpole.|$|R
50|$|At the mill's top, or cap, {{is a huge}} cogged <b>wheel</b> {{called the}} <b>brake</b> <b>wheel,</b> which was turned by wind blowing against the sails. The sails are covered with canvas sailcloths to help catch the wind. The sails had to be entirely reconstructed by Rasmussen and John Johnson, because they were missing when Fabyan bought the mill.

40|$|In mixed-mode braking applications, the {{electric}} motor / generator (M/G) and hydraulic pressure valve are controlled {{to meet the}} driver 2 Ì† 7 s braking demand. Controlling these braking elements is achieved by modulating the current generated by the M/G and adjusting the fluid pressure to the <b>wheel</b> <b>brake</b> <b>cylinders.</b> This paper aims to model and design combined regenerative and hydraulic braking systems which, comprise an induction electric machine, inverter, NiMH battery, controller, a pressure source, pressure control unit, and brake calipers. A 15 kW 1500 rpm induction machine equipped with a reduction gear having a gear ratio of 4 is used. A hydraulic brake capable to produce fluid pressure up to 40 bar is used. Direct torque control and pressure control are chosen as the control criteria in the M/G and the hydraulic solenoid valve. The braking demands for the system are derived from the Federal Testing Procedure (FTP) drive cycle. Two simulation models have been developed in MatlabÂ®/SimulinkÂ® to analyze {{the performance of the}} control strategy in each braking system. The developed model is validated through experiment. It is concluded that the control system does introduce torque ripple and pressure oscillation in the braking system, but these effects do not affect vehicle braking performance due to the high frequency nature of pressure fluctuation and the damping effect of the vehicle inertia. Moreover, experiment results prove the effectiveness of the developed model...|$|R

40|$|Unified brake {{service is}} a {{universal}} service for generating certain brake force {{to meet the demand}} deceleration and is essential for an automated driving system. However, it is rather difficult to control the pressure in the <b>wheel</b> <b>cylinders</b> to reach the target deceleration of the automated vehicle, which is the key issue of the active deceleration control system (ADC). This paper proposes a hierarchical control method to actively control vehicle deceleration with active-brake actuators. In the upper hierarchical, the target pressure of <b>wheel</b> <b>cylinders</b> is obtained by dynamic equations of a pure electric vehicle. In the lower hierarchical, the solenoid valve instructions and the pump speed of hydraulic control unit (HCU) are determined to satisfy the desired pressure with the feedback of measured <b>wheel</b> <b>cylinder</b> pressure by pressure sensors. Results of road experiments of a pure electric and automated vehicle indicate that the proposed method realizes the target deceleration accurately and efficiently...|$|R
