5|$|Evan {{suspects}} {{that one of}} his neighbors is an alien due to his strange, stiff way of speaking and <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>always</b> seems to be watching Evan. As the watch scouts the neighbor's house, Bob learns that Chelsea is at an unsupervised party with Jason. Bob disobeys Evan's orders and rushes to the party with Franklin. Bob prevents Jason from raping Chelsea, but Jason beats him until Franklin intervenes. Evan and Jamarcus investigate the odd neighbor alone, discovering that he hosts orgies in his basement. When Bob returns, he and Evan argue over his putting his daughter above the watch. Bob is fired from the watch after saying Evan has no friends because he tries to control everything. Evan goes home and admits his infertility to Abby, who accepts the news and tells him they will work things out.|$|E
5|$|Federer {{plays with}} a single-handed backhand, which gives him great variety. He employs the slice, {{occasionally}} {{using it to}} lure his opponent to the net and deliver a passing shot. Federer can also fire topspin winners and possesses a 'flick' backhand with which he can generate pace with his wrist; this is usually used to pass the opponent at the net. His serve is difficult to read <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>always</b> uses a similar ball toss, regardless of what type of serve {{he is going to}} hit and where he aims to hit it, and turns his back to his opponents during his motion. He is often able to produce big serves on key points during a match. His first serve is typically around 200km/h (125mph); however, he is capable of serving at 220km/h (137mph). Federer is also accomplished at serve and volleying, and employed this tactic frequently in his early career.|$|E

50|$|He was nicknamed Bizz (or Biz) by his siblings. His sister Diana {{has claimed}} {{that it was}} <b>because</b> <b>he</b> was <b>always</b> so busy with working on something, but his brother Bret said in his {{autobiography}} that it was <b>because</b> <b>he</b> was <b>always</b> up to some mischievous business.|$|R

50|$|According to his Myspace page Mascarita Sagrada is both {{married and}} has children, but <b>because</b> <b>he's</b> <b>always</b> worked under a mask and never given {{his real name}} nothing else is known about {{that part of his}} life. Sagrada is also {{involved}} in charitable events, especially those focusing on children, such as visits to hospitals and orphanages.|$|R
25|$|I {{was told}} he was handing out a few theatre tickets and I didn't suspect {{anything}} <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>always</b> looked after the boys. He was close {{to a number of}} players, obviously a lot closer than I understood at the time. I didn't have any hint that it wasn't him just organising something for the boys to go to that night.|$|E
25|$|The botanist, N.A. Dalzell (1864) {{named the}} plant genus Frerea to commemorate H.B. Frere. A {{monotypic}} plant genus known {{by a single}} species viz. Frerea indica Dalzell. Dalzell stated 'Sir H. B. E. Frere, {{not only as a}} mark of esteem and respect, but also <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>always</b> has been the enlightened encourager and promoter of scientific researches in India, and is himself a close observer of nature.|$|E
25|$|Pang De later {{followed}} Ma Teng {{to suppress}} a rebellion by Zhang Baiqi (張白騎) at Yao County (殽縣; present-day Luoning County, Henan). He {{was famous for}} his bravery in Ma Teng's army <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>always</b> charged into the enemy formation during battles. When Ma Teng was recalled to the imperial capital, Xu (許; present-day Xuchang, Henan), to serve as Minister of the Guards (衛尉), Pang De remained behind in Liang Province with Ma Chao.|$|E

2500|$|Martin {{himself said}} of his {{partnership}} with Bryson in May 2014: [...] "I think people must hate playing against him, because I certainly would. I wouldn't want to mark him. People can't stay with him, he's got that much energy. From my point of view, he helps my game, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> takes people away and runs in behind. It {{makes it easier for}} me to play, <b>because</b> <b>he's</b> <b>always</b> there next to me." ...|$|R
25|$|As {{his career}} as a superhero begins, Brian fights as the {{champion}} of Great Britain, often clashing with S.T.R.I.K.E. and Welsh anti-superhero police officer Dai Thomas, and would develop a rogues gallery including the assassin Slaymaster and the crime matriarch Vixen. He tried to keep his studies going and court fellow student Courtney Ross while also working as a superhero, and (as with other Marvel heroes) was viewed as a coward by others <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>always</b> vanished whenever trouble started.|$|E
25|$|Umar was strong, fit, {{athletic}} and good at wrestling. He {{is said to}} have participated in the wrestling matches {{on the occasion of the}} annual fair of Ukaz. From first hand accounts of his physical appearance Umar is said to be vigorous, robust and a very tall man, in markets he would tower above the people. The front part of his head was bald, always A'sara Yusran (working with two hands), both his eyes were black, with yellow skin, however, ibn Sa'ad in his book stated that he never knew that 'Umar had yellow skin, except if the people took into criterion a certain part of his life where his color changed <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>always</b> ate oil at that part of his life. Others say he had reddish-white skin. His teeth were ashnabul asnan (very white shining). He would always color his beard and take care of his hair using a type of plant.|$|E
25|$|Hastings's {{appearances}} in Poirot's later novels {{are restricted to}} a few cases in which he participates on his periodic returns to England from Argentina. Poirot comments in The ABC Murders that he enjoys Hastings's visits <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>always</b> has his most interesting cases when Hastings is with him. In the course of The Big Four, Dulcie's life is threatened by members of an international conspiracy. Hastings is forced to risk Poirot's life in return for her promised safety. In other respects {{there is very little}} personal detail regarding Hastings in these novels, until , which takes place after World War II: With his wife now dead, Hastings rejoins Poirot at Styles to help tackle one last case. The novel culminates with Poirot dying of a heart attack, leaving Hastings a confession explaining his role in events as he tracked a criminal who manipulated others to commit murder for him. Poirot's friendship with Hastings is further referenced when the murderer's attempt to manipulate Hastings in such a manner leaves Poirot resolved to kill his adversary, despite his disapproval of murder, as he knew that his friend would normally never do such a thing.|$|E

500|$|Up-and-coming actor Benicio del Toro {{was chosen}} to play Sanchez's henchman, Dario for being [...] "laid back while menacing in a quirky sort of way", {{according}} to Glen. Wayne Newton got the role of Professor Joe Butcher after sending {{a letter to the}} producers expressing interest in a cameo <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>always</b> wanted to be in a Bond film. The President of Isthmus was played by Pedro Armendáriz, Jr., the son of Pedro Armendáriz, who played Ali Kerim Bey in From Russia with Love.|$|E
500|$|Common became {{interested}} in the role due to both the script and the prospect of working with McAvoy, Jolie, and Morgan Freeman. Common learned a great deal about firearms as preparation for the role, but said he is not a strong supporter of guns in real life. Konstantin Khabensky, who starred in Bekmambetov's Night Watch, was cast so that the director would have a familiar face around. British television veteran Marc Warren agreed to work in the film <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>always</b> wanted to be in a Hollywood blockbuster. Thomas Kretschmann originally intended to pick up the comic series after being cast, but Bekmambetov convinced him not to. He said that he [...] "did excessive gun training" [...] to [...] "make sure I look good and I look like I know what I'm doing". Kristen Hager originally auditioned for Fox, but accepted the role of Cathy, considering it [...] "fun to play".|$|E
500|$|Rivera had an {{impeccable}} {{ability to}} accurately locate pitches and consistently throw strikes, {{particularly on the}} inside and outside edges of the strike zone. This strength offset his reliance on one pitch and hitters' anticipation of it. His former catcher Joe Girardi said, [...] "He was so easy to catch <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>always</b> put the ball right there. I don't think there's ever been a pitcher that great who was so easy to catch." [...] Rivera's 4.10 career strikeout-to-walk ratio in the regular season ranks ninth-best in major league history. His control was a byproduct of his smooth, easily repeated pitching motion, which some opposing hitters found to be deceptive. One such player, Darrin Fletcher, said in 1999 that Rivera [...] "almost kind of lulls you to sleep with his delivery. It gives you a false sense of security, and then the ball is on you and it's exploding." ...|$|E
5000|$|... 5. Todd: Todd {{always gets}} in trouble <b>because</b> <b>he's</b> <b>always</b> picked on by Mrs. Jewls {{when he does}} a very small thing wrong. While working in his {{workbook}} he is harassed by Joy. Suddenly, burglars rob the school, so Todd decides to give them Joy's workbook. Despite all this, he's sent home early on the kindergarten bus, but not without a standing ovation by his class this time.|$|R

500|$|Butters soon does, in fact, write a {{novel of}} his very own, The Poop That Took a Pee, which {{consists}} solely of simple descriptions of scatological acts. The four boys are convinced the book will be a disaster and expose Butters as a fraud over the first book. However, much to their surprise, readers actually find it an even deeper, more profound book, and continue reading their own allegorical messages into the text. After finishing the book, one crazed reader storms onto the set of reality television series Keeping Up with the Kardashians and murders the entire Kardashian family with a pump-action shotgun. Both The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs and The Poop That Took a Pee are banned as a result, and Butters is devastated, mainly <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>always</b> saw Kim Kardashian as [...] "the {{most beautiful woman in}} the world". Stan and Kyle suggest that rather than reading books and mindlessly discovering false messages in them, people should simply watch television instead. Cartman also tricks Butters into thinking that he dressed Sarah Jessica Parker in a moose costume, and was therefore responsible for her being shot in the woods. Butters starts to panic at first, but calms down and shrugs because of how [...] "ugly" [...] she was anyway.|$|E
500|$|Robinson's {{parents were}} poor tenant farmers {{who worked in}} the tobacco fields as sharecroppers. The family used an outhouse, drew water from a cistern, and did laundry in a {{cast-iron}} tub over an open flame. Their house did not have running water until Robinson was ten years old. When Robinson was born, he was so seriously ill that the doctor was certain he would not survive. He was temporarily paralyzed from birth and his head was misshapen. So likely was Robinson's death that the physician asked Robinson's father Charles for a name for the baby's birth and death certificates. Robinson's parents were young (his mother Imogene was twenty) and they were hoping for a girl. They named the baby [...] "Vicky Gene Robinson" [...] for Charles' father Victor and the baby's mother Imogene. For a long time, Robinson's parents believed the boy would die soon. Much later in life, Robinson's father would tell him he couldn't take any joy in the boy's development <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>always</b> thought each step {{was going to be the}} last thing. Robinson's parents were and still are members of a small Disciples of Christ congregation. Robinson describes his childhood as very religious. Robinson had perfect Sunday School attendance for thirteen years.|$|E
500|$|In the {{creation}} of Todd Manning, no one played a larger role than the remarkably talented Josh Griffith, first associate head writer, then co-head writer, during my stay at One Life. Josh loved, lived and breathed Todd and fought passionately for {{his position on the}} show. Second, Todd never would have evolved from [...] "first frat boy" [...] to the major cast member he became without the powerful talent of Roger Howarth. Because of Roger's ability to convey the complexity of Todd (the hurt as well as anger, the insecurity as well as bluster, the brains, yearning, manipulativeness, sexiness, tenderness, nastiness) we were able to explore both the deeply dark side of this character (the effort to destroy Marty to cover the rape, the attempted revenge on his lawyer Nora, the attack on Luna) {{and at the same time}} slowly uncover his growing struggle (usually a failed struggle) towards some kind of redemption. Romantic leads have often begun their careers playing villains (Valentino, Clark Gable, Humphrey Bogart among them). These characters appeal because they make women feel both the thrill of the [...] "bad" [...] and the lure of the hidden [...] "good": they can lead the man to change through love. [...] "I'll save him!" [...] Fans loved Todd from the beginning <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>always</b> had that appeal.|$|E
5000|$|The satirical {{magazine}} Private Eye frequently {{referred to}} him as [...] "tiny but perfect", {{not because of any}} shortness in stature, but <b>because</b> <b>he</b> was <b>always</b> impeccably groomed.|$|R

6000|$|... "Indeed he will. You {{never knew}} {{anything}} like him for hardness {{if things go}} wrong awhile. I know he's got lots of money, <b>because</b> <b>he's</b> <b>always</b> buying up bits of houses; besides, what has he done with mine? but yet sometimes you'd hardly think he'd let me have bread enough for the children--and as for clothes--!" [...] Poor Miriam! It seemed that her husband shared with her but few of the spoils or triumphs of his profession.|$|R
2500|$|Despite {{suffering}} severely from {{varicose veins}} {{for much of}} his career, [...] "he was always looking at his captain and waiting to be given the ball <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>always</b> felt he could take a wicket". [...] "The day was never too hot, nor the score too high, for Herb McGirr to want to bowl." ...|$|E
2500|$|Catchers of the Peitz kind are scarce. [...] I {{know he is}} not a Beaumont on his feet, but he is a corking {{good man}} for a team <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>always</b> knows what to do and how to do it, and what better do you want? A catcher of the Peitz kind runs the whole game from behind the bat. I wish we had him, and if the Reds let him go it would be a serious mistake.|$|E
2500|$|Newt Gingrich {{attacked}} Mitt Romney on [...] "pious baloney". He {{said that}} the only reason that Mitt Romney has not been a long time politician was <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>always</b> lost. Another stir up came from Jon Huntsman saying that Mitt Romney's attitude is one that is dividing this nation. Huntsman said that after he had been criticized by Romney for being Obama's ambassador to China. Newt Gingrich and Mitt Romney also got into an argument about the Super PAC advertisements that each had been putting out.|$|E
5000|$|He met John Wesley in August 1776, {{becoming}} {{one of his closest}} assistants. Wesley called Coke [...] "the flea" [...] <b>because</b> <b>he</b> seemed <b>always</b> to be hopping around on his missions.|$|R
