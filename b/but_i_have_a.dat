I got serious songs and sad songs. Just a big variety of everything. I wanted to show the full me. I {{have a lot of}} people who love me, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> lot of haters as well. There are at least one or two songs for someone that doesn't really like me or what I put out. I think they'll stumble across a couple songs that will make them go, oh ok, I fucks with him now. I kinda wanted to make an album to show my wide range of music that I can do. I just wanted to show the full me.|$|E

If you give 110 per cent, you'll win a lot more games than you lose. I've been 12 months out of the game but if I see a ball I think I can hit, I will hit it... It's a big part of the {{captaincy}} so everyone knows where they stand. A happy team turns into a confident team and wins matches. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> hell of a lot to learn. It's my first shot at it and I will be listening to a lot of people. People who are willing to give advice and have a bit of a yarn.|$|E

500|$|In 2014 Smith {{offered her}} {{opinion on the}} sexualization of women in music. [...] "Pop music has always been about the {{mainstream}} and what appeals to the public. I don't feel it's my place to judge." [...] As at points earlier in her life and career, she declined to embrace politicized feminism: [...] "I have {{a son and a}} daughter, people always talk to me about feminism and women's rights, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> son tooâ€”I believe in human rights." ...|$|E

500|$|Of course, I haven't any {{voice to}} speak of, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> great register, and Sullivan used to amuse himself by making me sing bass in one number of an opera and tenor in another. [...] In 'Ruddygore', Sir Arthur had engaged {{a man to}} play the servant, my menial, so to speak, who had an {{enormous}} bass voice, and who had {{to go down to}} the lower E flat. [...] Singularly enough, he could go down to G, and then he dropped out entirely, and I did the [...] below. [...] Generally the audience roared with laughter, and it absolutely brought down the house.|$|E
500|$|Chris Carabott from IGN [...] "loved" [...] Tom's first {{appearance}} because [...] "It's a great scene and our first introduction to The Others besides Ethan's infiltration of the camp." [...] Gainey found the fan {{reaction to his}} {{first appearance}} [...] "really tough", because [...] "everywhere [...] went people would just give [...] dirty looks and they were like 'What {{are you going to}} do with that boy?'", but he noted this gradually improved after his appearances in season two. Erin Martell from AOL's TV Squad listed Tom in her five [...] "most entertaining guest roles" [...] from the first three seasons, commenting [...] "I am counting his first episode as my favorite. For my money, there was nothing more disturbing than when Gainey showed up out of the blue and uttered the words, 'We're gonna have to take the boy.' I could not get that scene out of my head for days after 'Exodus' aired. Ben has made Tom seem relatively less menacing over time, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> feeling that the terrifying, bearded sea captain is still in there somewhere." [...] In her review of the season four episode [...] "The Other Woman", Nikki Stafford of Wizard called the return of her [...] "favorite Other" [...] (Tom) a [...] "highlight". Following his posthumous flashback appearance in [...] "Meet Kevin Johnson", Martell said [...] "Now I feel even worse about his death. He wasn't just one of Ben's scary, Walt-napping minions. He had a heart." [...] Tim Goodman from the San Francisco Chronicle thought the revelation that Tom is gay was a [...] "unique and funny twist". Jay Glatfelter of The Huffington Post noted this revelation [...] "seemed a little oddly placed, kind of like 'Let's make one of our characters gay just for the heck of it' but still it's cool that the show has a perfectly normal (well for an 'Other') not over-the-top gay character." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Bundy family claimed {{victory on}} having its cattle returned. In an {{interview}} after the BLM's withdrawal, Sean Hannity asked Bundy {{if he had}} a reply to Senator Harry Reid's comment that the situation was not over.

2500|$|Not {{long after}} winning the championship, Pierce was asked, [...] "Is Kobe [...] really {{the best player in}} the world?" [...] Pierce responded by saying, [...] "I don't think Kobe is the best player. I'm the best player. There's a line that {{separates}} having confidence and being conceited. I don't cross that line <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> lot of confidence in myself." [...] The quote drew minor controversy.|$|E

And more than that, I have a child, a 15-month-old son {{and he is a}} child I would like to be close to, like any mother. I would like to bring up my son to be a good man. That is now my objective." ...|$|E
2500|$|On January 15, 2010, Santorum sent {{an email}} and letter to {{supporters}} {{of his political}} action committee, saying, [...] "I'm convinced that conservatives need a candidate who will not only stand up for our views, but who can articulate a conservative vision for our country's future". He continued, [...] "And right now, I just don't see anyone stepping up to the plate. I have no great burning desire to be president, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> burning desire {{to have a different}} president of the United States". He formed a presidential exploratory committee on April 13, 2011. Santorum has also referred to his grandfather's historical encounter with Italian fascism as an inspiration for his 2012 presidential campaign.|$|E

2500|$|On March 28, 2011, Love, Erlandson, Patty Schemel and Auf der Maur {{appeared}} at the New York screening of Schemel's documentary [...] at the Museum of Modern Art. The appearance {{was the first time}} in thirteen years that all four members appeared together in public. Schemel had expressed a desire to record with Love, Erlandson and Auf der Maur stating [...] "nothing has been discussed, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> feeling." [...] After the screening, the four took part in a Q session where Love stated: [...] "For me, as much as I love playing with Patty â€“ and I would play with her in five seconds again, and everyone onstage â€“ if it's not moving forward, I don't wanna do it. That's just my thing. There's rumblings; there's always bloody rumblings. But if it's not miserable and it's going forward and I'm happy with itâ€¦ that's all I have to say about that question." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mamma Mia! {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Rotten Tomatoes reported that 54% of critics gave the film positive reviews {{based upon a}} sample of 175 reviews, with an average rating of 5.5/10. The Times gave it four stars out of five, as did Channel 4 (Britain) which said it had [...] "all the swing and sparkle of sequined bell-bottoms." [...] BBC Radio 5 Live's film critic Mark Kermode admitted to enjoying the film, despite describing the experience as 'the closest {{you get to see}} A-List actors doing drunken karaoke'. The Guardian was more negative, giving it one star, stating that the film gave the reviewer a [...] "need to vomit", while Bob Chipman of Escape to the Movies said it was [...] "so base, so shallow and so hinged on meaningless spectacle, it's amazing it wasn't made for men". The Daily Telegraph stated that it was enjoyable but poorly put together ("Finding the film a total shambles was sort of a shame, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> sneaking suspicion I'll go to see it again anyway."), whereas Empire said it was [...] "cute, clean, camp fun, full of sunshine and toe tappers." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a 2010 {{interview}} with Vampiria magazine, Vikernes {{was asked about}} Odinism playing {{a major role in}} his life, to which he responded: [...] "I am not religious in any way, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> Pagan ideology and Pagan values. I believe in blood, soil and honour; family, homeland and hamingja; strength, traditions and courage. And I believe in a Europe waking up." [...] As of 2011, Vikernes embraces a [...] "modern scientific worldview resting on a foundation made up of the Pagan values and ideals: loyalty, wisdom, courage, love, discipline, honesty, intelligence, beauty, responsibility, health and strength". He draws a direct connection between both race and intelligence and intelligence and religion, denouncing theism as [...] "mental enslavement" [...] fit only for [...] "inferior races". Vikernes goes on to say [...] "If it is supposed to serve a purpose Paganism needs to be an ideology, not a religion". Though Vikernes states that mainstream theists hold onto [...] "Stone Age misconceptions", he argues that religious myths should be turned to in areas where science has not yet achieved a complete understanding of the natural world â€” such as the origin of life and where we go after death, if anywhere at all.|$|E
6000|$|... "This is an abominable slope," [...] he exclaimed. [...] "I've been on {{worse in}} Switzerland, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> ice-ax and wasn't half starved then. However, we'll have another try." ...|$|R

2500|$|The [...] "Essay" [...] was {{composed}} {{at a time}} when the prestige of Rymer and neo-Aristotelianism in England was already declining, and though Wesley expressed some admiration for Rapin and Le Bossu, he is by no means docile under their authority. Whatever the weight of authority, he says, [...] "I see no cause why Poetry should not be brought to the Test , as well as Divinity...." [...] As to the sacred example of Homer, who based his great epic on mythology, Wesley remarks, [...] "But this [...] being now antiquated, I cannot think we are oblig'd superstitiously to follow his Example, any more than to make Horses speak, as he does that of Achilles." [...] To the question of the formidable Boileau, [...] "What Pleasure can it be to hear the howlings of repining Lucifer?" [...] our critic responds flippantly,"I think 'tis easier to answer than to find out what shew of Reason he had for asking it, or why Lucifer mayn't howl as pleasantly as either Cerberus, or Knoeladus." [...] Without hesitation or apology he takes issue with Rapin's conception of Decorum in the epic. But Wesley is empiricist as well as rationalist, and the judgment of authority can be upset by appeal to the court of experience. To Balzac's suggestion that, to avoid difficult and local proper names in poetry, generalized terms be used, such as Ill-luck for the Fates and the Foul Fiend for Lucifer, our critic replies with jaunty irony, [...] "... and whether this wou'd not sound extremely Heroical, I leave any Man to judge", and thus he dismisses the matter. Similarly, when Rapin objects to Tasso's mingling of lyric softness in the majesty of the epic, Wesley points out sharply that no man of taste will part with the fine scenes of tender love in Tasso, Dryden, Ovid, Ariosto, and Spenser [...] "for the sake of a fancied Regularity." [...] He had set out to defend the Biblical epic, the Christian epic, and the propriety of Christian machines in epic, and no rules or authority could deter him. As good an example as any of his independence of mind can be seen In a note on Bk. I, apropos of the poet's use of obsolete words (Life of Our Blessed Lord, 1697, p.27): It may be in vicious imitation of Milton and Spenser, he says in effect, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> fondness for old words, they please my ear, and that is all the reason I can give for employing them.|$|E
2500|$|Publicist Marvet Britto stated, [...] "Jackson embodies grace, {{style and}} integrity...She {{has never been}} known as a bad person." [...] Britto {{describes}} Jacksonâ€™s videotaped apology as [...] "impersonal", saying, [...] "She has never been an impersonal artist, so it made it seem like she was guilty of something, and she wasn't. I would have had her and Timberlake apologizing side by side right from the beginning, since they performed side by side. Otherwise, it made the whole apology seem calculated and contrived." [...] Jackson said of the apology, [...] "I probably {{should have done it}} live. But there was so much going on at the time that I needed to just get it done. It is what it is. And it will pass, and I'm fine with it." [...] At one point Jackson was scheduled to be interviewed about the incident by Diane Sawyer on the ABC newsmagazine Primetime, however, the interview never came to fruition. Jackson later briefly discussed the incident on Good Morning America and the Late Show with David Letterman. Jackson's outfit was designed by famed designer Alexander McQueen, with Jackson later commenting [...] "I don't blame him; he didn't rip it. Alexander is so great at what he does â€“ he's a genius." [...] In an interview with Australia's Herald Sun, Jackson commented on Timberlake (whom, as mentioned, Jackson had previously known personally and aided when she selected his former group 'N Sync to open for her Velvet Rope World Tour at the start of their career) distancing himself from the incident and seemingly changing with fame. [...] "I really want to be honest about this, but I just feel that anything I say about him will be taken the wrong way", said Jackson. [...] "I do think that Justin is very talented and that he has a very big career ahead of him. But he seems to have changed recently. He's gotten a bit cocky. You know, some people can handle success and some people can't. I'm starting to wonder if (the latter) is the case with Justin. And it hurts me to say that." [...] Producer Jimmy Jam revealed Jackson considered writing a song about the incident for her Damita Jo album, saying, [...] "I don't know whether it will or not. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> feeling it probably will, because kind of whatever's happening in her life tends to be what she writes about [...] It'd be kind of interesting to see what her feeling is about it." ...|$|E
