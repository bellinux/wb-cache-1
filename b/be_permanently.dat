5|$|A {{hydrostatic}} test involves pressurising the cylinder to its test pressure (usually 5/3 or 3/2 {{of the working}} pressure) and measuring its volume {{before and after the}} test. A permanent increase in volume above the tolerated level means the cylinder fails the test and must <b>be</b> <b>permanently</b> removed from service.|$|E
5|$|A population's genetic {{variation}} can be greatly reduced by a bottleneck, and even beneficial adaptations may <b>be</b> <b>permanently</b> eliminated. The loss of variation leaves the surviving population vulnerable to any new selection pressures such as disease, climate change or {{shift in the}} available food source, because adapting in response to environmental changes requires sufficient {{genetic variation}} in the population for natural selection to take place.|$|E

5|$|After {{considering}} the Royal Commission's recommendations the Dutch Government decided to purchase four battleships. All the ships were to <b>be</b> <b>permanently</b> {{stationed in the}} NEI, and none would be used in European waters. The ships were larger than those proposed by the commission, however. Idenburg opposed this decision, and unsuccessfully argued {{for at least a}} fifth battleship to be built. In October 1913 it was rumored that the Government was about to order the first ship, {{and that it would be}} paid for by a loan borne by NEI.|$|E

5|$|In early 1973, the Architectural Review {{submitted}} {{a proposal to}} convert the Albert Bridge into a landscaped public park and pedestrian footpath across the river. The proposal proved very popular with the area's residents, and a May 1973 campaign led by John Betjeman, Sybil Thorndike and Laurie Lee raised a petition of 2,000signatures for the bridge to <b>be</b> <b>permanently</b> closed to traffic. Although the GLC reopened the bridge to traffic in July 1973, it also announced its intention {{to proceed with the}} Architectural Review scheme once legal matters had been dealt with.|$|E
5|$|US44 {{originally}} {{entered the}} village of Millbrook via NY82, North Avenue, and Franklin Avenue. On April1, 1980, the state of New York assumed ownership of a highway bypassing Millbrook {{to the west and}} north as part of a highway maintenance swap between the state and Dutchess County. The newly acquired roadway was designated as NY44A. On June5, 2007, NYSDOT announced that US44 would <b>be</b> <b>permanently</b> realigned onto NY44A. All shields along NY44A were replaced with US44 signage, and the NY44A designation ceased to exist. NYSDOT will continue to perform maintenance on US44's former routing through Millbrook. The portion of the routing that did not overlap NY82 is now NY984P, an unsigned reference route.|$|E
5|$|However, {{this plan}} only applied to men manning {{the walls of}} the fort, not the artillerymen who would be serving the fort's guns.

These crews would <b>be</b> <b>permanently</b> located at the fort, unlike the men assigned to {{the walls of the}} fort. To fire Fort Greble's planned complement of 15 guns, Barnard assigned 255 artillerymen. This plan was affected by the needs of the war. As the fighting dragged on and casualties mounted, the various commanders of the Army of the Potomac repeatedly raided the Washington garrison for trained artillerymen and infantry replacements. By 1864, Washington had been stripped to a total less than half that of Barnard's 1861 recommendation.|$|E

5|$|In 1981 the Australian Government {{decided to}} {{withdraw}} a RAAF fighter squadron from Malaysia to Darwin pending {{the completion of}} RAAF Base Tindal near Katherine in the Northern Territory. No.75 Squadron was the unit selected, and it arrived in Darwin in October 1983, becoming the first fighter squadron to <b>be</b> <b>permanently</b> based in the Northern Territory since World War II. The unit began to convert to F/A-18Hornets in May 1988 and moved to Tindal in October that year. No.75 Squadron also became part of No.81 Wing during 1988. Tindal {{was close to the}} RAAF's newly developed Delamere Air Weapons Range and the squadron was assigned two GAF Nomad light transport aircraft between January 1989 and 1993 to fly supplies to the facilities there.|$|E
5|$|Newman {{needed to}} find {{financial}} backing for his first season. Dr George Cathcart, a wealthy ear, nose and throat specialist, offered to sponsor it on two conditions: that Wood should conduct every concert, and that the pitch of the orchestral instruments should be lowered to the European standard diapason normal. Concert pitch in England was nearly a semitone higher than that used on the continent, and Cathcart regarded it as damaging for singers' voices. Wood, from {{his experience as a}} singing teacher, agreed. As members of Wood's brass and woodwind sections were unwilling to buy new low-pitched instruments, Cathcart imported a set from Belgium and lent them to the players. After a season, the players recognised that the low pitch would <b>be</b> <b>permanently</b> adopted, and they bought the instruments from him.|$|E
