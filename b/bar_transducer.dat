40|$|The ultra-cryogenic {{gravitational}} wave detector NAUTILUS is gathering data in Frascati (Rome), {{in its second}} science run since June 1998. The measured strain sensitivity at the two resonances is 4 × 10 − 22 Hz− 1 / 2 over a bandwidth of 1 Hz and better than 3 × 10 − 20 Hz− 1 / 2 over a band of about 25 Hz, with a duty cycle of about 80 %, mainly limited by cryogenic operations. At the beginning of 2002, the detector will be upgraded with a new Al <b>bar,</b> <b>transducer</b> and SQUID, and will be tuned to the 935 Hz frequency of the recently discovered pulsar in SN 1987 A. The future sensitivity of the detector is presented and discussed...|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to examine the effect of sonication cycle time on the in- situ ultrasonic cleaning of crossflow sintered tube microfiltration. The research involved attachment of vibra- <b>bar</b> <b>transducer</b> onto the membrane housing as a source of ultrasonic wave fields. Two sets of samples were used: yeast which represents the organic solids suspension, and titanium dioxide which represents the inorganic particles suspension. The research showed that the flux of the in-situ ultrasonic cleaning was increased by 58 % for yeast suspension at sonication cycle time of 15 minutes, and an increment of 123 % for titanium dioxide suspension at sonication cycle time of 10 minutes. The study concluded that application of in-situ ultrasound field in crossflow microfiltration processes managed to increase the filtration rate significantly, irrespective whether the particles are organic or inorganic in nature. The degree of flux improvement was dependent on the characteristics of the particulate suspension and the sonication cycle time. The main mechanism responsible in enhancing the filtration rate was the cavitational activities, caused by the ultrasonic irradiation, occurring near the filtering surface which reduces the overall resistance of permeate flow across the filter medium...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. In the testing of highly absorbent materials, {{it is necessary to}} use high transmitted power to obtain echoes with an acceptable signal-to-noise ratio from deep defects. However, the maximum peak power which can be used is limited by the construction problems of the probes and the physical properties of the crystal materials. Using longer pulses to transmit more energy could improve the detection, but would reduce the resolution of the system. Pulse compression techniques which overcome the conflict between resolution and pulse duration, provide a possible solution to the above problem. The method involves the transmission of a long coded pulse and the processing of the received echo to obtain a relatively narrow pulse, thus preserving resolution. After a study of the principles of pulse compression, various practical schemes were investigated, and the linear frequency-modulated pulse compression systems were found to be most economical to implement. Upon being received, the pulse may be compressed by means of a dispersive ultrasonic delay line, and simple Gaussian shape filter may be employed to reduce the resulting sidelobes. Theoretical studies on the dispersive modes of propagation of elastic waves in narrow metallic strips were then made, and demonstrated the feasibility of using a metallic strip as the dispersive delay device, provided that equalisers are introduced to compensate for the inherent time delay non-linearities in the strip. Design problems associated with the piezoelectric <b>bar</b> <b>transducers</b> for use with the line were also investigated. Based on the above studies, a pulse compression testing system consisting of a transmitting unit, a pair of wide-band transmitting and receiving transducers and a receiving unit, has been constructed. The transmitting unit comprises a linear frequency-modulated oscillator and timing circuits; the receiving unit incorporates equalisers, a weighting filter and an aluminium strip delay line. The operating system achieves a time bandwidth product of 80 and a sidelobe level of - 25 dB. Practical tests were carried out and test results are reported. Finally, the power and limitations of the testing system are discussed...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} rye {{show that the}} {{available}} technology is sufficient to measure the Standard Quantum Limit (SQL) of a low loss acoustic oscillator with a readout based on a microwave parametric transducer. The experiment makes use of the low electrical and acoustical losses in monocrystalline sapphire and new low-noise microwave technology. The crystal acts as an electrical vibration sensor and an acoustic oscillator in one monolithic structure. We analyze two new types of such structures: (1) The sapphire <b>bar</b> dielectric <b>transducer</b> and (2) the slotted sapphire dielectric transducer. We show that with a 40 - 60 dB double-cavity phase-noise suppression system the SQL may be measured using the sapphire bar. For the slotted structure, the phase noise requirements are less stringent because of its smaller resonant frequency and mass. We show that the SQL of this structure may be measured with a standard parametric readout. The principle of operation is demonstrated by some simple room-temperature experiments with all results verified using finite-element analysis. Given that we call expect to measure the SQL {{with one of these}} schemes, we analyze the properties of a microwave displacement measurement system based upon a high-Q parametric transducer and a double-frequency oscillator. Such a readout system represents a practical implementation of a black action evasion (BAE) displacement sensor allowing the discrimination between the quadratures of the mechanical oscillator. We determine the set of conditions which allows the enhanced sensitivity with respect to the desired quadrature and suppressed sensitivity to the unwanted quadrature. We find that tuning of the BAE system at the particular quadrature of interest can be performed by varying the phase relationship between the microwave carriers available from the double-frequency oscillator. We establish the importance of having the frequency and the phase-control servos to maintain the optimal tuning of the micro-wave BAE readout system, as both the mechanical oscillator and the double-frequency pump oscillator are always subject to various sources of environmental interference...|$|R
40|$|In the {{performance}} assessment of typical existing buildings, seismic collapse safety might be significantly affected by non-linear behavior of joints {{that are involved}} in the failure mechanism, especially if they are characterized by poor structural detailing such as the lack of an adequate transverse reinforcement in the joint panel. Unfortunately, commonly accepted tools to assess existing joints capacity are not available. Few reliable approaches for modeling all sources of nonlinearity are proposed in literature for poorly designed beam–column joints because of relatively poor information from experimental tests. The present study aims at improving the understanding of seismic performance of exterior joints without transverse reinforcement in existing buildings through experimental tests. Two full-scale exterior unreinforced beam–column joint sub-assemblages are tested under cyclic loading. The specimens are reinforced with deformed bars but they are different for beam longitudinal reinforcement ratio. Two different kinds of joint failure are expected, with or without the yielding of the adjacent beam. Strain gauges located on beam <b>bars</b> and displacement <b>transducers</b> on the joint panel allow the complete definition of both the main deformability contributions, namely fixed-end-rotation and shear strain of joint panel, highlighting the differences between failure modes. Design criteria, adopted setup and experimental results are described and discussed. Finally, experimental results are compared with proposals from literature in terms of shear strength...|$|R
40|$|A new {{passive sensor}} for remote {{measurement}} of water content in sandy soil was designed, using a {{surface acoustic wave}} (SAW) reflective delay line. Information from this sensor {{can be obtained by}} an interrogation device via a radio link operating in the European 434 -MHz industrial-scientific-medical band. The SAW device, manufactured on the YZ cut of LiNbO 3, is mounted and sealed in a standard dual inline 16 package and contains four electroacoustic transducers. One transducer is connected to an external antenna to pick up an RF request signal from the interrogation device and to send back an RF response. The second transducer operates as a reflector. The bus <b>bars</b> of this <b>transducer</b> are connected with two measuring rods through an electrical transmission line. These rods can be inserted into sandy soil. The final two transducers operate as reflectors and are included for reference purposes. The transmission line and the two rods spanning the sand-water mixture have a ch aracteristic impedance Zload, which loads the second transducer. Changes in the soil water content are observed as a change of the total permittivity due to the high permittivity of free water, which, in turn, affects Zload as well. The amplitude and phase of the acoustic reflection at the second transducer changes due to a variation of the terminating Zload. This then results in a difference in attenuation and phase of the corresponding peak in the time domain. Thus, the RF response of the sensor carries information about the water content between the rods, which, therefore, can be detected by and evaluated in the interrogation unit...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} campaign {{investigating the}} postulated Steam Generator Tube Rupture (SGTR) event, in relevant configurations for Heavy Liquid Metal Reactors (HLMRs), {{was carried out}} in the separate-effect facility LIFU 5 /Mod 2, at ENEA CR Brasimone. Ten tests were performed injecting pressurized subcooled water into the reaction tank partially filled by Lead-Bismuth Eutectic alloy (LBE) at 400 ° C with a cover gas of argon at about 2 <b>bar.</b> Fast pressure <b>transducers,</b> thermocouples and strain gages provided high-quality measurement data for improving the phenomena understanding and supporting the development and validation phase of computer codes for SGTR numerical simulation. The experimental campaign is composed by two series of tests, characterized by different water pressure: 40 and 16 bar. The first two tests belonging to the low pressure experiments are presented, highlighting the pressurization time trends of the water injection tank, injection line and reaction vessel. The injected water mass flow rate and temperature trends in the reaction vessel were measured. The former test is the reference one and the latter was carried out for investigating the injection of water with higher sub-cooling. A post-test analysis of the two mentioned tests was carried out by SIMMER-III code. The pressure profile in the water injection tank was set as boundary condition of the calculation. The numerical analysis provided injection line and reaction tank pressurization in agreement with the experimental data. The lower water temperature test provided a better accordance with the measured data, due to the lower evaporation along the injection line. The SIMMER-III analysis also studied the water-LBE interaction from the volume fraction point of view and the energy released in the total reaction tank and in its cover gas...|$|R
40|$|Reinforced {{concrete}} buildings designed {{according to}} obsolete seismic codes or for gravity loads only are widespread in Italian and Mediterranean building stock. Past earthquakes showed that, for these buildings, shear failure in beam–column joints {{can lead to}} structural collapse mainly due to the inadequate joint confinement. The construction details used in these structural elements are commonly recognized as the likely cause of non-ductile structural failure modes under seismic actions, {{due to the lack}} of capacity design principles. A significant amount of research on seismic performance of unreinforced beam–column joints has been carried out in last years, but a very few portion of them handled with specimens unreinforced in the joint region and with plain hook-ended longitudinal bars. A higher number of tests is needed to deeper understand joint seismic response in order to validate the (few) existing models or calibrate new ones. This study aims at improving the understanding of seismic performance of exterior non-conforming joints in existing buildings. Two experimental tests on joints without transverse reinforcement are designed and carried out. The specimens are different for beam longitudinal reinforcement ratio and they are both reinforced with plain longitudinal bars. Two different kinds of joint failure are expected, with or without yielding of the adjacent beam. Design criteria, adopted setup and main experimental results are described. Strain gauges located on beam <b>bars</b> and displacement <b>transducers</b> on the joint panel allow the complete definition of both the deformability contributions of fixed-end-rotation and shear strain of joint panel.

The analysis of local responses highlighted that the sum of the main deformability contributions due to joints (joint panel shear strain and rotation at beam/joint interface) represents the major part of the imposed drift for all tests. In particular, in tests for which the beam reaches the yielding moment, the contribution of the deformation mechanism associated to the rotation at beam - joint interface is predominant, particularly in the case of plain longitudinal reinforcement...|$|R
