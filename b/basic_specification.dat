40|$|In {{this chapter}} {{we use a}} three-level {{approach}} for analyzing module concepts for graph transformation systems. Based on the observation that module architectures consist of <b>basic</b> <b>specifications</b> like body or export interface and relations like the implementation relation between them, or the import relation between a client and a server module, module concepts are characterized by answering the questions 1. What are the <b>basic</b> <b>specifications?</b> 2. Which relations between specifications are used? 3. How are specifications and relations combined to module architectures? These three questions are investigated for five module concepts available in the literature. As a reference example, a sample modular specification of resource management in distributed operating systems is presented...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a systematic approach for classifying and comparing modularity concepts {{that have been}} proposed for graph transformation systems. The approach {{is based on the}} following observation: Modules and module interconnections consist of <b>basic</b> <b>specifications</b> (forming, e. g., a module's body, import, or export interface), and relations between such specifications, like the implementation relation between export and body of a module. Hence, a natural approach for characterizing a module concept is to answer the following three questions: 1. What are the <b>basic</b> <b>specifications?</b> 2. Which relations between specifications are used? 3. How are specifications and relations combined to modules and interconnections? In this paper, these questions are considered in some detail for the following module concepts for graph transformation systems...|$|R
50|$|The MkI Rialto {{series was}} {{available}} in three separate body styles: saloon, estate and van. The range consisted of <b>basic</b> <b>specification</b> with a vinyl interior and could be ordered {{with a list of}} choice optional extras, or GLS specification which came with a clock, FM/AM radio, voltage gauge, cloth covered seats with extra matching cloth covered areas on the interior, extra thick carpets with a carpeted boot area, GLS decals, leather steering wheel, spare wheel and radial tyres. All cars had a dark green dash with dark grey door cards.|$|E
50|$|To meet {{increasing}} {{demands for}} crew protection on deployed operations the HX range was designed {{from the outset}} with protection options in mind. In standard configuration a blast-proof vertical split-windscreen is fitted, and a riot protection kit is available for the cab. For more significant threats an appliqué protection kit, for which vehicles are prepared to accept at the production stage, have been developed in conjunction with Ressenig of Austria and Rheinmetall of Germany. Known as the Modular Armour Cabin (MAC), in <b>basic</b> <b>specification</b> these kits weigh around 1500 kg. The cab hard-top remains removable for air-transport if required.|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} version, {{later called}} the A-spec, could reach {{a speed of}} 120 mph, but the chassis, a “14-gauge ladder frame with cruciform bracing” based on the Triumph TR3, flexed so much that doors occasionally came open, marring its reputation. Bumpers were originally an optional extra. With the <b>basic</b> <b>specification</b> not including full bumpers, the A-spec. cars have two short, chromium-plated 'whiskers' on the body {{on either side of}} the front grille and two short, vertical bumpers, or [...] "overriders" [...] at the rear, which were not included if the rear bumper was optioned. Early A-spec. cars had recesses behind the door handles, but these were phased out.|$|E
50|$|The first form {{of control}} is {{control over the}} four tires’ {{vertical}} loading, by means of which each tire is kept in firm contact with the road surface for consistently maximum grip.

50|$|A later {{version with}} the same <b>basic</b> <b>specifications,</b> but {{equipped}} with wider-track landing gear {{was known as the}} Do 27Q-5. The aircraft was offered as a twin-float seaplane, the Do 27S-1, and with a larger engine (254 kW/340 hp Lycoming GSO-480-B1B6) and a three-blade propeller, as the Do 27H-2.|$|R

50|$|The Mayflower {{had been}} an {{attempt to create a}} small car with an {{upmarket}} image, but it failed to meet its sales targets. Standard announced the Mayflower's replacement in a press release in early February 1952; the announcement further stated that the replacement would probably not be on sale until 1953. The Standard Eight, which replaced the Mayflower, had a <b>basic</b> <b>specification</b> and was aimed at a different type of buyer. From the ending of Mayflower production in 1953 there was no small saloon with the Triumph name available in the United Kingdom until the launch of the Triumph Herald in 1959. The Standard Ten saloon and Standard Companion estate were sold as Triumphs in the United States.|$|E
5000|$|Consumer {{demand for}} more comfort, longer range and better {{instrumentation}} resulted in development of the Aeronca 50 Chief in 1938. Although {{little more than an}} incremental development of the K series the Model 50 heralded a new designation system used for the high-winged tourers, including the manufacturer and power rating of the engine, dropping the letter designation system. Thus the Aeronca 65CA Super Chief was powered by a [...] Continental A-65 with side-by-side seating and improvements over the 65C Super Chief. Other developments included tandem seating for use as trainer, liaison, observation aircraft or glider trainers as well as float-plane versions. Throughout the production life of the Aeronca Chief family the aircraft was improved incrementally, from a rather <b>basic</b> <b>specification</b> to a reasonably comfortable tourer with car-style interior.|$|E
50|$|A {{version of}} BBC BASIC {{integrated}} with the Microsoft Windows graphical user interface, BBC BASIC for Windows created by Richard Russell (who also developed the Z80 and x86 versions), was released in 2001. This version is still under active development, seeing much industry use currently.Whilst supporting nearly completely the original BBC <b>BASIC</b> <b>specification</b> (BASIC IV), the Windows version supports much of BASIC V/VI syntax {{as well as some}} advanced features of its own. Features unique to BBC BASIC for Windows include interpreter support for record/structure types, and the ability to call Windows API routines or those in an external DLL. Recent versions have included advanced features comparable with languages like C, and an external libraryhas recently added support for objects. As of 2017 an experimental port to SDL is available on Windows, Linux and a number of mobile devices supporting the SDL library,.|$|E
