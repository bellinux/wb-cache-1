5000|$|In the {{original}} Metal Storm patents, the propellant immediately behind the projectile {{closest to the}} muzzle of the gun barrel was ignited by an electronically fired primer, the projectile was set in motion, {{and at the same}} time a reactive force acted on the remaining stacked projectiles in the barrel, pushing them backwards. By design, the remaining projectiles would distort under this load, expanding radially against the gun <b>barrel</b> <b>wall.</b> This created a seal (obturation), which prevented the hot propellant gases (expanding behind the lead projectile) from leaking past them and prematurely igniting the remaining propellant charges in the barrel. As each of these propellant charges was selectively (electronically) ignited, the force [...] "unlocked" [...] the projectile in front and propelled it down the gun barrel, and reinforced the radial expansion (and hence the seal) between the projectiles remaining in the barrel and the <b>barrel</b> <b>wall.</b>|$|E

40|$|Maize, {{being an}} {{important}} agricultural crop {{and among the}} three most widely grown in the world, {{plays an important role}} in the livelihood of smallholder farmers contributing 34 - 36 % daily calorific intake in East Africa and 10 % in West Africa. In developing countries, population growth is expected to occur with increasing food demand. Conversely, maize experiences post-harvest losses (PHLS) especially from the maize weevil (Sitophilus zeamais), which if minimized, could help to reduce the number of hungry people in the world that is about 870 million people and majority (850 million people) being in developing countries. For the economies of smallholder farmers, better storage leads to fewer losses, more income, more grain available to seed, greater family stability, lower risks of family/country conflicts, improvement in political stability and quality of life. The different approaches which were studied to control the maize weevils included: evaluation of hermetic maize storage for smallholder farmers, effect of blending maize kernels with amaranth during storage on maize weevil mortality, and effect of storage containers physical disturbance on maize weevil mortality. The first study found 100 % maize weevil mortality for hermetically sealed containers and the oxygen levels inside them declined from 21 % to between 3 and 10 %. From the maize, maize-amaranth experiment, it was concluded that blending maize with amaranth during storage reduced maize weevil population growth by 46 % compared to storing maize alone. From the last experiment, we found out that physical disturbance resulted in 81 % weevil mortality. The overall conclusion is that there are effective low-cost ways to control maize weevils by hermetic storage, physical disturbance and blending maize with amaranth during storage. Hermetic storage is the best among the researched methods to effectively control the maize weevils, followed by physical disturbance and then maize-amaranth mixture. Possible future research can be to: * Investigate the possible causes and how to eliminate and/or minimize maize spoilage on <b>barrel</b> <b>walls.</b> This experiment will seek to minimize and/or eliminate molds that were observed and the aflatoxin detected from samples picked from <b>barrel</b> <b>walls.</b> * Hermetic storage should be investigated without letting the weevils to first go first through lifecycles to increase in population. This experiment will investigate if kernel spoilage occurs on <b>barrel</b> <b>walls</b> if hermetic sealing in done from the first day of storage. * Investigate how long it takes for a female maize weevil to bore through a kernel. This test will establish how frequently it is necessary to disturb the weevils. * Setting up the same maize-amaranth experiment (50 : 50 by volume) but having an extra layer of amaranth on top to investigate if this can help completely control the maize weevil. This extra layer will reduce and/or eliminate the maize kernels that were available during our experiment. * Due to observation of no spoilt kernels for maize blended with grain amaranth on <b>barrel</b> <b>walls,</b> more research should be done to quantify the observations. This experiment may lead to hermetic and maize-amaranth mixture methods being used together by smallholder farmers to eliminate and/or mimimize weevils while experiencing no mold maize in metallic storage containers. * Investigate the effect of physical disturbance using larger storage containers. Since farmers use larger storage containers compared to what we investigated in laboratory setting, it is necessary to find out what will happen in real life. * Implement and test the researched methods in a developing country. These tests will help determine if the proposed methods are feasible...|$|R

As with the 37 mm autocannons already installed in some Soviet and lend-lease single-engine fighters, the intended method of installation of the 45 mm gun was to have its barrel pass through the engine block and the empty propeller shaft, in this case that of the Yak-9. Consequently, the main difficulty in designing the 45 mm autocannon was the limitation imposed by the engine blocks available for this aircraft. Accounting for the diameter of the 45 mm shell, the Yak-9 engine blocks only allowed a wall thickness of 4 mm for the new gun's barrel, which was almost half the thickness of the <b>barrel</b> <b>wall</b> of the NS-37.

50|$|In {{a normal}} ramjet, air is {{compressed}} between a spike-shaped centerbody and an outer cowling, fuel is added and burned, and high speed exhaust gases are expanded supersonically {{out of the}} nozzle to generate thrust. In a ram accelerator, a projectile having a shape similar to the ramjet centerbody is fired, (often from a conventional gun), into the accelerator barrel, causing compression between the projectile and the <b>barrel's</b> <b>walls.</b> The <b>barrel</b> contains a pre-mixed gaseous fuel-air mixture. As the ram accelerator projectile compresses the fuel-air mixture, it is ignited and the combustion is stabilized {{at the base of}} the projectile. The resulting pressure differential generates a prodigious amount of thrust that can accelerate projectiles to in-tube Mach numbers greater than 8. Thus, if propellant mixtures with a speed of sound of 1000 m/s (e.g. fuel-rich H2-O2 mixtures) are used, muzzle velocities in excess of 8000 m/s are possible.|$|R

5000|$|Shotgun bores are {{commonly}} [...] "overbored" [...] or [...] "backbored", meaning {{that most of}} the bore (from the forcing cone to the choke) is slightly larger than the value given by the formula. This is claimed to reduce felt recoil and improve patterning. The recoil reduction is due to the larger bore producing a slower acceleration of the shot, and the patterning improvements are due to the larger muzzle diameter for the same choke constriction, which results in less shot deformation. A 12-gauge shotgun, nominally 18.5 mm, can range from a tight 18.3 mm to an extreme overbore of 20.3 mm. Some also claim an increased velocity with the overbored barrels, up to 15 m/s, which is due to the larger swept volume of the overbored barrel. Once only found in expensive custom shotguns, overbored barrels are now becoming common in mass marketed guns. Aftermarket backboring is also commonly done to reduce the weight of the barrel, and move the center of mass backwards for a better balance. Factory overbored barrels generally are made with a larger outside diameter, and will not have this reduction in weight—though the factory barrels will be tougher, since they have a normal <b>barrel</b> <b>wall</b> thickness.|$|E

5000|$|The {{easiest way}} to visualise Boucher's concept for the ribbed skew arch is to {{consider}} a regular arch bridge that carries the railway at right angles across the road and then to slice it vertically at regular intervals along the axis of its barrel, the planes all being parallel with {{the faces of the}} bridge, rather like the way a loaf of bread is sliced. The individual slices are then slid laterally with respect to one another in order to achieve the required oblique alignment. While the intrados of a [...] "true" [...] skew arch is smooth and cylindrical, the intrados of this type of [...] "false" [...] skew arch has a stepped appearance.

For a [...] "true" [...] skew arch the ratio of the span on the square to the span on the skew is equal to the cosine of the skew angle, but for a ribbed skew arch this ratio is made even less favourable due to the steps in the <b>barrel</b> <b>wall.</b>|$|E
