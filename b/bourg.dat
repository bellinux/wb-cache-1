5|$|It took Henry IV {{several years}} to retake Paris. By the time he succeeded in 1594, {{the area around the}} Bastille formed the main stronghold for the Catholic League and their foreign allies, {{including}} Spanish and Flemish troops. The Bastille itself was controlled by a League captain called du <b>Bourg.</b> Henry entered Paris early on the morning of 23 March, through the Porte-Neuve rather than the Saint-Antoine and seized the capital, including the Arsenal complex that neighboured the Bastille. The Bastille was now an isolated League stronghold, with the remaining members of the League and their allies clustering around it for safety. After several days of tension, an agreement was finally reached for this rump element to leave safely, and on 27 March du <b>Bourg</b> surrendered the Bastille and left the city himself.|$|E
