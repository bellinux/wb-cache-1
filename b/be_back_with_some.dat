The findings of the study reflect that the teachers’ knowledge of error analysis was characterised by the following assertions, which <b>are</b> <b>backed</b> up <b>with</b> <b>some</b> evidence: (1) teachers identified the errors correctly, (2) the generalised error identification resulted in opaque analysis, (3) some of the identified errors were not interpreted from multiple perspectives, (4) teachers’ evaluation of errors was either local or global and (5) in remedying errors accuracy and efficiency were emphasised more than conceptual understanding. The implications of the findings of the study for teaching include engaging in error analysis continuously as this is one way of improving knowledge for teaching...|$|R
50|$|When Charles married Catherine of Braganza in 1661, he {{acquired}} English Tangier {{as part of}} her dowry and Peterborough was sent there as its Governor, arriving 29 January 1662 in command of a regiment of foot which he raised in England (and which would become known as the Tangier Regiment), Harley's (ex-Parliamentary) regiment from Flanders, and remnants of Royalist regiments, also from Flanders. The force was ill-equipped, lacking basic supplies of fuel, beds, cooking-pots and ordnance equipment. In April 1662, he concluded a treaty with the Moors under Ahmad al-Khadir ibn Ali Ghaïlan but, in a disastrous sally out (3 May 1662), his force was soundly defeated. Confining the rest of the troops within the city walls, he himself returned to England unexpectedly, arriving in Plymouth on 8 June 1662. He <b>was</b> sent <b>back,</b> <b>with</b> <b>some</b> reinforcements, but <b>was</b> recalled in December of that year and replaced by Andrew Rutherford.

5|$|Parliament {{defeated}} the wider insurgency at the Battle of Maidstone {{at the start}} of June, and then sent a force under the command of Colonel Nathaniel Rich to deal with Deal and the other castles along the Downs. Walmer Castle was the first to be besieged, and surrendered on 12 July. Deal, which had been resupplied by the Royalists from the sea, was besieged in July. A Royalist fleet bombarded the Parliamentary positions and temporarily landed a force 1,500 Flemish mercenaries in support of the revolt, but a shortage of money forced their return to the Continent. The garrison then carried out a surprise attack on their besiegers but <b>were</b> fought <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>some</b> losses. The fleet, under the command of Prince Charles, attempted to land a fresh force in August, but despite three attempts the operation failed and suffered heavy losses. After news arrived of the Royalist defeat at Preston, Deal surrendered on 20 August, and artillery assaults then began on Sandown, leading to the surrender of the remaining fortification.|$|R
5000|$|However, soon Aed, Lek and Ot <b>were</b> <b>back</b> playing {{together}} <b>with</b> <b>some</b> new <b>backing</b> musicians, including Luechai Ngamsom (Duk) on keyboards, vocals and trumpet and Chuchat Nuduang (Ko) on drums. Originally, this band was not called [...] "Carabao," [...] but rather just 'Aed, Lek, Ot,' going by the remaining classic lineup members' nicknames. However, Aed was soon persuaded {{to revive the}} Carabao name, and the band continued with the new lineup. With Keo (Khiao) gone, Aed was now technically the band's only original member, although Lek and Ot had also been playing with the band almost from the start.|$|R
50|$|The attack {{began in}} the center, where the Uruguayans <b>were</b> forced <b>back</b> along <b>with</b> <b>some</b> Brazilian Volunteer battalions. On {{the left of the}} Allied encampment, Captain Emilio Mallet had ordered the {{construction}} of a large moat in front of his artillery pieces. When the Paraguayan onslaught reached it, they were in grapeshot range and unable to cross the obstacle. The Paraguayans tried to circle the artillery, avoiding the incoming fire, but encountered Antonio Sampaio's 3rd Infantry Division. This unit fought desperately in the muddy terrain though their commander died in the process. At this point, Osório ordered his reserves to attack and repelled the Paraguayan center.|$|R
2500|$|The plan {{of attack}} could now be {{characterized}} as one of [...] "single envelopment," [...] with Abercromby's column intended to turn the French left wing by marching along the beach. To this end {{the start of the}} advance had to be delayed until 6.30 AM, when low tide allowed Abercromby to use the beach. The Anglo-Russian centre advanced slowly but steadily, much hindered by the difficult terrain of the dunes on the right and the water-course-ridden plain between the dunes and the Alkmaar canal on the left. The Franco-Batavians fought a steady rear-guard action, falling back on Bergen (the French) and Koedijk (the Batavians), where they made a stand. In the afternoon the British brigade in Essen's column (General Coote) seemed to make a sudden dash in the dunes, but got too far ahead of the remainder of Essen's column, which followed far more slowly, and the French launched a spirited counter-attack from Bergen in two columns under Generals Gouvion and Boudet to exploit the gap. They <b>were</b> driven <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>some</b> difficulty, but managed to retain the village of Bergen {{for the remainder of the}} day, despite continued Anglo-Russian attacks.|$|R
60|$|They {{came back}} to camp wonderfully refreshed, glad-hearted, and ravenous; and they soon had the camp-fire blazing up again. Huck found a spring of clear cold water close by, and the boys made cups of broad oak or hickory leaves, and felt that water, {{sweetened}} with such a wildwood charm as that, {{would be a good}} enough substitute for coffee. While Joe was slicing bacon for breakfast, Tom and Huck asked him to hold on a minute; they stepped to a promising nook in the river-bank and threw in their lines; almost immediately they had reward. Joe had not had time to get impatient before they <b>were</b> <b>back</b> again <b>with</b> <b>some</b> handsome bass, a couple of sun-perch and a small catfish--provisions enough for quite a family. They fried the fish with the bacon, and were astonished; for no fish had ever seemed so delicious before. They did not know that the quicker a fresh-water fish is on the fire after he is caught the better he is; and they reflected little upon what a sauce open-air sleeping, open-air exercise, bathing, and a large ingredient of hunger make, too.|$|R
60|$|But at {{nine o'clock}} on the morning set apart for that marriage, they were all astounded by the news that Georgiana had run away with Mr Batherbolt. She had been up before six. He had met her at the park gate, and had driven her over to catch the early train at Stowmarket. Then it appeared, too, that, by degrees, various {{articles}} of her property had been conveyed to Mr Batherbolt's lodgings in the adjacent village, so that Lady Pomona's fear that Georgiana {{would not have a}} thing to wear was needless. When the fact was first known it was almost felt, in the consternation of the moment, that the Whitstable marriage must be postponed. But Sophia had a word to say to her mother on that head, and she said it. The marriage was not postponed. At first Dolly talked of going after his younger sister, and the father did dispatch various telegrams. But the fugitives could not <b>be</b> brought <b>back,</b> and <b>with</b> <b>some</b> little delay,--which made the marriage perhaps uncanonical but not illegal,--Mr George Whitstable was made a happy man.|$|R
40|$|Traditionally, the {{transport}} literature reflects {{the view that}} traffic volumes, road traffic volumes in particular, are coupled with Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Recently published literature also argues that the carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions from transport, passenger cars in particular, have not shown any decoupling from transport volumes for some years. This article presents a theoretical framework for decoupling, defining the difference between decoupling, coupling and negative decoupling. These are further broken down to weak, strong and expansive/recessive degrees of decoupling, laying emphasis on the absolute increase or decrease of the variables. The result section presents data {{of the development of}} the relationships between GDP, traffic volumes and CO 2 emissions from transport in the EU 15 countries between 1970 and 2001, including the special case of Finnish road traffic. The aggregate EU 15 data show a change from expansive negative decoupling to expansive coupling regarding passenger transport, and from weak decoupling to expansive negative decoupling regarding freight transport. Weak decoupling of transport CO 2 emissions from GDP could also be observed. Weak decoupling of all the three aspects (freight, passenger and CO 2) could be seen in the UK, Sweden and Finland in the 1990 s. In Finland, the statistics show weak decoupling of GDP from road traffic volume and strong decoupling of road traffic volume and CO 2 emissions from road traffic between 1990 and 2001. Four hypothetical explanations of the Finnish phenomenon are put forward in this article: policy towards sustainable mobility, green urban lifestyle, increasing income differences, and statistical misinterpretation. Each explanation <b>is</b> <b>backed</b> up <b>with</b> <b>some</b> quantitative evidence in observable trends in Finland during the 1990 s. ...|$|R
40|$|Two {{fundamental}} {{issues in the}} design of wireless communication networks are the interference among multiple users and the time-varying nature of the fading wireless channel. We apply fundamental techniques in information theory and queueing theory to gain insights into the structure of these problems. In a terrestrial cellular or space network, multi-user interference arises naturally as different users in the same cell or region attempt to transmit to the base station or satellite {{at the same time and}} in the same frequency range. We first examine the impact of this interference on the design of error correction codes for reliable data transmission. At the physical layer of the wireless network, the phenomenon of multi-user interference is captured by the multiaccess (many-to-one) channel model. The set of all data rates at which reliable communication can take place over this channel is characterized via information theory by the so-called multiaccess capacity region. A basic problem is developing coding schemes of relatively low complexity to achieve all rates in this capacity region. By exploiting the underlying geometrical structure of the capacity region, we develop a method of reducing the multi-user coding problem to a set of single-user coding problems using the ideas of time-sharing and successive decoding. Next, we investigate the effect of multi-user interference on higher-layer quality-of-service issues such as packet delay. Under certain conditions of symmetry, we find that the structure of the multiaccess capacity region can again be used to obtain a "load-balancing" queue control strategy which minimizes average packet delay for Poisson data sources. (cont.) Due to the mobility of users and constantly changing multipath environments, wireless channels are inherently time-varying, or fading. Any sensible design of wireless networks must take into account the nature of this fading and the ability of the system to track channel variations. We consider a wireless system in which a single user sends time-sensitive data over a slowly varying channel. Information regarding the state of the channel <b>is</b> fed <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>some</b> delay to the transmitter, while the receiver decodes messages within some fixed and finite amount of time. Under these conditions, we demonstrate a provably optimal transmission strategy which maximizes the average data rate reliably sent across the wireless channel. The strategy is based on the information-theoretic idea of "successive refinement," whereby the decoder decodes at different rates according to the observed channel state. by Edmund Meng Yeh.

In order to examine: The effect of the changing workforce composition {{with the emphasis on}} trainee and part timer to the role network ofAnak Depok Restaurant's team work A qualitative research is conducted. This qualitative research is divided into three sections, the first section is reviewing the literature, This section hopefully will give us the basic knowledge about the workforce with emphasis on the trainees and the part timer so in the next step {{we will be able to}} understand complete and able to cover all necessary area for this subject. The second section is explaining about the role network in Anak Depok Restaurant, in this section we will find the specification on both the social structure of the group and the set of norms and procedures that become an integral part of the group technologies. Basically in this part we will get to know the power hierarchy, job description for the employee, and the social connection between the employee, the last part will be answered by theory and observation. The last section is the case study. This section will be an analysis of the real situation with the first section and the second section based on the questions provided in research question. This section will <b>be</b> <b>back</b> up also <b>with</b> <b>some</b> interviews and questioner to the appropriate parties such as the supervisor, the permanent worker, the trainee and the part timer. The result of the thesis hopefully will give the restaurant some mental pictures concerning the right composition of work force from Anak Depok Restaurant with emphasis on the trainees and the part timer...|$|R
6000|$|It {{came about}} in this way. I had been unduly excited by the {{adventure}} of the tree, and sleep seemed to be impossible. Summerlee was on guard, sitting hunched over our small fire, a quaint, angular figure, his rifle across his knees and his pointed, goat-like beard wagging with each weary nod of his head. Lord John lay silent, wrapped in the South American poncho which he wore, while Challenger snored with a roll and rattle which reverberated through the woods. The full moon was shining brightly, {{and the air was}} crisply cold. What a night for a walk! And then suddenly came the thought, [...] "Why not?" [...] Suppose I stole softly away, suppose I made my way down to the central lake, suppose I <b>was</b> <b>back</b> at breakfast <b>with</b> <b>some</b> record of the place--would I not in that case be thought an even more worthy associate? Then, if Summerlee carried the day and some means of escape were found, we should return to London with first-hand knowledge of the central mystery of the plateau, to which I alone, of all men, would have penetrated. I thought of Gladys, with her [...] "There are heroisms all round us." [...] I seemed to hear her voice as she said it. I thought also of McArdle. What a three column article for the paper! What a foundation for a career! A correspondentship in the next great war might be within my reach. I clutched at a gun--my pockets were full of cartridges--and, parting the thorn bushes at the gate of our zareba, quickly slipped out. My last glance showed me the unconscious Summerlee, most futile of sentinels, still nodding away like a queer mechanical toy in front of the smouldering fire.|$|R
5000|$|On the {{way back}} to Vitoria, on September 7, he latched to a 25-year-old woman from Zaitegui, María Dolores Cortázar, who had worked as a maid in Vitoria and began to {{converse}} with her. Once he was sure that no one else was around (a mail service employee had passed them and seen them talking together), he pushed her off the road, took her handkerchief and tied it to her neck, asking for sex and promising discretion and money in return. As the victim kept resisting, he threatened her and finally stabbed her multiple times in the chest with a razor. He raped her and then stabbed her in the belly again until she died.Garayo hid the body and the food basket that the victim had been transporting, but rather than continuing to Vitoria he took a detour through the mountains where he was seen by a farmer looking for a cow, drank in a road inn called [...] "Venta del Grillo", and slept under a bridge on the Zadorra River, in the vicinity of Arriaga. He woke up at dawn and had breakfast in an inn of Arriaga, but once again, instead of continuing to Vitoria, he returned to the bridge, left the road and climbed the hill of Araca. There he happened upon a 52-year-old farmer woman from Navarrete, Manuela Audícana, who had come to Vitoria for the festival and <b>was</b> going <b>back</b> home <b>with</b> <b>some</b> food she had bought. The two conversed until it began to rain, and sought refuge beneath a tree. Garayo, who had claimed at first to be looking for a lost mare, confessed his true intentions and the woman attempted to flee, but he seized her and strangled her with her own apron. He took off all her clothes, but found himself unable to perform. As the woman was still breathing, he stabbed her in the heart and the belly with the same razor used in the previous crime, then cut the belly open and extracted the intestines and a kidney. He cleaned the blood on his hands with the victim's clothing, covered the body, ate the food in her basket, and slept again under the same bridge. In the morning, he threw the razor in the river and cleaned himself before returning to Vitoria at last, changing clothes and leaving almost immediately for Alegría. The two bodies were discovered that day.|$|R
