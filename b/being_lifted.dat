5|$|Night market: The {{concept of}} the night market traces its roots back to the medieval Chinese Tang dynasty. The Tang {{government}} put strict sanctions on night markets and their operations in A.D. 836. Towards {{the end of the}} Tang Dynasty, economic expansion led to less state regulation and restrictions <b>being</b> <b>lifted</b> on night markets. During the Song Dynasty (960-1279), Night markets {{played a central role in}} medieval Chinese nightlife. These markets were found in corners of large cities. Some stayed open for twenty- four hours. Song period night markets are also known to have included restaurants and brothels due to being frequently located near business and red light districts.|$|E
5|$|On July 16, 2009, {{as workers}} were {{assembling}} Madonna's {{stage at the}} Stade Vélodrome in Marseille for her July 19 concert, the stage collapsed, injuring eight workers and killing two. The accident caused city officials to cancel the concert. Charles Criscenzo, a 53-year-old French worker, was killed outright in the accident, which took place at around 17:15 GMT. The other worker Charles Prow, a 23-year-old from Headingley in Leeds, died overnight {{at a hospital in}} Marseille. Firefighters said the accident occurred when the roof of the stage became unbalanced as it was <b>being</b> <b>lifted</b> by four cranes, toppling one of them. Marseille city councillor Maurice de Nocera said that the roof started shaking and then collapsed gradually. This allowed the other workers to get out in time.|$|E

5|$|The three {{sections}} of decking were assembled {{on the broad}} central reservation of Princess Road, and were craned into position over a weekend when Princess Road was closed. The decking was temporarily supported by trestles until the arch was ready. The six sections of the arch were welded together on site into two halves before <b>being</b> <b>lifted</b> into position during a second weekend. The cables were connected on third weekend. The bridge was formally opened on 10 May 1997 by Alex Ferguson in a ceremony including the Lord Mayor of Manchester and Tony Wilson. The ceremony was concluded by them being driven over the bridge in a Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost, and {{was followed by a}} street festival.|$|E

They meet {{on the dance floor}} and dance intimately. Beyoncé performs an elaborate dance scene with female backing dancers. She swirls around in a champagne glass filled with bubbles. In the final scene, Beyoncé sits atop a piano and after <b>being</b> <b>lifted</b> down by a gentleman, she dances and poses as confetti falls everywhere.|$|E
5|$|In an {{underwater}} facility, {{a team of}} scientists is doing research on mako sharks to help in the re-activation of dormant human brain cells like those found in Alzheimer's disease patients. After one of their sharks escapes the facility and attempts to attack a boat full of teenagers, financial backers send corporate executive Russell Franklin to investigate the facility. In the laboratory, doctors Susan McAlester and Jim Whitlock prove their research is working by testing a certain protein complex that was removed from the brain tissue of their largest shark. However, Jim's right arm is bitten off by the animal shortly afterwards. Brenda Kerns, the tower's operator, calls a helicopter to evacuate Jim, but as he is <b>being</b> <b>lifted,</b> the stormy weather causes Jim to fall into the shark pen. The shark then grabs Jim's stretcher and pulls the helicopter into the tower, killing Brenda and the pilots.|$|E

5|$|Strasburg {{signed a}} 7-year, $175 million {{extension}} {{to remain with}} the Nationals. With the extension, Strasburg became the first National to receive an opt-out clause in his contract, which allows him to elect free agency after the 2019 or 2020 seasons if he desires. On June 26, 2016, he {{was placed on the}} 15-day disabled list due to an upper back strain. He returned on July 3 against the Cincinnati Reds, where he took a no-hitter through 6.2 innings until <b>being</b> <b>lifted</b> from the game after throwing 109 pitches. The no-hitter was broken up in the 8th inning, but the Nationals still won 12-1. On July 8, Strasburg became the first pitcher since 1912 to start 12-0. His streak of consecutive wins ran to 16, including 13 decisions in the 2016 season, before it was snapped by the Los Angeles Dodgers on July 21. On August 22, Strasburg was again placed on the 15-day disabled list due to right elbow soreness.|$|E
5|$|The earth may be personified as {{the goddess}} Bhudevi in Indian sculpture. Bhudevi is often shown {{as a small}} figure in the icon. She may be seated on or {{dangling}} from one of Varaha's tusks, or is seated {{on the corner of}} his folded elbow or his shoulder and supports herself against the tusk or the snout, as <b>being</b> <b>lifted</b> from the waters. In later Indian paintings, the whole earth or a part of it is depicted lifted up by Varaha's tusks. In Mahabalipuram, a rare portrayal shows an affectionate Varaha looking down to Bhudevi, who he carries in his arms. The earth may be portrayed as a globe, a flat stretch of mountainous land or an elaborate forest landscape with buildings, temples, humans, birds and animals. The defeated demon may be depicted trampled under Varaha's feet or being killed in combat by Varaha's gada. Nagas (snake gods) and their consorts Naginis (snake goddesses), residents of the underworld, may be depicted as swimming in the ocean with hands folded as a mark of devotion. Varaha may be also depicted standing on a snake or other minor creatures, denoting the cosmic waters.|$|E

40|$|We {{present results}} {{concerning}} the computation of Laplace eigenvalue spectra for certain arithmetic, discrete subgroups of PSL(2; C) {{acting on the}} hyperbolic upper half space. These subgroups are PSL(2; O), where O is the ring of integers of an imaginary quadratic number field Q(p). Special attention {{is devoted to the}} cases D = 1; 2; 3; 7; 11 having fundamental domains with one cusp. It is proved that the spectra are not simple. We sketch a method showing how such eigenvalues and associated eigenfunctions can be computed. Some of the eigenvalues are recognized as <b>being</b> <b>lifts</b> from the modular group PSL(2; Z). As an application to quantum chaos, we demonstrate that the spectra exhibit random fluctuations close to Poissonian. Samples of eigenvalues are listed...|$|R
