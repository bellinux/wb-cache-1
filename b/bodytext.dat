The reason for this was that the font size used by Nelsons for the Appendix was much smaller than that used for the <b>bodytext</b> of the book.

The displayed textual objects re-combine, creating the score for an emergent and ever evolving performance. <b>Bodytext</b> seeks insight into the relations between kinaesthetic experience, memory, agency and language. Dancer, audience and machine are en-meshed in a recursive dynamic they must both follow to its (il) logical conclusion, the innate entropy of the system giving structure to the overall work...|$|E
