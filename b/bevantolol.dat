5000|$|<b>Bevantolol</b> (INN) {{was a drug}} {{candidate}} for angina and hypertension that acted as both a beta blocker and a calcium channel blocker. [...] It was discovered and developed by Warner-Lambert but in January 1989 the company announced that it had withdrawn the New Drug Application; the company's chairman said: [...] "Who needs the 30th beta blocker?" [...] As of 2016 it wasn't marketed in the US, UK, or Europe and the authors of a Cochrane review could find no product monograph for it.|$|E
40|$|<b>Bevantolol</b> {{was more}} potent in {{blocking}} the chronotropic than the hypotensive effects of isoprenaline in pithed rats. <b>Bevantolol</b> itself induced bradycardia, {{so that it}} was not possible to estimate the pA 2 from nonparallel dose-response curves relating isoprenaline concentration to tachycardia. <b>Bevantolol</b> caused hypertension in pithed rats, an effect attenuated by phentolamine, implying that <b>bevantolol</b> may be an alpha-adrenoceptor agonist. <b>Bevantolol</b> potentiated the pressor effects of noradrenaline, the maximum potentiation equalling that produced by prior chemical sympathectomy with guanethidine, implying that <b>bevantolol</b> may block noradrenaline uptake. In isolated atria bevantolol-induced bradycardia was associated with a positive shift in take-off potential, a reduction in the maximum rate of depolarization (Vmax), and a lengthening of action potential duration (APD). No change in the slope of the slow diastolic depolarization occurred except at the highest concentration (18 mumol l(- 1). In atrial and ventricular muscle <b>bevantolol</b> reduced Vmax and overshoot potential, implying reduction of fast inward sodium current (Class I antiarrhythmic action). In pithed rats <b>bevantolol</b> lengthened the P-R interval in the ECG, and produced atrioventricular (A-V) block, and bundle-branch block. In isolated A-V nodal preparations, intranodal conduction time was greatly increased, implying restriction of inward current through calcium channels responsible for nodal depolarization. <b>Bevantolol</b> had no negative inotropic effect in pithed rats, or in isolated atria, and did not alter the positive inotropic effect of raised extracellular calcium concentration, implying absence of restriction of current through calcium channels controlling contraction of the myocardium...|$|E
40|$|<b>Bevantolol</b> hydrochloride, a beta {{adrenoceptor}} antagonist, can be catego-rized using conventional schemes {{as being}} cardioselective, devoid of intrinsic sympathomimetic activity and having weak membrane-stabilizing and local an-esthetic properties. The cardioselectivity of <b>bevantolol</b> was conferred by {{the incorporation of}} a 3, 4 -dimethoxyphenyl moiety into the terminal amino portion of the molecule. This portion of the molecule also appears to account for bevan-tolol’s in vitro binding affinity at alpha-adrenoceptor sites; the in vivo signifi-cance of which remains unclear. In the various cardiovascular disease-state models, bevantolol’s profile differed from that of propranolol, i. e., there was no initial pressor response in spontaneously hypertensive or renal hypertensive rats. In a myocardial ischemia model, <b>bevantolol,</b> unlike propranolol, increased contractile function in the ischemic myocardium. A ring hydroxylated urinary metabolite, which occured only in trace amounts in human urine, had an inter-esting profile when studied in animals at pharmacologic doses. It ranked high in cardioselectivity (like <b>bevantolol),</b> but unlike <b>bevantolol</b> showed significant in-trinsic beta sympathomimetic activity. The clinical significance of this metabo-lite, if any, remains to be established. Collectively the preclinical profile of <b>bevantolol</b> showed it to have an interesting profile for a beta adrenoceptor an-tagonist {{in a variety of}} pharmacologic test systems...|$|E
40|$|Every {{year the}} number of β-blockers on the {{pharmaceutical}} market is increasing, requiring systematization of their standardization methods. Aim of research. The aim of our research is to study literature data about identification and assay methods of β-blockers with different direction of action – selective (praktolol, metoprolol, atenolol, acebutolol, betaxolol, <b>bevantolol,</b> bisoprolol, celiprolol, esmolol, epanolol, esatenolol, nebivolol, Talinolol), non-selective (alprenolol, Oxprenololum, pindolol, propranolol, timolol, sotalol, nadolol, mepindolol, karteol, tertatolol, bopindolol, bupranolol, penbutolol, kloranolol) and combined (labetalol, carvedilol). Methods. The analytical review of literature sources about β-blockers analysis by physical, chemical, and physicochemical methods. Results. After literature sources’ analyzing {{it was found that}} physical and physicochemical constants are basically used for β-blockers pharmacopoeial analysis; both physicochemical values and chemical reactions are used in forensic analysis, resulting in the article. It was founded that titration methods, mostly acid-base titration method, are used for β-blockers assay in the analysis of substances. For β-blockers detection in biological fluids and dosage forms, active pharmaceutical ingredients and metabolites mixture separation one should prefer physicochemical methods, such as gas chromatography and liquid chromatography, absorption UV-Visible spectroscopy, fluorometry, etc. Conclusion. The results have shown can be used for the further search of the identification and assay optimal methods of β-blockers both pure and mixed with other active substances and excipients</p...|$|E
40|$|Atypical β-adrenoceptors {{resistant}} to propranolol, but blocked by bupranolol, increase contractile force and/or {{frequency of the}} heart in humans and rats. We compared the potencies of the enantiomers of bupranolol and examined the possible effects of seven bupranolol analogues including <b>bevantolol</b> (BEV) at this receptor in pithed and vagotomized rats. CGP 12177, an agonist of the atypical β-adrenoceptor, increased heart rate dose-dependently. Its dose–response curve was shifted to the right by S-(−) -bupranolol 10 μmol kg− 1 {{by a factor of}} 8. 4, but not affected by the same dose of R-(+) -bupranolol. Desmethylbupranolol and compounds BK- 21, BK- 22, BK- 23 and BK- 25 also increased heart rate dose-dependently. The β 1 -adrenoceptor antagonist CGP 20712 given in combination with the β 2 -adrenoceptor antagonist ICI 118, 551 (0. 1 μmol kg− 1 each) reduced the positive chronotropic action of the five bupranolol analogues without affecting that of CGP 12177. The potencies of the bupranolol analogues to increase heart rate were correlated (r= 0. 91, P< 0. 05) with their affinities for β 1 -adrenoceptor binding sites in rat brain cortex membranes labelled with [3 H]CGP 12177 (in the presence of ICI 118, 551). BK- 26 and BEV, 10 μmol kg− 1 each, had only minor effects on heart rate by themselves and did not antagonize the effect of CGP 12177. However, at 1 μmol kg− 1, they antagonized the increase in heart rate elicited by the β 1 -adrenoceptor agonist prenalterol. In conclusion, bupranolol is a stereoselective antagonist at the atypical cardiostimulant β-adrenoceptor. The effects of the bupranolol analogues are related to the activation or blockade of β 1 -adrenoceptors, but not of atypical β-adrenoceptors...|$|E
