40|$|DE 102007030413 A 1 UPAB: 20090222 NOVELTY - The {{method for}} {{investigating}} {{the effect of}} a gaseous medium on a <b>biological</b> <b>test</b> system (28) using an extracellular-metabolizing system, comprises examining the <b>biological</b> <b>test</b> system on a permeable support (30), guiding the gaseous medium over a surface of the <b>biological</b> <b>test</b> system for the formation of an exposure atmosphere above the <b>biological</b> <b>test</b> system, adding the extracellular-metabolizing system to a maintenance medium, and positioning the maintenance medium with the extracellular-metabolizing system below the permeable support. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The method for investigating {{the effect of a}} gaseous medium on a <b>biological</b> <b>test</b> system (28) using an extracellular-metabolizing system, comprises examining the <b>biological</b> <b>test</b> system on a permeable support (30), guiding the gaseous medium over a surface of the <b>biological</b> <b>test</b> system for the formation of an exposure atmosphere above the <b>biological</b> <b>test</b> system, adding the extracellular-metabolizing system to a maintenance medium, positioning the maintenance medium with the extracellular-metabolizing system below the permeable support, adjusting the depression of the extracellular-metabolizing system admitted to the maintenance medium through the permeable support by giving a determined pressure affecting on the maintenance medium with the metabolizing system, and regulating the evaporation rate over the culture by giving a determined temperature in direct surrounding region of the <b>biological</b> <b>test</b> system and/or giving a determined flow rate of the gaseous medium flowing over the surface of the <b>biological</b> <b>test</b> system. The pressure effected on the maintenance medium is selected, so that the metabolizing system depresses through the permeable support and the <b>biological</b> <b>test</b> system does not inundate from the maintenance medium with the metabolizing system. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for an exposure device for investigating the effect of a gaseous medium on a <b>biological</b> <b>test</b> system using an extracellular-metabolizing system. USE - Method for investigating the effect of a gaseous medium on a <b>biological</b> <b>test</b> system using an extracellular-metabolizing system useful for exposing the <b>biological</b> <b>test</b> system in cigarette smoke or in automobile- or industrial exhaust gases, for investigating the environmental atmospheres, work-station atmospheres or inner-space atmospheres, for investigating the effect of a gaseous medium on a <b>biological</b> <b>test</b> system in the field of product security, consumer protection, pharmaceutical development, production supervision or medicine technology, for investigating the effect of a gaseous medium on a <b>biological</b> <b>test</b> system under the observance of {{organization for economic cooperation and}} development (OECD) guidelines, and for investigating toxicological effects, genotoxic effects, immunomodulatory or immunotoxic effects or others biological or toxicological relevant cellular changes (all claimed). ADVANTAGE - The method is capable of effectively, reliably and simply investigating the effect of the gaseous medium on the <b>biological</b> <b>test</b> system with high sensitivity and selectivity thus reducing the complexity of cultural practices, and capable of regulating and controlling the flow rate of the gaseous medium on the <b>biological</b> <b>test</b> system...|$|R

2500|$|All natural {{products}} begin as mixtures with other compounds {{from the natural}} source, often very complex mixtures, from which the product of interest must be isolated and purified. The isolation of a natural product refers, depending on context, either to the isolation of sufficient quantities of pure chemical matter for chemical structure elucidation, derivitzation/degradation chemistry, <b>biological</b> <b>testing,</b> and other research needs (generally milligrams to grams, but historically, often more), or to the isolation of [...] "analytical quantities" [...] of the substance of interest, where {{the focus is on}} identification and quantitation of the substance (e.g. in biological tissue or fluid), and where the quantity isolated depends on the analytical method applied (but is generally always sub-microgram in scale). The ease with which the active agent can be isolated and purified depends on the structure, stability, and quantity of the natural product. The methods of isolation applied toward achieving these two distinct scales of product are likewise distinct, but generally involve extraction, precipitation, adsorptions, chromatography, and sometimes crystallizations. In both cases, the isolated substance is purified to chemical homogeneity, i.e. specific combined separation and analytical methods such as LC-MS methods are chosen to be [...] "orthogonal"—achieving their separations based on distinct modes of interaction between substance and isolating matrix—with the goal being repeated detection of only a single species present in the putative pure sample. Early isolation is almost inevitably followed by structure determination, especially if an important pharmacologic activity is associated with the purified natural product.|$|E

40|$|Metabolic and {{nutritional}} diseases typically increase as milk production increases and as dairy herds become larger. These factors favor {{the use of}} rigorous, quantitative monitoring of metabolic {{and nutritional}} diseases whenever possible. This paper will focus on strategies for testing and monitoring three critical diseases in dairy herds- subacute ruminal acidosis (SARA), ketosis, and parturient hypocalcemia (clinical plus subclinical milk fever). Enough quantitative data about these diseases is available {{to allow for the}} development of a herd-based testing scheme. Additionally, these three disorders are gateway conditions for other problems such as laminitis, displaced abomasum, impaired immune function, retained placenta, and cystic ovarian disease. Other metabolic diseases can be important problems in dairies (e. g., hypomagnesemia, udder edema, hypokalemia, etc), but these are less common disorders and there are limited published data available to permit the development of a testing scheme. 15 Sources of Error in Herd-Based <b>Testing.</b> <b>Biological</b> <b>tests</b> can be very useful in supporting other clinical evidence of a metabolic disease problem on a dairy.

In this study, we have developed new methods to perform a PheWAS based on ICD- 10 codes and <b>biological</b> <b>test</b> results, and to use a quantitative trait as the selection criterion. We tested our approach on thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) activity in patients treated by thiopurine drugs. We developed 2 aggregation methods for the ICD- 10 codes: an ICD- 10 hierarchy and a mapping to existing ICD- 9 -CM based PheWAS codes. Eleven <b>biological</b> <b>test</b> results were also analyzed using discretization algorithms. We applied these methods in patients having a TPMT activity assessment from the clinical data warehouse of a French academic hospital between January 2000 and July 2013. Data after initiation of thiopurine treatment were analyzed and patient groups were compared according to their TPMT activity level. A total of 442 patient records were analyzed representing 10, 252 ICD- 10 codes and 72, 711 <b>biological</b> <b>test</b> results. The results from the ICD- 9 -CM based PheWAS codes and ICD- 10 hierarchy codes were concordant.

40|$|Aim: To {{confirm the}} over {{prescribing}} pattern of <b>biological</b> <b>tests</b> for in-patients, {{to identify the}} causes and to suggest improvement measures. Methods: Data have been extracted from the data warehouse of the Public Hospitals of Paris (Assitance Publique – Hôpitaux de Paris). We used the value of each test determined by the French National Health Insurance Fund for Salaried Workers for reimbursement. Analysesof the volume of prescription of <b>biological</b> <b>tests</b> by the volume of activity per clinical department were performed. Finally, heads of laboratories and clinical departments have been invited for semi-directive interviews. Results: The average expenditure for <b>biological</b> <b>tests</b> per patient adjusted by the case-mix was higher in our hospital than in the sample of hospitals included the National Cost Scale (sample of voluntary public and private hospitals collecting detailed cost and activity data). The difference increased from 25 % in 2006 to 55 % in 2007. Comparing expenditure in biology by number of stays, we identified specific departments for which the increase of <b>biological</b> <b>tests</b> prescriptions was higher than the increase of their activity (number of stays). The main issues were: completeness and accuracyof data, in particular research activities were under identified; increased supply (new tests available and automatic instruments in clinical department); increased demand (new activities in particular in oncology) and new indications (BNP and troponin). Conclusions: The goal {{of this approach is}} not to spy on physicians’ prescribing behaviour but to develop tools to monitor and improve the efficient use of laboratories resources.
