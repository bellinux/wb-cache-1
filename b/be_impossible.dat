5|$|A federal {{government}} is only sensible, for Russell, when it has limited but well-defined powers. Russell advocates {{the creation of a}} world government made up of sovereign nation-states (Russell 1938:197, 230–31). On his view, the function of a world government should only be to ensure the avoidance of war and the pursuit of peace (Russell 1938:230-31). On the world stage, democracy would <b>be</b> <b>impossible,</b> because of the negligible power any particular individual could have in comparison with the entire human race.|$|E
5|$|As a {{harpsichord}}ist, Pinnock toured Europe {{with the}} Academy of St. Martin in the Fields. While {{a student at}} the RCM, he was told by the registrar, John Stainer, that it would <b>be</b> <b>impossible</b> to make a living as a harpsichordist. He made his London debut at the Royal Festival Hall in 1966 with the Galliard Harpsichord Trio, which he co-founded with Stephen Preston, flute, and Anthony Pleeth, cello. At this stage, they were playing baroque music on modern instruments. His solo harpsichord debut was in 1968 at the Purcell Room in London.|$|E
5|$|As {{the month}} {{came to a}} close, serious {{concerns}} were being raised by some observers regarding Enron's possible manipulation of accepted accounting rules; however, analysis was claimed to <b>be</b> <b>impossible</b> based on the incomplete information provided by Enron. Industry analysts feared that Enron was the new Long-Term Capital Management, the hedge fund whose bankruptcy in 1998 threatened systemic failure of the international financial markets. Enron's tremendous presence worried some {{about the consequences of}} the company's possible bankruptcy. Enron executives accepted questions in written form only.|$|E

5000|$|Ladies and gentlemen, {{you have}} no idea how good it makes me feel to be here today. It is truly an honor to risk my life for you. An honor. Before I jump this {{motorcycle}} over these 19 cars — and I want you to know there's not a Volkswagen or a Datsun in the row — before I sail cleanly over that last truck, I want to tell you that last night a kid came up to me and he said, [...] "Mr Knievel, are you crazy? That jump you're going to make <b>is</b> <b>impossible,</b> but I already have my tickets because I want to see you splatter." [...] That's right, that's what he said. And I told that boy last night that nothing <b>is</b> <b>impossible.</b> Now they told Columbus to sail across the ocean <b>was</b> <b>impossible.</b> They told the settlers to live in a wild land <b>was</b> <b>impossible.</b> They told the Wright Brothers to fly <b>was</b> <b>impossible.</b> And they probably told Neil Armstrong a walk on the moon <b>was</b> <b>impossible.</b> They tell Evel Knievel to jump a motorcycle across the Grand Canyon <b>is</b> <b>impossible,</b> and they say that every day. A Roman General in the time of Caesar had the motto: [...] "If it is possible, it is done. If it <b>is</b> <b>impossible,</b> it will <b>be</b> done."

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the First World War, the Austro-Hungarian Navy's U-boat fleet consisted of six largely experimental submarines of three classes. The Navy had five larger, more modern submarines (what would have been the U-7 class) under construction in Germany at the outbreak of war, but when the Navy became convinced that delivery of the U-7 boats would <b>be</b> <b>impossible,</b> they were sold to Germany in November 1914.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{constant}} {{attention to the}} business, the poor supply and insufficient supply of free-labor products proved to be insurmountable, {{making it impossible for}} Coffin to find a replacement to run the company so that he could return to Indiana.

Coffin sold the business in 1857, after deciding it would <b>be</b> <b>impossible</b> to maintain a profitable business.|$|E
5|$|Hitler's {{motivation}} for authorising Himmler's speeches was {{to ensure that}} all party leaders were made aware of these plans and actions. Thus, it would <b>be</b> <b>impossible</b> for them to later deny knowledge of the killings.

5|$|Neither U-10 {{nor any of}} {{her sister}} boats were {{complete}} when World War I began in August 1914.
