500|$|Record {{producer}} <b>Brian</b> <b>Ross</b> {{just happened}} upon the Music Machine at Hollywood Legion Lanes, {{a bowling alley}} that was an early stomping ground for the group, and signed them to a recording contract with Original Sound. [...] On July 30, 1966, the band entered RCA Studios in Los Angeles to [...] record the Bonniwell originals [...] "Talk Talk" [...] and [...] "Come on In", which was initially {{going to be the}} A-side for the group's debut single. [...] Bonniwell had composed [...] "Talk Talk" [...] a year prior to forming the band, and the studio time was marked by the Music Machine's collective input aimed toward tightening the structure of its arrangements, including the two-note fuzz guitar riffs and Edgar's precise drumming technique. By virtue of the group's dedication to rehearsal, recording sessions concluded with the Music Machine requiring only three takes to complete the two songs. Though the band was satisfied with the acetate to [...] "Come on In", the members were convinced [...] "Talk Talk" [...] would propel them into the national charts.|$|E

2500|$|In late October 2001, ABC chief investigative {{correspondent}} <b>Brian</b> <b>Ross</b> {{linked the}} anthrax sample to Saddam Hussein {{because of its}} purportedly containing the unusual additive bentonite.

The discovery of bentonite came in an urgent series of tests conducted at Fort Detrick, Maryland, and elsewhere."

[...] This stands in contrast to the statement of the president of CBS News that proof of authenticity is [...] "the only acceptable journalistic standard." [...] Also in November 2005, Mapes told readers of the Washington Post, [...] "I personally believe the documents are not false," [...] and [...] "I was fired for airing a story that could not definitively be proved false but made CBS's public relations department cringe." [...] As of September 2007, Mapes continued to defend the authenticity of the documents: [...] "the far right blogosphere bully boys...screamed objections that ultimately proved to have no basis in fact." ...|$|E
