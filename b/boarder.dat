5|$|Both {{families}} were largely Unitarian, though the Wedgwoods were adopting Anglicanism. Robert Darwin, himself quietly a freethinker, had baby Charles baptised in November 1809 in the Anglican St Chad's Church, Shrewsbury, but Charles and his siblings attended the Unitarian chapel with their mother. The eight-year-old Charles {{already had a}} taste for natural history and collecting {{when he joined the}} day school run by its preacher in 1817. That July, his mother died. From September 1818, he joined his older brother Erasmus attending the nearby Anglican Shrewsbury School as a <b>boarder.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1930, Downes' son John, then in {{his first}} year as a <b>boarder</b> at Geelong Grammar School, fell seriously ill with meningitis. Despite the best efforts of two eminent medical practitioners, Dr Keith Fairley and Dr Reginald Webster, John succumbed to {{toxaemia}} and died in 1933, at the age of 10. The failure of modern medicine to save his son affected Downes deeply, and led him to abandon his medical career in favour of a military one.|$|E
5|$|On April 12, 1865, Booth {{heard the}} news that Robert E. Lee had {{surrendered}} at Appomattox Court House. He told Louis J. Weichmann, a friend of John Surratt and a <b>boarder</b> at Mary Surratt's house, that he {{was done with the}} stage and that the only play he wanted to present henceforth was Venice Preserv'd. Weichmann did not understand the reference; Venice Preserv'd is about an assassination plot. Booth's scheme to kidnap Lincoln was no longer feasible with the Union Army's capture of Richmond and Lee's surrender, and he changed his goal to assassination.|$|E
50|$|The {{years of}} study are from pre-primary to grade 12. <b>Boarders</b> are {{accommodated}} in four boarding hostels: Dunn House for junior <b>boarders,</b> Storey House for junior secondary <b>boarders,</b> and Twells and Chandler Houses for senior <b>boarders.</b>|$|R
25|$|There are {{spaces for}} 99 <b>boarders</b> in the Academy's three {{boarding}} houses. Both weekly <b>boarders</b> (Monday – Friday) and full <b>boarders</b> are accepted.|$|R
50|$|In 1911, {{requests}} {{were made}} to Canon McClemans to take <b>boarders.</b> Initially, there was no boarding house and the first <b>boarders</b> resided with the McClemans family in the Rectory. Boarding reached its peak in the 1980s when {{almost a quarter of}} the student population were <b>boarders.</b> Today, there are 110 <b>boarders</b> who live in the Walters Residential Community. The residential community at Christ Church is organised to facilitate integration between the <b>boarders</b> and day boys enabling <b>boarders</b> to be more involved in the wider school community.|$|R
5|$|Between 1897 and 1900 Pound {{attended}} Cheltenham Military Academy, {{sometimes as}} a <b>boarder,</b> where he specialized in Latin. The boys wore Civil War-style uniforms and besides Latin were taught English, history, arithmetic, marksmanship, military drilling {{and the importance}} of submitting to authority. Pound made his first trip overseas in mid-1898 when he was 13, a three-month tour of Europe with his mother and Frances Weston (Aunt Frank), who took him to England, Belgium, Germany, Switzerland and Italy. After the academy he may have attended Cheltenham Township High School for one year, and in 1901, aged 15, he was admitted to the University of Pennsylvania's College of Liberal Arts.|$|E
5|$|Ernest {{decided that}} the train {{journeys}} and frozen limbs were too much for his son, so he sent Bill to St Patrick's College, Goulburn as a <b>boarder</b> in 1921, where he quickly showed his athletic flair by becoming {{a member of the}} school's rugby league, tennis, athletics and cricket teams. He held a state record for the triple jump. At the same time, he also represented the town team. During his time at St Patrick's, O'Reilly developed his ruthless and parsimonious attitude towards bowling. After three years at the Irish Catholic school, funded by a scholarship, O'Reilly completed his Leaving Certificate.|$|E
5|$|In September 1883 he went as a <b>boarder</b> to Field House Preparatory School in Rottingdean on {{the south}} coast of England, forty miles from Wotton. He was {{generally}} happy there, although he was shocked to encounter {{for the first time}} social snobbery and political conservatism which were rife among his fellow pupils. From there he moved on to the public school Charterhouse in January 1887. His academic and sporting achievements there were satisfactory, and the school encouraged his musical development. In 1888 he organised a concert in the school hall, which included a performance of his G major Piano Trio (now lost) with the composer as violinist.|$|E
50|$|The {{organisation}} still {{continues at}} Champhai with 63 <b>boarders,</b> and in addition, has established rehabilitation centres at Lunglei with 95 <b>boarders,</b> and at Kolasib with 40 <b>boarders.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... ran a three tier {{system of}} boarding. Parlour <b>boarders,</b> {{ordinary}} <b>boarders,</b> and charity <b>boarders.</b> The Parlour <b>boarders</b> were treated like {{residents of a}} five star hotel, Ordinary like two star residents, and Charity like poor relations, only a little better off than the orphan children described in the novels of Charles Dickens.|$|R
5000|$|Hostel {{furniture}} duly numbered {{shall be}} issued to the <b>boarders</b> and the <b>boarders</b> shall {{be held responsible for}} any damage. In case of damage to electric installations the <b>boarders</b> shall be held responsible collectively.|$|R
5|$|In September 1928 Britten went as a <b>boarder</b> to Gresham's School, in Holt, Norfolk. At {{the time}} he felt unhappy there, even writing in his diary of contemplating suicide or running away: he hated being {{separated}} from his family, most particularly from his mother; he despised the music master; and he was shocked at the prevalence of bullying, though {{he was not the}} target of it. He remained there for two years and in 1930, he won a composition scholarship at the Royal College of Music (RCM) in London; his examiners were the composers John Ireland and Ralph Vaughan Williams and the college's harmony and counterpoint teacher, S P Waddington.|$|E
5|$|The {{father was}} {{eventually}} fired by his Russian supervisors for pro-Polish sentiments, {{and forced to}} take lower-paying posts; the family also lost money on a bad investment, and eventually chose to supplement their income by lodging boys in the house. Maria's mother Bronisława operated a prestigious Warsaw boarding school for girls; she resigned from the position after Maria was born. She died of tuberculosis in May 1878, when Maria was ten years old. Less than three years earlier, Maria's oldest sibling, Zofia, had died of typhus contracted from a <b>boarder.</b> Maria's father was an atheist; her mother a devout Catholic. The deaths of Maria's mother and sister caused her to give up Catholicism and become agnostic.|$|E
5|$|Trent Milton (born 4 May 1972) is an Australian Paralympic snowboarder who, {{at the age}} of 41, {{competed for}} Australia at the 2014 Winter Paralympics in Sochi. An active surfer, snowboarder, stand up paddle <b>boarder,</b> motorcross and {{mountain}} biker, he took up Para-snowboarding after a motorcycle accident that cost him his lower right leg. He made his international debut after just 18 months. After his first season resulted in fifth and sixth place finishes, he was ranked 20th in the world. He finished 20th in the Men's Para-Snowboard Cross at the 2014 Winter Paralympic Games in Sochi.|$|E

5|$|A {{year later}} {{she arrived in}} Paris to attend the École Normale de Neuilly. The school {{provided}} its female pupils with classes in chemistry and bookkeeping, in addition to traditionally feminine arts such as embroidery. Her roommate was Noémie, the daughter of Henri Rochefort, who had been imprisoned in New Caledonia for his support of the Paris Commune. The girls shared tales of their parents' political exploits, and remained good friends for years. Pankhurst was so fond of Noémie and the school that after graduating she returned with her sister Mary as a parlour <b>boarder.</b> Noémie had married a Swiss painter and quickly found a suitable French husband for her English friend. When Robert Goulden refused to provide a dowry for his daughter, the man withdrew his offer of marriage and Pankhurst returned, miserable, to Manchester.|$|E
5|$|Bellette {{was born}} in Hobart on 25 March 1908 and grew up an only child in rural Tasmania with her artist mother and {{postmaster}} father. Initially {{a student at the}} local Anglican school in Deloraine, at the age of 13 she became a <b>boarder</b> at Friends' School in Hobart, and then at Hobart's technical college. She was subsequently a student at Julian Ashton's art school in Sydney. Her teachers included Thea Proctor, and fellow students included artist John Passmore. Her drawings and watercolours displayed in the 1934 student art exhibition attracted favourable comment from the art critic for The Sydney Morning Herald. At Ashton's art school, Bellette met fellow Australian artist Paul Haefliger, and in 1935 they married. The following year they travelled to Europe, and Bellette (like Passmore) studied at the Westminster School of Art, where she was taught by figurative painters Bernard Meninsky and Mark Gertler. In 1938, Bellette and her husband studied life drawing at Académie de la Grande Chaumière in Paris.|$|E
5|$|The {{house was}} built in 1759 for John Vassall, who fled the Cambridge area at the {{beginning}} of the American Revolutionary War because of his loyalty to the king of England. George Washington occupied the house as his headquarters, beginning July 16, 1775. It served as his base of operations during the Siege of Boston, until he moved out on April 4, 1776. Andrew Craigie, Washington's Apothecary General, was the next person to own the home for a significant period of time. After purchasing the house in 1791, he instigated the home's only major addition. Craigie's financial situation at the time of his death in 1819 forced his widow Elizabeth Craigie to take in boarders. It was as a <b>boarder</b> that Henry Wadsworth Longfellow came into the home. He became its owner in 1843, when his father-in-law Nathan Appleton purchased it as a wedding gift. He lived in the home until his death in 1882.|$|E
50|$|The Royal Alexandra and Albert School {{is a true}} {{boarding}} school in that all its pupils are <b>boarders</b> and there is school on Saturday mornings so that <b>boarders</b> can have longer holidays. Around half are full <b>boarders</b> who go home at weekends and for holidays. The rest are Flexi <b>Boarders</b> who stay for the extended day and stay overnight for between 7 and 10 nights a year.|$|R

50|$|Rippin' Riders was {{originally}} released in Japan {{under the name}} Cool <b>Boarders</b> Burrrn. For the US release, UEP opted to release the Cool <b>Boarders</b> sequel under the name Rippin' Riders Snowboarding. This {{was due to the}} U.S. rights to the Cool <b>Boarders</b> name being owned by Sony Computer Entertainment whose 989 Studios (a now defunct division of Sony Computer Entertainment America) published the US releases of Cool <b>Boarders</b> 3 and Cool <b>Boarders</b> 4 for the PlayStation. It has never been confirmed if the European release (known as Snow Surfers) had its name changed for similar reasons.|$|R
5|$|The Burnets {{moved to}} Terang in 1909, when Frank was posted {{to be the}} bank manager there, having {{declined}} a post in London. Burnet {{was interested in the}} wildlife around the nearby lake; he joined the Scouts in 1910 and enjoyed all outdoor activities. While living in Terang, he began to collect beetles and study biology. He read biology articles in the Chambers's Encyclopaedia, which introduced him to the work of Charles Darwin. During his early teens, the family took annual holidays to Port Fairy, where Burnet spent his time observing and recording the behaviour of the wildlife. He was educated at Terang State School and attended Sunday school at the local church, where the priest encouraged him to pursue scholastic studies and awarded him a book on ants as a reward for his academic performance. He advised Frank to invest in Mac's education and he won a full scholarship to board and study at Geelong College, one of Victoria's most exclusive private schools. Starting there in 1913, Burnet was the only <b>boarder</b> with a full scholarship. He did not enjoy his time there among the scions of the ruling upper class; while most of his peers were brash and sports-oriented, Burnet was bookish and not athletically inclined, and found his fellow students to be arrogant and boorish. During this period he kept his beetle-collecting and disapproval of his peers a secret and mixed with his schoolmates out of necessity. Nevertheless, his academic prowess gained him privileges, and he graduated in 1916, placing first in his school overall, and in history, English, chemistry and physics. The typical university path for a person of his social background was to pursue studies in theology, law or medicine. By this time, he was becoming disillusioned with religion and chose medicine. Due to World War I, military service was a possibility and he felt that a medical background would increase his chances of being given a non-combat post.|$|E
25|$|Detectives {{surrounded}} a {{house near}} Madison and Robey Streets, {{and threw a}} dragnet over the southwestern side of town for a former <b>boarder</b> in the Paroubek home. They continued {{to search for the}} anonymous writer of the nasty letters received by Frank Paroubek. Apparently neither the <b>boarder,</b> the writer, or the unknown man who had spoken to Frank were ever found. No one knows what really happened to Elsie Paroubek.|$|E
