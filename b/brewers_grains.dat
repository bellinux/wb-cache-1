40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{investigation}} of the possible using of <b>brewer’s</b> <b>grain</b> as a source of growth substabces in acetone-butanol fermentation of lignocellulosic hydrolysates {{in order to reduce the}} cost of biobutanol production and to utilize the brewery waste. The fermentation of glucose was carried out at different concentrations of the <b>brewer’s</b> <b>grain</b> by Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824. In the experiments on fermentation of the lignocellulosic hydrolysates an enzymatic hydrolysate of miscanthus cellulose containing 34. 8 g/l glucose and 15. 6 g/l xylose was used as a source of reducing substances. The sterilization of the medium was carried out at 0. 5 KPa for 20 minutes. The sterilization of the growth and reducing substances sources was conducted separately to prevent caramelization of products and melanoidins. For inoculation the spores of 3 % (vol/vol) C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824 were transferred to a fresh medium. The strain was grown at 37 °С under anaerobic conditions. In a series of experiments on the evaluation of the influence of the <b>brewer’s</b> <b>grain</b> on the fermentability of carbohydrates by the strain of C. acetobutylicum АТСС 824, limiting and inhibitive concentrations of <b>brewer’s</b> <b>grain</b> were determined in the medium, which were 2 and 20 % vol., respectively. The optimal amount of the <b>brewer’s</b> <b>grain</b> was about 6 % vol. At the optimal concentration of the <b>brewer’s</b> <b>grain</b> the fermentation of lignocellulosic hydrolysates occured in all replicates. It was characterized by intensive gas and foam formation that corresponds to the data in literature. After 79 - 88 h of fermentation of miscanthus cellulose hydrolysate the product yield amounted 10. 14 ± 0. 87 g/L butanol, 02. 48 ± 0. 53 acetone, 01. 02 ± 0. 42 g/L ethanol. It was found that at an optimum concentration both the fresh and sour <b>brewer’s</b> <b>grain</b> can be used in the fermentation. After the acetone-butanol fermentation the <b>brewer’s</b> <b>grain</b> can be used as a food for farm animals. The obtained results indicate the possibility of using the <b>brewer’s</b> <b>grain</b> as a source of growth substances for the fermentation of lignocellulosic hydrolysates.

Surface spoilage, chemical composition and microorganism density were analyzed. An in vitro gas test was also conducted to determine the pH, ammonia-nitrogen and volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentrations after 24 h incubation. Surface spoilage was apparent at higher temperatures such as 25 °C and 35 °C. Nutrients contents decreased concomitantly with prolonged storage times (p< 0. 01) and increasing temperatures (p< 0. 01).

Influence of treatment was evident on the process of fermentation, levels of the nitrogen-free extract substances (NFES) and number of forming colony units (FCU) of moulds in the winter period. The fermentation activities in both tested masses were documented, however the decrease of intent of NFES in treated variants was highly conclusive (P < 0. 01) lower than that of untreated variants. Stagnation of increase of formol titration in treated BG matches the same tendency. Significant (P < 0. 01) limitation of mould growth was noted at treated BG, the number of FCU of moulds stagnated since 1 st to 5 th to day of testing. On the other hand the number of FCU of moulds in untreated BG was redoubled after 4 days since the start of testing. Treatment influenced monitored parameters above all in the early gout after the start of tes­ting.

Aerobic deterioration occurred promptly in ensiling materials (nonensiled by-products and total mixed ration mixtures) and in silages stored alone; however, SCT and BGT silages resisted deterioration and no heating was found for more than 5. 5 d regardless of storage period. Silages were stable even with high yeast populations at silo opening, whereas prolonged ensiling decreased yeast counts in the 2 total mixed ration silages. The denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis profiles appeared similar between SCT and BGT silages but not between SC and BG silages. Weissella spp. and Lactobacillus brevis were common in aerobically stable SCT and BGT silages, and Lactobacillus buchneri was detected only in BGT silage. Both L. brevis and L. buchneri were found in silage but not in ensiling materials. Several other lactic acid bacteria were also identified in SCT and BGT silages, but {{did not appear to be}} related to fermentation and aerobic stability. </p...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the fermentation quality and nutritive value of fermented total mixed ration (FTMR) treated with various level of the fermented juice of epiphytic lactic acid bacteria (FJLB). The TMR was prepared using ground rice straw, cassava chips, soybean meal, cotton seeds, tomato pomace, dried <b>brewers</b> <b>grains,</b> molasses, urea and vitamin-mineral supplement in ratio of 20. 35 : 40. 79 : 7. 24 : 10. 0 : 5. 04 : 5. 04 : 7. 33 : 1. 37 : 2. 84, respectively, on a dry matter basis. The moisture of all TMR was adjusted with water to 45 %. The TMR was treated with the FJLB at 0, 0. 1, 0. 25 and 0. 5 % (w/w) of fresh TMR. The FTMR were opened after 1, 3, 5, 7, 14 and 25 days, respectively, after ensiling for the chemical analysis. All treated FTMR were well preserved, which a low pH and ammonia-nitrogen (NH 3 -N) content and a high lactic acid content. Increasing level of FJLB addition in the FTMR resulted in significantly lower NH 3 -N/TN content (P< 0. 05). Butyric acid content of all FTMR was not detected at 25 d of ensiling. The dry matter and crude protein contents of FTMR treated with 0. 25 %FJLB were higher (P< 0. 05) than the untreated FTMR. However, these contents of all treated FTMR were similar. These studies suggested that the fermentation quality and chemical compositions of FTMR were improved by applying the FJLB as an additive at least 0. 25 % (w/w) ...|$|E

40|$|Potential factors {{influencing}} reproductive performance {{were examined in}} a high producing Holstein Friesian dairy herd. There were two genetic groups: a selection line (S) consisting of heifers and cows with the highest genetic merit for kg fat plus protein in the UK, and a control line (C) consisting of heifers and cows of average genetic merit for kg fat plus protein. Within each group, heifers {{were randomly assigned to}} either a high concentrate (HC: Annual average intake of about 2. 5 ton per cow) or low concentrate (LC: Annual average intake of about 1. 0 ton per cow) complete diet based on grass silage, <b>brewers</b> <b>grains</b> and concentrates. The mean milk yields during the first 26 weeks of lactation for cows in the S-HC, C-HC, S-LC and C-LC groups were 6008, 5254, 5041 and 4573, respectively. Data on the performance of 114 heifer lactations and 287 cow lactations was available for analysis. There {{were no significant differences in}} the mean intercalving interval, number of days to first observed estrus and number of services per pregnancy for selection versus control line cattle. Also, no difference in reproductive performance was observed between cows on the high concentrate and low concentrate diets, but heifers fed the high concentrate diet had significantly longer intercalving intervals than heifers on the low concentrate diet. Average condition score of cows during the first 26 weeks of lactation was negatively related to number of services per pregnancy and intercalving interval. The degree of body condition score loss in heifers and cows between calving and week 10 of lactation was negatively related to the number of days to first observed estrus.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this trial was to document the total fatty acids in Murrah buffaloes milk on commercial farms in Brazil. Data from forty lactating Murrah-crossbred buffaloes were collected on five commercial farms located at Sarapui and Pilar do Sul, Sao Paulo-Brazil. A field survey was done from April to November 2002. In four farms, buffaloes were fed with wet <b>brewers</b> <b>grains</b> (primary concentrate). Only one farm (Farm 4) offered pasture and corn silage. Monthly milk samples were collected and stored at - 20 ºC until analyzed for fatty acid composition. The fatty acids with the highest percentage in total milk fat were C 16 : 0; C 18 : 1 c 9; C 18 : 0 and C 14 : 0. The average content observed in C 16 : 0 varied from 25. 4 to 32. 5 %. Farm 4 (pasture plus corn silage) showed a higher C 16 : 0 value (32. 5 %). C 18 : 1 c 9 varied from 20. 6 to 25. 1 %, C 14 : 0 varied from 5. 9 to 8. 9 % and CLA content (C 18 : 2 c 9 t 11) varied from 1. 0 to 1. 8 %. Farm 3 presented higher average of C 18 : 1 c 9 (25. 1 %) and C 18 : 2 c 9 t 11 (1. 8 %), and lower average of C 14 : 0 (6. 0 %). Likewise, unsaturated fatty acids, C 18 : 1 c 9 and C 18 : 2 c 9 t 11 were higher on Farm 3. Probably, these results can be due to high CLA intakes derived from wet brewers grain and pasture. Long chain fatty acids varied from 34. 2 % (Farm 4) to 48. 8 % (Farm 3). In general, diets based on pasture and corn silage increased the levels of medium chain fatty acids in Murrah buffaloes milk...|$|E
40|$|A {{supply of}} winter milk is needed by certain milk {{processors}} {{for the production}} of high value dairy products with a short shelf life to balance the high level of commodity based products which are mainly manufactured from seasonal milk produced from spring calving herds. Winter milk is generally produced by suppliers with split calving herds. A proportion of the cows (30 - 50 %) calve in Autumn (September-December) to supply winter milk for which they receive a winter bonus for a contracted supply for the months of October to February. The remainder of the herd calve in Spring (Feb-April) and produce milk mainly off grass for which no bonus is paid. This system evens out the supply of milk throughout the year but complicates management, as it involves running two herds on the farm, with two calving seasons, two breeding seasons and two sets of replacement heifers to be reared. Also there is no break from milking. A system of winter milk production based on calving all of the cows in Autumn would be simpler, as it would involve only one herd, with a break from milking in late Summer and would appeal to many winter milk producers. In this study the feasibility of operating an all Autumn calving herd was examined, in terms of management, calving, winter feeding, reproduction and summer grazing. The herd was located in the Ballyderown farm attached to the Moorepark Research Centre. Alternative winter feeding systems were put in place over a three year period to compare the feed requirements and milk production of each system. A control system based on grass silage as the sole forage was compared with one where grass silage was supplemented with extended grazing of grass in late Autumn and early Spring or with a system based on a mixed forage diet based on grass silage, maize silage, <b>brewers</b> <b>grains</b> or a brewers grains/beet pulp mix. Grass silage and maize silage was produced within each system and the cows on each system were grazed separately within their own farmlets. The overall stocking rate for each system was 2. 7 cows/ha using 350 kg N fertiliser/ha in addition to cattle slurry. Cows were dried off in mid-late July and were grazed tightly until calving down. The calving season extended from early September to early December. Most cows calved down outdoors at pasture or in a calving paddock without assistance. Cows were housed from early November to late March and were allocated to their respective diets in batches according to milk yield, lactation number and calving date. The cows given access to winter grass were given a daily allocation of grass (6 - 8 kg DM/cow) and grazed between morning and evening milking. End of Project Repor...|$|E
40|$|Thirty-four {{lactating}} Friesian cows were {{allocated to}} two groups. At {{the beginning of}} lactation two cows were paired according to parity, weight and date of parturition. One group was randomly allocated to stover-based diet (SBD) and another to grass-based diet (GBD). The basal feeds (stover or grass) were given on ad lib basis. Lucerne and dried <b>brewers</b> <b>grain</b> were fed on group basis in the drylot. Dairy meal was given individually according to milk yield at rate of 500 g/litre after the first 8 litres. Daily intake of Lucerne, <b>brewers</b> <b>grain</b> and the basal feeds were significantly different (P 0. 05) in take of dairy meal was observed between the treatments. Stage of lactation was found to influence daily intake of Lucerne, <b>brewers</b> <b>grain</b> (P 0. 05) between the treatments. SBD cows produced more milk (P 0. 05) between the treatments. Based on the similarities of body weight, body condition score and milk composition between the treatments and the high milk yield by SBD, sorghum stover can thus be used to feed fat cows during lactation. This will stimulate mobilization of body fat. However, since energy intake would limit milk yield in the long run, a high-energy feedstuff such as silage need to be introduced to maintain high milk yield. Too much reliance on body condition as a buffer to overcome nutrition shortcomings, such as the case with stover fed cows, would lead to reduced milk yield in cows with insufficient body reserves...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the supply of wet <b>brewers</b> <b>grain</b> silage with and without nutrient additives in ensiling (wheat bran, soybeans hulls and ground corn), and the effect of additives on the intake and digestibility of dry matter and nutrients as well as the efficiency, production and milk composition of Holstein cows. Four multiparous Holstein cows were used, with an average milk production of 25 liters per day. The cows were randomly assigned, via the Latin Square design (4 x 4), to one of four experimental diets. The experimental period was 21 days. The results obtained in the experiment were evaluated by analysis of variance, Fisher’s F test and Tukey’s test at 5 % probability. The experimental diets consisted of wet <b>brewers</b> <b>grain</b> silage alone, and this silage with the addition of wheat bran, soybean hulls or ground corn. The diets did not affect the initial body weight of the animals. Diets containing wheat bran and ground corn provided a higher intake of dry matter (21. 78 and 21. 50 kg day- 1) and organic matter (20. 42 and 20. 22 kg day- 1) compared to the wet <b>brewers</b> <b>grain</b> silage alone and the diet containing soybean hulls. The results observed for dry matter (636. 96 and 632. 96 g kg- 1), organic matter (659. 16 and 654. 35 g kg- 1 DM), crude protein (712. 84 and 717. 79 g kg- 1 DM) and neutral detergent fiber (598. 99 and 538. 90 g kg- 1 DM) when cows were fed diets containing soybean hulls and ground corn, respectively, were higher than other diets. The different diets did not change daily milk production, milk production corrected for 3. 5 % fat or milk composition. The milk urea nitrogen from cows fed ground corn diets was a lower concentration (17. 67 mg dL- 1), however, it was still above the suitable range (10 to 14 mg dL- 1). Providing wet <b>brewers</b> <b>grain</b> silage with soybeans hulls or ground corn to Holstein cows increased the digestibility of dry matter and nutrients. However, the use of silages with wheat bran, soybean hulls or ground corn did not alter the efficiency, production or milk composition of cows fed with these silages...|$|R

Growth {{performance of}} the earthworms was measured every week. The proximate composition of the earthworm was conducted using standard procedures. The mean weight of the earthworms under the three different treatments was significantly different (P < 0. 05); with earthworms fed <b>brewers</b> dried <b>grain</b> recording the highest mean weight (1. 03 ± 0. 50).

Weight of worms was significantly and positively correlated to feed source (P < 0. 05). The implication of this is that earthworms fed with <b>brewers</b> dried <b>grain</b> gained weight above those fed with coconut husk or the control but the weight gain observed may have been {{as a result of the}} increase in crude fat content of the earthworms since there was no difference in their crude protein content.
