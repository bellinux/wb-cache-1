Abstract. – Feedback from organizational assessments of poor quality can appear specific, meaningful and valid due to psychological factors called <b>Barnum</b> and Forer <b>Effects.</b> These are statements {{that are so}} general or vague that they can apply to many people, and hence, are often rated as highly accurate by individuals. Even assessments with high psychometric quality may provide overly vague feedback or “cookie cutter” statements that are essentially useless. This article will help professionals evaluate their current organizational assessments {{for the presence of}} these shortcomings and to better understand the benefits of specific, actionable and evidence-based feedback that is provided by Item Response Theory (IRT) testing methods. Although organizational surveys and assessments can be important components of Best Practice recruitment and training processes, many executives and human resource professionals avoid using them. Often there are understandable reasons for this, including lack of awareness of suitable instruments, perceived time constraints in completing quality research and cost-to-benefit issues. And then there is outright skepticism abou...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examines}} cross-cultural {{differences in the}} <b>Barnum</b> <b>effect.</b> At Stage 1 of the study, 287 respondents (comprising 149 Westerners and 138 Chinese nationals) provided birth details and completed a belief-in-astrology questionnaire. At Stage 2 a week later, 258 of these (130 Westerners, 128 Chinese) then completed a second belief-in-astrology questionnaire before receiving a Barnum profile supposedly derived from either Western or Chinese astrol-ogy, which they rated for, among other things, perceived accuracy (a) for themselves and (b) for other people in general. Preliminary analysis offered initial support for a universal <b>Barnum</b> <b>effect.</b> However, this disappeared after respondent gender, age, general education, and psychological knowledge were controlled for. Further analyses revealed little support for cross-cultural differences in either astrological beliefs or susceptibility to the <b>Barnum</b> <b>effect,</b> although surprisingly, Chinese nationals who believed in astrology did perceive their own (Barnum) profile to be more accurate for people in general than did Chinese skeptics. Finally, Barnum acceptance was not influenced by the apparent source of profiles.

40|$|It {{is widely}} assumed {{that people have}} direct access to {{knowledge}} about themselves, such as their preferences or propensities to behaviour. However, {{research has shown that}} people often accept bogus feedback about personal characteristics and decisions, even when it completely contradicts information they stated previously. This thesis investigates two examples of such feedback acceptance, the <b>Barnum</b> <b>effect</b> (Meehl, 1956) and choice blindness (Johansson, Hall, Sikström & Olsson, 2005), to explore the conditions required for false feedback to create a false perception of one’s choices. The <b>Barnum</b> <b>effect</b> refers to the tendency to accept false feedback about one’s personal characteristics when it is thoughts to be derived from personality measures. The first paper explores whether undergoing the <b>Barnum</b> <b>effect</b> can influence people’s perception of choices they would make in the future. We find that whilst the <b>Barnum</b> <b>effect</b> does occur, this does not alter people’s self-reported propensity to behaviour. Choice blindness demonstrates that, following a choice, people are often willing to accept the non-selected alternative as the indicated outcome, if this is suggested by feedback. The remaining work presented here investigates which parameters of choice and feedback can determine how likely it is that people will experience choice blindness. The results suggest that people’s susceptibility to choice blindness varies with the number of alternatives presented in the choice task, the framing (positive or negative) of the task itself, and whether the option presented as false feedback was encountered as part of the choice, in a different context, or not encountered at all. I conclude that the effects of false feedback on self-perception are situation dependent, however, difficult to eliminate completely, at least in some domains. The implications are discussed in light of past literature on false feedback effects, as well as related fields such as preferential choice, introspection, error detection and behavioural change...|$|E

The present thesis included two studies related to the <b>Barnum</b> <b>Effect.</b> Study 1 aimed to create a pool of statements (Barnum, Rare Virtues and Common Faults) that varied in their levels of social desirability and endorsement rates. In Study 1, Group A, 120 participants rated 185 items for True of Self or Social Desirability. In Study 1, Group B, 70 participants rated the same items for True of Others or Social Desirability. Contrary to expectation, no statement in the two parts of Study 1 met the criteria of a Rare Virtue item (high social desirability, low endorsement rate), suggesting that Rare Virtue items are difficult if not impossible to create. Ten Barnum items were identified in Study 1, as were 10 Common Fault items (high endorsement rate, with lower social desirability than other statements with similar endorsement rates). In Study 2, Barnum and Common Fault items from Study 1 were used to create and test three types of reports: (1) Barnum, (2) Mixed, (3) Common Fault, that came in Personalized and non-Personalized forms. Participants completed a personality test and were given one generalized personality report. Reports were rated using a 13 -question Satisfaction Survey. Results showed a main effect of type of report (F (2, 169) = 17. 05, p 3 ̆c. 001), with Barnum and Mixed reports receiving significantly higher ratings than the Common Fault report.

From the perspective of the structure of mediumistic readings we will consider the form that a mediumistic exchange takes and evaluate in detail explanations in terms of fraud, cold reading and the <b>Barnum</b> <b>Effect.</b> From the client’s perspective we will consider the effects of coincidence, suggestion, perception / misattribution and selective or distorted recall, as well as possible social and therapeutic functions of sitting with a medium. From the medium’s perspective we will consider the putative role of dissociation and mental health upon the mediumistic experience, and supposed biological bases of mediumship.

In Study 2 subjects estimated that they displayed both positive behaviors and their negatively valenced opposites more frequently than an acquaintance displayed them, indicating that the <b>Barnum</b> <b>effect</b> might be mediated by the greater availability of evidence to confirm traits in the self.

40|$|Empirical thesis. Running title: Gullibility : {{a review}} and a scale. Bibliography: pages 64 - 80. Gullibility : {{a review of}} the {{literature}} [...] Gullibility : devising a self-report measure [...] Discussion. Gullibility refers to a vulnerability to being manipulated. Although almost 300, 000 people in the United States of America in 2014 fell victim to various scams (Federal Bureau of Investigation Internet Crime Complaint Center, 2014), this area is surprisingly under researched. The dissertation begins with {{a review of the}} empirical literature, drawing together findings from research on the <b>Barnum</b> <b>Effect,</b> superstition, social vulnerability, scam compliance, trust, social intelligence, deception detection, and Theory of Mind. The review concludes by arguing that insensitivity to signs of untrustworthiness may be central to understanding the propensity for gullibility. Following the review, two empirical studies describe the development of a self-report measure of gullibility. In Study 1 (N = 371), a pool of items were generated and administered in an anonymous online survey. Demographic items and a measure of social desirability were also administered. An exploratory factor analysis produced a 35 -item scale consisting of four factors labelled Persuadable, Trust, Unassertive, and Unsuspecting, which were not related to social desirability. In Study 2, a confirmatory factor analysis was conducted using a new sample (N = 325). Respondents completed the Gullibility Scale as well as measures of trust, agreeableness, Machiavellianism, and social intelligence. On the basis of the confirmatory factor analysis, the Trust factor was removed, which reduced the measure to a reliable 24 -item scale, consisting of three factors. The Gullibility Scale had a moderate negative correlation with social intelligence and a weak positive correlation with agreeableness. The utility of this new self-report measure of gullibility for research and applied contexts is discussed.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} both the {{development}} of methods for testing practitioners claiming paranormal abilities (i. e. astrologers, psychics and mediums) and the exploration of how they use various linguistic strategies to convince clients that they genuinely possess paranormal abilities. Paranormal claimants have been tested for decades with varying success. The results have provoked acrid debate, mainly focusing on the methodological issues. This thesis reviews the key issues in this debate, describes the formulation of a method of testing that aimed to prevent the many problems that have hindered past research, and how this was then used to test several professional practitioners from the main three paranormal domains. The empirical work examines {{the accuracy of the}} claimants then seeks to understand underlying linguistic causes for participants' acceptance of particular readings. Many researchers from the early 1900 s involved primarily with mediumship were aware of natural psychological explanations for impressive alleged after-death communication. In addition, more recent research has examined the possible linguistic stratagems employed by pseudo-psychics to convince clients of apparent accuracy where there is none. To date this research has primarily focused on the <b>Barnum</b> <b>Effect</b> and taken a more process-oriented stance, manipulating various aspects of Barnum-type statements themselves (e. g. positive vs. negative wording) or the source (e. g. psychologist vs. psychic) to decipher the optimum conditions for acceptance. Little research, however, has examined the actual readings produced by claimants themselves. Taking it's lead from rhetorical psychology, and with a content analytic approach, this thesis examines the rhetoric of paranormal claimants using the actual readings produced in a controlled environment. The results from the accuracy tests did not support the existence of genuine astrological, psychic or mediumistic ability. Competing interpretations of these results are discussed, along with ways in which the methodology presented in the paper could be used to assess conceptually similar, but non-paranormal, contexts...|$|E
40|$|The {{standard}} mainstream {{explanation for}} impressive mediumistic communications is {{in terms of}} cold reading (e. g. Hyman, 2003; Lyons & Truzzi, 1991; Marks & Kamman, 1980; Nickell, 2001, 2010; Randi, 1981; Underdown, 2003). Ray Hyman’s classic account of the technique, describes it as “a procedure by which a ‘reader’ is able to persuade a client whom he has never met before that he knows all about the client’s personality and problems” (Hyman, 1977, p. 20). Unfortunately, this does not give us much insight into the actual process of cold reading, which in practice can vary in form from case to case, from a simple reliance on using statements which are true of most people (e. g. Dutton, 1988; Hyman, 1981) through to a broader definition which includes pre-session information gathering about a client (e. g. Couttie, 1988; Fuller, 1975, 1980; Keene, 1976). There are also clear indications that the cold reading ‘process’ actually consists of a number of discrete and independent strategies (including inter alia fishing, Barnum reading, and hot reading), as one of us has outlined (Roe, 1991) but this {{does not seem to be}} generally appreciated (e. g. Schwartz, 1978; see Rowland, 2001, for a more sophisticated treatment). In this chapter we will review some of the sceptical accounts that have invoked explanations in terms of cold reading before giving a detailed account of the various techniques involved, drawing in particular on an extensive but generally unknown pseudopsychic literature (e. g. Cain, 1991; Earle, 1990; Hobrin, 1990; Jones, 1989). This will focus on identifying the necessary conditions for the techniques to be practised and describing the nature of the information that can be produced by such methods. We will also briefly consider the empirical evidence that bears on the assumptions underlying pseudopsychic techniques — such as that clients are susceptible to the <b>Barnum</b> <b>effect</b> (cf. Roe, 19965), are likely to selectively forget inaccurate information and distort recalled information such that it is more personally relevant (cf. Roe, 1994), and that clients remain oblivious to the fishing and feedback stages that are characteristic of cold reading...|$|E
