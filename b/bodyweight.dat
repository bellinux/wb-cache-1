5|$|Just before migration, the ruff {{increases}} {{its body}} mass {{at a rate}} of about 1% a day, much slower than the bar-tailed godwits breeding in Alaska, which fatten at four times that rate.

40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the journal, Human Movement Science [© Elsevier] and the definitive version is available at: [URL] elite gymnasts perform the straight arm backward longswing on rings during their competition routines in order to satisfy specific judging requirements. Measured peak combined cable tension during a backward longswing is typically in excess of 9 <b>bodyweights</b> and forces of this magnitude have been associated with an increased risk of injury to gymnasts' shoulders. This study investigated the contribution of longswing technique and the elasticity of the gymnast and rings apparatus to minimising loading at the shoulders. A three-dimensional video and cable tension analysis was conducted on a backward longswing performed by an elite gymnast. This analysis provided information regarding the motion of the rings cables, the gymnast's technique and the elasticity of the rings apparatus. A three-dimensional five-segment computer simulation model of a gymnast swinging on rings was developed. The inertial characteristics for the model were determined from anthropometric measurements of the gymnast and measurements taken directly from the rings apparatus. The simulation model was evaluated by comparing the backward longswing from the data collection with a simulation of the same performance. The root mean squared (rms) differences between the actual performance of the longswing and the simulation for cable tension, orientations of the gymnast and rings cables and the wrist to ankle length of the gymnast were 297 N, 3. 3 °, 1. 1 ° and 0. 06 m, respectively. During the simulated longswing the peak combined force at the shoulders was 8. 5 <b>bodyweights.</b> Modifications to the evaluated simulation of the longswing were used to determine the effect of the gymnast's technique, his elasticity and that of the rings apparatus on peak shoulder force. Altering the gymnast's technique, by fixing the gymnast in a straight body configuration throughout the swing, increased the peak shoulder force by 2. 56 <b>bodyweights.</b> Removing only the lateral arm movements, which form part of the gymnast's technique, also resulted in an increased peak shoulder force (0. 73 <b>bodyweights).</b> Removing only the elasticity of the apparatus or gymnast from the evaluated simulation resulted in smaller increases in peak shoulder force (0. 62 <b>bodyweights</b> and 0. 53 <b>bodyweights).</b> Although the elasticity of the gymnast and apparatus contribute to minimising peak shoulder force, this study shows that the contribution of a gymnast's technique is considerably greater...|$|R

5|$|The {{barn owl}} hunts by flying slowly, {{quartering}} {{the ground and}} hovering over spots that may conceal prey. It may also use branches, fence posts or other lookouts to scan its surroundings, {{and this is the}} main means of prey location in the oil palm plantations of Malaysia. The bird has long, broad wings, enabling it to manoeuvre and turn abruptly. Its legs and toes are long and slender which improves its ability to forage among dense foliage or beneath the snow and gives it a wide spread of talons when attacking prey. Studies have shown that an individual barn owl may eat one or more voles (or their equivalent) per night, equivalent to about twenty-three percent of the bird's <b>bodyweight.</b> Excess food is often cached at roosting sites and can be used when food is scarce.|$|E

5|$|Crocodilian {{teeth are}} adapted for seizing and holding prey, and food is {{swallowed}} unchewed. The digestive tract is relatively short, as meat {{is a fairly}} simple substance to digest.

The stomach is more acidic than that of any other vertebrate and contains ridges for gastroliths, which {{play a role in the}} mechanical breakdown of food. Digestion takes place more quickly at higher temperatures. Crocodilians have a very low metabolic rate and consequently, low energy requirements. This allows them to survive for many months on a single large meal, digesting the food slowly. They can withstand extended fasting, living on stored fat between meals. Even recently hatched crocodiles are able to survive 58 days without food, losing 23% of their <b>bodyweight</b> during this time.

40|$|Purpose: To {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that in dark-adapted diabetic mice subnormal manganese uptake in the outer retina can be ameliorated with exogenous 11 -cis-retinal intervention. Methods: Three groups were studied: age-matched controls and mice that had been diabetic for 3 months with and without acute, systemic 11 -cis-retinal treatment administered 30 min before the manganese injection. Mice in each group were examined with manganese-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MEMRI) to assess central intraretinal manganese uptake and extraocular muscle manganese uptake. <b>Bodyweights</b> and glycated hemoglobin were determined. Results: Both diabetic groups had lower <b>bodyweights</b> and higher glycated hemoglobin levels relative to controls; no differences in these parameters between diabetic groups were noted. No substantial differences in muscle uptake were noted between any of the groups. Diabetes produced a subnormal intraretinal uptake of manganese; acute exogenous 11 cis-retinal significantly corrected only outer retinal uptake, although not to control levels.

5|$|The {{toxic dose}} of {{paracetamol}} is highly variable. In general the recommended maximum daily dose for healthy adults is 4grams. Higher doses lead to increasing risk of toxicity. In adults, single doses above 10grams or 200mg/kg of <b>bodyweight,</b> whichever is lower, {{have a reasonable}} likelihood of causing toxicity. Toxicity can also occur when multiple smaller doses within 24hours exceed these levels. Following a normal dose of 1gram of paracetamol {{four times a day}} for two weeks, patients can expect an increase in alanine transaminase in their liver to typically about three times the normal value. It is unlikely that this dose would lead to liver failure. Studies have shown significant hepatotoxicity is uncommon in patients who have taken greater than normal doses over 3 to 4 days. In adults, a dose of 6grams a day over the preceding 48hours could potentially lead to toxicity, while in children acute doses above 200mg/kg could potentially cause toxicity. Acute paracetamol overdose in children rarely causes illness or death, and it is very uncommon for children to have levels that require treatment, with chronic larger-than-normal doses being the major cause of toxicity in children.|$|E

40|$|Flying {{squirrels}} {{are well}} known {{for their ability to}} glide between trees {{at the top of a}} forest canopy. We present experimental performance and behavioural evidence that flight in flying squirrels may have evolved out of a need to control landing forces. Northern flying squirrels were filmed jumping from a horizontal branch to a much larger vertical pole. These were both slightly compliant (less than 1. 9 mm N- 1), and instrumented using strain gauges so that forces could be measured. Take-off and landing forces were both positively correlated with horizontal range between 0. 5 and 2. 5 m (r= 0. 355 and r= 0. 811, respectively, P < 0. 05), but not significantly different to each other at each range tested. Take-off forces ranged from 1 to 10 <b>bodyweights,</b> and landing forces were between 3 and 10 <b>bodyweights.</b> Glide angles increased rapidly with horizontal range, approaching 45 degrees at 3 m, above which they gradually decreased, suggesting that northern flying squirrels are optimised for long distance travel. We show that northern flying squirrels initiate full gliding posture at ranges of less than 1 m, without landing any higher than an equivalent ballistic projectile. However, this gliding posture enables them to pitch upwards, potentially stalling the wing, and spreads the landing reaction force over all four extended limbs. At steeper approach angles of close to 45 degrees, flying squirrels were unable to pitch up sufficiently and landed forelimbs first, consequently sustaining higher impact forces. We investigate four hypotheses to explain the origin of flight in these animals and conclude that the need to reduce landing impact forces was most likely to have stimulated the development of aerial control in flying squirrels...|$|R

40|$|CO 2 as a {{stressor}} {{has been}} used in earlier studies with chicken embryos. De Smit et al. (2008) stated that higher CO 2 levels might even have beneficial effects in preventing ascites-syndrome in ascites-sensitive broilers. For a better understanding about the mechanisms triggered by CO 2 two broiler-strains (Ross and Isa), differing in ascites-susceptibility, were compared to each other. The presented results show which influence higher CO 2 -levels in combination with normoxia or hypoxia and a higher relative humidity in the first ten days of incubation have on embryonic fluids (blood and amniotic fluid). We determined exclusive gas parameters (pH, pO 2, pCO 2, HCO 3 -,Hb, Hkt), electrolyte contents (K+, Na+, Ca 2 +, Cl-) and metabolites (glucose, lactate) in blood and amniotic fluid and morphological parameters (heart- and <b>bodyweights).</b> Significant differences between the two strains in the gas parameters were achieved by NV (higher amounts of CO 2 and a higher relative humidity) until D 10. Ross showed lower pH- and pO 2 -levels in blood as well as significant higher pCO 2 - and HCO 3 [...] concentrations in blood and amniotic fluid than Isa. However an appropriate oxygen supply in Ross was accomplished by higher amounts of Hb and Hkt compared with Isa. NV stimulated Ross’s metabolism. Thus the carbonic acid- bicarbonate- buffer system has already been trained prenatal (higher HCO 3 [...] level). Due to the embryonic training the efficiency of the buffer system can be improved in the adult animal. Moreover the gas parameters showed a close relation to the embryos´ age. The different, age dependent concentrations between the compartments (blood and amniotic fluid) were maintained by the blood-amnion-barrier. The electrolyte concentrations also showed {{significant differences between the two}} strains. NV-Ross showed higher amounts of Na+ and K+ compared to the control group. Isa on the other hand did not reveal any differences between NV- and control group. It is assumed that NV conditions Ross’s hormone system which regulates water movement and excretion. So the positive effect to ascites-susceptibility can be explained. NV-Ross showed higher Ca 2 + concentrations in blood than NV-Isa. This is due to eggshell resorption for generating HCO 3 - in order to buffer the lower pH in blood of NV-Ross. NV led to higher correlations in Na+ and Cl- between blood and amniotic fluid. This confirms the cooperation of these two compartments. The amniotic fluid serves as a reservoir for blood. By the examination of the metabolites it stood out that NV led to differences between the two strains. NV-Ross showed lower glucose levels in blood than Isa. Hypoglycaemia develops due to Ross’s higher metabolism and the higher demand for glucose. Lactate did not show any differences. Even the morphological parameters demonstrated differences between the two strains under NV. The heart- and <b>bodyweights,</b> shown by NV-Ross, were higher than the ones shown by NV-Isa. NV accelerates Ross’s metabolism and this explains the higher <b>bodyweights.</b> The disproportions between the body- and heartweights were more advanced in Ross than in Isa. With increasing of age the growth of the heart declines proportionally to the growth of the body. Structural, histological changes in the heart, which improve the efficiency of the cardiovascular system, are imaginable. The exchanging mechanisms in the blood-amnion-barrier were also influenced by NV (higher correlation). The increased metabolism due to NV explains the earlier hatch, described by De Smit et al. (2008), and the higher <b>bodyweights</b> and disproportions. Altogether NV (increasing CO 2 levels, hypoxia and a higher relative humidity) until D 10 influenced the tested parameter strongly. Thereby significant differences between the two strains and differences due to age were seen. Ross reacted more sensitive to NV than Isa (lower pH- and pO 2 -data resp. higher pCO 2 concentrations). Ross’s metabolism was enhanced. Due to NV the buffer system and the hormones, which are responsible for water regulation in the egg, were influenced and stamped prenatal (higher HCO 3 [...] , Ca 2 +- and K+- resp. Na+ -data). This could lead to a more sufficient buffer- resp. hormone system postnatal and the susceptibility for ascites-syndrome could be lowered...|$|R
