40|$|The world {{pulp and}} paper {{industry}} continues to expand production and increasingly, plants are being built in newly industrialised countries. The dominant process is the kraft or sulphate process. Historically, substantial pollution problems have been associated with pulp manufacturing operations. Following the recognition of large scale environmental contamination by organochlorines due to their formation in bleach plants, the industry implemented a number of process internal changes and continued to develop process external treatment processes. The <b>bleach</b> plant of <b>kraft</b> mills generates a substantial proportion of the total process effluents. The introduction of extended delignification and oxygen delignification can substantially reduce the quantities of lignin entering the bleach plant. Residues from oxygen delignification can be cycled to the recovery process. Overall, this reduces the demand for bleaching agents and hence reduces the generation of organochlorines. Together with substitution of elemental chlorine (Cl 2) with chlorine dioxide, these systems have substantially reduced levels of AOX being discharged from <b>bleach</b> <b>kraft</b> mills. Organochlorines, however, have not been eliminated from discharges, merely reduced. Swedish research has shown detectable levels of toxicologically chlorinated dioxins and dibenzofurans in the effluents from mills that use chlorine dioxide; so-called elemental chlorine free (ECF) mills. This {{stems from the fact that}} ECF processes are not free of elemental chlorine. Commercial chlorine dioxid...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{work has}} shown that Trametes (Coriolus) versicolor <b>bleaches</b> <b>kraft</b> pulp brownstock with the {{concomitant}} release of methanol. In this work, the fungus is shown to produce both laccase and manganese peroxidase (MnP) but not lignin peroxidase during pulp bleaching. MnP production was enhanced {{by the presence of}} pulp and/or Mn(II) ions. The maximum level of secreted MnP was coincident with the maximum rate of fungal bleaching. Culture filtrates isolated from bleaching cultures produced Mn(II) - and hydrogen peroxide-dependent pulp demethylation and delignification. Laccase and MnP were separated by ion-exchange chromatography. Purified MnP alone produced most of the demethylation and delignification exhibited by the culture filtrates. On the basis of the methanol released and the total and phenolic methoxyl contents of the pulp, it appears that MnP shows a preference for the oxidation of phenolic lignin substructures. The extensive increase in brightness observed in the fungus-treated pulp was not found with MnP alone. Therefore, either the MnP effect must be optimized or other enzymes or compounds from the fungus are also required for brightening...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{behaviour}} {{of different}} cellulosic fibres during acid hydrolysis {{has been investigated}} and the levelling-off degree of polymerisation (LODP) has been determined. The study included a <b>bleached</b> <b>kraft</b> pulp (both never-dried and once-dried) and two dissolving pulps (once-dried). Additionally, cotton cellulose from new cotton sheets and sheets discarded after long-time use was studied. Experimental results from the investigation, together with results found in literature, imply that ultrastructural differences between different fibres affect their susceptibility towards acid hydrolysis. Drying of a <b>bleached</b> <b>kraft</b> pulp was found to enhance the rate of acid hydrolysis and also result in a decrease in LODP. This implies that the susceptibility of cellulosic fibres towards acid hydrolysis is affected by drying-induced stresses in the cellulose chains.

The carboxylate content of nanocrystals made from BPFs, SPFs, and CPFs were 2. 10, 2. 02, and 1. 66 mmol/g, respectively. Nanocrystals of BPFs and SPFs had widths of 5 to 15 nm and lengths of 400 to 800 nm. The length and width of CPFs nanocrystals were 200 to 400 nm and 15 to 25 nm. The oxidizing rates of BPFs, SPFs, and CPFs were different. These differences {{could be attributed to}} crystallinity. Crystallinity affected microstructures, chemical process, and the efficiency of ultrasonication. Crystallinity also shaped the nanocrystals, since nanocrystals consist of the residual crystalline regions after chemical oxidation and ultrasonication. Fibers of lower crystallinity (such as bamboo) showed a higher reactivity, and the nanocrystals made from low crystallinity materials were longer, thinner, more rapidly formed, and required less energy in their preparation...|$|E
