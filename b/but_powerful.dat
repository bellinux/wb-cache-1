5|$|In 1267, Gilbert de Clare, {{who held}} the Lordship of Glamorgan, seized the lands around the town of Senghenydd {{in the north of}} Glamorgan from their native Welsh ruler. Caerphilly Castle was built to control the new {{territory}} and Castell Coch—strategically located between Cardiff and Caerphilly—was reoccupied. A new castle was built in stone around the motte, comprising a shell-wall, a projecting circular tower, a gatehouse and a square hall above an undercroft. The north-west section of the walls was protected by a talus and the sides of the motte were scarped to increase their angle, all producing a small <b>but</b> <b>powerful</b> fortification. Further work followed between 1268 and 1277, which added two large towers, a turning-bridge for the gatehouse and further protection to the north-west walls.|$|E

5|$|The 1996 Andhra Pradesh cyclone (also {{known as}} Cyclone 07B), {{was a small}} <b>but</b> <b>powerful</b> storm that left heavy damage in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. It formed on November4 in the eastern Bay of Bengal. Moving westward, it quickly {{organized}} and developed a well-defined eye. On November6, the cyclone struck about 50km (30mi) south of Kakinada, Andhra Pradesh at peak intensity. The India Meteorological Department estimated peak winds of 145km/h (90mph), while the American-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) assessed peak winds of 215km/h (130mph). Soon after landfall, the cyclone weakened and dissipated by November7.|$|E
5|$|The Aurora {{arrived at}} Cape Denison on 13 January 1913. When Mawson's party failed to return, Davis sailed her east {{along the coast}} {{as far as the}} Mertz Glacier tongue, searching for the party. Finding no sign and {{reaching}} the end of the navigable ice-free water, they returned to Cape Denison. The oncoming winter concerned Davis, and on 8 February—just hours before Mawson's return to the hut—the ship departed Commonwealth Bay, leaving six men behind as a relief party. Upon Mawson's return, the Aurora was recalled by wireless radio, <b>but</b> <b>powerful</b> katabatic winds sweeping down from the plateau prevented the ship's boat from reaching the shore to collect the men.|$|E
5|$|The {{tiger shark}} {{is a member}} of the order Carcharhiniformes, the most species-rich order of sharks, with more than 270 species also {{including}} the small catsharks and hammerhead sharks. Members of this order are characterized by the presence of a nictitating membrane over the eyes, two dorsal fins, an anal fin, and five gill slits. It is the largest member of the Carcharhinidae family, commonly referred to as requiem sharks. This family consists of mostly slender <b>but</b> <b>powerful</b> mid- to large-sized sharks and includes some other well-known sharks, such as the blue shark (Prionace glauca), lemon shark (Negaprion brevirostris), and bull shark (Carcharhinus leucas).|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 15th century, England was a {{relatively}} insignificant state {{on the periphery of}} Europe. The great victories against France in the Hundred Years' War were in the past; only the small enclave of Calais in northern France remained of the vast continental holdings of the English kings. The War of the Roses—the civil war between the houses of York and Lancaster—had ended with HenryVII's establishment of the House of Tudor, the new ruling dynasty of England. The ambitious naval policies of HenryV were not continued by his successors, and from 1422 to 1509 only six ships were built for the crown. The marriage alliance between Anne of Brittany and CharlesVIII of France in 1491, and his successor LouisXII in 1499, left England with a weakened strategic position on its southern flank. Despite this, HenryVII managed to maintain a comparatively long period of peace and a small <b>but</b> <b>powerful</b> core of a navy.|$|E
5|$|Typhoon Gay, {{also known}} as the Kavali Cyclone of 1989, was a small <b>but</b> <b>powerful</b> {{tropical}} cyclone that caused more than 800fatalities in and around the Gulf of Thailand in November 1989. The worst typhoon to affect the Malay Peninsula in 35years, Gay originated from a monsoon trough over the Gulf of Thailand in early-November. Owing to favorable atmospheric conditions, the storm rapidly intensified, attaining winds of more than 120km/h (75mph) by 3 November. Later that day, Gay became the first typhoon since 1891 to make landfall in Thailand, striking Chumphon Province with winds of 185km/h (115mph). The small storm emerged into the Bay of Bengal and gradually reorganized over the following days as it approached southeastern India. On 8 November, Gay attained its peak intensity as a Category5–equivalent cyclone with winds of 260km/h (160mph). The typhoon then moved ashore near Kavali, Andhra Pradesh. Rapid weakening ensued inland, and Gay dissipated over Maharashtra early on 10 November.|$|E
5|$|Marge and {{the kids}} wake up to find {{themselves}} back in Springfield, now in ruins (except Springfield Elementary School, much to Bart's chagrin). They find Moe Szyslak, who {{is dressed in a}} bathrobe, a traffic cone and bullets and has become self-proclaimed Emperor of Springfield (although his leadership was unsuccessfully challenged by Barney). Just then, Russ Cargill reappears on the giant screen, and announces to the people of Springfield that placing the dome over Springfield was a mistake, and the government has commenced Operation: Soaring Eagle, an ill-named plan which involves killing them all. A helicopter lowers a small <b>but</b> <b>powerful</b> bomb down a rope {{through a hole in the}} dome. While Homer climbs to the top of the dome, the townspeople attempt to climb the rope to escape through the still-opened hole, but Homer slides down the rope and knocks them off along with the bomb. After reconciling with Bart, Homer drives a motorcycle along the dome, inspired by the earlier carnival attraction. As a passenger of the motorcycle, Bart throws the bomb through the hole; seconds later it detonates, shattering the dome and freeing the town. Cargill arrives personally and prepares to shoot Homer with a shotgun, but Maggie knocks him unconscious with a boulder. The town finally praises and forgives Homer, who rides into the sun rise with Marge and Maggie, whereupon the townspeople restore Springfield to normal. As a symbol of their gratitude, the Simpsons and their friends begin to rebuild the family's house.|$|E
