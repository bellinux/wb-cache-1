50|$|The {{typically}} recommended {{operating temperature}} of the first catalyst stage is 315 °C to 330 °C (bottom <b>bed</b> <b>temperature).</b> The high temperature {{in the first stage}} also helps to hydrolyze COS and CS2, which is formed in the furnace and would not otherwise be converted in the modified Claus process.|$|E
50|$|The first {{process step}} in the {{catalytic}} stage is the gas heating process. It is necessary to prevent sulfur condensation in the catalyst bed, {{which can lead to}} catalyst fouling. The required bed operating temperature in the individual catalytic stages is achieved by heating the process gas in a reheater until the desired operating <b>bed</b> <b>temperature</b> is reached.|$|E

40|$|A gas {{analyzer}} utilizing a nondispersive infrared (NDIR) detection system {{was used to}} monitor the ammonia and water vapor content of the products of a previously unused hydrazine gas generator.

The analyzer was easily installed in both the calibration and hydrazine systems, required no maintenance other than periodic zero adjustments, and performed well for extended periods in the operating range tested. The catalyst bed operated smoothly and repeatably during the 28 hr of testing. No major transients were observed on startup or during steady state operation.

50|$|Calcium looping {{technology}} offers several technical advantages over amine scrubbing for carbon capture. Firstly, both carbonator and calciner can use fluidized bed technology, {{due to the}} good gas-solid contacting and uniform <b>bed</b> <b>temperature.</b> Fluidized bed technology has already been demonstrated at large scale: large (460MWe) atmospheric and pressurized systems exist, {{and there is not}} a need for intensive scaling up as there is for the solvent scrubbing towers used in amine scrubbing.|$|E

40|$|This {{article is}} {{concerned}} with a study of an unusual effect due to density of biomass pellets in modern stoves based on close-coupled gasification-combustion process. The two processes, namely, flaming with volatiles and glowing of the char show different effects. The mass flux of the fuel bears a constant ratio with the air flow rate of gasification during the flaming process and is independent of particle density; char glowing process shows a distinct effect of density. The <b>bed</b> <b>temperatures</b> also have similar features: during flaming, they are identical, but distinct in the char burn (gasification) regime. For the cases, wood char and pellet char, the densities are 350, 990 kg/m(3), and the burn rates are 2. 5 and 3. 5 g/min with the <b>bed</b> <b>temperatures</b> being 1380 and 1502 K, respectively. A number of experiments on practical stoves showed wood char combustion rates of 2. 5 +/- 0. 5 g/min and pellet char burn rates of 3. 5 +/- 0. 5 g/min. In pursuit of {{the resolution of the}} differences, experimental data on single particle combustion for forced convection and ambient temperatures effects have been obtained. Single particle char combustion rate with air show a near-d(2) law and surface and core temperatures are identical for both wood and pellet char. A model based on diffusion controlled heat release-radiation-convection balance is set up. Explanation of the observed results needs to include the ash build-up over the char. This model is then used to explain observed behavior in the packed bed; the different packing densities of the biomass chars leading to different heat release rates per unit bed volume are deduced as the cause of the differences in burn rate and <b>bed</b> <b>temperatures...</b>|$|R

40|$|Chemical {{fractionation}} and SEM-EDX {{was used}} for characterisation of ashes and deposits from different combustion tests in a commercial 20 MW bubbling fluidized bed (BFB) boiler. The fuel combusted was a mix of sorted MSW (Municipal Solid Waste) and industrial waste {{often referred to as}} RDF (Refuse Derived Fuel) mostly containing combustible material as paper, plastics and wood. This fuel type often contains a lot of alkali and chlorine and is therefore considered as a risk fuel prone to cause bed agglomeration, deposit formation and corrosion. In order to investigate the impact of the <b>bed</b> <b>temperature</b> on the alkali and chlorine distribution in the boiler combustion tests were performed. The <b>bed</b> <b>temperature</b> for this boiler is designed to be in the range 850 - 900 °C. In this investigation however the <b>bed</b> <b>temperature</b> was reduced to 700 - 750 °C.
