500|$|The {{external}} appearance of Holkham {{can best be}} described as a huge Roman palace. However, as with most architectural designs, it is never quite that simple. Holkham is a Palladian house, and yet even by Palladian standards the {{external appearance}} is austere and devoid of ornamentation. This can almost certainly be traced to Coke himself. The on-site, supervising architect, Matthew Brettingham, related that Coke required and demanded [...] "commodiousness", which can be interpreted as comfort. Hence rooms that were adequately lit by one window, had only one, as a second might have improved the external appearance but could have made a room cold or draughty. As a result, the few windows on the piano nobile, although symmetrically placed and balanced, appear lost in a sea of brickwork; albeit these yellow bricks were cast as exact replicas of ancient Roman bricks expressly for Holkham. Above the windows of the piano nobile, where on a true Palladian structure the windows of a mezzanine would be, there is nothing. The reason for this is the double height of the state rooms on the piano nobile; however, not even a <b>blind</b> <b>window,</b> such as those often seen in Palladio's own work, is permitted to alleviate the severity of the facade. On the ground floor, the rusticated walls are pierced by small windows more reminiscent of a prison than a grand house. One architectural commentator, Nigel Nicolson, has described the house as appearing as functional as a Prussian riding school.|$|E

50|$|The chapel is {{constructed}} in Flemish bond brick. Its gabled facade is {{topped by a}} 19th-century bellcote with a single bell. A pair of panelled doors in moulded surrounds with flat hoods is separated by a Venetian style window with leaded glass. There is a similar window immediately above it and above that a roundel panel bearing the date. The side elevations have three bays, the centre bay is set slightly forward, all with round-headed windows. The rear has a gable pediment in brick relief and a <b>blind</b> <b>window.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{church is}} built in stone from Storeton quarry, {{and is in}} Neoclassical style. On the {{entrance}} front is a Doric portico consisting of four fluted columns without bases, carrying an entablature with a triglyph frieze and a pediment. Flanking the portico are windows with architraves and pediments. There are six similar windows along {{each side of the}} church, and running round the church above them is a panelled parapet. At the rear, the narrower chancel projects under a pediment. On its rear wall is a <b>blind</b> <b>window</b> with four pilasters and an entablature with wreathes.|$|E

50|$|The {{church is}} {{predominantly}} Baroque in style. Its first level is {{devoid of any}} embellishment or fenestration save for the main semicircular arched portal and the wave-like cornices and rounded, high-relief pilasters. A similar motif has been adapted on the second level of the façade, which is pierced by three windows. The center of the softly undulating pediment showcases one <b>blind</b> <b>window</b> encased by pilasters. The curved pediment ends smoothly into two large volutes which seat beside two, large, urn-like finials. The pediment is surmounted by a huge, knob-like finial. To {{the right of the}} façade stands the four-tiered bell tower with its rectangular base and octagonal upper levels.|$|E
5000|$|The presbytery {{appears from}} the road to be a [...] "standard two-bay house". [...] It has two storeys. Over all the windows are wedge lintels. The two windows in {{the ground floor of}} the {{entrance}} front are sashes with glazing bars; the two windows above them are casements. Between the windows on the ground floor is a doorway containing a six-panel door with flat pilasters and an open pediment, over which is a fanlight. Between the windows on the upper floor is a <b>blind</b> <b>window.</b> On the right (north) side are two windows, one on each floor, and a round-headed stair window at an intermediate level. On each side of the presbytery is a gable surmounted by a chimney stack.|$|E

Afraid, Hokart begins to leave; Chief mistakes his abrupt movements for an intention to attack the kiva and plunges {{through the window and}} into a far invisible distance through to somewhere else. Erik begins to consider the legends and beliefs of the Hopi: they say their people originally came from the Third World, which was evil, and so they climbed up into a kiva in this, the Fourth World, to escape it; the obvious speculation is that a malign power of the Third World was sealed by the burial of the kiva and that it wants the window to this world opened back up.|$|E

[...] The chapel was decorated by Brother Francis C. Schroen, S.J., (1857-1924), who had previously been a designer at the Jesuit Georgetown University. The stained glass was by Louis C. Tiffany and above Schroen's white marble altar was a canopied statue of Our Lady of Lourdes by the New York-sculptor Joseph Sibbel.|$|E
5000|$|The {{church is}} made of stone, with the {{exception}} of the western facade which was destroyed in 1915 and rebuilt in brick. At the northern wall there is an annex, built in the second half of the 17th century, with a sacristy. In the anteroom, there is a characteristic portal and the door inside is adorned with a 15th-century rosette.Above the portal, there is a low relief commemorating King Casimir III and Jan Bodzanta, Bishop of Kraków. It was funded in 1464, on the initiative of Jan Długosz, who in mid-15th century was a canon in Wiślica. The Northern portal was built in the second half of the 14th century, with several eagles and coats of arms of Polish provinces. Nearby, there is a <b>blind</b> <b>window,</b> out of which, according to a legend, the Wiślica Statutes were announced in 1347. The vault in the nave is partly ribbed, supported with three pillars. In several places on the vault there are coats of arms of parts of the Kingdom of Poland during the reign of Casimir III: Greater Poland, Ruthenia, Land of Sieradz, Land of Leczyca, and Dobrzyń Land. There are also Evangelist symbols and the head of Jesus. In the presbytery, there are the remains of several post-Byzantine wall paintings, made by Master Hail, an Orthodox painter from Przemyśl between 1397 and 1400.|$|E

50|$|In {{the recent}} years, Reza Moradi Ghiasabadi has {{presented}} a new {{interpretation of the}} structure by doing field research and considers it an observatory and a solar calendar and believes that the <b>blind</b> <b>windows,</b> the stairs opposite the entrance door and the construct have been a timer or a solar index for measuring {{the rotation of the}} sun and subsequently keeping the record of the year and counting the years and extracting calendars and detecting the first days of each solar month and summer and winter solstices and spring and fall equinoxes. He concludes that the beginning of each solar month could be detected by observing the shadows formed on the <b>blind</b> <b>windows.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the present work {{was to develop a}} simplified model to predict the heat transfer, both radiative and convective, in complex fenestration systems, including the effect of solar radiation. The systems of interest include windows with horizontal or vertical louvered blinds, roller blinds or curtains. However, the focus of the current work is on horizontal louvered blinds and roller blinds mounted adjacent to the indoor glazing surface. In this paper, empirical correlations for free convection in an asymmetrically heated channel (Roeleveld, 2007) are used to develop a simplified one-dimensional model of the heat transfer at an indoor glazing adjacent to a louvered blind. In this model, an energy balance is performed at the blind surface, using a mean blind temperature. The radiative heat exchange between the <b>blind,</b> <b>window</b> and room is calculated using a four surface grey-diffuse model, which is coupled to the convective heat transfer. The simplified model has been developed using experimental and numerical data (Collins, 2001 and Machin et al., 1998). Sample results are presented that illustrate the effect of blind slat angle, blind-to-window spacing, and absorbed solar heat flux on the heat transfer at the window surface...|$|E
50|$|A <b>window</b> <b>blind</b> {{is a type}} {{of window}} covering. There are many {{different}} kinds of <b>window</b> <b>blinds</b> which use a variety of control systems. A typical <b>window</b> <b>blind</b> is made up of several long horizontal or vertical slats of various types of hard material, including wood, plastic or metal which are held together by cords that run through the <b>blind</b> slats. <b>Window</b> <b>blinds</b> can be maneuvered with either a manual or remote control by rotating them from an open position, with slats spaced out, to a closed position where slats overlap and block out most of the light. There are also several types of window coverings, called shades, that use a single piece of soft material instead of slats.|$|R

25|$|This enigmatic {{structure}} stands erect around 12.5 meters tall (~ 35 feet), with a linear, cubical {{shape and}} a square base (~ 22 feet in sides), constructed {{in what is}} essentially a dug out rectangular depression, having on {{all but one of}} its sides, four rectangular depressions resembling <b>blind</b> <b>windows,</b> and multiple minute rectangular depressions in the façade interdispersed among the <b>blind</b> <b>windows</b> as well as the side housing the staircase. The staircase leads to a small door (5 feet by 6 feet in dimensions) opening to an interior apartment of about 12 feet square. The structure's roof houses a minimal entablature of a repeating square pattern. The entire structure is posited on a raised stone platform that is composed of a few stone slabs, in a sequentially smaller yet in a concentric, pyramidally shaped succession. This structure is enigmatic, both in its aesthetic choice seen in its rather odd design, and façade, as well as its location, and supposed function.|$|R
