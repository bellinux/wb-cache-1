40|$|The heating {{phenomenon}} produces by {{hot weather}} caused the car’s compartment {{to gain the}} heat from the surrounding and the sunlight radiation, while inside the compartment will have a higher temperature compared to the outside surroundings. The high heat trapped in the enclose compartment will bring uncomfortable and suffocation feel for the driver and passengers when they enter the parked car at the open parking areas. This occurs due to the process of heat transfer from the external environment to the interior of the car. Higher air condition power is necessary to cope with this situation. However, it only functions when the engine is running. Therefore, this research intended to invent a ventilation system and use the application of solar energy as the power source during the engine is not operating. The aim of this system is to eliminate and mitigate the effects of heat in the car when parked. This research also is to determine the temperature increment inside the car compartment under direct sunlight. The heat analysis was done to determine the total heat flux produced in the parked car compartment. The value then are used to determine the flow rate, cubit feet per minutes (CFM) that needed by the ventilation fan and used to determine the sizing of the solar panel and the battery capacity. Result from this study shows that this system manages to reduce temperature inside the car compartment from 49. 6 °C less to 41. 3 °C with 53 % of the effectiveness. As a conclusion, the model of the ventilation system is successfully built with the AC <b>blowing</b> <b>fan</b> and a set of electronic circuit board to control the motor level of the blower speed and powered by the solar energy. The bigger area of solar power source produces a high of electricity to generate power to ensure the system can operate with high efficiency...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to examine the characteristics of sawdust and cocopeat bedding materials, including physicochemical properties (Exp. I) and on-farm trial (Exp. II). In Exp. I, the proportion of particle size was in the order of sawdust> cocopeat India>cocopeat Vietnam (p cocopeat Vietnam>sawdust (p< 0. 05), thus cocopeat treatments showed 4. 4 times higher bedding cost than sawdust. The water absorption rates were 702. 0 % in cocopeat India, 678. 3 % in cocopeat Vietnam, and 444. 0 % in sawdust, showing cocopeat had approximately 1. 5 times higher water absorption rate than sawdust. Moisture evaporation rates after 12 h of air blowing (2. 00 m/s) were higher (p< 0. 05) in cocopeat Vietnam (80. 4 %) than sawdust (71. 2 %) and cocopeat India (72. 8 %). In vitro ammonia emissions were higher (p< 0. 05) in sawdust (2. 71 mg/m 2 /h) than cocopeat India (1. 59 mg/m 2 /h) and Vietnam (1. 22 mg/m 2 /h), and total ammonia emissions were higher (p< 0. 05) in sawdust (37. 02 mg/m 2) than cocopeat India (22. 51 mg/m 2) and Vietnam (13. 60 mg/m 2). In Exp. II, an on-farm trial was conducted with 48 Hanwoo cattle in 16 pens using the same bedding materials as in Exp. I, with fan (blowing 2. 00 m/s) and no fan treatments, and feed bunk side (FB) and water supply side (WS) within a pen (4. 5 m, width× 9. 0 m, length). Beddings were replaced with fresh bedding materials when moisture concentrations were over 65 %. No interactions among treatments were detected for moisture concentration and increment rates, and ammonia concentrations, but a significant effect was observed (p< 0. 01) for each of the treatments. Both concentrations and increment rate of moisture were higher (p< 0. 01) in the beddings without fan than with fan. Moisture concentrations and increment rate within a pen were also higher (p< 0. 01) in FB than WS. Thus, the whole no-fan-FB and sawdust-fan-FB were replaced with fresh bedding material between 4 to 5 experimental weeks. The ammonia concentrations and pH of beddings were not significantly different among treatments. Therefore, using cocopeat bedding with a <b>blowing</b> <b>fan</b> can extend twice the bedding utilization period, and WS within a pen showed twice the bedding-life compared to FB. Despite the outstanding characteristics of cocopeat compared with sawdust, using cocopeat as an alternative for sawdust bedding is not recommended for cattle management, considering it has 4. 4 times higher bedding cost and a dust production problem...|$|E

50|$|First, fuel {{is brought}} to the heater using piping from a fuel tank, or taps into the vehicle’s fuel system. A <b>fan</b> <b>blows</b> air into a {{combustion}} chamber, and a spark plug or ignition device lights the gasoline/air mixture. A built-in safety switch prevents fuel from flowing unless the fan is working. Outside the combustion chamber, a second, larger diameter tube conducts air around the combustion tube's outer surface, and a second <b>fan</b> <b>blows</b> the warmed air into tubing to direct it towards {{the interior of the}} vehicle. Most gasoline heaters produce between 5,000 and 50,000 BTU per hour.|$|R

5000|$|Fan Guns {{are very}} {{different}} from all other guns because they require electricity to power a fan as well as an on-board reciprocating piston air compressor; modern fan guns do not require compressed air from an external source. Compressed air and water are shot out of the gun through a variety of nozzles (there are many different designs) and then the wind from the large <b>fan</b> <b>blows</b> this into a mist in the air to achieve a long hang time. Fan guns have anywhere from 12 to 360 water nozzles on a ring {{on the front of the}} gun through which the <b>fan</b> <b>blows</b> air. These banks can be controlled by valves. The valves are either manual, manual electric, or automatic electric (controlled by logic controller or computer).|$|R

50|$|An air dancer, {{also known}} as a skydancer, is an {{inflatable}} moving advertising product comprising a long fabric tube (with two or more outlets), which is attached to and powered by an electrical fan.

50|$|A misting fan {{is similar}} to a humidifier. A <b>fan</b> <b>blows</b> a fine mist of water into the air. If the air is not too humid, the water evaporates, {{absorbing}} heat from the air, allowing the misting fan to also work as an air cooler. A misting fan may be used outdoors, especially in a dry climate. It may also be used indoors.|$|R
50|$|The {{first case}} is when natural {{convection}} aids forced convection.

40|$|In this study, it {{was aimed}} to {{determine}} the suitable burning technique and grate type of wheat and sunflower stalks. Wheat and sunflower stalks were burnt in three different forms. In the first form, wheat straw was burnt in bale slices, sunflower stalks as it {{was removed from the}} field; in the second form, both stalks were burnt after being chopped without being compressed; and in the third one after being chopped and compressed in polyethylene bags. Three different grates with circle, oblong and mixed (circle+oblong) holed were used in the boiler. Fuels were burnt in the grates in three different forms, i. e., by front natural draft, bottom natural draft and bottom <b>fan</b> <b>blowing.</b> In the study, the highest boiler efficiency for the 1. forms of wheat and sunflower stalks were found as 25. 7 and 25. 1 % in front burning with circle holed grate.

The highest efficiency in the 3. form trials were obtained in the burning type bottom <b>fan</b> <b>blowing</b> and mixed holed grate with bottom <b>fan</b> <b>blowing</b> and circle holed grate in sunflower stalk with 30. 9 %.
