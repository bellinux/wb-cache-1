5|$|Upon {{leaving the}} White House, the couple {{returned}} to California, where they purchased {{a home in}} the wealthy East Gate Old <b>Bel</b> <b>Air</b> neighborhood of <b>Bel</b> <b>Air,</b> Los Angeles, dividing their time between <b>Bel</b> <b>Air</b> and the Reagan Ranch in Santa Barbara, California. Ronald and Nancy regularly attended the <b>Bel</b> <b>Air</b> Church as well. After leaving Washington, Reagan made numerous public appearances, many on behalf of her husband. She continued to reside at the <b>Bel</b> <b>Air</b> home, where she lived with her husband until he died on June 5, 2004.|$|E
5|$|Town {{residents}} {{have access to}} two parks within town limits: Newtown Commons and <b>Bel</b> <b>Air</b> Street Park. Newtown Commons, sometimes called Newtown Park, is located along Main Street, {{and the other is}} on <b>Bel</b> <b>Air</b> Street. At Newtown Commons, residents can hold outdoor events such as picnics, fundraisers or small concerts. The <b>Bel</b> <b>Air</b> Street Park is a playground for children with standard swingsets and other activities.|$|E
5|$|In August, {{several areas}} in Harford County {{were used for}} filming season 2, {{including}} areas in <b>Bel</b> <b>Air</b> and Edgewood. Havre de Grace {{had been used in}} season 1 to depict Underwood's home district in South Carolina. The Liriodendron mansion was the scene of filming on August 12 and 13. <b>Bel</b> <b>Air</b> police were paid $1550 for August 13 duties at another filming location.|$|E
2500|$|RHD <b>Bel</b> <b>Airs</b> {{continued}} to be imported into Australia. [...] Some of these cars featured a reversed 1961 Pontiac instrument panel, but others had {{a mirror image of}} the more attractive current North American panel. [...] Even more curious was {{the fact that some of}} these <b>Bel</b> <b>Airs</b> featured Impala-style triple taillights; the center lens was amber in keeping with Australian legal standards.|$|R
2500|$|The first <b>Bel</b> <b>Airs</b> of {{this era}} shared only their front sheet metal {{ahead of the}} A pillar {{with the rest of}} the range. The windshield, doors, glass, and trunk were common with the Styline DeLuxe Convertible Coupe, however the roof, rear {{quarters}} and rear windows (3) were unique. The chassis and mechanicals were common {{with the rest of the}} passenger car range, and the overall appearance was the same as the rest of the range, except that the roof line was lower and the unique three piece rear window gave it a longer and more balanced look. The first <b>Bel</b> <b>Airs</b> were only available with the [...] "DeLuxe" [...] premium trim level and specification.|$|R
5000|$|... 1956 Chevrolets {{received}} a face-lift. This gave Chevys {{a more conventional}} full-width grille, pleasing those customers who didn't like the Ferrari-inspired '55 front end. Nomads now carried the same interior and rear-wheel sheetmetal as other <b>Bel</b> <b>Airs,</b> lacking the original's unique trim. Shoulder harnesses, and a padded dashboard were now available. For 1956 Chevys hid the gas cap behind a left side, flip-down tail light.|$|R

2500|$|For 1968, the Full-sized Chevrolets {{received}} some changes but were {{quite similar to}} the 1967 models, though they had grown one inch to [...] Chevrolet's new grille design bore a strong resemblance to Cadillac's, but <b>Bel</b> <b>Air's</b> dual round taillight design was strictly Chevrolet. In an unusual move, the taillights were mounted in the bumper. In 1968 the U.S. required seat belts in all motor vehicles, bringing about a new standard in car safety.|$|R
2500|$|The first Chevys {{offered in}} 1951 were in regular sedan {{as well as}} 'fastback' Fleetline versions. Previous to this, National Products and Banthrico had offered Chevy models (Automotive News 1949). The first <b>Bel</b> <b>Airs</b> were offered in 1953; a 4-door sedan and {{convertibles}} in several colors. A more basic smooth sided '53 Chevrolet 150 sedan was also offered (Clarence Young Autohobby). 1954 brought similar offerings. At least on Chevy, the '55 sedan was offered in remote control form.|$|R

Together {{they have two}} children, Christopher Emmanuel Paul, Jr. (born May 23, 2009) and Camryn Alexis Paul (born August 16, 2012). The family resides in a Mediterranean-style mansion in <b>Bel</b> <b>Air,</b> which Paul bought from Avril Lavigne for $8.5 million in 2012. On November 11, 2011, Paul {{appeared}} with his family on Family Feud.|$|E
5|$|Richard died on May 10, 1958; it was {{ten days}} before the child's tenth birthday. Skelton was {{scheduled}} to do his weekly television show on the day his son was buried. Though there were recordings of some older programs available which the network could have run, he asked that guest performers be used instead. Calling themselves The Friends of Red Skelton, his friends in the television, film and music industries organized The Friends Of Red Skelton Variety Show, which they performed to replace The Red Skelton Show for that week; by May 27, 1958, Skelton had returned to his program. The death of Richard profoundly affected the family; by 1961 Richard's model trains had been moved to a storeroom in the <b>Bel</b> <b>Air</b> mansion, but Skelton refused to have them dismantled. In 1962, the Skelton family moved to Palm Springs, and Skelton used the <b>Bel</b> <b>Air</b> home only on the {{two days a week}} when he was in Los Angeles for his television show taping.|$|E
5|$|After Ronald Reagan {{left the}} White House in 1989, the couple retired {{to their home}} in <b>Bel</b> <b>Air,</b> Los Angeles, California. Nancy devoted {{most of her time}} to caring for her husband, who was {{diagnosed}} with Alzheimer's disease in 1994, until his death at the age of 93 on June 5, 2004. Reagan remained active within the Reagan Library and in politics, particularly in support of embryonic stem cell research, until her death from congestive heart failure at age 94 on March 6, 2016.|$|E
5000|$|... 1957 V-8 engine {{displacement}} grew to [...] from 265 in 1957, with the [...] "Super Turbo Fire V8" [...] option producing [...] {{with the help}} of continuous fuel injection. These so-called [...] "fuelie" [...] cars are quite rare, since most <b>Bel</b> <b>Airs</b> were fitted with carburation. While considered to be a milestone vehicle design, General Motors discontinued the original Nomad Sport Wagon {{at the end of the}} 1957 model year due to low sales and the introduction of a new body for 1958.|$|R
25|$|In 1953 and 1954, <b>Bel</b> <b>Airs</b> {{could be}} ordered in convertible, hardtop coupe, two- and four-door sedans, and, for 1954, the Beauville station wagon which {{featured}} woodgrain trim {{around the side}} windows. Many new options, once available only to more expensive luxury cars, became offered starting in 1953, including power steering and the Guidematic headlight dimmer in 1953; and power brakes, power 2-way front seat and power front windows in 1954. All 1954 models equipped with the standard transmission used the 1953 Powerglide engine.|$|R
50|$|Henderson was an {{original}} member of blues group the <b>Bel</b> <b>Airs</b> when they formed in Missouri in 1981. They released an album, Need Me a Car, on Blind Pig Records in 1984. Henderson left the band in 1985 {{and moved to}} Nashville. The following year, he joined the roots rock band The Roosters. He was {{also a member of}} spin-off band The Kingsnakes. The Kingsnakes began playing weekly at the Bluebird Cafe in July 1986. They shortened their name to The Snakes when they were signed by Curb Records. An album, The Snakes, was released by Curb in 1989.|$|R
5|$|After {{leaving office}} in 1989, the Reagans {{purchased}} {{a home in}} <b>Bel</b> <b>Air,</b> Los Angeles, {{in addition to the}} Reagan Ranch in Santa Barbara. They regularly attended <b>Bel</b> <b>Air</b> Church and occasionally made appearances on behalf of the Republican Party; Reagan delivered a well-received speech at the 1992 Republican National Convention. Previously on November 4, 1991, the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library was dedicated and opened to the public. At the dedication ceremonies, five presidents were in attendance, as well as six first ladies, marking the first time that five presidents were gathered in the same location. Reagan continued publicly to speak in favor of a line-item veto; the Brady Bill; a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget; and the repeal of the 22nd Amendment, which prohibits anyone from serving more than two terms as president. In 1992 Reagan established the Ronald Reagan Freedom Award with the newly formed Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation. His final public speech was on February 3, 1994, during a tribute to him in Washington, D.C., and his last major public appearance was at the funeral of Richard Nixon on April 27, 1994.|$|E
5|$|By {{the age of}} 16, Booth was {{interested}} in the theatre and in politics, and he became a delegate from <b>Bel</b> <b>Air</b> to a rally by the Know Nothing Party for Henry Winter Davis, the anti-immigrant party's candidate for Congress in the 1854 elections. Booth aspired to {{follow in the footsteps of}} his father and his actor brothers Edwin and Junius Brutus, Jr. He began practicing elocution daily in the woods around Tudor Hall and studying Shakespeare.|$|E
5|$|When Meissner {{returned}} from the 2006 Olympic Games, a parade was held in her honor {{in her hometown of}} <b>Bel</b> <b>Air.</b> Following her win at the 2006 Worlds, the town gave one of its main roads, Pennsylvania Avenue, the honorary title of Kimmie Way. She threw out the ceremonial first pitch for the Phillies opening day game, and a week later for her hometown team, the Baltimore Orioles, on April 14, 2006.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Bel</b> <b>Air's</b> {{identity}} {{has gone through}} several incarnations since 1780. Aquilla Scott, who had inherited land known as [...] "Scott's Improvement Enlarged," [...] planned the town on a portion that he called [...] "Scott's Old Fields." [...] Four years later, the town had expanded as local politicians, merchants, and innkeepers purchased lots from Scott, and the county commissioners decided to change {{its name to the}} more appealing [...] "Belle Aire." [...] In his deeds, Scott dropped one letter, renaming the town, [...] "Bell Aire." [...] Around 1798, court records dropped two more letters, and [...] "Bel Air" [...] was born.|$|R
2500|$|A 250-cubic-inch six-cylinder {{engine and}} three-speed manual {{transmission}} with column shift remained standard equipment through the 1973 model year on sedans with the 350 V8 and automatic standard on wagons—the Turbo Hydramatic automatic {{had been the}} sole transmission choice on V-8-powered <b>Bel</b> <b>Airs</b> since the spring of 1971 though the old two-speed Powerglide was still offered with the six-cylinder engine through the 1972 model year. Only about 1,400 cars were built with the inline six in 1973. The engine and manual transmission were shelved {{by the end of}} the model year—marking the last full-sized, [...] "body on frame" [...] American car to offer a manual gearbox.|$|R
50|$|Wagons {{were still}} classed by themselves, but had model numbers {{matching}} the car series. Chevrolet eliminated its entry-level Delray-based Yeoman models and the Biscayne-based Brookwood became Chevrolet's least expensive wagon models. Brookwoods were {{now available in}} two-door or four-door body styles, both in six-passenger configuration only. The new Parkwood 6-passenger and new Kingswood 9-passenger wagons had <b>Bel</b> <b>Air's</b> model number, and as such were the middle range wagons. A variety of speed options, such as fuel injection, special cams and lowered compression, gave horsepower ratings up to 315. The Nomad was still the top Chevy wagon. A parking brake warning light was optional. Under the hood, little change took place for '59 Chevys.|$|R
5|$|Azaria {{began dating}} former actress Katie Wright in 2007, {{and the two}} later married. They have a son together, Hal, {{who was born in}} 2009. In 2013, the family moved to New York, renting a home on 80th Street, with plans to make a final {{decision}} on where to live in two years. They previously lived in a four-bedroom house in Pacific Palisades, which Azaria bought from his The Simpsons co-star Dan Castellaneta and his wife Deb Lacusta in 2011. Several weeks earlier, Azaria sold his home in <b>Bel</b> <b>Air.</b> Azaria previously owned the fifth-floor co-op loft at 84 Mercer Street in Manhattan's Soho neighborhood, which he bought in 2005 from photographer Cindy Sherman, before selling it in 2013.|$|E
5|$|Now {{following}} the Wayne–Macomb county line, M-102 separates Warren from Detroit. The highway also runs parallel to, {{and about a}} half mile (0.8km) north of Outer Drive, the original beltway highway proposed in 1918 to encircle Detroit. The road passes the Mound Road Engine facility, a former Chrysler plant next to the Mound Road intersection. East of the plant, the highway crosses a branch line of the Conrail Shared Assets Operations {{on the east side}} of the plant complex before intersecting M-53 (Van Dyke Road). Further east, 8Mile Road passes north of the <b>Bel</b> <b>Air</b> Center Shopping Center before crossing another Canadian National Railway line next to the intersection with M-97 (Groesbeck Highway).|$|E
5|$|Reagan's casket, a Marsellus Masterpiece model, {{was carried}} by a {{military}} honor guard representing all branches of the United States Armed Forces into {{the lobby of the}} library to lie in repose. There, a brief family service was conducted by the Reverend Dr. Michael H. Wenning, former pastor of <b>Bel</b> <b>Air</b> Church, where Reagan worshipped. When the prayer service concluded, Nancy Reagan and her family approached the casket, where Nancy laid her head on it. After the family left, the doors of the presidential library opened, and the public began filing in at a rate of 2,000 an hour throughout the night. In all, about 108,000 people visited the presidential library to see the casket.|$|E
50|$|These RHD {{cars had}} the same {{dashboards}} whether Chevrolet (Impalas and <b>Bel</b> <b>Airs</b> also made it to Australia; NZ took just Impalas) or Pontiac and only one dash design per bodyshell run so the 61-64 models had the one dash (a RHD version of the 1961 Pontiac layout) even though it changed annually in Canada and the 65-68s all had a 'transposed' version of the '65 Chevrolet dash. The RHD cars also had antiquated, short, 'clap-hands' wipers that almost met {{in the middle of}} the windshield rather than the parallel wipers of the LHD Canadian cars. Local radios, upholstery and two-speed heater/demisters were fitted - some Australian cars had local Frigidaire air conditioning.|$|R
50|$|Like the {{slightly}} upscale <b>Bel</b> <b>Airs,</b> Biscaynes are easily {{identified by the}} use of two taillights per side; the only exceptions to this were in 1959 and 1972. The more expensive Impalas (and later Caprices) have three taillights per side. The Biscayne was largely devoid of exterior chrome trim and was normally fitted with small hubcaps, though several exterior trim pieces and upgraded wheel covers were available at extra cost. Interior trim was spartan, with lower-grade cloth and vinyl or all-vinyl upholstery trim, a standard steering wheel with center horn button, and rubber floor mats. Slight upgrades were made throughout the life of the series — for instance, the 1964 models came standard with deluxe steering wheels with horn rings, deep-twist carpeting and foam-cushioned front seats.|$|R

5|$|The Maryland and Pennsylvania Railroad {{was formed}} from two earlier 19th-century 3ft (914mm) narrow gauge railways: the Baltimore & Delta Railway, later the Baltimore & Lehigh Railway, and the York and Peach Bottom Railway, later the York Southern Railroad. Construction of the Baltimore & Delta Railway started in 1881, and {{passenger}} trains between Baltimore and Towson, Maryland began on April 17, 1882. Later that year {{the company was}} merged into the Maryland Central Railroad. The line was extended northward to <b>Bel</b> <b>Air,</b> Maryland on June 21, 1883, and the following January, the line was completed to Delta, Pennsylvania.|$|E
5|$|On June 5, 2004, Ronald Reagan, the 40th President of the United States, {{died after}} having {{suffered}} from Alzheimer's disease {{for nearly a}} decade. His seven-day state funeral followed. After Reagan's death, his body was taken from his <b>Bel</b> <b>Air,</b> Los Angeles home to the Gates, Kingsley and Gates Funeral Home in Santa Monica, California to prepare the body for burial. On June 7, Reagan's casket was transported by hearse and displayed at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California, then flown to Washington, D.C. on June 9 for a service, public viewing and tributes at the U.S. Capitol. His death occurred on the 60th anniversary of the WWII Allied D-Day invasion of Normandy, France, and the 20th anniversary of his own well-remembered speech commemorating that occasion at Pointe du Hoc. It was also the 36th anniversary of the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy.|$|E
5|$|Shooting began September 23, 1937 and was {{scheduled}} to end November 20, 1937 on a budget of $767,676. Filming began in-studio with the scenes in Susan's apartment, moving to the <b>Bel</b> <b>Air</b> Country Club in early October for the golf-course scenes. The production had a difficult start due to Hepburn's struggles with her character and her comedic abilities. She frequently overacted, trying too hard to be funny, and Hawks asked vaudeville veteran Walter Catlett to help coach her. Catlett acted out scenes with Grant for Hepburn, showing {{her that he was}} funnier when he was serious. Hepburn understood, acted naturally and played herself {{for the rest of the}} shoot; she was so impressed by Catlett's talent and coaching ability that she insisted he play Constable Slocum in the film.|$|E
25|$|The 150 sedan {{shows an}} {{interesting}} trend in promotional offerings when comparing the early 1950s {{with the early}} 1960s. The pre-performance, post-war era of practicality in the early 1950s gave emphasis to more economical sedans, so it is notable that early promotional model makers commonly molded vehicles in 4-door configurations {{even in the most}} basic models available. Four-door <b>Bel</b> <b>Airs</b> were offered by PMC {{all the way up to}} 1958, one available with police decor. It is interesting that PMC also did a 1958 Chevrolet in two-door style, reinforcing the trend that by about 1960 most promotional makers only modeled sportier and more powerful 2-door coupes and hardtops. However, a molded red four door did became a Fire Chief car. This was in line with the newer era of a stronger economy, more affluent clientele and the onset of the new baby-boomer driver's market.|$|R
5000|$|... 1955 Chevrolets {{received}} all-new styling. Advertised as [...] "The Hot One," [...] the boxy new Chevy was crisp, clean, {{and thoroughly}} modern-looking, and its popularity was {{shared with the}} Tri-Five Chevrolets of this generation. Nomads, like <b>Bel</b> <b>Airs,</b> came loaded with interior carpet, chrome spears on front fenders, chrome window moldings, and full wheel covers. For 1955 Chevrolets gained a V8 engine option. The new 265 cuin L V8 featured a modern, overhead valve, high compression, short stroke design that was so good that it remained in production in various forms for many decades. The base V8 had a two-barrel carburetor and was rated at , and the [...] "Power Pack" [...] option featured a four-barrel carburetor and other upgrades yielding [...] Later in the year, a [...] "Super Power Pack" [...] option added high-compression and a further [...] It had room for six passengers.|$|R
50|$|The new Kingswood {{was offered}} as a mid range full size 4-door only 9 {{passenger}} model, with rear-facing 3rd row jump-seat standard.
