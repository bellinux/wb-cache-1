Previously, we {{have reported that}} Arabidopsis plants lacking TFIIS exhibit reduced seed dormancy. Among the genes differentially expressed in tfIIs seeds, the DOG 1 gene was identified that is a known QTL for seed dormancy. Here we have analysed plants that overexpress TFIIS in wild type background, or that harbour an additional copy of DOG 1 in tfIIs mutant background. These experiments demonstrate that the down-regulation of DOG 1 expression causes the seed dormancy phenotype of tfIIs mutants...|$|R

40|$|Herpesviruses {{consistently}} transmit from immunocompetent carriers, {{implying that}} their neutralization {{is hard to}} achieve. Murid Herpesvirus- 4 (MuHV- 4) exploits host IgG Fc receptors to <b>bypass</b> <b>blocks</b> to cell binding, and pH-dependent protein conformation changes to unveil its fusion machinery only after endocytosis. Nevertheless neutralization remains possible by targeting the virion glycoprotein H (gH) / gL heterodimer, and the neutralizing antibody responses of MuHV- 4 carriers are improved by boosting with recombinant gH/gL. We analysed here how gH/gL-directed neutralization works. The MuHV- 4 gH/gL binds to heparan sulfate. However most gH/gL-specific neutralizing antibodies did not block this interaction. Nor did they act directly on fusion. Instead they blocked virion endocytosis and transport to the late endosomes where membrane fusion normally occurs. The poor endocytosis of gH/gL-neutralized virions was recapitulated precisely by virions genetically lacking gL. Therefore driving virion uptake {{appears to be an}} important function of gH/gL that provides a major target for antibody-mediated neutralization. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|The {{physiological}} {{changes that}} occur during the mycelial- to yeast-phase transitions induced by a temperature shift from 25 to 37 degrees C of cultures of Blastomyces dermatitidis and Paracoccidioides brasiliensis {{can be divided into}} three stages. The triggering event is a heat-related insult induced by the temperature shift which results in partial uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation and declines in cellular ATP levels, respiration rates, and concentrations of electron transport components (stage 1). The cells then enter a stage in which spontaneous respiration ceases (stage 2), and finally, there is a shift into a recovery phase during which transformation to yeast morphology occurs (stage 3). Cysteine is required during stage 2 for the operation of shunt pathways which permit electron transport to <b>bypass</b> <b>blocked</b> portions of the cytochrome system. The mycelial- to yeast-phase transitions of these two fungi are very similar to that of Histoplasma capsulatum. Therefore, these three dimorphic fungal pathogens have evolved parallel mechanisms to adjust to the temperature shifts which induce these mycelial- to yeast-phase transitions...|$|R
40|$|Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutants {{that fail}} to {{complete}} meiotic recombination are blocked by the RAD 17 /RAD 24 /MEC 1 checkpoint signaling pathway in pachytene when early sporulation genes are expressed. Middle genes are not activated in checkpoint-arrested cells because the Ndt 80 transcription factor is inhibited. We find that the pachytene checkpoint requires Sum 1, a transcriptional repressor that recognizes a subset of Ndt 80 -binding sites. Mutants lacking Sum 1 or Rad 17 partially <b>bypass</b> the <b>block</b> to the nuclear divisions but do not form spores, while mutants lacking both Sum 1 and Rad 17 completely <b>bypass</b> the <b>block</b> and form morphologically normal spores. The level of Sum 1 protein decreases as middle genes are expressed, and this decrease is blocked in checkpoint-arrested cells. These data suggest that Sum 1 levels are regulated by the checkpoint and that progression of the meiotic divisions and spore differentiation can be differentially controlled by competition of the Sum 1 repressor and Ndt 80 activator for occupancy at key middle promoters...|$|R

40|$|REV 1 and DNA Polymerase ζ (REV 3 and REV 7) play {{important}} roles in translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) in which DNA replication <b>bypasses</b> <b>blocking</b> lesions. REV 1 and Polζ have also been implicated in promoting repair of DNA double-stranded breaks (DSBs). However, the mechanism by which these two TLS polymerases increase tolerance to DSBs is poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that full-length human REV 1, REV 3 and REV 7 interact in vivo (as determined by co-immunoprecipitation studies) and together, promote homologous recombination repair. Cells lacking REV 3 were hypersensitive to agents that cause DSBs including the PARP inhibitor, olaparib. REV 1, REV 3 or REV 7 -depleted cells displayed increased chromosomal aberrations, residual DSBs and sites of HR repair following exposure to ionizing radiation. Notably, cells depleted of DNA polymerase η (Polη) or the E 3 ubiquitin ligase RAD 18 were proficient in DSB repair following exposure to IR indicating that Polη-dependent lesion bypass or RAD 18 -dependent monoubiquitination of PCNA are not necessary to promote REV 1 and Polζ-dependent DNA repair. Thus, the REV 1 /Polζ complex maintains genomic stability by directly participating in DSB repair {{in addition to the}} canonical TLS pathway...|$|R
