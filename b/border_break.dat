30|$|Municipal {{division}} {{is an interesting}} one {{in the context of}} Helsinki and Finland. Helsinki metropolitan area is not an official regional category: it is used to identify a total of 12 municipalities under one concept depicting a geographical area surrounding Helsinki. The question of municipal borders is highly relevant as the main cities (Helsinki, Espoo, and Vantaa) clearly comprise a functional area but administrative local government <b>borders</b> <b>break</b> the area into three separate legal entities with their own city councils, planning, and taxation. This is a textbook example of how naturally functioning areas should not be divided by administrative (political) borders.|$|R

50|$|As soon as Davies is born, he and Morn are {{threatened}} from two sides. First, Nick discovers Morn's lies. Nick can see immediately {{that he is}} not Davies' father because Davies looks just like Angus. Hoping to find out why Morn survived the force-growth, the aliens run a scan which reveals her zone implant. Angry and betrayed, Nick wants revenge against Morn and her son. An opportunity arises when the Amnion demand that he sell Davies back to them. He gets his opportunity when the aliens demand they return Davies into their custody, but doesn't account for the extreme lengths to which Morn will go to protect her son. While Nick negotiates with the Amnion to trade Davies for engine parts, Morn escapes from a locked room and rigs a self-destruct large enough to destroy the ship itself and most of Enablement Station. Morn is successfully able to threaten both sides. She orders Nick to keep Davies on the ship rather than sell him to the Amnion, then forces the aliens to give them the engine parts anyway. When the Amnion hold Nick accountable for Morn's actions and declare him an enemy, he flees from their warship back toward human space. The alien ships pursue him across the <b>border,</b> <b>breaking</b> the treaties that had until then prevented outright war between the Amnion and the UMCP.|$|R
50|$|KanColle Arcade (艦これアーケード) is {{a trading}} card arcade game {{developed}} by Sega AM2 and launched on April 26, 2016. The game features fully modeled 3D characters, and involves the player {{taking control of}} the direction and speed of their ship in combat against Abyssal ships, in addition to collecting different shipgirls. The game charges players with a GP system akin to that of <b>Border</b> <b>Break,</b> where money is converted into GP at a specific rate, with these points consumed for each second of play or converted in exchange for various other game elements. The game is controlled using a steering wheel and speed lever, and the player is able to organise their fleet using kanmusu cards ejected by the arcade machine. While in combat, the player can choose between using primary and secondary armaments, torpedoes and airstrikes against foes.|$|E

40|$|A molecular-statistical {{theory for}} the entire {{sequence}} of the chiral tilted smectic phases is derived. Uniaxial and biaxial subphases {{were found to be}} stable in different temperature ranges depending on the molecular parameters. The model of a chiral molecule possessing a strong transverse terminal dipole moment and a quadrupole moment located in the molecular core was used. Direct dispersion and electrostatic interactions modulated by shape between molecules located in the same or in the neighboring smectic layers are taken into account. An effective long-range interaction arises after the minimization of the free energy with respect to polarization vectors. If the molecular quadrupole moment is small, only uniaxial phases with different periodicities arise. Their periodicity may be tens and hundreds of layers Sm-C*, or approximately two layers Sm-CA *, or several layers Sm-C *. In the presence of the nonpolar biaxial ordering in addition to polarization there is a cap-shaped border in the phase diagram that separates Sm-CA *, Sm-C*, and Sm-C *. If the molecules are nonchiral, Sm-CA, Sm-C, and the de Vries?s phases arise instead of the three phases mentioned above. If the molecular quadrupole moment is large, the left ?arm? of the <b>border</b> <b>breaks</b> into two lines, and a sequence of biaxial subphases arises in the area between these two lines. Among these biaxial subphases, the one with periodicity of three smectic layers appears to be the broadest in the temperature range. In addition, the subphases with different periodicities were found to be stable in narrow temperature ranges. The long helical rotation in every biaxial subphase is calculated. It is found to change sign between the three-layer subphase and Sm-C*, and may diverge in the four-layer subphase if it arises. All calculations are done with help of A FLC Phase Diagram Plotter software developed by the first author and available at his web-page...|$|R
