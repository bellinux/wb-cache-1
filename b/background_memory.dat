With pharmacogenetic inhibition we here demonstrate that hilar perforant path-associated (HIPP) cells of the dentate gyrus mediate the devaluation of <b>background</b> context <b>memory</b> during Pavlovian fear conditioning. The salience adjustment is sensitive to reduction of hilar neuropeptide Y (NPY) expression via dominant negative CREB expression in HIPP cells and to acute blockage of NPY-Y 1 receptors in the dentate gyrus during conditioning. We show that NPY transmission and HIPP cell activity contribute to inhibitory effects of acetylcholine in the dentate gyrus and that M 1 muscarinic receptors mediate the cholinergic activation of HIPP cells as well as their control of background context salience. Our data provide evidence for a peptidergic local circuit in the dentate gyrus that mediates the cholinergic encoding of background context salience during fear memory acquisition. Intra-hippocampal circuits are essential for associating a background context with behaviorally salient stimuli and involve cholinergic modulation at SST(+) interneurons.

40|$|Abstract – In {{real-time}} data-dominated {{communication and}} multimedia processing applications, {{due to the}} manipulation of large sets of data, a multi-layer memory hierarchy is used to enhance the system performance and also to reduce the energy consumption. Savings of dynamic energy {{can be obtained by}} accessing frequently used data from smaller memories rather than from large <b>background</b> <b>memories.</b> The optimization of the hierarchical memory architecture implies the addition of layers of smaller memories to which heavily used data can be copied. This paper presents a formal model for data reuse analysis which identifies those parts of arrays more intensely accessed, taking also into account the relative lifetimes of the signals. Tested on a two-layer memory hierarchy, this model led to savings in the dynamic energy from 40 % to over 70 % relative to the energy used {{in the case of a}} flat memory design. ...|$|R
