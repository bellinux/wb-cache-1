5000|$|A <b>Backup</b> Appliance (also {{known as}} a [...] "data <b>backup</b> appliance") is an {{all-in-one}} product that provides all of the essential components of a <b>backup</b> system architecture that are required to build a complete <b>backup</b> solution, bundled into a single appliance. A <b>backup</b> appliance is usually designed for and sold to IT departments for small and medium-sized businesses. A <b>backup</b> appliance includes within it <b>backup</b> software (which provides the <b>backup</b> manager), and <b>backup</b> storage. A <b>backup</b> appliance usually includes (or provides) additional <b>backup</b> client software, which is for installation on the computers {{that are to be}} backed up (the <b>backup</b> clients [...] ) and do not have <b>backup</b> agents pre-installed.|$|R
50|$|A single <b>Backup</b> Exec server is {{assigned}} the standalone <b>Backup</b> Exec server role. Each server runs the <b>Backup</b> Exec software and {{the services that}} control <b>backup</b> and restore operations of multiple clients. Each <b>Backup</b> Exec server maintains its own <b>Backup</b> Exec database, media catalogs, and device catalogs.|$|R
50|$|A more {{sophisticated}} incremental <b>backup</b> scheme involves multiple numbered <b>backup</b> levels. A full <b>backup</b> is level 0. A level n <b>backup</b> will back up {{everything that has}} changed since the most recent level n-1 <b>backup.</b> Suppose for instance that a level 0 <b>backup</b> was taken on a Sunday. A level 1 <b>backup</b> taken on Monday would include only changes made since Sunday. A level 2 <b>backup</b> taken on Tuesday would include only changes made since Monday. A level 3 <b>backup</b> taken on Wednesday would include only changes made since Tuesday. If a level 2 <b>backup</b> was taken on Thursday, it would include all changes made since Monday because Monday was the most recent level n-1 <b>backup.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{work done}} on the film to date was nearly lost in 1998 {{when one of the}} animators, while {{routinely}} clearing some files, accidentally started a deletion of the root folder of the Toy Story 2 assets on Pixar's internal servers. Associate technical director Oren Jacobs {{was one of the first}} to notice as character models disappeared from their works in progress. They shut down the file servers but had lost 90% of the last two years of work, and the <b>backups</b> were found to have failed some time previously. The film was saved when technical director Galyn Susman, who had been working from home to take care of her newborn child, revealed she had <b>backups</b> of the assets on her home computer. The Pixar team was able to recover nearly all of the lost assets save for a few recent days of work, allowing the film to proceed.|$|E
5|$|US 206 was widened in Byram Township to six lanes. This {{construction}} {{follows a}} decade of controversy, including concerns that the widening would violate the Highlands Water Protection and Planning Act passed in 2004; an exemption to this act allowed the construction to proceed. The widening is being done in order to eliminate <b>backups</b> on the current two-lane stretch during rush hours. The project was slated to be finished in November 2013.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of tools {{intended}} specifically to decrypt files locked by ransomware, although successful recovery may not be possible. If the same encryption key is used for all files, decryption tools use files for which there are both uncorrupted <b>backups</b> and encrypted copies (a known-plaintext attack in the jargon of cryptanalysis); recovery of the key, if it is possible, may take several days. Free ransomware decryption tools can help decrypt files encrypted by the following forms of ransomware: AES_NI, Alcatraz Locker, Apocalypse, BadBlock, Bart, BTCWare, Crypt888, CryptoMix, CrySiS, EncrypTile, FindZip, Globe, Hidden Tear, Jigsaw, LambdaLocker, Legion, NoobCrypt, Stampado, SZFLocker, TeslaCrypt, XData.|$|E
50|$|A {{differential}} <b>backup</b> is {{a cumulative}} <b>backup</b> of all changes made {{since the last}} full <b>backup,</b> i.e., the differences since the last full <b>backup.</b> The advantage to this is the quicker recovery time, requiring only a full <b>backup</b> and the last differential <b>backup</b> to restore the entire data repository. The disadvantage is that for each day elapsed since the last full <b>backup,</b> more data needs to be backed up, especially if {{a significant proportion of}} the data has changed, thus increasing <b>backup</b> time as compared to the incremental <b>backup</b> method.|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} new {{approach}} exploiting the failure risk (node, link or Shared Risk Link Group) structures to enhance the <b>backup</b> path computation. Upon failure, our approach classifies the <b>backup</b> paths into two categories: operative <b>backup</b> paths and inoperative <b>backup</b> paths. An operative <b>backup</b> path is an active <b>backup</b> path which really receives traffic of some affected communications while an inoperative <b>backup</b> path does not receive any traffic. With the observation that only the operative <b>backup</b> paths really participate to the recovery procedure, we enhance the <b>backup</b> path computation (1) by limiting the concurrence for the protection bandwidth allocations to the operative <b>backup</b> paths (instead of all the active <b>backup</b> paths like in the classical approaches) and (2) by reducing the set of failure risks that a <b>backup</b> path must bypass. Simulations shows that our approach improves the protection bandwidth allocations and decreases the ratio of rejected <b>backup</b> paths...|$|R

5|$|Al Ward {{replaced}} Ewbank {{as general}} manager in 1975. The Jets won four of their five preseason games, though sportswriter Gerald Eskenazi, in his history of the Jets, notes that the wins were secured by playing first-string players while the other teams were trying out rookies and <b>backups.</b> When the regular season started, the Jets lost seven of their first nine games, and Winner was fired. Offensive coordinator Ken Shipp became interim head coach, and the Jets finished {{with a record of}} 3–11. Running back John Riggins, who became the first 1,000-yard rusher in franchise history during the season and made the Pro Bowl, departed for the Washington Redskins as he felt the Jets' Namath-led offense passed the ball too often. New York hired North Carolina State coach Lou Holtz. With New York enduring the second of three consecutive 3–11 seasons (two wins came over the 2–12 Bills and a third over the 0–14 expansion Tampa Bay Buccaneers), Holtz—who went on to great success at Notre Dame—resigned with one game left in the season to become head coach at the University of Arkansas.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the spacecraft's orbit and facilitate maneuvers, sixteen Sun sensors – eight primaries and eight <b>backups</b> – are placed around the spacecraft to calibrate solar direction relative to the orbiter's frame. Two star trackers, digital cameras used to map the position of catalogued stars, provide NASA with full, three-axis knowledge of the spacecraft orientation and attitude. A primary and backup Miniature Inertial Measurement Unit (MIMU), provided by Honeywell, measures changes to the spacecraft attitude as well as any non-gravitationally induced changes to its linear velocity. Each MIMU is a combination of three accelerometers and three ring-laser gyroscopes. These systems are all critically important to MRO, as it must be able to point its camera to a very high precision in order to take the high-quality pictures that the mission requires. It has also been specifically designed to minimize any vibrations on the spacecraft, so as to allow its instruments to take images without any distortions caused by vibrations.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} quarter, the Crimson Tide {{scored on a}} 52-yard Cade Foster field goal and on field goals of 26 and 30 yards by Jeremy Shelley before McCarron threw a four-yard {{touchdown}} pass to Christion Jones to make the halftime score 30–0. The defense also dominated the quarter and did not allow FAU a single third down conversion during the period. In the third, Foster connected on a 46-yard field goal and {{early in the fourth}} quarter Kenyan Drake scored on an eight-yard touchdown run for a 40–0 lead. With the game in hand, Alabama played many of their <b>backups</b> in the second half. As such, late in the fourth quarter the Crimson Tide shutout streak that stretched back to the third quarter of their week one victory over Michigan ended when the Owls' Graham Wilbert threw a six-yard touchdown pass to Alex Deleon that made the final score 40–7.|$|E

5|$|Over the years, several traffic circles {{have been}} {{modified}} or replaced along Route 73. The Marlton Circle at Route 70 in Marlton was modified in 1974 to allow Route 73 to run directly {{straight through the}} circle. This circle became known for traffic <b>backups</b> and was replaced with an interchange. Construction on this interchange, which cost $31 million, began in April 2009. In May 2010, the circle was eliminated with a temporary at-grade intersection constructed while the Route 73 bridge over Route 70 was being built. The interchange was completed in June 2011. A traffic circle that existed {{at the intersection of}} Route 38 and Route 41 in Maple Shade Township was removed by the 1960s and replaced by the current set of interchanges. In addition, the Berlin Circle in Berlin was replaced by an at-grade intersection between August 2005 and September 2006 at a cost of $73 million.|$|E
5|$|Robinson's {{appearances}} at Leeds were at first sporadic, {{although he did}} play in a UEFA Champions League match against Barcelona, which finished 1–1. He was Leeds' number two goalkeeper behind Nigel Martyn, making five league appearances in his debut season and none in the following season. He made 16 appearances in the 2000–01 season, following Martyn sustaining an injury, but did not play a league match in the following season. Terry Venables dropped Martyn after he requested a break from pre-season training after the 2002 FIFA World Cup. Robinson became Leeds' number one goalkeeper as a result, with Robinson playing in all 38 matches of the 2002–03 season. Martyn left for Everton {{at the start of}} the following season, with young goalkeepers Danny Milosevic and Scott Carson taking over as <b>backups</b> for Robinson.|$|E
5|$|When Garbage {{began to}} collate the {{material}} for Absolute Garbage, it transpired that the analog masters of their eponymous debut album had been lost. Neither of the band's record labels had them, and after further searching, the band established {{that none of}} the mastering facilities they had used had stored them either. Vig and audio engineer Billy Bush were able to track down an archived, but rather incomplete and damaged, set of 16bit 44.1kHz safety DAT mixes. Despite the <b>backups</b> being far from an optimal situation, mastering engineer Emily Lazar at The Lodge in New York City was able to reverse engineer the missing songs from the damaged archive. Lazar used some alternate versions of the songs when completing the final master. Her assistant, Joe LaPorta, mastered and edited the remixes for the special edition.|$|E

5000|$|Differential : Each {{differential}} <b>backup</b> {{saves the}} data that has changed since the last full <b>backup.</b> It has the advantage that only a maximum of two data sets are needed to restore the data. One disadvantage, compared to the incremental <b>backup</b> method, is that as time from the last full <b>backup</b> (and thus the accumulated changes in data) increases, so does the time to perform the differential <b>backup.</b> Restoring an entire system would require starting from the most recent full <b>backup</b> and then applying just the last differential <b>backup</b> since the last full <b>backup.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{differential}} <b>backup</b> is {{a cumulative}} <b>backup</b> of all changes made {{since the last}} full or normal <b>backup,</b> i.e., the differences since the last full <b>backup.</b> The advantage to this is the quicker recovery time, requiring only a full <b>backup</b> and the last differential <b>backup</b> to restore the system. The disadvantage is that for each day elapsed since the last full <b>backup,</b> more data needs to be backed up, especially if {{a significant proportion of}} the data has changed.|$|R
5|$|For {{their final}} regular season game the Trojans faced their {{cross-town}} rivals, the eleventh–ranked UCLA Bruins, led by fourth–year head coach Karl Dorrell and quarterback Drew Olson. The Trojans got an early lead with a Mario Danelo field goal {{and did not}} slow down, scoring on a Leinart touchdown pass {{and a pair of}} rushing touchdowns by LenDale White and Reggie Bush. The Bruins were finally able to score midway through the second quarter with a field goal, and then fourminutes later with another, but Bush ran for his second touchdown late in the quarter to give the Trojans a 31–6 lead at half-time. In the third quarter, Leinart threw his second touchdown of the game, and then 13seconds later, a fumble by the Bruins was returned by Justin Wyatt for another Trojan touchdown. Leinart threw his third touchdown of the game to White and White rushed for his second rushing touchdown before the Bruins would score on a Maurice Drew rush. With <b>backups</b> in the game, the Trojans scored on another rush, before Olson threw his only touchdown pass of the game with 11seconds left. With the missed extra point, the Trojans won 66–19, increasing their winning streak to 34games, which tied them for the fourthlongest winning streak of all-time. With the win, they clinched the Pac-10 title, first place in the BCS rankings, and an invitation to the Rose Bowl, which served as the national championship game.|$|E
5|$|Many of the pre-game and in-game {{strategic}} {{decisions in}} baseball revolve around a fundamental fact: in general, right-handed batters {{tend to be}} more successful against left-handed pitchers and, to an even greater degree, left-handed batters {{tend to be more}} successful against right-handed pitchers. A manager with several left-handed batters in the regular lineup who knows the team will be facing a left-handed starting pitcher may respond by starting {{one or more of the}} right-handed <b>backups</b> on the team's roster. During the late innings of a game, as relief pitchers and pinch hitters are brought in, the opposing managers will often go back and forth trying to create favorable matchups with their substitutions: the manager of the fielding team trying to arrange same-handed pitcher-batter matchups, the manager of the batting team trying to arrange opposite-handed matchups. With a team that has the lead in the late innings, a manager may remove a starting position player—especially one whose turn at bat is not likely to come up again—for a more skillful fielder. Furthermore, unlike players in most team sports, baseball players can not return to a game after being replaced; this creates a greater risk when making lineup changes, especially as a team's pitching staff may be increasingly depleted in the late innings of a game, particularly one which goes into multiple extra innings.|$|E
5|$|The road opener was {{the first}} game ever played in the new home stadium of the UCF Knights. McCoy's 47 passing {{attempts}} tied a Texas single-game record. His 32 completions set a new school record, besting the 30 completed by Vince Young during the 2006 Rose Bowl and by Major Applewhite during two 1999 games. The final non-conference game was against Rice, and McCoy completed 20 of his 29 passing attempts, accumulating 333 yards through the air. For {{the first time in}} the season, he did not throw an interception. McCoy and most of the Longhorn starting players were replaced by <b>backups</b> after the first drive of the second half. True freshman quarterback John Chiles made his first college appearance in the first quarter. He came onto the field beside McCoy and then McCoy trotted out to a slot receiver position. Chiles never looked to pass; he ran up the middle for no gain. He came out of the game after that play and came back in the third quarter as McCoy's replacement. On that drive, Chiles line up in the zone-read offense and led the Longhorns 80 yards to a touchdown, carrying the ball four times for 49 yards. Chiles' strong performance immediately led to media speculation as to how much playing time he will take from McCoy.|$|E

5|$|In {{an effort}} to rebuild, the team {{acquired}} several players who were highly talented, but had reputations for off-court troubles. Isaiah Rider, who was traded by the Minnesota Timberwolves for a draft pick and career <b>backups</b> due to his frequent arrests and lack of punctuality, was arrested for cannabis possession two days before his debut with the Blazers. Rasheed Wallace, who was acknowledged as a hot-tempered player since college, was also acquired, in a trade with the Washington Bullets. Point guard Kenny Anderson was {{signed as a free}} agent, and subsequently traded to the Toronto Raptors for Damon Stoudamire in February 1998 (the Raptors traded Anderson to the Boston Celtics five days later, because {{he did not want to}} play in Canada). Initially, this approach worked, as the team returned to the Western Conference finals in 1999 under head coach Mike Dunleavy. After being swept by the eventual champion San Antonio Spurs, Whitsitt sent Rider and guard Jim Jackson to the Atlanta Hawks for guard Steve Smith and acquired former All-Star forward Scottie Pippen from the Houston Rockets. The team again advanced to the Western Conference Finals, where they faced a Los Angeles Lakers team led by Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant. In that series, the Trail Blazers dropped three out of the first four games before winning the next two, forcing a pivotal Game 7. The Blazers had a 15-point lead in the fourth quarter, but lost the game and the series to the Lakers, who went on to win the first of three consecutive titles.|$|E
5|$|Since 1953, {{many changes}} have {{occurred}} to Route 70. Several traffic circles that had existed on the road had been either modified or replaced by at-grade intersections. The Marlton Circle at Route 73 in Marlton was modified in 1974 to allow Route 73 to run directly straight through the circle. This circle became known for traffic <b>backups</b> and was replaced with an interchange. Construction on this interchange, which cost $31 million, began in April 2009. In May 2010, the circle was eliminated with a temporary at-grade intersection constructed while the Route 73 bridge over Route 70 was being built. The interchange was completed in June 2011. Also, the Race Track Circle at the intersection with CR 644 (Haddonfield Road) was eventually replaced by an at-grade intersection. The Laurelton Circle at Route 88, built in 1937, {{was replaced by the}} 1990s. The Ellisburg Circle at Route 41 and Route 154, was replaced by an intersection with jughandles. The Brielle Circle at the eastern terminus was also converted to an intersection with jughandles in 2001. In conjunction with eliminating the Brielle Circle, Route 70 was also widened between the intersection with Jack Martin Boulevard in Brick Township and the former circle. In July 2004, floods caused by heavy rain washed away a bridge along the route in Southampton Township, leading for it to be replaced. The New Jersey Department of Transportation replaced the September 11th Memorial Bridge over the Manasquan River in a $52 million project that increased capacity on the bridge and added monumental decorations and increased pedestrian access. Construction was scheduled to be complete in December 2010; however, the project was completed ahead of schedule in September 2008.|$|E

Individual frames {{can be saved}} from the clip, while the frames {{can also be used}} with other editing features such as Sequence Shot (which superimposes multiple frames into a composite image). Photos taken in Zoe mode are also displayed with animated thumbnails in the gallery. The Highlights feature can automatically generate a montage video from photos and videos with multiple theme and soundtrack options. The resulting video can be exported, or posted online through the HTC Share service (where they are accessible for 30 days). A television guide app is also provided, which incorporates remote control functionality via an infrared blaster hidden in the One’s power button, show recommendations powered by Peel, and the ability to display show reminders as stories on BlinkFeed. An updated music app now {{includes a}} visualizer and support for on-screen lyrics. An updated version of the Get Started feature (as introduced by HTC One X+) allows users to perform initial setup for their One via a web-based service, while a new Sync Manager allows data to be migrated from iOS device <b>backups</b> or HTC devices with Android 4.0 and higher.
