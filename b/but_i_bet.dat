500|$|In {{many places}} the film {{references}} classic movies, predominantly those by Disney. When Tinker Bell falls on Donkey {{and he says}} [...] "I can fly" [...] and people around including the Three Little Pigs say [...] "He can fly, he can fly"; this is a reference to Disney's Peter Pan. This scene is also {{a reference to the}} Disney film Dumbo, where Donkey says, while flying, [...] "You might have seen a house fly, maybe even a super fly, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> you ain't never seen a Donkey fly" [...] The scene where Fiona is singing to the blue bird is a reference to Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. The transformation scene {{at the end of the}} film strongly references to Disney's Beauty and the Beast.|$|E
500|$|Fujisawa and Honda visited Kreidler and Lambretta showrooms, {{as well as}} others, {{researching the}} kind of {{motorcycle}} Fujisawa had in mind. [...] Fujisawa said these designs had [...] "no future" [...] and would not sell well. His concept was a two wheeler for everyman, one that would appeal to both developed and developing countries, urban and rural. The new motorcycle needed to be technologically simple to survive in places without up-to-date know-how and access to advanced tools or reliable spare parts supplies. The common consumer complaints of noise, poor reliability, especially in the electrics, and general difficulty of use {{would have to be}} addressed. Because Honda was a large company growing larger, it needed a mass-appeal product that could be produced on an enormous scale. The design had to be sorted out before production began, because it would be too costly to fix problems in the vast numbers that were to be manufactured. The scooter type nearly fitted the bill, but was too complex for developing countries to maintain, and the small wheels did poorly on badly maintained or nonexistent roads. Another of Fujisawa's requirements was that it could be ridden with one hand while carrying a tray of soba noodles, saying to Honda, [...] "If you can design a small motorcycle, say 50cc with a cover to hide the engine and hoses and wires inside, I can sell it. I don't know how many soba noodle shops there are in Japan, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> you that every shop will want one for deliveries." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{animosity}} {{continued into}} the 2000s, with Dunn criticizing the Chili Peppers on his personal webpage, specifically their bass player Flea, stating, [...] "Flea, in all seriousness, really isn't that good. I mean c'mon Red Hot Chili Peppers were vaguely interesting in the late 80s, but Christ they fucking suck, they suck". Patton was asked in 2010 about the festivals and his relationship with Kiedis. Patton said [...] "It’s not worth talking about. I’ve {{no idea what it}} was about then and I don’t know now. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> we’d have a warm embrace if we saw each other now." [...] In 2016, Trey Spruance reflected on the Mr. Bungle feud, stating that it was a [...] "weird and unprofessional jealous vendetta from a huge successful band towards an industry pip-squeak." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{animosity}} {{between the}} two bands continued with Dunn later criticizing the Chili Peppers on his personal webpage, specifically their bass player Flea, stating, [...] "Look, Flea, in all seriousness, really isn't that good. I mean c'mon Red Hot Chili Peppers were vaguely interesting in the late 80s, but Christ they fucking suck, they suck. Don't talk about it anymore". Patton was asked in 2010 about the festivals and his relationship with Kiedis. Patton said [...] "It’s not worth talking about. I’ve {{no idea what it}} was about then and I don’t know now. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> we’d have a warm embrace if we saw each other now." [...] In 2016, Trey Spruance reflected on the feud, claiming that it was a [...] "weird and unprofessional jealous vendetta from a huge successful band towards an industry pip-squeak." [...] He also said that early in their career, the band were fans of the first two Red Hot Chili Peppers albums. However, Trevor Dunn disputes this, and wrote, [...] "I was way more into Fishbone and Bad Manners back in the day." ...|$|E

5000|$|Christian {{rock band}} Relient K {{released}} {{a recording of}} the song on their 2007 album Let It Snow, Baby... Let It Reindeer.

40|$|First paragraph: Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon’s {{announcement}} of a draft bill to make a second independence referendum viable unsurprisingly delighted the audience at the SNP conference in Glasgow.

500|$|TVSquad {{reviewer}} Jonathon Toomey {{gave the}} first episode 9 out of 10 and said of it that [...] "This show is legit, well-worth watching. The only reason I'm holding back that last star is because the screener DVD I received only had the pilot episode and I suppose it's possible that the show could go downhill after that. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> wouldn't <b>bet</b> on it. [...] " [...] Toomey also later added another review of the premiere, stating that [...] "I'm worried though. Dexter is good. In fact, it's really good. That's why I'm worried. Why? Because Showtime has a nasty little habit of canceling great shows. There was The Chris Isaak Show. Then Dead Like Me. The most recent casualty? Huff. All three of those shows were spectacular. And you know what? Dexter is better than all of them. So, yeah... I'm worried." ...|$|R

5000|$|ANN's Allen Divers wrote {{positive}} {{reviews of}} the anime, saying [...] "The beauty of Maison Ikkoku {{is the fact that}} the entire cast feels dynamic enough that each could be the center of an episode without pulling away from the main idea of the series." [...] and called it a must-see for fans of romantic comedies. Melissa Sternenberg of THEM Anime Reviews gave the show a perfect five star rating, calling the development between the two main characters refreshing and praising the supporting cast for reacting to what happens around them. Although she did point out the music and sound effects might seem dated. She finished saying [...] "There may never be [...] "the greatest anime series of all time," [...] <b>but</b> <b>I</b> would <b>bet</b> a good amount of money that this series would be on most (respected) anime viewers' top five lists." [...] TV Asahi released two Top 100 Anime lists in 2005; Maison Ikkoku came in 80 on the nationwide survey of multiple age-groups, and 89 on the web poll.|$|R
