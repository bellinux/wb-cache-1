40|$|The {{theoretical}} literature remains inconclusive {{on whether}} changes in <b>bank</b> <b>exposure</b> towards the domestic sovereign have an {{adverse effect on}} the sovereign risk position via a diabolic loop in the sovereign-bank nexus or reduce perceived default risk by acting as a disciplinary device for the sovereign. In this paper we empirically analyze the impact of exogenous changes in <b>bank</b> <b>exposure</b> on the risk position of the sovereign within a Markov switching structural vector autoregressive in heteroscedasticity (MSH-SVAR) framework {{for a set of}} EMU countries. We add to the methodological literature by allowing for regime dependent shock transmissions according to the volatility state of the financial system. Finding support for both, a stabilizing and a destabilizing effect, we document a clear clustering among the country sample: Rising <b>bank</b> <b>exposure</b> increased default risk for the EMU periphery, but decreased credit risk for the core EMU countries during times of financial stress...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{through what}} channels the euro crisis has affected firm valuations {{and what the}} efficacy of various policy interventions to mitigate the crisis has been. It examines stock price responses for 3045 non-financial firms in 16 countries to policy measures announced at four key events from 2010 to 2011. Using pre-crisis benchmarks, it separates effects arising from changes in financing conditions from those in trade and examines if bank or trade linkages propagated shocks across borders. It finds that measures impacted financially-constrained firms more, particularly in creditor countries with greater <b>bank</b> <b>exposure</b> to peripheral euro countries. The results carry through when we use <b>bank</b> <b>exposure</b> to the public sectors of peripheral euro countries. Trade linkages with peripheral countries played a minor role, although euro exchange rate movements led to some differential effects.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we explore the {{developments}} in cross-border <b>bank</b> <b>exposures</b> using the BIS international banking statistics. To this end, we treat the web of cross-border <b>bank</b> <b>exposures</b> as a “network”, investigate {{the characteristics of the}} network topology and compute various statistical measures for that topology. We find that the network of cross-border <b>bank</b> <b>exposures</b> has become more tightly connected over time. It now has higher connectivity, a shorter average path length, a higher average degree and a higher clustering coefficient than in the past. In particular, we observe that this tendency has never been hampered by any disturbances or crises in international financial markets (such as the East Asian currency crisis in 1997 or the LTCM near-default event in 1998). We see both costs and benefits from these developments in cross-border <b>bank</b> <b>exposures.</b> On the one hand, systemic risk in international financial markets is likely to increase because of the more direct and more widely spreading spillover effects of a crisis in one country once it occurs. On the other hand, the efficiency of international financial markets is expected to further improve in terms of capital and risk allocation. 1...|$|R

Furthermore, <b>bank</b> <b>exposure</b> to macroeconomic factors can explain differences in deposit withdrawals.

40|$|Previous {{empirical}} studies of secondary market discounts {{for developing countries}} have ignored important creditor country factors.

In fact, Basel II has led to a reduction in <b>bank</b> <b>exposure</b> to non-interest income and, at least in the case of banks opting for the high risk-sensitive Internal Rating Based (IRB) option within Basel II, decreased lending risk.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{consider}} the impact on bank risk of portfolio diversification between traditional margin income and fee-based income for banks operating in Australia. Design/methodology/approach – Considering several performance variables, this analysis compares the benefits of diversification across different bank types relative to margin income and fee income. Further, regression analysis considers bank risk and revenue concentration. Findings – This paper documents that fee-based income is riskier than margin income but offers diversification benefits to bank shareholders. While improving bank risk-return tradeoff, these benefits are of second order importance compared to the large negative impact of poor asset quality on shareholder returns. Practical implications – These results have implications for all stakeholders in Australian banks. The results suggest that shareholders of banks will benefit from increased <b>bank</b> <b>exposure</b> to non-interest income via diversification. From a regulatory perspective, diversification reduces the possibility of systemic risk, but caution must be offered with respect to banks pursuing absolute returns rather than monitoring risk-return trade-offs, and so exploiting the benefits of the implied guarantee offered by “too big to fail” However, shareholders should also monitor <b>bank</b> <b>exposure</b> to non interest income to ensure that they do not become over-exposed to the point where the volatility effect outweighs the diversification benefits. Originality/value – The results of this study suggest that Australian regulators should consider requiring increased disclosure of the composition of bank non-interest income. Such disclosure would aid in understanding the changing nature of banking in Australia. Given the recent sub-prime crisis in the USA and the role played by fee based income sourced from securitization, increased disclosure of the nature of bank non interest income is now of global importance. This disclosure is particularly germane within the context of the implementation of Basle II, with its increased emphasis upon market discipline, given that Stiroh found increased disclosure in this area is accompanied by improved market pricing for risk.

As we can see from Fig.  11, since QE, while bank lending activity(represented in red) has increased by the 5.83 %, <b>bank</b> financial <b>exposures</b> via debt securities (represented in blue) and equity (represented in yellow) to the euro area economy have decreased by 17.39 % and 6.26 %, respectively. Since the increase in bank lending activity was one of the intended intermediate objective of APP, we may interpret the increase in bank loans as a positive feedback of the implementation of Quantitative Easing. However, we wonder whether this increase is not too scarce against an injection of money into the banking system, that, at the end of June 2017, was equivalent to about 7 % of Monetary Financial Institutions excluding the Eurosystem total financial assets. Concerning debt securities, the decrease in bank security holdings, observed since QE, is not surprising, considering the massive purchases of private and public securities by the Eurosystem from the banking system. About the equity market, evidence on the Quantitative Easing implemented by the Fed suggests that the decrease in the returns of bonds, generated by the purchase programmes implemented in the US, made equity investments more attractive for investors, creating a great appeal for the equity market. [...] Despite the fact that our analysis does not allow us to observe the decline in the returns of bonds as a consequence of ECB’s QE, we can state that the decrease in euro area bank equity holdings seems to suggest that euro area Monetary Financial Institutions excluding the Eurosystem have not been subject to the aforementioned increased appeal for the equity market. As regards <b>bank</b> financial <b>exposures</b> via the analysed financial instruments broken down by counterparty sector, as shown in Figs.  12, 13 and 14, our estimate of growth rates of loans and deposits, debt securities, and shares and other equity held by Monetary Financial Institutions excluding the Eurosystem and received/issued by the different institutional sectors operating in the euro area provide us with the following findings. With particular reference to loans and deposits, as we can see from Fig.  12, since the implementation of QE, on the one hand, loans and deposits granted byMonetary Financial Institutions excluding the Eurosystem to i)Monetary Financial Institutions excluding the Eurosystem, ii)Non-Financial Corporations, iii)General Governments, and iv)Other Financial Institutions and Non-MMF Invesment Funds have decreased by 9.07 %, 1.42 %, 5.22 %, and 6.81 %, respectively. On the other hand, Insurance Corporations and Pension Funds, Households, and theEurosystem have benefited from an increase in bank loans and deposits by by 3.17 %, 3.51 %, and 513.42 %, respectively. Consequently, the empirical evidence provided by our results on loans and deposits allows us to state that there has been an increase in bank lending activity, but mostly addressed to the Eurosystem. [...] Moreover, aggregated estimates on bank interactions with the financial sector and the real sector via loans and deposits provide us with empirical evidence on the increase of <b>bank</b> <b>exposures</b> to the financial sector by 14.71 %, and on the slight increase of <b>bank</b> <b>exposures</b> to the real economy by 1.28 %. Concerning debt securities, Fig.  13 suggests that, since the implementation of QE, only bank debt securities issued by Non-Financial Corporations have increased (by 14.84 %), while security holdings issued by all the other institutional sectors (i.e., General Governments, Monetary Financial Institutions excluding the Eurosystem, Other Financial Institutions, and Insurance Corporations and Pension Funds), have decreased (by 14.26 %, 28.63 %, 11.46 %, and 18.07 %, respectively). [...] Moreover, a comparison between intra-financial and financial-real exposures via securities suggests that, since QE, bank interactions with the financial sector decreased by 21.44 %, while bank interactions with the real sector increased by 14.84 %. Lastly, estimates on bank equity holdings by issuing counterparty sector, represented in Fig.  14, suggest that, on the one hand, <b>bank</b> financial <b>exposures</b> via equity to Monetary Financial Institutions excluding the Eurosystem and Other Financial Institutions have increased by 14.40 % and 72.90 %, respectively. On the other hand, bank equity holdings issued by Non-MMF Investment Funds, Non-Financial Corporations, and Insurance Corporations and Pension Funds have decreased by 1.11 %, 22.42 %, and 22.41 %, respectively. Further, with reference to bank-financial interactions versus bank-real interactions via equity, it is worth mentioning that, while <b>bank</b> <b>exposures</b> to the financial sector have increased by 1.03 %, <b>bank</b> <b>exposures</b> to the real sector have decreased by 22.42 %. All in all, the empirical evidence coming from our investigation of the time evolution of financial linkages in the multilayer macro-network of the euro area reveals two main findings. First, since QE, there has been a comprehensive increase in the extent of bank interactions via loans and deposits, debt securities and equity with the different institutional sectors operating in the euro area. In particular, while both bank debt security and equity holdings have decreased, only bank lending activity has slightly increased. However, this increase is mainly due to the increased bank loans and deposits to the Eurosystem, rather than to the increased lending activity addressed to the real economy. Second, since QE, there has been an increase in <b>bank</b> <b>exposures</b> to the financial sector(by 3.56 %) and a very slight increase in <b>bank</b> <b>exposures</b> to the real sector (by 0.55 %).|$|R
