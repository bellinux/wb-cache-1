5|$|Art {{historian}} Charles de Tolnay believed that, {{through the}} seductive gaze of Adam, the left panel already shows God's waning influence upon {{the newly created}} earth.

40|$|Belt-positioning booster {{seats are}} {{recommended}} {{for children who}} use vehicle seat <b>belts</b> as primary restraints but who {{are too small to}} obtain good <b>belt</b> fit. Previous research has shown that belt-positioning boosters reduce injury risk, but the <b>belt</b> fit produced by the wide range of boosters in the US market has not previously been assessed. The present study describes the development of a method for quantifying <b>belt</b> fit with a Hybrid-III 6 -year-old test dummy. The measurement method was applied in a laboratory seat mockup to 31 boosters (10 in both backless and highback modes) across a range of <b>belt</b> geometries obtained from in-vehicle measurements. <b>Belt</b> fit varied widely across boosters. Backless boosters generally produced better lap <b>belt</b> fit than highback boosters, largely because adding the back component moved the dummy forward with respect to the lap <b>belt</b> routing guides. However, highback boosters produced more consistent shoulder <b>belt</b> fit {{because of the presence of}} <b>belt</b> routing guides near the shoulder. Some boosters performed well on both lap <b>belt</b> and shoulder <b>belt</b> fit. Lap <b>belt</b> fit in dedicated boosters was generally better than in combination restraints that also can be used with an integrated harness.

25|$|The {{flexibility}} of rubber is appealing in hoses, tires and rollers for devices ranging from domestic clothes wringers to printing presses; its elasticity makes it suitable for {{various kinds of}} shock absorbers and for specialized machinery mountings designed to reduce vibration. Its relative gas impermeability makes it useful {{in the manufacture of}} articles such as air hoses, balloons, balls and cushions. The resistance of rubber to water and to the action of most fluid chemicals has led to its use in rainwear, diving gear, and chemical and medicinal tubing, and as a lining for storage tanks, processing equipment and railroad tank cars. Because of their electrical resistance, soft rubber goods are used as insulation and for protective gloves, shoes and blankets; hard rubber is used for articles such as telephone housings, parts for radio sets, meters and other electrical instruments. The coefficient of friction of rubber, which is high on dry surfaces and low on wet surfaces, leads to its use for power-transmission <b>belting</b> and for water-lubricated bearings in deep-well pumps. Indian rubber balls or lacrosse balls are made of rubber.|$|E
25|$|During {{two seasons}} with the county, Chappell scored 2493 {{first-class}} runs at a moderate average of 30. Hitherto, Chappell bowled leg spin, but after his growth spurt had {{found it difficult to}} land the ball on a consistent length. The green pitches in England encouraged him to experiment with seam-up medium pace, which produced immediate results: he finished with 71 wickets for Somerset, including 7 for 40 against Yorkshire at Leeds in 1969. In his first season, he was capped by Somerset after <b>belting</b> the Middlesex attack for three hours in making 148. Shortly after was hit a severe blow to the eye when hooking at a bouncer from England fast bowler John Snow in a match against Sussex. In between these stints in England, Chappell scored 707 runs (including two centuries) in the 1968–69 Australian season, which made him a favourite to break into the Australian squad for the tour of India and South Africa. His subsequent omission in favour of West Australian unknown Jock Irvine cause a sensation at the time.|$|E
25|$|Although {{they had}} won the 1947–48 Sheffield Shield Western Australia were its weakest team (Tasmania was not yet included) and {{isolated}} {{from the rest of}} Australia, so they provided an easy start for the MCC's round of state matches. The WACA Ground would not see a Test match until the 1970-71 Ashes series, so this was the only occasion for the Perth crowd to see a Test team in action. Freddie Brown won the toss and elected to bat, only to see his openers Reg Simpson and David Sheppard out for 5 runs, surprised by the swing they had been told was rare in Australia. Gilbert Parkhouse was bowled at 25/3 and it took Denis Compton (106) and John Dewes (94) to restore the innings with a partnership of 183. The vice-captain was particularity pleased with his century as it silenced the critics who thought him unfit to play and he managed to run between the wickets and step out to drive the bowlers without any fuss. Brian Close made an unbeaten 108, his maiden first-class century, although he almost walked on 91 before he found that what he had thought was a catch had taken the ball over the boundary. Godfrey Evans (43) and Alec Bedser (42) helped him hit the ball around and Brown declared on 434/9. Doug Wright proved to have one of his more productive days, but his 7/60 failed to enforce the follow on by two runs as Western Australia reached 236 thanks to their captain Doug Carmody (59) and Chris Langdon (60). The MCC hustled up 121/3 in 124 minutes before Brown declared again and set the home team 320 to win in under three hours. Bedser was confined to bed with influenza and there was no fear of a result as Western Australia made 207/4 with Tom Outridge <b>belting</b> 3 sixes and 9 fours in his 92 with Close suffering 3/81 off 13 overs. This was the youngster's first proper bowl and it badly affected him and destroyed his confidence to bowl on Australian pitches where he could get little movement with the ball, to the point that Brown reserved him for the country matches after the Second Test. A disgruntled Gilbert Parkhouse had been shoved into the slip cordon, where he dropped three catches and the MCC's poor fielding soon lead to them being called Brown's Cows by the Australian press.|$|E
