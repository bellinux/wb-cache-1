In the United States and Canada, a commonly accepted guideline for housing affordability is a housing cost that does not exceed 30% of a household's gross income. Canada, for example, switched to a 25% rule from a 20% rule in the 1950s. In the 1980s this was replaced by a 30% rule. India uses a 40% rule.|$|E

40|$|The {{existence}} of a balanced supply of housing {{is vital to the}} economic and social health of a community. This includes the need for adequate and affordable housing for the local workforce and low- and moderate-income people of all ages. Presently, the lack of such a <b>balanced</b> <b>housing</b> stock in the Nashua region of southern New Hampshire (US) has reached the crisis stage. This situation is the result of nearly a decade of extremely rapidly rising housing costs that have not only made it virtually impossible for low-income households to enter the market but also have impacted many communities to the point where long-term residents are finding it difficult to remain. Another result is that affordable housing for the workforce is nearly nonexistent. There is universal agreement that the land-use ordinances and regulations are a significant factor in preventing the development of such housing. This project developed information that will allow interested individuals and community groups to help lay the groundwork for the development of affordable housing in the Nashua Region of southern New Hampshire (US). This is a community economic development project that consists primarily of policy development. The goals of the project have been to provide motivation and incentive for change, to provide necessary information to community members so they can address the issue locally, to develop an effective collaborative model and to facilitate subsequent activities toward <b>balanced</b> <b>housing</b> initiatives.

40|$|The {{impacts of}} {{economic}} crisis on the Czech housing market were, at least till now, relatively moderate. In comparison to other developed countries (e. g. Ireland, Spain, Greece, USA, Denmark, Hungary, Estonia, Latvia or Bulgaria) was {{the decrease in}} residential property prices only gradual and the default rate is lagging behind {{the average of the}} developed countries. The volatility in residential property prices could follow the accumulation of systemic risks of owner-occupied housing, especially the growing share of low-income households with mortgage debts among home-owners. The article therefore aims to answer following research questions. First, was there significant increase in the share of low-income households repaying their mortgages in the owner- occupied housing sector in the Czech Republic after 2005 ? Second, was there significant increase in ‘innovative’ mortgage products (e. g. interest-only mortgages, mortgages denominated in foreign currencies etc.) on the Czech mortgage market after 2005 ? Supplementary question was, whether <b>balanced</b> <b>housing</b> market, i. e. housing market with significant share of rental housing, {{could be one of the}} reasons of lower volatility in residential property prices, in comparison to housing market oriented mainly toward owner-occupied housing. The analysis showed that the hypothesis about sharply growing share of low-income households repaying mortgages in the owner-occupied housing sector in the Czech Republic after 2005 can be rejected. Also the share of ‘innovative’ mortgage products in the portfolios of Czech mortgage lenders seems to be rather negligible. Therefore we concluded that there is no evidence about significant accumulation of systemic risks on the Czech housing market. Moreover, the comparison of impacts of economic crisis in selected countries showed that <b>balanced</b> <b>housing</b> market could pose the best protection against negative impacts of economics crisis and against increased volatility in residential property prices...|$|E

To avoid this, we worked with a different modification. This does not require a complicated double furnace tube, as described by Ruth et al. [2] and Ulerich et al. [3].

40|$|This study, {{with its}} {{research}} question ‘To {{what extent is}} housing mix related to social sustainable development of new towns {{and what is the}} influence of housing mix on social sustainability in new towns?’ sets out to develop a critical understanding of and examine the relevance and desirability of incorporating customary housing mix practice in developing Hong Kong new towns to social sustainability through providing a detailed account of relationships between social mix concept and social sustainability concept as well as the influence of housing mix to new town development in social sustainability aspect. Both qualitative and quantitative methodological approaches were taken, including a questionnaire survey in a cluster sampling survey approach and a semi-structured interview, to collect data from 100 local public housing residents each at two study areas, Shatin and Tin Shui Wai, which were selected {{based on the assumption that}} one has better social sustainable development derived from a <b>balanced</b> <b>housing</b> mix, while one has lower level of social sustainability due to an imbalanced housing mix respectively. Data tabulation and content analysis were used to analyze data collected. Findings and analysis of this study suggest that the assumption of social interpersonal process brought by social mix in the same community is questionable and even not justifiable in the context of two study areas. From this perspective, there is no expectation that social mix would contribute to middle class role modeling and individual upward mobility. The interrelationship of level of mixing and the anticipated social outcomes of social mix in both towns are argued to be impractical. Thus, it further argues that social mix, in the context of both towns, does not promote social sustainability of new towns, from the fact that social cohesion is a vital aspect of social sustainability. Arising from these findings, implications are also drawn from the study that planners may have a relative weak role to plan for social development and the uncritically adoption of housing mix may shrink the production of public housings in future new town developments in view of a current huge public demand in Hong Kong. Although there are limitations in the research design and study scope and a tentative conclusion can only be reached with a selected angle of observation in this study, a more comprehensive and detailed exploration on interrelationship between social mix and sustainable development in new towns can be carried out in future is still recommended. It also proposes that forced heterogeneity should not be uncritically adopted by planners, who can study other planning tools to enhance other aspects of social sustainability of a new town. published_or_final_versionUrban Planning and DesignMasterMaster of Science in Urban Plannin...|$|E
40|$|PROBLEM STATEMENT Zoetermeer is a {{city that}} has gone through a very strong growth in fifty years time. Mainly young {{families}} with children have moved to Zoetermeer in the past decades to enjoy the quietness and space that the city offers. Once the construction of VINEX district Oosterheem will be completed in 2013, the city limits will be reached. In short this means that future additions to the dwelling stock will have to take place within the city limits. The locations that the city council has appointed as inner-city building sites in June 2005 are mainly suitable for the construction of apartment buildings. The composition of the population of Zoetermeer starts to look like an average city more and more. For example Zoetermeer is strongly aging. Children leave their parental home and find themselves a way through the housing market. Eventually parents will lose the need for the large family house that they have once moved in. In short there will be more and more small households in the future. This change means that the demands of the population will change as well. Research shows that partly because of these changes there is an increasing demand for apartments. Theoretically this should match with the mentioned changes in building typology. However, this is not recognized in the transaction figures for apartments in Zoetermeer. In fact for owner-occupied apartments and apartments in the free rental sector {{there seems to be a}} weak market. One can argue that there is a mismatch between what is provided and what is needed. Zoetermeer will have to anticipate the changes in the composition of the population the next few years as good as possible. Especially with the new constructions in the next few years it is critical that the desires of the people are met. A good flow of the different target groups is partly depending on this. This research tries to find an answer to the question what aspects contribute to the success of new apartment buildings in Zoetermeer. RESEARCH Despite of the upcoming aging different target groups indicate their preference for a single-family house (Companen, 2007). This is the case especially for the younger households and families. Smaller households between the age of 35 and 65 years and elderly prefer an apartment, but transaction figures show that only few households actually choose for an apartment. The quality of a dwelling will be an important condition for house hunters to choose an apartment nonetheless. The research question that results from this question is as follows: What is the qualitative demand on the apartment market in Zoetermeer en how can this be anticipated with the development of new complexes? Goal of the research The goal of this research is to contribute to a better match between the demand and supply of apartments in the owner-occupied and the free rental sectors in Zoetermeer by appointing factors of success and failure with new apartment buildings. By hunting down the precise demands for quality of the involved target groups and linking this to the factors of success and failure, recommendations for the future additions to the apartment stock can be formulated. The underlying intention is to better serve the inhabitants of Zoetermeer with their needs and thus contribute to a more <b>balanced</b> <b>housing</b> market in general. The recommendations will mainly be propositions of what qualities should be given to the future building projects in Zoetermeer. This can refer to many different aspects, like for example the size, the plan, the price and the location. To achieve the objective the research is divided in four stages, each with a sub question and sub goal. Stage 1 9 ̆ 5 Sub question: What does the mismatch look like? 9 ̆ 5 Sub goal: Mapping the current housing market of Zoetermeer. Stage 2 9 ̆ 5 Sub question: What are the theoretical housing preferences of apartment residents in Zoetermeer? 9 ̆ 5 Sub goal: Analyzing the current and future preferences according to the literature. Stage 3 9 ̆ 5 Sub question: What is the behavior of Zoetermeer residents? 9 ̆ 5 Sub goal: Determine housing preferences of house hunters on the basis of recently built apartment buildings. Stage 4 9 ̆ 5 Sub question: What are the potentials for future additions to the apartment stock? 9 ̆ 5 Sub goal: Determine factors of success and failure for future additions to the apartment stock. MARKET ANALYSIS Population Although Zoetermeer was known as a typical family city since the 60 s, the main conclusion of the period 2000 - 2012 is that the number of elderly households increases and the number of families decreases. Recently an increase in the number of young households has ben recognized as well. The expectation is that this number will not continue to increase but will decrease eventually and that the number of small households (30 - 55 years) will keep decreasing. Furthermore, the number of families keeps declining but the number of elderly households keeps growing. Especially the group 75 + will grow strongly after 2020, since the group babyboomers will reach that age about the same time. Especially after 2020 there will be a noticeably different housing need on city level with a strong focus on the growing number of elderly people. Since 2012 the group 55 - 75 year olds is even the largest group in Zoetermeer. Stock The present stock consists of 30, 000 single-family houses and 20, 000 apartments. That is a ratio of 60 / 40. With respect to surrounding cities the number of single-family houses compared to the number of apartments is relatively large. There, this ratio is 32 / 68. The present stock is characterized by a large supply of medium expensive owner-occupied dwellings and dwellings of the segment between the quality discount limit (8 ̆ 0366. 37) and the liberalization limit (8 ̆ 0 664. 66) (price level 2012). The dwellings are mostly spacious, with an above average supply of 90 m 2. The amount of owner-occupies apartments in the plans is higher than before, although the amount and number of owner-occupied single-family houses is much lower. THEORETICAL HOUSING PREFERENCES The housing market analysis in chapter 2 describes the current situation of the housing market of Zoetermeer. Also future predictions are being discussed for both the demand and the supply. On the basis of these predictions the future potentials are determined. The most important conclusion of the market analysis is that the focus of the coming years in Zoetermeer will largely lie on the elderly. Especially the preferences of this target group will have to be taken into consideration in future plans. The analysis also shows that in Zoeteremeer there is a relatively large tendency to move. This is an additional reason for policy. By putting together the different sources that have been cited in chapters 2 and 3 an overall picture for the future potentials of the apartment market of Zoetermeer can be composed. Price In the period up to 2009 the chances of the apartment market seemed to be in the social and medium expensive segments. Subsequently, many apartments in the medium price class have been built in the period after 2009. Due to this change in supply, the demand of the next few years will lie especially on the expensive owner-occupied apartments and the cheap rental apartments. 9 ̆ 5 Owner-occupied: 8 ̆ 0 200, 000 – 300, 000 9 ̆ 5 Rental: 8 ̆ 0 518 - 664 Dwelling size In general in Zoetermeer there is less need for new constructions of medium size dwellings and a greater need for variation, for example small and cheap or expansive but spacious. Less need for: 9 ̆ 5 Rental: 70 - 90 m 2 9 ̆ 5 Owner-occupied: 90 - 120 m 2 More need for: 9 ̆ 5 Variation Buyers generally have a preference for a four- of five-room apartment. Tenants prefer three of four rooms. Although the average size of households declines, the need for sufficient rooms remains. Even the smaller households have the need for at least one extra bedroom. 9 ̆ 5 Buyers: 4 or 5 rooms 9 ̆ 5 Tenants: 3 or 4 rooms ?

Part of {{the aim of this}} legislation was to combat ethnic ghettoization of neighborhoods. This act gave municipalities the right to deny housing to applicants on housing waiting lists that had received public benefits for 6 months or more in order to encourage unemployed immigrant populations to accept housing offers outside of areas with high concentrations of immigrants in an effort to diversify the composition of tenants in urban areas. This legislation aimed to <b>balance</b> <b>housing</b> waiting lists in cities such as Copenhagen with existing vacancies in geographic regions such as Jutland.|$|R

Data were aggregated at the municipality level with the procedure described in Cannari and Faiella (2008). Given that they are released every semester, we took a simple average over the whole year. In order to aggregate them at the LLM level, we use the 2007 local population as a weight.|$|R

Amsterdam even received the label ‘Just City’ as the large stock of social {{housing in the}} core of the city is said to increase societal equity. Within the Netherlands, however, the Greater Amsterdam housing market is perceived to be the most dysfunctional. As the discussion is fed by highly political and ideological perspectives, it is difficult to assess at face value how <b>balanced</b> the <b>housing</b> mix of a housing market is and to what extent it meets the community’s needs. Consequently, it is difficult to inform politicians about strategies that contribute to a healthy and sustainable housing mix and address the lack of affordable housing which is high on urban policy agendas worldwide. In an attempt to go beyond ideological and political discussions, the aim of this interdisciplinary paper is to develop a metric to measure and compare the theoretical <b>balance</b> of <b>housing</b> markets across regions and across groups of households based on income. The metric will be applied to the case of the Netherlands. The findings of the theoretical model show that large-scale provisions for low-income households may not always result in an improved <b>housing</b> market <b>balance...</b>|$|R

In the first place I introduced measures to satisfy all the requirements of PURES 2010 on the selected pattern-book house. Then I presented five additional actions that affect the further reduction of energy consumption in the house. The aim was {{to meet the requirements}} provided for by AN sNES. For analysing all the measures carried out, I used the program TEDI and TOST, which allow displaying of the energy <b>balance</b> of the <b>house.</b> Then I presented a way to use renewable energy in the house. After inclusion of all measures in the calculation of the energy <b>balance</b> of the <b>house,</b> I reached the energy saving building requirements that will be statutory defined in 2020...|$|R
