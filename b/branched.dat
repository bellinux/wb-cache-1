5|$|In DNA, fraying {{occurs when}} non-complementary regions exist {{at the end}} of an {{otherwise}} complementary double-strand of DNA. However, <b>branched</b> DNA can occur if a third strand of DNA is introduced and contains adjoining regions able to hybridize with the frayed regions of the pre-existing double-strand. Although the simplest example of <b>branched</b> DNA involves only three strands of DNA, complexes involving additional strands and multiple branches are also possible. <b>Branched</b> DNA can be used in nanotechnology to construct geometric shapes, see the section on uses in technology below.|$|E

The use of scanning electron microscopy {{has shown that the}} spines are 0.90–1.45µm long, rounded at the tip, narrow, tapered, and sometime joined together at the top. The capillitia (masses of thread-like sterile fibers dispersed among the spores) are <b>branched,</b> 3.5–6.5µm in diameter, and hyaline (translucent). The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are four- to eight-spored, with very short sterigmata. The basidia are arranged in long strings of clusters; individual basidia measure 11–15 by 18–24µm. The threads of the capillitia arise from the inner surface of the peridium, and are thick-walled, long, interwoven, and <b>branched,</b> measuring 3–5.5µm thick. The exoperidium (the outer layer of tissue, comprising the rays) is made of four distinct layers of tissue: the mycelial layer contains <b>branched</b> hyphae that are 4–6μm in diameter; the hyphae of the fibrous layer are 6–8μm diameter and branched; the collenchyma-type layer has <b>branched</b> hyphae of 3–4μm diameter; the soft layer contains hyphae that are 3–6μm in diameter.|$|E
