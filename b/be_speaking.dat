5|$|Alcibiades, however, did {{not succeed}} in persuading the satrap to ally with the Athenians, and, to hide this fact, demanded (claiming to <b>be</b> <b>speaking</b> for Tissaphernes) greater and greater {{concessions}} of them until they finally refused to comply. Disenchanted with Alcibiades but still determined to overthrow the democracy, Peisander and his companions returned to Samos, where the conspirators worked to secure their control over the army and encouraged a group of native Samian oligarchs to begin planning the overthrow of their own city's democracy. In Athens, meanwhile, a party of young oligarchic revolutionaries succeeded in gaining de facto control of the government through assassination and intimidation.|$|E

25|$|In Reformed theology, the Word of God {{takes several}} forms. Jesus Christ himself is the Word Incarnate. The prophecies about him {{said to be}} found in the Old Testament and the {{ministry}} of the apostles who saw him and communicated his message are also the Word of God. Further, the preaching of ministers about God is the very Word of God because God is considered to <b>be</b> <b>speaking</b> through them. God also speaks through human writers in the Bible, which is composed of texts set apart by God for self-revelation. Reformed theologians emphasize the Bible as a uniquely important means by which God communicates with people. People gain knowledge of God from the Bible which cannot be gained in any other way.|$|E
25|$|On October 21, 1835, the Boston Female Anti-Slavery Society {{announced}} that George Thompson would <b>be</b> <b>speaking.</b> Pro-slavery forces posted nearly 500 notices of a $100 reward for the citizen that would first lay violent hands on him. Thompson canceled {{at the last}} minute, and William Lloyd Garrison, a newspaper writer who spoke openly against the wrongs of slavery, was quickly scheduled to speak in his place. A lynch mob formed, forcing Garrison to escape {{through the back of}} the hall and hide in a carpenter's shop. The mob soon found him, putting a noose around his neck to drag him away. Several strong men intervened and took him to the Leverett Street Jail. Phillips, watching from nearby Court Street, was a witness to the attempted lynching.|$|E

25|$|In {{an effort}} to prepare her {{daughter}} Bernice, then only five years old, for the funeral, she {{tried to explain to}} her that the next time she saw her father he would be in a casket and would not <b>be</b> <b>speaking.</b> When asked by her son Dexter when his father would return, King lied and told him that his father had only been badly hurt. Senator Robert Kennedy ordered three more telephones to be installed in the King residence for King and her family to be able to answer the flood of calls they received and offered a plane to transport her to Memphis. Coretta spoke to Kennedy the day after the assassination and asked if he could persuade Jacqueline Kennedy to attend her husband's funeral with him.|$|E
25|$|If {{someone were}} {{to behave as}} if they {{understood}} a language which no-one else can make sense of, we might call this {{an example of a}} private language. It is not sufficient here, however, for the language to simply be one that has not yet been translated. In order to count as a private language in Wittgenstein's sense, it must be in principle incapable of translation into an ordinary language - if for example it were to describe those inner experiences supposed to be inaccessible to others. The private language being considered is not simply a language in fact understood by one person, but a language that in principle can only be understood by one person. So the last speaker of a dying language would not <b>be</b> <b>speaking</b> a private language, since the language remains in principle learnable. A private language must be unlearnable and untranslatable, and yet it must appear that the speaker is able to make sense of it.|$|E
25|$|While some whites {{responded with}} {{violence}} or exploitation of Mexicans, another recurring effort was Americanization. Since many Mexicans were now {{a part of}} the United States, it was expected that they would act like Americans. The national language in the U.S. is English, so it was thought that the Mexican Americans should <b>be</b> <b>speaking</b> English like the rest of Americans. In 1907, United States’ President Theodore Roosevelt wrote, “We have room for but one language in this country, and that is the English language, for we intend to see that the crucible turns our people out as Americans, of American nationality, and not as dwellers in a polyglot boarding house”. It was clear that a lot of Americans were hostile towards Spanish speaking Mexicans. The English Only movement is a political movement for establishing English as the only official language in the U.S., and using only English in official government operations. Learning a new language as an adult is a very difficult thing to do, so this effect of imperialism was challenging for a lot of new Americans.|$|E

25|$|On the peninsula, {{the effects}} of the {{continued}} contacts between the non-Malays with Malay-dominated centre is suggested in a 19th-century account of Pahang, which mentions that some of the natives who had strong trading ties with the Malays had begun to emulate their speech and dress. The population of Pattani also has been described as partly aboriginal in origin. In the case of Johor, the aboriginal people who were reported in the 19th century to <b>be</b> <b>speaking</b> Aslian languages, were called 'Malay' a century later. It has been suggested that these people would probably have joined the Jakun first before becoming Malay. The Jakun are described as being similar to Malays in their kinship arrangements, but resistant to aspects of social structure as well as the Islamic religion of the Malays. In 17th century Cambodia, a polity renowned for its Buddhism, king Ramathipadi I converted to Islam, took the name Muhammad Ibrahim, married a Malay Muslim of a princely Cham family, had his courtiers wear krisses and used Malay language in correspondence. During the same century in Champa, a once powerful Indianized polity but by that time retreating before the advancing Vietnamese, the rulers held the title Paduka Seri Sultan which is so common in the Malay polities. These rulers were in close contact with the peninsula, in particular Kelantan. French missionaries reported the presence of scribes and religious scholars from Kelantan right into the 19th century. It was believed that Kelantanese who eventually helped to give the Cham struggle against the Vietnamese, the character of a religious crusade.|$|E

500|$|Barney {{was born}} in 1876 in Dayton, Ohio, to Albert Clifford Barney and Alice Pike Barney. Her mother was of French, Dutch and German ancestry and her father {{was the son of}} a wealthy {{manufacturer}} of railway cars and of English descent. Her maternal grandfather's father was Jewish. When Barney was five years old her family spent the summer at New York's Long Beach Hotel where Oscar Wilde happened to <b>be</b> <b>speaking</b> on his American lecture tour. [...] Wilde scooped her up as she ran past him fleeing a group of small boys, held her out of their reach then sat her down on his knee and told her a story. The next day he joined Barney and her mother on the beach, where their conversation changed the course of Alice's life, inspiring her to pursue art seriously, despite, years later, her husband's disapproval. She later studied under Carolus-Duran and James McNeill Whistler. Many of Alice Pike Barney's paintings are now in the Smithsonian American Art Museum.|$|E
500|$|Okereke's lyrics {{attempt to}} {{juxtapose}} the monotonous events—nights out on club dancefloors {{and waiting for}} a train—with the seemingly epic experiences—terrorist attacks and racial angst—witnessed in a city environment. The direct narrative approach divided reviewers. BBC's Tom Young concluded, [...] "Some will appreciate Kele's openness and revel in his philosophical focus on modern lives... others will be too distracted by questionable content such as... lines about sudoku to take Okereke's grumbles into consideration." [...] Okereke has conceded that he was disappointed with the abstraction in Silent Alarm; he used The Smiths as inspiration {{to try to make}} a personal album with [...] "a real centre". The lyricist has noted, [...] "I wanted it to be a snapshot, a frozen moment in time. Like in a city, with thousands of stories going on at once, layered on top of each other... Although I might <b>be</b> <b>speaking</b> through the voice of a character, I'm still expressing, perhaps, my sentiments." ...|$|E

At the meeting, much to Harrison's annoyance, Lennon once more chose to have Ono speak on his behalf. Harrison then went to his parents' home in Warrington {{for a few days}} before imposing terms for his return to the band – namely, that McCartney's plans for a live concert be abandoned and the project be relocated to the Beatles' own Apple Studio, at London's Savile Row. Commentators have remarked on a change in Harrison's standing within the band {{as a result of his}} walkout, and later in 1969, Lennon and McCartney would <b>be</b> <b>speaking</b> admiringly of Harrison's growth as a songwriter.
