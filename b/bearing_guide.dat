40|$|Using linear gas <b>bearing</b> <b>guides</b> in a {{high vacuum}} environment, the common method to keep the vacuum quality is to exhaust the gas emitted by the bearing pads before leaking into the vacuum chamber. Thereby the exhaust tubes between the guide and the exhaust pumps should {{interfere}} with the guide {{as little as possible}} while maintaining a flexible connection and a highly effective exhaustion rate. A novel exhaust system that implements these requirements is described within this paper. The major achievement was the realization of two exhaust tubes slidable into one another combined with the known method of non-contact clearance seals, thus enabling an highly efficient and yet disturbance free exhaustion. This setup was developed and characterized at static and dynamic conditions. An analytical model for dimensioning the non-contact seal was worked out and experimentally verified. The number of seal stages and the clearance height were identified as the major impact factors on the leakage rate of the setup.

This paper discusses a system without friction that supplies air to an air <b>bearing</b> <b>guide</b> and initial functionality results of the elastically guided axis. Frictionless air supply to an air <b>bearing</b> <b>guide</b> When a compressed air flow is needed on board of an air <b>bearing</b> <b>guide,</b> a hose of a certain length is often required to provide the air supply. Besides on the length of the hose the magnitude of the flow depends on the speed of the air and on the diameter of the supply hose. In a case of a constant air speed, the diameter of the supply hose has to be increased when more flow is needed on board of the guide (e. g. when the guide contains many air bearings). This inevitably results in more bending and torsion stiffness in the hose, which is a source of disturbance during slide motion. Applying multiple hoses (with a smaller diameter) gives almost no improvement: the bending stiffness decreases but the air friction increases with the fourth power of the diameter. Multiple hoses may not contact while moving because friction causes hysteresis in the guide’s motion, which is often unacceptable. The hoses, often made from thermoplastic material, show relaxation and Bourdon action. The...|$|E

Each of the examples studied is from an actual pump which underwent a lower <b>guide</b> <b>bearing</b> failure. In each case the pump was operated for an extended period following the onset of the failure mechanism. This type of operation raises the question of its effect on the fatigue life of the pump shaft and other components.

There are several reasons for the frequency of these failures compared to failures in the other bearings. Collectively, the reasons may be summarized in that main coolant pumps are three-bearing machines, wherein the lower <b>guide</b> <b>bearing</b> has the weakest design of the three. Therefore, under conditions such as misalignment where all the bearings have higherthan-normal loads, it is the lower motor bearing that is most likely to fail...|$|R

Besides, an acoustic emission sensor has been located next to the fixed accelerometer in the bearing pedestal.

This permits to investigate the erosion process from a location which is directly connected to the blades. The advantage of such a situation is that the influence of the fluid film bearing and of the rotating frame of reference are avoided compared with measurements from a fixed position.

40|$|The {{success of}} {{flexible}} instruments in surgery requires high motion and force fidelity and controllability of the tip. However, the friction {{and the limited}} stiffness of such instruments limit the motion and force transmission of the instrument. In a previous study, we developed a flexible multibody model of a surgical instrument inside an endoscope in order to study {{the effect of the}} friction, bending and rotational stiffness of the instrument and clearance on the motion hysteresis and the force transmission. In this paper, we present the design and evaluation of an experimental setup for the validation of the flexible multibody model and the characterization of the instruments. A modular design was conceived based on three key functionalities: the actuation from the proximal end, the displacement measurement of the distal end, and the measurement of the interaction force.

However, up to now, how a component malpositioning and different soft-tissue anatomy changes TF knee kinematics was not yet fully investigated. The goal {{of this study was to}} evaluate how sensitive TF kinematics are to these factors during a simulated loaded squat for different TKA designs.

The reference models were then modified to simulate either component malpositioning in several directions or changes in ligaments geometry by change in the collateral ligament insertions. The results showed that, for all implant designs, TF kinematics were affected by changes in implant positioning and anatomical factors. While the ranges of motion predicted for all tested configurations were generally similar to the reference configuration for each type of TKA, the modifications resulted in shifts in the maximum and minimum values for the TF rotations and translations.

Each prosthesis was virtually implanted on the same cadaver leg model and it underwent a loaded squat, in 10 s, between 0 ° and 120 °, similar to several previous experimental tests performed on knee kinematics simulators. The aim of this examination {{was to investigate the}} sensitivity of the patello-femoral (PF) and tibio-femoral (TF) contact forces to patient-related anatomical factors, and component position in the different implant types.

The sensitivity analysis showed that PF contact forces are mostly affected by patella height (increases up to 67 % for one TKA type in patella-alta configuration), by an anterior tibial component translation (increases up to 30 %), and by patellar component tilting (increases up to 29 %); TF contact forces are mostly affected by the anterior displacement of the insertion points of the medial collateral ligament with respect to the reference position (increases up to 48 %).

This drug delivery system consists of a low flow pump which shall be implanted in the human body to relieve pain.

40|$|In 2005 a {{vertical}} 42 MW hydropower unit was upgraded in Sweden. The upgrade included the fitting {{of a new}} turbine <b>guide</b> <b>bearing,</b> a modified runner, a modified turbine regulator and a new brushless exciter. One of the requirements was that the dynamic behaviour of the machine should not be affected. In spite of the requirements, resonance problems became apparent after the hydropower unit was re-commissioned. Measurements from the re-ommissioning showed poor alignment of the shaft system and shape deviations in the generator. The exchange of the turbine <b>guide</b> <b>bearing</b> from a sleeve bearing to a block bearing also caused changes in the machines dynamic behaviour. Measurements on the unit were conducted at normal operation and resonance. These show that at normal operation, the machine has dominant frequencies at the nominal speed and at twice the nominal speed. When the machine goes into resonance, the dominant frequencies increase to approx. 2. 4 times the nominal speed. The machine will undergo a major overhaul in ten years. The objective {{is to find a}} solution of the resonance problem that is both inexpensive and possible to implement. The conclusion was drawn that the low damped eigenmode at 2. 4 times the nominal speed had been excited and caused the machine to go into resonance. The unit's dynamic sensitivity to different bearing settings was investigated numerically and with tests on site, i. e. bearing clearances were varied. The calculated result was verified against measured resonance frequencies. Agreement between the estimated and measured result was good. Other possible measures to rectify the resonance problems were also analyzed numerically. The effect of making the surrounding structures more rigid, the installation of additional <b>guide</b> <b>bearings,</b> making the shaft system more rigid, etc. were examined. A temporary solution, used for the last six months, is to operate the machine with larger bearing clearances on all bearings.

No problems related to resonance have occurred at the hydropower unit during the last six months. Godkänd; 2008; Bibliografisk uppgift: CD-ROM; 20081111 (ysko) </p...|$|R
