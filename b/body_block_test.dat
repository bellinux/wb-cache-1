3000|$|To {{formulate}} compound queries, {{we first}} formulate half-length simple queries by Algorithm  3, whose length is between σ _qmax/ 2 and σ _qmin/ 2, from each <b>body</b> <b>block</b> Bi as their component query set C_i. For example, {{from the second}} <b>body</b> <b>block</b> in Fig.  1, two component queries are generated: “It {{was the best of}} Twitter It” and “was the worst of Twitter” given σ _qmax = 14 and σ _qmin = 4. We then formulate compound queries by (1) selecting two <b>body</b> <b>blocks</b> containing any unused component query and (2) combining a component query in the first block with a space character and another component query from the second one. For example, in the case shown in Fig.  1, two component queries, “JAMES C BEST JR THE NEW YORK TIMES” from the first <b>body</b> <b>block</b> and “It was the best of Twitter It” from the second, are combined into one compound query, i.e., “JAMES C BEST JR THE NEW YORK TIMES” “It was the best of Twitter It”. When there remains no component query in one of the two <b>body</b> <b>blocks,</b> we select another <b>body</b> <b>block</b> according to the occurring order. Note that if only some component queries from one <b>body</b> <b>block</b> are left, we combine component queries from the single block [...]...|$|R

5000|$|Known as the <b>Body</b> <b>Block</b> {{and as the}} Charles <b>Body</b> <b>Block,</b> the {{building}} was {{also referred to as}} the [...] "Old Smith Arcade" [...] due to its resemblance to Smith's Cleveland Arcade. Goodrich-Kirtland Park was largely a rural area when annexed by the city of Cleveland in 1850. It began to urbanize in the 1870s and 1880s, and the <b>Body</b> <b>Block</b> was constructed {{in the middle of the}} 20-year period that marked the neighborhood's swiftest growth and height (in terms of population). Located at the intersection of two major thoroughfares, it catered to middle class individuals and families and made a significant contribution to the retail and residential life of the area.|$|R

30|$|Simple queries from <b>body</b> <b>blocks</b> {{sometimes}} {{are not so}} discriminative. For example, in Fig.  3 a, the first long paragraph quotes a review from Hollywood Report and the second long paragraph quotes a review from The Wrap. The queries that come from such a paragraph will retrieve the original reports or some other articles that use the quote too. Fortunately we find that it is less likely that two paragraphs from two different articles are all the same. Thus, we propose composing Compound queries rather than Simple queries for <b>body</b> <b>blocks.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>Body</b> <b>Block,</b> {{also known}} as the Charles <b>Body</b> <b>Block</b> and as the Old Smith Arcade, is a {{historic}} mixed-use building located on the northwest corner of the intersection of Payne Avenue and E. 55th Street in the Goodrich-Kirtland Park neighborhood of Cleveland, Ohio, in the United States. Erected from 1892 to 1893, the Queen Anne style structure was built for Charles Body, owner of a local wallpaper store. It underwent a major renovation from 1994 to 1995, and was added to the National Register of Historic Places on September 18, 1998.|$|R
30|$|Overall, the CRF {{method is}} much better than {{heuristic}} rules in labeling blocks. Table  2 shows that the Heuristic method performs badly on title prediction in terms of precision (only 0.34). It is partially because about a half of screenshots do not contain a title, but the Heuristic method selects one anyway. Such a decision somehow hurts the recall of <b>body</b> <b>blocks.</b> Thus {{it is not surprising that}} the Heuristic method performs worse than the CRF method in terms of recall for <b>body</b> <b>blocks.</b> The Heuristic method is also worse than the CRF method by 21 points in terms of precision for bodies. This is strong evidence that the Heuristic method is not effective in distinguishing a <b>body</b> <b>block</b> from other blocks, whereas, the CRF method achieves precision as high as 0.967. The CRF method is also effective in identifying a title block while rejecting others as it achieves 0.928 precision for titles.|$|R
30|$|We {{propose a}} general {{framework}} {{to solve the}} problem. Specifically, we propose methods to segment a screenshot into semantic blocks, labeling title and <b>body</b> <b>blocks,</b> formulating effective queries, and aggregating search results.|$|R
50|$|After {{three years}} at Cornell, Warner {{returned}} to Carlisle. He considered his second stint there his best. From 1907 to 1914, the team won ten or more games a season five times.During this time at Carlisle, Warner made several significant contributions to football offense, including the <b>body</b> <b>block</b> technique and the single- and double-wingback formations. Under Warner, Carlisle quarterback Frank Mount Pleasant and fullback Pete Hauser became two of the first regular spiral passers in football (the forward pass was legalized in 1906).

30|$|Overall, we adopt {{a hybrid}} {{approach}} where different query formulation strategies are used {{depending on the}} attributes of blocks. As shown in Fig.  2 c, for <b>body</b> <b>blocks,</b> we use compound queries, whereas, for title and other blocks, we still use simple queries. The reason {{is that it is}} risky to combine a high quality block with a low quality block. A title block usually generates high quality queries, which are usually discriminative enough to identify the article, whereas most “others” blocks generate low quality queries. But we may lose useful queries if ignoring “others” blocks because some of them, such as a <b>body</b> <b>block</b> misclassified as others, are useful. Therefore, we apply the simple query formulation for title and others.|$|R
40|$|Blog is {{becoming}} an increasingly popular media for information publishing. Besides the main content, most of blog pages nowadays also contain noisy information such as advertisements etc. Removing these unrelated elements can improves user experience, but also can better adapt the content to various devices such as mobile phones. Though template-based extractors are highly accurate, they may incur expensive cost in {{that a large number}} of template need to be developed and they will fail once the template is updated. To address these issues, we present a novel template-independent content extractor for blog pages. First, we convert a blog page into a DOM-Tree, where all elements including the title and <b>body</b> <b>blocks</b> in a page correspond to subtrees. Then we construct subtree candidate set for the title and the <b>body</b> <b>blocks</b> respectively, and extract both spatial and content features for elements contained in the subtree. SVM classifiers for the title and the <b>body</b> <b>blocks</b> are trained using these features. Finally, the classifiers are used to extract the main content from blog pages. We test our extractor on 2, 250 blog pages crawled from nine blog sites with obviously different styles and templates. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of our extractor.

40|$|Aims: To {{measure the}} force {{required}} to dislodge three different orthodontic temporary anchorage devices (TADs) from artificial <b>test</b> <b>blocks</b> and {{to investigate whether}} varying the cortical thickness of the <b>test</b> <b>block</b> will affect these forces. Materials and Method: The TADs were embedded into <b>test</b> <b>blocks</b> consisting of polyurethane foam, laminated with either 2 mm or 3 mm short-fibre-filled epoxy sheets and a horizontal dislodging force applied, using an Instron universal testing machine. The maximum force applied before the TAD was fully dislodged was recorded. Three TADs were tested: InfinitasTM, Ancor ProTM and Ortho ImplantTM. 150 of each design were tested in the 2 mm thickness <b>test</b> <b>block</b> and a further 150 of each were tested in the 3 mm thickness <b>test</b> <b>block.</b> Results: The mean force required was 468 N in the 2 mm <b>test</b> <b>blocks</b> and 567 N in the 3 mm <b>test</b> <b>blocks.</b> No significant difference was observed between the InfinitasTM and Ancor ProTM TADs, however {{there was a significant}} difference (P> 0. 05) between both of these TADs and the Ortho ImplantTM.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{investigate}} if a well-compensated unilateral peripheral vestibular hypofunction could {{interfere with}} navigation tasks on memorized routes in humans. METHODS: After a complete otoneurological investigation, fifty labyrinthine-defective patients and fifty controls {{were invited to}} visually memorize three different routes (a triangle, a circle and a square) on a grey carpet and then to walk along them with eye closed clockwise and counter-clockwise (mental map navigation). The same test was then repeated with eye open (actual navigation) and again with eye closed (mental navigation). Execution time was recorded in each <b>test.</b> Corsi <b>block</b> <b>test</b> and a psychiatric questionnaire completed the neuropsychological examination. RESULTS: Labyrinthine-defective patients showed higher levels of anxiety and depression and performed Corsi <b>block</b> <b>test</b> with more difficulties than controls. Patients spent more time than controls {{in the first and}} third session (eye closed). No difference was recorded between clockwise and counter-clockwise navigation tasks both in patients and in controls. Patients showed a greater improvement in the third navigation task than controls. CONCLUSION: Walking on memorized routes in non-visual condition is impaired by a peripheral vestibular damage, even if patients are well compensated.
