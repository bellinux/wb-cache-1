40|$|The bottom charged side {{spillway}} is a {{new concept}} of spillway in which the excess water is spilled from the bottom level which is sediment rich water and the cleanest quality of water {{is sent to the}} turbine. It is different in a sense that it will remove sediments as well while getting rid of the excess water different than the conventional spillways which will spill the cleanest quality of water. The concept was developed by Professor Haakon Støle and so far not much work has been done concerning the concept. The main objective of the present study is to prepare a design guideline for bottom charged side spillway. Hydraulic Model Study Different calculations have been done for the design of canal, intake, surface charged spillway and bottom charged spillway considering different considerations. Detail design drawings were prepared based on design and model was constructed at NTNU/SINTEF lab. The present model of bottom charged spillway consists of the following modules. • Inlet arrangement. • Upstream canal section. • Surface charged side spillway section. • Bottom charged side spillway section. • Downstream canal section. • Outlet arrangement. • Instrumentation and measuring arrangements. Since the study is of a new concept, there has been no real prototype for the model but for ease of calculation and making the study more realistic all the calculations has been started considering some imaginary values. The prototype dimensions were then converted to model dimensions using Froude’s model law. Model Test Result It is observed from the study that the bottom charged spillway can be an efficient alternative for effectively spilling the excess water and parallel flushing of the sediments as well. The design of the model was conducted using different approaches. Since not much literature was available about the concept, some assumptions were made to proceed the design. Different approaches of general spillway approach, submerged side orifice approach and side spillway approaches were applied with modifications for bottom entry losses. The attempt were made to figure the relation for more accurate calculation. Some relations concerning the calculation of bottom entry losses were derived based on the model study but these need to be refined for better results. The most favorable approach by the model test was found to be the approach of side spillway with additional effect of bottom orificelosses. The calculation with side spillway approach gave less variation with the actual observed values. Downstream spillway end point was considered as the control point for the design. The depth and the Froude number at this point is the starting data for the design. The variation in the nature of flow among the surface charge spillway and <b>bottom</b> <b>charge</b> spillway was not observed. Hence {{it can be said that}} the <b>bottom</b> <b>charge</b> spillway will not add disturbances to the flow in canal. There is development of high turbulence at the spill pool due to which the flushing of the sediments may not be a problem. </p...|$|E

Several blast operations were conducted using both traditional and modified blasting design parameters on the same ore bench with the same geological conditions. Loading times of the shovel and fragment sizes were obtained after the blasts from ore bench where both the traditional and modified blasting design parameters were applied.

40|$|One of the {{important}} questions in silicon (Si) based thin film applications (solar cells, for example) is how to prepare Si layers of acceptable electronic quality on low cost substrates such a glass. As a contrary to hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H), mainly because of its stability against light exposure, microcrystalline silicon (c-Si:H) is intensively studied as a material perspective for thin film solar cell fabrication. This thesis {{is devoted to the}} experimental study of c-Si:H, namely, {{with the help of the}} surface photovoltage (SPV) method. First important aim of the thesis was to build an experimental set-up of the SPV method for the measurement of the carrier diffusion length in c-Si:H. Then we describe the way to minimize the basic problem of c-Si:H growth (the existence of the "incubation layer"). While device-quality a-Si:H dramatically delays nucleation of microcrystallines, the defective a-Si:H prepared by single pulse laser annealing with an ArF excimer laser represents a good nucleation seed layer for the growth of c-Si:H, which can eliminate the influence of the incubation layer. Next, we have developed a new SPV evaluation procedure which allows us to evaluate the diffusion length in thin c-Si:H samples exhibiting an important light scattering effect. The new procedure allows us to deduce not only the diffusion length, but also the depth of the depletion layer at the sample surface and the recombination coefficients at both the top and bottom interfaces of the c-Si:H films deposited on different substrates. Moreover, we have revealed charge transport anisotropy in a series of c-Si:H samples by comparing dark conductivities and diffusion lengths measured in parallel and perpendicularly to the substrate. Finally, we have studied by SPV measurements thick (d= 10 m) layers of undoped c-Si:H grown on different substrates. In a layer grown on p+ crystalline silicon (c-Si) substrate the surface photovoltage as a function of the absorption coefficient (?) is characterized by a distinct peak at low ? region. We present a mathematical model that enables us to ascribe this peak to the charge separation in the <b>bottom</b> space <b>charge</b> region at the interface c-Si:H/p+c-Si. We suggest using the SPV method to detect the occurence of the <b>bottom</b> space <b>charge</b> region also in solar cells where it may influence strongly their performanceAvailable from STL Prague, CZ / NTK - National Technical LibrarySIGLECZCzech Republi...|$|R
