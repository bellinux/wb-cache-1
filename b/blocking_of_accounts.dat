25|$|Because Rhodesian exports were {{generally}} competitive and {{had previously been}} entitled to preferential treatment on the British market, the former colony did not recognise the need for escalating the pace of diversification before independence. Following the UDI, however, Rhodesia began to demonstrate {{that she had the}} potential to develop a greater degree of economic self-sufficiency. After the Rhodesian Front began introducing incentives accorded to domestic production, industrial output expanded dramatically. A rigid system of countermeasures enacted to combat sanctions succeeded in blunting their impact for at least a decade. Over the next nine years Rhodesian companies, spiting the freezing of their assets and <b>blocking</b> <b>of</b> overseas <b>accounts,</b> also perfected cunning techniques of sanctions evasion through both local and foreign subsidiaries, which operated on a clandestine trade network.|$|R

Hajduk entered that year's UEFA Champions League with a mix of young upcoming stars Milan Rapaić, Ivica Mornar, Tomislav Erceg, Goran Vučević and experienced players such as Igor Štimac, Zoran Vulić, Aljoša Asanović and Tonči Gabrić returning to assist them. After entering the group stage, Hajduk finished second behind Benfica, ahead of Steaua București and Anderlecht, before losing in the quarter-finals to eventual champions Ajax (0-0, 0-3). Domestically, the club won its first and (as of yet) last double crown. However, even though the team was performing well, the club was financially poorly managed, accumulating a massive financial loss that led to <b>blocking</b> <b>of</b> club's <b>account.</b>|$|R

Our paper investigates the issue of routing of dynamic connections in WDM networks which are also loaded with high-priority protected static connections. By discrete-event simulation we compare various routing strategies in terms <b>of</b> <b>blocking</b> probability and we propose a new heuristic algorithm based on an occupancy cost function which takes several possible causes <b>of</b> <b>blocking</b> into <b>account.</b> The behavior <b>of</b> this algorithm is tested in well-known case-study mesh networks, with and without wavelength conversion.

These pictures of the universe within the nucleon challenge our comprehension of the underlying theory of quark and gluon dynamics (quantum chromodynamics – QCD) {{and at the same time}} put us face to face with fundamental questions, such as: What is the shape of the nucleon?

25|$|By early 1945 it {{was clear}} that the price {{controls}} which had been introduced to control inflation had only served to boost the black market and prices continued to move ever upwards. By this time the army had swelled to over 1.2 million men and almost half of state expenditure was going to military spending. De Gaulle was faced with his first major ministerial dispute when the very able but tough-minded economics minister Pierre Mendès France demanded a programme of severe monetary reform which was opposed by the Finance Ministry headed by Aime Lepercq, who favoured a programme of heavy borrowing to stimulate the economy. When de Gaulle, knowing there would be little appetite for further austerity measures sided with Lepercq, Mendès France tendered his resignation, which was rejected because de Gaulle knew he needed him. Lepercq was killed in a road accident a short time afterwards and was succeeded by Pleven, but when in March, Mendès France asked unsuccessfully for taxes on capital earnings and for the <b>blocking</b> <b>of</b> certain bank <b>accounts,</b> he again offered his resignation and it was accepted.|$|R
