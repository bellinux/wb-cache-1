40|$|Abstract: To {{determine}} the {{bending fatigue strength}} of precision forged spur gears and to compare the results with those obtained from conventional cut gears, single tooth bending fatigue tests were carried out on both through-hardened and induction-hardened gear teeth. The gears were produced from rolled <b>bar</b> <b>cut</b> blanks, disc forged blanks or precision forged teeth blanks. For this purpose, a special test fixture was designed and built for an Amsler high-frequency vibrophore fatigue testing machine. The {{results show that the}} endurance limit of precision forged gears is significantly higher than those obtained from cut gears. The bending fatigue strength of forged gears was some 12. 5 per cent higher than the cut teeth in a through-hardened condition and 8. 4 per cent higher for the induction-hardened teeth. The eVect of surface roughness at the tooth root area on the bending fatigue strength of the forged gears is also shown...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects are}} {{assessed}} of TiB 2 reinforcement and parent alloy Li content on the weldability of Weldalite (tm) 049 type alloys. Welding trials were performed using either AC or DC polarity gas tungsten arc (GTA) welding according to described procedures. The welding was performed {{under conditions of}} high restraint on 5 cm (2 in) wide x 25. 4 cm (10 in) long plates machined from the 0. 952 cm (0. 375 in) extruded bar parallel to the extrusion direction. A 37. 5 deg bevel was machined on the center edge of the extruded <b>bar.</b> <b>Cut</b> rod filler wire was machined from three alloys, and one commercially available 2319 filler wire was also used. The preliminary assessment of the weldability revealed no propensity for hot cracking under conditions of high restraint. This result is significant, because hot cracking has been reported for all other leading aluminum lithium alloys welded with certain conventional filler alloys. The strengths for Weldalite parent welded with parent filler obtained were higher than those for alloys used in launch systems, such as 2219 and 2014 welded with 2319 and 4043 fillers, respectively. Even higher values were obtained by variable polarity plasma arc welding (e. g., 54 ksi (372 MPa) mean tensile strength) ...|$|E
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Civil EngineeringHayder RasheedThe {{technology}} of FRP strengthening has matured {{to a great}} extent. However, there is always room for performance improvements. In this study, external bonding of GFRP and near surface mounting (NSM) of regular steel bars is combined to improve the behavior, delay the failure, and enhance {{the economy of the}} strengthening. E-Glass FRP is selected due to its inexpensive cost and non-conductive properties to shield the NSM steel bars from corrosion. On the other hand, the use of NSM bars gives redundancy against vandalism and environmental deterioration of the GFRP. An experimental program is conducted in which four rectangular cross-section beams are designed, built, and tested in four-point bending. The first beam is tested as a control beam failing at about 12. 24 kips. The second beam is strengthened using two # 5 steel NSM bars and 1 layer of GFRP, both extending to the support. This beam failed at 31. 6 kips. The third beam is strengthened with the same system used for the second beam. However, the NSM steel bars were cut short covering 26 % of the shear-span only while the GFRP was extended to the support. This beam failed at 30. 7 kips due to reaching the full flexural capacity of the section at the NSM bars cut off point and the shear stress concentration at the steel <b>bar</b> <b>cut</b> off point. The fourth beam was strengthened with same system as the third beam but then submerged in a highly concentrated saline solution for six months and then tested. This beam failed at a maximum applied load of 29. 8 kips, which shows that the GFRP sheet provided good corrosion resistance from the saline solution...|$|E

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Civil EngineeringHayder A. RasheedNowadays, {{using the}} {{technology}} of FRP strengthening has become acknowledged by engineers and has reached a full acceptance. However, researchers {{are always looking for}} improvement in performance. In this study, external bonding of GFRP and near surface mounting of regular steel bars are combined to improve the behavior, delay the failure and enhance the economy of the strengthening. E-Glass FRP is selected due to its inexpensive cost and non-conductive properties to shield the NSM steel bars from corrosion. On the other hand, the use of NSM bars gives redundancy against vandalism and environmental deterioration of GFRP. An experimental program was conducted in which four full scale T beams were designed and built. All four specimens were fabricated with Grade 70 steel reinforcement and 8000 psi concrete. Only one beam was loaded beyond first cracking then exposed to highly concentrated deicing salt water to accelerate the corrosion process. All beams were tested by monotonic loading until failure. The load rate was 1 kips/min. The first specimen is tested as a control beam failing at about 15 kips. The second specimen is strengthened using two # 5 steel NSM bars and 1 layer of GFRP, both extending to the support. This beam failed at 38. 4 kips by GFRP debonding. The third specimen is strengthened with the same system used for the second beam. However, the NSM steel bars were cut short covering only 30 % of the shear-span while the GFRP was extended to the support. This beam failed at 25. 9 kips by GFRP debonding and NSM delamination {{due to the lack of}} sufficient development of the NSM steel bars and the shear stress concentration at the steel <b>bar</b> <b>cut</b> off point. Nevertheless, the fourth beam is strengthened with the same system used for the third beam. The fourth specimen was exposed to severe attack of deicing salt by immersing it in concentrated deicing salt solution for three continuous months. In order to accelerate the corrosion process, the beam was loaded beyond its cracking load before the corrosion procedure. After the completion of the three months, the beam was tested monotonically to failure. It failed at 23. 2 kips indicating that some deterioration might have taken place. The failure mode was by GFRP debonding and NSM delamination like the case of Beam 3. However, it was observed after failure that the NSM bars were very well protected by the surrounding epoxy...|$|E

40|$|An {{experimental}} study {{was carried out}} to evaluate {{the possibility of using}} the antiresonances of flexural vibrating bars to detect cracks or cuts. Two groups of bars, cracked <b>bars</b> and <b>cut</b> <b>bars,</b> were considered. The flexural vibrations of each free-free constrained bar, excited using the impulsive technique, were experimentally analysed measuring the accelerations in each excitation point. The distribution of the first antiresonance frequencies vs the position of impact/measurement points was then plotted, and the correlation with the corresponding n-th mode shape was found. The defect position corresponded to the areas in the plot where this distribution is discontinuous and it is determined with an uncertainty of ± 2 % of the bar length. These results confirm that, in laboratory experiments, the flexural behaviour of <b>cut</b> <b>bars</b> {{is similar to that of}} cracked ones. From a diagnostic point of view, this method can be used together with other methods that use resonances to detect defects...|$|R
