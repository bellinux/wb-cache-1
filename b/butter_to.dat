25|$|Clarified {{butter is}} butter with {{almost all of}} its water and milk solids removed, leaving almost-pure butterfat. Clarified butter is made by heating <b>butter</b> <b>to</b> its melting point and then {{allowing}} it to cool; after settling, the remaining components separate by density. At the top, whey proteins form a skin, which is removed. The resulting butterfat is then poured off from the mixture of water and casein proteins that settle to the bottom.|$|E

25|$|Meehan was {{questioned}} {{in relation to}} the 1971 Scottish soldiers' killings but never charged. In the six weeks following the beginning of Operation Demetrius in August 1971, six soldiers from the Green Howards regiment were killed by the IRA in north Belfast. Meehan {{became one of the most}} wanted IRA members in the area, and when arrested he was badly beaten by soldiers and needed 47 stitches to the back of his head. Meehan was imprisoned without charge under the Special Powers Act in Crumlin Road Jail. Meehan and two other IRA members including Joe B. O'Hagan escaped from prison on 2 December 1971. The men covered themselves in <b>butter</b> <b>to</b> keep warm, then hid inside a manhole for six-and-a-half hours before scaling the prison walls using ropes made from knotted blankets and sheets.|$|E
25|$|To make hollandaise sauce, {{the eggs}} yolks are {{separated}} {{and added to}} a butter base with small amounts of water, vinegar or lemon juice with pepper, heated together slowly over a double boiler. A stainless steel bowl over a sauce pan {{with a small amount}} of water may also be used. The water should not touch the bowl or boil, just simmer. The key to the recipe is to heat the ingredients without curdling the egg. Add the egg and liquid ingredients first and whisk together with a wire whisk until frothy. Add the egg and liquid froth to the double boiler of the simmering water and whisk quickly and continuously. The mixture will expand a few times. Remove from the heat source and begin adding warm, melted, clarified <b>butter</b> <b>to</b> the mixture. If the sauce cools too much the butter will begin to thicken. If this or separation begins to occur, a few drops of hot water can solve this issue.|$|E
25|$|Except for the {{province}} of Skane, on the southernmost tip of Sweden which was under Danish control during this time, feudalism never developed in Sweden {{as it did in}} the rest of Europe. Therefore, the peasantry remained largely a class of free farmers throughout most of Swedish history. Slavery (also called thralldom) was not common in Sweden, and what slavery there was tended to be driven out of existence by the spread of Christianity, the difficulty in obtaining slaves from the lands east of the Baltic Sea, and by the development of cities before the 16th century Indeed, both slavery and serfdom were abolished altogether by a decree of King Magnus Erickson in 1335. Former slaves tended to be absorbed into the peasantry and some became laborers in the towns. Still, Sweden remained a poor and economically backward country in which barter was the means of exchange. For instance, the farmers of {{the province}} of Dalsland would transport their <b>butter</b> <b>to</b> the mining districts of Sweden and exchange it there for iron, which they would then take down to the coast and trade the iron for fish they needed for food while the iron would be shipped abroad.|$|E

The Standishes and most of the Speedwell passengers crowded into the Mayflower, and the Speedwell went on to London to be resold, now with only a few passengers. (She subsequently made numerous successful journeys as a cargo vessel for her new owners, but never sailed to the New World.)

The night before sailing, however, a ship wright or carpenter known as Maurice Mac Neil (the second name sometimes given as MacNiall or MacArill), by some accounts Somerled's nephew, secretly bored holes in the hull of Olav’s ship using tallow and <b>butter</b> <b>to</b> temporarily seal them. On entering the open seas the tallow was washed away {{by the action of}} the waves and the king’s ship began rapidly taking on water. Olav’s urgent appeal for help was spurned by Somerled, until he consented to the previously sought marriage. Maurice then boarded the King’s ship and filled the holes with wooden plugs he had previously prepared for the purpose. From that time the descendants of Maurice were called “MacIntyres,” “carpenters (or shipwrights) sons”.”, ...|$|E

500|$|The Cardiff City {{victory in}} the 1927 FA Cup Final remains {{the only time that}} the trophy has been won by a team outside England. At the time it had been {{referred}} to as the [...] "English Cup". This was a highlight of the coverage in the press afterwards, as was the volume of singing that took place during the proceedings. The article in the Hull Daily Mail even went as far as to suggest that the match would be remembered for the singing specifically, calling it the [...] "Singing Final". There was an open air radio broadcast of the match in Cathays Park attended by 15,000 fans, and after the victory the team's colours were strung throughout the city, and local shopkeepers made replicas of the trophy out of <b>butter</b> <b>to</b> display in shop windows. After the match, the Cardiff team headed to a hotel in Bloomsbury before heading to Windsor and Eton College on the following day. They toured the College, and some of the players visited Windsor Castle. They headed back to Cardiff later that day from Paddington station, where they arrived at 6:35pm. They were met by motor coaches and a band, and driven to the City Hall. Some 150,000 fans lined the streets of Cardiff to welcome the team back home. After leading some communal singing outside the City Hall, the team and their wives later attended a dinner and dance in the building. While some press reports claimed that Keenor had said that the team were lucky to have won, he refuted the claim, saying that the superiority of Cardiff's defence that led them to victory.|$|E

2500|$|But, {{because of}} the rich pasture-lands in the interior, the {{agricultural}} sector (dairy products and cattle raising) remain {{an important part of}} the economy. The export of <b>butter</b> <b>to</b> Lisbon, was an important part in the villa's development and industrial competition, that resulted in the creation of several small cooperatives on the island. The development of these agricultural syndicates, led by Father José Furtado Mota, was one of the important socio-economic movements in the Azores during the 20th century. This resulted in several conflicts, known on the island colloquially as the [...] "Butter Wars". The growth in the dairy industry contributed to the decrease in other forms of agriculture, particularly cereals, since lands used for dairy-raising were more lucrative.|$|E
