5|$|Greyfriars, in Bristol, England, was a Franciscan friary. The name Greyfriars {{derived from}} the grey robes worn by the friars. It was founded at some time before 1234, within the town walls and then moved to Lewin's Mead in 1250. The site {{included}} extensive gardens surrounded by a stone wall. Following the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the sixteenth century, the premises were leased to the town council in 1541, who desired to use the stone to make repairs to the town walls, and the harbour facilities. In succeeding centuries many different uses have <b>been</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> site, which is currently occupied by an office block and part of Bristol Dental School.|$|E
5|$|As a result, {{the text}} of Asser's Life is known from a {{multitude}} of different sources. Various transcripts had <b>been</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cotton manuscript and a facsimile of {{the first page of}} the manuscript had been made and published, giving more direct evidence for the hand of the scribe. In addition to these transcripts, the extracts mentioned above made by other early writers have been used to help assemble and assess the text. Because of the lack of the manuscript itself and because Parker's annotations had been copied by some transcribers as if {{they were part of the}} text, scholarly editions have had a difficult burden. There have been multiple editions of The Life published, both in Latin and in translation. The 1904 critical edition by W. H. Stevenson, Asser's Life of King Alfred, together with the Annals of Saint Neots erroneously ascribed to Asser, still provides the standard text. An important recent translation, with thorough notes on the scholarly problems and issues, is Alfred the Great: Asser's Life of King Alfred and Other Contemporary Sources by Simon Keynes and Michael Lapidge.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{fluctuating}} critical {{assessment of}} the various works over the years, Elgar's major works {{taken as a whole}} have in the twenty-first century recovered strongly from their neglect in the 1950s. The Record Guide in 1955 could list only one currently available recording of the First Symphony, none of the Second, one of the Violin Concerto, two of the Cello Concerto, two of the Enigma Variations, one of Falstaff, and none of The Dream of Gerontius. Since then there have been multiple recordings of all the major works. More than thirty recordings have <b>been</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> First Symphony since 1955, for example, {{and more than a dozen}} of The Dream of Gerontius. Similarly, in the concert hall, Elgar's works, after a period of neglect, are once again frequently programmed. The Elgar Society's website, in its diary of forthcoming performances, lists performances of Elgar's works by orchestras, soloists and conductors across Europe, North America and Australia.|$|E
5|$|Scientists {{analyzing}} the unique cracks lining Europa found evidence showing that it likely spun around a tilted axis {{at some point}} in time. If correct, this would explain many of Europa's features. Europa's immense network of crisscrossing cracks serves as a record of the stresses caused by massive tides in its global ocean. Europa's tilt could influence calculations of how much of its history is recorded in its frozen shell, how much heat is generated by tides in its ocean, and even how long the ocean has been liquid. Its ice layer must stretch to accommodate these changes. When there is too much stress, it cracks. A tilt in Europa's axis could suggest that its cracks may be much more recent than previously thought. The reason is that the direction of the spin pole may change by as much as a few degrees per day, completing one precession period over several months. A tilt also could affect the estimates of the age of Europa's ocean. Tidal forces are thought to generate the heat that keeps Europa's ocean liquid, and a tilt in the spin axis means that more heat is generated by tidal forces. This heat helps the ocean to remain liquid longer. Scientists did not specify when the tilt would have occurred and measurements have not <b>been</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tilt of Europa's axis.|$|E
5|$|The Iazyges used hanging {{barrel-shaped}} pots {{that were}} asymmetrical, and had uneven weight distribution. The rope to hang the pot was {{wrapped around the}} edges of the side collar, it is believed that the rope was tied tightly to the pot, allowing the pot to spin in circles, due to the spinning motion, several theories have <b>been</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> use of the pots. It is believed that the smaller hanging pots were used to ferment alcohol, by use of the seeds of touch-me-not balsam (Impatiens noli-tangere), and the larger hanging pots were used to churn butter and make cheese. They were cattle breeders, and as such required salt in order to preserve their meat, however, the Iazyges had no salt mines within their land. According to Dio, the Iazyges received grain from the Romans.|$|E

Under the Roman empire, the area around Ipswich formed an important route inland to rural towns and settlements via the rivers Orwell and Gipping. A large Roman fort, part of the coastal defences of Britain, stood at Walton near Felixstowe (13 miles, 21km), and the largest Roman villa in Suffolk (possibly an administrative complex) stood at Castle Hill (north-west Ipswich).|$|E
25|$|Forensic facial {{reconstruction}} is {{one particularly}} impressive technique used {{in studying the}} bog bodies.

Yde Girl and her modern reconstruction are displayed at the Drents Museum in Assen.

25|$|The King Stone is a single, {{weathered}} monolith, 2.4metres high by 1.5metres wide, standing 76metres {{north of}} the King's Men. Unlike the other two of the Rollright monuments, it is of uncertain date. Many different interpretations have <b>been</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> King Stone, with various arguments being presented as to what it had originally been designed to be. Lambrick catalogued six distinct hypotheses that had been presented by antiquarians and archaeologists over the preceding centuries and evaluated their likelihood. Some of these argued {{that it had been}} positioned in relation to the King's Men stone circle, with others instead suggesting that it was a component of a long barrow or other burial site.|$|E
