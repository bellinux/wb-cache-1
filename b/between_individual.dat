5|$|In {{ordinary}} circumstances, transduction, conjugation, {{and transformation}} involve transfer of DNA <b>between</b> <b>individual</b> bacteria {{of the same}} species, but occasionally transfer may occur between individuals of different bacterial species and this may have significant consequences, such as the transfer of antibiotic resistance. In such cases, gene acquisition from other bacteria or the environment is called horizontal gene transfer and may be common under natural conditions. Gene transfer is particularly important in antibiotic resistance as it allows the rapid transfer of resistance genes between different pathogens.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 13thcentury, Crusader castles were mostly built by Military Orders {{including}} the Knights Hospitaller, Knights Templar, and Teutonic Knights. The orders {{were responsible for}} the foundation of sites such as Krak des Chevaliers, Margat, and Belvoir. Design varied not just between orders, but <b>between</b> <b>individual</b> castles, though it was common for those founded in this period to have concentric defences.|$|E
5|$|Partnership for Peace (PfP) {{membership}} {{was offered}} to Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro and Serbia. NATO hoped {{that this would}} bring these countries more into the Euro-Atlantic community as the PfP is a programme of practical bilateral cooperation <b>between</b> <b>individual</b> Partner countries and NATO, thereby allowing Partner countries {{to choose their own}} priorities for cooperation. It is expected that PfP membership is for these three countries the first step towards NATO membership. As a result, the PfP offer sparked the anger of the UN tribunal trying suspected war criminals from the Balkans.|$|E
5|$|Poetry uses {{forms and}} {{conventions}} to suggest differential interpretation to words, or to evoke emotive responses. Devices such as assonance, alliteration, onomatopoeia and rhythm are sometimes used to achieve musical or incantatory effects. The use of ambiguity, symbolism, irony and other stylistic elements of poetic diction often leaves a poem open to multiple interpretations. Similarly figures of speech such as metaphor, simile and metonymy create a resonance between otherwise disparate images—a layering of meanings, forming connections previously not perceived. Kindred forms of resonance may exist, <b>between</b> <b>individual</b> verses, in their patterns of rhyme or rhythm.|$|E

5|$|Prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea) {{typically}} {{store their}} genomes {{on a single}} large, circular chromosome. Similarly, some eukaryotic organelles contain a remnant circular chromosome with {{a small number of}} genes. Prokaryotes sometimes supplement their chromosome with additional small circles of DNA called plasmids, which usually encode only a few genes and are transferable between individuals. For example, the genes for antibiotic resistance are usually encoded on bacterial plasmids and can be passed <b>between</b> <b>individual</b> cells, even those of different species, via horizontal gene transfer.|$|E
5|$|The {{base coat}} of the jaguar is {{generally}} a tawny yellow, but can range to reddish-brown and black, {{for most of}} the body. However, the ventral areas are white. The cat is covered in rosettes for camouflage in the dappled light of its forest habitat. The spots vary over individual coats and <b>between</b> <b>individual</b> jaguars: rosettes may include one or several dots, and the shapes of the dots vary. The spots on the head and neck are generally solid, as are those on the tail, where they may merge to form a band.|$|E
5|$|Various {{authors have}} {{proposed}} slightly different {{analyses of the}} Khmer vowel system. This may be {{in part because of}} the wide degree of variation in pronunciation <b>between</b> <b>individual</b> speakers, even within a dialectal region. The description below follows Huffman (1970). The number of vowel nuclei and their values vary between dialects; differences exist even between the Standard Khmer system and that of the Battambang dialect on which the standard is based.|$|E

In this framework of relationships, the need for health is no longer an individual but is a “common good” that results in benefits for all indivisible, enabling a form of integration based on consensus...|$|R
5|$|After {{the first}} groups of {{personnel}} began arriving at Redbank, in south-east Queensland, {{in the middle}} of May, the battalion's headquarters moved to the camp and basic training commenced in June under instructors from the Australian Instructional Corps. In early July, the majority of the battalion was transported by train to Pinkenba, and from there to Darwin, in Australia's north, aboard the troopship Zealandia. Tasked with defending the port and its surrounds, the battalion was based around Vestey's meatworks near Mindil Beach, and {{in the months that followed}} was occupied with vital asset protection and area defence in <b>between</b> <b>individual</b> and collective training exercises. Personnel were joined by the majority of their vehicles, including 14 tracked Bren carriers in August, as well as a group of reinforcements. In October, elements of the battalion were used as stevedores during a wharf labourers' strike.|$|E
5|$|In Pakistan, the {{breeding}} {{range of the}} dusky crag martin overlaps that of the subspecies P. f. peloplasta of pale crag martin, but that species breeds much higher in the mountains. This altitudinal separation means {{that it is not}} known whether the two closely related martins could hybridise, which would cast doubts as to whether they were distinct species. Dusky crag martins from Burma and Thailand have been described as a separate darker subspecies, P. c. sintaungensis (originally Krimnochelidon concolor sintaungensis, Baker, 1832), {{but it is not clear}} that the difference is greater than that <b>between</b> <b>individual</b> martins of the nominate subspecies.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} years of the NFL, {{contractual}} negotiations took place <b>between</b> <b>individual</b> players and management; team owners were reluctant to engage in collective bargaining. A series of strikes and lockouts have occurred throughout the union's existence largely due to monetary and benefit disputes between the players and the owners. League rules that punished players for playing in rival football leagues resulted in litigation; the success of such lawsuits impelled the NFL to negotiate some work rules and minimum payments with the NFLPA. However, the organization was not recognized by the NFL as the official bargaining agent for the players until 1968, when a CBA was signed. The most recent CBA negotiations took place in 2011.|$|E

5|$|On {{the largest}} scale, the Universe is {{continually}} expanding, {{resulting in an}} average increase in the separation <b>between</b> <b>individual</b> galaxies (see Hubble's law). Associations of galaxies can overcome this expansion on a local scale through their mutual gravitational attraction. These associations formed early in the Universe, as clumps of dark matter pulled their respective galaxies together. Nearby groups later merged to form larger-scale clusters. This on-going merger process (as well as an influx of infalling gas) heats the inter-galactic gas within a cluster to very high temperatures, reaching 30–100 megakelvins. About 70–80% of the mass in a cluster {{is in the form}} of dark matter, with 10–30% consisting of this heated gas and the remaining few percent of the matter in the form of galaxies.|$|E
5|$|The mutual {{attraction}} <b>between</b> <b>individual</b> insects continues into adulthood, {{and they}} continue to act as a cohesive group. Individuals that get detached from a swarm fly back into the mass. Others that get left behind after feeding, take off to rejoin the swarm when it passes overhead. When individuals {{at the front of the}} swarm settle to feed, others fly past overhead and settle in their turn, the whole swarm acting like a rolling unit with an ever-changing leading edge. The locusts spend much time on the ground feeding and resting, moving on when the vegetation is exhausted. They may then fly a considerable distance before settling in a location where transitory rainfall has caused a green flush of new growth.|$|E
5|$|Their genome {{is usually}} a {{circular}} bacterial chromosome – a single loop of DNA, although they can also harbor small pieces of DNA called plasmids. These plasmids can be transferred between cells through bacterial conjugation. Bacteria have an enclosing cell wall, which provides strength and rigidity to their cells. They reproduce by binary fission or sometimes by budding, but do not undergo meiotic sexual reproduction. However, many bacterial species can transfer DNA <b>between</b> <b>individual</b> cells by a horizontal gene transfer process referred to as natural transformation. Some species form extraordinarily resilient spores, but for bacteria this is a mechanism for survival, not reproduction. Under optimal conditions bacteria can grow extremely rapidly and can double as quickly as every 20 minutes.|$|E
