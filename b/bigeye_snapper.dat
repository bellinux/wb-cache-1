It is much sought-after by commercial fisheries.|$|E
40|$|The {{chemical}} {{changes in}} fish muscle and natural actomyosin (NAM) from <b>bigeye</b> <b>snapper</b> (Priacanthus tayenus) and lizardfish (Saurida undosquamis) muscle during 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 14 days of iced storage were studied. Myosin heavy chain (MHC) of NAM extracted from two fish species was degraded throughout iced storage. However, no changes in actin were observed. The total volatile base (TVB). trimethylamine (TMA) and surface hydrophobicity increased, while the total sulfhydryl content and emulsion capacity of NAM from both fish species decreased significantly as the storage time increased (p< 0. 05). A Texture ProfileAnalysis (TPA) and shear force of emulsion fish sausages prepared from two fish species kept in ice for 0, 4, 8 and 12 days were investigated. The {{results showed that}} hardness, cohesiveness, gumminess, chewiness and shear force of sausage prepared from fish kept in ice were lower than those produced from fresh fish. However, {{no significant differences in}} adhesiveness were observed. Cooking loss of emulsion fish sausage from two fish species increased throughout storage time (p< 0. 05). The texture of <b>bigeye</b> <b>snapper</b> sausage was better than that of lizardfish sausages. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrographs of emulsion fish sausage from two fish species revealed bigger voids, thicker strands and less continuity of protein strands with increasing storage time. More microstructural changes were observed in sausages from lizardfish, compared to those in sausages from <b>bigeye</b> <b>snapper...</b>|$|E
40|$|Composition and {{properties}} of fresh <b>bigeye</b> <b>snapper</b> fish (Priacanthus hamrur) mince has been investigated. The protein content of fish mince was 16. 71 g/ 100 g mince. Amino acid analysis revealed {{high proportion of}} glutamic acid, alanine, lysine and leucine. Fatty acid profile indicated high proportion of eicosa pentaenoic acid and decosa hexaenoic acid content. Gel filtration profile of total proteins from fresh bigeye fish mince revealed a major peak (high molecular weight component) and a few minor peaks, which was further confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis pattern. The differential scanning calorimetry profile of fresh bigeye fish mince revealed transitions at 38. 35, 47. 72 and 63. 02 C indicating denaturation temperature of different protein fractions. The gel-forming ability of fresh bigeye fish mince was evaluated by both small strain and large strain tests. The flow behavior of total protein solution from fresh bigeye fish mince {{as a function of}} protein concentration and temperature showed pseudoplastic behavior. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|E
40|$|Lipids were {{incorporated}} into <b>bigeye</b> <b>snapper</b> surimi protein films through emulsification using Tween- 20 as a surfactant to form protein/lipid composite films. The effects of lipid types (palm oil, butter or shortening) and concentrations (0 - 100 % glycerol substitution) on film properties were investigated. Additionof lipids up to 75 % glycerol substitution resulted in the improved water vapor barrier, lowered tensile strength (TS) and increased elongation at break (EAB) of the composite film (P< 0. 05). However, an increase in TS was observed with increasing lipid concentration, plausibly caused by increasing protein aggregation in film matrix. Transparency of films was decreased with increasing lipid concentrations used (P< 0. 05), especially for those added with solid lipids. Generally, the mechanical properties and water resistance of surimi protein films incorporated with palm oil were superior to those modified with butter or shortening. An increase in Tween- 20, nonionic surfactant, might {{be associated with the}} decrease in non-disulfide covalent cross-links in the film. Scanning electron microscopic study revealed that dispersion of palm oil in the film was more uniform than that of butter and shortening. This might contribute to the varying properties of resulting films...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to explore methods to {{decrease}} the lipid content to less than 1 % by washing escolar (Lepidocybium flavobrunneum) meat {{as well as the}} possibility of utilizing the obtained washed meat. For first washing, the escolar meat was washed with an alkaline solution under a different cooling condition. The once-washed meat was washed with palmitic sucrose ester (P- 1670) solution in order to lower the lipid efficiently. The washed meat obtained was heated to prepare a gel whose quality was determined. When the temperature was maintained below 1 °C during the first washing with an alkaline solution, the lipid and wax contents were 1. 8 and 1. 0 %, respectively. After the once-washed meat was washed with a 0. 25 % (w/v) P- 1670 solution, the lipid and wax contents decreased to 0. 91 and 0. 32 %, respectively. While L/P and W/P ratios were 0. 07 and 0. 03, respectively. The strength and whiteness of the gel prepared from washed escolar meat were better than those of the gel prepared from commercial <b>bigeye</b> <b>snapper</b> surimi (SA grade). Thus, there is great potential to promote escolar as raw material for surimi production...|$|E
40|$|This is the author's peer-reviewed final manuscript, as {{accepted}} by the publisher. The published article is copyrighted by Elsevier {{and can be found}} at: [URL] characteristics of tropical surimi, namely threadfin bream (TB), <b>bigeye</b> <b>snapper</b> (BS), goatfish (GF) and lizardfish (LF) prepared in the absence and presence of 10 g kg⁻¹ egg white proteins were evaluated using either ohmic (OH) or water bath (WB) heating. LF and GF surimi exhibited higher endogenous proteolytic activity than BS and TB. Ohmic heating markedly minimized proteolysis of LF and GF surimi as evidenced by a reduction of trichloroacetic acid (TCA) -soluble oligopeptide content of gels and more retention of myosin heavy chain (MHC). Ohmic heating increased breaking force and deformation of TB and BS surimi by 1. 3 and 1. 6 times, respectively, as compared to water bath heating. However, TB surimi gels heated by a higher applied voltage gradient of 16. 7 V cm⁻¹ exhibited lower breaking force than those heated at 6. 7 V cm⁻¹. Gels heated ohmically contained lower total sulfhydryl concentration, indicating the greater extent of disulfide bond formation as compared to gels heated in a 90 °C water bath. The rapid heating method with shorter heating time could improve water holding capacity and preserve color of tropical surimi gels when compared to water bath heating...|$|E
30|$|Setting at 25 °C or 40 °C {{prior to}} heating at 90 °C might allow the protein {{cross-linking}} mediated by endogenous TGase {{to take place}} effectively, especially when setting was performed at 40 °C. It was noted that protein bands with MW of 120 to 130 [*]kDa were formed in K 40 sample, suggesting that the degradation of MHC occurred to some extent. Therefore, polymerisation and degradation of MHC occurred simultaneously, especially during the setting at 40 °C. However, polymerisation more likely took place to a higher degree than degradation. The ratio of polymerisation to degradation, which varied among the fish species, directly determined the final gel quality. MHC was most susceptible to cross-linking during setting (Benjakul & Visessanguan [2003]). Benjakul and Visessanguan ([2003]) reported the decrease in MHC of surimi gel from <b>bigeye</b> <b>snapper,</b> particularly when the setting at high temperature was implemented. Benjakul et al. ([1997]) reported that MHC was also more prone to proteolytic degradation than other muscle proteins, including actin, troponin and tropomyosin. In modori gel, the disappearance of MHC with the occurrence of new protein bands of MW approximately 110 to 120 [*]kDa suggested the degradation of MHC during incubation at 60 °C. The degradation of MHC in the modori gel was coincidental with the decreased breaking force (Figure 1 a). High degradation of MHC was reported in surimi gel from dark-fleshed fish including mackerel (Benjakul et al. [2002]). Alkaline proteases {{have been reported to}} contribute to the protein degradation in surimi gels (Boye & Lanier [1988]; Toyohara et al. [1987]).|$|E
30|$|Fish {{has been}} used as the raw {{material}} for surimi production. In Thailand, common species, e.g., threadfin bream, <b>bigeye</b> <b>snapper,</b> have been continuously decreasing in quantity (Yanpakdee et al. 2009). Recently, yellowtail barracuda has gained interest as a new raw material for surimi production, due to its high yield and white color (Yasir and Benjakul 2012). However, during dewatering process by screw press, the moisture content of resulting washed mince remains at a level above the standard (77.0 %). To enhance the dewatering efficacy, 0.03 % to 0.6 % NaCl was incorporated in wash water (Okada and Tomoto 1986). Na+ and Cl− are able to bind with the opposite charge of amino acids in proteins, leading to the less repulsive force between adjacent protein molecules. As a consequence, protein molecules align more closely with the concomitant migration of water from the space between protein molecules. Additionally, salt might compete with protein in binding with water, termed the ‘salting out’ effect. As a result, proteins could interact with each other at a higher extent, thereby repelling water from the mince. Nevertheless, excessive moisture content is still obtained in yellowtail barracuda surimi even though NaCl is incorporated. Therefore, the use of other salts in conjunction with NaCl could pave the way for effective dewatering of washed mince. Solberg et al. (1990) washed cod mince using water containing CaCl 2 and MgCl 2 in all three washing steps. In the third washing step, 0.15 % NaCl was added. The dewatering was found to be much more efficient when CaCl 2 was used rather than MgCl 2. The highest breaking force of the gel was found when washing with 5  mM CaCl 2 was implemented. The deformation of the gel decreased when the concentration of CaCl 2 increased. Dalgleish and Hunt (1995) reported that the binding of cations on protein molecules is based on the formation of a short-range hydration repulsion. When the charge of the protein molecule was neutralized, two protein molecules approached each other, thereby repelling the water from the protein molecules.|$|E
30|$|TCA-soluble peptide {{content of}} surimi gels {{prepared}} by different heating conditions {{is shown in}} Figure 2 b. The highest content of TCA-soluble peptides was found in modori gel (p[*]<[*] 0.05), which was {{in agreement with the}} highest degradation of proteins as shown in SDS-PAGE (Figure 2 a). This indicated that the proteolysis was maximised in modori gel. The highest degradation of muscle proteins led to the marked weakening of the gel as indicated by the lowest breaking force of this gel (Figure 1 a). Dark-fleshed fish had a high proteolytic activity, resulting in poorer gelation characteristics and high susceptibility to modori (Shimizu et al. [1992]). Shimizu et al. ([1992]) also reported that the poor gel-forming properties of muscle from dark-fleshed species are caused by the presence of heat-stable proteases, which are active in degrading myosin during heating at temperature ranges of 50 °C to 70 °C. The directly heated gel had the lower TCA-soluble peptide content than modori gel (p[*]<[*] 0.05). Lower TCA-soluble peptide content was also found in kamaboko gels in comparison with modori gel. <b>Bigeye</b> <b>snapper</b> surimi gel, prepared by setting at 40 °C, also contained the degradation products (Benjakul et al. [2004]). Takeda and Seki ([1996]) also found some proteolysis in walleye pollack paste during setting at 25 °C. Polymerised proteins found during setting might be less susceptible to degradation by endogenous proteases. As a consequence, the lower degradation took place in kamaboko gel with prior setting. K 25 samples had the higher TCA-soluble peptide content than K 40 samples (p[*]<[*] 0.05). Polymerised proteins might make gel network more resistant to hydrolysis by proteases. Without incubation or setting, the low TCA-soluble peptide content was observed. This result suggested that slow heating at temperature enhancing proteolytic activity might cause the protein degradation and loss in gel property. Since increased breaking force and deformation were obtained with setting at 25 °C and 40 °C, it was suggested that cross-linking occurred {{to a greater extent than}} proteolysis. As a consequence, properties of surimi produced from the yellow stripe travelly could be improved by prior setting.|$|E
