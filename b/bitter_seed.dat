The A-H assay is based on protein precipitation and spectrophotometry.

40|$|Abstract Background Seeds of Momordica charantia (bitter melon) produce {{high levels}} of eleostearic acid, an unusual {{conjugated}} fatty acid with industrial value. Deep sequencing of non-normalized and normalized cDNAs from developing <b>bitter</b> melon <b>seeds</b> was conducted to uncover key genes required for biotechnological transfer of conjugated fatty acid production to existing oilseed crops. It is expected that these studies will also provide basic information regarding the metabolism of other high-value novel fatty acids. Results Deep sequencing using 454 technology with non-normalized and normalized cDNA libraries prepared from <b>bitter</b> melon <b>seeds</b> at 18 DAP resulted {{in the identification of}} transcripts {{for the vast majority of}} known genes involved in fatty acid and triacylglycerol biosynthesis. The non-normalized library provided a transcriptome profile of the early stage in seed development that highlighted the abundance of transcripts for genes encoding seed storage proteins as well as for a number of genes for lipid metabolism-associated polypeptides, including Δ 12 oleic acid desaturases and fatty acid conjugases, class 3 lipases, acyl-carrier protein, and acyl-CoA binding protein. Normalization of cDNA by use of a duplex-specific nuclease method not only increased the overall discovery of genes from developing <b>bitter</b> melon <b>seeds,</b> but also resulted in the identification of 345 contigs with homology to 189 known lipid genes in Arabidopsis. These included candidate genes for eleostearic acid metabolism such as diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 and 2, and a phospholipid:diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 -related enzyme. Transcripts were also identified for a novel FAD 2 gene encoding a functional Δ 12 oleic acid desaturase with potential implications for eleostearic acid biosynthesis. Conclusions 454 deep sequencing, particularly with normalized cDNA populations, was an effective method for mining of genes associated with eleostearic acid metabolism in developing <b>bitter</b> melon <b>seeds.</b> The transcriptomic data presented provide a resource for the study of novel fatty acid metabolism and for the biotechnological production of conjugated fatty acids and possibly other novel fatty acids in established oilseed crops. </p...|$|R

We report here the partial purification and characterization of an Mg(2 +) -independent PAP activity from developing cotyledons of bitter melon. PAP protein was partially purified by successive centrifugation and UNOsphere Q and S columns from the soluble extract. PAP activity was optimized at pH 6. 5 and 53 - 60 °C and unaffected by up to 0. 3 mM MgCl 2.

Lupine seed, Lupinus spp., is a protein crop used in animal farming. This plant also contains alkaloids that target nicotinic receptors [1], targets for anthelmintic drugs. These alkaloids provide toxic properties to the bitter ecotypes. The varieties used in animal feed legally contain less than 1. 5 % <b>bitter</b> <b>seeds.</b> Our study aims at validating and quantifying these properties through in vitro testing of seed extracts from alkaloid-rich or –poor varieties. Five varieties of sweet lupine (3 L. albus L. angustifolius, 1 L. luteus) and six bitter ecotypes (3 L. albus, 1 L. angustifolius, 1 L. luteus, 1 L. mutabilis), richer in alkaloids, were tested against H. contortus. Two L albus varieties, a sweet-one ENERGY and a bitter-one E 063, exhibited the higher activity on H. contortus mobility. Chemical analyses revealed a higher alkaloid content in the alkaloid-rich (E 063) (3. 3 % vs 0. 04 % in the alkaloid-poor) but a lower diversity than in the alkaloid-poor variety (ENERGY) (n= 3 vs 5 respectively). Aqueous extracts of both varieties could significantly control infective larval stages and inhibited egg development. Extracted alkaloid fractions exhibited a stronger inhibitory effect, corroborating the working hypothesis, and could also control a multi-resistant isolate. These results are in favor of nutraceutical properties of lupin seed. Alkaloids of ENERGY variety exhibited original mechanism of action against cholinergic receptors, with low EC 50...|$|R
40|$|The {{extracts}} {{were prepared}} from the samples of 3, 200 -year-old charred pea and <b>bitter</b> vetch <b>seeds</b> {{from the site}} of Hissar near Leskovac, South Serbia, using two different DNA extraction procedures. We used CTAB method with some modification and obtained low quantity of ancient DNA in comparison with the second method used - commercial available kit. After the extraction, a whole genome amplification using Phi 29 DNA polymerase was performed. The amplified DNAs were used for PCR reaction using primers for 26 S rDNA gene, which is located on the nuclear genome. The single band corresponding to 26 S rDNA fragment from modern relatives was obtained. We conclude that DNA from charred pea and vetch seed can be extracted and used for further archaeobotanical analysis at the molecular level...|$|R
