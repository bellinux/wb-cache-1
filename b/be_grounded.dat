5|$|As {{a result}} of the attack, Diệm ordered that all VNAF {{aircraft}} <b>be</b> <b>grounded,</b> and all aerial combat missions suspended while his security officials investigated fighter pilots for any possible anti-regime tendencies. This was achieved by placing tanks on the runway at Bien Hoa Air Base. Without assistance from accompanying fighter craft, the U.S. deemed it too risky for American helicopters to operate in the jungles against the communists.|$|E
5|$|The trial unit from NOHAB was {{delivered}} on 17 September 1954. The first test runs in scheduled service {{were on the}} Nordland Line between Trondheim and Mo i Rana in October. There were no technical faults until 22 December, when a grounding error caused the locomotive to <b>be</b> <b>grounded</b> until 17 January. In March the unit {{was sent back to}} NOHAB and went on a marketing tour that would eventually reach Ankara, Turkey in 1955.|$|E
5|$|Combat trials {{began in}} mid-September 1944 and were {{generally}} very positive. However four aircraft were lost to engine failures and the engines suffered from numerous lesser problems, despite its satisfactory {{service in the}} La-5FN. One cause was the lower position of the engine air intakes in the wing roots of the La-7 which caused the engine to ingest sand and dust. One batch of flawed wings was built and caused six accidents, four of them fatal, in October which caused the fighter to <b>be</b> <b>grounded</b> until the cause {{was determined to be}} a defect in the wing spar.|$|E
50|$|Grist can <b>be</b> <b>ground</b> into meal or flour, {{depending}} on how coarsely it <b>is</b> <b>ground.</b> Maize made into grist is called grits when it is coarse, and corn meal when it <b>is</b> finely <b>ground.</b> Wheat, oats, barley, and buckwheat <b>are</b> also <b>ground</b> and sifted into flour and farina. Grist is also used in brewing and distillation to make a mash.|$|R
50|$|During the {{following}} years, the Libyan MiG-25 fleet <b>was</b> <b>grounded,</b> lacking maintenance. As MiG-25 air-frames <b>were</b> <b>grounded</b> for several years, NATO attacks spared {{them during the}} Libyan Civil War (2011).|$|R

5|$|In {{the decade}} {{between the end}} of the Star Trek {{television}} series and the film, many of the futuristic technologies that appeared on the show—electronic doors that open automatically, hypodermic injections, talking computers, weapons that stun rather than kill, and personal communication devices—had become a reality. Roddenberry had insisted that the technology aboard the Enterprise <b>be</b> <b>grounded</b> in established science and scientific theories. The Motion Picture likewise received technical consultation from NASA, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory at California Institute of Technology, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, as well as individuals such as a former astronaut and the science fiction writer Isaac Asimov.|$|E
5|$|New classicals {{broke with}} Keynesian {{economic}} theory completely while monetarists had built on Keynesian ideas. Despite discarding Keynesian theory, new classical economists did share the Keynesian focus on explaining short-run fluctuations. New classicals replaced monetarists {{as the primary}} opponents to Keynesianism and changed the primary debate in macroeconomics from whether to look at short-run fluctuations to whether macroeconomic models should <b>be</b> <b>grounded</b> in microeconomic theories. Like monetarism, new classical economics was rooted at the University of Chicago, principally with Robert Lucas. Other leaders {{in the development of}} new classical economics include Edward Prescott at University of Minnesota and Robert Barro at University of Rochester.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the advent}} of {{anatomical}} physical modernity cannot confidently be linked with palaeoneurological change, it does seem probable that hominid brains evolved through the same selection processes as other body parts. Genes that promoted a capacity for symbolism may have been selected for, suggesting that the foundations for symbolic culture may well <b>be</b> <b>grounded</b> in biology. However, behavior that was mediated by symbolism may have only come later, even though this physical capacity was already in place much earlier. Skoyles and Sagan, for example, argue that human brain expansion by increasing the prefrontal cortex would have created a brain capable of symbolizing its previously non-symbolic cognition, and that this process, slow to begin with, increasingly accelerated during the last 100,000 years. Symbolically mediated behavior may then feed back upon this process by creating a greater ability to manufacture symbolic artifacts and social networks. According to the research team in Jebel Irhoud, the discovery means that Homo sapiens — not members of a rival or ancestor species (Homo heidelbergensis, Homo naledi) — {{were the ones who}} left behind Middle Stone Age hand tools that have since been unearthed all over Africa.|$|E

25|$|In the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries, several {{historical}} figures put forth very influential views that religion and its beliefs can <b>be</b> <b>grounded</b> in experience itself. While Kant held that moral experience justified religious beliefs, John Wesley {{in addition to}} stressing individual moral exertion thought that the religious experiences in the Methodist movement (paralleling the Romantic Movement) were foundational to religious commitment {{as a way of}} life.|$|E
25|$|Serpents are {{represented}} as potent guardians of temples and other sacred spaces. This connection may <b>be</b> <b>grounded</b> in {{the observation that}} when threatened, some snakes (such as rattlesnakes or cobras) frequently hold and defend their ground, first resorting to threatening display and then fighting, rather than retreat. Thus, they are natural guardians of treasures or sacred sites which cannot easily be moved out of harm's way.|$|E

25|$|Second, Kennedy {{examined}} the statutory framework of Title VII, {{to determine whether}} Title VII's proscription of disparate treatment is afforded any lawful justifications in the disparate impact provision {{that it seems to}} conflict with. Looking to analogous Equal Protection cases, he reached the statutory construction that, in instances of conflict between the disparate-treatment and disparate-impact provisions, permissible justifications for disparate treatment must <b>be</b> <b>grounded</b> in the strong-basis-in-evidence standard.|$|E
25|$|During concert pieces, timpani {{were often}} {{grounded}} momentarily, using a ti-pod leg system. Eventually around 1981, timpani and mallet instruments {{were allowed to}} <b>be</b> <b>grounded</b> in the front, paving {{the way to the}} modern day front ensemble. For a few years, corps still marched timpani. Some corps took advantage of the new rule, and grounded their timpani. However, some corps couldn't afford a new set of concert timpani, so they just grounded their marching timpani.|$|E
25|$|The Kriegsmarine {{initially}} {{expected to}} use 50 specially-converted motor coasters {{to transport the}} submersible tanks, but testing with the coaster Germania showed this to be impractical. This {{was due to the}} ballast needed to offset the weight of the tanks, and the requirement that the coasters <b>be</b> <b>grounded</b> to prevent them from capsizing as the tanks were transferred by crane onto the vessel's wooden side ramps. These difficulties led to development of the Type B barge.|$|E
