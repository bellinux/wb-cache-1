50|$|The <b>bicolored</b> <b>hawk</b> is {{difficult}} to detect due to its shyness and inconspicuousness. Because of this behaviour, the <b>bicolored</b> <b>hawk</b> may be more common than it seems.|$|E
50|$|The <b>bicolored</b> <b>hawk</b> is {{a species}} in the genus Accipiter and is {{included}} in the family Accipitridae. Three subspecies are currently recognized. The <b>bicolored</b> <b>hawk</b> is also closely related to the Cooper's hawk (A. cooperii) and the Gundlach's hawk (A. gundlachi); these three form a superspecies. Until recently, the Chilean hawk (A. chilensis) from the colder, southernmost South America was treated as a race of A. bicolor but due to its differences in habitat preferences and plumages from the <b>bicolored</b> <b>hawk,</b> A. chilensis is now considered a full species.|$|E
50|$|Forest {{disturbance}} and fragmentation {{negatively affect}} the habitat {{and quantity of}} the <b>bicolored</b> <b>hawk,</b> which is most abundant in primary undisturbed forest or riparian forest. There are fewer hawks in disturbed habitats such as forests that have been logged, and even fewer in those fragmented habitats that provide greater than 66% forest cover. These hawks are rarely present in forests that provide less than 66% forest cover.|$|E
50|$|Several {{potential}} predators are known, being {{almost exclusively}} avian raptors. These include white-throated hawks (Buteo albigula), variable <b>hawks</b> (Buteo polyosoma), <b>bicolored</b> <b>hawks</b> (Accipiter <b>bicolor),</b> golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) and southern crested caracaras (Caracara plancus) (the latter {{most likely a}} predator only of young). When they encounter these potential predators while not nesting, Magellanic woodpecker usually respond by being quiet and staying still. However, raptorial birds are often aggressively attacked during the nesting season.|$|R
50|$|It is {{sometimes}} {{considered to be}} a subspecies of its northern relative the <b>bicolored</b> <b>hawk</b> (A. bicolor), including by the American Ornithological Society and sometimes a distinct species. The two show differences in habitat preference and have allopatric distributions. But the situation is complicated by the subspecies pileatus, which is intermediate in plumage between bicolor and chilensis, and has been variously assigned to either species by those that consider them distinct.|$|E
50|$|The <b>bicolored</b> <b>hawk</b> (Accipiter bicolor) is {{a species}} of bird of prey in the Accipitridae family. It is found in forest, woodland, second growth, plantations, and wooded savanna in southeastern Mexico, Central America, and {{northern}} and central South America (as far south as northern Argentina). Though generally uncommon, {{it is the most}} common species of Accipiter in most of its range, but it does not occur at altitudes above 2700 m such as the highest parts of the Andes.|$|E
50|$|The <b>bicolored</b> <b>hawk</b> is {{widespread}} but uncommonly observed. Its range extends from Mexico to west Ecuador, the Guianas to Colombia, south to east Peru, through Amazonian Brazil to Paraguay, north-north western Argentina, Bolivia and to Chile. It mainly resides in forests, along forest edges and in clearings in tropical and locally subtropical zones, although its habitat is none too specialized. It may also reside in rain forest, drier, thinned forest, and palm savanna with gallery forest.|$|E
50|$|The hawk is a {{medium-sized}} forest raptor. It stands between 43-51 cm in height {{and has a}} stocky body shape. The adult hawk has a dark bluish-gray upper body and wings, with a black head. The under body of the bird is a lighter color. It also has a striped tail that is rounded in flight. Immature hawks are mostly brown {{on the top and}} paler on the bottom, but with dark streaking down the body. Compared to other raptors such as the <b>bicolored</b> <b>hawk,</b> Gundlach's hawks are shorter and faster.|$|E
50|$|Bicolored hawks {{breed in}} forest areas, {{choosing}} to build nests on tree branches and occasionally hanging vines. The nest is built in {{cooperation between the}} male and female and is constructed from dried sticks and leaves. Each breeding pair will normally build a new nest {{at the beginning of each}} breeding year. Copulation occurs after breeding activities such as feeding and nest building have been completed. Egg laying takes place approximately five weeks after copulation and the dull white eggs measure an average of 47.1 mm × 36.5 mm; clutches average 1-3 eggs. The eggs are brooded for about three weeks by the female while the male forages for food. <b>Bicolored</b> <b>hawk</b> chicks are categorized as semi-altricial; the eyes are open at hatching but the chicks are not immediately mobile and are fed by the parents. The young fledge around 30-36 days after hatching and the fledgling period spans nearly seven weeks, during which the young will return to the nest frequently for food until they become independent.|$|E
40|$|The {{biodiversity}} of the Bio-Bio River ecosystem {{is under}} imminent threat from {{a plan to}} build a series of six hydroelectric dams over the next decade. The purpose of this project was to survey pre-dam diurnal raptor species presence and habitat use along the Bio-Bio River corridor. My objectives were to: 1) establish areas of local species occurrence; 2) compare species abundance, richness and diversity in selected habitats; and 3) examine patterns of habitat association; and 4) provide baseline data for future ecological monitoring. The survey comprised an opportunistic, downriver, boat-based survey, and a terrestrial, limited distance point-circle count at selected study sites in the 165 -km transect along the Bio-Bio River. Observations during the ten survey trips (1992 - 1993) produced an overall count of 12 diurnal raptor species and 419 individuals, with 255 individuals observed during the downriver survey, and 164 individuals observed during the terrestrial point-count survey. The highest species abundance occurred during the downriver survey (255), while the highest species richness index was recorded during the terrestrial point-circle count (12) survey. Species diversity varied between the two methods with mean values of (H’= 1. 90, H’= 2. 05) for the downriver and terrestrial circle-point count, respectively. Along an environmental gradient, the most productive habitats for species abundance are located between river km 100 - 140. The most productive habitat for species richness, abundance, and diversity in the downriver survey was located in disturbed areas, whereas Nothofagus woodland supported the highest indices in the terrestrial circle-point count survey. Andean Condor, Peregrine Falcon, and <b>Bicolored</b> <b>Hawk</b> may function as individual indicator species or as a guild of habitat specialists {{that could be used to}} monitor environmental change along the Bio-Bio River corridor...|$|E
