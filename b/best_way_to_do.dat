5|$|During the German {{occupation}} of Norway {{as part of}} the Second World War, the Wehrmacht wanted a railway route past Trondheim which was guarded against sabotage. They decided that the <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this was to build a tunnel under the neighborhood of Tyholt. However, construction of the tunnel took much longer than expected, so instead Wehrmach started laying railway tracks in the streets in Trondheim. They planned that the railway would branch from the Dovre Line at Skansen Station and then follow Sandgata and Olav Tryggvasons gate, cross Nidelva on Bakke Bridge and then run up Innherredsveien before reaching the Meråker Line at Lademoen Station. However, by German capitulation on 8 May 1945, construction of the railway had only reached Søndre gate.|$|E
5|$|Pick became traffic {{development}} officer in 1909 and commercial manager in 1912. Albert Stanley replaced Gibb as managing director in 1910. During 1912 and 1913, the UERL increased its control over transport services in London by purchasing two tube railways, the City & South London Railway (C) and Central London Railway (CLR), {{and a number}} of bus and tram companies. One of Pick's responsibilities was to increase passenger numbers, and he believed that the <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so was by encouraging increased patronage of the company's services outside peak hours. He commissioned posters which promoted the Underground's trains and London General Omnibus Company's (LGOC's) buses as a means of reaching the countryside around London and attractions within the city. Pick realised that variety was important to maintain travellers' interest and he commissioned designs from artists working in many different styles. At the same time, he rationalised bus routes to ensure that they complemented and acted as feeder services for the company's railway lines, tripling the number of LGOC operated routes during 1912 and extending the area covered to five times its previous size. Sunday excursion services to leisure destinations were implemented to fully utilise otherwise idle buses and agreements were established with rural bus operators to coordinate services rather than compete with them.|$|E

In order to even assess the problem, tons of water need to be removed from the main channel.

Radial gates serve this purpose, they regulate the flow of water. It is imperative to keep water flowing. Lack of the flow will not only compromise all irrigation linked to that channel but also all cities linked will experience a power outage.|$|E

Based on his {{experience}} as a Latin teacher, he thought the <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this would be memorize a German grammar book and a table of its 248 irregular verbs. However, {{when he went to the}} academy to test his new language skills, he was disappointed to find out that he could not understand anything. Trying again, he similarly memorized the 800 root words of the language as well as re-memorizing the grammar and verb forms. However, the results were the same. During this time, he had isolated himself from people around him, so he tried to learn by listening, imitating and conversing with the Germans around him, but found that his carefully constructed sentences often caused native German speakers to laugh. Again he tried a more classical approach, translation, and even memorizing the entire dictionary but had no better luck.|$|E

This may be a major contributor to acquisition cost and requires a large amount of money to implement. Once all the tooling has been purchased, one of the greatest costs is labor. The experience of building an all-aluminum aircraft shows that the production process is one which may be done in many different ways.

50|$|Informal {{economic}} activity accounts for between 25 and 40 percent of Gross National Income. Meaning, some informal income {{is not really}} accounted for in the aggregate production figures. Informal {{economic activity}} really has to be addressed, and {{perhaps one of the}} <b>best</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so is <b>to</b> study the roots of such activity and phenomenon, namely the loopholes of the legal system and mercantilist thought. In the legal system, there always seems to be injustice and in such a system, there would always be favored entities and forgotten entities. The current legal system also appears to be full of loopholes which give rise to many illegitimate opportunity structures, giving people some chance to actually get around the legal system. Thus, it would definitely be important to constitute reforms in the legal system to ensure fair play in the economy. If the atmosphere of fair play can be fostered and taken care of, then it is likely that informal players would go back to the formal economy.|$|R

[...] The funeral was expensive to film; several actors, such as Sheila Larken, who played Scully's mother, needed to be flown in specifically for the scene.

When Brian tells Peter that he just has to show that he is a good parent, Peter thinks that the <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that is to show what a bad parent Cleveland is, so he brings seven prostitutes into Cleveland’s house. This does not work as Agent Jessup sees through the plot and Cleveland orders Peter and five of the prostitutes out.

Perceptions of service quality vary from person to person, but an enduring element of service quality is the consistent achievement of customer satisfaction. The satisfying of customer service needs keeps them loyal and helps establish a base for new customers. An Airline Quality Rating scale is proposed that assesses the quality of the U.

This data is not consumer opinion based, but has distinct performance characteristics that are specifically attuned to the consumers point of view. The AQR outlined here focuses on quantitative factors in order to provide a more reliable and objective result in assessing service quality levels across all major domestic airlines. The combining of quantifiable and readily available data provides an objective starting point for monitoring the quality of service an individual airline might be providing.

The name Antares refers to the red color (Anti-Mars). Just like the constellation Scorpius is the frame wherein Antares shines, the method Scorpius is the framework for the consultancy services of Antares Informatisering BV. Scorpius is not a general method, but is tailor-made for a number of common project types.
