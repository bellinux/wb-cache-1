5|$|Almost {{all cases}} of {{pituitary}} apoplexy arise from a pituitary adenoma, a <b>benign</b> <b>tumor</b> of the pituitary gland. In 80%, {{the patient has}} been previously unaware of this (although some will retrospectively report associated symptoms). It was previously thought that particular types of pituitary tumors were more prone to apoplexy than others, but {{this has not been}} confirmed. In absolute terms, only a very small proportion of pituitary tumors eventually undergoes apoplexy. In an analysis of incidentally found pituitary tumors, apoplexy occurred in 0.2% annually, but the risk was higher in tumors larger than 10mm ("macroadenomas") and tumors that were growing more rapidly; in a meta-analysis, not all these associations achieved statistical significance.|$|E

50|$|Although most <b>benign</b> <b>tumors</b> are not life-threatening, {{many types}} of <b>benign</b> <b>tumors</b> have the {{potential}} to become cancerous (malignant) through a process known as tumour progression. For this reason and other possible negative health effects, some <b>benign</b> <b>tumors</b> are removed by surgery.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} factors in classifying a <b>tumor</b> as <b>benign</b> or malignant is its invasive potential. If a tumor lacks the ability to invade adjacent tissues or spread to distant sites by metastasizing then it is benign, whereas invasive or metastatic tumours are malignant. For this reason, benign tumours are not classed as cancer. <b>Benign</b> <b>tumors</b> will grow in a contained area usually encapsulated in a fibrous connective tissue capsule. The growth rates of <b>benign</b> and malignant <b>tumors</b> also differ; <b>benign</b> <b>tumors</b> generally grow more slowly than malignant <b>tumors.</b> Although <b>benign</b> <b>tumors</b> pose a lower health risk than malignant tumors, they both can be life-threatening in certain situations. There are many general characteristics which apply to either <b>benign</b> or malignant <b>tumors,</b> but sometimes one type may show characteristics of the other. For example, <b>benign</b> <b>tumors</b> are mostly well differentiated and malignant tumors are often undifferentiated. However, undifferentiated <b>benign</b> <b>tumors</b> and differentiated malignant tumors can occur. Although <b>benign</b> <b>tumors</b> generally grow slowly, cases of fast-growing <b>benign</b> <b>tumors</b> have also been documented. Some malignant tumors are mostly non-metastatic such {{as in the case of}} basal cell carcinoma. CT and chest radiography can be a useful diagnostic exam in visualizing a benign tumour and differentiating it from a malignant tumor. The smaller the tumor on a radiograph the more likely it is to be benign as 80% of lung nodules less than 2 cm in diameter are benign. Most benign nodules are smoothed radiopaque densities with clear margins but these are not exclusive signs of <b>benign</b> <b>tumors.</b>|$|R
25|$|Lymphangiosarcoma is a {{malignant}} soft tissue tumor, whereas lymphangioma is a <b>benign</b> <b>tumor</b> occurring frequently {{in association with}} Turner syndrome. Lymphangioleiomyomatosis is a <b>benign</b> <b>tumor</b> of the smooth muscles of the lymphatics that occurs in the lungs.|$|E
25|$|Ganglioneuroma is a {{rare and}} <b>benign</b> <b>tumor</b> of the {{autonomic}} nerve fibers arising from neural crest sympathogonia, which are completely undifferentiated cells of the sympathetic nervous system. However, ganglioneuromas themselves are fully differentiated neuronal tumors that do not contain immature elements.|$|E
25|$|Most {{bilateral}} oophorectomies (63%) {{are performed}} without any medical indication, most (87%) were performed {{together with a}} hysterectomy. Conversely, unilateral oophorectomy is commonly performed for a medical indication (73%; cyst, endometriosis, <b>benign</b> <b>tumor,</b> inflammation, etc.) and less commonly in conjunction with hysterectomy (61%).|$|E
25|$|Meningiomas {{often are}} {{considered}} <b>benign</b> <b>tumors</b> {{that can be}} removed by surgery, but most recurrent meningiomas correspond to histologic <b>benign</b> <b>tumors.</b> The metabolic phenotype of these benign recurrent meningiomas indicated an aggressive metabolism resembling that observed for atypical meningioma.|$|R
5000|$|Generally, <b>benign</b> <b>tumors</b> of {{the parotid}} gland are treated with superficial(Patey's operation) or total parotidectomy with the latter being the more {{commonly}} practiced due to high incidence of recurrence. [...] The facial nerve should be preserved whenever possible. The <b>benign</b> <b>tumors</b> of the submandibular gland is treated by simple excision with preservation of mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve, the hypoglossal nerve, and the lingual nerve. Other <b>benign</b> <b>tumors</b> of minor salivary glands are treated similarly.|$|R
50|$|Primary tumors of bone can {{be divided}} into <b>benign</b> <b>tumors</b> and cancers. Common <b>benign</b> bone <b>tumors</b> may be neoplastic, developmental, traumatic, infectious, or {{inflammatory}} in etiology. Some <b>benign</b> <b>tumors</b> are not true neoplasms, but rather, represent hamartomas, namely the osteochondroma. The most common locations for many primary <b>tumors,</b> both <b>benign</b> and malignant include the distal femur and proximal tibia (around the knee joint).|$|R
25|$|Fibroadenoma of {{the breast}} is a <b>benign</b> <b>tumor</b> {{composed}} of a biphasic proliferation of both stromal and epithelial components that can be arranged in two growth patterns: pericanalicular (stromal proliferation around epithelial structures) and intracanalicular (stromal proliferation compressing the epithelial structures into clefts).|$|E
25|$|Genital warts, {{which are}} a form of <b>benign</b> <b>tumor</b> of {{epithelial}} cells, are also caused by various strains of HPV. However, these serotypes are usually not related to cervical cancer. It is common to have multiple strains at the same time, including those that can cause cervical cancer along with those that cause warts.|$|E
25|$|A lipoma is a <b>benign</b> <b>tumor</b> made of fat tissue. They are {{generally}} soft to the touch, movable, and painless.

25|$|Eye {{neoplasms}} {{can affect}} {{all parts of}} the eye, and can be a <b>benign</b> <b>tumor</b> or a malignant tumor (cancer). Eye cancers can be primary (starts within the eye) or metastatic cancer (spread to the eye from another organ). The two most common cancers that spread to the eye from another organ are breast cancer and lung cancer. Other less common sites of origin include the prostate, kidney, thyroid, skin, colon and blood or bone marrow.|$|E
25|$|Sirolimus {{also shows}} promise in {{treating}} {{tuberous sclerosis complex}} (TSC), a congenital disorder that leaves sufferers prone to <b>benign</b> <b>tumor</b> growth in the brain, heart, kidneys, skin, and other organs. After several studies conclusively linked mTOR inhibitors to remission in TSC tumors, specifically subependymal giant-cell astrocytomas in children and angiomyolipomas in adults, many US doctors began prescribing sirolimus (Wyeth's Rapamune) and everolimus (Novartis's RAD001) to TSC patients off-label. Numerous clinical trials using both rapamycin analogs, involving both children and adults with TSC, are underway in the United States.|$|E
25|$|Despite bold {{predictions}} that Woods might again {{challenge for the}} Grand Slam, he did not mount a serious charge at the 2008 Masters Tournament, struggling with his putter through each round. He would still finish alone in second, three strokes behind the champion, Trevor Immelman. On April 15, 2008, he underwent his third left knee arthroscopic surgery in Park City, Utah, and missed two months on the PGA Tour. The first surgery he had was in 1994, {{when he had a}} <b>benign</b> <b>tumor</b> removed, and the second in December 2002.

40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{describe}} the demographic characteristics and disease patterns among patients with thyroid nodular abnormali-ties (goiter) and <b>benign</b> <b>tumors</b> of the thyroid gland in Albania, a transitional country in South Eastern Europe. Methods: Our study included all patients diagnosed with goiter and/or <b>benign</b> <b>tumors</b> of the thyroid gland who were hospitalized at the University Hospital Center (UHC) “Mother Teresa ” in Tirana between 2004 and 2012 (N= 2258). All patients underwent the same examination and interviewing procedures. Demographic characteristics included gender, age, and place of residence. Binary logistic regression was used to compare the demographic char-acteristics between patients with <b>benign</b> <b>tumors</b> of the thyroid gland and those with goiter. Results: Overall, there were 2204 patients with goiter and 54 patients with <b>benign</b> <b>tumors</b> of the thyroid gland hospitalized at UHC over the period 2004 - 2012. There was no evidence of statistically significant differences in demographic characteristics (age, gender, or place of residence) between patients with <b>benign</b> <b>tumors</b> of the thyroid gland and those with goiter. Conclusions: Our study provides useful evidence on the epidemiology of <b>benign</b> <b>tumors</b> of the thyroid gland and the thyroid nodular abnormalities (goiter) in the Albanian population. Future studies in Albania should assess the main determinants of thyroid gland disorders and compare them with findings pertinent to other similar populations. Key words: <b>benign</b> <b>tumors,</b> goiter, thyroid gland, thyroid nodular abnormalities. 1...|$|R

25|$|Most {{colorectal}} cancers {{are due to}} old age {{and lifestyle}} factors with {{only a small number}} of cases due to underlying genetic disorders. Some risk factors include diet, obesity, smoking, and lack of physical activity. Dietary factors that increase the risk include red and processed meat as well as alcohol. Another risk factor is inflammatory bowel disease, which includes Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Some of the inherited genetic disorders that can cause colorectal cancer include familial adenomatous polyposis and hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer; however, these represent less than 5% of cases. It typically starts as a <b>benign</b> <b>tumor,</b> often in the form of a polyp, which over time becomes cancerous.|$|E
25|$|Crisólogo and Legasto {{began the}} novena, {{and on the}} third and fourth day, Legasto {{reported}} that she experienced a very strange feeling. This sensation, she said, was as though something heavy was moving from {{the top of her head}} down through her body before leaving her. Her health then gradually improved to the point that she travelled to the United States for further treatment. Before she left, she had a checkup; no pleurisy was found but the doctors found a <b>benign</b> <b>tumor.</b> She reported that she still felt some pain; despite the discomfort, she considers the pains she suffers as a blessing, an offering to our Lord in atonement for her sins.|$|E
25|$|Born Antonio Ramón Villar, Jr., in the City Terrace {{neighborhood}} of Los Angeles County's Eastside, he attended both Catholic and public schools. His father {{immigrated to the}} United States and became a successful businessman, but lost his wealth during the Great Depression. His young wife left him at this time. His father abandoned their family when he was 5 years old, and at age of 16, a <b>benign</b> <b>tumor</b> in his spinal column briefly paralyzed him from the waist down, curtailing his ability to play sports. His grades plummeted at Cathedral High School, and the next year, he was expelled from the Roman Catholic institution after getting into a fight after a football game.
