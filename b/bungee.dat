5|$|Douglas Hase, an {{entrepreneur}} {{who had run}} <b>bungee</b> jumping and hot air ballooning companies, tried unsuccessfully in 2003 and 2004 to get a variance for another <b>bungee</b> jumping venture. During a public hearing about Hase's proposal, a county legislator began screaming to simulate the sound neighbours would hear repetitively when people jumped off the bridge.|$|E
5|$|Between 1989 and 1991, Rahl {{installed}} planking {{and guard}} rails {{on the southern}} half of the bridge, which was then opened to the public. He allowed <b>bungee</b> jumping off the bridge until a January 1992 court order held that it violated zoning laws. One person tried to <b>bungee</b> jump off the bridge without a restraining cord. The bridge was slightly damaged by a fire in mid-1999, but it was repaired by September of that year.|$|E
5|$|The high {{mountains}} and rivers of Uttarakhand attract many tourists and adventure seekers. It {{is also a}} favorite destination for adventure sports, such as paragliding, sky diving, rafting and <b>bungee</b> jumping.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Bungees</b> {{line was}} {{launched}} in the United Kingdom by Esdevium Games on January 2012; it was later expanded to Europe and worldwide. There are 96 <b>Bungees</b> and 48 cards in this series [...] On September 2012, an additional series called Bionic <b>Bungees</b> was released in the UK. It includes 96 <b>Bungees</b> and 96 stickers.|$|R

5|$|On 12 November 2008, Felton {{appeared}} alongside Jack Osbourne on Adrenaline Junkie as {{he participated}} in various challenges in South Africa, including a 200ft <b>bungee</b> jump on Bloukrans Bridge, took a ride in a helicopter, followed by a parachute freefall and came face-to-face with Great White sharks.|$|E
5|$|GoldenEye was {{the second}} and final Bond film to be adapted to a novel by novelist John Gardner. The book closely follows the film's storyline, but Gardner added a violent {{sequence}} prior to the opening <b>bungee</b> jump in which Bond kills a group of Russian guards, a change that the video game GoldenEye 007 retained.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} part of the crew's schedule was regular exercise. They had three pieces of equipment for this: a stationary bicycle, a treadmill (TVIS), and a resistance device (IRED) for weight-lifting. The bicycle malfunctioned in mid-December 2000, and wasn't fixed until March. The treadmill, which used <b>bungee</b> cords to keep the crew member in place, was designed to reduce the vibrations caused by running. A normal treadmill would have produced enough vibrations to shake the station, and potentially affect the sensitive science experiments on board. The treadmill malfunctioned near the end of February, but some in-flight maintenance fixed the problem within a week.|$|E

5|$|Extreme {{sports are}} available, such as <b>bungee</b> jumping, water skiing, and paintballing. There are {{numerous}} tracks on the island, {{where it is}} possible to ride a bike, go for a walk, or go jogging. Apart from Ada, Belgrade has total of 16 islands on the rivers, many still unused. Among them, the Great War Island, at the confluence of Sava, stands out as an oasis of unshattered wildlife (especially birds). These areas, along with nearby Small War Island, are protected by the city's government as a nature preserve.|$|E
5|$|Gameplay is turn-based, {{with each}} team moving in sequence, which is {{determined}} randomly, across two-dimensional terrain. During a single turn, a team can only move {{one of their}} worms (unless an item that allows the team to select their worm is used). Worms can walk and jump, as well as (when the proper items are available) swing by rope, parachute, teleport, and <b>bungee.</b> The objective of a traditional match is to defeat all opposing teams by killing their worms, although in the campaign some missions have other objectives such as collecting a specific crate.|$|E
5|$|On 1 April 1979, {{the first}} modern <b>bungee</b> jumps were made from the bridge {{by members of the}} University of Oxford Dangerous Sports Club. In 2003 and 2004, the weight of crowds {{travelling}} to and from the Ashton Court Festival and Bristol International Balloon Fiesta put such great strain on the bridge that it was decided to close the bridge to all motor traffic and pedestrians during the events. The closure of the bridge for major annual events has continued each year since then.|$|E

2500|$|Production of {{the three}} models of the J-5 (-A, -B, -C), fall into two {{categories}} that differ considerably. [...] The obvious difference {{can be seen in}} the landing gear. [...] Early versions, of which 783 were built between 1940 and early 1942, have external <b>bungees.</b> Those built from 1944 to 1946 included design changes developed for the United States Navy HE-1 flying ambulance, and these models have internal <b>bungees.</b> [...] Currently over 500 J-5s remain on the FAA registry.|$|R
5|$|Rahl {{installed}} decking on {{half of the}} trestle between 1989 and 1991, {{attempting to}} open it as a <b>bungee</b> jumping platform. A court ruling found that such a venture violated zoning laws, and the town denied Rahl a variance. In 2009 the county seized the trestle, and it was sold to an environmental group. The trestle was closed in 2010 for repairs, {{and is expected to}} be opened as part of the Wallkill Valley Rail Trail in 2012.|$|E
5|$|The death scenes {{required}} {{varying degrees}} of 2D and 3D graphic enhancement, with the roller coaster scene alone being composed of 144 visual-effect shots. Custom-designed coaster cars were created and modified, based on events in the script. Most of the model was hand-built, with MEL scripts aiding specific elements. The coaster-crash scenes were filmed with the actors performing {{in front of a}} green screen with a CGI background. Several of the roller coaster's cars were suspended with <b>bungee</b> cords to film the crash, and the deaths required CGI onscreen effects; each actor had a corresponding CGI double.|$|E
5|$|Though the Binnewater rail {{station was}} {{once part of}} the {{historic}} district, it was located too close to Binnewater Road and was hit repeatedly by trucks until it fell apart in May 1989. The station was subsequently demolished by the county highway department. Another historic district, the Snyder Estate, runs along the Rosendale section. The Snyder Estate is a former mining site once used by all four major regional cement producers. The Rosendale trestle has been the site of numerous picnics, barbecues, {{and at least one}} wedding. One person has tried <b>bungee</b> jumping off the bridge without a restraining cord.|$|E

5|$|Awake {{centers on}} Michael Britten (Isaacs), a detective living in two {{separate}} realities after a car crash. In one reality, in which he wears a red wristband, his wife Hannah Britten (Laura Allen) survived the collision, and in another reality, in which he wears a green wristband, his son Rex Britten (Dylan Minnette) survived. In this episode, Michael passes out during a <b>bungee</b> jump while he is at a carnival with Rex and Emma (Daniela Bobadilla). He is unable to switch realities, consistently hallucinates and realizes that Ed Hawkins (Kevin Weisman), a detective who is working with Michael's former partner Bird (Steve Harris), was attempting to kill him in the crash. Meanwhile, Hannah deals with Emma's new baby by trying to convince her parents to let her keep the baby.|$|E
5|$|The Clifton Bridge Company {{initially}} {{managed the}} bridge under licence from a charitable trust. The trust subsequently purchased the company shares, completing this in 1949 {{and took over}} {{the running of the}} bridge using the income from tolls to pay for maintenance. The bridge is a distinctive landmark, used as a symbol of Bristol on postcards, promotional materials, and informational web sites. It was also used as a backdrop to several films and television advertising and programmes. It has also been the venue for significant cultural events such as the first modern <b>bungee</b> jump in 1979, the last ever Concorde flight in 2003 and a handover of the Olympic Torch relay in 2012.|$|E
5|$|The <b>bungee</b> jump {{was filmed}} at the Contra Dam (also {{known as the}} Verzasca or Locarno Dam) in Ticino, Switzerland. The film's casino scenes and the Tiger helicopter's {{demonstration}} were shot in Monte Carlo. Reference footage for the tank chase was shot on location in St. Petersburg and matched to the studio at Leavesden. The climactic scenes on the satellite dish were shot at Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico. The actual MI6 headquarters were used for external views of M's office. Some of the scenes in St. Petersburg were actually shot in London – the Epsom Downs Racecourse doubled as the airport – to reduce expenses and security concerns, as the second unit sent to Russia required bodyguards.|$|E
50|$|The {{project is}} {{inspired}} by Web 2.0 fiction like Gemini Division, 24's The Rookie, and webisodes from The Office. It also follows the interactive nature of <b>Bungee’s</b> I Love Bees experience, The Truth About Marika, and BMW's The Hire game. It is the first known university-sponsored web series that uses transmedia storytelling, and also the first Latter-day Saint themed web series.|$|R
50|$|Silt screws are pegs {{which are}} {{inserted}} into soft bottom sediments to tie off the guide line {{when there are}} no suitable natural formations. A common style of silt screw is a length of rigid PVC tube cut to a point at one end, with a notch at the other to secure a wrap. These are lightweight and durable, and are easily transported by attaching them to a cylinder with <b>bungees.</b>|$|R
40|$|Anklebot is a {{general-purpose}} therapeutic robot {{designed to}} guide the human ankle through motions with appropriate assistance. Anklebot relies on accurate position feedback from its actuators, {{which may or may}} not be corrupted due to slippage of Anklebot. This study seeks to quantify the slippage that exists using the current shoulder strap support system and seeks to identify new methods of support that warrant further investigation. An exoskeleton support system and a waist support system made of <b>bungees</b> attached to a belt were prototyped methods to improve upon the current shoulder strap design. Variance in the separation between markers on the knee brace and leg was used as a measure of slippage. The exoskeleton did not decrease slippage primarily due to high tolerances in the inversion-eversion joint at the heel of the shoe. The waist support system decreases slippage when enough <b>bungees</b> were attached. Further work on the waist support system is recommended. by Gregory Daniel Tao. Thesis (S. B.)

5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{started on}} 16 January 1995 and continued until 6 June. The producers {{were unable to}} use Pinewood Studios, the usual location for Bond films, {{because it had been}} reserved for First Knight, so an old Rolls-Royce factory at the Leavesden Aerodrome in Hertfordshire was converted into a new studio. In February the crew moved to Monaco and Monte Carlo for scenes in a casino and a demonstration of a Tiger helicopter. The pre-credits sequence involved a <b>bungee</b> jump, which was filmed at the Contra Dam near Locarno, Switzerland. Reference footage for a scene consisting of a tank chase was shot on location in St. Petersburg and matched to sets built at the Leavesden studio by production designer Peter Lamont. Scenes on a satellite dish were shot at Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico, while in the UK, Epsom Downs Racecourse and the Nene Valley Railway were both used. For the scenes of the fictional Russian location of Severnaya, and other effects, Derek Meddings built a number of miniature sets at Leavesden. Meddings had worked on the Bond films since Live and Let Die and died before the film's release; GoldenEye was dedicated to his memory.|$|E
5|$|Sam and Max, the Freelance Police, are two {{comic book}} {{characters}} created by Steve Purcell, who act as private detectives and vigilantes. Sam & Max Hit the Road follows the pair {{on a case}} that takes them from their office in New York City across the United States. The game starts {{in a similar way}} to many of the comic stories, with Sam and Max receiving a telephone call from an unseen and unheard Commissioner, who tells them to go to a nearby carnival. At the carnival, they are told by the owners that their star attraction, a frozen bigfoot called Bruno, has been set free and fled taking their second attraction, Trixie the Giraffe-Necked Girl. Sam and Max set off to find Bruno and Trixie and bring them back. As the duo investigate the carnival, they learn that Bruno and Trixie are in love and that Trixie freed Bruno. The Freelance Police leave the carnival to pursue leads at various tourist traps throughout the country, such as The World's Largest Ball of Twine, a vortex controlled by giant subterranean magnets and <b>bungee</b> jumping facilities at Mount Rushmore.|$|E
5|$|Similar to its predecessor, Watch Dogs 2 is an action-adventure {{game with}} stealth {{elements}} and played from a third-person perspective as protagonist Marcus Holloway, a young hacker, the game features an open world environment {{set in a}} fictionalized version of the San Francisco Bay Area, an area {{more than twice as}} large as the Chicago setting from Watch Dogs. The Bay Area consists of four different areas: San Francisco, Oakland, Marin, and Silicon Valley, all of which have different characteristics and aesthetics. Players can navigate the game's world on-foot or by the various vehicles featured in the game, such as cars, trucks, buses, cable cars, motorcycles, quad bikes and boats. The driving mechanic was overhauled and designed to be more accessible. The players can shoot their weapons while driving. Marcus also has improved acrobatic skills, and the ability to parkour around the city. Players can use different methods to approach the game's missions, choosing between the aggressive approach, in which they defeat enemies with guns which are made with a 3D printer; explosives, like mines; or Marcus' own melee weapon, a billiard ball attached to a <b>bungee</b> cord. Alternatively, players can use the stealth approach, in which they can evade enemies or paralyze them temporarily with Marcus' taser. Players can also complete the game through hacking alone. When players commit too many crimes, the police officers will become alerted and will attempt to arrest the player. The game upgrades system is a returning feature, with items being divided into three categories: Ghost, Aggressor, and Trickster. Players can choose their upgrades in accordance with their own playstyle.|$|E

40|$|Researchers use actual {{microgravity}} (AM) during parabolic {{flight and}} simulated microgravity (SM) obtained with horizontal suspension analogs {{to better understand}} the effect of gravity upon gait. In both environments, the gravitational force is replaced by an external load (EL) that returns the subject to the treadmill. However, when compared to normal gravity (N), researchers consistently find reduced ground reaction forces (GRF) and subtle kinematic differences (Schaffner et al., 2005). On the International Space Station, the EL is applied by elastic <b>bungees</b> attached to a waist and shoulder harness. While <b>bungees</b> can provide EL approaching body weight (BW), their force-length characteristics coupled with vertical oscillations of the body during gait result in a variable load. However, during locomotion in N, the EL is consistently equal to 100 % body weight. Comparisons between AM and N have shown that during running, GRF are decreased in AM (Schaffner et al, 2005). Kinematic evaluations in the past have focussed on joint range of motion rather than joint posture at specific instances of the gait cycle. The reduced GRF in microgravity may be a result of differing hip, knee, and ankle positions during contact. The purpose of this investigation was to compare joint angles of the lower extremities during walking and running in AM, SM, and N. We hypothesized that in AM and SM, joints would be more flexed at heel strike (HS), mid-stance (MS) and toe-off (TO) than in N...|$|R
