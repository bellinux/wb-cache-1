40|$|The present {{introduction}} summarises {{the debate}} on the epistemological value of testimony, with a special focus on the reductionism vs. antireductionism polemics, and situates Indian philosophers within it. One thus sees that some Indian philosophical schools (especially Vaiśeṣika and Buddhist epistemology) attempted to reduce testimony to another, more fundamental, instrument of knowledge, typically to inference, whereas others (especially Mīmāṃṣā and Nyāya) emphasised the independent nature of testimony. The study then moves to the problem of the criteria for a reliable speaker and discusses <b>border-line</b> <b>cases,</b> such as that of speaking instruments (computers, clocks and the like). Finally, it looks at some promising and open-ended topics evoked by the Indian-European dialogue on testimony...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} the UV-Vis absorption, singlet- 1 and singlet- 2 fluorescence, {{as well as}} the formation of several metalloporphyrins from equilibrial and kinetic aspects in aqueous solution. Among these complexes were numerous typical out-of-plane and several in-plane metalloporphyrins, and between the two categories, a few <b>border-line</b> <b>cases.</b> On the basis of our results, we have complemented the categorization introduced by Barnes and Dorough for the metalloporphyrins. According to our observations, also in metalloporphyrins, the distortion, i. e., the planarity or nonplanarity of the macrocycle, is basically responsible for the spectral characteristics, while the electronic structure of metal center is a secondary factor, with a considerable importance mainly in the in-plane complexes. The type of complexes can be spectrophotometrically determined {{on the basis of their}} UV-Vis absorption and fluorescence spectra. Beside the spectral and photophysical effects of metalation, also those of the structural distortions were studied, which can originate also from metalation, protonation or overcrowded peripheral substitution of the free-base porphyrins, as well as from the axial ligation of metalloporphyrins. Our observation may be useful for different spectrophotometric analytical detection and determination methods, e. g. size-selective metal detection using free-base porphyrins (or other ringed chelate ligands), {{as well as the}} determination of Lewis bases as potential axial ligands, using metalloporphyrins. ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{undertakes}} {{a critical}} {{assessment of a}} very topical and highly debated question {{in the development of}} EU competition law: does the European Merger Control Regulation apply to concentrations that result in collective (or joint respectively oligopolistic) dominance? And, if so, under what conditions?The study suggests that the Merger Control Regulation does, indeed, cover cases of collective dominance. It recommends, however, that a proposed transaction should only be blocked on grounds of collective dominance if it raises substantive doubts that the transaction will create an anti-competitive market structure (like, for example, the Gencor/Lonrho case). Should the doubts not attain the required level, then a two-stage approach is suggested. The first stage would have to screen the proposed transaction as being reasonably capable of guaranteeing a competitive environment (despite the initial doubts as to the collective dominance issue). The second stage would be opened only if the Commission has legitimate reasons to believe that the firms concerned are effectively involved in either concerted practices (Art. 85 EEC Treaty) or in a collective abuse of a dominant position (Art. 86). Interestingly, the Commission seems to have adopted a similar approach in some of the latest <b>border-line</b> <b>cases.</b> After an extensive analysis of the landmark decision Nestle/Perrier, this thesis finds that the described two-stage approach would also have been appropriate in this case...|$|R
40|$|SYNOPSIS The T 4 -free {{thyroxine}} {{index was}} used as the thyroid function test of first choice in a district general hospital for one year. Ninety-two patients were assessed both initially and at follow up by a single physician. The index agreed with clinical assessment in 69 out of 74 patients in whom diagnosis was unequivocal. There was initial doubt about thyroid status in 14 patients; after re-assessment the index agreed with status in seven cases, in three cases there is still some uncertainty, whilst the index was at variance with clinical status in four patients. Some possible causes of dis-crepancy between clinical thyroid status and the index are a low index in euthyroid patients due to a fall in serum thyroxine-binding prealbumin ('sick euthyroid'), a raised index in euthyroid patients due to latent thyroid heart disease, and a normal index in thyrotoxicosis due to preferential secre-tion of triiodothyronine. Assessment of thyroid status is a clinical problem in which laboratory tests play an important but sub-sidiary role; of these the indirect assessment of free thyroxine as a free thyroxine index or factor (Table I) {{has been found to be}} a valuable approach. A good thyroid function test must be able to give an ab-normal result in definite cases of under- or over-activity of the gland, be helpful in difficult or <b>border-line</b> <b>cases,</b> and be technically feasible for a normal work load. Preliminary results with the T 4 -free thyroxine index (T 4 -FTI, which is the product o...|$|R
40|$|This article {{begins with}} a few {{preliminary}} terminological explanations which the author believes to be necessary: al the distinction between transfusions and transplants, which are usually included {{in the same category}} by moralists and jurists; bl the difference between transplants of organs, tissues, and members. The author then proceeds to study the right over one's own body, with the understanding that the well-known formula homo non est dominus membrorum suorum must be interpreted juridically as the inexistence of any absolute right of disposition over one's own body. The contents and limits of the right over one's own body are regulated by three principies: the indirect voluntary (double effectl principie, the principie of totality, and the moderata castigatio corporis. With regard to transfusions, the author points out the requirements of liceity on the part of donor and recipient, and draws particular attention upon the subject of conscientious objectors (i. e., Jehovah's Witnessesl. In relation to trasplants, the author studies those which have been performed directly between humans, with special attention given to those between two living persons. The liceity of this last case -apart from other requirements which are expounded upon in detail- rests upon the following conditions: al that the finalit Y of the donation be an act of human solidarity; bl that the donor not become gravely jeopardized as a result. With regard to transplants between a deceased donor and a live recipient, the authors insists upon the need to respect the cadaver and to secure due authorization. The author also studies, with special care, <b>border-line</b> <b>cases</b> in which the donor may find himself: hopeless, clinically dead, artificially alive, recuperable...|$|R
40|$|IN 1954 COOPERATIVE STUDIES were {{begun by}} a {{psychiatrist}} (M. G.) and an intern-ist (J. V. T.) {{that led to}} a new technique of psychiatric consultation (1). These consul-tations were conducted in the internist's office with the internist present. Instead of being sent into the new and foreboding environment of a psychiatrist's office, the patient would come to the familiar situa-tion of his internist's office where he was more at ease and had less tendency to de-velop special defenses. Our original consultations involved three individuals: the patient, the consulting psy-chiatrist, who as guest in the internist's office was the central figure, and the intern-ist, who was the host. This three-cornered arrangement, referred to as "the psycho-somatic triangle, " offered the advantage of continuing the doctor-patient relationship as it had been established before the con-sultant appeared. Thus, the visiting psy-chiatrist entered this relationship, made himself a part of it, used it to best advan-tage as he saw fit, and then stepped out of it again, if handled properly, without sig-nificant disturbance. The flow of associa-tion was easier, more spontaneous, and of milder intensity {{than it would have been}} in the psychiatrist's office. Although the evaluation was psychiatric, the atmosphere remained medical, centering around the medical problem. The advantages of this method of psy-chiatric consultation for each of the three participants have been discussed in detail previously (1). Suffice it to say that the in-ternist found that he could arrange these consultations with ease, avoiding the re-sistance of sending his patient to a psychia-trist; and the psychiatrist, by being called in to see many patients he would not ordi-narily see, obtained a broader view of psy-chosomatic problems in general, of <b>border-line</b> <b>cases</b> of normality, and of some very sick psychotic patients, earlier, before their breaking point. From the patient's stand-point, the joint consultation in the intern-ist's office gave him direct understanding of the inextricable interaction of his physi-cal and emotional problems...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{follows the}} {{development}} of the ways by which successive Australian Governments, from World War I onwards, have attempted to provide a measure of compensation to veterans who suffered injury or disease on war service, and to dependants of veterans whose death could be related to war service. Initially, purely local assessment and determination of claims within a broad framework was applied, but lack of consistency around the country forced the setting up of an entirely new department of government, devoted to serving the ex-service community. Superimposed, in the interest of fairness, was a multiple-level system of review and appeal in a sequence of Boards, Tribunals and, eventually, the Federal Court and High Court, with substantial involvement of lawyers appearing for claimants or the government. As detailed assessment of the effects of disease and injury are a matter for specialists, the medical profession has also become deeply involved in the determination process, but with an all too frequent display of diametrically opposed views on the relationship, if any, of a particular veteran's present conditions and the incomplete record of what happened to him during his time in the Forces. As in other spheres of law, corroboration of a claimant's evidence is highly desirable, but the sheer lapse of time, half a century in the case now of World War II veterans, has made if often impossible to find witnesses with a reliable memory and willing to sign a Statutory Declaration. Increasingly, too, and especially in regard to certain conditions, lack of direct evidence has been relieved by the use of epidemiological data, whereby an acknowledged extra risk has been usable to grant a claim, often long after the death of the veteran concerned. Claims which are seen to lie at the extremes of acceptance or rejection are relatively easy to assess. The inevitable doubt attached to <b>border-line</b> <b>cases</b> are a different matter as shown by the detailed examples in the text. Lest it be thought that the last word has been said on the subject, there is now (June 1994) yet another piece of amending legislation before Parliament, containing some provisions likely to be resisted by the ex-service community. Finally, a plea is made for the abandonment of the present squabbling on medical and legal grounds in favour of a two-tiered, but otherwise universal, flat rate. Adjustment of actual rates of pension should enable this approach to reach the usual objective of budgetary neutrality and is suggested as likely to attract wide approval by those affected...|$|R
40|$|The {{essence of}} an {{examination}} is stated to be measurement and the thesis analyses the measurements given by some examinations. The methods of scoring examination marks {{and the application}} of them are outlined. (i) Factor Analysis of Marks with different Types of Scoring. The marks of two university examinations for eight consecutive years are analysed. In the case of one examination, the instructions given to the examiners demand that the marks should approximately fit a normal distribution curve. The other examination papers are marked without restrictions. In this section an endeavour has been made to determine whether the instructions to fit the marks to a normal distribution curve affect the factors obtained by analysis. (ii) Analysis of Variance of Two Sets of Scores for Some. Examination Candidates The college assessment and the examiner's mark for one subject in a university examination are analysed to test the significance of the difference between the variances of the two sets of scores. The revising examiner has marked independently some of the <b>border-line</b> <b>cases</b> together with some of the poorest and best papers picked at random. The significance of the difference between the variances of these re-markings and the original marks is also tested. (iii) Correlations between Persons. The marks of an examination for entrance to secondary schools are analysed. In this case the same candidates are examined in both 1937 and 1938. One purpose of this analysis is to determine the change if any, in the factor saturations for the set of persons after the lapse of a year, using Burt's method. The second aim is to try out another method which has recently been evolved and to test the agreement of the results obtained by this method with those obtained by using Burt's method. Results and Conclusions The main conclusions are:- (i) According to the data used in this research, fitting the score-scatter to a normal distribution curve does not influence the resulting factors. Some interesting facts concerning the individual examinations are revealed. (ii) In many cases the difference between the college assessment and the examiner's marks is significant. There is evidence that there is no difference in the average mark assigned by the first and revising examiners, and that the marks do bear some relation to the ability of the individual concerned. (iii) There is reasonable agreement in the first factor saturation of the marks of both years but there are differences in value and sign {{in the second and third}} factor saturations. The other method used gives results which agree to the degree of accuracy used. <p...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{epidemiology}} of {{a disease}} describes numbers of people becoming incident, being prevalent, recovering, surviving, and dying from the disease or from other causes. As a matter of accounting principle, the inflow, stock, and outflows must be compatible, and if we could observe completely every person involved, the epidemiologic estimates describing the disease would be consistent. Lack of consistency is an indicator for possible measurement error. Methods: We examined the consistency of estimates of incidence, prevalence, and excess mortality of dementia from the Rotterdam Study. We used the incidence and excess mortality estimates to calculate with a mathematical disease model a predicted prevalence, and compared the predicted to the observed prevalence. Results: Predicted prevalence is in most age groups lower than observed, {{and the difference between}} them is significant for some age groups. Conclusions: The observed discrepancy could be due to overestimates of prevalence or excess mortality, or an underestimate of incidence, or a combination of all three. We conclude from an analysis of possible causes that {{it is not possible to}} say which contributes most to the discrepancy. Estimating dementia incidence in an aging cohort presents a dilemma: with a short follow-up <b>border-line</b> incident <b>cases</b> are easily missed, and with longer follow-up measurement problems increase due to the associated aging of the cohort. Checking for consistency is a useful strategy to signal possible measurement error, but some sources of error may be impossible to avoid...|$|R

They deal in the obscure but make it obvious, and they treat it with common sense [...] They take their time, th ey are slower than lawyers, they {{have a kind of}} selfish patience. Paul Theroux (I) Waldinger and Gunderson's recent book, Effective Psychotherapy with <b>Border-line</b> Patients: <b>Case</b> Studies, (2), while not intended specifically for residents, is an important work which deserves a broad audience and has some special rel evance to psychiatric trainees. Residents, from the earliest stages of their training, will find these patients remarkably even dismayingly common in emergency room, inpatient unit, consultation/liaison, and outpatient clinic settings. T he colli sion of a patient population "notoriously difficult to treat and prone to develop severe and sometimes life- th reaten ing transference reactions in exp lo ra to ry treatment " with a beginning therapist will be a mutually trying one. More limited in skills, experience, and confidence, residents may be prone to accept the projected helplessness and hostility of the borderline patient; pessimism and burnout become the resident's refuge. As Wa ldinger points out in the book's introductory overview, thi s pessi-mism involving the use of psychodynamic therapy dates back to th e earl ies t clinical descript ions of the borderline patient wh ich arose from the difficulties inherent in this treatment method. Thus, Zetzel and others found highly structured supportive work the only option for these patients almost by defin i-tion excluded from dynamic therapy.

40|$| {{auditive}} medium {{are directly}} related to the degree of success achieved in the teaching of the blind. The School for the Blind at Worcester has a tape recording studio and a braille printing works. In order to try and ensure that the blind child will arrive at meaningful interpretation and the accurate forming of concepts, use is made, inter alia, of true-to-life models which the child can feel. The hostel as an educational milieu has been established by the educational authorities but does not, as such, constitute a natural educational environment. Justice can only be done to the task of education in the hostel if the child accepts the authority of the house parents, education by means of identification succeeds, house parents are required to assume responsibility for educating only a fairly small group of children and one guards against the real danger of isolating the blind child. The considerably distances between many parental homes and the School for the Blind at Worcester cause some pupils to visit their parents at home comparatively rarely and liaison between parents and staff is also affected as a result. Apart from the more formal educational, training and guidance programmes which are offered, schools for the blind have a particular responsibility in various other respects. Instruction in orientation and mobility, {{as well as in the}} mastery of everyday household tasks, is provided at the School for the Blind at Worcester. An important aim of the participation of the blind in recreational and cultural activities is to promote their social integration in the seeing community. Various schools for the blind in overseas countries devote attention to sex education. The formal sex and marriage guidance programme which is offered at the Bartimeus Institute in Zeist (Nether= lands) is regarded as successful and even parents of blind day scholars have requested that their children be included in this programme. Fields of study in which blind school-leavers of the School for the Blind continue their studies at tertiary training institutions are the following: Theology, law, teaching, physiotherapy, social work and music. Students sometimes experience specific problems in obtaining textbooks in braille or on tape. Fields of study in which some blind persons are studying at the tertiary level in overseas countries but which have not, at this stage been established as fields of study with occupational possibilities for the blind are nursing, programming, journalism and the natural sciences. In addition to the School for the Blind, there are various bodies which concern themselves with the occupational placement of the blind, as well as with after-care on behalf of blind persons who pursue occupations. The major problem with regard to the occupational placement of the blind is the fact that occupational opportunities are limited which renders difficult an accountable occupational choice on the part of the blind person. Blind persons in the United States of America enter a wider variety of occupations than in the case of any other country involved in the investigation. The exploration of accessible occupations for the blind in the USA is based mainly on occupational analysis and various occupations are split up in such a way that blind persons may be integrated productively. In the light of the investigation, recommendations were made in respect of the following aspects of the education for the blind in the RSA: 1. The control of education for blind pupils. 2. Certain organizational aspects of the education for blind pupils. 3. Provision for the pre-school blind child. 4. Measures with reference to the admission of pupils to schools for the blind. 5. Differentiation in various study courses with reference to different categories of blind pupils. 6. The curricula with reference to various study courses and school phases. 7. Grouping of pupils and, in particular, the combined instruction of blind and partially sighted pupils (<b>border-line</b> <b>cases)</b> in the classroom. 8. Continued vocational training at schools for the blind and the nature of the vocational training courses. 9. The training of teaching staff. 10. Staffing at schools for the blind. 11. Psychological and guidance services at schools for the blind. 12. The production of literature in braille and on tape and the manufacture of other educational aids. 13. The integration of braille candidates in ophthalmic and optometric services and the provision of medical and paramedical services with reference to multihandicapped blind children. 14. Measures regarding residential schools for the blind. 15. The expansion of the teaching of orientation and mobility to blind children, use of leisure, the social integration of the blind child, marriage and sex guidance to blind children, and the creation of opportunities for blind children to realise their creative potential. 16. Measures to promote the occupational placement of blind school-leavers. 17. The expansion of occupational opportunities for the blind. These recommendations with regard to the formal and formative education of the blind in the RSA envisage the introduction of certain essential innovations, the eliminations of existing crucial problems and the extension of differentiated education.
