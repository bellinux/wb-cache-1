5|$|The Haas {{brothers}} began {{competing for}} Combat Zone Wrestling (CZW) in November 1999, losing to The King Pinz at The War Begins on November 20, 1999. They competed regularly for CZW throughout early 2000, {{and won the}} CZW World Tag Team Championship on February 12 at Climbing The Ladder by defeating The Kashmerino Brothers and The Thrill Kill Kult in a three-way match. On July 10, they lost the championship to The <b>Backseat</b> Boyz at Caged To The End, when Johnny Kashmere defeated Russ in a singles match and was awarded the championship.|$|E
5|$|After debuting in 1996 as a {{professional}} wrestler, Haas regularly teamed with his brother Russ for numerous independent promotions. On July 22, 1998, The Haas Brothers won the Jersey All Pro Wrestling Tag Team Championship by defeating The Skin Head Express. They lost it to The Nation of Immigration just over a month later on August 25. They won the championship {{for the second time}} on May 21, 1999, by defeating The Big Unit (Rick Silver and Dave Desire), and held the championship until February 25, 2000 when they were defeated by Da Hit Squad. During 2000 they also held the Pennsylvania Championship Wrestling Tag Team Championship and the ECWA Tag Team Championship in the East Coast Wrestling Association promotion, which they won by defeating The <b>Backseat</b> Boyz (Trent Acid and Johnny Kashmere).|$|E
5|$|As of September 2017, Adams {{has four}} {{upcoming}} projects. She will play Lois Lane {{for the third}} time in Justice League, following which she will return to television for Sharp Objects, an HBO miniseries based on Gillian Flynn's thriller novel of the same name. She will serve as an executive producer for the series and star as Camille Preaker, a disgruntled reporter who returns to her hometown to cover the murder of two young girls. Adams has also committed to star in <b>Backseat,</b> Adam McKay's biopic of the 46th Vice President of the United States Dick Cheney, in which she plays Cheney's wife, Lynne; it will mark her third collaboration with Christian Bale. In addition, she will reprise the role of Giselle in a sequel to Enchanted, entitled Disenchanted.|$|E
50|$|Ham and Ex {{are reading}} {{a press release}} about their uncle Beans who is flying north to explore an old galleon. Outside, Beans is {{preparing}} his aircraft for his trip to the north. Without their uncle's knowledge, Ham and Ex board the <b>backseats.</b> Beans himself finally hops in and flies the aircraft.|$|R
50|$|The W169 is {{constructed}} with high-strength steel alloys with bonded joints. It {{has a large}} number of airbags including optional rear side airbags (for side-impacts in the <b>backseats),</b> optional side-curtain airbags, and standard head and thorax-protection side airbags. The front airbags are adaptive with two-stage gas generators operating according to the severity of accident.|$|R
50|$|However, two-door cars {{in general}} {{have fallen in}} popularity, with the popular {{exception}} of convertibles and two-seat roadsters. Sedans, pickup trucks and SUVs/station wagons have had fewer two-door models (especially ones with <b>backseats)</b> in recent years since the cost of four-door cars has gone down along with engineering to ease access to the back seat area.|$|R
5|$|At the prom, Artie and Marge are voted prom {{king and}} queen, {{and the two}} share the first dance. Meanwhile, Homer, heartbroken, leaves and cries in the hallway. After the prom, Artie tries to get romantic with Marge in the <b>backseat</b> of his car: after he pushes his luck too far, she slaps him and demands to be taken home. Meanwhile, Homer's {{limousine}} time has run out, and without any money, he decides to walk home. Along the way Marge and Artie pass by Homer. After Artie drops Marge off at her house, she returns in her car to pick up Homer, realizing {{that he was the}} man for her all along. Homer manages to fix up the strap of Marge's dress with the corsage that he got her after Artie ruined it from his earlier attempt.|$|E
5|$|Cagney {{was even}} more violent towards women in the gangster film Picture Snatcher (1933): in one scene, he knocks out an amorous woman whose {{feelings}} he does not reciprocate and violently throws her into the <b>backseat</b> of his car. In April 1931, the same month as the release of The Public Enemy, Hays recruited former police chief August Vollmer to conduct {{a study on the}} effect gangster pictures had on children. After he had finished his work, Vollmer stated that gangster films were innocuous and even overly favorable in depicting the police. Although Hays used the results to defend the film industry, the New York State censorship board was not impressed, and from 1930 through 1932, removed 2,200 crime scenes from pictures.|$|E
5|$|In Queens, New York, police chase a sedan driven {{through a}} parking garage by two men keeping a teenage boy named Tyler Carson (Cameron Monaghan) in the <b>backseat.</b> Police {{officers}} surround the car and draw their weapons, demanding that the men exit the car. They do, and Tyler stays in his seat. Without explanation, {{one of the officers}} walks backwards to the parking ramp and jumps to his death. Another officer shoots her two remaining co-workers, then herself. The kidnappers' crime spree continues on the road. One of them, Hickey (John Tench), demands that a convenience store clerk hand over all his cash. Another customer tries to intervene, but then takes a pot of hot coffee, pours the coffee over his own head, and beats himself with the pot. The cashier then electrocutes himself.|$|E
50|$|Johannes Beeskow, a Rometsch designer, {{built the}} first {{prototype}} of a four door sedan in 1950; the donor vehicle being a Volkswagen Beetle in scrap condition. Rometsch took this concept into {{the production of a}} taxicab. The wheelbase had been stretched by about 27 cm. Access to the <b>backseats</b> was made more accessible by adding suicide doors. Thereafter, original doors were modified.|$|R
5000|$|The show's narrator flies Blue Angel 7, a two-seat F/A-18D Hornet, to show sites. The Blues {{use this}} jet for backup, {{and to give}} {{demonstration}} rides to VIP civilians. Three <b>backseats</b> at each show are available; one of them goes {{to members of the}} press, the other two to [...] "Key Influencers". [...] The No. 4 slot pilot often flies the No. 7 aircraft in Friday's [...] "practice" [...] shows.|$|R
5000|$|The WCC crew {{removed the}} <b>backseats</b> and {{replaced}} it with the MTX Audio JackHammer, a 22-inch subwoofer weighing 369 pounds. A decibel meter was installed in the dash to alert Jake to keep it down. Uniquely, due to wanting a retro 1950s nature for the car, this would perhaps be the only car in Pimp My Rides history to have flat black paint, and alloys replaced with regular steel wheels, whitewalls, and hubcaps.|$|R
5|$|The {{track was}} {{released}} {{as the second}} single from Watch the Throne on July 20, 2011. The song peaked at number 12 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and reached position 2 on both the Billboard Hot Rap Songs and Hot R/Hip-Hop Songs charts. The song has since been certified Platinum for sales exceeding 1,000,000. The song received a music video directed by Spike Jonze on August 2011. The video primarily shows West and Jay-Z modifying a Maybach luxury car and then driving around in it with no doors or windows, while four girls are smiling in the <b>backseat.</b> After its release, the video was met with positive reception. The cover art was designed by Italian fashion designer Riccardo Tisci.|$|E
5|$|Agriculture, {{which was}} once a major {{occupation}} {{of the people of}} Dakshina Kannada, has taken a <b>backseat</b> because of the influx of money from natives settled in other cities, states and countries. Significant number of people from this district work in the Gulf (Middle East) countries and other states of India. Farms and fields are being converted into residential plots and commercial (shopping) complexes. Horticulture, though, has made some strides, and measures have been taken to improve the fruit plantation sector. The main crops of Dakshina Kannada are Paddy, Coconut, Arecanut, Black Pepper, Cashew and Cocoa. Rubber, Banana and Vanilla crops are also cultivated in the Sullia taluk. Rice is generally cultivated three seasons in a year, Karthika or Yenel (May–October), Suggi (October to January) and Kolake (January to April). Urad (Black gram) is grown in some areas during the season of Suggi. The Karnataka Milk Federation has a milk processing plant at Kulshekar in Mangalore. This plant processes milk procured from the cattle owned by farmers of the district.|$|E
5|$|At home, Homer {{finds the}} {{personalized}} bowling glove given to Marge by Jacques and realizes {{he may be}} losing her. It is not long until Bart realizes that Lisa's suspicions are proving to be true about their parents drifting apart and offers Homer some advice in keeping his mouth shut so it does not get worse. At work the next day, he cannot bring himself to eat the sandwich she made for him, {{saying that it is}} all he has left of her. Marge leaves for her meeting with Jacques, but finds herself reminded of lifetime commitment throughout the drive. She comes to a fork in the road, one way leading to the nuclear plant, the other to Jacques' apartment. After an agonized hesitation at the crux of the decision, she surprises Homer at the plant and kisses him warmly. An ecstatic Homer abandons his work post to carry Marge away in his arms. His co-workers want to know what to tell the boss. To the sound of their cheers, he says to say {{that they are going to}} the <b>backseat</b> of his car and will not be back for ten minutes.|$|E
50|$|Trace Dempsey Cyrus (born Neil Timothy Helson; February 24, 1989) is an American musician. The son {{of country}} singer Billy Ray Cyrus and brother of {{recording}} artist Miley Cyrus, {{he is the}} backing vocalist and bassist of the band Metro Station. He left the band in 2010 but returned in 2014. In 2010, he began providing vocals and guitar in the pop rock band Ashland HIGH. He also owns the clothing company From <b>Backseats</b> to Bedrooms.|$|R
5000|$|Saint Mary's {{basketball}} and volleyball teams play their home {{games at the}} McKeon Pavilion, which has a capacity of 3,500. It was named after George R. McKeon, {{a former member of}} the college's Board of Regents. Constructed in 1978, it underwent renovations in the summer of 2006, with new features including painted bleachers, new chair <b>backseats</b> behind the reserved section, a remodeled VIP section, and a banner with [...] "GaelForce" [...] on it behind the student section.|$|R
50|$|Leonardo Sang is {{best known}} for his <b>Backseats</b> in Games collection, which {{features}} black and white photographs taken from Project C.A.R.S. and WCR 3. His technique includes the use of FRAPS, post-processing, and sometimes a phone or camera. Sang started a Tumblr in 2011, which holds more than 470 images. He tends to add grain to his photographs to achieve a look closer to that of 35mm film. Sang, a Brazilian, has had his work exhibited in San Paulo and Rio Grande do Sul.|$|R
5|$|The Brothers did {{not appear}} for JAPW again until late 2005, again in a tables, ladders, and chairs match for the tag team title, this time against the teams of Teddy Hart and Homicide, the <b>Backseat</b> Boyz, and The S.A.T.. The match, which took place at JAPW's 8th Year Anniversary Show, was won Hart and Homicide. At the next show, Fall Out, the S.A.T. {{defeated}} them and thus became number one contenders to the tag team championship. More recent JAPW appearances came in early 2006, losing along with the Outcast Killers to the S.A.T. once again at Wild Card II in a tag team title match, and then at Brotherly Love to the team of Sabu and Sonjay Dutt, a match they also lost. In October 2008, the Briscoes competed at JAPW's 11th Anniversary Show against LAX (Homicide and Hernandez). During a brawl outside the ring, Mark suffered a large gash {{on the side of}} his head.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} written by {{executive}} producer Diane Ruggiero and directed by John T. Kretchmer, marking Ruggiero's sixteenth and penultimate writing credit and Kretchmer's twelfth directing credit. One scene in the episode depicts Veronica and Max sitting in the <b>backseat</b> of a vehicle with Chelsea's pimp (a woman) and several bodyguards. Kretchmer decided to place one of the physically domineering bodyguards between Max and Veronica for comedic effect. In addition, Thomas noted that the actress of the pimp, Jackie Debatin, appeared in a similar role in an episode of The Office several weeks after the episode aired. The scene in which Keith, in a Sheriff's uniform, spots Don Lamb in his car was difficult to edit because although there was initially no radio music playing, Michael Muhney, the actor of Lamb, was moving his mouth as if singing lyrics. Thomas reported difficulty in finding a song that would match the movements.|$|E
5|$|Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) asks Dunder Mifflin CEO David Wallace (Andy Buckley) if he {{can work}} {{part-time}} so he can go to Philadelphia to help with his sports marketing job. David Wallace says {{that he might be}} needed in the office if there is a crisis with one of his clients, to which he responds that Stanley Hudson (Leslie David Baker) and Phyllis Vance (Phyllis Smith) have agreed to cover for him, though he in fact has not asked them yet. Stanley and Phyllis respond with their usual disinterest in helping others, so Jim offers to treat them to lunch. Stanley and Phyllis order extra side dishes and help themselves to an excess of wine, annoying Jim with drunken behavior and silencing him whenever he brings up the subject of their covering for him. When they arrive back at the office, a drunk Stanley and Phyllis are seemingly passed out in the <b>backseat</b> of Jim's car. When Jim puts his coat on them to keep them warm, Phyllis and Stanley say they will cover for him as they care for Jim and his family, laughing as they reveal they were only pranking him. Jim gives both of them a hug.|$|E
5000|$|Tom Huddleston of Time Out gave Triple 9 {{four out}} of five stars, {{positively}} comparing the film to Michael Mann's Heat. Huddleston praised the ensemble cast and concluded that the film is [...] "carried off with brashness and momentum by a director who genuinely seems to be having a blast." [...] Variety's Justin Chang was less receptive towards the film's narrative, but applauded its action sequences and wrote that the [...] "result is a film that conveys the eerie sense of lying in wait for all its characters, and the paranoia is infectious, with at least two scenes certain to have viewers checking their car <b>backseats</b> upon exiting the theater.|$|R
50|$|The {{relative}} {{success of}} Songling LCAC and Type 711 LCAC encouraged further development {{and it was}} decided to utilize the experience gained on both types to develop a new LCAC designated Type 724. However, due to political turmoil in China, namely, Cultural Revolution, program was delayed more than a decade. The requirement of Type 724 was once again proposed after the end of Cultural Revolution, but in the era of Chinese economic reform, military projects were put on <b>backseats,</b> and the program was once again delayed for another decade. However, the delay also meant that more advanced technologies appeared in those two decades can be adopted to perfect the original designs of Type 711 LCAC and Songling LCAC to produce better result for the proposed Type 724 LCAC. Type 724 LCAC finally entered service in the mid-1990s and more than two dozen were built.|$|R
25|$|On 24 June 1922, {{two months}} after the signing of the Treaty of Rapallo (which renounced German {{territorial}} claims from World War I), Rathenau was assassinated. On this Saturday morning, Rathenau had himself chauffeured from his house in Berlin-Grunewald to the Foreign Office in Wilhelmstraße. During the trip, his NAG-Convertible was passed by a Mercedes-Touring car with Ernst Werner Techow behind the wheel and Erwin Kern and Hermann Fischer on the <b>backseats.</b> Kern opened fire with a MP 18-submachine gun at close range, killing Rathenau almost instantly, while Fischer threw a hand grenade into the car before Techow quickly drove them away. Also involved in the plot were Techow's younger brother Hans Gerd Techow, future writer Ernst von Salomon, and Willi Günther (aided and abetted by seven others, some of them schoolboys). All conspirators were members of the ultra-nationalist secret Organisation Consul (O.C.). A memorial stone in the Königsallee in Grunewald marks the scene of the crime.|$|R
5|$|At {{the end of}} 2001 {{and into}} 2002, CZW's {{territory}} (that is, the area at which they held {{the majority of their}} events) was shifting from Sewell, New Jersey to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in order to hold events regularly at the old ECW arena, beginning with December 15's Cage of Death 3. At this event, they faced Nick Gage and Nate Hatred, but wore masks and were identified as The Midnight Outlaws. This was likely to get around the fact that Jay was only 17 and Mark only 16 at the time; this meant, as they were under 18 years of age, that they could not legally work in a sport wrestling exhibition in the state of Pennsylvania. As CZW regularly began holding shows in the Philadelphia area, the Midnight Outlaws made appearances at the next four CZW events. At A Higher Level of Pain on April 13, 2002, Jay appeared across the ring from the Midnight Outlaws, tagging with Ruckus against Mark and someone else. By this time, he had turned 18. Jay and Ruckus were won the match, and this was the last time either Jay or Mark appeared for CZW until April 12, 2003, where Jay and Mark both returned for Best of the Best 3. Jay was a surprise entrant after being taunted by A.J. Styles, and Mark filling in for the injured Ruckus. Jay advanced to the semi finals, where he lost to B-Boy, and Mark lost his fill-in match to Sonjay Dutt. The two faced off with the <b>Backseat</b> Boyz for the CZW World Tag Team Championship at Truth or Consequences on June 14, but failed to win the belts.|$|E

60|$|This theory {{became one}} of the major tenets of his preaching, and was {{especially}} efficacious in cleansing the consciences of the back-sliders from all other faiths who else, in the secrecy of their subconscious selves, were being crushed by the weight of the Judas sin. To Abel Ah Yo, God's plan was as clear as if he, Abel Ah Yo, had planned it himself. All would be saved in the end, although some took longer than others, and would win only to <b>backseats.</b> Man's place in the ever-fluxing chaos of the world was definite and pre-ordained--if by no other token, then by denial that there was any ever-fluxing chaos. This was a mere bugbear of mankind's addled fancy; and, by stinging audacities of thought and speech, by vivid slang that bit home by sheerest intimacy into his listeners' mental processes, he drove the bugbear from their brains, showed them the loving clarity of God's design, and, thereby, induced in them spiritual serenity and calm.|$|R
50|$|Compared to most compact cars of that time, the Nissan Presea {{was quite}} long. The R10 stood at 4420 mm, 15 {{centimetres}} {{longer than the}} Sentra. It was also rather low for a sedan at 1320 mm; with passengers often feeling the need to stoop {{to get into the}} car. At 1690 mm wide, it was as wide as it needed to be for two adults (and possibly a child) in the rear seats. The slightly longer wheelbase (compared to the Sunny) at 2500 mm was class-leading for that era of compact cars. All these dimensions added up to a comfortable (albeit low) car with decent comfort and presence. The boot space was more than adequate, at over 300 L in capacity. Due to the way the <b>backseats</b> lean back (which in turn gave the rear passengers a lot more comfort), objects over 1000 mm in length and 1200 mm in width could fit. The boot height of over 400 mm also allowed for a competent handling of most purchases during shopping sprees. However the narrow aperture height limited its usability.|$|R
50|$|The video {{begins with}} the band members loading their silver car with {{recording}} equipment {{in front of the}} Stefani household. Gwen Stefani stands in front of a damaged red car and sings. They drive away, with Tom Dumont, Gwen Stefani and Tony Kanal sitting in the <b>backseats.</b> The band arrive at a building where Stefani enters the ladies' bathroom, carrying a boombox, {{and the rest of the}} band enters the gents', carrying speakers, instruments and electrical equipment. The ladies' bathroom is clean, brightly decorated and well furnished with flowers, fruit and two female assistants. The gents' bathroom is dark, dirty and bare-walled. The men set up and play their equipment in the gents' while Stefani sings in ladies'. Various men and women enter their respective bathrooms; the men use the urinals and the women check their make-up, before dancing with the band. Eventually, the men take to lifting each other through the ceiling to get into the other bathroom and the video ends with everyone dancing together in the ladies'.|$|R

5000|$|Engadget's Alex Ziebart {{wrote that}} [...] "Tyrande Whisperwind {{has been a}} central part of the Alliance since way back in vanilla WoW. She was one of the key figures in the events of Warcraft III, and she's had a {{substantial}} role in the course of Azeroth as a whole." [...] However, her relationship with Malfurion was still criticised, as [...] "Tyrande, a powerful and dangerous woman, is instantly <b>backseated</b> the moment her beloved beau Malfurion shows up on the scene", and [...] "the display of strength she pulls off ... is immediately forgotten about ... everything she does occurs in the background." [...] Yannick Lejacq of Kotaku listed the references to the relationship between Tyrande and Illidan as one of the positive aspects of Heroes of the Storm, saying [...] "Tyrande Whisperwind and Illidan Stormrage have a tenuous romantic past from their days together in World of Warcraft ... It's a little nod to the World of Warcraft fans playing Heroes." [...] 2p.com, while writing about the character of Malfurion Stormrage, also mentioned his relationship with Tyrande.|$|R
