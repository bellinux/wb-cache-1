40|$|This paper {{presents}} a current-balancing circuit for security lights that uses parallel-connected LEDs. The parallel connection of LEDs causes current {{differences between the}} LED strings because of characteristic deviations. These differences can reduce the lifespan of a particular point of LEDs by thermal spotting. They can also cause non-uniform luminance of the lighting device. Among the different methods for solving these problems, the method using current-balancing transformers {{makes it easy to}} compensate for current differences and it has a simple circuitry. However, while the <b>balancing</b> <b>transformer</b> has been applied to AC light sources, LEDs operate on a DC source, so the driving circuitry and the design method have to be changed and their performances must be verified. Thus in this paper, a design method of the <b>balancing</b> <b>transformer</b> network and the driving circuitry for LEDs is proposed. The proposed design method could have a smaller size than the conventional design method. The proposed circuitry is applied to three types of 100 -watt LED security lights, which use different LEDs. Experimental results are presented to verify the performance of the designed driving circuits. ...|$|E

30|$|It {{should be}} noted that firstly the {{reactive}} power compensation using <b>balance</b> <b>transformer</b> or Vv connected-TT as discussed before will occupy extra capacity of the TT while the active power compensation will not.

Secondly, according to the national standard, a certain amount of negative sequence power is allowed in power system [11]. Thirdly, a <b>balanced</b> <b>transformer</b> is most effective and economic in compensating the negative sequence. Based on the above considerations, two schemes of combined co-phase power supply are proposed: One is the single-phase and three-phase combined co-phase supply system comprising a single-phase TT and a high-voltage three-phase matching transformer; another is the single-phase and single-phase combined co-phase supply system comprising a single-phase TT and a high-voltage single-phase matching transformer.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — The paper {{presents}} {{time domain}} methods for har-monic {{analysis of a}} 6 -pulse thyristor bridge connected to an ac network. Balanced firing of the converter and a <b>balanced</b> interface <b>transformer</b> inductance are assumed. For the special case when the ac network is linear, a closed form solution for the harmonic injection of the converter is developed. For the more general case of a nonlinear ac network, a modular converter model is developed that relies on iterative methods. The converter model module takes as input the ac voltage harmonics {{at the point of}} common coupling and outputs the corresponding harmonic current injection into the network. The models are first validated against time domain simulation results. The results from the developed models are then compared with those obtained from approximate analytical techniques which assume zero dc ripple current. For a system with typical parameter values, it is shown that the zero ripple assumption may yield acceptable results for some operating points, but highly erroneous results for others.

When focusing on the light load efficiency of adapter design, the key losses need to be identified. Switching losses {{play a major role in}} determining the light load efficiency, and are directly linked to the control methodology. These losses are caused by the energy stored in the sum of all capacitances at the drain node (MOSFET output capacitance, stray capacitance of the transformer and other parasitic capacitances on PCB) together with the gate charge losses associated with driving the MOSFET. These are proportional to the switching frequency, hence, reducing the switching frequency reduces the losses and improves the efficiency.
