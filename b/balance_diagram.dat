The sizing of three Victorian reservoir schemes at Thirlmere for Manchester, Lake Vyrnwy for Liverpool, and Elan Valley for Birmingham, was {{strongly influenced by}} ambitious Corporations, and the Victorian engineers’ judgment of the demand forecast, respectively JF Bateman, Thomas Hawksley and James Mansergh.

40|$|Project Risk Management {{has been}} gaining {{acceptance}} amongst the practitioners due to an untiring stress on its importance, {{and the availability of}} a number of risk analysis techniques for facilitating this task in construction project management. In this arena, the selection of a suitable risk analysis technique is critical to the entire project risk management process and thus {{critical to the success of}} a construction project. However, the availability of an appropriate selection methodology, which may help the project managers choose a suitable methodology for their projects, seems missing. In this paper a selection framework methodology is presented, which looks at the realization of a practical tool that may help project managers and construction practitioners in choosing a suitable risk analysis technique that satisfies select project drivers. Also, the presented work extends the traditional time, cost and quality drivers of a project by enhancing the focus to the level of complexity and maturity of the organization.

40|$|In the {{framework}} of the global energy balance, the radiative energy exchanges between Sun, Earth and space are now accurately quantified from new satellite missions. Much less is known about the magnitude of the energy flows within the climate system and at the Earth surface, which cannot be directly measured by satellites. In addition to satellite observations, here we make extensive use of the growing number of surface observations to constrain the global energy balance not only from space, but also from the surface. We combine these observations with the latest modeling efforts performed for the 5 th IPCC assessment report to infer best estimates for the global mean surface radiative components. Our analyses favor global mean downward surface solar and thermal radiation values near 185 and 342 Wm**- 2, respectively, which are most compatible with surface observations. Combined with an estimated surface absorbed solar radiation and thermal emission of 161 Wm**- 2 and 397 Wm**- 2, respectively, this leaves 106 Wm**- 2 of surface net radiation available for distribution amongst the non-radiative surface energy balance components. The climate models overestimate the downward solar and underestimate the downward thermal radiation, thereby simulating nevertheless an adequate global mean surface net radiation by error compensation. This also suggests that, globally, the simulated surface sensible and latent heat fluxes, around 20 and 85 Wm**- 2 on average, state realistic values.

40|$|From the {{radiation}} <b>balance</b> <b>diagram</b> illustrating the IPCC reports one can estimate the power received by Earth {{from the sun}} at Pin = 342 W/m 2 and the power consumed, remitted and reflected by the earth and its atmosphere at Pout = 599 kW/m 2. It seems that the earth emits more power than it receives. The earth s ground mean temperature is estimated at 15 C. A calculation based on the black body radiation theory gives an earth s ground mean temperature {{of the order of}} - 18 C which is much lower than 15 C. The important gap between these calculated and estimated temperature mean values requires an explanation. Here we show that a gray body separated from vacuum by an interface and submitted to outside incident radiation can behave like a Pseudo Radiation Energy Amplifier. The Earth which is a gray body separated from the space by an interface, behaves like a Pseudo Radiation Energy Amplifier. The balance of the energy exchanged between Earth and outer space is reconsidered and the 15 C Earth s ground temperature mean value is then derived. Our result revives the discussion on the parameters that control the Earth climate. The solar and terrestrial radiation reflection coefficients by the earth and its atmosphere acquire a privileged role. The Pseudo Radiation Energy Amplifier can be a starting point to improve the energy use. The materials having the adequate reflection coefficients will be indicated for specific applications.

40|$|International audienceThe hydrolytic {{behavior}} of mixed metallic solutions containing Ni 2 +-Fe 3 + and Mg 2 +-Fe 3 + {{has been studied}} {{with respect to the}} relative proportion of the divalent and trivalent cations in solution as well as the quantity of NaOH added. The combination of X-ray diffraction and vibrational spectroscopy provides a deep insight into both the nature of the phases and the structure of the formed LDH. The relative abundance of each phase is determined by using a mass <b>balance</b> <b>diagram</b> and is in good agreement with the solid characterization. We showed that the slow hydrolysis of mixed metallic solutions involved first the precipitation of Fe 3 + to form an akaganeite phase, and then the formation of a precursor on the iron oxyhydroxide surface, which transforms into LDH by diffusion of Fe-III species from the akaganeite phase to the precursor. Interestingly, whatever the iron content in solution, the same fraction of Fe-III is incorporated into the LDH phase which is correlated {{to the nature of the}} formed precursor. For Ni 2 +-Fe 3 + solution, the precursor is an alpha-Ni hydroxide, which formed a LDH phase with a very low iron content (x(layer) = 0. 1), but a high charge density provided by structural hydroxyl default. This result unambiguously demonstrated that the LDH phase is formed from the precursor structure. For Mg 2 +-Fe 3 + solution, the precursor is structurally equivalent to a beta-Mg(OH) (2) phase, leading to a LDH with a higher x(layer) value of similar to 0. 2. In both cases, at the end of the titration experiments, a mixture of different phases was systematically observed.

The report summarizes, in a comprehensive manner, all the work performed during the award period extending between July 12, 2002 and June 30, 2007. This report has been prepared {{in accordance with the}} Department of Energy (DOE) Guidelines and summarizes all of the activities that occurred during the award period. The RP- 5 Renewable Energy Efficiency Project, under development by the Inland Empire Utilities Agency (IEUA), is comprised of a series of full-scale demonstration projects that will showcase innovative combinations of primary and secondary generation systems using methane gas derived from local processing of biosolids, dairy manure and other organic material. The goal of the project is to create renewable energy-based generation systems with energy efficiencies 65 % or more. The project was constructed at the 15 MGD Regional Wastewater Treatment Plant No. 5 located in the City of Chino in California where the Agency has constructed its new energy-efficient (platinum-LEED rating) headquarters building. Technologies that were featured in the project include internal combustion engines (ICE), absorption chillers, treatment plant secondary effluent cooling systems, heat recovery systems, thermal energy storage (TES), Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) secondary power generation system, the integration of a future fuel cell system, gas cleaning requirements, and other state-of-the-art design combinations. The RP- 5 REEP biogas source is coming from three manure digesters which are located within the RP- 5 Complex and are joined with the RP- 5 REEP through gas conveyance pipelines. Food waste is being injected into the manure digesters for digester gas production enhancement. The RP- 5 REEP clearly demonstrates the biogas production and power generation viability, specifically when dealing with renewable and variable heating value (Btu) fuel. The RP- 5 REEP was challenged with meeting stringent utility, gas, power, and air quality rules and regulations. Coordination with the Southern California Gas Company (SCGC), Southern California Edison (SCE), and South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) was continuous and extensive. The interconnecting agreement and the permit to construct and operate were major obstacles despite the early start and coordination with the utility companies and regulatory agencies. The RP- 5 REEP is part of a unique RP- 5 Complex approach where several facilities are tied and connected with each other; where energy and gas can be transferred from one facility to another (see attached RP- 5 Complex Ultimate Energy <b>Balance</b> <b>Diagram).</b> The REEP also incorporated new technologies, such as TES and ORC, along with using heat recovery for the platinum-LEED headquarter buildings heating and cooling via efficient absorption chillers.

40|$|The genesis and {{evolution}} of Earth’s climate is largely regulated by the global energy balance. Despite the central importance of the global energy balance for the climate system and climate change, substantial uncertainties still exist in the quantification of its different components, and its representation in climate models. While the net radiative energy flow {{in and out of}} the climate system at the top of atmosphere is known with considerable accuracy from new satellite programs such as CERES, much less is known about the energy distribution within the climate system and at the Earth surface. Accordingly, the quantification of the global energy balance has been controversially disputed in the past. Here we review this discussion and make an attempt to put additional constraints on the components with largest uncertainties. In addition to satellite observations, we thereby make extensive use of the growing number of surface observations to constrain the global energy balance not only from space, but also from the surface. We combine these observations with the latest modeling efforts performed for the 5 th IPCC assessment report (CMIP 5) to infer best estimates for the global mean surface radiative components. Our analyses favor global mean downward surface solar and thermal radiation values near 185 and 342 Wm- 2, respectively, which are most compatible with surface observations. These estimates are lower and higher, respectively, than in many previous assessments, including those presented in previous IPCC reports. It is encouraging that our estimates, which make full use of the information contained in the surface networks, coincide within 2 Wm- 2 with the latest satellite-derived estimates (Stephens et al. 2012, Kato et al. submitted to J. Climate), which are completely independently determined. Combining our above estimates with an estimated global mean surface absorbed solar radiation and thermal emission of 161 Wm- 2 and 397 Wm- 2, respectively, results in 106 Wm- 2 of surface net radiation globally available for distribution amongst the non-radiative surface energy balance components. The 23 CMIP 5 models investigated in this study overestimate the downward solar and underestimate the downward thermal radiation, both by 5 - 10 Wm- 2 on average. Thus, the CMIP 5 models nevertheless simulate an adequate global mean surface net radiation, by error compensation in their downward solar and thermal components. This also suggests that, globally, the simulated surface sensible and latent heat fluxes, around 20 and 85 Wm- 2 on average, state realistic values.

Strey and Kahlweit, and subsequently Sottmann and Strey, with coworkers have studied and published phase diagrams for systems with a fixed ratio of oil to water, varying the surfactant, the so-called Kahlweit fish-cut diagrams. Some properties of the phase diagrams can be scaled to become general and not system dependent.

A glimpse of this may be seen in our Theorem 4. 3, which shows that balanced labellings (of permutation diagrams) yield symmetric functions, in the same way that Schur functions can be construct [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The Asian {{financial}} crisis has adversely affected {{many of the}} domestic construction organizations in Malaysia, bringing some organizations {{to the brink of}} insolvency. It demonstrates that a construction organization's performance is sensitive to the prevailing economic conditions. This paper seeks to model the dynamic performance of a publicly listed construction organization in Malaysia. First, a diagrammatic model consisting of two interconnected causal loop diagrams is developed to represent the organization's capacity and its financial <b>balance</b> sheet. The <b>diagrams</b> provide a clearer understanding of the interactions between the country's construction market and the organization's financial, technical and managerial capabilities. Next, the causal loop diagrams are converted into a mathematical model using specialized software. Simulation results from the model are validated against historical time series data. Graphical plots of the simulation model and results from sensitivity analysis indicate that the model is capable of replicating the general behaviour of the organization.

40|$|The quality {{problems}} of groundwater sources {{had become more}} important than the quality of groundwater sources. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the chemical quality of groundwater sources for domestic purpose in Semnan city of Iran by using Aq. Qa software and compared with national standard. We examined the physicochemical quality fluctuations of 15 wells in Semnan during three seasons in the year of 2014. 13 physicochemical parameters of drinking water were calcium, chloride, conductivity (EC), magnesium, permanent hardness, pH, residual chlorine, sulfate, temperature, total alkalinity, total dissolved solid (TDS), total hardness (TH), and turbidity. We compared the results with national standard values of drinking water and drew the chemical diagrams of water with the Aq. QA software. We applied the stiff <b>diagram,</b> ion <b>balance,</b> piper <b>diagram,</b> and schoeller diagram, for determining the water type, anionic-cationic balance, chemical characteristics of water and mean concentration of water parameters, respectively. Water type was calcium sulfate, in 11 % of samples. The TDS range of 45 samples was 185 - 1100 mg/l (fresh and slightly saline level). The pH range of well water samples was the basic in summer. The Temperature range of 45 samples was 12 - 23 °C. The EC range of well water samples in spring was higher than the well water samples in summer and fall. The TH range of 45 samples was 720 - 1600 mg/l (CaCO 3) (hard and very hard level). The TH range of well water samples in spring was higher than the well water samples in summer and fall...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} Master Thesis is {{to study}} the {{development}} of the energy system in Aragón and analyze some options for its future development. A systems approach is applied. The report is divided in two parts. The first part studies in the historical evolution of the ener-gy system, analyzing the electrical system in detail. The second part focuses in energy model-ing. The first step is a literature review to find historical data about the energy system, and more in detail about the electrical system. The second part includes three different models: logistic curves of the electrical system, energy <b>balance</b> flow <b>diagram</b> and Long range Energy Alterna-tives Planning system (LEAP). Four scenarios are built using LEAP: the business as usual (BAU), coal priority (COAL), renewable electricity (REN) and electric cars (ELECAR). During {{the development of the}} project an important quantity of data about the energy system in Aragón has been found. However, when detailed data is needed, it is difficult to find. Ener-gy planning at national level, public and private, does not have a good quality. LEAP is an easy program to use and with little requirements, although there were some prob-lems when using it. The main conclusion from the scenarios is that both REN and ELECAR decrease carbon emissions. On the other hand, the costs of those scenarios are the highest. COAL is the cheapest scenario, but with more emissions. One of the important conclusions of the study {{is that there is a}} surplus of installed capacity in Aragón. Coal thermal power plants have a low generation, and at the same time combined cycles are installed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—System {{development}} {{life cycle}} (SDLC) {{is a process}} uses during the development of any system. SDLC consists of four main phases: analysis, design, implement and testing. During analysis phase, context diagram and data flow diagrams are used to produce the process model of a system. A consistency of the context diagram to lower-level data flow diagrams {{is very important in}} smoothing up developing process of a system. However, manual consistency check from context diagram to lower-level data flow diagrams by using a checklist is time-consuming process. At the same time, the limitation of human ability to validate the errors is one of the factors that influence the correctness and <b>balancing</b> of the <b>diagrams.</b> This paper presents a tool that automates the consistency check between Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs) based on the rules of DFDs. The tool serves two purposes: as an editor to draw the diagrams and as a checker to check the correctness of the diagrams drawn. The consistency check from context diagram to lower-level data flow diagrams is embedded inside the tool to overcome the manual checking problem...|$|R
