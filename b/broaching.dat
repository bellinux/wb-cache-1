5|$|Horizontal <b>broaching</b> {{machines}} {{are designed for}} pull <b>broaching,</b> surface <b>broaching,</b> continuous <b>broaching,</b> and rotary <b>broaching.</b> Pull style {{machines are}} basically vertical machines laid on the side with a longer stroke. Surface style machines hold the broach stationary while the workpieces are clamped into fixtures that are mounted on a conveyor system. Continuous style machines {{are similar to the}} surface style machines except adapted for internal <b>broaching.</b>|$|E
5|$|Vertical <b>broaching</b> {{machines}} can {{be designed}} for push <b>broaching,</b> pull-down <b>broaching,</b> pull-up <b>broaching,</b> or surface <b>broaching.</b> Push <b>broaching</b> machines are similar to an arbor press with a guided ram; typical capacities are 5 to 50 tons. The two ram pull-down machine {{is the most common}} type of <b>broaching</b> machine. This style machine has the rams under the table. Pull-up machines have the ram above the table; they usually have more than one ram. Most surface <b>broaching</b> is done on a vertical machine.|$|E
5|$|<b>Broaching</b> is a {{machining}} process {{that uses a}} toothed tool, called a broach, to remove material. There are two main types of broaching: linear and rotary. In linear <b>broaching,</b> which is the more common process, the broach is run linearly against a surface of the workpiece to effect the cut. Linear broaches are used in a <b>broaching</b> machine, which is also sometimes shortened to broach. In rotary <b>broaching,</b> the broach is rotated and pressed into the workpiece to cut an axisymmetric shape. A rotary broach is used in a lathe or screw machine. In both processes the cut is performed in one pass of the broach, which makes it very efficient.|$|E
5|$|Solid <b>broaches</b> are {{the most}} common type; they are made from one solid piece of material. For <b>broaches</b> that wear out quickly shell <b>broaches</b> are used; these <b>broaches</b> are similar to a solid <b>broach,</b> except there is a hole through the center where it mounts on an arbor. Shell <b>broaches</b> cost more initially, but save the cost overall if the <b>broach</b> must be {{replaced}} often because the pilots are on the mandrel and {{do not have to be}} reproduced with each replacement.|$|R
5|$|A {{common type}} of {{internal}} <b>broach</b> is the keyway <b>broach</b> (C & D). It uses a special fixture called a horn to support the <b>broach</b> and properly locate the part with relation to the <b>broach.</b>|$|R
50|$|Using {{lubricant}} or coolant {{with any}} type of <b>broach</b> cutter is a must. A correct lubrication and coolant delivery more life for <b>broach</b> cutters. The very important thing {{to know is that}} TCT <b>broach</b> cutters require Coolant, not lubricant and HSS <b>broach</b> cutters requiredÂ Cutting oil, not coolant.|$|R
5|$|The {{concept of}} <b>broaching</b> {{can be traced}} back to the early 1850s, with the first {{applications}} used for cutting keyways in pulleys and gears. After World War I, <b>broaching</b> was used to rifle gun barrels. In the 1920s and 30s the tolerances were tightened and the cost reduced thanks to advances in form grinding and <b>broaching</b> machines.|$|E
5|$|A {{somewhat}} different design of cutting tool that can achieve the irregular hole or outer {{profile of a}} broach is called a rotary broach or wobble broach. One of the biggest advantages {{to this type of}} <b>broaching</b> {{is that it does not}} require a <b>broaching</b> machine, but instead is used on lathes, milling machines, screw machines or Swiss lathes.|$|E
5|$|<b>Broaching</b> {{is often}} {{impossible}} without the specific <b>broaching</b> or keyway machines {{unless you have}} a system {{that can be used in}} conjunction with a modern machining centre or driven tooling lathe; these extra bits of equipment open up the possibility of producing keyways, splines and torx through one-hit machining.|$|E
50|$|HSS <b>broach</b> cutters {{are cheaper}} than the TCT <b>broach</b> cutters for smaller diameters up to 40 mm, while TCT <b>broach</b> cutters are cheaper than HSS for diameters above 41 mm.|$|R
50|$|The {{chances of}} defect in TCT <b>broach</b> cutters is more because the {{tungsten}} carbide tips are glued on the <b>broach</b> cutters {{and when the}} <b>broach</b> cutters falls down or crashes on the material, the chances tip breakage is more. A HSS <b>broach</b> cutters {{on the other hand}} a complete made of one material.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The paper {{describes}} {{control of}} the cutting edges of a <b>broach.</b> Direct and indirect methods of identifying the edge condition have been presented. A vision system of monitoring the wear of the <b>broach</b> cutting edges has been presented. The importance of the <b>broach</b> cutting edge monitoring has been discussed. Key words: <b>broach,</b> wear, edge condition identification 1...|$|R
5|$|<b>Broaching</b> is {{used when}} {{precision}} machining is required, especially for odd shapes. Commonly machined surfaces include circular and non-circular holes, splines, keyways, and flat surfaces. Typical workpieces include small to medium-sized castings, forgings, screw machine parts, and stampings. Even though broaches can be expensive, <b>broaching</b> is usually favored over other processes when used for high-quantity production runs.|$|E
5|$|<b>Broaching</b> {{works best}} on softer materials, such as brass, bronze, copper alloys, aluminium, graphite, hard rubbers, wood, composites, and plastic. However, {{it still has}} a good {{machinability}} rating on mild steels and free machining steels. When <b>broaching,</b> the machinability rating {{is closely related to}} the hardness of the material. For steels the ideal hardness range is between 16 and 24 Rockwell C (HRC); a hardness greater than HRC 35 will dull the broach quickly. <b>Broaching</b> is more difficult on harder materials, stainless steel and titanium, but is still possible.|$|E
5|$|Internal <b>broaching</b> is more involved. The {{process begins}} by {{clamping}} the workpiece into a special holding fixture, called a workholder, which mounts in the <b>broaching</b> machine. The <b>broaching</b> machine elevator, {{which is the}} part of the machine that moves the broach above the workholder, then lowers the broach through the workpiece. Once through, the <b>broaching</b> machine's puller, essentially a hook, grabs the pilot of the broach. The elevator then releases the top of the pilot and the puller pulls the broach through the workpiece completely. The workpiece is then removed from the machine and the broach is raised back up to reengage with the elevator. The broach usually only moves linearly, but sometimes it is also rotated to create a spiral spline or gun-barrel rifling.|$|E
50|$|The {{hardness}} of TCT <b>broach</b> cutters is {{more than}} the HSS <b>broach</b> cutters.|$|R

5|$|The slab <b>broach</b> is the {{simplest}} surface <b>broach.</b> It {{is a general}} purpose tool for cutting flat surfaces.|$|R
5|$|Slot broaches (G & H) are {{for cutting}} slots of various {{dimensions}} at high production rates. Slot <b>broaching</b> is much quicker than milling {{when more than}} one slot needs to be machined, because multiple broaches can be run through the part {{at the same time}} on the same <b>broaching</b> machine.|$|E
5|$|The process {{depends on}} the type of <b>broaching</b> being performed. Surface <b>broaching</b> is very simple as either the {{workpiece}} is moved against a stationary surface broach, or the workpiece is held stationary while the broach is moved against it.|$|E
5|$|<b>Broaching</b> was {{originally}} developed for machining internal keyways. However, {{it was soon}} discovered that <b>broaching</b> is very useful for machining other surfaces and shapes for high volume workpieces. Because each broach is specialized to cut just one shape, either the broach must be specially designed for the geometry of the workpiece or the workpiece must be designed around a standard broach geometry. A customized broach is usually only viable with high volume workpieces, because the broach can cost US$15,000 to US$30,000 to produce.|$|E
5|$|If the <b>broach</b> {{is large}} enough the costs can be reduced by using a {{built-up}} or modular construction. This involves producing the <b>broach</b> in pieces and assembling it. If any portion wears out only that section has to be replaced, instead of the entire <b>broach.</b>|$|R
50|$|TCT <b>broach</b> cutters biggest {{advantage}} is speed and ease {{in which it}} may cut harder materials. Especially for larger diameter TCT <b>broach</b> cutters are very successful. While HSS <b>broach</b> cutters are good when drilling not very hard material and for small diameter hole sizes.|$|R
5|$|For {{defining}} {{the geometry of}} a <b>broach</b> an internal type is shown below. Note that the geometries of other <b>broaches</b> are similar.|$|R
5|$|For {{internal}} <b>broaching</b> {{the sides}} of the broach are drafted inward so it becomes thinner; for external <b>broaching</b> the sides are drafted outward, to make the pocket bigger. This draft keeps the broach from jamming; the draft must be larger than the angle of misalignment. If the work piece rotates, the broach is pressed against it, is driven by it, and rotates synchronously with it. If the tool holder rotates, the broach is pressed against the workpiece, but is driven by the tool holder.|$|E
5|$|<b>Broaching</b> speeds {{vary from}} 20 to 120surface feet per minute (SFPM). This {{results in a}} {{complete}} cycle time of 5 to 30seconds. Most of the time is consumed by the return stroke, broach handling, and workpiece loading and unloading.|$|E
5|$|Horizontal {{machines}} {{used to be}} {{much more}} common than vertical machines; however, today they represent just 10% of all <b>broaching</b> machines purchased. Vertical machines are more popular because they take up less space.|$|E
5|$|A {{concentricity}} <b>broach</b> is {{a special}} type of spline cutting <b>broach</b> which cuts both the minor diameter and the spline form to ensure precise concentricity.|$|R
40|$|A {{very big}} {{importance}} in a pull <b>broach</b> designing {{is represented by}} its mechanic computation, which trots out the pull <b>broach</b> resistance on various blank tooling, pull <b>broach</b> productivity and also the loadings which is subdued to and the stresses that appear during the chipping process. The pull <b>broach</b> geometric complexity leads to one difficulty concerning the resistance computing methods application (and implicitly, simplifying assumptions application). This present study presents a resistance computing of pull <b>broach</b> cogs, which dresses a circular hole trotting out more methods {{which can be used}} in this computing, and the teoretic aspects are then trotted out by an example of a numerical computation for a particular case...|$|R

5|$|Modular broaches are {{commonly}} used for large internal <b>broaching</b> applications. They are similar to shell broaches {{in that they are}} a multi-piece construction. This design is used because it is cheaper to build and resharpen and is more flexible than a solid design.|$|E
5|$|Most broaches {{are made}} from high speed steel (HSS) or an alloy steel; TiN {{coatings}} are common on HSS to prolong life. Except when <b>broaching</b> cast iron, tungsten carbide is rarely used as a tooth material because the cutting edge will crack on the first pass.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{different}} options for achieving the same goal when <b>broaching</b> a flat surface. The first {{is similar to the}} rotor-cut design, which is known as a double-cut design. Here four teeth in a row have the same RPT, but each progressive tooth takes only a portion of the cut due to notches in the teeth (see the image gallery below). The other option is known as a progressive broach, which completely machines the center of the workpiece and then the rest of the broach machines outward from there. All of these designs require a broach that is longer than if a standard design were used.|$|E

5|$|In general, a rotary <b>broach</b> {{will not}} cut as {{accurately}} as a push or pull <b>broach.</b> However, {{the ability to}} use this type of cutting tool on common machine tools is highly advantageous.|$|R
