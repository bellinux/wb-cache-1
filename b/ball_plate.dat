The <b>ball</b> <b>plate</b> standard is 532 mm by 532 mm in nominal dimension and 25 spheres are embedded. Thirteen National Metrology Institutes (8 from APMP, 5 from other Regional Metrology Organizations) participated in the <b>ball</b> <b>plate</b> measurement comparison. The hole plate standard is 550 mm by 550 mm in nominal dimension and there are 44 cylindrical holes in it. Nine National Metrology Institutes (5 from APMP, 4 from other Regional Metrology Organizations) participated in the hole plate measurement comparison. The comparison started in May 2006 and finished in October 2008. The participants used different measurement techniques which were used for their routine calibration services. For determining the key comparison reference values, a two-dimensional coordinates-based analysis was performed. The measurement results on the <b>ball</b> <b>plate</b> show good agreement in ten out of thirteen participants. In contrast, those on the hole plate are in agreement for five out of nine participants...|$|E
40|$|The {{proposed}} self-calibration method uses an artefact, a <b>ball</b> <b>plate,</b> {{for error}} identification. Unlike other methods this <b>ball</b> <b>plate</b> {{need not be}} calibrated, i. e. the distances between the different balls on the plate need not be known accurately. After measurement of the <b>ball</b> <b>plate</b> in different positions within the measuring volume, the systematic geometrical errors, like scale errors, axes' pitch, yaw and non-orthogonality, of the geometric error model of the measuring machine can be calculated. This geometrical error model is used afterwards by the software error correction to correct on-line every single measurement carried by the measuring machine. This results in a higher accuracy of the measurement. As an example, the self-calibration method {{has been carried out}} on a CNC 3 -D coordinate measuring machine and the resulting software error correction has been evaluated using step-gauge measurements. The results of the evaluation show that the systematic geometrical errors are greatly reduced. status: publishe...|$|E

This paper deals with principal correlations between the thermal expansion of different C/C-SiC materials as well as their microstructural characterisation.

40|$|Up to now methods using {{artifacts}} {{to inspect}} large coordinate measuring machines (CMMs) are suitable only for interim checks and verification [1, 2]. For a full-scale error analysis of larger CMMs (at least one axis> 2 m) no readily applicable methodology exists so far, thus VDI and ISO have recently started activities yielding traceability of large CMMs. Regarding this background methods for a full-scale error analysis of large CMMs (calibration, error correction & performance tests) were developed under the EC funded SM&T Programme (project SMT 4 -PL 97 - 2330). Methods {{are based on}} calibrated artifacts, which are described here: Light weight ball plates, disassemblable ball plates and disassemblable multi-ball bars. CMM manufacturers and users are testing methods and artifacts. Error models were extended to include non-rigid-body errors, typical of large CMMs (methods for error assessment and algorithms for numerical correction). New artifacts, their justification, their design criteria Three types of artifacts are studied to optimize their costs, calibration procedures, sta-bility, and the error assessment processes. In all cases carbon fiber reinforced plastics (CFRP) is used to reduce weight, reach optimum stiffness and to avoid thermal effects. The new artifacts (Fig. 3, Fig. 4) surfaces are sealed to avoid humidity influences. 1. A <b>ball</b> <b>plate</b> with carbon fiber rod structure (Fig. 1) giving compatibility with existing measurement and evaluation strategies, but being limited to 1. 5 m x 2 m size. Fig. 2 shows the required 6 measurement setups on a horizontal arm CMM. 2. A disassemblable <b>ball</b> <b>plate</b> with L-shape of carbon fiber tubes (Fig. 3 and 4). The main advantage is the 2 D-feature, resulting in a minimum of only six measure-ment setups for a full rigid-body error analysis, including some non-rigid-body errors. 3. A disassemblable multi-ball-beam of carbon fiber pipes (Fig. 4 and 3) made of the same structural elements as the L-shaped plate.

40|$|X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) {{has become}} an {{important}} technology for quality control of industrial components. As with other technologies, e. g., tactile coordinate measurements or optical measurements, CT is influenced by numerous quantities which may have {{negative impact on the}} accuracy and repeatability of dimensional and geometrical measurements. The aim {{of this paper is to}} discuss different methods for the correction of scaling errors and to quantify their influence on dimensional measurements. Scaling errors occur first and foremost in CT systems with no built-in compensation of positioning errors of the manipulator system (magnification axis). This article also introduces a new compensation method for scaling errors using a database of reference scaling factors and discusses its advantages and disadvantages. In total, three methods for the correction of scaling errors - using the CT <b>ball</b> <b>plate,</b> using calibrated features measured by CMM and using a database of reference values - are presented and applied within a case study. The investigation was performed on a dose engine component of an insulin pen, for which several dimensional measurands were defined. The component has a complex geometry and is made of brass, which makes its measurements with CT challenging. It is shown that each scaling error correction method results in different deviations between CT measurements and reference measurements from a CMM. Measurement uncertainties were estimated for each method, taking into consideration the contributions related to the applied correction method. The newly suggested approach using the database appeared to work well, indicating, that if the properties of a CT system under investigation are monitored using a reference object (ball bar in our case), a correction factor based on individual selected magnification factors can be applied for scaling error correction of any object, and thus no additional scanning of a reference object is needed...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to examine whether it is {{possible}} to recover directly the size of an object from the sound of an impact. Specifically, the study is designed to investigate whether listeners can tell the size of a ball from the sound when it is dropped on plates of different diameters (on one, two, or three plates in Experiments 1, 2, and 3, respectively). In this paradigm, most of the sound produced is from the plate rather than the ball. Listeners were told neither how many different <b>balls</b> or <b>plates</b> were used nor the materials of the <b>balls</b> and <b>plates.</b> Although listeners provided reasonable ball size estimates, their judgments were influenced by the size of the plate: Balls were judged to be larger when dropped on larger plates. Moreover, listeners were generally unable to recognize either <b>ball</b> and <b>plate</b> materials or the number of plates used in Experiments 2 and 3. Finally, various acoustic properties of the sounds are shown to be correlated with listeners’ judgments...|$|R

40|$|A {{simulation}} {{was created}} using LS-DYNA® {{to determine the}} acoustical properties of a golf ball and golf driver head impact. LS-DYNA® has a coupled finite element analysis (FEA) and boundary element method (BEM) solver that uses the integral form of Helmholtz’s acoustic wave equation to deliver predicted sound pressure levels at predetermined acoustic points. Validation of the modeling was done on a simple plate donated by Titleist Golf. The plate was modeled and meshed using TrueGrid and impacted by a three layer golf ball model derived from “Tanka’s” paper on multilayered golf balls. The final converging model consisted of 10, 900 solid fully integrated elements between the <b>ball,</b> <b>plate,</b> and plate support structure. The result was compared to experimental data taken by an air cannon and anechoic chamber that housed strain and acoustical measurement equipment. The sound level predictions from the model showed a promising correlation with experimental data and the focus switched to a golf driver head response during impact. The same ball developed from Tanaka’s paper was used to impact a 350 cc generic golf driver head. The driver head consisted of 3300 fully integrated shell elements throughout the model. The top of the hosel was fixed during the simulation to simulate the connection to the golf shaft. The ball was fired {{at the center of}} the driver’s face and the predicted sound was determined for a point two feet behind the driver head. The BEM prediction of the driver head model showed little correlation with actual recorded impact sounds provided by Cleveland Golf when comparing frequency response functions. These differences could arise from assumptions and simplifications made to speed up the impact simulation. The sound produced from the golf ball after impact was one such factor was not included. Due to the complex shape of the driver head and the total number of elements involved, the numerical solution took upwards of 100 hours to finish. Adding the golf ball sound would greatly increase computational time and not contribute significantly to the overall predicted sound. Although the BEM solution can be used to characterize different driver heads, the impact is too complicated to efficiently and accurately predict the true impact sounds...|$|E

If the force on it is small, when the force is released both the <b>ball</b> and <b>plate's</b> surface will return to their original, undeformed shape. In this case, the stresses in the plate are always less than the yield strength of the material, so the deformation is purely elastic. Since it was given that the flat plate is softer than the <b>ball,</b> the <b>plate's</b> surface will always deform more. (Note 1: this is not necessarily true.

The non-linear mathematical model of <b>Ball</b> & <b>Plate</b> structure is presented and adequately linearized. Polynomial approach to controller design for {{two degrees of freedom}} (2 DOF) controller structure is introduced as the main tool for determination of unknown parameters. This method requires placing poles of characteristic polynomial, which are semi-optimally determined using minimization of linear quadratic criterion. This criterion is minimized by spectral factorization with the aid of the Polynomial Toolbox for MATLAB. Experiments have proved that this type of controller is able to stabilize the ball in desired position on the plate, reject external disturbances and follow reference path without much effort. In addition, a simple maze was created on the plate to extend possibilities of the choice of reference signal. The algorithm is able to determine correct path through the maze and navigate the ball along this path. © 2017 IEEE.

Both properties enable the protective layers to sustain wide ranges of loading and environmental conditions {{or even to}} substitute lubricants. At present, low friction coatings are commonly used on an empirical basis but not as a design element. The reason for the empirical approach is the missing of tools to describe {{the interaction between the}} coatings and the substrate and the difficulty to obtain information on the mechanical properties (e. g. strength, toughness, adhesion, residual stresses) of the coatings. A cyclic indentation test is proposed by (1) and (2) to substitute expensive coating tests in cyclic loaded machine elements, e. g. ball bearings.
