40|$|Soil {{microorganisms}} {{are largely}} responsible for <b>biogeochemical</b> <b>fluxes</b> in the terrestrial biosphere that effect ecosystem productivity and alter global climate patterns. Though the importance of soil microorganisms is easy to state, {{little is known about}} interactions between microbes necessary for the production of ecosystem-scale fluxes. Furthermore, measurement of <b>biogeochemical</b> <b>fluxes</b> at the scale of microorganisms or ecosystems is far from straightforward; the lack of understanding regarding linkages between these two scales (microbial habitat and ecosystem) remains as an important knowledge gap in ecology. For my dissertation I focused on studying microbial communities among soil aggregates, aggregate-scale fluxes of soil carbon, and the scaling of greenhouse gas fluxes from single measurements to ecosystem-level experiments in order to understand how agriculture alters microbially driven <b>biogeochemical</b> <b>fluxes.</b> In the following chapters I did not attempt to find a direct link between particular microorganisms and a specific flux; rather I aimed to fill this knowledge gap regarding linkages between microbes and ecosystems in order to inform models predicting microbial and ecosystem-scale function. My dissertation is broken into four chapters: exploring potential microbial interactions across ecosystems, observing differences in microbial communities within aggregates from bioenergy cropping systems, and the scaling of carbon fluxes and greenhouse gas emissions from small scales (i. e., aggregates or square meter) to ecosystem scales. The main conclusions drawn from these chapters are that our understanding of soil microbes and terrestrial fluxes of carbon must begin at the aggregate-scale rather than whole soil, and understanding uncertainty about fluxes, whether it be soil carbon or greenhouse gases, is necessary for agroecosystem ecology. By taking care to sample microorganisms at the scale of soil aggregates and addressing the uncertainty around <b>biogeochemical</b> <b>fluxes</b> measured at larger, ecosystem scales, we may begin to finally design testable models that explain both microbial and ecosystem functioning {{in order to understand the}} effects of land-use and climate change on the terrestrial biosphere...|$|R

40|$|So far, {{the role}} of appendicularians in the {{biogeochemical}} cycling of organic matter has been largely overlooked. Appendicularians represent {{only a fraction of}} total mesozooplankton biomass, however these ubiquitous zooplankters have very high filtration and growth rates compared to copepods, and produce numerous fecal pellets and filtering houses contributing to export production by aggregating small marine particles. To study their quantitative impact on <b>biogeochemical</b> <b>flux,</b> we have included this group in the <b>biogeochemical</b> <b>flux</b> model, using a recently developed ecophysiological model. One-dimensional annual simulations of the pelagic ecosystem including appendicularians were conducted with realistic surface forcing for the year 2000, using data from the DyFAMed open ocean station. The appendicularian grazing impact was generally low, but appendicularians increased detritus production by 8 % and export production by 55 % compared to a simulation without appendicularians. Therefore, current biogeochemical models lacking appendicularians probably under, or misestimate the detritus and export production by omitting the pathway from small-sized plankton to fast sinking detritus. Detritus production and export rates are 60 % lower than the estimates from mesotrophic sites, showing that appendicularians’ role is lower but still significant in oligotrophic environments. The simulated annual export at 200 m exceeds sediment trap values by 44 %, suggesting an intense degradation during the sinking of appendicularian detritus, supported by observations made at other sites. Thus, degradation and grazing of appendicularian detritus need better quantification if we are to accurately assess {{the role of}} appendicularia in export flux...|$|E
40|$|The {{seasonal}} {{dynamics of}} pelagic and sea ice communities {{are closely related}} in ice-covered waters, however, modelling works that analyse such interactions are scarce. We use the <b>Biogeochemical</b> <b>Flux</b> Model in Sea Ice (BFM-SI) coupled to the pelagic <b>Biogeochemical</b> <b>Flux</b> Model (BFM) in a study area in Greenland to quantitatively investigate: (1) the significance of photoacclimation/photoadaptation strategies of autotrophs, (2) {{the fate of the}} sea ice biomass in case of algae seeding, algae aggregation and at different mixed layer depths and (3) the changes in community production under a climate change scenario. The results show that sea ice algae need to be both photoacclimated and photoadapted to the sea ice environment in order to grow, while phytoplankton may adopt different strategies for optimising their growth. The seeding of the phytoplankton bloom shows to be driven, both in timing and magnitude, by the viability of sea ice algae and by the degree of aggregation of algae released from the ice, which also affects the sinking rate to the sea floor. Under a mild climate change scenario (SRES B 2, 2071 – 2090) the sea ice community is projected to be generally more productive, whereas phytoplankton growth will be reduced because the melt of sea ice will occur earlier in the season when light is less favourable to sustain the growth. While it is generally anticipated that the melting of multi-year ice in the Arctic Ocean will cause an increase in marine production, this study shows that seasonal ice-covered seas in the Northern hemisphere may actually be less productive and may shift to more oligotrophic conditions within the next 100 years...|$|E

40|$|The IGBP Wetlands {{workshop}} (Santa Barbara, CA, USA, 16 - 20 May 1996) {{was held}} {{for the purpose of}} identifying data and research needs for characterizing wetlands in terms of their role in biogeochemical and hydrologic cycles. Wetlands cover only about 1 % of the Earth's surface, yet are responsible for a much greater proportion of <b>biogeochemical</b> <b>fluxes</b> between the land surface, the atmosphere and hydrologic systems. They play a particularly important function in processing methane, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and sulphur as well as in sequestering carbon. Considerable {{progress has been made in}} the past 10 years regarding wetlands and methane: a global digital dataset of wetlands (Matthews and Fung 1987) was produced and global observations of methane have been combined with global three-dimensional atmospheric modelling (Fung et al. 1991) to constrain modelled fluxes of methane from high-latitude wetlands. Furthermore, significant advances have been made in understanding the biogeochemical processes that control fluxes of methane and other trace gases. The progress has made clear that present wetland classification schemes do not accurately reflect their roles in these processes because they have been based on wetland attributes such as dominant plant types which do not reflect differences in the functions of wetlands regarding biogeochemical cycles. Further, traditional wetland classifications cannot be distinguished on the basis of global remotely sensed observations. Consequently, it has been impossible to accurately quantify the distribution of key fluxes on the basis of observed land cover. The workshop developed a wetland parameterization scheme based on observable quantities to better incorporate wetlands into global land surface characterization schemes so that the relation between land cover and <b>biogeochemical</b> <b>fluxes</b> can be more accurately determined. An improved understanding of this relation will make it possible to better use observed or historical changes in land cover to infer changes in <b>biogeochemical</b> <b>fluxes,</b> including the cycles of gases such as methane and carbon dioxide which affect the radiative balance of the atmosphere...|$|R
40|$|The Mediterranean Sea is {{generally}} regarded as the best site to understand the interactions between the climate, the biogeochemical cycles {{as well as the}} marine ecosystems (Béthoux et al., 1999), because of its short turnover time of water and zones of deep water formation.

The biogeochemical module contains 9 states variables (2 groups of phytoplankton, silicate, biogenic silica, phosphorus, alkalinity, dissolved inorganic carbon, dissolved and particulate organic matter).

The differential equations of BFMSI are written here according to the nomenclature associated to the new sea ice state variables. At the boundaries, the sea ice system is also coupled to the atmosphere and to the ocean through the exchange of organic and inorganic matter. This is done by computing the entrapment of particulate and dissolved matter and gases when sea ice grows and release to the ocean when sea ice melts to ensure mass conservation.

40|$|Abstract. An {{advanced}} multivariate sequential data {{assimilation system}} has been implemented {{within the framework of}} the European MFSTEP project to fit a three-dimensional biogeochemical model of the Eastern Mediterranean to satellite chlorophyll data from the Sea-viewing Wide Field-ofview Sensor (SeaWiFS). The physics are described by the Princeton Ocean Model (POM) while the biochemistry of the ecosystem is tackled with the <b>Biogeochemical</b> <b>Flux</b> Model (BFM). The assimilation scheme is based on the Singular Evolutive Extended Kalman (SEEK) filter, in which the error statistics were parameterized by means of a suitable set of Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOFs). To avoid spurious long-range correlations associated with the limited number of EOFs, the filter covariance matrix was given compact support through a radius of influence around every data point location. Hindcast experiments were performed for one year over 1999 and forced with ECMWF 6 h atmospheric fields. The solution of the assimilation system was evaluated against the assimilated data and the MedAtlas climatology, and by assessing the impact of the assimilation on non-observed biogeochemical processes. It is found that the assimilation of SeaWiFS data improves the overall behavior of the BFM model and efficiently removes long term biases from the model despite some difficulties during the spring bloom period. Results, however, suggest the need of subsurface data to enhance the estimation of the ecosystem variables in the deep layers. ...|$|E

Seasonal (winter/spring) dust mass fluxes to the San Juan Mountains during the period from 2004 to 2008 ranged from 5 to 10 g m− 2, with individual deposition events reaching as high as 2 g m− 2. Dust deposited in the San Juan Mountains was primarily composed of silt- and clay-sized particles, indicating a regional source area. The concentrations of most major and minor elements in this dust were similar to or less than average upper continental crustal concentrations, whereas trace element concentrations were often enriched. In particular, dust collected from the San Juan Mountain snowpack was characterized by enrichments of heavy metals including As, Cu, Cd, Mo, Pb, and Zn. The mineral composition of dust partially explained dust geochemistry; however, based on results of a sequential leaching procedure it appeared that trace element enrichments were associated with the organic-, and not the mineral-, fraction of dust. Our observations show that the dust-derived fluxes of several nutrients and trace metals are substantial and, because many elements are deposited in a mobile form, could be important controls of vegetation, soil, or surface water chemistry. The flux measurements reported here are useful benchmarks for the characterization of ecosystem biogeochemical cycling in the Rocky Mountains...|$|E

Currently, bacteria of the Roseobacter clade, a subgroup of a-proteobacteria, are hypothesized to be the key participants in the metabolism of DMSP. To test this hypothesis, we used a combination of microautoradiography and fluorescence in situ hybridization (Micro-FISH) to identify the bacteria assimilating 35 S DMSP in the Gulf of Mexico, the Gulf of Maine, and the Sargasso Sea. On average, half of the bacterial community assimilated DMSP in these environ-ments. Members of the a-proteobacteria dominated DMSP assimilation, accounting for 35 – 40 % of bacteria assim-ilating DMSP. Cytophaga-like bacteria and g-proteobacteria each accounted for 15 – 30 % of DMSP-assimilating cells. The a-proteobacteria accounted for a greater fraction of the DMSP-assimilating community than expected based on their overall abundance, whereas Cytophaga-like bacteria were typically underrepresented in the DMSP-assim-ilating community. Members of the Roseobacter clade assimilated more DMSP on a per-cell basis than any other group, but they did not account for most of the DMSP assimilation, nor were they always present even when DMSP turnover was high.

40|$|How the {{functional}} traits (FTs) of phytoplankton change with temperature {{is important for}} understanding the impacts of ocean warming on phytoplankton mediated <b>biogeochemical</b> <b>fluxes.</b> This study quantifies the thermal performance curves (TPCs) of FTs in the cosmopolitan model diatom, Thalassiosira pseudonana, to advance understanding of trade-offs between physiological (photoacclimation, carbon fixation, nitrate, phosphate and silicate uptake) and morphological traits (cell volume and frustule silicification). We show that each FT has substantial phenotypic plasticity and exhibits a unique TPC, varying in both shape and thermal optimum, and diverging from the growth response. The TPC for growth was symmetric with a thermal optimum (Topt) of 18 °C. In comparison, the TPC for primary productivity was warm-skewed with a Topt around 21 °C, whereas frustule silicification decreased linearly with increasing temperature. Together, {{this suggests that the}} optimal temperature for overall fitness is a balance of trade-offs in the underlying functional traits. Moreover, these results demonstrate that growth is not necessarily an accurate estimate of overall biogeochemical performance and that temperature change will likely influence elemental fluxes such as carbon and silicon. Finally, we show that temperature-driven changes in individual traits e. g. photoacclimation, can mimic responses experienced under other environmental stressors (high light) and so a multi-trait assessment is essential for accurate interpretation of the cellular impact of warming. This study also reveals that multi-trait analysis, in the context of TPCs, provides insight into the cellular physiology regulating the whole cell response and has the potential to provide better estimates of how diatom-mediated <b>biogeochemical</b> <b>fluxes</b> are likely to be impacted in the context of ocean warming.

The literature indicates that the mercury <b>biogeochemical</b> <b>flux</b> is more dynamic than the current models predict, with interacting multimedia storage and processes. Although several natural mercury emissions models have been created and incorporated into air quality models (AQMs), none are coupled with air quality models on a mass balance basis, and all lack the capacity to explain processes that involve the transport of mercury across atmosphere–surface media concentration gradients. Existing natural mercury emission models treat the surface as both an infinite source and infinite sink for emissions and deposition, respectively, and estimate emissions through the following three pathways: soil, vegetation, and surface waters. The use of these three transport pathways, but with compartmentalized surface storage in a surface–vegetation–atmosphere transport (SVAT) resistance model, is suggested. Surface water fluxes will be modeled using a two-film diffusion model coupled to a surface water photochemical model. This updated framework will allow both the parameterization of the transport of mercury across atmosphere– surface media concentration gradients and the accumulation/depletion of mercury in the surface media. However, several key parameters need further experimental verification before the proposed modeling framework can be implemented in an AQM. These include soil organic mercury interactions, bioavailability, cuticular transport of mercury, atmospheric surface compensation points for different vegetation species, and enhanced soil diffusion resulting from pressure perturbations. 1...|$|E

Gene frequencies indicate selection for phosphorus acquisition (Mediterranean/Sargasso), DNA repair and high-light responses (Red Sea/Pacific Prochlorococcus), and osmolyte C 1 oxidation (Red Sea/Mediterranean SAR 11). The unexpected connection between salinity-dependent osmolyte production and SAR 11 C 1 metabolism represents a potentially major coevolutionary adaptation and <b>biogeochemical</b> <b>flux.</b> Among Prochlorococcus and cyanophage, genes enriched in specific environments had ecotype distributions similar to nonenriched genes, suggesting that inter-ecotype gene transfer is not a major source of environment-specific adaptation. Clustering of metagenomes using gene frequencies shows similarities in populations (Red Sea with Pacific, Mediterranean with Sargasso) that belie their geographic distances. Taken together, the genetic functions enriched in specific environments indicate competitive strategies for maintaining carrying capacity in the face of physical stressors and low nutrient availability. 2013 The Authors.

40|$|Forests {{are complex}} {{ecosystems}} which respond to external inputs of pollutants {{in a variety}} of ways. Quantifying changes in the storage of pollutants within ecosystem pools and the <b>biogeochemical</b> <b>fluxes</b> between them provides a means of calculating the overall pollutant balance of a forest ecosystem as an indicator of its sustainability and health. This chapter focuses on pollutant cycling in nonurban forest ecosystems with specific attention on quantification of external inputs, pollutant fluxes and pools within forests and exports to adjacent systems (Fig. 34. 1). Selected case studies are used to exemplify the approach and illustrate the importance of location, forest type, management practices such as harvesting and soil conditions. Direct pollutant impacts on forest ecosystem functioning, the effects of intensified biomass utilization, and interactions between climate and pollutant cycling are also discusse...|$|R
40|$|Submarine {{groundwater}} discharge (SGD) is a rarely recognized pathway for nutrients and other solutes from land to sea. The sensitive coastal ecosystems around tropical islands could be particularly affected by nutrient discharge associated with SGD {{in relation to}} surficial nutrient transport by rivers, but have received comparatively little attention to date. This study reviews the findings of local assessments of submarine {{groundwater discharge}} from tropical islands. In addition, the ratio of coast length and land area of individual land bodies is suggested as an appropriate first-order estimate of the relevance of SGD versus river discharge, demonstrating the potential relative importance of SGD from tropical islands over rivers. The review highlights the need for targeted research of submarine groundwater discharge from tropical islands and highlights its relevance for <b>biogeochemical</b> <b>fluxes</b> in these geographic settings...|$|R
40|$|Modeling <b>biogeochemical</b> <b>fluxes</b> in {{the marine}} {{plankton}} requires the application of factors for extrapolation of biomass indicators measured in the field (chlorophyll a, adenosine triphosphate, bacterial counts) to biomass carbon or nitrogen. These are often inferred from culture studies and are poorly constrained for natural populations. At least squares inverse method with a simple linear model constrains the values of several common indicator ratios, giving self-consistent solutions that provide useful information about {{the structure of the}} microbial community at our North Pacific Ocean study site (Station ALOHA (A Long-term Oligotrophic Habitat Assessment)). These results indicate that the fraction of the microbial biomass that is autotrophic (pigmented) is greater in the mixed layer than at the deep chlorophyll maximum layer and that heterotrophic bacteria are a significant but not necessarily predominant component of the microbial community in the euphotic zone...|$|R
