5|$|Following the {{cancellation}} of the German 500 at EuroSpeedway Lausitz due to financial difficulties, {{it was announced that}} the race at Rockingham was going ahead as scheduled. The chief executive of the track invited German CART fans to attend the Rockingham 500. Franchitti, considered by the media to be the pre-race favourite, said a victory at Rockingham would be the highlight of his season and that he wanted to entertain the spectators. Having finished second in the previous year's race, Kenny Bräck believed he could continue his good run of results in Europe and hoped the racing would be competitive. Da Matta said his team had made a large number of adjustments to his car's setup on ovals and hoped his vehicle would be <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> in Motegi. He believed the Rockingham 500 was important and hoped to secure a top-three finishing position. Carpentier said although he was disappointed with his previous result at the track, he was convinced {{he would be able to}} improve his performance.|$|E

The two boys, John and Charles, are both sent to school soon after her arrival, but the girls Rosalie and Matilda remain her charges. Matilda is a tomboy and Rosalie is a flirt. Both girls are selfish and sometimes unpleasant, and although Agnes's position is slightly <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> at Wellwood house, she is frequently ignored or used in the girls' schemes.|$|E
25|$|In addition, the US oil {{marketing}} hub at Cushing {{was flooded}} with new oil because most new North American production from Canada, North Dakota, and Texas converged at that point, and there was insufficient capacity to {{take it from there}} to refineries on the Gulf Coast, where half of US oil refinery capacity is located. The American pipeline system is designed to take imported oil from the Gulf Coast and Texas to the refineries in the northern US, and the new oil was flowing in the opposite direction, toward the Gulf Coast. The price of West Texas Intermediate delivered at Cushing, which is the main benchmark for US oil prices, fell to unprecedented low levels below other international benchmark oils such as Brent Crude and Dubai Crude. Since the price of WTI at Cushing is usually quoted by US media as the price of oil, this gave many Americans a distorted view of world oil prices as being lower than they were, and the supply being <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> internationally. Canada used to be in a similar position to the US in that offshore oil was cheaper than domestic oil, so the oil pipelines used to run westward from the east coast to Central Canada, now they are being reversed to carry cheaper domestic oil sands production from Alberta to the east coast.|$|E

2500|$|It is {{difficult}} to judge how the example set by developers such as Ripley affected the standards of speculative builders. Writing in 1891 William Cudworth had {{no doubt about the}} beneficial impact of the improved dwellings movement over the longer term. [...] "There can be no question that the housing of the operative classes is comparably <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> fifty years ago. There is more provision for separate bedrooms.... The cottage of today with its wide streets and separate closets is a fair approach to sanitary perfection".|$|E
2500|$|As {{a result}} of these {{signature}} projects, “Within five years, more than six thousand schools have been rebuilt and six of thirteen million children are now in school. Roads and bridges have been repaired, new roads have been built, and new wells have been dug. Access to health clinics is vastly <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> five years ago and the infant mortality rate is beginning to drop. Programs in rural transportation, safe drinking water, irrigation, and schools are among the twenty thousand projects that are now underway.” The work of the NSP also saw tremendous progression in the Afghan government. For example, “More than sixteen thousand locally elected community development councils now dot Afghanistan, and elected leaders choose projects that meet their priorities.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Undeniable Churaman did {{not prove}} {{himself to be}} a farsighted statesman. He lacked that vision {{prudence}} and spirit of accommodation, which were necessary in a successful leader of a tribal and democratic people like the Jats. Though born and brought up among them, he failed to appreciate their susceptibilities. As a result, despite his resources and status he could not weld them into [...] a compact and homogeneous unit or state. On the contrary, unrest and rift came to the forefront even during his lifetime. In the circumstance Badan Singh had to considerably overhaul his system and devise sagacious policies for the creation of the Jat State. Nevertheless, it would be unfair to deny Churaman his due recognition. By leaving an armed force, numbering 14,000 quite a few strong mud forts, considerable wealth and people conscious of their potentiality, he contributed a good deal towards the emergence of the Jat state. ALi his shortcoming admitted, the general condition of the Jats {{at the time of his}} death was <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> at his assumption of their leadership. Except depletion in his rank and followers, the rest of his long life’s work was intact, when his son, Muhkam Singh stepped into to fill up his place. As we shall see, Jai Singh’s victory over the latter, no doubt, inflicted a blow to the rising Jat power. But Churaman cannot be held solely responsible for whatever happened after his death. In any case churaman’s much talked about treasures escaped Jai Singh, and turned out to be of much use to Badan Singh., ...|$|E
