Most of the previous games' key creative minds and developers returned, and it was developed by Square Enix's First Production Department, with developer tri-Ace helping with the graphics. The development team wanted the game to bring a conclusive end to the story of both Lightning and the XIII universe, and to address criticisms leveled against the last two games. During its first week on sale in Japan, it sold 277,000 units, {{and by the end of}} 2013 become the 17th best-selling game of the year selling over 400,000 copies. It has sold 800,000 copies as of May 2014. In September 2014, Square Enix announced the Final Fantasy XIII series has been widely successful and has shipped over 11 million copies worldwide. The Microsoft Windows version has sold over 300,000 copies according to SteamSpy. It has received mixed reviews: while the main praise went to the game's battle system, opinions were more mixed for the graphics, time limit and other aspects of gameplay, while the story and characters were criticized for being weak or poorly developed. Final Fantasy series <b>brand</b> <b>manager</b> Shinji Hashimoto revealed in October 2016 that Lightning Returns met sales expectations and that Square Enix is satisfied with it.|$|E

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this article is to provide an {{overview}} of the challenges that the widespread desire for authenticity presents for <b>brand</b> <b>managers.</b> Design/methodology/approach - Provides a viewpoint essay. Findings - Authenticity requires <b>brand</b> <b>managers</b> to downplay their overt marketing prowess and instead locate their brands within communities and sub-cultures. Brands should become members of communities and appeal to more timeless values, while also delivering to members&# 039; needs. Research limitations/implications - Studies of how brands develop images of authenticity are needed. Case histories drawing on multiple sources of data of brands are also needed. Research into how consumers define authenticity is required. Practical implications - <b>Brand</b> <b>managers</b> must open up their brands to members of a community, downplay their overt marketing prowess, and appeal to the timeless values of that community. <b>Brand</b> <b>managers</b> should decouple and downplay their real business acumen in favour of appealing to social norms. Originality/value - Brand management models assume that brand marketers provide brands with meaning. This view is challenged, arguing that brand meaning is derived from the day-to-day interactions between the brand and subcultures. The article also challenges the view that marketers should necessarily appear proficient at what they do, instead calling for marketers to downplay their role in order to be more effective...|$|R

Though Hasbro has not revealed how much of My Little Pony product sales are bolstered by the brony fandom, Caitlin Dewey of The Washington Post suggests that the continued success of the franchise four years after its introduction is tied in part to bronies' interest in the show and products, and Hasbro's williness to market products towards the adult audience.|$|E

The hook [...] "Heaven couldn't wait for you / No heaven couldn't wait for you / So go on, go home" [...] is continuously repeated.

This angered Sega of Japan executives, who eventually decided to use the Dural chipset and cut ties with 3dfx. [...] According to former Sega of America vice president of communications and former NEC <b>brand</b> <b>manager</b> Charles Bellfield, presentations of games using the NEC solution showcased the performance and low cost delivered by the SH-4 and PowerVR architecture. He further stated that [...] "Sega's relationship with NEC, a Japanese company, probably made a difference [...] too." [...] Stolar, on the other hand, [...] "felt the US version, the 3Dfx version, should have been used. Japan wanted the Japanese version, and Japan won." [...] As a result, 3dfx filed a lawsuit against both Sega and NEC claiming breach of contract, which would eventually be settled out of court. The choice to use the PowerVR architecture concerned Electronic Arts (EA), a longtime developer for Sega's consoles. EA had invested in 3dfx but was unfamiliar with the selected architecture, which was reportedly less powerful. As recounted by Shiro Hagiwara (a general manager at Sega's hardware division) and Ian Oliver (the managing director of Sega subsidiary Cross Products), the SH-4 was chosen while it was still in development and following a lengthy deliberation process because it was the only available processor that [...] "could adapt to deliver the 3D geometry calculation performance necessary."
