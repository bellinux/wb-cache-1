Osborne hinted that he should like quite as well {{to sit in the}} dark; but Miss Sedley, laughing, declined to bear him company any farther, and the two accordingly followed Mr. Joseph. Rebecca sang far better than her friend (though of course Osborne was free to keep his opinion), and exerted herself to the utmost, and, indeed, to the wonder of Amelia, who had never known her perform so well. She sang a French song, which Joseph did not understand in the least, and which George confessed he did not understand, and then a number of those simple ballads which were the fashion forty years ago, and in which British tars, our King, poor Susan, <b>blue-eyed</b> <b>Mary,</b> and the like, were the principal themes. They are not, it is said, very brilliant, in a musical point of view, but contain numberless good-natured, simple appeals to the affections, which people understood better than the milk-and-water lagrime, sospiri, and felicita of the eternal Donizettian music with which we are favoured now-a-days.|$|E

50|$|Collinsia bartsiifolia is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the plantain family known by the common name white <b>blue-eyed</b> <b>Mary.</b>|$|E
50|$|It blooms from mid {{spring to}} early summer. Like other {{species in the}} genus Collinsia, which also {{includes}} the <b>blue-eyed</b> <b>Marys,</b> it gets its name from its towers of inflorescences of decreasing diameter, which give the plants in full flower a certain resemblance to a pagoda.|$|R

The King stepped in, {{thinking}} [...] that keeping Henry busy would {{be the best way to}} end the affair, as would keeping him from drinking too much, too often. That year, he arranged a series of tours for his son to undertake.|$|R

And it was for her sake that Bob Brown the butcher's boy whopped me. A black eye! I'm not handsome. But if I were ugly, ugly as the Saracen's 'Ead, ugly as that beast Bulkeley, I know {{it would be all}} the same to Mary. SHE has never forgot the boy she loved, that brought birds'-nests for her, and spent his halfpenny on cherries, and bought a fairing with his first half-crown--a brooch it was, I remember, of two billing doves a-hopping on one twig, and brought it home for little yellow-haired, <b>blue-eyed,</b> red-cheeked <b>Mary.</b> Lord, Lord! I don't like to think how I've kissed 'em, the pretty cheeks! they've got quite pale now with crying--and she has never once reproached me, not once, the trump, the little tr-rump! ...|$|R
50|$|A top {{attraction}} in the Dowagiac Woods Nature Sanctuary is {{the abundance of}} <b>blue-eyed</b> <b>Mary,</b> Collinsia verna. For six full weeks, beginning early in April, it reigns supreme. Over 150 beds {{can be seen from}} the trail, each averaging ten by twenty feet square.|$|E
5000|$|Collinsia torreyi is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the plantain family known by the common name Torrey's <b>blue-eyed</b> <b>Mary.</b> It is native to California and adjacent sections of Oregon and Nevada, where it grows in the coniferous forests of several mountain ranges, including the Sierra Nevada.|$|E
50|$|Collinsia sparsiflora is a {{flowering}} {{plant in the}} Plantaginaceae known by the common names spinster's <b>blue-eyed</b> <b>Mary</b> and few-flowered collinsia. One variety of the species is native to the West Coast of the United States {{as far north as}} Washington, while the other three varieties are limited to California alone.|$|E
5000|$|Lady Mary {{was born}} at Madresfield Court as the fifth out of seven {{children}} and third daughter of the Earl and Countess Beauchamp. In June 1930, Lady Mary dated Prince George and was set to be engaged to him. However, Lord and Lady Beauchamp's marriage fell apart when the former's homosexual relationships were publicly revealed by the latter's brother, the Duke of Westminster, in 1931. The scandal ruined Lady Mary's chances of marrying the King's son, and Lord Beauchamp went into exile on the continent. Lady Beauchamp, [...] "always disliked and now hated by her daughters", left Madresfield Court and retired to her brother's estate. The tall, blond and <b>blue-eyed</b> Lady <b>Mary</b> and her three sisters, called the [...] "Beauchamp Belles", were left in charge of Madresfield Court. Around that time, Lady Mary formed a close and long-lasting friendship with the author Evelyn Waugh, inspiring the character of Lady Julia Flyte from Brideshead Revisited.|$|R

That year, he arranged a series of tours for his son to undertake. [...] In 1929, he went to Japan to confer the Garter on the Emperor, and a year later he attended the coronation of Haile Selassie of Ethiopia in Addis Ababa. In 1934 George V (as King of Ireland) made him a Knight of St Patrick, Ireland's chivalric order. It was the second to last time this order was awarded (the last appointment being the Duke of York, later George VI, in 1936); at the time of his death, the Duke of Gloucester was the only remaining knight. In 1934, he went to Australia and New Zealand where the people received him with overwhelming enthusiasm that one journalist wrote, [...] "(amounted) to something very near adoration".|$|R
50|$|Collinsia verna, <b>blue-eyed</b> <b>Mary</b> is {{a winter}} annual that {{is native to}} the eastern and central parts of North America but has become {{endangered}} in the states New York and Tennessee. The flowers are bicolored white and blue. It is a plant of valley bottoms and moist bottom slopes, in areas with moderate lighting and requires some shade.|$|E
50|$|Collinsia callosa is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the plantain family known by the common name desert mountain <b>blue-eyed</b> <b>Mary.</b> It is endemic to California, where it grows {{in the mountains of}} the southernmost Sierra Nevada, the Transverse Ranges, and the mountains of the Mojave Desert region. It grows in desert scrub, chaparral, and woodland habitat on the mountain slopes.|$|E
50|$|A {{promontory}} {{near the}} summit of the hill contains a stand of Islais cherry trees (Prunus ilicifolia). During spring, several wildflowers bloom lower on the hill in its grasslands which retain many native species such as California goldfields, California buttercup, dwarf checkerbloom, San Francisco <b>blue-eyed</b> <b>Mary,</b> and the California larkspur, the latter two of which are found wild within San Francisco only in Bayview Park.|$|E
50|$|Often {{different}} genes {{can interact}} {{in a way}} that influences the same trait. In the <b>Blue-eyed</b> <b>Mary</b> (Omphalodes verna), for example, there exists a gene with alleles that determine the color of flowers: blue or magenta. Another gene, however, controls whether the flowers have color at all or are white. When a plant has two copies of this white allele, its flowers are white—regardless of whether the first gene has blue or magenta alleles. This interaction between genes is called epistasis, with the second gene epistatic to the first.|$|E
5000|$|Redrock Mountain Natural Area Preserve is a 640 acre Natural Area Preserve {{located in}} Smyth County, Virginia. The {{preserve}} {{is named for}} the 4413 ft Redrock Mountain, which itself is named for its red siltstone cliffs. It supports a number of rare natural features, and two natural community types, including examples of [...] "mountain/piedmont basic woodlands" [...] upon the mountain's slopes, and [...] "rich cove/slope forests" [...] in the preserve's lowlands. Five rare plant species are found on the property, including spring <b>blue-eyed</b> <b>Mary</b> (Collinsia verna), fringed scorpion-weed (Phacelia fimbriata), and Carey saxifrage (Saxifraga careyana).|$|E
50|$|This {{woods was}} {{virtually}} unknown even to people living nearby until 1975, {{when it came}} to the attention of the Michigan Nature Association because of a report from a memberthat <b>Blue-eyed</b> <b>Mary</b> grew there. Response to an appeal by the Michigan Nature Association in 1981 for $110,000 to purchase the woods was overwhelming. Despite poor economic conditions in the state at the time, the campaign was completed in one year. Over 550 individual contributions were given, climaxed by a $20,000 grant from the Kresge Foundation. In a marvelous show of cooperation, twenty percent of the amount needed was raised in Cass County alone.|$|E
5000|$|Collinsia verna {{is often}} found in areas of damp open wood as it {{requires}} ample amounts of shade. Moist to mesic environmental conditions with rich loamy soil are preferred as the growth and size of individual plants is strongly influenced by the moisture conditions and {{the richness of the}} soil. The seeds need to be planted during the summer so that they will germinate during the fall. Collinsia verna can also flourish in habitats including wooded lower slopes of river valleys, and along woodland paths. Sometimes <b>Blue-Eyed</b> <b>Mary</b> grow in drier deciduous woodlands, however in these cases, the individual plants are reported to be smaller in size.|$|E
50|$|Collinsia rattanii is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the plantain family known by the common name sticky <b>blue-eyed</b> <b>Mary.</b> It is native to the coniferous forests of the Pacific Northwest of the United States from Washington to northern California. It is an annual herb growing up to 40 centimeters tall with linear leaves rolled under along the edges. The leaves are hairy on the upper surface and hairless and purple-tinted underneath. The inflorescence is coated in sticky glandular hairs. It has a series of nodes from which arise one to five flowers each on pedicels. The flower is only 4 to 8 millimeters long, with two mostly white upper lobes and three mostly purple lower lobes.|$|E

Pictured on a neutral background.; "These are hardy annuals that are mostly natives of California and western North America. They belong to the Snapdragon family, Scrophulariaceae. They grow about a foot high and bear whorls of pretty flowers ranging in color from white through lilac and rose to violet and blue. They flower in the summer when they're outside and are nice for edging beds and borders. They can be grown in pots in the greenhouse and will bloom in early spring. The most popular kind is Collinsia bicolor, which has lilac and white flowers and its variety, candidissima, which has white flowers. Salmon Beauty has very pretty flowers colored salmon-rose. C. grandiflora carminea has very large, reddish-violet flowers. C. verna, <b>Blue-Eyed</b> <b>Mary,</b> is great for the wild garden. " [...] unknown author...|$|E
