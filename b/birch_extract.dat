40|$|Abstract Background Pentacyclic triterpenes, mainly betulin and betulinic acid, are {{valuable}} anticancer agents {{found in the}} bark of birch tree. This study evaluates <b>birch</b> bark <b>extracts</b> for the active principles composition. Results New improved extraction methods were applied on the bark of Betula pendula {{in order to reach}} the maximum content in active principles. Extracts were analyzed by HPLC-MS, Raman, SERS and 13 C NMR spectroscopy which revealed a very high yield of betulin (over 90 %). Growth inhibiting effects were measured in vitro on four malignant human cell lines: A 431 (skin epidermoid carcinoma), A 2780 (ovarian carcinoma), HeLa (cervix adenocarcinoma) and MCF 7 (breast adenocarcinoma), by means of MTT assay. All of the prepared bark extracts exerted a pronounced antiproliferative effect against human cancer cell lines.

IgE reactivity to individual birch pollen allergens {{has been shown to}} differ between populations of birch pollen-allergic patients living in different countries. In this study, we examined the IgE profiles to recombinant birch pollen allergens in birch-sensitive patients living in Sapporo. MethodsThis study used the sera of 40 patients with specific IgE toward <b>birch</b> pollen <b>extract.</b> Their sera were analyzed for specific IgE reactivity to individual birch pollen allergens (recombinant Bet v 1, Bet v 2 and Bet v 4) and natural <b>birch</b> pollen <b>extract</b> using Pharmacia CAP System™. ResultsOf 40 sera with positive CAP results for natural <b>birch</b> pollen <b>extract,</b> 39 (97. 5 %) had specific IgE towards Bet v 1; 6 (15 %) contained specific IgE against Bet v 2. Bet v 4 reactivity was documented in only one subject (2. 5 %). ConclusionsThe present data suggest that the specific IgE reactivity profiles to birch pollen allergen in birch-sensitive patients in Sapporo correspond to those in Scandinavia, possibly due to the heavy birch pollen exposure in this area. This observation provides useful information for future birch allergen-specific immunotherapy in Japan...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectiveThis study {{sought to}} {{determine}} the antioxidant activities of African birch leaf, to assess its interaction with key enzymes relevant to type 2 diabetes (α-amylase and α-glucosidase) and to evaluate its effect on acarbose in vitro. MethodsOne milligram per milliliter of aqueous extract of African birch and acarbose were separately prepared. At the same time, both the African extract and acarbose solution (50 : 50 v/v) were thoroughly mixed until homogeneity was attained. The phenolic phytoconstituents and antioxidant properties of African birch leaf were subsequently determined. Finally, the effects of African <b>birch</b> <b>extract,</b> acarbose solution and a mixture of acarbose and African <b>birch</b> <b>extract</b> on α-amylase and α-glucosidase activities were assessed in vitro. ResultsThe results showed that African <b>birch</b> <b>extract</b> demonstrated a remarkable antioxidant effect, as exemplified by its radical scavenging abilities, Fe 2 + chelating ability and prevention of lipid peroxidation. Acarbose had significantly (p <  0. 05) higher α-amylase (IC 50  =  11. 77  μg/ml) and α-glucosidase (IC 50  =  9. 05  μg/ml) activities compared to African <b>birch</b> <b>extract</b> [α-amylase (IC 50  =  242. 17  μg/ml); α-glucosidase (IC 50  =  196. 35  μg/ml) ].

40|$|Experimental {{allergen}} {{challenge is}} widely used in diagnostic practice and research in allergy, but its relationship to environmental exposures is not clarified. Both models of allergic diseases {{have been used in}} order {{to examine the effects of}} allergen specific immunotherapy (SIT). Placebo-controlled studies have demonstrated the clinical efficacy of this treatment. However, long-term placebo-controlled studies with standardized <b>birch</b> pollen <b>extract</b> were lacking and the effect on early and late asthmatic reactions had not been examined in birch pollen-allergic patients. The aims of this thesis were (I) to investigate the relationship between experimental and environmental bronchial challenge; (II) to examine the early kinetics of skin and mucosal sensitivity following rush immunotherapy (rapid up-dosing schedule); (III) to evaluate the effect of immunotherapy with standardized <b>birch</b> pollen <b>extract</b> on airway symptoms and use of medication in birch pollen-allergic patients in a placebo-controlled study and; (IV) to examine the effect of specific immunotherapy with standardized <b>birch</b> pollen <b>extract</b> on early- and late-phase asthmatic reactions in asthmatic patients. Sixty-two patients with cat-induced asthma underwent an experimental allergen bronchial challenge followed by an environmental challenge. Thirty-four percent (21 / 62) of the patients developed a late response in both challenge models and 31 % (19 / 62) failed to develop a late response in either model. Thus, consistency in development of a late response was found in 65 % of the patients. Twelve cat- and five birch pollen-allergic patients received rush immunotherapy and underwent allergen challenges to skin and conjunctiva plus methacholine tests of lower airways and blood cell counts before and after 3 days, 1 week, 3 weeks and 12 weeks of therapy. Treatment significantly reduced skin and conjunctival sensitivity after three weeks, while transient increases in eosinophil numbers and bronchial hyperreactivity were seen after one week. In a 2 -year placebo-controlled immunotherapy 49 patients with a history of birch pollen allergy symptoms involving the upper and lower airways were included and treated with a standardized <b>birch</b> pollen <b>extract.</b> A significant reduction in symptoms and use of medication was demonstrated in the treatment group compared to the placebo. In a further placebo-controlled study including 19 birch pollen asthmatic patients, a significant decrease in early and late asthmatic responses was seen following allergen bronchial challenge after one year of birch SIT. In conclusion: The results show that environmental bronchial challenges may be replaced by experimental challenges for studies of the late phase reaction in allergic asthma. Rush immunotherapy was found to significantly reduce the skin and conjunctival sensitivity while transient increases in eosinophil numbers and bronchial hyperreactivity were seen. Allergen specific immunotherapy with <b>birch</b> pollen <b>extract</b> was shown to be a clinical effective and safe treatment.

40|$|Background: Birch pollen is an {{important}} outdoor allergen able to aggravate symptoms in atopic dermatitis (AD). Specific immunotherapy (SIT), an established procedure for allergic airway diseases, might also represent an attractive therapeutic option for the causal treatment of allergen-triggered cutaneous symptoms in these patients. Studies with house dust mite SIT have already shown beneficial effects in AD patients, whereas the safety and efficacy of SIT with <b>birch</b> pollen <b>extract</b> in AD patients have not been studied so far. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate for the first time the safety and efficacy of SIT with a depigmented polymerized <b>birch</b> pollen <b>extract</b> in AD patients. Methods: Fifty-five adult patients with moderate-to-severe AD and clinically relevant sensitization to birch pollen received SIT for 12 weeks. SIT was continued during birch pollen season. The assessment of safety, the total SCORAD value, and the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) were evaluated. Results: The median total SCORAD value was reduced by 34 % (p < 0. 001) during the course of treatment and the mean DLQI improved by 49 % (p < 0. 001) despite strong simultaneous birch pollen exposure. Eight patients (14. 5 %) developed systemic reactions and 19 patients (34. 5 %) developed local reactions which were of mild intensity in most cases. No patient discontinued the study prematurely due to adverse drug reactions. Coseasonal treatment was well tolerated. Conclusion: SIT with a depigmented polymerized <b>birch</b> pollen <b>extract</b> leads to significant improvement of the SCORAD value and the DLQI in patients suffering from moderate-to-severe AD sensitized to birch pollen.

Normally, <b>birch</b> bark <b>extract</b> is produced for this purpose by extraction with organic solvents. Employing supercritical fluid technology, our aim was to develop a <b>birch</b> bark dry <b>extract</b> suitable for stabilisation of lipophilic gels with improved properties while avoiding the use of toxic solvents. With supercritical carbon dioxide, three different particle formation methods from supercritical solutions have been tested. First, particle deposition was performed from a supercritical solution in an expansion chamber. Second, the Rapid Expansion of Supercritical Solutions (RESS) method was used for particle generation. Third, a modified RESS-procedure, forming the particles directly into the thereby gelated liquid, was developed. All three methods gave yields from 1 % to 5. 8 %, depending on the techniques employed. The triterpene composition of the three extracts was comparable: all three gave more stable oleogels compared to the use of an extract obtained by organic solvent extraction. Characterizing the rheological behaviour of these gels, a faster gelling effect was seen together with a lower concentration of the extract required for the gel formation with the supercritical fluid (SCF) -extracts. This confirms the superiority of the supercritical fluid produced extracts with regard to the oleogel forming properties...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} the efficacy of a phytotherapic which includes Solidago, Orthosiphon and <b>Birch</b> <b>extract</b> (Cistimev®) in association with antibiotic prophylaxis in female patients affected by recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIr). Materials and methods: Patients affected by UTIr older than 18 years started a 3 -months antibiotic prophylaxis (Prulifloxacin 600 mg, 1 cps/week or Phosphomicyn 1 cachet/week) according to antibiogram after urine culture. The patients were divided in 2 groups: Group A: antibiotic prophylaxis plus phytotherapy (1 cps/die for 3 months) and Group B: antibiotic prophylaxis alone. Results: 164 consecutive patients were studied: 107 were included in group A (mean age 59 ± 17. 3 years) and 57 (mean age 61 ± 15. 7) in group B. During the treatment period the relapse frequencies between the two groups were not significantly different (p = 0. 854) : 12 / 107 (11. 21 %) patients interrupted the treatment for UTIr in group A and 6 / 57 (10. 52 %) in group B. In the long term follow-up the relapse UTI risk was significant different in the two groups with a relapse risk 2. 5 greater in group B than in group A (p < 0. 0001). Conclusion: Our study demonstrated that in female patients affected by recurrent UTI, the association between antibiotic prophylaxis and of a phytotherapic which includes Solidago, Orthosiphon and <b>Birch</b> <b>extract</b> reduced the number of UTI in the 12 months following the end of prophylaxis and obtained a longer relapsing time, greatly improving the quality of life of the patients...|$|E

The objectives were to investigate the epitope specificity of IgG-antibodies induced by depigmented-polymerized (Dpg-Pol) allergoids and unmodified allergen extracts, and examine IgE-blocking activity of induced IgG-antibodies. Methods. Rabbits were immunized with native and Dpg-Pol extracts of birch pollen, and serum samples were obtained. Recognition of linear IgG-epitopes of Bet v 1 and Bet v 2 and the capacity of these IgG-antibodies to block binding of human-IgE was determined. Results. Serum from rabbits immunized with native extracts recognised 11 linear epitopes from Bet v 1, while that from Dpg-Pol-immunized animals recognised 8. For Bet v 2, 8 epitopes were recognized by IgG from native immunized animals, and 9 from Dpg-Pol immunized one.

Here, we developed a label-free Electric Cell-substrate Impedance Sensing (ECIS) -based cytotoxicity assay that can be applied in the assessment of the cytotoxicity of natural extracts. The conditions to measure the impedance using ECIS were first optimized in mice immortalized hypothalamic neurons GT 1 - 7 cells. The performance of four natural extracts when tested using three conventional cytotoxicity assays in GT 1 - 7 cells, was studied. Betula pendula (silver birch tree) was found to interfere with all of the cytotoxicity assays in which labels were applied. The silver <b>birch</b> <b>extract</b> was also proven to be cytotoxic and, thus, served as a proof-of-concept for the use of ECIS.

40|$|Background: Among birch pollen {{allergic}} patients up to 70 % develop {{allergic reactions}} to Bet v 1 -homologue food allergens such as Api g 1 (celery) or Dau c 1 (carrot), termed as birch pollen-related food allergy. In most cases, specific immunotherapy with <b>birch</b> pollen <b>extracts</b> does not reduce allergic symptoms to the homologue food allergens. We therefore genetically engineered a multi-allergen chimer and tested if mucosal treatment with this construct could represent {{a novel approach}} for prevention of birch pollen-related food allergy. Methodology: BALB/c mice were poly-sensitized {{with a mixture of}} Bet v 1, Api g 1 and Dau c 1 followed by a sublingual challenge with carrot, celery and <b>birch</b> pollen <b>extracts.</b> For prevention of allergy sensitization an allergen chimer composed of immunodominant T cell epitopes of Api g 1 and Dau c 1 linked to the whole Bet v 1 allergen, was intranasally applied prior to sensitization. Results: Intranasal pretreatment with the allergen chimer led to significantly decreased antigen-specific IgE-dependent b-hexosaminidase release, but enhanced allergen-specific IgG 2 a and IgA antibodies. Accordingly, IL- 4 levels in spleen cell cultures and IL- 5 levels in restimulated spleen and cervical lymph node cell cultures were markedly reduced, while IFN-c levels were increased.

40|$|Hemicelluloses are {{potential}} {{raw material for}} several items produced in future wood-based biorefineries. One possible method for recovering hemicelluloses from wood extracts is ultrafiltration (UF). However, low filtration capacities and severe fouling restrict the use of tight UF membranes {{in the treatment of}} wood extracts. The lack of suitable commercial membranes creates a need for pretreatment which would decrease fouling and increase the filtration capacity. This thesis focuses on the evaluation of the possibility to improve the filtration capacity and decrease fouling with the pretreatment of wood extracts. Methods which remove harmful compounds and methods which degrade them are studied, as well as combinations of the methods. The tested pretreatments have an influence on both the concentration of different compounds and the molecular mass distribution of the compounds in the extract. This study revealed that in addition to which kind of compounds were removed, also the change in molecular size distribution affected the filtration capacity significantly. It was shown that the most harmful compounds for the filtration capacity of the hydrophobic 5 kDa membrane were the ones capable of permeating the membrane and fouling also the inner membrane structure. Naturally, the size of the most harmful compounds depends on the used UF membrane and is thus case-specific. However, in the choice of the pretreatment method, the focus should be on the removal of harmful compound sizes rather than merely on the total amount of removed foulants. The results proved that filtration capacity can be increased with both adsorptive and oxidative pretreatments even by hundreds of per cents. For instance, the use of XAD 7 and XAD 16 adsorbents increased the average flux in the UF of a <b>birch</b> <b>extract</b> from nearly zero to 107 kg/(m 2 h) and 175 kg/(m 2 h), respectively. In the treatment of a spruce extract, oxidation by pulsed corona discharge (PCD) increased the flux in UF from 46 kg/(m 2 h) to 158 kg/(m 2 h). Moreover, when a <b>birch</b> <b>extract</b> batch was treated with laccase enzyme, the flux in UF increased from 15 kg/(m 2 h) to 36 kg/(m 2 h). However, fouling was decreased only by adsorptive pretreatment while oxidative methods had a negligible or even negative impact on it. This demonstrates that filtration capacity and fouling are affected by different compounds and mechanisms. The results of this thesis show that filtration capacity can be improved and fouling decreased through appropriate pretreatment. However, the choice of the best possible pretreatment is case-specific and depends on the wood extract and the membrane used. Finding the best option requires information on the extract content and membrane characteristics {{as well as on the}} filtration performance of the membrane in the prevailing conditions and a multivariate approach. On the basis of this study, it can be roughly concluded that adsorptive pretreatment improves the filtration capacity and decreases fouling rather reliably, but it may lead to significant hemicellulose losses. Oxidation reduces the loss of valuable hemicelluloses and could improve the filtration capacity, but fouling challenges may remain. Combining oxidation with adsorptive pretreatment was not a solution for avoiding hemicellulose losses in the tested cases...|$|E

40|$|Effective {{processes}} to fractionate the main compounds in biomass, such as wood, are {{a prerequisite for}} an effective biorefinery. Water is environmentally friendly and widely used in industry, {{which makes it a}} potential solvent also for forest biomass. At elevated temperatures over 100 °C, water can readily hydrolyse and dissolve hemicelluloses from biomass. In this work, <b>birch</b> sawdust was <b>extracted</b> using pressurized hot water (PHWE) flow-through systems. The hypothesis of the work was {{that it is possible to}} obtain polymeric, water-soluble hemicelluloses from birch sawdust using flow-through PHW extractions at both laboratory and large scale. Different extraction temperatures in the range 140 – 200 °C were evaluated to see the effect of temperature to the xylan yield. The yields and extracted hemicelluloses were analysed to obtain sugar ratios, the amount of acetyl groups, furfurals and the xylan yields. Higher extraction temperatures increased the xylan yield, but decreased the molar mass of the dissolved xylan. As the extraction temperature increased, more acetic acid was released from the hemicelluloses, thus further decreasing the pH of the extract. There were only trace amounts of furfurals present after the extractions, indicating that the treatment was mild enough not to degrade the sugars further. The sawdust extraction density was increased by packing more sawdust in the laboratory scale extraction vessel. The aim was to obtain extracts with higher concentration than in typical extraction densities. The extraction times and water flow rates were kept constant during these extractions. The higher sawdust packing degree decreased the water use in the extractions and the extracts had higher hemicellulose concentrations than extractions with lower sawdust degrees of packing. The molar masses of the hemicelluloses were similar in higher packing degrees and in the degrees of packing that were used in typical PHWE flow-through extractions. The structure of extracted sawdust was investigated using small angle-(SAXS) and wide angle (WAXS) x-ray scattering. The cell wall topography of <b>birch</b> sawdust and <b>extracted</b> sawdust was compared using x-ray tomography. The results showed that the structure of the cell walls of <b>extracted</b> <b>birch</b> sawdust was preserved but the cell walls were thinner after the extractions. Larger pores were opened inside the fibres and cellulose microfibrils were more tightly packed after the extraction. Acetate buffers were used to control the pH of the extracts during the extractions. The pH control prevented excessive xylan hydrolysis and increased the molar masses of the extracted xylans. The yields of buffered extractions were lower than for plain water extractions at 160 – 170 °C, but at 180 °C yields were similar to those from plain water and pH buffers. The pH can thus be controlled during extraction with acetate buffer to obtain xylan with higher molar mass than those obtainable using plain water. <b>Birch</b> sawdust was <b>extracted</b> both in the laboratory and pilot scale. The performance of the PHWE flow-through system was evaluated in the laboratory and the pilot scale using vessels with the same shape but different volumes, with the same relative water flow through the sawdust bed, and in the same extraction temperature. Pre-steaming improved the extraction efficiency and the water flow through the sawdust bed. The <b>extracted</b> <b>birch</b> sawdust and the extracted xylan were similar in both laboratory and pilot scale. The PHWE system was successfully scaled up by a factor of 6000 from the laboratory to pilot scale and extractions performed equally well in both scales. The results show that a flow-through system can be further scaled up and used to extract water-soluble xylans from <b>birch</b> sawdust. <b>Extracted</b> xylans can be concentrated, purified, and then used in e. g. films and barriers, or as building blocks for novel material applications...|$|R

There is a significant potential of biomass residues in Sweden suitable for the extraction of various compounds, including upgrading by biocatalytic processes, in addition to current energy generation. Two examples presented are quercetin extracted from onion waste by pressurised hot water in conjunction with enzymatic hydrolysis, and betulin from <b>birch</b> bark <b>extracted</b> by liquid CO 2 containing ethanol. Inherent in these two extraction processes and production routes {{is the ability to}} show good environmental performance from a life cycle perspective.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the in vitro effects of flavonoid-rich plant extracts (PE) on ruminal fermentation characteristics and methane emission by studying their effectiveness for methanogenesis in the rumen. A fistulated Holstein cow was used as a donor of rumen fluid. The PE (Punica granatum, Betula schmidtii, Ginkgo biloba, Camellia japonica, and Cudrania tricuspidata) known to have high concentrations of flavonoid were added to an in vitro fermentation incubated with rumen fluid. Total gas production and microbial growth with all PE was higher than that of the control at 24 h incubation, while the methane emission was significantly lower (p< 0. 05) than that of the control. The decrease in methane accumulation relative to the control was 47. 6 %, 39. 6 %, 46. 7 %, 47. 9 %, and 48. 8 % for Punica, Betula, Ginkgo, Camellia, and Cudrania treatments, respectively. Ciliate populations were reduced by more than 60 % in flavonoid-rich PE treatments. The Fibrobacter succinogenes diversity in all added flavonoid-rich PE was shown to increase, while the Ruminoccocus albus and R. flavefaciens populations in all PE decreased as compared with the control. In particular, the F. succinogenes community with the addition of <b>Birch</b> <b>extract</b> increased to a greater extent than that of others. In conclusion, the results of this study showed that flavonoid-rich PE decreased ruminal methane emission without adversely affecting ruminal fermentation characteristics in vitro in 24 h incubation time, suggesting that the flavonoid-rich PE have potential possibility as bio-active regulator for ruminants...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{control of}} Potato virus Y (PVY, genus Potyvirus, family Potyviridae) {{is one of}} the {{greatest}} challenges in seed potato production worldwide. PVY can cause substantial economic losses. It reduces the growth of potato plants and the quality and quantity of yield. Therefore, when virus incidence exceeds set thresholds, the potatoes cannot be sold as seed but have to be sold at a lower price for consumption. PVY is transmitted in a non-persistent manner by winged forms of many aphid species. This mode of transmission is characterised by short probing activity, which is sufficient for acquisition and transmission of the virus. Because of these underlying epidemiological factors, PVY is difficult to control. Around 2005, the High grade (HG) seed potato production area in Finland, which {{is one of the}} northernmost intensive crop production areas of the world, saw a marked increase in the incidence of PVY in potato seed lots. Therefore, it became necessary to investigate the epidemiology of PVY and establish measures of PVY control in this region. [...] - Aims: 1) To characterise the species composition and phenology of the aphid fauna. 2) To determine the incidence of aphid species with documented ability to transmit PVY and to use a modelling approach to determine their relative importance as vectors including timing of virus transmission. 3) To compare the application of straw mulch, mineral oil and <b>birch</b> <b>extract</b> with chemical practices for control of PVY vectors. Methods: The area under study was Tyrnävä-Liminka (latitude 64 °) in Finland. Studies were carried out in the potato growing seasons from 2007 to 2012. Aphid flight activity was monitored by yellow pan traps (YPT) placed in 4 8 seed potato fields per year and by one suction trap. Aphid identification was done by morphological characteristics and by DNA barcoding based on a 658 -bp long region of the mitochondrial gene for cytochrome c oxidase I (COI). A cluster analysis was used to categorise phenology of species. Incidence of PVY was measured by testing leaves collected two weeks after plant emergence and in the progeny tubers after harvest by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). To determine the most important time of transmission of PVY, and the main vectors, the seasonal increase in PVY incidence was modelled using aphid counts in traps, the relative vector efficiencies of the aphids, virus resistance of cultivars, and the initial infection rate of the seed tubers as explanatory variables in generalised linear mixed modelling. In addition, small scale experiments (SSE) were conducted in three years and large scale (LSE) field trials in two years. SSE were set up to compare applications of straw mulch, mineral oil and <b>birch</b> <b>extract</b> with chemical control of PVY vectors. LSE were conducted in growers fields to test efficacy of straw mulch to control PVY at farm scale. [...] Results: A total of 58, 528 winged aphid individuals were classified into 83 taxa based on morphology: Of these, 34 species were further characterised by DNA barcoding. Four phenology clusters were found. The late-peak cluster was dominated by heteroecious species and the mid-peak cluster was dominated by monoecious species feeding on herbaceous plants. Total abundance showed a recurring triennial cycle according to the catch of aphids using the suction trap in the years 2000 - 2010. The most abundant species was Rhopalosiphum padi. It occurred mainly at the end of the potato growing season. The highly polyphagous species, Aphis fabae and Aphis gossypii were found to peak at the beginning of the potato growing season. Results of the modelling approach showed that the incidence of seedborne PVY infection and the early-season flight of Aphis fabae are the most important factors contributing to the incidence of PVY in the yield. Other aphid species play a negligible role as vectors of PVY. In the SSEs, only straw mulch reduced of PVY incidence significantly in the progeny tubers, with the reduction ranging from 50 % to 70 % in all three years. Incidence of PVY was reduced by mineral oil in two years (by 43 % to 58 %) and by the synthetic pyrethroid insecticide esfenvalerate by 29 % in one year. In the LSE, straw mulch significantly reduced PVY in the progeny tubers by 25 % to 47 %. Average tuber yield following the straw mulch treatment was generally but not significantly higher than that in the untreated control in all experiments. [...] Conclusion: The results demonstrate that early season flight activity of Aphis fabae determines PVY incidence in the HG seed potato production area of Finland with a generally low vector pressure. Furthermore, straw mulch emerges as a reliabe and effective measure in diminishing the spread of PVY in areas with early vector flight activity.

40|$|Condensed tannins (CT) in {{the diet}} of {{ruminants}} may reduce feed intake and digestibility, and thereby production. However, dietary CT may increase protein utilization, reduce enteric methane loss and reduce gastrointestinal nematodes. The cultivation of tannin containing forages are limited in Norway, but bark of tree species that is harvested may have high quantities of CT. The objectives {{of the present study}} were to 1) assess the value of CT as feed additive; 2) assess the availability and the condition of Norwegian bark resources; 3) characterize the concentration, variation and type of CT in bark sampled from commercial sawmills and in fresh bark from logging sites; 4) evaluate the possibility for isolation and concentrating CT from bark, and 5) quantify the anthelmintic activity of selected bark extracts in vitro. - Few studies have tested bark or CT from bark in vivo. The literature review revealed that the studies conducted mainly focused on hydrolysable tannins, extracted from the wood of a chestnut species, and CT from the bark and wood of the tropical tree species (mimosa and quebracho). Anthelmintic activity of CT extracted from Scotts pine (Pinus sylvestris) has been demonstrated in laboratory test, and the addition of bark {{in the diet}} of goats of an American pine species (Pinus taeda) resulted in increased growth rate and reduced fecal egg count. - Total annual bark volume in Norway is estimated to be 642, 665 m 3. About 60 % of the bark is burned, which provides about 40 % available for alternative use. A challenge is contamination of sand and soil. - The content of CT in bark samples taken from tree species in Middle Norway varied with the age of the tree at sampling, but on average, dry bark of pine contained 4. 9, spruce 3. 9 and birch 3 % CT, respectively. Procyanidins were the dominant CT in all species (100 % pine bark and 93 % in spruce bark), but birch contained in addition on average 14 % prodelfinidins. The average degree of polymerization, i. e. the size/chain length of the CT polymer, was 6. 7, 9. 0 and 5. 8 in pine, spruce and birch, respectively. - We tested methods for isolation and purification of bark CT. Extraction with ethanol and acetone were compared, and 70 % acetone gave the highest yield. - In selected bark samples, we tested their effect on egg hatching and motility inhibition in larvae of a parasitic nematode common in small ruminants (Teladorsagia circumcincta). Crude extract (water) and acetone extract was used. The results showed that both the crude and acetone extracts had an effect and reduced the egg hatching and impaired larvae motility.

We therefore genetically engineered a multi-allergen chimer and tested if mucosal treatment with this construct could represent {{a novel approach}} for prevention of birch pollen-related food allergy. BALB/c mice were poly-sensitized {{with a mixture of}} Bet v 1, Api g 1 and Dau c 1 followed by a sublingual challenge with carrot, celery and <b>birch</b> pollen <b>extracts.</b> For prevention of allergy sensitization an allergen chimer composed of immunodominant T cell epitopes of Api g 1 and Dau c 1 linked to the whole Bet v 1 allergen, was intranasally applied prior to sensitization. Intranasal pretreatment with the allergen chimer led to significantly decreased antigen-specific IgE-dependent β-hexosaminidase release, but enhanced allergen-specific IgG 2 a and IgA antibodies. Accordingly, IL- 4 levels in spleen cell cultures and IL- 5 levels in restimulated spleen and cervical lymph node cell cultures were markedly reduced, while IFN-γ levels were increased. Immunomodulation was associated with increased IL- 10, TGF-β and Foxp 3 mRNA levels in NALT and Foxp 3 in oral mucosal tissues. Treatment with anti-TGF-β, anti-IL 10 R or anti-CD 25 antibodies abrogated the suppression of allergic responses induced by the chimer. Our results indicate that mucosal application of the allergen chimer led to decreased Th 2 immune responses against Bet v 1 and its homologue food allergens Api g 1 and Dau c 1 by regulatory and Th 1 -biased immune responses. These data suggest that mucosal treatment with a multi-allergen vaccine could be a promising treatment strategy to prevent birch pollen-related food allergy...|$|R
