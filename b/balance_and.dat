5|$|The {{smallest}} region, the flocculonodular lobe, {{is often}} called the vestibulocerebellum. It is the oldest part in evolutionary terms (archicerebellum) and participates mainly in <b>balance</b> <b>and</b> spatial orientation; its primary connections are with the vestibular nuclei, although it also receives visual and other sensory input. Damage to this region causes disturbances of <b>balance</b> <b>and</b> gait.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{concept of}} <b>balancing</b> <b>and</b> cobalancing numbers is {{generalized}} to an arbitrary sequence; thereby sequence <b>balancing</b> numbers <b>and</b> sequence cobalancing numbers are introduced and defined. It is proved that {{there does not}} exist any sequence balancing number in the Fibonacci sequence and the only sequence cobalancing number in the Fibonacci sequence is F 2 = 1. Higher order <b>balancing</b> <b>and</b> cobalancing numbers are also introduced. A result on nonexistence of third order <b>balancing</b> <b>and</b> cobalancing numbers is also proved. A conjecture on the nonexistence of solutions of higher order <b>balancing</b> <b>and</b> cobalancing numbers is also stated at the end...|$|R

5|$|A second {{expansion}} {{pack for}} Age of Empires II HD was announced on April 9, 2015, and released on November 5. The African Kingdoms introduces four new civilizations: the Berbers, Ethiopians, Malians, and the Portuguese. It includes new maps, campaigns (Sundjata, Francisco de Almeida, Yodit, and Tariq ibn Ziyad), and units, a new game mode, and numerous <b>balance</b> <b>and</b> gameplay adjustments.|$|E

5|$|As {{with other}} forms of climbing, bouldering {{technique}} is largely centered on proper footwork. Leg muscles are significantly stronger than arm muscles; thus, proficient boulderers use their arms primarily to maintain <b>balance</b> <b>and</b> body positioning, relying on their legs to push them up the boulder. Boulderers also keep their arms straight whenever possible, allowing their bones to support their body weight rather than their muscles.|$|E
40|$|A {{different}} approach {{to the theory of}} balancing numbers is possible by means of a Pell’s equation which can be derived from the definition of balancing numbers. Each balancing number corresponds to a balancer, and each balancer, in turn, is a cobalancing number. Similarly, each cobalancing number corresponds to a cobalancer and interestingly, each cobalancer is a balancing number. The cobalancing numbers as well as their cobalancers are also solutions of a Diophantine equation similar to that satisfied by <b>balancing</b> numbers <b>and</b> their balancers. Some Diophantine equations exhibit beautiful solutions in terms of <b>balancing</b> <b>and</b> cobalancing numbers. The Lucas-balancing and Lucas-cobalancing numbers, obtained respectively as functions of <b>balancing</b> <b>and</b> cobalancing numbers, are useful in the computation of <b>balancing</b> <b>and</b> cobalancing numbers of higher order. Pell and associated Pell numbers are very closely associated with <b>balancing</b> <b>and</b> cobalancing numbers and appear in the factorization and as greatest common divisors of these numbers. The <b>balancing,</b> cobalancing <b>and</b> other related numbers are also expressible in terms of products of matrices...|$|R

5|$|Hearing {{and balance}} are both {{generated}} in the inner ear. The movement of liquids within the inner ear is generated by motion (for <b>balance)</b> <b>and</b> transmitted vibrations generated by the ossicles (for sound). This creates a nerve signal that passes through the vestibulocochlear nerve. From here, it passes through to the cochlear nuclei, the superior olivary nucleus, the medial geniculate nucleus, and finally the auditory radiation to the auditory cortex.|$|E
5|$|Ice sledge {{hockey is}} open only to male {{competitors}} with a physical disability {{in the lower}} part of their body. The game is played using international hockey rules with some modifications. Athletes sit on sledges with two blades that allow the puck to go beneath the sledge. They also use two sticks, which have a spike-end for pushing and a blade-end for shooting. The athletes are classified into three groups: group 1 is for athletes with no sitting balance or with major impairment in both upper and lower limbs, group 2 is for athletes with some sitting <b>balance</b> <b>and</b> moderate impairment in their extremities and athletes in group 3 have good <b>balance</b> <b>and</b> mild impairment in their upper and lower limbs.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, a Kickstarter {{campaign}} for OverClocked ReMix was funded at $153,633 {{for the creation}} of a multiple CD album of remixes of the music from Final Fantasy VI. Andrew Aversa directed the creation of the album, <b>Balance</b> <b>and</b> Ruin, which contains 74 tracks from 74 artists, each with its own unique style. The album is free and available at the OverClocked ReMix website.|$|E
30|$|In genome era, {{selection}} {{tests for}} recent positive selection were well developed as shown above. However, {{the test for}} the <b>balancing</b> <b>and</b> negative selection within species is rare. Although some approaches and softwares made efforts to test balancing selection (Excoffier et al., 2009; Excoffier and Lischer, 2010) and negative selection (Tajima, 1989; Yang, 1998), it could not meet the needs for GWWS, e.g. few <b>balancing</b> <b>and</b> purifying selection tests based on haplotypes. Signatures for <b>balancing</b> <b>and</b> negative selection should be interpreted and mined from large-scale genome data, which calls for diversifying methods in the future.|$|R

5|$|In the rideability test, {{the horse}} is {{evaluated}} {{by a member of}} the studbook evaluation committee by being ridden at a walk, trot and canter. The horse's movement, <b>balance</b> <b>and</b> disposition are evaluated and given 4 to 10 points. The horse should express cooperation, gentleness, attentiveness, sensitivity to cues, and active effort. This test is required for riding-type horses, and optional for pony-sized horses in lieu of the driveability test.|$|E
5|$|Like most arthropods, spiders lack <b>balance</b> <b>and</b> {{acceleration}} {{sensors and}} rely on their eyes to tell them which way is up. Arthropods' proprioceptors, sensors that report the force exerted by muscles {{and the degree of}} bending in the body and joints, are well understood. On the other hand, little is known about what other internal sensors spiders or other arthropods may have.|$|E

5|$|People of {{all ages}} with {{physical}} and mental disabilities obtain beneficial results from association with horses. Therapeutic riding is used to mentally and physically stimulate disabled persons and help them improve their lives through improved <b>balance</b> <b>and</b> coordination, increased self-confidence, and a greater feeling of freedom and independence. The benefits of equestrian activity {{for people with disabilities}} has also been recognized with the addition of equestrian events to the Paralympic Games and recognition of para-equestrian events by the International Federation for Equestrian Sports (FEI). Hippotherapy and therapeutic horseback riding are names for different physical, occupational, and speech therapy treatment strategies that utilize equine movement. In hippotherapy, a therapist uses the horse's movement to improve their patient's cognitive, coordination, <b>balance,</b> <b>and</b> fine motor skills, whereas therapeutic horseback riding uses specific riding skills.|$|E
5|$|The {{vestibulocochlear nerve}} (VIII) splits into the {{vestibular}} and cochlear nerve. The vestibular part {{is responsible for}} innervating the vestibules and semicircular canal of the inner ear; this structure transmits information about <b>balance,</b> <b>and</b> {{is an important component}} of the vestibuloocular reflex, which keeps the head stable and allows the eyes to track moving objects. The cochlear nerve transmits information from the cochlea, allowing sound to be heard.|$|E

5|$|A creative, hard-working, and {{technically}} gifted playmaker {{who played}} as an attacking midfielder, Gascoigne was capable both of scoring {{and setting up}} goals, due to his passing accuracy and his powerful striking ability. Gascoigne was gifted with pace, physical strength, <b>balance,</b> <b>and</b> excellent dribbling skills, which allowed him to protect the ball, beat opponents, and withstand physical challenges. Despite his talent, he was also criticised for his erratic behaviour and aggression on the pitch. His turbulent and often unhealthy lifestyle off the pitch, {{as well as his}} tendency to pick up injuries, is thought to have affected his career.|$|E
5|$|Another copy of {{the same}} book was put into auction on November 2016. It was {{auctioned}} for £ 368,750 on 12 December 2016. The book was auctioned by Sotheby in London. The book is a leather bound manuscript decorated with Rhodochrosite (A precious stone) and a silver skull. The copy does have a note by Rowling to Mr. Cunningham as follows “To Barry, the man who thought an overlong novel about a boy wizard in glasses might just sell … THANK YOU.” She has also added a note about the stone as “traditionally associated with love, <b>balance</b> <b>and</b> joy in daily life”.|$|E
5|$|Baleen whales have a {{relatively}} small brain compared to their body mass. Like other mammals, their brain has a large, folded cerebrum, {{the part of the}} brain responsible for memory and processing sensory information. Their cerebrum only makes up about 68% of their brain's weight, as opposed to human's 83%. The cerebellum, {{the part of the brain}} responsible for <b>balance</b> <b>and</b> coordination, makes up 18% of their brain's weight, compared to 10% in humans, which is probably due to the great degree of control necessary for constantly swimming. Necropsies on the brains of gray whales revealed iron oxide particles, which may allow them to find magnetic north like a compass.|$|E
