5|$|I said, 'Mr. Malcolm, {{could you}} tell me {{something}} about your mother?' And I will never, ever forget how he stopped almost as if he was suspended like a marionette. And he said, 'I remember the kind of dresses she used to wear. They were old and faded and gray.' And then he walked some more. And he said, 'I remember how she was always <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> stove, trying to stretch what little we had.' And that was the beginning, that night, of his walk. And he walked that floor until just about daybreak.|$|E
5|$|Kata is a {{term used}} to {{describe}} the posture and movement associated with taiko performance. The term is used in martial arts in a similar way: for example, both traditions include the idea that the hara is the center of being. Author Sean Bender argues that kata is the primary feature that distinguishes different taiko groups from one another, and is a key factor in judging the quality of performance. For this reason, many practice rooms intended for taiko contain mirrors to provide visual feedback to players. An important part of kata in taiko is keeping the body stabilized while performing, and can be accomplished by keeping a wide, low stance with the legs, with the left knee <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> toes and keeping the right leg straight. It is important that the hips face the drum and the shoulders are relaxed. Some teachers note a tendency to rely on the upper body while playing, and emphasize the importance of the holistic use of the body during performance.|$|E
25|$|Shipbuilders, {{probably}} Phoenician, a seafaring {{people who}} lived on the southern and eastern coasts of the Mediterranean, were the first to create the two-level galley that would be widely known under its Greek name, diērēs, or bireme. Even though the Phoenicians were among the most important naval civilizations in early Antiquity, little detailed evidence have been found concerning the types of ships they used. The best depictions found so far have been small, highly stylized images on seals which depict crescent-shape vessels equipped with one mast and banks of oars. Colorful frescoes on the Minoan settlement on Santorini (c. 1600 BC) show more detailed pictures of vessels with ceremonial tents on deck in a procession. Some of these are rowed, but others are paddled with men laboriously <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> railings. This has been interpreted as a possible ritual reenactment of more ancient types of vessels, alluding to a time before rowing was invented, but little is otherwise known about the use and design of Minoan ships.|$|E

500|$|Helvella queletii has {{a roughly}} similar form and appearance, but the ribbing in that species {{does not extend}} up the margin as does H.acetabulum. H.griseoalba has ribs that extend halfway {{up the sides of}} the fruit body, but the color of the cup is pale to dark gray rather than cream. The fruit bodies also {{resemble}} those of H.costifera, but the latter species is distinguished [...] by its grayish to grayish-brown hymenium; like H.acetabulum, it has ribs that extend to most of the outside of the fruit body. There are sometimes intermediate forms between the two species, making them difficult to distinguish. H.robusta is also similar to H.acetabulum, but has a lighter-colored hymenium, a robust stem, and the margin of the fruit body is often <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> stem at maturity. In contrast, H.acetabulum never has the edge of the fruit body <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> stem, and the stem is [...] "indistinct or prominent, but never robust".|$|E
500|$|A keen cyclist, in 2009 Everest {{collaborated with}} cyclewear brand Rapha {{to develop a}} bespoke suit that could be worn while cycling; what he called [...] "bespoke active wear". Priced at £3,500, the three-piece suit was made of blended wool, using {{nanotechnology}} to repel water and dirt. It combined the functionality of classic cycling clothing with the elegance of bespoke tailoring. Its features included a high button fastening to keep the jacket closely fitted to the body, a lapel pocket for an MP3 player and pleats at the shoulders and center back to allow extra fabric when the rider was <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> bicycle. The jacket design was incorporated into Rapha's ready-to-wear collection in 2010. In collaboration with bicycle saddle manufacturer Brooks England during 2010, he developed a cycling jacket; under Brooks' John Boultbee clothing label. The resulting 'Criterion Mk.1 cycling jacket', which used water and sweat-resistant materials, was shown at the Bread and Butter street and urban fashion fair, Berlin, in January 2011.|$|E
2500|$|To avoid snags and pulls, {{remove any}} jewelry that may {{catch in the}} fabric’s weave, and wear {{clothing}} free of large buckles or other objects which may snag the textile.

2500|$|<b>Bent</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> model, {{he viewed}} it from all angles, and in {{different}} kinds of lighting. [...] He asked for a seat. [...] He checked the proportions of the different buildings. [...] He asked {{about the details of}} the bridges. [...] He studied the model for a long time, apparently lost in thought. [...] While Geisler stayed in Berlin, Hitler accompanied him twice daily to view the model, in the afternoon and again during the night. [...] Others in his entourage were taken down to have his building plans explained to them as they pored over the model. Looking down on the model of a city which, he knew, would never be built, Hitler could fall in reverie, revisiting the fantasies of his youth, when he would dream with his friend Kubizek about rebuilding Linz.|$|E
2500|$|The {{individual}} {{plants of}} L. tasmanica are straggly shrubs or small trees to [...] high, though taller or longer trunked specimens are often <b>bent</b> <b>over.</b> <b>The</b> trunks over very old plants can reach diameters of 8 cm. The upper branchlets {{are covered in}} fine rusty fur. The stems may grow roots from nodes on the ground. The leaves are alternately arranged, and more crowded towards the ends of branches. Roughly oval in shape, they are [...] long and pinnate—made up of 11 to 25 primary lobes that have irregularly toothed margins and are sometimes subdivided into smaller lobes. The upper surface is green and shiny, while the undersurface is partly hairy, particularly along the midrib. Flowering takes place in February. The terminal flowerheads, or inflorescences, are [...] long.|$|E
2500|$|The {{production}} process {{is long and}} delicate. The maguey plant needs 12 years of maturation before the sap, or aguamiel, can be extracted, but a good plant can produce for up to one year. This aguamiel can be drunk straight, but it is alcoholic only after a fermentation process that can start in the plant itself. This liquid is collected twice a day from the plant, yielding {{about five or six}} liters per day. Today, this liquid is collected with a steel scoop, but in the past, an elongated gourd was used as a tube to suck the juice out. Between gatherings, the plant's leaves are <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> center where the juice collects to keep out bugs and dirt. This center is regularly scraped out to keep the plant's production of sap active. Most maguey plants produce this aguamiel for about four to six months before they finally die. Some plants can yield up to 600 L of pulque.|$|E
