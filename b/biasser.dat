40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} several {{methods that}} can be used to analyse gas turbines, based on an optimal estimation algorithm called the Kalman Filter. These techniques overcome the difficulties of more 'traditional' analysis methods, which can give misleading results because they do not explicitly consider the possibility of measurement error. An enhancement to the Kalman Filter (the 'Concentrator') is presented, which overcomes the Kalman Filter's tendency to 'smear' the effects of genuine changes in a small number of component changes and/or sensor <b>biasses</b> over the whole set of changes and <b>biasses</b> being considered. To complement this, methods of optimising some of the statistical inputs to the Kalman Filter in order to improve the ability of the 'Concentrator' to carry out the required analysis are discussed. These are based on analytical methods developed to determine the sensitivity of the Kalman Filter to its inputs. Techniques are also presented for determining the gas-path measurements in a gas turbine that are needed to enable the required analysis of component changes and/or sensor <b>biasses</b> to be performed, including determination of both possible measurement redundancy and the ability of a set of measurements to successfully differentiate between all the component changes and sensor <b>biasses</b> being sought. A recursive algorithm for time series analysis (the Smoothing/Trending Algorithm) is also presented. This produces, for each point in a time series, best estimates of the underlying levels and trends (rates of change of level) of the process generating the observations. A method of combining the 'Concentrator' and the Smoothing/Trending Algorithm is also presented, which reduces the effects of sensor noise on the analysis of component changes and sensor <b>biasses</b> from time series data. Many types of prime movers and process plant could be effectively analysed using the methods described in this thesis...|$|R

A comparison of modelling results with experimental measurements is presented. The fluid model reproduces some features of the L-H-like transition, but not the locally very high electric fields after bifurcation which are probably related to kinetic effects at very low collisionality.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{comparison}} of two methods for cosmological parameter inference from supernovae Ia lightcurves fitted with the SALT 2 technique. The standard chi-square methodology and the recently proposed Bayesian hierarchical method (BHM) are each applied to identical sets of simulations based on the 3 -year data release from the Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS 3), and also data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), the Low Redshift sample and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), assuming a concordance LCDM cosmology. For both methods, {{we find that the}} recovered values of the cosmological parameters, and the global nuisance parameters controlling the stretch and colour corrections to the supernovae lightcurves, suffer from small <b>biasses.</b> The magnitude of the <b>biasses</b> is similar in both cases, with the BHM yielding slightly more accurate results, in particular for cosmological parameters when applied to just the SNLS 3 single survey data sets. Most notably, in this case, the <b>biasses</b> in the recovered matter density Ω_ m, 0 are in opposite directions for the two methods. For any given realisation of the SNLS 3 -type data, this can result in a ∼ 2 σ discrepancy in the estimated value of Ω_ m, 0 between the two methods, which we find to be the case for real SNLS 3 data. As more higher and lower redshift SNIa samples are included, however, the cosmological parameter estimates of the two methods converge. Comment: 10 pages, 7 figures, submitted to MNRA...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} {{detailed}} palaeoclimate {{analysis of the}} Middle Miocene (uppermost Badenian-lowermost Sarmatian) Schrotzburg locality in S Germany, based on the fossil macro- and micro-flora, using four different methods for the estimation of palaeoclimate parameters: the coexistence approach (CA), leaf margin analysis (LMA), the Climate-Leaf Analysis Multivariate Program (CLAMP), {{as well as a}} recently developed multivariate leaf physiognomic approach based on an European calibration dataset (ELPA). Considering results of all methods used, the following palaeoclimate estimates seem to be most likely: mean annual temperature ~ 15 - 16 °C (MAT), coldest month mean temperature ~ 7 °C (CMMT), warmest month mean temperature between 25 and 26 °C, and mean annual precipiation ~ 1, 300 mm, although CMMT values may have been colder as indicated by the disappearance of the crocodile Diplocynodon and the temperature thresholds derived from modern alligators. For most palaeoclimatic parameters, estimates derived by CLAMP significantly differ from those derived by most other methods. With respect to the consistency of the results obtained by CA, LMA and ELPA, it is suggested that for the Schrotzburg locality CLAMP is probably less reliable than most other methods. A possible explanation may be attributed to the correlation between leaf physiognomy and climate as represented by the CLAMP calibration data set which is largely based on extant floras from N America and E Asia and which may be not suitable for application to the European Neogene. All physiognomic methods used here were affected by taphonomic <b>biasses.</b> Especially the number of taxa had a great influence on the reliability of the palaeoclimate estimates. Both multivariate leaf physiognomic approaches are less influenced by such <b>biasses</b> than the univariate LMA.

Electron transfer {{was found to be}} a thermal process, no photo-assistance being observed. A powerful electron acceptor, dichloro- dicyano p benzoquinone was used for a quantitative determination of the electron donor abilities of a number of pigments. The adsorption of electron acceptors from solution has been followed by ultra-violet absorption spectroscopy and ultra-violet and visible reflectance spectroscopy. Room temperature fluorescence of pigments and of compounds on pigments has been examined and compared with solution fluorescence. The photo-reduction of pigments in the presence of alcohols was studied and the formation of small quantities of photo-produced superoxide anion adsorbed on pigments has been confirmed. The photo-electric properties of pigments have been studied by use of a simple wet electrochemical cell containing a layer of pigment deposited on an inert substrate. Photo-voltages of a number of pigments have been measured and found to correlate well with their known durabilities in paint media; providing a rapid test for the estimation of pigment durabilities. The photo-voltages and equilibrium dark potentials are discussed in terms of the band model for titanium dioxide. Small photo-currents have been observed for pigments; anodic photo-currents flowing at positive <b>biassing</b> and small cathodic photo-currents at negative <b>biassing.</b> The initial photo-currents show a transient part which decays to leave a level photo-current.

In addition, helioseismological analysis has shown that the specific angular momentum at the top of the almost uniformly rotating radiative interior is approximately (although not exactly) the same as the spherically averaged value at the base of the (differentially rotating) convection zone, suggesting that angular momentum is being transported through the tachocline.

When the group is equipped with the Haar probability measure, these factors become independent random variables with explicit distributions. Beyond the known results on the orthogonal and unitary groups (O(n) and U(n)), we treat the symplectic case. In U(n), this induces a family of probability changes analogous to the <b>biassing</b> in the Ewens sampling formula known for the symmetric group.
