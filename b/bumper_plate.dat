40|$|In this paper, an {{engineering}} fragmentation model is presented {{for the case}} of hypervelocity impact of a spherical projectile on a thin <b>bumper</b> <b>plate</b> at normal incidence. The range of impact velocities covered is the solid fragmentation regime up {{to the limits of}} complete melting of projectile and target material. The model was developed for an axisymmetric fragment cloud by consideration of the conservation laws for mass, momentum, and energy, as well as making a few assumptions on the morphology of the cloud. The fragment cloud is modeled discretely, i. e. each particle of the fragment cloud is considered separately in the analytical calculation. The model consists of mainly analytical relationships and a few empirical fit functions, where no analytical formulation was available. The model distinguishes between fragments originating from the projectile and fragments originating from the <b>bumper</b> <b>plate.</b> The projectile fragments are split into the central fragment and spall fragments. An exponential distribution function is assumed for the mass distribution of the projectile's spall fragments. The fragments from the bumper are assumed to have a uniform mass. All fragments are assumed to be of spherical shape. The fragmentation model was applied and calibrated during experiments, in which Al spheres impact on thin Al plates. The calibration experiments, performed using a two-stage light gas gun, were in the range of impact velocities between 4. 8 and 6. 7 km/s. In this velocity range, the model was calibrated against residual velocities measured and fragment mass distribution, which was indirectly determined by measuring the crater depth distributions in rear walls...|$|E

The aluminum simulates a <b>bumper</b> <b>plate</b> for micrometeoroids. The ablation of a rock sphere by penetrating a stack of paper sheets is described, and an equation for losses near the surface of the sphere is derived. The expansions of aluminum plasma sphere with initial energies of 44. 45, 20. 8, and 7. 136 eV are investigated, including shock compression during penetration and adiabatic expansion. The equations of state were derived for aluminum and quartz, as well as one of the Mie-Grunesen type. A technique to determine momentum at the bottom surface of the thin plate, and the energy for hypervelocity separation of fragments of the aluminum plate are also considered...|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{propagation}} of hypervelocity impact fragment clouds in pressure gas. Fragment clouds were generated through perforation of thin aluminium bumper plates by spherical aluminium projectiles. A thick aluminium backwall plate, placed inside a pressure container at a given distance from the <b>bumper</b> <b>plate,</b> caught the fragments {{to act as a}} witness plate for the residual damage potential of the fragments. Crater depth statistics are presented as a function of container pressure. The fragment cloud was photographed by means of an image converter camera. The images showed a strong deformation of the fragment cloud for increased container pressures and were used to extract residual velocities until up to 50 mu s after impact. The deceleration of the velocity as a function of time after impact suggested an exponential decay function as the best fit to the curve. Thus, maximum fragment impact velocities on the backwall plate could be extrapolated from the axial cloud veloc it ites. The extrapolated cruves were compared with experimental time-of-flight measurements, and proved a good match. Fragment impact velocities and maximum crater depths were used to calculate maximum fragment particle sizes {{as a function of the}} container gas pressure...|$|E
40|$|The dual-wall Whipple shield is {{the shield}} {{of choice for}} lightweight, long-duration flight. The shield uses an initial {{sacrificial}} wall to initiate fragmentation and melt an impacting threat that expands over a void before hitting a subsequent shield wall of a critical component. The key parameters {{to this type of}} shield are the rear wall and its mass which stops the debris, as well as the minimum pressure generated under threat particle impact of the sacrificial wall and the amount of void that is available for expansion. Ensuring the minimum pressure is sufficiently high to achieve large scale fragmentation/melt of the threat particle enables the expansion of the threat and reduces the momentum flux of the debris on the rear wall. Three key factors in the minimum pressure achieved are the thickness of the sacrificial wall relative to the characteristic dimension of the impacting particle, the density and material cohesion contrast of the sacrificial wall relative to the threat particle and the impact speed. The mass of the rear wall and the sacrificial wall are desirable to minimize for launch costs and dynamic concerns making it important to have an understanding of the effects of density contrast and impact speed. In this paper a fourth key parameter is identified related to fragmentation, which corresponds to the ratio {{of the size of the}} projectile relative to the transition from brittle to ductile hole growth in the projectile. Ballistic limit equations have been developed to define the failure limits of a MMOD shield, generally in terms of projectile diameter (or mass), impact velocity, and angle. Within the range of impact velocities relevant for Earth-orbiting spacecraft, three distinct regions of penetration phenomenology have been identified for Whipple shields: center dot Low velocity: the projectile is eroded (and possibly deformed) during its passage through the <b>bumper</b> <b>plate,</b> but is not fragmented. Thus, perforation of the rear wall is by a fragment with a mass and speed equal to or less than the original impactor. center dot Intermediate (shatter) velocity: impact velocities are sufficient to induce projectile fragmentation upon impact with the <b>bumper</b> <b>plate,</b> resulting in a coarse debris cloud with large solid fragments. Increasing velocity within the shatter regime results in increased fragmentation, and eventually melting, of the projectile and bumper fragments, generating a finer and more evenly dispersed debris cloud. Failure of the rear wall is a complicated combination of modes observed at low- and hypervelocity. center dot Hypervelocity: the projectile and holed-out bumper material is completely, or nearly completely, melted and/or vaporized by the initial impact. The resultant debris cloud impacts over a dispersed area of the rear wall, loading it impulsively and inducing failure through rupture or petalling. While each of these regimes are well observed with extensive empirical methods to describe these regions, differences in impactor materials, configurations of shields and questions about the limitations of the attainable impact speeds have left questions that are difficult to answer from completely empirical methods...|$|E
40|$|The {{propagation}} of fragment clouds in a pressurized steel container with PMMA (polymehylmethacrylate) side-windows was investigated. The fragment clouds were generated by hypervelocity impact of aluminum projectiles on 1 mm thick AlMg 3 plates. Projectile diameters ranged from 2. 0 mm to 4. 4 mm. At impact velocities of around 7 km/s- 1, kinetic energies varied between 269 J and 2950 J. Container gas pressures were between 0. 1 bar and 10 bar N 2. The fragment cloud was photographed employing an {{image converter camera}} in a shadowgraph technique with a frame separation of 1 µs. By evaluation of the pictures, fragment cloud velocities were measured and shapes of the fragment clouds could be characterized {{as a function of}} projectile diameters and pressures. It has been found that at equal impact and target parameters the average fragment cloud velocity decreases linearly with increasing container pressrue. It has been observed that the deceleration of the fragment cloud in the gas is strongly d ependent on the <b>bumper</b> <b>plate</b> thickness to projectile diameter (t/d) ratio. The strongest effect of gas pressure on fragment cloud velocity and shape was observed for the smallest projectile of 2. 0 mm diameter. the fragment cloud velocities of projectiles with small t/d ratio depended weaker on container pressure. The shapes of the fragment clouds in most pressure container experiments can be divided into two distinct portions: an outer cone and a center part. This effect was observed weakly in the reference cloud shapes under near-vacuum conditons (i. e. 0. 1 bar) and was obviously magnified owing to the interaction with the pressure gas...|$|E

40|$|All {{orbiting}} spacecraft {{are susceptible}} to impacts by meteoroids and pieces of orbital space debris. These impacts occur at extremely high speeds and can damage flight-critical systems, which can in turn lead to catastrophic failure of the spacecraft. The design of a spacecraft for a long-duration mission into the meteoroid and space debris environment must include adequate protection against perforation of pressurized components by such impacts. This paper {{presents the results of}} an investigation into the perforation resistance of dual-wall structural systems fabricated with monolithic <b>bumper</b> <b>plates</b> and with corrugated <b>bumper</b> <b>plates</b> of equal weight. A comparative analysis of the impact damage in dual-wall systems with corrugated bumper specimens and that in dual-wall specimens with monolithic bumpers of similar weight is performed to determine {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} employing corrugated bumpers in structural wall systems for long-duration spacecraft. The analysis indicates that a significant increase in perforation protection can be achieved if a monolithic bumper is replaced by a corrugated bumper of equal weight. The parameters of the corrugations in the corrugated <b>bumper</b> <b>plates</b> are optimized in a manner that minimizes the potential for the creation of ricochet debris in the event of an oblique hypervelocity impact.

40|$|Metallic foams are a {{relatively}} new class of materials with low density and novel physical, mechanical, thermal, electrical and acoustic properties. Although incompletely characterized, they offer comparable mechanical performance to traditional spacecraft structural materials (i. e. honeycomb sandwich panels) without detrimental through-thickness channeling cells. There are two competing types of metallic foams: open cell and closed cell. Open cell foams are considered the more promising technology due to their lower weight and higher degree of homogeneity. Leading micrometeoroid and orbital debris shields (MMOD) incorporate thin plates separated by a void space (i. e. Whipple shield). Inclusion of intermediate fabric layers, or multiple <b>bumper</b> <b>plates</b> have led to significant performance enhancements, yet these shields require additional non-ballistic mass for installation (fasteners, supports, etc.) that can consume up to 35 % of the total shield weight [1]. Structural panels, such as open cell foam core sandwich panels, that are also capable of providing sufficient MMOD protection, represent a significant potential for increased efficiency in hypervelocity impact shielding from a systems perspective through a reduction in required non-ballistic mass. In this paper, {{the results of an}} extensive impact test program on aluminum foam core sandwich panels are reported. The effect of pore density, and core thickness on shielding performance have been evaluated over impact velocities ranging from 2. 2 - 9. 3 km/s at various angles. A number of additional tests on alternate sandwich panel configurations of comparable-weight have also been performed, including aluminum honeycomb sandwich panels (see Figure 1), Nomex honeycomb core sandwich panels, and 3 D aluminum honeycomb sandwich panels. A total of 70 hypervelocity impact tests are reported, from which an empirical ballistic limit equation (BLE) has been derived. The BLE is in the standard form suitable for implementation in risk analysis software, and includes the effect of panel thickness, core density, and facesheet material properties. A comparison between the shielding performance of foam core sandwich panel structures and common MMOD shielding configurations is made for both conservative (additional 35 % non-ballistic mass) and optimistic (additional mass equal to 30 % of bumper mass) considerations. Suggestions to improve the shielding performance of foam core sandwich panels are made, including the use of outer mesh layers, intermediate fabric/composite layers, and varying pore density...|$|R

40|$|This {{numerical}} study {{evaluates the}} concept of a combined mesh-plate bumper as a shielding system protecting unmanned spacecraft from small (1 [*]mm) orbital debris impacts. Two-component bumpers consisting of an external layer of woven mesh (aluminum or steel) directly applied to a surface of the aluminum plate are considered. Results of numerical modeling with a projectile velocity of 7 [*]km/s indicate that, in comparison to the steel mesh-combined bumper, the combination of aluminum mesh and aluminum plate provides better fragmentation of small hypervelocity projectiles. At the same time, none of the combined mesh/plate bumpers provide a significant increase of ballistic properties as compared to an aluminum <b>plate</b> <b>bumper.</b> This indicates that the positive results reported in the literature for bumpers with metallic meshes and large projectiles are not scalable down to millimeter-sized particles.

40|$|Fluid motion, smooth {{lines and}} clean forms are what I search for {{and attempt to}} attain when I {{incorporate}} different species of wood into my work. I take a very sculptural approach, integrating aesthetic designs and concepts into the building of everyday home furnishings. By designing pieces with a very simple, yet elegant, clean form, home furnishings are visually pleasing, as well as functional. Form and function can be placed {{at opposite ends of}} a spectrum of design. For example, on the left, an old milk crate topped with a sheet of plywood serves an entirely functional purpose - a table without pretensions. On the far right of the spectrum, an abstract painting serves only to exercise the mind and the eye - it is unable to give a functional contribution to everyday home life. The evolution of my work has begun slightly to the right of pure function; that is to say, towards the center of the spectrum. When I first began constructing furnishings, I was greatly influenced by my background in mechanical drawing and engineering. My designs were a reflection of mathematical, technical thought, coupled with a desire to produce a strong visual impact. Man With A Mission (PLATE I) is a clear illustration of this. Although the waves suggest fluidity, the rigid laminate composition and predictable function lean more towards the "left" of the spectrum. It begs {{to be used as a}} table. As I have become conceptually more open-minded, my work has become increasingly more sculptural. Byte The Beat (PLATE II), although a technically difficult design, outwardly portrays a continuum of monochromatic smooth flowing lines - a dramatic, visual piece. A purist may not want to disrupt its sculptural form by using it as a coffee table - its intended function. This work most clearly demonstrates my desire to have form take precedence over, but not replace, function. Pull Up To The <b>Bumper,</b> Baby (<b>PLATE</b> III) is my intentional attempt to abandon function entirely, and focus on form alone. A lazy J-shaped arc of glass is juxtaposed upon a graceful abstract base to compose a lyrical piece for the eye alone. In retrospect, although I have enjoyed experimenting with various combinations within the design spectrum, I feel my best, and most creative efforts are just to the "left" of pure form, where a visual impact presides over function. Thus, in the construction of each piece, conceptual design is the primary concern. I develop a broad-based idea of what the ultimate visual image of a piece will be, and then attack the technical challenge of construction secondarily. The building technique I enjoy utilizing is lamination. It affords me the ability to bend and shape wood into the flowing smooth lines I desire, and produces interesting, varied effects when different grains and species of wood are used together.
