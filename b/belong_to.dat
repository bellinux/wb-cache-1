5|$|The second {{approach}} {{to the problem of}} sets belonging to themselves took as its base the notion of class, and defines a set as a class which belongs to other classes, while a proper class is defined as a class which does not <b>belong</b> <b>to</b> other classes.

5|$|Both {{the title}} of the episode and the {{invocation}} spoken by the character of Sammael refer to four of the nine choirs of angels in Christian mythology.

Dominions, the fourth-highest choir, <b>belong</b> <b>to</b> the group appointed to deal with God's creations. Dominions lead the lower orders and impart wisdom to humanity.

5|$|The genus {{once served}} as a {{wastebasket}} taxon for many agaric mushrooms with a white spore print, gills attached to the stem, and an annulus. Due largely to differing interpretations on {{the limits of the}} genus, over 270 species and varieties have been placed in Armillaria or its synonym Armillariella. A comprehensive 1995 study by Tom Volk and Harold Burdsall evaluated all of the epithets that have been used in Armillaria or Armillariella. They determined that about 40 species <b>belong</b> <b>to</b> Armillaria sensu stricto (in the strict sense); the remaining names <b>belong</b> <b>to</b> species that are distributed among 43 other modern fungal genera.|$|E
