25|$|A {{microbial}} {{fuel cell}} (MFC), or <b>biological</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>cell,</b> is a bio-electrochemical system that drives an electric current by using bacteria and mimicking bacterial interactions found in nature. MFCs can be grouped into two general categories: mediated and unmediated. The first MFCs, demonstrated in the early 20th century, used a mediator: a chemical that transfers electrons from the bacteria in the cell to the anode. Unmediated MFCs emerged in the 1970s; {{in this type of}} MFC the bacteria typically have electrochemically active redox proteins such as cytochromes on their outer membrane that can transfer electrons directly to the anode. In the 21st century MFCs started to find a commercial use in wastewater treatment.|$|E

40|$|Microbial {{fuel cells}} are bioelectrochemical devices where, on the anode, {{microorganisms}} oxidize complex carbon sources {{and reduce the}} electrode via complex mechanisms of extra-cellular electron transfer (EET). To date, Geobacter sulfurreducens {{has been identified as}} producing not only the largest current density but also large population density biofilms, of the known model organisms commonly used within the field. Another common model organism associated with microbial fuel cells is Shewanella oneidensis, containing multiple EET mechanisms and an apparent inability to form multi-layered biofilms in anaerobic culturing, i. e. microbial fuel cell operating conditions. In contrast to G. sulfurreducens, S. oneidensis biofilm formation appears to coincide with oxygen metabolism, with removal of such, prompting biomass detachment. In this study, to overcome obstacles in biofilm formation a method was employed to encapsulate biomass onto the surface of an electrode. This method used the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of the silica precursor, tetramethyl orthosilicate (TMOS), causing SiO 2 to form a porous thin film effectively binding the culture to the electrode surface and acting as an artificial exopolysaccharide (EPS) biofilm binder. As a demonstration of proof, this methodology was applied to novel biocompatible electrode materials (PHBV-CF) and combined with a laccase catalyzed oxygen reduction cathode in a hybrid <b>biological</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>cell.</b> In comparison to the encapsulated anodes, additional experiments were performed to optimize the growth conditions at which S. oneidensis will naturally form biofilms on PHBV-CF. Observations indicated initial biofilm formation occurred at the onset of stationary phase growth in mirco-aerobic and anaerobic cultures, indicating a biofilm response to carbon substrate limitation. This observation was explored further and led to results indicating the importance of intra-cellular carbon fluxes and the subsequent metabolic response of riboflavin production by S. oneidensis. It was also observed that riboflavin production occurred in micro-aerobic and anaerobic environments at the onset of carbon limitation but no riboflavin was detectable in anaerobic cultures. As riboflavin has been indicated in many studies as one primary mechanism employed in EET via mediated electron transfer (MET; results herein contradict the idea of riboflavin MET {{due to the lack of}} carbon required to produce riboflavin, with carbon being essential to drive metabolic reduction of the electrode. Therefore, the hypotheses within this study explores the idea of riboflavin acting as an electrochemical signal, leading S. oneidensis cells to populate and form a biofilm on the surface of an electrode as the culture transitions from aerobic to anaerobic metabolism. To test this, S. oneidensis cells in anaerobic media were exposed to electrodes with externally applied potentials (- 0. 4, - 0. 3, + 0. 1 and open circuit vs Ag/AgCl). Results indicated only the electrode with an applied potential of - 0. 3 V (corresponding to accumulation of oxidized riboflavin on the surface) retained biomass in the form of a biofilm. Furthermore, this biofilm exhibited a nonreversible oxidation species centered at + 0. 2 V vs Ag/AgCl, which was identified as outer membrane cytochromes. This novel culturing method provides for the first time, anaerobically formed biofilms of S. oneidensis engaged in direct electron transfer (DET) of the anode. Based on this methodology, S. oneidensis based anodes were made with current densities comparable to those reported within the literature for G. sulfurreducens.

Considering that blood contains glucose, the EFC devices development can be developed through the preparation of a glucose-oxidized (GOx) based bioanode, immobilized on an electrode surface. Conclusion. During our research we developed an Enzimatic <b>Fuel</b> <b>Cell</b> prototype and we evaluated its ability to harvest energy from the blood and the saliva inside the risk-infectious medical waste and to employ it in order one day to help the energy requirements of a consulting room. This device is based on GOx as biocatalyst and either Nafion or low cost membranes based on polyaromatic polymers were used as polymer electrolytes. Moreover, we also have explored the performance of single chamber configuration, which directly eliminates the use of membranes, to assess the applicability of EFCs for dentistry waste management...|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} redox enzymes {{function}} as excellent electrocatalysts when attached to electrodes or conductor/semi-conductor surfaces. A particular {{focus of this}} review is on hydrogenases, enzymes which use a di-iron or nickel-iron center to interconvert 2 H+ and H 2 at extremely high turnover frequencies, although the concepts we highlight apply to {{a wider range of}} redox enzymes. Taking hydrogenases as our main case study, we examine how a detailed electrochemical understanding of the electrocatalytic behaviour of an enzyme can inform the development of devices in which the enzyme exchanges electrons directly with a range of inorganic materials, including graphite electrodes and particles, semi-conductor electrodes and quantum dots. We review recent developments in composite enzyme-inorganic catalysts, some of the biological and materials challenges in building devices based on enzymes, and the future opportunities for devices based on <b>biological</b> catalysts, including <b>fuel</b> <b>cells,</b> light-driven <b>fuel</b> production and coupled catalysis for chemical synthesis. © 2014 Sociedade Brasileira de Quimica...|$|R

[...] In principle, a {{hydrogen}} <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> functions like a battery, producing electricity, which can run an electric motor. Instead of requiring recharging, however, the <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> can be refilled with hydrogen.

Alkaline <b>fuel</b> <b>cells,</b> {{one of the oldest}} type of <b>fuel</b> <b>cell,</b> operate between ambient temperature and 90 °C with an electrical efficiency higher than the other <b>fuel</b> <b>cells</b> such as proton exchange membrane <b>fuel</b> <b>cells</b> (PEMFC), solid oxide <b>fuel</b> <b>cells</b> and phosphoric acid <b>fuel</b> <b>cells.</b> Alkaline {{anion exchange}} membrane <b>fuel</b> <b>cells</b> (AAEMFCs) are functionally similar to AFCs, the difference being AAEMFCs employ a solid polymer electrolyte while AFCs use aqueous potassium hydroxide (KOH) as an electrolyte.|$|R
