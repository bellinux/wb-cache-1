50|$|His Circus <b>Boss,</b> <b>Cap</b> Carson (Lloyd Nolan), {{is against}} taking the show across the Atlantic. He {{maintains}} that Europe is bad luck for American circuses. He also calls Matt on his reason {{for making a}} European tour: Masters wants to find the lost great love of his life, Lili Alfredo (Rita Hayworth), and figures that this tour will smoke her out {{if for no other}} reason than to see her child, Toni Alfredo (Claudia Cardinale), Masters' adopted daughter. One of his Western stars and wannabe-partner, Steve McCabe (John Smith), also attempts to dissuade Masters, but to no avail. Masters buys a freighter, renames her the Circus Maximus, and the show sails for Europe.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, Jack {{meets with}} Cap Folsom (Monte Blue), {{the leader of}} the cattle rustlers and Jack's former <b>boss.</b> <b>Cap</b> is also the man who murdered Ben's partner and framed him for the crime. Jack {{complains}} about the timing of the recent raid, but Folsom dismisses him, saying he can never turn his back on his outlaw past. At the ranch, Ben is tasked with working with the dogs on the ranch, and soon he uses his position to guard the cattle. One afternoon, Ben meets his daughter on the range and they talk about her future. Concerned that she may end up with a lout like Jack, he tells her that she will need to decide between Jack and Wils. Soon after, Ben is alerted by his barking dogs to rustlers in the area, and dressed in black as Pecos Bill, he rides after them. The rustlers recognize the approaching outlaw and take cover. During the ensuing gunfight, Wils arrives with his trustworthy men, sees Pecos Bill, and chases after him instead of the rustlers.|$|E
40|$|Economic {{pressures}} and regulatory requirements have {{brought about a}} great interest in improving ship propulsion efficiency. This can be exercised by installing Energy Saving Devices (ESD) such as Propeller <b>Boss</b> <b>Cap</b> Fins (PBCF). This paper demonstrates an approach for optimising PBCF by using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis. The conducted CFD open water model tests were validated by comparison with experimental data until the simulation was deemed satisfactory within the capabilities and limitations of the model. A design and optimisation procedure was defined to analyse the impact of ESDs on propeller efficiency and then used to evaluate the different geometric parameters and locations of the PBCF on the hub. This analysis was done at full scale using high fidelity CFD - based RANS methods. Outcomes of the study include a design and optimisation process {{that can be used for}} the analysis of other ESDs on the market. The influences of varying the geometry of the PBCF were examined with optimal solutions presented for the analysis case. The impact on the regulated Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) and ESD savings were then discussed along with the influences on the energy efficiency...|$|E
50|$|The {{interior}} is entered through double wooden doors {{that appear to}} be original to the building, set within a lancet arch. The interior walls are plastered brick; the floors are heart pine, covered with carpet. The ceiling is wood paneled, with the exposed structural oak timbers forming an arched pattern. The apse is a semi-octagonal projection with three large figural lancet windows that retain their original stained and painted glass. The apse ceiling is a ribbed segmental arch vault. The ribs are decorated and feature plaster <b>boss</b> <b>caps</b> at their apex.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the simulated and experimental results of propeller-rudder systems with propeller <b>boss</b> <b>cap</b> fins (PBCFs) and analyzes the hydrodynamic performance of PBCFs in propeller-rudder systems. The {{purpose is to}} study the impact of PBCFs on the hydrodynamic performance of rudders. Hydrodynamic experiments were carried out on propeller-rudder systems with PBCFs in a cavitation tunnel. The experimental energy-saving effect of the PBCF without a rudder was 1. 47 % at the design advance coefficient J[*]=[*] 0. 8. The numerical simulation {{was based on the}} Navier–Stokes equations solved with a sliding mesh and the SST (Shear Stress Transfer) k-ω turbulence model. After the grid independence analysis, the flow fields of an open-water propeller with and without a PBCF were compared, then the efficiencies of the propulsion systems including different rudders and the thrust coefficient Kr of rudders were analyzed. The results indicate that the installation of a PBCF increases the resistance of the rudder, which results in a reduction in the energy-saving effect of the PBCF. At the design advance coefficient, the energy-saving effect of the PBCF with an ordinary rudder and a twisted rudder decreases from 1. 47 % to 1. 08 % and 1. 16 %, respectively; thus, it is important to factor in the rudder of a propulsion system when evaluating the energy-saving effects of PBCFs...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACTThe global {{price of}} oil, {{which is both}} finite and limited in quantity, has been rising {{steadily}} because of the increasing requirements for energy in both developing and developed countries. Furthermore, regulations have been strengthened across all industries to address global warming. Many studies of hull resistance, propulsion and operation of ships have been performed {{to reduce fuel consumption}} and emissions. This study examined the design parameters of the propeller <b>boss</b> <b>cap</b> fin (PBCF) and hub cap for 6, 000 TEU container ships to improve the propulsion efficiency. The design parameters of PBCF have been selected based on the geometrical shape. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis with a propeller open water (POW) test was performed to check the validity of CFD analysis. The design of experiment (DOE) case was selected as a full factorial design, and the experiment was analyzed by POW and CFD analysis. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to determine the correlation among design parameters. Four design alternatives of PBCF were selected from the DOE. The shape of a propeller hub cap was selected as a divergent shape, and the divergent angle was determined by the DOE. Four design alternatives of PBCF were attached to the divergent hub cap, and the POW was estimated by CFD. As a result, the divergent hub cap with PBCF has a negative effect on the POW, which is induced by an increase in torque coefficient. A POW test and cavitation test were performed with a divergent hub cap with PBCF to verify the CFD result. The POW test result showed that the open water efficiency was increased approximately 2 % with a divergent hub cap compared to a normal cap. The POW test result was similar to the CFD result, and the divergent hub cap with the PBCF models showed lower open water efficiency. This was attributed to an increase in the torque coefficient just like the CFD results. A cavitation test was performed using the 2 models selected. The test result showed that the hub vortex is increased downstream of the propeller...|$|E
50|$|The cap is 3 - 7.5 cm {{wide and}} white with a pale yellow tinge, and more yellow or ochre in the centre as the fruit body ages.

50|$|The {{company and}} its CEO Mike Miller became most famous by leading the effort on the Kuwait Fires Project after the 1991 Gulf War. Safety <b>Boss</b> doused and <b>capped</b> 180 out of the 600 fires, {{more than any other}} company in Kuwait. SafetyBOSS set the rapid pace that had to be {{followed}} by the remaining companies in Kuwait. As a result, the fires were out within nine months, instead of the many years' estimate by competitor companies.|$|R
50|$|The cap is 1-4 cm (0.4-2.6 in) in {{diameter}} and white or cream-coloured with a silky texture, at first conical before flattening out to a more convex shape with a pronounced umbo (<b>boss).</b> The <b>cap</b> margins may split with age. The thin stipe is 1-6 cm (0.4-2.4 in) high and 0.3-0.6 cm thick and lacks a ring. It has a small bulb at the base, and often does not grow straight. The crowded gills are adnexed and cream early, before darkening to a brownish colour with the developing spores. The spore print is brown. The almond-shaped spores are smooth and measure around 9 × 5 μm. The faint smell has been likened to meal, damp earth, or even described as spermatic. The white or cream flesh has an acrid taste and does not change colour when cut or bruised.|$|R
50|$|The cap {{is up to}} 10 cm broad, {{initially}} convex with strongly incurved margins before flattening {{out with}} age. The centre of the cap may have a central <b>boss.</b> The <b>cap</b> colour is deep violet {{at first and then}} becomes violet-brown with age, glutinous, and smooth. The flesh is thick and tinted lavender. The gills are brown and tinted lilac-violet. The stipe is 6 to 8 cm long, cylindrical, often swollen at the base, pale lilac above the cortina and deep violet below it. The spores are brown and fruit bodies will produce a brown spore print. The species has no odor, and a mild taste. When C. archeri is young, they have a cortina, but it is flimsy and tears apart as the cap expands which is why there are few traces of it on fully mature specimens.|$|R
50|$|The fruitbodies of this fungus have {{hemispherical}} to convex brick- to brown-red caps, with diameters up to 5 cm {{and covered}} with a layer of slime. The cap centre may be depressed or raised (umbonate) with a <b>boss.</b> The <b>cap</b> margins are curved inwards and smooth. The gills on the cap underside have a subdecurrent attachment to the stipe. Initially light tan or clay-coloured, they deepen to rusty brown as the spores mature. The cinnabar red stipe is cylindrical to slightly bulbous, up to 4.5 cm in height and 1 cm in width. Its lower part, below the remnants of the veil, are covered in slime. The flesh is white. The mushroom has no particular taste or smell, and stains red-purple when potassium hydroxide is applied to it. The spore print is rust-brown, and the oval warty spores measure 8-10 by 5-7 µm.|$|R
