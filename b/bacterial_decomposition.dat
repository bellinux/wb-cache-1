The Schwann cells formed columns along the silk fibers in {{a short amount of}} time, and the columns were similar to bands of Bungner that grow in vivo after PNS injury. Spider silk has not been used in tissue {{engineering}} until now because of the predatory nature of spiders and the low yield of silk from individual spiders. It has been discovered that the species Nephila clavipes produces silk that is less immunogenic than silkworm silk; it has a tensile strength of 4 x 109 N/m, which is six times the breaking strength of steel. Because spider silk is proteolytically degraded, there is not a shift in pH from the physiological pH during degradation. Other advantages of spider silk include its resistance to fungal and <b>bacterial</b> <b>decomposition</b> for weeks {{and the fact that it}} does not swell. Also, the silk's structure promotes cell adhesion and migration. However, silk harvest is still a tedious task and the exact composition varies among species and even among individuals of the same species depending on diet and environment. There have been attempts to synthetically manufacture spider silk. Further studies are needed to test the feasibility of using a spider silk nerve conduit in vitro and in vivo.|$|E

Results from analytical studies indicated continuous discharge of organic micropollutants to the surface water with a calculated load amounting to 1. 51 kg day- 1. Metoprolol, carbamazepine and naproxen were chosen for testing different removal methods. Oxygen Uptake Rate (OUR) tests were conducted to assess the bacterial activity of an activated sludge taken from a full scale aeration plant with the presence of selected target compounds. A semi-technical scale membrane bioreactor ZeeWeed 10 ™, treating final effluent from the Himmerfjärden WWTP (Sweden) was seeded with activated sludge from full scale biological stage. The membrane bioreactor (MBR) system placed after the final treatment appeared to be an insufficient technology for removal of residual amounts of organic micropollutants from WWTP effluents. Batch test studies with activated sludge taken from the membrane bioreactor and with application of granular activated carbon (GAC) filtration resulted in giving an overall assessment of removal efficiency.

The experiment used a two-way factorial design with four levels of bacterial diversity (one to four species) and the absence/presence of a bacterivorous ciliated protist Tetrahymena pyriformis as two main factors, and all possible combinations of the four bacterial taxa nested within each diversity level. Bacterial community biovolume increased as bacterial diversity increased, a result due largely to positive selection effects. Decomposition and consumer abundance, however, were unaffected by bacterial diversity, though both varied among bacterial composition treatments. Negative selection effects, the dominance of species that do not contribute significantly to ecosystem functioning, accounted {{for the lack of}} diversity effects on decomposition and consumer abundance. The presence of Tetrahymena reduced bacterial community biovolume but increased decomposition, without altering the diversity–functioning relationships. Decomposition was strongly linked with consumer abundance such that communities supporting larger consumer biomass exhibited higher decomposition rates. This study suggests that if the negative selection effect is common, as it might be when examining ecosystem variables other than biomass (due to the presence of keystone species that can contribute disproportionably to ecosystem functioning relative to their abundances), basic bacteria-mediated ecosystem processes, such as decomposition and energy transfer to the next trophic level, may not increase with bacterial diversity...|$|R

We tested the effect of site features and soil management on nematode diversity, soil properties and soil food webs. Site features included use, position, orientation, radiation, slope, altitude and regional scale. Soil management included tillage and herbicide use.

Results were compared to those obtained after exposure to Cu 2 +. The exposure to nano CuO (≤ 500 ppm, 4 levels) and Cu 2 + (≤ 30 ppm, 4 levels) significantly reduced leaf <b>decomposition,</b> <b>bacterial</b> and fungal biomass, fungal reproduction and diversity. Cluster analysis of DGGE based on DNA fingerprints showed that both forms of copper induced shifts in community structure. However, impacts were stronger for bacteria than fungi. At the cellular level, increased nano CuO concentrations (≤ 200 ppm, 5 levels) induced activity of laccase by single fungal populations. Fungal populations from non-polluted streams were more affected by nano CuO than those from polluted streams, as shown by stronger inhibition of biomass production, accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), plasma membrane disruption and DNA strand breaks.

50|$|One {{reason for}} the low {{nutrient}} conditions is that streams and rivers do not flow into these forests (if they did, nutrient rich freshwater swamps would result), water only flows out of them, so the only input of nutrients is from rainfall, marine aerosols and dust. In order {{to cope with the}} lack of nutrients, the plants invest heavily in defences against herbivores such as chemical (toxic secondary compounds) and physical defences (tough leathery leaves, spines and thorns). It is these defences that prevent the leaves from decaying and so they build up as peat. Although the cellular contents quickly leach out of the leaves when they fall, the physical structure is resistant to both <b>bacterial</b> and fungal <b>decomposition</b> and so remains intact, slowly breaking down to form peat (Yule and Gomez 2008). This is {{in stark contrast to the}} lowland dipterocarp forests where leaf decomposition is extremely rapid, resulting in very fast nutrient cycling on the forest floor. If non-endemic leaf species are placed in the peat swamp forests, they break down quite quickly, but even after one year submerged in the swamp, endemic species remain virtually unchanged (Yule and Gomez 2008). The only nutrients available for the trees are thus the ones that leach from the leaves when they fall, and these nutrients are rapidly absorbed by the thick root mat. It was previously assumed that the low pH and anaerobic conditions of the tropical peat swamps meant that bacteria and fungi could not survive, but recent studies have shown diverse and abundant communities (albeit not nearly as diverse as dry land tropical rainforests, or freshwater swamps) (Voglmayr and Yule 2006; Jackson, Liew and Yule 2008).|$|R

In the following dissertation, I compare {{the ability of}} organic amendments to alter above- and belowground biological community structure and function to promote prairie establishment on Castle Drive Landfill in Garland, Dallas County, Texas. Treatments included altering the location of organic amendments in the soil profile, either applied to surface or incorporated, and varying the amount applied. Plant community composition, grass population dynamics, soil nutrient conditions, and soil biological parameters were monitored for three growing seasons. Aboveground, the surface treatments were superior {{for the establishment of}} desired and undesired plant species. Plant density patterns {{can be attributed to the}} amelioration of physical conditions and the accidental burial of seed during incorporation. Grass population dynamics suggest that surface-amended plots supported establishment, but high-volume incorporated treatments were better for enhancing survival through seasonal and long-term drought. Belowground biological responses were affected by the plant community, and not by the amendment treatments. Soil microbial biomass and carbon mineralization potential were larger in those treatments with greater plant density. The structure of the nematode community suggests that decomposition in the surface-amended plots was directed through <b>bacterial</b> channels while <b>decomposition</b> in the incorporated plots was through fungal channels. It is likely that the higher rates of plant productivity in surface treatments stimulated root exudation, thereby favoring bacteria and the nematodes that feed on them. Treatment differences in decomposition pathway were attenuated after 17 months. The soil quality indicators, Cmic/Corg, qCO 2, nematode family richness and nematode density, were not affected by the restoration treatments or plant density, but did increase over time. The results of this study suggest that restoration managers should direct their energies into establishing and promoting a high-quality plant community.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} presents four microbial microcosm-based {{experimental studies}} addressing {{questions related to}} the causes and consequences of biodiversity. All four studies adopted an approach that integrates ecology and evolutionary biology. Two studies explored the utility of knowledge on species phylogenetic relationships for understanding community assembly (chapter 1) and invasibility (chapter 3). The other two studies investigated the impacts of important ecological factors, including competition (chapter 2) and temporal niches (chapter 4), on adaptive radiation, using the rapidly diversifying bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW 25 as the model organism. The first study, described in Chapter 1, examined how phylogenetic relatedness between competing species affected the strength of priority effects and ecosystem functioning during community assembly. Strong priority effects emerged only when competing bacterial species were phylogenetically most closely related, resulting in multiple community states associated with different assembly histories. In addition, the phylogenetic diversity of bacterial communities effectively predicted <b>bacterial</b> production and <b>decomposition.</b> The second study, described in Chapter 2, explored the role of competition in the adaptive radiation of P. fluorescens. The adaptive radiation was generally suppressed by competition, but its effect was strongly modulated by the phylogenetic relatedness between the diversifying and competing species and their immigration history. The inhibitive effect of competition on adaptive radiation was strongest when phylogenetic relatedness was high and when competitors were introduced earlier. The third study, described in Chapter 3, evaluated {{the relative importance of}} phylogenetic relatedness between resident and invading species and phylogenetic diversity of resident communities for invasibility. Laboratory bacterial communities containing a constant number of resident species with varying phylogenetic diversity and relatedness to invaders were challenged by nonresident bacterial species. Whereas invader abundance decreased as phylogenetic relatedness increased as predicted by Darwin's naturalization hypothesis, it was unaffected by phylogenetic diversity. The final study, described in Chapter 4, presented the first experimental demonstration of the maintenance of biodiversity that emerged from adaptive radiation in the presence of temporal niches. Only when provided with temporal niche opportunities were multiple derived phenotypes of P. fluorescens able to coexist as a result of negative frequency-dependent selection. When temporal niche was absent, the specialized phenotypes either did not emerge or were predominated by one superior phenotype. Ph. D...|$|R
40|$|Description of the subject. The {{present study}} {{concerns}} {{the relationships among}} leaf litter decomposition, substrate quality, ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) community composition and nitrogen (N) availability. Decomposition of organic matter affects the biogeochemical cycling of carbon (C) and N. Since {{the composition of the}} soil microbial community can alter the physiological capacity of the community, it is timely to study the litter quality effect on N dynamic in ecosystems. Objectives. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the influence of leaf litter decomposition on N mineralization. The specific objectives of this study were to evaluate the influence of the litter biochemistry of five plants species (Faidherbia albida A. Chev., Azadirachta indica A. Juss., Casuarina equisetifolia L., Andropogon gayanus Kunth and Eragrostis tremula Hochst. ex Steud.) on N mineralization in a tropical ferrous soil (Lixisol), nitrification, and genetic diversity of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of amplified fragments of genes coding for 16 S rRNA was used to study the development of <b>bacterial</b> communities during <b>decomposition</b> of leaf litter in soils. Method. Community structure of AOB was determined at two time periods: day 0 and day 140. Ten strains were tested and each of these strains produced a single band. Thus, DGGE DNA band patterns were used to estimate bacterial diversity. Plant secondary compounds such as polyphenols are purported to influence nutrient cycling by affecting organic matter degradation, mineralization rates, N availability and humus formation. In a laboratory study, we investigated the influence of six phenolic acids (ferulic, gallic, vanillic, syringic, p-coumaric and p-HBA acids) commonly found in the plant residues on N mineralization and NH 4 + and NO 3 - production in soils. Results. The results showed that litter type did affect soil nitrification. Faidherbia albida litter was associated with increased inorganic N in soil after 140 days of incubation while A. gayanus and C. equisetifolia litter immobilized N. Azadirachta indica and E. tremula amendments had no significant effects in N mineralization. The results show that the addition of six phenolic acids significantly reduced NH 4 + and NO 3 - compared to the control soil but had no significant effect on N mineralization. For the community of ammonium-oxidizing bacteria, a litter quality effect was noted, but the incubation time effect was more pronounced, except for C. equisetifolia litter. Conclusions.

In particular, the study assessed whether Rhizon samplers, centrifugation, high pressure squeezing and soil suspensions in simulated pore water can be viable approaches for obtaining representative samples of equilibrated soil pore water. Results for metal solubility and speciation were interpreted {{in terms of both}} soil morphological effects on trace metal dynamics and artefacts introduced at various stages during sample preparation and handling. The main soil used in the study was an organic-rich sandy silt from a site which has served as a sewage re-processing facility for almost a century. This soil was chosen because of its importance as a long-term repository for metal-enriched sludge applied to arable land, providing a suitable medium on which to study trace metal behaviour. Pore waters were extracted and analysed for major and trace cations and anions, pH, Dissolved Inorganic Carbon (DIC) and Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC) at two different temperatures (5 degrees Celsius and 15 degrees Celsius), in order to evaluate the extent of <b>bacterial</b> activity, organic <b>decomposition</b> and their consequences on solute composition, during pore water extractions. Speciation was estimated from analysis of pore water chemistry using two software packages (PHREEQCi and WHAM-VI). Pore waters showed different ranges of concentration between the various methods. Different mechanisms and/or chemical reactions were involved during the different extractions; a range of processes was identified, mainly dominated by metal complexation by humus acids and redox reactions. Results revealed that the soil studied was able to partially buffer the free ion activities of the metal ions in pore water with increasing dilutions, but demonstrated virtually no ability to buffer DOC. Identification of the source (i. e. location of pore space) of water extracted was also investigated using water with different isotopic composition (18 O/ 16 O). Evidence showed that centrifugation was not able to differentiate between more and less mobile water at FC conditions, rather enhancing the mixing between the two pools of water (native and labelled) by and apparent process of 'infusion'. By contrast, Rhizon samplers appeared to sample water preferentially from the more accessible pool (extra-aggregate), which proved to have a composition showing incomplete mixing with the native water. The results also suggested that mixing of the two pools was rather fast and that was almost completely attained prior to pore water extraction. The study established that the most important factors affecting pore water chemistry during extraction are the conditions to which the samples are exposed during the extraction process. For these reasons Rhizon samplers should be used as a disposable device, and are only applicable for use in high soil moisture soil contents. In contrast, they present no 'side-effects' (providing enough equilibration time) if M 2 + (free ion activity) were needed as opposed to Msol (total metal concentration in pore water), as often required in environmental studies. Centrifugation is optimal for bulk solution studies, or when homogenisation represents a key experimental point; targeted studies are also possible. Soil squeezing is subject to severe limitations in the case of prolonged extractions of biologically active soils, due to the effects of anaerobism. Squeezing should only be used for 'fast' extractions of soils. Finally, batch extractions are well suited to studies on M 2 + equilibria, but more studies are needed to clarify the effect of soil: solution ratio on metal and DOC solubility.

50|$|One {{variation}} of the mediator-less MFC is the microbial electrolysis cell (MEC). While MFCs produce electric current by the <b>bacterial</b> <b>decomposition</b> of organic compounds in water, MECs partially reverse the process to generate hydrogen or methane by applying a voltage to bacteria. This supplements the voltage generated by the microbial decomposition of organics, leading to the electrolysis of water or methane production. A complete reversal of the MFC principle is found in microbial electrosynthesis, in which carbon dioxide is reduced by bacteria using an external electric current to form multi-carbon organic compounds.|$|E

When upon death the ammonites fell to this seafloor and were gradually buried in accumulating sediment, <b>bacterial</b> <b>decomposition</b> of these corpses often tipped the delicate balance of local redox conditions sufficiently to lower the local solubility of minerals dissolved in the seawater, notably phosphates and carbonates.
