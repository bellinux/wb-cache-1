The leopard is now rare and the Asiatic cheetah extinct. The Pirrang (large tiger cat or fishing cat) of the eastern desert region is also disappearing. Deer occur in the lower rocky plains and in the eastern region, as do the striped hyena (charakh), jackal, fox, porcupine, common gray {{mongoose}} and hedgehog. The Sindhi phekari, red lynx or Caracal cat, is found in some areas. Phartho (hog deer) and wild bear occur particularly in the central inundation belt. There are bats, lizards and reptiles, including the cobra, lundi (viper) and the mysterious Sindh krait of the Thar region, which is supposed to suck the victim's breath in his sleep.Some unusual sightings of Asian cheetah occurred in 2003 near the Balochistan border in Kirthar Mountains. The rare houbara bustard find Sindh's warm climate suitable to rest and mate. Unfortunately, it is hunted by locals and foreigners.

40|$|A {{decade of}} visual and {{acoustic}} detections of marine megafauna around offshore Oil & Gas (O&G) installations in the North and Irish Seas are presented. Marine megafauna activity was monitored visually and acoustically by Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC) qualified and experienced Marine Mammal Observers (MMO) and Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) Operators respectively, with real-time towed PAM {{in combination with}} industry standard software, PAMGuard. Monitoring was performed during routine O&G industrial operations for underwater noise mitigation purposes, and to ensure adherence to regulatory guidelines. Incidental sightings by off-effort MMOs and installation crew were also reported. Visual and acoustic monitoring spanned 55 non-consecutive days between 2004 and 2014. A total of 47 marine mammal sightings were recorded by MMOs on dedicated watch, and 10 incidental sightings of marine megafauna were reported over 10 years. Species included: harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena), Atlantic white-sided dolphin (Lagenorhynchus acutus), white <b>beaked</b> <b>dolphin</b> (Lagenorhynchus albirostris), common dolphin (Delphinus delphis), minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata), common seal (Phoca vitulina), grey seal (Halichoerus grypus) and, basking shark (Cetorhinus maximus). Passive Acoustic Monitoring was conducted on two occasions in 2014; 160 PAM hours over 12 days recorded a total of 308 individual clicks identified as harbour porpoises. These {{appear to be the}} first such acoustic detections obtained from a North Sea drilling rig whilst using a typically configured hydrophone array designed for towing in combination with real-time PAMGuard software. This study provides evidence that marine megafauna are present around mobile and stationary offshore O&G installations during routine operational activities. On this basis, Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) for decommissioning O&G platforms should be carried-out on a case-by-case basis, and must include provisions for hitherto overlooked marine megafauna...|$|E
40|$|The fertile {{waters of}} the North Sea {{represent}} one major life site {{for at least three}} different marine mammal species: the harbour porpoise, Phocoena phocoena, the harbour seal, Phoca vitulina, and the white-beaked dolphin, Lagenorhynchus albirostris. More occasionally, oceanic species such as the white-sided dolphin Lagenorhynchus acutus, the sperm whale Physeter macrocephalus or the fin whale Balaenoptera physalus can be sighted or found stranded. Very few data dealing with marine mammal diet in the North Sea are available. In order to contribute to the feeding ecology of these North Sea marine mammals, Cd as well as  15 N and  13 C measurements have been performed in their tissues. Sperm whales and white-sided dolphins display high renal Cd levels (258 µg. g- 1 and 88 µg. g- 1 dry weight respectively). Mean Cd concentrations measured in harbour porpoise, harbour seal, white <b>beaked</b> <b>dolphin</b> and fin whale kidneys remain low (mean: 5, 0. 9, 0. 5 and 4 µg. g- 1 respectively). However, some adult porpoises display renal Cd concentrations higher than 10 µg. g- 1. Mean  13 C measured in the muscles of sperm whales, fin whales and white-sided dolphins are more negative compared to harbour porpoise, harbour seal or white-beaked dolphin mean value. Cd contaminated porpoises display significant lower muscle  13 C than other porpoises. Both low d 13 C and high Cd levels suggest a greater reliance of white-sided dolphins, sperm whales on oceanic cephalopods. It appears that some harbour porpoises can also feed on oceanic squids suggesting dynamic interactions between the North Sea and the North Atlantic porpoise populations...|$|E

5000|$|Common {{bottlenose}} dolphins are {{the most}} familiar dolphins due to the wide exposure they receive in captivity in marine parks and dolphinaria, and in movies and television programs. T. truncatus is the largest species of the <b>beaked</b> <b>dolphins.</b> They inhabit temperate and tropical oceans throughout the world, and are absent only from polar waters. All bottlenose dolphins were previously known as T. truncatus, but recently the genus has been split into three species, T. truncatus, T. aduncus (Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin) and T. australis (Burrunan dolphin). Although T. truncatus has been traditionally called the bottlenose dolphin, many authors have used the name common bottlenose dolphin for this species since two other species of bottlenose dolphins were described. [...] The dolphins inhabit warm and temperate seas worldwide. Considerable genetic variation has been described among members of this species, even between neighboring populations, and so many experts believe multiple species may be included within T. truncatus.|$|R

40|$|In the {{framework}} of a North Sea and adjacent areas monitoring, metallothioneins (MTs) have been studied in livers and kidneys of 8 marine mammals species collected on the Belgian coast and in the Northeast Atlantic between 1993 and 2000 : the harbour porpoise Phocoena phocoena, the harbour seal Phoca vitulina, the white <b>beaked</b> <b>dolphin</b> Lagenorhynchus albirostris, the white sided dolphin Lagenorhynchus acutus, the sperm whale Physeter macrocephalus, the fin whale Balaenoptera physalus, the common dolphin Delphinus delphis and the striped dolphin Stenella coeruleoalba. The participation of this protein in metal detoxification has been investigated since high levels of cadmium (Cd) and mercury (Hg) have been measured in livers and kidneys of those marine mammals. It appears that MT concentrations vary widely in marine mammals tissues (from 50 to more than 2000 µg. g– 1 dw) underlying the numerous parameters involved: species, tissue, physiological status, pregnancy, age, diet and metal level. The percentage of the cytosolic Cd bound to MTs can reach almost 100 %. On the contrary, the percentage of hepatic and renal Hg bound to MT is very low (generally less than 10 %) and this metal is mainly associated with selenium (HgSe) under a detoxified form in the insoluble fraction of the tissues. Characterisation of renal MTs of white-sided dolphin has been performed: the protein has two isoforms (MT- 1 and MT- 2) with a molecular weight estimated around 6800. MT- 1 can bind Cu, Zn, Hg and Cd while MT- 2 only binds Zn, Hg and Cd suggesting different metabolic functions for the two isoforms. MT- 2 was also more abundant than MT- 1. To conclude, MTs appear to play a minor role in the binding and detoxification of Hg by marine mammals. On the contrary, close and dynamic interactions occur between Cd and MTs. White-sided dolphin metallothioneins has two isoforms likely characterised by different metabolic functions in relation with cellular homeostasis and cadmium detoxification. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Statoil {{deployed}} three acoustic recorders from fall 2013 to fall 2014 in the Arctic {{region as}} part of a broad scientific campaign. One recorder was installed in the Barents Sea southeast of Spitsbergen. Two other recorders were installed in the Greenland Sea north-east of Greenland. All recorders were operating at a duty cycle of 2 minutes on and 30 minutes off, sampling at 39062 Hz and recording in 24 bits. This presentation will report the acoustic analysis done on the data using SONS-DCL, comparing the results between the different locations and putting emphasis on the differences in received sound levels mostly due to ice movement, anthropogenic sources and the presence of cetaceans in the different seasons. For the Greenland Sea data, an overview will be presented of the relationship between received levels and distance of a detected seismic survey. As for the animal presence it was found to be minimal during the summer months, although sperm whales where present all year round and some fin whale calls were received in early summer as well. Bearded seal presence was very seasonal from around April to June both at Spitsbergen and Greenland. Bowhead whale presence at Greenland was especially strong during the winter, with possible humpback presence at Spitsbergen. But no attempt was made to distinguish humpback and bowhead whale calls. At Spitsbergen belugas or narwhals were present; at the Greenland recorders there were fewer dolphin signals, and those found were most likely from white <b>beaked</b> <b>dolphins.</b> A number of unidentified acoustic events were detected as well.

40|$|Small whale {{investigations}} {{were carried}} out in the month May and June 1972 with two whaling vessels in the area off Svalbard and in the Barents. Sea. As far as possible all whales observed during the cruise were recorded. Poor weather was probably the reason why only 10 minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) and 2 killer whales (Orcinus orca) were observed in the beginning of May off Spitsbergen and only 3 — 4 minke whales and 2 killer whales near Centralbanken. During the period 10 — 16 June two fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus} but no minke whales, were observed off Spitsbergen. The weather was better in the Barents Sea, and minke whales were found in areas with good food conditions. Between 24 — 27 May 50 — 60 minke whales were observed at Østbanken, and between 3 — 10 June 80 minke whales, 7 killer whales and 2 fin whales were seen in the area Østbanken — Lewis Hole. At Nordkappbanken 100 — 200 white <b>beaked</b> <b>dolphins</b> (Lagenorhynchus albirostris) were observed. Altogether 39 females and 8 males of minke whales were caught by the two vessels. General biological data including total length and 20 body measurements were sampled from all the catch. Blood and tissue samples were collected for a study of population criteria. Of the females 24 were sexually immature and 15 mature. All the mature females were pregnant, which supports the earlier statements that the minke whales in the north Atlantic give birth every year. All the foetuses were found, and 14 of these measured from 29. 0 to 80. 3 cm with a mean lenght of 54. 0 cm. The 15 th was an embryo with a length of 8. 5 mm. This material indicates a pairing season between January and May. From the small numbers of corpora in the ovary it may be oncluded that the females in the catch are relatively young. The length at sexual maturity and the length distribution in the catch are nearly the same as in previous findings. Examination of stomach contents showed that the whales had fed on krill, capelin and polar cod...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} efficacy of using passive acoustic monitoring of dolphin echolocation clicks to study ecological questions about spatial and temporal distribution patterns {{and the influence of}} environmental variability on dolphin activity. First, the groundwork is laid by examining echolocation clicks recorded from concurrent visual and acoustic surveys and testing whether species-specific features exist in the spectral content of clicks recorded in the presence of five delphinid species: short-beaked common dolphins (Delphinus delphis), long- <b>beaked</b> common <b>dolphins</b> (Delphinus capensis), bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus), Risso's dolphins (Grampus griseus), and Pacific white-sided dolphins (Lagenorhynchus obliquidens). Unique spectral banding patterns are discovered only for Risso's and Pacific white-sided dolphins and two distinct click types are found for Pacific white-sided dolphins. Next, autonomous recordings from six sites are analyzed for the presence of Pacific white-sided and Risso's dolphin click bouts and diel, seasonal, and interannual variability in click activity are described. Risso's dolphins are more vocally active during the night which I suggest is related to foraging on diel vertically migrating squid. Seasonal and interannual variability in Risso's dolphin call activity are high. Comparisons of diel, seasonal and spatial variability of the two Pacific white-sided click types are made and the two click types are shown to exhibit differences in usage patterns. This comparison reveals a southern and northern distribution pattern between the click types adding support to the hypothesis that the two click types represent the two morphologically and genetically distinct populations which overlap in the study area. Finally, the ability to predict variability in click activity is examined with respect to the environment by building generalized additive models. Remotely-sensed environmental variables are modeled with respect to current time and time-lagged data to examine questions about the underlying oceanographic processes which may lead to dolphin occurrence. The inclusion of timelagged environmental data can improve predictive models and allows a realistic time frame for conservation and management mitigation efforts. Passive acoustic monitoring of echolocation clicks has revealed patterns in diel activity and seasonal movements of Risso's and Pacific white-sided dolphins and shows promise for improved predictive habitat model...|$|R
40|$|We use mark-recapture methods {{applied to}} photo-identification data to {{estimate}} abundance and survival rate of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops sp.) {{in the western}} gulf of Shark Bay, Western Australia. The data {{used for this study}} was collected as part of a long-term project assessing factors that drive tool use (foraging with a protective marine sponge over the <b>beak)</b> in bottlenose <b>dolphins.</b> Boat-based photo-identification surveys on dolphin groups were conducted in each austral winter (April-September) between 2007 and 2010 along ten transect lines. Each transect line was repeated 25 times in total over the four winters. To date, a total of 1190 dolphin groups (ca. 55 % ‘on transect’ and 45 % ‘off transect’) have been photo-identified, resulting in the identification of > 400 individual dolphins. The Robust Design was chosen as the appropriate model to estimate abundance and survival rate as temporary emigration could be incorporated in the analysis. This study is the first robust abundance estimation of bottlenose dolphins in part of the western gulf and will serve as a baseline for making future comparisons. This research has both empirical and applied value, since these results allow us to (1) better estimate the proportion of the population that engages in tool use and, thus, address questions centred around behavioural ecology, and (2) assess whether or not future increases in anthropogenic activity may degrade habitat to the extent that population size and behaviour is affected...|$|R
40|$|Ph. D. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2015. Includes bibliographical references. Deep diving odontocetes, like sperm whales, <b>beaked</b> whales, Risso's <b>dolphins,</b> {{and pilot}} whales {{are known to}} forage at deep depths in the ocean on squid and fish. These marine mammal species are top predators {{and for this reason}} are very {{important}} for the ecosystems they live in, since they can affect prey populations and control food web dynamics through top-down effects. The studies presented in this thesis investigate deep diving odontocetes‟ foraging strategies, and the density and size of their potential prey in the deep ocean using passive and active acoustic techniques. Ecological Acoustic Recorders (EAR) were used to monitor the foraging activity of deep diving odontocetes at three locations around the world: the Josephine Seamount High Sea Marine Protected Area (JHSMPA), the Ligurian Sea, and along the Kona coast of the island of Hawaii. In the JHSMPA, sperm whales‟ and beaked whales‟ foraging rates do not differ between night-time and day-time. However, in the Ligurian Sea, sperm whales switch to night-time foraging as the winter approaches, while beaked whales alternate between hunting mainly at night, and both at night and at day. Spatial differences were found in deep diving odontocetes‟ foraging activity in Hawaii where they forage most in areas with higher chlorophyll concentrations. Pilot whales (and false killer whales, clustered together in the category "blackfishes") and Risso's dolphins forage mainly at night at all locations. These two species adjust their foraging activity with the length of the night. The density and size of animals living in deep sea scattering layers was studied using a DIDSON imaging sonar at multiple stations along the Kona coast of Hawaii. The density of animals was affected by location, depth, month, and the time of day. The size of animals was influenced by station and month. The DIDSON proved to be a successful, non-invasive technique to study density and size of animals in the deep sea. Densities were found to be an order of magnitude higher than previously found with trawls, and sizes of animals were found to be 3 - 4 times larger than in trawl data...|$|R
