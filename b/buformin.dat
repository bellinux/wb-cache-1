50|$|<b>Buformin,</b> {{along with}} {{phenformin}} and metformin, inhibits {{the growth and}} development of cancer. The anticancer property of these drugs is due {{to their ability to}} disrupt the Warburg effect and revert the cytosolic glycolysis characteristic of cancer cells to normal oxidation of pyruvate by the mitochondria. Metformin reduces liver glucose production in diabetics and disrupts the Warburg effect in cancer by AMPK activation and inhibition of the mTor pathway. <b>Buformin</b> decreased cancer incidence, multiplicity, and burden in chemically induced rat mammary cancer, whereas metformin and phenformin had no statistically significant effect on the carcinogenic process relative to the control group. <b>Buformin</b> also exhibits anti-proliferative and anti-invasive effects in endometrial cancer cells.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{therapeutic}} effect of short-term <b>buformin</b> (1 -butylbiguanide) treatment {{was investigated in}} 12 patients with reactive hypoglycemia. Eleven of them were classified as having idiopathic reactive hypoglycemia, nine obese and two nonobese. None of these patients had a degree of hyperglycemia during glucose tolerance tests which would indicate diabetes mellitus. In one patient reactive hypoglycemia was related to chemical diabetes. The diagnosis of reactive hypoglycemia was established {{on the basis of}} patient’s history, hypoglycemic reaction and low blood glucose levels during 6 -hour oral glucose tolerance tests. The patients received 200 mg of bufonmin daily for 7 days and its {{therapeutic effect}}iveness was assessed by repeat testing. Bufonmin treatment resulted in significant increase of blood glucose values between 180 and 360 mm after oral glucose challenge and in considerable improvement of hypoglycemia in nine obese patients with idiopathic reactive hypoglycemia and in the patient with chemical diabetes.

40|$|Biguanides are a {{class of}} drugs widely used as oral antihyperglycemic agents for the {{treatment}} of type 2 diabetes mellitus, but they are associated with lactic acidosis, a lethal side effect. We reported previously that biguanides are good substrates of rat organic cation transporter 1 (Oct 1; Slc 22 a 1) and, using Oct 1 (-/-) mice, that mouse Oct 1 is responsible for the hepatic uptake of a biguanide, metformin. In the present study, we investigated whether the liver is the key organ for the lactic acidosis. When mice were given metformin, the blood lactate concentration significantly increased in the wild-type mice, whereas only a slight increase was observed in Oct 1 (-/-) mice. The plasma concentration of metformin exhibited similar time profiles between the wild-type and Oct 1 (-/-) mice, suggesting that the liver is the key organ responsible for the lactic acidosis. Furthermore, the extent of the increase in blood lactate caused by three different biguanides (metformin, <b>buformin,</b> and phenformin) was compared with the abilities to reduce oxygen consumption in isolated rat hepatocytes. When rats were given each of these biguanides, the lactate concentration increased significantly. This effect was dose-dependent, and the EC 50 values of metformin, <b>buformin,</b> and phenformin were 734, 119, and 4. 97 muM, respectively. All of these biguanides reduced the oxygen consumption by isolated rat hepatocytes in a concentration-dependent manner. When the concentration required to reduce the oxygen consumption to 75 % of the control value (from 0. 40 to 0. 29 mumol/min/mg protein) was compared with the EC 50 value obtained in vivo, a clear correlation was observed among the three biguanides, suggesting that oxygen consumption in isolated rat hepatocytes can be used as an index of the incidence of lactic acidosis...|$|E

40|$|The {{biguanide}} metformin {{is widely}} prescribed for Type II diabetes and has anti-neoplastic activity in laboratory models. Despite evidence that inhibition of mitochondrial respiratory complex I by metformin {{is the primary}} cause of its cell-lineage-specific actions and therapeutic effects, the molecular interaction(s) between metformin and complex I remain uncharacterized. In the present paper, we describe the effects of five pharmacologically relevant biguanides on oxidative phosphorylation in mammalian mitochondria. We report that biguanides inhibit complex I by inhibiting ubiquinone reduction (but not competitively) and, independently, stimulate reactive oxygen species production by the complex I flavin. Biguanides also inhibit mitochondrial ATP synthase, and two of them inhibit only ATP hydrolysis, not synthesis. Thus we identify biguanides as a new class of complex I and ATP synthase inhibitor. By comparing biguanide effects on isolated complex I and cultured cells, we distinguish three anti-diabetic and potentially anti-neoplastic biguanides (metformin, <b>buformin</b> and phenformin) from two anti-malarial biguanides (cycloguanil and proguanil) : the former are accumulated into mammalian mitochondria and affect oxidative phosphorylation, whereas the latter are excluded so act only on the parasite.

40|$|Some {{cancer cells}} can survive under glucose {{deprivation}} within the microenvironment of a tumor. Recently, we reported that N-linked (b-N-acetylglucosamine) 2 [N-GlcNAc 2]-modified proteins induce G 2 /M arrest and cell death under glucose deprivation. Here, we investigated whether such {{a response to}} glucose deprivation contributes {{to the survival of}} renal cell carcinomas, which are sensitive to nutritional stress. Specifically, we analyzed seven renal carcinoma cell lines. Four of these cell lines produced N-GlcNAc 2 -modified proteins and led G 2 /M-phase arrest under glucose deprivation, leading to cell death. The remaining three cell lines did not produce N-GlcNAc 2 -modified proteins and undergo G 1 /S-phase arrest under glucose deprivation, leading to survival. The four dead cell lines displayed significant up-regulation in the UDP-GlcNAc biosynthesis pathway as well as increased phosphorylation of p 53, which was not observed in the surviving three cell lines. In addition, the four dead cell lines showed prolonged up-regulated expression of ATF 3, which is related to unfolded protein response (UPR), while the surviving three cell lines showed only transient up-regulation of ATF 3. In this study, we demonstrated that the renal carcinoma cells which accumulate N-GlcNAc 2 -modified proteins under glucose deprivation do not survive with abnormaly prolonged UPR pathway. By contrast, renal carcinoma cells that do not accumulate N-GlcNAc 2 -modified proteins under these conditions survive.

40|$|Metformin (dimethylbiguanide) {{has become}} the {{preferred}} first-line oral blood glucose-lowering agent to manage type 2 diabetes. Its history is linked to Galega officinalis (also known as goat's rue), a traditional herbal medicine in Europe, found to be rich in guanidine, which, in 1918, was shown to lower blood glucose. Guanidine derivatives, including metformin, were synthesised and some (not metformin) were used to treat diabetes in the 1920 s and 1930 s but were discontinued due to toxicity and the increased availability of insulin. Metformin was rediscovered {{in the search for}} antimalarial agents in the 1940 s and, during clinical tests, proved useful to treat influenza when it sometimes lowered blood glucose. This property was pursued by the French physician Jean Sterne, who first reported the use of metformin to treat diabetes in 1957. However, metformin received limited attention as it was less potent than other glucose-lowering biguanides (phenformin and <b>buformin),</b> which were generally discontinued in the late 1970 s due to high risk of lactic acidosis. Metformin's future was precarious, its reputation tarnished by association with other biguanides despite evident differences. The ability of metformin to counter insulin resistance and address adult-onset hyperglycaemia without weight gain or increased risk of hypoglycaemia gradually gathered credence in Europe, and after intensive scrutiny metformin was introduced into the USA in 1995. Long-term cardiovascular benefits of metformin were identified by the UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) in 1998, providing a new rationale to adopt metformin as initial therapy to manage hyperglycaemia in type 2 diabetes. Sixty years after its introduction in diabetes treatment, metformin {{has become the}} most prescribed glucose-lowering medicine worldwide with the potential for further therapeutic applications...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Two main {{classes of}} oral {{hypoglycaemic}} drugs, the sulphonylureas and the biguanides, are currently {{used in the}} therapy of type II, non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). The basic pharmacokinetic properties of these agents are discussed {{with a view to}} efficient and safe treatment. Both first- and second-generation sulphonylureas are rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. In the plasma compartment, these drugs are strongly bound to serum proteins. All sulphonylureas are metabolished in the liver, and the metabolites and the parent drugs are eliminated mainly in the urine, but also (second-generation derivatives) in the faeces. Rapid- and short-acting sulphonylureas may improve early insulin release and promote better postprandial glucose control. Long-acting derivatives may ensure better control of overnight glycaemia. The elderly are at risk of developing severe sulphonylurea-induced hypoglycaemia, and in this population the agent chosen should have a short or intermediate duration of action and no active metabolites. Caution is needed when prescribing any sulphonylurea in patients receiving drugs known to affect sulphonylurea action, and in those with impaired liver and/or kidney function. The bioavailability of the biguanides ranges from 40 to 60 %. Binding to plasma proteins is absent or very low. Metformin and <b>buformin</b> are not metabolised and are excreted in the urine; phenformin undergoes hepatic hydroxylation and is excreted in both urine and faeces. Metformin is the only agent of this class currently recommended for clinical use. The main indications of metformin treatment are NIDDM associated with obesity and/or hyperlipidaemia, and in combination with sulphonylurea both as primary treatment and when secondary failure occurs with sulphonylurea alone. Lactic acidosis may develop in patients receiving therapy with biguanides, especially {{in the presence of a}} preexisting contraindication to their use...|$|E
40|$|Non-insulin-dependent (type 2) {{diabetes}} mellitus (NIDDM) affects middle-aged or elderly people who frequently have several other concomitant diseases, especially obesity, hypertension, dyslipidaemias, coronary insufficiency, heart failure and arthropathies. Thus, polymedication {{is the rule}} in this population, {{and the risk of}} drug interactions is important, particularly in elderly patients. The present review is restricted to the interactions of other drugs with antihyperglycaemic compounds, and will not consider the mirror image, i. e. the interactions of antihyperglycaemic agents with other drugs. Oral antihyperglycaemic agents include sulphonylureas, biguanides [...] essentially metformin since the withdrawn of phenformin and <b>buformin</b> [...] and alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, acarbose being the only representative on the market. These drugs can be used alone or in combination to obtain better metabolic control, sometimes with insulin. Drug interactions with antihyperglycaemic agents can be divided into pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions. Most pharmacokinetic studies concern sulphonylureas, whose action may be enhanced by numerous other drugs, thus increasing the risk of hypoglycaemia. Such an effect may result essentially from protein binding displacement, inhibition of hepatic metabolism and reduction of renal clearance. Reduction of the hypoglycaemic activity of sulphonylureas due to pharmacokinetic interactions with other drugs appears to be much less frequent. Drug interactions leading to an increase in plasma metformin concentrations, mainly by reducing the renal excretion or the hepatic metabolism of the biguanide, should be avoided to limit the risk of hyperlactaemia. Owing to its mode of action, pharmacokinetic interferences with acarbose are limited to the gastrointestinal tract, but have not been extensively studied yet. Pharmacodynamic interactions are quite numerous and may result in a potentiation of the hypoglycaemic action or, conversely, in a deterioration of blood glucose control. Such interactions may be observed whatever the type of antidiabetic treatment. They result from the intrinsic properties of the coprescribed drug on insulin secretion and action, or on a key step of carbohydrate metabolism. Finally, a combination of 2 to 3 antihyperglycaemic agents is common for treating patients with NIDDM to benefit from the synergistic effect of compounds acting on different sites of carbohydrate metabolism. Possible pharmacokinetic interactions between alpha-glucosidase inhibitors and classical antidiabetic oral agents should be better studied in the diabetic population. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Adverse drug {{reactions}} (ADRs) are a {{major problem}} for drug companies and healthcare providers alike. Although ADRs can present anywhere in the body, the liver frequently effected, due to the relatively large concentrations of drugs it encounters. Drug induced liver injury (DILI) can occur through several different mechanisms. Bioactivation of drugs to reactive metabolites is believed to be a crucial step in the development of many cases of DILI. Nefazodone, an anti-depressant which was withdrawn due to hepatotoxicity, {{has been shown to be}} bioactivated to a reactive quinone-imine. The role of the mitochondria and their involvement in DILI is being increasingly recognised. The biguanides are known mitochondrial toxins, and phenformin and <b>buformin</b> were removed from the market due to unacceptably high incidents of lactic acidosis. The aims of this thesis were two-fold; to assess the bioactivation and irreversible binding of nefazodone and it safer analogue buspirone and to use the biguanides to assess mitochondrial toxicity in primary hepatocytes. In liver microsomes, both nefazodone and buspirone demonstrated NADPH-dependent irreversible binding, however, nefazodone irreversible binding was 9 -fold that of buspirone. The metabolism of both nefazodone and buspirone was extensive and consisted mainly of hydroxylation and N-dealkylation reactions. In rat and human liver microsomes supplemented with GSH, nefazodone formed GSH conjugates with m/z 791 and m/z 807. This implied that the conjugates were formed from bioactivation of para-hydroxy nefazodone and dihydroxy-nefazodone. In rat liver microsomes, buspirone did not form any GSH conjugates. Further investigations of nefazodone and buspirone were carried out in freshly isolated rat hepatocytes. Metabolism of nefazodone and buspirone was investigated and revealed extensive metabolism of both compounds; however, GSH conjugates of neither compound were discovered. At 6 hours, both nefazodone and buspirone demonstrated significant irreversible binding (117. 54 ± 15. 32 pmol equiv. /mg protein and 84. 43 ± 30. 93 pmol equiv. /mg protein respectively) but only nefazodone demonstrated a significant decrease in cell viability (19. 25 ± 18. 26 % control viability). Inhibition studies, using ABT, significantly reduced the irreversible binding of nefazodone (49. 34 ± 4. 64 pmol equiv. /mg protein) but did not decrease cytotoxicity. This indicated that in rat hepatocytes the parent compound may be responsible for toxicity. Mitochondrial toxicity was investigated using the model mitochondrial toxins the biguanides. Initially, studies in cultured primary rat hepatocytes demonstrated that phenformin was the most potent mitochondrial toxin and dissipated the mitochondrial membrane potential, as measured by TMRM, within 24 hours (1. 028 ± 0. 39 % control fluorescence). This was taken forward to investigate mitochondrial toxicity in primary rat hepatocytes. Investigations into phenformin in rat hepatocytes demonstrated a high turnover to glucuronide metabolites and the novel metabolites [O, OMe] phenformin glucuronide and [2 O] phenformin glucuronide were identified. Inhibition studies of CYP 450 2 D were undertaken using quinine (100 µM) and this demonstrated significant inhibition of phenformin up to 200 µM (AUC 47. 30 ± 47. 30 without quinine vs AUC 648. 80 ± 121. 28 with quinine). Despite increased phenformin concentrations, inhibition of phenformin metabolism did not produce overt cytotoxicity, however, lactate concentrations correlated with increased phenformin concentration. The work presented here highlights the need for a greater understanding of the role of bioactivation and irreversible binding in hepatotoxicity. It also demonstrates that whilst irreversible binding can help inform decisions as to whether a compound progresses into clinical trials, it should be made in the context of other safety assessments. Investigations into phenformin mitochondrial toxicity, illustrates the need to assess drugs and systems fully, to establish model compounds to investigate mechanisms of ADRs. A greater understanding of in vitro systems and the tools utilised to assess them, will benefit drug discovery and development. Ultimately, understanding these in vitro tests and the model compounds used to assess them, will help bridge the gap to man...|$|E
