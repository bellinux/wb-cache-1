They occupied the fort and destroyed {{a large number}} of abandoned stockades. <b>But</b> <b>they</b> <b>found</b> the heat excessive and returned.|$|E

5|$|Harvard had so {{much trouble}} finding a {{replacement}} for Gray that they considered hiring a European, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>found</b> an American and hired George Lincoln Goodale in late 1872. Goodale had a medical degree from Harvard and a solid knowledge of botany. By late June 1873 Goodale had enough experience that Gray was exalted to pronounce he had taught his last class. William Gilson Farlow also had a medical degree from Harvard and had studied botany. He became Gray's assistant in 1870 after obtaining his medical degree and then studied in Europe for a few years. He returned to Harvard in 1874 and became a botany professor. Sereno Watson began helping Gray with taxonomy in 1872 and became the herbarium curator. The reorganization of botany at Harvard in the early 1870s was a major accomplishment of Gray's.|$|E
5|$|On 25 November 1941, {{following}} {{the loss of}} HMAS Sydney, one of No. 20 Squadron's Catalinas was despatched to Western Australia to join a No. 11 Squadron Catalina in search-and-rescue missions, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>found</b> only oil slicks. By the outbreak {{of war in the}} Pacific, No. 20 Squadron had a strength of six Catalinas and two Empire flying boats. Its personnel at the beginning of December numbered 14 officers and 118 men. The squadron undertook its first sortie of the Pacific War on 8 December; a Catalina located three Japanese luggers in the vicinity of Thursday Island, Queensland. Later in the month it commenced anti-submarine patrols and, in January 1942, bombing raids against Japanese bases. As the Japanese advanced into the South West Pacific, No. 20 Squadron was also responsible for evacuating white civilians from areas threatened by invasion. On 21 January, one of its Catalinas located the Japanese fleet steaming for Rabaul and signalled a warning to the town's Australian defenders before being shot down by anti-aircraft fire; it was the squadron's first combat loss.|$|E
5|$|Only {{three people}} were {{involved}} in the production of Daicon III, Hideaki Anno, Hiroyuki Yamaga and Takami Akai. Takeda, who {{was a part of the}} group, explains in Notenki Memoirs that Anno knew how to make anime, but he never worked with animation cels. They were referred to Animepolis Pero, an anime hobby store chain, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>found</b> that the cost of the cels were too expensive, so a single cel was purchased and taken to a vinyl manufacturer in east Osaka, where they purchased a roll for 2000 yen. After cutting and preparing the vinyl cels, they discovered that the painted cels would stick together when stacked and dry paint would peel off the cels. To keep costs low, they made their own tap to punch holes in the B5 animation paper used in the production.|$|E

5|$|The Italians {{took control}} of the wreck, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>found</b> her a total loss, and so began to {{dismantle}} Dunkerque. As part of this process, the ship was deliberately damaged to prevent the French from being able to repair her if she was recaptured; the Italians cut down the main battery guns to render them unusable. The partially scrapped hulk was in turn seized by the Germans when Italy surrendered to the Allies in September 1943. In 1944, the Germans removed the ship's bow to float her out of the drydock to free up the dock and continue the scrapping process. While in Axis possession, she was bombed several times by Allied aircraft. The hulk was condemned on 15 September 1955 and renamed Q56. Her remains, which amounted to not more than , were sold for final demolition on 30 September 1958 for 226,117,000 francs.|$|E
5|$|The Mortaras {{spent the}} morning of 24 June {{attempting}} to have Feletti's order overruled by either the city's cardinal legate, Giuseppe Milesi Pironi Ferretti, or the Archbishop of Bologna, Michele Viale-Prelà, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>found</b> that neither was in the city. Around noon, the Mortaras decided {{to take steps to}} make the separation as painless as possible. Edgardo's siblings were taken to visit relatives while Marianna reluctantly agreed to spend the evening with the wife of Giuseppe Vitta, a Jewish family friend. Around 17:00 Momolo visited San Domenico to make one last plea to Feletti. The inquisitor repeated all he had said to Padovani and Moscato the previous night and told Momolo not to worry as Edgardo would be well cared for, under the protection of the Pope himself. He warned that it would benefit no-one to make a scene when the carabinieri returned that evening.|$|E
5|$|The quarter-final draw also {{determined}} the teams' routes to the final, with Barcelona facing {{the prospect of}} meeting either Chelsea or Liverpool in the semi-finals. After a 3–1 win at Anfield, Chelsea qualified for the semi-finals with a 4–4 draw at Stamford Bridge. The semi-final first leg was played at the Camp Nou; although Barcelona enjoyed {{the majority of the}} possession, Chelsea's defence was resolute and they became the first side to keep a clean sheet in Barcelona in this season's competition, coming away with a goalless draw. Barcelona needed to avoid defeat to reach the final, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>found</b> themselves a goal down within 10 minutes; after they failed to clear Frank Lampard's pass into the penalty area, Michael Essien fired a left-footed volley past Víctor Valdés into the roof of the net. The rest of the match continued much the same as the first leg, with Barcelona retaining most of the possession. Despite this, they found themselves guilty of several fouls, while Chelsea made four unsuccessful penalty appeals during the match. Meanwhile, Dani Alves received his third yellow card of the knockout phase, ruling him out of Barcelona's next match, and Éric Abidal was given a straight red card for a foul on Nicolas Anelka as the French forward was through on goal. However, television replays after the incident showed that there was little contact between Abidal and Anelka. Norwegian referee Tom Henning Øvrebø allowed a minimum of fourminutes of injury time {{at the end of the}} second half; in the third of those fourminutes – just when it looked like Chelsea were about to secure a repeat of the 2008 final – Messi played the ball across the edge of the penalty area to Andrés Iniesta, who shot just past Petr Čech's outstretched hand for the away goal that would send Barcelona to the final.|$|E

25|$|In Germany, Atta {{enrolled}} in the urban planning graduate program at the Hamburg University of Technology.

This revealed that Martin had indeed been fishing in a forbidden zone and had initially given the naval authorities a false position for the Zeppelin in order to conceal this, making the Royal Navy search for the airship futile.|$|E

She would not even talk about the key events of 1881-82, their key years in Tombstone.

She said that she had believed Behan was planning to marry her, but he kept putting it off, and she grew disillusioned.|$|E
25|$|His first evil deed was {{the murder}} of the Norwegian petty king Vikar (Wicarus). Starkad had joined a Viking {{expedition}} with Vikar, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>found</b> themselves stopped by a strong wind. They then had the idea that they could appease the gods by performing a blót with human blood, and decided to cast lots as to whom was to be sacrificed. Starkad made a noose of willow and put it around the king's neck in the pretense that it was only for show and not for killing. However, the knot was so strong that the king was dying, and Starkad gave him the coup de grace with his sword. Others say that the noose of willow suddenly became so strong that the king was strangled.|$|E
25|$|When {{developing}} EastEnders, both Smith and Holland {{looked at}} influential models like Coronation Street, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>found</b> that it offered a rather outdated and nostalgic view of working-class life. Only after EastEnders began, and featured {{the characters of}} Tony Carpenter and Kelvin Carpenter, did Coronation Street start to feature black characters, for example. They {{came to the conclusion}} that Coronation Street had grown old with its audience, and that EastEnders would have to attract a younger, more socially extensive audience, ensuring that it had the longevity to retain it for many years thereafter. They also looked at Brookside but found there was a lack of central meeting points for the characters, making it difficult for the writers to intertwine different storylines, so EastEnders was set in Albert Square.|$|E
