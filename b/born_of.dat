5|$|Central to {{the plot}} of the game are two main {{characters}}, Ramza Beoulve and Delita Heiral.

However, as the story progresses, the two characters faced many conflicts that changed their viewpoint on life; Delita seeks to manipulate the upper class to achieve his dreams, while Ramza believes in justice and honor regardless of name and class.|$|E
5|$|Charlotte Brontë {{had a brief}} {{association}} with Banagher in the mid-1850s when she married one Arthur Bell Nicholls, her father's curate.

5|$|Following his death, {{his body}} was {{transferred}} to Constantinople and buried in the Church of the Holy Apostles there. His body survived the plundering of the city during the Fourth Crusade in 1204. Constantine was succeeded by his three sons <b>born</b> <b>of</b> Fausta, Constantine II, Constantius II and Constans. A number of relatives were killed by followers of Constantius, notably Constantine's nephews Dalmatius (who held the rank of Caesar) and Hannibalianus, presumably to eliminate possible contenders to an already complicated succession. He also had two daughters, Constantina and Helena, wife of Emperor Julian.|$|E
5|$|Freeborn Roman {{women were}} {{considered}} citizens throughout the Republic and Empire, {{but did not}} vote, hold political office, or serve in the military. A mother's citizen status determined that of her children, {{as indicated by the}} phrase ex duobus civibus Romanis natos ("children <b>born</b> <b>of</b> two Roman citizens"). A Roman woman kept her own family name (nomen) for life. Children most often took the father's name, but in the Imperial period sometimes made their mother's name part of theirs, or even used it instead.|$|E

EE had put forward a delta winged design and Vickers, a swept wing on a long fuselage. The EE wing, <b>born</b> <b>of</b> their greater supersonic experience, was judged superior to Vickers, while the Vickers fuselage was preferred. In effect, the aircraft would be built 50/50: Vickers the front half, EE the rear.|$|E
5|$|Truth (satya) implies love, and {{firmness}} (agraha) engenders {{and therefore}} {{serves as a}} synonym for force. I thus began to call the Indian movement Satyagraha, that is to say, the Force which is <b>born</b> <b>of</b> Truth and Love or nonviolence, and gave up {{the use of the}} phrase “passive resistance”, in connection with it, so much so that even in English writing we often avoided it and used instead the word “satyagraha”....|$|E
5|$|Christian doctrines {{include the}} beliefs that Jesus was {{conceived}} by the Holy Spirit, was <b>born</b> <b>of</b> a virgin named Mary, performed miracles, founded the Church, died by crucifixion as a sacrifice to achieve atonement, {{rose from the}} dead, and ascended into Heaven, from where he will return. Most Christians believe Jesus enables humans to be reconciled to God. The Nicene Creed asserts that Jesus will judge {{the living and the}} dead either before or after their bodily resurrection, an event tied to the Second Coming of Jesus in Christian eschatology. The great majority of Christians worship Jesus as the incarnation of God the Son, the second of three persons of a Divine Trinity. A minority of Christian denominations reject Trinitarianism, wholly or partly, as non-scriptural.|$|E

5|$|Consumed with remorse, {{the king}} sought {{to rectify the}} {{situation}} by arranging a marriage between his brother's orphaned son and Andriamanelo's own sister (the orphan's aunt), Rafotsindrindramanjaka. He declared that the child from this union would, if female, be wed to his own son Ralambo; if male, he would become Ralambo's successor. A girl was born, and she was promised to Ralambo as his future wife with the stipulation that the child <b>born</b> <b>of</b> their union would rule after Ralambo. In this way Andriamanelo established a tradition of succession that indirectly respected the queens' decree by ensuring that a child of his brother's line (and his own) would rule after him. Because of this decree, Ralambo's first son by his second wife was passed over {{in the line of}} succession in favor of Andrianjaka, Ralambo's son by Rafotsindrindramanjaka. Andriamanelo was also reportedly the first to formally establish the andriana as a caste of Merina nobles, thereby laying the foundation for a stratified and structured society. From this point forward, the term Hova was used to refer only to the non-noble free people of the society which would later be renamed Merina by Andriamanelo's son Ralambo.|$|E
5|$|Due to erotomania, Hinckley's {{motivation}} for the attack was <b>born</b> <b>of</b> his obsession with actress Jodie Foster. While living in Hollywood in the late 1970s, he saw the film Taxi Driver at least 15 times, apparently identifying strongly with Travis Bickle, the lead character portrayed by Robert De Niro. The arc of the story involves Bickle's attempts to protect a 12-year-old child prostitute, played by Foster. Toward {{the end of the}} film, Bickle attempts to assassinate a United States Senator who is running for president. Over the following years, Hinckley trailed Foster around the country, {{going so far as to}} enroll in a writing course at Yale University in 1980 after reading in People magazine that she was a student there. He wrote numerous letters and notes to her in late 1980. He called her twice and refused to give up when she indicated that she was not interested in him.|$|E
5|$|From {{the late}} 15th century, {{a number of}} {{painters}} emphasised landscape in their works, a development led {{in part by the}} shift in preference from religious iconography to secular subjects. Second-generation Netherlandish painters applied the mid-14th-century dictum of natural representation. This was <b>born</b> <b>of</b> the rising affluence of the region's middle class, many of whom had now travelled south and seen countryside noticeably different from their flat homeland. At the same time, the later part of the century saw the emergence of specialisation and a number of masters focused on detailing landscape, most notably Konrad Witz in the mid-15th century, and later Joachim Patinir. Most innovations in this format came from artists living in the Dutch regions of the Burgundian lands, most notably from Haarlem, Leiden and 's-Hertogenbosch. The significant artists from these areas did not slavishly reproduce the scenery before them, but in subtle ways adapted and modified their landscapes to reinforce the emphasis and meaning of the panel they were working on.|$|E
