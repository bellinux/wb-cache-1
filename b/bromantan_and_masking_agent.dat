5000|$|Chromium(III) sulfate (Cr(H2O)62(SO4)3) {{has long}} been {{regarded}} as the most efficient and effective tanning agent. Chromium(III) compounds of the sort used in tanning are significantly less toxic than hexavalent chromium. Chromium(III) sulfate dissolves to give the hexaaquachromium(III) cation, Cr(H2O)63+, which at higher pH undergoes processes called olation to give polychromium(III) compounds that are active in tanning, [...] being the cross-linking of the collagen subunits. The chemistry of Cr(H2O)63+ is more complex in the tanning bath rather than in water due {{to the presence of}} a variety of ligands. Some ligands include the sulfate anion, the collagen's carboxyl groups, amine groups from the side chains of the amino acids, <b>and</b> <b>masking</b> <b>agents.</b> <b>Masking</b> <b>agents</b> are carboxylic acids, such as acetic acid, used to suppress formation of polychromium(III) chains. <b>Masking</b> <b>agents</b> allow the tanner to further increase the pH to increase collagen's reactivity without inhibiting the penetration of the chromium(III) complexes.|$|R

50|$|Diuretics, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} ‘water pills’, are drugs which draw excess fluid from the tissues {{of the body}} and convert it into urine. They are used for the swelling and bloating of premenstrual syndrome, for treating high blood pressure and, in older people, for heart failure caused by weakening of the heart’s pumping mechanism. Diuretics are used to pass drug test because they increase the amount of urine produced by the body. By increasing the amount of urine, it dilutes any drugs in the urine, which makes it harder to identify drugs.

The results obtained indicate that the lactic acid system shows the best binding energies and the best flexibility. The OH–CRR’–COOH structure appears to be well fitted to complex the titanyl chain.

40|$|Abstract Introduction Tennis is a {{professional}} sport under a strict anti-doping control. However, since the first violation of the code, the positive cases have not been statistically studied. The objective {{of this study was}} to analyze doping offences in the international professional tennis circuit. Methods All offences to the Doping Code committed by tennis players during 2003 - 2009 were collected from the ITF official webpage, registered and analyzed. Results An average of 1905. 7 (± 174. 5) samples was obtained per year. Fifty-two doping offences were reported and the overall incidence of positive doping samples accounted for 0. 38 % and 7. 4 (± 4. 1) cases/year. Male players showed higher incidence doping offences than females (p = 0. 0004). The incidence in wheelchair players was higher than in non-handicapped subjects (p = 0. 0001) Banned substance distribution showed: stimulants 32. 69 %, cannabis 23. 07 %; anabolic 11. 53 %, diuretics <b>and</b> <b>masking</b> <b>agents</b> 11. 53, β 2 -agonists 9. 61 %; corticosteroids 3. 84 %, others 3. 84 %. The overall incidence of 'social drugs' (cocaine, cannabis) was 36. 53 %. All EPO and blood samples were normal, while the incidence of 'out-of-competition' offences was 0. 12 %. The lower incidence of doping was found in Grand Slams tournaments. Conclusions The incidence of positive doping samples among professional tennis players is quite low supporting the assumption that there is no evidence of systematic doping in Tennis. "Social drugs" misuse constitutes the main problem of doping in tennis. Male and wheelchair tennis players showed higher risk of infringing the doping code than their females and non-handicapped counterparts. Findings of this study should help to determine the direction of the ongoing strategy in the fight against doping in Tennis. </p...|$|R

Beverages formulated with non-GM soy protein are rare in the United States market since 93 % soybeans planted in U. S (2013) are labeled as GM. This study aimed to develop protein hydrolysate beverages using one cultivar among the four Arkansas grown non-GM soybean cultivars including Osage, R 95 - 1705, R 08 - 4004 and R 05 - 4969. R 08 - 4004 was selected since it had the highest amounts of the three branched amino acids including Phenylalanine (51. 4 mg/g), Leucine (74. 9 mg/g), and Isoleucine (49. 7 mg/g) with lowest amount of anti-nutrients including stachyose (42. 0 mg/g) and trypsin inhibitor (23. 0 TUI/mg). Soy protein isolate (SPI) was prepared using the aqueous extraction (pH = 9), and hydrolyzed at optimal condition of Alcalase concentration 1. 0 AU (3. 2 µL/g), 50 ºC, and 120 min incubation. The result was protein hydrolysate with low S 0 value (35. 4), low turbidity (0. 9), high soluble protein content (46. 7 %), and highest Angiotensin-I Converting Enzyme (ACE-I) inhibition activity (66. 6 %). Protein beverages containing 20 g SPH per 500 mL serving size were developed with Chai tea, tangerine, and mixed berries flavors. The sensory evaluation showed that the tangerine flavor had highest likeness followed by mixed berries, and Chai tea flavor. It also indicated that the usage of citric acid alone in tangerine flavor and the combination with bitter blocker <b>and</b> <b>masking</b> <b>agent</b> in mix berries flavor effectively minimized the bitter taste of SPH and increased the consumer acceptability. Shelf-life stability testing was at refrigerated storage (5 °C) over a 42 days period. Pasteurization (90 - 95 °C, 5 min) effectively prevented microbial growth.

Soluble protein content of three beverages decreased significantly caused by the precipitation of SPH over the storage period.

The analytical performances of three extraction procedures and five combination of derivatization parameters were compared in order to probe the conditions for speeding up the sample preparation step. Limits of detection (LOD) were evaluated in both EI-MS and ECNI-MS (electron capture negative ionization mass spectrometry) modes, indicating better sensitivity for most of the analytes using the latter ionization technique. The use of short columns and high carrier gas velocity in fast GC/MS produced efficient separation of the analytes in less than 4 min, resulting in a drastic reduction of the analysis time, while a resolution comparable to that obtained from classic GC conditions is maintained.

The composition of selenium(IV) -OMePT complex was 1 : 2 established from slope ratio method, mole ratio method and Job&# 39;s continuous variation method. The complex was stable for more than 72 h. The interfering effect of various foreign ions was studied <b>and</b> suitable <b>masking</b> <b>agents</b> were used wherever necessary to enhance the selectivity of the developed method. The proposed method was successfully applied for the determination of selenium(IV) from real samples, viz. pharmaceutical formulations, shampoo, vegetable sample, synthetic mixtures and environmental samples. Repetition of the method was checked by finding the relative standard deviation (RSD) for 10 determinations which was 0. 35 %.

40|$|On {{the flow}} {{injection}} analysis (FIA) of {{chemical oxygen demand}} (COD), silver salt was added as an oxidation catalyst for COD substances <b>and</b> a <b>masking</b> <b>agent</b> for halide to improve operating conditions of the FIA apparatus. Both of a proper concentration of potassium permanganate solution and 6. 0 % sulfuric acid solution containing 0. 1 % silver nitrate are individually pumped up with respective flow rates of 0. 51 ml min(-l) and merged into a carrier stream. A 20 μ 1 of sample solution is injected into the flow of sulfuric acid solution at just before the merging place. The sample mixed with the carrier solutions in a reaction manifol(polytetrafluoroethylene tubing: 0. 5 mm i. d. x 30 m), is passed through a thermostated bath at 100 °c {{and led to a}} flow cell for the absorbance measurements at 525 nm. The absorbances are continuously recorded with time. The peaks in the recordings showed good reproducibility and the calibration obtained at a linear concentration range of 0 - 170 mg 1 (- 1) COD with glucose as standard. The detection limit and precision confirmed with this method were 5 mg 1 (- 1) and 0. 8 %, respectively. Chloride ion up to 200 mg 1 (- 1) did not interfere without elimination of a silver chloride precipitate. By the present FIA method, several industrial waste water samples were analyzed at a sampling rate of about 40 samples per hour, and their apparent COD values were compared with those found by the manual JIS method. Both of the methods gave the similar results within an error range from - 35 to + 5 %...|$|R
