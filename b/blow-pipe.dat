6000|$|But {{as soon as}} I {{looked at}} it in the broad light of day, I saw my mistake. During the week, we have made three horns, got a <b>blow-pipe,</b> &c, and yesterday, all prepared, we prospected the [...] "Mountain House." [...] I broke the {{specimen}} in two, and found it full of fine gold inside. Then we washed out one-fourth of it, and got a noble prospect. This we reduced with the <b>blow-pipe,</b> and got about two cents (herewith enclosed) in pure gold.|$|E

50|$|During most {{of their}} history, silversmiths used {{charcoal}} or coke fired forges, and lung-powered <b>blow-pipes</b> for soldering and annealing. Modern silversmiths commonly use gas burning torches as heat sources. A newer method is laser beam welding.|$|R
60|$|With savage shouts {{the entire}} force of head hunters sprang in pursuit. Bulan lifted Virginia {{in his arms}} and dashed on ahead of Number Twelve and Number Three. A shower of {{poisoned}} darts blown from half a hundred sumpitans fell about them, and then Muda Saffir called to his warriors to cease using their deadly <b>blow-pipes</b> lest they kill the girl.|$|R
60|$|Kua-ko {{appeared}} to have brought some important news, which he discussed with Runi and the others; and {{on the following day}} I noticed that preparations for an expedition were in progress. Spears and bows and arrows were got ready, but not <b>blow-pipes,</b> and I knew by this that the expedition would not be a hunting one. Having discovered so much, also that only four men were going out, I called Kua-ko aside and begged him to let me go with them. He seemed pleased at the proposal, and at once repeated it to Runi, who considered for a little and then consented.|$|R
60|$|The Americans {{not only}} employ {{the bow and}} arrow, but, like some Amphinesians, the <b>blow-pipe,</b> as {{offensive}} weapons: but I am not aware that the outrigger canoe has ever been observed among them.|$|E
6000|$|... "Give me the <b>blow-pipe,</b> then," [...] I said, with a laugh, {{putting out}} my hand to take it. But he refused to let me take it, knowing that {{it would only be}} an arrow wasted if I {{attempted}} to shoot anything.|$|E
6000|$|And {{taking the}} {{instrument}} in his hand, he went towards a peculiarly powerful foot <b>blow-pipe</b> that {{stood at the}} far end of the toolshed. [...] "Good old Briggs!" [...] said one of the other young men, and opinion veered about.|$|E
60|$|In {{respect of}} cleanliness, his hut {{differed}} from the huts of all other men of his tribe. It was built of sun-dried mud. The furniture consisted of two beds, or heaps of leaves and skins, and several rude vessels of clay. The walls were decorated with bows, arrows, <b>blow-pipes,</b> lances, game-bags, fishing-lines, and other articles of the chase, {{as well as with}} miniature weapons and appliances of a similar kind, varying its size according to the ages of the little Tigers. Besides these, there hung from the rafters--if we may so name the sticks that stretched overhead--several network hammocks and unfinished garments, the handiwork of Mrs Tiger.|$|R
60|$|Towards the {{afternoon}} of that same day the travellers began to wake up, stretch themselves, and think about supper. In the course of conversation it transpired that a tiger had been prowling about the village for some days, and had hitherto successfully eluded all attempts to trap or spear it. They had tethered a goat several times near a small pond and watched the spot from safe positions among the trees, with spears, bows and arrows, and <b>blow-pipes</b> ready, but when they watched, the tiger did not come, and when they failed to watch, the tiger did come and carried off the goat. Thus they had been baffled.|$|R
60|$|The {{furniture}} of each hut {{was very}} simple. It {{consisted of a}} few earthen pots; baskets made of palm-leaves, which were filled with Spanish potatoes, maize, mandioca-roots, and various kinds of wild fruits; one or two drinking vessels; the hollow trunk of a tree, used for pounding maize in; and several dishes which contained the colours used by the Indians in painting their naked bodies,--a custom which was very prevalent amongst them. Besides these things, there were bows, arrows, spears, and <b>blow-pipes</b> in abundance; and hammocks hung from various posts, elevated about a foot from the ground. These hammocks were made of cotton cords, and served the purpose of tables, chairs, and beds.|$|R
60|$|He {{looked at}} me keenly, a little {{surprised}} at my confidence perhaps, then {{said that he was}} also going back and would accompany me One of the other men now advanced, <b>blow-pipe</b> in hand, to join us, and, leaving the wood, we started to walk across the savannah.|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{has been}} left to me?" [...] I said despondingly and {{spreading}} out my hands. [...] "My pistol gone, and did I not give Runi the tinder-box, and the little box with a cock painted on it to you? I had no return--not even the <b>blow-pipe.</b> How, then, can I get me a wife?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You're {{a bright}} sort of burglar," [...] said Mifflin, disparagingly. [...] "Why don't {{you use your}} {{oxy-acetylene}} <b>blow-pipe?</b> Do you realize, my boy, that you've let yourself in for buying a dinner for twelve hungry men next week? In the cold light of the morning, when reason returns to her throne, that'll come home to you." ...|$|E
50|$|Parakramabahu's {{coronation}} {{took place}} in 1236. He {{turned his attention to}} the recovery of Polonnaruwa from the Tamils, and achieved this purpose by 1244. In this connection two kings are mentioned, Kalinga Magha and Jaya Bahu, who had been in power forty years, apparently reckoned from the time of the military rule after Sahasa Malla. As the Tamil war' and the `Malala war' as specifically mentioned by contemporary chronicles the two kings may have held different parts of the country. In the king's eleventh year (1244/5) Lanka was invaded by Chandrabhanu, a Javanese (Javaka) from Tambralinga, with a host armed with <b>blow-pipes</b> and poisoned arrows: he may have been a sea-robber, and though now repulsed descended on the Island later on.|$|R
60|$|One of {{the animals}} killed by the Indians at this time was a black jaguar,--a {{magnificent}} animal, and very fierce. He was discovered crouching in a thicket backed by a precipice, from which he could only escape by charging {{through the ranks of}} his enemies. He did it nobly. With a roar that rebounded {{from the face of the}} high cliff and echoed through the valley like a peal of thunder, he sprang out and rushed at the savages in front, who scattered like chaff right and left. But at the same instant fifty <b>blow-pipes</b> sent their poisoned shafts into his body, and, after a few convulsive bounds, the splendid monarch of the American forests fell dead on the ground. The black jaguar is a somewhat rare animal, and is very seldom seen. This one was therefore hailed as a great prize, and the skin and claws were carefully preserved.|$|R
6000|$|... "Evangelical Union," [...] formed {{some two}} years before, with what cause we saw, has Kur-Pfalz [Winter-King's Father; died 9th September, 1610, {{few days after}} this {{recapture}} of Julich.] {{at the head of}} it: but its troops or operations were never of a very forcible character. Kur-Brandenburg now joined it formally, as did many more; Kur-Sachsen, anxious to make himself convenient in other quarters, never would. Add to these phenomena, the now decisive appearance of a [...] "Catholic LIGA" [...] (League of Catholic Princes), which, by way of counterpoise to the [...] "Union," [...] had been got up by Duke Maximilian of Bavaria several months ago; and which now, under the same guidance, in these bad circumstances, took a great expansion of figure. Duke Maximilian, [...] "DONAUWORTH Max," [...] finding the Evangelical Union go so very high, and his own Kaiser like to be good for little in such business (poor hypochondriac Kaiser Rodolf II., more taken up with turning-looms and <b>blow-pipes</b> than with matters political, who accordingly is swept out of Julich in such summary way),--Donauworth Max has seen this a necessary institution in the present aspect.--Both [...] "Union" [...] and [...] "League" [...] rapidly waxed under the sound of the Julich cannon, as was natural.|$|R
60|$|I {{asked him}} to explain his meaning; for it now began to appear plain that in {{everything}} he had {{said he had been}} leading up to some very important matter. It would, of course, have been a great mistake to suppose that my savage was offering me a <b>blow-pipe</b> and a marketable virgin sister from purely disinterested motives.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'd {{climb up}} de porch an' {{into one of}} de bedrooms," [...] said Spike, almost blushing. He felt like a boy reading his first {{attempts}} at original poetry to an established critic. What would this master cracksman, this polished wielder of the oxy-acetylene <b>blow-pipe,</b> this expert in toxicology, microscopy and physics think of his callow outpourings! ...|$|E
60|$|Briggs {{removed the}} <b>blow-pipe</b> from its bellows and tube, and then {{adjusted}} the tube very carefully to the mouthpiece of the trumpet. Then with great deliberation {{he produced a}} piece of bees-waxed string {{from a number of}} other strange and filthy contents in his pocket and tied the tube to the mouthpiece. And then he began to work the treadle of the bellows.|$|E
6000|$|... “In {{the forest}} country the natives are {{generally}} ready enough to trade, {{but there are}} parts where they never allow a white party to penetrate. Whether it {{is that there is}} really a treasure, or an extraordinary rich gold-mine, or whether it is only that in some sections the tribes are more hostile than in others, no one knows for certain, but {{there is no doubt that}} when any party approaches certain localities troubles begin directly. As they go through the forest, arrows come flying thick through the tangle of creepers, and poisoned darts from <b>blow-pipes.</b> The foes are invisible, but they make themselves felt, and it soon breaks down the courage of the bravest to be shot at when you never get a chance of shooting back in return. Both Pita and Hurka have been with parties that have been attacked and forced to fall back; but it has not been their fault, for they always warn those who employ them that the dangers are too great to be overcome. Still, men who think that they have got a clue to hidden wealth always seem to consider that their guides are interested in preventing their getting it, and will listen to no advice till they find out for themselves that the danger has not been exaggerated, and that it is certain death to push on further.” ...|$|R
60|$|Next {{morning the}} cables wished {{to know whether}} {{he had found the}} crew of the Haliotis. They were to be found, freed and fed - he was to feed them - till such time as they could be sent to the nearest English port in a man-of-war. If you abuse a man long enough in great words flashed over the sea-beds, things happen. The Governor sent inland swiftly for his prisoners, who were also soldiers; and never was a militia {{regiment}} more anxious to reduce its strength. No power short of death could make these mad men wear the uniform of their service. They would not fight, except with their fellows, and it was for that reason the regiment had not gone to war, but stayed in a stockade, reasoning with the new troops. The autumn campaign had been a fiasco, but here were the Englishmen. All the regiment marched back to guard them, and the hairy enemy, armed with <b>blow-pipes,</b> rejoiced in the forest. Five of the crew had died, but there lined up on the Governor's verandah two-and-twenty men marked about the legs with the scars of leech-bites. A few of them wore fringes that had once been trousers; the others used loin-cloths of gay patterns; and they existed beautifully but simply in the Governor's verandah, and when he came out they sang at him. When you have lost seventy thousand pounds' worth of pearls, your pay, your ship, and all your clothes, and have lived in bondage for five months beyond the faintest pretences of civilisation, you know what true independence means, for you become the happiest of created things - natural man.|$|R

60|$|While he was yet speaking, Leetle Cub {{had taken}} up the long lance-like stick before {{mentioned}} and pointed it at the monkeys. It was a <b>blow-pipe.</b> Before Lawrence could interfere, the short arrow with which it was charged had sped on its mission with deadly aim, and the smallest monkey, relaxing its hold of the paternal tail, fell without even a cry into the water--shot through the heart.|$|E
60|$|After the {{excitement}} was over, Runi, who had maintained a dignified calm, made some roundabout remarks, apparently with {{the object of}} eliciting an account of what I had seen and heard in the forest of evil fame. I replied carelessly that I had seen a great many birds and monkeys--monkeys so tame that I might have procured one if I had had a <b>blow-pipe,</b> {{in spite of my}} never having practiced shooting with that weapon.|$|E
60|$|For {{though the}} fire was warm in front, behind was very cold. Pancrazio stuck a long pointed stick down the handle of a saucepan, and gave this utensil to Ciccio, to hold over the fire and scald the milk, whilst he put the tin coffee-pot in the ashes. He took a long iron tube or <b>blow-pipe,</b> which rested on two little feet at the far end. This he gave to Giovanni to blow the fire.|$|E
60|$|At Parahuari, {{where they}} arrived safely at last, they lived for some little time {{at one of}} the villages. But the child had an instinctive aversion to all savages, or {{possibly}} the feeling was derived from her mother, for it had shown itself early at Voa, where she had refused to learn their language; and this eventually led Nuflo to go away and live apart from them, in the forest by Ytaioa, where he made himself a house and garden. The Indians, however, continued friendly with him and visited him with frequency. But when Rima grew up, developing into that mysterious woodland girl I found her, they became suspicious, and in the end regarded her with dangerously hostile feeling. She, poor child, detested them because they were incessantly at war with the wild animals she loved, her companions; and having no fear of them, for she did not know that they had it in their minds to turn their little poisonous arrows against herself, she was constantly in the woods frustrating them; and the animals, in league with her, seemed to understand her note of warning and hid themselves or took to flight at the approach of danger. At length their hatred and fear grew {{to such a degree that}} they determined to make away with her, and one day, having matured a plan, they went to the wood and spread themselves two and two about it. The couples did not keep together, but moved about or remained concealed at a distance of forty or fifty yards apart, lest she should be missed. Two of the savages, armed with <b>blow-pipes,</b> were near the border of the forest on the side nearest to the village, and one of them, observing a motion in the foliage of a tree, ran swiftly and cautiously towards it to try and catch a glimpse of the enemy. And he did see her no doubt, as she was there watching both him and his companions, and blew an arrow at her, but even while in the act of blowing it he was himself struck by a dart that buried itself deep in his flesh just over the heart. He ran some distance with the fatal barbed point in his flesh and met his comrade, who had mistaken him for the girl and shot him. The wounded man threw himself down to die, and dying related that he had fired at the girl sitting up in a tree and that she had caught the arrow in her hand only to hurl it instantly back with such force and precision that it pierced his flesh just over the heart. He had seen it all with his own eyes, and his friend who had accidentally slain him believed his story and repeated it to the others. Rima had seen one Indian shoot the other, and when she told her grandfather he explained to her that it was an accident, but he guessed why the arrow had been fired.|$|R
6000|$|... "How did I know?" [...] he repeated. [...] "If {{you mean}} what first made me suspect, I couldn't tell you. It {{might have been}} one of a score of things. A jeweler can't say exactly how he gets on the track of fake stones. He can feel them. He can almost smell them. I worked with a jeweler once. That's how I got my {{knowledge}} of jewels. But, if you mean, can I prove what I say about this necklace, that's easy. There's no deception. It's simple. See here. These stones are supposed to be diamonds. Well, the diamond is the hardest stone in existence. Nothing will scratch it. Now, I've got a little ruby, out of a college pin, which I know is genuine. By rights, then, that ruby ought not to have scratched these stones. You follow that? But it did. It scratched two of them, the only two I tried. If you like, I can continue the experiment. But there's no need. I can tell you right now what these stones are, I said they were paste, but that wasn't quite accurate. They're a stuff called white jargoon. It's a stuff that's very easily faked. You work it with the flame of a <b>blow-pipe.</b> You don't want a full description, I suppose? Anyway, what happens is that the <b>blow-pipe</b> sets it up like a tonic. Gives it increased specific gravity and a healthy complexion and all sorts of great things of that kind. Two minutes in the flame of a <b>blow-pipe</b> is like a week at the seashore to a bit of white jargoon. Are you satisfied? If it comes to that, I guess you can hardly be expected to be. Convinced is a better word. Are you convinced, or do you hanker after tests like polarized light and refracting liquids?" ...|$|E
60|$|The <b>blow-pipe</b> {{which these}} Indians use is an ingeniously {{contrived}} weapon. It {{is made from}} a species of palm-tree. When an Indian wants one, {{he goes into the}} woods and selects a tree with a long slender stem of less than an inch in diameter; he extracts the pith out of this, and then cuts another stem, so much larger than the first that he can push the small tube into the bore of the large one,--thus the slight bend in one is counteracted by the other, and a perfectly straight pipe is formed. The mouth-piece is afterwards neatly finished off. The arrows used are very short, having a little ball of cotton at the end to fill the tube of the <b>blow-pipe.</b> The points are dipped in a peculiar poison, which has the effect of producing death when introduced into the blood by a mere scratch of the skin. The Indians can send these arrows an immense distance, and with unerring aim, as Martin and Barney had many an opportunity of witnessing during their long and weary journey on foot to the forest-home of the savages.|$|E
60|$|It {{was indeed}} {{interesting}} to watch that little fellow--who was evidently in all respects a thorough chip of the old block--as he went about his work, quietly, yet with an undercurrent of excitement which he was not entirely able to conceal. He took his bow and arrows, {{as well as the}} <b>blow-pipe,</b> on shore, and laid them at his side, so as to be ready at hand in case of emergency, while he baited the alligator-hook with the dead monkey.|$|E
6000|$|Agatha {{gave him}} a quiet, {{friendly}} look. [...] "It's lucky I have you to help, because I could not have gone far alone. I've studied Nature's laws in the laboratory, but in the bush she works on another scale. There's a difference between a <b>blow-pipe</b> flame and the subterranean fires. Now if I don't find the ore, it will be some comfort to know that I have properly tried." [...] She glanced at her wrist-watch and got up. [...] "It is later than I thought!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Immediately on obtaining it--for I have a presentiment, good people, {{that the}} prize is {{reserved}} to crown my scientific reputation--I shall return to Europe, and employ my remaining years in reducing {{it to its}} first elements. A portion of the stone will I grind to impalpable powder; other parts shall be dissolved in acids, or whatever solvents will act upon so admirable a composition; and the remainder I design to melt in the crucible, or set on fire with the <b>blow-pipe.</b> By these various methods I shall gain an accurate analysis, and finally bestow the result of my labors upon {{the world in a}} folio volume.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hardly that," [...] said he. [...] "When first I saw {{signs of}} strange weapons I was {{inclined}} to think so; but the remarkable character of the footmarks caused me to reconsider my views. Some of {{the inhabitants of the}} Indian Peninsula are small men, but none could have left such marks as that. The Hindoo proper has long and thin feet. The sandal-wearing Mohammedan has the great toe well separated from the others, because the thong is commonly passed between. These little darts, too, could only be shot in one way. They are from a <b>blow-pipe.</b> Now, then, where are we to find our savage?" ...|$|E
60|$|Again on {{the third}} day we were out {{together}} practicing at the birds--frightening if not killing them; but before noon, finding that it was his intention to go to a distant spot where he expected to meet with larger game, I left him and returned to the village. The <b>blow-pipe</b> practice had lost its novelty, and I did not care to go on all day and every day with it; more than that, I was anxious after so long an interval to pay a visit to my wood, as I began to call it, in the hope of hearing that mysterious melody which I had grown to love and to miss when even a single day passed without it.|$|E
6000|$|TWEENY (blankly). You and me? the Gov.! (Her head droops woefully. From without {{is heard}} the {{whistling}} of a happier spirit, and TWEENY draws herself up fiercely.) That's her; that's the thing what has stole his heart from me. (A stalwart youth {{appears at the}} window, so handsome and tingling with vitality that, glad to depose CRICHTON, we cry thankfully, 'The Hero at last.' But {{it is not the}} hero; it is the heroine. This splendid boy, clad in skins, is what nature has done for LADY MARY. She carries bow and arrows and a <b>blow-pipe,</b> and over her shoulder is a fat buck, which she drops with a cry of triumph. Forgetting to enter demurely, she leaps through the window.) (Sourly.)
