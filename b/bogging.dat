25|$|The last {{large-scale}} offensive of {{this period}} was a British attack (with French support) at Passchendaele (July–November 1917). This offensive opened with great promise for the Allies, before <b>bogging</b> down in the October mud. Casualties, though disputed, were roughly equal, at some 200,000–400,000 per side.|$|E
25|$|During {{the winters}} of 1941–42 and 1942–43, the T-34 had a marked {{advantage}} over German tanks through {{its ability to}} move over deep mud or snow — especially important in Russia's twice-annual rasputitsa mud seasons — without <b>bogging</b> down. The Panzer IV, its closest German equivalent at that time, used an inferior leaf-spring suspension and narrow track that tended to sink in such conditions.|$|E
25|$|Human {{recreational}} activities, such as {{off-road vehicles}} near wetlands, are also damaging its habitat. Lakes and streams are enjoyable areas for recreation, but human activity {{in these areas}} can degrade them. The use of off-road vehicles in or around wetlands, however, is the most damaging recreational activity. Mud <b>bogging</b> significantly damages and destroys these areas.

50|$|A <b>bog</b> pond (Moorauge) is a waterbody in {{the middle}} of a raised or kettle <b>bog,</b> {{formerly}} also in percolating mires (Durchströmungsmooren). It is also called a <b>bog</b> eye, raised <b>bog</b> kolk, <b>bog</b> kolk or just kolk. <b>Bog</b> ponds owe their existence to the growth of the <b>bog</b> body and are thus of biogenic origin. Brown <b>bog</b> ponds are surrounded by peat and receive their water exclusively from precipitation or from the large rain storage capacity of raised <b>bogs.</b> Such kolks generally represent the non-evaporating excess water of a <b>bog.</b> The central waterbody of these <b>bogs</b> exhibit almost no sedimentation.|$|R

25|$|However, {{the station}} did not remain a Fox {{affiliate}} for long. By 1988, KMSP {{was one of}} several Fox affiliates nationwide that were disappointed with the network's weak programming offerings, particularly on Saturday nights, which were <b>bogging</b> down KMSP's otherwise successful independent lineup. That January, channel 9 dropped Fox's Saturday night lineup; the move did not sit well with Fox, and in July 1988 the network announced that it would not renew its affiliations with KMSP and Chris-Craft sister station KPTV in Portland, Oregon. Fox then signed an agreement with KITN (channel 29, now WFTC) to become its new Twin Cities affiliate, and KMSP reverted to being an independent station full-time. In 1992, the station relocated to its current studio facilities on Viking Drive in Eden Prairie. Along with the other United Television stations, KMSP carried programming from the Prime Time Entertainment Network from 1993 to 1995.|$|E
25|$|The Second Battle of El Alamein {{began on}} 23 October 1942, and ended 12 days later {{with one of}} the first large-scale, decisive Allied land {{victories}} of the war. Montgomery correctly predicted both the length of the battle and the number of casualties (13,500). Soon after Allied armoured units and infantry broke through the German and Italian lines and were pursuing the enemy forces at speed along the coast road, a violent rainstorm burst over the region, <b>bogging</b> down the tanks and support trucks in the desert mud. Montgomery, standing before his officers at headquarters and close to tears, announced that he was forced to call off the pursuit. Historian Corelli Barnett has pointed out that the rain also fell on the Germans, and that the weather is therefore an inadequate explanation for the failure to exploit the breakthrough, but nevertheless the Battle of El Alamein had been a great success. Over 30,000 prisoners of war were taken, including the German second-in-command, General von Thoma, as well as eight other general officers. Rommel, having been in a hospital in Germany {{at the start of the}} battle, was forced to return on 25 October 1942 after Stumme – his replacement as German commander – died of a heart attack in the early hours of the battle.|$|E
25|$|Star Wars: Bounty Hunter began {{life when}} LucasArts {{was asked to}} make an Episode II-based game which {{featured}} Jango Fett. In March 2001 game design documents were presented, and development began shortly after. The PlayStation 2 and Nintendo GameCube versions of the game have different custom in-house graphics engines, each designed specifically {{to take advantage of}} the two platforms' unique strengths and work around their unique limitations, but the core game engine is identical. In the PS2 version they took advantage of both vector unit (VU) chips to drive the graphics to maximum performance. The DMA bandwidth was taken advantage of to use a high number of textures. There is full-screen antialiasing and texture mip mapping support. They used the second VU1 chip to handle all the character skinning and VU0 to handle all the skeletal animation transforms. Which enabled dozens of characters to be on-screen without <b>bogging</b> down the frame rate. They had 10 individually optimized rendering loops on VU1 to speed up the rendering process. Their PS2 graphics engine could move 10,000,000 triangles per second, and adding the gameplay, collision, logic, textures, sound would go down accordingly to around 30,000 to 50,000 triangles per frame, all at an average frame rate of 30 frames per second.|$|E

Another 40 aircraft followed in the afternoon, many containing American and Australian engineers. The 871st followed the next day with its small air-portable bulldozers and graders. They located a site for a new airstrip, which became known as No. 1, the existing one becoming No. 2. The site proved to be an excellent one; an old, dry riverbed with soil largely composed of gravel. A gravel base and steel plank was laid to accommodate the fighters based at Tsili Tsili that were in danger of <b>bogging</b> down when the weather deteriorated.

40|$|In {{restoration}} {{planning for}} damaged raised <b>bogs,</b> the lagg at the <b>bog</b> margin {{is often not}} given considerable weight and is sometimes disregarded entirely. However, the lagg is critical for the proper functioning of the <b>bog,</b> as it supports the water mound in the <b>bog.</b> In order to include the lagg in a restoration plan for a raised <b>bog,</b> {{it is necessary to}} understand the hydrological characteristics and functions of this rarely studied transition zone. We studied 13 coastal British Columbia (BC) <b>bogs</b> and identified two different gradients in depth to water table, hydrochemistry and peat properties: (1) a local <b>bog</b> expanse–bog margin gradient, and (2) a regional gradient related to climate and proximity to the ocean. Depth to water table generally increased across the transition from <b>bog</b> expanse to <b>bog</b> margin. In the <b>bog</b> expanse, pH was above 4. 2 in the Pacific Oceanic wetland region (cooler and wetter climate) and below 4. 3 in the Pacific Temperate wetland region (warmer and drier climate). Both pH and pH-corrected electrical conductivity increased significantly across the transition from <b>bog</b> expanse to <b>bog</b> margin, though not in all cases. Na + and Mg 2 + concentrations were generally highest in exposed, oceanic <b>bogs</b> and lower in inland <b>bogs.</b> Ash content in peat samples increased across the <b>bog</b> expanse–bog margin transition, and appears to be a useful abiotic indicator of the location of the <b>bog</b> margin.

500|$|Walter was reputed for his bravery, {{bordering}} on recklessness, and was confident of success, {{as evidenced by}} his haughty reply to the 500 mercenaries. Walter's pride and arrogance, combined with his numerical advantage and his innate belief in the superiority of heavy noble cavalry over infantry, led him to fatally underestimate his opponent and order a charge across even such an adverse terrain. Impatient for action, according to Muntaner Walter formed a cavalry line of 200 Frankish knights [...] "with golden spurs", followed by the infantry, and placed himself with his banner in the vanguard. The Frankish attack failed, but the reason is unclear; Muntaner's description is short and provides no details, while Gregoras states that the heavy Frankish cavalry got completely stuck in the mud, with the Almogavars, lightly armed with swords and darts, dispatching the knights, encumbered by their heavy armour. This is the commonly accepted version among scholars as well. The Chronicle of the Morea {{on the other hand}} implies that the battle was hard-fought, which as military historian Kelly DeVries notes seems to contradict Gregoras, and that the marsh possibly simply reduced the impact of the charge instead of <b>bogging</b> it down entirely. What is clear is that the Catalans held, and that the Duke and most of his men fell. As the two lines clashed, the Turkish auxiliaries, reassured {{that this was not a}} ruse, descended from their camp upon the Athenian army, panicking and routing what remained of it.|$|E

[...] Lamb also added that Jepsen's [...] "style is summery and bright without the emotional <b>bogging</b> down of [...] Lovato or the flat out drudgery of Jessie J" [...] Allmusic critic Jon O'Brien stated that, when compared to Jepsen's previous effort Tug of War (2008), the EP [...] "unexpectedly abandons her previous singer/songwriter approach {{in favor of an}} unashamed bubblegum sound which harks back to the early 2000s pop princess glory days of Britney, Christina, Jessica, and Mandy." [...] Fiona Eadie of Cadence Canada described the musical style of the album as [...] "pop. But not in the annoying, auto-tune, and talentless way. Her perfectly pitched voice makes it clear that this girl has real talent." [...] Eadie summarized her review saying that Curiosity [...] "is filled with music that dances. And it is your choice to listen to it with or without a hairbrush (a.k.a. microphone) in front of your bedroom mirror. Overall a great EP.
