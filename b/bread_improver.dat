40|$|One of the {{relevant}} problems of modern bakery is using raw material – wheat flour – of unstable quality. Nowadays, in order to stabilize the baking properties of wheat flour from grains with lower technological potential and to improve the bread quality, complex <b>bread</b> <b>improvers</b> based on soya flour with lipoxygenase activity have been made and are widely used. Lipoxygenase is important for bakery, plays {{an essential role in}} oxidative processes that affects the structural-mechanical properties of dough and color of the bread crumbs. Seeds of legume crops which include the research object – lentils – have the highest lipoxygenase activity. The paper presents the study of the effect of four types of lentils (green, yellow, red, pardina) on the baking properties of wheat flour and bread quality characteristics, and assesses the possibilities of their use as a functional basis with enzyme (lipoxygenase) activity during development of complex <b>bread</b> <b>improvers.</b> It is shown that the investigated types of lentils strengthen the flour gluten, increase the activity of baker's yeast fermentation and improve the quality of bread.

40|$|During breadmaking, a {{continuous}} protein network is formed which confers visco-elasticity to dough.

A good quality (highly elastic) gluten network retains the carbon dioxide that is produced by the yeast, giving dough and bread with optimal properties. However, the properties of the gluten proteins can differ substantially between wheat flours and are highly dependent on genetic, environmental and post-harvest conditions. Deficiencies in wheat quality for breadmaking can be overcome by incorporating exogenous components which alter the functionality of the gluten proteins during breadmaking. These include additives (e. g. potassium bromate, iodate, chlorine dioxide and chlorine, azodicarbonamide, ascorbic acid and peroxides) and enzymes affecting protein crosslinking.

It is therefore almost impossible to obtain bread with consistent quality without determining the flour's suitability for bread-making {{and the addition of}} <b>bread</b> <b>improvers.</b> Rheological tests such as the farinograph and the mixograph which are commonly used by bakeries to predict flour quality are empirical in nature which makes fundamental interpretation of the results difficult. The stress relaxation test, a more fundamental rheological test, was used in combination with the mixograph to determine if the stress relaxation test can provide additional information to the mixograph on prediction of the effect of ascorbic acid and DATEM on bread-making quality of three different flour samples. In this test, an optimally developed ball of dough was compressed between parallel plates of a TA-XT 2 texture analyser. The 20 g dough was compressed to a load of 1. 5 N and thereafter allowed to relax at constant deformation. The relaxation time (RT) was recorded as time taken for the compression force to decay to a force of 0. 65 N. Longer RT indicated better flour quality. RT was compared with the mixograph peak time and peak height as predictors of the effect of ascorbic acid and DATEM on bread quality. Test bakes were carried out, and concentrations of ascorbic acid and DATEM were varied as in the stress relaxation test and the mixograph test. At the various stages of the baking process several dough and bread properties were assessed subjectively and scored according to a standardised scoring system. The mixograph was successful in characterising untreated flours in terms of bread-making quality and the stress relaxation test did not provide additional information in this regard. The mixograph was better able to predict the effect of improvers on the stronger Lelie while the stress relaxation test was better at predicting improver effect (especially of DATEM) on the weaker flours, Tiger and Silver Queen. The mixograph predicted the improving effect of DATEM on Tiger and Silver Queen up to a peak, followed by no further improvement. The stress relaxation test predicted improvement beyond the peak, and this continued improvement was observed in the test bake and strong correlation (p<O. 05) was found between effect of DATEM on RTs and these important test bake parameters: baking height, loaf volume, drop baking height and the bread score. In addition to information on mixing properties provided by the mixograph, RT seemed to be predicting dough's stability, related to its gas-retaining properties. This stability which can be enhanced by DATEM may be related to both the extensibility of dough's gluten matrix and the stability of the liquid film surrounding the gluten matrix.

40|$|Due to {{unfavourable}} climatic conditions, {{the production}} of wheat in Mozambique {{is not sufficient to}} satisfy national food industrial needs and substantial quantities must be imported at high cost. Bread is currently produced basically using wheat flour. Therefore, this thesis examined the partial replacement of wheat flour by cassava-maize flours in the Mozambican bread manufacturing context and looked for ways of improving bread quality at high wheat flour substitution. The effect of cassava pre-treatment (sun drying, roasting and fermentation), cassava level (20, 30 and 40 %) and the addition of a baking improver, high methoxyl pectin (HM pectin) at two levels 1 and 3 %, were evaluated for the bread quality parameters of loaf volume, crumb firmness, and crust colour. The loaf volume decreased by 20 to 30 % in comparison with the wheat reference bread as a result of added cassava flour that had been pre-treated in different ways. Increasing the cassava level reduced the loaf volume except for bread with roasted cassava, which even increased in volume with the addition of high level HM pectin; the crumb firmness was higher in composite bread with sun-dried and fermented cassava flour compared with wheat bread, although the composite bread with roasted cassava flour with 3 % HM pectin had a crumb firmness similar to wheat bread. Bread baked with roasted cassava flour also had a crust colour similar to wheat bread. The roasting pre-treatment of cassava flour along with baking improvers was indicated to have a good potential to improve the baking quality of composite cassava-maize-wheat breads. Two hydrocolloids, HM pectin and carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), were added alone or in combination with three different emulsifiers (DATEM, LC and SSL) in formulation of composite cassava-maize-wheat (ratio 40 : 10 : 50) breads in order to gain knowledge of their effect on bread quality characteristics. Each emulsifier was tested in combination with the hydrocolloids at the levels of 0. 1, 0. 3 and 0. 5 %, while hydrocolloids were used at the level of 3 %. It was concluded that the hydrocolloids in combination with emulsifiers had a greater effect than hydrocolloids alone in increasing the specific volume (from 7. 5 to 22 %) and the brownness index (from 81. 8 to 86. 6 %) and reducing the crumb firmness of the breads (from 14 to 36 %). Two composite cassava-maize-wheat breads with either CMC/DATEM or HM pectin/LC, both at levels of 3 / 0. 3 %, were assessed for their acceptability and sensorial attributes among Mozambican consumers. The consumption pattern, willingness to buy and attributes of the composite breads were also collected. It was concluded that the optimized composite bread with 40 % roasted cassava and CMC/DATEM was highly acceptable (score of 7. 47 out of 9) and comparable to commercial wheat bread (score of 7. 82 out of 9). Instrumental analysis of crust and crumb colour and firmness correlated highly with their perceived sensorial properties of its counterpart. Texture, moisture content and starch retrogradation (recrystallized amylopectin) of optimized composite bread were evaluated during storage up to four days under controlled conditions (23 oC and 50 % RH). In addition to the improvers used in the sensory analysis, monoglyceride (MG) was evaluated for its role on the bread quality during storage of those composite breads.

40|$|The most {{abundant}} polysaccharide on earth, next to cellulose, is (arabino) xylan, an important constituent of cereal seed cell walls. It is largely degraded by xylanases. In cereals, these enzymes are mainly responsible for cell wall remodelling and degradation upon germination. The best-studied xylanases, however, originate from bacteria and fungi {{where they are}} involved in plant infection and in the decay of dead organic material. They are one of the enzymes produced by microorganisms to degrade the plant cell wall and to, in this manner, invade the plant tissues. Next to their role in plant infection, xylanases have also been well studied because of their application in cereal-based industrial processes. They are used as process, yield or product improvers in a range of different processes. Xylanases are nowadays inherently present in most <b>bread</b> <b>improvers,</b> as they beneficially affect bread volume and processibility of doughs. They can also be used in beer production, feeds and gluten-starch separation. In 1997, the occurrence of xylanase inhibiting proteins in wheat was discovered. Since then, two different types of xylanase inhibitors have been described, namely Triticum aestivum xylanase inhibitor (TAXI) and xylanase inhibitor protein (XIP) type inhibitors. More recently, during the purification of these two xylanase inhibitors from wheat whole meal, a third type of xylanase inhibitors was discovered. The research described in this doctoral thesis aimed at purifying and fully characterising this new type of xylanase inhibitor from wheat. Subsequently, it aimed at contributing to an increased understanding on the physiological role of plant xylanase inhibitors. Two different methods to purify this novel protein, starting from wheat whole meal, were developed. The first method is based on the difference in affinity for xylanases between the three types of xylanase inhibitors, while in the second method TAXI and XIP (and other proteins) are selectively precipitated using a methanolic ammonium acetate solution. The inhibitor is then isolated from the supernatant with affinity chromatography with immobilised xylanases. The first method is very convenient when all three types of inhibitors are needed, but it is rather time consuming when the only objective is to purify the last discovered one. The yield for the latter inhibitor with both methods is in the range of 2 to 4 mg per kg whole meal. Subsequently, the novel inhibitor was characterised. It is a basic protein (pI > 9. 3) and has a molecular mass (MM) of approximately 18 kDa, which makes it the smallest xylanase inhibitor from wheat. It occurs in different forms with varying degrees of glycosylation. Its glycan moiety/moieties are mostly O-bound. Little, if any, N-bound sugars are present. The amino acid sequence shows homology to thaumatin and contains the consensus sequence of the thaumatin protein family. Therefore, the new inhibitor is called thaumatin-like xylanase inhibitor (TLXI). Much as for other thaumatin-like proteins (TLPs), TLXI is a very stable protein both under extreme thermal and pH conditions. It is also quite resistant towards proteolytic attack by pepsin. Much as for other TLPs, the stability of TLXI can probably be ascribed to the presence of several intramolecular disulfide bridges. The three dimensional structure model of TLXI, generated with the crystal structure of the thaumatin protein as template, indeed shows that all (ten) cysteine residues are involved in five disulfide bridges. Furthermore, it maintains that TLXI contains 12 β-strands, organised in 3 β-sheets, and no α-helices. Experimental evidence to confirm these structural features was provided. The experimental work allows concluding that TLXI is generally active towards xylanases of glycoside hydrolase family (GH) 11 with low pH optimum (pH ≤ 6. 0). No inhibition activity was seen towards GH 10 xylanases, proteases or α-amylases. The inhibition activity of TLXI is generally maximal at pH conditions around pH 5. 0 and at temperatures around 40 °C. In contrast to what could be observed for the other cereal xylanase inhibitors, the interaction between TLXI and xylanases does not occur in or near the active site. TLXI inhibits in a non-competitive manner, while TAXI and XIP are competitive inhibitors. In addition, TLXI is slow-tight-binding. The interaction between TLXI and a GH 11 xylanase of T. longibrachiatum (XTL 1) occurs in a single slow step and is characterised by a Ki of approximately 60 nM. The Ki value is thus situated in the nanomolar range, much as for the other cereal xylanase inhibitors. The TLXI levels in whole meals of different wheat cultivars are, in general, approximately 10 and 30 times lower than the TAXI and XIP levels, respectively. In other cereals seeds, the levels of TLXI homologues, if present, seem also lower than those of TAXI and XIP homologues, if present. In rye and barley, protein bands that cross-react with antibodies raised against wheat TLXI were detected in the fraction recovered after affinity chromatography with immobilised xylanases. In barley, this protein had a MM of approximately 27 kDa, while that in rye had a MM of 18 kDa. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the latter was identical to that of TLXI from wheat and that of the protein expressed by the putative rye tlxi gene, confirming the actual expression of this gene in rye. We could not identify a TLXI homologue in barley. Because the accumulation of different TLPs during fruit ripening has been described, different fruits were also studied for the occurrence of TLXI homologues. A 26 kDa kiwi protein, of which the N-terminal amino acid sequence was identical to that of a thaumatin-like kiwi allergen with antifungal activity, binds to immobilised xylanases but does not inhibit xylanases in solution. In contrast, a similar protein fraction from apple displayed xylanase inhibition activity. The cross-reactivity with anti-TLXI antibodies and the MM of the protein present in this fraction suggest that the protein is similar to that in kiwi, but no N-terminal amino acid sequence could be determined. Finally in banana, a 21 kDa protein was found, which shows inhibition activity towards GH 11 xylanases of Bacillus subtilis (XBS) and Aspergillus niger (XAN 11), but no cross-reactivity with the anti-TLXI antibodies. This suggests the presence of an unknown type of xylanase inhibitors in banana. During the study of the kinetic parameters, it came to light that TLXI not only interacts with xylanases, but also with arabinoxylan. As polysaccharide binding had already been reported for XIP, a profound study of the interaction of all three xylanase inhibitors with polysaccharides was performed. It revealed that all types of inhibitors can bind to (arabino) xylans and that their affinity increases with decreasing arabinose to xylose ratio. The highest level of binding was observed for TLXI. In addition, interaction with certain β-glucans was observed for all inhibitors, though this binding was less pronounced than that to (arabino) xylans. For TLPs, a correlation exists between the binding to polysaccharides and their antifungal activity. In addition, a role in plant defence has been suggested for xylanase inhibitors, without insight in the exact mechanism. The present PhD research studied their direct effect on fungal growth. The hyphal growth of Fusarium graminearum and Rhizoctonia solani was inhibited by XIP and TAXI, respectively, when a medium with glucose as only carbon source was used. Since xylan was absent in the medium, xylanase inhibition activity is probably not the cause of this antifungal activity. When medium with xylan as only carbon source was used, the halo expansion, caused by xylanase activity of Penicillium expansum and Aspergillus flavus, was retarded by all three inhibitors. No effect on the hyphal growth on the latter medium was observed. In short, this dissertation describes the purification and full characterisation of a recently discovered type of xylanase inhibitors, which belongs to the thaumatin family. Furthermore, it contributes to the unravelling of the function of xylanase inhibitors by demonstrating their binding affinity for polysaccharides and their inhibitory effect on fungal growth. status: publishe...|$|R

COXMn catalyses the oxidation of various monosaccharides as well as maltooligosaccharides for which the best activity is obtained towards the maltooligosaccharides of polymerisation degrees 3 and 4. For the same activity towards glucose under air saturation, we show that COXMn exhibits a similar efficiency towards maltose as GOX towards glucose whatever the oxygen supply. Assays with COXMn show that no competition exists between carbohydrates naturally present in the wheat flour. We show that reaction products (d-glucono-δ-lactone and hydrogen peroxide) and the wheat flour dough component, ferulic acid, have no noticeable specific effect on the COXMn activity. The demonstrated differences in kinetics between COXMn and GOX allow predicting of differences in the functional behaviours of those enzymes during wheat flour dough formation...|$|E

Enrichment {{of the active}} component is possible by anion-exchange fractionation with diethylaminoethyl-cellulose (DEAE), by ammonium sulfate precipitation, or by using rye bran or shorts milling fractions as the starting material. The active material was not bound to DEAE-cellulose. With ammonium sulfate precipitation, the fractions obtained at 30, 40, and 50 % saturation were active in straight-dough baking experiments. Iso-electric focusing revealed that fractions active in breadmaking invariably contained alkaline protein fractions (pI > 7. 5). Inactivation of enzyme material by boiling the water-soluble extract from rye destroyed all breadmaking activity. The activity of the <b>bread</b> <b>improver</b> was additive to that of potassium bromate but not to that of ascorbic acid.

30|$|The {{high cost}} of {{traditional}} industrial lipases restricted their use in biofuel production, but the current availability of the recombinant purified in sufficiently high quantities has helped to achieve the economic viability as the crucial factors affecting productivity of enzymatic biodiesel synthesis are the suitable raw materials and the selected lipase. The stability and catalytic efficiency of the latter can be improved by optimizing reaction conditions such as substrate concentrations, temperature, water activity, and alkaline concentration of the enzyme's microenvironment [23]. In this respect, although Ecodiesel was initially obtained using pig pancreatic lipases (PPL), remarkable results have been also obtained with a low-cost purified microbial lipase, Lipopan 50 BG (Novozymes A/S, Bagsværd, Denmark) [15], from Thermomyces lanuginosus microorganism, usually used as bread emulsifier (<b>bread</b> <b>improver)</b> [24]. To our knowledge, this lipase has not {{been described as a}} biocatalyst in any chemical process. The application of an available lipase on an industrial scale is a significant approximation to get an economically feasible biofuel production by enzymatic method. However, this lipase has a main drawback: it cannot be reused, since the purified lipase extract is meant to be in a soluble form.|$|E

Potassium bromate is an additive widely employed by bread makers to improve bread quality. On account of its deleterious effect and carcinogenicity in humans, certain levels of potassium bromate {{are not allowed}} in bread. The present evaluation {{was carried out in}} Awka Metropolis where consumption of bread is relatively high. Ten (10) different samples of bread obtained from different locations were analysed for potassium bromate and were then fed to Wistar rats for toxicological analysis. The quantitative assessment showed that all the bread samples contained potassium bromated in quantity that exceeded the minimum allowed by the FDA. The level of bromate in the bread samples ranged between 5. 309 + 0. 023 ppm to 9. 136 + 0. 024 ppm. The result of the toxicological study showed that there were significant increases(p< 0. 05) in the ALT and AST activities of the animal groups fed with bread samples containing 8. 52 and 9. 14 ppm of potassium bromate. This showed that the bread samples containing potassium bromate at the levels of 8. 52 and above were unsafe for human consumption.

40|$|The {{feasibility}} of partially replacing wheat flour with malted rice flour in bread making was evaluated in several formulations, aiming {{to find a}} formulation {{for the production of}} malted rice-wheat bread with better nutritional quality and consumer acceptance. The whole grains of a local rice variety (Oryza sativa L. subsp. indica var. Mottaikaruppan) were steeped in distilled water (12 h, 30 °C) and germinated for 3 days to obtain high content of soluble materials and amylase activity in bread making. The quality of bread was evaluated by considering the physical and sensorial parameters. When the wheat flour was substituted with malted rice flour, 35 % substitution level and the malted rice flour from 3 days of germination was the best according to the physical and sensory qualities of bread. The quality of bread was improved by the addition of 20 g of margarine, 20 g of baking powder and 20 g of yeast in 1 kg of flour. Among different ratios of yeast and baking powder, 2 : 1 was the best. <b>Bread</b> <b>improver</b> containing amylases and oxidizing agents at the concentration of 40 g/kg was selected as the best concentration. When comparing the final formulation made in the bakery with wheat bread, malted rice-wheat bread contains more soluble dietary fiber (0. 62 %), insoluble dietary fiber (3. 95 %), total dietary fiber (4. 57 %) and free amino acid content (0. 64 g/kg) than those in wheat bread (0. 5 %, 2. 73 %, 3. 23 % and 0. 36 g/kg, respectively) ...|$|E

Wheat flour as white bread ingredients containing high starch {{and it is a}} source of nutrients for microorganisms. Therefore, it is required the addition of presentatives into the white bread dough to extend the USAge period. Harmful food additives should not be present in food. One of them is borax. The purpose of this research was was to determine whether there is borax in branded and unbranded white bread that is sold in Padang Bulan Subdistrict, Medan. The research was a descriptive survey to determine the presence of borax in branded and unbranded white bread. The results showed that laboratory test result with flame test methods and the reaction of curcumin, there was no branded and unbranded white bread containing borax. Presentative which used in some white bread is calcium propionate and acetic acid. Food additives such as emulsifiers, acidity regulator and <b>bread</b> <b>improver</b> including packaging and storage procedure can affect the quality and USAge period of white bread. It can be concluded that white bread is safe to consume because it does not contain borax for the purpose of preservation.
