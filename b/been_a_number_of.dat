5|$|The {{climb up}} or down from the summit plateau onto Swirral Edge is another well known {{accident}} spot. In winter it involves climbing down another snow cornice onto steep icy ground.

40|$|Abstract: In {{this work}} we propose an {{approach}} to prioritizing order of transmission of sensed data in wireless sensor network that are very popular in, for example, environmental monitoring. The approach is based on determination of a consensus relation which is in "nearest distance " from all initial rankings shaped by multiple sensors of each network node. Statistically and probabilistically based analytical models useful for assuring network performance and providing reasonable number values n – k and m are proposed and discussed, where n – k <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> packets transmitted to the sink; n <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> the network sensor nodes; k <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> dropped packets due to a congestion; and m <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> node sensors (or rankings) ...|$|R

A further flood struck in 2002, badly damaging nearby installations.|$|E
5|$|A key {{influence}} on the plot of The Calculus Affair was an article that Hergé had read in a February 1954 issue of the Belgian weekly La Face à Main, reporting that there had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> incidents along the road from Portsmouth to London in southern England in which motorists' car windscreens had spontaneously shattered; the article's author suggested {{that it may have}} been caused by experiments undertaken in a nearby secret facility. To develop this plot further, Hergé consulted Professor , an astrophysicist at Liège.|$|E
5|$|A more {{substantial}} Bronze Age settlement {{is known to}} have existed; the remains of what may have been a causeway were discovered in 1934, in the form of wooden piles unearthed by a farmer between Little Thetford and nearby Barway. A Bronze Age ring and a late Bronze Age sherd were excavated nearby. There have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> Bronze Age finds in the area, including a pre–701BC palstave at nearby Fordey farm, Barway, and at Little Thetford, a middle Bronze Age (1600–1001BC) rapier in 1953, and a late Bronze Age flesh-hook in 1929.|$|E

5|$|After {{missions}} {{discovered the}} reality of the harsh nature of the planet's surface, attention shifted towards other targets such as Mars. There have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> proposed missions afterwards however, and many of these involve the little-known upper atmosphere. The Soviet Vega program in 1985 dropped two balloons into the atmosphere, but these were battery-powered and lasted for only about two Earth days each before running out of power. Since then, there has been no exploration of the upper atmosphere. In 2002, the NASA contractor Global Aerospace proposed a balloon that would be capable of staying in the upper atmosphere for hundreds of Earth days as opposed to two.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the end of}} the Cold War {{there have}} <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> {{attempts}} to curb military activity or even abolish the armed forces altogether. A notable referendum on the subject, launched by an anti-militarist group, was held on 26 November 1989. It was defeated with about two thirds of the voters against the proposal. A similar referendum, called for before, but held shortly after the 11 September attacks in the US, was defeated by over 78% of voters.|$|E

5|$|It is not {{a unique}} case among English medieval monasteries that almost nothing has survived of what must have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> books owned by the house as such or in the keeping of {{individual}} monks. These would include at least a small library with biblical texts, spiritual works and perhaps some books on practical subjects, bearing {{in mind that the}} management of the abbey plant would have been a considerable challenge. Furthermore, the celebration of the liturgy for {{a large part of the}} day and night would necessitate texts for the different participants, who as monks were for the most part not spectators but active participants, some of them with particular roles.|$|E
5|$|Middle Anglia as a {{political}} entity may have been created by Penda {{as an expression of}} Mercian power in the area following his victories over the East Angles. Previously there seem to have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> small peoples inhabiting the region, and Penda's establishment of Peada as a subking there may have marked their initial union under one ruler. The districts corresponding to Shropshire and Herefordshire, along Mercia's western frontier near Wales, probably also fell under Mercian domination at this time. Here a king called Merewalh ruled over the Magonsaete; in later centuries it was said that Merewalh was a son of Penda, but this is considered uncertain. Stenton, for example, considered it likely that Merewalh was a representative of a local dynasty that continued to rule under Mercian domination.|$|E
5|$|Since 2006, {{there have}} <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> {{terrorist}} attacks, including explosions in a landmark holy place, a court and a temple.

At least 28 {{people were killed and}} as many as 101 others were injured. The blasts occurred simultaneously shortly after 18:00 IST. The first blast took place at 18:20 in the crowded Sankat Mochan Hanuman Temple near the Banaras Hindu University. Other blasts followed at the Varanasi Cantonment Railway Station near the waiting area next to the travel office.

Real Madrid has the fourth-highest of the average attendances of European football clubs, behind only Borussia Dortmund, Barcelona and Manchester United.|$|E
5|$|The {{novel was}} {{initially}} published as a serial in Kwee's magazine Panorama; {{it proved to}} be his most popular work. By 1930 there had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> stage adaptations, not all of which were authorised, leading Kwee to ask readers to help him enforce his copyright. The work was filmed in 1931 by The Teng Chun and then in 1975 by Fred Young and Rempo Urip. Though not considered part of the Indonesian literary canon, the book ranks amongst the most reprinted works of Chinese Malay literature. It has been translated into Dutch and English.|$|E
5|$|There have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> {{documented}} {{cases in}} which a female shark {{who has not been}} in contact with a male has conceived a sharklet on her own through parthenogenesis. The details of this process are not well understood, but genetic fingerprinting showed that the sharklets had no paternal genetic contribution, ruling out sperm storage. The extent of this behavior in the wild is unknown, as is whether other species have this capability. Mammals are now the only major vertebrate group in which asexual reproduction has not been observed.|$|E
