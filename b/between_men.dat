Law 13,010 established the equality of political rights <b>between</b> <b>men</b> and women and universal suffrage in Argentina. Finally, Law 13,010 was approved unanimously. In a public celebration and ceremony, however, Juan Perón signed the law granting women the right to vote, and then he handed the bill to Eva, symbolically making it hers.|$|E
5000|$|Sins {{between people}} are {{considered}} much more severe in Judaism than sins <b>between</b> <b>man</b> and God. Yom Kippur, the main day of repentance in Judaism can atones for sins <b>between</b> <b>man</b> and God, {{but not for}} sins <b>between</b> <b>man</b> and his fellow, that is until he has appeased his friend. Eleazar ben Azariah derived from the verse: [...] "From all your sins before God you shall be cleansed" [...] (Book of Leviticus,16:30) - for sins <b>between</b> <b>man</b> and God Yom Kippur atones, but for sins <b>between</b> <b>man</b> and his fellow Yom Kippur does not atone until he appeases his fellow.|$|R

5|$|Female {{homosexuality}} has {{not received}} the same negative response from religious or criminal authorities as male homosexuality or adultery has throughout history. Whereas sodomy <b>between</b> <b>men,</b> men and women, and men and animals was punishable by death in Britain, acknowledgment of sexual contact between women was nonexistent in medical and legal texts. The earliest law against female homosexuality appeared in France in 1270. In Spain, Italy, and the Holy Roman Empire, sodomy between women was included in acts considered unnatural and punishable by burning to death, although few instances are recorded of this taking place.|$|E
5|$|Historically, among certain Asian and Native American {{cultures}} {{the family}} structure {{consisted of a}} grandmother and her children, especially daughters, who raised their own children together and shared child care responsibilities.

Romantic relationships <b>between</b> <b>men</b> and women were formed and dissolved with little impact on the children who remained in the mother's extended family.|$|E

40|$|This thesis explores how Herman Melville's {{depiction}} of the relationship <b>between</b> <b>Man</b> and Wilderness in his collection of short stories, The Piazza Tales, critiques the social reform movements of the mid-nineteenth century. By highlighting how Melville's portrayal of the relationship <b>between</b> <b>Man</b> and Wilderness parallels that seen in Early American survey writing texts such as Notes on the State of Virginia as well as midnineteenth century nature writing texts such as Walden, this thesis asserts that Melville is showing how {{the evolution of the}} relationship <b>between</b> <b>Man</b> and Wilderness retains an inherent level of subjugation. Similarly, by showing how Melville's text parallels the relationship <b>between</b> <b>Man</b> and Wilderness with that of Man and subjugated Man, this thesis suggests that Melville was making a claim that, due to the inherent subjugation that exists within the American social structure, the social reform movements of the mid- 19 th century would, ultimately, be ineffective-a reality which is apparent in the persistence of social, racial, and economical stratification in early 21 st century America. Chapter 1 synthesizes G. W. F. Hegel's Master-Slave Dialectic and Bill Brown's "Thing Theory" in order to demonstrate how Melville's {{depiction of}} the relationship <b>between</b> <b>Man</b> and Wilderness mirrors the relationship <b>between</b> <b>Man</b> and Subjugated Man. Chapter 2 explores the parallels between Thomas Jefferson's Notes on the State of Virginia, Melville's {{depiction of the}} relationship <b>between</b> <b>Man</b> and Wilderness in "The Piazza," "The Lightning Rod Man," "The Encantadas," and "The Belltower," and the treatment of subjugated peoples in pre-Westward Movement America. Chapter 3 examines how Melville's portrayal of the relationship <b>between</b> <b>Man</b> and Wilderness in "The Piazza," "The Lightening Rod Man," "The Belltower," and "Bartleby the Scrivener" imitates that of mid-nineteenth-century Americ...|$|R
5|$|History {{is often}} {{analyzed}} with contemporary ideologies; Ancient Greece {{as a subject}} enjoyed popularity by the ruling class in Britain during the 19th century. Based on their social priorities, British scholars interpreted ancient Greece as a westernized, white, and masculine society, and essentially removed women from historical importance. Women in Greece were sequestered with each other, and men with men. In this homosocial environment, erotic and sexual relationships between males were common and recorded in literature, art, and philosophy. Hardly anything is recorded about homosexual activity between women. There is some speculation that similar relationships existed between women and girls. The poet Alcman used the term aitis, as the feminine form of aites—which was the official term for the younger participant in a pederastic relationship. Aristophanes, in Plato's Symposium, mentions women who love women, but uses the term trepesthai (to be focused on) instead of eros, which was applied to other erotic relationships <b>between</b> <b>men,</b> and <b>between</b> <b>men</b> and women.|$|E
5|$|In 1921 Margaret Mackworth, now {{the second}} Viscountess Rhondda, {{launched}} the Six Point Group, an action group that focused {{heavily on the}} equality <b>between</b> <b>men</b> and women {{and the rights of}} the child. Mackworth continued to strive towards equality for women and {{emerged as one of the}} leading feminist campaigners in Britain during the inter-war period. She established a number of women's organisations, pressure groups and launched the influential feminist journal Time and Tide. She also made an unsuccessful bid to gain entry into the House of Lords, fighting against a 1922 ruling that barred the admission of women.|$|E

5|$|Primarily a coming-of-age story (Bildungsroman) {{and family}} saga, the novel chronicles {{the effect of}} a mutated gene on three generations of a Greek family, causing momentous changes in the protagonist's life.

It discusses the pursuit of the American Dream and explores gender identity.

Twenty-one thousand Roma and Sinti were killed, along with 15,000 Soviet POWs and 10,000 to 15,000 peoples of other nations. Around 400 Jehovah's Witnesses were imprisoned at Auschwitz, at least 152 of whom died. An estimated 5,000 to 15,000 gay men prosecuted under German Penal Code Section 175 (proscribing sexual acts <b>between</b> <b>men)</b> were detained in concentration camps of which an unknown number were sent to Auschwitz; of those sent to Auschwitz 80 percent died.|$|E
5|$|As in the Vindication of the Rights of Woman, Wollstonecraft {{does not}} {{highlight}} the differences <b>between</b> <b>men</b> {{and women as}} much as she emphasizes the importance of virtue in Original Stories. Moreover, she defines virtue {{in such a way that}} it applies to both sexes. Traditionally, as Kelly explains, virtue was tied to femininity and chastity, but Wollstonecraft’s text rejects this definition and argues instead that virtue should be characterized by reason and self-control. Myers has also pointed out that Mrs. Mason’s desire to instill rationality in her charges is potentially liberating for women readers and their daughters as such a pedagogy was in direct contrast to much that was being written at the time by conduct book writers such as James Fordyce and John Gregory and philosophers such as Rousseau, who asserted the intellectual weakness of women and the secondary status of their gender.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this chapter}} is to tenatively discuss a sociological {{perspective}} on the relations <b>between</b> <b>man,</b> value orientation, behavioral orientation and sustainable development. Sociologists often get questions about the stability and development of values and willingness to change behavior in a direction which is more favorable to the environment. There are lots of problems with such questions. The first problem {{is the lack of}} tradition in the study of relations <b>between</b> <b>man</b> and nature. The second problem is the problem with time series analysis of values. The third problem has to do with structural aspects in comparative analysis. The problems are discussed in three sections namely the relation <b>between</b> <b>man</b> and nature as a value orientation dimension, the relation <b>between</b> <b>man</b> and society as a behavioral dimension, and a two dimensional typology of the relations between value orientation, behavioral orientation and sustainable development...|$|R
