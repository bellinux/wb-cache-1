40|$|Recently, {{the use of}} timeout rooms {{has been}} {{questioned}} by various agencies, and some have adopted policies that prohibit or greatly restrict exclusionary timeout. The present study developed a timeout procedure that did not require removal of the misbehaver from the learning environment. The procedure {{was applied to the}} disruptive behaviors of five severely retarded children in an institutional special-education classroom. An observer prompted all teacher behaviors related to the procedures to assure their precise implementation. After baseline, a reinforcement-only condition was implemented. Each child was given a different colored ribbon to wear as a tie and received edibles and praise every few minutes for good behavior and for wearing the ribbon. When timeout was added, a child's ribbon was removed for any instance of misbehavior and teacher attention and participation in activities ceased for three minutes or until the misbehavior stopped. Reinforcement continued at other times for appropriate behavior. An ABCBC reversal design was used to demonstrate control of the behavior by the conditions applied. On average, the children misbehaved 42 % and 32 % of the time during the baseline and reinforcement conditions respectively but only 6 % of the time during the timeout conditions. A followup probe during the new school year revealed that the teacher was able to conduct the procedure independently and that the children's disruptive behaviors were maintained at low levels. The practicality and acceptability of the procedure were supported further by the successful implementation of the procedure by a teacher in another state and by responses to a questionnaire given to 40 mental health professionals. The ribbon procedure appears to be a viable form of timeout, provided that disruptive behaviors during timeout can be tolerated within the setting, or a <b>backup</b> <b>procedure</b> such as exclusionary timeout can be tolerated within the setting, or a <b>backup</b> <b>procedure</b> such as exclusionary timeout is available when needed...|$|E

40|$|This article {{presents}} {{a new version}} of the Gilbert-Johnson-Keerthi (GJK) algorithm that circumvents the shortcomings introduced by degenerate geometries. The original Johnson algorithm and <b>Backup</b> <b>procedure</b> are replaced by a distance subalgorithm that is faster and accurate to machine precision, thus guiding the GJK algorithm toward a shorter search path in less computing time. Numerical tests demonstrate that this effectively is a more robust procedure. In particular, when the objects are found in contact, the newly proposed subalgorithm runs from 15 % to 30 % times faster than the original one. The improved performance has a significant impact on various applications, such as real-time simulations and collision avoidance systems. Altogether, the main contributions made to the GJK algorithm are faster convergence rate and reduced computational time. These improvements may be easily added into existing implementations; furthermore, engineering applications that require solutions of distance queries to machine precision can now be tackled using the GJK algorithm...|$|E
40|$|Summary: A 26 -year-old woman {{sustained}} a traffic accident injury {{to her left}} medial malleolus. A soft-tissue defect 15 [*]×[*] 7 [*]cm with exposure of bone was found and underwent free anterolateral thigh flap to cover it. On the second postoperative day, venous congestion occurred and re-exploration was performed. Re-anastomosis of the vein was done after the thrombectomy; unfortunately, the flap did not recover. We found {{there was a good}} granulation bed under the failing flap and thinned the failing flap and used it as a full-thickness skin graft. The graft survived completely; 9 months later, the graft site was softer and of good texture. The patient can wear the same size shoes without a debulking procedure. The free flap provided nutrients to the raw surface and nurtured a good granulation bed while it survived for 50 hours; as a result, it was used as “the nutrient flap. ” Reuse of the failing free flap as “the nutrient flap” is useful as an alternative <b>backup</b> <b>procedure...</b>|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{development of}} an optimal 3 D path planner with collision avoidance for a 9 DOF robot manipulator. The application of the robot manipulator will be on an unmanned oil platform {{where it will be}} used for inspection. Most of the time the robot manipulator will follow a pre-programmed collision-free path specified by an operator. Situations where it is desirable to move the end effector from the current position to a new position without specifying the path in advance might occur. To make this possible a 3 D path planner with collision avoidance is needed. The path planner presented in this paper is based on the well known Probabilistic Roadmap method (PRM). One of the main challenges using the PRM is to make a roadmap covering the entire collision free Configuration space, Cfree, and connect it into one connected component. It is shown by empirical testing that using a combination of the Bridge Sampling technique and a simple Random sampling technique gives best Coverage of the Cfree space and highest Connectivity in the roadmap for the given environment. An algorithm that increases the Connectivity and sometimes provide Maximal Connection is also described. A <b>backup</b> <b>procedure</b> that can be executed on-line if a query fails is also presented. The <b>backup</b> <b>procedure</b> is slow, but it increases the chances of succeeding a query if the goal is in a difficult area. It is also investigated if the coverage and connectivity can be further improved by using the potential field planner when connecting the waypoints. Empirical testing showed that the improvements of Coverage and Connectivity were limited and the sampling and query time increased. The query time for a roadmap containing 400 nodes and one containing 1000 nodes was compared. It turned out that a large roadmap did not necessarily affect the query time negative because it made it easier to connect the start and goal nodes. Three existing path smoothing algorithms and a new algorithm, called Deterministic Shortcut, were implemented and tested. Empirical testing showed that the Deterministic Shortcut algorithm outperformed the others when it came to path smoothing versus time. </p...|$|E

Besides we simulated the bunch lengthening for different bunches along the unevenly filled train and evaluated the Touschek lifetime enhancement taking into account the obtained bunch distributions. Finally, the “cavity parking” option is discussed. It can be considered as a reliable <b>backup</b> <b>procedure</b> consisting of tuning the cavity away from the 3 rd harmonic frequency and in between two revolution harmonics.

40|$|Children {{first learned}} {{by means of}} a {{teaching}} program to discriminate a circle from relatively flat ellipses. Children in the control group then proceeded into a program which gradually reduced the difference between the circle and the ellipses. They advanced to a finer discrimination when they made a correct choice, and reversed to an easier discrimination after making errors (“backup” procedure). The children made relatively few errors until they approached the region of their difference threshold (empirically determined under the conditions described). When they could no longer discriminate the forms, they learned other bases for responding that could be classified as specifiable error patterns. Children in the experimental group, having learned the preliminary circle-ellipse discrimination, were started at {{the upper end of the}} ellipse series, where it was impossible for them to discriminate the forms. The <b>backup</b> <b>procedure</b> returned them to an easier discrimination after they made errors. They made many errors and reversed down through the ellipse series.

40|$|We {{wished to}} {{determine}} the optimal method for cord obliteration to perform selective reduction in complicated monochorionic (MC) twin pregnancies under different clinical conditions. For this purpose, we reviewed our experience and the available published literature and unpublished reports. Indications were a cardiac twin pregnancy, twins discordant for fetal anomaly, and severe feto-fetal transfusion syndrome where one twin had a very poor prognosis. Data were available for the following techniques: cord embolization, fetoscopic cord ligation, laser coagulation, monopolar coagulation and bipolar cautery. Unfortunately the data are heterogeneous, incomplete and reports are only sporadic. Cord embolization using coils or sclerosants has a high failure rate and {{can no longer be}} recommended. In 23 published cases of fetoscopic cord ligation a failure rate of 10 % was reported. After successful ligation an overall fetal survival rate of 71 % but a risk of preterm prelabor rupture of the membranes (PPROM) of 30 % was documented. Four cases of monopolar coagulation have been published [...] all in a cardiac twin pregnancies. In three cases the abdominal aorta was coagulated prior to 20 weeks and complete cessation of flow was demonstrated. In 10 cases of bipolar cord coagulation, all procedures were technically successful. Nine of 10 were performed under ultrasound guidance through a single port. In 2 cases, frank PPROM occurred, leading to induction of labor. The other eight fetuses were born at 35 weeks or more. Nd:YAG coagulation of the cord was much more sporadically described; the success of the procedure seems to be clearly dependant on gestational age. In all our attempts prior to 20 weeks, we failed in only one out of 6 cases. In summary, there is little data to perform meaningful comparisons of available techniques for umbilical cord occlusion. Based on practical and technical considerations we use the following clinical algorithm: prior to 21 weeks, we attempt to coagulate the cord with Nd:YAG laser. If this is unsuccessful, or for gestations beyond 21 weeks, bipolar cord coagulation is currently our other method of choice. Sonoendoscopic cord ligation is reserved as <b>backup</b> <b>procedure</b> if neither of these methods are successful. status: publishe...|$|E
