5|$|An {{extreme example}} of an {{equatorial}} bulge is found on the star Regulus A (α Leonis A). The equator of this star has a measured rotational velocity of 317±3km/s. This corresponds to a rotation period of 15.9 hours, which is 86% of the velocity at which the star would <b>break</b> <b>apart.</b> The equatorial radius of this star is 32% larger than polar radius. Other rapidly rotating stars include Alpha Arae, Pleione, Vega and Achernar.|$|E

Roughly 750million years ago, the earliest known supercontinent Rodinia, began to <b>break</b> <b>apart.</b> The continents later recombined to form Pannotia which broke apart about 540million years ago, then finally Pangaea, which broke apart about 180million years ago.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, matter {{itself is}} {{expected}} to come {{under the influence of}} radioactive decay, as even the most stable materials <b>break</b> <b>apart</b> into subatomic particles. Current data suggest that the universe has a flat geometry (or very close to flat), and thus, will not collapse in on itself after a finite time, and the infinite future allows for the occurrence of a number of massively improbable events, such as the formation of Boltzmann brains.|$|E
5|$|Plutonium is a {{radioactive}} actinide metal whose isotope, plutonium-239, {{is one of}} {{the three}} primary fissile isotopes (uranium-233 and uranium-235 are the other two); plutonium-241 is also highly fissile. To be considered fissile, an isotope's atomic nucleus must be able to <b>break</b> <b>apart</b> or fission when struck by a slow moving neutron and to release enough additional neutrons to sustain the nuclear chain reaction by splitting further nuclei.|$|E

5|$|In {{the ending}} {{that was in}} the {{original}} theatrical version, Ellen rammed the shark with Mike's boat, mortally wounding it. The shark then causes the boat to <b>break</b> <b>apart</b> with its death contortions, forcing the people on the boat to jump off to avoid going down with it. American audiences disapproved of this ending. A new ending was ordered shot for foreign distribution with the shark getting stabbed with the bow sprit and then exploding; and with Jake being found wounded but alive. This version is what Universal used on home media releases.|$|E
5|$|After his defeat, Dow {{continued}} to promote prohibition around the country, and was gratified {{to see it}} spread to eleven states. He also made efforts to refute the charge made by his enemies (including his cousin John Neal) that the Maine law was ineffective and that drinking had actually increased in Portland during Dow's term in office. In 1854, Dow ran for mayor again unsuccessfully; as the Whig Party began to <b>break</b> <b>apart,</b> Dow attracted support from the Free Soilers and the Know Nothings, a nativist party. By the next year, those two parties began to join anti-slavery Whigs in a new party, the Republicans. They soon controlled the state legislature and, with Dow's encouragement, strengthened the enforcement provisions of the Maine law. Dow ran again for mayor in 1855 and was narrowly re-elected to the office he had left three years earlier.|$|E

For the scene where Riker is pulled into the oil, a stuntman {{was used as a}} stand in for Jonathan Frakes. Where Riker's face emerges from the oil, it was actually a plaster cast of Frakes' face painted black. It was placed on the same grate used to lift McChesney, and filmed lifting out of the liquid. The twitching effect in Yar's death was due to a wire tied around Crosby's waist being pulled on.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, UBS {{announced}} the planned cut of 8,700 jobs and had implemented a new compensation plan. Under the plan, {{no more than}} one-third of any cash bonus would be paid out in the year it is earned with the rest to be held in reserve and stock-based incentives that would vest after three years; top executives would have to hold 75% of any vested shares. Additionally, the bank's chairman, Peter Kurer, would no longer receive any extra variable compensation, only a cash salary and a fixed allotment of shares that could not be sold for four years. In April 2009, UBS announced that it agreed to sell its Brazilian financial services business, UBS Pactual, for approximately US$2.5billion to BTG Investments. UBS rejected proposals to <b>break</b> <b>apart</b> the bank and divest its investment banking division.|$|E
5|$|By July15, Typhoon Ma-on had a {{well-defined}} eye with the strongest convection in its southern periphery. It continued intensifying, and the JTWC estimated 1-minute sustained winds of 220km/h (135mph). Late on July15, Ma-on weakened slightly due to stronger wind shear, which caused its eyewall to <b>break</b> <b>apart</b> {{in the northwest}} quadrant. It re-intensified the next day after an eyewall replacement cycle commenced. At 0600UTC on July16, the JMA estimated peak 10-minute sustained winds of 175km/h (110mph) while the typhoon was located about 1185km (735mi) southeast of Okinawa. Around that time, Ma-on began a motion to the northwest due to a weakening of the subtropical ridge, and it briefly entered the area warned by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA); the agency gave it the local name Ineng.|$|E

5|$|Dorsally, {{the color}} pattern {{consists}} of a deep yellow, tan, or brown ground color, with three series of dark brown spots that run {{the length of the}} body. Each of these spots has a black ring around it, the outer border of which is intensified with a rim of white or yellow. The dorsal spots, which usually number 23–30, may grow together, while the side spots may <b>break</b> <b>apart.</b> The head has a pair of distinct dark patches, one on each temple, together with a pinkish, salmon, or brownish V or X marking that forms an apex towards the snout. Behind the eye is a dark streak, outlined in white, pink, or buff. The venter is white, whitish, yellowish, or pinkish, often with an irregular scattering of dark spots.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 2004 {{arrival of}} the Cassini–Huygens spacecraft, the rings of Saturn were widely thought to be much younger than the Solar System and were not {{expected}} to survive beyond another 300million years. Gravitational interactions with Saturn's moons were expected to gradually sweep the rings' outer edge toward the planet, with abrasion by meteorites and Saturn's gravity eventually taking the rest, leaving Saturn unadorned. However, data from the Cassini mission led scientists to revise that early view. Observations revealed 10km-wide icy clumps of material that repeatedly <b>break</b> <b>apart</b> and reform, keeping the rings fresh. Saturn's rings are far more massive than the rings of the other giant planets. This large mass {{is thought to have}} preserved Saturn's rings since it first formed 4.5billion years ago, and is likely to preserve them for billions of years to come.|$|E
5|$|In the Operations notes, Formation Flying, orders {{specifically}} {{stated that}} the formation, as a whole, was not to stay together, saying each six aircraft section {{was to be a}} self-contained defensive unit, flying at different heights, stating that more than 12 aircraft per formation made it unwieldy and unmanageable by one leader. Even so, the notes also pointed to the importance of holding a formation within one's own section. If a section leader endeavoured to follow the formation leader (Wing Commander Kellet) to the detriment of their section, the formation would <b>break</b> <b>apart.</b> Bomber formations were built on the idea of mutual protection; if the formation came apart, each bomber would have to fend for itself, which would enable an enemy to pick off the bombers one by one. Squadron Leaders Guthrie and Hue-Williams did not heed this advice during the battle. Wing Commander Kellett had followed the notes, and he lost only one aircraft. Harris had also kept his formation together, and lost none of his Wellingtons. Within a few weeks, a debate began on shifting air attacks to the cover of darkness, with Hewitt favouring this alternative.|$|E

5|$|Utor caused {{extensive}} {{power outages}} in Cebu, Leyte, and Boracay, resulting in widespread loss of telecommunication. A single electric pole in northern Cebu caught fire during the storm, cutting out power to eight peripheral towns. Downtown Tacloban also suffered a blackout. Off of Boracay, a boat operator was killed after their ship capsized. Another 67ships, {{which consisted of}} speedboats and ferries, sunk during the storm's passage. Buildings were unroofed and trees were torn apart on the island, littering its beaches with debris. A barge was forced by large waves into the pier at San Agustin, Romblon, resulting in the spilling of 25,000L (6,600gal) of diesel fuel. Two children were killed in Tacloban and Capiz {{as a result of}} falling trees; an additional three people in Capiz were feared to have drowned due to floods. Two thousand people became stranded after the Philippine Coast Guard cancelled the operation of 43ferry services. Similarly, 8,000people became stranded at seaports after the coast guard barred vessels from sailing. Extensive damage occurred in Occidental Mindoro, where 422homes were destroyed and an additional 1,421damaged. Rough seas caused the outriggers on a ferry between Batangas and Puerto Galera, Oriental Mindoro to <b>break</b> <b>apart,</b> causing the ship to begin disintegrating offshore. However, the 104passengers and crew on board were able to escape and were later rescued. Further north in southern Luzon, roads and bridges were rendered impassable after sustaining damage.|$|E
5|$|Robert Hartwell {{notes that}} in the Northern Song dynasty there were two types of elites who {{dominated}} the civil service: a founding elite and a professional elite. The founding elite consisted of the North China military governors of the 10th century, their associates, personal staffs, and bureaucrats who {{had served in the}} capitals of the administrations of the previous Five Dynasties. The professional bureaucracy consisted of elite families who had established residence in Kaifeng or subordinate capitals, claimed prestigious clan ancestry, had intermarried with other prominent families, had members in higher offices over generations, and periodically dominated Song government until the 12th century. The prominent families of this professional elite accounted for 18 of the 11th century chancellors, the highest official post. From 960 to 986, the founding military elite from Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Hebei represented 46% of fiscal offices, people from districts in Songzhou—the military governorship of the founding emperor—represented 22% of fiscal offices, and those from Kaifeng and Luoyang filled 13% of fiscal posts. In the same period, the founding elite and professional elite filled over 90% of policy-making positions. However, after 983, when the south had been conquered and consolidated into the empire, a semi-hereditary professional elite gradually replaced the founding elite. After 1086 not a single family of the founding elite had a member in either policy-making or financial positions. Between 998 and 1085, the 35 most important families of the professional elite represented only 5% of the families that had members in policy-making offices, yet they disproportionately held 23% of these positions. By the late 11th century the professional elite began to <b>break</b> <b>apart</b> as a distinguishable status group aiming for civil service. They were replaced by a multitude of local gentry lineages who had their children pursue a slew of different professions other than official careers. Hartwell states that this shift of power {{was the result of the}} professional elite's lineage strategies being undermined by the rise of factional partisan politics in the latter half of the 11th century.|$|E
