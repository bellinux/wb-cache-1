5|$|In 2013, Fey starred {{alongside}} Paul Rudd in {{the romantic}} comedy-drama film Admission, {{based on the}} Jean Hanff Korelitz novel by the same name. The film was directed by Paul Weitz. Fey later starred in the 2014 comedy-drama This Is Where I Leave You, helmed <b>by</b> <b>Date</b> Night director Shawn Levy. As {{was the case with}} Baby Mama, although both of these films received generally mixed reviews, Fey's performances were well received by film critics.|$|E
5|$|Although {{usually more}} coins were struck at Philadelphia {{than at the}} other mints during the years the coin was struck in silver, only 12,450,181 were struck there in 1955, fewer than at the Denver Mint or at San Francisco. This was due to a sagging economy and a lackluster demand for coins that caused the Mint to {{announce}} in January that the San Francisco Mint would be shuttered {{at the end of}} the year. The 1955 dimes from the three facilities are the lowest mintages <b>by</b> <b>date</b> and mint mark among circulating coins in the series, but are not rare, as collectors stored them away in rolls of 50.|$|E

5|$|The listed {{buildings}} can {{be divided}} <b>by</b> <b>date</b> into three groups: ancient structures, structures built during the two centuries before the Industrial Revolution, and those built during or after it. Halton Castle and Norton Priory date from the 11th and 12thcenturies, and are now in ruins. Structures built before the Industrial Revolution reflect society as {{it was at that}} time, and the main occupations of farming and fishing. They include farmhouses, such as the building known as the Seneschal's House, which dates from 1598 and is the oldest standing building in the urban area; buildings relating to stately homes, such as the loggia and ice house in the grounds of Norton Priory; domestic buildings, such as Halton Old Hall, and buildings relating to the church, such as Halton Vicarage and the adjacent Chesshyre Library.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND Available {{data about}} {{the spread of the}} Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) often come with two types: that <b>by</b> <b>dates</b> of report and that <b>by</b> <b>dates</b> of onset of symptoms. The latter is an {{approximation}} of the epidemic curve. Statistical methods can suggest the most plausible epidemic curve by the time of infection. METHODS Input data are SARS cases <b>by</b> <b>dates</b> of onset. Back-calculation methods are applied. The incubation distributions used in the algorithm are three log-logistic models: (i) that with median = 4. 18 days and a shape parameter 3. 413 (95 % quantile 9. 9 days); (ii) that with a shorter incubation distribution (median = 3. 453 days; 95 % quantile = 6. 569 days); (iii) that with a longer incubation distribution (median = 5. 139 days; 95 % quantile = 17. 2 days.) RESULTS Three infection curves based on the above three incubation distribution assumptions have bee...|$|R
