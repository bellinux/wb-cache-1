50|$|OCT <b>Biomicroscopy</b> {{is the use}} {{of optical}} {{coherence}} tomography (OCT) in place of slit lamp <b>biomicroscopy</b> to examine the transparent, axial tissues of the eye. Traditionally, ophthalmic <b>biomicroscopy</b> has been completed with a slit lamp biomicroscope that uses slit beam illumination and an optical microscope to enable stereoscopic, magnified, cross-sectional views of transparent tissues in the eye, with or without the aid of an additional lens. Like slit lamp <b>biomicroscopy,</b> OCT does not penetrate opaque tissues well but enables detailed, cross-sectional views of transparent tissues, often with greater detail than is possible with a slit lamp. Ultrasound <b>biomicroscopy</b> (UBM) is much better at imaging through opaque tissues since it uses high energy sound waves. Because of its limited depth of penetration, UBM's main use within ophthalmology has been to visualize anterior structures such as the angle and ciliary body. Both ultrasound and OCT <b>biomicroscopy</b> produce an objective image of ocular tissues from which measurements can be made. Unlike UBM, OCT <b>biomicroscopy</b> can image tissues with high axial resolution as far posteriorly as the choroid (Figure 1).|$|E

50|$|Like slit lamps, OCT imaging devices provide magnified, {{cross-sectional}} {{views of}} transparent tissues in the eye. Unlike slit lamps, OCT devices store tomographic images {{that can be}} 1) acquired consistently using the same protocol at each patient visit in every location around the world, 2) operated by less expensive personnel with less training and experience than a slit lamp, 3) objectively and quantitatively analyzed by the user and/or computer software, and 4) retrospectively or longitudinally assessed in both clinical trials and in clinical practice.

50|$|FCED is {{classified}} into 4 stages, from {{early signs of}} guttae formation to end-stage subepithelial scarring. Diagnosis is made by biomicroscopic examination in the clinic.

50|$|The {{development}} of short external cavity tunable laser technology has made SS-OCT <b>biomicroscopy</b> possible by combining high speed acquisition with long coherence length and consistently high image quality across {{the depth of}} the eye. It is now feasible that properly designed SS-OCT systems could acquire full OCT biomicroscopic data from both eyes of a subject in less than 20 seconds. As with SD-OCT, mirror image artifacts must be removed from SS-OCT systems.|$|E
5000|$|Ultrasound <b>biomicroscopy</b> {{is a type}} of {{ultrasound}} eye exam {{that makes}} a more detailed image than regular ultrasound. High-energy sound waves are bounced off the inside of the eye and the echo patterns are shown on the screen of an ultrasound machine. This makes a picture called a sonogram. [...] It is useful in glaucoma, cysts and neoplasms of the eye, as well as the evaluation of trauma and foreign bodies of the eye.|$|E
50|$|The major {{limitation}} of TD-OCT that prevents its use for OCT <b>biomicroscopy</b> is speed. Conventional commercial TD-OCT systems {{are limited to}} an acquisition speed of 400 A-scans per second with a depth of 2mm. Assuming that an OCT biomicroscopic system must cover a 15mm x 15mm planar area of eye tissue with an average depth of 24mm (5,400 cubic mm), {{it would take a}} conventional TD-OCT system more than one day to capture OCT biomicroscopic data on a single pair of eyes.|$|E
50|$|SD-OCT {{systems are}} 50-100x faster than TD-OCT systems and {{therefore}} can cover the required tissue volume for OCT <b>biomicroscopy</b> in a single eye in approximately eight minutes (assuming an A-scan rate of 100 kHz). However, commercial SD-OCT systems suffer significant drops in sensitivity, and thus image quality, beyond 2mm of penetration depth. Therefore, if used sequentially to image an eye from the cornea to the choroid, commercial SD-OCT systems would probably produce images with unacceptably inconsistent quality across {{the depth of the}} eye. Furthermore, commercial SD-OCT devices also produce mirror image artifacts around the zero delay position. Although this is infrequently distracting in posterior segment imaging, it can be quite confusing when imaging near the iris plane.|$|E
5000|$|Typical sonographic {{instruments}} {{operate in}} the frequency range of 1 to 18 megahertz, though frequencies up to 50-100 megahertz have been used experimentally in a technique known as <b>biomicroscopy</b> in special regions, such as the anterior chamber of the eye. The choice of frequency is a trade-off between spatial resolution of the image and imaging depth: lower frequencies produce less resolution but image deeper into the body. Higher frequency sound waves have a smaller wavelength and thus are capable of reflecting or scattering from smaller structures. Higher frequency sound waves also have a larger attenuation coefficient and thus are more readily absorbed in tissue, limiting the depth of penetration of the sound wave into the body (for details, see Acoustic attenuation.) ...|$|E
50|$|In Marfan syndrome, {{the health}} of the eye can be {{affected}} in many ways but the principal change is partial lens dislocation, where the lens is shifted out of its normal position. This occurs because of weakness in the ciliary zonules, the connective tissue strands which suspend the lens within the eye. The mutations responsible for Marfan syndrome weaken the zonules and cause them to stretch. The inferior zonules are most frequently stretched resulting in the lens shifting upwards and outwards but it can shift in other directions as well. Nearsightedness and blurred vision are common, but farsightedness can also result particularly if the lens is highly subluxated. Subluxation (partial dislocation) of the lens can be detected clinically in 80% of patients by the use of a slit-lamp biomicroscope. If the lens subluxation is subtle then imaging with high-resolution ultrasound <b>biomicroscopy</b> might be used.|$|E
50|$|The {{condition}} was first described by Austrian ophthalmologist Ernst Fuchs (1851-1930), after {{whom it is}} named. In 1910, Fuchs first reported 13 cases of central corneal clouding, loss of corneal sensation {{and the formation of}} epithelial bullae, which he labeled ‘dystrophia epithelialis corneae’. It was characterized by late onset, slow progression, decreased visual acuity in the morning, lack of inflammation, diffuse corneal opacity, intense centrally, and roughened epithelium with vesicle-like features. A shift to the understanding of Fuchs’ corneal endothelial dystrophy (FCED) as primarily a disease of the corneal endothelium resulted after a number of observations in the 1920s. Crystal-like features of the endothelium were noted by Kraupa in 1920, who suggested that the epithelial changes were dependent on the endothelium. Using a slit lamp, Vogt described the excrescences associated with FCD as drop-like in appearance in 1921. In 1924, Graves then provided an extremely detailed explanation of the endothelial elevations visible with slit-lamp <b>biomicroscopy.</b> A patient with unilateral epithelial dystrophy and bilateral endothelial changes was described by the Friedenwalds in 1925; subsequent involvement of the second eye led them to emphasize that endothelial changes preceded epithelial changes. As only a subset of patients with endothelial changes proceeded to epithelial involvement, Graves stated on 19 October 1925 to the New York Academy of Medicine that “Fuchs’ epithelial dystrophy may be a very late sequel to severer cases of the deeper affection”.|$|E

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} dynamic {{changes in the}} anterior segment in patients with acute anterior uveitis (AAU) using ultrasound <b>biomicroscopy</b> (UBM). Acute anterior uveitis was diagnosed in 18 patients according to history and ocular examinations.

The relationships between clinical manifestations and UBM findings were also evaluated. All investigated AAU patients showed severe ciliary injection, numerous dust keratic precipitates (KPs), aqueous flare and inflammatory cells, and were treated predominantly with corticosteroid and cycloplegic eyedrops. Ultrasound <b>biomicroscopy</b> showed {{a large number of}} cells in the anterior and posterior chamber, marked oedema and exudates in and around the iris and ciliary body within 2 weeks of AAU onset.

40|$|Purpose: To {{study the}} {{anatomical}} relationships of the anterior {{segment of the}} eye, using ultrasound <b>biomicroscopy</b> in patients with chronic simple glaucoma and nonglaucomatous eyes, after mydriatic and cycloplegic instillation. Patients and Methods: Thirty eyes with chronic simple glaucoma and 30 nonglaucomatous eyes were studied. Anterior chamber depth, iris-lens contact and iris-zonule distance were measured, in both groups, using ultrasound <b>biomicroscopy,</b> in the three following conditions: without mydriatic and cycloplegic instillation, with 1 % tropicamide alone and with 1 % tropicamide plus 10 % phenylephrine chlorhydrate. Results: Ultrasound <b>biomicroscopy</b> examinations of glaucomatous and nonglaucomatous eyes, without mydriatic and cycloplegic instillation, showed {{no statistically significant difference}} in the central anterior chamber depth, iris-lens contact and iris-zonule distance. The difference between examinations without mydriatic and cycloplegic instillation, with 1 % tropicamide and with 1 % tropicamide plus 10 % phenylephrine chlorhydrate was statistically significant regarding the variables measured in both groups. Conclusions: No anatomical difference was observed between the anterior segment of glaucomatous and nonglaucomatous eyes after mydriatic and cycloplegic instillation. The results of this clinical investigation, using ultrasound <b>biomicroscopy</b> were innovative, allowing a dynamic and quantitative evaluation of the anatomical relationships between intraocular structures when submitted to mydriasis and cycloplegy, which up to now were only qualitative...|$|E
40|$|Background: Congenital microcoria (CMC) {{is due to}} a maldevelopment of the dilator pupillae muscle of the iris, with a pupil {{diameter}} of less than 2 mm. It is associated with juvenile open angle glaucoma and myopia. We report on a three-generation Mexican-Mestizo family with CMC. The eldest member’s iris biopsy proved muscle anomalies. Further, we analyzed novel ultrasound <b>biomicroscopy</b> findings in the family members who did not require surgery. Patients and Methods: A 62 -year-old woman, her 41 -year-old son and her 9 -year-old grandson affected with microcoria since birth, documented by clinical examination and ultrasound <b>biomicroscopy.</b> The eldest member underwent phacoemulsification, and a biopsy of the iris and the anterior capsule of the lens was taken. Results: Ultrasound <b>biomicroscopy</b> confirmed the CMC diagnosis showing iris thinning and a pupil {{diameter of}} less than 2 mm. Histopathology of the iris showed a significant reduction of smooth muscle cells, but no alterations of the anterior lens capsule. Discussion: Although CMC is a rare disorder, which {{is due to a}} maldevelopment of the dilator pupillae muscle of the iris, it could be associated with juvenile open angle glaucoma and myopia; therefore, precise diagnosis is required. Ultrasound <b>biomicroscopy</b> could be a great option to confirm the disorder...|$|E
40|$|To {{establish}} whether {{differences in}} the assessment of diabetic macular oedema (DME) with either optical coherence tomography (OCT) or stereoscopic <b>biomicroscopy</b> lead to variability in the photocoagulation treatment of DME. The {{differences in the}} assessment of DME with either OCT or stereoscopic <b>biomicroscopy</b> were analysed by calculating the surface areas and the overlap of retinal thickening. Photocoagulation treatment plans of retinal specialists were compared by evaluating the number and location of planned laser spots. The threshold for and dosage of photocoagulation differ depending upon whether the basis of retinal thickness diagnosis is clinical observation or OCT. The overlap in laser spot location based on the assessment of DME with OCT or <b>biomicroscopy</b> averages 51 %. Among retinal specialists, the treatment plans differed in the laser spot count by six- to 11 -fold. Diabetic macular oedema photocoagulation treatment threshold and dosage of laser spots differ depending on whether thickness assessments are based on stereoscopic slit-lamp <b>biomicroscopy</b> or OCT. In addition, retinal specialists differed in the number and placement of planned laser spots even when given identical information concerning DME and treatable lesions. This variability in the photocoagulation treatment of DME could lead to differences in patient outcome and laser study result...|$|E
30|$|<b>Biomicroscopy</b> of the fundus {{with the}} slit lamp is {{ultimately}} {{the result of}} melding {{the two most important}} examination techniques in clinical ophthalmology, namely <b>biomicroscopy</b> with the slit lamp and fundoscopy. Historically speaking, fundoscopy is the older examination technique, dating back to 1851 (Helmholtz 1909), while the slit lamp was introduced by Allvar Gullstrand in 1911 (Gullstrand 1911). But it lasted several more decades until with the introduction of the + 90 and + 60 D Volk lenses in the 1980 -ies clinical <b>biomicroscopy</b> of the fundus gained its present form (Lundberg 1985; Volk 1986). This is even more astonishing as two important preconditions had been avaible since the 1950 -ies: the theoretical concept for fundus biomcroscopy through a high power convex lens (El Bayadi 1953; El Bayadi 1965) and a slit lamp which allowed a nearly parallel beam between observation and illumination (Littmann 1950 a).|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Description of {{a patient}} with a solitary cyst of the pupillary margin iris pigment {{epithelium}} (IPE). Methods: A 63 -year-old man referred a suspected iris-ciliary body melanoma in his left eye. Based on both clinical examination and ultrasound <b>biomicroscopy,</b> melanoma was considered unlikely. Surgery was under-taken to correct recurrent deterioration of vision due to movement of the lesion across the visual axis. Results: The lesion was excised completely. Ultrasound <b>biomicroscopy</b> and histopathological examination ruled out melanoma and allowed a final diagnosis of primary pupillary margin cyst of the IPE, characterized of pig-mented epithelium, with no connective tissue or vessels. No recurrences or fresh lesions appeared during a one-year follow-up. Conclusions: Primary epithelial iris cysts are usually benign. Treatment is required only in symptomatic patients and those with an uncertain diagnosis. Ultrasound <b>biomicroscopy</b> is indispensable to confirm the clinical diagnosis, follow the clinical course and intervene if surgery is required...|$|E
40|$|A 48 -year-old man {{presented}} with hyphema, iridocyclitis, iridophacodonesis, and maculopathy after a contusive trauma. Ultrasound <b>biomicroscopy</b> identified a 90 -degree cyclodialysis cleft with severe damage of the zonular fibers. Echographic B-scan examination revealed intravitreal hemorrhage and a 360 -degree choroidal detachment. One month later, phacoemulsification was performed and a single-piece poly(methyl methacrylate) intraocular lens was {{inserted into the}} ciliary sulcus, with the haptic rotated toward the cyclodialysis cleft area. Postoperatively, the visual acuity improved and the intraocular pressure returned to normal. Ultrasound <b>biomicroscopy</b> showed closure of the cleft by reattachment of the ciliary body to the scleral spur. Optical coherence tomography revealed complete resolution of the macular and choroidal folds. Ultrasound <b>biomicroscopy</b> is a useful method for appropriate management of traumatic cyclodialysis cleft. In cases of small cyclodialysis clefts, with the surgical method we describe, the lens haptics apply directional force toward the sclera, fostering adherence of the ciliary body fiber...|$|E

Their brochures - if at all - contain very few fundus material (Müller & Wagner 2001) and even on the free book market until recently no larger collection of slit lamp findings of the fundus with the present methods was available (Hruby 1950; Gellrich 2011 a).|$|E
