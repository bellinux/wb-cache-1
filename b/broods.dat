5|$|The first <b>broods</b> {{were formed}} by the Overmind, with the {{direction}} of each brood being delegated to a cerebrate. A brood was engineered for a specific function, which impacted its numerical strength and the diversity of its strains. The Terrans gave the Great War <b>broods</b> reporting names based on beasts found in Earth mythology. The Command Wing <b>broods</b> were responsible for defending the Overmind and searching for new species for assimilation. These <b>broods</b> did not engage in front-line combat unless necessary. The Command Wing included the Tiamat Brood, Baelrog Brood, and Fenris Brood. The Attack Wing <b>broods</b> were the Swarm's front-line forces, meant to conquer and occupy worlds. The wing's primary <b>broods</b> were amongst {{the largest in the}} Swarm. The Attack Wing included the Garm Brood, Jormungand Brood, and Surtur Brood.|$|E

5|$|The Swarm was reunited under Kerrigan {{at the end}} of the Brood War. The cerebrates were {{eliminated}} from the Swarm but <b>broods</b> such as the Char Brood remained.|$|E
50|$|In Amalgam Comics, the <b>Brood</b> is {{combined}} with Brother Blood to form Brother <b>Brood,</b> and with the Cult of Blood to form the Cult of <b>Brood.</b> The <b>Brood</b> appear alongside Brother <b>Brood,</b> but are presented as supernatural rather than extraterrestrial.|$|R
40|$|Maternal {{aggression}} was studied inOreochromis mossambicus {{during the}} mouthbrooding cycle. <b>Brooding</b> females {{were observed in}} heterosexual captive groups, and their agonistic interactions and behavioural activities were registered. <b>Brooding</b> females were classified into three classes according to the developmental stage of the <b>brood</b> they were incubating: phase 1, <b>brooding</b> eggs; phase 2, <b>brooding</b> fry with yolk-sac; phase 3, <b>brooding</b> fry with exogeneous feeding. The behaviour ofthe <b>brooding</b> females was compared with the behaviour of control non-incubating females. During the <b>brooding</b> cycle females become increasingly more aggressive toward other individuals, with their aggressiveness reaching a peak in phase 3. During the <b>brooding</b> cycle the females also suppress their feeding activities. The outcome of the agonistic interactions (victories-defeats) of the <b>brooding</b> females {{was positively correlated with}} the <b>brooding</b> phase but not with clutch size. The main function of maternal aggression inO. mossambicus seems to he the defence of the vulnerable <b>brood</b> against predators, including conspecifics, at a developmental stage when the fry start to forage outside the mother's mouth...|$|R
50|$|Given {{the chance}} to lower the <b>Brood's</b> numbers further, they {{discovered}} that the Annihilation event had caused the interstellar ecosystem to destabilize, since the <b>Brood,</b> dangerous as they are, served as natural predators for even worse species. These remaining species are now breeding {{out of control and}} present a greater threat than the <b>Brood</b> ever did. With no other choice, the X-Men act to prevent the <b>Brood</b> extinction. According to Bishop, there would be a race of benevolent <b>Brood</b> in the future, prompting the X-Men to willingly serve as <b>Brood</b> hosts, so that they could instill them with the same compassion felt by No-Name. After being connected with the hive-mind, the X-Men learned of a nearby <b>Brood</b> who was born with ability to feel compassion, making him the <b>Brood</b> equivalent of a mutant. While such <b>Brood</b> are typically destroyed upon birth, this one was permitted to live, given the <b>Brood's</b> dwindling numbers. After rescuing the <b>Brood</b> mutant and defeating the <b>Brood</b> in battle and allowing them to escape, the X-Men had their <b>Brood</b> embryos removed, to be raised aboard the Peak, with the <b>Brood</b> mutant acting as their mentor.|$|R
5|$|A brood {{depended}} on a nexus creature to direct it. In the pre-conflict Swarm, this position was filled by cerebrates. However, supplanting the cerebrate with another entity could allow <b>broods,</b> or other {{large groups of}} zerg, {{to be controlled by}} non-Swarm agents.|$|E
5|$|Daggoth was the {{commander-in-chief}} {{of the entire}} zerg swarm war-machine. As the highest ranking cerebrate, Daggoth was a tactical genius {{in command of the}} Tiamat Brood, the largest and most powerful brood in the Zerg Swarm. Voiced by Micky Neilson, Daggoth is the most strong-willed and ferocious of the cerebrates. It trains the player character in the Zerg campaign of StarCraft and dispenses forces to protect Kerrigan following her transformation. Daggoth was charged with protecting the Overmind itself. In the wake of the Overmind's death, Daggoth immediately takes command of the fractured Zerg <b>broods,</b> annihilated several renegade zerg <b>broods,</b> and ordered several cerebrates to merge to form a new Overmind.|$|E
5|$|During the Brood War, the United Earth Directorate Expeditionary Fleet {{took control}} of the zerg unaligned with Sarah Kerrigan by {{controlling}} the second Overmind. The enslaved <b>broods</b> {{played a critical role in}} ensuring the UED's temporary dominance of the sector.|$|E
50|$|The {{positions}} of <b>brood</b> patches can vary with many having a single <b>brood</b> patch {{in the middle}} of the belly while some shorebirds have one patch on each side of the belly. Gulls and Galliformes may have three <b>brood</b> patches. Pelicans, penguins, boobies and gannets do not develop <b>brood</b> patches, but instead cradle the eggs on their feet when incubating. <b>Brood</b> parasitic cuckoos do not develop <b>brood</b> patches. In species where both parents incubate, <b>brood</b> patches may develop in both sexes.|$|R
50|$|In entomology, {{the term}} <b>brood</b> {{is used to}} refer to the embryo or egg, the larva and the pupa stages in the life of {{holometabolous}} insects. The <b>brood</b> of honey bees develops within a bee hive. In man-made, removable frame hives, such as Langstroth hives, each frame which is mainly <b>brood</b> is called a <b>brood</b> frame. <b>Brood</b> frames usually have some pollen and nectar or honey in the upper corners of the frame. The rest of the <b>brood</b> frames cells may be empty or occupied by <b>brood</b> in various developmental stages. During the <b>brood</b> raising season, the bees may reuse the cells from which <b>brood</b> has emerged for additional <b>brood</b> or convert it to honey or pollen storage. Bees show remarkable flexibility in adapting cells to a use best suited for the hive's survival.|$|R

5|$|Mourning doves are {{prolific}} breeders. In warmer areas, {{these birds}} may raise {{up to six}} <b>broods</b> in a season. This fast breeding is essential because mortality is high. Each year, mortality can reach 58% a year for adults and 69% for the young.|$|E
5|$|Other mating systems, {{including}} polygyny, polyandry, polygamy, polygynandry, and promiscuity, also occur.

5000|$|Simply {{keep the}} <b>brood</b> nest open. In {{preparation}} for swarming, bees fill the <b>brood</b> nest with honey. The queen stops laying to be trim enough to fly, and her newly unemployed nurse bees go with her. The concept {{of this method}} is to open the <b>brood</b> nest to employ those nurse bees and get the queen laying again and redirect this sequence of events. This is done by any number of slight variations from empty frames in the <b>brood</b> nest, frames of bare foundation in the <b>brood</b> nest or drawn combs in the <b>brood</b> nest, or moving <b>brood</b> combs to the box above to cause more expansion of the <b>brood</b> nest.|$|R

40|$|To {{improve the}} {{standard}} crossover operator in genetic programming (GP), Tackett [19] introduced the <b>brood</b> recombination crossover method. The key parameter in {{this method is}} the <b>brood</b> size. This paper investigates {{a number of new}} developments of <b>brood</b> size in the <b>brood</b> recombination crossover method in GP. We first investigate the effect of different fixed <b>brood</b> sizes, then construct three dynamic models for setting the <b>brood</b> size. These developments are examined and compared with the standard crossover operator on three object classification problems of increasing difficulty. The results suggest that the <b>brood</b> recombination methods with all the new developments outperforms the standard crossover operator for all the problems. As the <b>brood</b> size increases, the system effective performance can be improved. When it exceeds a certain point, however, the effective performance will not be improved and the system will become less efficient. Investigation of three dynamic models for the <b>brood</b> size reveals that a variable <b>brood</b> size which is dynamically set with the number of generations can further improve the system performance over the fixed <b>brood</b> size...|$|R
5|$|The clutch is {{typically}} {{three to five}} eggs (range two to six), which are usually whitish-buff or greenish-blue and are spotted with red, purple or brown. The average size of the egg is , and weighs , of which 6% is shell. The eggs are incubated for 12–15days, mainly by the female. The chicks are altricial and downy, and are fed by both parents. They fledge about 14–16days after hatching. There are normally two <b>broods,</b> except in Siberia, where there is only one, the male feeding the fledglings from the first brood while the female sits on the second clutch. Sometimes the same nest is reused for both <b>broods.</b> The young are dependent on their parents for 15–20 days after fledging.|$|E
5|$|The female incubates for 12–14 {{days before}} the altricial chicks are hatched naked and blind. Fledging takes another 10–19 (average 13.6) days, with both parents feeding the young and {{removing}} faecal sacs. The nest is often ill-concealed {{compared with those of}} other species, and many breeding attempts fail due to predation. The young are fed by the parents for up to three weeks after leaving the nest, and will follow the adults begging for food. If the female starts another nest, the male alone will feed the fledged young. Second <b>broods</b> are common, with the female reusing the same nest if the brood was successful, and three <b>broods</b> may be raised in the south of the common blackbird's range.|$|E
5|$|The {{northern}} mockingbird pairs hatch about 2 to 4 <b>broods</b> a year. In one breeding season, the {{northern mockingbird}} lays {{an average of}} 4 eggs. They hatch after about 11 to 14 days of incubation. After about 10 to 15 days of life, the offspring become independent.|$|E
5000|$|In solitary populations, nesting begins {{later and}} only one <b>brood</b> is {{produced}}. The <b>brood</b> has a sex ratio made up of 60% males, {{similar to that of}} the second <b>brood</b> in social colonies. This <b>brood</b> is also produced at about the same time that the second <b>brood</b> is produced in social populations so that the colony cycle ends at about the same time.|$|R
50|$|The queens of B. occidentalis {{have the}} ability to {{recognize}} her own nest and <b>brood.</b> Upon arriving on a specific <b>brood,</b> the queen will behave differently depending on whether it is her own <b>brood</b> or foreign. Queens will spend significantly more time inspecting the surface of foreign <b>brood</b> clumps with their antennas if they are on a foreign <b>brood.</b> Upon recognizing the <b>brood</b> as not their own, the Queens will be more much likely to depart during this observation period. However, these queens will stay within the vicinity of the foreign <b>brood,</b> making short flights around the entrance of the nest before reentering it. Most queens will choose to adopt the new colony rather than to abandon it, and the workers of the foreign <b>brood</b> will start working for the new queen. In contrast, queens that return to their original nests will incubate their <b>brood</b> and lather honey pot on its <b>brood</b> much more quickly.|$|R

5|$|The red wattlebird breeds {{throughout}} its range, with nesting taking place between July and December, though occasionally outside these months if conditions are favourable. One or two <b>broods</b> are laid each year.|$|E
5|$|This flycatcher {{typically}} raises two <b>broods</b> a year. The northern populations nest from January to June, {{while the}} southern populations nest from August to January. The male tufted tit-tyrant is aggressive during the breeding season, frequently chasing potential rivals in undulating flights while making a whirring sound.|$|E
5|$|A clutch {{consists}} of three to five light-blue eggs, and is incubated by the female alone. The eggs hatch after 14days, and the chicks leave the nest a further two weeks later. The altricial chicks are naked and have their eyes closed {{for the first few}} days after hatching. While the chicks are still young, the mother <b>broods</b> them continuously. When they are older, the mother will brood them only at night or during bad weather.|$|E
40|$|A {{hallmark}} of eusociality is cooperative <b>brood</b> care. In most social insect systems <b>brood</b> rearing labor is divided between individuals {{working in the}} nest tending the queen and larvae, and foragers collecting food outside the nest. To place <b>brood</b> rearing division of labor within an evolutionary context, {{it is necessary to}} understand relationships between individuals in the nest engaged in <b>brood</b> care and colony growth in the honey bee. Here we examined responses of the queen, queen-worker interactions, and nursing behaviors to an increase in the <b>brood</b> rearing stimulus environment using <b>brood</b> pheromone. Colony pairs were derived from a single source and were headed by open-mated sister queens, for a total of four colony pairs. One colony of a pair was treated with 336  µg of <b>brood</b> pheromone, and the other a blank control. Queens in the <b>brood</b> pheromone treated colonies laid significantly more eggs, were fed longer, and were less idle compared to controls. Workers spent significantly more time cleaning cells in pheromone treatments. Increasing the <b>brood</b> rearing stimulus environment with the addition of <b>brood</b> pheromone significantly increased the tempo of <b>brood</b> rearing behaviors by bees working in the nest resulting in a significantly greater amount of <b>brood</b> reared...|$|R
40|$|The most {{important}} criteria on scientific studies at honeybee colonies are colony population development. A commonly used division is to estimate capped and uncapped <b>brood</b> areas. At {{this point of}} view, {{it is important to}} measure <b>brood</b> area in colony beside frame of bees. <b>Brood</b> area that contained eggs, larvae, and pupae on the combs in each bee colony has been measured as its size. Assessing a whole colony for strength provides a very good snapshot in time of colony size, <b>brood</b> production and food status. The estimation technique may take a bit of getting used to, but with experience it can be done quickly and accurately. To estimate the total area of capped worker <b>brood</b> cells in the colony can be used usually a 1 x 1 inch wire grid placed over the <b>brood</b> comb to estimate the total square inches of <b>brood</b> for each side of the comb. Another alternative method is digital photography. Measurements of worker <b>brood</b> area are determined by measuring sealed <b>brood</b> to the nearest cm 2 using Adobe Photoshop CS 2 9. 0. This method based on estimating capped and uncapped <b>brood.</b> Colonies with new comb produced a greater area (cm 2) of <b>brood,</b> a greater area (cm 2) of sealed <b>brood...</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>Brood</b> {{is governed}} by a supreme matriarchy, {{at the top of}} which sits the <b>Brood</b> Empress. The <b>Brood</b> reproduces asexually and {{therefore}} has no clear divisions of gender. Although the <b>Brood</b> lives by a caste system, some of the roles have proven to be flexible.|$|R
5|$|Breeding occurs {{from late}} August through to January, though heavy rain in August may delay this. The nest is {{built by the}} female; it is a round or domed {{structure}} made of loosely woven grasses and spider webs, with an entrance in one side {{close to the ground}} and well-concealed in thick and often thorny vegetation, such as Acacia pulchella or a species of Hakea. One or two <b>broods</b> may be laid during the breeding season. A clutch of two to four dull white eggs with reddish-brown splotches and spots, measuring 12 × 16mm (½×⅝in), are laid. Incubation takes about two weeks. The female incubates the eggs for 14 or 15days; after hatching, nestlings are fed and their fecal sacs removed by all group members for 10–13days, by which time they are fledged. Young birds remain in the family group as helpers {{for a year or more}} before moving to another group, usually an adjacent one, or assuming a dominant position in the original group. In this role they feed and care for subsequent <b>broods.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Broods</b> {{that fail}} {{tend to do}} so during incubation. One English study showed that only 14.5% of eggs survived to hatching, but once that stage was reached the chances of {{fledging}} successfully were high. European nightjars breed when aged one year, and typically live for four years. The adult annual survival rate is 70%, but that for juveniles is unknown. The maximum known age in the wild is just over 12years.|$|E
5|$|Butterflies {{in their}} adult stage can live from {{a week to}} nearly a year {{depending}} on the species. Many species have long larval life stages while others can remain dormant in their pupal or egg stages and thereby survive winters. The Melissa Arctic (Oeneis melissa) overwinters twice as a caterpillar. Butterflies may have one or more <b>broods</b> per year. The number of generations per year varies from temperate to tropical regions with tropical regions showing a trend towards multivoltinism.|$|E
40|$|<b>Brood</b> size of Zebra Finches Taeniopygia guttata was {{manipulated}} in {{an attempt}} to identify a trade-off between current and subsequent reproduction in a laboratory situation with ad libitum food availability. The birds were able to raise a larger <b>brood</b> than the most frequent <b>brood</b> size under the same conditions. Initiation of the subsequent clutch was advanced after raising a small <b>brood,</b> and delayed after raising a large <b>brood.</b> The size of the subsequent clutch was not affected by the previous, experimental <b>brood</b> size. Thus, a cost of reproduction was observed in modification of the reproductive interval. <b>Brood</b> size also affected the prospects of the current, experimental <b>brood.</b> Both nestling survival and nestling weight at independence decreased with <b>brood</b> size. It has often been suggested that food availability limits reproduction in the field. This study shows that under unrestricted access to food, other factors restrain reproduction. Time allocation, energy expenditure and nutrient reserves of the parents are discussed as potential alternative constraints...|$|R
