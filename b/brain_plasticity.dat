25|$|Early {{acquisition}} of relative pitch allows for accelerated learning of scales and intervals. Musical training assists with the attentional and executive functioning necessary to interpret and efficiently encode music. In conjunction with <b>brain</b> <b>plasticity,</b> these processes {{become more and}} more stable. However, this process expresses a degree of circular logic in that the more learning that takes place, the greater the stability of the processes, ultimately decreasing overall <b>brain</b> <b>plasticity.</b> This could possibly explain the discrepancy in amount of effort both children and adults have to put into mastering new tasks.|$|E

25|$|Recent studies {{examining}} gene expression and evolutionary increases in brain size offer complimentary {{support for the}} role of sleep in the mammalian memory consolidation theory. Evolutionary advances {{in the size of the}} mammalian amygdala, (a brain structure active during sleep and involved in memory processing), are also associated with increases in NREM sleep durations. Likewise, nighttime gene expression differs from daytime expression and specifically targets genes thought to be involved in memory consolidation and <b>brain</b> <b>plasticity.</b>|$|E
25|$|A greater {{density of}} grey {{matter in the}} {{inferior}} parietal cortex is present in multilingual individuals. It {{has been found that}} multilingualism affects the structure, and essentially, the cytoarchitecture of the brain. Learning multiple languages re-structures the brain and some researchers argue that it increases the brain's capacity for plasticity. Most of these differences in brain structures in multilinguals may be genetic at the core. Consensus is still muddled; it may be a mixture of bothâ€”experiential (acquiring languages during life) and genetic (predisposition to <b>brain</b> <b>plasticity).</b>|$|E
40|$|Background: Excessive iron {{accumulation}} {{leads to}} iron toxicity in the brain; however the underlying mechanism is unclear. We investigated {{the effects of}} iron overload induced by high iron-diet consumption on brain mitochondrial function, <b>brain</b> synaptic <b>plasticity</b> and learning and memory. Iron chelator (deferiprone) and antioxidant (n-acetyl cysteine) effects on iron-overload brains were also studied. Methodology: Male Wistar rats were fed either normal diet or high iron-diet consumption for 12 weeks, after which rats in each diet group were treated with vehicle or deferiprone (50 mg/kg) or n-acetyl cysteine (100 mg/kg) or both for another 4 weeks. High iron-diet consumption caused brain iron accumulation, brain mitochondrial dysfunction, impaired <b>brain</b> synaptic <b>plasticity</b> and cognition, blood-brain-barrier breakdown, and brain apoptosis. Although both iron chelator and antioxidant attenuated these deleterious effects, combined therapy provided more robust results. Conclusion: In conclusion, {{this is the first}} study demonstrating that combined iron chelator and anti-oxidant therapy completely restored brain function impaired by iron overload...|$|R

25|$|Some {{evolutionary}} {{psychologists have}} argued that same-sex attraction does not have adaptive value because it has no association with potential reproductive success. Instead, bisexuality can be due to normal variation in <b>brain</b> <b>plasticity.</b> More recently, {{it has been suggested}} that same-sex alliances may have helped males climb the social hierarchy giving access to females and reproductive opportunities. Same-sex allies could have helped females to move to the safer and resource richer center of the group, which increased their chances of raising their offspring successfully.|$|E
25|$|Many {{research}} studies {{of individuals with}} amusia show {{that a number of}} cortical regions appear to be involved in processing music. Some report that the primary auditory cortex, secondary auditory cortex, and limbic system are responsible for this faculty, while more recent studies suggest that lesions in other cortical areas, abnormalities in cortical thickness, and deficiency in neural connectivity and <b>brain</b> <b>plasticity</b> may contribute to amusia. While various causes of amusia exist, some general findings that provide insight to the brain mechanisms involved in music processing are discussed below.|$|E
25|$|The {{relationship}} between sleep and memory has been postulated and studied {{since at least}} the early 19th century. Memory, the cognitive process whereby experiences, learning and recognition are recalled, is a product of <b>brain</b> <b>plasticity,</b> the structural changes within synapses that create associations between stimuli. Stimuli are encoded within milliseconds; however, the long-term maintenance of memories can take additional minutes, days, or even years to fully consolidate and become a stable memory (more resistant to change or interference). Therefore, the formation of a specific memory occurs rapidly, but the evolution of a memory is often an ongoing process.|$|E

25|$|The storage {{capacity}} of synaptic-based memory storage systems is very large, {{making it an}} attractive mechanism to study. There are approximately 104 synapses per neuron and 1011 neurons in the human <b>brain.</b> Nonsynaptic <b>plasticity</b> is often overlooked simply because its {{storage capacity}} is not as high. Regulating the density of ion channels in the axon and soma of a neuron would change the throughput and affect all of the synapses. Therefore, its storage capacity would be significantly {{less than that of}} synaptic plasticity.|$|R

25|$|Heightened <b>brain</b> <b>plasticity</b> {{in infants}} impacts later {{language}} development. Recent {{studies show that}} even brief exposure to a language in infancy changes how the brain processes a second-language acquisition. Participants in the studies who had transient language exposure as an infant or were multilingual showed greater brain activation in non-verbal working memory patterns, compared to monolingual speakers. The measure of uncommitted neural circuitry in infants can be accounted for {{in the perception of}} nonnative language at early stages of language acquisition. Research has shown that infants who show proficiency in nonnative phonetic perception at 7 months have slower language development than those who show proficiency in native phonetic perception. This research supports the Native Language Magnet/Neural Commitment Theory originally proposed by Patricia K. Kuhl.|$|E
25|$|The {{changes in}} {{quantity}} {{of a certain}} neurotransmitter {{as well as how}} the post-synaptic terminal responds to this change are underlying mechanisms of <b>brain</b> <b>plasticity.</b> During sleep there are remarkable changes in modulatory neurotransmitters throughout the brain.Acetylcholine is an excitatory neurotransmitter that is seen to increase to near waking levels during REM sleep while compared to lower levels during slow-wave sleep. Evidence has shown that functioning of the hippocampus dependent memory system (episodic memory and autobiographical memory) is directly affected by cholinergic changes throughout the wake-sleep cycle. High levels of ACh would promote information attained during wakefulness to be stored in the hippocampus. This is accomplished by suppressing previous excitatory connections while facilitating encoding without interference from previously stored information. During NREM sleep, and especially slow-wave sleep, low levels of Ach would cause the release of this suppression and allow for spontaneous recovery of hippocampal neurons resulting in the facilitation of memory consolidation.|$|E
25|$|Hearing {{begins in}} utero, but the central {{auditory}} system continues to develop {{for at least}} the first decade. There is considerable interest in the idea that disruption to hearing during a sensitive period may have long-term consequences for auditory development. One study showed thalamocortical connectivity in vitro was associated with a time sensitive developmental window and required a specific cell adhesion molecule (lcam5) for proper <b>brain</b> <b>plasticity</b> to occur. This points to connectivity between the thalamus and cortex shortly after being able to hear (in vitro) as at least one critical period for auditory processing. Another study showed that rats reared in a single tone environment during critical periods of development had permanently impaired auditory processing. â€˜Badâ€™ auditory experiences, such as temporary deafness by cochlear removal in rats leads to neuron shrinkage. In a study looking at attention in APD patients, children with one ear blocked developed a strong right-ear advantage but were not able to modulate that advantage during directed-attention tasks.|$|E

40|$|Long-term {{motor skill}} {{learning}} can induce plastic structural and functional {{reorganization of the}} brain. Our previous studies detected <b>brain</b> structural <b>plasticity</b> related to long-term intensive gymnastic training in world class gymnasts (WCGs). The goal {{of this study was}} to investigate <b>brain</b> functional <b>plasticity</b> in WCGs by using network measures of brain functional networks. Specifically, we acquired resting-state fMRI data from 13 WCGs and 14 controls, constructed their brain functional networks, and compared the differences in their network parameters. At the whole brain level, we detected significantly decreased overall functional connectivity (FC) and decreased local and global efficiency in the WCGs compared to the controls. At the modular level, we found intra- and inter-modular reorganization in three modules, the cerebellum, the cingulo-opercular and fronto-parietal networks, in the WCGs. On the nodal level, we revealed significantly decreased nodal strength and efficiency in several non-rich club regions of these three modules in the WCGs. These results suggested that functional plasticity can be detected in the brain functional networks of WCGs, especially in the cerebellum, fronto-parietal network, and cingulo-opercular network. In addition, we found that the FC between the fronto-parietal network and the sensorimotor network was significantly negatively correlated with the number of years of training in the WCGs. These findings may help us to understand the outstanding gymnastic performance of the gymnasts and to reveal the neural mechanisms that distinguish WCGs from controls...|$|R

Here we show that fear memory consolidation requires early post-training macromolecular synthesis in the anterior part of the retrosplenial cortex (aRSC), and that reversible pharmacological inactivation of this cortical region impairs recall of recent {{as well as of}} remote memories. These results challenge the generally accepted idea that neocortical areas are slow encoding systems that participate in the retrieval of remote memories only...|$|R

2500|$|In 1945, Justo Gonzalo {{concluded}} {{from his}} research of brain dynamics, that, {{contrary to the}} activity of the projection areas, the [...] "central" [...] cortical mass (more or less equidistant from the visual, tactile and auditive projection areas), would be a [...] "maneuvering mass", rather unspecific or multisensory, with capacity to increase neural excitability and re-organize the activity by means of [...] plasticity properties. [...] He gives as a first example of adaptation, to see upright with reversing glasses in the Stratton experiment, and specially, several first-hand brain injuries cases in which he observed dynamic and adaptive properties in their disorders, in particular in the inverted perception disorder [...] He stated that a sensory signal in a projection area would be only an inverted and constricted outline that would be magnified due to the increase in recruited cerebral mass, and re-inverted due to some effect of <b>brain</b> <b>plasticity,</b> in more central areas, following a spiral growth.|$|E
50|$|In humans, sound {{localization}} {{is primarily}} accomplished using {{information about how}} the intensity and timing of a sound vary between each ear. Neuronal computations involving these interaurual intensity differences (IIDs) and interaural time differences (ITDs) are typically carried out in different pathways in the <b>brain.</b> Short-term <b>plasticity</b> likely assists in differentiating between these two pathways: short-term facilitation dominates in intensity pathways, while short-term depression dominates in temporal pathways. These different types of short-term plasticity allow for different kinds of information filtration, thus contributing to {{the division of the}} two kinds of information into distinct processing streams.|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} primary {{motor cortex}} and <b>brain</b> stem <b>plasticity</b> {{in patients with}} Gilles de la Tourette syndrome. The study group comprised 12 patients with Gilles de la Tourette syndrome and 24 healthy subjects. Patients were clinically evaluated using the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale. We tested cortical plasticity by conditioning left primary motor cortex with intermittent or continuous theta-burst stimulation in 2 separate sessions. Test stimulation consisted of 20 motor-evoked potentials recorded from right first interosseous muscle before and after theta-burst stimulation. We also tested <b>brain</b> stem <b>plasticity</b> by conditioning the right supraorbital nerve with facilitatory electric high-frequency stimulation delivered {{at the same time}} as the late response of the blink reflex or inhibitory high-frequency stimulation delivered before the late response on 2 separate sessions. Test stimulation consisted of 10 blink reflexes from the right orbicularis oculi muscle before and after high-frequency stimulation. After intermittent theta-burst stimulation, motor-evoked potential amplitudes in healthy subjects increased significantly but remained unchanged in patients. Similarly, after continuous theta-burst stimulation, motor-evoked potential amplitudes decreased significantly in healthy subjects but did not in patients. After facilitatory high-frequency stimulation, the blink reflex late response area in healthy subjects increased, whereas after inhibitory high-frequency stimulation, it decreased. Conversely, in patients, both interventions left the blink reflex late response area unchanged. The lack of the expected inhibitory and facilitatory changes in motor-evoked potential amplitudes and blink reflex late response area suggests that abnormal plasticity in the primary motor cortex and brain stem play a role in the pathophysiology of Gilles de la Tourette syndrome.

2500|$|<b>Brain</b> <b>plasticity</b> {{refers to}} the brain's ability to change {{structure}} and function. This ties into the common phrase, [...] "if you don't use it, you lose it," [...] which {{is another way of}} saying, if you don't use it, your brain will devote less somatotopic space for it. One proposed mechanism for the observed age-related plasticity deficits in animals is the result of age-induced alterations in calcium regulation. [...] The changes in our abilities to handle calcium will ultimately influence neuronal firing and the ability to propagate action potentials, which in turn would affect the ability of the brain to alter its structure or function (i.e. its plastic nature). Due to the complexity of the brain, with all of its structures and functions, it is logical to assume that some areas would be more vulnerable to aging than others. Two circuits worth mentioning here are the hippocampal and neocortical circuits. [...] It has been suggested that age-related cognitive decline is due in part not to neuronal death but to synaptic alterations. Evidence in support of this idea from animal work has also suggested that this cognitive deficit is due to functional and biochemical factors such as changes in enzymatic activity, chemical messengers, or gene expression in cortical circuits.|$|E
2500|$|Walker and Stickgold {{hypothesized}} that after initial memory acquisition, sleep reorganizes memory representation at a macro-brain systems level. Their experiment {{consisted of two}} groups; the night-sleep group was taught a motor sequence block tapping task at night, put to sleep and then retested 12 hours later. The day-wake group was taught the same task {{in the morning and}} tested 12 hours later with no intervening sleep. FMRI was used to measure brain activity during retest. Results indicated significantly fewer errors/sequence in the night-sleep group compared to the day wake group. FMRI output for the night-sleep group indicated increased activation in the right primary motor cortex/M1/Prefrontal Gyrus (contra lateral to the hand they were block tapping with), right anterior medial prefrontal lobe, right hippocampus (long-term memory, spatial memory), right ventral striatum (olfactory tubercle, nucleus accumbens), as well as regions of the cerebellum (lobules V1, V11). In the day-wake group, fMRI showed [...] "decreased" [...] signal activation bilaterally in the parietal cortices (integrates multiple modalities), in addition to the left insular cortex (regulation of homeostasis), left temporal pole (most anterior of temporal cortex), and the left inferior fronto-polar cortex. Previous investigations have shown that signal increases indicate <b>brain</b> <b>plasticity.</b> The increased signal activity seen in M1 after sleep corresponds to increased activity in this area seen during practice; however, an individual must practice for longer periods than they would have to sleep in order to obtain the same level of M1 signal increases. Therefore, it is suggested that sleep enhances the cortical representation of motor tasks by brain system expansion, as seen by increased signal activity.|$|E
