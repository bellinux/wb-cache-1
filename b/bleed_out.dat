5|$|Ted Harbison (Kevin Kaine) {{is found}} dead in a park. Dr. Megan Hunt (Dana Delany) investigates into his death and whilst investigating, it is {{revealed}} Ted had surgery just before he died, and Megan finds three surgical staples that weren't closed fully, causing him to <b>bleed</b> <b>out</b> internally, causing Megan to think that Ted was murdered. Megan visits her old hospital, where she was once a neurosurgeon. Ted's surgeon, Doctor Chandler (Marc Blucas) {{has a reputation for}} recklessness whilst performing surgeries and Megan finds out that the video was never turned on, meaning the surgery was never recorded. Whilst at the hospital, Megan meets her old friend and the hospital administrator Gwen Baldwin (Carolyn McCormick) and whilst there Gwen reveals her son died of an overdose. Meanwhile, in Philadelphia, Ethan (Geoffrey Arend) and Curtis (Windell Middlebrooks) autopsy Jessica Archer (Christina Hendricks), with both Ethan and Curtis unsure how she died. Jessica's twin sister arrives, Karen (Hendricks), and she and Ethan are attracted to each other.|$|E
25|$|Blood squirt (blood spurt, blood spray, blood gush, {{or blood}} jet) {{is the effect}} when an artery, a blood vessel {{in the human body}} (or other organism's body) is cut. Blood {{pressure}} causes the blood to <b>bleed</b> <b>out</b> at a rapid, intermittent rate, in a spray or jet, coinciding with the beating of the heart, rather than the slower, but steady flow of venous bleeding. Also known as arterial bleeding, arterial spurting, or arterial gushing, the amount of blood loss can be copious, occur very rapidly, and can lead to death.|$|E

25|$|Once buffalo were located, hunting did {{not begin}} until the tribal priests {{considered}} the time propitious. The hunt began by the men stealthily advancing together toward the buffalo, {{but no one could}} kill any buffalo until the warriors of the tribe gave the signal, in order not to startle the animals before the hunters could get in position for the attack on the herd. Anyone who broke ranks could be severely beaten. During the chase, the hunters guided their ponies with their knees and wielded bows and arrows. They could incapacitate buffalo with a single arrow shot into the flank between the lower ribs and the hip. The animal would soon lie down and perhaps <b>bleed</b> <b>out,</b> or the hunters would finish it off. An individual hunter might shoot as many as five buffalo in this way before backtracking and finishing them off. They preferred to kill cows and young bulls, as the taste of older bulls was disagreeable.|$|E
25|$|Before the New 52, the Trident, {{granted by}} Poseidon to the {{rightful}} ruler and {{protector of the}} seas, was indestructible and a very powerful melee weapon, able to destroy the very powerful Imperiex Probes for instance, which Aquaman wielded with unmatched skill. Apart from its power as a melee weapon, the Trident also {{had the power to}} manipulate water, fire bolts of powerful energy and act as a focus to amplify the magical power of others, most notably Tempest. In the New 52, the Trident is now part of a collection of seven very powerful Atlantean magical items, forged by the first king of Atlantis who calls himself 'The Dead King'. Thought to be the most powerful weapon of the set, {{with the possible exception of}} the recently discovered seventh item, the Trident is completely indestructible and able to hurt even the most powerful of opponents, such as the evil god Darkseid, with Aquaman being the only leaguer to puncture and make him <b>bleed</b> <b>out.</b> He was also able to break the mystical barrier of Dr. Graves which was deemed indestructible at the time. In one instance, the Trident was shown glowing with magical power when Black Manta used the rest of the items to discover the hidden seventh one. For a time, Aquaman withheld the Trident of said aforementioned god of the oceans in his battles against the Thule and Rao's disciples, which gave him the power to summon tsunamis and deluges, call down thunder and lighting, project and control ice, move the earth making it rise and tremble at his command, as well as teleport himself from global to interplanetary distances using water as a medium. It could also transform into a gladius and back at will. Arthur also uses both versions of the trident to boost the range his telepathy.|$|E
500|$|The player's {{health is}} {{represented}} by a red [...] "Crimson Omen" [...] that fades onto the screen the more damage the player takes; staying {{out of the line}} of fire allows the player to recover their health. Depending on the game mode or difficulty, if the player takes too much damage, they enter a downed state where they can crawl around the map to get out of battle and seek help. During this time, a teammate can revive him, an enemy may brutally execute the downed player, or the player may <b>bleed</b> <b>out</b> if too much time has passed. The player can also grab a downed character and use them as a meatshield, allowing the body to absorb damage but forcing the player to use a one-handed pistol. Explosive weapons will simply destroy the character they strike. Like its predecessor, Gears of War 2 features an optional mature content filter, which, when active, makes blood appear as sparks and removes harsh language from the dialogue. Furthermore, progress towards most of the Xbox achievements for the game can be earned in either campaign or multiplayer modes.|$|E

500|$|Levinson said he {{considered}} the interrogation scene in [...] "Gone for Goode" [...] between Braugher, Secor and Chaplin, to be the [...] "defining scene" [...] for Frank Pembleton's character because it defined the character's intelligence, quirkiness, sharp instincts and sneaky interrogation style. While filming that scene, Levinson commented to Tom Fontana that the acting was so effective, an entire episode could be filmed revolving strictly around an interrogation. The comments partially inspired Fontana to write the first-season episode, [...] "Three Men and Adena", which {{became one of the}} most critically acclaimed Homicide episodes. The final scene of the episode features Bayliss responding to the murder scene of Adena Watson in a rainy alleyway. The body was wrapped in a red raincoat, and Levinson worked with colorists to <b>bleed</b> <b>out</b> all the colors except that red to give the film a stark look. [...] "Gone for Goode" [...] originally included a scene with Gee and Bayliss discussing detective work at the police station. The scene, which was cut from the final episode, featured Gee comparing the work to challenges faced by literary character Sherlock Holmes, as well as Gee mistakenly referring to Holmes' antagonist Moriarty as [...] "Murray".|$|E
500|$|George O'Malley is {{introduced}} {{as a fellow}} surgical intern to Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo), Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh), Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl) and Alex Karev (Justin Chambers); the five of them working under Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson). O'Malley and Stevens move in with Meredith, for whom he has romantic feelings but did not express them due to his fear of rejection {{and the fact that}} she and one of the attendings Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey) had a mutual interest in one another. On the first day of internship, O'Malley is selected by chief of cardiothoracic surgery Preston Burke (Isaiah Washington) as the first intern to perform surgery. He freezes in the operating room, and is mocked by his peers, and earns the nickname [...] "007" [...] because of almost killing a patient in such a simple operation (referring to James Bond's [...] "licence to kill"). O'Malley dates nurse Olivia Harper (Sarah Utterback), breaking up with her when he contracts syphilis from her, which she in turn contracted from Karev. His friendship with Karev is further strained when the two become trapped in an elevator with a patient who begins to <b>bleed</b> <b>out.</b> Karev freezes, and O'Malley is able to save the patient single-handedly. He goes on to admit his feelings to Meredith, and the two have a one-night stand. When Meredith tells him that sleeping together was a mistake, O'Malley begins avoiding her and starts dating orthopedic surgeon Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez).|$|E

2500|$|Efforts {{are made}} to improve the {{techniques}} used in slaughterhouses. Temple Grandin has worked closely with Jewish slaughterers to design handling systems for cattle, and has said: [...] "When the cut is done correctly, the animal appears not to feel it. [...] From an animal welfare standpoint, the major concern during ritual slaughter are the stressful and cruel methods of restraint (holding) {{that are used in}} some plants." [...] When shackling and hoisting is used, it is recommended [...] that cattle not be hoisted clear of the floor until they have had time to <b>bleed</b> <b>out.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Later, patient Miles (Tongayi Chirisa) {{attempts}} {{to commit suicide}} by slicing his wrists. As the staff stem the bleeding, Sister Mary Eunice notices that he has written the name ◊©÷∏◊Å◊ó÷∑◊™ (Shachat: to destroy, corrupt, go to ruin, decay) in ancient Aramaic on the wall. She urgently questions him, asking if he [...] "summoned her," [...] though he does not remember doing it. He is bandaged and placed in solitary. There, the angel appears {{to him and he}} begs for her help to release him from life. She complies and his stitches open up, causing him to <b>bleed</b> <b>out</b> and die. The angel senses someone watching her and reveals her true name, Shachath, and sees that it is Sister Mary Eunice. The angel recognizes that Sister Mary Eunice is possessed by [...] "one like , but fallen." [...] Sister Mary Eunice's true personality tearfully calls out to Shachath to free her from her possession, however, the demon possessing her regains control and tells Shachath that she will not leave Sister Mary Eunice's body. The angel says that unlike the demon, she was invited to Briarcliff and still has work to do, leaving Sister Mary Eunice alone.|$|E

The screw can be turned out to varying degrees to allow air to <b>bleed</b> <b>out</b> of the system, relieving pressure on the wastegate actuator, thus increasing boost levels. These devices are popular due to their negligible cost compared to other devices that may offer the same power increase.|$|E

John dies and the man begins to threaten Maddie's cat. She shoots him with the crossbow but only hits his shoulder. While running back inside, her hand gets caught {{in the front door}} and the man stomps on it and crushes it. He threatens to enter, and she taunts him by writing [...] "do it, coward" [...] on the door with her blood.

50|$|The {{benefit of}} a {{percutaneous}} access is in the ease of introducing devices into the patient {{without the use of}} large cut downs, which can be painful and in some cases can <b>bleed</b> <b>out</b> or become infected.
