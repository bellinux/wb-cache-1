During the lawsuit, it was revealed that Barnette had been convicted of larceny in Oregon. As his legal bills added up, Barnette decided to lease the Fairbanks Daily News to a group of local businessmen. On June 15, 1908, Barnette ended the lease agreement by selling the newspaper to J. Harmon Caskey and Henry Roden. That same year, the campaign to elect Alaska's first delegate to Congress was under way, and one of the candidates, Jack Corson, purchased one-third of the newspaper. Corson's campaign manager promptly was named the editor of the Daily News, and the paper switched to actively supporting Corson's candidacy.|$|E

25|$|In 1982, Wilson won the Republican {{primary in}} California {{to replace the}} {{retiring}} U.S. Senator S. I. Hayakawa. Wilson's Democratic opponent was the outgoing two-term Governor Jerry Brown. Wilson {{was known as a}} fiscal conservative who supported Proposition 13, although Wilson had opposed the measure while mayor of San Diego. However, Brown ran on his gubernatorial record of building the largest state budget surpluses in California history. Both Wilson and Brown were moderate-to-liberal on social issues, including support for abortion rights. The election was expected to be close, with Brown holding a slim lead in most of the polls leading up to Election Day. Wilson hammered away at Brown's appointment of California Chief Justice Rose Bird, using this to portray himself as tougher on crime than Brown was. Brown's late entry into the 1980 Democratic presidential primary, after promising not to run, was also an issue. President Ronald Reagan made a number of visits to California late in the race to campaign for Wilson. Reagan quipped that the last thing he wanted to see was one of his home state's U.S. Senate seats falling into Democrats' hands, especially to be occupied <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> succeeded him as governor. Despite exit polls indicating a narrow Brown victory, Wilson edged him out to win the election. A major contributing factor may also have been a late influx of the Armenian vote in the California governor's race between George Deukmejian and Tom Bradley. Many of these votes came from heavily Republican areas. The Deukmejian voters likely also voted for Wilson for senator.|$|E

The episode also saw the return of UNIT and introduced their new scientific advisor, Kate Stewart (Jemma Redgrave), daughter of Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart.

500|$|On 1 January 1945, Haruna {{was removed}} from the {{deactivated}} Third Battleship Division and transferred to the First Battleship Division of the Second Fleet. On 10 February, Haruna was assigned to the Kure Naval District. On 19 March 1945, American carrier aircraft attacked the remainder of the Japanese Navy at Kure. The base was defended by veteran Japanese fighter instructors flying Kawanishi N1K-J [...] "Shiden" [...] or [...] "George" [...] fighters, led <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> planned the attack on Pearl Harbor, Minoru Genda. These fighter planes were superior in some respects to America's main fighter, the F6F Hellcat.

He told the members that a netsuke was at one time carefully carved <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> wore it, building [...] "something of himself into the design", and although a class of professional netsuke makers arose later, whose work might have been more technically adept, it was, [...] "ordinarily cold, stiff, and without imagination....

[...] Jon Pareles of The New York Times wrote that [...] "If history is any guide, Vanilla Ice's adoption of rap-metal means that hard rock is about to move on." [...] Richard Torres of Rolling Stone gave the album two out of five stars, writing that while [...] "nothing, however, can redeem Ice's wack boasting," [...] the album [...] "isn't half-bad." [...] The New Rolling Stone Album Guide gave the album three out of five stars. The Iowa State Daily called the album [...] "the greatest pop culture comeback of all time". The album did not chart. The album appeared on The A.V. Club's list of the [...] "Least Essential Albums of the '90s," [...] at number 24 on Maxim's list of the [...] "30 Worst Albums of All Time", and number 26 on Qs list of the [...] "50 Worst Albums Ever!"

2500|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} in Arabic grammar that a participle can carry tense. This tense, however, is typically {{limited to the}} present and future. But when we use the above construction, the past can be connoted by the participle as well {{due to the nature}} of relative clauses. For example, one may say [...] (I passed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> was riding his steed yesterday).|$|E
2500|$|When al- is prefixed to a participle, it {{acts like}} a {{relative}} pronoun. For {{the purposes of this}} rule, participles include [...] (the active participle), [...] (the passive participle), [...] (another participle in Arabic), etc. For example, [...] This is translated as “I passed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> was riding his steed” as opposed to something like “I passed by the rider of his steed.” Consequently, all the rules of Arabic relative pronouns and their clauses will apply here.|$|E
