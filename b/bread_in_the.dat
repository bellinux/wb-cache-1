5|$|When the October journées took place, France's revolutionary decade, 1789–1799, {{had barely}} begun. The revolution's {{capacity}} for violence was as yet not fully realized. The storming of the Bastille had occurred {{less than three}} months earlier. Flush with newly discovered power, the common citizens of France – particularly in the teeming capital, Paris – felt a newly discovered desire to participate in politics and government. The poorest among them were almost exclusively concerned with the issue of food: most workers spent nearly half their income on <b>bread.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> post-Bastille period, price inflation and severe shortages in Paris became commonplace, as did local incidents of violence in the marketplaces.|$|E
5|$|No major {{alterations}} {{have been}} made since the Reformation in the 1530s and 1540s, {{but there have been}} many changes to the interior to accommodate various phases of Church of England worship. Among these are an oven used for baking communion <b>bread</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> south east corner of the north chapel. During the Civil War, considerable damage was done including the destruction of nearly all of the medieval stained glass. William III of England worshipped in the church following his landing in the Glorious Revolution of 1689. By the early 19th century, all the medieval furnishings, except the Norman font had disappeared. New pews were made and the west galleries were added in 1808-11. The latest restoration that has left the church interior visible today, took place in the late 19th century; it was more sympathetic to the church's architectural character than many Victorian restorations. At this time, the central section of the west gallery was removed to reveal the great west window and the organ was relocated to the south transept. The pews date from around 1900 and have attractive carved bench-ends. The church has been designated by English Heritage as a Grade I listed building.|$|E

5|$|Expert bakers {{who arrived}} among the {{immigrants}} from Eastern and Central Europe <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1920s and 30s introduced handmade sourdough breads. From the 1950s, mass-produced bread replaced these loaves and standard, government subsidized loaves known as leḥem aḥid became mostly available until the 1980s, when specialized bakeries again began producing rich sourdough <b>breads</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> European tradition, and <b>breads</b> <b>in</b> a Mediterranean style with accents such as olives, cheese, herbs or sun-dried tomatoes.

25|$|When the Pharaoh {{freed the}} Israelites, {{it is said}} that they left in such a hurry that they could not wait for bread dough to rise (leaven). In commemoration, for the {{duration}} of Passover no leavened bread is eaten, for which reason Passover was called the feast of unleavened <b>bread</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Torah or Old Testament. Thus matzo (flat unleavened bread) is eaten during Passover and it is a tradition of the holiday.|$|E

Attachment of nitrogen-fixing bacteria to plant roots and soil particles, which is important for colonisation of rhizosphere and roots and for infection of the plant, can be mediated by exopolysaccharides as well. An example for industrial use of exopolysaccharides is the application of dextran in panettone and other <b>breads</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bakery industry.

25|$|Although {{many members}} of the Church of England today would still be uncomfortable or sceptical about certain Catholic liturgical practices, they can be {{astonished}} to be told that, in the late 19th century, using incense, wearing vestments, putting candles on the altar and using unleavened (wafer) <b>bread</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Eucharist could spark riots, put priests in prison and even led in 1888–90 to the prosecution of a bishop – Edward King, Bishop of Lincoln.|$|E
25|$|Contrary to {{mainland}} practices, corn was not {{ground into}} flour and baked into bread, but was cooked and eaten off the cob.

The Taíno grew squash, beans, peppers, peanuts, and pineapples. Tobacco, calabashes (West Indian pumpkins) and cotton were grown around the houses. Other fruits and vegetables, such as palm nuts, guavas, and Zamia roots, were collected from the wild.|$|E
25|$|Saint Job also critiqued Roman Catholic teachings {{regarding}} the use of unleavened <b>bread</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Eucharist, among other doctrinal differences in the face of Roman Catholic persecution of Orthodoxy following the Union of Brest (1596). Many Orthodox Christians living in Poland at the time were deprived of their rights, and attempts were made to force them to convert to Catholicism. A number of Orthodox bishops even became apostates to Uniatism. To counteract this problem, St. Job and others defended Orthodoxy by copying and disseminating Orthodox books. Prince Ostrozhsky was also responsible for the Ostrog Bible (1581), the first printed edition of the complete Orthodox Bible.|$|E

It is usual to distinguish broadly between northern and southern styles of Indian cuisine, recognising that within those categories are innumerable sub-styles and variations. The distinction is commonly made with reference to the staple starch: wheat <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of unleavened <b>breads</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> north; rice <b>in</b> <b>the</b> east; rice and millet <b>in</b> <b>the</b> south.|$|R
25|$|Analysis of Ötzi's {{intestinal}} contents showed two meals (the {{last one}} consumed about eight hours before his death), one of chamois meat, {{the other of}} red deer and herb bread. Both were eaten with grain as well as roots and fruits. The grain from both meals was a highly processed einkorn wheat bran, quite possibly eaten {{in the form of}} <b>bread.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> proximity of the body, and thus possibly originating from the Iceman's provisions, chaff and grains of einkorn and barley, and seeds of flax and poppy were discovered, as well as kernels of sloes (small plumlike fruits of the blackthorn tree) and various seeds of berries growing in the wild. Hair analysis was used to examine his diet from several months before.|$|E
25|$|By {{entering}} into the Union, Atanasie {{and the other}} bishops, along with their respective dioceses accepted the supreme authority of the Pope, {{while at the same}} time being granted the right to keep their own Greek Byzantine liturgical rite. A Diploma issued by the Emperor Leopold I declared that Transylvania's Romanian Orthodox Church is one with the Roman Catholic Church. Transylvanian Romanians were therefore encouraged to convert to Catholicism and join the newly created Greek-Catholic Church, while being able to retain the Byzantine rite, if at the same time they accepted four doctrinal points promulgated by the Council of Florence (1431 and 1445): the supreme authority of the Pope over the entire church; the existence of Purgatory; the Filioque clause; and the validity of the use of unleavened <b>bread</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> celebration of the Eucharist in the Latin Church (Eastern Orthodox had contended that Roman Catholic use of unleavened bread was erroneous).|$|E
