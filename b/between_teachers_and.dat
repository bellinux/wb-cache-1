5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that schoolchildren in Malawi {{are at risk}} of being exposed to HIV by their teachers, who sometimes value them as sexual partners because they believe that children have not yet been exposed to the virus. Children are particularly vulnerable to exploitation by adults who offer them money in exchange for sex; because they are often unable to afford basic necessities, they might feel compelled to accept gifts in exchange for sex out of desperation. Interviews indicate that teachers and school administrators in Malawi often misinterpret the definition of sexual assault, as some believe that sexual relations <b>between</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>and</b> students are appropriate as long as the children have consented. Although most schools have strict policies against sexual abuse, children are often hesitant to accuse adults of wrongdoing, and many administrators are unwilling or unable to investigate the truth behind the accusations.|$|E

Thirty-one general education <b>teachers</b> <b>and</b> 576 children from five public ele-mentary schools completed social status, behavioral, and peer buddy nomination measures.

2500|$|Self-determination is {{the ability}} to make choices and {{exercise}} a high degree of control, such as what the student does and how they do it (Deci et al., 1991; Reeve, Hamm, & Nix, 2003; Ryan & Deci, 2002). Self-determination can be supported by providing opportunities for students to be challenged, such as leadership opportunities, providing appropriate feedback and fostering, establishing and maintaining good relationships <b>between</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>and</b> students. These strategies can increase students' interest, competence, creativity and desire to be challenged and ensure that students are intrinsically motivated to study. On the other hand, students who lack self-determination are more likely to feel their success is out of their control. Such students lose motivation to study, which causes a state of [...] "helpless learning". Students who feel helpless readily believe they will fail and therefore cease to try. Over time, a vicious circle of low achievement develops.|$|E
2500|$|In England, public {{boarding}} schools, {{with their}} homosocial environment, often encouraged an homoerotic atmosphere, {{due to the}} emphasis on the Classics, and homosexual relations were formed and quietly accepted, both between older and younger boys and even <b>between</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>and</b> pupils; however, some scandals arose around such relationships. [...] In the mid-19th century, William Johnson Cory, a renowned master at Eton from 1845 until his forced resignation in 1872, evolved a style of pedagogic pederasty which influenced a number of his pupils. [...] His Ionica, a work of poetry reflecting his pederastic sensibilities, was read in intellectual circles and [...] "made a stir" [...] at Oxford in 1859. Oscar Browning, another Eton master and former student of Cory, followed in his tutor's footsteps, only to be likewise dismissed in 1875. [...] Both are thought to have influenced Oxford don Walter Pater, whose aesthetics promoted pederasty as the truest expression of classical culture.|$|E

During the late Edo period and the early Meiji period, several private prep schools often used {{students}} as assistant teachers and it was called [...] "Learning half and teaching half". Keio also had initially used this system. In the early period of such schools of Western studies, there had been many things to learn not only for students but also professors themselves. Hence there had been sometimes the occasions that students who had learned in advance had taught other students and even professors. After the proper legal systems for education had been set up, those situations have disappeared. However, Fukuzawa thought the essence of academia was and is a continuous learning, and knowing more things provides more learning opportunities. Keio respects his thought and put the rule in [...] "" [...] that there shouldn't be any hierarchy <b>between</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>and</b> learners, {{and all of the}} people in Keio Gijuku are in the same company. For this reason, there is still a culture in this university that all professors and lecturers are officially called with the honorific of [...] "Kun" [...] but never [...] "Teacher" [...] or [...] "Professor".|$|E

2500|$|The National School Boards Association {{reports that}} almost 60% of {{students}} who use social networking talk about education topics online, and more than 50% talk specifically about schoolwork. Yet {{the vast majority of}} school districts have stringent rules against nearly all forms of social networking during the school day—even though students and parents report few problem behaviors online. Social networks focused on supporting relationships <b>between</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>and</b> their students are now used for learning, educator professional development, and content sharing. HASTAC is a collaborative social network space for new modes of learning and research in higher education, K-12, and lifelong learning; Ning supports teachers; TermWiki, Learn Central, TeachStreet and other sites are being built to foster relationships that include educational blogs, eportfolios, formal and ad hoc communities, as well as communication such as chats, discussion threads, and synchronous forums. These sites also have content sharing and rating features. Social networks are also emerging as online yearbooks, both public and private. One such service is MyYearbook, which allows anyone from the general public to register and connect. A new trend emerging is [...] private label yearbooks accessible only by students, parents, and teachers of a particular school, similar to Facebook's beginning within Harvard.|$|E
6000|$|It {{should be}} {{considered}} also, that grave moral consequences depend upon the habitual pleasure or pain which daily lessons produce. No one can compare the faces and manners of two boys--the one made happy by mastering interesting subjects, and the other made miserable by disgust with his studies, by consequent inability, by cold looks, by threats, by punishment--without seeing that the disposition of the one is being benefited {{and that of the}} other injured. Whoever has marked the effects of success and failure upon the mind, {{and the power of the}} mind over the body, will see that in the one case both temper and health are favourably affected, while in the other there is danger of permanent moroseness, or permanent timidity, and even of permanent constitutional depression. There remains yet another indirect result of no small moment. The relationship <b>between</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>and</b> their pupils is, other things equal, rendered friendly and influential, or antagonistic and powerless, according as the system of culture produces happiness or misery. Human beings are at the mercy of their associated ideas. A daily minister of pain cannot fail to be regarded with secret dislike; and if he causes no emotions but painful ones, will inevitably be hated. Conversely, he who constantly aids children to their ends, hourly provides them with the satisfactions of conquest, hourly encourages them through their difficulties and sympathises in their successes, will be liked; nay, if his behaviour is consistent throughout, must be loved. And when we remember how efficient and benign is the control of a master who is felt to be a friend, when compared with the control of one who is looked upon with aversion, or at best indifference, we may infer that the indirect advantages of conducting education on the happiness principle do not fall far short of the direct ones. To all who question the possibility of acting out the system here advocated, we reply as before, that not only does theory point to it, but experience commends it. To the many verdicts of distinguished teachers who since Pestalozzi's time have testified this, may be here added that of Professor Pillans, who asserts that [...] "where young people are taught as they ought to be, they are quite as happy in school as at play, seldom less delighted, nay, often more, with the well-directed exercise of their mental energies than with that of their muscular powers." ...|$|E
