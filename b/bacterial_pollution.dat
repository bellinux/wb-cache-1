This experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of different peppermint’s essential oil concentrations (0, 300, 600 and 900 ppm) along with sucrose levels (0, 3 and 6 %) in a factorial experiment based on the completely randomized design with three replications. Water relations, cell membrane integrity, leaf yellowing disorder and bacterial contaminations of preservative solution of alstroemeria cut flower were evaluated under different treatments. Based on the results, application of essential oil (600 ppm) and sucrose (6 %) significantly increased water uptake, cell membrane integrity and photosynthetic pigments, and decreased leaf yellowing disorder and <b>bacterial</b> <b>pollutions,</b> leading, consequently, to higher vase life (14 days) relative to the control cut flowers. It appears that application of peppermint’s essential oil (due to anti bacterial compounds such as menthone and menthol) and sucrose (due to food supply and cell membrane maintenance) could be recommended for addition to the preservative solutions of alstroemeria cut flowers...|$|R

40|$|Introduction : Hospital {{infections are}} one of the {{important}} reasons of mortality and incurred expenses. Therefore, we must control these infections by identifying contamination sources. The aim of this study was the determination of <b>bacterial</b> <b>pollution</b> of corrugated anesthesia sets in surgical rooms. Methods: This study was an analytic-description one performed in training hospitals of Yazd city. Research sample was 440 cases provided from different parts of corrugate after completing the anesthesia period by wet sterile swabs and transferred to culture media. On Thursday, each week, a sample from different parts of tube after sterilizing with cetrimide solution was obtained. Finally, after 24 hours, culture medias were studied for colony growth. Results: Obtained results indicated that of 440 cases taken samples, 343 cases were without <b>bacterial</b> <b>pollution,</b> 71 cases (19. 29 %) had <b>bacterial</b> <b>pollution</b> of samples before sterilizing and 26 cases (36. 1 %) were polluted after tube sterilizing. Conclusion: Sampling and culturing from used equipment and tools in hospital is one of the important actions for identifying and controlling hospital infections. Obtained results from this study indicated that of 440 cases, there were 97 cases of pollution. Therefore, it is suggested that anti bacterial filters should be installed before Y form piece of tubes in anesthesia machines and disposable corrugated tubes should replace traditional tubes.

During the 19 th century, waterborne diseases were responsible for large epidemics of dysentery, typhoid fever, cholera, among others (Smith 2002). Today, these diseases are the cause of very high mortality rates in the populations of developing countries.

The presence and levels of bacterial indicators do not always correlate with the presence and concentration of viruses, especially when these indicators are present in low concentrations. Although some groups of bacteriophages have been suggested as alternative indicators, phage levels do not correlate with the presence of other viruses, including those that are pathogens for humans.

The results indicate that adhesion by different strains under varying environmental conditions is more variable than previously recognized and that sediment-adhered bacteria can represent a significant population.

In this review a general characterization of the most important bacterial diseases transmitted through water—cholera, typhoid fever and bacillary dysentery—is presented, focusing on the biology and ecology of the causal agents and on the diseases’ characteristics and their life cycles in the environment. The importance of pathogenic Escherichia coli strains and emerging pathogens in drinking water-transmitted diseases is also briefly discussed. Microbiological water analysis is mainly based on the concept of fecal indicator bacteria. The main bacteria present in human and animal feces (focusing on their behavior in their hosts and in the environment) and the most important fecal indicator bacteria are presented and discussed (focusing on the advantages and limitations of their use as markers).

A total of 90 water samples were collected in sterile glass bottles from 3 dams’ water reservoirs, a river, and a large diameter well, respectively. The water samples were treated in triplicate with Moringa oleifera seed and defatted cake coagulants. At different settling time and coagulant concentration, turbidity and pH were measured to determine the optimal conditions and factors influencing treatment with regard to sampling source. Nine physicochemical parameters (turbidity, pH, nitrates, nitrites, calcium, magnesium, total hardness, organic matter and sulfates), three <b>bacterial</b> fecal <b>pollution</b> indicators (Escherichia coli, fecal Coliforms and fecal Streptococcus) and parasite cysts were monitored based on laboratory standard methods. Data were analyzed using the Student’ t test and XLSTAT 7. 5. 2 statistical software. From the results obtained, for the same concentration of coagulant, settling times providing the lowest turbidity were significantly shorter (p< 0. 0001) with Moringa oleifera cake than seed. Optimum settling time with Moringa oleifera cake was between 15 - 60 min versus 60 - 120 min, with Moringa oleifera seed. Both treatments reduced significantly minerals concentration in water excepted sulfates for which the concentration reversely increased.
