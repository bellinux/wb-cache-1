50|$|Avena strigosa (also called {{lopsided}} oat, <b>bristle</b> <b>oat</b> {{or black}} oat; syn. Avena hispanica Ard.) is {{a species of}} grass native to Europe, and its seeds are edible. This plant is often cultivated as animal feed in the south Brazil, and it is sometimes reported as a weed.|$|E
40|$|The {{experiment}} was undertaken at the Faculty of Agrarian and Veterinary Sciences (FCAV) Jaboticabal, São Paulo State, Brazil, during winter-spring-summer of 2001 - 2002, {{to determine the}} fractionation of nitrogen and carbohydrates in Tifton 85 (Cynodon dactylon Vanderyst x Cynodon nlemfuensis (L.) Pers), exclusively or oversown with winter annual forage species. Treatments comprised <b>bristle</b> <b>oat</b> (Avena strigosa Schreb), yellow oat (Avena byzantina C. Koch), triticale (X Triticosecale Wittmack), <b>bristle</b> <b>oat</b> + yellow oat, <b>bristle</b> <b>oat</b> + triticale, yellow oat + triticale, <b>bristle</b> <b>oat</b> + yellow oat + triticale seeded in Tifton 85 and sole crop (control). Experimental design was composed of completely randomized blocks with three replications. Fodder was cut 20 cm high (presence of winter forage) and 10 cm high (Tifton 85 pasture). Crude protein, total carbohydrate and the fractions of nitrogen compounds and carbohydrates were determined. Decrease {{was reported in the}} levels of chemical compounds in winter forage species and in Tifton 85 during the evaluation periods. The content of nitrogen compounds and carbohydrates varied widely during the evaluation period according to the morphological characteristics of grass species and botanical composition of pastures...|$|E
40|$|An {{experiment}} was {{conducted during the}} 2001 - 2002 winter-spring-summer to determine the nitrogen and carbohydrate fractions in Tifton- 85 pastures exclusively or overseeded with oats, millet and sorghum-sudangrass hybrids. The treatments were Tifton- 85 overseeded with millet + bristle oat; sorghum-sudangrass + <b>bristle</b> <b>oat,</b> on 06 / 19 / 2002 and 07 / 02 / 2002, respectively; and Tifton- 85 (Control). The {{experiment was}} conducted in a randomized block design with three replications. Nitrogen and carbohydrate fractions were affected by the nitrogen and total carbohydrate contents observed in the pasture overseeded at different seeding times, and by the different growth periods. The highest nitrogen fractions (A + B 1) were observed in the early growth periods. Overseeding affected the forage nitrogen and carbohydrate fraction contents positively. The high solubility of both carbohydrate and protein from millet + <b>bristle</b> <b>oat</b> and <b>bristle</b> <b>oat</b> + sorghum-sudangrass mixtures indicates the quality of these forages and their potential use as an important supplement in forage systems based on tropical pastures...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effects of different grazing intensities on forage production and animal performance of yearling steers kept under permanent grazing in an integrated crop-livestock system. The treatments consisted of areas with sward heights of 10; 20; 30 and 40 cm, and one treatment with no grazing. The pastures were of <b>bristle</b> <b>oat</b> (Avena strigosa Schreb.) and annual ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) following soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.). The variables forage mass, forage allowance and residual straw showed a positive and linear fit to the increasing sward height (P≤ 0. 0001). Average daily gain of steers displayed a quadratic response (P = 0. 0017), being optimal with increases in grazing height up to values of near 30 cm, showing a weight gain per animal of approximately 1. 0 kg day- 1. A similar response was seen for live weight at slaughter and carcass characteristics (P≤ 0. 0305). The results suggest that sward heights close to 30 cm provide greater individual gains, due to the increase in forage available to each animal and the better quality of the consumed forage without compromising the residual straw destined for the following crop...|$|E
40|$|A {{population}} of a root-knot nematode species was isolated from Zoysia japonica in a turf nursery in Israel. Measurements and morphology of the second-stage juveniles and adult females, including perineal pattern, indicated this nematode to be Meloidogyne marylandi. In addition, esterase (Est) and malate dehydrogenase (Mdh) isozymes were studied {{for the first}} time for this species which is shown to be characterised by VS 1 Est band and a N 1 c Mdh pattern. Host range tests showed that the turf grasses Stenotaphrum secundatum, Dactyloctenium australe and Paspalum vaginatum, corn (Zea mays) and oat (Avena sativa) were non-hosts or resistant. Kikuyu grass (Pennisetum clandestinum), wheat (Triticum aestivum), barley (Hordeum vulgare), <b>bristle</b> <b>oat</b> (Avena strigosa), Siberian millet (Echinochloa frumentaceae) and pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum) were susceptible to the nematode. The second-stage juveniles of M. marylandi penetrated the elongation zone of wheat roots but did not reach the meristematic zone and settled with their anterior end toward the root tip. This contrasted with M. javanica or M. incognita which migrated to the meristematic zone, and turned around with their anterior toward the root base. Meloidogyne marylandi juveniles induced giant cells from vascular parenchyma cells and caused no or only small galls on the roots...|$|E
40|$|Relative tuber {{infestation}} {{and quality}} of two Meloidogyne chitwoodi resistant potato genotypes, AR 04 - 4096 and 2011 M 1, were compared in glasshouse experiments at initial population density (Pi) = 16 second-stage juveniles (g dry soil) − 1 in the presence and absence of the <b>bristle</b> <b>oat,</b> Avena strigosa. When A. strigosa was added, Pfroot+soil (Pf= final population) on both AR 04 - 4096 and 2011 M 1 increased 130 ×, Pftuber increased 1. 9 and 3. 7 ×, respectively, while Pftuber × fresh root weight (FRW) − 1 was the same. Nematode hatch from peel of AR 04 - 4096, without A. strigosa, was delayed by 3 weeks but relative hatching rate was increased. Although the RStuber (RS = Relative Susceptibility) of both AR 04 - 4096 and 2011 M 1 were lower than 1 %, {{in the presence of}} A. strigosa tuber quality of 2011 M 1 dropped below the marketable level, while that of AR 04 - 4096 was hardly affected. We conclude that: i) Pftuber is influenced by root mass; ii) root quality influences nematode hatch; iii) tuber quality is not an estimator for tuber resistance, and the reverse; iv) root resistance is equal to tuber resistance. <br/...|$|E
40|$|Cover crops {{have many}} {{benefits}} such as reducing chemical materials, improving soil condition, preventing soil erosion and conservation of soil water. The long-term objective {{of this study is}} to assess and estimate cover crop effectiveness such as green manure, weed depression and soil conservation. In this paper, spatial distribution of herb species and herbage mass was estimated. A ground based hyperspectral imaging, which is useful for acquiring field information, was employed to monitor the cover crop field (<b>bristle</b> <b>oat</b> and hairy vetch). In order to generate the maps of herbage mass, first, plant portions were extracted from hyperspectral images by NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) threshold. Next, they were classified into plant species using linear discriminant models. Finally, the herbage mass of each plant species was estimated individually using partial least squares regression model, and mapped with gradient colors depending on the estimated value. The results show that the success rate of plant area extraction was 100 % and the success rate of the plant species classification was 78. 7 %. With regards to the result of the herbage mass estimation, the model that used both plant pixel spectra and plant cover rate as explanatory variables had the highest and most stable accuracy than the other models. The maps of plant species and herbage mass reflected the actual spatial distribution on the field. It was demonstrated that the hyperspectral imaging system developed in this study is a useful technique for monitoring the cover crop...|$|E
40|$|In a turfgrass nursery in Arava, Israel, a {{population}} of root-knot nematodes was isolated from poorly growing Zoysiagrass (Zoysia japonica Steud.) with symptoms of foliar chlorosis and roots with very small, smooth galls and protruding egg masses. The isolated population (genus Meloidogyne) included females and second-stage juveniles, whereas no males were observed. Measurements and morphological observations of 20 second-stage juveniles (body length = 423 ± 13 ?m, dorsal gland orifice from stylet base = 2. 6 ± 0. 4 ?m, tail length = 63 ± 3 ?m, hyaline tail length = 12. 4 ± 0. 9 ?m and hemizonid posterior to excretory pore) and 10 adult females (stylet length = 12. 5 ± 0. 7 ?m, dorsal gland orifice from stylet base = 3. 3 ± 0. 5 ?m, excretory pore to head end = 11. 9 ± 1. 3 ?m and perineal patterns rounded to ovoid with coarse striae) conformed to the description of Meloidogyne marylandi Jepson and Golden (3). Additionally, the identification was confirmed when females and second-stage juveniles were compared with available paratype slides. The isozymes malate dehydrogenase (EC 1. 1. 1. 37) and esterase (EC 3. 1. 1. 1) of young, adult females were also {{different from those of}} other described root-knot nematode species, including M. graminis, a taxon closely related to M. marylandi (4). M. marylandi was discovered and described from Bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers) in Maryland in 1987. Outside the United States, it has only been isolated from Zoysia matrella in Japan (1, 2, 3). In host range tests with different turfgrasses, stolons with roots were inoculated after 1 week with 500 second-stage juveniles per plant and 6 weeks later, the produced egg-masses where counted. These tests showed that this root-knot nematode isolate reproduced on Z. japonica and Pennisetum clandestinum, while no egg masses were observed on the roots of Dactyloctenium australe, Paspalum vaginatum, and Stenotaphrum secundatum. Additionally, some cereals grown from seeds were tested. Wheat (Triticum aestivum), barley (Hordeum vulgare), and <b>bristle</b> <b>oat</b> (Avena strigosa) were infested with this nematode, while oat (A. sativa) was not. Although the origin of this root-knot nematode in Israel is unknown, it could have been distributed throughout the country with commercial turfgrass. To our knowledge, this is the first report of M. marylandi in Israel and outside the United States and Japan...|$|E
