[...] Author Chris Nickson felt the single's importance was [...] "well beyond its chart placing" [...] and that the single {{was one of the most}} important songs in Carey's career, enabling her to transition into R and hip-hop. Nickson commented that before, Carey was seen as a pop singer with R tendencies, but [...] "Honey" [...] changed that idea, giving the singer [...] "hip-hop credibility", and forced naysayers to [...] "take another look." [...] Rich Juzwiak from Slant complimented the song, calling it [...] "awakening, both sensually and musically." [...] Juzwiak concluded the review writing [...] "Honey exemplifies the abrupt gear shifting that appreciating Mariah the artist requires. Its new pop brilliance doesn't always come easy, where detecting it depends on the audience's newfound ability to apply Carey's pop life to her pop music." [...] "Honey" [...] was nominated for two Grammy Awards at the 1998 ceremony, for Best Female R Vocal Performance and Best R Song.

30|$|In this section, {{we study}} the {{performance}} of LSGO by running a computer simulation with network simulator ns- 2 (version 2.34) [33]. GPSR is the most fundamental and classic geographic routing protocol, and it first proposes the greedy forwarding strategy, {{which is the most}} widely used strategy in VANETs. In addition, GPSR is the basis for most of the geographic routing protocols and often used as the comparison protocol. But its recovery mode has a problem called <b>Baby</b> <b>Step</b> Problem. To solve this problem, GPCR is proposed. Packets are always greedily forwarded along the road from one junction to the other, which solves the <b>Baby</b> <b>Step</b> Problem in GPSR. However, even if a packet is forwarded along the street, it needs to stop at each junction node. GpsrJ[*]+[*][8] removes the unnecessary stop at a junction while keeping the efficient planarity of topological maps, improving GPCR to better adapt to the VANETs in a city scenario. It manages to increase the packet delivery ratio of GPCR and reduces the number of hops in the recovery mode compared to GPSR. So, we choose GpsrJ[*]+[*]as one of the contrast protocols. The greedy traffic aware routing protocol (GyTAR) [11] improves the greedy strategy that tries to mimic the shortest path routing by taking into account the road connectivity. A score is given to each neighboring junction considering the traffic density and their distance to the destination. It is good at finding robust routing in a city environment. Since the scenario in our simulation is also an urban scenario, we take GyTAR as another comparison protocol.|$|R

Tendo a desigualdade de Hasse-Weil como motivação, encontramos identidades finitas para h que são também explícitas no sentido de que seus custos computacionais são diretamente deduzíveis dessas identidades. Como consequência, obtivemos também identidades finitas e explícitas para os coeficientes ai do L-polinômio da função zeta.
