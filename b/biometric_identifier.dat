In particular, the biometric procedures of fingerprint and facial recognition can profit from the government project.In May 2005 the German Upper House of Parliament approved the implementation of the ePass, a passport issued to all German citizens which contain biometric technology.

[...] "A third <b>biometric</b> <b>identifier</b> - iris scans - could be added at a later stage".An increase in the prevalence of biometric technology in Germany is an effort to not only keep citizens safe within German borders but also to comply with the current US deadline for visa-waiver countries to introduce biometric passports. In addition to producing biometric passports for German citizens, the German government has put in place new requirements for visitors to apply for visas within the country. [...] "Only applicants for long-term visas, which allow more than three months' residence, will be affected by the planned biometric registration program.

Some {{of the well}} known <b>biometric</b> <b>identifiers</b> are voice, finger prints, retina or iris, facial structure etc. In our daily interaction with others directly or indirectly, we implicitly use biometrics to know, distinguish and trust people. <b>Biometric</b> <b>identifiers</b> represent the concept of "who a person is" by gathering vital characteristics that don't correspond to any other person.

The <b>biometric</b> <b>identifier</b> generation algorithms employ image hashing functions using singular value decomposition and support vector classification techniques. Our algorithms capture generic biometric features that ensure unique and repeatable biometric identifiers. We provide an empirical evaluation of our techniques using 2569 images of 488 different individuals for three types of biometric images; namely fingerprint, iris and face.

We provide an example use of the biometric identifiers in privacy preserving multi-factor identity verification based on zero knowledge proofs. Therefore several identity verification factors, including various traditional identity attributes, can be used in conjunction with one or more biometrics of the individual to provide strong identity verification. We also ensure security and privacy of the biometric data. More specifically, we analyze several attack scenarios.
