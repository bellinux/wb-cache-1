25|$|The <b>basic</b> <b>instrument</b> of Cuman {{political}} {{success was}} military force, which dominated {{each of the}} warring Balkan factions. Groups of the Cumans settled and mingled with the local population in regions of the Balkans, and Cuman settlers founded three successive Bulgarian dynasties (Asenids, Terterids, and Shishmanids) and the Wallachian dynasty (Basarabids); however, {{in the cases of}} the Basarab and Asenid dynasties, medieval documents refer to them as Vlach dynasties.|$|E
25|$|The plow {{is a tool}} used {{in farming}} for initial {{cultivation}} of soil in preparation for sowing seed or planting. It has been a <b>basic</b> <b>instrument</b> for most of recorded history, and {{represents one of the}} major advances in agriculture. In modern use, a plowed field is typically left to dry out, and is harrowed before planting. An American agricultural pioneer named John Deere modernized the plow by shaping steel from an old sawmill blade and joining it to a wrought iron moldboard. Deere polished both parts smooth so the damp soil would no longer stick. After patenting the device in 1837, it became an instant success and a necessity on American farms.|$|E

25|$|The Organization's {{official}} {{languages are}} Spanish, English, Portuguese, and French. The Charter, the <b>basic</b> <b>instrument</b> governing OAS, makes {{no reference to}} the use of official languages. These references {{are to be found in}} the Rules of Procedure governing the various OAS bodies. Article 51 of the Rules of Procedure of the General Assembly, the supreme body of the OAS, which meets once a year, states that English, French, Portuguese and Spanish are the four official languages. Article 28 stipulates that a Style Committee shall be set up with representatives of the four official languages to review the General Assembly resolutions and declarations. Article 53 states that proposals shall be presented in the four official languages. The Rules of Procedure and Statutes of other bodies, such as the Inter-American Council for Integral Development (CIDI), the Permanent Executive Committee of the Inter-American Council for Integral Development (CEPCIDI), the Inter-American Commission of Women (CIM), the Inter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission (CICAD), the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) and the Inter-American Juridical Committee (CJI), technical bodies of the OAS, also mention the four official languages in which their meetings are to be conducted. Policy is therefore dictated through these instruments that require use of the four official languages at meetings.|$|E
500|$|The {{integrated}} {{control panel}} (ICP) is a keypad system for entering communications, navigation, and autopilot data. Two [...] up-front displays located around the ICP {{are used to}} display integrated caution advisory/warning data, communications, navigation and identification (CNI) data and also serve as the stand-by flight instrumentation group and fuel quantity indicator. The stand-by flight group displays an artificial horizon, for <b>basic</b> <b>instrument</b> meteorological conditions. The [...] primary multi-function display (PMFD) is located under the ICP, and is used for navigation and situation assessment. Three [...] secondary multi-function displays are located around the PMFD for tactical information and stores management.|$|E
500|$|During May, {{the earlier}} {{proclamation}} of the German High Command {{was followed by}} orders issued by Förster, requiring the registration of printing presses and restrictions on the press within the occupied territory. Orders were also issued regarding the operation of theatres and other places of entertainment, and imposing German criminal law in the occupied territory. Förster also ordered the resumption of production, disestablished the National Bank of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, and established the Serbian National Bank to replace it. From the outset, the Aćimović government lacked any semblance of power. It was effectively a low-grade and <b>basic</b> <b>instrument</b> of the German military occupation regime, which performed administrative duties within the occupied territory {{on behalf of the}} Germans. The three main tasks of the Aćimović administration were to secure the acquiescence of the population to the German occupation, help restore services, and [...] "identify and remove undesirables from public services". It was capable of handling routine administrative tasks and maintaining law and order in a peacetime situation only, and was controlled by Turner and Neuhausen. Neuhausen was effectively an economic dictator, and had complete control over the economy of the occupied territory and finances of the Commissioner Government, to one end – maximising the contribution they made to the German war effort.|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to the <b>basic</b> <b>instrument,</b> most oscilloscopes are supplied with a probe as shown. The probe will connect to any input on the instrument and typically has a resistor of ten times the oscilloscope's input impedance. This results in a [...]1(‑10X) attenuation factor, but helps to isolate the capacitive load presented by the probe cable from the signal being measured. Some probes have a switch allowing the operator to bypass the resistor when appropriate.|$|E
