The hybridization of these species adds further support in the bongo and sitatunga being each other's closet relatives. Other hybrids have been documented, such as a male common eland x greater kudu resulting from an accidental crossing from the San Diego Zoo Safari Park in the 1970s. Notable mixed inherited traits were pointed ears as the eland's, but a bit widened like kudu's. The tail was half the length of that of an eland, with a terminal tuft of hair as in kudu. The individual was, however, azoospermic as analysis showed that it completely lacked germ cells, which produce gametes.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Inherited defects of {{thyroglobulin}} synthesis {{resulting in}} congenital goiter are well described in certain breeds of domestic ungulates and in human beings. Goiter associated with synthesis of an abnormal thyroglobulin {{and the presence}} of thyroidal albumin was identified in five closely related <b>bongo</b> <b>antelopes</b> (Tragelaphus eurycerus). The goiter had an adult onset, and the affected bongos appeared to remain euthyroid with normal serum T 3 and T 4 values, normal serum cholesterol concentrations, and nonelevated concentrations of circulating thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Goitrous bongos had significant reproductive difficulties, including reduced cyclic activity and prolonged gestations, but were otherwise normal. Over the course of the disease, the thyroid glands greatly enlarged (up to 10 x 20 cm) and became polycystic. Microscopically, there was an admixture of giant colloid-filled follicles and follicles of normal size lined with variable follicular epithelium ranging from squamoid to mildly to moderately hyperplastic. The pathogenesis of goiter in the bongo may reflect a mixture ofgenetic predisposition coupled with environmental factors, including a period ofexposure to a goitrogen.

Animals such as the eland as well as spotted and melanistic serval cats can be found higher up in the moorlands. The Aberdare National Park also contains a large eastern black rhinoceros population. Visitors can also indulge in walking, picnics, in the rivers and camping in the moorlands. Even the bird viewing is rewarding, with over 250 species of birds in the park, including the endangered Aberdare cisticola, Jackson's francolin, sparry hawk, goshawks, eagles, sunbirds and plovers.

40|$|The {{mountain}} <b>bongo</b> <b>antelope</b> Tragelaphus eurycerus isaaci has rapidly {{declined in}} recent decades, {{due to a}} combination of hunting, habitat degradation and disease. Endemic to Kenya, mountain bongo populations have shrunk to approximately 100 individuals now mainly confined to the Aberdares mountain ranges. Indirect observation of bongo signs (e. g. tracks, dung) can be misleading, thus methods to ensure reliable species identification, such as DNA-based techniques, are necessary to effectively study and monitor this species. We assessed bongo presence in four mountain habitats in Kenya (Mount Kenya National Park, Aberdare National Park, Eburu and Mau forests) and carried out a preliminary analysis of genetic variation by examining 466 bp of the first domain of the mtDNA control region using DNA extracted from faecal samples. Of the 201 dung samples collected in the field, 102 samples were molecularly identified as bongo, 97 as waterbuck, one as African buffalo and one as Aders’ duiker. Overall species-identification accuracy by experienced trackers was 64 %, with very high error of commission when identifying bongo sign (37 %), and high error of omission for waterbuck sign (82 %), suggesting that the two species’ signs are easily confused. Despite high variation in the mtDNA control region in most antelope species, our results suggest low genetic variation in mountain bongo as only two haplotypes were detected in 102 samples analyzed. In contrast, the analysis of 63 waterbuck samples from the same sites revealed 21 haplotypes. Nevertheless, further examination using nuclear DNA markers (e. g. microsatellites) in a multi-locus approach is still required, especially because the use of mitochondrial DNA can result in population overestimation as distinct dung samples can potentially be originated from the same individual...|$|E
40|$|The {{integrity}} of the Tg structure as a protein is essential for adequate synthesis of thyroid hormone. Also a large supply of iodine and of thyroid hormone is stored into the Tg molecule and available for secretion on demand. Mutations in Tg gene or hyposialylated Tg due to a defective sialyltransferase activity would cause a structurally defective protein and severely impair the functional ability of Tg. In this review we attempt to cover the abnormalities in the synthesis of Tg described in both animals and man. Hereditary congenital goiter with or without hypothyroidism is the phenotypic major clinical finding in these species. Affected animals include sheep, bovine cattle, <b>bongo</b> <b>antelope,</b> goats, and mice. As in man the inheritance mode is autosomal recessive. In most animal studies structurally abnormal Tg is present. The molecular basis for the defective Tg synthesis was attributable to nonsense mutation in exon 9 (Afrikander cattle) and in exon 8 (Dutch goats). In man the Tg defective synthesis {{has been reported in}} 89 subjects and frequently more than one sibling is affected in a given generation. Characteristically these patients exhibit hereditary congenital goiter with relatively low Tg levels that do not increase after stimulation with bovine TSH. High PBI concentrations with low serum T 4 values indicate the serum presence of iodinated proteins (mainly iodoalbumin). Also iodinated peptides are frequently excreted into the urine. Tissue studies confirm that there is an absent Tg peak at gel filtration, and virtually no immunoassayable Tg is present in the tissue extracts. The molecular basis of these defects have been recently reported in a patient and includes low tissue Tg mRNA probably due to premature degradation of a defective Tg mRNA. The responsible mutation is a cytosine to thymine transition creating a stop codon at position 1510. The point mutation is removed by the preferential accumulation of a 171 nt deleted Tg mRNA. In another subject molecular studies revealed that exon 4 was missing from the major Tg transcript due to a cytosine to guanine transversion at position minus 3 in the acceptor splice site of intron 3. It is anticipated that other mutations responsible for these defects will be identifiable in the near future. Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U. S.
