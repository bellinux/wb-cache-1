The results {{are meant to be}} included in a modified balance sheet. An innovative "genuine income" for farms has been developed and used to analyse the panel test results. Problem and objectives The need and the great scope of introducing environmental accounting at both macro and micro levels has finally acquired a widely agreed meaning in terms of necessary and indispensable instrument to effectively take account of the valuable role of the natural capital and its flow of economic functions-resource supply, waste assimilation and aesthetic commodity- in the economic process. The micro-economic contribution is particularly felt as the starting point since it is at the farm level that the interaction with the environment occurs. The farm level is the dimension where the production process takes place according to economic appraisal, generating positive and negative impacts on the environment. Along with positive and negative externalities, environmental impacts can also directly affect the rentability of the farm causing them, thus showing how environmentally targeted investments and agricultural activities may represent a suitable way of action. By the same token if monetary values of environmental impacts were to be calculated and inserted in the farm balance a clearer view of a more complete assessment would allow a wider spectrum of innovative economic considerations.

40|$|The {{evolution}} {{and growth of}} e-commerce has had a major impact in the daily living {{for the past few}} years [28]. It has brought and introduced new ways of trading and doing business. It enabled customers to negotiate business deals with companies and come into agreement about the services and goods to be purchased; and even come to the finalization and conclusion of the deals without ever being in the same place or meeting during all those negotiations. The e-commerce systems target the desktop or personal computers (PC s) as the hardware platform for clients. With all such good features and benefits e-commerce has, there is, to mention the least, one limitation that it has and that is mobility. People would still want to engage themselves in business deals whilst mobile. Mobile commerce or m-commerce appears into the scene to complete the journey started by e-commerce, thus it is seen as an extension of e-commerce [21]. Many services have migrated from the traditional e-commerce to m-commerce and that has allowed customers and clients to have access to their services whilst mobile or in motion. The lack of mobility in students services is being seen as a hassle and a problem by some students as they are forced to be fixed in one point at a time in order to get their services. The dissertation aims at addressing the service-related problems students encounter due to the lack of mobility in the University campus.
