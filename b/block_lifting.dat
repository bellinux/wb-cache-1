40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel lifting factorization of discrete cosine transform type-II and IV (DCT-II and IV). Although some conven-tional integer DCT-IIs (IntDCT-IIs) with block size 8 have been proposed, {{they are not}} generalized as arbitrary block size M. Us-ing <b>block</b> <b>lifting</b> factorization which has an efficient structure for lossless-to-lossy image coding, we present IntDCT-IIs and IVs with arbitrary block size M that is called block lifting-based DCT-IIs and IVs (BLDCT-IIs and IVs). Finally, the validity of our method is proved by showing the results of lossless-to-lossy image coding in the most general case of the block size 8 and the extended size 16.

50|$|A <b>block</b> <b>lift</b> (often {{referred}} to as a budget lift) is a modification that is similar to a body lift in the way it works, but used in a different location. <b>Block</b> <b>lifts</b> are used to provide more room between the body and axle of a vehicle for larger tires. A <b>block</b> <b>lift</b> consists of either extended spring isolators or blocks that are inserted between a vehicles axle and spring, or a spring and the vehicles body. This type of lift is often preferred due to the affordability and ease of installation.|$|R

40|$|As {{part of the}} {{excavations}} at Star Carr in {{the summer}} of 2007, a 'block' sample of peat from the archaeologically rich lake-edge deposits was removed for micro-excavation in the laboratory. The main aim was to compare on-site excavation and excavation in the laboratory. The techniques employed for the block were intended to maximise the chances of recovering fragile organic remains and provide an understanding of the spatial relationships between them. In addition, the time and resources required to excavate the block were evaluated in order to assess the merits of undertaking <b>block</b> <b>lifting</b> and excavation, with a view to informing future work. ...|$|E
40|$|Shipyards are {{increasing}} production efficiency. The main {{means to achieve}} higher efficiency are {{reducing the number of}} structural parts and increasing manufacturing automation. Potential target for the improvements would be design of transversal T-beams webs. This thesis presents strength assessment method for evaluation transversal T-beam webs in cruise ships. The method is based on nonlinear finite element method and shell element mesh for ultimate strength and linear analysis and Timoshenko beam elements for the load assessment. Generic loading is applied to T-beams as a load vectors in nonlinear analysis to evaluate capacity using buckling, yielding and ultimate limit state criteria. The obtained strength of T-beams is compared against realistic loading calculated with linear analysis. The main realistic loadings were presented: global still water and wave loads, local deck pressure and <b>block</b> <b>lifting.</b> The method is applied to a two case studies. Case study one compares the effect of the tripping brackets. It is discovered that strength is not increased significantly in case of 0, 1 and 2 tripping brackets. However, the presence of the tripping brackets significantly increase post buckling capacity of the T-beams. Case study two shows an approximate range of production induced damage. Induced damage is caused by different bending sequences from transportation, welding, blocks balancing, <b>block</b> <b>lifting</b> etc. which lead to plastic deformations of T-beams. The magnitude of production induced damage is found to be significantly higher than combined contribution from operational loads...|$|E

50|$|Some {{methods of}} lifting {{are good for}} the rear, {{but not for the}} front, such as <b>lifting</b> <b>blocks.</b> <b>Lifting</b> the rear with blocks is a common way to achieve the desired height. This is done by {{installing}} a block, of the desired height of lift, in between the leaf spring and leaf spring perch and installing longer U-bolts. It is a bad method for the front primarily because of safety issues while braking. When braking, the front wheels create the majority of the braking force. The block moves this lateral force, caused by braking, higher above the axle than it did in the stock form. This can cause the block to become displaced from its location and result in total loss of control.
