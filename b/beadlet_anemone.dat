40|$|Pairwise {{contests}} {{occur when}} two individuals compete directly over ownership of an indivisible resource. Contests vary {{in the degree}} of escalation, some encounters being settled through non-injurious behaviour while others are only resolved after dangerous fighting. Here, we investigate the role of relatedness, assessed using AFLP analysis, on the occurrence of stinging during staged contests in the <b>beadlet</b> sea <b>anemone</b> Actinia equina. Contrary to our expectations, we found that the chance of stinging, and hence the chance of inflicting damage, increased with the degree of relatedness between the two opponents. This result may be explained by the negative relationship between asymmetry in fighting ability and escalation level predicted by theory. We suggest that in order to fully understand how relatedness influences aggression, predictions from kin selection theory should be incorporated with those from contest theory...|$|R
40|$|Actinia equina, the <b>beadlet</b> sea <b>anemone,</b> {{is a very}} labile species, {{displaying}} variable colour patterns, broad habitat {{choice and}} diverse modes of reproduction. Historically, studies using genetic markers such as allozymes and differences in habitat choice lead several authors to propose that different colour morphs could represent different species. One of the species defined was A. fragacea. In this paper, the relationships between brown, red and green colour morphs of A. equina and A. fragacea were studied, using two DNA fragments (one mitochondrial and one nuclear). Individuals were sampled from three different areas in Portugal separated by a maximum distance of 500 km. This is the first study applying direct sequencing of selected gene fragments to approach the validity of Actinia morphs as different genetic entities. The results show that, {{at least in the}} Portuguese coast, these colour morphs do not correspond to the two valid species recognized in the literature. The existence of cryptic species is discussed. Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia (FCT), Eco-Ethology Research Unit, Parcialmente financiado pela FEDER...|$|R

40|$|Contest behavior, where {{individuals}} compete directly {{against one}} another for access to limited resources, is widespread across animal taxa. In many cases, contests are settled though the use of noninjurious behavior such as agonistic signals and even fights that involve weapons are often resolved through processes of assessment and strategic decision making. Here, we determine the role of these "decision rules" during staged contests in a simple animal, the <b>beadlet</b> sea <b>anemone</b> Actinia equina using a recently suggested approach of analyzing 1) traits linked to resource holding potential (RHP), 2) relationships between RHP and contest duration, and 3) contest dynamics. Depending on the activities used in the encounter, RHP, is linked to overall body size, the size of stinging nematocyst weapons, or by the ability to land blows on the opponent. Furthermore, changes in the intensity of aggression as the contest progresses indicate the use of 2 distinct types of self-assessment-based decision rules, which differ according to whether weapons {{are used in the}} contest. Therefore, these fights in animals that lack a centralized nervous system appear to involve the use of logical decision rules similar to those observed in contests in animals that are often assumed to be more "complex" in their behavior. Indeed, anemones appear to use different sources of information about incurred costs, depending on the intensity of the contest. Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press. ...|$|R

5000|$|The {{strawberry}} anemone has {{a smooth}} column which is typically red or dark red, with many greenish spots. The tentacles are usually red or purplish. Actinia fragacea {{is similar in}} form to the <b>beadlet</b> <b>anemone</b> (Actinia equina) and was at one time {{considered to be a}} variant of that species, however, it is typically larger, measuring up to 100 mm across the base. It also has a conspicuous ring of pale blue, red, pink or white spots known as [...] "acrorhagi" [...] around the inside of the top of the column.|$|E
5000|$|When {{underwater}} this {{sea anemone}} opens up to display numerous tentacles, arranged in three whorls. Out of water, the tentacles retract and the anemone closes {{to resemble a}} dome shaped red, crimson, brown, green or black blob of jelly, about 4 cm across and 2.7 cm high. This species was first described in 1898 by H Farquhar who wrote [...] "Full-grown individuals in situations well exposed to the {{rays of the sun}} have a column greenish or brownish black, and the disc and tentacles dusky crimson, while those on the undersides of overhanging stones are reddish brown or crimson, the depth of colour varying according to the amount of light which reaches them." [...] Actinia tenebrosa is similar in form to the <b>beadlet</b> <b>anemone</b> (Actinia equina) of the northern hemisphere. The column has a number of iridescent blue spherules armed with nematocysts.|$|E
40|$|Proteins of the GFP (green {{fluorescent}} protein) family {{demonstrate a}} great spectral and phylogenetic diversity. However, {{there is still}} an intense demand for red-shifted GFP-like proteins in both basic and applied science. To obtain GFP-like chromoproteins with red-shifted absorption, we performed a broad search in blue-coloured Anthozoa species. We revealed specimens of Actinia equina (<b>beadlet</b> <b>anemone)</b> exhibiting a bright blue circle band {{at the edge of}} the basal disc. A novel blue chromoprotein, aeCP 597, with an absorption maximum at 597  nm determining the coloration of the anemone basal disk was cloned. AeCP 597 carries a chromophore chemically identical with that of the well-studied DsRed (red fluorescent protein from Discosoma sp.). Thus a strong 42 -nm bathochromic shift of aeCP 597 absorption compared with DsRed is determined by peculiarities of chromophore environment. Site-directed and random mutagenesis of aeCP 597 resulted in far-red fluorescent mutants with emission maxima at up to 663  nm. The most bright and stable mutant AQ 143 possessed excitation and emission maxima at 595 and 655  nm respectively. Thus aeCP 597 and its fluorescent mutants set a new record of red-shifted absorption and emission maxima among GFP-like proteins...|$|E
40|$|The {{identification}} of the hydrolysis and photodegradation products of flexible polyurethane foams (PUFs) with addition of biooriginated and biodegradable additive was the first topic of this dissertation work. Separation of polyurethane foam hydrolysis degradation products, designed for ecotoxicological tests, was managed by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (HPLC/MS). The degradations product structure was elucidated by tandem mass spectrometry (MSn). PUF photodegradation products were obtained by exposure of materials by irradiation at 254 nm. Semi-volatile degradation products were isolated from the exposed polyurethane by n-hexane extraction; volatile compounds were collected by solid phase microextraction (SPME). Gas chromatography with mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and complete orthogonal tandem gas chromatography with mass spectrometry (GCxGC/TOF MS) was used for separation and {{identification of}} photodegradation products. The influence of the bio-filler {{on the character of}} degradation products and the possible effect of PUF degradation products on the environment was discussed {{at the end of this}} section. The determination of isoprostanes – markers of oxidative stress in tissues of <b>beadlet</b> <b>anemone</b> (Actinia equina) was the subject of the second topic. F 2 -isoprostanes were synthesized from the arachidonic acid. With thereby prepared isoprostanes the method of determination by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC/MS/MS) was developed and optimized. The isoprostane isolation process from the Actinia equina tissues was optimized with solid phase extraction (SPE). The resulting methodology was used to quantify isoprostanes in tissues of anemones, which were exposed to both moderate and high temperature changes. The temperature changes were used to initiate the oxidative stress in organisms. In addition, concentration levels of unknown compounds were also monitored. These unknown compounds were extracted from tissues together with F 2 -isoprostanes and their identity is discussed in this dissertation work too. The possibility of using isoprostane levels in the Anthozoa tissues for the oxidative stress monitoring is discussed in the conclusion of this work...|$|E
