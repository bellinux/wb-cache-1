5|$|The Australian Army {{has used}} tanks from after the First World War, through the interwar period, the Second World War, the Cold War {{and to the}} present day. Throughout this period the Army has {{primarily}} been a light infantry force, with its tanks mainly <b>being</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> direct support role. The Australian Army's tanks have seen combat during the Second World War and the Vietnam War, where they proved successful despite some of the designs employed being considered obsolete. The first Australian tanks were {{a small number of}} British medium and light tanks which were operated mainly for training purposes during the 1920s and 1930s.|$|E
5|$|The {{builders}} {{would have}} made extensive use of cranes and block and tackle pulleys to lift the stones into place. Much of the work {{could have been done}} using simple sheers operated by a windlass. For the largest blocks, a massive human-powered treadmill would have been used; such machines were still <b>being</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> quarries of Provence until as late as the start of the 20th century. A complex scaffold was erected to support the bridge as it was being built. Large blocks were left protruding from the bridge to support the frames and scaffolds used during construction. The aqueduct as a whole would have been a very expensive undertaking; Émile Espérandieu estimated the cost to be over 30 million sesterces, equivalent to 50 years' pay for 500 new recruits in a Roman legion.|$|E
5|$|The cake can be {{prepared}} with clementines and/or clementine zest mixed in the batter, with them atop the cake, such as in slices, and in both ways. The seeds and membrane of the clementine can be removed {{as part of the}} preparation process, or seedless clementines can be used. Whole, sliced clementines including the peel, or peeled clementines can be used, and the clementines can be cooked before <b>being</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cake batter. The fruit can be chopped or blended using a food processor. Candied clementines can be used atop the cake or as a garnish. The almonds used can be toasted or blanched.|$|E

5|$|The station's {{boiler house}} housed three {{coal-fired}} Lancashire boilers, each of 200 HP capacity and each with individual economisers. These boilers provided steam for two 410 kilowatt (kW) and one 150kW direct current Parsons turbo generators. This gave the station a total generating capacity of 970kW. Before <b>being</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Lemington power station, these generators {{had been used}} in Forth Banks Power Station and in Newburn Steelworks. One of the steam turbines from these sets is now on display at the Electric Power and Historical Museum in Yokohama, Japan, after sitting on display in the entrance to Blyth Power Station for many years.|$|E
5|$|During the 1970s, {{improvements}} in natural resource management techniques emerged, along with increased concerns about otter population declines in North America. Consequently, many wildlife management agencies developed strategies to restore or enhance otter populations, {{including the use}} of reintroduction projects. Since 1976, over 4,000 otters have been reintroduced in 21 U.S. states. All Canadian provinces except Prince Edward Island and 29 U.S. states have viable populations that sustain annual harvests. Annual harvest numbers of northern river otters are similar for Canada and the United States, with most pelts <b>being</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> garment industry. In the late 1970s, annual harvest in North America reached approximately 50,000 pelts, for a value of US$3 million. Otters are inadvertently harvested by traps set for beavers, and therefore management plans should consider both species simultaneously. While current harvest strategies do not pose a threat to maintaining otter populations, harvest may limit expansion of otter populations in some areas. Otter harvests correlate positively with the beaver harvests and with the average beaver pelt price from the preceding year. Fur of the river otter is thick and lustrous and is the most durable of Native American furs. River otter pelts are used as the standard for rating the quality of other pelts.|$|E
5|$|In January 1944 the Luftwaffe {{initiated}} Operation Steinbock. Cunningham filed two claims {{during the}} offensive which lasted until May 1944. On {{the night of}} the 20/21 February 1944 he claimed Junkers Ju 188 damaged at 22:09 near Staplehurst. One Ju 188 was lost and its destruction was attributed to another pilot. On {{the night of the}} 23/24 February he claimed a probable victory against another Ju 188 off Beachy Head. One Ju 188E-1 landed at Coulommiers after surviving an attack by a night fighter. Werknummer 260222, code U5+AN from 5./KG 2 returned with two crewmen injured—Unteroffizier Johann Triebel and Wihelm Spönemann. During these missions Cunningham was nearly shot down. Closing in on a Ju 188 from astern, the gunners suddenly opened fire and the Junkers took evasive manoeuvres. A single round struck the windshield nearly shattering it. Glass fragments struck Cunningham in the face which were later removed in a field hospital. Later, a captured German crew told intelligence officers a new radar was <b>being</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rear of German aircraft to detect night fighters. Bombers were now more difficult to surprise. Cunningham's last encounter with the enemy in 1944 was in pursuit of an Me 410. He had to give up when his windshield iced over near the French coast.|$|E

5|$|On 20 November 1992, a {{major fire}} {{occurred}} at Windsor Castle, lasting for 15 hours and causing widespread {{damage to the}} Upper Ward. The Private Chapel in the north-east corner of the State Apartments was being renovated {{as part of a}} long term programme of work within the castle, and it is believed that one of the spotlights <b>being</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> work set fire to a curtain by the altar during the morning. The fire spread quickly and destroyed nine of the principal state rooms, and severely damaged more than 100 others. Fire-fighters applied water to contain the blaze, whilst castle staff attempted to rescue the precious artworks from the castle. Many of the rooms closest to the fire had been emptied as part of the renovation work, and this contributed to the successful evacuation of most of the collection. The fire spread through the roof voids and efforts continued through the night to contain the blaze, at great risk to the 200 fire-fighters involved. It was not until late afternoon that the blaze began to come under control, although the fire continued during the night before being officially declared over the next morning. Along with the fire and smoke damage, one of the unintended effects of the fire-fighting was the considerable water damage to the castle; more than 1.5 million gallons of water were used to extinguish it, which in many ways caused more complex restoration problems than the fire.|$|E
5|$|Sets of 1d (one penny) to 4d silver coins {{are known}} {{from the time of}} Charles II onwards. However, as there is no record of any {{denomination}} higher than 1d (then struck for circulation in silver) <b>being</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Maundy gift before 1731, sets from before then are most likely ordinary circulation strikes. At that time, coins used for the Maundy money distribution were indistinguishable from those struck for circulation. It was not until 1752 that coins not struck for circulation were used for the Maundy distribution. At times when little silver was being struck by the Royal Mint, the coins distributed might bear a previous year's date. To evade statutory prohibitions on the striking of silver coin during the Napoleonic Wars, all Maundy pieces issued from 1800 to 1815 bear the date 1800, though most were struck later. When the date was finally changed in 1816, after the prohibition ended, the size of the coins was slightly reduced, as the Royal Mint increased the amount struck from one troy pound of sterling silver from 62 to 66 shillings of silver coin. The last year in which no Maundy coins were struck was 1821.|$|E
5|$|The Alpine Spaniel is an extinct {{breed of}} dog {{which was used}} in {{mountain}} rescues by the Augustinian Canons, who run hospices in the region around the Great St. Bernard Pass. The spaniel was a large dog notable for its thick curly coat. One {{of the most famous}} specimens of the Alpine Spaniel is Barry, however his preserved body has been modified {{on more than one occasion}} to fit with descriptions of the extinct breed from earlier time periods. Due to the conditions in the Alps, and a series of accidents, extinction was discussed as a possibility by authors during the 1830s, and at some point prior to 1847 the entire breed was reduced to a single example due to disease. Evidence held at the Natural History Museum in Bern show that two distinct breeds of dog were <b>being</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area during this time period. The breed is thought to be the predecessor to the modern St. Bernard and the Clumber Spaniel.|$|E

5|$|The thick {{shell and}} rounded shape of {{bivalves}} make them awkward for potential predators to tackle. Nevertheless, {{a number of}} different creatures include them in their diet. Many species of demersal fish feed on them including the common carp (Cyprinus carpio), which is <b>being</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> upper Mississippi River to try to control the invasive zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha). Birds such as the Eurasian oystercatcher (Haematopus ostralegus) have specially adapted beaks which can pry open their shells. The herring gull (Larus argentatus) sometimes drops heavy shells onto rocks in order to crack them open. Sea otters feed on a variety of bivalve species and have been observed to use stones balanced on their chests as anvils on which to crack open the shells. The Pacific walrus (Odobenus rosmarus divergens) {{is one of the main}} predators feeding on bivalves in Arctic waters. Shellfish have formed part of the human diet since prehistoric times, a fact evidenced by the remains of mollusc shells found in ancient middens. Examinations of these deposits in Peru has provided a means of dating long past El Niño events because of the disruption these caused to bivalve shell growth.|$|E
5|$|The traditions {{established}} in the medieval period continued later. By {{the middle of the}} 15thcentury, a crown was formally worn on six religious feasts every year: Christmas, Epiphany, Easter, Whitsun, All Saints' Day, and one or both feasts of StEdward. A crown was also displayed and worn at the annual State Opening of Parliament. Around this time, three swords– symbols of kingship since ancient times– were <b>being</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> coronation ceremony to represent the king's powers in the administration of justice: the Sword of Spiritual Justice, the Sword of Temporal Justice, and the blunt Sword of Mercy. Another emerging item of state regalia was the orb, described in Tudor inventories as a round ball with a cross of gold, which underlined the monarch's sovereignty. Orbs had been pictorial emblems of royal authority in England since the early Middle Ages but a real orb was probably not used at any English coronation until that of HenryVIII in 1509; it would be added to the coronation regalia in the 17thcentury.|$|E
5|$|The {{crest of}} IFK Göteborg has {{its origins in}} the coat of arms {{of the city of}} Gothenburg which in turn is based on several other heraldic arms. The lion on a field of silver and blue is the heraldic arms of the House of Folkung, and the lion holds the Three Crowns of Sweden, both symbols <b>being</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> coat of arms of Sweden. This arms was granted to Gothenburg by Gustavus Adolphus. The coat of arms of the city sees the lion facing the {{sinister}} (heraldic left, which is viewer's right) side which often is interpreted as a fleeing lion, the normal being a lion facing the dexter (heraldic right) side, and IFK chose to use the latter on the club crest. Finally the three letters IFK were added on top. This crest has been used since it first appeared on the kit in 1919. These main elements have not been modified since then, but during the years several different designs of the crest have been used, occasionally having the lion facing the sinister side. In the early 1980s, the club standardised the design and only minor changes—such as element colours and different hues—have been made since then, {{with the exception of the}} years 1997–1999 when IFK, with Reebok as kit sponsors, used a crest with some more distinct changes to the standard elements. Before 1919 various other symbols were used, with the four-pointed star of the IFK associations featuring on the shirts until 1910.|$|E
