5|$|In the Latin Church, Catholic men {{may serve}} as deacons or priests by {{receiving}} sacramental ordination. Men and women {{may serve as}} extraordinary ministers of Holy Communion, as readers (lectors); or as altar servers. Historically, boys and men have only <b>been</b> <b>permitted</b> to serve as altar servers; however, since the 1990s, girls and women have also <b>been</b> <b>permitted.</b>|$|E
5|$|The federal {{government}} and the states have long <b>been</b> <b>permitted</b> to limit obscenity or pornography. While the Supreme Court has generally refused to give obscenity any protection under the First Amendment, pornography is subject to little regulation. However, the definitions of obscenity and pornography have changed over time.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the army}} {{primarily}} recruits within the United Kingdom, it accepts applications from Commonwealth citizens and (occasionally) those from friendly nations who meet certain criteria. In 2016, {{it was decided}} to open all roles to women in 2018; women had not <b>been</b> <b>permitted</b> to join the Combat Arms. The British Army is an equal-opportunity employer (with some exceptions due to its medical standards), and does not discriminate based on race, religion or sexual orientation.|$|E
50|$|Clubs <b>are</b> <b>permitted</b> {{to place}} a golden star above their crest on their uniforms for every five {{national}} championships won.

Hunting <b>is</b> <b>permitted</b> during hunting season {{provided}} that regulations are followed. Deer hunting <b>is</b> <b>permitted</b> by archery only.|$|R
5|$|Sometime between 343 and 340BC, Neaira {{was brought}} to trial by Theomnestus {{on behalf of his}} {{father-in-law}} Apollodorus, accused of xenias (representing herself as a citizen when in fact she was not). If she was convicted, the maximum penalty Neaira faced was being sold into slavery and having her property sold. Neaira herself would not have <b>been</b> <b>permitted</b> to speak at her trial, though she was probably present.|$|E
5|$|The Oval {{is located}} near the Port of Belfast, and Harland and Wolff's Samson and Goliath cranes are visible from inside the stadium. It {{is viewed as a}} {{historic}} ground by football fans because of its concrete terraces and steel fencing. This limits its capacity in UEFA-sanctioned matches to the 3,000 seats in the two main stands as terracing has not <b>been</b> <b>permitted</b> in UEFA matches since 1998.|$|E
5|$|The {{election}} of the Liberal candidate in Yukon was contested by the losing Tory candidate. After a trial before the Yukon Territorial Court, that court voided the election, holding that enough ineligible people had <b>been</b> <b>permitted</b> to vote to affect the outcome, though the court noted {{that it was not}} the fault of the Liberal candidate that these irregularities had occurred. The Tory, Erik Nielsen, won the new election in December 1957.|$|E

5|$|All {{the other}} accused lived in Lancashire, {{so they were}} sent to Lancaster Assizes for trial, where the judges were once again Altham and Bromley. The {{prosecutor}} was local magistrate Roger Nowell, who had been responsible for collecting the various statements and confessions from the accused. Nine-year-old Jennet Device was a key witness for the prosecution, something {{that would not have}} <b>been</b> <b>permitted</b> in many other 17th-century criminal trials. However, King James had made a case for suspending the normal rules of evidence for witchcraft trials in his Daemonologie. As well as identifying those who had attended the Malkin Tower meeting, Jennet also gave evidence against her mother, brother, and sister.|$|E
5|$|Captive {{breeding}} {{is another}} method of stabilizing the bog turtles' numbers. The technique involves mating bog turtles indoors in controlled environments, where nutrition and mates are provided. Fred Wustholz and Richard J. Holub {{were the first}} to do this independently, during the 1960s and 1970s. They were interested in educating others about the bog turtle and in increasing its population, and over several years they released many healthy bog turtles into the wild. Various organizations, such as the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, have <b>been</b> <b>permitted</b> to breed bog turtles in captivity.|$|E
5|$|During oral argument, Justice Antonin Scalia {{responded to}} this by {{suggesting}} that some interests a person might express, such as recreational drugs, signified a willingness to violate social norms {{regardless of whether the}} conduct was illegal or not. Paul Larkin, who appeared for the government, had to admit to that there was no case law on entrapment where something that had previously <b>been</b> <b>permitted</b> was now prohibited. At one point, trying to argue that Jacobson did not have access to the defense of entrapment by estoppel (where the government persuades an actor that it is legal to do something, only to prosecute them for it), Scalia told Larkin he'd lost him.|$|E

5|$|In {{a second}} letter, also dated June 18, Dupasquier and Shorrock {{confirmed}} {{that they would}} not permit their teams to race on the Michelin tyres used during qualification without changes to the circuit, and reiterated their request to slow down Turn 13. Whiting's brief reply maintained that no such change would be permitted, and gave the teams the choice of limiting speeds through Turn 13, using tyres of a different specification to those used in qualifying, subject to a penalty, or changing tyres repeatedly, which would have <b>been</b> <b>permitted</b> if a driver's safety were at issue.|$|E
5|$|Kenyatta had {{continued}} writing articles, {{in which he}} reflected Padmore's influence. He produced an article for a January 1933 issue of the Negro Worker, and then another for a November 1933 issue of Labour Monthly. He also wrote the entry on Kenya for Negro, an anthology edited by Nancy Cunard and published in 1934. In these, he took a more extreme position than {{he had in the}} past, calling for complete self-rule in Kenya. In doing so he was virtually alone among political Kenyans, with figures like Thuku and Jesse Kariuki being far less radical in their demands. The pro-independence sentiments {{that he was able to}} express in Britain would not have <b>been</b> <b>permitted</b> in Kenya itself.|$|E
5|$|The Army was {{ultimately}} under political authority. Since the Glorious Revolution of 1688 the Crown has not <b>been</b> <b>permitted</b> a standing {{army in the}} United Kingdom – it derives its existence from the Army Act, passed by Parliament each year (every five years since the late 1950s). The House of Commons took these responsibilities seriously: a letter from Haig clarifying the position on shell-shock had to be read out in the House of Commons on 14 March 1918. Most disciplinary regulations in the First World War derived from the 1881 Army Act, although some offences were more severely dealt with on active service, e.g. in principle looting or wilful disobedience carried the death penalty.|$|E

5|$|A {{least one}} {{transportation}} {{study in the}} early 1970s identified the highway north of Novi as M-275. The Oakland County Road Commission, local land developers, and local politicians supported building a highway along the route of M-275 {{to open up the}} area for development. After the January 1977 cancelation of M-275 as a full freeway, the state explored building the highway as a parkway instead. This parkway concept allowed at-grade intersections that would have not <b>been</b> <b>permitted</b> had the highway been built as a full freeway, and included more landscaping and less grade separation. In September 1977, the State Transportation Commission ordered MDOT to study alternatives to a freeway in the area, along with the possible widening of I-94 and US23 and the improvement of local roads to handle increased traffic caused by the absence of an extended I-275 from the state's freeway network.|$|E
5|$|An {{estimated}} 600 {{grizzly bears}} {{live in the}} Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, {{with more than half}} of the population living within Yellowstone. The grizzly is currently listed as a threatened species, however the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has announced that they intend to take it off the endangered species list for the Yellowstone region but will likely keep it listed in areas where it has not yet recovered fully. Opponents of delisting the grizzly are concerned that states might once again allow hunting and that better conservation measures need to be implemented to ensure a sustainable population. Black bears are common in the park and were a park symbol due to visitor interaction with the bears starting in 1910. Feeding and close contact with bears has not <b>been</b> <b>permitted</b> since the 1960s to reduce their desire for human foods. Yellowstone is one of the few places in the United States where black bears can be seen coexisting with grizzly bears. Black bear observations occur most often in the park's northern ranges and in the Bechler area which is in the park's southwestern corner.|$|E
5|$|At the queen's villa in Algiers, Ranavalona was {{provided}} with servants and a French female attendant who kept her under observation and remained present whenever the queen entertained guests in her home. In addition, {{the government of}} France initially provided Ranavalona with an annual allowance of 25,000 francs paid from the budget for the colony of Madagascar and authorized by the colony's Governor General. Nearly all the queen's property had been seized by the colonial authority, although she had <b>been</b> <b>permitted</b> to keep certain personal belongings, including some of her jewelry. Her initial pension allowed such a humble lifestyle that the colonial government of Algeria lobbied unsuccessfully several times on her behalf to obtain an increase for her. Ranavalona also tasked a servant with selling some of her jewelry for cash, but the plan was discovered by the French colonial authorities and the servant was discharged and sent back to Madagascar.|$|E
5000|$|Regarding {{recreation}} {{in fresh}} air, Breivik said: [...] "Until December 2015 all outdoors recreation {{was in a}} concrete box. In December 2015, probably because of the upcoming trial, I <b>was</b> <b>permitted</b> to walk 20 minutes in the outdoors recreation area. A couple of times later I <b>was</b> <b>permitted</b> again. Thereafter I <b>was</b> <b>permitted</b> to recreate there every other week".|$|R

5|$|Following a final {{appearance}} at the 1948 Summer Olympics, art competitions {{were removed from the}} Olympic program. Planners of the 1952 Summer Olympics opposed their inclusion on logistical grounds, claiming that the lack of an international association for the event meant that the entire onus of facilitation was placed on the local organizing committee. Concerns were also raised about the professionalism of the event, since only amateurs were allowed to participate in the sporting tournaments, and the growing commercialization of the competitions, as artists had <b>been</b> <b>permitted</b> to sell their submissions {{during the course of the}} Games since 1928. In 1952 an art festival and exhibition was held concurrent with the Games, a tradition that has been maintained in all subsequent Summer Olympics.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to Hiroshima, {{almost all of}} the buildings were of old-fashioned Japanese construction, consisting of timber or timber-framed buildings with timber walls (with or without plaster) and tile roofs. Many of the smaller industries and business establishments were also situated in buildings of timber or other materials not designed to withstand explosions. Nagasaki had <b>been</b> <b>permitted</b> to grow for many years without conforming to any definite city zoning plan; residences were erected adjacent to factory buildings and to each other almost as closely as possible throughout the entire industrial valley. On the day of the bombing, an estimated 263,000 people were in Nagasaki, including 240,000 Japanese residents, 10,000 Korean residents, 2,500 conscripted Korean workers, 9,000 Japanese soldiers, 600 conscripted Chinese workers, and 400 Allied prisoners of war in a camp to the north of Nagasaki.|$|E
5|$|The Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral Resources is {{responsible}} for general strategy in {{the oil and gas}} sectors and for monitoring the state-owned oil company, Saudi Aramco. The oil, gas and refining industries in Saudi Arabia are controlled by law by Saudi Aramco, which has a near monopoly in these areas. It is the world's biggest oil producer, the Middle East's biggest company and is generally considered {{to be the most important}} energy company in the world. However, in 2003, the law was changed to allow foreign companies to look for Saudi Arabia's vast reserves of natural gas, believed to represent 4% of the world's reserves. This was the first time since the 1970s that foreign companies have <b>been</b> <b>permitted</b> to search for oil or gas.|$|E
