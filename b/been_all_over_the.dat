We can take heat if there's {{something}} wrong {{and people can}} review shows badly– that's {{something you have to}} live with– but to say people stormed out of the show was an absolute fabrication. Britney is aware of all this and she's extremely upset by it. She's a human being. I'm embarrassed, with such a big international entourage here with Britney, {{to be part of the}} Australian media when I see that kind of totally inaccurate reporting. It's <b>been</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> internet for nine months, the inference is that we tried to hide this. It's been the opposite. This show is about an incredible spectacle, which it is".|$|E
2500|$|Backed up by {{a simple}} beat and minimal synth arrangement, Saporta sings about finding the girl he’s been missing: [...] "Girl, I’ve <b>been</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> world looking for you / I’m known for taking what I think I deserve, and you’re overdue." [...] Sabi, {{provides}} the chorus and the [...] "la-la-la-la-la" [...] melody that carries the song as Saporta sings [...] "You make me feel that…," [...] but never quite finishes the thought. According to Monica Herrera, a writer from Rolling Stone, the song has a riff that suggests Pink's [...] "Raise Your Glass".|$|E
2500|$|Dardenne quickly {{endorsed}} Edwards for the November 21 {{runoff election}} against Vitter. Angelle remained {{silent on the}} race and refused to endorse either candidate. State Treasurer John Neely Kennedy, a 2004 Democratic opponent of Vitter, called upon Angelle {{to join him in}} endorsing Vitter. Remaining silent, said Kennedy, is the equivalent of an endorsement of Edwards. Angelle spokesman Ryan Cross responded to Kennedy's accusations saying “John Kennedy is confused. He is the eternal president of the RINO club. He endorsed John Kerry for President , who fought to kill the Keystone pipeline; he’s run statewide as a liberal Democrat twice; and he’s <b>been</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> map on issues like the minimum wage, abortion, and tax increases.” ...|$|E

2500|$|During {{the early}} years of their marriage, as {{described}} by Loretta Lynn in her autobiography Still Woman Enough:I married Doo when I wasn't but a child, and he was my life from that day on. But as important as my youth and upbringing was, there's something else that made me stick to Doo. He thought I was something special, more special {{than anyone else in the}} world, and never let me forget it. That belief would be hard to shove out the door. Doo was my security, my safety net. And just remember, I'm explainin', not excusin'. (Still Woman Enough xvii) ... Doo was a good man and a hard worker. But he was an alcoholic, and it affected our marriage all the way through. He was also a womanizer. Cheating husbands have <b>been</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> news talk shows for a few years now. Lots of women say they don't understand why women stay with them dogs. My story is about one who did—me.(Still Woman Enough, p. xiii).|$|E
2500|$|... "I'm a Rocker" [...] is a {{cover of}} the Chuck Berry track. To promote the album in Belgium, a Belgian film crew {{recorded}} the band performing the song at Portland Studios in London. The song was released as a single in Belgium in 1980, peaking at number one there. The song originally came to Holder's attention when it was played on Radio One by DJ Annie Nightingale. In a 1980 interview, Holder said: [...] "I really liked it [...] mentioned to {{the others in the}} band that I'd heard a really great Chuck Berry number". After spending time trying to get hold of a copy of the song, Holder obtained Berry's the album of the same name from an import shop. Holder revealed: [...] "After listening to it, we started to play it live on stage, first of all just as a jam {{at the end of the}} set. Then one night we went into the studio, we'd <b>been</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> pub, and we had half an hour left at the end of a session, and we decided to record it, and we got it down in one take. The feel is there in that song, it's us, Slade – it's what we are all about." ...|$|E
2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the video, Gabe gets his picture taken in the photobooth, and when he's grabbing it, a picture of Sabi appears to be stuck in the slit. Both picture's feelings read [...] "Incomplete". Then Gabe makes his goal of the night to find the girl in the picture. While this is happening, Victoria Asher is seen dragging different people into the bathroom, these people including twins and a girl, hence her feeling being [...] "kinky". Gabe goes around the club (his [...] "world" [...] girl I've <b>been</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> world looking for you) trying to find Sabi and stumbling upon different people who embrace him in hugs or handshakes. Sabi is seen dancing around the club when her part of the song comes on. Nate Novarro instead of dancing, orders a burger through Vicky-T's iPad; his feeling being [...] "munchy". During the first two thirds of the video, all drinks seem to be taken away from Ryland Blackinton, hence why on his picture he's feeling [...] "thirsty". When Gabe finally finds Sabi, they give each other a look of sheer happiness, before they both enter the photobooth. The lights go off, and at the moment they go back on, Gabe and Sabi seem to be kissing. They take a new picture together, and it reads [...] "Complete", thus ending the video.|$|E
