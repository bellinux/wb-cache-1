5000|$|The {{explosion}} {{was first}} noticed {{on the surface}} as a [...] "sharp retort" [...] at 21:00 on Wednesday 2 July 1879. Once John White, the oversman, had been summoned {{an attempt was made}} to lower the cage, but it stuck. White then descended number 3 pit and found that the men there were unaware of the explosion. He, a group of men, and shortly afterwards Mr Watson (the manager) proceeded up the communication mine into number 1 pit's workings. Parties descended the <b>blind</b> <b>pit</b> into the main coal and other parties searched the north workings and both reported all was well. Exploration of the south workings was stopped by falls and afterdamp. Various attempts were made to recover the bodies during the Thursday, but it was 04:00 on Friday before the whole workings could be reached and recovery completed.|$|E
40|$|Periorbital dermoid cysts {{should be}} removed because they {{commonly}} leak their irritant contents into the surrounding tissues. The underlying bone may, however, be involved in patients with dermoid cysts at the outer canthus. Computed tomography studies of 70 patients (43 men and 27 women, aged 30 months to 63 years, mean 29 years) with proved dermoid cysts of this type were reviewed. The lesion was always unilateral; 34 were on the left. The bone of the lateral wall and superotemporal angle of the orbit showed the following abnormalities, often in combination: pressure erosion in 61 cases and an otherwise abnormal shape, probably developmental, in 55; the dermoid cyst entered a tunnel or canal through the lateral wall in 24; a <b>blind</b> <b>pit</b> or crater in 15; and a cleft in 20; many patients also showed abnormal bone texture. These findings are extremely important for planning adequate surgery, and indicate that bony involvement is much more frequent than previously appreciated...|$|E

50|$|There are {{two common}} types of blinds for land and field-based {{waterfowl}} hunting: <b>pit</b> <b>blinds</b> and layout <b>blinds.</b> The <b>pit</b> <b>blind</b> {{can be a}} solid structure that is placed into {{a hole in the}} ground or on the bank of a waterbody. Since <b>pit</b> <b>blinds</b> rest below the top of the surrounding soil, some structural strength is required to prevent the soil from collapsing into the blind. Commercially available blinds can be made from fiberglass, polyethylene or even lightweight metals. Homemade blinds can also be constructed of wood, but typically cannot withstand the moisture of an underground habitat. Concrete walls are also constructed to form <b>pit</b> <b>blinds</b> typically on land owned or controlled by hunt clubs since this creates a permanent structure. <b>Pit</b> <b>blind</b> amenities can vary greatly from a basic blind with sticks or other temporary camouflage to elaborate multi-level blinds with small quarters for sleeping or cooking. Most <b>pit</b> <b>blinds</b> will have some form of movable door or slide that can be opened quickly when waterfowl are approaching while still allowing the hunters a good view while closed. Camouflage netting or screens are common materials for the movable top. One common drawback to <b>pit</b> <b>blinds</b> is their propensity to accumulate water. Especially in marsh or wetland areas, the soil can hold a large amount of moisture. <b>Pit</b> <b>blinds</b> are sometimes fitted with sump pumps or even hand operated pumps to assist the hunters in draining any water that has invaded the blind.|$|R
5000|$|Numbers 2 and 5 shafts {{were close}} to each other, within [...] Number 3 shaft was [...] away. Number 1 shaft was between the two but only reached the ell and main coals. <b>Blind</b> <b>pits,</b> that is shafts that do not extend to the surface, {{connected}} the ell and main coals to the split coal. The main coal ceased to be worked in November 1878 and the passages from shaft 1 bricked up. Shaft 1 continued to work the ell coal.|$|R
6000|$|Strangers {{entering}} the village would have supposed {{that a great}} explosion {{had taken place in}} some neighbouring <b>pit.</b> <b>Blinds</b> were down, women stood at the doors with their aprons to their eyes, children went about in an awed and silent way, as if afraid of the sound of their own voice, many of the young men and lads had their heads enveloped in surgical bandages, and a strange and unnatural calm pervaded the village. The [...] "Chequers" [...] and other public-houses, however, did a roaring trade, for the sight-seer in the black country is the thirstiest of men.|$|R
60|$|There is {{a valley}} {{of rocks and}} stones in every shade of red and brown, called the Valley of the Kings, where a little oil-engine coughs behind its hand all day long, {{grinding}} electricity to light the faces of dead Pharaohs a hundred feet underground. All down the valley, during the tourist season, stand char-a-bancs and donkeys and sand-carts, with here and there exhausted couples who have {{dropped out of the}} processions and glisten and fan themselves in some scrap of shade. Along the sides of the valley are the tombs of the kings neatly numbered, as it might be mining adits with concrete steps leading up to them, and iron grilles that lock of nights, and doorkeepers of the Department of Antiquities demanding the proper tickets. One enters, and from deeps below deeps hears the voices of dragomans booming through the names and titles of the illustrious and thrice-puissant dead. Rock-cut steps go down into hot, still darkness, passages-twist and are led over <b>blind</b> <b>pits</b> which, men say, the wise builders childishly hoped would be taken for the real tombs by thieves to come. Up and down these alley-ways clatter all the races of Europe with a solid backing of the United States. Their footsteps are suddenly blunted {{on the floor of a}} hall paved with immemorial dust that will never dance in any wind. They peer up at the blazoned ceilings, stoop down to the minutely decorated walls, crane and follow the sombre splendours of a cornice, draw in their breaths and climb up again to the fierce sunshine to re-dive into the next adit on their programme. What they think proper to say, they say aloud--and some of it is very interesting. What they feel you can guess from a certain haste in their movements--something between the shrinking modesty of a man under fire and the Hadn't-we-better-be-getting-on attitude of visitors to a mine. After all, it is not natural for man to go underground except for business or for the last time. He is conscious of the weight of mother-earth overhead, and when to her expectant bulk is added the whole beaked, horned, winged, and crowned hierarchy of a lost faith flaming at every turn of his eye, he naturally wishes to move away. Even the sight of a very great king indeed, sarcophagused under electric light in a hall full of most fortifying pictures, does not hold him too long.|$|R
40|$|This work {{examines}} {{the potential for}} computational creativ-ity in the culinary arts. In particular, we present the outcome of our efforts to create an artificial chef that produces novel salad recipes with limited human assistance. Our system was designed in two steps: first, we constructed a statistical model to rank recipes. Then, we experimented with various search algorithms to explore the salad recipe space and discover novel ingredient combinations. Surprisingly, we discovered that the top ranked recipes from a randomly generated pop-ulation were already of high quality, obviating the need for search. To validate {{the quality of our}} automatically generated salads, we conducted a <b>blind</b> taste test <b>pitting</b> three computer-designed and three human-designed salads against each other. We discovered that the best performing computer salad was competitive with the human generated salads. ...|$|R
50|$|In Fault Chamber, an easy {{climb up}} the eastern rift reaches a small window, that can be forced to an 8 m pitch that drops into an {{independent}} streamway - High Stream Passage. Upstream leads to an aven with an inlet entering, and a narrow 20 m long passage leading to a second aven. Downstream leads into High Stream Chamber where the water sinks in boulders {{to emerge from the}} impenetrable fissure mentioned above. A 22 m pitch drops into High Stream Chamber from Humble Inlet. Two passages can be reached from the top. Upstream, 100 m of decorated passage ends in a mineralised choke on a fault in the area of Humble Pot. The downstream passage is smaller and wetter, and finishes in a <b>blind</b> 18 m <b>pit.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Mississippi flyway is a {{migration}} route used by waterfowl {{to travel from}} central Canada to the Gulf of Mexico, flying along {{the route of the}} Mississippi River and its tributaries.In the Midwest and central United States, wildfowl hunting generally occurs on lakes, marshes, swamps, or rivers where ducks and geese land during their migration. Cornfields and rice paddies are also common hunting grounds, since geese and ducks often feed on the grain that remains in the field after harvest. In some areas, farmers rent or lease hunting rights. Some farmers or hunters form hunt clubs, which can cover thousands of acres and have resort-like amenities, or be as simple as a shallow <b>pit</b> <b>blind</b> dug into a field. On the East and West Coast of America and many parts of Europe, waterfowl hunters often focus on the seashore.|$|R
40|$|The {{following}} lepocreadiid {{species are}} described from Cheilodactylidae from south-western Australia. Cliveus peroni n. g., n. sp, from Nemadactylus valenciennesi is characterised by its attenuated forebody and C. acaenodera n. sp. from Dactylophora nigricans by its attenuated forebody, {{the pattern of}} forebody spination and the large cirrus-sac. Jericho chojeri n. g., n. sp. from N. valenciennesi has a large infundibuliform oral sucker and paired ani. Rugocavum n. g. is distinguished by the possession of a <b>blind,</b> wrinkled glandular <b>pit</b> on the postero-ventral surface of the forebody. R. nemadactyli n. sp. from N. valenciennesi has its vitelline field restricted to the hindbody, whereas in R. morwong n. sp, from N. valenciennesi the vitelline field reaches into the forebody. Paraneocreadium australiense Kruse, 1978 from N. valenciennesi is redescribed and its coiled internal seminal vesicle and lobed gonads are considered distinctive features. Scaphatrema nemadactyli (Kurochkin & Korotaeva, 1972) n. g., n. comb. from N. valenciennesi has a wrinkled, boat-shaped body, a 2 ̆ 7 Lepidapedon-like 2 ̆ 7 cirrus-sac and multiple testes; it was originally placed in the genus Multitestis, but these characters suggest that a new genus should be erected for it within the subfamily Lepidapedinae...|$|R
