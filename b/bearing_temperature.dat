50|$|Vayeron is an Australian based {{company that}} has {{developed}} a hardware sensor device {{which is designed to}} be embedded within the conveyor roller itself. The Smart-Idler™ is an automated conveyor roller condition monitoring & prognostics technology that is embedded within conveyor rollers when they are manufactured. The device monitors <b>bearing</b> <b>temperature,</b> vibration, acoustics and roller shell-wear to predict conveyor roller failure. This ultimately makes conveyor roller condition monitoring more efficient and reduces operational downtime. The Smart-Idler™ sensor operates without batteries, taking its power directly from the rotation of the conveyor roller, using a dynamo style energy harvesting method as it turns whilst in operation within the conveyor. Companies that make conveyor rollers can integrate the Smart-Idler™ within their conveyor roller products to create an enhanced roller offering for their clients - the owners and operators of conveyor systems. The embedded sensors have a multi-modal monitoring capability. Parameters such as <b>bearing</b> <b>temperature,</b> vibration, acoustics and roller shell wear are monitored and analysed to determine roller condition deterioration and flag impending failure.|$|E

40|$|LecturePg. 67 - 76 This paper {{describes}} the design modifications and active balancing on a 19, 000 hp integrally forged steam turbine rotor {{to improve its}} dynamic characteristics and reliability. The turbine was purchased {{as a replacement for}} an identical turbine used in a syn gas train. Ever since original installation, the turbine had been plagued with high vibration problems on the coupling end, excessive <b>bearing</b> <b>temperatures,</b> and reduced coupling life. A rotordynamic analysis proved that there was sufficient separation margin between the turbine's operating speed and any critical speed. However, at operating speed, the rotor had a high vibration response at the coupling, even with a very small unbalance. A design modification was thus incorporated on the rotor to make it less sensitive to unbalance. At operating speed, this modification lowered the predicted coupling end shaft deflection to approximately a third of its original value. An active balancer was then assembled on the rotor to provide the flexibility of online trim balancing. The replacement turbine has been installed and is operating with the lowest vibration and <b>bearing</b> <b>temperatures</b> in the compressor train's history. Presented in this paper is an overview of the rotordynamic analysis, the shaft welding technique used to accomplish the rotor design changes, and the balancing with the active balancer.

The test machine, the experimental results, and the comparison between theoretical thermoelastohydrodynamic results and experimental data are presented. The test bearings are located in two speed increasing and reduction gearboxes (back-to-hack test bed). The high speed shaft bearings are five shoe tilting-pad journal bearings. They are 160 mm in diameter and the bearing ratio (L/D) is equal to 1. 0. The rotational speed varies from 2700 rpm (22 m/s) to 11, 880 rpm (100 m/s). The applied load is up to 88 kN. Three types of bearings permit analyzing {{the influence of the}} bearing design and the pivot position on the pad. The low speed rotor bearings are offset-halves journal bearings.

The CMGs are {{very important for the}} ISS program because, first, they save propellant - which needs to be transferred to the Station in special cargo vehicles - and, second, they provide the microgravity environment on the Station - which is necessary for scientific experiments planned for the ISS mission. Since 2002, when one of the CMG on the ISS failed, all CMGs are closely monitored. High gimbal rates, vibration spikes, unusual variations of spin motor current and <b>bearing</b> <b>temperatures</b> are of great concern, since these parameters are the CMG health indicators.
