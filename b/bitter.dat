5|$|After {{successful}} test marketing from 1974, John Smith's <b>Bitter</b> {{was distributed}} in the South of England from 1979 onwards, accompanied by an extensive marketing budget. As research by Courage indicated that Southern drinkers considered Yorkshire <b>bitter</b> to be superior, the beer was sold there under the name John Smith's Yorkshire <b>Bitter.</b> Sales of the beer doubled in 1981 owing {{to the increase in}} free trade outlets in the South stocking the beer. By 1982 it was the highest selling Courage brand and the highest selling canned <b>bitter</b> in the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|As its {{common name}} suggests, it is {{extremely}} <b>bitter,</b> though not toxic as such. This bitterness is worsened by cooking. One specimen can foul the taste of a whole meal prepared with mushrooms. Despite this, it is sold in local markets (tianguis) in Mexico. A local recipe from France, Romania and East Germany calls for stewing it in skimmed milk after which it can be eaten, or powdered and used for flavouring. The mushroom is not <b>bitter</b> for those who lack genetic sensitivity to <b>bitter</b> taste, a trait endowed by the gene TAS2R38 (taste receptor 2 member 38). The compound responsible for the <b>bitter</b> taste has not been identified.|$|E

5|$|Bass moved {{production}} of Stones to its Burton upon Trent and Tadcaster breweries. In 2000, Bass sold its brewing interests, including their breweries and the Stones brand to the Belgian brewer Interbrew. Interbrew contracted the {{production of}} cask conditioned Stones to Marston's in Burton. Competition concerns forced Interbrew to sell off certain brands in December 2001, including Stones <b>Bitter,</b> which was bought by the American Coors Brewing Company (later Molson Coors). Molson Coors currently produce keg Stones <b>Bitter</b> at their brewery in Tadcaster, and the canned version at their Burton brewery.

5|$|Boddingtons Brewery was a {{regional}} brewery in Manchester, England, which owned pubs throughout the North West. Boddingtons {{was best known}} for Boddingtons <b>Bitter</b> (Boddies), a straw-golden, hoppy <b>bitter</b> {{which was one of}} the first beers to be packaged in cans containing a widget, giving it a creamy draught-style head.

5|$|By the 1920s, in bottled form, Worthington {{was one of}} {{only three}} nationally {{distributed}} beer brands, alongside Bass and Guinness. Product rationalisation began after the Second World War and although Worthington occasionally overtook Bass in sales, the decision was taken to prioritise Bass products. Arthur Manners took the chairmanship of Bass in 1947, and was instrumental in driving the company forward. Brewing industry mergers from the late 1950s onwards damaged Worthington sales, as tied house ownership became increasingly concentrated with brewers intent on promoting their own products. At the same time, bottled beer sales suffered as drinkers in search of consistency opted for the new keg beers instead. In 1965, the original Worthington brewery was closed, although production of the Worthington beers continued, consisting of White Shield, Green Shield (a filtered version of White Shield) and the draught product, E. Worthington E became the main keg <b>bitter</b> offered by Bass from 1967, and it had become a leading <b>bitter</b> brand by the 1970s, boosted by the company's network of 11,000 public houses. Worthington E was replaced as Bass' leading keg <b>bitter</b> by Worthington Best <b>Bitter</b> in the 1980s, and by Worthington Smoothflow from the mid-1990s. In 2000, Bass was bought by the Belgian brewer Interbrew. The Competition Commission ordered Interbrew to divest itself of a number of its recently acquired brands, and Worthington was bought by the American brewer Coors, who later became Molson Coors in 2005. In 2004 Coors announced that they would no longer advertise Worthington on a large scale.|$|E
