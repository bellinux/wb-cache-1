5|$|On {{the evening}} of May 20, 2013, the general public witnessed, through a {{dedicated}} webcam, that the bulb had apparently <b>burned</b> <b>out.</b> The next morning, an electrician {{was called in to}} confirm its status. It was determined that the bulb had not <b>burned</b> <b>out</b> when the uninterruptible power supply was bypassed, using an extension cord. The dedicated power supply was found to have been faulty. Approximately seven hours had transpired before the light was reestablished.|$|E

5|$|Hammer {{pointed out}} that Edison {{was not the first}} to make an {{electric}} light bulb. He claims instead that Edison made the first commercial electric light bulb that was successful. The other electric lamps made by others had inherent defects and <b>burned</b> <b>out</b> quickly, making them not practical for use to the general public. Edison first used various experimental vegetable fibers for the lamp filaments. One was a processed bamboo fiber used for a filament inside a glass bulb containing a vacuum. This was a filament of high resistance. Edison's electric lamp internal wire was unique in that the element had a resistance of around 140 ohms. There were several advantages to this, one being that several could be connected {{at the same time to}} a circuit. Others used filaments of low resistance ranging from 1 ohm to 5 ohms. This low resistance not only overloaded the electrical power system, but the wire filaments <b>burned</b> <b>out</b> quickly from extreme heat. They were impractical and expensive – not conducive to a commercial market.|$|E

Some have stated that the team was <b>burned</b> <b>out</b> following the extensive residency program {{leading up to the}} World Cup. Players were also critical of the decision of head coach Carolina Morace to hold the camp in Italy as opposed to Canada.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to investigate the relationship between informal learning, job satisfaction, <b>burn</b> <b>out</b> and mental health among workers of Esfahan Steel Company. The research approach is typically descriptive and causal - solidarity and for data analysis and syntheses, descriptive statistics solution have been used including mean value, standard deviation and frequency percentages and the inferential statistics solutions included multiple correlation coefficient, Pearson correlation, multivariate analysis of variance and path analysis. In this study, the correlation between informal learning and job satisfaction and the correlation between <b>burn</b> <b>out</b> and job satisfaction level have been found significant at P 0. 01. The correlation coefficient between <b>burn</b> <b>out</b> and mental health as well as mental health and job satisfaction have not been found as significant. Findings imply that burnout and informal learning can predict job satisfaction. Norelation ship has been observed between informal learning and <b>burn</b> <b>out</b> and between informal learning and mental health, while the relationships between informal learning and job satisfaction and between <b>burn</b> <b>out</b> and job satisfaction have been confirmed. The conceptual model of research has been evaluated using path analysis and Confirmatory Factor Analysis. Findings denote the direct effect of informal learning on job satisfaction and indirect effect of <b>burn</b> <b>out</b> on job satisfaction. Referring to the Structural Equation Modeling, among three main paths, the effect of informal learning and <b>burn</b> <b>out</b> on job satisfaction has been observed and it has been found that mental health has no effect on job satisfaction. Major limitation {{of this research is}} related to generalization of findings to other steel manufacturing companies, industries and public organizations...|$|R
5|$|Like many burgeoning {{cities of}} its day, Pittsburgh's growth outstripped {{some of its}} {{necessary}} infrastructure, such as a water supply with dependable pressure. Because of this, on April 10, 1845, a great fire <b>burned</b> <b>out</b> of control, destroying over a thousand buildings and causing $9M in damages. As the city rebuilt, the age of rails arrived. In 1851, the Ohio and Pennsylvania Railroad began service between Cleveland and Allegheny City (present-day North Side). In 1854, the Pennsylvania Railroad began service between Pittsburgh and Philadelphia.|$|E

On the first episode of ECW to air after December to Dismember, Show and Lashley would compete in a rematch for the ECW Championship. The Big Show lost, thus ending their storyline feud, and he announced his retirement from wrestling, although he made his return at the 2008 No Way Out.|$|E
5|$|On 23 November 1984, during {{renovation}} works, {{the station}} suffered a severe fire which <b>burned</b> <b>out</b> the northbound Victoria line platform. It {{is believed that}} the fire was caused by smoking materials being pushed through a ventilation grille into a storeroom where they set several materials on fire. This caused the Victoria line between Warren Street and Victoria to be suspended until 18 December the same year. This incident also led to a smoking ban being introduced on trains in July 1984.|$|E
50|$|One {{example is}} in {{miniature}} Christmas lights which are wired in series. When the filament <b>burns</b> <b>out</b> {{in one of}} the incandescent light bulbs, the electrical resistance becomes very high. The much higher voltage that this creates (equal to the full line voltage rather than the normal voltage divider level) causes the shunt to short out (becoming an antifuse) and become part of the circuit, again allowing electricity to pass and the set to light. If too many lights <b>burn</b> <b>out</b> however, a shunt will also <b>burn</b> <b>out,</b> requiring the use of a multimeter to find the point of failure.|$|R

5|$|On July 28, 1928 William S. Grattan {{responded to}} the oil barge James F. Cahill, loaded with 5,000 barrels of crude oil, that was aflame. After burning 17 hours, the barge's mooring lines gave way and the barge began to drift. William S. Grattans crew {{attempted}} to attach tow lines to the drifting barge but it struck a dock at an oil company where the empty oil tanker B.B. McColl was moored. The fumes on the B.B. McColl ignited causing an explosion and fire that engulfed William S. Grattan. Captain Thomas Hylant along with his crew abandoned ship and swam through the flames to shore. Chief Engineer Thomas Lynch of William S. Grattan lost his life and seven other crew members were injured. The unattended boilers on William S. Grattan soon ran dry and exploded, leaving the ship <b>burned</b> <b>out</b> and heavily damaged.|$|E
5|$|On {{the evening}} of September 11, 1957, {{plutonium}} shavings in a glove box located in building 771 (the Plutonium Recovery and Fabrication Facility) spontaneously ignited. The fire spread to the flammable glove box materials, including plexiglas windows and rubber gloves. The fire rapidly spread through the interconnected glove boxes and ignited the large bank of High-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters located in a plenum downstream. Within minutes the first filters had <b>burned</b> <b>out,</b> allowing plutonium particles {{to escape from the}} building exhaust stacks. The building exhaust fans stopped operating due to fire damage at 10:40 PM, which ended the majority of the plutonium release. Fire fighters initially used carbon dioxide fire extinguishers because water can act as a moderator and cause plutonium to go critical. They resorted to water hoses when the dry fire extinguishers proved ineffective.|$|E
5|$|On {{the front}} side, on the Rokin, the rescue {{operations}} of the fire department were also hampered. There were so many people standing on the window ledges screaming that the fire fighters did not know who to save first. Time was also lost because some people threw their luggage in the life net and then jumped into it themselves, causing injuries. Some people fell {{to the side of}} the net and were severely injured. Just before 7:00am the part of the hotel which faced the Kalverstraat collapsed. The burning debris landed on the fire engine in the Kalverstraat, and the fire fighters barely escaped to safety. The nearby book store was also <b>burned</b> <b>out</b> and fires broke out in several buildings on the other side of the Kalverstraat, which were quickly brought under control.|$|E
