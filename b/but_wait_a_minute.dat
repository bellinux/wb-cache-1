60|$|Wrapping {{herself up}} {{in a red}} cloak, {{she went to the}} window, gently drew up a corner of the curtain, and peeped out, as she had done many times before. Nobody who was not quite close beneath her window could see her face; but as it happened, {{somebody}} was close. The soldiers whose floundering Anne had heard were not Loveday's dragoons, but a troop of the York Hussars, quite oblivious of her existence. They had passed on out of the water, and instead of them there sat Festus Derriman alone on his horse, and in plain clothes, the water reaching up to the animal's belly, and Festus' heels elevated over the saddle {{to keep them out of}} the stream, which threatened to wash rider and horse into the deep mill-head just below. It was plainly he who had struck her lattice, for in a moment he looked up, and their eyes met. Festus laughed loudly, and slapped her window again; and just at that moment the dragoons began prancing down the slope in review order. She could not <b>but</b> <b>wait</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> or two to see them pass. While doing so she was suddenly led to draw back, drop the corner of the curtain, and blush privately in her room. She had not only been seen by Festus Derriman, but by John Loveday, who, riding along with his trumpet slung up behind him, had looked over his shoulder at the phenomenon of Derriman beneath Anne's bedroom window and seemed quite astounded at the sight.|$|E

I didn't mention the dice-playing, but I could see that Red Jacket's doings had made Talleyrand highly curious about Indians--though he would call him the Huron. Toby, as you may believe, was all holds full of knowledge concerning their manners and habits. He only needed a listener. The Brethren don't study Indians much till they join the Church, but Toby knew 'em wild. So evening after evening Talleyrand crossed his sound leg over his game one and Toby poured forth. Having been adopted into the Senecas I, naturally, kept still, but Toby 'ud call on me to back up some of his remarks, and by that means, and a habit he had of drawing you on in talk, Talleyrand saw I knew something of his noble savages too. Then he tried a trick. Coming back from an emigre party he turns into his little shop and puts it to me, laughing like, that I'd gone with the two chiefs on their visit to Big Hand. I hadn't told. Red Jacket hadn't told, and Toby, of course, didn't know. 'Twas just Talleyrand's guess. [...] "Now," [...] he says, [...] "my English and Red Jacket's French was so bad that I am not sure I got the rights of what the President really said to the unsophisticated Huron.

40|$|China has {{the third-largest}} {{economy in the}} world, with a gross {{domestic}} product of U. S. $ 748 billion in 2000 and an economic growth rate of 8. 2 percent. By as early as 2007, it is projected {{that it will have}} the world's largest economy, outstripping in gross terms both the United States and the European Union. Second only to Japan, China is currently running a huge trade surplus with the United States while prices at home remain relatively stable. In 1997 - 98, during the Asian financial crisis, the semiconvertible yuan was largely unaffected while the currencies of China's regional neigbors were clobbered. These and other impressive data indicate an economy that by any measure has witnessed more than twenty years of unbridled success and has nothing but smooth sailing ahead. <b>But</b> <b>wait</b> just <b>a</b> <b>minute,</b> says the renowned economist and journalist, He Qinglian.

Is He Qinglian simply a Chinese naysayer? A Beijing "nabob of negativism"? Someone too willing to throw cold water on what by all accounts has been two remarkable decades and more of economic progress for possibly the largest segment of humankind in history? Perhaps. But then, consider the points made in the following three chapters of He Qinglian's monumental work, which has been influential among China's leaders and regime critics alike, and which the translators, Nancy Yang Liu and Lawrence R. Sullivan, have rendered in English as >i>China's Descent into a Quagmire. >/i>...|$|R

40|$|Public–private {{partnerships}} {{need to be}} reassessed, argues GRAEME HODGE. THE PPP (public-private partnership) policy experiment {{has been}} wonderfully ambiguous and colourful. It has promised just about everything to everybody, from better value for money and on-time delivery, to innovation and reduced pressure on public sector budgets. Indeed, the PPP phenomenon is now a brand for third-way governments. Like Coca-Cola, PPPs are life. But underneath these word games, crucial issues are at stake and real decisions now need to be made. It’s time to take stock and move on. The British government announced last month {{that it would be}} giving loans to private banks that could not get credit to finance existing PPP projects. They claimed that without this, citizens would “incur significant additional delays or risk projects failing. ” And in Australia the Victorian government has apparently followed suit. <b>But</b> <b>wait</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute.</b> Why would your government give loans to private banks to fund private companies to build public infrastructure? And, in any event, why would sane people trust banks and financiers when the whole reason private banks are not offering each other credit is that they still do not sufficiently trust each other? How could the logic of providing essential public infrastructure have become so corrupted?Perhaps governments have supported this partnership policy so strongly that they are embarrassed to change direction? Or perhaps it’s just a way of boosting confidence or subsidising the financial system in difficult times? In any event, the concept of “public-private partnerships” has always included a huge variety of ways in which governments relate to both businesses and to civil society groups. In infrastructure provision, we know that deals between governments and business go back centuries. And we also know that private building contractors bring in lots of skills. These, to me, are not in dispute. But there are dozens of ways in which private construction companies can be sensibly employed to build public infrastructure. Victoria’s PPP policies are built on two foundations: first, our belief that bundling many smaller contracts across multiple firms into one single large consortium deal is good professional practice. Agreed. But we have arbitrarily married this idea up to a second notion that PPPs require private finance in order to work. This is nonsense. It is simply a reflection of the belief that self-interest and private financial engineering should be the basis for economic welfare. Surely a major lesson from the global credit crisis has been the reality that self-interest does not guarantee efficient market behaviours. It leads too often to huge and immediate cash windfalls for smart financial executives, making the risks complex {{to the point of being}} incomprehensible, and to a game of pass the financial parcel! So why would we continue to play this pass the parcel game now after the music has stopped?Governments need to think not about what their past role has been, but about what it should be in future. The latest international journals, such as Britain’s Economic Affairs, make it clear that much so-called PPP evidence is not at all reliable. It looks more like industry advertising on one side and ideology on the other. And they also make it clear that PPP project experiences include a variety of successes and failures, and that there are now concerns in Britain as to value for money and long-term costs to taxpayers. Particular parts of the evidence will continue to be emphasised over other parts to support one side of the argument or the other. What direction should we take with our PPPs?I think it’s time that the various future options for “partnership” are put more clearly on the table for real debate. Rather than initiatives being forced to fit the existing narrow private finance model, we need to expand our horizons. Either the public or private sector could, in concept, be responsible for controlling, funding, managing, constructing or owning infrastructure — with all options contestable. If we do, though, insist that governments guarantee credit, give tax exemptions, or take on more risks within the current narrow partnership model, then let’s be honest and call it industry assistance. It’s also time to try some new policy experiments in public finance and capacity building. Sensible, strong and transparent policy and institutional options are needed here. We are clearly crying out for government leadership and public initiative on this front. New partnerships could be chosen from many different publicly funded models that properly use incentives to get results through accountable public and private entities. From state enterprise such as the Snowy Mountains Authority to today’s independent regulators, massive infrastructure have been provided and maintained. Australians have proved to be sensible and pragmatic. Why can’t we do this again?Whatever you decide, ministers, please don’t take the advice of the transaction merchants who’ve lined up at your door for the past few decades. Their advice, to my mind, has been self-serving and far more profitable for them than for citizens. •Professor Graeme Hodge is in the law faculty at Monash University.
