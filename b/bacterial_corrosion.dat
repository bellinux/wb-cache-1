40|$|The {{incidence}} of Stress Corrosion Cracking (SCC) in rock bolts {{has not been}} quantified and its magnitude has not been addressed. A laboratory test has been achieved that causes a tensile sample to fail {{in a manner similar}} to the failure mode observed from service failures, namely slow SCC followed by fast brittle fracture. The laboratory tests involve subjecting a tensile sample to a linearly increasing stress at a slowly applied stress rate whilst the specimen in exposed to a dilute sulphate solution of pH 2. 1. Detailed fractography of SCC fracture features from the LT has shown that these fracture surfaces have the same features as fracture surfaces of service failures. An SCC velocity can be calculated from these tests. This SCC velocity can be used to evaluate the benefit provided by a material with a higher fracture toughness. The SCC velocity measured from the laboratory tests indicates that the SCC lifetime is increased only marginally by the use of a rock bolt materials with a higher fracture toughness Laboratory tests are being used to evaluate the threshold stress for rock bolts of various metallurgies and the environments causing stress corrosion cracking. A hydrogen embrittlement mechanism for the SCC is indicated by the particular restricted range of conditions for which SCC occurs in the laboratory. In particular, SCC only occurs in the laboratory for the restricted range of environmental conditions corresponding to acid conditions at the open circuit potential (pH of 2. 1 or more acid) or at negative applied electrochemical potentials corresponding to copious hydrogen evolution at the steel surface. This is consistent with reports from the USA indicating rock bolt failure due to the presence of H 2 S in the mine atmosphere. Similarly, this failure mechanism is consistent with <b>bacterial</b> <b>corrosion</b> of the rock bolt surface during service producing acid conditions leading to SCC. Water chemistry analyses carried out for a number of Australian mines (including one coal mine) visited during the 2002 suggest that SCC in a coal mine would be caused by <b>bacterial</b> <b>corrosion</b> locally decreasing the mine water pH down to a pH of 2. 1...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{progress}} has been made in developing a mathematical and probabilistic model for general corrosion of structural steels exposed to sea water immersion corrosion.

Herein, three different sets of corrosion field data, for Halong Bay in Vietnam, for an offshore oil platform site and for three coastal sites along the China coast are examined for compatibility with the model. It is shown that all the data are consistent with the model provided allowance is made for the season of the first immersion, the effect of sea water velocity and the possibility of nutrient pollution. In its most general form, the model is probabilistic to allow for natural variability owing to unrecorded (and perhaps unrecordable) influences.

40|$|Our {{understanding}} {{and use of}} biomaterials evolves according {{to our understanding of}} the phenomenon of biocompatibility. in earlier days, biocompatibility was synonymous with the word âinertnessâ. Attempts to create such an inert biomaterial, however, failed. As a result, the quest for a perfect biomaterial has shifted from seeking an inert one to a material that interacts with the biosystem it is in contact with in the same way as a natural material would react in the same place. Respectively, biocompatibility is defined as âthe ability of a material, device or system to perform without a clinically significant host response in a specific applicationâ [1]. Although bulk properties of biomaterials, such as mechanical strength and optical properties, are equally important for their performance, surface properties are most closely related to their biocompatibility. Complexity of interfacial phenomena at the âbiomaterial â biological mediumâ interface is hard to overestimate. They include adsorption (of water, proteins, low molecular solutes, etc.), ion exchange, cell and <b>bacterial</b> adhesion, <b>corrosion</b> and decomposition of biomaterial, catalytic effects and so on.

40|$|A {{distinctive}} {{suite of}} small-scale erosional forms that are oriented towards the light occur {{close to the}} entrance of Cueva Charles Brewer, a large cave in a sandstone tepui, in SE Venezuela. These are the third example of photokarren ever studied in the world, the other two being from Borneo and Ireland. They are the only photokarren ever described from sandstone, and the only example from a non-carbonate environment. The host rock is a poorly-lithified unit of the Precambrian quartz arenite of the Roraima Supergroup. The forms are all oriented towards the light at 30 Â° regardless of rock surface orientation. The primary (negative) erosional form is the tube. Coalescence of tubes results in the positive remnant forms of rods, pinnacles, and cones. The final stage is a bumpy, wavy surface of degraded cones. The size of the features varies with erosion rate, and details of the form vary with development stage. The main population averages 4. 4 cm in depth, with 55 % of the surface eroded. This is divided into 10 % tubes, 70 % rods, 10 % cones, 5 % linear valley and 5 % wavy lowland. The micro-ecosystem includes many bacteria, diatoms, red algae, green algae, liverworts, and oribatid mites, but, surprisingly, no cyanobacteria. The presence of a surface biofilm inside the forms but not on the remnant rock surface and, in the non-degraded forms, the direct relationship of biomass with depth suggests that biological activity is the dominant control on development.

40|$|Metal {{corrosion}} is {{of worldwide}} concern {{because it is}} the cause of major economic losses, and because it creates significant safety issues. The mechanism of the corrosion process, as influenced by bacteria, has been studied extensively. However, the bacterial communities that create the biofilms that form on metals are complicated, and have not been well studied. This is why we sought to analyze the composition of bacterial communities living on steel structures, together with the influence of ecological factors on these communities. The corrosion samples were collected from rust layers on steel plates that were immersed in seawater for two different periods at Sanya and Xiamen, China. We analyzed the bacterial communities on the samples by targeted 16 S rRNA gene (V 3 âV 4 region) sequencing using the Illumina MiSeq. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the bacteria fell into 13 phylotypes (similarity level = 97 %). Proteobacteria, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes were the dominant phyla, accounting for 88. 84 % of the total. Deltaproteobacteria, Clostridia and Gammaproteobacteria were the dominant classes, and accounted for 70. 90 % of the total. Desulfovibrio spp., Desulfobacter spp. and Desulfotomaculum spp. were the dominant genera and accounted for 45. 87 % of the total. These genera are sulfate-reducing bacteria that are known to corrode steel. Bacterial diversity on the 6 months immersion samples was much higher than that of the samples that had been immersed for 8 years (P 0. 05, Studentâs t-test). Overall, the data showed that the rust layers on the steel plates carried many bacterial species. The bacterial community composition was influenced by the immersion time.

40|$|Many {{extensive}} atmospheric corrosivity {{surveys have}} been undertaken covering cities, regional areas and sometimes countries {{in order to}} plot corrosion maps and identify possible sources of higher infrastructure risk. Classically, the surveys employ mild steel, copper steel and/or zinc coupons and corrosivity is derived by determining mass loss of the exposed specimens. Higher areas of corrosion loss are generally ascribed to airborne chlorides from marine sources and/or sulphur and nitrogen compounds from industrial fallout. <b>Bacterial</b> influence on <b>corrosion</b> {{has been well documented}} in buried and marine conditions and more recently recognized as a major factor in tidal conditions notably as accelerated low water corrosion.

Results showed that the formation and transformation of <b>corrosion</b> products and <b>bacterial</b> community {{are closely related to}} each other. The presence of sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB, e. g. Desulfovibrio and Desulfotomaculum), sulfur-oxidizing bacteria (SOB, e. g. Sulfuricella), and iron-oxidizing bacteria (IOB, e. g. Acidovorax, Gallionella, Leptothrix, and Sphaerotilus) in biofilms could speed up iron corrosion; however, iron-reducing bacteria (IRB, e. g. Bacillus, Clostridium, and Pseudomonas) could inhibit iron corrosion and iron release. Corrosion scales on iron coupons could develop into a two-layered structure (top layer and inner layer) with time. The relatively stable constituents such as goethite (alpha-FeOOH) and magnetite (Fe 3 O 4) mainly existed in the top layers, while green rust (Fe- 6 (OH) (12) CO 3) mainly existed in the inner layers.

40|$|Microbially {{influenced}} corrosion (MIC) is {{a costly}} and poorly understood source of corrosion that plagues many modern industrial {{processes such as}} oil extraction and transportation. Throughout the years, many possible mechanisms for MIC have been proposed. One specific proposed mechanism was tested in this thesis: that the metal-binding characteristic of <b>bacterial</b> biofilms enhanced <b>corrosion</b> when it appears in conjunction with an iron sulfide film. Two model biogels were used: calcium alginate, which has this metal-binding property, and agarose, which does not. In pursuit of this hypothesis, iron sulfide films were grown on mild steel coupons. Two distinct forms of iron sulfides were grown: a loose black product at low sulfide concentrations, and an adherent gold product at high sulfide concentrations. Many materials characterization techniques were attempted, and the black corrosion product {{was found to be}} a mixture of greigite and marcasite. However, this composition was observed to change irreversibly with the application of a laser that caused the material to either heat and/or dry. The resulting golden-colored corrosion product was found to consist mainly of monosulfides, implying the presence of mackinawite or pyrrhotite. By using electrochemical polarization experiments, it was found that calcium alginate enhanced the rate of corrosion; agarose reduced the rate of corrosion. This is in contrast to previously published literature. Contrary to the initial hypothesis, adding an underlying iron sulfide film did not appreciably alter the measured rate of corrosion. Additionally, it was found that biofilms generated by sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) enhanced corrosion {{in a manner similar to}} the calcium alginate gel, and lysing the cells within the biofilm did nothing to alter this effect. This implies that the biofilm itself, even in the absence of active bacterial metabolic activity, can enhance corrosion rates observed in MIC. by Kwan Li. Thesis: S.
