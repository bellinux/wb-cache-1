25|$|Cleveland Rolling Mill {{expanded}} {{its presence in}} 1868 {{with the construction of}} the Newburgh Steel Works next to its existing plant. The new works included an open hearth Bessemer furnace; it was the first continuous open hearth Bessemer furnace west of the Allegheny Mountains and only the fifth such furnace in the nation. By the end of 1872, the combined Cleveland plants had two puddling mills; two blast furnaces; two Bessemer converters; a <b>boiler</b> <b>plate</b> mill; two rail and rod mills; a wire mill; and a bolt, nut, and spike manufacturing shop. The Newburgh plants were producing so much pig iron, cast iron, and steel that Cleveland Rolling Mill became one of the principal metalworks in the state.|$|E
25|$|While the paroled prisoners, {{primarily}} from the states of Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee, and West Virginia, were brought from the parole camp to Sultana, a mechanic was brought down {{to work on the}} leaky boiler. Although the mechanic wanted to cut out and replace a ruptured seam, Mason knew that such a job would take a few days and cost him his precious load of prisoners. By the time the repairs would be completed, the prisoners would have been sent home on other boats. Instead, Mason and his chief engineer, Nathan Wintringer, convinced the mechanic to make temporary repairs, hammering back the bulged <b>boiler</b> <b>plate</b> and riveting a patch of lesser thickness over the seam. Instead of taking two or three days, the temporary repair took only one. During her time in port, and while the repair was being made, Sultana took on the paroled prisoners.|$|E

50|$|However the {{contamination}} of boiler feedwater with foreign bodies was a problem. Old sources report {{erosion of the}} <b>boiler</b> <b>plates</b> which was caused by fatty acids contained in the lubricant accompanying the exhaust steam. On the other hand the formation of scale in the boiler was delayed because a proportion of the boiler scale constituents had already been {{left behind in the}} tender.|$|R
40|$|The {{customers}} {{active involvement}} {{has been the}} focus in almost every software development project in the past decade. The latest and most popular agile developments methodologies require customers feedback and approval during the development process. IT-development companies usually manage requirements using a formal requirement specification document. This document is created and prepared for experts and programmers in the development project. Since customers normally don t understand the requirement document, a simple and understandable version of it needs to be provided {{in order for them to}} be able to participate in the development process. The process of translating or converting formal requirements to a simpler or informal version is usually done manually by the development team. The possibility of converting formal to informal requirements has been investigated earlier. Since <b>boiler</b> <b>plates</b> are used in the conversion, an application that support creating and editing <b>boiler</b> <b>plates</b> is required. This thesis will study how this conversion can be performed in practice using user stories, <b>boiler</b> <b>plates</b> and a requirement management application. This thesis will also investigate whether developers from the industry see any advantage in this conversion. The result of this thesis is divided into two main parts. The first part describes how the conversion is performed, challenges and limitations in this process and the new user stories created as result of this conversion. The described conversion is a semi-automated process. The second part presents the results from the interviews conducted with employees from IT-companies in the industry. A selected group of developers has been interviewed and the opinions about the conversion from formal to informal requirements are collected. </p...|$|R
25|$|In the {{original}} contract of 25 February 1916 {{it had been}} stipulated that all four hundred units would be delivered that same year: the first hundred by 25 August and the last by 25 November, completing the full order in nine months. Because Schneider had no experience in tracked armoured fighting vehicle production and a true pilot model was lacking, this was highly optimistic. Also the Schneider company had expected {{to be able to}} employ the other major French arms producer, the Forges et Aciéries de la Marine et d'Homécourt, as a subcontractor but this rival proceeded to develop from the alternative prototype ordered by Mourret a heavier tank design, the Saint-Chamond. As a result, the first prototype could only be presented to the Ministry of Armament on 4 August. The Schneider subsidiary Société d'outillage mécanique et d'usinage d'artillerie or SOMUA at Saint Ouen near Paris was only on 5 September able to finish the first vehicle chassis, which would on 8 September be delivered at the training centre at Marly. The first Army tests were carried out on 12 September. On {{the original}} deadline of 25 November the total had risen to just eight vehicles; on 4 January 1917 thirty-two were present. To aggravate matters, these were training vehicles, not fitted with hardened armour but <b>boiler</b> <b>plate.</b>|$|E

500|$|Other {{problems}} that delayed the ship's completion were shortages of material, labor and money. Prices for pig iron and bar iron nearly tripled while <b>boiler</b> <b>plate</b> and copper roughly doubled. Wages of even inexperienced workers increased between 50 and 100 percent. The New York City draft riots in July 1863 and several machinist's strikes further slowed progress on Dunderberg. Webb failed {{to account for}} these problems when negotiating the ship's contract and he repeatedly tried to charge the Navy for alterations as well as use cheaper materials to reduce his costs.

50|$|The next {{improvement}} was {{achieved in the}} late 1820s by Samuel Grose, who decreased the heat loss by insulating the pipes, cylinders, and boilers of the engines, improving the duty to more than 60 million at Wheal Hope and later to almost 80 million at Wheal Towan. Nevertheless, the best duty was usually a short-lived achievement due to general deterioration of machinery, leaks from boilers, and the deterioration of <b>boiler</b> <b>plates</b> (meaning that pressure had to be reduced).|$|R

2500|$|Firing a [...] bullet at [...] from a [...] barrel, the 6mm U.S.N. was the highest-velocity {{cartridge}} used by {{any military}} {{force at the}} time of its adoption.

[...] The new loading had an effective range (individual rifle fire) of around 600-700 yards, at which point the blunt-tip bullet rapidly lost velocity and energy. [...] The [...] bullet, like its predecessor, demonstrated an inclination to instability unless rapidly rotated. The M1895 Lee rifle therefore received a rapid barrel rifling twist of one turn in 7.5 inches (19cm) (with right-hand twist) to keep the bullet from wobbling or tumbling at extended ranges. At some point, this rifling was changed in later production rifles to one turn in 10 inches RH (25cm). [...] Contemporary medical reports of the day noted the [...] bullet produced noticeably greater damage to tissue and bone than other military cartridges of the day when fired at full velocity (2,560 fps), and the bullet's copper jacket frequently fragmented or detached entirely from its lead core after penetrating a hard substance such as bone or metal. On the other hand, when the 6mm bullet struck muscle or air-filled cavities such as the lungs, the bullet tended to make a perforating wound of small diameter that caused little damage.|$|E

2500|$|To deploy tanks, it {{was first}} needed to train crews and create tank units. On 14 July 1916 Estienne started {{to set up a}} {{training}} base at the Fort du Trou-d'Enfer, a fortress at Marly-le-Roi, west of Paris. For reasons of secrecy this location was officially attached to the 81st Heavy Artillery Regiment, a depot unit. On 15 August the camp was formally established and quickly filled with recruits, most of them young volunteers from various French armies. [...] At Marly the crews received their first instruction consisting of the basics of maintenance and a lot of driver training with an emphasis on crossing trenches, avoiding shell craters and running down trees and walls. Because no actual Schneider vehicles were available at first, Holt tractors were used instead; later <b>boiler</b> <b>plate</b> training chassis were employed with the superstructure removed and replaced by a protective wooden frame. From the spring of 1917 onwards about seven vehicles were used for this goal. For unit training and live fire exercises, which required much larger manoeuvre grounds, on 30 August 1916 a camp was established at Cercottes. It received its first training vehicles on 17 November 1916. To get better acquainted with the mechanical side of the tanks, most crew members left Cercottes for a month to work as a trainee at the SOMUA factory. New vehicles would normally be first delivered at Cercottes. In 1917 the Cercottes base grew to a strength of about five thousand men, many of them sent there from units {{trying to get rid of}} undesirable elements, forcing the base command to reduce manpower by again removing them. On 28 September 1916 a large instruction centre was established at Champlieu, south of Compiègne. [...] This location, close to the frontline and officially part of the warzone, could serve for final training and sending out battle-ready units to those armies needing them. [...] The tank workshops were also located there, repairing and updating existing vehicles. The bases at Cercottes and Champlieu used about sixty-four tanks purely for training purposes, to limit the wear on the combat vehicles.|$|E

50|$|The Chester Rolling Mill was {{established}} {{on the site}} of an old bridge and steel works at the foot of Wilson and Hayes Sts., Chester, incorporating the area between Townsend to Highland Ave., and from Front St. to the Delaware River. Construction of the main rolling mill, a building with dimensions of 160 x 185 feet, began in 1875. In 1879, the building was doubled in size, from 160 to 320 feet. Initial output was 700 tons of pig iron and 300 tons of iron ship plate.

50|$|Cornish boilers {{had several}} {{advantages}} over the preceding wagon boilers: they were composed of mostly curved surfaces, better {{to resist the}} pressure. Their flat ends were smaller than the flat sides of the wagon boiler and were stayed by the central furnace flue, and sometimes by additional long rod stays. A less obvious advantage was that of boiler scale. Wagon or haystack boilers were heated from beneath and any scale or impurities that formed a sediment settled upon this plate, insulating it from the water. This reduced heating efficiency and could in extremis lead to local overheating and failure of the <b>boiler</b> <b>plates.</b> In the flued boiler, any sediment fell past the furnace flue and settled out {{at the bottom of}} the boiler shell, where it had less effect.|$|R
50|$|The {{class had}} a {{reputation}} for being free steamers and strong pullers. Although they have a well-deserved reputation for their reliability, like any new class the W locos suffered some minor teething problems, including ashpan failures, and leaks in and around the foundation ring. The leaks were traced to faulty welding. The class suffered from stay failures in its early days, particularly in and around the throat plate. The first to fail was W913 in 1952. At one point, no less than 34 of the class were in Midland Railway Workshops or regional depots for stay repair. The problem was traced back to the thermic syphons creating significant water movement in the area, overstressing the <b>boiler</b> <b>plates,</b> as well as problems with the quality of the original stays. The syphons were progressively removed over a seven-year period, eliminating the problem.|$|R
