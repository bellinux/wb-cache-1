5|$|Videoball plays as a {{two-dimensional}} hybrid of air hockey and soccer {{on a single}} screen. Players form two teams of one to three players. Each player uses an analog stick to control a triangle-shaped avatar and presses a single <b>button</b> <b>to</b> shoot triangle-shaped projectiles. The object {{of the game is}} to knock one or more circular balls into the opposing team's goal. Players hold the <b>button</b> <b>to</b> charge a shot, which fires upon release. The projectile can propel the ball, block other projectiles, and incapacitate opponents. Since the shot is triangle-shaped, it can only drive the ball for some distance before the ball veers off-course.|$|E
5|$|Alonso {{held off}} Vettel to {{maintain}} his start line advantage on the first lap. Lewis Hamilton, who started third, fought off teammate Jenson <b>Button</b> <b>to</b> retain his start position. The top two remained the same through {{the first and only}} round of pit stops. Webber's team, Red Bull, opted to pit him early allowing him to move ahead of Hamilton. The race was neutralised by the deployment of the safety car after Kamui Kobayashi and Bruno Senna crashed on lap 31. Hamilton retired after a collision with Webber shortly after the race restarted on lap 36. Alonso maintained his lead throughout the remainder of the race despite pressure from Vettel.|$|E
5|$|Further {{back in the}} field, Max Verstappen overtook Nasr and <b>Button</b> <b>to</b> {{move into}} twelfth place on laps 44 and 46 respectively. However, he was deemed to have forced Button wide and was handed a five-second penalty {{to be added to}} his {{finishing}} time. Lap 53 saw Romain Grosjean move into the final point scoring position of tenth by passing Carlos Sainz Jr. into turn eight. Just one lap later, he took ninth place from Daniil Kvyat. At the front, Hamilton proved unable to reach his teammate, who took the checkered flag for his sixth win of the season. Kimi Räikkönen completed the podium, followed by Vettel, Pérez and Ricciardo.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the standard four difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard, and Expert) for each song and instrument, a new Beginner level has been added in World Tour. This difficulty is aimed for younger and unskilled players; notes are generally simple straight lines in time with bass drum beats, and allowing any or no fret <b>button</b> <b>to</b> be held while the note is strummed (for lead and bass guitar), any drum to be hit (for drums), or any sound to be made (for vocals).|$|E
5|$|Monkey Fight: One to {{four players}} {{simultaneously}} engage in combat by rolling {{in any direction}} with the analog stick and using the A <b>button</b> <b>to</b> punch opponents with a boxing glove attached to their monkey's ball. Points are awarded for knocking opponents {{off one of the}} three available arenas, with more points being awarded when the player currently in the lead is knocked off. The player with the most points is declared the winner of a round when the in-game timer reaches zero. Items can be used to extend the reach, size, and strength of one's boxing glove.|$|E
5|$|Never 7 is {{a visual}} novel {{in which the}} player reads the story, and presses a <b>button</b> <b>to</b> advance through the text. At certain points, the player gets to make choices which affect the {{direction}} the plot proceeds in; these involve choosing what location to move to, and what the player character should say, as well as subtler choices such as whether to look {{a girl in the}} eyes or to take her hand. The game is presented from a first-person perspective, with pre-rendered backgrounds and 2D character portraits accompanying the text. The visuals mostly consist of still images, but with characters often changing their expression while talking.|$|E

5|$|The {{context-sensitive}} button mechanic {{allows one}} <b>button</b> <b>to</b> serve {{a variety of}} functions, such as talking, opening doors, and pushing, pulling, and throwing objects. The on-screen display shows what action, if any, the button will trigger, determined by the situation. For example, if Link is holding a rock, the context-sensitive button will cause Link to throw the rock if he is moving or targeting an object or enemy, or place the rock on the ground if he is standing still.|$|E
5|$|The game's {{control scheme}} uses a two-way {{joystick}} and five buttons. Jarvis designed the controls to emulate both Space Invaders and Asteroids simultaneously. The player's left hand manipulates the joystick similar to Space Invaders {{and the right}} hand pushes buttons similar to Asteroids. The button functions also use a similar layout to Asteroids, with the <b>button</b> <b>to</b> shoot projectiles and accelerate {{on the far right}} and left, respectively. Jarvis reasoned that players were accustomed to the control schemes of past games, and felt altering past designs would prove difficult for them.|$|E
5|$|Videoball is {{a minimalist}} sports video game by Action Button Entertainment. Up to six human and {{computer-controlled}} players form two teams. Each uses an analog stick {{and a single}} <b>button</b> <b>to</b> control triangles that shoot charged projectiles at a ball and other players. The objective is to knock {{the ball into the}} opposing team's goal. Apart from exhibition matches, the game has a scenario challenge-based Arcade mode, and supports online team and ranked multiplayer matchmaking. Videoball has a simple visual style with bright colors, basic shapes, and many customization options.|$|E

The winning bid was $26,000, placed by a consortium of eight demolition contractors who currently undertake demolitions in the Christchurch Central City (D Construction, Dormer Construction, Jurgens Demolition, March Construction, Pro Tranz Contracting, Clampet Developments, Shilton and Brown Demolition, and Ward's Demolition). They gave {{the right to choose}} a person to push the <b>button</b> <b>to</b> the Child Cancer Foundation, who nominated a six-year-old boy from Queenstown.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton {{crossed the}} line to win his second race of the season, with Rosberg {{following}} him home in 2nd and Vettel completing the podium with 3rd. Pastor Maldonado had an eventful race. On lap 33, while running in seventh position ahead of teammate Romain Grosjean, he missed the pit entry and lost time, dropping several positions. He then proceeded to spin his car on lap 39 as he attempted {{to make up for}} lost time, and on lap 48 he had a collision with Jenson Button following a long battle for position, damaging his car and retiring with rear brake failure a few laps later. The stewards later deemed <b>Button</b> <b>to</b> be at fault for the incident.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not clear}} what happens to the Rocket Group {{immediately}} after this: the next time Quatermass is seen on screen (Quatermass, also released internationally as The Quatermass Conclusion and Quatermass IV, 1979) he has long been retired, living in retreat in the Scottish Highlands. He has recently become the guardian of his teenaged granddaughter Hettie after her parents were killed in a road accident in Germany. After Hettie runs away from home, he travels to London in search of her and finds a dystopian world there. Quatermass and the scientist Joe Kapp establish that an alien probe is causing the collapse of society by feeding on the world's youth, and Quatermass forms a plan to drive the intruder away by the detonation of a nuclear bomb. He presses the <b>button</b> <b>to</b> detonate it himself, with Hettie's help, and they are killed in the blast as the planet is saved.|$|E

5|$|Tank is an arcade game {{developed}} by Kee Games, {{a subsidiary of}} Atari, and released in November 1974. It was the only original title not based on an existing Atari property {{developed by}} Kee Games, which was founded to sell clones of Atari games to distributors as a fake competitor prior to the merger of the two companies. In the game, two players drive tanks through a maze viewed from above while attempting to shoot each other and avoid mines, represented by X marks, in a central minefield. Each player controls their tank {{with a pair of}} joysticks, moving them forwards and back to drive, reverse, and steer, and firing shells with a <b>button</b> <b>to</b> attempt to destroy the other tank. The destruction of a tank from a mine or shell earns the opposing player a point, and tanks reappear after being destroyed. The winner is the player with more points when time runs out, with each game typically one or two minutes long.|$|E
5|$|The game {{opens to}} music {{composed}} by Johann Sebastian Bach. Its tiled maze contains 256 screens and is drawn in a 16 by 16 grid. The maze's paths are bordered by tropical flora, populated with attacking enemies and, on its outskirts, surrounded by mountains. Apart from the jungle, the game's maze also includes several lakes. The player swings Sabreman's sabre with {{the push of}} the joystick's fire <b>button</b> <b>to</b> defeat enemies that spawn in random on-screen locations. When the player idles too long in the same screen, an indestructible bushfire appears to pursue Sabreman. Enemies include spiders, scorpions, snakes, bats, indigenous people, sleeping hippos, and a fast wolf (the titular Sabre Wulf). Some enemies are killed, others flee when hit, while the wolf, cave guardian, and bushfire are unaffected by the sabre.|$|E
5|$|The player uses a {{joystick}} and <b>button</b> <b>to</b> input commands, though home versions use a game controller with a directional pad. As the game progresses, visual cues—highlighted {{portions of the}} background or foreground—will appear on the screen to help survive the dangers that occur throughout the stage; more difficult settings omit the visual cues. Depending on {{the location of the}} cue, the player will input one of four directions (up, down, left and right) or an attack (shoot the target with a laser gun). Inputting the correct command will either avoid or neutralize the threats and progress the game, while incorrect choices result in the character's death. Reika dying too many times results in a game over. Specific moments in the game involve Reika stopping time. During these moments, players are presented with a list of three options and have seven seconds to choose the one which will save the character.|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{previous}} models, the handheld has two VGA (0.3-megapixel) digital cameras. The {{first is}} on the internal hinge and points toward the user; the second {{is on the}} outer casing and faces away from the user. The SD card slot is also new, set behind a cover on the right side. While the DS Lite used a switch, the DSi, like the original Nintendo DS, features a <b>button</b> <b>to</b> power on or off. The button has extra functions and unlike the original's power button, it {{is located on the}} bottom-left side of the touchscreen. Brightness and volume controls are on the left side; five brightness settings—one more than on the DS Lite—are available. The headset port is on the bottom.|$|E
5|$|At 1:24a.m., {{one of the}} two men outside {{pushed the}} buzzer near the door and told Abath they were policemen who heard of a {{disturbance}} in the courtyard, and requested to be let inside. Abath knew he should not let uninvited guests inside, but he was unsure on whether the rule applied to police officers. He could see the men and believed them to be police officers based on their uniforms. With his partner on patrol, Abath decided to buzz in the men. When the intruders arrived at the main security desk, one of them told Abath that he looked familiar and there was a default warrant out for his arrest. Abath stepped out from behind his desk, where the only alarm <b>button</b> <b>to</b> alert police could be accessed. He was quickly asked for his ID, ordered to face the wall, and then handcuffed. Abath believed the arrest was a misunderstanding, until he realized he hadn't been frisked before being cuffed, and one officer's mustache was made of wax. The second security guard arrived minutes later and was also handcuffed, after which he asked the intruders why he was being arrested. The thieves explained that they were not being arrested, but rather this was a robbery, and proceeded to take the guards to the museum's basement. They handcuffed the guards to pipes and wrapped duct tape around their hands, feet, and heads.|$|E
5|$|On lap17, Massa and Hamilton {{were given}} drive-through penalties, Massa for colliding with Hamilton and Hamilton for forcing Räikkönen {{off the track}} into turn one. Hamilton took his penalty immediately. Massa made a pit stop for fuel and tyres on the next lap, before coming into the pit lane again on lap 20 to serve his penalty, which dropped him to 14th place, one place ahead of Hamilton. Meanwhile, Kubica and Räikkönen made pit stops on lap17 for tyres and fuel. On the same lap, Kovalainen pulled {{over to the side}} of the track with engine {{problems}} and retired from the race. Alonso made a pit stop on lap18, emerging ahead of Kubica to take the provisional lead, with cars in front still to pit. Trulli, Vettel and Bourdais made pit stops over the following six laps. Fisichella retired from the race with gearbox problems on lap21. Piquet took his first pit stop on lap28, emerging ahead of Bourdais as Alonso opened the gap on Kubica to 7.8seconds. Massa overtook <b>Button</b> <b>to</b> take 12th position one lap later.|$|E
