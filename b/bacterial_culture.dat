25|$|Standard {{treatment}} for most skin or soft tissue abscesses is cutting {{it open and}} drainage. If the diagnosis is uncertain, the wound should be aspirated with a needle, with aspiration of pus confirming the diagnosis and availing for Gram stain and <b>bacterial</b> <b>culture.</b>|$|E
25|$|Cultures are {{not often}} taken or needed as most cases resolve either with time or typical antibiotics.

Viral culture may be appropriate in epidemic case clusters.|$|E
30|$|Positive <b>bacterial</b> <b>cultures</b> do {{not mean}} {{that there is an}} {{infection}} but a low frequency of positive <b>bacterial</b> <b>cultures</b> indicates a decreased risk of infections.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was a study {{concrete}} biocorrosion by iron and sulphur-oxidising bacteria and sulphate-reducing bacteria. Tests were conducted on the ground of two different approaches. In the first approach was studied the individual influence of <b>bacterial</b> <b>cultures.</b> In the second approach was studied the simultaneous influence of the <b>bacterial</b> <b>cultures.</b> We observed a weight loss and the calcium release when samples of concrete {{were exposed to the}} <b>bacterial</b> <b>cultures.</b> Our study suggests that the bioccorosion {{under the influence of the}} reciprocal action of <b>bacterial</b> <b>cultures</b> is more rapid than under the influence of individual <b>bacterial</b> <b>cultures...</b>|$|R

25|$|To produce yogurt, milk {{is first}} heated, usually to about 85°C (185°F), to denature the milk {{proteins}} {{so that they}} do not form curds. After heating, the milk is allowed to cool to about 45°C (113°F). The <b>bacterial</b> <b>culture</b> is mixed in, and a temperature of 45°C (113°F) is maintained for four to twelve hours to allow fermentation.|$|E
25|$|An {{ultrasound}} {{scan of the}} hip can easily demonstrate fluid inside the joint capsule (Fabella sign), although {{this is not always}} present in transient synovitis. However, it cannot reliably distinguish between septic arthritis and transient synovitis. If septic arthritis needs to be ruled out, needle aspiration of the fluid can be performed under ultrasound guidance. In transient synovitis, the joint fluid will be clear. In septic arthritis, there will be pus in the joint, which can be sent for <b>bacterial</b> <b>culture</b> and antibiotic sensitivity testing.|$|E
25|$|Another {{example is}} the work which was done on the {{methylation}} of elements such as sulfur, selenium, tellurium and polonium by living organisms. It {{has been shown that}} bacteria can convert these elements into volatile compounds, it is thought that methylcobalamin (vitamin B12) alkylates these elements to create the dimethyls. It has been shown that a combination of Cobaloxime and inorganic polonium in sterile water forms a volatile polonium compound, while a control experiment which did not contain the cobalt compound did not form the volatile polonium compound. For the sulfur work the isotope 35S was used, while for polonium 207Po was used. In some related work by the addition of 57Co to the <b>bacterial</b> <b>culture,</b> followed by isolation of the cobalamin from the bacteria (and the measurement of the radioactivity of the isolated cobalamin) it was shown that the bacteria convert available cobalt into methylcobalamin.|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY: The {{results of}} testing a {{bacteriophage}} to {{a strain of}} clover nodule bacteria using young (1 day) and old (5 days) <b>bacterial</b> <b>cultures</b> both fit to the hypothesis that phage multiplication can be initiated by single phage particles. As the same phage preparations gave more plaques on solid media and higher pro-portions of liquid cultures in which phage multiplication could be detected, with young than with old <b>bacterial</b> <b>cultures,</b> the fit to the hypothesis is not an evidence that every single phage particle will multiply. It may be so when young <b>bacterial</b> <b>cultures</b> are used, {{although there is no}} positive evidence for it. With older <b>bacterial</b> <b>cultures</b> definitely only a proportion of viable phage particles succeed in starting phage multiplication, the proportion decreasing with the increasing age of <b>bacterial</b> <b>cultures</b> used for testing. The two methods mainly used for quantitative estimation of bacteriophage are plaque counts and serial dilution in liquid media. These methods are satisfactory for estimating relative phage activities in different preparations of the same phage, but they are also used to estimate absolute numbers of phage particles...|$|R

40|$|The uptake of {{chlorine}} by mixed <b>bacterial</b> <b>cultures</b> of varying polysaccharide content was studied in a homogeneous reaction system. The destructive effects of hypochlorite oxidation were noted by measuring decreases in solids concentrations of <b>bacterial</b> <b>cultures</b> and by measuring changes in molecular size distributions of polysaccharides extracted from those cultures. The bactericidal {{effects of a}} given concentration {{of chlorine}} were observed for bacteria with and bacteria without polysaccharide capsules. The uptake of chlorine by <b>bacterial</b> <b>cultures</b> {{was found to be}} significantly faster and greater for cultures grown at a higher carbon-to-nitrogen ratios (larger production of polysaccharides) as opposed to cultures grown at a lower carbon-to-nitrogen ratios, (smaller production of polysaccharides). Greater destruction of solids occurred in <b>bacterial</b> <b>cultures</b> with a higher polysaccharide-to-totalsolids-ratio for equal chlorine concentration applied. The molecular size distribution of bacterial polysaccharide molecules was shifted to a smaller average molecular size by the hypochlorite oxidation reactions. At the chlorine concentration used (50 mg/ 1), no added bactericidal protection was observed in bacteria with larger capsules...|$|R
