Properly designed art activities serve as a potential for emergence and the enhancement of children’s creativities in their early childhood educations. Those children who cannot express their emotions through oral language or other activities are provided with such an opportunity to express themselves and reflect their thoughts, emotions and views on daily experiences. Art experiences foster creative thinking by stimulating imagination. There are {{a great variety of}} techniques to be used in art activities, and a lot of various materials and equipments are available. One of the options for material selection is that of waste materials which help children attain new experiences and ideas. Waste materials include boxes, plastic bottles, pieces of cloth, rolls of paper towels, reels, <b>beads,</b> nutshells, <b>tree</b> shells and leaves with different shapes and sizes. Another advantage of using waste materials is that children learn how to recycle these materials while they gain a sense of texture, shape, weight, wideness and space. Furthermore, this kind of an activity fosters creative thinking and enhances visual and tactual perceptions while the children create unique things. In this study, the status and the importance of the use of waste materials in art activities mentioned in early childhood programs including the points to be born in mind while preparing and using such materials will be discusse...|$|R

5000|$|The {{process of}} {{producing}} an olive wood craft requires labor intensity {{and consists of}} many stages, often involving the work of multiple artisans. Drilling machines are used initially to attain the rough outline of the intended craft. It accounts for 15% of the process, although it eliminates {{some of the most}} difficult and time-consuming aspects of the carving. Next the piece is passed onto a skilled artisan who transforms the rough outline into a finished product by chiseling the details. Finally, the finished item must be sanded down and polished, then coated with olive wax to give the object a [...] "natural shine" [...] and ensure its longevity. Depending on what the particular product is, the process could take up to 45 days. Most professional artisans go through six to seven years of training.Olive wood is used because it is easier to carve than other woods and could be done accurately with simple hand tools. Also, it has a diverse variety of natural color and tonal depth, due to the annual structure. It is also resistant to decay and receptive to a number of surfacing treatments.The olive tree’s wood is widely used in the manufacturing of various artistic, religious, and historical works such as cups, crosses, engraved key chains, Christian magnets, kitchen items, rosary <b>beads,</b> rosary boxes, <b>tree</b> ornaments, flower vases, and wall decorations.|$|R
6000|$|... is {{a matter}} of taste upon which most of us agree with his lordship. This {{peculiar}} breadth of face and person probably result from hard work and good fare, developing adipose tissue. I could not bring myself to admire Gondebiza, the princess royal,-- what is grotesque in one sex becomes unsightly in the other. Fat, thirty, and perhaps once fair, her charms had seen their prime, and the system of circles and circlets which composed her personnel had assumed a tremulous and gravitating tendency. She was habited in the height of Fán fashion. Her body was modestly invested in a thin pattern of tattoo, and a gauze-work of oil and camwood; the rest of the toilette was a dwarf pigeon-tail of fan- palm, like that of the men, and a manner of apron, white <b>beads,</b> and <b>tree</b> bark, greasy and reddened: the latter was tucked under and over the five lines of cowries, which acted as cestus to the portly middle, [...] "big as a budget." [...] The horns of hair, not unlike the rays of light in Michael Angelo's [...] "Moses," [...] were covered with a cap of leaves, and they were balanced behind by a pigtail lashed with brass wire. Her ornaments were sundry necklaces of various beads, large red and white, and small blue and pink porcelains; a leaf, probably by way of amulet, was bound to a string round the upper arm; and wrists and ankles were laden with heavy rings of brass and copper, the parure of the great in Fán- land. The other ballerine were, of course, less brilliantly attired, but all had rings on their arms, legs, and ankles, fingers, and toes. A common decoration was a bunch of seven or eight long ringlets, not unlike the queues de rat, still affected by the old-fashioned Englishwoman; these, however, as in the men, were prolonged to the bosom by strings of alternate red and white beads. Others limited the decoration to two rats' tails depending from the temples, where phrenologists localize our [...] "causality." [...] Many had faces of sufficient piquancy; the figures, though full, wanted firmness, and I noticed only one well-formed bosom. The men wore red feathers, but none carried arms.|$|R
