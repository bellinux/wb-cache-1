The plans to build the line were passed on 18 May 1899 and parliament gave a grant of NOK350,800. In 1903, this was supplemented with NOK22,500. Construction started in late 1901 and was led by Engineer E. Richter. No blasting was done, but difficulties arose <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>large</b> amounts of clay, which contributed to increase costs to NOK800,000.|$|E
5|$|Far Harbor was {{developed}} by Bethesda Game Studios and was announced {{three months after the}} official release of Fallout 4—alongside , , and teasers of other upcoming expansions—in a blog post on February 16, 2016.. The expansion was released on May 19, for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Of the first three expansions, Far Harbor added the largest landmass, and was consequently sold at a higher price. It also added new dungeons (self-contained quest locations), quests, creatures, and other miscellaneous features. The expansion was included in the Fallout 4 season pass, a collection of all the expansion packs. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>large</b> amount of additional content, the price for the pass was increased from US$30 to $50.|$|E

5|$|In {{most cases}} the {{electrons}} are close enough to thermal equilibrium that their temperature is relatively well-defined, even {{when there is a}} significant deviation from a Maxwellian energy distribution function, for example, due to UV radiation, energetic particles, or strong electric fields. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>large</b> difference in mass, the electrons come to thermodynamic equilibrium amongst themselves much faster than they come into equilibrium with the ions or neutral atoms. For this reason, the ion temperature may be very different from (usually lower than) the electron temperature. This is especially common in weakly ionised technological plasmas, where the ions are often near the ambient temperature.|$|E
5|$|Many {{substances}} {{enter the}} sea {{as a result}} of human activities. Combustion products are transported in the air and deposited through precipitation. Agricultural, industrial, and sewage outflows contribute heavy metals, pesticides, PCBs, disinfectants, cleaning products, and other synthetic chemicals. These become concentrated in the surface film and in marine sediment, especially estuarine mud. The result of all this contamination is largely unknown <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>large</b> number of substances involved and the lack of information on their biological effects. The heavy metals of greatest concern are copper, lead, mercury, cadmium, and zinc which may be accumulated by marine invertebrates. They are then passed up the food chain.|$|E

The location was temporarily renovated to mirror an abandoned Federal Emergency Management Agency camp. Michael Riley, the production manager for the episode, contacted the Newnan Police Department to collaborate with producers. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>large</b> size of the filming location, Riley's production company notified surrounding neighborhoods, to avoid inconvenience.|$|E
