25|$|One main {{theme of}} Greek New Comedy is the father–son relationship. For example, in Menander's Dis Exapaton {{there is a}} focus on the {{betrayal}} between age groups and friends. The father-son relationship is very strong and the son remains loyal to the father. The relationship is always a focus, even if it's not the focus of every action taken by the main characters. In Plautus, on the other hand, the focus is still on the relationship between father and son, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>see</b> betrayal between the two men that wasn't seen in Menander. There is {{a focus on the}} proper conduct between a father and son that, apparently, was so important to Roman society at the time of Plautus.|$|E

She said Akane is [...] "uninteresting and forgettable, and her previous role in the show as the moral compass seems to have waned as well". Chris Beveridge from The Fandom Post was more optimistic; he said, [...] "Akane provides a good voice for this, since she’s new to it all and wants to bring nuance to the numbers and the situations, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>see</b> how experience plays out against her at times, but also that she does have something to offer with it".|$|E

Everything {{is compatible with}} relativity now, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>see</b> immediately that the expression for the density is no longer positive definite – the initial values of both [...] and [...] may be freely chosen, and the density may thus become negative, something that is impossible for a legitimate probability density. Thus, we cannot get a simple generalization of the Schrödinger equation under the naive assumption that the wave function is a relativistic scalar, and the equation it satisfies, second order in time.|$|E

2500|$|Rav Nahman bar Rav Hisda expounded on the words, [...] "Then the Lord God formed ( [...] , wa-yitzer) man," [...] in [...] Rav Nahman bar Rav Hisda {{taught that}} the word וַיִּיצֶר, wa-yitzer is written with two yuds (...) to show that God created people with two inclinations (yetzerim), one good and one evil. Rav Nahman bar Isaac demurred, arguing that {{according}} to this logic, animals, of which [...] writes , wa-yitzer with a single yud, should have no evil inclination (yetzer hara), <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>see</b> that they injure, bite, and kick, plainly evincing an evil inclination. Rather, Rabbi Simeon ben Pazzi explained that the two yuds by saying, [...] "Woe is me because of my Creator (yotzri), woe is me because of my evil inclination (yitzri)!" [...] Rabbi Simeon ben Pazzi thus indicated that the two yuds indicate the human condition, where God punishes us for giving in to our evil inclination, but our evil inclination tempts us {{when we try to}} resist. Alternatively, Rabbi Jeremiah ben Eleazar explained that the two yuds reflect that God created two countenances in the first man, one man and one woman, back to back, as [...] says, [...] "Behind and before have You formed me." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Quran at its {{several places}} {{discusses}} {{the issue of}} death. Death is inevitable. No matter how much people try to escape death, it will reach everyone (...) [...] Again, those who deny resurrection and afterlife, and thus challenge God, the Quran challenges them by saying that why these people then do not put back the soul which has reached the throat (of the dying person) {{and is about to}} escape the body? (...) [...] It also says that when death approaches the sinners and disbelievers, and they sense the upcoming chastisement, they pray to Godto go back to life to do some good deeds; but this will never be granted (...) [...] Probably the most-frequently quoted verse of the Quran about death is: [...] "Every soul shall taste death, and only on the Day of Judgment will you be paid your full recompense." [...] At another place, the Quran urges mankind: [...] "And die not except in a state of Islam" [...] (...) because [...] "Truly, the religion in the sight of Allah is Islam" [...] (...) [...] Other verses related with this issue are: [...] "He (Allah) who created death and life, so that He may test you as to which of you is better in deeds. And He is the All-Mighty, the Most-Forgiving" [...] (...) [...] "Certainly, they see it (resurrection) as distant, <b>but</b> <b>We</b> <b>see</b> it as near" [...] (...) [...]|$|E
