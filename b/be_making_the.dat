5|$|In {{the weeks}} leading up to the game, media {{coverage}} focused on the achievements of the Buffalo Bulls. Buffalo had been one of the least-successful programs in college football from their transition to Division I-A in 1999 to 2006, during which they had a cumulative record of 12–79. In 2008, the Bulls had their first winning season since 1996, won five games in a row for the first time since 1986, beat a ranked team for the first time in program history with their upset victory over Ball State in the MAC Championship Game, and would <b>be</b> <b>making</b> <b>the</b> first bowl appearance in school history. The turnaround of the Buffalo program brought acclaim to Bulls head coach Turner Gill, who had taken over the team in 2007.|$|E

25|$|As well {{as being}} aware of {{cryptographic}} history, cryptographic algorithm and system designers must also sensibly consider probable future developments while working on their designs. For instance, continuous improvements in computer processing power have increased the scope of brute-force attacks, so when specifying key lengths, the required key lengths are similarly advancing. The potential effects of quantum computing are already being considered by some cryptographic system designers developing post-quantum cryptography; the announced imminence of small implementations of these machines may <b>be</b> <b>making</b> <b>the</b> need for this preemptive caution rather more than merely speculative.|$|E

25|$|On June 6, 2005, Steve Jobs {{announced}} in his keynote {{address at the}} annual Apple Worldwide Developers Conference that Apple would <b>be</b> <b>making</b> <b>the</b> transition from PowerPC to Intel processors over the following two years, and that Mac OS X would support both platforms during the transition. Jobs also confirmed rumors that Apple had versions of Mac OS X running on Intel processors {{for most of its}} developmental life. Intel-based Macs would run a new recompiled version of OS X along with Rosetta, a binary translation layer which enables software compiled for PowerPC Mac OS X to run on Intel Mac OS X machines. The system was included with Mac OS X versions up to version 10.6.8. Apple dropped support for Classic mode on the new Intel Macs. Third party emulation software such as Mini vMac, Basilisk II and SheepShaver provided support for some early versions of Mac OS. A new version of Xcode and the underlying command-line compilers supported building universal binaries that would run on either architecture.|$|E

500|$|Although Etty was {{somewhat}} disappointed by Rome, comparing {{the architecture of}} St. Peter's unfavourably with that of St. Paul's, he was highly impressed with Michelangelo's [...] "almost Venetian" [...] use of colour in the Sistine Chapel. He also met with Antonio Canova, to whom he had been recommended by Lawrence, shortly before Canova's death. Rome {{was at the time}} suffering badly from malaria, and after two weeks Etty decided to leave for Naples. Evans had contracted malaria and decided to stay in Rome, and so Etty travelled to Naples alone and returned to Rome in the company of actor William Macready, who happened to <b>be</b> <b>making</b> <b>the</b> same journey, and with whom he remained a good friend {{for the rest of his}} life. On his return to Rome, Etty toured the city's museums, making copies of various artworks, particularly those of the Venetian artists such as Titian and Veronese whom he so admired.|$|E

500|$|Most of the {{components}} for Little Boy left San Francisco on the cruiser [...] on 16 July and arrived on Tinian on 26 July. Four days later the ship was sunk by a Japanese submarine. The remaining components, which included six uranium-235 rings, were delivered by three C-54 Skymasters of the 509th Group's 320th Troop Carrier Squadron. Two Fat Man assemblies travelled to Tinian in specially modified 509th Composite Group B-29s. The first plutonium core went in a special C-54. A joint targeting committee of the Manhattan District and USAAF was established to determine which cities in Japan should be targets, and recommended Kokura, Hiroshima, Niigata, and Kyoto. At this point, Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson intervened, announcing that he would <b>be</b> <b>making</b> <b>the</b> targeting decision, {{and that he would}} not authorize the bombing of Kyoto on the grounds of its historical and religious significance. Groves therefore asked Arnold to remove Kyoto not just from the list of nuclear targets, but from targets for conventional bombing as well. One of Kyoto's substitutes was Nagasaki.|$|E
500|$|Groves {{met with}} the Chief of United States Army Air Forces, General Henry H. Arnold, in March 1944 to discuss the {{delivery}} of the finished bombs to their targets. Groves was hoping that the Boeing B-29 Superfortress {{would be able to}} carry the finished bombs. The 509th Composite Group was duly activated on 17 December 1944 at Wendover Army Air Field, Utah, under the command of Colonel Paul W. Tibbets. A joint Manhattan District – USAAF targeting committee was established to determine which cities in Japan should be targets; it recommended Kokura, Hiroshima, Niigata and Kyoto. At this point, Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson intervened, announcing that he would <b>be</b> <b>making</b> <b>the</b> targeting decision, and that he would not authorize the bombing of Kyoto. Groves attempted to get him to change his mind several times and Stimson refused every time. [...] Kyoto had been the capital of Japan for centuries, and was of great cultural and religious significance. [...] In the end, Groves asked Arnold to remove Kyoto not just from the list of nuclear targets, but from targets for conventional bombing as well. Nagasaki was substituted for Kyoto as a target.|$|E
500|$|In 2016, Disclosure had {{developed}} their skills of writing songs while on tour, {{but did not}} have time to produce enough material for a full-length album. Regardless, the duo wanted to release a record for the summer, reasoning that they felt [...] "strange" [...] not issuing any material to the public in that season. Therefore, they created and distributed a three-track [...] "clubby" [...] extended play that went [...] "back to the start." [...] Moog for Love was Disclosure's first record not to feature writing contributions from Jimmy Napes, which Howard said also [...] "feels quite strange." [...] With the EP, Disclosure wanted to use more different track development formulas from what they used for making their previous records, Settle (2013) and Caracal (2015), reasoning that they would <b>be</b> <b>making</b> <b>the</b> same music over and over again if they kept making tracks the same way. However, they still had made songs in one similar way they did for Settle, in that there was some material only one of the members would work on, and after the song was finished, both members of the duo would decide if the track was ready for release and inclusion on the album.|$|E

500|$|Throughout the 1980s, George Lucas remarked he had {{no desire}} to return to Star Wars and had unofficially {{canceled}} his sequel trilogy by the time of Return of the Jedi. Because Lucas had developed most of the backstory, the idea of prequels continued to fascinate him. In the early 1990s, Star Wars saw a resurgence in popularity in the wake of Dark Horse's comic line and Timothy Zahn's trilogy of novels. Lucas saw there was still a large audience for his idea of a prequel trilogy and with the development of special effects generated with computer-generated imagery (CGI), Lucas considered returning to his saga and directing the film. In 1993, it was announced in Variety and other sources that he would <b>be</b> <b>making</b> <b>the</b> prequels. Lucas began outlining the story; Anakin Skywalker rather than Obi-Wan Kenobi would be the main protagonist and the series would be a tragedy examining Darth Vader's origins. Lucas also began to change the prequels' timeline relative to the original series, [...] "filling-in" [...] the history, backstory, existing parallel or tangential to the originals and beginning a long story that started with Anakin's childhood and ended with his death. This was the final step toward turning the franchise into a saga.|$|E
500|$|According to MTV's Monique Steele, Kim Possible is [...] "all {{about how}} girls kick butt"; Kim {{constantly}} rescues Ron, saving him from peril {{on numerous occasions}} throughout the series. Writing for Wewomen.com, Carla Cain Walther observed that the series [...] "scoffed at the 'damsel in distress' trope used in action films" [...] by having Kim save Ron [...] "using her ingenuity and strength", reinforcing the idea that girls are capable of helping themselves. Identifying Kim as a postfeminist heroine because she is intelligent {{in addition to being}} [...] "shaped like Barbie" [...] and having a male assistant similar to female executives, The New York Times Julie Salamon joked that [...] "Kim's job seems to <b>be</b> <b>making</b> <b>the</b> world safe for cheerleaders again, following the path forged by Reese Witherspoon in Legally Blonde on behalf of sorority girls." [...] Tor.com's Sarah Gailey observed that while Shego proudly spends much of her time lounging poolside and deciding what she does and does not want to do, Kim is forced [...] "to leap into action regardless of whether she's tired or sad or sick or, heaven forbid, too busy". Bustles Sarah Freymiller wrote that [...] "Kim offers a model for femininity that both bolsters and works against the typical 'high school cheerleader' stereotype", citing cheerleading as an outlet the character chooses willingly. Kim is not a tomboy; Julia Pugachevsky of BuzzFeed credits the series with [...] "show that you could be traditionally feminine and strong at the same time." [...] Conversely, Geek Chic: Smart Women in Popular Culture author S. Inness argued that Kim Possible reinforces that [...] "girls can do anything they choose" [...] but must look a certain way in order to do so since its female character participate in consumerism and normative femininity that its male characters do not, such as shopping and spending much time on their appearance. Inness also felt that show's feminist potential is compromised by the fact that Kim mostly surrounds herself with male companions as opposed to female, [...] "contradict the messages of female solidarity".|$|E
