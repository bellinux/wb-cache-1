40|$|The {{importance}} of efficient <b>bankruptcy</b> <b>procedures</b> is widely recognized and the acute recent economic crisis has emphasized the noteworthiness of this topic, which international literature has analysed in several ways, focusing the attention on different variables, such as accessibility of <b>bankruptcy</b> <b>procedures,</b> their costs and duration, incentives and/or penalties for debtor and creditors {{related to the}} onset of a procedure, and so on. The aim of {{the paper is the}} analysis of the Italian <b>bankruptcy</b> <b>procedures</b> both in an ex post and in ex ante perspective. The ex post perspective is based on official statistical data annually published by the ISTAT (the Italian Office of Statistics), investigating costs of <b>bankruptcy</b> <b>procedures,</b> average ratio of claims reimbursed to the creditors and duration of <b>bankruptcy</b> <b>procedures.</b> The period investigated is 2000 - 2007. The ex ante perspective is based on two non-paired samples of failed and non-failed firms, investigating their financial statements of 2003 - 2008. The main expected result is that the Italian <b>bankruptcy</b> <b>procedures</b> are complex and not accessible enough...|$|R

Section III focuses on the relative efficacy of the 'reorganisation' option in comparison with the 'liquidation' option of the <b>bankruptcy</b> <b>procedures.</b> Section IV highlights the lessons that East European transitional economies may learn from the experience of market economies, drawing attention to a number of important areas of concern in any discussion of the design and implementation of <b>bankruptcy</b> <b>procedures.</b> Eastern Europe, transition, bankrupcy, reorganisation, liquidation...|$|R

40|$|This article uses a game theoretic {{model of}} Chapter 11 {{bankruptcy}} and out-of-court debt restructuring {{to evaluate the}} economic efficiency of U. S. <b>bankruptcy</b> <b>procedures.</b> The model assumes {{that there are two}} types of failing firms: economically inefficient firms that should liquidate and economically efficient firms that should be saved. From an efficiency standpoint, the goal of corporate <b>bankruptcy</b> <b>procedures</b> is to liquidate the former under Chapter 7 and save the latter by reorganization under Chapter 11 -that is, to filter out inefficient firms. However, it is difficult to identify which failing firms are inefficient, so <b>bankruptcy</b> <b>procedures</b> may operate with error. The model shows that a pooling equilibrium may occur in which both efficient and inefficient failing firms reorganize under Chapter 11. Adding restructuring as a bankruptcy alternative appears to make things worse, since the transactions cost savings in restructuring compared to reorganization makes the inefficient equilibrium more likely to occur...|$|R
