In such a condition, ICs are completely at the mercy of their environment as to what stressful voltage surges they may see. Most often the harmful voltage surges come from electrostatic discharge, or, as more commonly referenced, ESD. This is a single, fast, high current transfer of electrostatic charge resulting from one of two conditions. These conditions are: 1. Direct contact transfer between two objects at different potentials (sometimes called contact discharge) 2. A high electrostatic field between two objects when they are in close proximity (sometimes called air discharge) The prime sources of static electricity are mostly insulators and are typically synthetic materials, e. g., vinyl or plastic work surfaces, insulated shoes, finished wood chairs, Scotch tape, <b>bubble</b> <b>pack,</b> soldering irons with ungrounded tips, etc. Voltage levels generated by these sources can be extremely high since their charge is not readily distributed over their surfaces or conducted to other objects.

The objective of the present thesis was mainly to study the fluid dynamics of semi batch <b>packed</b> <b>bubble</b> columns at both atmospheric and pressurized conditions. Some mass transfer studies have also been performed in a non-isothermal <b>bubble</b> column without <b>packing.</b> The study shows an upward liquid flow in the centre of a semi batch <b>packed</b> <b>bubble</b> column and a downward flow along the wall. As a result of this the one-dimensional dispersion model does not give a good description of the conditions inside the bed. It was also observed that the change in flow regime from bubble flow to pulsation flow affects the hydrodynamics. The pulses increases the radial dispersion and as a consequence, a minimum value of the dispersion coefficient was observed at the transition point. Also the frictional pressure drop is affected, a maximum point is observed in the transition region. The pressure influence both the gas holdup and the one dimensional dispersion coefficient in a <b>packed</b> <b>bubble</b> column. The gas holdup and the dispersion coefficient increases at increasing pressure. LDA measurements demonstrate that the axial time-averaged liquid velocity is lower in <b>packed</b> <b>bubble</b> columns compared to published results for <b>bubble</b> columns without <b>packing.</b> The time averaged liquid velocity and the RMS value of the liquid depends on the packing size.

40|$|International audienceIn aqueous foams, the {{diffusive}} {{gas transfer}} among neighboring bubbles drives a coarsening process which {{is accompanied by}} intermittent rearrangements of the structure.

We present in detail two independent techniques for analyzing the light scattering data, from which we extract the rearrangement duration. Our results show that interfacial rheology has a major impact on this duration. In the case of low interfacial rigidity, the rearrangements strongly slow down as the pressure is decreased close to the value zero where the <b>bubble</b> <b>packing</b> unjams. In contrast, if the interfaces are rigid, rearrangement durations are independent of the confinement pressure in the same investigated range.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a computational method for quadrilateral meshing of a thin, or narrow, two-dimensional domain for {{finite element analysis}}. The proposed method creates a well-shaped single-layered, multi-layered, or partially multi-layered quadrilateral mesh. Element sizes can be uniform or graded. A high quality, layered quadrilateral mesh is often required for finite element analysis of a narrow two-dimensional domain with a large deformation {{such as in the}} analysis of rubber deformation or sheet metal forming. Fully automated quadrilateral meshing is performed in two stages: (1) extraction of the skeleton of a given domain by discrete chordal axis transformation, and (2) discretization of the chordal axis into a set of line segments and conversion of each of the line segments to a single quadrilateral element or multiple layers of quadrilateral elements. In each step a physically-based computational method called <b>bubble</b> <b>packing</b> is applied to discretize a curve into a set of line segments of specified sizes. Experiments show that the accuracy of a large-deformation FEM analysis can be significantly improved by using a well-shaped quadrilateral mesh created by the proposed method. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a new method for range estimation using low-cost infrared sensors. The intensity data obtained with infrared sensors depends highly {{on the surface}} properties and {{the configuration of the}} sensors and the surface. Therefore, in many of the related studies, either the properties of the surface are determined first or certain assumptions about the surface are made in order to calculate the distance and the orientation of the surface relative to the sensors.

The overall absolute mean error in the range estimates has been calculated as 0. 21 cm in the range from 12. 5 to 45 cm.

This paper presents a computational method for automatically generating aesthetic patterns based on minimal user input. The system produces anisotropic geometric feature patterns in three-steps: (1) model preparation, (2) feature interpolation via a tensor field and <b>bubble</b> <b>packing,</b> and (3) pattern generation on a selected surface using standard Boolean operations and CAD engine primitives (e. g., points, planes, and ellipses). The user inputs {{a small number of}} geometric features called “seed features” with the desired size and orientation in preferred locations within the target area. The tool generates the location, anisotropic size, and orientation of geometric features while preserving the target-area boundaries. These geometric seed features are then transformed into tensors and used as boundary conditions to generate a Riemannian metric tensor field that represents the anisotropic attributes of the features. A form of the Laplace's heat equation is used to produce the field over the target domain which is subject to the specified boundary conditions. The structure and the field described by Laplace's equation determines the geometric features and increases them whenever this field has the greater value. Repeated geometric patterns are then generated on a free-form curved surface by packing elliptical cells. This process was developed as an add-on for a commercial CAD package. All the features can be edited further within the CAD software if the user desires. In this paper we demonstrate the application of the proposed automated patterning method to additively manufactured personal products...|$|R
