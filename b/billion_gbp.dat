25|$|The UK {{was already}} a major {{supplier}} of arms to Saudi Arabia prior to Al Yamamah. In 1964 The British Aircraft Corporation conducted demonstration flights of their Lightning in Riyadh and in 1965 Saudi Arabia signed a letter of intent for the supply of Lightning and Strikemaster aircraft as well as Thunderbird surface to air missiles. The main contract was signed in 1966 for 40 Lightnings and 25 Strikemasters (eventually raised to 40). In 1973 the Saudi government {{signed an agreement with}} the British government which specified BAC as the contractor for all parts of the defence system (AEI was previously contracted to supply the radar equipment and Airwork Services provided servicing and training).

50|$|The {{nature of}} the auctions was {{designed}} to increase competitive pressure on bidders by offering fewer licenses {{than the number of}} operators likely to bid and in some cases using sealed bid auctions. This put the telephone operators in a difficult position, because if they lost the auction they were out of the next technological phase of the business. They therefore took risks and made high bids, incurring large debt. In the UK auctions raised £22.5 <b>billion</b> (<b>GBP)</b> and around £30 <b>billion</b> (<b>GBP)</b> in Germany. Some estimate the damage caused by the auctions of telecom spectrum (previously administration fees were charged for spectrum usage --- with public service conditions such as emergency cover bundled with the usage certificates --- with the raison d'être being public service provision and that profits from the companies proving the service would be taxable) to be as high as 3 trillion dollars worldwide.|$|E

40|$|The {{persistence}} of uncontested seats and one-party dominated councils {{at the local}} level is a cause for concern across England in terms of quality of public services, value for money, and government responsiveness to citizen needs. One particular high-risk area is the integrity of government contracting when controls of corruption are weak. Hence, this report investigates the impact of weak electoral accountability on corruption in public pro-curement, explored {{at the local level}} in England. It uses administrative data on electoral outcomes as well as on public procurement tendering procedures from 2009 - 2013. It employs an innovative measure of corruption risks in public procurement capturing a set of ‘red flags ’ signalling the likely steering of government contracts to a favoured bidder. Based on the comparison of matching contracts, the findings suggest that weak elector-al accountability may lead to substantially higher corruption risks and lower price savings in English local councils. Councils of weak electoral accountability are roughly 50 % higher corruption risk than their competitive counterparts which also coincides with foregone savings of 1 - 4 % of contract value. The foregone savings by councils with weak electoral accountability roughly amount to 2. 6 <b>billion</b> <b>GBP</b> annually. Due to incomplete data and methodological challenges, further work is needed to establish the full causal effect of weak electoral accountability on procurement corruption risks...|$|E
40|$|The {{offshore}} {{oil and gas}} industry has created significant wealth for the UK economy; approximately 250 billion Great British Pounds (GBP) since oil was discovered under the United Kingdom Continental Shelf (UKCS) of which approximately 70 <b>billion</b> <b>GBP</b> was paid in tax and royalties to the UK government. The industry currently employs about 35, 000 individuals directly and supports many more jobs indirectly. In short, it is a very critical industry to the UK economy. But for all its contribution, there is a dearth of social science and management research into the how the offshore industry is managed. This thesis reports the background and findings of an investigation into the first level of the platform production management team and examines this role in terms of the personal characteristics and man-management skills required within this working environment. This thesis was the first study that attempted to investigate the non-technical characteristics of high performing supervisors. It examined the question of what makes an effective supervisor in terms of biodata, personality, job satisfaction and perceptions of the work environment. The transformational model of Bass and Avolio (1990) was also adapted to assess leadership style. A specially designed semistructured questionnaire was developed. The research sample comprised of one hundred first line supervisors (operators and contractors), their subordinates and their superiors on three North Sea platforms. It was hypothesised that effective offshore first line supervisors would have a distinct supervisory style compared to less effective ones. Other aims included assessing the differences between supervisors working on the UKCS and those on the Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS); and between supervisors working for contracting companies as opposed to operating companies. The key contributions of the thesis were in the following four areas; (i) the summary data that described the offshore first line supervisors, (ii) the findings from standard instruments, particularly the Bass leadership instrument, identified that supervisory effectiveness was dependent on the platform membership of the supervisor, (iii) the qualitative findings from the supervisory decision making vignettes and finally (iv) the platform differences that were elicited from both within the UK sector and between the North Sea sectors. For example, on one UK platform, UKI, the more effective supervisor displayed a more transactional leadership style, namely taking an active role in enforcing workplace standards. There was some evidence to suggest that dimensions of a transformational leadership style such as motivating subordinates through pep talks and depicting visions of a better workplace were positively correlated with performance. These findings were broadly consistent with the results of previous research. In contrast, the second UK platform, UK 2, produced a different finding. This was surprising given the numerous physical and organisational characteristics that these two platforms had in common. The Norwegian platform sample was small (n= 19) and therefore correlational results were largely exploratory. Further differences were revealed through multi-variate analyses between all three platforms based on leadership, job satisfaction and biodata variables. This implies that `effectiveness' may be dependent on the platform membership of the supervisor. As an alternative explanation, these findings may suggest that the standard instruments and appraisal measures were not sensitive enough to differentiate performance within this work environment. The Bass and Avolio (1990) leadership model, in particular, produced contradictory findings and its usefulness in this context remains questionable. Qualitative evidence from the total sample of effective supervisory behaviours, using a behavioural event interview method, supported the quantitative findings from UK 1 but broadly disagreed with the findings from UK 2. Measuring supervisors performance without reference to objective indices remains a weakness for this style of research. The impact of these findings is discussed in the context of both practical recommendations for recruitment, selection and development for the supervisory population and future research into management research in the {{offshore oil}} and gas industry...|$|E
