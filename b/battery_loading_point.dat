40|$|Utilisation of pure {{electric}} vehicles (EV) enables a step change in vehicle efficiency when compared to those powered by an internal combustion engine. Cenex, the UK's Centre of Excellence for Low Carbon and Fuel Cell technologies specialises in understanding the real-world and whole-vehicle performance of low carbon vehicles and {{in collaboration with the}} University of Lincoln and Loughborough University has undertaken chassis dynamometer testing of an OEM electric passenger car. This paper presents the methodology and results of laboratory testing that studied the whole vehicle efficiency and energy consumption over a range of vehicle speed and <b>battery</b> <b>load</b> <b>points</b> and reports on the charging and battery efficiency of the EV during the test period to present a total plug-to-wheel EV efficiency when operated over both regulated and real-world drive cycles.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{introduces}} {{a method for}} designing a stand-alone photovoltaic system to improve the <b>load</b> <b>point</b> reliability, extend the operation life, and minimize the design cost. This approach examines the impacts of solar panel sizes, tilt angles and <b>battery</b> volumes toward <b>load</b> <b>point</b> reliability, {{as well as the}} expected system life, by using real insolation data in a given location and random load burdens. The reliability evaluation incorporating solar insolation variations and <b>load</b> <b>point</b> uncertainty is performed. Life evaluation of battery is included in this paper with consideration of the battery State of Charge (SoC) history. The Economical analysis to examine the investment cost, potential reliability cost and benefit is also studied. An application selecting Lincoln, Nebraska as the site is utilized to illustrate proposed methods. This work is valuable for practical stand-alone photovoltaic system sizing designs wit...|$|R

Throughout the whole group of girls, positive correlations between attitude parameters in the frontal plane and the postural reactions were observed: The angle of primary curvature/anteroposterior speed with which eyes closed, angle of primary curvature /average speed with which eyes closed, angle of primary curvature /path length eyes closed, absolute value shoulders angle line/mean <b>loading</b> <b>point</b> X eyes closed, absolute value pelvic inclination angle/lateral speed eyes closed.

40|$|As {{electric}} vehicles (EVs) {{become more and}} more popular, there also has to exist an appropriate infrastructure of <b>battery</b> <b>loading</b> stations to allow for a widespread usage. Especially long distance routes are still not covered, due to the short cruising range of EVs. In this thesis we develop an algorithm for placing such stations so that every shortest path can be driven without running out of energy, assuming an adjustable initial and maximum battery charge. Considering an initial roll-out of <b>battery</b> <b>loading</b> stations, we aim at placing as few as possible, while still meeting the above constraint. Therefore, we rely on a theoretical hitting set formulation of the problem to be able to precisely analyze and evaluate it, followed by a - at first - naive algorithm which is then improved {{in the course of the}} thesis. A dual problem is introduced to allow a computation of instance-based bounds. Finally we evaluate our implementation practically in regard to memory usage, runtime and quality of the results and furthermore theoretically prove general upper bounds. The final algorithm is capable of computing a <b>battery</b> <b>loading</b> station positioning on the graph of Germany in less than one day on our testing machine, with evidentially good quality...|$|R

At <b>loading</b> <b>point</b> E, a V-shaped shear band has been preliminarily formed. Compared with the velocity variation, the interface cohesion is weaker during the pre-peak stress fluctuation stage, so the shear strain in coal body is changed more intensely {{in the middle of the}} interface and the deformation velocity of monitoring points present greatly negative fluctuation. When <b>loading</b> to <b>point</b> F, the inverted V-shaped shear bands evolved from the middle of the interface exhibit evidently and the restrictions on end face disappear. When <b>loading</b> to <b>point</b> G at post-peak stage, two local shear zones appear in the both sides of the interface and the shear bands become thin due to the interface effect.

30|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{challenges}} with both EGR and Wetpac technologies is that NOx reduction is lower at low loads, i.e. an increased EGR rate or water volume is needed at low loads to reach the cycle average. Another challenge is the increased need for engine flexibility, since NOx reduction is different at different loads and because fuel consumption should always be minimized in the most important operating areas. Changes in inlet valve timing (VIC) and fuel injection parameters (Common Rail or corresponding system) are needed for this, and could be used to optimize the different <b>load</b> <b>points</b> so that the 50 and 75  % <b>load</b> <b>points</b> are on the cycle limit value to get the best fuel consumption, whilst the 25  % <b>load</b> <b>point</b> NOx is on the maximum accepted, i.e. 1.5 *cycle average, and the 100  % <b>load</b> <b>point</b> where SFOC is not important, should have NOx as low as necessary to reach the cycle value.|$|R

40|$|Reliability cost/worth {{assessment}} {{is becoming an}} important aspect of power system planning and operation as it provides an opportunity to compare the worth of electric service reliability with the cost of providing that reliability, The interruption costs incurred by the customers (CIC) due to power supply interruptions can be used as surrogates in the reliability worth assessment of an electric power system. In order to determine an optimal and reasonable level of customer service, reliability cost/worth can be performed by calculating the costs associated with different system configurations and assessing the corresponding reliability worth.. The main objective of this research was to examine the. ability to perform reliability worth assessment by applying appropriate customer damage functions (CDF) at different <b>load</b> <b>points</b> in a distribution system. The reliability worth assessment was performed by linking distribution system predictive reliability indices with the customer interruption costs associated With power supply interruptions at the various <b>load</b> <b>points.</b> This thesis is concerned with the sensitivity analysis of the expected customer outage cost (ECOST) using both <b>load</b> <b>point</b> customer damage functions (LPCDF) and sector customer damage functions (SCDF). This thesis also illustrates the impact on the ECOST of selected distribution system parameters using both LPCDF and SCDF. Customer damage functions utilized in the evaluation of ECOST can vary substantially due to the composition of the customers at the different <b>load</b> <b>points</b> in the system. Thel. sensitivity studies show that the ECOST is highly dependent on the actual customer composition. This thesis also illustrates the application of relevant customer damage functions to evaluate the ECOST on an actual distribution system feeder located in the City of Saskatoon. The evaluated ECOST using representative <b>load</b> <b>point</b> customer damage functions at each individual <b>load</b> <b>point</b> provides the most realistic estimate of the expected customer cost This thesis illustrates that <b>load</b> <b>point</b> customer damage functions are important parameters in the evaluation of the ECOST in an actual distribution system...|$|R
