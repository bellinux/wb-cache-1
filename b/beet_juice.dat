The cake and its original recipe are well known in the United States from New York City's famous Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, which has dubbed the confection Waldorf-Astoria cake. However, it is widely considered a Southern recipe. Traditionally, red velvet cake is iced with a French-style butter roux icing (also called ermine icing), which is very light and fluffy, but time-consuming to prepare.

40|$|Abstract. Carrots and {{red beet}} were {{evaluated}} {{as a potential}} substrate {{for the production of}} lactic acid fermented juices by Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium sp. Both strains were found capable to grow on the vegetable juices, but some differences between the dynamics of the processes, dependent not only by the culture but by the sort of the raw material, had as consequence the production of the final products with different stability degrees. The pH value of the carrot juices was decreased from an initial value by 6. 45 to below 4. 3 after 48 hours of lactic acid fermentation with Bifidobacterium sp., respectively to 3. 84 after 24 hours when Lactobacillus acidophilus was inoculated. The last strain has produced a significant increase of the titrable acidity, the fermented carrot juices containing 0. 7 % acids (expressed as lactic acid). In the case of the fermentation of the red <b>beet</b> <b>juices</b> it is also recommended the strain of Lactobacillus acidophilus, because the pH value decrease with 2 units in 24 hours.

40|$|The name dextran {{was given}} by Scheibler (1) to the mucous {{fermentation}} products present in <b>beet</b> <b>juices.</b> He found that this substance on hydrolysis yielded considerable quantities of glucose and when oxidized with nitric acid gave oxalic acid. He was led to regard it as an anhydride of glucose. Many other descriptions of this and similar substances are given in literature, but at present it is generally accepted that {{the production of the}} gum is due to the action of bacteria on rich sugar media. Depending on the kind of sugar and the type of organism used, different polysaccharides are obtained. In the case of gum-producing bacteria, large amounts of polysaccharides are produced because the nutrient medium used is rich in sugar. Boas (2) recommended a culture medium containing from 5 to 10 per cent of carbohydrate. According to the commonly accepted theory, it is assumed that most, if not all, carbohydratedecomposing microorganisms possess synthesizing properties which, during the early stages of their development give rise under favorable conditions to the condensation of hexoses and other simple sugars to complex polysaccharides. In cases in which these synthetic polysaccharides readily imbibe water, a colloid, i. e., a mucus, is formed. The most important of the bacteria capable of producing dextran from saccharose is Leuconostoc mesenterioides. The method of preparation, purification and structure of the dextran produced by this organism will be found described in forthcoming papers (3). The material used in our experiments was kindly supplied by Prof. Hibbert and shown by analysis to be nitrogen- and ash-free.

40|$|Summary. Different {{methods of}} obtaining the product given were tested and {{rational}} modes {{for the proposed}} technology were chosen {{in the development of}} technology for production of sugar <b>beet</b> concentrated <b>juice.</b> The sugar <b>beet</b> concentrated <b>juice</b> is obtained as follows: sugar beets are washed in the continuous action washing machine, checked, rotten or spoiled beets are removed from the cycle, and insufficiently treated roots are directed to re-washing. Then with the help of thermal processing the sugar beet is peeled. The peeled roots are white. They are crushed to the 3 - 4 mm particles size, mixed with acidified to pH 3, 5 - 4, 0 water (hydromodule 1 - 1. 2), then the resulting mass is heated to 80 0 C temperature. The use of acidified water is necessary to prevent the darkening initiation. Then the received sugar beet mass is fed to pressing to obtain its juice. The pressed juice depending on the beet source contains 12 % of DS and 1. 5 - 3 % reducing substances (RS) of the total mass of dry substances. The juice concentration is under the suction of 0. 008 MPa at the boiling temperature of up to 60 0 C to the content of 70 % DS. Due to the delicate mode, the sugars breakdown is less intensive, the finished product is of good quality. At the simultaneous concentration with steam the volatile substances with a specific smell are removed, that improves the juice taste and smell. Under this mode, the sugar hydrolysis is intensive, there is a growth reducing substances up to 20 %, the color is increased to 40 % density.

50|$|An {{equivalent}} golden syrup product may be {{made from}} beet sugar by processing the clarified, partially evaporated <b>beet</b> <b>juice</b> to break down (invert) most of the disaccharide sucrose into its constituents monosaccharides glucose and fructose. In this process none of the sucrose is ever crystallized from the <b>beet</b> <b>juice.</b> Inversion may be done by acid hydrolysis or by adding an enzyme, invertase. This produces a free flowing (invert) syrup that will not crystallize. Typically in acid hydrolysis, the disaccharides are split by hydrochloric acid, resulting in a solution which is acidic; neutrality is restored {{by the addition of}} lye, which is sodium hydroxide. As a result, syrup made by this method contains some common salt, sodium chloride.|$|E

40|$|Bioethanol fermentations expose yeasts to a new, {{complex and}} {{challenging}} fermentation medium with specific inhibitors and sugar mixtures {{depending on the}} type of carbon source. It is, therefore, suggested that the natural diversity of yeasts should be further exploited in order to find yeasts with good ethanol yield in stressed fermentation media. In this study, we screened more than 50 yeast isolates of which we selected five isolates with promising features. The species Candida bombi, Wickerhamomyces anomalus and Torulaspora delbrueckii showed better osmo- and hydroxymethylfurfural tolerance than Saccharomyces cerevisiae. However, S. cerevisiae isolates had the highest ethanol yield in fermentation experiments mimicking high gravity fermentations (25 Â % glucose) and artificial lignocellulose hydrolysates (with a myriad of inhibitors).

40|$|Lignocellulosic biomass has {{received}} increasing attention as carbon source for microbial fermentations. Pretreatment of the biomass {{is needed to}} liberate sugars with intense treatments yielding higher sugar concentrations (which are economically preferred). However, these intense treatments also result {{in the formation of}} several undesired compounds in concentrations which may reduce the fermentation efficiency. The main inhibitors are solutes (osmostress), product stress (e. g. ethanol, lactic acid, dicarboxylic acid, [...] .), furans (5 -hydroxymethylfurfural, furfural), weak acids (acetic acid, levulinic acid, formic acid) and phenolic and aromatic compounds originating from the lignin fraction (e. g. vanillin). Microorganisms are therefore exposed to a new, challenging and diverse fermentation medium due to the large diversity of lignocellulosic biomass sources and hydrolysis conditions. It is therefore required to align the hydrolysate with a microorganism with the best characteristics in terms of tolerance to inhibitors and sugar consumption profile. In this study, we screened more than 50 yeast isolates isolated from plant nectar and <b>beet</b> sugar thick <b>juice</b> for tolerance to weak acids, furans, osmostress and ethanol and compared it with an industrially used S. cerevisiae strain and natural strain (isolated from oak). Non-Saccharomyces yeasts showed better osmotolerance than S. cerevisiae. The species Candida bombi, Wickerhamomyces anomalus and Torulaspora delbrueckii also showed better hydroxymethylfurfural tolerance than S. cerevisiae. T. delbrueckii and Pichia kudriavzevii showed better furfural tolerance. Growth on 2 % xylose as sole carbon source was better for non-Saccharomyces yeasts, with W. anomalus reaching more than 20 % growth relative to 2 % glucose. As a case study, we performed bioethanol fermentations mimicking high gravity fermentations (25 % glucose) and artificial lignocellulose hydrolysates (with a myriad of inhibitors) using 5 selected isolates.
