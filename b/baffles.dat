25|$|Baffle Design: <b>baffles</b> {{are used}} in shell and tube heat {{exchangers}} to direct fluid across the tube bundle. They run perpendicularly to the shell and hold the bundle, preventing the tubes from sagging over a long length. They can also prevent the tubes from vibrating. The {{most common type of}} baffle is the segmental baffle. The semicircular segmental <b>baffles</b> are oriented at 180 degrees to the adjacent <b>baffles</b> forcing the fluid to flow upward and downwards between the tube bundle. Baffle spacing is of large thermodynamic concern when designing shell and tube heat exchangers. <b>Baffles</b> must be spaced with consideration for the conversion of pressure drop and heat transfer. For thermo economic optimization it is suggested that the <b>baffles</b> be spaced no closer than 20% of the shell’s inner diameter. Having <b>baffles</b> spaced too closely causes a greater pressure drop because of flow redirection. Consequently, having the <b>baffles</b> spaced too far apart means that there may be cooler spots in the corners between <b>baffles.</b> It is also important to ensure the <b>baffles</b> are spaced close enough that the tubes do not sag. The other main type of baffle is the disc and doughnut baffle, which consists of two concentric <b>baffles.</b> An outer, wider baffle looks like a doughnut, whilst the inner baffle is shaped like a disk. This type of baffle forces the fluid to pass around each side of the disk then through the doughnut baffle generating a different type of fluid flow.|$|E

40|$|Successful {{processing}} of homogeneous semiconductor single crystals from their melts depends strongly on precise control of thermal and fluid flow conditions near the solid/liquid interface. In this project, we utilize a novel crystal growth technique called Axial Heat Processing (AHP) {{that uses a}} <b>baffle,</b> positioned inside the melt near the interface, to supply and/or conduct heat axially to the interface. The <b>baffle,</b> {{which may or may}} not have a heater encased in it, can promote more stable and planar growth as well as reduce buoyancy driven convection. The latter is because the <b>baffle</b> reduces the aspect ratio of the melt as it separates the melt into three sections, above the <b>baffle,</b> in the feed gap between the <b>baffle</b> and the crucible wall, and below the <b>baffle</b> between the <b>baffle</b> base and the interface. AHP also enables a close monitoring and/or control of thermal boundaries near the solid/liquid interface during crystal growth by means of thermocouples placed in the <b>baffle.</b> The interface is kept planar when a heating element in the <b>baffle</b> is used.
