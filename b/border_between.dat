Reeves located the sandstone shaft marker placed by Robbins at today's Four Corners Monument. He then began to survey and mark the <b>border</b> <b>between</b> Colorado and Utah from this point northward. In 1901, Howard B. Carpenter surveyed and marked the <b>border</b> <b>between</b> Arizona and Utah, completing the survey of borders making up the Four Corners Monument.|$|E

5|$|After World War II, Berlin {{had been}} {{divided into four}} sectors {{controlled}} by the Allies: the US, the Soviet Union, Great Britain and France. The sector borders inside the city could in general be used freely for passage out of the German Democratic Republic, even after the <b>border</b> <b>between</b> the Federal Republic of Germany and the GDR had been continually closed off, starting in 1952. The outer border of West Berlin, which was also the <b>border</b> <b>between</b> West-Berlin and the GDR, had also been closed down in 1952. During the night of 12 to 13 August 1961 the National People's Army, the German Border Police, the Volkspolizei and the Combat Groups of the Working Class locked down all passages between the Soviet sector and the three West sectors; construction of border protection facilities began.|$|E
5|$|After {{crossing}} the Passaic River into Bergen County, {{the road is}} called Paterson Avenue and designated as County Route 120, in Wallington, in a residential and light-density commercial area. The road becomes the <b>border</b> <b>between</b> Wallington {{to the north and}} East Rutherford to the south. At the end of Wallington, Paterson Avenue is the <b>border</b> <b>between</b> Carlstadt and East Rutherford for a short distance but then the road dips into East Rutherford to avoid a hill (the bypass, which goes over the hill, is called Hoboken Road). The road returns to the Carlstadt/East Rutherford border at Route 17 which it crosses over via an overpass, and is then designated as Route 120 and Paterson Plank Road for a distance.|$|E

5|$|Although later medieval traditions {{described}} Pain as a chamberlain to King Henry, {{that position}} is not securely confirmed in contemporary records.

5|$|At the {{southern}} edge of Leidy Township, Kettle Creek makes several meanders, crossing the <b>border</b> <b>between</b> Leidy Township and Noyes Township three times.

Dalmatia, {{the southern part of the}} border, was similarly defined by the Fifth and the Seventh Ottoman–Venetian Wars.|$|E

5|$|During {{the late}} 18th and early 19th centuries, the area's legal and {{political}} status was disputed. The Treaty of Paris, which ended the American Revolutionary War in 1783, had defined the northern <b>border</b> <b>between</b> the United States and Canada based on the inaccurate Mitchell Map. Ownership of the area between Lake of the Woods and Lake Superior was unclear, with the United States claiming the border was further north at the Kaministiquia River and Canada claiming it was further south beginning at the Saint Louis River. In 1842, the Webster–Ashburton Treaty clarified the <b>border</b> <b>between</b> the United States and Canada using the old trading route running along the Pigeon River and Rainy River (today the BWCAW's northern border).|$|E
5|$|Fort Abercrombie {{was built}} in 1858 on the Red River at {{what is now the}} <b>border</b> <b>between</b> Minnesota and North Dakota near modern McCauleyville.

5|$|The Arcturus did not {{encounter}} the thick mats of sargassum in the Sargasso Sea that Beebe {{was hoping to}} study, but Beebe and his crew experienced great success dredging creatures from the sea {{off the coast of}} Saint Martin and Saba. In the Pacific, they encountered a strange boundary between two currents of very different temperatures, containing a vast diversity of life on the <b>border</b> <b>between</b> the two. He sailed along the <b>border</b> <b>between</b> the currents for several days to document it, theorizing that it could be the cause of the unusual climate which South America had recently been experiencing. Beebe's study of these currents, and their effect on the climate of South America, is the earliest known study of the phenomenon known as El Niño.|$|E
