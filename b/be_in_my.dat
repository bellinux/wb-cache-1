500|$|... "Bart Gets Famous" [...] {{was written}} by John Swartzwelder. The episode mocks the use of catchphrase-based humor. Many {{characters}} from The Simpsons have catchphrases, including Homer ("D'oh!"), Bart ("Eat My Shorts", [...] "¡Ay, caramba!" [...] and [...] "Don't have a cow, man!"), Marge (her worried [...] "hmmmm") and Maggie (her pacifier suck). The writers chose the phrase [...] "I didn't do it" [...] because they wanted a [...] "lousy" [...] phrase [...] "to point out how really crummy things can become really popular". It was also an intentional call {{back to the first}} season episode [...] "Krusty Gets Busted" [...] where it was a catchphrase of Krusty the Clown. The episode ends with a self-referential scene in which several characters say their catchphrases, including the Simpsons, Ned Flanders, Nelson Muntz, Mr. Burns and Barney Gumble. All of the characters gather around Lisa and stare at her with an anticipating look, and Lisa, displeased, finishes the episode by muttering [...] "If anyone wants me I'll <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> room", to which Homer says [...] "what kind of a catchphrase is that?" ...|$|E

[...] Moss' initial reaction [...] "was just one of feeling like {{there was really no}} other logical way to go for her. After everything that had happened for five years, she can't just keep butting her head up against that wall. [...] She's becoming her own person and she needs to have her own place not under Don." [...] Moss also said, [...] "I will thank [...] forever for not telling me. It would have made my life harder. I knew about Peggy's baby in season one. I fought against it, to play it as she was living it, feeling it, and not <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> head. Not knowing Peggy would quit allowed me to find it for myself, to really feel Peggy's growing frustration with Don all season." ...|$|E

500|$|By now {{desperate for}} some {{profitable}} activity, Morrell made some money by displaying Dako and Monday to a fascinated public. The only maritime opportunity available {{was to take}} a cargo to Cádiz, which he was obliged to accept. [...] He left Manila on January 13, 1831, taking his captives with him. When Antarctic reached Cádiz five months later the port was under quarantine and closed. He was forced to discharge the cargo in Bordeaux, where Dako and Monday, rumored in the town to be cannibals, again attracted great curiosity. [...] Antarctic finally reached New York on August 27, 1831; [...] despite his lack of commercial success, Morrell remained upbeat about future prospects in the Pacific. [...] "I could, with only a modest share of patronage... open a new avenue of trade more lucrative than any that our country has ever yet enjoyed, and further, it would <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> power, and mine alone, to secure the monopoly for any term I pleased."

500|$|The {{video was}} {{directed}} by James Foley, who worked with Madonna in her music video for [...] "Live to Tell", produced by David Naylor and Sharon Oreck, and Michael Ballhaus {{was in charge of}} the photography. The video was shot on location over three days in Staten Island, New York and Manhattan. Staten Island was chosen on Foley's suggestion as it was where he grew up: [...] "We talked about wanting to tap into a working-class environment, because by that time she had done 'Material Girl' and 'Like a Virgin' and other stuff that was very glamorous and stylized. She wanted to do something a bit more grounded and 'drama'." [...] Actor Alex McArthur was signed to play Madonna's boyfriend and the father of her child in the video. Madonna had spotted McArthur in a small role as a naive youth in the 1985 film Desert Hearts, and she thought he was a natural to play her mechanic boyfriend. [...] "I was out in the garage working on my Harley," [...] said McArthur, [...] "I answered the phone and a voice said, 'Hi, this is Madonna. I would like you to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> next video.'" ...|$|E

Six months later, [...] "Breakaway" [...] topped Billboard Adult Contemporary, dethroning Los Lonely Boys' [...] "Heaven" [...] on the week ending March 12, 2005. The song spent twenty consecutive weeks at number one on the chart before being dethroned by Michael Bublé's [...] "Home". However, the song returned to top the Billboard Adult Contemporary for the twenty-first week on the week ending August 6, 2005. With this achievement, [...] "Breakaway" [...] tied the record with Celine Dion's [...] "A New Day Has Come" [...] as the longest-running Adult Contemporary chart-topper by a female artist. [...] "Breakaway" [...] is also the longest-running chart-topper to come from a film in Billboard Adult Contemporary history, surpassing the nineteen-week record held jointly by Phil Collins's [...] "You'll <b>Be</b> <b>in</b> <b>My</b> Heart" [...] from Tarzan and Celine Dion's [...] "Because You Loved Me" [...] from Up Close & Personal.

500|$|In an {{interview}} with Entertainment Weekly, Rhimes said she tried {{to talk him out}} of quitting, explaining: [...] "I looked in his face and he was really sure.

[...] However, Heigl tried to talk Knight out of leaving, saying: [...] "I didn't think it was the right decision. I felt like some of the problems could be worked through. But by the time it came to fruition, I was [...] for him because he was ready to go." [...] On the topic of losing a US$14 million contract, Knight commented: [...] "From an outsider's perspective, I get the [...] 'He's just a spoiled actor, he doesn’t know how good he has it.'

500|$|Nino, a key villain, {{is portrayed}} by Ron Perlman, {{one of the}} last actors to join the cast. Regarding the casting of Perlman, Refn said, [...] "The {{character}} of Nino was originally not particularly interesting, so I asked Ron why he wanted to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> movie when he's done so many great films. When Perlman said, 'I always wanted to play a Jewish man who wants to be an Italian gangster', and I asked why, and he said, 'because that's what I am – a Jewish boy from New York', well, that automatically cemented it for me." [...] Oscar Isaac portrays a Latino convict named Standard, who is married to Irene and is just released from prison a week after Irene meets The Driver. He found the role to be a bit unappealing and chose to turn the archetypal character into something more. He said of the role: As soon as I sat down with Nicolas, he explained this universe and world of the story, so we made the character into someone interested in owning a restaurant, someone who made some wrong decisions in his life, ending up in a bad place. By making 'Standard' more specific and more interesting, we found that it made the story that more compelling.|$|E
500|$|South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut was {{nominated}} for an Academy Award for Best Original Song for [...] "Blame Canada". When {{the time came to}} perform the track live at the ceremony, as is customary for the Academy Awards, it ran into trouble with ABC's standards and practices department: censors demanded they write TV-friendly lyrics. [...] "It would be ironic to have to change the words in a movie about censorship," [...] remarked Shaiman. Censors were particularly unhappy {{with the use of the}} word [...] "fuck" [...] and allusions to the Ku Klux Klan. When Parker and Shaiman declined these requests, Robin Williams, a friend of Shaiman's, sang the song with black tape over his mouth and turning his back when curse words were to be sung. Parker and Stone attended the ceremony in drag, wearing replicas of dresses previously worn at the Oscars by Gwyneth Paltrow and Jennifer Lopez. The two claimed years later that they took acid before the ceremony and were high while wearing the outfits. The song ended up losing to [...] "You'll <b>Be</b> <b>in</b> <b>My</b> Heart", a Tarzan song by Phil Collins (that film came from ABC parent Disney). In response, Parker and Stone ridiculed him in two consecutive episodes of the series' fourth season ("Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000" [...] and [...] "Timmy 2000"). In DVD commentary, Parker states [...] "we were fully expecting to lose, just not to Phil Collins".|$|E

500|$|Musically, the single, which lasts {{three minutes}} and nine seconds, remains a [...] "Broadway-like" [...] vocal pop ballad with adult {{contemporary}} influences that features the same lyrics, beginning [...] "I {{was the one}} who had it all". Written in the key of A major at moderately slow tempo of 96 beats per minute, Groban's rendition evokes a [...] "sweeping, operatic quality", featuring lyrics revolving about pining for true love.

According to Golderby's Paul Sheehan, the track is Groban's [...] "heartbreaking rendition of" [...] a [...] "plaintive plea for love." [...] The song garnered positive reviews from critics that distinguished it from the mild controversies that had been surrounding the film at the time of its release. Devan Coggan of Entertainment Weekly described the song as a [...] "gorgeous ballad", while Den of Geek praised Groban's interpretation as [...] "immeasurable". According to Elle writer Alyssa Bailey, Groban's emotional performance will cause listeners to [...] "feel the Beast's feels". Dubbing the track [...] "one of the highlights of the album", the Daily Bruins Matthew Fernandez reviewed the ballad as [...] "a grand uplifting ballad centered on Groban's rich voice". Vulture.com's Sarah Caldwell admitted to listening to both Groban and Stevens' versions of the song back-to-back with [...] "zero ounces of shame." [...] 34th Street Magazine contributor Haley Weiss preferred Groban's version to Stevens' original, calling it [...] "breathtaking and downright lovely to listen to" [...] while dismissing the film version as [...] "downright mediocre in comparison." [...] Weiss questioned why Disney hadn't cast Groban as the Beast instead of Stevens due to the former's acting and musical theatre background.|$|E
