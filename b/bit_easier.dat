5|$|Originally, the {{developers}} planned to only upgrade the graphics and tweak the gameplay. However, as development was {{getting closer to}} completion, Capcom started making more substantial changes in the game. For example, the inventory was expanded so that players could carry a standard item like Jill's lock picking, while defense items, which were initially {{not going to be}} separated from the main inventory, were introduced to make the game a <b>bit</b> <b>easier</b> than the original Resident Evil. The developers originally planned to make all enemies invisible but the idea was ultimately discarded because it would have made the remake very different from the original game. However, they designed the zombies so that they could come back to life {{a certain amount of time}} after they are killed. The developers also added new areas for the player to explore, changed most of the puzzle designs, and included a new control scheme called Type C where players move their characters by pressing the R button of the GameCube controller and steer them with the analog stick. Another addition is the subplot involving the character Lisa Trevor, which was cut from the original game. Instead of using adjectives to describe difficulty levels, Mikami deliberately decided to have unique questions so that the player would pick the hard one.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{the massive}} land size of the 48 states of the {{continental}} United States, and the match locations were often far apart. Some teams in Groups A and B had to travel from Los Angeles or San Francisco {{all the way to}} Detroit and back again, covering 2,300mi (3,680km) and 3 time zones one way. The teams in Groups C and D only played in Foxborough (Boston), Chicago and Dallas – a trip from Boston to Dallas is 2,000 miles (3,200km), but only covers one time zone; Chicago is in the same time zone as Dallas but is still 1,000 miles away from both Dallas and Boston. The teams in Groups E and F's travel was a <b>bit</b> <b>easier</b> – they played exclusively in East Rutherford, New Jersey (New York City), Washington and Orlando. A few teams such as Cameroon and Italy did not have to travel great distances to cities to play matches.|$|E

5000|$|The late {{replacement}} for Ndou was Argentinian Aldo Rios, {{who went on}} to stop Cook in the 3rd round. Cook had started the fight well but was floored in the 3rd by a straight right hand, and a follow up attack from Rios forced referee Richard Davies to stop the contest. Following the bout Cook said [...] "I took things a <b>bit</b> <b>easy</b> and got caught cold more than anything...This may have been a step too far, but I'll be back."

[...] We made grindcore a <b>bit</b> <b>easier</b> to listen to {{at the expense of}} the diehard grindcore fans who thought that we were, well, not sellouts, but not really true to the original essence of grindcore." [...] Other Swedish groups, such as General Surgery and Regurgitate, practiced goregrind. Inhume, from the Netherlands, Rotten Sound, from Finland, and Leng Tch'e, from Belgium, were subsequent European groups who practiced grindcore with death metal inflections. In 2000s, the Belgium-based Aborted [...] "had grown into the role of key contributors to the death-grind genres".|$|E
500|$|Sava {{felt that}} having the series {{introduce}} the race made Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. [...] "an {{essential part of}} Marvel Studios' bigger plans for the future", explaining that [...] "the series has {{become more and more}} connected to the larger MCU since Captain America: The Winter Soldier, but it's always been in a reactive role. Stuff happens in the movies, and Agents Of S.H.I.E.L.D. deals with the fallout. Not anymore. This show is making things happen, and these events will clearly impact the future of the MCU because we know there's an Inhumans movie planned for 2019." [...] Sava also mentioned that introducing the Inhumans [...] "on a personal level rather than a cosmic level" [...] via the television series makes [...] "the whole idea a <b>bit</b> <b>easier</b> to swallow" [...] for the general MCU audience.|$|E

We were at al-Malikiyya, the other {{frontier}} base and word came through about 6 {{o'clock in the morning}} that one of our patrols had been blown up and Millie Law [...] had been killed. Now Gerald Whitfeld [...] had told these mukhtars that if any of this sort of thing happened he would take punitive measures against the nearest village {{to the scene of the}} mine. Well the nearest village to the scene of the mine was a place called al-Bassa and our Company C were ordered to take part in punitive measures. And I {{will never forget}} arriving at al-Bassa and seeing the Rolls Royce armoured cars of the 11th Hussars peppering Bassa with machine gun fire and this went on for about 20minutes and then we went in and I remembered we had lighted braziers and we set the houses on fire and we burnt the village to the ground... Monty had him [...] up and he asked him all about it and Gerald Whitfeld explained to him. He said [...] "Sir, I have warned the mukhtars in these villages that if this happened to any of my officers or men, I would take punitive measures against them and I did this and I would've lost control of the frontier if I hadn't."

40|$|AbstractA {{new class}} of {{symmetric}} error correcting/unidirectional error detecting codes are developed. They provide protection against both transient and permanent faults.

5000|$|In 2010, Andrade sealed his {{transfer}} to Cumberlands Patriots in the United States. He played two seasons {{for the team}} in 35 matches and scored 27 goals and couple assists.

Playing as an attacking mid, he was the second top-scorer in the team with 9 goals and had the most assists with 9. He helped the team reach the semi-finals of the Mid-South Conference. In his second season, with the change in the head coach, Andrade played as a right winger. He scored high-top 18 goals in 17 games and had 5 assists during the season. He was selected MVP of the year for his team and First-Team All-Conference. With {{the end of the season}} and a great performance, he received different offers from different clubs in the US.

It's been unbelievable this year, especially with the two Group One winners we have had. The team at home have worked very hard and are getting the results. It's very lucky for a trainer like me to get horses like these. I'm going to enjoy it while it's happening. These horses don't come along very often". Commenting on Palace Episode's prospects he added [...] "He's a very good horse who is entitled to go for very good races.

40|$|There {{are various}} types of {{disability}} egress in world like blindness, deafness, and Physical disabilities. It is quite {{difficult to deal with}} people with disability.

As parent deal with only single child so it <b>bit</b> <b>easy.</b> But teacher deals with different students at a time so its more difficult to deal with group of students with learning disability. If there is more students with learning disability so it is necessary that first all identify the type of learning disability in group of students. Some students have learning disability of mathematics; some have learning disability of other subjects. By using theory of Automata it easy to analysis the level of disability among all students then deal with them accordingly. For these purpose deterministic automata is the best practice. Teacher deals with deterministic students in class and check there response. In this research deterministic automata is use to facilitated the teacher which help teacher in identification of students with learning disability...|$|R
