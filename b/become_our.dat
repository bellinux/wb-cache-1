The Shoah must not be misused in the contest of one-downsmanship with other victims of brutality....The Shoah has <b>become</b> <b>our</b> instant raison d'etre, the {{short-cut}} answer to the penetrating questions of our children: 'Why should I not marry out of the faith? Why should I join a synagogue? Why should I support Israel? Why should I be Jewish?' We have relied on a singular imperative: 'Thou shalt not give Hitler a posthumous victory.' That answer will not work. To live in spite, to say 'no' to Hitler {{is a far cry}} from living 'yes' to Judaism.|$|E

In the song's choruses, the lines [...] "He who knows does not speak / He who speaks does not know" [...] quote the Chinese sage and author Lao-Tse, whose work Tao Te Ching inspired Harrison's 1968 composition [...] "The Inner Light". Elsewhere in the lyrics to [...] "Circles", Harrison contemplates the changing nature of friendship as, over the course of lifetimes, according to Inglis, [...] "our enemies <b>become</b> <b>our</b> companions, affections turn into hatred".|$|E

2500|$|As an alternative, humanist philosopher Dwight Gilbert Jones has {{proposed}} a renewed Renaissance humanism through DNA and genome repositories, with each individual genotype (DNA) being instantiated as successive phenotypes (bodies or lives via cloning, Church of Man, 1978). In his view, native molecular DNA [...] "continuity" [...] is required for retaining the [...] "self" [...] {{and no amount of}} computing power or memory aggregation can replace the essential [...] "stink" [...] of our true genetic identity, which he terms [...] "". Instead, DNA/genome stewardship by an institution analogous to the Jesuits' 400 year vigil is a suggested model for enabling humanism to <b>become</b> <b>our</b> species' common credo, a project he proposed in his speculative novel The Humanist – 1000 Summers (2011), wherein humanity dedicates these coming centuries to harmonizing our planet and peoples.|$|E
2500|$|At the 1995 Rugby League World Sevens tournament, {{the club}} {{introduced}} a new combination of jersey colours – mauve, aqua and white. Brisbane Broncos Marketing Manager Shane Edwards stated that it [...] "will <b>become</b> <b>our</b> Sevens strip... but we will never change the Broncos' colours." [...] In 2001, following {{the release of the}} club's predominantly white with navy-blue and maroon away jersey, the National Rugby League ordered the club to produce a third jersey since the new away jersey clashed with the home jerseys of the Penrith Panthers, Melbourne Storm and New Zealand Warriors. An aqua strip using the same design as the jerseys used from 1999 to 2001 was worn, which was much derided by the local media. Following two years of public pressure the club dropped the jersey in favour of the design worn against Newcastle in 2003.|$|E

2500|$|Director Bryan Singer {{felt that}} most people were {{familiar}} with Superman's origin and wanted to make Superman Returns as a semi-sequel to Richard Donner's Superman, with the two films sharing the same origin story. The movie opens with a very brief summary of the origin story that reads, [...] "On the doomed planet Krypton, a wise scientist placed his infant son into a spacecraft and launched him to Earth. Raised by a kind farmer and his wife, the boy grew up to <b>become</b> <b>our</b> greatest protector...Superman." [...] Otherwise, the film portrays only a few scenes related to Superman's origin. The destruction of Krypton is seen before the opening credits, Lex Luthor invades the Fortress of Solitude and views the recordings that Jor-El had sent to Earth with Kal-El, and Clark Kent discovers his ability to fly in a flashback.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first big}} live {{appearance}} of Canned Heat {{was at the}} Monterey Pop Festival on June 17, 1967. A picture of the band taken at the performance was featured {{on the cover of}} Down Beat Magazine where an article complimented their playing: [...] "Technically, Vestine and Wilson are quite possibly the best two-guitar team in the world and Wilson has certainly <b>become</b> <b>our</b> finest white blues harmonica man. Together with powerhouse vocalist Bob Hite, they performed the country and Chicago blues idiom of the 1950s so skillfully and naturally that the question of which race the music belongs to becomes totally irrelevant." [...] D.A. Pennebaker's documentary captured their rendition of [...] "Rollin and Tumblin" [...] and two other songs from the set, [...] "Bullfrog Blues" [...] and [...] "Dust My Broom", found place later in a boxed CD set in 1992. [...] Canned Heat is also included on an album called Early LA.|$|E
2500|$|The Labor for an Australian Republic Group (LFAR) has {{undertaken}} work {{to explore and}} develop further possible models. One such model is the 50/50 model.This model is supported and created by Anthony Cianflone – LFAR Grassroots Member. A new President of Australia would <b>become</b> <b>our</b> Head of State after being elected under a 50-50 model i.e. 50 per cent of the vote would be elected by the Australian people and 50 per cent of the vote would be elected by a joint sitting of the Australian Parliament. The President of Australia would play a similar ceremonial role to our current Governor General. However under the 50-50 model the President {{would be more than}} just a ceremonial figure. The vision is for the Australian President to act as Australia’s ‘Social Conscience and Moral Compass’. The President would have the capacity to influence and campaign on non-partisan issues such as Aboriginal Policy, Veterans’ Affairs, Education, Health, Environment, Human Rights, Multiculturalism, Domestic Violence, Homelessness, Poverty, Disabilities, Youth, Women, Arts, Tourism, Families, Older Australians and Sport. Whilst not having the power to veto bills, prior to providing Presidential ascent, the Constitution could allow for the President to review and seek further clarification, and information on bills from the Parliament based on a ‘Social and Moral Conscience Charter’. The President’s annual ‘State of the Nation’ Address’ to Parliament would provide one of the key formal mechanisms for the President to relay to Parliamentarians the priorities and expectation of Australians in relation to the non-partisan issues, and help improve the quality and consistency of policy reforms, parliamentary debates and community outcomes over the lifetime of different governments.|$|E
