40|$|Lateralized post-chiasmatic lesions to {{the primary}} visual pathway result in loss of vision over the visual field retinotopically {{corresponding}} {{to the site of}} the lesion. Previous studies showed that a systematic audio-visual training could constitute an efficient tool for the rehabilitation of such disturbances as revealed <b>by</b> <b>ameliorated</b> clinical performances in various visual domains. The first part of the present dissertation aim to shed light on the substrates underlying multisensory mediated recovery of visual field defects. Experiment 1 and Experiment 2, demonstrated that a sustained audio-visual training can promote stable plastic neural changes within the cortex, likely reflecting an enhanced activity of those neural circuits connecting superior colliculus to cortical areas within the dorsal stream. The second part of the present dissertation aimed to shed light on the functionality and the characteristics of extrageniculate circuits targeting extrastriate visual areas within the dorsal stream. Experiment 3 and Experiment 4, suggested that these connections remain responsive even when a lesion prevents visual processing within the primary visual channel and that these connections could play a relevant role in the rapid processing of salient visual stimuli. Overall, the present experimental evidence suggest that visual processing depends on a variety of neural circuits and that a lesion {{to the primary}} visual pathway do not abolish the visual processing mediated by alternative routes. Moreover, activity within these routes could be exploited in a rehabilitative perspective, as revealed <b>by</b> <b>ameliorated</b> clinical performances and stable plastic neural changes induced by a systematic multisensory audio-visual training in hemianopic patients...|$|R

50|$|Scholars have {{advanced}} several explanations {{to resolve the}} puzzle of why Peel made the seemingly irrational decision to sacrifice his government to repeal the Corn Laws, a policy which he had long opposed. Lusztig (1995) argues that his actions were sensible when considered {{in the context of}} his concern for preserving aristocratic government and a limited franchise in the face of threats from popular unrest. Peel was concerned primarily with preserving the institutions of government, and he considered reform as an occasional necessary evil to preclude the possibility of much more radical or tumultuous actions.

He also took care to ensure that the concessions would represent no threat to the British constitution.|$|E

5000|$|The second element, {{that the}} {{landlord}} {{knew of the}} handicap or should have known of it, places an affirmative burden on the tenant to request the reasonable accommodation, such as a waiver of a [...] "no pets" [...] policy for an emotional support animal. A tenant wishing to obtain a waiver of a [...] "no pets" [...] policy for an emotional support animal may meet this burden by providing a letter {{from his or her}} physician or mental health professional: stating that the tenant has a mental disability, explaining that the animal is needed to lessen the effects of the disability, and requesting that the animal be allowed in the rental unit as a reasonable accommodation for the mental disability. Landlords are entitled to ask for supporting materials which document the need for anemotional support animal. Mere emotional distress that would result from having to give up an animal because of a [...] "no pets" [...] policy will not qualify under federal law. Instead, there must be a link, or a nexus, between the animal and the disability. The nexus between the animal and the disability is analyzed under the third element of an FHAA housing discrimination case, known as the necessity requirement, and requires that the accommodation will affirmatively enhance a disabled tenant's quality of life <b>by</b> <b>ameliorating</b> the effects of the disability.

Fertility index, weights {{of the sexual}} organs; serum testosterone, sperm motility; count and viability; oxidative stress (superoxide dismutase, malondialdehyde and reduced glutathione and histopathological findings of sexual organs were studied.

40|$|Background: This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the development of ameliorating inventory models. The ameliorating inventory is the inventory of goods whose utility increases over the time <b>by</b> <b>ameliorating</b> activation. 	Material and Methods: This study is performed according to two areas: one is an economic order quantity (EOQ) model for the items whose utility is ameliorating in accordance with Weibull distribution, and the other is a partial selling quantity (PSQ) model developed for selling the surplus inventory accumulated <b>by</b> <b>ameliorating</b> activation with linear demand. The aim of this paper was to develop a mathematical model for inventory type concerned in the paper. Numerical examples were presented show the effect of ameliorating rate on inventory polices. 	 Results and Conclusions:  The inventory model for items with Weibull ameliorating is developed. For the case of small ameliorating rate (less than linear demand rate), EOQ model is developed, and for the case where ameliorating rate is greater than linear demand rate, PSQ model is developed.  . 	 ...|$|E

40|$|The present {{investigation}} {{was carried out}} to study the expression of major cytochrome P 450 (CYP) isozymes in streptozotocin-induced diabetes with concomitant insulin therapy. Male Sprague-Dawley rats {{were randomly assigned to}} untreated control, streptozotocin-induced diabetic, insulin-treated groups and monitored for 4 weeks. Uncontrolled hyperglycemia in the early phase of diabetes resulted in differential regulation of cytochrome P 450 isozymes. CYP 1 B 1, CYP 1 A 2, heme oxygenase (HO) - 2 proteins and CYP 1 A 2 -dependent 7 -ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) activity were upregulated in the hepatic microsomes of diabetic rats. Insulin therapy ameliorated EROD activity and the expression of CYP 1 A 2, CYP 1 B 1 and HO- 2 proteins. In addition, CYP 2 B 1 and 2 E 1 proteins were markedly induced in the diabetic group. Insulin therapy resulted in complete amelioration of CYP 2 E 1 whereas CYP 2 B 1 protein was partially <b>ameliorated.</b> <b>By</b> contrast, CYP 2 C 11 protein was decreased over 99 % in the diabetic group and was partially <b>ameliorated</b> <b>by</b> insulin therapy.

Microglia can be activated into classic activated state (M 1 state) or alternative activated state (M 2 state), and the former is harmful; in contrast, the latter is beneficial. Gypenoside (GP) is the major bioactive constituent of Gynostemma pentaphyllum, a traditional Chinese herb medicine. In this study, we hypothesized that GP attenuates Aβ-induced microglial activation <b>by</b> <b>ameliorating</b> microglial M 1 /M 2 states, and the process may be mediated by suppressor of cell signaling protein 1 (SOCS 1). In this study, we found that Aβ exposure increased the levels of microglial M 1 markers, including iNOS expression, tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), interleukin 1 β (IL- 1 β), and IL- 6 releases, and coadministration of GP reversed the increase of M 1 markers and enhanced the levels of M 2 markers, including arginase- 1 (Arg- 1) expression, IL- 10, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) releases in the Aβ-treated microglial cells. SOCS 1 -siRNA, however, significantly abolished the GP-induced effects on the levels of microglial M 1 and M 2 markers.

30|$|IRV is {{associated}} with a risk of developing VILI because of the higher pressure required to commence IRV.

However, we did not observe these adverse events in the current study. Hemodynamic compromise can be prevented or <b>ameliorated</b> <b>by</b> the incremental introduction of higher ventilation pressures, volume resuscitation, or vasopressor therapy; this is the approach we adopted in one of the patient who experienced hemodynamic instability in our study.
