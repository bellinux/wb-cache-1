Although this merger had been done ostensibly as a cost-saving measure, health care activists opposed it. Henry Ingersoll Bowditch, in particular, resigned from the merged board, complaining that it was dominated by business owners seeking to minimize discussion of pollution caused by their businesses.|$|E

5|$|The Wayne Sewerage Company was {{incorporated}} on December 1, 1902 and constructed and maintained sewers in Radnor township. It purchased an eleven-acre tract along the creek {{to build a}} sewer system and built an engine house with boilers to purify sewage. After it was purified, the water would be released into Ithan Creek where, the company claimed, it posed no threat to human health. Despite this, on December 4, 1905, the State <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> <b>Health</b> {{filed a lawsuit against}} the company alleging raw sewage was being illegally dumped into the creek. As a result, a judge sided with the <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> <b>Health</b> and a new plant was constructed.|$|E
5|$|About {{the same}} time as his gubernatorial {{campaign}} began, Blackburn appeared before the Kentucky General Assembly to advocate measures to protect the state against disease outbreaks, including the creation of a state <b>board</b> <b>of</b> <b>health</b> and the construction of quarantine centers in the state's border towns. To a large degree, his pleas fell upon deaf ears, with the exception of his proposal for the state <b>board</b> <b>of</b> <b>health,</b> which was created in March 1878. Soon after, news came that yellow fever had appeared in the lower Mississippi Valley earlier than usual; by August 1878, it had reached epidemic proportions. Blackburn advocated implementing quarantines to deal with the influx of people fleeing north to escape the disease, but many of the state's doctors did not believe yellow fever could survive as far north as Kentucky. Some towns in the Jackson Purchase region attempted to implement crude quarantines, but the city of Louisville completely ignored Blackburn's advice and welcomed refugees from the South. Blackburn temporarily halted his gubernatorial campaign and traveled to Louisville to help treat those who arrived there already suffering from the disease.|$|E

5|$|Established in 1886, Cheadle Hulme's first local {{authority}} was the Cheadle and Gatley local <b>board</b> <b>of</b> <b>health,</b> a regulatory body responsible for standards of hygiene and sanitation {{for the area}} of Stockport Etchells township and the part of Cheadle township outside the Municipal Borough of Stockport. The <b>board</b> <b>of</b> <b>health</b> was also part of Stockport poor law union. In 1888 the board was divided into four wards: Adswood, Cheadle, Cheadle Hulme and Gatley. Under the Local Government Act 1894 {{the area of the}} local board became Cheadle and Gatley Urban District. There were exchanges of land with the neighbouring urban districts of Wilmslow and Handforth in 1901, and the wards were restructured again, splitting Cheadle Hulme into north and south, and merging in Adswood. Due to the fast-paced growth of the district, the wards were again restructured in 1930, with the addition of Heald Green. In 1940 the current wards of Adswood, Cheadle East, Cheadle West, Cheadle Hulme North, Cheadle Hulme South, Gatley and Heald Green were established. Under the Local Government Act 1972 the Cheadle and Gatley Urban District was abolished, and Cheadle Hulme has, since 1 April 1974, formed an unparished area of the Metropolitan Borough of Stockport within the metropolitan county of Greater Manchester.|$|E

In 1879, {{a part of the}} neighbouring township of Thornham was amalgamated into the area of the local board. Following the Local Government Act 1894, the area of the Local Board became the Royton Urban District, a local government district within the administrative county of Lancashire. The urban district council was based in Royton Town Hall, which had been purpose built for the local board in 1880. In 1933, a part of the neighbouring Municipal Borough of Middleton was transferred to Royton Urban District. Under the Local Government Act 1972, the Royton Urban District was abolished, and Royton has, since 1 April 1974, formed an unparished area of the Metropolitan Borough of Oldham, a local government district of the metropolitan county of Greater Manchester.

5|$|From {{the early}} medieval period, New Sleaford {{was in the}} Flaxwell Wapentake and Old Sleaford in the Ashwardhurn Wapentake. Sleaford Poor Law Union, overseen by a Board of Guardians, was {{established}} in 1836. A Local <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> <b>Health</b> was formed in 1851. Public health was reorganised by the Public Health Act 1872, which established Urban and Rural Sanitary Districts (USD or RSD); Sleaford USD covered New and Old Sleaford, Holdingham and Quarrington, while the Sleaford RSD included all other parishes in the Poor Law Union. The Local Government Act 1894 converted the <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> <b>Health</b> and USD into the Sleaford Urban District Council and, in 1899, the town became the administrative base of Kesteven County Council. A rural district formed in 1894 was abolished in 1931. In 1973, Sleaford Urban District merged with the North and East Kesteven districts to form North Kesteven, a district of Lincolnshire; by statutory instrument, Sleaford civil parish became the urban district's successor, thus merging Quarrington, New Sleaford, Old Sleaford and Holdingham civil parishes.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} half of the 19th century, Sleaford's {{population}} more than doubled from 1,596 in 1801 to 3,539 in 1851. Coinciding with this is the construction or extension of public buildings, often by the local contractors Charles Kirk and Thomas Parry. The gasworks opened in 1839 to provide gas lighting in the town. Sleaford's Poor Law Union was formed in 1836 to cater for the town and the surrounding 54 parishes. The workhouse was constructed by 1838 and could house 181 inmates. Despite these advances, the slums around Westgate were over-crowded, lacking sanitation and disease-ridden; the local administration failed to deal with the matter until 1850, when a report on the town's public health by the General <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> <b>Health</b> heavily criticised the situation and set up a Local <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> <b>Health</b> to undertake public works. By the 1880s, Lord Bristol had allowed clean water to be pumped into the town, but engineering problems and a reluctance to sell land to house the turbines had delayed the introduction of sewers.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{examined}} {{the extent to which}} local public health departments in North Carolina collaborated with other groups and organizations, the health problems on which they worked together, and the effect of external collaboration on health departments' performance on core public health functions. METHODS: The author mailed a questionnaire asking about interactions with city and county government agencies, <b>boards</b> <b>of</b> <b>health,</b> schools, nonprofits, physicians/private clinics, community health centers/migrant clinics, community members, citizens' groups, state and federal agencies, and universities to all of the directors <b>of</b> local public <b>health</b> departments in North Carolina. Sixty-four directors returned the questionnaire, for a response rate of 74. 4 %. RESULTS: Local public health departments most frequently interacted with <b>boards</b> <b>of</b> <b>health,</b> state agencies, community members, schools, city and county government agencies, and nonprofit agencies. Large majorities reported productive relationships with <b>boards</b> <b>of</b> <b>health,</b> state agencies, city and county government agencies, schools, nonprofit agencies, and hospitals. Greater frequency of interaction with several types of partners was associated with better performance. CONCLUSIONS: While questions exist about whether performance on core functions improves the community's health status, the results suggest that it is important for local public health departments to continue to build relationships with other organizations in the community...|$|R
