25|$|Biological hazards (<b>biohazards)</b> include {{infectious}} microorganisms such as {{viruses and}} toxins produced by those organisms such as anthrax. <b>Biohazards</b> affect workers in many industries; influenza, for example, affects a broad population of workers. Outdoor workers, including farmers, landscapers, and construction workers, risk exposure to numerous <b>biohazards,</b> including animal bites and stings, urushiol from poisonous plants, and diseases transmitted through {{animals such as}} the West Nile virus and Lyme disease. Health care workers, including veterinary health workers, risk exposure to blood-borne pathogens and various infectious diseases, especially those that are emerging.|$|E
25|$|A {{clean room}} is {{normally}} kept {{at a higher}} pressure than the external environment to keep contaminants out, and a biohazard laboratory is kept at a lower pressure to keep the <b>biohazards</b> in. The challenge is to combine these in a single building. Solutions suggested include a triple walled containment facility, {{and one of the}} suggestions includes extensive use of robot handlers for the samples.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to regulating the experiments that were conducted, the guidelines also forbade {{the performance of}} other experiments. One such experiment was the cloning of recombinant DNAs derived from highly pathogenic organisms. In addition, neither the cloning of DNA containing toxin genes, nor large scale experiments using recombinant DNAs that {{were able to make}} products that were potentially harmful to humans, animals or plants were allowed under the guidelines. These experiments were banned because the potential <b>biohazards</b> could not be contained by the then current safety precautions.|$|E

25|$|Berg did not {{complete}} his final step due to the pleas of several fellow investigators who feared the <b>biohazards</b> associated with the last step. The SV40 was known to cause cancer tumors to develop in mice. Additionally, the E. coli bacterium (although not the strain used by Berg) inhabited the human intestinal tract. For these reasons, the other investigators feared that the final step would create cloned SV40 DNA that might escape into the environment and infect laboratory workers. These workers could then become cancer victims.|$|E
25|$|The Asilomar Conference on Recombinant DNA {{took place}} at the Asilomar Conference Center on California’s Monterey Peninsula in 1975. The main goal of the conference was to address the <b>biohazards</b> {{presented}} by recombinant DNA technology. During the conference, the principles guiding the recommendations for how to conduct experiments using this technology safely were established. The first principle for dealing with potential risks was that containment should be made an essential consideration in the experimental design. A second principle was that the effectiveness of the containment should match the estimated risk as closely as possible.|$|E
25|$|The Asilomar Conference on Recombinant DNA was an {{influential}} conference organized by Paul Berg {{to discuss the}} potential <b>biohazards</b> and regulation of biotechnology, held in February 1975 at a conference center at Asilomar State Beach. A group of about 140 professionals (primarily biologists, but also including lawyers and physicians) participated in the conference to draw up voluntary guidelines {{to ensure the safety}} of recombinant DNA technology. The conference also placed scientific research more into the public domain, and can be seen as applying a version of the precautionary principle.|$|E

25|$|Stephan Cowans {{was convicted}} of {{attempted}} murder in 1997 after {{he was accused of}} shooting a police officer whilst fleeing a robbery in Roxbury, Massachusetts. He was implicated in the crime by the testimony of two witnesses, one of whom was the victim. There was also a fingerprint on a glass mug from which the assailant had drunk some water and experts testified that the fingerprint belonged to Cowans. He was found guilty and sent to prison for 35 years. Whilst in prison, Cowans earned money cleaning up <b>biohazards</b> until he could afford to have the evidence against him tested for DNA. The DNA did not match his and he was released. He had already served six years in prison when he was released on January 23, 2004. Cowans died on October 25, 2007.|$|E
25|$|The Asilomar Conference {{also gave}} {{recommendations}} for matching {{the types of}} containment necessary for different types of experiments. These recommendations {{were based on the}} different levels of risk associated with the experiment, which would require different levels of containment. These levels were minimal, low, moderate and high risk. The minimal risk level of containment was intended for experiments in which the <b>biohazards</b> could be accurately assessed and were expected to be minimal. Low risk containment was appropriate for experiments that generated novel biotypes but where the available information indicated that the recombinant DNA could not either alter appreciably the ecological behavior of the recipient species, increase significantly its pathogenicity or prevent effective treatments of any resulting infections. The moderate risk level of containment was intended for experiments in which there was a probability of generating an agent with a significant potential for pathogenicity or ecological disruption. High-risk containment was intended for experiments in which the potential for ecological disruption or pathogenicity of the modified organism could be severe and thereby pose a serious biohazard to laboratory personnel or to the public. These levels of containments, along with the previously mentioned safety measures, formed the basis for the guidelines used by investigators in future experiments that involved the construction and propagation of recombinant DNA molecules using DNA from prokaryotes, bacteriophages and other plasmids, animal viruses and eukaryotes.|$|E
2500|$|The {{proposed}} sample return facility {{must be a}} biohazard level 4 [...] laboratory. However, {{the facility}} must also contain unknown <b>biohazards,</b> as the sizes of any putative Martian micro-organisms are currently unknown. In consideration of this, the ESF proposed additional requirements. Ideally it should contain particles of 0.01µm, or larger, and release of a particle 0.05µm or larger is unacceptable under any circumstances.|$|E
