5|$|During {{the second}} half of 1967, the North Vietnamese instigated a series of actions in the border regions of South Vietnam. All of these attacks were {{conducted}} by regimental-size NVA/NLF units, <b>but</b> <b>unlike</b> the usual hit-and-run tactics used by the People's Army forces, these were sustained and bloody affairs.|$|E

5|$|As in 1884, the {{election}} {{focused on the}} swing states of New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and Indiana. <b>But</b> <b>unlike</b> that year, when Cleveland had triumphed in all four, in 1888 he won only two, losing {{his home state of}} New York by 14,373 votes. The Republicans won Indiana, largely {{as the result of a}} fraudulent voting practice known as Blocks of Five. Cleveland continued his duties diligently until the end of the term and began to look forward to return to private life.|$|E

5|$|BBC Pilot/Redux: A {{collaboration}} with BBC Research & Development to mirror its archive which has, since June 2007, been recording 24/7 {{of all of}} the BBC's national and some regional broadcast output. BBC Pilot includes 2.2 million catalogue records and 225,000 playable programmes, <b>but</b> <b>unlike</b> BBC Redux it does not include any broadcasts beyond 2011.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, Emil du Bois-Reymond and Hermann von Helmholtz, {{following}} {{the work of}} their teacher Johannes Peter Müller showed the electrical inpulses which pass along nerves; <b>but</b> <b>unlike</b> Müller's views, that such impulses were able to be observed. Richard Caton in 1875 demonstrated electrical in the cerebral hemispheres of rabbits and monkeys. In the 1820s, Jean Pierre Flourens pioneered the experimental method of damaging specific parts of animal brains describing the effects on movement and behavior.|$|E
5|$|Modern Chinese dragons {{are also}} often green, <b>but</b> <b>unlike</b> European dragons, they are benevolent; Chinese dragons {{traditionally}} symbolize potent and auspicious powers, particularly control over water, rainfall, hurricane, and floods. The dragon {{is also a}} symbol of power, strength, and good luck. The Emperor of China usually used the dragon {{as a symbol of}} his imperial power and strength. The dragon dance is a popular feature of Chinese festivals.|$|E
50|$|The cantata {{develops}} from {{a sequence}} of recitatives and arias to a final chorus. This structure is similar to other cantatas Bach composed at Köthen, <b>but</b> is <b>unlike</b> most of his church cantatas.|$|R
50|$|<b>But</b> Hitler, <b>unlike</b> Il Duce, {{probably}} will ride the storm {{to the bitter}} end, wildly spilling oceans of blood in occupied countries {{and even in the}} Reich itself, and kill himself rather than follow Mussolini's example and resign.|$|R
5000|$|Jocelyn Leary from Dont Look Now {{also claimed}} to be a rich kid just like Naida Gosselin from the 1986 104th episode of YCDTOTV poverty and unemployment, <b>but</b> was <b>unlike</b> Naida as she was {{somewhat}} friendly, helpful, and not dictative.|$|R
5|$|On Speechless, Frith {{continued}} his exploration of world folk and dance music {{that he had}} begun on Gravity, <b>but</b> <b>unlike</b> Gravity, Speechless included extensive use of found sounds and field recordings. Frith said {{that many of the}} tapes were made while walking the streets of New York City, and include street fairs and demonstrations. Recordings were also made while visiting friends: the title song's rhythm track is provided by a malfunctioning water pipe in Tim Hodgkinson's kitchen.|$|E
5|$|Over the {{following}} decade, Tzara lent his support to political causes. Pursuing {{his interest in}} primitivism, he became {{a critic of the}} Fourth Republic's colonial policy, and joined his voice to those who supported decolonization. Nevertheless, he was appointed cultural ambassador of the Republic by the Paul Ramadier cabinet. He also participated in the PCF-organized Congress of Writers, <b>but,</b> <b>unlike</b> Éluard and Aragon, again avoided adapting his style to socialist realism.|$|E
5|$|The New World {{vultures}} are not {{closely related}} to Old World vultures, but superficially resemble them because of convergent evolution. Like the Old World vultures, they are scavengers, <b>but</b> <b>unlike</b> Old World vultures, which find carcasses by sight, some New World vultures have {{a good sense of}} smell with which they find carcasses.|$|E
5000|$|The {{theory of}} syncategoremata. Syncategoremata are terms which are {{necessary}} for logic, <b>but</b> which, <b>unlike</b> categorematic terms, do not signify on their own behalf, but 'co-signify' with other words. Examples of syncategoremata are 'and', 'not', 'every', 'if', and so on.|$|R
5000|$|Kouroi are the {{youthful}} male equivalent of Kore statues. They both show the restrained [...] "archaic smile", <b>but</b> — <b>unlike</b> the nude kouroi — korai are depicted in thick drapery, ornate and (in painted examples) very colorful and often have elaborate braided hairstyles.|$|R
50|$|Secondary sex {{characteristics}} are features that appear at sexual maturity in animals and during puberty in humans, especially the sexually dimorphic phenotypic traits that distinguish the sexes of a species, <b>but</b> that, <b>unlike</b> the sex organs, {{are not directly}} part of the reproductive system.|$|R
5|$|The New World {{vultures}} are not {{closely related}} to Old World vultures, but superficially resemble them because of convergent evolution. Like the Old World vultures, they are scavengers, <b>but</b> <b>unlike</b> Old World vultures, which find carcasses by sight, some New World vultures have {{a good sense of}} smell with which they find carcasses. Two species have been recorded in New Jersey.|$|E
5|$|The body's {{first line}} of defence against viruses is the innate immune system. This {{comprises}} cells and other mechanisms that defend the host from infection in a non-specific manner. This means that {{the cells of the}} innate system recognise, and respond to, pathogens in a generic way, <b>but,</b> <b>unlike</b> the adaptive immune system, it does not confer long-lasting or protective immunity to the host.|$|E
5|$|The incisors {{are large}} and ungrooved. Their enamel is orange, but paler on the lowers. The {{orientation}} of the upper incisors is opisthodont, with the cutting edge oriented backwards. The molars are brachydont (low-crowned) and have two rows of main cusps separated by deep valleys and complemented by a network of crests and smaller cusps. The first upper molar is broader than in T.talamancae. As in this species, <b>but</b> <b>unlike</b> in many other rice rats, including H.alfaroi, the mesoflexus on the second upper molar, which separates the paracone (one of the main cusps) from the mesoloph (an accessory crest), is not divided in two by an enamel bridge. The hypoflexid on the second lower molar, the main valley between the cusps, is very long, extending more than halfway across the tooth; in this trait, it is similar to T.talamancae <b>but</b> <b>unlike</b> H.alfaroi. Each of the upper molars has three roots (two on the outer {{and one on the}} inner side) and each of the lowers has two (one at the front and another at the back).|$|E
60|$|After Politics, let us {{return to}} the Prairie which is the High Veldt, plus Hope, Activity, and Reward. Winnipeg is the door to it--a great city in a great plain, {{comparing}} herself, innocently enough, to other cities of her acquaintance, <b>but</b> quite <b>unlike</b> any other city.|$|R
2500|$|Adam and Eve {{are cast}} out of Eden, and Michael says that Adam may find [...] "a paradise within thee, happier far". Adam and Eve also {{now have a}} more distant {{relationship}} with God, who is omnipresent <b>but</b> invisible (<b>unlike</b> the tangible Father in the Garden of Eden).|$|R
50|$|Burrata {{starts out}} much like mozzarella {{and many other}} cheeses, with rennet used to curdle the warm milk. <b>But</b> then, <b>unlike</b> other cheeses, fresh mozzarella curds are plunged into hot whey or lightly salted water, kneaded, and pulled to develop the {{familiar}} stretchy strings (pasta filata), then shaped in whatever form is desired.|$|R
5|$|The {{species is}} found in several microhabitats, but most often on rocks. Although {{predominantly}} ground-dwelling, {{it is a good}} climber. Nothing is known about its reproduction except that skinks studied in late October and early November, during the dry season, showed little evidence of reproductive activity. The Noronha skink is oviparous (egg-laying), like many Trachylepis, <b>but</b> <b>unlike</b> Mabuya, which are all viviparous (giving live birth).|$|E
5|$|The upper incisor is opisthodont, {{with the}} cutting edge {{oriented}} backward. As usual in oryzomyines, the molars are brachydont (low-crowned) and bunodont (with the cusps higher than the connecting crests). The first upper molar is narrower than in T.bolivaris. As in this species, <b>but</b> <b>unlike</b> in many other rice rats, including H.alfaroi and E.nitidus, the mesoflexus on the second upper molar, which separates the paracone (one of the main cusps) from the mesoloph (an accessory crest), is not divided in two by an enamel bridge. The hypoflexid on the second lower molar, the main valley between the cusps, is very long, extending more than halfway across the tooth; in this trait, the species is again similar to T.bolivaris <b>but</b> <b>unlike</b> H.alfaroi. Each of the upper molars has three roots (two at the labial, or outer, side and one at the lingual, or inner, side) {{and each of the}} lowers has two (one at the front and one at the back); T.talamancae lacks the additional small roots that are present in various other oryzomyines, including species of Euryoryzomys, Nephelomys, and Handleyomys.|$|E
5|$|With four {{consecutive}} victories after the loss, including {{a win over}} then-No.16 Virginia, the Hokies won the Coastal division and secured a bid to the 2007 ACC Championship Game in Jacksonville, Florida. There, they faced a rematch with Boston College, champions of the Atlantic Division. As in the previous matchup, defense dominated, <b>but</b> <b>unlike</b> in the earlier matchup, Matt Ryan was unable to seize the victory. Two fourth-quarter interceptions by Virginia Tech sealed the Hokie win and an automatic bid to the Orange Bowl game.|$|E
40|$|Bovine liver {{was shown}} to contain a {{hitherto}} undescribed medium-chain acyl-CoA-binding protein. The protein co-purifies with fatty-acid-binding proteins, <b>but</b> was, <b>unlike</b> these proteins, unable to bind fatty acids. The protein induced synthesis of medium-chain acyl-CoA esters on incubation with goat mammary-gland fatty acid synthetase. The possible function of the protein is discussed...|$|R
50|$|OptimFROG DualStream is a lossy codec, {{aimed to}} fill the gap between perceptual coding and {{lossless}} coding as OptimFROG DualStream has an option to produce a correction file. This file can be used, in combination with the main lossy-encoded file, for lossless decoding, <b>but</b> not, <b>unlike</b> Wavpack hybrid for instance, for playback.|$|R
5000|$|Bolivar Trask {{appeared}} in the 1990s animated series, voiced by Brett Halsey. This version is the Sentinels' creator and co-conspired with Henry Peter Gyrich and Cameron Hodge against mutants. But when Master Mold endangers Robert Kelly's life, he ultimately sacrifices himself to destroy his creation <b>but</b> survived <b>unlike</b> his comic book counterpart.|$|R
