50|$|Operations were {{preceded by}} early morning photo {{reconnaissance}} and/or met flights {{to try and}} pointpoint the latest positioning of the mobile launchers, and to check for sufficient visibility and cloud base. After the resulting briefing, the Squadron Leader was responsible for finding the target area and leading all twelve aircraft into {{the attack on the}} launch site(s). 124 Squadronâ€™s dive bombing runs at the targets usually started at 11,000 feet, with a steep dive of 60 degrees, to an optimum release height of 4000 feet. During the dive, each pilot attempted to pick out the rocket launcher amongst the trees. Pulling out of the dive at up to 350 mph at the release height resulted in high G forces which could cause pilots temporarily to <b>black</b> <b>out.</b> <b>To</b> deal with this possibility, during the dive pilots trimmed the aircraft so that it automatically pulled up if pressure on the stick was relaxed - as happened during blacking out. The main danger on these operations was not fighter defence, but heavy flak particularly along the coast and during the descent to drop the bombs.|$|E
40|$|The X-ray Surveyor mission {{concept is}} {{designed}} to make dramatic increases in discovery space and science capabilities for X-ray astronomy. These would be accomplished through orders of magnitude improvements over Chandra in sensitivity, field of view for sub-arcsec imaging, effective area for grating spectroscopy, and by providing high spectral resolution capabilities for extended objects on 1 -arcsec angular scales. An X-ray observatory with such capabilities, operating in concert with other major astronomical facilities of the 2020 - 2030 s, is required to address and solve {{some of the greatest}} challenges in modern astrophysics. The X-ray Surveyor will shed light on the formation of supermassive black holes by being able to detect X-rays from these objects as they grow beyond their seed state in the first galaxies. Direct data on the nature and operating modes of feedback will be provided by characterizing hot gas in galaxies and groups on scales from the very near vicinity of the central <b>black</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> the virial radius. A new era in our understanding of the plasma physics effects on astrophysical scales will be opened, for example, by resolving the detailed structure of relativistic shocks in pulsar wind nebulae and the gas turbulence in galaxy clusters. The detailed structure of the Cosmic Web will be exposed for the first time by mapping X-ray emission from hot gas in its filaments. The outstanding capabilities of X-ray Surveyor will make it an indispensable research tool in nearly every area of astrophysics...|$|E

5000|$|The 10th Group {{encountered}} {{publicity for}} the first time in 1955 when the New York Times published two articles about the unit, describing them as a [...] "liberation" [...] force designed to fight behind enemy lines. Pictures showed soldiers of the group wearing their berets, with their faces <b>blacked</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> conceal their identities.|$|R
50|$|In addition, in {{the past}} some Blue Jays games were {{televised}} nationally on Canadian over-the-air networks, namely CBC and CTV. During their existence, Blue Jays games were sometimes <b>blacked</b> <b>out</b> in Quebec <b>to</b> protect the Montreal Expos. Some over-the-air games were <b>blacked</b> <b>out</b> in Windsor <b>to</b> protect the Detroit Tigers.|$|R
25|$|Being {{suspended}} {{upside down}} {{can be a}} very hard position to maintain {{as a result of the}} position causing the blood to rush to the head. This means that this position probably cannot be maintained for any length of time and can even lead <b>to</b> the person <b>blacking</b> <b>out.</b> <b>To</b> be suspended in this position, ropes or suspension cuffs are used to lift the person into the air by their ankles.|$|R

50|$|The Secret Sign {{took place}} at night on 9-16 May 1998 at The Devil's Pulpit, Finnich Glen, near Loch Lomond. Audience members were transported by bus (with the windows <b>blacked</b> <b>out)</b> <b>to</b> {{the site of the}} work, where they were given hard hats and wading boots. They were then escorted through the glen by members of the company. Various artistic {{interventions}} were visible along the way, including lights, sounds, birds of prey and live performance.|$|R
50|$|The National Football League {{utilizes}} {{a similar}} rule for nationally-televised games carried exclusively by cable networks (such as ESPN and NFL Network). NFL policies require all games {{to be available}} on broadcast television in the markets of the teams involved, so rights to simulcast these games are typically syndicated to local stations in the affected markets, and the telecast on the respective cable network is <b>blacked</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> protect the local broadcaster that has syndication rights to these games.|$|R
50|$|Rico Gear {{scored the}} only try {{of the first}} half after some nice all round All Black play. With the scores at 6-3 in favour of the visitors, Chris Jack took the ball from the {{line-out}} in Welsh territory and provided the ball to the backs. Umaga straightened and feed back to Carter who spread it to Mils Muliaina, it was an easy pass <b>out</b> <b>to</b> Gear after that who scored in the right hand corner. Carter converted the sideline conversion and put the All <b>Blacks</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> 13.|$|R

50|$|In January 1861 at the {{beginning}} of the Civil War confederate forces seized the island, including the incomplete fortifications and the lighthouse. When they abandoned the fort in September, they removed the lighthouse lens and set the interior on fire. Union forces occupied the island shortly thereafter and restored it to operation in November 1862, using a captured lens and lantern. The light was <b>blacked</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> the north to prevent its use by blockade runners approaching from the mainland.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the first}} video release {{available}} in Hong Kong {{during the late}} 1980s-early 1990s, the last two scenes were completely cut out, so as the very last close-up of Bachu, the native girl. Instead it is replaced with a two-shot of her and her lover, while the end credits roll partly over its freeze-frame, partly over black. Also, in that video release, the native girl's nude scenes were partly censored with the explicit body parts <b>blacked</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> make the film more [...] "family-oriented" [...] (?!).|$|R
5000|$|MLB.com {{has been}} {{providing}} streaming video since the 2002 season, with only audio available before that. However, in the United States, Canada, South Korea, Guam and the US Virgin Islands, blackout restrictions apply. Games are <b>blacked</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> all users within the theoretical home television territory {{assigned to each}} team, irrespective of whether local television stations carry local games of those teams. [...] Contractual stipulations with Fox and ESPN respectively mean that regular season Saturday games scheduled before 1900 EST (beginning 20 May 2006) and Sunday games scheduled after 17:00 EST are <b>blacked</b> <b>out</b> throughout the United States. During the post-season, all games are <b>blacked</b> <b>out</b> in the United States, Canada, Japan, South Korea, Guam and the US Virgin Islands. In all other countries and territories, no exclusivity rights have been granted and MLB.com is able to broadcast all games.|$|R
5000|$|In 1994 the EU {{passed a}} law that {{prohibited}} all roadside advertising of alcoholic beverages, and the bulls were therefore to be removed. By this time the signs were nationally renowned, so although some campaigners wished them completely removed to fully comply {{with the intent of}} the law, public response resulted in the signs being retained, but completely <b>blacked</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> remove all reference to the original advertisers. The Court eventually allowed these signs to remain {{on the grounds that they}} have become a part of the landscape and have [...] "aesthetic or cultural significance", thus turning the bulls into public domain images.|$|R
50|$|TLC wasn't {{available}} in Belgium. Belgian viewers got the pan-European Animal Planet from then on, {{except for the}} satellite viewers. The Dutch feed {{was used by the}} Belgian provider of satellite television, TV Vlaanderen Digitaal. During the broadcasting time of TLC, Animal Planet <b>blacked</b> <b>out</b> due <b>to</b> television rights issues.|$|R
25|$|Billy's levels {{involve a}} degree of stealth. Unlike Ray, Billy can move totally silently whilst in sneak mode, and can hide in bushes and shadows. When he does so, he is hidden from enemy sight, and his {{character}} icon on the HUD is <b>blacked</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> show he cannot be seen. Often, {{even if he is}} seen, if he can hide quickly enough, he will escape permanent detection. Both Billy and Ray can also ride horses during the game, from which they can shoot, jump large distances and enter gallop mode. Gallop mode can only be maintained for a certain amount of time, however, before the horse becomes tired.|$|R
50|$|When {{opening the}} Crenshaw Plaza restaurant, Webb {{introduced}} original elements to adapt his {{business to the}} area with a strong gang presence. The hosts at the door, which are well connected to gang culture, check bags as guests enter and turn away people wearing {{the colors of the}} Crips and Bloods or gang signs. Patio windows facing the parking lot are <b>blacked</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> prevent anyone driving by seeing who is dining inside. When a local gang member hosted an after-wake party at the restaurant, Webb and his security called competing gangs in the neighborhood to tell them not to visit the restaurant that night.|$|R

2500|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 60's as college and NFL {{football}} was becoming more popular on television, the broadcasts were traditionally locally <b>blacked</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> encourage fans to purchase tickets to the games. [...] Rubin, first fought to lift the blackout of the Orange Bowl Game by jogging from the outside distance of the blackout radius, 75 miles, in Palm Beach, Florida down US Hwy 1, to Miami, gathering signatures on petitions for presentation to the City of Miami Commissioners in hopes that they would voluntarily lift the blackout of the Orange Bowl Game. [...] While initially unsuccessful, eventually, through public pressure and media attention, in April 1970, the Orange Bowl Committee agreed to voluntarily lift the blackout.|$|R
5000|$|On June 28, Fidrych {{appeared}} before a national {{audience for the}} first time, as the Tigers hosted the New York Yankees on ABC's Monday Night Baseball.

Fidrych didn't disappoint, earning a 5-1 complete game victory that took only 1 hour and 51 minutes. Fans wouldn't leave the stadium until Mark emerged from the dugout for a curtain call. After the broadcast, which was filled with plenty of [...] "Bird" [...] antics, Fidrych became a national celebrity.|$|R

5000|$|WKBD is {{available}} on many cable systems in Southeast Michigan, Southwestern Ontario and Northwest Ohio. Outside of the Detroit area, however, most programming on WKBD is subject to territorial syndication exclusivity restrictions placed on cable providers by the local broadcast rights holders to certain syndicated programs. During the affected programming, cable systems either switch to a feed from another channel, or run an on-screen text notice acknowledging the <b>blacked</b> <b>out</b> programming (such as [...] "This channel is being <b>blacked</b> <b>out</b> due <b>to</b> FCC regulations"). In Canada, some programs {{may be subject to}} simultaneous substitution.|$|R
50|$|Speed became {{available}} in Canada shortly after its U.S. launch. As Speedvision, Speed {{was approved by}} the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) to be added to its list of foreign cable networks approved for carriage on Canadian cable and satellite providers in 1997. As such, Speed is carried by most Canadian television service providers. Prior to August 2013, Canadian viewers saw a largely identical schedule as the U.S. channel, although some programming, particularly live Formula 1 events, were <b>blacked</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> protect TSN, which holds domestic broadcast rights to F1 events (under CRTC rules, foreign services must own Canadian broadcast rights to the content they air). However, this point became moot when NBC Sports Network obtained rights to F1 events beginning with the 2013 season, as that network is not available in Canada.|$|R
5|$|On 10 October 1984, GG1001 {{crashed in}} South Korea on a {{demonstration}} flight, killing Northrop pilot Darrell Cornell.

GI1001 crashed in May 1985 at Goose Bay, Labrador, killing Northrop pilot Dave Barnes. Again the crash was blamed on G-LOC; Barnes had been practicing his aerobatic routine for the Paris Air Show.|$|R
