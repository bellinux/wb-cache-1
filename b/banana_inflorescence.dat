Rice with local seasonal vegetables and fish form the main diet. Most of the dishes are cooked like vegetable stew, flavored with either fermented fish called ngari, or dried and smoked fish. The most popular manipuri dish is the iromba; it's a preparation of boiled and mashed vegetables, often including potatoes or beans, mixed with chilli and roasted fermented fish. Another popular dish is the savory cake called Paknam, made of a base of lentil flour stuffed with various ingredients such as <b>banana</b> <b>inflorescence,</b> mushrooms, fish, vegetables etc., and baked covered in turmeric leaves. Along with spicy dishes, a mild side dish of steamed or boiled sweet vegetables are often served in the daily meals. The manipuri salad dish called singju, made of finely julienned cabbage, green papaya, and other vegetables, and garnished with local herbs, toasted sesame powder and lentil flour is extremely popular locally, and often found sold in small street side vendors. Singju is often served with bora which are fritters of various kinds, and also kanghou, or oil fried spicy veggies. Cooked and fermented soybean is a popular condiment in all manipuri kitchens.|$|E

Cooked and fermented soybean is a popular condiment in all manipuri kitchens.The staple diet of Manipur consists of rice, fish, large varieties of leafy vegetables (of both aquatic and terrestrial). Manipuris typically raise vegetables in a kitchen garden and rear fishes in small ponds around their house. Since the vegetables are either grown at home or obtained from local market, the cuisines are very seasonal, each season having its own special vegetables and preparations. The taste is very different from mainland Indian cuisines because of the use of various aromatic herbs and roots that are peculiar to the region. They are however very similar to the cuisines of Southeast/East/Central Asia, Siberia, Micronesia and Polynesia.|$|E

40|$|The {{inflorescence}} of Mysore banana (Musa paradisiaca cv. Mysore) {{was investigated}} for its antibacterial and antioxidant activities using various solvent extractions. Buds and bracts of the inflorescence showed {{a wide spectrum}} of inhibition against foodborne pathogenic bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus (SA), Bacillus cereus (BC), Listeria monocytogenes (LM) and Vibrio parahaemolyticus (VP). The antioxidant activity was found higher in extracts with higher polarity. Methanolic extract of buds proves to have the strongest antibacterial and antioxidant activities. The 1 mg mL - 1 of the methanolic buds extracts were able to scavenge 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) radical up to 77. 8 % and inhibit the Lipid Peroxidation (LPO) at 67. 2 %. Meanwhile, the TEAC, FRAP and TPC values of the bud extracts were 137. 71 mol g - 1 extract Trolox equivalent, 2114. 70 mol g - 1 extract Fe 2 + equivalent, 122. 03 GAE mg g - 1 extract, respectively.

40|$|The {{need for}} {{renewable}} energy sources in Sri Lanka is assessed and solar photovoltaics (PVs) is identified {{to be the most}} technically suitable and economically viable power source for the conversion of solar energy to electricity in future. Three generations of solar PVs comprising 1 st, 2 nd and 3 rd generations are dentified, and Dye – Sensitized Solar Cells (DSSCs) comprising the 3 rd generation cutting – edge solar cell technology is identified being the low-cost easy to manufacture, durable, stable, long life time with reasonably high solar energy to power conversion efficiency (11 % max with expensive, scarce, synthetic dyes like Ruthenium bipiridyl complex technology), or of about 1 % with cheap, low-cost, abundant, non-toxic, environmentally friendly natural dyes of photosynthetic green plants. Natural dyes were selected to carry out further research and development work for practical applications. Research done on DSSC’s since inception in Sri Lanka were scrutinized and assessed at the Institute of Fundamental Studies (IFS), Hantana, Sri Lanka, and other Institutions in Sri Lanka. It has been observed that most of the research at the IFS has been done using very expensive synthetic Ruthenium metallic dyes and have achieved a high conversion efficiency of 10 % in May 2001. DSSCs sensitized with 145 natural dyes of plants growing in Sri Lanka were electrically and electronically tested and the ethanolic dye extracts of natural Mangoostein fruit rind (deep purple colour) exhibited the best conversion efficiency (of about 1 %.). It was also observed that other natural dyes such as Ekkiriya wood, Egg plant fruit peel, Karawalla kabilla fruit, <b>Banana</b> flower <b>inflorescence,</b> Beetroot tuber, Turmeric root and Fire fern leaf (not endemic to Sri Lanka) yield relatively good conversion efficiencies. Natural dye-based DSSCs even though possess conversion efficiencies usually below 1 %, may be improved by finding different additives. Such DSSCs are cost effective, easy to manufacture, environmentally friendly and stable. They are potential solar energy to electricity conversion devices for low power applications if further research is done to boost their conversion efficiencies to about 2 % - 3 %, and to increase their long term stability. The reasons why DSSC’s have not been developed for commercial use in Sri Lanka have been identified, assessed and remedial measures proposed. Research and development work were also initiated to develop practical DSSCs sensitized with low-cost abundant and environmentally friendly natural dyes of plants for low power applications such as battery charging of mobile telephones, iPod’s, portable radio communications equipment, LED operated multi – coloured garden - night lights of hotels etc., construction of Building Integrated Photovoltaic (BIPV) systems to provide diffused lighting with multicoloured LED operated lighting systems, provision of propulsion power to small boats etc, in order to assist solve the impending energy crisis when all known sources of fossil fuel will be exhausted in a few decades...|$|R
40|$|The study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the influence of sample preparation and extraction parameters on the antibacterial activity of inflorescences from banana (Musa balbisiaba cv. Saba). Banana inflorescences were extracted using various solvent extractions and tested for antibacterial activity using agar-well diffusion assay against gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes and Brochothrix thermosphacta) and gram-negative bacteria (Salmonella typhimurium, Salmonella enteritidis, Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7, Enterobacter sakazakii, Yersinia enterocolitica and Vibrio parahaemolyticus) The effects of geographical origin, drying methods and extraction parameters (sample-to-solvent ratio, extraction time and temperature as well as methanol to solvent ratio) on antibacterial activity of the banana by-product were carried out. Among all the extracts evaluated, methanolic extract from the buds showed significant higher inhibitory against all gram positive bacteria ranging from 12. 56 - 13. 54 mm. Interestingly, no significant different (p> 0. 05) was observed on the effect of geographical origin as well as extraction methods on the antibacterial capacity. Meanwhile, the extracts produced from 50 °C oven dried sample seem to have comparable antibacterial activity with the freeze dried samples. Extraction parameters (sample-to-solvent ratio, extraction time and temperature as well as methanol to solvent ratio) were found responsible in determining the efficacy of the antibacterial. In conclusion, methanolic extracts from <b>banana</b> <b>inflorescence</b> buds could be a new source of natural antibacterial and further bioassay guided fractionation should be carried out {{to determine the}} bioactive compounds and their biological activities...|$|E
