40|$|This work {{presents}} a VSAT based approach for extending mobile communication access to rural communities {{in developing countries}} using VSAT and satellite technology. The rural areas are clustered into village community cells with each cluster being served by a non <b>regenerative</b> <b>bidirectional</b> <b>repeater</b> system. The telecommunication technology of choice is the GSM standard. Traffic from the rural areas is collated together at the access point which serves as an interface between the village community cells and the satellite. The access points perform a frequency translation moving the signal from the GSM band to the satellite band at the transmitter and vice versa at the receiver. The system maximizes the advantage of satellite communication technology over other types in linking remote areas to urban centers that are geographically far apart. The satellite then links the village cell to the operator’s network via a dedicated BTS in the urban area. The system {{has the advantage of}} being modular, scalable and solar powered due to the low traffic from rural areas...|$|R

40|$|EDFAs can {{overcome}} losses in long fiber-optic links {{independent of the}} digital bit rate, and can amplify multiple signals in a wavelength-division multiplexed (WDM) system architecture. As more and more EDFAs are deployed, designers add new features, creating {{a need for more}} sophisticated testing. This paper provides a brief survey of the tests required to characterize EDFAs. A small child in California calls her grandmother in Germany. To her, the call seems effortless and Grandma sounds as if she is right there. A teenager in Arkansas is surfing the Net to find out about the latest in skateboard parks for a trip planned for the upcoming summer. A retired auto worker in Japan checks e-mail to see if a message from an old coworker has arrived confirming their upcoming fishing trip. These common, everyday events are only possible because of the vast deployment of capacity on the global communications network. Fiber-optics technology is the heart of this “information superhighway ” which spans the globe. Its tremendous capacity for carrying information in digital form is revolutionizing the way people live and work. Linked with cellular phone systems and computers around the world, this network provides access to incomprehensible amounts of information and vast connectivity. The most recent element adding to the success of these systems is the fiber-optic amplifier. Erbium-Doped Fiber Amplifiers The development of erbium-doped fiber amplifier (EDFA) technology has greatly changed the design methodology of fiber-optic system designers. Traditional fiber-optic systems used <b>regenerative</b> <b>repeaters</b> to boost the signals, as shown in Figure 1 a. When the length of the link exceeded the practical single-span passive limit, these <b>regenerative</b> <b>repeaters</b> detected the signal and retransmitted it with a laser, restoring the signal level as well as the signa...|$|R

The switches are either nMOS transistors with an external gate voltage V, (Figure 6 a) or CMOS transfer gates (Figure 6 b). The voltage V, can be set above V, for lower resistance and to avoid voltage drop. To evaluate many repeater placements, NOR and FPGA performance is liited mainly by the delay of the programmable interconnection network [ll.

40|$|Semi bridge {{converters}} {{are formed}} by the removal of upper (or alternatively, lower) phase leg semiconductor switching devices of their full bridge counterparts. They offer substantial advantages over a complete full bridge arrangement, because of their reduced controlled switch count and shoot through free phase leg structure. However, {{in contrast to the}} bidirectional capability of a full bridge converter, a semi bridge structure can only transfer energy in one specific direction, which limits its use to unity power factor rectification only, and even then with an identifiable level of degradation of its input current harmonic performance. The first objective of this thesis is to quantify the impact that the intrinsic topological constraint of a semi bridge rectifier has on its input current quality. A detailed analytical expression is developed for the input current under this restriction, incorporating second order effects such as supply voltage harmonics and semiconductor voltage drops. The result is used to identify the theoretical input current total harmonic distortion limits for the semi bridge rectifier as converter parameters and working conditions are varied. The second objective is to mitigate the intrinsic limitation of semi bridge rectifiers using multilevel arrangements, because of their ability to reduce the filter inductance for a given operating switching frequency. For a semi bridge rectifier, the input current harmonic performance is directly proportional to the size of filter inductance, so that the smaller filter size allowed by a multilevel converter reduces the inherent low frequency input current distortion. Two novel multilevel semi bridge rectifier structures, and the specific pulse width modulation technique for the correct carrier harmonics cancelling in these topologies, are devised and extensively validated. Finally, the third objective is to broaden the application of semi bridge converters to operate at any power factor. Recent work presents an alternative multilevel approach via the inclusion of a coupled inductor into the converter phase leg, between the upper and lower switching devices. This concept, initially conceived for the H bridge topology, was later extended to the diode clamped converter architecture. In the first instance, both these coupled inductor arrangements appear to be new inverter structures. However, more detailed analysis identifies that they are in fact the parallel connection of two complementary semi bridge converter phase legs. Although the two individual semi bridge phase legs offer unidirectional power flow only, when operating within this topological arrangement, this intrinsic limitation is overcome and the converter output offers <b>bidirectional</b> <b>regenerative</b> capability. This recognition led to a number of benefits. Firstly, a third family member is readily derived, based on a flying capacitor multilevel structure. Secondly, it becomes straightforward to identify how to best modulate and control this family of topologically reduced converters, since there is a wealth of established knowledge about how to best control their full bridge counterparts. Finally, at least for the IGBT based variants, the identification of their common semi bridge origin allows additional unnecessary diodes to be removed from the reduced topologies, minimizing their silicon device count to exactly match their full bridge counterparts. All theoretical analyses presented in this thesis were broadly confirmed by precisely matched switched simulations and experiments performed on a set of laboratory prototypes...|$|R
