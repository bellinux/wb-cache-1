25|$|The {{last seven}} of the second order of K class {{locomotives}} built in 1940-46 were fitted with <b>Boxpok</b> <b>wheels.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The postwar N class {{locomotives}} had {{a revised}} boiler design featuring a combustion chamber firebox and thermic syphons. The final batch of three Newport-built locomotives had a further {{evolution of the}} design, with German [...] "Witte"-style smoke deflectors, and <b>boxpok</b> <b>wheels.</b>|$|R

This engine is fitted with spoked wheels, except for the main (third from front) driving axle which is fitted with <b>boxpok</b> <b>wheels.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A Boxpok is a steam {{locomotive}} wheel that gains its strength through being {{made of a}} number of box sections rather than having traditional solid spokes (the name is a variation on [...] "box-spoke"). Being hollow, they allow better counterbalancing than conventional drivers, which is important for fast locomotives. The <b>Boxpok</b> <b>wheel</b> was patented by General Steel Castings Corporation of Granite City, Illinois.|$|E
5000|$|... ==Name== The Bulleid Firth Brown, or BFB, is {{sometimes}} but inaccurately {{referred to as}} a Boxpok (colloquially, “ Boxpox”) in reference to the <b>Boxpok</b> <b>wheel</b> used by a number of US railway companies. The BFB is visually similar to the Boxpok, but is of a different design; the Boxpok is composed of sections fixed together to make a hollow shape, while the BFB is cast in a single piece, like a spoked wheel, the shape giving the rigidity needed.|$|E
5000|$|Steam {{locomotives}} use spoked {{driving wheels}} of cast steel. A few makers have favoured variants of this, seeking a more weight-efficient design by using {{various forms of}} hollow or girder spoke, rather than solid oval-section spokes. One {{of the most successful}} of these designs was the Bulleid Firth Brown (or BFB) wheel, often incorrectly confused with the <b>Boxpok</b> <b>wheel.</b> This had some features of the wobbly web, being developed from a flat disc wheel with short, wide [...] "spokes" [...] formed in it by displacing teardrop-shaped sections of the disc into another plane. Except for a few small lightening holes, this disc wheel is consistently one wall thickness thick, all around the disc.|$|E
25|$|Late {{in their}} life, {{some of the}} A2s also {{received}} <b>Boxpok</b> driving <b>wheels</b> as their conventional spoked wheels began to suffer fatigue cracks with age and mileage.|$|R

50|$|Visually, the Su was {{the last}} true Russian-look design before the American {{influence}} of high running boards, bar frames and <b>boxpok</b> <b>wheels</b> became the norm. The Su retained such features as a clerestory skylight in the cab roof and handrails {{on the outside of}} the running board. These handrails were a result of the harsh Russian winters, when ice would build up on the running boards, making them highly dangerous. Enginemen had fallen to their death from moving trains and the fitting of promenade deck style handrails was a safety measure ordered by the Tsar in pre-revolutionary times. These features, combined with the high 17 ft loading gauge, combined to give the locomotives a uniquely Russian appearance.|$|R
50|$|For the SNCF, {{this type}} of machine {{constituted}} a small revolution - with simple expansion and very advanced construction techniques, the 141 R 1101-1340 were the only SNCF steam locomotives equipped with <b>Boxpok</b> <b>wheels,</b> and roller bearings on all the driving and coupled axles, {{as well as an}} almost indeformable one-piece cast steel frame. The bar frames and the axle box bearings of 141 R 1-1100, appeared irreproachable, which made them powerful machines but economical to maintain. For 141 R 1101-1340, the maximum mileage run between two main works visits was up to 230000 km. Easy to drive, they offered relatively modern comfort for both drivers and firemen. The cabs were fully enclosed, equipped with a comfort and an ergonomic hitherto unknown to SNCF crews. Driving and firing controls were within reach while seated, with automatic coal feeding thanks to the mechanical stoker, and oil-firing was even easier. They were banalisées ("standardised"), that is, not assigned to a particular crew.|$|R

5000|$|The heavy Class H Northerns of the Chicago and Northwestern Railroad were rebuilt in 1940 with {{lightweight}} rods, <b>Boxpok</b> driving <b>wheels</b> and {{roller bearings}} on all axles, and the boiler pressure was raised from [...] Some years later, 24 of them underwent another rebuild which included new nickel-steel frames, new cylinders, pilot beams and air reservoirs, new fireboxes and other minor improvements. These were reclassified as Class H-1.|$|R
50|$|The new boiler {{made the}} {{so-called}} Reko-01 (Reko {{is short for}} Rekolokomotive) into the most powerful German express train steam locomotive. In addition to a combustion chamber and the well-known IfS mixer-preheater, the 01.5's boiler was fitted with three full bore boiler safety valves (Ackermann valves, nominal width 60). The engines were given Trofimoff valves and, apart from 01 501 and 01 520, new welded cylinders. The new boiler came with a new, welded driver's cab with upholstered seats, side-pull regulator and other improvements to the working conditions of the locomotive crew, {{as well as an}} Indusi system. The latter was required for the border-crossing traffic to Bebra and Hamburg-Altona and services on the Dresden-Berlin line. Because the coupled wheelsets on many engines had to be replaced due to fractured spokes, eight examples were fitted with <b>Boxpok</b> <b>wheels</b> made of cast iron, like those already used in the Soviet Union and the United States. These did not prove themselves, however, due to manufacturing defects and were later swapped out for spoked wheels from retired 01s. In order to hide the ugly wheelsets, the Boxpok locomotives and several other vehicles were fitted with full skirts.|$|R
5000|$|Santa Fe {{developed}} their Northerns for years. The fourteen 3751 class locomotives that {{were introduced in}} 1927 and 1928 were of conservative design, with 73 in diameter driving wheels and a boiler pressure of [...] In 1938, these locomotives were rebuilt with more modern features, including new 80 in diameter <b>Boxpok</b> driving <b>wheels,</b> increased size steam passages {{to and from the}} cylinders, the boiler pressure raised to [...] and roller bearings on all engine axles. This gave them a maximum drawbar power of [...] at 50 mph. Engine no. 3752 was equipped with Franklin rotary cam poppet valve gear and achieved the very low steam rate of 13.5 lb per indicated horsepower-hour (2.28 mg/J). These locomotives were permitted to run at 90 mph, but they were alleged to have exceeded 100 mph several times.|$|R
50|$|Pennsylvania Railroad 5550 is a {{mainline}} {{steam locomotive}} currently {{under construction in}} the United States of America. Upon completion, the locomotive will be the 53rd addition to the Pennsylvania Railroad's T1 steam locomotive class with an approximated year of completion date set for sometime around 2030. The total estimated cost of PRR 5550 is US $10,000,000. The project is following {{some of the same}} protocols and objectives faced during the prior construction of the LNER Peppercorn Class A1 steam locomotive Tornado in the United Kingdom to help ensure its success. The T1 Trust has also worked closely with many United Kingdom based steam locomotive foundations to aid in the construction of PRR 5550. Construction of the locomotive began in 2014 with the casting of the proposed locomotive's keystone shaped number plate with several other key pieces such as two of the large <b>Boxpok</b> driving <b>wheels</b> either complete or under construction as of April 2017.|$|R
5000|$|The eight <b>Boxpok</b> driving <b>wheels</b> of the {{original}} T1's were 80 in in diameter and were of a hollow steel design where as a conventional steam locomotive driving wheel is completely solid. The design is also a higher strength than conventional driving wheels and ideal for high speed operations. On July 8, 2015, the T1 Trust launched a Kickstarter campaign titled [...] "Let's Get Rolling" [...] to raise $20,000 {{to be used in}} the design and building of a casting pattern for the new Boxpok drivers. The campaign reached over its goal and construction began on the casting patterns, which were finished in October 2015. Construction of the casting patterns was undertaken by Liberty Pattern in Youngstown, Ohio using a complex CAD model made of PRR 5550's proposed number four wheelset. Casting of the drivers was awarded to Beaver Valley Alloy in Monaca, Pennsylvania On February 26, 2016, Beaver Valley Alloy cast the first of eight driving wheels at its foundry successfully. This historic event marked the first time a steam locomotive driving wheel had been cast in the United States since the 1940's. A second driver was ordered on December 9, 2016 and was cast by Beaver Valley Alloy on March 6, 2017. The second Boxpok was delivered to the T1 Trust on March 15, 2017 and placed next to the first completed driver. Both drivers represent the number four wheelset.|$|R
