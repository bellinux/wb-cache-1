5|$|To {{ensure that}} there are enough signal {{transitions}} for clock recovery {{to occur in the}} <b>bitstream,</b> a bit stuffing technique is applied to the data stream: an extra 0bit is insert into the data stream after any occurrence of six consecutive 1bits.

For USB3.0, additional data transmission encoding is used to handle the higher data rates required.|$|E

Algorithms for creating fully scalable video streams, in which multiple types of scalability are offered at the same time, are becoming mature. On the other hand, research on applications that use such <b>bitstreams</b> is only recently emerging. In this paper, we introduce a mathematical model for describing such <b>bitstreams.</b> In addition, we show how we can model applications that use scalable <b>bitstreams</b> by means of definitions that are built on top of this model.

An ActiveX plugin was available to add support for TrueDoc to Internet Explorer, but the technology had to compete against Microsoft's Embedded OpenType fonts, which had natively supported in their Internet Explorer browser since version 4.0.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} XtokaxtikoX, a fully autonomous {{cyber-physical system}} employing only stochastic arithmetic to perform computations on its data-path. Traditional implementations of stochastic computing systems benefit from fast and compact implementation of arithmetic operators, and high tolerance to errors, but depend {{heavily on the}} conversion between stochastic <b>bitstreams</b> and binary to implement {{many parts of the}} system. Furthermore, if a system requires any interaction with analog electronic components it must have additional ADC/DAC conversion circuitry, which further increases the complexity of the system.

25|$|JPEG uses a lossy form of {{compression}} {{based on}} the discrete cosine transform (DCT). This mathematical operation converts each frame/field of the video source from the spatial (2D) domain into the frequency domain (a.k.a. transform domain). A perceptual model based loosely on the human psychovisual system discards high-frequency information, i.e. sharp transitions in intensity, and color hue. In the transform domain, the process of reducing information is called quantization. In simpler terms, quantization is a method for optimally reducing a large number scale (with different occurrences of each number) into a smaller one, and the transform-domain is a convenient representation of the image because the high-frequency coefficients, which contribute less to the overall picture than other coefficients, are characteristically small-values with high compressibility. The quantized coefficients are then sequenced and losslessly packed into the output <b>bitstream.</b> Nearly all software implementations of JPEG permit user control over the compression-ratio (as well as other optional parameters), allowing the user to trade off picture-quality for smaller file size. In embedded applications (such as miniDV, which uses a similar DCT-compression scheme), the parameters are pre-selected and fixed for the application.|$|E

It allows the download of partial <b>bitstreams</b> depending on FPGA embedded resources and gives access to local or remote servers when a complete portfolio of <b>bitstreams</b> is needed.

40|$|Due to the {{increasing}} heterogeneity in network and terminal capabilities, the delivery of multimedia content has become an important issue today. In order to avoid offering multiple {{versions of the same}} media resource, a transparent approach under the form of scalable coding is needed for multimedia delivery systems. This paper proposes a fully format agnostic adaptation engine for scalable <b>bitstreams</b> by relying on an abstract model for these <b>bitstreams.</b> The adaptation technique is implemented by making use of the MPEG- 21 Digital Item Adaptation specification. The approach is validated for five different scalable coding formats. Experimental results show that our fully format agnostic adaptation node customizes scalable <b>bitstreams</b> in real time (at a speed of more than 100 Mbit/s) ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{a method that}} enhances the relocatability of partial <b>bitstreams</b> for FPGA run-time reconfiguration. Reconfigurable applications usually employ partial <b>bitstreams</b> which are specific to one target region on the FPGA. Previously, techniques have been proposed that allow relocation between identical regions on the FPGA. However, as FPGAs are becoming increasingly heterogeneous, this approach is often too restrictive. We introduce a method that circumvents the problem of having to find fully identical regions based on compatible subsets of resources, enabling flexible placement of relocatable modules. In a software defined radio prototype with two reconfigurable regions, the number of partial <b>bitstreams</b> is reduced by 50 % and the compile time is shortened by 43 %...|$|R
500|$|Blu-ray permits {{secondary}} audio decoding, {{whereby the}} disc content {{can tell the}} player to mix multiple audio sources together before final output. Some Blu-ray and HD DVD players can decode all of the audio codecs internally and can output LPCM audio over HDMI. Multichannel LPCM can be transported over an HDMI connection, {{and as long as}} the AV receiver implements multichannel LPCM audio over HDMI and implements HDCP, the audio reproduction is equal in resolution to HDMI 1.3 <b>bitstream</b> output. Some low-cost AV receivers, such as the Onkyo TX-SR506, do not allow audio processing over HDMI and are labelled as [...] "HDMI pass through" [...] devices. [...] Virtually all modern AV Receivers now offer HDMI 1.4 inputs and output(s) with processing for all of the audio formats offered by Blu-ray Discs and other HD video sources. [...] During 2014 several manufacturers introduced premium AV Receivers that include one, or multiple, HDMI 2.0 inputs along with a HDMI 2.0 output(s). However, it was not until 2015 that most major manufacturers of AV receivers also included support for HDCP 2.2 as will be needed to support certain high quality 4K/UHD video sources, such as the upcoming Blu-ray 4K/UHD players.|$|E
500|$|Even with an HDMI output, a {{computer}} {{may not be}} able to produce signals that implement HDCP, Microsoft's Protected Video Path, or Microsoft's Protected Audio Path. Several early graphic cards were labelled as [...] "HDCP-enabled" [...] but did not have the hardware needed for HDCP; this included some graphic cards based on the ATI X1600 chipset and certain models of the NVIDIA Geforce 7900 series. The first computer monitors that could process HDCP were released in 2005; by February 2006 a dozen different models had been released. The Protected Video Path was enabled in graphic cards that had HDCP capability, since it was required for output of Blu-ray Disc video. In comparison, the Protected Audio Path was required only if a lossless audio <b>bitstream</b> (such as Dolby TrueHD or DTS-HD MA) was output. Uncompressed LPCM audio, however, does not require a Protected Audio Path, and software programs such as PowerDVD and WinDVD can decode Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD MA and output it as LPCM. A limitation is that if the computer does not implement a Protected Audio Path, the audio must be downsampled to 16-bit 48kHz but can still output at up to 8channels. No graphic cards were released in 2008 that implemented the Protected Audio Path.|$|E
