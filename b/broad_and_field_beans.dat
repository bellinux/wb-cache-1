40|$|Innovative {{integrated}} {{pest management}} methods are needed to overcome market withdrawal of synthetic pesticides. Therefore, the identification of environment-friendly bio-products carrying direct or indirect biocide activity is one promising alternative option. Our researches focus on the identification of appropriate formulations releasing volatile organic compounds that are attractant for natural enemies of insect pests. However, the elaboration of slow-release devices that ensure stable and controlled release of active volatile compounds is quite challenging. Here, we developed a formulation based on E-β-farnesene and (-) -β-caryophyllene, these two semiochemicals having strong attractive potential on aphid natural enemies including lady beetles and hoverflies. Both compounds were encapsulated together in alginate gel beads. The blend efficiency was first evaluated through laboratory assays, and then in wheat <b>and</b> <b>broad</b> <b>bean</b> <b>fields,</b> by considering the abundance and diversity of aphids and their natural enemies.

In this study, the abundance of aphid predators was compared in organic and conventional corn <b>and</b> <b>broad</b> <b>bean</b> <b>fields</b> during a two-year inventory. In both farming strategies, {{there were no differences}} between species diversity. Five aphid predator species were mainly observed: Coccinella septempunctata L. 1758 (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), Propylea quatuordecimpunctata (L. 1758) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), Harmonia axyridis Pallas 1773 (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), Chrysoperla carnea (Stephens 1836) (Neuroptera: Chrysopidae) and Episyrphus balteatus (De Geer 1776) (Diptera: Syrphidae). Differences in abundance of aphidophagous species between conventional <b>and</b> organic crop <b>fields</b> were observed even if not always in favour of the latter condition. The abundance of the five above- mentioned aphidophagous species varied for the most part according to almost all the observed parameters, including sampled year, crop and agricultural practices.

These tests were performed in mesophylic conditions (35 °C) on previously chopped and ensiled biomass. The three crops have been cultivated in Southern Italy (Puglia region), both as single-crops and intercropping between triticale or barley <b>and</b> <b>field</b> <b>bean,</b> in different mixture combinations, during the season 2009 - 2010. Emphasis {{was placed on the}} determination of the chemical composition of feedstock from the three single species and their different intercropping ratios, mowed at two subsequent stages (milk and dough development of grasses), also assessing their consequent biogas and methane potential yields after silage. Seven overall treatments have been compared: the three species in monoculture (triticale, barley <b>and</b> <b>field</b> <b>bean,</b> respectively); two mixtures between triticale <b>and</b> <b>field</b> <b>bean</b> (with triticale at 70 and 50 %, respectively); two mixtures between barley <b>and</b> <b>field</b> <b>bean</b> (again with barley at 70 and 50 %, respectively). Immediately after cutting and for the next 90 days, biomass samples were closed into plastic mini-silos, each having a 5 -L capacity, in order to simulate the silage process. Thereafter, the batch testing was performed and biogas and methane production have been determined, with respect to the main chemical characteristics of the chopped and ensiled biomass samples, able to affect biogas and methane yield. Considering the single-crop treatments the highest biogas per hectare production has been found with respect to triticale (8737. 1 nm 3 ha - 1) and barley (8837. 6 nm 3 ha - 1), at the first and second harvesting stage, respectively. Concerning grass-legume intercropping, the highest biogas yield (8635. 0 nm 3 ha - 1) was observed with reference to the 70 : 30 mixing ratio, specifically on barley mowed at the milk development stage.

Sponsorship: MAFF/Milk Development CouncilTwo experiments describe the ensiling potential of whole-crop forage peas (Pisum sativum) <b>and</b> <b>field</b> <b>beans</b> (Vicia faba). In Experiment 1, forage peas (cv. Magnus) <b>and</b> <b>field</b> <b>beans</b> (cv. Mayo) were harvested at 10, 12 and 14 weeks after sowing, and ensiled in 10 kg mini-silos either untreated or treated with an inoculant (Lactobacillus plantarum). In terms of yield and ensiling potential, the optimum growth stage for harvesting forage peas occurred at 12 weeks of growth. In contrast, delaying {{the harvest of}} <b>field</b> <b>beans</b> until 14 weeks gave the highest yields of dry matter (DM) and crude protein (CP). Changes in crop maturity {{had little effect on}} the chemical composition of the fresh forages, but between-harvest date differences were observed in the DM, ammonia-N, CP, water-soluble carbohydrates (WSC), acid-detergent fibre (ADF), neutral-detergent fibre (NDF), lactic acid and volatile fatty acids (VFA) concentrations and pH of the corresponding silages. Fermentation was improved by applying an inoculant. In Experiment 2, forage peas <b>and</b> <b>field</b> <b>beans</b> were harvested at 14 weeks after sowing and ensiled as round-bale silage, either untreated or treated with an inoculant. The yields of the crops were similar, and the only difference in the chemical composition of the wilted forages was a higher CP concentration in the <b>field</b> <b>beans.</b> However, after the ensiling process was complete, the forage pea silages were found to have significantly higher DM, WSC, starch and butyric acid concentrations compared with the <b>field</b> <b>bean</b> silages, <b>and</b> lower ammonia-N, CP, ADF, acetic acid and lactic acid concentrations. Inoculation was found to increase the lactic acid concentration and reduce the pH and ammonia-N and acetic acid concentrations of the silages.

The four diets were formulated so as to supply the same crude protein amount. CS pigs showed lower apparent digestibility coefficients (ADCs) for crude protein (81, 38 % vs 82, 65 %) and crude fibre (35, 97 % vs 40, 65 %). Nitrogen balance was more favourable in DLW pigs (32, 12 % vs 19, 67 %) which showed a higher nitrogen retention (+ 69 %).

The effect of MFC’s (<b>field</b> <b>bean)</b> on bumblebee visitation rates to <b>field</b> margin flowers <b>and</b> seed set was analysed to discover if the provision of the mass flowering <b>field</b> <b>bean</b> increased visitation rates to, and reproductive success of, obligate pollinated red clover (Trifolium pratense). The effect of MFC’s on bumblebee foraging behaviour and its effect on seed set was examined in relation to three experimental patches of clover, planted in each field margin of both MFC and control crop (wheat, Triticum aestivum) fields. Red clover pollination was dependant on bumblebee movement between clover patches as no-within patch pollination could occur. Visitation rates to red clover were significantly higher in MFC fields when visits were resource adjusted (RAVR). Bumblebee foraging behaviour was different between MFC <b>and</b> non-MFC <b>fields,</b> in particular it was found that bumblebees did not forage in the non-MFC crop and were more likely to forage out of the non-MFC crop altogether. Bumblebee movement between clover patches was lower in <b>bean</b> <b>fields.</b> Pollination saturation may also have occurred in both crop types. Therefore no significant relationship was found between the increased visitation rate of bumblebees observed in MFC <b>fields</b> <b>and</b> seed set of red clover. Synthesis and applications. Mass flowering <b>field</b> <b>beans</b> act as a magnet for bumblebees increasing visitation rates to field margin flowers, which however, does not translate into greater reproductive success for red clover.

40|$|WO 200054608 A UPAB: 20021105 NOVELTY - Method for {{treating}} and processing lupin seeds, containing alkaloids (I), oil and proteins, to recover products by targeted fractionation, comprises deoiling the comminuted seeds by immersion in a solvent, then {{treatment of the}} residue with acid to remove acid-soluble components, particularly (I). DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The seeds are comminuted and/or formed into small disk-shaped flakes, using a cooled flaking roller, after preliminary breakage of the optionally dehusked seeds. The flakes are heated indirectly to eliminate most {{of the water and}} after removal of the oil, the acid-solubles are removed by aqueous extraction to leave a raffinate of reduced (I) content and an aqueous extract. USE - The method is used to produce (i) proteins, for human or animal feeding; (ii) oils and (iii) alkaloids, for use as agricultural or pharmaceutical active ingredients. The same method can be applied to other seeds such as rape, linseed, soya, groundnut, peas <b>and</b> <b>field</b> <b>beans.</b> ADVANTAGE - The method produces proteins (i) in unaltered (native) form, although seed enzymes are inactivated, so that development of rancidity is prevented and (ii) practically free from bitter components (mainly lipophilic (I) that are usually difficult to remove). Compared with known methods for removing bitter agents, it is technically simpler and is operated under milder conditions...|$|R
40|$|Zinc {{deficiency}} {{symptoms in}} corn <b>and</b> <b>field</b> <b>beans</b> were recognized in western Nebraska during 1955. Since that time, zinc deficiency in corn {{has been noted}} {{in many areas of}} the state. Zinc deficiency is most likely to occur in calcareous, sandy soils low in organic matter, areas levelled for irrigation, and severely eroded areas. Phosphorus fertilization of soils high in native available phosphorus may induce zinc deficiency in corn. It is the purpose of this study to further evaluate factors influencing the phosphorus-zinc relationship. Soil temperature, soil moisture applied zinc, and applied phosphorus were used as variables in a greenhouse study with corn. Two soils, Crofton silty clay loam and Pawnee soil, were used in the study. Crofton soil is highly calcareous (pH 8. 0) with low available phosphorus, while the Pawnee soil is moderately acid (pH 5. 5) with low available phosphorus. Both soils had an adequate level of dithizone extractable zinc. Under these conditions, a marked yield response to applied phosphorus would be expected with little or no response from applied zinc. Radioisotope tracers of both zinc and phosphorus were used to evaluate the utilization of the fertilizers. Corn was grown in the greenhouse harvested at 35 and 66 days of growth and analyzed for phosphorus and zinc concentration. Advisor: R. A. Olso...|$|R
40|$|International audienceFormulation and {{manufacture}} of gluten-free bread with rice <b>and</b> <b>field</b> <b>bean</b> were investigated. A 5 -level Central Composite Design with two factors – hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC) and water - was elaborated. Cereal dough samples composed of 2 / 1 (w/w) rice/field bean were made. Results {{were compared to}} a control of soft wheat. Rheological properties of dough (storage modulus, loss angle, stiffness, stress-hardening and relaxation index) were evaluated. A selection of two HPMC – water concentration domains were found using rheological values matching those of wheat flour dough. Within these two domains, rheological parameters and bread making tests were realized in order to confirm the validity. The level of HPMC-water which displays a specific volume closest to the control was [3. 32 - 90. 5]%. Loss angle, measured at 60 °C, was inversely related to the fineness of breadcrumb {{as was the case}} for wheat dough. Crumb fineness increases with the specific volume of bread. No correlation was observed between crumb heterogeneity and stress-hardening character of gluten-free breads measured at different biaxial extension rates. Moreover a more marked stress-hardening character measured at 38 °C and at low biaxial extension rate seems to lead to bread with small specific volume...|$|R
40|$|Gastrointestinal {{nematodes}} (GIN) {{are one of}} {{the most}} important problems affecting health and therefore performance and welfare in small ruminant husbandry. The control of these parasites in the past strongly relied on the repeated use of anthelmintic drugs. This has led to nematode populations which are resistant to most of the currently available anthelmintics. Furthermore customer’s demands for organic and residue free animal products are increasing. The aforementioned problems have given a strong impetus for the development of new non-chemical strategies to control GIN. Previous research has pointed out the anthelmintic potential of sainfoin (Onobrychis viciifolia) and other tanniferous (CT) feed sources in goats and lambs infected with GIN. A recent Swiss experiment focussed on the use of sainfoin <b>and</b> <b>field</b> <b>bean</b> (Vicia faba, cv. Scirocco) as single CT sources as well as in combination for additional synergic effects, to reduce periparturient GIN egg rise of ewes in late gestation and early lactation. Another experiment with Alpine goats concentrated on the influence of sainfoin on milk performance and cheese quality. The results of these experiments will be presented and discussed in connection with previous knowledge on (i) anthelmintic effects of sainfoin and (ii) the influence of sainfoin administration on performance...|$|R
