5|$|Amino acids {{are under}} {{development}} as {{components of a}} range of biodegradable polymers. These materials have applications as environmentally friendly packaging and in medicine in drug delivery and the construction of prosthetic implants. These polymers include polypeptides, polyamides, polyesters, polysulfides, and polyurethanes with amino acids either forming part of their main chains or bonded as side chains. These modifications alter the physical properties and reactivities of the polymers. An interesting example of such materials is polyaspartate, a water-soluble biodegradable polymer that may have applications in disposable diapers and agriculture. Due to its solubility and ability to chelate metal ions, polyaspartate is also being used as a biodegradeable anti-scaling agent and a corrosion inhibitor. In addition, the aromatic amino acid tyrosine is being developed as a possible replacement for toxic phenols such as <b>bisphenol</b> <b>A</b> in the manufacture of polycarbonates.|$|E

Calcium homeostasis and haematological indices were evaluated in all subjects. Blood lead level was significantly higher in the lead workers than in controls (P 0. 05).

In the present study, we aimed to determine whether several events triggered by 17 β-estradiol (E 2) in MCF- 7 breast cancer cells were also observed in response to various bisphenol-A (BPA) analogues. We studied the expression of estrogen controlled genes by measuring the induction of pS 2 (mRNA and protein) and progesterone receptor (PgR) {{as well as the}} expression of a luciferase reporter gene transfected into MVLN cells. These data were compared to the cell proliferation potency and effectiveness as the latest expression of estrogen controlled functions. <b>Bisphenols</b> showed <b>an</b> agonistic effect in all our assays, suggesting that these compounds may act through all the response pathways triggered by the natural hormone. We found differences between the assays in the potency of bisphenols, defined as the minimum concentration required to produce a maximal effect. In the cell proliferation assay, all tested compounds needed a lower concentration than in the other assays to give maximal response. Our results suggest that the polarity and nature of the substituent in the central carbon determines the estrogenic potency. Presence of two propyl chains at the central carbon appears to confer the greatest potency in both gene and protein expression assays. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

40|$|Rate {{constants}} {{which have}} been reported for the bimolecular self-reaction of 3 ̆b 1 -tocopheroxyl radicals vary by about 5 orders of magnitude. We {{have found that the}} observed bimolecular rate constant can vary by about a factor of 7 during a single, but typical experiment, e. g., in chlorobenzene at 37 0 C from ca. 7 x 103 M- 1 s- 1 initially to ca. 1 x 103 M- 1 s- 1 finally. The overall reaction involves a disproportionation with the transfer of a hydrogen atom from the 5 -methyl group of one radical to the phenoxyl oxygen atom of the other radical forming 3 ̆b 1 -tocopherol and an o-quinone methide. In the slow regime (which corresponds to the true reaction of two 3 ̆b 1 -tocopheroxyl radicals) this disproportionation has a deuterium kinetic isotope effect of 3. 7. The bizarre kinetic behavior observed with 3 ̆b 1 -tocopheroxyl radicals has been traced to a very minor impurity which will be present in any normal sample of 3 ̆b 1 -tocopherol. The impurity in question is <b>a</b> <b>bisphenol</b> in which two 3 ̆b 1 -tocopherol moieties have become linked through their 5 -methyl carbon atoms. This <b>bisphenol</b> is <b>a</b> "natural" impurity in 3 ̆b 1 -tocopherol since it will be formed upon exposure of 3 ̆b 1 -tocopherol to air.
