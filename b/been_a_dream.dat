5|$|During the party, Tony Yayo enters {{another room}} of the mansion and removes a {{painting}} {{from one of the}} walls, revealing a hidden safe: after opening it and removing a silver necklace, a woman (Buffie Carruth) who has followed him from the party enters the room and the pair begin to embrace. At this point, the police suddenly enter the room, searching for Tony Yayo, although it is shown that he has escaped just in time through an open door in the room. Reunited in the Mercedes-Benz with 50 Cent, Tony Yayo gives the necklace to 50 Cent: at this point, Tony Yayo abruptly wakes up, in his jail cell, showing the preceding events of the video to have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>dream.</b>|$|E
5|$|Sometime later, {{the player}} wakes up to Chirithy at a {{simulation}} of Enchanted Dominion. Chirithy {{claims that the}} events of the Keyblade War have really <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>dream</b> the player has had ever since turning down Ava's offer to join the Dandelions (although in Unchained χ, it is revealed that the player is actually sent to the Unchained Realm by Ephemer and Skuld) and the two decide to rest after confronting a wall of thorns. On {{the other side of the}} thorns, Maleficent (who is heavily implied to have found the Book of Prophecies) congratulates herself with what she has accomplished whilst wondering where Pete is. Confident that Sora and company cannot meddle in this world, she contemplates on conquering this iteration of her home world that she has entered in.|$|E
25|$|Twain's next venture was {{a work of}} {{straight}} fiction that he called Personal Recollections of Joan of Arc and dedicated to his wife. He had long {{said that this was}} the work that he was most proud of, despite the criticism that he received for it. The book had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>dream</b> of his since childhood, and he claimed that he had found a manuscript detailing the life of Joan of Arc when he was an adolescent. This was another piece that he was convinced would save his publishing company. His financial adviser Henry Huttleston Rogers quashed that idea and got Twain out of that business altogether, but the book was published nonetheless.|$|E

25|$|In the Mark Millar penned Fantastic Four 566-569, Doom {{received}} a significant power upgrade. He was thrown {{back in time}} (perhaps about 50million years) by the Marquis of Death. Doom then fought through time and space {{to get back to}} the present to seek revenge on the Marquis of Death. Doom stated, as he killed the Marquis, he had rebuilt every molecule of his being and increased his power all to destroy the Marquis. In later issues, this seems to have been ignored, however, with writers treating Doctor Doom the way they have always before in terms of power, the arc later retroactively being said to have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>dream</b> had by Valeria Richards.|$|E
25|$|The Graf Zeppelin {{made another}} {{groundbreaking}} flight in July 1931 with a research {{trip to the}} Arctic (Polarfahrt 1931). This adventure had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>dream</b> of Count Zeppelin 20 years earlier but could not be realized at the time due to the outbreak of World War I. The idea of using an airship to explore the Arctic was one reason used to justify both the building of Graf Zeppelin, and the restoration of Germany's right to build airships for commercial purposes. A year earlier Dr. Eckener had piloted the Graf on a three-day trip to Norway and Spitsbergen in July 1930 {{in order to determine}} its performance in this region. This was followed shortly thereafter by a three-day flight to Iceland. Both trips were completed without technical problems.|$|E
25|$|Bournonville {{must have}} had the folk songs Elveskud (The Elf-shot) and Elvehøj (The Elves' Hill) {{in mind when he}} has Junker Ove linger at the hill after lunch with Miss Birthe, his fiancée, only to dream of another - a {{beautiful}} and gentle Hilda, the counter-image of Birthe. It is always at this point - the moment of doubt before a wedding - that the elves appear. For the young man in the folksong Elveskud, the encounter proves fatal. He refuses to dance with the elf girl and her punishment is so harsh that he dies. He is laid in his grave on his wedding day, followed by his fiancée and his mother. In Elvehøj, which is of a later date than Elveskud, it is God who has human fate in his hands. He lets the cock crow at dawn and the young man, who had slept by the hill, wakes from his spell (which turns out to have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>dream)</b> and he counts himself lucky. The manager of the Royal Theatre, J.L. Heiberg - who Bournonville fell out with on numerous occasions during this period because he thought that Heiberg was trying to drive the ballet off the stage - had experienced great success with his Elvehøj, which in Biedermeier style, lets the elves' dance dissolve into dream and delusion.|$|E

[...] In the mid-60s Smith was {{temporarily}} fired from the Grand Ole Opry for not being on the show for twenty six weeks out of the year, which was the required amount of weeks to stay a member at the time.

500|$|It {{had long}} <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>dream</b> in the Scrubs writer's room to do a musical episode. Scrubs creator Bill Lawrence is a self-confessed musical theatre [...] "nerd," [...] as {{are many of}} the writers. In addition, many of the cast members have had {{backgrounds}} in musical theatre.

I knew Zach [...] loved musical theater. I had actually seen Ken Jenkins in Big River on Broadway when I was a kid. Neil Flynn and John C.

500|$|In April, Farmer played {{shooting}} guard for the North {{team in the}} Kentucky Derby Festival Classic. He scored 14 points on 5 of 12 shooting and grabbed 3 rebounds, but his team lost to the South team 134125. Among his teammates in the Classic was Kentucky signee Sean Woods, who told the Lexington Herald-Leader that he and Farmer had become good friends and that he hoped Farmer would choose {{to play for the}} Wildcats. The paper also reported that Farmer had narrowed his list of potential college choices to three: Western Kentucky, LSU, and Kentucky. Farmer took an official visit to Western Kentucky the weekend of April 9, 1988, but on April 14, {{the second day of the}} April signing period, he held a press conference at his high school gymnasium to announce that he had signed a National Letter of Intent with Kentucky.

500|$|Chambers {{was named}} in the British squad for the 2012 London Olympics after the {{selectors}} took into account his trials win and his times from the previous year. Given the abrupt turnaround in his fortunes, he said: [...] "For me representing my country in an Olympics is a privilege that should never be taken for granted. To {{be given the opportunity}} to do so in my home town has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>dream</b> that at times has seemed very distant and is now a reality." [...] He returned to the British relay team at the 2012 European Athletics Championships after a six-year absence but a botched baton change saw the team disqualified. At the Olympics he won his 100 metres heat in a season's best of 10.02seconds, with a legal 2.0m/s following wind, in his first Olympic race in twelve years. He was drawn in the same semi-final as Usain Bolt but Chambers' run of 10.05 seconds for fourth meant he did not make the final. His Olympics came to an end in the 4×100 metres relay heats as the British team made an illegal baton exchange.|$|E
500|$|With {{the help}} of the monkey, Katy builds a cat toy which she uses to {{distract}} the tiger who ate her boyfriend earlier in the video. She lures it into an area of the jungle, and traps it inside. She comes face-to-face with the tiger {{and the two of them}} roar at each other, until her roar tames the tiger as it sits in front of her submissively. Afterwards, she is shown sitting on a giant grass throne, wearing a flower crown as the rest of the jungle animals sit around her, including the tiger, monkey and elephant. The tiger is shown wearing a collar that says [...] "Kitty Purry", a reference to her real-life cat of the same name. Katy takes selfies with the monkey on her boyfriend's phone, applies lipstick made from berry juice, and gives the elephant a pedicure. She then awakens from sleeping in the plane, leading the viewer to think all the previous events have just <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>dream,</b> but walks out of the plane still in the jungle, stretching her arms and yawning with the animals sitting around her.|$|E
500|$|First off, Pausch {{explained}} {{his dream of}} being in zero gravity. As a child, this had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>dream</b> inspired by Apollo 11, and had stayed with him as an adult. When he was the computer science professor at Carnegie Mellon, he learned of a program that NASA has that allows college students to go {{up into the air}} in NASA's Vomit Comet, which uses parabolic arcs to simulate the feeling of weightlessness. Faculty members were not allowed to go (Pausch called this a [...] "brick wall" [...] he faced), so he had to present himself as a web journalist, because local media was allowed on. Pausch proceeded to begin talking about his second childhood dream, playing in the National Football League. Although Pausch was never a player in the National Football League, he spoke about his childhood experiences with Pop Warner Football and how they had affected his life and taught him lessons. Pausch then moved on to his dream of publishing an article in the World Book Encyclopedia. As a child, Pausch always kept and read a World Book Encyclopedia in his home. As he progressed into a career, {{he became one of the}} leading professors in the field of virtual reality. World Book then called Pausch, interested in him writing for the encyclopedia. Currently, the article [...] "virtual reality" [...] in the World Book Encyclopedia is the one authored by Pausch.|$|E
