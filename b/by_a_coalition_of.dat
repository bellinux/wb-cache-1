5|$|Domnitor Cuza was {{ultimately}} ousted <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>coalition</b> <b>of</b> Conservatives and Liberals in February 1866; following {{a period of}} transition and maneuvers to avert international objections, a perpetually unified Principality of Romania was established under Carol of Hohenzollern, with {{the adoption of the}} 1866 Constitution. Two years later, in recognition of his scholarly contributions, Kogălniceanu {{became a member of the}} newly created Romanian Academy Historical Section.|$|E
5|$|The Magyars (or Hungarians), who {{had lived}} on the Pontic steppe for decades, invaded the Carpathian Basin after their defeat <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>coalition</b> <b>of</b> Bulgarians and Pechenegs about 895 AD. Byzantine Emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus wrote that the seven Magyar tribes formed a {{confederation}} with the Kabars. Although the Kabars had originally lived in the Khazar Khaganate, they rebelled against the Khazars and joined the Magyars on the Pontic steppe.|$|E
5|$|During the {{elections}} of 1866, Heliade Rădulescu won {{a seat in the}} Chamber as a deputy for the city of Târgovişte. As Cuza had been ousted from power <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>coalition</b> <b>of</b> political groupings, he was the only Wallachian deputy to join Nicolae Ionescu and other disciples of Simion Bărnuţiu in opposing the appointment of Carol of Hohenzollern as Domnitor and a proclamation stressing the perpetuity of the Moldo-Wallachian union. Speaking in Parliament, he likened the adoption of foreign rule to the Phanariote period. The opposition was nevertheless weak, and the resolution was passed with a large majority.|$|E

5|$|In 1700 Sweden was {{attacked}} <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>coalition</b> <b>of</b> Saxony, Russia, and Denmark–Norway. Saxony, under Augustus II, invaded Swedish oversea dominions in Livonia and quickly attacked {{the city of}} Riga. Meanwhile, Frederick IV of Denmark attacked the Swedish allied duchies of Holstein and Gottorp {{in order to secure}} his rear, before commencing with the planned invasion of Scania, which had been previously annexed by Sweden in the Treaty of Roskilde in 1658. A short time later, Russia under Peter I swept into Swedish Ingria and besieged the strategic city of Narva. Unprepared for these developments, the Swedes were forced into a war on three fronts.|$|E
5|$|The Magyars, {{settled in}} the Pontic-Caspian steppe by the 830s, began a westward {{migration}} after their defeat <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>coalition</b> <b>of</b> Pechenegs and Bulgarians in about 895. They crossed the Carpathian Mountains, invading the surrounding area. Gelou is a local ruler described in the Gesta Hungarorum as an opponent of the invading Magyars. Anonymus did not write about Simeon I of Bulgaria, Svatopluk I of Moravia or other opponents known from contemporary sources, instead chronicling Magyar battles with local rulers (including Gelou, Menumorut and Salan) not mentioned in other primary sources.|$|E
5|$|Cross was a Liberal, {{and fast}} {{established}} himself {{was one of}} the party's leading Edmonton lights. By some assessments, he was the second most influential Liberal in the city after Frank Oliver, the owner of the Edmonton Bulletin and local Member of Parliament. Once {{the decision was made to}} create the province of Alberta, the question emerged of who would govern it: the Northwest Territories were governed on a non-partisan basis by Premier Frederick W. A. G. Haultain, who was a Conservative in federal politics. Some Liberals, such as Peter Talbot, were amenable to Haultain's becoming the first Premier of Alberta, either as the head of a non-partisan government or one formed <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>coalition</b> <b>of</b> Liberals and Conservatives. Cross was not among them.|$|E
50|$|The 2009 Bundestag {{elections}} led to {{a change}} in government, as the incumbent grand <b>coalition</b> <b>of</b> CDU/CSU and SPD was replaced <b>by</b> <b>a</b> center-right <b>coalition</b> <b>of</b> CDU/CSU and FDP.|$|R
25|$|Since early 2009 Basdeo Panday was {{challenged}} for {{the leadership of}} the party <b>by</b> <b>a</b> small <b>coalition</b> <b>of</b> Opposition MPs led by the party's deputy political leader, Warner and Maharaj.|$|R

5|$|In early 1321, Lancaster mobilised a {{coalition}} of the Despensers' enemies across the Marcher territories. Edward and Hugh the Younger became aware of these plans in March and headed west, hoping that negotiations led by the moderate Earl of Pembroke would defuse the crisis. This time, Pembroke made his excuses and declined to intervene, and war broke out in May. The Despensers' lands were quickly seized <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>coalition</b> <b>of</b> the Marcher Lords and the local gentry, and Lancaster held a high-level gathering of the barons and clergy in June which condemned the Despensers for having broken the Ordinances. Edward attempted reconciliation, but in July the opposition occupied London and called for the permanent removal of the Despensers. Fearing {{that he might be}} deposed if he refused, Edward agreed to exile the Despensers and pardoned the Marcher Lords for their actions.|$|E
5|$|The Chief Minister {{is elected}} by the Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) and selects colleagues to serve as ministers {{alongside}} him or her in the Executive, known informally as the cabinet. Whereas the ACT has federally been dominated by Labor, the Liberals {{have been able to}} gain some footing in the ACT Legislative Assembly, and were in government for just over eight of the Assembly's 25-year history, mostly during a period of six and half years from 1995 and 2001, when Labor won power. At the 2004 election the Australian Labor Party, headed by then Chief Minister Jon Stanhope, won nine of the 17 seats and formed the ACT's first majority government, but after the 2008 election was forced into minority government {{with the support of the}} Greens. Since the 2012 elections, the ACT has been governed <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>coalition</b> <b>of</b> Labor and the Greens.|$|E
5|$|The Napoleonic Wars were {{therefore}} ones in which Britain invested {{large amounts of}} capital and resources to win. French ports were blockaded by the Royal Navy, which won a decisive victory over a Franco-Spanish fleet at Trafalgar in 1805. Overseas colonies were attacked and occupied, {{including those of the}} Netherlands, which was annexed by Napoleon in 1810. France was finally defeated <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>coalition</b> <b>of</b> European armies in 1815. Britain was again the beneficiary of peace treaties: France ceded the Ionian Islands, Malta (which it had occupied in 1797 and 1798 respectively), Mauritius, Saint Lucia, and Tobago; Spain ceded Trinidad; the Netherlands Guyana, and the Cape Colony. Britain returned Guadeloupe, Martinique, French Guiana, and Réunion to France, and Java and Suriname to the Netherlands, while gaining control of Ceylon (1795–1815).|$|E
50|$|In 1874 Allen {{was elected}} to the United States House of Representatives, {{defeating}} incumbent Republican Walter L. Sessions <b>by</b> organizing <b>a</b> <b>coalition</b> <b>of</b> Democrats and former Liberal Republicans who had supported Horace Greeley for President in 1872.|$|R

5|$|The War of the Fifth Coalition {{was fought}} in 1809 <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>coalition</b> <b>of</b> the Austrian Empire and the United Kingdom against Napoleon's French Empire and Bavaria. Major engagements between France and Austria, the main participants, {{unfolded}} {{over much of}} Central Europe from April to July, with very high casualty rates for both sides. Britain, already involved on the European continent in the ongoing Peninsular War, sent another expedition, the Walcheren Campaign, to the Netherlands in order to relieve the Austrians, although this effort had little impact {{on the outcome of}} the conflict. After much campaigning in Bavaria and across the Danube valley, the war ended favourably for the French after the bloody struggle at Wagram in early July.|$|E
5|$|The {{exact number}} of {{casualties}} is unknown. There are different numbers that each derive from different investigations that used different definitions of what a victim in this case should be. Therefore, the numbers are hardly comparable. On top of that, some results are published infrequently or investigations were ceased with a provisional number. There is also a publicly held controversy between two groups regarding the number of victims. The opponents are the Arbeitsgemeinschaft 13. August and the ZZF. The former's numbers are higher, as they include, according to ZZF's Hans-Hermann Hertle, victims with an unclear or unsure connection to the border regime. After the ZZF published its interim results in August 2006, Alexandra Hildebrandt of the Arbeitsgemeinschaft has accused them of withholding numbers to invoke a more positive picture of East Germany. She argues that the ZZF project was funded <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>coalition</b> <b>of</b> social democrats and leftists.|$|E
