5|$|Neurophysiologists {{study the}} chemical, pharmacological, and {{electrical}} {{properties of the}} brain: their primary tools are drugs and recording devices. Thousands of experimentally developed drugs affect the nervous system, some in highly specific ways. Recordings of <b>brain</b> <b>activity</b> can be made using electrodes, either glued to the scalp as in EEG studies, or implanted inside the brains of animals for extracellular recordings, which can detect action potentials generated by individual neurons. Because the brain does not contain pain receptors, it is possible using these techniques to record <b>brain</b> <b>activity</b> from animals that are awake and behaving without causing distress. The same techniques have occasionally been used to study <b>brain</b> <b>activity</b> in human patients suffering from intractable epilepsy, in cases {{where there was a}} medical necessity to implant electrodes to localize the brain area responsible for epileptic seizures. Functional imaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging are also used to study brain activity; these techniques have mainly been used with human subjects, because they require a conscious subject to remain motionless for long periods of time, but they have the great advantage of being noninvasive.|$|E
5|$|Sleep {{involves}} great {{changes in}} <b>brain</b> <b>activity.</b> Until the 1950s {{it was generally}} believed that the brain essentially shuts off during sleep, but this is now known to be far from true; activity continues, but patterns become very different. There {{are two types of}} sleep: REM sleep (with dreaming) and NREM (non-REM, usually without dreaming) sleep, which repeat in slightly varying patterns throughout a sleep episode. Three broad types of distinct <b>brain</b> <b>activity</b> patterns can be measured: REM, light NREM and deep NREM. During deep NREM sleep, also called slow wave sleep, activity in the cortex takes the form of large synchronized waves, whereas in the waking state it is noisy and desynchronized. Levels of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and serotonin drop during slow wave sleep, and fall almost to zero during REM sleep; levels of acetylcholine show the reverse pattern.|$|E
40|$|Pain is {{a highly}} {{subjective}} experience. Self-report is {{the gold standard for}} pain assessment in clinical practice, {{but it may not be}} available or reliable in some populations. Neuroimaging data, such as electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), have the potential to be used to provide physiology-based and quantitative nociceptive pain assessment tools that complements self-report. However, existing neuroimaging-based nociceptive pain assessments only rely on the information in pain-evoked <b>brain</b> <b>activities,</b> but neglect the fact that the perceived intensity of pain is also encoded by ongoing <b>brain</b> <b>activities</b> prior to painful stimulation. Here, we proposed to use machine learning algorithms to decode pain intensity from both pre-stimulus ongoing and post-stimulus evoked <b>brain</b> <b>activities.</b> Neural features that were correlated with intensity of laser-evoked nociceptive pain were extracted from high-dimensional pre- and post-stimulus EEG and fMRI activities using partial least-squares regression (PLSR). Further, we used support vector machine (SVM) to predict the intensity of pain from pain-related time-frequency EEG patterns and BOLD-fMRI patterns. Results showed that combining predictive information in pre- and post-stimulus <b>brain</b> <b>activities</b> can achieve significantly better performance in classifying high-pain and low-pain and in predicting the rating of perceived pain than only using post-stimulus <b>brain</b> <b>activities.</b> Therefore, the proposed pain prediction method holds great potential in basic research and clinical applications. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

5|$|Almost {{all animals}} {{are capable of}} modifying their {{behavior}} {{as a result of}} experience—even the most primitive types of worms. Because behavior is driven by <b>brain</b> <b>activity,</b> changes in behavior must somehow correspond to changes inside the brain. Already in the late 19th century theorists like Santiago Ramón y Cajal argued that the most plausible explanation is that learning and memory are expressed as changes in the synaptic connections between neurons. Until 1970, however, experimental evidence to support the synaptic plasticity hypothesis was lacking. In 1971 Tim Bliss and Terje Lømo published a paper on a phenomenon now called long-term potentiation: the paper showed clear evidence of activity-induced synaptic changes that lasted for at least several days. Since then technical advances have made these sorts of experiments much easier to carry out, and thousands of studies have been made that have clarified the mechanism of synaptic change, and uncovered other types of activity-driven synaptic change in a variety of brain areas, including the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, basal ganglia, and cerebellum. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and physical activity appear to play a beneficial role in the process.|$|E

30|$|Understanding the {{organization}} of brain function has received significant interest since the establishment of neuroscience. During the past two decades, {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI), which is an in vivo neuroimaging technique, has revolutionized the functional mapping of the brain [1 – 8]. Specifically, task-based fMRI (tfMRI) has been widely used to record functional <b>brain</b> <b>activities</b> during a specific task performance and further to identify brain regions that are functionally involved in the task performance [2, 4, 5]. Meanwhile, resting state fMRI (rsfMRI) has also received intense interest more recently to acquire <b>brain</b> <b>activities</b> while participants are in a task-free state. The coherence in the functional brain organization which is free from the task performance constraint can be reflected based on the spontaneous signal changes during resting state [1, 3 – 8].|$|R
5|$|<b>Brain</b> <b>activity</b> is made {{possible}} by the interconnections of neurons that are linked together to reach their targets. A neuron consists of a cell body, axon, and dendrites. Dendrites are often extensive branches that receive information in the form of signals from the axon terminals of other neurons. The signals received may cause the neuron to initiate an action potential (an electrochemical signal or nerve impulse) which is sent along its axon to the axon terminal, to connect with the dendrites or with the cell body of another neuron. An action potential is initiated at the initial segment of an axon, which contains a complex of proteins. When an action potential, reaches the axon terminal it triggers the release of a neurotransmitter at a synapse that propagates a signal that acts on the target cell. These chemical neurotransmitters include dopamine, serotonin, GABA, glutamate, and acetylcholine. GABA is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain, and glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter. Neurons link at synapses to form pathways and elaborate neural networks, and the activity between them is driven by the process of neurotransmission.|$|E
5|$|Doubt {{about the}} {{possibility}} of a mechanistic explanation of thought drove René Descartes, and most other philosophers along with him, to dualism: the belief that the mind is to some degree independent of the brain. There has always, however, been a strong argument in the opposite direction. There is clear empirical evidence that physical manipulations of, or injuries to, the brain (for example by drugs or by lesions, respectively) can affect the mind in potent and intimate ways. In the 19th century, the case of Phineas Gage, a railway worker who was injured by a stout iron rod passing through his brain, convinced both researchers and the public that cognitive functions were localised in the brain. Following this line of thinking, a large body of empirical evidence for a close relationship between <b>brain</b> <b>activity</b> and mental activity has led most neuroscientists and contemporary philosophers to be materialists, believing that mental phenomena are ultimately the result of, or reducible to, physical phenomena.|$|E
5|$|In October 2008, new {{insights}} into the effect of Internet usage on cognition were gleaned from the results, reported in a press release, of a study conducted by UCLA's Memory and Aging Research Center that had tested two groups of people between the ages of 55 and 76 years old; only one group of which were experienced web users. While they had read books or performed assigned search tasks their <b>brain</b> <b>activity</b> had been monitored with functional MRI scans, which revealed that both reading and web search utilize the same language, reading, memory, and visual regions of the brain; however, it was discovered that those searching the web stimulated additional decision-making and complex reasoning regions of the brain, with a two-fold increase in these regions in experienced web users compared with inexperienced web users. Gary Small, the director of the UCLA center and lead investigator of the UCLA study, concurrently released the book iBrain: Surviving the Technological Alteration of the Modern Mind, co-authored with Gigi Vorgan, with the press release.|$|E
40|$|Functional brain imaging has {{revealed}} {{two types of}} dynamic patterns of brain in the resting-state: the dynamics of spontaneous <b>brain</b> <b>activities</b> and the dynamics of functional interconnections between spontaneous <b>brain</b> <b>activities.</b> Although {{these two types of}} brain dynamics are usually investigated separately in the literature, recent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have shown that they exhibit similar spatial patterns, suggesting the dynamics of spontaneous <b>brain</b> <b>activities</b> and the dynamics of their interconnections are associated with each other. In this study, we characterized the local blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) dynamics and the functional connectivity dynamics (FCD) in the resting-state, and then investigated their between-region associations. Time-varying FC was estimated as time-varying correlation coefficients using a sliding-window method, and the temporal variability of BOLD and time-varying FC were used to quantify the BOLD dynamics and the FCD, respectively. Our results showed that the BOLD dynamics and the FCD exhibit similar spatial patterns, and they are significantly associated across brain regions. Importantly, such associations are opposite for different types of FC (e. g., within-network FCD are negatively correlated with the BOLD dynamics but the between-network FCD are positively correlated with the BOLD dynamics), and they are spatially heterogeneous across brain networks. The identified heterogeneous associations between the BOLD dynamics and the FCD appear to convey related or even distinct information and might underscore the potential mechanism of brain coordination and co-evolution...|$|R

In philosophy, phenomenology has largely been devoted to fundamental metaphysical questions, such as the nature of intentionality ("aboutness"). In psychology, phenomenology largely has meant attempting to investigate consciousness using the method of introspection, which means looking into one's own mind and reporting what one observes.

Taylor utilizes neurological science to show that brainwashed individuals have more rigid pathways, and that rigidity can make it unlikely that the individual will rethink situations or be able to later reorganize these pathways.
