He expanded on the teaching they had received from the Foundling Hospital in reading and basic arithmetic, and also taught them how to write. He believed that the girls should <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>manage</b> the house, so they were charged with cooking and cleaning as well as other housework. Finally, he {{wanted to be able to}} debate complex concepts with them, so he taught them rudimentary theories in physics and geography, tasking them with observing the changing of the seasons, and recording details of sunrises and sunsets. He also imparted to them Rousseau's philosophical contempt for luxury.|$|E
5|$|Males {{engage in}} mate {{guarding}} {{during the period}} females are most vulnerable to successful extra pair copulations. They usually stay close to their social mate, singing slowly {{on the side and}} following the mate while she is foraging or searching for a nesting site. The guarding behavior, though, may conflict with males’ pursuit of extra-pair fertilizations. It is not yet clear to what extent a male will prefer mate guarding over extra-pair fertilizations. Male retention studies have shown that removal of a male increases the chance of extra-pair offspring in the brood, suggesting that mate guarding reduces extra-pair fertilization attempts. The extra-pair fertilization rate nonetheless cannot be eliminated even if males are allowed to stay near their social mates during fertility risk period. Several hypotheses try to explain this phenomenon: females may <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>manage</b> extra-pair mating even while its social mate is guarding it, or females may reject extra-pair copulation attempts by other males in the absence of male guarding.|$|E

Conditions which significantly compromise the cardiovascular system, respiratory system or central nervous system may be considered absolute or relative contraindications for diving, as are psychological conditions which impair judgement or compromise the ability to deal calmly and systematically with deteriorating conditions which a competent diver should <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>manage.</b>|$|E
25|$|With {{the atomic}} bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the War Office planned for CRUs to accept only Far East {{prisoners of war}} (FEPOWs), based on the {{assumption}} that the CRUs would not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>manage</b> the combined number of POWs from Europe and the Far East and that the FEPOWs were more in need of the service. Wilson and Rendel felt that European POWs should not be denied the opportunity to attend, and went to lengths to expand the programme where possible and make space for both groups. Rendel and Wilson were removed from heading the programme as a result. By the end of March 1947, more than 19,000 European POWs and 4,500 FEPOWs had attended a CRU.|$|E

500|$|In May, it {{was stated}} that the matter would not be handled in the courts, but instead by the Football Association's Tribunal, with the {{possibility}} {{to appeal to the}} Norwegian Confederation of Sports' Tribunal. This was because FIFA's regulations forbade a club form suing their own federation. In January 1995, the tribunal decided that Lyn had the right to purchase the shares for NOK4.4 million plus interest. By February, it became clear that Lyn did not have sufficient liquidity to purchase the shares. In December 1995, three months before the purchase option became invalid, the club bought back the shares. In 2001, it became clear that Lyn had given false information about the deal, and that the club had signed an agreement with Lyn Fotball AS which was later criticized by club members as a [...] "raid" [...] by the investors to secure the main asset in Lyn. The loan had a high interest rate and had clauses that made a refinancing expensive, it gave the investors a right of pre-emption for the shares, the right for the investors to terminate the load on short notice, and the right for the investors to take over the shares should the club not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>manage</b> the debt.|$|E
500|$|On September 12, {{the explorers}} {{resigned}} themselves to wintering {{on the ice}} and camped on a large floe, letting the ice take them where it would, [...] "which", writes Kjellström, [...] "it had really been doing all along" [...] (p.47). Drifting rapidly due south towards Kvitøya, they hurriedly built a winter [...] "home" [...] on the floe against the increasing cold, with walls made of water-reinforced snow to Strindberg's design (see plan, below, left). Observing the rapidity of their drift, Andrée recorded his hopes that they might get far enough south to feed themselves entirely from the sea. However, the floe began to break up directly under the hut on October 2 from the stresses of pressing against Kvitøya, and they were forced to bring their stores on to the island itself, which took a couple of days. [...] "Morale remains good", reports Andrée {{at the very end of}} the coherent part of his diary, which ends: [...] "Med sådana kamrater bör man kunna reda sig under snart sagdt hvilka omständigheter som helst." [...] ("With such comrades one should <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>manage</b> under, I may say, any circumstances".) It is inferred from the incoherent and badly damaged last pages of Andrée's diary that the three men were all dead within a few days of moving onto the island.|$|E
