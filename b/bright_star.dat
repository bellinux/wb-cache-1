5|$|Relative to both {{luminosity}} {{and distance}} from Earth, a star's absolute magnitude (M) and apparent magnitude (m) are not equivalent; for example, the <b>bright</b> <b>star</b> Sirius has an apparent magnitude of −1.44, {{but it has}} an absolute magnitude of +1.41.|$|E
5|$|The {{emergence}} of a woman writing {{in the press and}} composing poetry in this dark era was a significant event. Our recent history shows that it was rare for even men to read and write; her appearance in these dark nights was thus like a <b>bright</b> <b>star</b> {{in the center of the}} heavens.|$|E
5|$|Most {{scenes of}} the video {{take place in a}} large house. Throughout the video, the pair are {{touching}} and kissing with each other, and McKee is shown in the bathtub. In the concluding scenes, she leaves the house and is depicted as a <b>bright</b> <b>star</b> that travels towards the sky, while Cruz {{stands in front of the}} house by the pool.|$|E
25|$|In {{keeping with}} {{the pattern of the}} naming the Algol-class ships after <b>bright</b> <b>stars,</b> the Altair was named after Altair, the <b>brightest</b> <b>star</b> in the {{constellation}} Aquila and the twelfth <b>brightest</b> <b>star</b> in the night sky.|$|R

25|$|In {{keeping with}} {{the pattern of the}} naming the Algol-class ships after <b>bright</b> <b>stars,</b> the Regulus was named after Regulus, the <b>brightest</b> <b>star</b> in the {{constellation}} Leo and one of the <b>brightest</b> <b>stars</b> in the night sky.|$|R
5|$|The {{brightest}} star is the 2.8-magnitude Beta Hydri, also the closest reasonably <b>bright</b> <b>star</b> {{to the south}} celestial pole. Pulsating between magnitude 3.26 and 3.33, Gamma Hydri is a variable red giant 60 times the diameter of our Sun. Lying near it is VW Hydri, {{one of the brightest}} dwarf novae in the heavens. Four star systems in Hydrus have been found to have exoplanets to date, including HD 10180, which could bear up to nine planetary companions.|$|E
5|$|Because the Moon is {{continuously}} blocking {{our view}} of a half-degree-wide circular area of the sky, the related phenomenon of occultation occurs when a <b>bright</b> <b>star</b> or planet passes behind the Moon and is occulted: hidden from view. In this way, a solar eclipse is an occultation of the Sun. Because the Moon is comparatively close to Earth, occultations of individual stars are not visible everywhere on the planet, nor at the same time. Because of the precession of the lunar orbit, each year different stars are occulted.|$|E
5|$|Beta Pictoris {{is a star}} in the {{southern}} constellation of Pictor, the Easel, and is located {{to the west of the}} <b>bright</b> <b>star</b> Canopus. It traditionally marked the sounding line of the ship Argo Navis, before the constellation was split. The star has an apparent visual magnitude of 3.861, so is visible to the naked eye under good conditions, though light pollution may result in stars dimmer than magnitude 3 being too dim to see. It is the second brightest in its constellation, exceeded only by Alpha Pictoris, which has an apparent magnitude of 3.30.|$|E
50|$|Names {{similar to}} Deneb {{were given to}} at least seven {{different}} stars, most notably Deneb Kaitos, the <b>brightest</b> <b>star</b> in the constellation of Cetus; Deneb Algedi, the <b>brightest</b> <b>star</b> in Capricornus; and Denebola, the second <b>brightest</b> <b>star</b> in Leo. All these stars are referring to {{the tail of the}} animals that their respective constellations represent.|$|R
25|$|In {{keeping with}} {{the pattern of the}} naming the Algol-class ships after <b>bright</b> <b>stars,</b> the Antares was named after Antares, the <b>brightest</b> <b>star</b> in the {{constellation}} Scorpius.|$|R
25|$|Greek {{letters are}} used to denote the <b>brighter</b> <b>stars</b> {{within each of the}} eighty-eight constellations. In most constellations the <b>brightest</b> <b>star</b> is {{designated}} Alpha and the next brightest Beta etc. For example, the <b>brightest</b> <b>star</b> in the constellation of Centaurus is known as Alpha Centauri. For historical reasons, the Greek designations of some constellations begin with a lower ranked letter.|$|R
5|$|Follow-up {{observations}} {{were conducted by}} a team of British, Spanish, French, Swiss and American astronomers using the photometer on the James Gregory Telescope in Scotland; using visual comparisons to the nearby <b>bright</b> <b>star</b> HD 80408, the star's light curve was better defined. In combination with measurements of WASP-13's spectrum measured using the SOPHIE échelle spectrograph at the Haute-Provence Observatory in France, the star's radial velocity was also discovered. The Fibre-Fed Echelle Spectrograph on the Nordic Optical Telescope gathered additional measurements of WASP-13's spectrum, allowing astronomers to determine WASP-13's characteristics. Use of SOPHIE's data led to the discovery of the planet WASP-13b in 2008; the planet was reported in 2009.|$|E
5|$|On September 8, 2001, Titania occulted a <b>bright</b> <b>star</b> (HIP106829) with {{a visible}} {{magnitude}} of 7.2; {{this was an}} opportunity to both refine Titania's diameter and ephemeris, and to detect any extant atmosphere. The data revealed no atmosphere to a surface pressure of 1–2 mPa (10–20 nbar); if it exists, {{it would have to be}} far thinner than that of Triton or Pluto. This upper limit is still several times higher than the maximum possible surface pressure of the carbon dioxide, meaning that the measurements place essentially no constraints on parameters of the atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{convention}} designates {{the cooler}} star as component Aa and its spectral type has been usually measured between G2 and K0. The hotter secondary Ab {{has been given}} various spectral types of late (cooler) F or early (warmer) G.The MK spectral types of the two stars have been measured a number of times, and they are both consistently assigned a luminosity class of III indicating a giant star. The composite spectrum appears {{to be dominated by}} the primary star due to its sharper absorption lines; the lines from the secondary are broadened and blurred by its rapid rotation. The most recent specific published types are K0III and G1III, although older values are still widely quoted such as G5IIIe + G0III from the <b>Bright</b> <b>Star</b> Catalogue or G8III + G0III by Eggen. Where the context is clear, these two components have been referred to as A and B.|$|E
50|$|Epsilon Canis Majoris (ε Canis Majoris, {{abbreviated}} Epsilon CMa, ε CMa), {{also named}} Adhara, is a binary star and, despite being designated 'epsilon', the second <b>brightest</b> <b>star</b> {{in the constellation}} of Canis Major {{and one of the}} <b>brightest</b> <b>stars</b> in the night sky. About 4.7 million years ago, it was the <b>brightest</b> <b>star</b> in the sky, with an apparent magnitude of -3.99.|$|R

25|$|In systems {{where the}} brightnesses are different, the fainter star is bluer if the <b>brighter</b> <b>star</b> {{is a giant}} star, and redder if the <b>brighter</b> <b>star</b> belongs to the main sequence.|$|R
5|$|The Solar System {{is located}} in the Milky Way, a barred spiral galaxy with a {{diameter}} of about 100,000 light-years containing about 100 billion stars. The Sun resides in one of the Milky Way's outer spiral arms, known as the Orion–Cygnus Arm or Local Spur. The Sun lies between 25,000 and 28,000 light-years from the Galactic Centre, and its speed within the Milky Way is about 220km/s, so that it completes one revolution every 225–250 million years. This revolution is known as the Solar System's galactic year. The solar apex, the direction of the Sun's path through interstellar space, is near the constellation Hercules {{in the direction of the}} current location of the <b>bright</b> <b>star</b> Vega. The plane of the ecliptic lies at an angle of about 60° to the galactic plane.|$|E
5|$|Using {{a program}} called Blendanal, similar to the Blender {{technique}} used to verify the planets discovered by Kepler, the astronomers observing HAT-P-33 hoped to rule out false positive alternatives that could explain the planet-like signal seen in HAT-P-33's light curve and radial velocity. The use of Blendanal ruled out the possibilities that the signal was caused by that of a hierarchical triple star or a mixture between a <b>bright</b> <b>star</b> and a binary star in the background. The possibility that HAT-P-33 is actually a binary star whose secondary companion is too dim to be distinguishable from the brighter star could not be ruled out. However, the data indicated that the planet HAT-P-33b did indeed exist.|$|E
5|$|Beta Hydri, the {{brightest}} star in Hydrus, is a yellow star of apparent magnitude 2.8, lying 24 light-years from Earth. It has about 104% of the mass of the Sun and 181% of the Sun's radius, with {{more than three times the}} Sun's luminosity. The spectrum of this star matches a stellar classification of G2IV, with the luminosity class of 'IV' indicating this is a subgiant star. As such, it is a slightly more evolved star than the Sun, with the supply of hydrogen fuel at its core becoming exhausted. It is the nearest subgiant star to the Sun and one of the oldest stars in the solar neighbourhood. Thought to be between 6.4 and 7.1 billion years old, this star bears some resemblance to what the Sun may look like in the far distant future, making it an object of interest to astronomers. It is also the closest <b>bright</b> <b>star</b> to the south celestial pole.|$|E
25|$|In {{keeping with}} {{the pattern of the}} naming the Algol-class ships after <b>bright</b> <b>stars,</b> the Capella was named after Capella, the <b>brightest</b> <b>star</b> in the {{constellation}} Auriga, the sixth brightest in the night sky.|$|R
50|$|Lambda Scorpii (λ Scorpii, {{abbreviated}} Lambda Sco, λ Sco), {{also named}} Shaula, is (despite being designated 'Lambda') the second <b>brightest</b> <b>star</b> {{system in the}} constellation of Scorpius, {{and one of the}} <b>brightest</b> <b>stars</b> in the nighttime sky.|$|R
50|$|V533 Carinae is the <b>brightest</b> <b>star</b> in the region. The other <b>bright</b> <b>stars</b> in NGC 3572 are hot {{young stars}} such as HD 97166 and all the {{clusters}} {{in the region are}} only a few million years old.|$|R
5|$|Gamma-ray bursts {{are very}} bright as {{observed}} from Earth despite their typically immense distances. An average long GRB has a bolometric flux comparable to a <b>bright</b> <b>star</b> {{of our galaxy}} despite a distance of billions of light years (compared to a few tens of light years for most visible stars). Most of this energy is released in gamma rays, although some GRBs have extremely luminous optical counterparts as well. GRB 080319B, for example, was accompanied by an optical counterpart that peaked at a visible magnitude of 5.8, {{comparable to that of}} the dimmest naked-eye stars despite the burst's distance of 7.5 billion light years. This combination of brightness and distance implies an extremely energetic source. Assuming the gamma-ray explosion to be spherical, the energy output of GRB 080319B would be within a factor of two of the rest-mass energy of the Sun (the energy which would be released were the Sun to be converted entirely into radiation).|$|E
5|$|Zeta Persei is the third-brightest {{star in the}} {{constellation}} at magnitude 2.86. Around 750 light-years from Earth, it is a blue-white supergiant 26–27 times the radius of the Sun and 47,000 times its luminosity. It is the brightest star (as seen from Earth) of a moving group of bright blue-white giant and supergiant stars, the Perseus OB2 Association or Zeta Persei Association. Zeta is a triple star system, with a companion blue-white main sequence star of spectral type B8 and apparent magnitude 9.16 around 3900 AU distant from the primary, and a white main sequence star of magnitude 9.90 and spectral type A2, some 50,000 AU away, {{that may or may}} not be gravitationally bound to the other two. X Persei is a double system in this association; one component is a hot, <b>bright</b> <b>star</b> and the other is a neutron star. With an apparent magnitude of 6.72, it is too dim to be seen with the naked eye even in perfectly dark conditions. The system is an X-ray source and the primary star appears to be undergoing substantial mass loss. Once thought to be a member of the Perseus OB2 Association, Omicron Persei is a multiple star system with a combined visual magnitude of 3.85. It is composed of two blue-white starsa giant of spectral class B1.5 and main sequence star of B3which orbit each other every 4.5 days and are distorted into ovoids due to their small separation. The system has a third star about which little is known. At an estimated distance of 1475 light-years from Earth, the system is now thought to lie too far from the center of the Zeta Persei group to belong to it.|$|E

50|$|The arms appear {{brighter}} {{because there}} are more young stars (hence more massive, <b>bright</b> <b>stars).</b> These massive, <b>bright</b> <b>stars</b> also die out quickly, which would leave just the darker background stellar distribution behind the waves, hence making the waves visible.|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION The <b>brightest</b> <b>stars</b> in galaxies {{have been}} used as {{distance}} indicators since Hubble(1936). However, the accuracy of the <b>brightest</b> <b>stars</b> for distance estimates has been controversial. Recently, Rozanski and RowanRobinson (1994) argued large errors in the distance determination : 0. 58 mag and 0. 90 mag, respectively, for the <b>brightest</b> red <b>stars</b> and the <b>brightest</b> blue <b>stars,</b> while Karachentsev and Tikhonov(1994) suggested much smaller errors in the distance determination : 0. 37 mag for the <b>brightest</b> red <b>stars</b> and 0. 46 mag for the <b>brightest</b> blue <b>stars.</b> The reasons for these conflicting results are not yet known. We have investigated the accuracy of this method using a sample of 17 galaxies(LMC, SMC, NGC 6822, IC 1613, M 31, IC 10, M 33, WLM, NGC 3109, Sextans B, Sextans A, NGC 300, LeoA, NGC 2403, M 81, IC 4182, M 101) for which Cepheid distances are known and reliable photometry of the <b>brightest</b> <b>stars</b> are available (Figure 1).
