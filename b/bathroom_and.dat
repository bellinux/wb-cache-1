Wegman admits that he sabotaged the UFO, but maintains that he only tried to merely disable the stealth module so that Mulder could see it. Wegman gives Fletcher, who he thinks is Mulder, the proof of the encounter, a flight data recorder in a paper bag. Meanwhile, Mulder leaves and talks to Scully in the car. Later, Mulder and Fletcher meet in the bar's <b>bathroom</b> <b>and</b> argue about the flight data recorder. As they argue, General Wegman enters the <b>bathroom</b> <b>and</b> discovers the two.
