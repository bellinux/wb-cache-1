5|$|As is {{discussed}} below, {{the reason for}} the delay was probably simply that neither the Athenians nor the Persians were willing to risk battle initially. This then raises the question of why the battle occurred when it did. Herodotus explicitly tells us that the Greeks attacked the Persians (and the other sources confirm this), {{but it is not clear}} why they did this <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>arrival</b> of the Spartans. There are two main theories to explain this.|$|E
5|$|Because adult great spotted kiwis {{are large}} and powerful, {{they are able to}} fend off most predators that attack them, such as stoats, ferrets, weasels, pigs, brush possums and cats, all of which are {{invasive}} species in New Zealand. However, dogs are able to kill even adults. Stoats, ferrets, possums, cats and dogs will feed on the eggs and chicks, meaning most chicks die within their first five months of life. <b>Before</b> <b>the</b> <b>arrival</b> of mammalian predators, the great spotted kiwi's natural predators would have been birds of prey like the extinct Haast's eagle and Eyles' harrier and the extant Swamp harrier.|$|E
5|$|<b>Before</b> <b>the</b> <b>arrival</b> of Euro-Americans in the 19thcentury, the John Day basin was {{frequented by}} Sahaptin people who hunted, fished, and {{gathered}} roots and berries in the region. After road-building made the valley more accessible, settlers established farms, ranches, {{and a few}} small towns along the river and its tributaries. Paleontologists have been unearthing and studying the fossils in the region since 1864, when Thomas Condon, a missionary and amateur geologist, recognized their importance and made them known globally. Parts of the basin became a National Monument in 1975.|$|E

5|$|Consequently, Ryholt {{suggests}} that Sheshi {{was actually a}} 14th Dynasty ruler, the 14th Dynasty being a line of kings of Canaanite descent possibly ruling over the Eastern Nile Delta immediately <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>arrival</b> of the Hyksos 15th Dynasty. Many Egyptologists accept {{the existence of the}} 14th Dynasty based on archaeological evidence and on the fact that circa 50 kings are recorded in the Turin canon between the 13th Dynasty and the later Hyksos rulers. At the opposite, Redford proposed that these 50 kings constitute the genealogy of the Hyksos rulers and that the 14th Dynasty is chimerical.|$|E

The Fatimids, under the nominal rule of caliph al-Musta'li but actually controlled by vizier al-Afdal Shahanshah, had lost Jerusalem to the Seljuqs in 1073 (although some older accounts say 1076); they recaptured it in 1098 from the Artuqids, a smaller Turkish tribe associated with the Seljuqs, just <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>arrival</b> of the crusaders.|$|E
