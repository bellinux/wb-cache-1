40|$|Includes bibliography. The ⁵¹V(n,d) ⁵⁰Ti {{reaction}} {{has been}} studied with neutrons of energy of 21. 6 MeV. The measurement of the angular distribution of the differential cross section was made {{with the aid of}} a spectrometer designed by Dr. McMurray and Prof K. Bharuth - Ram. The spectrometer consists of three multiwire proportional counters followed by a curved plastic scintillator. The proportional counters act as ΔE detectors and the scintillator acts as an energy detector. The ΔE - E method based on the <b>Bethe</b> - <b>Bloch</b> <b>formula</b> was used for particle identification. The spectrometer allows accumulation of data over an angle range of ≥ 70 °, has angular resolution (FWHM) ≈ 5 ° and energy resolution (FWHM) ≈ 0. 8 MeV. A review of the optical model and the reaction mechanism is presented. Theoretical DWBA cross sections are performed by using the Distorted Waves code DWUCK 4. Spectroscopic factors for transitions to the 0 ⁺, 2 ⁺ and (4 ⁺, 6 ⁺) states in ⁵⁰Ti have been determined from the comparison of experimental differential cross sections to theoretical DWBA differential cross sections. These have a mean value of 0. 42, 0. 30 and 0. 38 respectively. The spectroscopic factors are compared with the results from (e,e' p) and (d,³He) measurements and shell model calculations...|$|R

To describe the deviation one usually uses a modified power law T^α with a size dependent exponent α, which is motivated simply by its flexibility in fitting the observed behavior. By considering the Heisenberg spin model we derive an explicit expression {{in terms of a}} magnon gas which generalizes the <b>Bloch</b> <b>formula</b> to a finite size system. Comparison to the experimental data shows a good agreement with the observed behavior and gives a better understanding of its physics...|$|R

40|$|We {{show that}} under {{favorable}} circumstances, one can construct an intersection {{product on the}} Chow groups of a tensor triangulated category T (as defined by Balmer) which generalizes the usual intersection product on a non-singular algebraic variety. Our construction depends on the choice of an algebraic model for T (a tensor Frobenius pair), which has to satisfy a K-theoretic regularity condition analogous to the Gersten conjecture from algebraic geometry. In this situation, {{we are able to}} prove an analogue of the <b>Bloch</b> <b>formula</b> and use it to define an intersection product similar to a construction by Grayson. We then recover the usual intersection product on a non-singular algebraic variety assuming a K-theoretic compatibility condition. Comment: 34 page...|$|R

Thus, we propose {{the concept of}} a coherent ensemble closely resemble the canonical ensemble. The entropy and temperature are naturally defined for the coherent ensemble. As an example, entropy and temperature are evaluated for coherent states of a harmonic oscillator and quantum field described by the Klein-Gordon-Fock equation with a source term. It is shown, in particular, that the temperature of the coherent oscillator coincides with the effective temperature of a harmonic oscillator being in contact with a heath bath (<b>Bloch</b> <b>formula)</b> when the bath temperature tends to zero.

40|$|This book, {{which has}} evolved from the author’s lectures at the University of Copenhagen and the University of Southern Denmark, draws on his {{experience}} as an active researcher in the interaction of charged particles with matter over more than forty years. The {{emphasis is on the}} theoretical description of fundamental phenomena, and much attention has been given to classic topics such as: Rutherford scattering; the theory of particle stopping as developed by Bohr, <b>Bethe,</b> <b>Bloch</b> and Lindhard; the statistical description of energy loss as developed by Bohr, Bothe, Williams and Landau; and numerous more recent developments. An attempt has been made to provide at least one complete derivation of a theoretical description for all central aspects. The presentation is intended to respect the ideas of the original authors, but much effort has been invested in establishing a unified and appealing notation consistent with present-day standards. It is intended that this volume will satisfy a long-standing need for a textbook suitable for introductory courses on interactions of charged particles with matter for students of physics, chemistry and related fields at the graduate and postgraduate level. In order to make it useful for researchers in materials science, electrical engineering, medical technique and other application areas in science and engineering, a large number of appendices has been added with background material that should be familiar to physicists but not necessarily to others. Chapters 1 - 5 are predominantly tutorial, while chapters 6 - 9 develop topics leading to the frontiers of research...|$|R
40|$|The {{differential}} {{elastic scattering}} cross section for protons from Li 6 nuclei has been measured for energies from 0. 45 Mev to 2. 9 Mev at six different angles. A measurement was also made of the Li 6 (p, a) He 3 reaction cross section {{in order to determine}} its absolute value. The scattering data is consistent with an s- and p-wave phase shift analysis with a p-wave 5 / 2 - state at about E (Lab) = 1. 84 Mev, with resonant parameters consistent with the p parameters previously assigned to the corresponding mirror level in Li 7, and a very broad s-wave 1 / 2 + state near or above E (Lab) = p 2. 76 Mev. The data is also consistent with a p-wave 3 / 2 - state with a different behavior of the s-wave scattering at higher energies, if an appropriate channel spin mixture is chosen. A p-wave 1 / 2 state is not consistent with the data. No evidence for the existence of a 3 / 2 + state near E (Lab) = 1 Mev with an appreciable p has been found. r /r p The stopping cross section for protons on lithium follows the <b>Bloch</b> <b>formula</b> from 0. 8 Mev to 2. 8 Mev.

50|$|The basic {{distinction}} between metals and insulators was proposed by <b>Bethe,</b> Sommerfeld and <b>Bloch</b> in 1928/1929. It distinguished between conducting metals and nonconducting insulators. However, in 1937 de Boer and Evert Verwey reported that many transition-metal oxides (such as NiO) with a partially filled d-band were poor conductors, often insulating. In the same year, {{the importance of}} the electron-electron correlation was stated by Peierls. Since then, these materials as well as others exhibiting a transition between a metal and an insulator have been extensively studied, e.g. by Sir Nevill Mott, after whom the insulating state is named Mott insulator.|$|R
40|$|Methods for {{modelling}} {{the electrical}} conductivity of dense plasmas and liquid metals, {{based upon the}} well-known Ziman formula, are reviewed from a general perspective, and some earlier inconsistencies relating to its application to finite temperature systems are resolved. A general formula for the conductivity of a Lorentzian two-component plasma in thermal equilibrium {{is derived from the}} Lenard-Balescu collision integral in which both energy and momentum exchange between ions and electrons are accounted for. This formula is used as a basis for some generalizations of the Ziman formula, which apply to plasmas of arbitrary degeneracy over a much wider range of conditions. These formulae implicitly include the collective motions of the ions, but neglect the collective motions of the electrons. Detailed consideration of the latter shows that they generally have a small effect on the conductivity. Conditions for the validity of the Ziman formula are derived. The extension of the general theory to arbitrarily low temperatures, where the ion dynamics become dominated by collective effects, in which dynamical ion correlations need to be taken into account, is shown to lead to the well-known <b>Bloch</b> <b>formula.</b> Consideration is given to non-Lorentzian plasmas by explicitly accounting for electron-electron collisions.

25|$|An {{immediate}} consequence upon {{passage of}} the law was that it produced both quantitative and qualitative losses to the physics community. Numerically, {{it has been estimated}} that a total of 1,145 university teachers, in all fields, were driven from their posts, which represented about 14% of the higher learning institutional staff members in 1932–1933. Out of 26 German nuclear physicists cited in the literature before 1933, 50% emigrated. Qualitatively, 11 physicists and four chemists who had won or would win the Nobel Prize emigrated from Germany shortly after Hitler came to power, most of them in 1933. These 15 scientists were: Hans <b>Bethe,</b> Felix <b>Bloch,</b> Max Born, Albert Einstein, James Franck, Heinrich Gerhard Kuhn, Peter Debye, Dennis Gabor, Fritz Haber, Gerhard Herzberg, Victor Hess, George de Hevesy, Erwin Schrödinger, Otto Stern, and Eugene Wigner. Britain and the United States were often the recipients of the talent which left Germany. The University of Göttingen had 45 dismissals from the staff of 1932–1933, for a loss of 19%. Eight students, assistants, and colleagues of the Göttingen theoretical physicist Max Born left Europe after Hitler came to power and eventually found work on the Manhattan Project, thus helping the United States, Britain and Canada to develop the atomic bomb; they were Enrico Fermi, James Franck, Maria Goeppert-Mayer, Robert Oppenheimer (who was American, but had studied under Born), Edward Teller, Victor Weisskopf, Eugene Wigner, and John von Neumann. Otto Robert Frisch, who with Rudolf Peierls first calculated the critical mass of U-235 needed for an explosive, was also a Jewish refugee.|$|R
