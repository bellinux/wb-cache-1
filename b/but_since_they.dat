5|$|Heisman {{challenged}} Pop Warner's Pittsburgh {{team to a}} postseason game {{to determine}} a national champion, <b>but</b> <b>since</b> <b>they</b> did not play until the following season, Tech was named national champion. Although the Golden Tornado was invited to play the 4–3 Oregon team in the Rose Bowl, by then many players had joined the war effort.|$|E
5|$|An Italian officer {{entered the}} station, and {{informed}} {{the medical staff}} they were now prisoners of war. <b>But</b> <b>since</b> <b>they</b> were treating casualties from both sides, {{they were allowed to}} remain and continue operating. Treatment of the wounded continued all day, and by 22:00 the surgeons had carried out 21 surgical operations and were looking after 62 British and 29 German or Italian patients. At 18:30, in the darkness, Lathbury led the remainder of his men to join the 2nd Parachute Battalion.|$|E
5|$|The {{traditional}} rival of the Oregon Ducks is the Oregon State Beavers, {{called the}} Civil War. This fierce rivalry {{extended to the}} track and field programs, where for a period, they met twice a year. However, due to budgetary concerns, Oregon State University dropped the track and field program in 1988 and the rivalry ended. Their women's program was reinstated in 2004, <b>but</b> <b>since</b> <b>they</b> {{do not have a}} men's program, the rivalry has not yet been renewed.|$|E

5|$|According to a 1992 article, the Iroquois, {{wielding}} weapons {{such as the}} tomahawk, killed 24 French {{and took}} more than 70 prisoners. Other sources, such as Encyclopædia Britannica, claim that 250 settlers and soldiers lost their lives during the “Massacre.” The Iroquois wanted to avenge the 1,200,000 bushels of corn burned by the French, <b>but</b> <b>since</b> <b>they</b> were unable to reach the food stores in Montreal, they kidnapped and killed the Lachine crop producers instead. Lachine was the main departure point for westward-traveling fur traders, a fact which may have provided extra motivation for the Mohawk attack.|$|E
5|$|The {{principle}} of there being no tolls {{for use of}} the river was established by the 1664 act of parliament. This was reversed by the 1794 act, which imposed high tolls, until they were reduced by the provisions of an act of Parliament obtained in 1824. The river is now managed by the Environment Agency between Stamford and just below Fosdyke bridge, and a licence is required to use it. From there to the Wash, it was managed by the Port of Fosdyke Authority, <b>but</b> <b>since</b> <b>they</b> went into administration, the Environment Agency have also managed the section from Fosdyke Bridge to below the Holbeach River.|$|E
5|$|In the Early Medieval era most {{evidence}} of religious practice comes from monks and is heavily biased towards monastic life. From {{this can be}} seen the daily cycle of prayers and the celebration of the Mass. There was also the business of farming, fishing and in the islands, seal hunting. Literary life revolved around the contemplation of texts and the copying of manuscripts. Libraries were of great importance to monastic communities. The one at Iona may have been exceptional, but it demonstrates that the monks were part of the mainstream of European Christian culture. Less well recorded, but as significant, was the role of bishops and their clergy. Bishops dealt with the leaders of the tuath, ordained clergy and consecrated churches. They also had responsibilities for the poor, hungry, prisoners, widows and orphans. Priests carried out baptisms, masses and burials. They also prayed for the dead and offered sermons. They anointed the sick with oil, brought communion to the dying and administered penance to sinners. Early local churches were widespread, <b>but</b> <b>since</b> <b>they</b> were largely made of wood, like that excavated at Whithorn, the only evidence that survives for most is in place names that contain words for church, including cill, both, eccles and annat, but others are indicated by stone crosses and Christian burials. Beginning on the west coast and islands and spreading south and east, these were replaced with basic masonry-built buildings.|$|E

25|$|The Martian {{regolith}} {{is known}} to contain a maximum of 0.5% (w/v) perchlorate (ClO4−) that is toxic for most living organisms, <b>but</b> <b>since</b> <b>they</b> drastically lower the freezing point of water and few extremophiles can {{use it as an}} energy source (see Perchlorates - Biology), it has prompted speculation of what their influence would be on habitability.|$|E
25|$|The shogunate {{was never}} partial to kabuki {{and all the}} {{mischief}} it brought, particularly the variety of the social classes which mixed at kabuki performances. Women’s kabuki, called onna-kabuki, was banned in 1629 for being too erotic. Following onna-kabuki, young boys performed in wakashū-kabuki, <b>but</b> <b>since</b> <b>they</b> too were eligible for prostitution, the shogun government soon banned wakashū-kabuki as well. Kabuki switched to adult male actors, called yaro-kabuki, in the mid-1600s.|$|E
25|$|When {{analyzing}} a sentence, the pronominal type {{is given}} first, then the form (subject, object, independent) is given following a period. This uniquely represents the pronominal as a two dimensional unit. Thus 1SINGULAR SUBJECT {{is the first}} person singular subject pronominal, realized as xhat. The RECIPROCAL does not uniquely identify {{one of the two}} reciprocal pronominals, <b>but</b> <b>since</b> <b>they</b> are both phonetically identical as woosh, it is generally unnecessary to uniquely identify them.|$|E

25|$|He {{says that}} these ideas may converge, <b>but</b> <b>since</b> <b>they</b> {{may as well}} not, it is {{unacceptable}} to exclude any definitions only {{on the basis that}} they do not satisfy the standards of taxonomical validity, like e.g. evaluative definitions which nevertheless can be useful in their own way. Besides discussing the issue of wrapper definitions in general, Shusterman has also criticized particular definitions of that kind invented by George Dickie and Arthur Danto.|$|E
25|$|While {{the great}} {{subduction}} events release much energy (around magnitude 9), that energy is {{spread over a}} large area, and largely centered near the coast. The energy of the somewhat smaller Benioff earthquakes is likewise diluted over a relatively large area. The largest intra-crustal earthquakes have about the same total energy (which is about one-hundredth of a subduction event), <b>but</b> <b>since</b> <b>they</b> re closer to the surface they will cause more powerful shaking, and, therefore, more damage.|$|E
25|$|Some {{condensed}} matter systems {{propose a}} structure superficially {{similar to a}} magnetic monopole, known as a flux tube. The ends of a flux tube form a magnetic dipole, <b>but</b> <b>since</b> <b>they</b> move independently, they can be treated for many purposes as independent magnetic monopole quasiparticles. Since 2009, numerous news reports from the popular media have incorrectly described these systems as the long-awaited discovery of the magnetic monopoles, but the two phenomena are only superficially related to one another.|$|E

25|$|Humans and {{penguins}} are bipedal, and so {{are then}} in the orange circle, <b>but</b> <b>since</b> <b>they</b> cannot fly they appear in the left part of the orange circle, where it does not overlap with the blue circle. Mosquitoes have six legs, and fly, so the point for mosquitoes is {{in the part of}} the blue circle that does not overlap with the orange one. Creatures that are not two-legged and cannot fly (for example, whales and spiders) would all be represented by points outside both circles.|$|E

Many of these were built by local lords for their tenants and followers, but often retaining a close relationship with monastic institutions.|$|E
25|$|Before the invasion, 3,900 Jews {{lived in}} Luxembourg, {{many of them}} {{refugees}} from Germany and Austria. On the night of 10 May 1940, about 1,600 of them left the country. After Simon introduced the Nuremberg Laws, life became unbearable for the Jewish population. Their shops, possessions and money were confiscated and all Jewish employees were fired. They were not allowed inside public buildings or to keep pets. Up until 15 October 1941, a further 1,500 Jews left {{the country on the}} orders of the authorities. The Gestapo accompanied them to France and Spain <b>but,</b> <b>since</b> <b>they</b> were rejected there, they went on an endless odyssey.|$|E
