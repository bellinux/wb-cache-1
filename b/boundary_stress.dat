40|$|In {{this article}} we study giant gravitons in the {{framework}} of AdS/CFT correspondence. First, we show how to describe these configurations in the CFT side using a matrix model. In this picture, giant gravitons are realized as single excitations high above a Fermi sea, or as deep holes into it. Then, we give a prescription to define quasi-classical states and we recover the known classical solution associated to the CFT dual of a giant graviton that grows in AdS. Second, we use the AdS/CFT dictionary to obtain the supergravity <b>boundary</b> <b>stress</b> tensor of a general state and to holographically reconstruct the bulk metric, obtaining the back reaction of space-time. We find that the space-time response to all the supersymmetric giant graviton states is of the same form, producing the singular BPS limit of the three charge Reissner-Nordström-AdS black holes.

40|$|It is {{believed}} that intergranular stresses {{play a significant role}} in failure processes, such as stress corrosion cracking (SCC) and fatigue cracking. In deformed cubic metals, intergranular stresses arise solely from the plastic and elastic anisotropies of the individual grains. In this work, stresses normal to the grain boundaries in deformed stainless steel have been calculated using crystal plasticity finite element modelling (CPFEM). The calculations show that, at strains larger than 0. 5 % and under load, the <b>stress</b> at grain <b>boundaries</b> is dominated by the effect of plastic anisotropy rather than elastic anisotropy. Upon unloading, plastic misfit still fully dominates the heterogeneity of normal stresses and is insensitive to the angle between the boundary normal and the preloaded direction. The effects of mesh density and size of <b>boundaries</b> on normal <b>stresses</b> are also studied. Special attention has been focused on examining what conditions give rise to large grain <b>boundary</b> <b>stresses.</b> Our results suggest that the magnitudes of the predicted residual grain <b>boundary</b> <b>stresses</b> are not highly correlated to the amount of plastic strain in the vicinity of the boundary and whether it is higher or lower than the average plastic strain. In other words, a soft-hard grain combination does not imply high tensile (nor compressive) residual stress normal to its boundary.
