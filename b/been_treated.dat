5|$|Chao {{are small}} creatures with a pudding-like body and behave much like human infants, with {{pleasant}} and relaxing personalities. Professor Chao, a minor character in Sonic Adventure 2, states that Chao are cute, and enjoy toys and being held or petted. However, they dislike being held while the player jumps, spins around, or throws them. Chao's diets consist of tree fruit and coconuts. Chao hatch from eggs found in Chao Gardens. When the player spends enough {{time with a}} Chao in the Chao Garden, the Chao develops a cocoon; it hatches from this as an adult. Eventually it develops another cocoon. If the Chao has <b>been</b> <b>treated</b> well, the cocoon is pink and the Chao is reincarnated as an egg; the cycle then restarts and the Chao remembers the player. If, however, the Chao has <b>been</b> <b>treated</b> poorly, the cocoon is gray and the Chao dies, removing every trace of itself from the game. Chao can breed to produce fertile eggs.|$|E

5|$|A {{company board}} member, Victor Coen, was {{convinced}} that the company had <b>been</b> <b>treated</b> wrongly and insisted in bringing it before the courts. In May 1929, he convinced the rest of the board to issue a writ against the syndicate and Oppenheimer, alleging fraudulent conspiracy, and began instructing Hastings. Hastings worried that the case would become unmanageable, with the syndicate relying on over 4,000 documents for their defence, but luckily found a certificate showing that the company profits, rather than the five percent Oppenheimer had reported, were in fact seventeen percent.|$|E

5|$|Alprazolam is {{effective}} in the relief of moderate to severe anxiety and panic attacks. However, {{it is not a}} first line treatment since the development of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Alprazolam is no longer recommended in Australia for the treatment of panic disorder due to concerns regarding tolerance, dependence, and abuse. Most evidence shows that the benefits of alprazolam in treating panic disorder last only 4 to 10 weeks. However, people with panic disorder have <b>been</b> <b>treated</b> on an open basis for up to 8 months without apparent loss of benefit.|$|E

After the bursitis has <b>been</b> <b>treated,</b> rehabilitative exercise may help improve joint mechanics and reduce chronic pain.|$|E
5|$|Not all gallstones {{implicated in}} {{ascending}} cholangitis actually originate from the gallbladder, but cholecystectomy (surgical {{removal of the}} gallbladder) is generally recommended in people who have <b>been</b> <b>treated</b> for cholangitis due to gallstone disease. This is typically delayed until all symptoms have resolved and ERCP or MRCP have confirmed that the bile duct is clear of gallstones. Those who do not undergo cholecystectomy have {{an increased risk of}} recurrent biliary pain, jaundice, further episodes of cholangitis, and need for further ERCP or cholecystostomy; the risk of death is also significantly increased.|$|E

The relationships remain very unclear. A molecular study by Eric Pasquet conducted in 2014 may provide some clarity.|$|E
