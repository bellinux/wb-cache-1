40|$|Bottom <b>blown</b> <b>copper</b> {{smelting}} furnace (BBF) in Dongying Fangyuan Nonferrous Metals Co. Ltd has been operated {{for more than}} 6 years. This new technology has shown a number of advantages comparing to other copper smelting technologies. Long service life of the refractories {{is one of the}} advantages resulted from low-temperature operation. Analyses of the BBF slags have shown that BBF was continuously operated at temperatures below the slag liquidus and spinel is always present in the slag. As the first commercial BBF limited information is available for the deposits present in the BBF. Presence of the accretions can generally protect the refractories. However, extensive accretions could significantly reduce the effective volume of the {{smelting furnace}} and also fluid dynamic conditions of the bath. It is important to maintain proper accretions to the optimum level. A large number of accretion samples inside the BBF were taken from different locations during the annual maintenance. The samples were sectioned, mounted and analysed using Electron probe micro-analysis (EPMA). The phases present and their compositions have been identified and summarised in the present study. Formation mechanisms of the accretions are discussed in the present investigations. The present study will help the operators to properly control the accretions in bottom <b>blown</b> <b>copper</b> smelting furnace...|$|E
40|$|Bottom blown oxygen copper {{smelting}} process {{developed at}} Dongying Fangyuan Nonferrous Metals shows many advantages such as flexible feed requirement, high productivity, {{low energy consumption}} and high direct copper recovery. However, the weak acid generated during the process is not stable which influences the waste management and continuous operation. The amount of the weak acid is determined by SO formed in copper smelting process. SO can be formed inside copper smelting furnace and boiler at different conditions. Effects of temperature and oxygen partial pressure on the formation of SO during copper smelting process have been discussed thermodynamically. Understanding of the mechanisms for SO formation will enable the operation of bottom <b>blown</b> <b>copper</b> smelting furnace to be optimized and generation of the weak acid in the process can be managed. The fundamentals developed in this study can also be applied to other copper smelting processes...|$|E
40|$|The oxygen bottom <b>blown</b> <b>copper</b> {{smelting}} process (SKS process) is a {{newly developed}} intense smelting process, {{which has been}} widely applied to copper production in China. A multiphase equilibrium model for the SKS process was established based on its mechanism characteristics and the principle of Gibbs energy minimization, and an efficient simulation software-SKSSIM (SKS Simulation) -was developed based on the model. Industrial data from the SKS process were used to compare with the calculated data from the SKSSIM software. The calculated data on the compositions of slag and matte {{as well as the}} distribution ratios of minor elements (such as Pb, Zn, As, Sb and Bi) among the slags, mattes and off-gases were in good agreement with the actual plant data. Accordingly, the SKSSIM simulation software has the potentail to be used for the prediction of smelting production and for optimizing the operating parameters of the SKS process...|$|E

40|$|Average {{diameter}} of bubbles {{is important in}} copper furnace. Based {{on the principle of}} similarity, a slice water model of a furnace with bottom-blown oxygen in matte-smelting process was established. A high-speed camera was used to record images continuously and clearer pictures were selected for treatment. Finally, image processing software was used for obtaining the average {{diameter of}} the bubbles. The effects of different injection conditions and equipment factors such as the diameter of nozzle, the nozzle installing angle, and gas velocity on the average diameter of bubbles were studied with cold water model experiment, exploring the dispersion and disintegration rules of bubbles. According to experimental data and Buckingham’s theorem, by using dimensional analysis method, an empirical formula on average diameter of bubbles was established (dB= 0. 41666 d 0. 29374 θ- 0. 46572 v- 0. 16725). It {{can be seen from the}} formula that nozzle installing angle and diameter of nozzle make the most impact on the average diameter of bubbles in bottom <b>blown</b> oxygen <b>copper</b> furnace...|$|R
40|$|Bottom blown oxygen copper {{smelting}} process, operated at {{high grade}} matte (up to 75 wt% Cu) with relatively low (2 - 3 wt%) Cu in slag, has been commercialized {{for more than}} five years at Dongying Fangyuan Nonferrous Metals CO., Ltd. Quenched slag and matte samples have been collected at different operating conditions while the slag temperature was measured by thermocouple. The samples were analysed by X-ray Fluorescence and Electron Probe X-ray Microanalysis. FactSage computational software was used to explain the observations of the industrial samples. The analyses show that the copper loss was closely related to the operation parameters. The Fe/SiO 2 in slag and temperature determine the solid proportion, which significantly affects the physical entrained and also chemically dissolved copper in the slag. The present study will be useful in understanding the slag chemistry of bottom <b>blown</b> <b>copper</b> smelting furnace and in optimization of the operating conditions to lower Cu loss in the slag...|$|E
40|$|The waves {{formed on}} bath surface play an {{important}} role in the bottom <b>blown</b> <b>copper</b> smelting furnace operations. Simulation experiments have been carried out on model of the bottom blown furnace to investigate features of the waves formed on bath surface. It was found that the ripples, the 1 st asymmetric standing wave and the 1 st symmetric standing wave were able to occur in this model, and empirical occurrence boundaries have been determined. The amplitude and frequency of the standing waves have been systematically investigated. It was found that the amplitude of the 1 st asymmetric standing wave is much greater than the 1 st symmetric standing wave and the ripples; and the amplitude is found to increase with increasing bath height and flowrate but decrease with blowing angle. The frequency of the 1 st asymmetric standing wave is found increasing with bath height but independent of flowrate and blowing angle...|$|E
40|$|With {{increasing}} impurity contents in concentrates, {{the control}} of the minor elements is an important issue for the oxygen bottom <b>blown</b> <b>copper</b> smelting process (Shuikoushan process or SKS process). In this work, the distribution behaviors of the minor elements (such as Pb, Zn, As, Sb, and Bi) among the matte, slag, and gas phases as a function of matte grades was investigated by adjusting the ratios of oxygen/ore in the SKS process. With a matte grade around 70 %, about 82 % As and 70 % Bi enters the gas phase, and about 70 % Sb and 64 % Zn reports to the slag phase, while 55 % lead enters the matte phase. The tendency of changes in the distribution of the minor elements in the SKS process is different from that in the Isasmelt process and the Flash smelting process. It may be concluded from this study that the distributions of the minor elements could be optimized to reduce adverse effects in the SKS process by regulating the matte grade...|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation into}} the oxidation kinetics of molten sulfide has been conducted at laboratory scale to provide information concerning {{the influence of the}} gas feed (flow and oxygen pressure) and melt temperature on the desulfurization rate. Data showed that the reaction rate was strongly dependent on the gas flow rate and significantly from oxygen pressure, whereas the influence of temperature was negligible. The variation of the sulfur conversion with the operation time was similar to that found in industrial trials when “white metal” was <b>blown</b> to blister <b>copper</b> in a Peirce-Smith converter. A unique equation for both scales could be established. This correlation made it possible to calculate the operation time in the converter at different gas flow rates and oxygen enrichments...|$|R
40|$|The first {{commercial}} bottom <b>blown</b> oxygen <b>copper</b> smelting furnace has been installed and operated at Dongying Fangyuan Nonferrous Metals (China) for 4 years. This new copper smelting technology shows {{a number of}} advantages including high productivity, low slag rate, high copper recovery and energy sufficiency. These advantages are with the flow dynamics of the bottom blown furnace. This paper reports an investigation into a 1 : 12 bottom blown furnace model set up at the University of Queensland to examine the novel features of the original furnace. In this paper, the mixing time in the bottom blown furnace model was investigated. As a first approximation Ar gas was injected {{from the bottom of}} the water bath to study the effects of gas flow rate and bath depth on mixing time. KCl solution, introduced from above the plume, was used as a tracer for continuous measurement of electrical conductivity as a mean to determine the mixing time. The preliminary correlations among mixing time, stirring energy, gas flow rate, and bath depth have been obtained for the bottom blown furnace. It was found that mixing time decreases with increasing gas flow rate and bath depth. The information from the cold model will be useful for design of the oxygen lances for the industrial furnace...|$|R
40|$|The first {{commercial}} bottom <b>blown</b> oxygen <b>copper</b> smelting furnace has been installed and operated at Dongying Fangyuan Nonferrous Metals since 2008. Significant advantages {{have been demonstrated}} in this technology mainly due to its bottom blown oxygen-enriched gas. In this study, a scaled-down 1 : 12 model {{was set up to}} simulate the flow behavior for understanding the mixing phenomena in the furnace. A single lance was {{used in the present study}} for gas blowing to establish a reliable research technique and quantitative characterisation of the mixing behavior. Operating parameters such as horizontal distance from the blowing lance, detector depth, bath height, and gas flow rate were adjusted to investigate the mixing time under different conditions. It was found that when the horizontal distance between the lance and detector is within an effective stirring range, the mixing time decreases slightly with increasing the horizontal distance. Outside this range, the mixing time was found to increase with increasing the horizontal distance and it is more significant on the surface. The mixing time always decreases with increasing gas flow rate and bath height. An empirical relationship of mixing time as functions of gas flow rate and bath height has been established first time for the horizontal bottom blowing furnace...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{a bottom}} <b>blown</b> <b>copper</b> melting {{technology}} has been developed by Fangyuan Nonferrous Metals in China. The main unit of the technology is a bottom blown smelting furnace with a dimension of 4. 4 m in diameter and 16. 5 m in length. At {{the bottom of the}} furnace, there are nine lances aligned in two staggered rows, five in the upper row, 22 º offset from vertical line, and four in the lower row 7 º offset from vertical line. During smelting, oxygen enriched air is blown into molten bath from bottom lances and leads to different types of standing waves on bath surface. The features of the different standing waves are highly associated with bath splash, and can have an effect on refractory abrasion, matte droplet entrainment and settlement, and viscous slag tapping. This study aims to identify the types of standing waves that could occur in bottom blown furnace, summarise conditions of occurrence and analyse their amplitude and frequency to assist industrial operation...|$|E
40|$|The {{control of}} arsenic, a toxic and {{carcinogenic}} element, {{is an important}} issue for all copper smelters. In this work, the reaction mechanism and distribution behavior of arsenic in the bottom <b>blown</b> <b>copper</b> smelting process (SKS process) were investigated and compared to the flash smelting process. There are obvious differences of arsenic distribution in the SKS process and flash process, resulting from the differences of oxygen potentials, volatilizations, smelting temperatures, reaction intensities, and mass transfer processes. Under stable production conditions, the distributions of arsenic among matte, slag, and gas phases are 6 %, 12 %, and 82 %, respectively. Less arsenic is reported in the gas phase with the flash process than with the SKS process. The main arsenic species in gas phase are AsS (g), AsO (g), and As 2 (g). Arsenic exists in the slag predominantly as As 2 O 3 (l), and in matte as As (l). High matte grade is harmful to the elimination of arsenic to gas. The changing of Fe/SiO 2 has slight effects on the distributions of arsenic. In order to enhance the removal of arsenic from the SKS smelting system to the gas phase, low oxygen concentration, low ratios of oxygen/ore, and low matte grade should be chosen. In the SKS smelting process, no dust is recycled, and almost all dust is collected and further treated to eliminate arsenic and recover valuable metals by other process streams...|$|E
60|$|This being {{a festival}} day, when the natives were {{bringing}} offerings to the altar, we also visited the old temple, {{a small wooden}} building. Besides more substantial offerings, there were little cones of rice with a round wafer of butter at the top, ranged on the altar in order.* [The worshippers, on entering, walk straight up to the altar, and before, or after, having deposited their gifts, they lift both hands to the forehead, fall on their knees, and touch the ground three times with both head and hands, raising the body a little between each prostration. They then advance to the head Lama, kotow similarly to him, and he blesses them, laying both hands on their heads and repeating a short formula. Sometimes the dorje is used in blessing, as the cross is in Europe, and when a mass of people request a benediction, the Lama pronounces it from {{the door of the}} temple with outstretched arms, the people all being prostrate, with their foreheads touching the ground.] Six Lamas were at prayer, psalms, and contemplation, sitting cross-legged on two small benches that ran down the building: one was reading, with his hand and fore-finger elevated, whilst the others listened; anon they all sang hymns, repeated sacred or silly precepts to the bystanders, or joined in a chorus with boys, who struck brass cymbals, and <b>blew</b> straight <b>copper</b> trumpets six feet long, and conch-shells mounted with broad silver wings, elegantly carved with dragons. There were besides manis, or praying-cylinders, drums, gongs, books, and trumpets made of human thigh-bones, plain or mounted in silver.|$|R
40|$|Copper {{was one of}} {{the first}} metals ever {{extracted}} and used by mankind. It is used for its unique properties, like corrosion resistance, good workability, high thermal conductivity and attractive appearance. New mines are opened to maintain a supply of primary feedstock to copper smelters. These new deposits are in many instances found to have a more complex mineralogy with several minor elements. Besides treating primary material, copper smelters also show an increasing interest in treating secondary material, such as copper containing scrap from waste electric and electronic equipment, which also have a complex composition. Waste electric and electronic equipment are first disassembled and upgraded by mechanical processing, generating a product stream called e-scrap, that can be added directly to the smelting processes as cold material or melted in a separate furnace producing a metallic alloy (referred to as black copper) and a slag phase. The black copper can be refined in different ways, whereof one is by using it as a secondary feed material for input to Peirce-Smith converters. Consequently the load of minor elements to the converter can be expected to increase with an increased treatment of e-scrap. This increased complexity of the raw material can potentially lead to smelter plants having to deal with a feedstock containing several minor elements such as; antimony, bismuth, arsenic, gold, silver, etc. in levels that can influence the ability to, in a cost effective way, maintain the final grade of the copper cathode. Process simulations can be an important tool for understanding the impact of process parameters on the product quality and for the purpose of process optimisation. In the present work a dynamic, non-equilibrium model based on thermodynamics over the Peirce-Smith converter has been developed. The non-equilibrium conditions have been simulated by introducing individual but linked segments. The purpose of using segments was to consider different reaction zones which yield different conditions within the converter. The model was validated using plant data and showed good agreement for the major elements. The agreement between plant and calculated data for Pb, and Zn was not as good and more work is required regarding this aspect. The model was used to investigate the influence on the distribution of Bi and Sb during addition of black copper with or without slag. When black copper is added to a blow, the removal of Bi and Sb becomes lower compared to a blow without addition of black copper. Similar result is obtained during addition of black copper with slag. To maintain a total removal of Bi and Sb in similar levels as a <b>blow</b> without black <b>copper,</b> the black copper should be added as early as possible during the converting operation.
