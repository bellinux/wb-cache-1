40|$|A {{study has}} been {{performed}} to investigate the physical effects of lumbar <b>spinal</b> <b>supports.</b> Two groups were studied, a group of normal male subjects {{and a group of}} male low back pain patients. Five different <b>spinal</b> <b>supports</b> were investigated and their effects upon the skin temperature, spinal movements and intra abdominal pressures of these individuals were examined. The results show surprisingly similar patterns for the widely varying designs of support. The findings also suggest that the longer term wearing of a <b>spinal</b> <b>support</b> results in a degree of physical dependence.

40|$|FOLLOWING {{a survey}} of mentally {{subnormal}} patients with orthopaedic abnormalities at Muckamore Abbey (James 1971), {{a group of children}} were found who were unable to sit unaided. These children were suffering from a mainly atonic form of cerebral palsy. Due to poor muscle tone their spines tended to "collapse" when sitting, and some had developed a fixed kyphosis or kyphoscoliosis. Due to their inability to sit they tended to lie in their cots and to have a very restricted view of the world. Attempts were made to sit them up, but they tended to sag and fall over. It seemed logical to fit these children with a <b>spinal</b> <b>support</b> that would hold their spine in a corrected position, so that the fixed spinal deformity could be prevented. Some fifty children were found that would benefit by a support. The production of fifty standard braces was beyond the capacity of our usual orthotic services at that time. Miss G.

40|$|Fifteen {{subjective}} variables {{reflecting the}} severity of back pain, the circumstances exacerbating symptoms, {{and the impact of}} the problem on life style were scored on Visual Analogue Scales. It was possible to combine the results from these assessments to provide a global subjective index. Repeated measurements by the same observer showed a high degree of reproducibility, but when performed by separate observers discrepancies arose in certain questions. By improving certain questions and standardizing their presentation to the patient, a considerable improvement in the correlation of results between observers was obtained. Objective assessments of spinal motion and straight leg raising and a global objective index showed a high degree of intraobserver reproducibility. This technique was applied to a study of relief of back pain by lumbar corsets when it was found that there was significantly greater relief of back pain by a corset with a lumbar support than one without a <b>spinal</b> <b>support.</b> We conclude that the emphasis in assessing the progress of the back-pain patient must be on the subjective parameters, and the technique developed offers a useful method for reliably assessing patients and following their progress...|$|R

40|$|Work environments {{with lower}} {{compressive}} {{forces on the}} spine have fewer inci-dents of low back injuries than work situations with higher compressive forces. These forces are caused by the large muscle moments needed for <b>spinal</b> <b>support</b> during lifting.

The purpose {{was to examine the}} effects of using an audible feedback signal proportion-al to the magnitude of stress on the spine during lifting. Twenty warehouse workers were recruited: 10 were in the control group and 10 were in the experimental group (received auditory feedback). Testing consisted of using an electromagnetic track-ing system interfaced with scales to measure the dynamic joint moments at L 5 /S 1 at 100 Hz over a 40 second work bout. Pre-test and post-test data consisted of lift-ing trials realistic to the workers job tasks. Two training sessions with audible feedback were performed two weeks apart. Post-tests were conducted 6 weeks later. The experimental group received two training sessions with audible feedback during the 2 nd and 4 th week.

The {{purpose is to}} verify the durability compliance of the car according to the Durability Vehicle Life Trustmark.

40|$|SUMMARY · Celiac {{disease is}} more common than {{previously}} thought, and a high index of suspi-cion is important in its diagnosis. Typically, cases of celiac disease present {{at the age of}} 5 - 24 months with the symptoms of intestinal malabsorption, growth retardation, abnormal stools, abdominal dis-tension, muscle wasting, hypotonia, poor appetite and low spirit. In adults, the symptoms of celiac disease may be highly varied. The incidence of malignancies is also increased. Most of these are small bowel lymphomas and carcinomas of the esophagus and colon. In some patients, the disease is asso-ciated with clinical dysfunction of the nervous system, manifesting variably as encephalopathy, cer-ebellar abnormalities, seizures, cerebral atrophy and dementia, brain stem encephalitis, cerebral vas-culitis, myopathy, quadriparesis (metabolic), myelopathy, peripheral neuropathy, multifocal leukoen-cephalopathy, and psychiatric disorders. Presentation is made of a 47 -year-old woman with misdiag-nosed celiac disease, who first developed pain in the back which was treated with <b>spinal</b> <b>support.</b> She also complained of very severe bone pains. Finally, she was admitted to the hospital with a history of increasing difficulty on walking, weakness in her legs, urine incontinence, and 5 -kg weight loss in four months.

Children with poliomyelitis, hemiplegics, amputees and paraplegics top the list of patients requiring rehabilitation at University College Hospital, Ibadan. The amputees depend on wooden peg legs or pylons made by the occupational therapy department since modular and P. T. B. prostheses are presently not available in this hospital. Physiotherapists, therefore, encounter problems in teaching correct patterns of walking and other functional activities to the above-knee amputee because knee joints are absent.
