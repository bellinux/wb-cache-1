5|$|In the HPHT method, {{there are}} three main press designs used to supply the {{pressure}} and temperature necessary to produce synthetic diamond: the <b>belt</b> <b>press,</b> the cubic press and the split-sphere (BARS) press. Diamond seeds are placed {{at the bottom of}} the press.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} GE invention by Tracy Hall {{uses the}} <b>belt</b> <b>press</b> wherein {{the upper and}} lower anvils supply the pressure load to a cylindrical inner cell. This internal pressure is confined radially by a belt of pre-stressed steel bands. The anvils also serve as electrodes providing electric current to the compressed cell. A variation of the <b>belt</b> <b>press</b> uses hydraulic pressure, rather than steel belts, to confine the internal pressure. Belt presses are still used today, but they are built on a much larger scale than those of the original design.|$|E
5|$|The {{second type}} of press design is the cubic press. A cubic press has six anvils which provide {{pressure}} simultaneously onto all faces of a cube-shaped volume. The first multi-anvil press design was a tetrahedral press, using four anvils to converge upon a tetrahedron-shaped volume. The cubic press was created shortly thereafter to increase the volume to which pressure could be applied. A cubic press is typically smaller than a <b>belt</b> <b>press</b> and can more rapidly achieve the pressure and temperature necessary to create synthetic diamond. However, cubic presses cannot be easily scaled up to larger volumes: the pressurized volume can be increased by using larger anvils, but this also increases the amount of force needed on the anvils {{to achieve the same}} pressure. An alternative is to decrease the surface area to volume ratio of the pressurized volume, by using more anvils to converge upon a higher-order platonic solid, such as a dodecahedron. However, such a press would be complex and difficult to manufacture.|$|E

25|$|The {{choice of}} belt is {{critical}} to the function of the <b>belt</b> <b>press</b> filter and a wide variety of materials and weaves are available. The filter cloth for a <b>belt</b> <b>press</b> filter should be as open as possible while maintaining the desired filtrate clarity or, if precoat is used, to prevent the loss of precoat. Lighter cloths produce a clearer filtrate and do not block as rapidly however their durability and life span is significantly shorter than heavier cloths. Both seamless and seamed belts are available. Seamed belts wear faster at the seam and cause wear at the rollers and the doctor blade. Zipper-type and clipper-type seamed belts are also available with the zipper-type having a longer life span as they provide less discontinuity. Seamless belts have the longest life span but are more expensive. Also it should be ensured that the <b>belt</b> <b>press</b> is compatible with a seamless belt.|$|E

25|$|A <b>belt</b> filter <b>press</b> is {{also known}} for its high {{capacity}} throughput, as {{it is designed to}} handle excess capacity. It has low initial costs and low energy running costs, however, if throughput is less than 4 million gallons per day, the <b>belt</b> filter <b>press</b> may be less cost efficient than liquid transport, hiring a processing facility, or utilizing non-mechanical dewatering methods such as drying beds or reed beds.|$|R
25|$|In {{order of}} {{increasing}} cost and decreasing product moisture {{the most common}} dewatering options are a thickener, deep bed thickening, belt presses and membrane filter presses. In general centrifuges and other competing technologies do not show a significant cost advantage compared to the <b>belt</b> <b>press</b> filter, for the same cake dryness. The cost of flocculant is often a major operating cost of dewatering equipment. <b>Belt</b> <b>press</b> filters in general have the lowest flocculant consumption {{for any of the}} listed processes excluding membrane filter presses and centrifuges.|$|E
25|$|In the {{compression}} zone of a <b>belt</b> <b>press</b> filter, the filter cake is compressed {{between the two}} belts and passed over rollers to exert pressure on the cake.

25|$|<b>Belt</b> press- This <b>press</b> {{utilizes}} {{a series}} of air-inflated pads along a wire mesh belt. Usually several meters long, fresh grapes are loaded onto {{the beginning of the}} belt where it is transferred by rollers through the series of pads that apply pressure, hold it for a time and release with the juice falling through the screens into waiting <b>press</b> pans. <b>Belt</b> <b>presses</b> have been used by high volume wineries for whole-cluster pressing and sparkling wine production but it has not caught on in many wine regions due to concerns about the amount of oxidation it introduces to the wine as well as the large amount of suspended solids that get past the screens.|$|R
25|$|The {{input to}} a <b>belt</b> <b>press</b> filter is {{generally}} measured as {{the rate of}} dry solids loading (mass of dry solids per time per belt width). Again, the input solids loading {{is dependent on the}} sludge type and filter media, thus there is great variation in the dry solids loading rates of operating <b>belt</b> <b>press</b> filters. Typically, lower range solids loading rates fall in the range of 40–230kg/h/m belt width and high range solids loading rates fall in the range of 300–910kg/h/m belt width. Whilst loading is important for measuring production rate, {{it is also important to}} consider the thickness of the cake that forms in the gravity drainage section. Cake thickness affects the permeability of the filtration media and the filtration rate. Testing for the particular sludge type must be conducted to determine the optimum cake thickness. In some cases where filtrate recovery is important, it may be necessary to introduce a cake washing step.|$|E
25|$|<b>Belt</b> <b>press</b> {{filters are}} {{designed}} for solids capacity, by weight or volume, rather than wastewater flow. Solids concentration must be determined based on the concentration of primary solids in the feed and further solids that may precipitate during treatment.

25|$|The {{filter cake}} usually {{has a high}} enough solid {{concentration}} to allow {{for all types of}} disposal methods without further treatment including recycling back into the process, landfill/composting and incineration. The polymer content makes filter cake from a <b>belt</b> <b>press</b> filter more suited to the aforementioned disposal methods than a cake conditioned with ferric chloride and lime which can occur with other dewatering processes.|$|E

The solution is primarily focused on the technology of mechanical dewatering of fine-grained materials. The body of this thesis describes the most used industrial technologies for the processing of sludge from mineral extraction, such as <b>presses,</b> centrifuges, <b>belt</b> <b>presses</b> and drum filters.

25|$|The feed to a <b>belt</b> <b>press</b> filter {{depends on}} the type of solids, desired product and filter design. For most sludge types the feed dry solids {{concentration}} is typically in the range of 1-10%. The resulting dewatered sludge (or cake) dry solids concentration typically falls in the range of 12-50%. Dilute feed solids concentration results in a cake of higher moisture content whilst a higher feed solids concentration yields an improved solids filtration rate and drier end product.|$|E
25|$|Completely clear {{filtrate}} {{cannot be}} obtained using <b>belt</b> <b>press</b> filters except in rare circumstances.

If the filter is downstream of a clarifier or thickener the filtrate (and wash water) can be recycled back into the clarifier to reduce the required filtrate clarity and allows {{for the use of}} more durable cloths. If recycling or reuse is not an option the filtrate should be discharged subject to legislation and license requirements. Further treatment of clarified water (filtration or chemical treatment) may be required before discharge.|$|E
25|$|Synthetic {{diamonds}} are diamonds {{produced in}} a technological process {{as opposed to}} natural diamonds, which are created in geological processes. Synthetic diamonds are also widely known as HPHT diamonds or CVD diamonds, HPHT and CVD being the production methods, high-pressure high-temperature synthesis and chemical vapor deposition, respectively. Although the concept of producing high quality artificial diamonds is an old one, the reproducible synthesis of diamonds is not. In 1954, Howard Tracy Hall at the GE Research Laboratory invented a <b>belt</b> <b>press</b> {{in the shape of}} a doughnut, which confined the sample chamber and two curved, tapered pistons to apply pressure on the chamber in order to produce the first commercially successful and reproducible synthesis of a diamond.|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} {{physical}} separation processes {{similar to the}} <b>belt</b> filter <b>press</b> used for dewatering, including centrifuges, vacuum-disc filters, and the {{plate and frame filter}} press. When compared to other compression filters, belt filters use relatively lower pressures. Although centrifuges have lower moisture content, lower costs and simpler operations in coal tails processing, belt filters tend to make less noise and have much quicker startup and shutdown times.|$|R
25|$|The primary {{objective}} of a <b>belt</b> <b>press</b> filter is to dewater process sludge {{and much of}} this dewatering occurs in the gravity drainage zone. The gravity drainage zone can achieve a 5 to 10 percent increase in solids concentration. The degree of dewatering in the gravity drainage zone is greatly dependent {{on the type of}} solids, the filter media and the sludge conditioning. The dewatering achieved in the gravity drainage zone is adversely affected if the sludge is poorly spread across the belt or the residence time is insufficient. Sludge conditioning is the addition of chemicals to promote flocculation of particles to form a thickened sludge and to promote dewatering. Dewatering can be promoted by the addition of surfactant and flocculation is achieved via the addition of high molecular weight polymer. Flocculation is improved with optimum polymer dosage, polymer dilution and mixing. The pH of the feed slurry must also be monitored and controlled as low pH decreases flocculation. It is important to find the optimum value for each conditioning parameter as too much polymer or mixing can {{have a negative impact on}} flocculation and greatly increase operating expenses. The effects of sludge conditioning are most apparent in the gravity drainage zone which can be easily replicated on a laboratory scale where the optimum conditioning strategy can be determined. For a <b>belt</b> <b>press</b> filter to be industrially viable it must be economically efficient and thus maximum throughput is desired. Without sufficient conditioning, the gravity drainage is generally the limiting process step, but with optimum dilution the limiting process step can be shifted to the compression zone.|$|E
25|$|<b>Belt</b> <b>press</b> filters have 4 main zones: {{preconditioning}} zone, {{gravity drainage}} zone, linear compression (low-pressure) zone and roller compression (high-pressure) zone. Preconditioned slurry, which is flocculated and/or coagulated {{depending on the}} feed and process, is thickened in the gravity drainage zone. The gravity drainage zone is a flat or inclined belt where gravity drainage of free water occurs The gravity drainage area is sized according to feed solid concentrations. The standard size {{can be used for}} solids concentrations of 1.5 percent or greater, but a setup with a longer drainage area or extended size should be used for 1.5 to 2.5 percent feed solids for more free water drainage before compression. For dilute sludge with feed solids of less than 1.5 percent, an independent gravity drainage belt can be used. This belt is used only in the gravity drainage area, not in the pressure zones. The pressure or wedge zones use two belts, upper and lower, to sandwich the feed together, but an independent gravity zone has its own separate belt, making the belt filter a three-belt system. Depending on the required conditions of the cake, belt filters can have added washing stages and, infrared, hot gas or even microwave drying stages.|$|E
2500|$|A <b>belt</b> <b>press</b> filter {{using three}} belts can achieve {{independent}} speeds and have different belt types for {{the pressure and}} gravity zones. This allows the filter system to accommodate higher hydraulic loadings occurring with dilute feed sludge (feed solid concentration below 1.5%). [...] The three belt system is more efficient with both a higher production rate and cake solid concentration {{at the expense of}} mechanical complexity.|$|E
