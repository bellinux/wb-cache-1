Putnam used his extensive political connections to help Hall land lucrative federal contracts, which significantly improved the Observatory's finances.

25|$|In May and June 2002 Roberto Soria and {{his colleagues}} at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics {{discovered}} two Ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) with the Chandra X-ray Observatory. ULXs are objects that emit tremendous amounts of X-rays (> 1032 watts or 1039 erg/s), assuming they radiate isotropically (the same in all directions). This amount is larger than currently understood stellar processes (including supernovae) but smaller than the amount of X-rays emitted by active galactic nuclei, which accounts for their alternate name, Intermediate-luminosity X-ray Objects (IXOs). The source designated ULX1 was found in a relatively empty interarm region, far from any bright clusters or star-forming complexes, and showed a 75% increase in X-ray luminosity over the course of 20 days. ULX2 was found in an exceptionally <b>bright</b> <b>young</b> stellar complex, and showed an order of magnitude increase over the same time period.|$|E
25|$|An Anglican {{priest of}} Irish extraction, {{he was born}} on St Patrick's Day, 17 March 1777. He was a <b>bright</b> <b>young</b> man and after being taught by the Rev. Thomas Tighe, he won a {{scholarship}} to St John's College, Cambridge, where he studied divinity and ancient and modern history. Attending Cambridge may have made him think his name was too Irish, and he changed its spelling to Brontë, perhaps in honour of Horatio Nelson who held the title of Duke of Bronte, whom Patrick admired. However, a more likely reason may have been that his brother, William, was 'on the run' from the British for his involvement with the United Irishmen {{and he wanted to}} distance himself from the name Prunty. Having obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree, he was ordained on 10 August 1806. He is the author of Cottage Poems (1811), The Rural Minstrel (1814), numerous pamphlets and newspaper articles, and various rural poems.|$|E

25|$|Tennant {{contributed to}} several audio dramatisations of Shakespeare for the Arkangel Shakespeare series (1998). His roles include a {{reprisal}} of his Antipholus of Syracuse in The Comedy of Errors, {{as well as}} Launcelot Gobbo in The Merchant of Venice, Edgar/Poor Tom in King Lear, and Mercutio in Romeo and Juliet, all of which he performs in his natural accent. In 1995, Tennant appeared at the Royal National Theatre, London, {{playing the role of}} Nicholas Beckett in Joe Orton's What the Butler Saw. In television, he appeared in the first episode of Reeves and Mortimer's revamped Randall and Hopkirk in 2000, playing an eccentric artist. This is one of his few TV roles in his native Scottish accent. During the Christmas season of 2002, he starred in a series of television advertisements for Boots the Chemists. He began to appear on television more prominently in 2004 and 2005, when he appeared in a dramatisation of He Knew He Was Right (2004), Blackpool (2004), Casanova (2005), and The Quatermass Experiment (2005). In film, he appeared in <b>Bright</b> <b>Young</b> Things (2003), and later that same year appeared as Barty Crouch Jr. in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.|$|E
500|$|Vile Bodies, a satire on the <b>Bright</b> <b>Young</b> People of the 1920s, was {{published}} on 19 January 1930 and was Waugh's first major commercial success. Despite its quasi-biblical title, {{the book is}} dark, bitter, [...] "a manifesto of disillusionment", according to biographer Martin Stannard. As a best-selling author Waugh could now command larger fees for his journalism. Amid regular work for The Graphic, Town and Country and Harper's Bazaar, he quickly wrote Labels, a detached account of his honeymoon cruise with She-Evelyn.|$|E

500|$|Lucien Lucius Nunn was an American {{industrialist}} and entrepreneur {{involved in}} the early electrification of the mining industry. To staff the power plants he built, including ones in Colorado and the Olmsted Station Powerhouse in Provo, Utah, Nunn created an early work study program, which he named 'Telluride Institute' after his city of residence of Telluride, Colorado. In the Institute, Nunn's students were trained in engineering and the liberal arts. Upon completion of their institute program, the student workers were sent to various academic institutions on a scholarship from Nunn to further their education. Many of these students went on to study at Cornell University's engineering programs. On Cornell University's campus in Ithaca, Nunn built the Telluride House as a scholarship residence [...] "for <b>bright</b> <b>young</b> men", {{many of whom have}} passed through Nunn’s Telluride Institute.|$|E
500|$|The critic Clive James said of Waugh: [...] "Nobody ever wrote a more unaffectedly elegant English... its {{hundreds}} of years of steady development culminate in him". As his talent developed and matured, he maintained what literary critic Andrew Michael Roberts called [...] "an exquisite sense of the ludicrous, and a fine aptitude for exposing false attitudes". In the first stages of his 40-year writing career, before his conversion to Catholicism in 1930, Waugh was the novelist of the <b>Bright</b> <b>Young</b> People generation. His first two novels, Decline and Fall (1928) and Vile Bodies (1930), comically reflect a futile society, populated by two-dimensional, basically unbelievable characters in circumstances too fantastic to evoke the reader's emotions. A typical Waugh trademark evident in the early novels is rapid, unattributed dialogue in which the participants can be readily identified. At the same time Waugh was writing serious essays, such as [...] "The War and the Younger Generation" [...] in which he castigates his own generation as [...] "crazy and sterile" [...] people.|$|E

There just isn't anything else on TV that can match it for ideas, writing and performance." [...] Sarah Dempster of The Guardian agreed, adding that [...] "Four years into its ingenious 'making history look less crap' operation... HH remains true to its aim, with meticulously harvested historical data + roaringly well-observed pop culture pastiches = seemingly infinite heritage lolz." [...] Writing in The Independent, Grace Dent commended the cast in particular, saying that the show [...] "has the distinct feel {{of a group of}} <b>bright,</b> <b>young,</b> erudite, writery-actory sparks having a tremendously good time." [...] Venning of The Stage reiterated his praise of the show, adding that [...] "it also has the courage to tackle potentially controversial events head on", specifically citing the song featuring the Civil Rights Movement activist Rosa Parks as retelling her story in a [...] "clever, concise and accessible way without trivialising it." [...] In 2016, Margaret Lyons of The New York Times praised the series as [...] "deeply silly", [...] "frequently hilarious", and,"very consistent".|$|E
500|$|At {{this point}} in his career, Sheen began to devote more time to film work. Heartlands, a little-seen 2002 film about a naive man's road trip in the Midlands, was his first leading film role. While The Guardian {{dismissed}} the [...] "cloying bittersweet-regional-lottery-Britfilm", it noted that [...] "Sheen himself has a childlike, Frank Spencer-ish charm". [...] "It was great to do something that was so different", Sheen has said of the role. [...] "I usually play very extreme characters." [...] Also in 2002, he had a minor role in the action-adventure film The Four Feathers. In 2003, Sheen appeared in <b>Bright</b> <b>Young</b> Things, the directorial debut of his Wilde co-star, Stephen Fry. An adaptation of Evelyn Waugh's novel, the film followed high society partygoers in decadent, pre-war London. Sheen played a gay aristocrat in an ensemble cast which included James McAvoy, Emily Mortimer, David Tennant, Dan Aykroyd, Jim Broadbent and Peter O'Toole. While the Los Angeles Times said he [...] "shone", The Guardian felt the role [...] "drastically under-uses his talents". Sheen described his character as [...] "possibly the campest man in cinema history" [...] and relished a scene [...] "where I do drugs with [...] Sir John Mills." [...] In other 2003 film work, Sheen portrayed the werewolf leader Lucian in Underworld and made a brief appearance in the sci-fi film Timeline.|$|E
500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from December 17, 1910. It states: [...] "Sue Jennings and Tom Egan have been sweethearts, Sue decides to marry another man, and holds a secret meeting with Tom, in which she returns his love letters and demands her own. On the same night, Jack Deming, a friend of Tom's who has lost heavily in speculation on Tom's advice, calls at the latter's rooms, very much intoxicated, brandishing a revolver and vowing vengeance. Tom calms his excited visitor, who falls asleep on the couch, after which Tom writes {{a letter to his}} former sweetheart and dispatches it by his servant. When the servant returns, he discovers his master dead on the floor of his apartment and Jack just leaving the room revolver in hand. Jack is arrested on suspicion, and young Miss Marsh , a <b>bright</b> <b>young</b> woman in the detective department, is detailed from headquarters to investigate the case.
