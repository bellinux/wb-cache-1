5|$|A similar {{suggestion}} {{holds the}} 21,636-year precession cycles solely responsible. Ice ages {{are characterized by}} the slow <b>buildup</b> <b>of</b> ice volume, followed by relatively swift melting phases. It is possible that ice built up over several precession cycles, only melting after four or five such cycles.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the crash}} of Flight 405 and the Air Ontario {{accident}} in Dryden, the FAA began to research methods of improving deicing practices at airports to minimise the number of accidents caused by a <b>buildup</b> <b>of</b> ice.|$|E

50|$|The Republic of Korea Navy (South Korea) {{believes}} it can deploy two light aircraft carriers by 2036 and expand its blue-water force {{to cope with}} the rapid naval <b>buildups</b> <b>of</b> China and Japan, according to a Navy source.|$|R
5|$|Secrecy for the {{operation}} was so tight that not all German ground and naval forces had been informed of {{the operation}} and some units suffered casualties from friendly fire. British signals intelligence (Ultra) recorded the movement and <b>buildup</b> <b>of</b> German air forces in the region, but did not realise that an operation was imminent.|$|E
5|$|The {{eventual}} {{successor to}} the Kaiserliche Marine, the Kriegsmarine, considered building three s before the Second World War {{as part of the}} Plan Z <b>buildup</b> <b>of</b> the Navy. However, the outbreak of war in 1939 caused the plans to be shelved, and none of these ships were built.|$|E
5|$|Breath-hold diving by an {{air-breathing}} {{animal is}} limited to the physiological capacity to perform the dive on the oxygen available until it returns to a source of fresh breathing gas, usually the air at the surface. As this internal oxygen supply reduces, the animal experiences an increasing urge to breathe caused by <b>buildup</b> <b>of</b> carbon dioxide and lactate in the blood, followed by loss of consciousness due to central nervous system hypoxia. If this occurs underwater, it will drown.|$|E
50|$|A small {{subset of}} explorers enter {{sanitary}} sewers. Sometimes {{they are the}} only connection to caves or other subterranean features. Sewers are among the most dangerous locations to explore owing to risk <b>of</b> poisoning by <b>buildups</b> <b>of</b> toxic gas (commonly methane and hydrogen sulfide).|$|R
50|$|Fingerprints, water spots, {{and dust}} {{are removed from}} the screen with a {{cleaning}} wipe specialized for the screen type (CRT, LCD, etc.). A general plastic-cleaning agent is used on the outer casing, which requires a less gentle cleanser but may need more focused attention to unusual <b>buildups</b> <b>of</b> dust, grime, pen marks, etc. idiosyncratic to the user and environment.|$|R

5|$|Diagnosis of a {{pneumothorax}} {{by physical}} examination alone {{can be difficult}} (particularly in smaller pneumothoraces). A chest X-ray, computed tomography (CT) scan, or ultrasound is usually used to confirm its presence. Other conditions that can result in similar symptoms include a hemothorax (<b>buildup</b> <b>of</b> blood in the pleural space), pulmonary embolism, and heart attack. A large bullae may look similar on a chest X-ray.|$|E
5|$|Endometrial cancer forms {{when there}} are errors in normal endometrial cell growth. Usually, when cells grow old or get damaged, they die, and new cells take their place. Cancer starts when new cells form unneeded, and old or damaged cells do not die as they should. The <b>buildup</b> <b>of</b> extra cells often forms a mass of tissue called a growth or tumor. These {{abnormal}} cancer cells have many genetic abnormalities that cause them to grow excessively.|$|E
5|$|Global {{warming is}} {{expected}} to have a number of negative long-term ecological impacts on the region, including drought, increased forest fires, forest degradation to drought and disease, and less healthy or nonexistent salmon runs. The distribution and survival of plant species, especially those that inhabit alpine environments, as well as animals that are specifically adapted to those environments, will also be adversely affected. Glaciers are also expected to recede due to a decreased <b>buildup</b> <b>of</b> snowpack and higher overall temperatures.|$|E
50|$|On land, {{plastic bags}} {{are one of}} the most {{prevalent}} types of litter in inhabited areas. Large <b>buildups</b> <b>of</b> plastic bags can clog drainage systems and contribute to flooding, as occurred in Bangladesh in 1988 and 1998 and almost annually in Manila. Littering is often a serious problem in developing countries, where trash collection infrastructure is less developed than in wealthier nations.|$|R
5000|$|Investigators {{suspect the}} {{accident}} {{was caused by a}} powerful explosion of methane. Mykhailo Volynets, the head of the Independent Trade Union of Miners, called the Sukhodilska-Skhidna coal mine [...] "one of the most dangerous in Ukraine" [...] due to <b>buildups</b> <b>of</b> methane and coal dust. The President of Ukraine ordered the government to set up a commission to investigate the accident.|$|R

5|$|In {{response}} to the <b>buildup</b> <b>of</b> U.S. forces in the Republic of Vietnam, the brigade headquarters was reactivated 1 May 1967, at Fort Bragg and deployed to Vietnam in August 1967. During the Vietnam War, the brigade numbered over 13,000 officers and enlisted men organized into three engineer groups, with 14 battalions and 31 separate companies and detachments. One of these soldiers, Al Gore, would later become Vice President of the United States.|$|E
5|$|In the aftermath, the North Vietnamese proclaimed {{a victory}} at Khe Sanh, while US forces {{claimed that they}} had {{withdrawn}} as the base was no longer required. Historians have observed that the Battle of Khe Sanh may have distracted American and South Vietnamese attention from the <b>buildup</b> <b>of</b> Viet Cong forces in the south before the early 1968 Tet Offensive. Nevertheless, the US commander during the battle, General William Westmoreland, maintained that the true intention of Tet was to distract forces from Khe Sanh.|$|E
5|$|In the afternoon, RAF Bomber Command {{abandoned}} {{more attacks}} on invasion ports because of insufficient cloud cover. Six Bristol Blenheims undertook an armed reconnaissance over the North Sea. RAF Coastal Command flew 95 sorties for anti-invasion, anti-submarine, mine laying and reconnaissance missions. Spitfires photographed every port from Antwerp to Cherbourg. They returned {{with evidence of}} a gradually increasing <b>buildup</b> <b>of</b> amphibious forces. All the Command's aircraft returned.|$|E

5|$|Like other New World vultures, the Andean condor has {{the unusual}} habit of urohidrosis: it often empties its cloaca onto its legs and feet. A cooling effect through {{evaporation}} {{has been proposed}} {{as a reason for}} this behavior, but it does not make any sense in the cold Andean habitat of the bird. Because of this habit, their legs are often streaked with a white <b>buildup</b> <b>of</b> uric acid.|$|E
5|$|Lithium is {{corrosive}} {{and requires}} special handling to avoid skin contact. Breathing lithium dust or lithium compounds (which are often alkaline) initially irritate {{the nose and}} throat, while higher exposure can cause a <b>buildup</b> <b>of</b> fluid in the lungs, leading to pulmonary edema. The metal itself is a handling hazard because contact with moisture produces the caustic lithium hydroxide. Lithium is safely stored in non-reactive compounds such as naphtha.|$|E
5|$|Muskrats {{spend much}} of their time in the water and are well suited for their semiaquatic life. They can swim under water for 12 to 17 minutes. Their bodies, like those of seals and whales, are less {{sensitive}} to the <b>buildup</b> <b>of</b> carbon dioxide than those of most other mammals. They can close off their ears to keep the water out. Their hind feet are semi-webbed, although in swimming, their tails are their main means of propulsion.|$|E

5|$|Reagan {{escalated}} the Cold War, accelerating {{a reversal}} from {{the policy of}} détente which began in 1979 after the Soviet war in Afghanistan. Reagan ordered a massive <b>buildup</b> <b>of</b> the United States Armed Forces and implemented new policies towards the Soviet Union: reviving the B-1 Lancer program that had been canceled by the Carter administration, and producing the MX missile. In response to Soviet deployment of the SS-20, Reagan oversaw NATO's deployment of the Pershing missile in West Germany.|$|E
5|$|Repetitive diving {{occurs when}} two dives are {{separated}} by a short surface interval, during which the diver has not completely outgassed from the first dive. The gas loading from the first dive must then {{be taken into account}} when determining no stop times and decompression requirements for the second dive. Multiple decompressions per day over multiple days can increase the risk of decompression sickness because of the <b>buildup</b> <b>of</b> asymptomatic bubbles, which reduce the rate of off-gassing and are not accounted for in most decompression algorithms.|$|E
5|$|The 3rd Brigade Combat Team was {{slated to}} deploy to Iraq in 2009, but that {{deployment}} was rerouted. In January 2009, the 3rd BCT instead deployed to Kunar, Logar and Wardak Provinces, eastern Afghanistan {{to relieve the}} 101st Airborne Division, {{as part of a}} new <b>buildup</b> <b>of</b> US forces in that country. The brigade was responsible for expanding forward operating bases and combat outposts (COPs) in the region, as well as strengthening US military presence in preparation for additional US forces to arrive.|$|E
50|$|A skin {{bridge is}} a penile skin adhesion. It most {{commonly}} occurs {{as a consequence}} of an improperly healed circumcision, being formed when the inner lining of the remaining foreskin attaches {{to another part of the}} penis (normally the glans) as the cut heals. While less common, skin bridges can also occur in uncircumcised men. Due to difficulty <b>of</b> cleaning, <b>buildups</b> <b>of</b> smegma underneath wide skin bridges are common, but this is typically a minor inconvenience and does not lead to further issues. However, in more severe cases, this condition can result in painful erections, sometimes requiring surgical correction.|$|R
5000|$|Shortly before 2 a.m. on 29 July 2011, an {{explosion}} {{went off in}} the Suhodolskaya-Vostochnaya coal mine, which occurred 3,000 feet (915 meters) underground. The explosion killed at least 17 people and left nine missing. Investigators suspect the accident {{was caused by a}} powerful explosion of methane. Mykhailo Volynets, the head of the Independent Trade Union of Miners, called the Suhodolskaya-Vostochnaya mine [...] "one of the most dangerous in Ukraine" [...] due to <b>buildups</b> <b>of</b> methane and coal dust.

In flexure bearing, flexing elements placed between outer race of ball bearing and outer ring. Elements flex when ball bearings encounter small frictional-torque "bumps" or even larger ones when bearing balls encounter <b>buildups</b> <b>of</b> grease on inner or outer race. Flexure of elements reduce high friction slopes of "bumps", helping to keep torque between outer ring and inner race low and more nearly constant.
