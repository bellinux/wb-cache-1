25|$|Once {{while serving}} as a doctor for the Peace Corps, a {{volunteer}} became seriously ill, and a doctor diagnosed malaria. The volunteer's condition progressively worsened, and Jemison {{was sure it was}} meningitis with life-threatening complications that could not be treated in Sierra Leone. Jemison called for an Air Force hospital plane based in Germany for a military medical evacuation at a cost of $80,000.

She recalls the accident clearly <b>but</b> <b>she's</b> <b>told</b> that all is her delusion. A man arrives, not her husband, but to get away she accepts the impostor.

500|$|On March 13, Kristin Dos Santos of E! {{confirmed}} that the series would be a spin-off with new characters, and not a remake. In order for the project {{to be ready for}} the network's [...] "upfront" [...] presentations to advertisers in May, casting began before the script was completed. The first actor to be cast was Dustin Milligan on April 1, followed by AnnaLynne McCord on April 14. Sachs found Milligan to be [...] "really funny", and changed Ethan to better represent his personality. McCord was cast because, according to Sachs, [...] "she's someone who is worldly, and there's a sophistication to her that's interesting". Actress and singer Hilary Duff was rumored to have been offered the part of Annie, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> reports that it was [...] "not true". The role was eventually given to Shenae Grimes, who says she was raised watching the original series. Sachs and Judah had seen Grimes' work before and knew [...] "she had the acting chops", and she was cast after acting a dramatic scene which she [...] "just killed". Sachs stated, [...] "she can act, she's beautiful, and she can give this sweet cuteness (that lets us see) through her eyes into this world." ...|$|E
2500|$|Boulanger's unrelenting {{schedule}} of teaching, performing, composing, writing letters etc. {{started to take}} its toll on her health; she had frequent migraines and toothaches. She stopped writing as a critic for Le Monde musical as she could not attend the requisite concerts. To maintain the living standard {{for her and her}} mother, she concentrated on teaching.

Fauré believed she was mistaken to stop composing, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> him, [...] "If there is one thing of which I am certain, it is that I wrote useless music." ...|$|E

2500|$|In Allen's opinion, she couldn't learn {{fast enough}} to make a first-rate movie, {{although}} she thought Marnie did have some good scenes in it. She took a lot of the responsibility for what is considered a very flawed movie, since Hitchcock loved her script so much so that he did not make as good a movie as he should have. Hitchcock would have made her a director <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> him no. Said Allen: [...] "It seems perfectly clear to me that any project takes a minimum of a year to direct. I like to get things on and over with. ... Did you ever hear the phrase, 'the lady proposes, the studio disposes'? I didn’t make it up. I would never propose myself as a director." [...] Under Hitchcock's mentoring, Allen developed the screenwriting talent she would use the rest of her career. Allen wrote that she never felt discriminated against. While being one of the rare female screenwriters in Hollywood in the 1960s, she said [...] "almost all of the men I worked with were supportive. If I was getting a bum rap somewhere, I didn’t know it." ...|$|E
