40|$|The {{aircraft}} {{met with}} an incident on March 23, 2006. On strip {{examination of the}} engine, one of the I stage compressor rotor blades was found dislodged and lying in the air intake. It was reported {{that in addition to}} this, one more blade had fractured in the airfoil section. The remaining blades of I stage were with the disc and were mechanically damaged to varying extent. The dislodged blade (No. 5) and the fractured blade (No. 24) were forwarded to the laboratory for analyzing the cause of failure. Two locking pins, one belonging to blade No. 5 and the other belonging to blade No. 24, were also sent for analysis with the following queries. (a) 	Whether or not blade No. 24 failed by fatigue? (b) 	Whether or not blade No. 5 got dislodged due to failure of blade No. 24 ? If not, what was the reason for dislodgement of blade No. 5 ? (c) 	In a normal situation, the <b>blade</b> <b>sliding</b> is expected to be in the forward direction. Why in this case, the <b>blade</b> No. 5 <b>sliding</b> was in the rearward direction? The investigation was carried out with respect to (a) and (b) and the findings were reported (refer NAL Report No. FA-MT- 995 - 05 - 2006) with the following conclusions [...] (a) 	Fractographic study confirmed that the blade No. 24 had failed by sudden overload such as impact. There were no evidences of progressive failure like fatigue. (b) 	The dislodgement of blade No. 5 without any breakage is possible only when the locking mechanism fails. (c) 	Evidences suggest that the locking pin used for the blade No. 5 is 27. 0 mm in length against the specification of 32. 0 mm. This is as good as not locking the blade. It is, therefore, believed that this particular blade had dislodged from the disc due to this assembly error leading to subsequent damages in the engine. Subsequent to the above, NAL was requested to carry out investigation on additional components, namely, (a) dovetail portion of slot No. 5 from I stage rotor disc and (b) three blades of I stage rotor where half moon cuts were noticed with a view to establish the following. (a) 	Conformation of the <b>blade</b> <b>sliding</b> in the rearward direction. (b) 	Nature of damages on the three blades supplied (whether or not due to FOD?) The necessary information, drawing, specification, photographs etc., were provided by the manufacturer for carrying out the investigation on the above components. The dovetail portion of the blade No. 5 and dovetail slot No. 5 on the rotor disc were examined to look for tell-tale marks, present if any, for conformation of the <b>blade</b> <b>sliding</b> in the rearward direction. The damages on the pin No. 5 were also examined in detail in an effort to corroborate the tell-tale marks on the dovetail slot and the <b>blade</b> <b>sliding</b> direction. The dislodged blade i. e., blade No. 5 and the other I stage rotor blades were examined to look for damages that would have occurred during <b>blade</b> <b>sliding</b> and its ejection from the rotor disc. In the event of <b>blade</b> <b>sliding</b> in the rearward direction, firstly, the blade is expected to have severe damages due to obstruction caused by the stator blades. In such a case, the blade would get fractured into pieces by the impact forces acted upon the blade by the stator blades. Secondly, once the blade moves out of the dovetail slot in the rearward direction, it cannot come out into the air intake without damaging most of the I stage rotor blades. None of these were found to have occurred in the present case and hence, the evidences do not support the theory of <b>blade</b> <b>sliding</b> in the rearward direction. The signatures left on the blade retaining pin and the dovetail slot No. 5 of the rotor disc were analyzed. These signatures also did not conform to the findings of the DI committee wherein it was established that the <b>blade</b> <b>sliding</b> was in the rearward direction. On the contrary, there were adequate evidences to suggest that the <b>blade</b> No. 5 <b>sliding</b> was in the forward direction. A detailed account of the findings is submitted in this report. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{essential}} work of fracture {{approach has}} been employed to analyse the effect of notch sharpening on the fracture toughness of a semicrystalline multiphase ethylene-propylene block copolymer. Double edge notched tension specimens were sharpened using different techniques: femtolaser ablation, razor <b>blade</b> <b>sliding</b> at room and liquid nitrogen temperatures, saw cutting, plastically deformed saw cutting, and scalpel sliding. The notch sharpening techniques provide notches of different quality in relation to both the notch tip radius and the plastic deformation {{in front of the}} crack tip. The best quality notches were produced by the femtolaser ablation technique, which provides very sharp notches without plastic deformation ahead of the crack tip. The effects of the non-collinearity of the notches and tilted specimens on the testing machine grips were also analysed. The shape of the registered stress–displacement curves shows differences, but only in the range comprised between the displacements corresponding to the maximum stress and the onset of crack initiation. A larger crack tip radius and/or larger extent of plastic deformation in front of the notch root leads to larger values of the displacement at the onset of crack initiation, resulting in higher values for the specific essential work of fracture. Yet on the other hand, the values of the slope of the essential work of fracture plot remain unchanged. A lower value for the specific essential work of fracture was obtained for the specimens sharpened using the femtolaser ablation technique. Peer ReviewedPostprint (author's final draft...|$|R
