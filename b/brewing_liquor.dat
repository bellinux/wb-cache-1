The principal component analysis (PCA) was applied over two types of data. First, tea samples with seven different quality grades but same mechanical grading and second, samples with same quality grade but nine different mechanical grades (Brokens, Fannings and Dust) were considered for analysis, respectively. The results of PCA showed that best discrimination (100 %) in both types of data was given by color attributes only. Correlations among tea samples and physical attributes were determined. Based upon these results it may be concluded that color only attributes are the most significant and sufficient for quantification of tea quality whereas other physical attributes contribute so little to quality estimation that they may be ignored...|$|R

Twenty-four green tea samples from eight different countries were brewed as recommended for consumer brewing. The aroma volatiles were extracted by HS-SPME, separated on a gas chromatograph and identified using a mass spectrometer. Thirty-eight compounds were identified and the concentrations were semi-quantified. The concentrations were lower than those reported by other researchers, probably because this research examined headspace volatiles from brewed tea rather than solvent extraction of leaves. No relationship to country of origin was found, which indicates that other factors have a greater influence than country of origin on aroma...|$|R

A real concern is the content of Cu and Fe, which are involved in beer conditioning and ageing through reactions resulting in formation of reactive oxygen species. The reactive oxygen species readily oxidize organic compounds present in beer, changing the quality of foaming and the flavor stability of beer. In view of brewing technology and beer processing, knowledge regarding functions of metals and their speciation forms in <b>brewing</b> <b>liquors</b> and beer is of special significance. Metals in beer have a certain nutritional importance but their actual effect related to beer consumption depends {{on the type of}} species they form with low and high molecular mass organic ligands naturally occurring in beer.
