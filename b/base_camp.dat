5|$|Later that {{afternoon}} Allen {{decided to break}} contact and return to base, to avoid fighting a battle that could last until the evening. In the meantime, however, he called in air-strikes to inflict further damage on the <b>base</b> <b>camp</b> of his primary target, the 271st Regiment. That evening Brigadier General William Coleman and other senior officers of the 1st Infantry Division visited the 2nd Battalion's camp, where they praised Allen's men for their efforts, and presented First Lieutenant Clark Welch—commander of Delta Company—with a Silver Star for his actions earlier in the day. Allen then decided to launch a full-frontal attack against the 271st Regiment's <b>base</b> <b>camp,</b> {{to determine if the}} enemy unit was still there. However, {{due to the lack of}} sufficient manpower, Welch suggested that Allen should either call off the assault or get more soldiers on the ground for the operation. Allen dismissed Welch's suggestions, and responded by giving Captain James George—commander of Alpha Company—the responsibility of leading the attack instead of Welch.|$|E

5|$|But on {{the wings}} the {{situation}} was different. Qanatir, commanding the Byzantine left flank which consisted of mainly Slavs, attacked in force, and the Muslim infantry on the right flank had to retreat. Amr, the Muslim right wing commander ordered his cavalry regiment to counterattack, which neutralized the Byzantine advance and stabilized the battle line on the right for some time, but the Byzantine numerical superiority caused them to retreat towards the Muslim <b>base</b> <b>camp.</b>|$|E

5|$|A Jack Russell named Bothy {{made history}} in 1982 {{as part of}} the Transglobe Expedition. Owned by explorers Ranulph and Ginny Fiennes, he became the first dog to travel to both the north and south poles. This feat is {{unlikely}} to be repeated, as all dogs have been banned from Antarctica by the Antarctic Treaty nations since 1994, due to fears that they could transmit diseases to the native seal population. Ranulph Fiennes and Charles Burton actually made the trip to the north pole by powered sledges before signalling to the <b>base</b> <b>camp</b> that they had arrived. To celebrate their achievement, a plane was sent out to take the two men champagne, along with Bothy.|$|E
5|$|According to his autobiography, it {{was while}} he was in bed with a fever that Wallace thought about Thomas Malthus's idea of {{positive}} checks on human population growth and {{came up with the idea}} of natural selection. Wallace said in his autobiography that he was on the island of Ternate at the time; but historians have questioned this, saying that on the basis of the journal he kept at the time, he was on the island of Gilolo. From 1858 to 1861 he rented a house on Ternate from the Dutchman Maarten Dirk van Renesse van Duivenbode. He used this house as a <b>base</b> <b>camp</b> for expeditions to other islands such as Gilolo.|$|E

5000|$|The term <b>base</b> <b>camping</b> {{refers to}} camping at the (spawning area or {{starting}} area) of one's own team in Capture the Flag, Team Deathmatch {{and other types}} of games, a form of defensive [...] "turtling". One would sit outside one's team base and lie in wait for members of the opposing team. Though hiding or defending key areas of the map, especially if done by a large group, makes it easier to survive enemy attacks, it is sometimes criticized. The general acceptance of <b>Base</b> <b>Camping</b> mainly depends on the map, the kind of game played and the rules set by owners of the server. Games in which one team is to defend its base naturally encourages spawn camping. In situations where the primary of objectives of both teams is to kill enemy players, <b>Base</b> <b>Camping</b> is less well accepted. Sometimes <b>Base</b> <b>Camping</b> is also referred to as Spawn Camping, but this term usually implies camping at the opponent's spawn points. However, the rare occasion where the camper is compromised (e.g., a teammate or enemy takes their camping spot regardless of the camper noting otherwise previously) will throw the camper into killing him/herself willingly, possibly with the intention of killing and/or teamkilling the other player.|$|R
5|$|After {{completing}} his first overseas tour, {{he returned to}} the United States in February 1943 and was assigned to the First Battalion, 23rd Marines, 4th Marine Division at Marine Corps <b>Base</b> <b>Camp</b> Lejeune, North Carolina. When his unit moved to California he again asked for relief as a field musician; and for permission to perform line duties. Again, due to the shortage of buglers in the Marine Corps, his request was denied. Throughout the course of World War II, until his death on Iwo Jima, Cole participated in several battles and campaigns as a machine-gunner and was promoted to the rank of sergeant in 1944.|$|E
5|$|Agreements between Norwegian and Russian {{authorities}} {{were made on}} 31 August, where Norway resumed full responsibility for the recovery and investigation, but Russian help was accepted. To allow the Russian workers access from the morning of 1 September, the crew was allowed to fly in and establish a <b>base</b> <b>camp,</b> but no work was to be done until Norwegian supervisors arrived in the morning. However, two people were observed at the wreck at about 20:00 CEST, who {{were brought to the}} Governor's offices for questioning. As they were both members of the Russian team, it was decided that the base would be disbanded.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} {{two weeks before the}} test, some 250 {{personnel}} from Los Alamos were at work at the Trinity site, and Lieutenant Bush's command had ballooned to 125 men guarding and maintaining the <b>base</b> <b>camp.</b> Another 160 men under Major T.O. Palmer were stationed outside the area with vehicles to evacuate the civilian population in the surrounding region should that prove necessary. They had enough vehicles to move 450 people to safety, and had food and supplies to last them for two days. Arrangements were made for Alamogordo Army Air Field to provide accommodation. Groves had warned the Governor of New Mexico, John J. Dempsey, that martial law might have to be declared in the southwestern part of the state.|$|E

40|$|While it {{has become}} the United Nations (UN) {{responsibility}} to peacekeep the world’s most conflict ridden countries, so too has their impact on the physical environment increased. Large numbers of personnel require equally vast amount of logistical requirements and equipment for the sustainment of operations. <b>Base</b> <b>camps</b> are the focal points from which operations are managed in the field. The ability of peacekeeping <b>base</b> <b>camps</b> to handle their solid waste, both on-site and off-site in low capacity environments, has gained greater attention as environmental concerns have increased globally. Interviews conducted with the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) (acting as a current Troop Contributing Country (TCC) to the United Nations (UN) peacekeeping mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo) determined the problems facing appropriate solid waste collection, treatment and disposal methods utilized in and outside peacekeeping <b>base</b> <b>camps</b> and their specific limitations. It was found that there was inefficient monitoring and follow up processes involved with solid waste contracting providers; {{that there is a need}} for the inclusion of focused solutions during the operational planning stages; and, there is a deficiency in placed responsibility both from within a TCC and between the UN as to how and whom should manage the solid waste emanating from within <b>base</b> <b>camps.</b> This MA dissertation achieved the understanding that there must be greater focus placed on the delineation of responsibility for the management of solid waste within <b>base</b> <b>camps</b> in the documents that initially structure operations between TCCs, the UN and host nations, thereby limiting the impact on the physical environment from peacekeeping to the furthest extent possible.

5|$|On the {{afternoon}} of July 13, 1863, a brigade of 870 Union soldiers departed their <b>base</b> <b>camp</b> located a few miles upriver (east) of Charleston, West Virginia. Their orders, which came from General Eliakim P. Scammon, were to disable the Virginia & Tennessee Railroad. Telegraph line strung along the railroad line was also a target. If circumstances allowed, nearby lead and salt mines would also be objectives. Although the railroad, lead mine, and salt mine were obvious targets, communications sent by General Scammon were in code. Thus, exact details of the plan were known by few.|$|E
5|$|The CIA's base at Camp Chapman {{was set up}} at the {{beginning}} of the U.S.-led offensive against al-Qaeda and the Afghan Taliban in 2001. It began as an improvised center for operations.
