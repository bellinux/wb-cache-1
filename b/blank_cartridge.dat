25|$|A {{powerhead}} or bang stick is {{a device}} which fires a firearms cartridge or <b>blank</b> <b>cartridge</b> {{in contact with}} the target, and relies primarily on the muzzle blast to kill the target. Powerheads are often attached to spears used for spear fishing, or attached to a handle to make a bang stick, which is thrust (while still held) at the target. Bang sticks are often carried for defense against shark attack, but are legally required for alligator hunting in some areas.|$|E
25|$|Delaware and Missouri use {{a lethal}} {{injection}} machine designed by Massachusetts-based Fred A. Leuchter {{consisting of two}} components: the delivery module and the control module. Two staff members each have a station in which they key on the machine and depress two stations' buttons to be ready in case of mechanical failure. Each person presses one station button on the console which travels to a computer which starts all three injections electronically. The computer then deletes who actually started the syringes, so the participants are not aware if their syringe contained saline {{or one of the}} drugs necessary for execution (to assuage guilt {{in a manner similar to}} the <b>blank</b> <b>cartridge</b> in execution by firing squad). The delivery module has eight syringes. The end syringes (i.e., syringes 7 and 8) containing saline, syringes 2, 4 and 6 containing the lethal drugs for the main line and syringes 1, 3 and 5 containing the injections for the back-up line. The system was used in New Jersey before the abolition of the death penalty in 2007. Illinois previously used the computer, and Missouri and Delaware use the manual injection switch on the delivery panel.|$|E
500|$|A {{commonly}} reported {{method of}} blowing {{a man from}} a gun is to tie {{him in front of}} the muzzle of the gun and then have him shot. Loading the cannon with an actual cannonball is on occasion reported; but, more commonly, the use of <b>blank</b> <b>cartridge</b> or grapeshot is attested.

500|$|Things did {{not always}} work out {{according}} to plan at such executions; at a mass execution at Firozpur in 1857, there was an order that <b>blank</b> <b>cartridge</b> should be used, but some loaded with grapeshot instead. Several of the spectators facing the cannons were hit by the grapeshot and some had to have limbs amputated as a result. In addition, some of the soldiers had not been withdrawn properly and sustained damages by being hit by whizzing pieces of flesh and bone. In another case, a soldier who was to be shot managed to fall down just as the shot went off, with the resulting scene taking place: ...|$|E
500|$|In 1924 J. Jovanović {{went public}} stating that his warning {{had been made}} on his own initiative, {{and what he said}} was that [...] "Among the Serb youths (in the army) there may be one who will put a ball-cartridge in his rifle or {{revolver}} in place of a <b>blank</b> <b>cartridge</b> and he may fire it, the bullet might strike the man giving provocation (Franz Ferdinand)." [...] J. Jovanović's account changed {{back and forth over the}} years and never adequately addressed Colonel Lesanin's statement. [...] Bilinski did not speak openly on the subject, but his press department chief confirmed that a meeting had taken place including a vague warning, but there was no mention of an ethnic Serb Austro-Hungarian soldier shooting Franz Ferdinand.|$|E
500|$|The {{requirement}} that the action be dangerous was confirmed in R v Newbury, which applied the previous reasoning on R v Church: [...] "the unlawful act must be such that all sober and reasonable people would inevitably recognise it as an act which must subject the other person to at least the risk of some harm resulting therefrom albeit not serious harm". This is an (almost completely) objective test, it disregards whether the defendant in particular foresaw the danger, and requires only that it would create a risk of some harm. The ordinary person knows only what the defendant did, at least {{in relation to the}} susceptibility of the victim. R v Ball did, however, create a class of dangerous [...] that of the act itself [...] where the jury knew more than the defendant; in this case, whilst the defendant knew he was loading a <b>blank</b> <b>cartridge,</b> the jury was entitled to ascribe knowledge that it might be a live cartridge to the reasonable man. This has been criticised, and may not have been necessary. The act need not be directed at the victim: the killing of an innocent bystander by mistake could be manslaughter.|$|E

This was loaded with a <b>blank</b> <b>cartridge</b> (formed by removing the shot from a standard shotshell), followed by a wooden rod with a Molotov cocktail attached to the front.

2500|$|The [...] "shooting machine" [...] was {{designed}} to be loaded with two lethal rounds and a <b>blank</b> <b>cartridge,</b> each connected to a coiled spring mechanism. The device could be fired by cutting three strings, only one of which would fire the rifles. This design would prevent the three randomly selected prison guards from knowing who would be responsible for triggering the lethal shot. On the morning of May 14, the three guards entered the firing area and then the 12 invited witnesses were admitted to a designated enclosed space in the yard. Mircovich refused an offer for a blindfold from Warden Dickerson and shook his hand, stating: [...] "I much obligated to you. You be good man to me." [...] Mircovich was then strapped to a chair bolted onto a platform in front of the machine. The prison doctor, Donald T. McLean, placed a heart-shaped target on Mircovich's chest. The aim on the loaded rifles were sighted on the defendant’s heart, and checked by each guard. Mircovich cursed the name of Judge Averill and said [...] "I die like a soldier" [...] before he was shot to death.|$|E
