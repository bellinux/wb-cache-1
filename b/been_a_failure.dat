5|$|After FIFA {{was founded}} in 1904, it tried to arrange an {{international}} football tournament between nations outside the Olympic framework in Switzerland in 1906. These were very early days for international football, and the official history of FIFA describes the competition as having <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>failure.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although the {{operation}} had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>failure,</b> it demonstrated the range, flexibility and possibilities of airborne forces and glider operations, and also highlighted equipment failures that were rectified for later operations. This included {{developing a new}} version of the Rebecca-Eureka homing device system, the Mk II, which was ready by 1943 and proved to be very successful when used in later airborne operations; during Operation Market Garden and Operation Varsity, aircraft that used the system reported a 95% success rate.|$|E

5|$|The League of Nations {{has been}} a disappointing failure.... It has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>failure,</b> not because the United States did not join it; but because the great powers have been unwilling to apply {{sanctions}} except where it suited their individual national interests to do so, and because Democracy, on which the original concepts of the League rested for support, has collapsed over half the world.|$|E
5|$|The league {{approached}} the 1996 Grey Cup in dire financial straits: the American expansion had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>failure,</b> the 120-year-old Ottawa Rough Riders franchise ceased {{operations at the}} conclusion of the regular season, and out of the eight remaining teams, seven had lost money and two required direct assistance from the league to stay afloat. The Edmonton Eskimos could not afford to bring their players' families to the championship game. The Toronto Star echoed fears spoken by fans and media across the country when it asked if the 1996 championship, won by Toronto over Edmonton, would be the final Grey Cup.|$|E

5|$|Although the country's {{reliance}} on foreign workers {{has been a}} concern to the Saudi government since the mid-1950s, the situation has persisted because of a reluctance by Saudis to take on menial work and a shortage of Saudi candidates for skilled jobs. This has, in part, been blamed on the Saudi education system, which {{has been criticized for}} its emphasis on religion and rote learning. The Saudi economy has, therefore, remained dependent on Westerners for expertise in specialised industries and on the Asian workforce for the construction industry as well as for menial and unskilled tasks. In response, since 1995 the Saudi government has initiated a policy of Saudization, replacing foreign workers with Saudi nationals. For example, in 2000, it was decreed that the work force of businesses with more than 20 employees must be at least 25 per cent Saudi. In the private sector, there has been a reluctance to employ Saudis and Saudization is generally considered to have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>failure.</b> Saudis themselves may be unwilling to take certain jobs, considering them to lack social value.|$|E
5|$|Det norske Arbeiderforbund was {{supported}} by people from individual factories, but the mainly philanthropic activists {{were associated with the}} Liberal Party. However, the strike at Akers Mekaniske had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>failure,</b> as the laborers had returned to work by on 26 Augustwith a 10% pay cut. It soon faced competition from more worker-dominated trade unions, coordinated through the Fagforeningenes Centralkomite. On the political side, a Labour Party was formed in 1887, and from it the Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions followed in 1899. The historical role of Det norske Arbeiderforbund, as it turned out, was to mark the transition between two kinds of trade unionism; the one dominated by the bourgeois Liberal Party and the one dominated by the socialist Labour Party. The organization became defunct around 1890. The publication Arbeideren was continued, and beginning in 1906, Arbeideren was the party organ of the newly founded Labour Democrats, a non-socialist labour and social reform party associated with the Liberal Party.|$|E
5|$|In October 2006, the NSW Department of Local Government {{announced}} it would investigate the Council's financial management and would try {{to determine whether it}} properly considered the impact the added costs could have on its other functions. The investigation, which commenced on 6 November 2006, was conducted under Section 430 of the , which allows the Director-General of the Department to investigate any aspect of a Council or of its work or activities. The report, delivered in May 2007 to the Minister of Local Government, concluded that the Council did not exercise due diligence and that there had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>failure</b> to scope the project, and recommended to the Minister that a Section 740 public inquiry, which would be independent and have some of the powers and protections of a Royal Commission, be held. A Section 740 inquiry is a necessary step before a Council can be dismissed.|$|E

25|$|However, it was {{revealed}} three months later {{that one of the}} bombs had missed its target by a considerable amount. It seems that there had been some mis-communication {{in the final stages of}} the mission planning, and the pilot had been given the wrong coordinates for the target. However, the media jumped on this event and concluded that the F-117A had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>failure</b> on its first mission.|$|E
25|$|Some {{researchers}} have concluded from {{a convergence of}} findings that Cleckley's concept is probably not a distinct clinical entity, although may represent one important dimension of personality disorder, and has failed to clarify {{the field in the}} way he hoped. Criticisms include that his work was scientifically limited, biased by social value judgments, that there has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>failure</b> to distinguish the hypothesized emotional deficit from that associated with other disorders and to evidence its hypothesized semantic nature or neurological basis, or {{to put it in the}} context of any theory of motivation.|$|E

25|$|The {{novel was}} made into the film Lady in the Lake, {{starring}} and directed by Robert Montgomery. Montgomery tried a technique that had often been talked about in Hollywood but never used in a major film: he used the camera as the protagonist (Philip Marlowe) of the film. Other characters talk directly to the camera. The voice of Marlowe is that of Montgomery, but his face is shown only in reflections. Reviews of the film were not appreciative of the new approach. Most critics gave the director credit for trying an experimental technique but felt the experiment had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>failure.</b>|$|E
25|$|Robert Dollar {{expressed}} ideas concerning one's legacy after death. He wrote: In {{this world}} all we leave behind us {{that is worth}} anything {{is that we can}} be well regarded and spoken of after we are gone, and that we can say that we left the world just a little better than we found it. If we can't accomplish these two things then life, according to my view, has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>failure.</b> Many people erroneously speak of a man when he is gone as having left so much money. That, according to my view, amounts to very little.|$|E
25|$|South Africa’s tour of England in 1960 had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>failure.</b> “From {{nearly every}} {{point of view}} the ninth South African tour of England proved disappointing,” Wisden began its report. First, it was a wet summer, and many matches were {{disrupted}} by rain. Second, the young fast bowler Geoff Griffin was no-balled for throwing on several occasions, effectively ending his career. Third, anti-apartheid demonstrations were held outside most venues. Fourth, none of the young players showed signs of developing into good Test players. Fifth, South Africa lost the first three Tests and drew the other two. Sixth, the tour showed a financial loss. Seventh, apart from McLean the South Africans “found themselves short of enterprising batsmen”.|$|E

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, Federal {{legislation}} yields to state-regulated standard times in many diverse situations. For example, it yields {{in setting the}} normal working times of Federal employees, the recognition of public holidays, etc. The Federal government also relies on local times for Federal elections, so that the polls in Western Australia close {{two or three hours}} after those in the eastern states. Also, documents to be filed in a Federal Court may be filed based on the local time. The effect of this is that if there had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>failure</b> to file a legal document on time in an eastern State, that document can sometimes still be filed (within two hours) in Western Australia.|$|E
25|$|Tony Blair had in 1993, before {{becoming}} Leader of the Labour Party, written a pamphlet for the Fabian Society which criticised {{the wording of}} Clause IV for not clearly stating the means and ends of the party. Blair put forward a case for defining socialism {{in terms of a}} set of values which were constant, while the policies needed to achieve them would have to account for changing society. After becoming Leader, he announced at the conclusion of his 1994 conference speech that the Labour Party needed a new statement of aims and values and that he would draw one up and present it to the party. This astonished many people, as the last time such a move had been taken (by Hugh Gaitskell in the late 1950s), it had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>failure.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Trustees next {{asked the}} civil {{engineer}} John Rennie {{to assess the}} state of the project. His inspection was carried out {{in the presence of the}} Trustees on 13–15 December 1791, and he produced a report within a week. He reported that the section from Stowmarket and Needham Market, the other main town on the waterway, was almost complete, but advised that the towpath would need to be raised in places. There were three turf and timber locks, but he suggested that further locks should be made of brick. He felt that while Jessop had laid out the plans prior to the obtaining of the initial Act of Parliament, there had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>failure</b> to adequately survey the river and detail the works that would be required to construct the navigation. He particularly criticised Lenny's lack of accuracy, and recommended that a new survey should be made, so that the work needed could be identified.|$|E
