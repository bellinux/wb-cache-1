There is improvement in the microstructure with stirring or aeration, but the film composition reverts to the Bi rich state, with close to 90 wt. % Bi for deposition at 5 mA cm(- 2).

The metal bath is often stirred by an inert gas to achieve maximum compositional and thermal uniformity throughout the melt.

40|$|This report {{documents}} the efforts and {{accomplishments of the}} LIGA electrodeposition modeling project which was headed by the ASCI Materials and Physics Modeling Program. A multi-dimensional framework based on GOMA was developed for modeling time-dependent diffusion and migration of multiple charged species in a dilute electrolyte solution with reduction electro-chemical reactions on moving deposition surfaces. By combining the species mass conservation equations with the electroneutrality constraint, a Poisson equation that explicitly describes the electrolyte potential was derived. The set of coupled, nonlinear equations governing species transport, electric potential, velocity, hydrodynamic pressure, and mesh motion were solved in GOMA, using the finite-element method and a fully-coupled implicit solution scheme via Newton's method. By treating the finite-element mesh as a pseudo solid with an arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian formulation and by repeatedly performing re-meshing with CUBIT and re-mapping with MAPVAR, the moving deposition surfaces were tracked explicitly from start of deposition until the trenches were filled with metal, thus enabling the computation of local current densities that potentially influence the microstructure and frictional/mechanical properties of the deposit. The multi-dimensional, multi-species, transient computational framework was demonstrated in case studies of two-dimensional nickel electrodeposition in single and multiple trenches, without and with <b>bath</b> <b>stirring</b> or forced flow.

In this study, we used a combination of micro-computed tomography experiments and biphasic-solute finite element models to study the effects of three parameters of the overlying bath on the diffusion of neutral solutes across cartilage zones.

Sufficient stirring attenuated the effects of the stagnant layer.

40|$|Recent {{advances}} {{in the realm of}} computational modeling of complex multiphysics phenomena in articular cartilage enabled efficient and precise determination of articular cartilage properties. However, still accurate quantification of complicated indentation and diffusion processes tying closely with the inhomogeneity of articular cartilage remains challenging. In the present thesis accurate approaches are proposed to capture the mechanical and physical behavior of articular cartilage as faithfully as possible. Finite element models (FE-models) capable of detecting contact between indenter and cartilage surface are developed and applied to spherical indentation process. To predict mechanical and physical properties of cartilage artificial neural networks (ANN) were used and to guarantee the efficacy of the generated ANN they were trained using simulated noisy force-time data. The combination of FE-model and ANN trained with noisy data allowed obtaining cartilage properties robustly. FE-models taking the inhomogeneity of articular cartilage into account were developed and validated and applied to capture neutral (biphasicsolute model) and charged (multiphasic model) solute transfer across articular cartilage in a finite bath experimental setup. Those models could capture the behavior of solute diffusion across cartilage and provide diffusivities and fixed charge densities (FCD) of different cartilage zones. An algorithm consisting of inverse and forward ANNs was developed to obtain the diffusivities of cartilage layers which eliminates the need for computational expertise. The final goal of this algorithm is to introduce a methodology by which properties of cartilage can be determined without any need for computational expertise, which provides a promising opportunity to meet the needs for clinics when it comes to assess the healthiness of articular cartilage during osteoarthritis progression. Effects of bath osmolarity, concentration and charge of solute were investigated using a combination of micro-CT experiments and FE-models. The results suggested that solute charge unlike the osmoalrity and solute concentration {{had a profound effect on}} solute diffusion. Porosity and thickness of subchondral plate were identified as two primary factors affecting the diffusion of neutral solutes across subchondral plate. Using a developed multi-zone biphasic-solute model allowed obtaining the diffusivities of cartilage layers as well as subchondral plate.

40|$|In this PhD work, a new surface {{treatment}} {{based on the}} application of Zr-based conversion coatings by immersion in a Cu containing Zr-based conversion solution was investigated as a replacement of the traditional phosphating process for the automotive industry. Nowadays most of the cars are made {{of a combination of}} different metals, therefore, one of the aims of this work is to study the formation mechanism of Zr-based conversion coatings on different metallic surfaces. Prior to the immersion in the conversion solution, the metals are exposed to a surface conditioning treatment to remove the contaminants which might interfere {{in the formation of the}} film. Taking this into consideration, this PhD thesis is also focused on understanding the effect of the surface conditioning treatments on the deposition mechanism and kinetics of Zr-based conversion coatings on different alloys. In the first part of this PhD work, the formation mechanism and surface characteristics of Zr-based conversion coatings deposited on aluminium alloy 6014 (AA 6014), cold rolled steel and hot dip galvanized steel were evaluated. This was done by combining Open Circuit Potential (OCP) measurements during the formation of the coatings and ex-situ surface analytical techniques. The results indicated that regardless of the metal, the deposition of the Zr-based conversion coating initiates and proceeds by the same mechanism. This process is initiated by the chemical dissolution of the oxide film by the free fluorides present in the conversion bath. This is followed by the deposition of the Zr-based conversion films, which is triggered by the alkalization of the metal/solution interface. Furthermore, the results also showed that the surface chemistry, elemental distribution and thickness of the resulting Zr based conversion coatings highly depend on the type of metallic substrate. The effect of convection on the formation of Zr-based conversion coatings on different metals was also assessed by implementing in-situ OCP measurements and Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES) depth profiles. The results indicate that the conversion film thickness increases with the conversion <b>bath</b> <b>stirring</b> rate, but this increment depends on the metal substrate. The second part of this PhD thesis is focused on understanding the effect of the surface conditioning treatments on the deposition of Zr-based conversion coatings. A surface conditioning treatment can significantly modify the chemistry of the oxide film, such as the fraction of hydroxyl groups present in the outer part of the films. To investigate the influence of this parameter on the formation of the Zr-based conversion films, different model surface conditioning treatments were implemented in order to form oxide films with different hydroxyl fractions at similar oxide layer thicknesses prior to immersion in the conversion solution. The elemental distribution and surface chemistry of differently treated AA 6014 and cold rolled steel specimens before and after the formation of the films were evaluated by means of AES depth profiles, Field Emission AES and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). The OCP as a function of time was recorded during the formation of the films in order to study the electrochemical reactions involved in the process insitu. The results show that for AA 6014, higher hydroxyl fractions are beneficial for the formation of the Zr-based conversion coatings. The observed trend is linked to the effect of surface hydroxyls in the first stage of the formation of the Zr-based conversion coating, which is dissolution of the metal (hydr) oxides by the free fluorides present in the conversion solution. In addition, the results presented in this study indicate an inhomogeneous Cu distribution within the Zr-based conversion layers deposited on the differently treated AA 6014. It was concluded that these variations in the Cu composition at the surface originate from the surface conditioning treatment and the Zr-based conversion treatment. The results presented in this part of this PhD thesis show that the largest impact of the surface hydroxyls on the formation of Zr-based conversion coatings is observed on AA 6014, followed by zinc and for cold rolled steel no effect was observed.

The dried samples were dissolved in APTS (8 -Aminopyrene- 1, 3, 6 -trisulfonic acid trisodium salt, BECKMAN COULTER) sodium cyanoborohydride buffer (containing 5  mg APTS labeling dye in 48  μl 15 % acetic acid) and incubated overnight at 50 °C. After the incubation, the samples were boiled in a urea solution (6  mM) for 1  min and filtered through Wizard miniColumns (Promega). Determination of the chain length distribution (CLD) of amylopectin was conducted by fluorescence-activated CE as previously described (O’Shea and Morell 1996).|$|R
30|$|The amino-terminated hyperbranched polymer was {{synthesized}} as {{our previous}} work [16]. Tetraethylenepentamine (94  ml, 0.5  mol) {{was added to}} a 250 -ml three-necked round-bottomed glass flask equipped with nitrogen gas protection and magnetic stirring. The reaction mixture was stirred with a heating magnetic agitator and cooled with an ice bath, while a solution of methyl acrylate (43  ml, 0.5  mol) in methanol (100  ml) was added dropwise into the flask. Then, the mixture {{was removed from the}} ice <b>bath</b> and left <b>stirring</b> for a further 4  h at room temperature. The mixture was transferred to an eggplant-shaped flask for automatic rotary vacuum evaporation, and the temperature was raised to 150  °C using an oil bath, and left for 4  h until yellowish viscid HBP scale was obtained with a weight average molecular weight about 7759.|$|R
30|$|Epigyne {{structures}} {{were removed from}} animal specimens and stored in 70 % ethanol at room temperature prior to preparation. Samples were washed repeatedly with distilled water before treatment with enzymes. The epigyne, (ca. 10 mg each) were incubated in 1.0 mL diluted enzyme solution at pH 4.0, 6.0 or 8.0, and for different times in a 42 °C water <b>bath</b> with continuous <b>stirring.</b> The samples were washed and suspended in water, then sonicated (Sonicador ULTRONICS UL 16, Teltow, Germany) for 15 min. Subsequently, they were rinsed again and stored in 70 % ethanol at room temperature until microscopically analysis. Negative controls included epigyne incubated without added enzyme in distilled water for 22 h at 42 °C followed by sonication and storage. The enzymatic removal was evaluated by optical microscopy.|$|R
40|$|National Nature Science Founds of China [61405221, 61378069, 51302284]; Youth Innovation Promotion Association of CAS, Shanghai City Star Program [14 QB 1400900, 14 QB 1402100]Transparent Er 3 +-doped CaF 2 -silica glass {{ceramics}} were {{prepared by the}} direct physical introduction of Er 3 + doped CaF 2 nanocrystals into acid-catalyzed sol-gel silica glass. The physical methods of ball milling, ultrasonic <b>baths,</b> and <b>stirring</b> were investigated to disperse Er 3 + doped CaF 2 nanocrystals in the silica sols. The CaF 2 -silica sol mixture went through gelation and heat-treatment to form Er 3 +-doped CaF 2 -silica {{glass ceramics}}. The morphology of Er 3 + doped CaF 2 in silica glass did not change after heat-treatment at 600 degrees C for 10 h. The experimental results showed that Er 3 + doped CaF 2 in the glass ceramic prepared {{with the assistance of}} ball milling possesses the best dispersity and homogeneity. The highest in-line transmittance of the glass ceramic reached up to 85 % in visible region. Glass ceramic exhibits efficient up-conversion emissions corresponding to the Er 3 +:F- 4 (9 / 2) -> I- 4 (15 / 2) transition and long lifetime of F- 4 (9 / 2) level (1. 73 ms) under 980 nm excitation.

30|$|CeF 3 : Eu 3 + solid {{precipitate}} {{was prepared}} {{in a typical}} procedure as follows: 1.9 mmol Ce (NO 3) 3 · 6 H 2 O and 0.1 mmol of Eu(NO 3) 3 · 6 H 2 O were dissolved in 25 mL of diethylene glycol (DEG, 98.0 %) in a round-bottomed flask at 100 °C under stirring to form a clear solution. The solution was then heated in a silicon oil <b>bath</b> under vigorous <b>stirring</b> with a flow of N 2 atmosphere, and {{the temperature of the}} solution was further increased to 200 °C. At this temperature, a solution of DEG (25 mL) containing 6 mmol of NH 4 F was injected into the solution, and the mixture was kept at 200 °C for 1 h. Then, the obtained suspension was cooled to room temperature and diluted with 50 mL of ethanol. The solid particles were separated by centrifugation.|$|R
30|$|In {{the typical}} synthesizing process, 1  g CuSO 4 · 5 H 2 O was {{dissolved}} in 20  ml EG (ethylene glycol), and a beaker containing the CuSO 4 polyol solution was heated to 90  °C {{in a water}} <b>bath</b> with magnetic <b>stirring.</b> Meanwhile, a three-mouth flask containing 2  g NaPO 2 H 2 ·H 2 O, 6  g PVP (polyvinyl pyrrolidone), and 80  ml EG was heated to 90  °C under the same condition. After 15  min of heating, the CuSO 4 polyol solution was poured into the three-mouth flask rapidly, and the reaction had been completed after 25  min of continuous heating. The Cu nanoparticles were collected by washing the final dispersion for five times with ethanol and deionized water at 8500  rpm via centrifugation. The Cu nanoparticle paste was fabricated by mixing 65  wt% synthesized Cu nanoparticles and 35  wt% butanol at 2000  rpm for 5  min through vacuum mixer.|$|R
30|$|Polyethylene {{polyamine}} (1  M, 104  ml) {{was added}} in a 250 -ml three-neck round-bottomed glass flask equipped with a constant-voltage dropping funnel, a thermometer, and a nitrogen inlet tube. The solution was stirred with a magnetic agitator. The flask was cooled to 24 °C using a circulating water bath. Simultaneously, the mixture of methacrylate (1  M, 86  ml) in methanol was dropped slowly into the flask through the funnel. Afterwards, the reacting solution in the flask {{was removed from the}} water <b>bath</b> and left <b>stirring</b> for 4  h at room temperature. AB 2 -type monomers were synthesized, which made the solution present a light yellow color[15]. The solution was transferred to an eggplant-shaped flask and put into an automatic rotary vacuum evaporator. After evaporation of methanol under low pressure, the temperature was raised to 150 °C using an oil bath to initiate the polymerization of the monomers. Eventually, a yellowish viscous multi-amino compound (RSD-NH 2) was obtained with a 4 -h polymerization.|$|R
30|$|Graphene oxide was {{prepared}} by the modified Hummer's method [12, 13]. The graphite flakes (PN 332461, 4 g; Sigma Aldrich, Sigma-Aldrich Sweden AB,) were first put in H 2 SO 4 (98 %, 12 mL) and kept at 80 °C for 5 h. The resulting solution was cooled down to room temperature. Mild sonication was performed in a water bath for 2 h to further delaminate graphite into a few micron flakes. Sonication time and power are very critical as they define {{the size of the}} resulting graphene oxide sheets. Excessive sonication leads to extremely small flakes. Then, the solution was diluted with 0.5 L deionized (DI) water and left overnight. The solution was filtered by Nylon Millipore™ filters (Billerica, MA 01821). The resulting powder was mixed with KMnO 4 and H 2 SO 4 and put in a cooling <b>bath</b> under constant <b>stirring</b> for 1.5 h. The solution was diluted with DI water, and 20 mL H 2 O 2 (30 %) was added to it.|$|R
40|$|An osmotic {{dehydration}} process (ODP) {{was established}} in order to formulate osmodehydrated fruits from lemon and date by-products. ODP was conducted at 40 degrees C, maintained using an oven, or a water <b>bath</b> with continuous <b>stirring.</b> The kinetics of the osmodehydration in a water bath showed a better mass transfer. Then, osmodehydrated fruit (ODF) preparations of about 40 degrees Brix were formulated using different isotonic solutions (sucrose, glucose/sucrose, glucose, and date juice). All the formulated products showed better characteristics (lower acidity, higher sugar content, etc.) than the untreated lemon by-product. The isotonic solution composition influenced their physical characteristics such as microstructure and viscosity. In fact, ODF prepared in glucose and glucose/sucrose solutions presented more open structures, lower viscosities, and water holding capacities (WHC) than the others. The products were microbiologically stable during 3 months at 4 degrees C. These results support the valorization of lemon and date by-products as ODF that could be consumed or incorporated as an ingredient in food formulations. Peer reviewe...|$|R
