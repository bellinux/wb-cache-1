5|$|Budd built 361 Amfleet I coaches; 90 were {{configured}} for long-distance use (60 seats) and 271 for short-distance use (84 seats). All 125 Amfleet II {{coaches were}} designed for long-distance service and contained 59 seats. In all standard Amfleet coaches seating is 2×2; in the Amfleet II a single accessible seat accounted for the odd number. Amfleet seats have swing-down tray-tables for at-seat food service, as well as overhead and underseat luggage storage. There are two restrooms {{at one end of}} the car. There is a <b>baggage</b> <b>rack</b> at the end of the car. On some cars these have been replaced with a bicycle rack.|$|E
2500|$|Feagans in {{the early}} 1970s was able to trace many relics of the railroad. [...] He was also able to {{interview}} people who well remembered the railroad and who had even worked on it. [...] These sources may have helped Feagans as he traced down at least four passenger coaches that had been lifted off their trucks and converted into housing units in various locations in Long Beach. [...] He located and photographed various artifacts including a <b>baggage</b> <b>rack</b> and an iron coach stove. [...] Feagans also photographed {{the ruins of the}} trestle crossing the Wallacut river and the dock at Nahcotta, as well as places where the rails for whatever reason, had been left in place.|$|E
50|$|Suburbans for {{model year}} 1973 now had two doors {{on each side}} (the {{previous}} generation had just one door on the driver's side), front-and-rear air conditioning, a <b>baggage</b> <b>rack,</b> a heater under the third seat and step-plates for easier access. A new Eaton Automatic Differential Lock was introduced as an option extra for the rear differential.|$|E
50|$|Many road bikes, {{along with}} {{mountain}} bikes, include clipless pedals to which special shoes attach, via a cleat, enabling the rider {{to pull on}} the pedals as well as push. Other possible accessories for the bicycle include front and rear lights, bells or horns, child carrying seats, cycling computers with GPS, locks, bar tape, fenders (mud-guards), <b>baggage</b> <b>racks,</b> <b>baggage</b> carriers and pannier bags, water bottles and bottle cages.|$|R
40|$|Stand {{at any of}} South Africa’s border {{posts and}} watch who is {{crossing}} the border to neighbouring states. Women with heads and arms laden, bakkies and cars overloaded with goods, mini-bus taxis pulling trailers, and lorries—big and small filled to the brim. Trains and buses pull in with full <b>baggage</b> <b>racks.</b> Many of these vehicles are carrying informal sector cross-border traders, peopl...|$|R
5|$|The 50-seat coaches {{featured}} 2x2 seating, with <b>baggage</b> <b>racks</b> in {{the vestibule}} end and separate men's and women's restrooms in the other. The dining-cocktail lounge had half its space devoted to a kitchen and bar area; two seating areas in the other end seated 12 and 24, respectively. Two of the sleeping cars contained 12 open sections, with daytime seating for 24; the third contained eight enclosed sections, two double bedrooms, and a compartment, giving the car a maximum occupancy of 22. The sleeper-lounge-observation car included a compartment, five more double bedrooms, and a rear observation area which seated 22. The cars were air-conditioned throughout.|$|R
50|$|The Stream was styled and priced as {{a luxury}} {{personal}} scooter. Honda's suggest retail price in 1981 was ¥198,000, compared to ¥114,000 for a 49cc Super Cub. Unlike the Cub, the Stream can only carry one rider {{and has no}} <b>baggage</b> <b>rack.</b> Its only cargo capacity is a small forward compartment rated for 5 kg, and a glovebox rated for 2 kg. It was discontinued in 1984.|$|E
5000|$|The 1981 CT250S Silk Road was Honda's {{attempt at}} a [...] "trekking" [...] motorcycle, marketed between its {{mechanical}} siblings, the CB250RS road bike and the XL250 dirt bike. It has slightly more ground clearance than the CB250RS, and an upswept and close-fitted chrome exhaust that is kept clear of both debris and luggage. The Silk Road was offered with a single saddle followed by a chrome <b>baggage</b> <b>rack.</b> A removable pillion seat can be fitted to this rack. Its 6-speed transmission is geared as a regular 5-speed plus one extra-low gear.|$|E
50|$|Despite the {{severity}} of the wreck, the death toll was low due to circumstances permitting quick rescue: area hospitals were at shift changes with doubled staff levels, a 2,400-person Vermont National Guard detachment with helicopters and a tank retriever was nearby preparing for training, and a large mobile crane was at a construction site in nearby Georgia, Vermont. The National Transportation Safety Board investigation faulted Amtrak for the lack of a proper cab radio and recommended changes in locomotive battery placement, improvements in <b>baggage</b> <b>rack</b> and seat cushion retention, and the use of shatterproof mirrors in passenger cars.|$|E
50|$|The {{exterior}} of the 2000 series {{is different from the}} 8000 series with the unpainted stainless steel body wrapped by lines in the corporate colors, green and blue. The logo mark next to the doors on the 8000 series is not present. The carriage has been changed to the same core-type pneumatic rubber tires used on the 1000 series. The interior is also different from the 8000 series with warm-colored box seats in a 2+1 arrangement. It is also equipped with overhead <b>baggage</b> <b>racks</b> and blinds. As in the 8000 series there is piping on the ceiling above the entry/exit doors to substitute for hand straps, but its shape is different. The communications device has been changed to intercom-form.|$|R
5|$|One of {{the most}} notable {{features}} of the Cunard Building are the large basement and sub-basement levels that initially acted as storage facilities for both the Company's property and also the luggage of passengers. Coal was also stored in the basement, with a small railway track providing {{a link to the}} boiler room, which was used to heat the building. Many original features of the basement still exist, including the timber <b>baggage</b> <b>racks,</b> ship logs and other maritime documents. Several secure vaults, which in the past were used to store the most valuable passenger items, are still used today to hold historic documents, drawings and blueprints relating to the Cunard Building and also some of Cunard's Liners, such as the RMS Queen Mary.|$|R
5000|$|Oxford Crown Court {{was told}} that the coach driver was {{speaking}} to passengers via the public address system, making a [...] "safety announcement" [...] while speeding round a bend. One witness described Rooney's control of the coach as he [...] "drove like a man possessed". It was confirmed on the Court record that {{as a direct result of}} Rooney's actions, two persons died in the crash, and a further person died on 1 July 2007. Furthermore, four passengers had to have limbs amputated, and many more needed to be cut from the wreckage by firefighters using special cutting equipment. The Court also heard that Rooney had previous speeding convictions, and that he had repeatedly exceeded speed limits on this journey, as proven by tachograph evidence. Rooney's manner of driving, particularly his heavy braking, caused luggage to fall from the overhead <b>baggage</b> <b>racks.</b>|$|R

50|$|After graduating with a B.A. {{degree in}} Sports Information in 1990, {{he knew he}} did not want to do broadcasting. He took up a job as a hotel valet where, on his second day, he tore a <b>baggage</b> <b>rack</b> off the top of a van by trying to drive it under a low-lying beam. He also worked as a teller at Wells Fargo, but came up short $300 the first day and $280 the second; he was not {{stealing}} the money, but was just careless and error-prone. In 1991, encouraged by his mother to pursue something he liked, Ferrell moved to Los Angeles. He successfully auditioned for the comedy group The Groundlings, where he spent time developing his improvisation skills.|$|E
60|$|All the {{well-known}} stations were flashing by now. In {{a few minutes}} he {{would be at the}} junction, and in another half-hour back at Blackburn's. He began to collect his <b>baggage</b> from the <b>rack.</b>|$|R
50|$|The E235 series {{design was}} {{developed}} from the earlier E233 series trains, and like the E233 and E231 series trains, the new E235 series trains have stainless steel bodies. The exterior styling was overseen by the industrial design firm Ken Okuyama Design. The cars feature vertical green stripes running through the doors, {{as opposed to the}} former usage of horizontal stripes to allow easier identification of the line at platforms. <b>Baggage</b> <b>racks</b> and hand-holds have been lowered 5 cm for easier access and the seats are 1 cm wider than previous trains. The car interiors also have up to 36 digital monitors for various informational displays. The window behind the drivers cab has been lowered so children can get a better view of the operator of the cars. The temperature of each car is also monitored; the system can predict the number of passengers at upcoming stations and adjust the temperature for passenger comfort. This information is also communicated to a smart phone application, allowing customers to choose in which car to ride based on their temperature preference.|$|R
50|$|GMC also {{introduced}} its model PD 4901 in 1954 {{so as to}} have a 40 foot model to sell to non-Greyhound operators. It was mechanically identical to the Scenicruiser but the driver and passengers were all at nearly the same high level as the Scenicruiser's upper deck. Like the PD 4104, the PD 4901 had a flat floor so the seats were a few inches lower than in the PD 4501 and this allowed taller overhead <b>baggage</b> <b>racks</b> The only one produced was clad in gold anodized aluminum paneling and GMC called it the Golden Chariot. No bus operating company in the country wanted {{to take on the}} additional complexity and fuel consumption of this dual engined model and none were ever ordered by any American coach operator. The fact that Greyhound's troubles with its Scenicruisers were already well known was enough to keep potential buyers away from it. GMC leased it first to Greyhound and then to several other smaller carriers in the northeast and finally sold it as a used bus. This coach is currently owned by Wilson Bus Lines in Massachusetts who want to restore it to its former glory.|$|R
5000|$|In 1934 FitzJohn {{introduced}} its 11-passenger stretchout model 100. It {{was based on}} the Chevrolet Master Sedan which was split in the middle, had an extra body section inserted and a <b>baggage</b> <b>rack</b> added to the roof. The 100 was an immediate success, primarily as an economical [...] "mini-coach" [...] for feeder routes, although some were used for airport transfers or sightseeing services. During World War II, when many other bus manufacturers suspended production in favour of war materiel, the War Production Board directed FitzJohn to build a 15-passenger version of the 100. Otherwise-surplus Chevrolet, Pontiac and Packard sedans had extra rows of back-to-back seats installed, but because of wartime restrictions, white ash framing and Masonite panels were used instead of metal. Sixty-two enclosed auto haulers were also converted to passenger-carrying trailers in 1943.|$|E
40|$|The {{idea about}} the CyberBike came to Jens G. Balchen - {{the founder of the}} Department of Engineering Cybernetics (ITK) at NTNU - in the 1980 's. He wanted to make an {{unmanned}} autonomus bicycle, i. e. a bike that could run by itself. The idea was picked up by Amund Skavhaug, who started the CyberBike project in the late 80 's. After being deffered for some years, the CyberBike has again gained some attention. This master's thesis is based on Hans Olav Loftum's and Lasse Bjermeland's theses at the spring 2006 and the autumn project of John A. Fossum the same year. The goal of the CyberBike project is to make the bike work as intended, i. e. as an autonomous unmanned bicycle. This thesis naturally share this goal, although the bike did not become able to take its first autonomous trip within the thesis' time frame. At the start of the work, the bike were already equipped with a suitcase of computational hardware on its <b>baggage</b> <b>rack,</b> a small QNX Neutrino OS image was installed on the industrial PC mounted in the suitcase, and drivers for the installed motors, tachometers and potmeters were written. An Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) was intended to supply the control system with the necessary information about rotation, acceleration and position, and the unit was purchased for the purpose. Also a driver was written, but not properly tested. The IMU had to be installed and connected to the control system. The bike's control theory was developed, but had never been put into action outside computer simulations (due to the lack of acceleration measurements). The various tasks that had to be addressed emerged as the development process advanced. First, the IMU had to be connected to the system, by making a signal tranceiver circuit. A small printed circuit board was designed and laid out, mainly to include a MAX 233 CPP iC. Then the DB- 9 serial connector on the bikes single board computer (Wafer- 9371 A) could be used to read the UART signal from the IMU as RS- 232. Then some testing had to be done, and drivers updated. A better and more advanced IMU (referred to as the "MTi") was added to the project. This unit needed no signal converting circuitry, but driver development and testing still had to be done. To enhance the CyberBike's navigation opportunities, a GPS module was purchased. A signal transceiving circuit, similar to the one for the IMU, was made for this unit, as well as software to read out the measurements from the device. By the end of this thesis, no navigational algorithms are made, hence the GPS is currently not used, but available for future efforts made on this area. Some hardware related tasks was carried out, as connecting and implementing functionality to the pendulum limit switches, installation of a emergency stop switch and a power switch, purchasing and installation of two 12 V batteries and a cooling fan. An operating system upgrade resulted in replacing the CyberBikePC's storage device, a compact flash card, with a mobile hard disk drive. Installation of a motor, for supplying torque to the rear wheel, included setup and tuning of a hardware based velocity controller in a Baldor TFM 060 - 06 - 01 - 3 servo module. However; this task is not to be considered as accomplished, due to some unsolved problems on the system I/O-card's output channels giving the motor controller card its reference voltage. A bike model and controller realized in Simulink was made by Bjermeland. Hence communicaton between Simulink and the device drivers had to be established, and this was realized by using S-functions and Real-Time Workshop. Finally the controller could be connected to the actual bike, but there was too little time left to explore this thoroughly, and make the system work properly. However, a foundation is laid for further development of the control strategy, hopefully storing a bright future for the CyberBike. </p...|$|E
