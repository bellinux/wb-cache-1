5|$|Despite the {{strained}} {{relationship between}} Kennedy and Bush over No Child Left Behind spending, the two attempted {{to work together}} again on extending Medicare to cover prescription drug benefits. Kennedy's strategy was again doubted by other Democrats, but he saw the proposed $400billion program as an opportunity {{that should not be}} missed. However, when the final formulation of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act contained provisions to steer seniors towards private plans, Kennedy switched to opposing it. It passed in late 2003, and led Kennedy to again say he had been betrayed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>administration.</b>|$|E

Jay Garner in Iraq and served for several months as a senior staff member in the Ministry of Industry and Minerals {{as part of the}} Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) that governed Iraq in the {{aftermath}} of U.S. forces overthrowing the regime of Saddam Hussein. Upon arrival in Baghdad, he became critical of the plan set out by CPA, making clear that Iraq czar Paul Bremer's ideological vision was impeding progress that could have been made to stabilize Iraq. He left Baghdad two months after arriving in April 2003, disillusioned by an inability to execute a more pragmatic plan for Iraq's reconstruction. Carney returned to Washington where he made known his disagreement with the Bremer plan. In 2007,Under a significant reorganization of the Iraq reconstruction effort <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> that witnessed other policy dissenters return to Baghdad, Carney was asked by the State Department to return to the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad to oversee the overall U.S. effort to rebuild Iraq.|$|E
