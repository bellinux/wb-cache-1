5|$|The Cunningham–Rawnsley team {{used the}} AI {{specifically}} to position themselves directly astern and underneath the enemy. Although the German bombers carried a dorsal gunner, {{it was difficult}} to locate an enemy against the black colour of the landscape. Usually the blackness of the country would swallow up the outline of an approaching night fighter. As they approached, the slipstream of the enemy could prove hazardous; <b>bucking</b> the Beaufighter and throwing the pilot off his aim. Approaching from slightly below allowed the attacking pilot to avoid the slipstream. The tactics allowed for Cunningham to close the range and fire first, which was usually sufficient to end the engagement quickly and successfully. Bob Braham, a rival night fighter ace, also used this tactic.|$|E
5|$|From the 1840s onwards more mines {{provided}} crude shelters {{to protect}} surface {{workers from the}} worst of the weather, but at many others work at surface-level took place in the open air. Workers were generally expected to remain at their posts except in the most extreme weather conditions. Bal maidens wore gooks, a specialised bonnet which covered the shoulders and extended over the face to protect from rain, bright sunlight, flying debris and loud noise. In the winter the gook was made of felt, and in summer of cotton. Working in close proximity to heavy industrial machinery, they wore shorter dresses or skirts than the ankle-length clothing typical of the period, and their exposed lower legs were wrapped in protective coverings. Their arms were sometimes protected by hessian sleeves worn over their clothes. Some bal maidens working in cobbing and <b>bucking</b> wore rubber tubing on the fingers of one hand as protection from their hammer. While working bal maidens wore a waist-length hessian apron ('towser') over their clothes, and those who could afford it would have a white herden (flax and hemp) apron for wearing to and from work. These working clothes were accessorised with flowers, bows, ribbons, jewellery and other decoration. Until the end of the 19thcentury the working clothing of a bal maiden changed very little.|$|E

5|$|While 18thcentury metal mines {{had worked}} on the {{principle}} of adult men digging the ore and women and children picking and cobbing the ore ready for smelting, in the new large-scale mines of the early 19thcentury working practices changed. The strenuous underground work was still carried out by male workers, as was breaking large rocks with heavy hammers ('ragging'). In copper mines, very young girls, and sick and injured older women, carried out the simple work of picking. Girls in their late teens forced the broken ore through a broad mesh to sort the ore ('riddling'), and used hammers to break the large chunks of ore left by the riddling process into smaller chunks. Girls in their mid-teens cobbed the resulting chunks, separating the valuable ore from waste rock. Grown women would carry out the heavy manual labour of breaking rocks with hammers ('spalling'), of crushing sorted ore to small grains ready for smelting ('bucking') and of transporting ore between various pieces of apparatus. An experienced bal maiden working as a spaller would produce approximately one ton (2240lb; 1016kg) of broken ore per day, {{depending on the type of}} stone. In the tin mines, in which ore could be crushed far more finely than copper before smelting, cobbing and <b>bucking</b> did not take place. Instead, the chunks of spalled ore were mechanically stamped to fine grains, and washed into a series of collecting pits to separate the coarse 'rough' from the fine 'slimes'. The resulting rough and slimes were separated out on large wooden frames ('buddling' and 'framing' respectively), to extract the tin ore from the surrounding dust and grit.|$|E
