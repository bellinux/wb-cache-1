50|$|<b>Bactrian</b> <b>deer</b> have, like Yarkand deer, short tails {{similar to}} the short tails of wapitis. The calves are {{generally}} born spotted much like European red deer calves, and most individuals lose their spots by adulthood. However, adult <b>Bactrian</b> <b>deer</b> may have a few spots {{on the backs of}} their summer coats. This phenomenon has also been observed in summer coats of the distantly related Manchurian wapiti (Cervus canadensis xanthopygus) and many other subspecies of red deer (Cervus elaphus).|$|E

50|$|The {{fourth and}} final reserve houses herbivorous species native to Asia, such as Père David's <b>deer,</b> <b>Bactrian</b> camels, Nilgai, Axis deer and Eld's deer. In April 2016 the park welcomed the birth of two Père David's deer, a species now extinct in the wild.|$|R
50|$|Passage through Asia {{is a large}} paddock with no {{boundaries}} between visitors and the animals. Visitors can only access the area by driving through it in their own cars or riding on the Jumbo Express train. The paddock houses herds of <b>Bactrian</b> camels, hog <b>deer,</b> yak, chital and Père David's deer and Blackbuck.|$|R
50|$|Genetic {{evidence}} {{clearly shows}} the wapiti and western red deer form two separate species.Among western red deer, the easternmost forms (from the Caspian Sea to western China) form a primordial subgroup, {{which includes the}} Yarkand deer and <b>Bactrian</b> <b>deer</b> (the two may be synonymous).|$|E
50|$|The Yarkand deer lives {{along the}} Tarim River in Xinjiang {{south of the}} Tian Shan. The <b>Bactrian</b> <b>deer</b> lives north of the Tian Shan in {{northern}} Xinjiang and Central Asian Republics. The Tibetan red deer, Gansu red deer, Sichuan deer have been alternatively categorized as subspecies of the elk or the Central Asian red deer.|$|E
50|$|The Yarkand deer (Cervus elaphus yarkandensis) is a {{subspecies}} of Red Deer that is {{native to}} central Asia. It is similar in ecology to the <b>Bactrian</b> <b>deer</b> in occupying lowland riparian corridors surrounded by deserts. Both populations are isolated from one another by the Tian Shan Mountains and probably form a primordial subgroup of Red Deer.|$|E
5000|$|In 1988, {{researcher}} Sergey A. Zimov {{established the}} Pleistocene Park in northeastern Siberia {{to test the}} possibility of restoring {{a full range of}} grazers and predators, with the aim of recreating an ecosystem similar to the one in which mammoths lived. Yakutian horses, reindeer, snow sheep, elk and moose were reintroduced, and reintroduction is also planned for yak, <b>bactrian</b> camels, red <b>deer,</b> and Siberian tigers. The wood bison, a close relative of the ancient bison that died out in Siberia 1000 or 2000 years ago, is also an important species for the ecology of Siberia. In 2006, 30 bison calves were flown from Edmonton, Alberta to Yakutsk and placed in the government-run reserve of Ust'-Buotama. This project remains controversial — a letter published in Conservation Biology accused the Pleistocene camp of promoting [...] "Frankenstein ecosystems," [...] stating that [...] "the biggest problem is not the possibility of failing to restore lost interactions, but rather the risk of getting new, unwanted interactions instead." [...] The authors proposed that—rather than trying to restore a lost megafauna—conservationists should dedicate themselves to restoring existing species to their original habitats.|$|R
50|$|This deer {{is found}} in central Khorasan. It {{is found in}} Russian Turkestan (West Turkestan) and {{adjacent}} areas in northern Afghanistan {{to the west of}} the Tian Shan Mountains. <b>Bactrian</b> <b>deer</b> live in lowland riparian corridors of mixed deciduous (willow/poplar) vegetation surrounded by deserts. They do not migrate but may disperse into adjacent desert areas at night or at times of cooler temperatures.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Bactrian</b> <b>deer</b> (Cervus elaphus bactrianus), {{also called}} the Bukhara deer, Bokhara deer or Bactrian wapiti, is a lowland {{subspecies}} of red deer that is native to Central Asia. It is similar in ecology to the Yarkand deer in occupying riparian corridors surrounded by deserts. Both subspecies are separated from one another by the Tian Shan Mountains and probably form a primordial subgroup of red Deer.|$|E
50|$|The Badai Tugai Nature Reserve {{is located}} at the banks of the Amu Darya river in Uzbekistan. It was founded in 1971 on 6400 ha and is the only Nature Reserve in the {{republic}} of Karakalpakstan. The reserve contains riparian vegetation, including poplar forests and is home of 91 species of birds and 21 species of mammals. Among them is the rare <b>Bactrian</b> <b>deer.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{area was}} one of the last strongholds of the Caspian tiger, whose tracks were seen in the reserve for the last time in 1953. As of today, Tigrovaya Balka is still home to the {{original}} main prey of the tiger, the rare <b>Bactrian</b> <b>deer.</b> Other larger species of the reserve include striped hyenas, golden jackals, swamp cats, wild boars, goitered gazelles, porcupines, the introduced nutrias, gray wolves, red foxes and in hills also urials.|$|E
50|$|Potential sites at southeastern Kazakhstan's river deltas such as Lake Balkhash and Ili River {{were also}} chosen as {{suitable}} habitats for the Siberian tigers. Dr. Igor Chestin of World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) hopes to reintroduce tigers {{into the wild}} in Kazakhstan’s marshy Balkhash region {{within the next few}} years, though there are needs to reestablish the potential prey base in the areas first, such as saiga antelopes and goitered gazelles. A reintroduction of the <b>Bactrian</b> <b>deer</b> to the Ili delta and the Asiatic wild ass to the Kazakh steppes are under work.|$|E
5000|$|In {{contrast}} to the Yarkand deer, which has a light sandy coat, the <b>Bactrian</b> <b>deer</b> has a darker, grayish-brown coat pattern with darker legs, head, and neck (most noticeable in males) that resembles the coat of the American elk or wapitis, which is why this subspecies is sometimes called the Bactrian wapiti. These deer do not have neck manes, but do have stronger and thicker neck muscles than female deer that may {{give the appearance of}} a neck mane. Female deer are slightly smaller than male deer, but the difference in size is not as pronounced {{as it is in the}} European red deer subspecies.|$|E
50|$|Within the {{red deer}} species group, some sources have {{recommended}} the elk or wapiti (C. canadensis) and central Asian red deer {{should be treated}} as species. If the central Asian red deer (from the Caspian Sea to western China) is recognized as a species, it includes the Yarkand deer and <b>Bactrian</b> <b>deer</b> (the two may be synonymous), but it could possibly also include the Kashmir stag, which has not been sampled in recent studies. If it is included in the Central Asian Red Deer, the scientific name of that species is C. hanglu. If it is not included in the central Asian deer, the scientific name of that species is C. yarkandensis, and the Kashmir stag (C. hanglu) may represent a separate monotypic species.|$|E
50|$|By 1999 {{there were}} not more than 400 Bukhara deer. The {{population}} diminished most drastically in Tajikistan because of military conflicts. However, since then, environmental organizations have taken steps to save the species. Moreover, World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) implemented a reintroduction programme to bring Bukhara deer back to the places which it had once inhabited. For example, <b>Bactrian</b> <b>deer</b> have been reintroduced in Zarafshan reserve in Uzbekistan. As a result, in 2006 there were about 1,000 deer in Central Asia. The largest wild populations were found in 2009 in Karatchingil Nature Reserve (320-350 animals) {{in the neighborhood of}} Altyn-Emel National Park in Kazakhstan, in Badai Tugai Nature Reserve (374 animals) in Uzbekistan, and in Tigrovaya Balka Nature Reserve (>150 animals) in Tadjikistan. The total wild population is 1430 and increasing.|$|E
50|$|Its former {{distribution}} can be approximated {{by examining}} the distribution of ungulates in the region. Wild pigs were the numerically dominant ungulates occurring in forested habitats, along watercourses, in reed beds and in thickets of the Caspian and Aral Seas. Where watercourses penetrated deep into desert areas, suitable wild pig and tiger habitat was often linear, only a few kilometers wide at most. Red and roe deer occurred in forests around the Black Sea to the western side and around the southern side of the Caspian Sea in a narrow belt of forest cover. Roe deer occurred in forested areas south of Lake Balkash. <b>Bactrian</b> <b>deer</b> occurred in the narrow belt of forest habitat on the southern border of the Aral Sea, and southward along the Syr-Darya and Amu-Darya rivers.|$|E
50|$|No {{information}} is available for home ranges of Caspian tigers. In search for prey, they possibly prowled widely and followed migratory ungulates from one pasture to another. Wild pigs and cervids probably formed their main prey base. In many regions of Central Asia, <b>Bactrian</b> <b>deer</b> and roe deer were important prey species, as well as Caucasian red deer, goitered gazelle in Iran; Eurasian golden jackals, jungle cats, locusts, and other small mammals in the lower Amu-Darya River area; saiga, wild horses, Persian onagers in Miankaleh peninsula; Turkmenian kulans, Mongolian wild asses, and mountain sheep in the Zhana-Darya and around the Aral Sea; Manchurian wapiti and moose {{in the area of}} Lake Baikal. They caught fish in flooded areas and irrigation channels. In winter, they frequently attacked dogs and livestock straying away from herds. They preferred drinking water from rivers, and drank from lakes in seasons when water was less brackish.|$|E
