This new economic class comprises 700 million people out of the country's total population of 1.2 billion. This class includes railway coolies, servants, rickshaw-pullers, labourers, fishermen, guards and other people who earn their living by doing minor chores.|$|E
5|$|Before {{broadcasting}} began, the BBC considered airing {{the show}} on a Saturday night timeslot as its research found that any potential viewers {{were less likely to}} watch television on Saturdays than most other nights of the week; the BBC hoped that Spooks would <b>boost</b> <b>its</b> timeslot. However, the series instead broadcast on Mondays. The series began broadcasting on 13 May 2002 on BBC One during the 9 to 10pm timeslot, and continued on every Monday night until 17 June 2002, {{with the exception of the}} fourth episode, which was viewed on Tuesday 4 June starting at 10pm, due to an overrun of the coverage of Elizabeth II's Golden Jubilee. The episodes were also repeated on the digital channel BBC Choice. In the US, the first series aired in mid-2003 on A. However, each episode had approximately ten minutes edited out to accommodate for advert breaks. The DVD release of the series in America contained the uncut episodes. The first series was later repeated on BBC America, alongside the second series starting in June 2007.|$|E

5|$|Rootes {{had always}} been insufficiently capitalised, and losses {{resulting}} from a damaging thirteen-week strike at one of its subsidiaries, British & Light Steel Pressings, coupled with the expense of launching the Hillman Imp, meant that by 1964 the company was in serious financial difficulties. At the same time, Chrysler was looking to <b>boost</b> <b>its</b> presence in Europe, and so a deal was struck in June 1964 in which Chrysler paid £12.3 million ($34.44 million) for a large stake in Rootes, although not a controlling one. As part of the agreement Chrysler committed not to acquire a majority of Rootes voting shares without {{the approval of the}} UK government, which was keen not to see any further American ownership of the UK motor industry. In 1967 Minister of Technology Anthony Wedgewood Benn approached BMH and Leyland to see if they would buy out Chrysler and Rootes and keep the company British, but neither had the resources to do so. Later that year Chrysler was allowed to acquire a controlling interest in Rootes for a further investment of £20 million.|$|E
