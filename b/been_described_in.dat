Negative reports on shunting in the 1980s led to a brief period (1988–1993) during which optic nerve fenestration (which had initially <b>been</b> <b>described</b> <b>in</b> an unrelated condition in 1871) was more popular. Since then, shunting is recommended predominantly, with occasional exceptions.|$|E
