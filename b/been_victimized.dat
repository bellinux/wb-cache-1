5|$|On September 22, 2011, Dugard {{filed suit}} in US District Court for the Northern District of California accusing the United States of failing to monitor Phillip {{when he was a}} federal parolee. Dugard alleged in her lawsuit against the federal {{government}} that parole officials should have returned Garrido to prison for any number of parole violations that preceded her abduction, including testing positive for drugs and alcohol. Her lawsuit was rejected by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit on March 15, 2016. The court ruled in a 2–1 decision that Dugard had not <b>been</b> <b>victimized</b> by Garrido {{at the time he was}} placed under federal parole supervision, and there was no way to anticipate she would become his victim. As a result, federal authorities in California had no duty to protect her or other members of the general public from him. In a dissenting opinion, Chief District Court Judge William Smith said the majority had improperly analyzed Dugard's case, and said there was good reason to hold the government liable.|$|E

40|$|Background: Our {{objectives}} for this exploratory study were (1) {{to assess the}} prevalence in a family practice of violent victimization {{of women and men}} by partners, friends, families, and strangers, and (2) to compare the physical symptoms, depression, alcohol use problems, and social support of women and men who were or <b>were</b> not <b>victimized</b> in the previous 12 months. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional, multicenter study of family practice patients (1999 – 2000). One-thousand twenty-four patients, including 679 women and 345 men from 18 to 64 years of age com-pleted a standard health history and a demographic questionnaire. The health history questionnaire included a question about violent victimization. Results: Violent victimization was reported by 9. 9 % of the women and 10. 9 % of the men. Patients who <b>were</b> <b>victimized</b> <b>were</b> grouped into those who <b>were</b> <b>victimized</b> by partners (4. 9 % of women and 3. 0 % of men); by friends, or family, or strangers (2. 3 % of women and 5. 0 % of men); or by more than one category of persons other than partners (2. 6 % of women and 3. 0 % of men). Almost one third of patients <b>victimized</b> by partners <b>were</b> also <b>victimized</b> by another person. Women who <b>were</b> <b>victimized</b> had more physical symptoms than women who <b>were</b> not <b>victimized.</b> Women who <b>were</b> <b>victimized</b> and men who <b>were</b> <b>victimized</b> by their partners had more depressive symptoms than other women and men...|$|R

500|$|Rihanna {{responded to}} the PTC's {{criticism}} on Twitter, and said that parents should not expect her to parent their children and that [...] "touchy subject matters" [...] should not be hidden from children otherwise they will not learn how to adapt in society, and that it empowers abusers even more because children are embarrassed to talk about rape. The singer continued to state that [...] "the industry isn't 'Parent's 'R Us and that singers [...] "have the freedom to create art". In an interview for BET, Rihanna further explain why rape {{was used as the}} vehicle to push the story forward in the video despite the lyrics not mentioning rape, saying [...] "Making that into a mini-movie or video, we needed to go back to why it happened. Obviously she's not a cold-blooded killer. It had to be something so offensive. And we decided to hone in on a very serious matter that people are afraid to address, especially if you've <b>been</b> <b>victimized</b> in this scenario." [...] Rihanna added that the character is remorseful for her actions.|$|E
500|$|Beginning in 2005, Thompson {{supported}} {{a campaign to}} discourage Take-Two’s subsidiary, Rockstar Games, from releasing a game called Bully, in which, according to Thompson, [...] "what you are in effect doing is rehearsing your physical revenge and violence against those whom you have <b>been</b> <b>victimized</b> by. And then you, like Klebold and Harris in Columbine, become the ultimate bully." [...] According to Thompson, the game [...] "shows you how to—by bullying—take over your school. You punch people; you hit them with sling shots; you dunk their heads in dirty toilets. There's white-on-black crime in the game. You bludgeon teachers and classmates with bats. It's absolutely nuts." [...] Thompson sued Wal-Mart, Best Buy, Target, Circuit City, GameStop, and Toys 'R' Us, seeking an order to bar the game’s release. He also participated in a protest at Rockstar's office that also included students from Peaceaholics, a Washington, D.C. mentoring organization. Thompson said he hoped that the pressure would get retailers to refuse to carry the game. In March 2006, a Florida school board he had lobbied passed a resolution criticizing the game, but only urged retailers not to sell the game to minors.|$|E

Klebold {{is known to have}} remarked to his father of his hatred of the jock culture at Columbine, adding that Harris in particular had <b>been</b> <b>victimized</b> by this social group. In this remark, Klebold had stated, [...] "They sure give Eric hell." [...] On another occasion just weeks before the massacre, both Harris and Klebold had been confronted by a group of youths at the school—all members of the football team—who had sprayed them with ketchup and mustard while referring to the pair as [...] "faggots" [...] and [...] "queers".|$|E
