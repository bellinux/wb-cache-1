25|$|Anyone {{who claims}} to speak God's words or teach in his name {{and is not a}} prophet the Bible terms a false prophet. One test given in the Old Testament in Deuteronomy {{contains}} a warning of those who prophecy events which do not come to pass and said they should be put to death. Elsewhere a false prophet may <b>be</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> is purposely trying to deceive, is delusional, under the influence of Satan or is speaking from his own spirit.|$|E
25|$|Resorts may ban persons {{convicted of}} sex, drug, or violent crimes. Policies vary, but might include doing a {{criminal}} record check or checking a sex offender registry. However, minor crimes related to naturism are usually excluded, even {{if the person is}} required by law to register. (Requirements vary substantially from one jurisdiction to the next.) An example would <b>be</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> thought they were in a secluded area while nude bathing with no lewd intent, but were charged with a crime anyhow.|$|E

50|$|The term —both as a noun and adjective— {{is usually}} {{applied to the}} field of politics, and is {{occasionally}} used in the context of science, invention or art. In politics, a revolutionary <b>is</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> supports abrupt, rapid, and drastic change, while a reformist <b>is</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> supports more gradual and incremental change. A conservative <b>is</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> generally opposes such changes.

25|$|Bercow's {{election}} as Speaker was controversial {{because he is}} believed to have had the support of very few MPs from his former party. Conservative MPs generally viewed Bercow with distrust because of his changing political views (having moved over the years from being very right-wing to become more socially liberal, leading to clashes with past party leaders), his acceptance of an advisory role from the Labour government (a party he had often been rumoured {{to be on the verge}} of joining), his general lack of good relations with fellow MPs from the Conservatives, and his vigorous campaigning for the Speaker's job. It has been speculated that he received the votes of as few as three of his fellow Conservative MPs. However, he received the votes of a large number of Labour MPs, many of whom were angered at the way they perceived Michael Martin to have been hounded out of the job and wanted his replacement to <b>be</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> was not a favourite of the Conservative Party.|$|E
25|$|The others leave but {{a moment}} later Poirot suffers a small {{collapse}} and has Margot fetch back Dr. Sheppard. Poirot recovers quickly and, asking the doctor his opinion of the night’s events, is accused of playing a comedy. Poirot disagrees and confirms that he knows who the murderer is and for them {{there can be no}} escape. He takes the doctor through his thinking: The mysterious telephone call can only be judged from its result, which is that Sir Roger’s death was discovered that night instead of the next day. That means that the murderer wanted to be on the spot when the discovery was made, perhaps to retrieve something. The second puzzling fact was the armchair pulled out from its normal place in the study and that can only have been to have hidden something from sight at the moment that the room was broken into. As the Dictaphone is missing, it can only be that item which was there and, by use of a time-lock, the voice heard behind the door was not that of the living Sir Roger but a previously-made recording – the man was already dead. The murderer can only <b>be</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> had a receptacle to carry away the machine and who had the study to himself for a moment after the discovery of the body – in other word’s, Dr. Sheppard himself.|$|E
500|$|Rockism is {{the belief}} in the superiority of {{particular}} values of rock music, which often results in discrimination and prejudice against other forms of popular music. A [...] "rockist" [...] may also <b>be</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> regards rock music as the normative state of popular music. Poptimism (or popism) {{is the belief}} that pop music is as worthy of professional critique and interest as rock music. It is conversely viewed as a variant of rockism sometimes motivated by commercial or social interests. In other words, a bias that privileges the most famous or best-selling pop, hip-hop, and R acts.|$|E

500|$|The Populist {{strategy}} for 1896 was to nominate the candidate most supportive of silver. Populist leaders correctly believed the Republicans unlikely to nominate a silver man. They hoped the Democrats either would not endorse silver in their platform {{or if they}} did, that the Democratic candidate would <b>be</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> could be painted as weak on silver. [...] Bryan's sterling record on the issue left the Populists with a stark choice: They could endorse Bryan, and risk losing their separate identity as a party, or nominate another candidate, thus dividing the pro-silver vote to McKinley's benefit. [...] According to Stanley Jones, [...] "the Democratic endorsement of silver and Bryan at Chicago precipitated the disintegration" [...] of the Populist Party; it was never again a force in national politics after 1896.|$|E
500|$|Prior to {{the start}} of the seventh season, the {{producers}} sought to re-introduce Dax but with a new host. They decided immediately that it had to be a female character, as otherwise Kira Nerys, played by Nana Visitor, would be the only female main character. There were some difficulties in finding an actress who met the requirements of the part; Ira Steven Behr said [...] "So we started the casting process, and all I saw was a lot of people who couldn't play the part. There was absolutely no one in the running." [...] The initial casting call required an actress with a [...] "spooky" [...] quality, but following the failure to find someone adequate, co-supervising producer René Echevarria suggested that the character instead should <b>be</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> was unprepared to be joined with Dax and only did so because of an unexpected occurrence.|$|E
500|$|Executive {{producer}} Ira Steven Behr {{had long}} sought {{to introduce a}} Rat Pack-style character to [...] since the , as he was a lifelong fan of 1960s-era Las Vegas and the music of that period. The initial idea was that the character would <b>be</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> could give out romantic advice, {{and that it would}} not appear in every episode but only as and when it was needed. In preparation, Behr and Robert Hewitt Wolfe wrote a scene in order to flesh out the character, while Behr immediately had a performer in mind to play the new character: Frank Sinatra, Jr., a known fan of Star Trek. Casting director Ron Surma got in touch with Sinatra, who thought {{that it would be a}} funny idea. However, in discussions with Behr, it became apparent that Sinatra wanted to play an alien and not the singer character they had in mind. Because of this setback, the idea was shelved for the time being.|$|E

500|$|Following her {{argument}} with George, Liz {{is asked to}} leave CSL, and a small party is held in the workspace. During the party, Chloe calls the helpline again, asking to speak to Andy. Andy tells Chloe that her hoax call caused an old woman's death, but Chloe says that this was Andy's fault. She repeats what Andy had said to the old woman about her cat. Andy stays late in his cubicle and goes to George's office, realising that [...] "Chloe" [...] must <b>be</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> works at CSL. He accuses Joanne, who has just arrived, {{but she says she}} came back for her bag. He plans to get evidence from the CCTV footage and contact the police.

500|$|On August 13, 2007, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice {{announced}} that Ripken {{had been named}} Special Sports Envoy for the US State Department {{and that he would}} be going to China in October: [...] "...we're just delighted that somebody of Cal Ripken's stature is going to <b>be</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> will go out and represent America so well and represent what we consider to be American values, but universal values; that hard work and diligence and the willingness to really put it all on the line every day is something that kids need to learn", said Rice. [...] "A Shortstop in China" [...] premiered on the Mid-Atlantic Sports Network on May 8, 2009, chronicling Ripken's trip to China to share the game of baseball with youth and coaches while nurturing American-Chinese diplomacy. The documentary included footage from the 11 clinics Cal and former Oriole B.J. Surhoff held from Beijing to Guangzhou. The documentary also showed Ripken accepting his appointment from Rice and featured a variety of interviews, from Ripken's wife Kelly to former Undersecretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs, Karen Hughes.|$|E
500|$|While On Her Majesty's Secret Service {{was within}} its {{post-production}} stages, Richard Maibaum wrote initial treatments and a script for Diamonds Are Forever as a revenge-themed sequel with Irma Bunt and Marc-Ange Draco returning, and Bond mourning his deceased wife Tracy while Louis Armstrong's [...] "We Have All the Time in the World" [...] {{played in the}} background. When George Lazenby departed from the role prior to the film's release, a complete rewrite was requested, in addition to Maibaum's script failing to impress Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman. Following this, an original plot had as a villain Auric Goldfinger's twin, seeking revenge {{for the death of}} his brother. The plot was later changed after Broccoli had a dream, where his close friend Howard Hughes was replaced by an imposter. So the character of Willard Whyte was created, and Tom Mankiewicz was chosen to rework the script. Mankiewicz says he was hired because Broccoli wanted an American writer to work on the script, since so much of it was set in Las Vegas [...] "and the Brits write really lousy American gangsters"— but it had to <b>be</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> also understood the British idiom, since it had British characters. David Picker from United Artists had seen the stage musical Georgy! written by Mankiewicz, and recommended him; he was hired on a two-week trial and kept on {{for the rest of the}} movie. Mankiewicz later estimated the novel provided around 45 minutes of the film's final running time.|$|E

500|$|The Green Goblin {{debuted in}} The Amazing Spider-Man #14. At this time his {{identity}} was unknown, but he proved popular and reappeared in later issues, which {{made a point}} of his secret identity. According to both Stan Lee and John Romita, Sr., who replaced Ditko as the title's artist, Lee always wanted the Green Goblin to be someone Peter Parker knew, while Ditko wanted his civilian identity to <b>be</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> hadn't yet been introduced. Lee elaborated: [...] "Steve wanted him to turn out to be just some character that we had never seen before. Because, he said, in real life, very often a villain turns out to be somebody that you never knew. And I felt that that would be wrong. I felt, in a sense, it would be like cheating the reader. ... if it's somebody you didn't know and had never seen, then {{what was the point of}} following all the clues? I think that frustrates the reader." [...] However, Lee prefaced this statement by admitting that, due to his self-professed poor memory, he may have been confusing the Green Goblin with a different character, and in an earlier essay he had said that he could not remember whether Norman Osborn being the Green Goblin was his idea or Ditko's. Ditko has maintained that it was his idea, even claiming that he had decided on it before the first Green Goblin story was finished, and that a character he drew in the background of a single panel of Amazing Spider-Man #23 was meant to be Norman Osborn (who is not introduced until issue #37).|$|E
500|$|Lost {{was planned}} to be a multi-cultural show with an {{international}} cast. The producers thought it was essential that an Australian was cast for the part of Claire, and the Oceanic 815 was leaving from Sydney. Emilie de Ravin was working in Edmonton, so was unable {{to go to the}} auditions, which were being held in Los Angeles. From a video she sent to the producers, they were able to tell that de Ravin had the youth and sweetness required for the role, but also looked as though she had some life experience. Sayid was not in the original draft of the pilot episode, but executive consultant Jeff Pinkner had worked with Naveen Andrews on a short-lived ABC series called The Beast, and was keen to have him on Lost. The producers were surprised that Andrews was interested in the role. When they cast him, all Andrews was told was that Sayid was from Iraq and had been in the army. Yunjin Kim originally auditioned for Kate. At her audition she told the producers that she spoke fluent Korean, having been raised in South Korea, where she had starred in several films. The producers were impressed with Kim's performance and wrote her the character of Sun, who was planned to <b>be</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> could not speak English, but after examining her relationship with her husband, the audience would learn that she does in fact speak it. Daniel Dae Kim was cast in the role of Jin, Sun's husband. Dae Kim described his audition as a [...] "really interesting experience". He found it especially hard as it was his first time acting in Korean, and he had not spoken in it regularly since being in high school, when he would talk to his parents.|$|E
500|$|Rose {{is used by}} Davies as an {{introduction}} to the shows mythos and fantasy elements. He later underlined similarities between Rose and Gwen Cooper—the leading lady he created for Torchwood— describing both as [...] "the ordinary person who stumbles into something extraordinary and finds herself their equal." [...] Like her successor Martha, Rose is from London; Brett Mills from the University of East Anglia makes the assumption that this is because characters from the capital of the country are [...] "relatable to all British people" [...] because they are seen as [...] "neutral". Rose is introduced alongside a supporting cast in the form of her boyfriend Mickey and mother Jackie which James Chapman cites as [...] "evidence of Davies' attempt to create a social context for the companion". Davies states that the inclusion of these two characters was part of his desire to [...] "make her real" [...] and to [...] "give her a life". He later stated that in giving Rose a mother, a boyfriend and a [...] "sad story with her father" [...] the character has [...] "her own mythology, to match the Doctor." [...] Lindy A. Orthia observes that Rose, like the other companions in Davies' era of Doctor Who, is [...] "drawn from a cosmopolitan vision" [...] in her case because of her class background. Orthia contends that whilst working-class companions had featured previously in the show [...] "none were unskilled workers nor chronically under- or unemployed like Rose, Jackie and Donna". Looking back at the two characters, Davies felt Jackie to <b>be</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> is [...] "holding Rose back" [...] right from the first episode due to her suggestions her daughter be content with menial employment. Piper states that this causes Rose to resent her mum somewhat, although she loves her.|$|E
