5|$|Although {{potentially}} fatal if eaten raw, Gyromitra esculenta {{is a popular}} delicacy in Scandinavia, Eastern Europe, and the upper Great Lakes region of North America. Although popular in some districts of the eastern Pyrenees, it is prohibited from sale {{to the public in}} Spain. It may be sold fresh in Finland, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> accompanied by warnings and instructions on correct preparation.|$|E
5|$|Such a {{supernova}} event may pose some threat {{to life on}} the Earth. It is thought that the primary star, IK Pegasi A, is unlikely to evolve into a red giant in the immediate future. As shown previously, the space velocity of this star relative to the Sun is 20.4km/s. This is equivalent to moving a distance of one light year every 14,700years. After 5million years, for example, this star will {{be separated from the}} Sun by more than 500light years. A TypeI{{a supernova}} within a thousand parsecs (3300light-years) is thought to be able to affect the Earth, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> closer than about 10 parsecs (around thirty light-years) to cause a major harm to the terrestrial biosphere.|$|E
5|$|The {{ratio of}} the flag is two units high by three units wide. For the {{manufacturing}} of flags, the Government of Singapore stated that the shade of red used on the flag is Pantone 032. According to guidelines published by the Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts (MICA), the flag may be reproduced in any size and displayed at all times, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> in its specified proportions and colours. MICA recommends the sizes 915 by 1,370mm (approx. 36 by 54in), 1,220 by 1,830mm (approx. 48 by 72in), and 1,830 by 2,740mm (approx. 72 by 108in). The material that is recommended for the national flag is bunting wool.|$|E

5|$|The {{text of the}} {{document}} is rather vague and noncommittal. The signatories were concerned with guarding the king's honour {{and the rights of}} the Crown (garder son honeur et les dreits de sa Corounne). There was also a promise to address and correct both the things that had been done against that honour and those rights, as well as the past and present oppression of the people (les choses que sont feites avant ces houres countre soen honour et le droit de sa Coronne, et les oppressiouns que ount estre feit et uncore se fount de jour en jour a soen people). Nothing is said about what specifically these things were, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> assumed that the target was Gaveston. Bek was given the authority to excommunicate whoever broke the terms of the agreement.|$|E

25|$|If {{the time}} runs out while a team is {{preparing}} for a free-stroke or penalty, the strike should still be made but it must go into the goal by one shot to count as a goal.

25|$|From {{an artistic}} standpoint, {{these stories are}} rather laboured productions, besides being ultra-romantic in tone; <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> remembered that they were written mainly with an {{educational}} goal, and, moreover, they deserve high praise for their style. Herculano had greater book-learning than Scott, but lacked descriptive talent and skill in dialogue. His touch is heavy, and these novels show no dramatic power, which accounts for his failure as a playwright, but their influence was as great as their followers were many.|$|E
25|$|In Turkish cuisine, wheat-based mixed dessert congee {{is called}} an ashure. It {{is a little}} similar with eight {{ingredient}} Chinese congee. It mostly uses seven, ten or twelve ingredients. The ingredients can vary spontaneously <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> vegan (no animal-based ingredients) like nuts, fruits, grains and sugar. Twelve ingredients represent Alevi behavings called as Twelver. Alevi communities cook it at the tenth day of Muharrem, {{which is the first}} month of the İslamic calendar. It is a common dessert in Turkey, Greece and Albania.|$|E
25|$|A player may {{run with}} the ball, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> bounced or touched {{on the ground at}} least once every 15metres. Opposition players may bump or tackle the player to obtain the ball and, when tackled, the player must dispose of the ball cleanly or risk being penalised for holding the ball. The ball carrier may only be tackled between the {{shoulders}} and knees. If the opposition player forcefully contacts a player in the back while performing a tackle, the opposition player will be penalised for a push in the back. If the opposition tackles the player with possession below the knees (a low tackle or a trip) or above the shoulders (a high tackle), the team with possession of the football gets a free kick.|$|E

25|$|In Bangladesh taro is a {{very popular}} {{vegetable}} known as kochu (কচু) or mukhi (মুখি). It is usually cooked with small prawns or the ilish fish into a curry, but some dishes are cooked with dried fish. Its green leaves, kochu pata (কচু পাতা), and stem, kochu (কচু), are also eaten as a favourite dish and usually ground to a paste or finely chopped to make shak – <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> boiled well beforehand. Taro stolons or stems, kochur loti (কচুর লতি), are also favoured by Bangladeshis and cooked with shrimps, dried fish or {{the head of the}} ilish fish. Taro is available, either fresh or frozen, in the UK and US in most Asian stores and supermarkets specialising in Bangladeshi or South Asian food. Also, another variety called maan kochu is consumed and is a rich source of vitamins and nutrients. Maan Kochu is pasted and fried to prepare a delicious food known as Kochu Bata.|$|E
25|$|In 1987 the United Nation's World Commission on Environment and Development (the Brundtland Commission), in {{its report}} Our Common Future {{suggested}} that development was acceptable, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> sustainable development that would {{meet the needs of}} the poor while not increasing environmental problems. Humanity’s demand on the planet has more than doubled over the past 45 years as a result of population growth and increasing individual consumption. In 1961 almost all countries in the world had more than enough capacity to meet their own demand; by 2005 the situation had changed radically with many countries able to meet their needs only by importing resources from other nations. A move toward sustainable living by increasing public awareness and adoption of recycling, and renewable energies emerged. The development of renewable sources of energy in the 1970s and '80s, primarily in wind turbines and photovoltaics and increased use of hydroelectricity, presented some of the first sustainable alternatives to fossil fuel and nuclear energy generation, the first large-scale solar and wind power plants appearing during the 1980s and '90s. Also at this time many local and state governments in developed countries began to implement small-scale sustainability policies.|$|E
25|$|Distinctive {{features}} include eyes {{that are very}} clear, of yellowish or amber hue, hindquarters as high or a trifle higher than the shoulders, and a double-coat that tends to wave on shoulders, neck, back, and loins. The waterproof coat feels slightly oily and {{is often associated with}} a slight musky odor. Three basic colors are generally seen in the breed: brown, which includes all shades from a light to a deep dark brown; sedge, which varies from a reddish yellow through a bright red to chestnut shades; and deadgrass in all its shades, varying from a faded tan to a dull straw color. The breed standard states that white may also appear <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> limited to the breast, belly, toes, or back of the feet. The head is round and broad with a medium stop and muzzle. The lips are thin, and the ears are small and of medium leather. The forelegs should be straight with good bone. The hindquarters are especially strong and the toes webbed since excellent swimming ability is important for the Chesapeake. This breed is also known for its large and powerful chest, used to break apart ice when diving into cold water while duck hunting.|$|E

500|$|Semen {{collection}} is naturally an integral component of this entire process.

Frozen semen will work <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> the highest quality of semen and the ewes must be inseminated twice in the same day. The marketing of ram semen is a major part of this industry. [...] Producers owning prize winning rams have found this to be a good avenue to leverage the accolades of their most famous animals.|$|E
