At that time Baba Hari Dass was already an accomplished yoga teacher and had a large following. On his guru's (Neem Karoli Baba) recommendation, Ram Dass received teachings of Ashtanga Yoga: [...] "Baba Hari Dass was my teacher. I was taught <b>by</b> <b>this</b> <b>man</b> with a chalkboard in the most terse way possible".|$|E
2500|$|Then to {{his glance}} {{appeared}} the accurst swordbelt surmounting Turnus' shoulder, shining with its familiar studs—the strap Young Pallas wore when Turnus wounded him {{and left him}} dead upon the field; now Turnus bore that enemy token on his shoulder—enemy still. For when the sight came home to him, Aeneas raged at the relic of his anguish worn <b>by</b> <b>this</b> <b>man</b> as trophy. Blazing up and terrible in his anger, he called out: [...] "You in your plunder, torn from one of mine, shall I be robbed of you? This wound will come from Pallas: Pallas makes this offering, and from your criminal blood exacts his due." [...] He sank his blade in fury in Turnus' chest...|$|E

2500|$|In 1867 Stalybridge was {{disturbed}} {{by the arrival of}} William Murphy. Records of this man indicate that his sole interest was to sow the seeds of dissent between Roman Catholics, who by this time had grown to significant proportions, and Protestants. He succeeded in this goal only too well for a full year. During 1868 {{there were a number of}} violent disturbances and rioting created <b>by</b> <b>this</b> <b>man</b> who described himself as a [...] "renegade Roman Catholic". In his lectures to the public [...] "pretending to expose the religious practices of the Roman Catholic Church", he became a master at whipping up a crowd into a frenzy. Newspaper reports of the time told of his common practice of waving a revolver in the air in [...] "a most threatening manner". On one occasion he incited a riot of such proportions that Fr. Daley, the parish priest of St. Peter's, took to the roof of the church to defend it. A man was shot. The parish priest was tried but eventually acquitted at the Quarter Sessions. Following this incident, the community began to settle down and Murphy chose to extend his political activities elsewhere.|$|E
2500|$|Towards {{the end of}} the series, her {{previously}} platonic {{friendship with}} partner Fox Mulder developed into a romantic relationship. When Mulder was injured in a boat crash, he awakened in a hospital and told Scully that he loved her. In the season six episode [...] "How the Ghosts Stole Christmas", a ghost that seems to know the inner workings of Scully's mind suggests that her source of intimacy for Mulder comes from her desire to always prove him wrong. By {{the end of the}} sixth season, Mulder and Scully were increasingly shown enjoying more light-hearted activities together, such as practicing baseball, using FBI funds for a [...] "night out" [...] during a movie premiere, and watching a movie at Mulder's apartment. In the season seven episode [...] "all things", Scully is shown getting dressed in Mulder's bathroom, while Mulder sleeps, apparently naked, in the bedroom. In [...] "Trust No 1" [...] a man reveals to Scully that he works for a [...] "new" [...] Syndicate like-organization, and his job requires him and a few other colleagues to spy on her around the clock. Due to this he knows intimate details of Scully's personal life, right down to her [...] "natural hair color" [...] (Titian, as later confirmed by Chris Carter). It is suggested <b>by</b> <b>this</b> <b>man</b> that Scully ultimately initiated a sexual relationship with Mulder, as he remarked that he was very surprised when she invited Mulder [...] "into her bed". The last scene of the series finale featured Mulder and Scully holding each other on a bed, facing an uncertain future together in love.|$|E
