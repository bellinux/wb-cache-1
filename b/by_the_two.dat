5|$|A Simple Plan was a co-production between Paramount and Mutual Film Company. The {{film was}} co-financed by Mutual and Newmarket Capital Group {{as part of}} a joint venture that was formed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> companies. Mutual's {{international}} partners—the United Kingdom's BBC, Germany's Tele-München, Japan's Toho-Towa/Marubeni and France’s UGC-PH—also co-financed the film in exchange for distribution rights in their respective territories and equity stakes on the film on a worldwide basis. Paramount acquired the North American distribution rights.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1899, the LCDR and the neighbouring South Eastern Railway (SER) combined their operations as the South Eastern and Chatham Railway (SECR), jointly owned <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> railways. The SECR ran the trains, but the lines and stations continued to be owned by the LCDR or SER.|$|E
5|$|Because {{feathers}} {{are often}} associated with birds, feathered dinosaurs are often touted as the missing link between birds and dinosaurs. However, the multiple skeletal features also shared <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> groups represent another important line of evidence for paleontologists. Areas of the skeleton with important similarities include the neck, pubis, wrist (semi-lunate carpal), arm and pectoral girdle, furcula (wishbone), and breast bone. Comparison of bird and dinosaur skeletons through cladistic analysis strengthens {{the case for the}} link.|$|E

United also has a burgeoning rivalry with the Philadelphia Union as the two teams represent two cities separated by only 120 miles. D.C. United is also unique among MLS teams for its rivalry with the Charleston Battery of the United Soccer Leagues, as they compete every time they face one another for the Coffee Pot Cup, a trophy established <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> sides' supporters.|$|E

5|$|Following {{his visit}} to China, Nixon met with Soviet leaders, {{including}} Brezhnev in Moscow.

These aimed to limit the development of costly anti-ballistic missiles and nuclear missiles.|$|E

This provoked war between Austria and Prussia, with Hesse siding with the Austrians, technically making Alice and her sister Victoria enemies.|$|E

5|$|Small {{amounts of}} oxidizers like sodium nitrate {{are added to}} enhance the reaction. The result is {{aluminium}} oxide and ferroniobium, an alloy of iron and niobium used in the steel production. Ferroniobium contains between 60 and 70% niobium. Without iron oxide, the aluminothermic process is used to produce niobium. Further purification is necessary to reach the grade for superconductive alloys. Electron beam melting under vacuum is the method used <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> major distributors of niobium.|$|E
