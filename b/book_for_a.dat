5|$|By May 1786, Raspe {{no longer}} had control over the book, which {{was taken over by}} a {{different}} publisher, G. Kearsley. Kearsley, intending the <b>book</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> higher-class audience than the original editions had been, commissioned extensive additions and revisions from other hands, including new stories, twelve new engravings, and much rewriting of Raspe's prose. This third edition was sold at two shillings, twice the price of the original, as Gulliver Revived, or the Singular Travels, Campaigns, Voyages, and Adventures of Baron Munikhouson, commonly pronounced Munchausen.|$|E

An {{advertisement}} costing £500 (2011:£) was placed in the Daily Express, announcing the opening of the camp and inviting the public to <b>book</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> week's holiday. The advertisement offered holidays with three meals a day and free entertainment with a week's full board, at a cost of between 35shillings (£1.75) and £3 (2011:£), according to the time of year. The advert proved successful, and over the first summer season the capacity of the camp had to be increased from 500 to 2,000, to cope with the demand.|$|E

5|$|He {{opened his}} first Butlin's camp at Ingoldmells, near Skegness, on 11 April 1936 (Easter eve). It was officially opened by Amy Johnson, {{the first woman}} to fly solo from England to Australia. An {{advertisement}} costing £500 (2011:£) was placed in the Daily Express, announced the opening of the camp, inviting the public to <b>book</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> week's holiday. The advertisement offered holidays with three meals a day and free entertainment with a week's full board cost anything from 35 shillings to £3 (2011:£), according to the time of year. When the camp opened, Butlin realised that his guests were not engaging with activities in the way he had planned; most kept to themselves, and others looked bored. He asked Norman Bradford (who was engaged as an engineer constructing the camp) to take on the duty of entertaining the guests, which he did with a series of ice breakers and jokes. By {{the end of the night}} the camp was buzzing and the Butlin's atmosphere was born. From that point on, entertainment was the very heart of Butlins and Bradford became the first of the Butlin's Redcoats. The same night Butlin decided that for his camp to work he would require many more people to carry out the same job as Bradford, and the role of Redcoat was conceived.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the field}} seasons of 1924 and 1925, Wheeler ran {{excavations}} of the Roman fort of Y Gaer near Brecon, a project aided {{by his wife}} and two archaeological students, Nowell Myres and Christopher Hawkes. During this project, he was visited by the prominent Egyptologist Sir Flinders Petrie and his wife Hilda Petrie; Wheeler greatly admired Petrie's emphasis on strong archaeological methodologies. Wheeler published the results of his excavation in The Roman Fort Near Brecon. He then began excavations at Isca Augusta, a Roman site in Caerleon, where he focused on revealing the Roman amphitheatre. Intent on attracting press attention to both raise public awareness of archaeology and attract new sources of funding, he contacted the press and organised a sponsorship of the excavation by the middle-market newspaper the Daily Mail. In doing so, he emphasised the folkloric and legendary associations that the site had with King Arthur. In 1925, Oxford University Press published Wheeler's first <b>book</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> general audience, Prehistoric and Roman Wales; he later expressed the opinion {{that it was not a}} good book.|$|E

25|$|There {{have been}} several {{attempts}} to create film adaptations of Ponniyin Selvan, beginning with an attempt in 1958 by M. G. Ramachandran.

25|$|In a June 2016 interview, Kiedis {{stated that}} he at first regretted writing Scar Tissue saying “I did regret the <b>book</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> while as there was some pain caused then, I started seeing the long term {{positive}} reverberating. People were reading it in hospitals, in prisons and schools and it was having a positive effect. I realised that {{the whole point of}} writing that book wasn’t for me, but to show that somebody can go all the way down and come all the way back and have a productive, successful happy interesting life. And so whatever shame, pain or difficulty or discomfort I went through, then it was worth it because I get so many people coming up to me saying their kids had read it and got their act together because of it.” Kiedis has stated that due to the subject matter in his book, especially his reflections on his sexual relationships, that he hopes that his family hasn't read his book. “I have asked everyone in my family not to read the book.” Kiedis said.|$|E

500|$|Four {{passages}} {{are marked}} in the margin, which correspond {{to those used}} as readings in Masses for the Dead in the Roman lectionary of the mid-7th century. [...] This {{seems to have been}} done hastily, as most left offset marks on the opposite pages from the book being closed before the ink was dry.

500|$|The {{origins of}} the film lie in the book The Iron Man (1968), by poet Ted Hughes, who wrote the novel for his children. In the 1980s, rock {{musician}} Pete Townshend chose to adapt the <b>book</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> concept album; it was released as [...] in 1989. In 1991, Richard Bazley, who later became the film's lead animator, pitched a version of The Iron Man to Don Bluth while working at his studio in Ireland. He created a story outline and character designs but Bluth passed on the project. After a stage musical was mounted in London, Des McAnuff, who had adapted Tommy with Townshend for the stage, believed that The Iron Man could translate to the screen, and the project was ultimately acquired by Warner Bros. Entertainment.|$|E

500|$|In 1988, Alex Shoumatoff, {{writing in}} The New Yorker, makes Bates's Naturalist his choice {{if he were}} allowed only one <b>book</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{tropical}} journey. In his view, it is [...] "the basic text" [...] and a monument of scientific travel writing. Shoumatoff had in fact spent eight months in Bates's [...] "glorious forest" [...] (he quotes) with a copy in his backpack; he thus admires Bates's acceptance of the inevitable discomfort and homesickness from personal knowledge, noting that Bates only complained when all the following had occurred together: he had been robbed, he had gone barefoot having worn out his shoes, he had received no parcels from England, {{and worst of all}} he had nothing left to read. But otherwise Bates was [...] "lost in wonder" [...] at the astonishing diversity of the natural history of the Amazons. He was, writes Shoumatoff, one of the four largely self-educated geniuses who pioneered tropical biology, and who all knew each other: Darwin, Wallace, Bates, and the botanist Richard Spruce.|$|E
500|$|Benchley {{was also}} hired {{to help with}} the <b>book</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> Broadway musical, Smarty, {{starring}} Fred Astaire. This experience was not as positive, and most of Benchley's contributions were excised and the final product, Funny Face, did not have Benchley's name attached. Worn down, Benchley moved to his next commitment, an attempt at a talkie version of [...] "The Treasurer's Report". The filming went by quickly, and though he was convinced he was not good, The Treasurer's Report was a financial and critical success upon its release in 1928. Benchley participated in two more films that year: a second talking film he wrote, The Sex Life of the Polyp, and a third starring but not written by him, The Spellbinder, all made in the Fox Movietone sound-on-film system and released by Fox Films. The films enjoyed similar success and were critically acclaimed, and Benchley was signed to a deal to produce more films before heading back to New York to continue writing. As Life would say following his eventual resignation in 1929, [...] "Mr. Benchley has left Dramatic Criticism for the Talking Movies".|$|E
500|$|Initial {{recognition}} {{for the book}} was from children's-book critics, among whom it garnered acclaim. A Wizard of Earthsea received an even more positive response in the United Kingdom when it was released there in 1971, which, according to White, reflected the greater admiration of British critics for children's fantasy. In her 1975 annotated collection Fantasy for Children, British critic Naomi Lewis described it in the following terms: [...] " [...] the easiest book for casual browsing, but readers who take the step will find themselves {{in one of the}} most important works of fantasy of our time." [...] Similarly, literary scholar Margaret Esmonde wrote in 1981 that [...] "Le Guin has... enriched children's literature with what may be its finest high fantasy", while a review in The Guardian by author and journalist Amanda Craig said it was [...] "The most thrilling, wise and beautiful children's novel ever, [...] in prose as taut and clean as a ship's sail." [...] In discussing the <b>book</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> gathering of children's librarians Eleanor Cameron praised the world building in the story, saying [...] "it is as if [...] herself has lived on the archipelago." [...] Author David Mitchell called the titular character Ged a [...] "superb creation", and argued that he was a more relatable wizard than those featured in prominent works of fantasy at the time. According to him, characters such as Gandalf were [...] "variants on the archetype of Merlin, a Caucasian scholarly aristocrat amongst sorcerers" [...] with little room to grow, whereas Ged developed as a character through his story. Mitchell also praised the other characters in the story, who he said seemed to have a [...] "fully thought-out inner life" [...] despite being fleeting presences. The 1995 Encyclopedia of Science Fiction said that the Earthsea books had been considered the finest science fiction books for children in the post-World War II period.|$|E
