The coefficients of the polynomial are identified from several pairs of displacement amplitudes and the corresponding airspeeds, measured in a wind tunnel during dynamic tests on the sectional bridge model.

The aim is to understand the neural correlates of alpha rhythm slowing (decrease in mean frequency of oscillation), a hallmark in the EEG of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. The neural mass model used, referred to herein as the modARm, is a modified version of Lopes da Silva's Alpha Rhythm model (ARm). Previously, the power spectral <b>behaviour</b> <b>of</b> the modARm was analysed in context to AD. In this work, we revisit the modARm to make a combined study <b>of</b> the dynamical <b>behaviour</b> <b>of</b> the model and its power spectral behaviour within the alpha band while simulating the hallmark neuropathological condition of `synaptic depletion' in AD. The results show that the modARm exhibits two `operating modes' in the time-domain i. e. a point attractor and a limit cycle mode; the alpha rhythmic content in the model output is maximal at the vicinity of the point <b>of</b> <b>bifurcation.</b> Furthermore, the inhibitory synaptic connectivity from the cells of the Thalamic Reticular Nucleus to the Thalamo-Cortical Relay cells significantly influence bifurcation behaviour [...] - while a decrease in the inhibition can induce limit-cycle behaviour corresponding to abnormal brain states such as seizures, an increase in inhibition in awake state corresponding to a point attractor mode may result in the slowing of the alpha rhythms as observed in AD.

40|$|Flutter {{is usually}} {{predicted}} using linearised theory. In reality, flutter is always non-linear and might already occur below the linearly predicted flutter boundary. Whether {{this is the}} case for limit-cycle oscillations (LCOs) caused by aerodynamic non-linearities is not known, since these LCOs can only be predicted using expensive wind-tunnel tests or coupled Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) -Computational Structural Mechanics (CSM) simulations. However, {{it is important to know}} whether a sufficiently large disturbance can already cause LCOs below the flutter boundary predicted from linearised theory. Furthermore, since structural properties and the flow conditions will vary, it is necessary to study the resulting variations <b>of</b> the Hopf <b>bifurcation</b> <b>behaviour</b> <b>of</b> the LCO solutions near the flutter point. In this work viscous and inviscid transonic flows are considered. The LCO bifurcation behaviour was found to vary significantly when the uncoupled structural natural frequency ratio and the location of the elastic axis are changed. When the non-linearity is relatively weak, a change in the Hopf bifurcation type might result. A Mach number variation in inviscid flow showed that the effective flutter boundary might significantly deviate from that predicted using linearised theory. For both the structural parameter variations and the Mach number variation, LCOs were observed below the linearly predicted flutter boundary. At the nominal structural parameters, the amplitude-dependent <b>behaviour</b> <b>of</b> the phase of the lift was found to be responsible for the type <b>of</b> <b>bifurcation</b> <b>of</b> the LCO solution that occurs. Inspection of the local force distributions at various pitch amplitudes showed that the motion of the shock wave on the lower surface is responsible for the <b>behaviour</b> <b>of</b> the phase of the lift and hence for the <b>bifurcation</b> <b>behaviour</b> <b>of</b> the LCOs observed in this work...|$|R

The saddle-centre equilibrium {{is generated by}} a pair of purely imaginary eigenvalues; the rest of the spectrum consists of eigenvalues with non-zero real part. Hence the two-dimensional centre manifold of the equilibrium is filled with a family of periodic orbits. In the thesis Lin's method was extended to the case of non-hyperbolic equilibria. Originally this method was developed for investigations <b>of</b> the <b>bifurcation</b> <b>behaviour</b> <b>of</b> orbits connecting hyperbolic equilibria. First, the thesis focusses on bifurcating one-homoclinic orbits to the centre manifold. Here one-homoclinic orbits to the equilibrium, one-homoclinic orbits to a periodic orbit of the centre manifold and heteroclinic orbits connecting different orbits of the centre manifold are distinguished. A second aspect of the thesis is the detection of bifurcating symmetric one-periodic orbits.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the stability and <b>bifurcation</b> <b>of</b> a rigid rotor support by journal and thrust active magnetic bearing (TAMB). The system is modelled as a five-axis controlled active magnetic bearing-rotor system (AMBRS), and the system equations are formulated by combining the equations of motion of the rotor and the equations of the decentralized proportional-integral-derivative controllers. For this AMBRS, the magnetic forces of the journal and TAMB are strongly non-linear with respect to control current and shaft displacement. This study focuses on the influence of non-linearities on the stability and <b>bifurcation</b> <b>of</b> T periodic motion of the AMBRS subjected to the influence of TAMB and mass eccentricity. In the stability analysis, only periodic motion is investigated. The periodic motions and their stability margin are obtained by shooting method and path-following technique. The local stability and <b>bifurcation</b> <b>behaviours</b> <b>of</b> periodic motions are obtained by the Floquet theory.

40|$|AbstractAn {{important}} {{topic in}} modern circuit design {{is the development}} of mixed analogue-digital circuits. Analogue circuits usually contain oscillating elments. Self-excited oscillating circuits transfer a constant input signal into an oscillating periodic output signal. The stability properties of this class of circuits are of special interest. A loss <b>of</b> stability means <b>bifurcation</b> and <b>bifurcation</b> is one <b>of</b> the main reasons for the birth <b>of</b> an irregular <b>behaviour</b> <b>of</b> a dynamic system. The implementation of a tool for stability analysis in a simulation package usually requires a charge-oriented approach for the investigation of local stability. For the investigation of industrially relevant circuits using a commercial simulator, it is necessary to adapt that approach to differential-algebraic equations (DAEs). For that purpose a generalized definition of the monodromy matrix is introduced in the case of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). We show that — using this generalized definition — some basic results of classical ODE stability analysis can be transfered to the index- 1 DAE case. The present approach uses for the computation of the monodromy matrix provisional results produced by harmonic balance, a nonlinear frequency analysis, that is used for the computation of stable and unstable periodic solutions. The Floquet multipliers help to characterize the stability and <b>bifurcation</b> <b>behaviour</b> <b>of</b> the periodic signals of an electronic circuit.

40|$|The <b>behaviour</b> <b>of</b> a surface-coated rectangular, non-linearly {{elastic block}} subject to (plane-strain) flexure is {{investigated}} in this thesis. We consider a rectangular block of incompressible, isotropic elastic material {{coated with a}} thin elastic film on part of its boundary. Initially, the bulk material undergoes a non-homogeneous deformation and the equilibrium of the coated body is examined {{on the basis of}} the elastic surface coating theory derived by Steigmann and Ogden (1997 a). Incremental displacements are then superimposed on the finitely deformed configuration in order to study possible <b>bifurcation</b> <b>of</b> the deformed block. Numerical bifurcation results pertaining to two particular strain-energy functions (for the bulk material) and a general energy function (for the coating material) are subsequently obtained. These results allow the influence of the surface coating on the <b>bifurcation</b> <b>behaviour</b> <b>of</b> the block to be determined and assessed with reference to corresponding results for an uncoated block. Next, use is made of the dynamic equivalent of the static surface coating theory, developed by Ogden and Steigmann (1999), to establish incremental equations of motion for the coated block. Corresponding incremental governing equations for an uncoated, pre-flexed block then emerge as a special case. The resulting frequency equations are solved numerically, again on specialization of the form of strain-energy function. The numerical vibration results then provide evidence of the effect of surface coating on the dynamic <b>behaviour</b> <b>of</b> the considered coated block relative to the uncoated case. Finally, we turn our attention to the (non-linear) shear responses of bonded elastic bodies. We examine the plane-strain problem of a rectangular compressible isotropic elastic block bonded to two rigid parallel plates. The deformation <b>behaviour</b> <b>of</b> the block is described by applying minimum energy and maximum complementary energy principles to obtain upper and lower bounds on the shear stress-strain relationship.
