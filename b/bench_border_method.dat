When some of the intermediate systems are nearly singular, it is possible, by the block <b>bordering</b> <b>method,</b> to add several new rows and columns simultaneously. However, in that case, the solutions of some of the intermediate systems are not computed. The reverse <b>bordering</b> <b>method</b> allows computation {{of the solution}}s of these systems afterwards.

40|$|International audienceAim To compare two {{different}} cell count strategies, <b>border</b> and center <b>methods</b> for endothelial assessment during corneal storage. Material and Methods Seven observers determined the endothelial cell density (ECD), {{coefficient of variation}} (CV) of cell area, and percentage hexagonality of 30 organ cultured corneas by the border (contour detection and manual retouch) and center method (indicating cell centers) using Sambacornea analyser. Interobserver variability for ECD and agreement between the two methods was determined. The accuracy of the center method was verified by counting on ten standard photolithographic mosaics (called keratotest) by <b>border</b> (reference <b>method)</b> and center methods, first as fast and next as precise as possible (fast and slow modes respectively) and the time noted. Data between <b>border</b> and center <b>methods</b> was compared using nonparametric paired tests. Results For stored corneas, interobserver variability was ± 9. 6 % (95 %CI [6. 5 - 12. 7]) for <b>border</b> <b>method</b> and ± 9. 3 % (95 %CI[6. 3 - 12. 3]) for center method. ECD [mean±SD (range), median] was [2948 ± 565 (1644 - 3878), 3081] and [2961 ± 568 (1736 - 3914), 3037] respectively and showed excellent correlation (Pearson coefficient r= 0. 998, p< 0. 001). The center method underestimated the CV by a mean 9. 5 % 95 %CI [8. 3 - 10. 7] and overestimated the hexagonality by a mean 2. 5 % (95 %CI [1. 4 - 3. 7]) (p< 0. 001 for both). Precision of indication of cell center influenced only the CV (mean for slow and fast modes being 3. 6 ± 0. 7 % and 7. 4 ± 1. 3 % respectively, p< 0. 001) but was more time consuming (p= 0. 005). Discussion The center method gives accurate and reproducible measurement of ECD and {{is comparable to the}} <b>border</b> <b>method</b> (reference). However, morphometric evaluation is not fully reliable. Conclusion Given that center method is easier to use in poor quality images, we recommend its use only for these cases...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{research}} shows initial colonization of potato fields by winged {{green peach aphid}} is concentrated at field edges. This suggests that insecticides applied only to field margins during initial colonization would largely eliminate a colonizing aphid population, conserve natural enemies in the field center, and reduce insecticide use. To better understand {{the costs and benefits}} of reducing organophosphate use, the six participating growers were interviewed to ascertain their reason for participating and their satisfaction with the <b>border</b> only treatment <b>method</b> as well as their estimated net economic benefits. Five of the farms ranked cost reduction as the most important reason for participating. The sixth farm ranked reducing virus spread as the most important reason with cost reduction as their second most important reason. The average cost savings over all 28 participating fields of using the border treatment is estimated to be $ 23. 85 per acre for the entire field-a 93 % savings. Almost all the farmers found the <b>border</b> treatment <b>method</b> to be successful at aphid control. None of the farmers observed any impact on the physical yield of seed potato. All the fields were certified during the summer except for one of Farmer F's fields that was lost because of off type. In conclusion, the <b>border</b> treatment <b>method</b> seems likely to be adopted by many farmers since the potential cost saving is large and farmers dislike Monitor. However, some farmers may resist the method due to scouting requirements and costs. Also, farmers with fields that do not meet the uniformity requirements of the border treatment will not be successful in their use of the <b>border</b> <b>method.</b> Crop Production/Industries,...|$|R

40|$|Background: Dermoscopy {{is one of}} {{the major}} imaging {{modalities}} used in the diagnosis of melanoma and other pigmented skin lesions. Due to the difficulty and subjectivity of human interpretation, dermoscopy image analysis has become an important research area. One of the most important steps in dermoscopy image analysis is the automated detection of lesion <b>borders.</b> Although numerous <b>methods</b> have been developed for the detection of lesion borders, very few studies were comprehensive in the evaluation of their results. Methods: In this paper, we evaluate five recent <b>border</b> detection <b>methods</b> on a set of 90 dermoscopy images using three sets of dermatologist-drawn borders as the ground-truth. In contrast to previous work, we utilize an objective measure, the Normalized Probabilistic Rand Index, which takes into account the variations in the ground-truth images. Conclusion: The results demonstrate that the differences between four of the evaluated <b>border</b> detection <b>methods</b> are in fact smaller than those predicted by the commonly used XOR measure. ...|$|R

40|$|Lanczos type {{algorithms}} {{for solving}} systems of linear equations have their foundations {{in the theory}} of formal orthogonal polynomials and the method of moments which leads to a determinantal formula for their iterates. The various Lanczos type algorithms mainly differ by the way of computing the coefficients entering into the recurrence formulae. If the denominator in the formula for one of these coefficients is zero, then a breakdown occurs in the algorithm, and it must be stopped. Such a breakdown is in fact due to the non-existence of some orthogonal polynomial. In this paper we show how to jump over such a singularity by computing the next existing orthogonal polynomial by the block <b>bordering</b> <b>method.</b> The resulting algorithm, called MRZ, is equivalent to the nongeneric BIODIR algorithm (which is a look-ahead Lanczos type algorithm), but our derivation is much simpler...|$|R

40|$|Efficient use {{of water}} in {{irrigated}} agriculture is as important in areas of plentiful water supply {{as it is in}} water-short areas. Much of the water delivered to the farm for irrigation is lost while applying it to the land because of the system management practices followed. Field-water application efficiency is the precentage of water delivered to a field that is stored in the soil within the root zone of the growing crop. Factors affecting field-water application efficiency in irrigation are climate, soil, crop, water supply, topography, method of irrigation, irrigation system design, and irrigation system operation. Water is applied to the land by four general methods: flooding, furrows, sprinkler, and subirrigation. Each of these methods has charactersitic water losses, but all losses can be classified under evaporation, deep percolation, or runoff. Water-application efficiency studies have been conducted at a number of locations in the United States.

As a result, the study of borders as a clear-cut dividing line remains irrelevant for the understanding of many bordering situations. Instead, borders become osmotic barriers in which elites gain the power to institutionalize discriminating practices of border crossing and limiting.
