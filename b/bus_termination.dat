40|$|Double {{data rate}} (DDR) <b>bus</b> <b>termination</b> power {{requirements}} bring new {{challenges to the}} power supply by requiring voltage tracking of a reference supply, requiring both sourcing and sinking current, and maintaining a high efficiency over a wide current range. This paper address these issues while presenting an example DDR design of 12 A of output current with voltage outputs between 0. 9 V and 1. 25 V. Issues and their solutions are provided for the power supply operating as a tradition buck power stage in the sourcing mode {{as well as for}} operating as a synchronous boost regulator in the sinking mode. Regulation and control loop characteristics of the examples are presented for both current sinking and sourcing modes of operation. Transient load response is also presented showing output voltage variation, as the current is transitioned from sourcing to sinking...|$|E

In the analysis, a typical setup for automotive applications is considered and common mode (CM) and differential mode (DM) noise voltages induced across the <b>bus</b> <b>terminations</b> are evaluated by combining EM simulation of the setup with mixed-mode scattering parameter representation of the simulation outputs, and suitable circuit models of the bus terminal networks. The proposed approach {{can be used to}} analyze setups with different terminal networks, and allows to quantify the severity of the BCI test by correlating CM-to-DM conversion to the degree of unbalance of the CAN-bus terminal networks...|$|R
50|$|Each {{parallel}} SCSI device (including the computer's host adapter) must be configured to have {{a unique}} SCSI ID on the bus. Another requirement is that any parallel SCSI bus must be terminated at both ends with the correct type of terminator. Both active and passive terminators are in common use, with the active type much preferred (and required on LVD busses and Ultra SCSI). Improper termination is a common problem with parallel SCSI installations. In early SCSI busses, one had to attach a physical terminator to each end, but several generations' SCSI devices often have terminators built in, and the user simply needs to enable termination for the devices {{at either end of}} the bus (typically by setting a DIP switch or moving a jumper). Some later SCSI host adapters allow the enabling or disabling of termination through BIOS setup. Advanced SCSI devices automatically detect whether they are last on the <b>bus</b> and switch <b>termination</b> on or off accordingly.|$|R
40|$|Voltage sags, swells and {{momentary}} {{power interruptions}} lasting a few cycles to several seconds are common disturbances on utility power distribution systems. These disturbances {{are a result}} of normal utility recloser switching activity due in part to distribution system short circuits from natural causes such as lightning, rodents, traffic accidents, and current overloads. Power disturbances pose serious problems for many customers with critical, voltage sensitive equipment. Faults can interrupt a manufacturing process, cause PLC`s to initialize their programmed logic and restart equipment out of sequence, create computer data errors, interrupt communications, lockup PC keyboards and cause equipment to malfunction. These momentary disturbances result in billions of dollars of lost productivity annually due to downtime, cleanup, lost production and the loss of customer confidence in the business. This report describes prototype development work for a factory assembled 2 MW/ 10 Second Battery Energy Storage System. The system design includes (1) a modular battery energy storage system comprised of several strings of batteries-each string provided with an integral Power Conversion System (PCS), (2) an Electronic Selector Device (ESD) comprised of a solid state static switch with sensing and power switching controls, and utility interconnection <b>termination</b> <b>bus</b> bars, and (3) a separate isolation transformer to step-up PCS output voltage to interface directly with the distribution transformer serving the industrial or commercial customer. The system monitors the utility distribution system voltage for voltage sags, swells, and interruptions, switches the customer`s critical loads from utility power to the energy stored in the systems batteries and provides up to 2 MVA until the disturbance clears or up to 10 seconds. Once the ESD sensing circuits have confirmed that the utility is again stable, it seamlessly returns the critical load to the utility. 22 figs., 1 tab...|$|R
40|$|The general {{physical}} layout is: (1) There are {{a total of}} 9 slots, designated 1 through 9, from left to right; (2) Each slot {{is associated with a}} 96 pin Class 2 DIN 41612 (VME type) connector; (3) All even numbered slots are right handed (Connectors {{to the right of the}} card)., as would be found on a normal VME J 1 backplane, these slots utilize standard DIN connectors; (4) All odd numbered slots are left handed. These slots utilize standard 96 pin Class 2 DIN 41612 connectors orientated with 180 degrees of rotation. Thus, the connector's Al position is associated with the lower right pad of the backplane for that particular connector. Likewise, the connector's C 32 position is associated with the upper left pad of the backplane for that particular connector; (5) 5 layers (comp, gnd, pwr, gnd, sold); (6). 125 -inch thick; and (7) Mechanical layout presented in drawing number 3823. 113 -MD- 330044. Electrical characteristics are: (1) The backplane is routed as though it were a standard 9 slot VME J 1 backplane, with 11 as the mater slot, as dermed in ANSI/IEEE 1014 - 1987 standard; (2) The presence of odd slots has no effect on backplane routing. At each and every slot, Al and the signal assigned Al by the VME standard is located in the upper left hand comer as viewed from the front of the backplane. Thus, the routing paths are the same as a standard VME J 1 backplane; (3) Line impedances, <b>terminations,</b> <b>bus</b> grant and interrupt acknowledge jumper pins shall be the same as a standard VME J 1 backplane, as dermed in the ANSI/IEEE 1014 - 1987 standard; and (4) The space between DIN connectors on the front of the backplane shall be kept clear.

40|$|Convergence of communication, {{computing}} {{and consumer}} applications within mobile systems pushes memory requirements {{in terms of}} size, bandwidth and power consumption. Integrating more off-chip memory using conventional wire-bonding suffers from the limited available inter-die bandwidth and large power consumption. The existing solution to resolve this memory bottleneck consists in {{increasing the amount of}} on-chip memory. However this solution is becoming prohibitively expensive as the chip cost roughly grows exponentially with its area. 3 D-integration technology potentially represents the solution to this tug of war between large storage-space and large access bandwidth. 3 D technology permits communication between dies by piling them up on top of each other. This potentially minimizes the distance between devices manufactured on separate dies and consequently the inter-die communication latency and energy consumption will reduce. Moreover, 3 D-integration allows distributing the die I/Os all over its surface rather than only on the edges, increasing the number of possible inter-die links and finally the overall inter-die bandwidth. Innovative 3 D-enabling technologies like Through Silicon VIAs (TSVs) are considered in this work. The main objective of this thesis is to assess and exploit the benefit 3 D-integration brings to the composition of the memory architecture of an IC-system. In particular, two are the explored directions: 1. We use information from technologies fairly developed or mature to propose the interface design of 3 D-stackable memory dies {{that can be used to}} compose the memory architecture of a 3 D-IC-system. To this purpose nearly all the memories of the system besides the small register files are considered distributed on a number of dedicated dies tightly interconnected to the logic die using 3 D-packaging techniques. Besides, the proposed design targets memory-intensive and power- and cost-sensitive systems for multimedia applications; 2. We establish a correlation between the data-to-memory mapping requirements for specific applications and the design of the die for low-latency local memories. This step is made necessary to bridge the gap between the novel memory architecture organization possibilities and the existing memory architecture design methodologies. The main contribution of this work is the design of a 3 D-stackable configurable memory die for replacing the low-latency on-chip SRAMs of a generic IC-design. The die consists of a number of individually accessible memory banks. The die interface can be configured by customizing the traces of a conventional routing layer to fit with specific application memory requirements. The routing layer considered in our work is a cheap Re-Distribution Layer (RDL) normally used for I/O re-routing purposes. Contextually, it is assessed the energy, power, performance and cost benefits achievable with different 3 D-stackable memory die solutions with respect to the on-chip SRAMs case. Additionally, it is presented a boundary-based methodology to aid IC-designers selecting the 3 D-stackable memory die design more suitable to their specific application memory-requirements. The methodology is based on two novel models capturing focused information regarding the application requirements and the hardware resources of the 3 D-stackable memory dies. Those models include information normally overlooked from other models i. e. data inter-dependencies and uses compact formats to simplify the methodology exploration. Finally, an accurate power analysis is conducted to assess the benefits of a wide I/O interface for external memories connected with 3 D-integration technology, considering the DRAM as the study-case vehicle. <w:latentstyles deflockedstate="false" defunhidewhenused="true"  <w:lsdexception="" locked="false" priority=" 0 " semihidden="false" convergence="" of="" communication,="" computing="" and="" consumer="" applications="" within="" mobile="" systems="" pushes="" memory="" requirements="" in="" terms="" size,="" bandwidth="" power="" consumption. ="" integrating="" more="" off-chip="" using="" conventional="" wire-bonding="" suffers="" from="" the="" limited="" available="" inter-die="" large="" existing="" solution="" to="" resolve="" this="" bottleneck="" consists="" increasing="" amount="" on-chip="" memory. ="" however="" is="" becoming="" prohibitively="" expensive="" as="" chip="" cost="" roughly="" grows="" exponentially="" with="" its="" area. convergence="" area. 3 d-integration="" technology="" potentially="" represents="" tug="" war="" between="" storage-space="" access="" bandwidth. ="" 3 d="" permits="" communication="" dies="" by="" piling="" them="" up="" on="" top="" each="" other. ="" minimizes="" distance="" devices="" manufactured="" separate="" consequently="" latency="" energy="" consumption="" will="" reduce. ="" moreover,="" 3 d-integration="" allows="" distributing="" die="" i="" os="" all="" over="" surface="" rather="" than="" only="" edges,="" number="" possible="" links="" finally="" overall="" innovative="" 3 d-enabling="" technologies="" like="" through="" silicon="" vias="" (tsvs) ="" are="" considered="" work. the="" main="" objective="" thesis="" assess="" exploit="" benefit="" brings="" composition="" architecture="" an="" ic-system. ="" particular,="" two="" explored="" directions:the="" directions: 1. ="" we="" use="" information="" fairly="" developed="" or="" mature="" propose="" interface="" design="" 3 d-stackable="" that="" can="" be="" used="" compose="" a="" 3 d-ic-system. ="" purpose="" nearly="" memories="" system="" besides="" small="" register="" files="" distributed="" dedicated="" tightly="" interconnected="" logic="" 3 d-packaging="" techniques. ="" besides,="" proposed="" targets="" memory-intensive="" power-="" cost-sensitive="" for="" multimedia="" applications; 1.
