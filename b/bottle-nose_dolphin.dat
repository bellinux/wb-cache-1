50|$|In the 20th century {{perceptions}} of cetaceans changed. They transformed from monsters into objects of wonder. As science revealed {{them to be}} intelligent and peaceful animals. Hunting was replaced by whale and dolphin tourism. This change is reflected in films and novels. For example, the protagonist of the series Flipper was a <b>bottle-nose</b> <b>dolphin.</b> The TV series SeaQuest DSV (1993-1996), the movies Free Willy, Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home and the book series The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams are examples.|$|E
5000|$|Joint {{brood care}} ('babysitting') - Communal care of broods {{is similar to}} {{cooperative}} breeding, but more commonly involves a number of reproductive pairs or mothers. Sometimes referred to as ‘babysitting’ or reciprocal cooperation, this system of parenting allows the genetic parents greater foraging freedom, {{and appears to be}} supported by the mutual benefits participating individuals acquire through reciprocal altruism. Reciprocal altruism involves individuals performing acts to increase the fitness of another individual, {{in the hope that the}} act will be reciprocated. It is not dependent on relatedness, and therefore, babysitting behaviour is often observed amongst non-kin. This form of alloparental care has been observed in reindeer and elk who display reciprocal allonursing and form ‘nursery’ herds, and vampire bats who display reciprocity in food sharing. Babysitting females are frequently observed in primate species, such as the ring-tailed lemur, vervet monkeys, rhesus macaques and langurs. The formation of nursery groups has also been reported in the Atlantic <b>bottle-nose</b> <b>dolphin</b> and sperm whales. There are some cases in which brood amalgamation between two species has been observed. In Lake Malawi, cichlid parents are seen to ‘farm out’ their brood into the brood a potential predator, the Bagrus meridionalis catfish, and remain to help defend against predators. Intriguingly, the catfish’s care of heterospecific young is mutualistic for all parties.|$|E

The Miami Seaquarium is {{primarily}} a tourist destination, famous for it’s opportunities to interact with <b>bottle-nose</b> <b>dolphins.</b> It also was the home of one of 1960 s television stars, Flipper, who was played by Bebe, one of the parks ‘”star” dolphins.

50|$|Kellogg {{received}} his undergraduate degree at Indiana University after serving {{for two years}} in World War I. He went on to receive his Master's and PhD. from Columbia University. He held academic positions at both Indiana and Florida State Universities where he would undertake two of the most pioneering studies. During his time at Indiana his research focused on conditioning in learning and comparative studies. His time at Florida State was dedicated to <b>bottle-nose</b> <b>dolphins</b> and sonar.|$|R
40|$|The dorsal muscle of five South Australian <b>bottle-nose</b> <b>dolphins</b> {{has been}} studied. The {{ultrastructure}} and cytochemistry of the red, white and intermediate fibres were essentially {{similar to those}} of other mammalian skeletal muscles. Two features of special interest were: (a) the large number of lipid droplets in the red muscle fibres, and (b) the presence of longitudinal tubes linking the transverse tubes of the T-system, both within a sarcomere, and also between adjacent sarcomeres, of the white muscle fibres. The muscle spindles and neuromuscular junctions in the dolphin appeared to be morphologically {{similar to those of}} other mammals...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Knowledge {{about the}} ecology of {{bottlenose}} dolphins in the Southwestern Atlantic Ocean is scarce. Increased by-catch rates {{over the last decade}} in coastal waters of southern Brazil have raised concerns about the decline in abundance of local dolphin communities. Lack of relevant data, including information on population structure and connectivity, have hampered an assessment of the conservation status of bottlenose dolphin communities in this region. Here we combined analyses of 16 microsatellite loci and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region sequences to investigate genetic diversity, structure and connectivity in 124 biopsy samples collected over six communities of photographically identified coastal <b>bottle-nose</b> <b>dolphins</b> in southern Brazil, Uruguay and central Argentina. Levels of nuclear genetic diversity wer...|$|R
40|$|Cetacean morbillivirus	 (CeMV) 	 has	 caused	 several {{epizootics}} {{in multiple}} species of cetaceans globally {{and is an}} emerging disease among cetaceans in Australia. We detected CeMV	 in	 2 	 stranded	 coastal	 Indo-Pacific	 <b>bottle-nose</b> <b>dolphins</b> (Tursiops aduncus) in Western Australia. Preliminary phylogenetic data suggest that this virus variant is divergent from known strains. Cetacean morbillivirus (CeMV; family Paramyxoviri-dae) has caused several epizootics globally during the past 25 years. Three strains of CeMV—porpoise, dolphin, and pilot whale morbillivirus—are classified as 1 species (1). CeMV is {{more closely related to}} ruminant morbillivi-ruses and human measles virus than to canine and phocine distemper viruses (1, 2). Recently, a morbillivirus with phylogenetic similar-ity to dolphin morbillivirus (DMV) caused the death o...|$|R
40|$|A systemic	{{morbillivirus}}	infection	was	diagnosed	post-mortem in	 a	 juvenile	 bottlenose	 dolphin	 stranded	 in	 {{the eastern}} North	Atlantic	Ocean	 in	 2005. Sequence	analysis of a	 conserved	 fragment	 of	 the	morbillivirus	 phosphopro-tein gene	 indicated	that	 the	virus	 is	closely	related	 to	dol-phin morbillivirus	recently	reported	in	striped	dolphins	in	the Mediterranean Sea. Since the first morbillivirus outbreak affecting <b>bottle-nose</b> <b>dolphins</b> (Tursiops truncatus) along the mid-At-lantic Coast of the United States {{during the late}} 1980 s (1), some mass die-off episodes affecting the global cetacean population have occurred (2 – 5). Three cetacean morbillivi-ruses have been identified: porpoise morbillivirus, isolated from harbor porpoises that died {{along the coast of}} Ireland (6); dolphin morbillivirus (DMV), first identified in striped dolphins from the Mediterranean Sea (2); and pilot whal...|$|R
40|$|Total Hg {{levels were}} {{determined}} in 17 harbour porpoises Phocoena phocoena {{collected in the}} North Sea and the Kattegat (muscle, liver and kidney), {{as well as in}} a sperm whale Physeter macrocephalus, a common dolphin Delphinus delphis and two <b>bottle-nose</b> <b>dolphins</b> Tursiops truncatus collected in Belgium. Juvenile porpoises (total body length less than 140 cm) were characterized by total Hg concentrations increasing with length (t. i. with age) with median values of 3. 1 μg g- 1 dw in muscle, 6. 2 in liver and 5. 7 in kidney, and liver to muscle resp. liver to kidney ratios varying between 1 and 2. In adults, liver concentrations were higher (up to 500 μg g- 1 dw) with liver to muscle and to kidney ratios up to 20. Median McHg concentrations in 5 of the porpoises were 4. 0 μg g- 1 dw in muscle and 6. 9 in liver. These values did not increase as strongly with length (t. i. with age, at least for juveniles) as total Hg did; as a consequence, the relative McHg levels decreased from 100 % in juveniles to 2 or 3 % in the liver of adults. Such results seem to reflect the existence of a slow mineralization phenomenon and storage of inorganic Hg, mainly in the liver. © 1991 Kluwer Academic Publishers.
