5|$|The {{testimony}} of Henry Davis and Oscar Davis's sons proved damning, and several witnesses also testified {{that they had}} heard Waller declare he would come home with his wheat or kill Oscar Davis. In {{an analysis of the}} transcript, Sherman proposes that the phrasing of these witnesses was so similar that they may have been coached by prosecutors, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> counsel did not pursue this possibility. On September 27, 1940, after less than an hour's deliberation, the jury found Waller guilty of first degree murder and sentenced him to death, a verdict praised by the Virginia press covering the trial. His execution was scheduled for December 27 of that year.|$|E
5|$|Conley was cross-examined by {{the defense}} for 16 hours over three days, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> failed to break his story. The defense then moved to have Conley's entire {{testimony}} concerning the alleged rendezvous stricken from the record. Judge Roan noted that an early objection might have been upheld, but since the jury could not forget what it had heard, he allowed the evidence to stand. The prosecution, to support Frank's alleged expectation of a visit from Phagan, produced Helen Ferguson, a factory worker who first informed Phagan's parents of her death. Ferguson testified that {{she had tried to}} get Phagan's pay on Friday from Frank, but was told that Phagan would have to come in person. Both the person behind the pay window and the woman behind Ferguson in the pay line disputed this version of events, testifying that in accordance with his normal practice, Frank did not disburse pay that day.|$|E
5|$|President Lincoln {{called a}} special session of Congress to convene July 4, 1861, and Kentucky held special {{elections}} in June to select congressmen for the special session. Crittenden had expressed his desire to retire from public service and initially refused pleas to become a candidate, but he finally consented to run in late May. He was elected over secessionist candidate William E. Simms; in all, nine of Kentucky's ten congressional districts selected Unionist candidates in the special election. Upon taking his seat, {{he was assigned to}} the Committee on Foreign Affairs. On July 10, 1861, he accompanied Simon B. Buckner on a visit to President Lincoln to secure a renewed commitment from Lincoln to respect Kentucky's neutrality; Lincoln agreed only to issue a declaration that he had no present designs on Kentucky but would not commit to restrict his future actions. In order to calm the fears of border state citizens concerned about the Union's objectives in the war, he introduced the Crittenden–Johnson Resolution, which blamed the secessionist states for the war and stated that the object of the war was not the subjugation of those states, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> of the Constitution and the preservation of the Union. When those ends were achieved, the resolution stated, the war should cease. Kentucky Representative Henry C. Burnett asked that the question be divided. Burnett was one of only two votes against the portion of the resolution blaming the Southern states for the war; the only dissent on the remaining portion came from Wisconsin's John F. Potter and Ohio's Albert G. Riddle. In the Senate, the resolution passed 30–5, with Kentucky senators Breckinridge and Powell voting in the minority. In December 1861 the House refused, by a vote of 76–65, to reaffirm the resolution.|$|E
50|$|The {{defensive}} {{struggle of}} the day kept the scores low and the game in doubt late, as Nebraska held only a 10-point lead to start <b>the</b> 4th quarter, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>defenses</b> held {{on both sides and}} the Cornhuskers got the win.|$|R
50|$|The primary {{target of}} the attack was Martinique. Hopson landed his troops near Fort Royal and fought a battle against the French, leaving 100 British dead or wounded. The terrain ahead was judged so difficult, that {{it was decided to}} re-embark the troops immediately. a second landing was {{considered}} at Saint-Pierre <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>defenses</b> were so formidable that Hopson decided to abandon the attack on Martinique and to proceed to Guadeloupe.|$|R
50|$|Syria's {{first line}} of defense had been shattered, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>defenses</b> beyond that {{remained}} largely intact. Mount Hermon and the Banias in the north, and the entire sector between Tawfiq and Customs House Road in the south remained in Syrian hands. In a meeting early on the night of June 9, Syrian leaders decided to reinforce those positions as quickly as possible, and to maintain a steady barrage on Israeli civilian settlements.|$|R

25|$|The USA took on France in the quarterfinals. The USA had {{a three-point}} lead with just over six minutes {{left in the}} game <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> held France {{scoreless}} for the final six minutes; the USA finished with a 56–45 win.|$|E
25|$|Michigan would {{score on}} its next two drives {{to go up}} 21–18, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> would get the ball back to Robinson, who would put {{together}} an 81-yard drive, including a 4th down and 7yard conversion, and score on a 3-yard keeper with :53 left to give the Lions a 25–21 lead.|$|E
50|$|<b>But</b> <b>the</b> Bulldog <b>defense,</b> {{coming into}} <b>the</b> game shorthanded with several {{starters}} {{out of the}} game, stormed right back to take command of the game.|$|R

25|$|Harriman's campaign, however, {{was tied}} to the {{asserted}} innocence of the McNamaras. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> was in trouble: the prosecution not only had evidence of the McNamaras' complicity, but had trapped Darrow in a clumsy attempt to bribe one of the jurors. On December 1, 1911, {{four days before the}} final election, the McNamaras entered a plea of guilty in return for prison terms. Harriman lost badly.|$|E
25|$|In early February 2012, Corriere della Sera {{reported}} that the Italian purchase would be cut back to 100 to 110 aircraft, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> ministry said {{at that time that}} no decision had been made. On 15 February Defence Minister Giampaolo Di Paola announced that Italy would cut its F-35 order by 41 aircraft from the initially announced 131 to 90 {{as a result of the}} country's sovereign debt crisis.|$|E
25|$|The {{other half}} of the troops of the Three Leagues {{attacked}} the fortifications frontally all the same. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> was strong; the Letzi was equipped with many cannons, and the mats were driven back several times and suffered heavy losses. The commanders cheered on their soldiers to keep attacking, and threatened to kill them as traitors should they retreat. Their commander Benedikt Fontana fell. A local flanking maneuver over the mountain slopes south of the barrier finally brought the mats the victory. Under simultaneous pressure from all sides, the defenders had to give way. The footsoldiers were overwhelmed and fled, and likewise did the knights, as Pirckheimer reports. They were chased through the Vinschgau and many drowned in the wild mountain rivers.|$|E

50|$|Jermaine Phillips {{sealed the}} game for Tampa Bay, intercepting Green with just under six minutes left. Kansas City had one final chance, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> Buccaneer <b>defense</b> forced a {{turnover}} on downs with only 1:15 to go.|$|R
25|$|The {{second half}} saw the game seesaw {{back and forth}} defensively until Kevin Riley was sacked, {{resulting}} in a fumble which the Utes recovered late in the third quarter. Cal was able to hold Utah to a field goal and responded on the next possession by driving downfield, allowing Vereen to score his second touchdown of the night on a 1-yard run. Utah put up the first points of the fourth quarter on a field goal, and Stevenson Sylvester intercepted Riley on a tipped pass {{that he was able}} to return for a 27-yard touchdown. Riley threw a second straight interception, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> was able to hold the Utes. The final score of the game came late in the quarter on a 24-yard touchdown reception by Jeremy Ross to make the score 37–27 Utah. Cal attempted a two-point conversion, which failed. An attempt at an onside kick was recovered by Utah, allowing Wynn to take three straight knees.|$|E
25|$|VanDerveer was {{the head}} coach of the team {{representing}} the USA at the World University Games held in Sheffield, England in July 1991. The USA team started out with a very strong offense, scoring over 100 points in each of the first four games. The fourth game was against the USSR, a team often challenging the USA for the top spot, but the USA won 106–80 this time. The team fell short of 100 points in the game against Canada, but still won by 18 points. In the quarterfinal game, the USA won easily against Romania 135–53, with Ruthie Bolton scoring 40 points. The game against China was more of a challenge. The USA team shot poorly, hitting only 36% of their shots, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> held China to 35% shooting, and won a three-point game, 79–76. The gold medal match was against Spain, but the USA had a 13-point lead at halftime and won 88–62. Bolton was the highest scorer for the USA team with 14 points per game, but Lisa Leslie and Carolyn Jones were close behind with 13 points per game.|$|E

5000|$|Finally, {{there came}} the {{showdown}} with Stanford; {{the game was}} expected to be a shootout between UCLA quarterback Dennis Dummit and Heisman winner Jim Plunkett. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>defenses</b> ruled as UCLA took a 7-6 lead into the 4th quarter. Stanford took a 9-7 lead on a field goal, but UCLA was driving to a potential game-winning field goal or touchdown themselves when they completed a pass inside the Stanford 10-yard-line, only to have the receiver get sandwiched by two defenders on the tackle and fumble. This game ultimately decided the Pac-8 championship and 1971 Rose Bowl representative.|$|R

500|$|A {{major source}} of {{criticism}} are legal {{cases in which the}} ACLU represents an individual or organization that promotes offensive or unpopular viewpoints, such as the Ku Klux Klan, Neo-Nazis, Nation of Islam, North American Man/Boy Love Association, or Westboro Baptist Church. The ACLU responded to these criticisms by stating [...] "It is easy to defend freedom of speech when the message is something many people find at least reasonable. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> of freedom of speech is most critical when the message is one most people find repulsive." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{decision}} to charge an error {{to the defense}} is the most well-known responsibility of the official scorer. Some situations automatically call for an error to be charged to the defense by rule, but most charged errors {{are the result of}} a play that requires a judgment call. Broadly speaking, an error is charged to the defense when an [...] "ordinary effort" [...] by the defense would have either recorded an out or prevented a runner from advancing, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> fails to do so. When an error is charged, the official scorer must charge the error to one of the fielders {{who were involved in the}} play. Errors are primarily discussed in rule 10.12.|$|E
500|$|USC {{dominated}} the game 49–31, {{in a game}} that was not as close as the final score indicated: the Trojans led 42–10 going into the fourthquarter; Nebraska scored twotouchdowns in the final fiveminutes during garbage time. [...] The Trojans dominated on the ground, as they out-gained Nebraska 313–31 in rushing yards and averaged 8.2yards per carry, the most ever against a Nebraska team. [...] Stafon Johnson led USC running backs with a career-best 144yards in 11carries with onetouchdown; other major contributors were C.J. Gable (69yards in fourcarries, including a 40-yard run), Washington (43yards in 12carries with twotouchdowns), and another versatile performance by fullback Stanley Havili (52rushing yards in tworushes with onetouchdown, and threepass receptions for 22yards with onetouchdown). [...] The Trojans passing game again did not find a rhythm, with several dropped passes, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> was able to frustrate the Husker offense for most of the game and cause twopivotal 3rdquarter interceptions.|$|E
50|$|On 16 January, French special forces, {{along with}} the Malian army, began {{fighting}} small and mobile groups of jihadists inside the city of Diabaly, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> French <b>defense</b> minister has denied the presence of French troops fighting in Diabaly.|$|R

500|$|Although often {{supported}} by South Korean politicians and newspaper editorials, the No Gun Ri survivors' repeated {{demands for a}} reopened U.S. investigation and compensation went unheeded. Meeting with South Korean officials in 2001, the survivors asked that their government seek action at the International Court of Justice at The Hague, and in U.N. human rights forums, but were rebuffed. In 2002, a spokesman for South Korea's then-governing party called for a new U.S. inquiry, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>Defense</b> Ministry later warned the National Assembly that a reopened probe might damage U.S.-South Korean relations. [...] The disclosure in 2006 that Pentagon investigators had omitted the Muccio letter from their final report, along with other incriminating documents and testimony, prompted more calls for action. Two leaders of the National Assembly appealed to the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee for a joint investigation, but no U.S. congressional body ever took up the No Gun Ri issue. In a 2015 book, David Straub, U.S. Embassy political chief during the No Gun Ri investigation, wrote that meeting the survivors' demands would have set an undesirable precedent for similar cases from 1950 Korea. After a delegation's visit to No Gun Ri, the annual General Assembly of the US Presbyterian Church adopted a resolution in June 2016 calling on church leadership to urge the U.S. president and Congress to issue an apology and appropriate compensation for the No Gun Ri killings.|$|E
