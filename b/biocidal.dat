5|$|The <b>biocidal</b> {{effects of}} some heavy metals {{have been known}} since antiquity. Platinum, osmium, copper, ruthenium, and other heavy metals, {{including}} arsenic, are used in anti-cancer treatments, or have shown potential. Antimony (anti-protozoal), bismuth (anti-ulcer), gold (anti-arthritic), and iron (anti-malarial) are also important in medicine. Copper, zinc, silver, gold, or mercury are used in antiseptic formulations; small amounts of some heavy metals are used to control algal growth in, for example, cooling towers. Depending on their intended use as fertilisers or biocides, agrochemicals may contain heavy metals such as chromium, cobalt, nickel, copper, zinc, arsenic, cadmium, mercury, or lead.|$|E
5|$|Imposex has {{recently}} been detected in Laevistrombus canarium. Imposex {{is the development of}} male sex organs in female animals exposed to man-made organic tin compounds, such as tributyltin (TBT). It has negative consequences for several species of sea snails, ranging from sterility in some individuals to the extinction of entire populations. Tin compounds are <b>biocidal</b> anti-fouling agents mixed into paints to prevent marine encrustations on boats and ships. High concentrations of these compounds are commonly present in seawater near shipyards and docking areas, exposing nearby marine life to harmful effects. In a 2011 paper, Cob and colleagues found that imposex rates are high in dog conch populations near Malaysian ports; however, the researchers could not detect any cases of sterility in affected females. The authors concluded that females of L.canarium often develop a penis when seawater contains organotin compounds, but the phenomenon does not cause sterility in this species. The ability of the dog conch to survive despite imposex makes this species a suitable local bioindicator for organotin pollution.|$|E

25|$|Triclosan was not {{approved}} by the European Commission as an active substance for use in <b>biocidal</b> products for product-type 1 in January 2016. In the United States, manufacturers of products containing triclosan must indicate its presence on the label. In Europe, triclosan is regulated as a cosmetic preservative and must be listed on the label. Usage of triclosan in cosmetic products was restricted by the EU commission in 2014.|$|E
25|$|Scientists do {{not know}} the minimum number of {{parameters}} for determination of habitability potential, but they are certain it is greater than {{one or two of the}} factors in the table below. Similarly, for each group of parameters, the habitability threshold for each is to be determined. Laboratory simulations show that whenever multiple lethal factors are combined, the survival rates plummet quickly. There are no full-Mars simulations published yet that include all of the <b>biocidal</b> factors combined.|$|E
25|$|Concern {{pertains}} to the potential for cross-resistance or co-resistance to other antimicrobials. Numerous studies have been performed {{and there have been}} results indicating that the use of <b>biocidal</b> agents, such as triclosan, can cause cross-resistance. Results from a study published in The American Journal of Infection Control showed that exposure to triclosan was associated with a high risk of developing resistance and cross-resistance in Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. This was not observed with exposure to chlorhexidine or a hydrogen peroxide-based agent (during the conditions in said study).|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} web {{articles}} claiming that formaldehyde has been banned from manufacture or import into the European Union (EU) under REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and restriction of Chemical substances) legislation. This {{appears to be}} misinformation, as official EU chemical databases contradict these claims as of February 19, 2010. This misconception has gained some ground. Formaldehyde is not listed in the Annex I of Regulation (EC) No 689/2008 (export and import of dangerous chemicals regulation), nor on a priority list for risk assessment. However, formaldehyde is banned from use in certain applications (preservatives for liquid-cooling and processing systems, slimicides, metalworking-fluid preservatives, and antifouling products) under the <b>Biocidal</b> Products Directive. In the EU, the maximum allowed concentration of formaldehyde in finished products is 0.2%, and any product that exceeds 0.05% has to include a warning that the product contains formaldehyde.|$|E
2500|$|Several European {{countries}} {{restrict the}} use of formaldehyde, including the import of formaldehyde-treated products and embalming. Starting September 2007, the European Union banned {{the use of}} formaldehyde due to its carcinogenic properties as a biocide (including embalming) under the <b>Biocidal</b> Products Directive (98/8/EC). Countries with a strong tradition of embalming corpses, such as Ireland and other colder-weather countries, have raised concerns. Despite reports to the contrary, no decision on the inclusion of formaldehyde on AnnexI of the <b>Biocidal</b> Products Directive for product-type22 (embalming and taxidermist fluids) had been made [...]|$|E
2500|$|Methylisothiazolinone {{and other}} isothiazolinone-derived {{biocides}} {{are used for}} controlling microbial growth in water-containing solutions. [...] Two {{of the most widely}} used isothiazolinone biocides are 5-chloro-2-methyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one (chloromethylisothiazolinone or CMIT) and 2-methyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one (methylisothiazolinone or MIT), which are the active ingredients in a 3:1 mixture (CMIT:MIT) sold commercially as Kathon. Kathon is supplied to manufacturers as a concentrated stock solution containing from 10-15% of CMIT/MIT. For applications the recommended use level is from 6 ppm to 75 ppm active isothiazolones. <b>Biocidal</b> applications range from industrial water storage tanks to cooling units, in processes as varied as mining, paper manufacturing, metalworking fluids and energy production.|$|E
50|$|When {{discussing}} biocides {{a distinction}} {{should be made}} between the <b>biocidal</b> active substance and the <b>biocidal</b> product. The <b>biocidal</b> active substances are mostly chemical compounds, but can also be microorganisms (e.g. bacteria). <b>Biocidal</b> products contain one or more <b>biocidal</b> active substances and may contain other non-active co-formulants that ensure the effectiveness {{as well as the}} desired pH, viscosity, colour, odour, etc. of the final product. <b>Biocidal</b> products are available on the market for use by professional and/or non-professional consumers.|$|E
50|$|A <b>biocidal</b> natural {{building}} material {{is a natural}} {{building material}} which has <b>biocidal</b> properties. The <b>biocidal</b> properties of <b>biocidal</b> natural building materials are inherent to the material, rather than being supplemented afterwards. This makes that the material is long lasting and inexpensive, as no additional processing needs to be done.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{most of the}} <b>biocidal</b> active {{substances}} have a relative high toxicity, there are also examples of {{active substances}} with low toxicity, such as , which exhibit their <b>biocidal</b> activity only under certain specific conditions such as in closed systems. In such cases, the <b>biocidal</b> product is {{the combination of the}} active substance and the device that ensures the intended <b>biocidal</b> activity, i.e. suffocation of rodents by [...] in a closed system trap. Another example of <b>biocidal</b> products available to consumers are products impregnated with biocides (also called treated articles), such as clothes and wristbands impregnated with insecticides, socks impregnated with antibacterial substances etc.|$|E
50|$|The Biocides Work Area {{provided}} {{scientific and}} technical support for the approval of active substances in <b>biocidal</b> products as laid down in Directive 98/8/EC (<b>Biocidal</b> Products Directive, BPD) concerning the placing of <b>biocidal</b> products on the market. Currently, these tasks are dealt with by the biocides group within the IHCP. From 2013, coinciding with the coming-into-force of a new <b>Biocidal</b> Products Regulation (BPR), the European Chemicals Agency ECHA will take over the biocides' program.|$|E
50|$|Humans may {{be exposed}} to <b>biocidal</b> {{products}} in different ways in both occupational and domestic settings. Many <b>biocidal</b> products are intended for industrial sectors or professional uses only, whereas other <b>biocidal</b> products are commonly available for private use by non-professional users. In addition, potential exposure of non-users of <b>biocidal</b> products (i.e. the general public) may occur indirectly via the environment, for example through drinking water, the food chain, {{as well as through}} atmospheric and residential exposure. Particular attention should be paid to the exposure of vulnerable sub-populations, such as the elderly, pregnant women, and children. Also pets and other domestic animals can be exposed indirectly following the application of <b>biocidal</b> products. Furthermore, exposure to biocides may vary in terms of route (inhalation, dermal contact, and ingestion) and pathway (food, drinking water, residential, occupational) of exposure, level, frequency and duration.|$|E
50|$|<b>Biocidal</b> {{products}} include, for example, insect repellents and disinfectants used in hospitals. The <b>Biocidal</b> Products Regulation (BPR) {{ensures that}} there is enough information about these products so that consumers can use them safely. ECHA is responsible for implementing the regulation.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Biocidal</b> Products Directive (BPD) {{also known}} as the Biocides Directive is European Union Directive, (98/8/EC), which {{concerns}} biocides. It is officially known as Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 1998 concerning the placing of <b>biocidal</b> products on the market.|$|E
50|$|<b>Biocidal</b> {{products}} and active substances fall into four categories and twenty-three product-types {{that are all}} regulated by the EU under the <b>Biocidal</b> Products Directive. The substances have to be authorized before being used or sold on the EU market. Also, all treated products shall only contain authorized active substances. To be authorized, manufacturers or importers need to submit technical documentation on the products. The European Commission created and regularly updates the <b>Biocidal</b> Products Directive to ensure {{a high level of}} protection of human and animal health, as well as environmental protection.|$|E
50|$|In {{light of}} {{potential}} adverse effects, {{and to ensure}} a harmonised risk assessment and management, the EU regulatory framework for biocides has been established {{with the objective of}} ensuring a high level of protection of human and animal health and the environment. To this aim, it is required that risk assessment of <b>biocidal</b> products is carried out before they can be placed on the market. A central element in the risk assessment of the <b>biocidal</b> products are the utilization instructions that defines the dosage, application method and amount of applications and thus the exposure of humans and the environment to the <b>biocidal</b> substance.|$|E

5000|$|The {{classification}} of biocides in the <b>Biocidal</b> Products Regulation (EU) 528/2012)(BPR) is {{broken down into}} 22 product types (i.e. application categories), with several comprising multiple subgroups: ...|$|E
5000|$|In Europe the <b>biocidal</b> {{products}} {{are divided into}} different product types (PT), based on their intended use. These product types, 22 in total under the BPR, are grouped into four main groups, namely disinfectants, preservatives, pest control, and other <b>biocidal</b> products. For example, the main group [...] "disinfectants" [...] contains products {{to be used for}} human hygiene (PT 1) and veterinary hygiene (PT 3), main group [...] "preservatives" [...] contains wood preservatives (PT 8), the main group [...] "for pest control" [...] contains rodenticides (PT 14) and repellents and attractants (PT 19), while the main group [...] "other <b>biocidal</b> products" [...] contains antifouling products (PT 21). It should noted that one active substance can be used in several product types, such as for example sulfuryl fluoride, which is approved for use as a wood preservative (PT 8) as well as an insecticide (PT 18).|$|E

50|$|The EU {{regulatory}} framework for biocides has for years been defined by the Directive 98/8/EC, {{also known as the}} <b>Biocidal</b> Products Directive (BPD). The BPD was revoked by the <b>Biocidal</b> Products Regulation 528/2012 (BPR), which entered into force on 17 July 2012 with the application date of September 1, 2013. Several Technical Notes for Guidance (TNsG) have been developed to facilitate the implementation of the BPR and to assure a common understanding of its obligations. According to the EU legislation, <b>biocidal</b> products need authorisation to be placed or to remain on the market. Competent Authorities of the EU member states are responsible for assessing and approving the active substances contained in the biocides. The BPR follows some of the principles set previously under the REACH Regulation (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restrictions of Chemicals) and the coordination of the risk assessment process for both REACH and BPR are mandated to the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), which assures the harmonization and integration of risk characterization methodologies between the two regulations.|$|E

50|$|One major {{disadvantage}} of antimicrobial polymers is that macromolecules are {{very large and}} thus may not act as fast as small molecule agents. <b>Biocidal</b> polymers that require contact times {{on the order of}} hours to provide substantial reductions in pathogens, really have no practical value. Seconds, or minutes at most, should be the contact time goal for a real application. Furthermore, if the structural modification to the polymer caused by <b>biocidal</b> functionalization adversely affects the intended use, the polymer will be of no practical value. For example, if a fiber that must be exposed to aqueous bleach to render it antimicrobial (an N-halamine polymer) is weakened by that exposure, or its dye is bleached, it will have limited use.|$|E
