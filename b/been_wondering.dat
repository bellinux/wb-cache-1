She described it as sad to shoot, as she and Morrison were so invested in the storyline, and explained: [...] "What I hope is conveyed is that you see the child inside Terri. You see the fear." [...] Gilsig commented that viewers had <b>been</b> <b>wondering</b> why Will was taking so long to discover Terri was not actually pregnant: [...] "I think people have been asking 'How slow is this guy?!'.

500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from television critics. IGN's Ramsey Isler rated [...] "A Short Story About Love" [...] with 8.5 out of 10, {{an indication of}} a [...] "great" [...] episode. While he criticized the episode's [...] "mystery-of-the-week" [...] for detracting from the episode's other storylines, Isler thought it improved when it began depicting Walter's investigation of September. Other stated highlights of the episode included Noble's performance and the reappearance of the beacon from an early first season episode, the latter of which he noted, [...] "Fans have <b>been</b> <b>wondering</b> for years what that damn thing was and how it played into the story." [...] Isler concluded by observing that the story became [...] "a little sappy" [...] but was useful in [...] "neatly" [...] resolving the [...] "is he or isn't he?' drama that marked this season {{and set up the}} show to move onto the bigger task of crafting what could be the end of everything Fringe." [...] Andrew Hanson of the Los Angeles Times was pleased that little was revealed of the villain's backstory, but believed the episode really improved once it focused on Peter exploring September's apartment. Like Isler, Hanson was happy to see the beacon again, explaining that he [...] "love any time Fringe reaches back to the crazy science of Season One." ...|$|E

2500|$|Riis had {{for some}} time <b>been</b> <b>wondering</b> how to show the squalor of which he wrote more vividly than his words could express. He tried sketching, but was incompetent at this. Camera lenses of the 1880s were slow as was the {{emulsion}} of photographic plates; photography thus {{did not seem to}} be of any use for reporting about conditions of life in dark interiors. In early 1887, however, Riis was startled to read that [...] "a way had been discovered to take pictures by flashlight. The darkest corner might be photographed that way." [...] The German innovation, by Adolf Miethe and Johannes Gaedicke, flash powder was a mixture of magnesium with potassium chlorate and some antimony sulfide for added stability; the powder was used in a pistol-like device that fired cartridges. [...] This was the introduction of flash photography.|$|E
