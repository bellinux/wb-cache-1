60|$|Now, it is {{necessary}} here very carefully to distinguish between that character of the work which depends on {{the imagination of the}} beholder, and that which results from the imagination of the artist, for a work is often called imaginative when it merely leaves room for the action of the imagination; whereas though nearly all imaginative works do this, yet it may be done also by works that have in them no imagination at all. A few shapeless scratches or accidental stains on a wall; or the forms of clouds, or any other complicated accidents, will set the imagination to work to coin something out of them, and all paintings in which there is much gloom or mystery, possess therein a certain sublimity owing to the play given to the beholder's imagination, without, necessarily, being in the slightest degree imaginative themselves. The vacancy of a truly imaginative work results not from absence of ideas, or incapability of grasping and detailing them, but from the painter having told the whole pith and power of his subject and disdaining to tell more, and the sign of this being the case is, that the imagination of the beholder is forced to act in a certain mode, and feels itself overpowered and borne away by that of the painter, and not able to defend itself, nor go which way it will, and the value of the work depends on the truth, authority, and inevitability of this suggestiveness, and on the absolute right choice of the critical moment. Now observe in this work of Turner's, that the whole value of it depends on the character of curve assumed by the serpent's body; for had it been a mere semicircle, or gone down in a series of smaller coils, it {{would have been in the}} first case, ridiculous, as false and unlike a serpent, and in the second, disgusting, nothing more than an exaggerated viper, but it is that coming straight at the right hand which suggests the drawing forth of an enormous weight, and gives the <b>bent</b> <b>part</b> its springing look, that frightens us. Again, remove the light trunk[60] on the left, and observe how useless all the gloom of the picture would have been, if this trunk had not given it depth and hollowness. Finally and chiefly, observe that the painter is not satisfied even with all the suggestiveness thus obtained, but to make sure of us, and force us, whether we will or no, to walk his way, and not ours, the trunks of the trees on the right are all cloven into yawning and writhing heads and bodies, and alive with dragon energy all about us, note especially the nearest with its gaping jaws and claw-like branch at the seeming shoulder; a kind of suggestion which in itself is not imaginative, but merely fanciful, (using the term fancy in that third sense not yet explained, corresponding to the third office of imagination;) but it is imaginative in its present use and application, for the painter addresses thereby that morbid and fearful condition of mind which he has endeavored to excite in the spectator, and which in reality would have seen in every trunk and bough, as it penetrated into the deeper thicket, the object of its terror.|$|E

40|$|Plastic {{deformation}} of materials {{is accompanied by}} elastic deformation. After the bending process, the elastic deformation disappears and the part is changing its dimensions comparing {{with those of the}} tool. The change of <b>bent</b> <b>part’s</b> dimensions due to the elastic properties of material is called elastic springback. It influences the precision of <b>bent</b> <b>parts,</b> especially the bending angle, and this is why its value should be known in order to take the necessary measures in order to reduce or even annihilate its effects. Its value can be determined with analytical relations, from various nomograms or with experimental relations. Because the analytical relations offer results far from reality, this paper proposes a multivariable relation of springback (dependent variable) as a function of several independent variables obtained on the basis of experimental results, in real working conditions and using the method of regression functions. This method is based on simultaneous variation of considered variables, using a limited number of values in the experimentation domain. A split experimental program was used.

40|$|Sheet metal {{products}} {{are widely used}} in various industries nowadays. Among those, <b>bent</b> <b>parts</b> are made by performing linear bends on the sheet metal blanks prepared according to the unfolding of the corresponding designs. Computer aided process planning (CAPP) for <b>bent</b> <b>parts</b> consists of closely related tasks. In this context, the aspects of tool selection and dimensional accuracy verification have been tackled in this study. Due to the industrial requirements for part complexity and tool variety, simple mapping compatible and collision-free tools to bend lines merely based on part descriptions is not plausible. Meanwhile, the interrelation between tool selection and bend sequencing makes automated tool selection a combinatorial problem. The current research {{has resulted in a}} proactive strategy to downscale the problem complexity. Tools are firstly preselected based on the collision prone details obtained from the analysis of part geometries, and secondly refined according to the collisions detected while planning for abend sequence. Moreover, a generic approach founded on a set of rules is proposed for individual tool selections by evaluating the encountered collision scenarios. Besides, three complementary strategies for optimising the tool collection selected for a part have been worked out by considering production planning requirements. Overall, a tool selection methodology has been developed {{as an integral part of}} CAPP to obtain a feasible and well-optimised tool set for part production. The methodology hasbeen partially implemented in an industrial software package that delivers feasible results within a limited time span. Once a process plan is confirmed with a collision free bend sequence and an appropriate tool assignment, its compatibility with the tolerance plan imposed on the part should be verified. In the last part of this study, together with the insight of the sources of errors, an analytical stochastic model has been established for an efficient estimation of the distributions of the resulting global dimensions once the bend sequence and the distributions of the elementary errors are known. Therefore, the error stack-up and the stochasticity of the process have been incorporated with economic time complexity. status: publishe...|$|R

The U-bending {{process is}} a common sheet-metal forming process widely {{employed}} to fabricate sheet parts like channels, beams, and frames of various sizes applied in almost all industrial fields. In recent years, the precision requirements are increased on the U-bent parts. To achieve these requirements, in this study, the effects of part geometry on the spring-back/spring-go feature including work piece length, U-channel width, punch and die radii, and work piece thickness, were investigated by using the finite element method (FEM) and laboratory experiments. The FEM simulation results clearly revealed the influence of part geometry on spring-back/spring-go feature via the changes of stress distribution analyses on the bending allowance zone, the bottom of <b>bent</b> <b>part,</b> and the U-leg of <b>bent</b> <b>part.</b> Specifically, the part geometry affected on the bending characteristic on the bending allowance zone, {{as well as it}} affected on the spring-back feature. In addition, the part geometry also affected on the formation of reversed bending characteristic on the bottom and U-leg of bent parts, as well as it affected on the spring-go feature. The bending angle could be achieved by compensating these bending and reversed bending characteristics. Therefore, to meet the required bending angle, the suitable design of part geometry was strongly considered to maintain the balancing of the bending and reversed bending characteristics. The laboratory experiments were carried out to validate the accuracy of the FEM simulation results. The FEM simulation results showed good agreement with the experimental results with reference to the bending angle and bending force...|$|E
