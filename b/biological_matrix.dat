50|$|Unless {{signatures}} of causality manipulations were detected, Dolans concealed themselves on remote uninhabited planets {{and stayed in}} stasis, resembling a deflated balloon hull. In its active state, a Dolan became a reddish or black and outwardly almost featureless sphere of about 100 meters diameter. Its body consisted mainly of matrix tissue built from structural cells that could adapt to almost any function (including absorption of nutrients) and could undergo multiple rounds of local cell division whenever this was called for; therefore, few dedicated organs were required. Within minutes, this tissue could undergo a solid-phase transformation to harden its structure to a polycristalline steel-like quality. Limited mobility on planetary surfaces could be achieved by growing tentacle-like legs. Completely engulfed by this pluripotent <b>biological</b> <b>matrix</b> were four decks and a central cylinder of 20 meters length.

40|$|Abstract. Understanding {{the ways}} in which {{diversity}} changes across spatial scales is important for the conservation of biodiversity. The objectives of the present study were (1) to characterise the diversity of aquatic macroinvertebrates in three Brazilian tropical reservoirs and (2) to determine how the organisms were distributed at different spatial scales, by using a diversity partitioning approach. We compared the diversity-partition results with the null hypothesis that the macroinvertebrate community was uniform across all spatial scales in the study. We expected that differences in environmental variability (sediment characteristics) among the reservoirs and limitations on the dispersal of organisms among reservoirs result in higher biological variability (b diversity). The results of the spatial partitioning analysis of species richness in the reservoirs showed that each Ekman–Birge dredge-sampling unit (a) represented 43. 7 % of the total variation. b 1 diversity (diversity among Ekman–Birge dredge-sampling units) represented 47. 2 % of the total variation. A partial Mantel test indicated a correlation between the particle-size matrix and the <b>biological</b> <b>matrix.</b> However, the <b>biological</b> <b>matrix</b> was not correlated with the geographical matrix.

40|$|Biological {{monitoring}} (BM) is {{a useful}} way of determining overall exposures to chemical substances; however, {{in the case of}} respirable crystalline silica (RCS), this has not been analytically feasible in conventional biological matrices. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the utility of exhaled breath condensate (EBC) as a potential <b>biological</b> <b>matrix</b> in which to determine exposure to RCS. A small pilot study was undertaken collecting EBC from six quarry workers and six occupationally unexposed persons; the samples were analysed using both single particle inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (spICP-MS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results showed that EBC obtained from the occupationally unexposed persons exhibited low background levels of dissolved silica whilst silica particles of various sizes were present in samples from quarry workers. This is the first study to report EBC as a potential <b>biological</b> <b>matrix</b> that allows differentiation of RCS concentrations between samples from workers and occupationally unexposed controls. The results shown here confirm the presence of RCS in EBC by both spICP-MS and TEM.

40|$|On-line coupled {{analytical}} {{techniques can}} be advantageous in the assay of smaller peptides in complex <b>biological</b> <b>matrices</b> such as plasma, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and tissues. The present study shows {{the feasibility of}} a recently developed system, consisting of a size-exclusion chromatographic (SEC) separation followed by a trapping procedure on an RP 18 microcolumn with subsequent elution of the trapped fraction and separation by capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) for the quantification of structural-related peptides in <b>biological</b> <b>matrices,</b> as demonstrated {{for a number of}} enkephalins in CSF. After SEC separation of the enkephalins from large proteins present in CSF a heart-cut of 200 μL, containing the enkephalin peak, is taken, concentrated on the RP 18 microcolumn and, after elution of the enkephalins with 80 % acetonitrile, a fraction of the eluate is electrokinetically injected into the CZE system, where stacking and separation is achieved. The degradation of the peptides, caused by endogenous peptidases in the matrix, is sufficiently inhibited with imipramine HCl. The assay has a satisfactory linearity and intraday (9. 70 - 16. 3 %) precision considering the complexity of this multidimensional separation system.
