5|$|Harding, as a {{politician}} respected by <b>both</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>and</b> Progressives, was asked to be temporary chairman of the 1916 Republican National Convention and to deliver the keynote address. He urged delegates to stand as a united party. The convention nominated Justice Charles Evans Hughes. Harding reached out to Roosevelt once the former president declined the 1916 Progressive nomination, a refusal that effectively scuttled that party. In the November 1916 presidential election, despite increasing Republican unity, Hughes was narrowly defeated by Wilson.|$|E
5|$|When the {{legislature}} convened on February 19, {{two sets of}} officers attempted to preside. Marshall and Goebel's lieutenant governor, J. C. W. Beckham, both claimed the right to preside over the state senate. Taylor sued to prevent Beckham from exercising any authority in the senate; Beckham counter-sued for possession of the capitol and executive building. The cases were consolidated, and <b>both</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>and</b> Democrats agreed to let the courts decide the election. On March 10, a circuit court found in favor of Beckham and the Democrats. By a 6–1 vote, the Kentucky Court of Appeals, the state's court of last resort at the time, upheld the circuit court's decision on April 6, legally unseating Taylor and Marshall. The case of Taylor v. Beckham was eventually appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States, but the court refused {{to intervene in the}} case because it found that there were no federal questions involved. The lone justice dissenting from that opinion was Kentuckian John Marshall Harlan.|$|E

25|$|Sinn Féin {{candidates}} won 73 seats out of 105, {{but four}} party candidates (Arthur Griffith, Éamon de Valera, Eoin MacNeill and Liam Mellows) were elected for two constituencies {{and so the}} total number of individual Sinn Féin MPs elected was 69. Despite the isolated allegations of intimidation and electoral fraud on the part of <b>both</b> <b>republicans</b> <b>and</b> unionists, the election was seen as a landslide victory for Sinn Féin.|$|E
25|$|The {{members of}} the first Klan in the South were {{exclusively}} Democrats. The second Klan expanded with new chapters in cities in the Midwest and West, and reached <b>both</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>and</b> Democrats, {{as well as men}} without a party affiliation. The KKK state organizations endorsed candidates from either party that supported its goals. The goal of prohibition in particular helped the Klan and some Republicans to make common cause in the Midwest.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{the poor}} state of Venezuela's economy that {{includes}} {{a high risk of}} default and a 2016 deal offering 49.9% of Citgo as collateral for a $1.5 billion loan to Russia, {{it is possible that the}} Bolivarian Government of Venezuela may give Citgo to Rosneft, Russia's government-run oil company. <b>Both</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>and</b> Democrats in the United States urged oversight on this deal, describing CITGO's sale to Russia as a risk to the national security of the United States.|$|E
25|$|The FBI Headquarters in Washington, DC {{is named}} the J. Edgar Hoover Building, after Hoover. Because of the {{controversial}} nature of Hoover's legacy, there have been periodic proposals to rename it by legislation proposed by <b>both</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>and</b> Democrats in the House and Senate. For example, in 2001 Senator Harry Reid sponsored an amendment to strip Hoover's name from the building. Reid said J. Edgar Hoover's name on the FBI building is a stain on the building. The Senate did not adopt the amendment.|$|E
25|$|On December 18, 2002, {{just over}} a month after being reelected, Davis {{announced}} that California would face a record budget deficit possibly as high as $35 billion, a forecast $13.7 billion higher than one a month earlier. The number was finally estimated to be $38.2 billion, more than all 49 other states' deficits combined. Already suffering from low approval ratings, Davis's numbers hit historic lows in April 2003 with 24% approval and 65% disapproval, according to a California Field Poll. Davis was almost universally disliked by <b>both</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>and</b> Democrats {{in the state and}} a recall push was high.|$|E

25|$|STV {{has some}} {{history in the}} United States. Many cities, {{including}} New York City, once used it {{to break up the}} Democratic Party monopolies on elective office. Cincinnati, Ohio, adopted STV in 1925 {{to get rid of a}} Republican Party monopoly, but the Republicans returned the city to FPTP in 1957. From 1870 to 1980, Illinois used a semi-proportional cumulative voting system to elect its House of Representatives. Each district across the state elected <b>both</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>and</b> Democrats year-after-year. Cambridge, Massachusetts, (STV) and Peoria, Illinois, (cumulative voting) continue to use PR. San Francisco had citywide elections in which people would cast votes for five or six candidates simultaneously, delivering some of the benefits of proportional representation.|$|E
25|$|The support {{given by}} Federal Reserve Board, under Ben Bernanke, and the US Treasury with Paulson at the helm, in the {{acquisition}} of Bear Stearns by J.P. Morgan and the $200bn facility made available to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac attracted {{a great deal of}} criticism in congress by <b>both</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>and</b> Democrats. Paulson and Geithner made every effort to enable Barclays to acquire Lehman Brothers, including convincing other large Wall Street firms to commit their own funds to support the deal. In light of the recent Bear Stearns criticism, Paulson was against committing public funds towards a bailout, for fear of being labelled 'Mr Bailout'. When British regulators indicated they would not approve the purchase, Lehman went into bankruptcy, and Paulson and Geithner worked to contain the systemic impact.|$|E
500|$|Shortly after this, the broad-based National H-Block/Armagh Committee was formed, on a {{platform}} of support for the [...] "Five Demands", with McAliskey as its main spokesperson.

500|$|As the {{campaign}} {{drew to a}} close, <b>both</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>and</b> Democrats warned {{of the possibility that}} electoral fraud and violence would be perpetrated by the other side. Louisville mayor Charles P. Weaver, a Goebel Democrat, added 500 men to the city's police force just before the election, leading to charges that voter intimidation would occur in that city. Bradley countered by ordering the state militia to be ready to quell any disturbances across the state. On election day, the headline of the Courier-Journal proclaimed [...] "Bayonet Rule".|$|E

500|$|For the 1997 American {{television}} showing, {{the film}} was broadcast virtually unedited. The telecast {{was the first to}} receive a TV-M (now TV-MA) rating under the TV Parental Guidelines that had been established earlier that year. Tom Coburn, then an Oklahoma congressman, said that in airing the film, NBC had brought television [...] "to an all-time low, with full-frontal nudity, violence and profanity", adding that it was an insult to [...] "decent-minded individuals everywhere". Under fire from <b>both</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>and</b> Democrats, Coburn apologized, saying, [...] "My intentions were good, but I've obviously made an error in judgment in how I've gone about saying what I wanted to say." [...] He clarified his opinion, stating that the film ought to have been aired later at night when there would not be [...] "large numbers of children watching without parental supervision".|$|E
500|$|Unlike Lincoln, {{who had a}} close {{rapport with}} Seward, Johnson kept his own counsel, and {{generally}} did {{not take advantage of}} Seward's political advice as Congress prepared to meet in December 1865. Johnson had issued proclamations allowing for the southern states to reform their state governments and hold elections; they mostly elected men who had served as prewar or wartime leaders. Seward advised Johnson to state, in his first annual message to Congress, that southern states meet three conditions for readmission to the Union: repeal of secession, repudiation of the war debt incurred by the rebel governments, and ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment. [...] Johnson, hoping to appeal to <b>both</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>and</b> Democrats, did not take the suggestion. Congress did not seat southerners, but appointed a joint committee of both houses to make recommendations on the issue. [...] Johnson opposed the committee; Seward was prepared to wait and see.|$|E
500|$|Some {{supporters}} {{and opponents of}} the NPVIC have based their position {{at least in part}} on a perceived partisan advantage of the compact. Former Delaware Governor Pierre S. du Pont IV, a Republican, has argued that the compact would be an [...] "urban power grab" [...] and benefit Democrats. However, Saul Anuzis of the Republican National Committee wrote that Republicans [...] "need" [...] the compact, citing what he believes to be the center-right nature of the American electorate. New Yorker essayist Hendrik Hertzberg maintains that the compact would benefit neither party, noting that historically <b>both</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>and</b> Democrats have been successful in winning the popular vote in presidential elections. In the last five presidential elections, simulations of close results with the electoral vote system have favored Democrats in three (2004, 2008, 2012) and favored Republicans in two (2000, 2016). In those same five presidential elections, Democrats won the popular vote in four of them.|$|E
