30|$|These {{results are}} {{coherent}} with {{the conclusions of}} Thébault et al. (2015 b) {{for the evaluation of}} candidate models for IGRF- 12. The authors underline that all submitted models are not different enough to be rejected with differences generally much less than 10 nT. Amongst them, parent or derived models are {{used in the present study}} (i.e. CM, COV-OBS, WMM); the other ones are identified as CHAOS 5 from DTU Space (Finlay et al. 2015) or as one-time initiatives for example from BGS (Hamilton et al. 2015), GFZ (Lesur et al. 2015) and IPGP/CEA/LPG Nantes (Fournier et al. 2015; Vigneron et al. 2015; Saturnino et al. 2015). Based on the works of Thébault et al. (2015 <b>b),</b> the <b>internal</b> <b>component</b> to SH degree 13 of all these models can be considered as equivalent.|$|R

40|$|The {{subgroup}} of larger myxoviruses, i. e., mumps, Newcastle disease (NDV), and parainfluenza viruses, when negatively stained, possess distinctive structural features (1, 2). Their virus particles are irregular in size, about 1000 to 3000 A in greatest diameter, and irregular in shape. These particles contain an <b>internal</b> <b>component</b> composed of ribonucleoprotein. The <b>internal</b> <b>component</b> (nucleocapsid) is an elongated structure with helical symmetry, 170 to 180 A in width, which is packed or tightly wound within an outer, lipid containing viral envelope. The latter, {{derived from the}} cytoplasmic membranes of host cells, has well defined projections on its surface, and shows hemagglutinating and neuranimidase activities. Electron microscopic studies of the intracellular development of myxoviruses has shed light on {{little more than the}} end stage of virus release. Completely assembled particles are observed leaving the cell in bud-like or villus-like projections of the cell membrane (3, 4). Assembly of the <b>internal</b> <b>component</b> and surface structure into complete virus particles has never been observed.

40|$|Device {{penetration}} into media such as {{metal and}} soil is {{an application of}} some engineering interest. Often, these devices contain <b>internal</b> <b>components</b> and it {{is of paramount importance}} that all significant components survive the severe environment that accompanies the penetration event. In addition, the system must be robust to perturbations in its operating environment, some of which exhibit behavior which can only be quantified to within some level of uncertainty. In the analysis discussed herein, methods to address the reliability of <b>internal</b> <b>components</b> for a specific application system are discussed. The shock response spectrum (SRS) is utilized in conjunction with the Advanced Mean Value (AMV) and Response Surface methods to make probabilistic statements regarding the predicted reliability of <b>internal</b> <b>components.</b> Monte Carlo simulation methods are also explored...|$|R
