Throughout McMaster's history, faculty, alumni, and former students have played prominent roles in many fields, accumulating {{a number of}} awards including Nobel prizes, Rhodes scholarships and the Lasker Award. Nobel Prize winners include faculty member Bertram Brockhouse, awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1994 {{for his work in}} neutron scattering; and alumnus Myron Scholes, awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1997 for his work with the <b>Black-Scholes</b> model.

25|$|Although options {{valuation}} {{has been}} studied {{at least since the}} nineteenth century, the contemporary approach is based on the <b>Black–Scholes</b> model which was first published in 1973.|$|E
25|$|This formalizes {{time value}} {{of money to}} future values of cash flows with varying {{discount}} rates, and {{is the basis of}} many formulas in financial mathematics, such as the <b>Black–Scholes</b> formula with varying interest rates.|$|E
25|$|This section {{outlines}} moneyness measures {{from simple}} but less useful to more complex but more useful. Simpler measures of moneyness can be computed immediately from observable market data without any theoretical assumptions, while more complex measures use the implied volatility, {{and thus the}} <b>Black–Scholes</b> model.|$|E
25|$|Following {{early work}} by Louis Bachelier and later work by Robert C. Merton, Fischer Black and Myron Scholes {{made a major}} {{breakthrough}} by deriving a differential equation that must be satisfied by the price of any derivative dependent on a non-dividend-paying stock. By employing the technique of constructing a risk neutral portfolio that replicates the returns of holding an option, Black and Scholes produced a closed-form solution for a European option's theoretical price. At the same time, the model generates hedge parameters necessary for effective risk management of option holdings. While the ideas behind the <b>Black–Scholes</b> model were ground-breaking and eventually led to Scholes and Merton receiving the Swedish Central Bank's associated Prize for Achievement in Economics (a.k.a., the Nobel Prize in Economics), {{the application of the}} model in actual options trading is clumsy because of the assumptions of continuous trading, constant volatility, and a constant interest rate. Nevertheless, the <b>Black–Scholes</b> model {{is still one of the}} most important methods and foundations for the existing financial market in which the result is within the reasonable range.|$|E
25|$|The heat {{equation}} is of fundamental importance in diverse scientific fields. In mathematics, {{it is the}} prototypical parabolic partial differential equation. In probability theory, the {{heat equation}} is connected with the study of Brownian motion via the Fokker–Planck equation. In financial mathematics {{it is used to}} solve the <b>Black–Scholes</b> partial differential equation. The diffusion equation, a more general version of the heat equation, arises in connection with the study of chemical diffusion and other related processes.|$|E
25|$|Closely {{following}} the derivation of Black and Scholes, John Cox, Stephen Ross and Mark Rubinstein developed {{the original version}} of the binomial options pricing model. It models {{the dynamics of the}} option's theoretical value for discrete time intervals over the option's life. The model starts with a binomial tree of discrete future possible underlying stock prices. By constructing a riskless portfolio of an option and stock (as in the <b>Black–Scholes</b> model) a simple formula can be used to find the option price at each node in the tree. This value can approximate the theoretical value produced by Black Scholes, to the desired degree of precision. However, the binomial model is considered more accurate than <b>Black–Scholes</b> because it is more flexible; e.g., discrete future dividend payments can be modeled correctly at the proper forward time steps, and American options can be modeled as well as European ones. Binomial models are widely used by professional option traders. The Trinomial tree is a similar model, allowing for an up, down or stable path; although considered more accurate, particularly when fewer time-steps are modelled, it is less commonly used as its implementation is more complex.|$|E
25|$|The heat {{equation}} governs heat diffusion, {{as well as}} other diffusive processes, such as particle diffusion or the propagation of action potential in nerve cells. Although they are not diffusive in nature, some quantum mechanics problems are also governed by a mathematical analog of the {{heat equation}} (see below). It also can be used to model some phenomena arising in finance, like the <b>Black–Scholes</b> or the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes. The equation, and various non-linear analogues, has also been used in image analysis.|$|E
25|$|In finance, in {{particular}} the <b>Black–Scholes</b> model, changes in the logarithm of exchange rates, price indices, and stock market indices are assumed normal (these variables behave like compound interest, not like simple interest, and so are multiplicative). Some mathematicians such as Benoit Mandelbrot have argued that log-Levy distributions, which possesses heavy tails {{would be a more}} appropriate model, {{in particular}} for the analysis for stock market crashes. The use of the assumption of normal distribution occurring in financial models has also been criticized by Nassim Nicholas Taleb in his works.|$|E
25|$|While moneyness is a {{function}} of both spot and strike, usually one of these is fixed, and the other varies. Given a specific option, the strike is fixed, and different spots yield the moneyness of that option at different market prices; this is useful in option pricing and understanding the <b>Black–Scholes</b> formula. Conversely, given market data at a given point in time, the spot is fixed at the current market price, while different options have different strikes, and hence different moneyness; this is useful in constructing an implied volatility surface, or more simply plotting a volatility smile.|$|E
25|$|The {{equations}} used {{to model}} the option are often expressed as partial differential equations (see for example <b>Black–Scholes</b> equation). Once expressed in this form, a finite difference model can be derived, and the valuation obtained. A number of implementations of finite difference methods exist for option valuation, including: explicit finite difference, implicit finite difference and the Crank-Nicholson method. A trinomial tree option pricing model can {{be shown to be}} a simplified application of the explicit finite difference method. Although the finite difference approach is mathematically sophisticated, it is particularly useful where changes are assumed over time in model inputs– for example dividend yield, risk free rate, or volatility, or some combination of these– that are not tractable in closed form.|$|E
25|$|These models {{rely on the}} {{assumption}} that asset price fluctuations are the result of a well-behaved random or stochastic process. This is why mainstream models (such as the famous <b>Black-Scholes</b> model) use normal probabilistic distributions to describe price movements. For all practical purposes, extreme variations can be ignored. Mandelbrot thought this was an awful way to look at financial markets. For him, the distribution of price movements is not normal and has the property of kurtosis, where fat tails abound. This is a more faithful representation of financial markets: the movements of the Dow index for the past hundred years reveals a troubling frequency of violent movements. Still, conventional models used {{by the time of the}} 2008 financial crisis ruled out these extreme variations and considered they can only happen every 10,000 years. An obvious conclusion from Mandelbrot’s work is that greater regulation in financial markets is indispensable. Other contributions of his work for the study of stock market behaviour are the creation of new approaches to evaluate risk and avoid unanticipated financial collapses.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the same}} time as Merton's work and with Merton's assistance, Fischer Black and Myron Scholes {{developed}} the <b>Black–Scholes</b> model, which was awarded the 1997 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences. [...] It provided a solution for a practical problem, that of finding a fair price for a European call option, i.e., the right to buy one share of a given stock at a specified price and time. [...] Such options are frequently purchased by investors as a risk-hedging device. In 1981, Harrison and Pliska used the general theory of continuous-time stochastic processes to put the <b>Black–Scholes</b> model on a solid theoretical basis, and showed how to price numerous other derivative securities.|$|E
2500|$|In many cases, {{options are}} traded on futures, {{sometimes}} called simply [...] "futures options". A put is {{the option to}} sell a futures contract, and a call is the option to buy a futures contract. For both, the option strike price is the specified futures price at which the future is traded if the option is exercised. Futures are often used since they are delta one instruments. Calls and options on futures may be priced similarly to those on traded assets by using {{an extension of the}} <b>Black-Scholes</b> formula, namely the <b>Black–Scholes</b> model for futures. For options on futures, where the premium is not due until unwound, the positions are commonly referred to as a fution, as they act like options, however, they settle like futures.|$|E

2500|$|In some cases, one {{can take}} the {{mathematical}} model and using analytical methods develop closed form solutions such as <b>Black–Scholes</b> and the Black model.

This can also be measured in standard deviations, measuring how far above or below the strike price the current price is, in terms of volatility; this quantity is given by d2. (Standard deviations refer to the price fluctuations of the underlying instrument, not of the option itself.) Another measure closely related to moneyness is the Delta of a call or put option. There are other proxies for moneyness, with convention depending on market.|$|E

2500|$|Intuitively speaking, moneyness {{and time}} to expiry form a {{two-dimensional}} coordinate system for valuing options (either in currency (dollar) value or in implied volatility), and changing from spot (or forward, or strike) to moneyness is a change of variables. Thus a moneyness function is a function M with input the spot price (or forward, or strike) and output a real number, which is called the moneyness. The condition of being a change of variables is that this function is monotone (either increasing for all inputs, or decreasing for all inputs), and the function can depend on the other parameters of the <b>Black–Scholes</b> model, notably time to expiry, interest rates, and implied volatility (concretely the ATM implied volatility), yielding a function: ...|$|E

2500|$|Financial {{economics}} is {{the branch of}} economics studying the interrelation of financial variables, such as prices, interest rates and shares, as opposed to goods and services. Financial economics concentrates on influences of real economic variables on financial ones, in contrast to pure finance. [...] It centres on managing risk {{in the context of}} the financial markets, and the resultant economic and financial models. [...] It essentially explores how rational investors would apply risk and return to the problem of an investment policy. [...] Here, the twin assumptions of rationality and market efficiency lead to modern portfolio theory (the CAPM), and to the <b>Black–Scholes</b> theory for option valuation; it further studies phenomena and models where these assumptions do not hold, or are extended. [...] "Financial economics", at least formally, also considers investment under [...] "certainty" [...] (Fisher separation theorem, [...] "theory of investment value", Modigliani–Miller theorem) and hence also contributes to corporate finance theory. Financial econometrics is the branch of financial economics that uses econometric techniques to parameterize the relationships suggested.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{fundamental}} laws {{of physics}} and chemistry can be formulated as differential equations. In biology and economics, differential equations are used to model the behavior of complex systems. The mathematical theory of differential equations first developed together with the sciences where the equations had originated and where the results found application. However, diverse problems, sometimes originating in quite distinct scientific fields, may give rise to identical differential equations. Whenever this happens, mathematical theory behind the equations {{can be viewed as}} a unifying principle behind diverse phenomena. As an example, consider propagation of light and sound in the atmosphere, and of waves on the surface of a pond. All of them may be described by the same second-order partial differential equation, the wave equation, which allows us to think of light and sound as forms of waves, much like familiar waves in the water. Conduction of heat, the theory of which was developed by Joseph Fourier, is governed by another second-order partial differential equation, the heat equation. It turns out that many diffusion processes, while seemingly different, are described by the same equation; [...] the <b>Black–Scholes</b> equation in finance is, for instance, related to the heat equation.|$|E

5000|$|There {{are also}} analogies between finance theory and {{diffusion}} theory. For instance, the <b>Black-Scholes</b> equation for option pricing is a diffusion-advection equation (see however [...] for {{a critique of}} the <b>Black-Scholes</b> methodology).

50|$|Similar {{assumptions}} underpin {{both the}} binomial {{model and the}} <b>Black-Scholes</b> model, and the binomial model thus provides a discrete time approximation to the continuous process underlying the <b>Black-Scholes</b> model. In fact, for European options without dividends, the binomial model value converges on the <b>Black-Scholes</b> formula value {{as the number of}} time steps increases. The binomial model assumes that movements in the price follow a binomial distribution; for many trials, this binomial distribution approaches the lognormal distribution assumed by <b>Black-Scholes.</b>|$|E
