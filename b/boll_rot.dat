40|$|ABSTRACT Cotton {{monoculture}} {{favors the}} development of diseases such as ramularia leaf spot, which causes early defoliation and <b>boll</b> <b>rotting,</b> thus decreasing yield. This study aimed at evaluating the severity of ramularia leaf spot {{and its effects on}} cotton leaf area and yield. The experiment was conducted in a triple (4 x 3 x 2) factorial design, consisting of four cultivars (FM 940 GLT, FM 944 GL, TMG 42 WS and TMG 43 WS), three thirds of the plant (lower, middle and upper) and two management conditions (with and without fungicide application). To the variable area under the disease progress curve, the lowest values were observed in the upper third of the TMG 42 WS and TMG 43 WS cultivars, with the lower and middle thirds presenting the highest severity. The condition managed with fungicide and the upper third showed the lowest values for area under the disease progress curve. The leaf area was negatively affected by the ramularia leaf spot. Concerning the seed and fiber yields, the highest averages were observed for the middle third and the condition managed with fungicide. There was no statistical difference for cotton yield loss...|$|R
50|$|Like other true bugs, Dysdercus cingulatus sucks fluids {{from its}} host plants. The {{only part of}} the cotton plant {{affected}} by this pest is the flower and the seed capsule or boll. As this develops, the insect thrusts its rostrum between the carpels and sucks fluids from the still soft seeds inside. Micro-organisms are admitted in the process and may make the <b>boll</b> contents <b>rot</b> or the lint become discoloured. Meanwhile, the seeds wither, the fibres may fail to expand and the boll may abort. When the seeds of a host plant ripen and it becomes unsuitable, the adult insects migrate to new host plants of the same or different species. While away from their hosts, they feed on nectar and fruit of non-host plants, and can survive for several days without food. They seem fond of citrus fruits, but this may merely be because there are often citrus plantations in close proximity to cotton fields.|$|R

50|$|The {{bacteria}} {{can affect the}} cotton plant during all growth stages, infecting stems, leaves, bracts and bolls. It causes seedling blight, leaf spot, blackarm (on stem and petioles) and <b>boll</b> <b>rot.</b> On cotyledons small, green, water-soaked rounded (or irregular) spots form which turn brown. Cotyledons can be distorted if the infection is intense. Black and elongated lesions can girdle the hypocotyls and kill seedlings. On the leaves, scattered small dark-green, water-soaked, areolate spots, form measuring 1-2 mm on the lower surface, which appear translucent against transmitted light. The spots increase in diameter to 5 mm, become angular (due to leaf veination), brown and later turn dark brown to blackish, becoming visible on the upper surface. On susceptible cultivars numerous spots can occur, causing chlorosis, necrosis and distortion, and eventually defoliation.|$|E
50|$|The admirable {{collaboration}} and cooperation provided by this Section to Plant Breeding & Genetics and Cytogenetics disciplines has overlaid {{in the development of}} virus resistance varieties. The survey during the crop season revealed that virus was prevalent across the belt. However under various agronomic practices and change in weather conditions CLCuD ranged from 0-100 percent. The incidence of stunting and <b>boll</b> <b>rot</b> was minimal. The material tested under VT, MVT. NCVT (Bt & Non-Bt), NBCT, PCCT (Bt & Non-Bt), and SVT were found susceptible, at various intensity levels, to CLCuD except one strains, which showed resistance. One thousand fifty US-germplasm tested under field condition, only 114 accessions show resistant against CLCuD. The cultivation of cotton of Bt-cotton in March and non-Bt in mid April escaped from virus to some extent while the crop planted beyond May fell prey to virus attack. The pattern of appearance of CLCuD and its progression during the crop season differed greatly with planting dates. The low incidence of the disease was due to planting of CIM-616 and Cyto-124. The fortnightly incidence of disease when compare with weather parameters i.e. average maximum temperature from 35.2 to 36.8 °C minimum temperature from 27.4 to 29.5 °C and relative humidity in the range of 71.2 to 81.4% at peak of CLCuD which helps for fortnightly increase of CLCuD, during mid-June to mid-August. Pantoa agglomeran reduces the seed quality and quantity in cotton rotted bolls. Streptomycin at different doses found effective to control this bacteria. Seed rottening decreased with increase of soil temperature and fungicide (Dynasty) gave minimum seed rottening in all sowing dates.|$|E
40|$|Cotton yields have {{suffered}} losses from cotton <b>boll</b> <b>rot</b> {{during the last}} 10 to 15 years in areas of South Texas. Piercing-sucking insects feeding on cotton bolls, particularly stink bugs, have been implicated in introducing the bacterial disease.

A replicated field survey was conducted in 2010 and 2011 to assess relative abundance of these boll-feeding species and subsequent boll injury caused by cotton <b>boll</b> <b>rot.</b> This survey was paired with a field cage experiment that isolated feeding by the verde plant bug, Creontiades signatus Distant (Hemiptera: Miridae).

40|$|Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) is {{the most}} {{important}} fiber-yielding crop grown in India and worldwide. In India, during 2012 - 2013, 1. 16 million ha were under cotton cultivation, with an average production of 480 kg/ha. As production of cotton has increased in areas, so has the occurrence of various pests and diseases. During a field survey conducted in the cotton-growing areas of Devalapura Village of the Mysore District during August and September 2013, a <b>boll</b> <b>rot</b> disease was observed with distinctive symptoms and signs of a fungal pathogen observed in 27 % of fields. Incidence of the <b>boll</b> <b>rot</b> within fields ranged from 8 to 12 %, while 3 to 5 % stem rot was observed on boll rot-affected plants in about 15 to 18 ha of total cotton fields surveyed. White mycelial strands with spherical, dark-brown sclerotial bodies were found on the surface of infected bolls near the ground and the affected bolls were completely decayed. The disease-affected bolls were disinfested with 2 % sodium hypochlorite solution for 3 min, and 5 -mm samples were placed on potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium and incubated at 28 ± 2 °C. The fungal colonies that grew from infected tissues were whitish with cottony aerial mycelium and abundant globoid sclerotia observed after 10 to 12 days of incubation. Sclerotial bodies were initially pale whitish, becoming dark brown over time. Based on morphological and cultural characteristics, the associated fungal pathogen was identified as Sclerotium rolfsii Sacc. The identity of the pathogen was further confirmed through PCR amplification of internally transcribed spacer (ITS) region using ITS 1 /ITS 4 universal primer. The amplified PCR product (550 to 570 bp) was sequenced and BLASTn search comparison revealed 100 % homology with Sclerotium rolfsii (Accession Nos. JF 966208 and JX 914480). A representative sequence of S. rolfsii was deposited in GenBank (KP 412471. 1 and KP 412472. 1). Further, pathogenicity tests were conducted on 30 healthy cotton bolls in vivo by inoculating the bolls with sclerotia obtained from 12 -day-old cultures; noninoculated bolls served as controls. Characteristic <b>boll</b> <b>rot</b> symptoms were observed on 60 % of total inoculated cotton bolls 7 days after inoculation and S. rolfsii was reisolated from the infected bolls and the identity of the pathogen was confirmed. S. rolfsii is a serious soil-borne fungal pathogen with a wide host range (Mullen 2001) and prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions, where high temperature and moisture are sufficient to permit growth and survival of the fungal pathogen (Punja 1985). The association of S. rolfsii with <b>boll</b> <b>rot</b> of cotton has been reported from Bangladesh (Shamsi et al. 2008). In India, major diseases of cotton include wilt (Fusarium oxysporum f. vasinfectum), anthracnose (Colletotrichum capsici), and areolate mildew (Ramularia areola) (Rangaswamy and Mahadevan 2002). S. rolfsii infect bolls on branches near ground level, causing boll decay. Numerous sclerotia produced on the affected bolls are the source of secondary inoculum and are dispersed by rain splash during the late monsoon, thus resulting in new infections on the basal stem and leaves of the cotton plant. The disease has resulted in reduced yield and market value of the crop. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the occurrence of S. rolfsii causing <b>boll</b> <b>rot</b> of cotton in India...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Cotton bolls were inoculated {{with a green}} {{fluorescent}} protein (GFP) -expressing Aspergillus fla-vus (strain 70) {{to monitor}} fungal growth, mode of entry, colonization of cottonseeds, and production of afla-toxins. The GFP strain and the wild-type {{did not differ significantly}} in pathogen aggressiveness as indicated by similar reductions in inoculated locule weight. GFP fluorescence was at least 10 times higher than the blue green yellow fluorescence (BGYF) produced in response to infection by A. flavus. The GFP produced by the strain made it possible to identify and monitor specific plant tissues colonized by the fungus. For example, the inner seed coat and cotyledon were colonized by the fungus within 72 h of inoculation and the mode of entry was invariably through the porous chalazal cap in intact seeds. The amount of GFP fluorescence was shown to be an indicator of fungal growth, colonization and, to some extent, aflatoxin production. The A. flavus strain expressing GFP should be very useful for rapidly identifying cotton lines with enhanced resistance to A. flavus colonization devel-oped through genetic engineering or traditional plant breeding. In addition, development of GFP expressing A. flavus strain provides an easy and rapid assay procedure for studying the ecology, etiology, and epidemiology of cotton <b>boll</b> <b>rot</b> caused by A. flavus resulting in aflatoxin contamination...|$|E
40|$|As {{a part of}} an {{investigation}} of aflatoxins and other mycotoxins in cottonseeds at harvest, samples of seeds collected from the 1971 crop at locations across the U. S. Cotton Belt were examined to determine the kinds of microorganisms causing internal or seed-coat infection in the field. Aspergillus flavus infection was absent from all seeds examined from most areas but was present in some samples from Arizona, California, and Texas. Fusarium spp., Alternaria sp., and A. niger caused internal infection at many locations; Colletotrichum gossypii and Rhizopus stolonifer were present in seeds from some areas but were generally much less common. Many of the infections with A. niger were in the seed coat. Bacterial infections were fairly frequent. In a series of commerical samples from Arizona. A. flavus infection was found in 61 % of seeds, with fiber showing the bright, greenish-yellow (BGY) fluorescence that is diagnostic for A. flavus <b>boll</b> <b>rot.</b> Aflatoxin contamination was also concentration in the same seeds. The above findings agree with previous data showing that aflatoxin contamination of cottonseeds before harvest occurs rarely, if at all, {{in most parts of}} the U. S. Cotton Belt and that when such contamination does occur, it tends to be concentrated in seeds with the BGY fluorescence in their fiber and seed fuzz...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} carried out in Yola and Mubi both of which are located in Northeastern Nigeria to {{evaluate}} the efficacy of some plant extracts on the different manifestations of bacterial blight caused by Xam on different cotton varieties. The study was also intended to examine the reaction of these treated varieties to the disease with a view to identify the most effective plant extract. Results revealed that SAMCOT- 8 and SAMCOT- 12 varieties have moderate resistance to Xam haven recorded least mean incidences of vein blight, black arm, boll blight and lowest percentage <b>boll</b> <b>rot</b> and higher yield of seed cotton in both locations. Results further revealed the most effective plant extract to be A. sativum (50 %) which consistently recorded the lowest mean value of 6. 00 % and 9. 33 % seedling blight, 4. 67 % and 30. 00 % vein blight, 10. 66 % and 10. 00 % black arm, 20. 66 and 12. 66 boll blight and yield of 403. 89 kg ha- 1 and 921. 25 kg ha- 1 in Yola and Mubi respectively. From these findings, it can be inferred that the various cotton varieties and plant extracts at 50 % concentration tested on Xam showed promising prospect for management of bacterial blight of cotton. It is hereby suggested that SAMCOT- 8 and SAMCOT- 12 with A. sativum (50 %) and A. cepa (50 %) should be put to further field trial in these locations to determine their effectiveness in the management of Xam...|$|E
40|$|The CQ Cotton Regional Extension {{project has}} been {{a key to the}} {{delivery}} of emerging, cutting edge research information and knowledge to the Central Queensland cotton industry. The direct relevance of southern research to cotton production under the conditions experienced in CQ always has been an issue which could be addressed through regional assessment and adaptation. The project links the national research to the region through development and extension, with a strong focus on the major industry production issues including but not limited to disease, Integrated Pest Management (IPM), soils, nutrition and integrated weed management. Susan Mass has supported the implementation of national industry-wide programs particularly the industry Best Management Practices program (myBMP). This project has successfully transitioned to a focus on delivering national outcomes in target lead areas as part of National Development and Delivery Team established by Cotton CRC, CRDC and Cotton Australia, while maintaining a regional extension presence for Central Queensland cotton & grain farming systems. Susan Mass has very effectively merged and integrated strong regional extension support to cotton growers in Central Queensland with delivery of industry extension priorities across the entire industry in the Development and Delivery Team model. Susan is the target lead for disease and farm hygiene. Recognising the challenges of having regionally relevant research in Central Queensland, this project has facilitated locally based research including <b>boll</b> <b>rot,</b> Bt cotton resistance management, and mealybug biology through strong collaborations. This collaborative approach has included linkage to Department of Environment and Resource Managmeent (DERM) groups and myBMP programs resulting in a high uptake in CQ...|$|E
