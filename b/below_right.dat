5|$|The {{amount of}} a family’s monthly benefit payment depends on that family's {{specific}} characteristics and financial circumstances, {{as well as}} the overall amount of program funds available for distribution. The latest statistics show that benefits average $103 each month (2003, see table <b>below</b> <b>right).</b> It is the Puerto Rico government's responsibility to establish the eligibility requirements and benefit levels for participation in the program. The benefits are revised annually every October 1 to consider the nutritional needs of Puerto Rico's impoverished population, analyze the impact of inflation in Puerto Rico, and plan the distribution of available funds accordingly.|$|E

25|$|After {{the carbon}} dioxide is split from the oxalosuccinate in the {{decarboxylation}} step (<b>below</b> <b>right),</b> the enol will tautomerize to the keto from. The formation of the ketone double bond is started by the deprotonation of that oxygen off the alpha carbon (C#2) by the same lysine that protonated the oxygen in the first place. The {{lone pair of electrons}} moves down kicking off the lone pairs that were making the double bond. This lone pair of electrons abstracts a proton off the Tyrosine that deprotonated the carboxyl group in the decarboxylation step. The reason that we can say that the Lys and Tyr residues will be the same from the previous step is because they are helping in holding the isocitrate molecule in the active site of the enzyme. These two residues will be able to form hydrogen bonds back and forth {{as long as they are}} close enough to the substrate.|$|E

2500|$|Campaigns in the United States have {{historically}} molded public opinion {{to believe that}} wildfires are always harmful to nature. This view {{is based on the}} outdated belief that ecosystems progress toward an equilibrium and that any disturbance, such as fire, disrupts the harmony of nature. More recent ecological research has shown, however, that fire is an integral component in the function and biodiversity of many natural habitats, and that the organisms within these communities have adapted to withstand, and even to exploit, natural wildfire. [...] More generally, fire is now regarded as a 'natural disturbance', similar to flooding, wind-storms, and landslides, that has driven the evolution of species and controls the characteristics of ecosystems. The map <b>below</b> <b>right,</b> shows one view of how ecosystem type in the United States has a characteristic frequency of fire, ranging from once every 10 years to once every 500 years. [...] Natural disturbances can be described by key factors such as frequency, intensity and area. [...] The map also shows intensity, since some fires are understory fires (light burns that affect mostly understory plants) while others are stand replacement fires (intense fires that tend to kill the adult trees as well.) ...|$|E
