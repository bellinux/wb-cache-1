40|$|Constant Velocity [CV] Joints {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} components of front wheel drive axles. It is subjected to various stresses such as bending stress, shear stress and bearing stress. Apart from these stresses, it is also subjected to vibrations, due to out of balance tire or wheel and an out of round tire or wheel, or a <b>bent</b> <b>rim.</b> The main objective of this work is to reduce the stiffness of the damper, so that the damper can withstand within the required constraints [i. e. the forced frequency range of 80 Hz to 150 Hz]. The free vibrational and forced vibrational effects are investigated to predict the resonance phenomenon of the damper. Finite Element Analysis in ANSYS- 11 software was performed to predict the dynamic behavior of the system under the required vibrational frequencies ranging from 80 Hz to 150 Hz at given loading conditions...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} devoted to {{studying}} cultural monuments – bronze vessels, a jug and a basin from the barrow no. 1 / 1967 of the Lebedevka Late Sarmatian burial mound (Western Kazakhstan), {{dating back to the}} middle of the 3 rd century AD at the latest. These items do not find exact parallels among the bronze vessels of provincial Rome. Although the shape of the jug handle with a curved leaf turned upright between two horizontally arranged swan heads has parallels on the so-called “composite jug with handles” (“gegliederten Henkelkrügen”), the cylindrical form of the jug’s neck peculiar of the glass jugs of allegedly Syrian manufacture of the second half of the 3 rd- 4 th centuries AD is very unusual. Even more unusual is a basin with horizontally <b>bent</b> <b>rim</b> and elaborate handles with pearls on a high narrow stand-ring. The XRF analyses of the Lebedevka jug’s metal revealed that its body and handle were made of a copper-based alloy with very high admixtures of zinc (24 - 27 %) and inconsiderable additions of lead (up to 3 %). A similar alloy was used for manufacturing a vessel in the form of a crouching young negro from Niederbieber. Most objects of provincial Roman import reached Western Kazakhstan via the Bosporan kingdom along the Northern branch of the Silk Road. The above discussed bronze vessels from Lebedevka let suggest, that the nomads could receive some import articles that were brought along the caravan routes leading from Egypt and Syria to the East...|$|E

25|$|After {{blowing the}} tire on turn one, Mulford had to limp {{around the track}} for almost an entire lap, and {{subsequently}} <b>bent</b> the <b>rim.</b> That necessitated an even longer pit stop at that juncture to hammer out the damage. The accounts from the newspapers claim that Harroun changed only four tires all day during only three pit stops. Harroun's team changed the right rear tire three times, and one other unspecified tire. Harroun's shorter elapsed time in the pits is alone considered sufficient to more than overcome any track position advantage Mulford might have been thought to have. But the undermining evidence to support Harroun as the rightful winner was the team strategy to run a constant 75mph pace, regardless of position, {{in order to save}} tire wear. During the 1910 Wheeler-Schebler Trophy Race, as well as during test runs in May 1911, Harroun discovered that by merely running a constant 75 mph pace instead of an 80 mph (or faster) pace, he would substantially reduce his tire wear and increase tire life.|$|R
5000|$|American Piano Company (abbr. Ampico) was an American piano {{manufacturer}} eventually {{located in}} East Rochester, New York. The company {{was formed in}} a merger of Chickering & Sons of Boston, Wm Knabe & Co, of Baltimore and Foster Armstrong of Rochester, New York. It was formed {{in response to the}} increasing demand for player pianos, and, as well, the then current impetus towards larger economic entities and aimed at the achievement of economies of scale. The company was established in the period from 1907-1908 and in 1908 floated a prospectus and offering for shares under the name [...] "American Piano Company." [...] After the merger the individual units of the company, especially Chickering & Sons and Knabe continued production of their designs at their factories in Boston and Baltimore, along with lesser known lines. Design collaboration of the expertise of both factories, particularly, and, others as well, led to a refinement of designs and new products with more modern characteristics such as <b>bent</b> <b>rims,</b> more conventional actions, and, in general, more suitability for the addition of player mechanisms. In response to the increasing demand for smaller pianos Chickering had already been producing its line of [...] "quarter grands", introduced around 1902-3, enjoying robust sales of these lines as well. [...] The company flourished in the teens and early twenties, acquiring Mason & Hamlin in 1924, eventually, owning 9 piano factories scattered around {{the eastern part of the}} US and, building on the expertise of Chickering and Knabe, producing an impressive suite of modified designs, suitable for players. However, the demand for pianos began to rapidly weaken in the early twenties with the introduction of radio and electronic amplification of records, until then only of the acoustic, Victrola type. [...] Forseeing the ongoing collapse of the industry, the President of Ampico, a gentleman named Foster, sold his common stock to Bankers' Trust, retaining the preferred. Bankers' Trust installed its own president who altered the companies marketing plan. This substitution of the preexisting marketing approach, at that point sucessful, by the new one had a drastic effect, along with the contracting market, on sales, eventually resulting in bankruptcy for the company around 1928. These alterations are still considered in business schools to be a classic case of how to ruin a market franchise and still an example held up as a model of what not to do in business. [...] The company emerged from bankruptcy as the American Piano Corporation in 1929. As Foster's holdings were now only preferred stock he had a claim on the assets during the bankruptcy and was brought back to manage the company. Notwithstanding the crash of 1929, the company was profitable for the first two years of the new decade, but the complete crash of the economy as the depression depended forced it into bankruptcy again. A similar, large holding company producing pianos and players brought the company out of bankruptcy once more in a new entity known as the Aeolian-American Corporation and continued the process of consolidation of production in Rochester, New York. Aeolian-American continued in production until 1983 and was liquidated in a bankruptcy in 1985. From 1913 Ampico was one of the leading producers of reproducing pianos, the others being Duo-Art (1913) and Welte-Mignon (1905). The player piano and reproducing mechanism was designed by Charles Fuller Stoddard (1876-1958). A great number of distinguished classical and popular pianists, such as Sergei Rachmaninoff (1873-1943), Leo Ornstein (1892-2002), Winifred MacBride, and Marguerite Volavy (1886-1951), recorded for Ampico, and their rolls are a legacy of 19th and early 20th century aesthetic and musical practice. By 1929 Ampico was in essential economic difficulties and was finally taken over by the Aeolian Company, a manufacturer of player pianos and organs. The combined company, known as Aeolian-American Corp., went through several ownership changes before declaring bankruptcy in 1985.|$|R
40|$|Na početku, zbijen u komadu zemljane grude, oblik predmeta se nije razaznavao, međutim, tijekom konzervacijsko-restauracijsko zahvata na brončanom limu postigao sam dva usko vezana efekta: iznova sam osnažio te učvrstio originalne dijelove tankog brončanog lima te vizualno i taktilno ispunio prazan prostor plitke brončane posude. Due to the {{conditions}} {{at the place where}} the finds had been excavated, in the ditch between two walls of the temple where water found its own way to flow along even though filled with layers of soil and rubble (containing archaeological remains), few fragments of metal finds stuck in the vacuum of clay in a layer of soil where they had minimum contact with air and therefore oxidized more slowly. I received bronze material which was compressed within a clod of hardened soil, like a kind of “sandwich”. Only a few-millimetre wide rim of the vessel (Fig. 1) is completely preserved reaching the side that continues into the shallow bottom; together they form round 60 % of the preserved part of the bronze vessel. A precondition for easier conservation of the vessel remains would be separation of bronze sheet from the soil clod. In this respect I determined conservation and restoration phases: - Removal of earth layers - I immerged soil clod with the parts of vessel into a small ultrasound tub filled with distilled water. A part of soil turned into mud and fell off, and the thin bronze sheet was now clean; - Stabilisation of metal surface - I immerged separated parts of the sheet vessel into a wide fire-proof measure filled with distilled water saturated with sodium carbonate NaHCO 3, and put them to simmer on a moderately warm ring. Afterwards, I boiled the complete material one more time in the distilled water, so that the remains of sodium carbonate were neutralised after the previous cooking; - Flattening the dish rim- I warmed the <b>bent</b> edge of <b>rim</b> (softened the structure of the alloy at its critical point at high temperature) and folded it back to the bow direction of the rim line; - Gluing dish fragments - having found the connecting surfaces of sheet parts, I glued them with both quick-drying adhesive and two-component epoxy resin; - Reconstruction and removal of calcite layers - in accordance with the material of the object to be reconstructed (thin bronze sheet) I decided to use thin sheet of brass alloy (Fig. 3), which could easily be folded into a wished shape, and was thinner than the original so that when the whole vessel was reinforced, a few layers of artificial patina/verdigris (Verdigris: a greenish blue substance that forms on the surface of some metals in wet conditions) could be applied. Having additionally reinforced the object, I could more safely remove the remains of calcite film o? the bottom of the shallow vessel; - Fixing artificial verdigris and polishing - I used fine machine brushes to polish the original surface of the vessel in order to make green verdigris lustreless (Fig. 4); - Application of protective lacquer - {{the next step was to}} protect the whole surface of bronze vessel with Paraloid B 72 protective lacquer in Ksilen C 8 H 10 solvent; - Conclusion - all the above mentioned phases of conservation work on the bronze vessel aimed at the reconstruction of the vessel; they should be stressed because these vessel parts were in a very poor condition that they crumbled at a touch. I achieved two crucial things by the reconstruction: I reinforced the old weak material, and visually filled the empty surface of the metal vessel...|$|R
