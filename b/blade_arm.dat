40|$|This paper {{presents}} a tracked robot with <b>blade</b> <b>arms</b> powered to assist movement in difficult environments. As a result, the tracked robot {{is able to}} pass a ramp or climb stairs. The main feature {{is a pair of}} <b>blade</b> <b>arms</b> {{on both sides of the}} vehicle body working in collaboration with previously validated transformable track system. When the robot encounters an obstacle in a terrain, it enlists the <b>blade</b> <b>arms</b> with power to overcome the obstacle. In disaster areas, there usually will be terrains that are full of broken and complicated slopes, broken walls, rubbles, and ditches. Thereupon, a robot, which is instructed to pass through such disaster areas, needs to have a good off-road capability for such complicated terrains. The robot with crawling-assisting <b>blade</b> <b>arms</b> would overcome the obstacles along the terrains, and possibly become to be a rescue robot. A prototype has been developed and built; experiments were carried out to validate the enhanced crawling capability of the robot...|$|R
5000|$|Ankylo {{can replace}} Tricera on AbarenOh to form AbarenOh Veilus (Abaren'ō Beirusu), forming a shield and drill <b>blade</b> <b>arm.</b> It can defend against attacks with the Veil Blocker (Beiru Burokkā), {{and can be}} used {{together}} with the Tyranno Drill for the Bakuryū Finisher Double Tornado (Bakuryū Hissatsu Saburu Torunēdo) finisher.|$|E
5000|$|Nokogiri Banki (Nokogiri Banki): A saw (nokogiri) Savage Earth Barbaric Machine Beast who ends his {{sentences}} with [...] "Giri." [...] With his saw <b>blade</b> <b>arm,</b> Nokogiri Banki can {{cut through}} any material, though he only targeted things taller than himself. His only weakness {{was a constant}} tightening of the bolt that keeps his forearm together. Though scrapped by Engine-Oh G6, Hiramechimedes rebuilds him into the stronger Chainsaw Banki (20). Now chainsaw (chēnsō)-based with his weaknesses removed, Chainsaw Banki was properly used by Hiramechimedes in a plan to take out both Go-on teams while polluting the air, only for Jum-bowhale's interference to ruin it as Chainsaw Banki is scrapped by Seiku-Oh. Voiced by Takayuki Godai (Godai Takayuki), who previously portrayed Takayuki Hiba/Vul Eagle II in Taiyo Sentai Sun Vulcan.|$|E
5000|$|Shibolena (1-50) is a cybernetic gynoid {{modeled after}} Hinelar's long dead daughter, Shizuka. Considers herself the {{masterpiece}} of Dr. Hinelar's work. She was second-in-command to Hinelar on the Gran Nejiros, a mistress of disguise and illusions. Armed with a rapier, {{she was also}} the smart one, often initiating plans for conquest. Creating Bara Nejire through her own DNA, Shibolena poses as a nun to give her offshoot's roses to children, turning them into slaves and subject them to Akumatherapy (or Demon Therapy) to create [...] "Petit Bara Nejire". But {{with one of the}} children being her new friend Ruri, Chisato arrives and nearly exposes herself as Mega Yellow (whom Shibolena establishes a rivalry with) to wound Shibolena with her <b>Blade</b> <b>Arm.</b> Fortunately, Mega Blue creates a holographic duplicate of Chisato to confuse Shibolena. She was critically wounded near the finale, by Mega Red, while protecting Yugande. She makes it back to the Gran Nejiros, to inform Hinelar of Yugande's death. Her body explodes right before Dr. Hinelar's eyes after she say goodbye to her master. The design of her hairstyle-like helmet is based on a CG illustration used as reference.|$|E

50|$|Antarctic Type 10: Appears in episode 4. Powers {{include a}} Daimidaler disguise, <b>bladed</b> <b>arms</b> armed with machine guns, a pelvis anchor called the Tail Punch, and a pelvis beam cannon called the Tail Beam.|$|R
50|$|Alex {{can also}} {{transform}} {{parts of his}} body into a selection of martial implements acquired {{over the course of}} the game, either as purchased upgrades or being given them. Offensive powers include the large and powerful <b>Blade</b> <b>arm,</b> fast razor-sharp Claws (which can also erupt large spikes from the ground), the telescoping Whipfist, Musclemass that augments his strength, and the slow but powerful Hammerfists. Defensive options consist of a large shield on Alex's left arm for blocking ballistic attacks that needs to regenerate after excessive damage, and full body armor that exchanges agility and speed for toughness in hand-to-hand combat; both will allow Alex to plow through most obstacles when active. Vision modes include thermal vision, which allows Alex to see enemies through smoke and other obstacles at the expense of a decreased vision range, and Infected vision, which highlights those infected with the BLACKLIGHT virus as well as military units. Both vision modes muffle all of Alex's other senses, such as hearing, in order to concentrate on his sight. One defensive and offensive power may be active at a time, and using either will negate Alex's current disguise. In addition to his own abilities, Alex can take the weapons from defeated or absorbed enemies. These include automatic rifles, machine guns, grenade launchers and missile launchers. He can also seize control of military vehicles, such as tanks and helicopters.|$|E
50|$|Faces: {{appears in}} episode 12. Powers include speed, large <b>bladed</b> <b>arms,</b> can attach faces {{to his body}} to morph into his giga effect form, and in his giga effect form {{a second set of}} jaws on the abdomen and can emit slicing shockwaves from his extra <b>blades</b> on his <b>arms.</b> His human {{absorbing}} powers are very similar to those of Jinmen in the Devilman OVAs.|$|R

50|$|By {{the time}} Mortal Kombat: Deception had released, {{it was shown}} that Baraka's race of Tarkatan were all exact duplicates of one another without any {{significant}} features to differentiate them. This was slightly fixed in the 2011 installment of Mortal Kombat, as other Tarkatan appear during the game's story and challenge modes that have different, distinguishing features from each other, most notably {{in the fact that}} only Baraka uses his <b>bladed</b> <b>arms</b> while other Tarkatans have visible blades.|$|R
50|$|Klein This robotic monster {{appeared}} in episode 14. It has four <b>bladed</b> <b>arms,</b> the alpha ray that fires rain-like pink lasers, the beta ray that emits pink lightning bolts, the gamma ray that fires pink homing lasers, teleportation by combining its rays, will explode if used too long, flight, kicking, three teleporting missiles from the abdomen, and living flaming debris after exploding. This robotic monster {{is one of}} the few battle robots to appear in various Super Robot Wars titles.|$|R
5000|$|Death is {{aided by}} Despair, a horse that is {{available}} for use in open areas of the overworld for faster travel, and Dust, a raven that guides him to his objectives. Death's primary weapons are two scythes, one wielded in each hand. Secondary weapons include melee weapons like hammers, axes, and maces as [...] "slow" [...] options; [...] "fast" [...] options are generally gauntlet-style weapons that provide the player with claws and other <b>bladed</b> <b>arm</b> extensions, {{at the expense of}} less range and power than the slow weapons.|$|R
50|$|Plainmanto: Appears in episode 41. Powers include flight, {{projectile}} resistant <b>bladed</b> mantis <b>arms,</b> mouth missiles, extendable knee blades, red eye beams, {{and a pair}} of blades {{from the}} back.|$|R

50|$|Its fronds are 3 to 8 m long, borne on brown stipes which grow paler {{in color}} towards the <b>blade,</b> <b>armed</b> with 0.6 mm thorns. The rachis, like {{the top of}} the stipe, is light brown to straw-colored. The blades are oblong in shape and tripinnate, the pinnulets at the base being lobed (tripinnate-pinnatifid). Scattered tiny hairs are present on the {{underside}} (only) of the costae, costules, and some veins. Sori are {{at the edge of the}} leaf with straw-colored pseudoindusia. It most closely resembles H. melanochlaena, H. repens, and H. scandens, all of which are also large with thorny stems.|$|R
5000|$|Much like in {{the first}} game, Isaac must fight the Necromorphs, organisms that mutate and take control of human corpses. To take down Necromorphs, the player must use [...] "strategic dismemberment": in other words, slicing off limbs or {{sections}} of the Necromorphs' bodies. For example, shooting a Slasher Necromorph in the head will, like many other types, have little effect; however, it can be stopped by shooting its <b>bladed</b> <b>arms</b> off. Depending on how they are wounded, some Necromorphs, like the Pregnant and the Ubermorph, can adopt new stances and tactics, even sprouting new limbs or spawning more enemies in the process.|$|R

5000|$|... : A unique Horror {{that has}} {{no need for a}} human host, once said to have wiped out an entire village in one night. Possessing a time-piece, {{altering}} it into a variety of forms, Morax lures those driven by time to pick him up. Once he has a hold on his victim, by after dusk, it dehydrates the victim until only dust remains. Forced to use humans as host, Morax takes advantage of Kouga's sympathy for humans to escape. Once he captures Kaoru, Morax assumes the form of a clock tower. Though he is armed with arsenal of <b>bladed</b> <b>arms,</b> Morax is killed finally by Garo, ripped out of his vessel as it crumbles to the ground.|$|R
5000|$|The {{longer the}} bones of the {{shoulder}} <b>blade</b> and <b>arm,</b> the easier it is to fold legs and tuck over fences. The laid back scapula slides back to the horizontal as the horse lifts its front legs, increasing the horse's scope over fences. https://web.archive.org/web/20110929123054/http://www.earlwarren.com/ews_graphics/hunter.jpg ...|$|R
5000|$|Sasuke: A ninja {{trained by}} Hattori Hanzo and {{assistant}} to Yukimura Sanada. His weapon {{is a pair}} of <b>arm</b> <b>blades.</b>|$|R

50|$|The only {{specimen}} is {{a partial}} right forelimb, including shoulder <b>blade,</b> upper <b>arm</b> bone, the two {{bones of the}} lower arm (ulna and radius), and three metacarpals. These fossils (Field number MGUAN-PA-003) are stored in the Museu de Geologia of the Universidade Agostinho Neto in Luanda.|$|R
50|$|These {{machines}} are {{so big that}} they must be partially dismantled for shipment to most sites. Some are shipped in the United States by railroad flatcars with the <b>blade,</b> push <b>arms</b> and ripper frame removed. Others are dismantled into several units for transport by multiple semi-trailer trucks.|$|R
40|$|Z {{is a name}} {{created by}} the project to collect and follow what it {{perceives}} as indelible, a situation with resounding atmosphere: - The snap of an unripe nectarine, its dulled sweetness. -The posture of a praying mantis, its scissor <b>blade</b> <b>arms.</b> - The smell of air conditioning. - A dark tone of green. Z is the moment where one swoons, drawn into the grips of a presence, as familiar as it is unexplained. The project analyses spaces, objects, and situations where Z threatens to exist. The project searches for Z in the way one may follow a sound, not knowing what it is, searching for its source. The project uses alleged recordings of Z as the conceptual basis of a sculptural practice involving the making of objects and spaces...|$|R
50|$|Anti-Zegapain Coatlicue: <b>Armed</b> with <b>arm</b> <b>blades</b> {{that fire}} lasers {{and serve as}} shields, a torso beam, and the Holonic Bolt Pressure from the head.|$|R
60|$|The bright swords crossed, and {{the first}} touch of them, {{travelling}} down <b>blade</b> and <b>arm,</b> told each combatant that {{the heart of the}} other was awakened. It was not in that way that the swords rang together when they had rushed on each other in the little garden behind the dealer's shop.|$|R

His attacks include Full-Body Blades (Zenshin Yaiba) and ShurikenTurbulence Shot (Shuriken Midareuchi). He goes to fight the Shinkengers to avenge Isagitsune, nearly killing the five before he falls back into the Sanzu River. By the time he resumes his campaign of vengeance, the Shinkengers have Shinken Gold by their side. He is destroyed by a Fiery Dance/Hundred Fillets combo, Hyakuyappa battled Shinkenoh upon being revived before Shinken Gold arrives in the Ika Origami to form Ika-Shinkenoh who freezes the Ayakashi before finishing him off with Squid Flash. His appearance and weapons are the basis of the Amikiri (網切) of Japanese myth. Voiced by Chihiro Suzuki (Suzuki Chihiro).|$|R
