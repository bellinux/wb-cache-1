5|$|Bruchus rufimanus, {{commonly}} known as the broad bean weevil, broad <b>bean</b> <b>beetle,</b> or broad bean seed beetle is a weevil which inhabits crops and fields, as well as some homes. It is a pest of faba beans (Vicia faba L.).The adult weevils feed on pollen, while their larvae tunnel in seeds destroying crops and moving on to new ones once they dry out. The adult beetle, being one of the biggest of its genus, ranges from 3 to 5mm in length.|$|E
25|$|Some {{species in}} the {{subfamily}} Epilachninae are herbivores, and can be very destructive agricultural pests (e.g., the Mexican <b>bean</b> <b>beetle).</b> Again, in the subfamily Coccinellinae, members of the tribe Halyziini and the genus Tythaspis are mycophagous.|$|E
2500|$|The {{majority}} of coccinellid species are generally considered useful insects, because many species prey on herbivorous homopterans such as aphids or scale insects, which are agricultural pests. [...] Many coccinellids {{lay their eggs}} directly in aphid and scale insect colonies {{in order to ensure}} their larvae have an immediate food source. However, some species do have unwelcome effects; among these, the most prominent are of the subfamily Epilachninae (which includes the Mexican <b>bean</b> <b>beetle),</b> which are herbivorous themselves. Usually, epilachnines are only minor agricultural pests, eating the leaves of grain, potatoes, beans, and various other crops, but their numbers can increase explosively in years when their natural enemies, such as parasitoid wasps that attack their eggs, are few. In such situations, they can do major crop damage. They occur in practically all the major crop-producing regions of temperate and tropical countries.|$|E

5000|$|Beginning in 1966, Pediobius foveolatus was {{imported}} to the United States to {{be tested}} for potential control of Mexican <b>bean</b> <b>beetle.</b> Initial testing determined that Pediobius foveolatus would readily parasitize the larvae of Mexican <b>bean</b> <b>beetle,</b> while leaving native, predatory coccinellids unharmed. In 1972, Maryland, then other states, began releasing Pediobius foveolatus to control Mexican <b>bean</b> <b>beetle.</b> USDA branches in New Jersey, Maryland, Delaware and Virginia released wasps throughout these states, focusing on areas with large soybean acreage and high Mexican <b>bean</b> <b>beetle</b> populations. [...] Inoculative releases of Pediobius foveolatus yielded positive results; parasitism rates of 80 to 100% of Mexican <b>bean</b> <b>beetle</b> larvae were commonly documented near release sites. However, Steven et al. (1975) also reported slow population dispersal from these sites. Also, Pediobius foveolatus cannot overwinter in the United States due to cold winters and the lack of an overwintering host. In Pediobius foveolatus native territory, the weather either is conducive for year-round exposure, or wasps overwinter in their hosts, which overwinter as larvae. Because Mexican <b>bean</b> <b>beetle</b> overwinter as adults, wasps are without adequate winter refuge in the United States [...] Because Pediobius foveolatus can neither overwinter successfully nor spread rapidly, management with this wasp requires yearly releases in more locations than is practical to control of Mexican <b>bean</b> <b>beetle</b> on a large scale. By the mid-1980s, all states except New Jersey had discontinued state-run releases of P. foveolatus. At this time, pest pressure from Mexican <b>bean</b> <b>beetle</b> began its sharp decline as well, especially in soybean.|$|E
50|$|Managing Mexican <b>bean</b> <b>beetle</b> using Pediobius foveolatus can be {{difficult}} due to its sensitivity to cool, wet weather, {{and the need for}} a release date to line up with the phenology of Mexican <b>bean</b> <b>beetle</b> larvae. Ideally, Pediobius foveolatus is released at both one and two weeks after first instar Mexican <b>bean</b> <b>beetle</b> larvae are discovered in beans. Pediobius foveolatus wasps reproduce most successfully within the older and larger beetle larvae; if older, larger Mexican <b>bean</b> <b>beetle</b> instars are present when Pediobius foveolatus is released, they will be without a host. Pediobius foveolatus is also sensitive cold and wet weather, and are unlike to survive when released in these conditions. Wasps are generally released rate of 1000 wasps (or 50 mummies) per 3600 square feet of beans. Successful parasitism and emergence of the next generation of wasps is visibly monitored by the presence of dark-brown, dead Mexican <b>bean</b> <b>beetle</b> larvae (“mummies”). Mummies exhibit one small hole from which adult Pediobius foveolatus wasps exited.|$|E

When beetles were fed on Pinto bean leaves dipped in purified virus concentrations of 1 or 10 mg virus/ml buffer, the amount of virus in the regurgitants and serial transmission levels by both beetles were related to the concentration from which acquisition occurred. A reduction in trans-mission levels with time after acquisition feeding occurred at different rates for each species of beetle and was associated with decrease of virus in the regurgitant.

The <b>bean</b> leaf <b>beetle</b> {{is one of the}} major vectors of bean pod mottle virus, which causes seed staining and can cause a downgrading of the soybeans at market from food grade to feed grade. Feeding from the soybean aphid causes stunted plants, reduced pods and seeds, and can transmit viruses that cause mottling and distortion of the leaves and a reduced seed set.
