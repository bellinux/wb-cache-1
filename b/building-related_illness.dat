5000|$|While sick {{building}} syndrome (SBS) encompasses a multitude of non-specific symptoms, <b>building-related</b> <b>illness</b> (BRI) comprises specific, diagnosable symptoms caused by certain agents (chemicals, bacteria, fungi, etc.). These can typically be identified, measured, and quantified. [...] There are usually 4 causal agents in BRI; 1.) Immunologic, 2.) Infectious, 3.) toxic, and 4.) irritant. [...] For instance, Legionnaire's disease, usually caused by Legionella pneumophila, involves a specific organism which could be ascertained through clinical findings {{as the source of}} contamination within a building. SBS does not have any known cure; alleviation consists of removing the affected person from the building associated with non-specific symptoms. BRI, on the other hand, utilizes treatment appropriate for the contaminant identified within the building (e.g., antibiotics for Legionnaire's disease). In most cases, simply improving the indoor air quality (IAQ) of a particular building will attenuate, or even eliminate, the acute symptoms of SBS, while removal of the source contaminant would prove more effective for a specific illness, {{as in the case of}} BRI. [...] <b>Building-Related</b> <b>Illness</b> is vital to the overall understanding of Sick Building Syndrome because BRI illustrates a causal path to infection, theoretically. Office BRI may more likely than not be explained by three events: “Wide range in the threshold of response in any population (susceptibility), a spectrum of response to any given agent, or variability in exposure within large office buildings." [...] Isolating any one of the three aspects of office BRI can be a great challenge, which is why those who find themselves with BRI should take three steps, history, examinations, and interventions. History describes the action of continually monitoring and recording the health of workers experiencing BRI, as well as obtaining records of previous building alterations or related activity. Examinations go hand in hand with monitoring employee health. This step is done by physically examining the entire workspace and evaluating possible threats to health status among employees. Interventions follow accordingly based off the results of the Examination and History report.|$|E

The aim {{of the present study}} was to assess the acute health effects of this compound in humans. DESIGN: Acute effects were assessed via chamber exposure to (1 mg/m 3) 3 -MF. PARTICIPANTS AND MEASUREMENTS: Twenty-nine volunteers provided symptom reports, ocular electromyograms, measurement of eye tear film break-up time, vital staining of the eye, nasal lavage, acoustic rhinometry, transfer tests, and dynamic spirometry. RESULTS: No subjective ratings were significantly increased during exposure. Blinking frequency and the lavage biomarkers myeloperoxidase and lysozyme were significantly increased, and forced vital capacity was significantly decreased during exposure to 3 -MF compared with air control.

40|$|Significantly {{decreasing}} {{energy consumption}} in buildings requires more air-tight construction combined with much higher insulation levels. A potential unintended {{consequence of this}} approach has been deterioration in the indoor air quality, resulting from significantly reduced ventilation rates and the accumulation of airborne pollutants, and this {{has proven to be}} a bottleneck to successful implementation of legislation. The use of natural bio-based insulation materials has increased in recent years, largely driven by concerns over the embodied energy and whole-life environmental impact of insulation materials. This has led to their increased use, typically within breathable wall constructions. A breathable wall construction allows the insulation material to directly contribute to the indoor air quality. Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) having boiling points within the range 60 - 280 °C contribute to the indoor air contamination in buildings, and at certain concentrations can contribute to <b>building-related</b> <b>illnesses.</b> This paper presents some findings from the early stages of a phased experimental study to explore use of bio-based insulation materials, including hemp-lime and sheep’s wool, to reduce VOCs from the room atmosphere. There are many different volatile organic compounds and this study will consider the Total Volatile Organic Compound (TVOC) emissions expressed as toluene, as well as the formaldehyde emissions separately. Insulation specimens with nominal dimensions 200 x 60 x 50 mm were prepared and placed in horizontally mounted cylindrical chambers. Air maintained at 23 °C (± 2 °C) and 50 % (± 5 %) RH was fed in coaxially to one end of the cylinder. The exhaust air was sampled for VOCs and for formaldehyde following 3 and 28 day of exposure.

We report {{the case of}} a worker with a respiratory illness related to bioaerosol exposure in a water-damaged building with extensive fungal contamination. We performed environmental tests to evaluate potential exposure to fungi, and we used mycotoxin-specific IgG antibody in serologic studies in the attempt to evaluate exposure to mycotoxins. Extensive fungal contamination was documented {{in many areas of the}} building. Penicillium, Aspergillus, and Stachybotrys species were the most predominant fungi found in air sampling. Our serologic test was not useful in differentiating workers who were probably occupationally exposed to mycotoxins from those who were not; however, it did yield evidence that individuals may make specific IgG antibodies to macrocyclic tricothecene mycotoxins. Further research is needed concerning health effects related to bioaerosol exposures, particularly regarding markers of exposure to specific fungi that may produce mycotoxins.

Air was drawn onto PTFE membrane filters, which were incubated with human whole blood from healthy volunteers inside the collection device. Cytokine release was measured by ELISA. The test detects endotoxins and non-endotoxins, such as fungal spores, Gram-positive bacteria and their lipoteichoic acid moiety and pyrogenic dust particles with high sensitivity, thus reflecting the total inflammatory capacity of a sample. When air from different surroundings such as working environments and animal housing was assayed, the method yielded reproducible data which correlated with other parameters of microbial burden tested.

40|$|Sick {{building}} syndrome <b>Building-related</b> <b>illness</b> Cancer risk Allergic reactions There {{is a lack}} {{of precision}} in the definition of health, which leads to confusion in the assessment of adverse effects arising from indoor air pollution. Adverse health effects range from annoyance to life-threatening conditions. Survey responses suggest that males and females differ in their perception of a healthy person, but both sexes envisage a male in terms of positive fitness, strength, energy and the possession of an athletic body, rather than how long one was likely to live. Psychological fitness was relatively unimportant in describing the health of others, but was rated as very important with respect to one’s own health. Mortality statistics tend to obscure the proportion of the population who suffer chronic illness that is not life threatening. Although health is largely determined by genetic constitution, lifestyle and environmental factors, the morale of an individual is also important. A new classification of the adverse effects on health of indoor air pollution is proposed: this includes ’comfort’ responses, such as sick building syndrome (category 1); acute biological effects, including allergies and microbiological infections (category 2 A); acute chemi-cal effects, the nature of which depends upon the specific intoxicant (category 2 B), and perceived chronic grave risk, including cancer causation (category 3). The magnitude of risk in this latter category is imprecise, because its measure-ment involves the technique of quantitative risk assessment...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Damp <b>building–related</b> {{respiratory}} <b>illnesses</b> are {{an important}} public health issue. OBJECTIVE: We compared three respiratory case groups defined by questionnaire responses [200 respiratory cases, 123 of the respiratory cases who met the epidemiologic asthma definition, and 49 of the epidemiologic asthma cases who had current physician-diagnosed asthma with postoccupancy onset] to a comparison group of 152 asymptomatic employees in an office building {{with a history of}} water damage. METHODS: We analyzed dust samples collected from floors and chairs of 323 cases and comparisons for culturable fungi, ergosterol, endotoxin, and cat and dog allergens. We examined associations of total fungi, hydrophilic fungi (requiring water activity ≥ 0. 9), and ergosterol with the health outcomes using logistic regression models. RESULTS: In models adjusted for demographics, respiratory illnesses showed significant linear exposure–response relationships to total culturable fungi [interquartile range odds ratios (IQR-OR) = 1. 37 – 1. 72], hydrophilic fungi (IQR-OR = 1. 45 – 2. 19), and ergosterol (IQR-OR = 1. 54 – 1. 60) in floor and chair dusts. Of three outcomes analyzed, current asthma with postoccupancy physician diagnosis was most strongly associated with exposure to hydrophilic fungi in models adjusted for ergosterol, endotoxin, and demographics (IQR-OR = 2. 09 for floor and 1. 79 for chair dusts). Ergosterol levels in floor dust were significantly associated with epidemiologic asthma independent of culturable fungi (IQR-OR = 1. 54 – 1. 55). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings extend the 2004 conclusions of the Institute of Medicine [Human health effects associated with damp indoor environments. In: Damp Indoor Spaces and Health. Washington DC:National Academies Press, 183 – 269] by showing that mold levels in dust were associated with new-onset asthma in this damp indoor environment. Hydrophilic fungi and ergosterol as measures of fungal biomass may have promise as markers of risk of building-related respiratory diseases in damp indoor environments...|$|R
40|$|Aim of the Study: The complex {{hospital}} environment requires {{special attention}} to ensure a healthy indoor air quality (IAQ) to protect patients and healthcare workers against hospital-acquired infections and occupational diseases. Poor hospital IAQ may cause outbreaks of <b>building-related</b> <b>illness</b> such as headaches, fatigue, eye, and skin irritations, and other symptoms. The general objective {{for this study was}} to assess IAQ inside a large University hospital at Al-Khobar City in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia. Materials and Methods: Different locations representing areas where most activities and tasks are performed were selected as sampling points for air pollutants in the selected hospital. In addition, several factors were studied to determine those that were most likely to affect the IAQ levels. The temperature and relative percent humidity of different air pollutants were measured simultaneously at each location. Results: The outdoor levels of all air pollutant levels, except volatile organic compounds (VOCs), were higher than the indoor levels which meant that the IAQ inside healthcare facilities (HCFs) were greatly affected by outdoor sources, particularly traffic. The highest levels of total suspended particulates (TSPs) and those less than 10 microns (PM 10) inside the selected hospital were found at locations that are characterized with m 4 ore human activity. Conclusions:Levels of particulate matter (both PM 10 and TSP) were higher than the Air Quality Guidelines (AQGs). The highest concentrations of the fungal species recorded were Cladosporium and Penicillium. Education of occupants of HCF on IAQ is critical. They must be informed about the sources and effects of contaminants and the proper operation of the ventilation system...|$|E
40|$|Evidence is accumulating that {{indicates}} air quality problems in {{residential and commercial}} buildings are nearly always associated with inadequacies in building design and methods of operation. Thus, the very systems depended on to control the indoor environment can become indirect sources of contamination if diligence is not exercised at each stage of a building's life: a) planning and design, b) construction and commissioning, c) operation, and d) demolition or renovation. In this paper, an engineering perspective is presented in which the existing building stock is characterized {{in terms of its}} environmental performance. Preliminary data indicate that 20 to 30 % of the existing buildings have sufficient problems to manifest as sick-building syndrome or <b>building-related</b> <b>illness,</b> while another 10 to 20 % may have undetected problems. Thus, only about 50 to 70 % of the existing buildings qualify as healthy buildings. Two methods and three mechanisms of control are described to achieve "acceptable" indoor air quality: source control and exposure control. If sources cannot be removed, some level of occupant exposure will result. To control exposures with acceptable values, the primary sensory receptors of the occupants (i. e., thermal, ocular, auditory, and olfactory) cannot be excessively stimulated. The three exposure control mechanisms are conduction, radiation, and convection. To achieve acceptable occupant responses, it is often practical to integrate the mechanisms of radiation and convection in heating, ventilating, and air conditioning systems that are designed to provide acceptable thermal, acoustic, and air quality conditions within occupied spaces.

Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) is considered to be the prototype for these NIMPs-related diseases; however, there is no consensus on the definitions or diagnostic criteria for HP and the spectrum of related illnesses. In order to identify the possible diagnostic markers for illnesses associated with NIMPs in alveolar lining fluid, we performed a proteomic analysis using a two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid from patients with exposure to NIMPs in the context of damp <b>building-related</b> <b>illness</b> (DBRI) or conditions on the borderline to acute HP, designated here as agricultural type of microbial exposure (AME). Samples from patients with HP and sarcoidosis (SARC) were included for reference. Results were compared to results of healthy subjects (CTR). Western blot was used for validation of potential marker proteins from BAL fluid and plasma. Protein expression patterns suggest a close similarity between AME and HP, while DBRI was similar to CTR. However, in DBRI the levels of the inflammation associated molecules galectin- 3 and alpha- 1 -antitrypsin were increased. A novel finding emerging from this study was the increases of semenogelin levels in BAL fluid from patients with AME, HP and SARC. Histone 4 levels were increased in AME, HP and SARC. Elevated plasma levels of histone 2 B were detected in HP and SARC, suggesting it to be a potential blood indicator for inflammatory diseases of the lungs. In this study, the proteomic changes in bronchoalveolar lavage of DBRI patients were distinct from other NIMP exposure associated lung diseases, while changes in AME overlapped those observed for HP patient samples. Some of the proteins identified in this study, semenogelin and histone 4, could function as diagnostic markers for differential diagnosis between DBRI and HP-like conditions...|$|E
