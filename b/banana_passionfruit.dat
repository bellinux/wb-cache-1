50|$|Bidwill {{returned}} to Australia in 1844, in company {{with his other}} sister Mary. On his return voyage he brought back to Australia specimens of <b>bananas,</b> apples, <b>passionfruit</b> and apricots. After his return he established his own nursery (thought to have been at Camden). Examples of his camellias are still grown in the Camden area. He also continued his experimentation on hybridising gladioli. Later in 1844 he again {{returned to}} New Zealand, sailing on to Tahiti. He attempted to establish a passionfruit plantation in Tahiti, which failed. He sent living examples of Tahitian orchids to England, but these were misdirected and sent instead to his father.|$|R

50|$|Nyako {{was born}} a cattle owner as {{his mother had been}} {{allocated}} some cows for her offspring before he was born. He was, therefore, most involved with cattle rearing and later general agricultural development {{while he was in the}} Naval Service. The main issue as he understood it was improving substantially the productivity of Nigeria's agricultural units and the quality of their products. He commenced a sustainable cross-breeding programme of his local cattle with exotic superior sires in 1990 with very satisfactory results. He also got involved in the production of horticultural crops, and his first commercial export of musk melons to Europe using chartered aircraft took place in January 1990. Exotic mangoes from his mango orchard of 50,000 trees were first exported to Europe in 1993. He is also presently involved in the modern production of dates, <b>passionfruit,</b> <b>banana,</b> pasture development, breeding of goats and fish farming.|$|R
5000|$|Agriculture is very {{important}} to the lifestyle of Niueans and the economy, and around 204 square kilometres of the land area are available for agriculture. Subsistence agriculture is very much part of Niue's culture, where nearly all the households have plantations of taro. Taro is a staple food, and the pink taro now dominant in the taro markets in New Zealand and Australia is an intellectual property of Niue. This is one of the naturally occurring taro varieties on Niue, and has a strong resistance to pests. The Niue taro is known in Samoa as [...] "talo Niue" [...] and in international markets as pink taro. Niue exports taro to New Zealand.Tapioca or cassava, yams and kumara also grow very well, as do different varieties of <b>bananas.</b> Coconut meat, <b>passionfruit</b> and limes dominated exports in the 1970s, but in 2008 vanilla, noni and taro were the main export crops.|$|R
40|$|Tropical fruits play an {{important}} role in the economy of Queensland. The major crops are banana, mango, pineapple and papaya. For the past 20 years, biotechnology has been applied to tropical fruit species in Queensland. Micropropagation systems have been developed for <b>banana,</b> pineapple, papaya, <b>passionfruit</b> and coffee; and good embryogenic protocols have been employed in banana, mango and papaya. A program of intergeneric hybridisation between papaya and related Vasconcella species has continued since 1991 and has been facilitated by embryo rescue and plantlet production, and micropropagation in vitro. Cryopreservation protocols are being developed for several tropical fruit species. Transformation systems have been used to produce disease resistant genotypes of papaya and to prevent blackheart, to control flowering and delay ripening of pineapple. Molecular marker technology has been used for genotype identification and to confirm intergeneric hybrids between papaya and related Vasconcella species. Molecular maps have been developed for two Vasconcella species. Genetic diversity within mangosteen populations and between related wild species has been evaluated with RAF markers. Specific DAF markers have been identified for sex determination in papaya, and SCAR markers have been developed to identify dwarfism in bananas and the PRSV-P resistant gene in Vasconcella cundinamarcensis.

40|$|Mangroves are a {{precious}} asset, providing protection against coastal erosion and shelter for fish and shellfish, {{and a source}} of wood (see Spore 82). The issue is how to get the best out of mangroves without destroying them, and in the Philippines they seem to have found the solution in a simple measure called ANA'. Abbreviated from Agri-nipa-aquaculture, ANA is a technique which integrates three practices on one mangrove plot: sugar palm plantation (the palm is also known as Nipa - Nypa fruticans), market gardening and aquaculture. The nipa trees are planted in the centre of the plot. They stabilise the soil, their fibres and wood can be used in handicrafts, and sugar, vinegar and alcohol is made from their sap. Depending on the tides, the trees are partially submerged and provide a natural refuge for fish, as well as a place to raise tilapia and milkfish (Chanos chanos), which breed and grow there very quickly. Ditches are dug {{around the perimeter of the}} nipa plantation, and dikes are built up on the outside of the ditches. The dikes are then planted with market garden vegetables and fruits; those best suited for the saline conditions are tomatoes, aubergine, okra, maize, groundnuts, pineapples, <b>passionfruit,</b> <b>bananas</b> and jackfruit. Waste vegetation from the mangrove is used in a compost which is applied to the dikes. All in all, this is an efficient and well-integrated system but it cannot be used everywhere. To grow nipa and raise tilapia, you need a flow of freshwater.

In its Latin American homeland, it is known as curuba, curuba de Castilla, or curuba sabanera blanca (Colombia); taxo, tacso, tagso, tauso (Ecuador); parcha, taxo (Venezuela), tumbo or curuba (Bolivia); tacso, tumbo, tumbo del norte, trompos, tintin or purpur (Peru).|$|E
50|$|In {{regard to}} its origin, various {{explanations}} are given.

The Moche apparently used the fermented juice from the local <b>banana</b> <b>passionfruit.</b> Recent investigations further show, during the Inca Empire, fish were marinated with the use of chicha, an Andean fermented beverage. Different chronicles also report, along the Peruvian coast prior to the arrival of Europeans, fish was consumed with salt and ají. Furthermore, this theory proposes the natives simply switched to the citrus fruits brought by the Spanish colonists, but the main concepts of the plate remain essentially the same.|$|E

50|$|The lowland {{areas are}} quite highly {{populated}} and therefore urban development, {{agriculture and forestry}} are {{a major threat to}} natural habitats there. One block of lowland forest remains in and around Whanganui National Park and large areas of the uplands are protected either by Maori tradition or in national parks of which Te Urewera is the largest. The four North Island national parks, which surround the plateau, are Te Urewera, Whanganui, Egmont and New Zealand's first national park, the World Heritage listed Tongariro National Park. Introduced species and livestock grazing are now major threats to some endemic species. Rats, cats and stoats prey on native reptiles and birds (including the kokako, blue duck and brown kiwi), while imported plants such as old man’s beard, <b>banana</b> <b>passionfruit</b> and gorse can take over from indigenous species. Finally grazing by goats and possums can eradicate others such as kamahi, kaikawaka (Libocedrus bidwillii) and mountain tōtara. Therefore, smaller islands off the coast of Wellington have been used as a refuge for North Island birds and reptiles whose habitats may be threatened now or in the future.|$|E

40|$|<b>Banana</b> <b>passionfruit</b> (Passiflora mollissima) is a noxious weedy vine that is {{problematic}} in coastal regions throughout New Zealand. I investigated the pollination and dispersal mutualisms that facilitate its spread, in the Marlborough Sounds. Flower observations revealed that visits were almost exclusively from introduced honey bees and bumble bees, indicating an invasive mutualism. I investigated the pollination system of <b>banana</b> <b>passionfruit</b> by comparing fruit set, fruit size, seed set, germination {{success and the}} effects of inbreeding depression on seedlings when grown in competition, between hand-selfed, handcrossed, bagged and open flowers. Fruit set was significantly reduced when pollinators were excluded (3. 0 %) indicating reliance on pollinators for reproduction. While <b>banana</b> <b>passionfruit</b> is partially selfcompatible, fruit set was significantly reduced in selfed flowers (17. 5 %) compared to crossed flowers (29. 5 %), and we found significant pollen limitation (natural [18. 0 %] was significantly lower than crossed). A significant degree of inbreeding depression was apparent in germination success but not in fruit size, seed set or seedling growth and survival. Surprisingly, open flowers had significantly lower germination success (10. 1 %) than the other three treatments (crossed = 16. 5 %, selfed = 15. 0 %, bagged = 25. 3 %). Overall, natural flowers produce more seedlings per flower (1. 7) than bagged flowers (0. 9), but less than hand-selfed (3. 0) and crossed (5. 3) flowers. To investigate dependence on dispersal, germination success was compared between hand-cleaned seeds, fleshy seeds and intact fruits in the field and glasshouse. Seeds germinated readily in all treatments, with no significant difference between cleaned and fleshy seeds, so seeds do not require frugivore handling to germinate. In the field, tagged fruits were removed quickly after ripening. Significantly fewer fruit were wholly removed from off-road locations than locations on road edges, but removal rate was high in both cases (93 % and 70 %) indicating dispersal by both humans and wild animals. I found no evidence of dispersal by birds. Infra-red camera evidence revealed possums and rats consuming fruits in the field. In addition, 2818 seeds were extracted from 1. 5 kg of pig excrement collected from Te Weu Weu Bay in February 2006. Seeds readily germinated following extraction from pig and possum droppings with a final germination success, in the glasshouse, of 45. 6 % and 53 % respectively.

40|$|Abstract: <b>Banana</b> <b>passionfruit</b> (Passiflora tripartita var. mollissima) is a noxious vine that is {{invasive}} {{in forest}} patches in coastal regions throughout New Zealand. We investigated the dispersal mechanisms that facilitate its {{spread in the}} Marlborough Sounds. To find out which animals act as dispersers, we monitored tagged fruits in the field. Fruits were removed quickly after ripening. Significantly fewer fruits were wholly removed from off-road locations than locations on road edges, but removal was high in both cases (70 % and 93 % respectively) indicating likely dispersal by both humans and wild animals. We {{found no evidence of}} dispersal by birds, but infrared cameras documented possums and rats consuming fruits in the field. To investigate the effect of fruit handling on germination, we compared germination success between hand-cleaned seeds, fleshy seeds and intact fruits in the field and glasshouse. Seeds germinated readily in all treatments, with no significant difference between treatments, so seeds do not require frugivore handling to germinate. In addition, we measured the germination of seeds extracted from 1. 5 kg of feral pig faeces collected from Sus scrofa at Te Weuweu Bay and from faeces from captive possums (Trichosurus vulpecula) and Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus). Seeds extracted from pig and possum droppings readily germinated, with final germination success not significantly different from hand-cleaned or in-flesh seeds. None of the few intact seeds excreted by Norway rats germinated. <b>Banana</b> <b>passionfruit</b> has formed invasive mutualisms for both pollination (with introduced bees) and dispersal (with introduced mammals), exacerbating its spread. Weed management should combine direct weed control with limiting the spread of <b>banana</b> <b>passionfruit,</b> by managing feral pigs and possums...|$|E
40|$|Dasiops spp. are {{the most}} {{important}} pest in cultivated Passiflora plants. Larvae of these fruit flies are herbivores, feeding on flower buds and fruit of yellow passionfruit, sweet granadilla, <b>banana</b> <b>passionfruit</b> and purple passionfruit crops located in Cundinamarca and Boyaca, Colombia. Geographic distribution, natural abundance and percentage of parasitoidism for every Dasiops species by each plant species were determined. Aganaspis pelleranoi (Hymenoptera: Figitidae) was found to be a parasitoid of D. inedulis (14. 19 - 50. 00 %), infesting flower buds of yellow passionfruit and fruit of sweet granadilla (7. 41 %). Microcrasis sp. (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) was found to be parasitizing both D. gracilis (0. 83 - 3. 13 %) and D. inedulis (0. 83 %) in purple and yellow passionfruit. Trichopria sp. and Pentapria sp. (Hymenoptera: Diapriidae) were found to be parasitizing D. inedulis (40. 00 % and 4. 17 - 20. 00 %, respectively) and D. gracilis (1. 69 - 22. 22 % and 1. 67 - 29. 17 %, respectively) in purple passion fruit. Dasiops caustonae was found to be infesting <b>banana</b> <b>passionfruit</b> only in Boyaca, naturally parasitized by Pentapria sp. (11. 11 - 33. 33 %). Because Pentapria sp. had a wide geographical distribution as an idiobiont of Dasiops spp. pupae, in all of the assessed cultivated Passiflora species, despite a high selection pressure by chemical control distributed at regular calendar intervals, it would be a crucial strategy in pest management control. Collecting fallen flower buds and fruit infested by Dasiops spp. is important to truncate the life cycle of fruit flies and allow emergence of parasitoids. This simple cultural strategy could have important implications in reducing production costs, increased crop yields and environmental care...|$|E
