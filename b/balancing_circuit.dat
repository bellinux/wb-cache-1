50|$|Typically, the {{individual}} cells in a battery have somewhat different capacities {{and may be}} {{at different levels of}} state of charge (SOC). This is due to manufacturing variances, assembly variances (eg, cells from one production run mixed others), different histories experienced amongst the cells in a battery pack (eg, charging/discharging, heat exposures, etc) and must be accounted for to maximize life and service of the particular battery pack in use. Each battery pack will be, for these reasons, somewhat different and so every <b>balancing</b> <b>circuit</b> must be able to accommodate those differences. Without effective and appropriate balancing, discharging during use must stop when the cell with the lowest capacity is empty (even though other cells aren't); this limits the energy that can be taken from and returned to the battery.|$|E

Design: Cost-effectiveness study {{embedded within a}} randomised controlled trial with concealed allocation, assessor blinding and intention-to-treat analysis.

Intervention: The experimental group received a 1 -hour standing <b>balance</b> <b>circuit</b> class, delivered {{three times a week}} for 2 weeks, in addition to usual therapy. The circuit classes were supervised by one physiotherapist and one physiotherapy assistant for up to eight patients. The control group received usual therapy alone. Outcome measures: Costs were estimated from routinely collected hospital use data in the 3 months after randomisation. The functional outcome measure was mobility measured at 3 months using the Short Physical Performance Battery administered by a blinded assessor. An incremental analysis was conducted and the joint probability distribution of costs and outcomes was examined using bootstrapping. Results: The median cost savings for the intervention group was AUD 4, 741 (95 % CI 137 to 9, 372) per participant; 94 % of bootstraps showed that the intervention was both effective and cost saving.
