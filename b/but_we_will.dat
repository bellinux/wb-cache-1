25|$|A similar defense {{comes from}} Australian philosopher Frank Jackson (born 1943) who revived {{the theory of}} epiphenomenalism which argues that mental states do not {{play a role in}} {{physical}} states. Jackson argues that {{there are two kinds of}} dualism. The first is substance dualism that assumes there is second, non-corporeal form of reality. In this form, body and soul are two different substances. The second form is property dualism that says that body and soul are different properties of the same body. He claims that functions of the mind/soul are internal, very private experiences that are not accessible to observation by others, and therefore not accessible by science (at least not yet). We can know everything, for example, about a bat's facility for echolocation, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> never know how the bat experiences that phenomenon.|$|E
25|$|After the 1965 India-Pakistan War, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Foreign {{minister}} at that time, began {{to lobby for}} a nuclear weapons option. 'If India builds the bomb, we will eat grass or leaves, even go hungry, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> get one of our own. We have no other choice'. 'In October 1965, Bhutto visited Vienna to attend the International Atomic Energy Agency meeting. While there, he met with Munir Ahmad Khan, and other Pakistani scientists working at IAEA. Pakistani IAEA scientists briefed Bhutto on the rapid development of Indian nuclear programme. According to Munir Ahmad Khan, the nuclear facility at Trombay consisted of a plutonium production reactor, a reprocessing plant, and other facilities associated to weapon production. Bhutto quickly arranged a meeting with Ayub Khan. After this meeting, Ayub Khan remained unconvinced, and rejected the proposal made by Munir Ahmad Khan. Khan notified Bhutto immediately and told him about what had happened.|$|E

500|$|The 2010 {{election}} returned Viktor Yanukovych to {{the presidency}} and marked a turnaround in Ukraine's relations with NATO. In February 2010, he stated that Ukraine's relations with NATO were currently [...] "well-defined", {{and that there was}} [...] "no question of Ukraine joining NATO". He said the issue of Ukrainian membership of NATO might [...] "emerge at some point, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> not see it in the immediate future."

[...] However, {{at the time of}} the choice of the final 23-man Italian squad for the World Cup, the Italy coach excluded the Roma striker, preferring to focus the team around younger players. Some in the media criticised the decision, such as former Brazilian international footballer Cafu, who had been Totti's teammate at Roma, who revealed that he would have liked to see Totti competing for Italy at the World Cup in Brazil, and that he preferred the Roma captain over Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi. Without Totti, Italy was eliminated in the first round for the second consecutive time, finishing third in their group.|$|E

500|$|McClellan's first {{military}} operations were {{to occupy the}} area of western Virginia that wanted {{to remain in the}} Union and subsequently became the state of West Virginia. He had received intelligence reports on May 26 that the critical Baltimore and Ohio Railroad bridges in that portion of the state were being burned. As he quickly implemented plans to invade the region, he triggered his first serious political controversy by proclaiming to the citizens there that his forces had no intentions of interfering with personal property—including slaves. [...] "Notwithstanding all that has been said by the traitors to induce you to believe that our advent among you will be signalized by interference with your slaves, understand one thing clearly—not only will we abstain from all such interference <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> on the contrary with an iron hand, crush any attempted insurrection on their part." [...] He quickly realized that he had overstepped his bounds and apologized by letter to President Lincoln. The controversy was not that his proclamation was diametrically opposed to the administration's policy at the time, but that he was so bold in stepping beyond his strictly military role.|$|E

500|$|Benfica ended March {{with their}} {{objectives}} intact, so April became a crucial month. After a ten-day international break, Benfica resumed {{competition with the}} Clássico at home against Porto on 1 April. The visitors scored first through Pepe in the 41st minute, but Benfica equalized in the 83rd minute with an own-goal from Lucho González. Santos attributed the draw to Porto goalkeeper Helton's performance, saying, [...] "Helton made three or four great saves. We were better {{in the second half}} and we deserved to win." [...] On the following Thursday, Benfica visited the Olímpic de Montjuïc to face Espanyol. The Spaniards pushed hard from early on and scored first through Raúl Tamudo in the 15th minute; shortly after the half-hour mark, Albert Riera made it 2–0 and in the second half, Walter Pandiani added a third goal. Benfica reacted; Nuno Gomes scored to make the score 3–1 in the 63rd minute. Two minutes later, Simão scored Benfica's second goal and the match ended in a 3–2 loss. Santos blamed the poor first half for the loss, saying, [...] "Like with Porto, we were lost in the first half, and let our opponent play." [...] On 9 April, Benfica played Beira-Mar at the Estádio Municipal de Aveiro. Beira-Mar surprised Benfica and imposed on them a 2–2 draw in a match that Santos had labelled [...] "title deciding". Santos accepted the result and commented, [...] "We have to think in Thursday match, because our game today was bad. Beira-Mar had a lot of merit. The title is now harder <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> not renounce it." [...] On 12 April, Benfica received Espanyol for the second leg of the quarter-finals. A slow first half contrasted with a high-pressure second, in which the woodwork and Gorka Iraizoz helped Espanyol defend the goalless draw, allowing Espanyol to proceed to the semi-finals.|$|E
