500|$|Hopemead State Park is {{currently}} undeveloped 70 acre {{park on the}} eastern shore of the lake. The land was originally Solomon Gardner's farm until it was purchased as a summer getaway <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fuller</b> family. <b>The</b> property was named Camp Charmarlou, an acronym from Fuller's three daughters, and contained a house and an artist's studio. Camp Charmarlou was used a boys camp {{for a number of years}} with permission <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fuller</b> family. It was later renamed Hopemead, literally [...] "Hope Meadow", <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fuller</b> daughters who believed it to be a sanctuary with spiritual overtones. In 1954, the land was donated to the State of Connecticut to become a state park. The state found the land is unsuitable for development and demolished the dilapidated buildings, with the intention of letting Hopemead return to a natural state. Joseph Leary notes that the wildlife has thrived in the area, but notes that the cacophony of noises and calls is simply [...] "divine". The park offers opportunities for hiking and fishing.|$|R
5|$|Above the chromosphere, {{in a thin}} (about 200km) {{transition}} region, {{the temperature}} rises rapidly from around 20,000 K in the upper chromosphere to coronal temperatures closer to 1,000,000 K. The temperature increase is facilitated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>full</b> ionization of helium in the transition region, which significantly reduces radiative cooling of the plasma. The transition region does not occur at a well-defined altitude. Rather, it forms a kind of nimbus around chromospheric features such as spicules and filaments, and is in constant, chaotic motion. The transition region is not easily visible from Earth's surface, but is readily observable from space by instruments sensitive to the extreme ultraviolet portion of the spectrum.|$|E
5|$|Cranston {{was given}} the harshest penalty of all five senators. In November 1991, the Senate Ethics Committee voted {{unanimously}} to reprimand Cranston, instead of the more severe measure that was under consideration: censure <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>full</b> Senate. Extenuating circumstances that helped to save Cranston from censure included {{the fact that he}} was suffering from cancer, and that he had decided to not seek reelection, according to Heflin. The Ethics Committee took the unusual step of delivering its reprimand to Cranston during a formal session of the full Senate, with almost all 100 Senators present.|$|E
5|$|In 1893, the {{executive}} committee of the Berlin city council proposed a site {{on the banks of}} the river Spree, roughly corresponding to the current location of the Berlin Finance Department and the offices of the Social Association of Germany. The proposal was rejected <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>full</b> city council because it would overshadow the city hall. Further proposals were put on hold for several years. After discussing many locations, in 1898, chief of construction Ludwig Hoffmann became involved and the council agreed on Molkenmarkt. The 32 built-up parcels of land on the site were bought up and cleared.|$|E

5|$|In April 1916 a German battlecruiser {{squadron}} with accompanying cruisers and destroyers bombarded {{the coastal}} ports of Yarmouth and Lowestoft. Although the ports had some military importance, the main {{aim of the}} raid was to entice out defending ships which could then be picked off either by the battlecruiser squadron or <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>full</b> High Seas Fleet, which was stationed at sea ready to intervene if an opportunity presented itself. The result was inconclusive: nearby Royal Navy units were too small to intervene so largely kept clear of the German battlecruisers, and the German ships withdrew before the first British fast response battlecruiser squadron or the Grand Fleet could arrive.|$|E

The roadway crosses Minges Creek north of the I-94 interchange. To {{the west of the}} freeway are residential subdivisions; the eastern side is marked by gently-rolling, wooded terrain. This section of I-194 carries 26,300vehicles on an average day according to annual average daily traffic surveys done by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) in 2007. Of these vehicles, 1,200trucks were included in the totals.|$|E

5|$|Pritzker was {{nominated}} as United States Secretary of Commerce by President Barack Obama on May2, 2013. To avoid conflicts of interest, Pritzker {{agreed to sell}} her interest in at least 221 companies and resign from 158 entities, including the Hyatt Board of Directors and the Chicago Board of Education. Later that month, on May23, the Senate held its confirmation hearing, which covered a variety of topics. Although Pritzker's family business dealings had been a target of Republican criticism when Obama announced her nomination, only three questions at the hearing related to her family. Pritzker was confirmed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>full</b> Senate on June25, {{by a vote of}} 97 to 1. Pritzker was sworn in as Secretary on June26, 2013.|$|E
5|$|The altos and tenors {{are joined}} after seven bars by the fugue {{subject in the}} soprano voice. After a further seven bars the basses sing the last {{statement}} of the subject, accompanied <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>full</b> orchestra playing colla parte except for the two alto recorders, bringing the first fugato section to a close. The alto recorders play fragmented quaver figures in unison {{some of which are}} derived from the angular three-note continuo motif, leading into the first seven bar homophonic choral passage.|$|E

5|$|Lara then {{requested}} a rehearing en banc <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>full</b> court. The request was granted, {{and the full}} court reversed {{the decision of the}} three-judge panel, ordering that the federal indictment be dismissed on the grounds of double jeopardy. While the court noted that the Fifth Amendment allowed prosecution by two separate sovereigns, such as the federal government and a state government, it found that an Indian tribe derived its authority to prosecute offenders from the ICRA, which was federal law. The court noted that in previous Supreme Court rulings, the determination of tribal jurisdiction was based on the tribal membership of the individual, not on his race as an Indian. This meant that double jeopardy attached. The United States then appealed to the Supreme Court, which granted certiorari to hear the case.|$|E
5|$|Sherman {{was elected}} in 1892 to a sixth term, easily {{defeating}} the Democratic candidate in the state legislature. The more difficult fight had been for the Republican caucus's vote, as many preferred Foraker to Sherman. With assistance from Cleveland businessman Mark Hanna, and after four days of balloting, the caucus agreed to support Sherman over Foraker, and he was reelected <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>full</b> legislature on January 12, 1893. In 1894, Sherman surpassed Thomas Hart Benton's record for longest tenure in the Senate. His memoirs, Recollections of Forty Years in the House, Senate and Cabinet, were published the following year. In 1896 he gave speeches on behalf of fellow Ohioan William McKinley in his campaign for the presidency, but took a lesser role than in previous campaigns because of his advanced age. McKinley was elected over Democrat William Jennings Bryan. Wishing to see the appointment of Hanna, his friend and political manager, to the Senate, McKinley created a vacancy by appointing Sherman to his cabinet as Secretary of State.|$|E
5|$|The cantata BWV 39 is in two parts, {{conforming}} {{to the structure}} of the Meiningen series. The first part begins with a long choral movement for four-part chorus and full orchestra. It is followed by a recitative for bass and an aria for alto, with obbligato violin and oboe. The second part begins with the central movement based on the New Testament text, a solo for bass, as vox Christi, accompanied by an obbligato violoncello. It is followed by an aria for soprano with obbligato recorders in unison. The second recitative for alto and strings leads into the concluding four-part chorale in which the choir doubled <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>full</b> orchestra. The complex scoring of the monumental opening movement, employing full orchestra and chorus, contrasts with that of the succeeding non-choral movements, which are accompanied by smaller more intimate groups of instruments.|$|E
