5000|$|Standard Fruit Company (now Dole Food Company) was {{established}} in the United States in 1924 by the Vaccaro brothers. Its forerunner was started in 1899, when Sicilian immigrants Joseph, Luca and Felix Vaccaro, together with Salvador D'Antoni, began importing bananas to New Orleans from La Ceiba, Honduras. By 1915 the business had grown so large that it bought most of the ice factories in New Orleans in order to refrigerate its <b>banana</b> <b>ships,</b> leading to its president Joseph Vaccaro becoming known as the [...] "Ice King".|$|R

Her length is 268 ft and breadth 44 ft. Accommodation was provided for 80 passengers. She entered service in October 1955 and was operated by Glasgow Corporation to transport treated sewage sludge down the Clyde to be dumped at sea. She and her sister shps were jocularly known as Clyde banana boats as the livery resembled that of a well known <b>banana</b> <b>shipping</b> company.|$|R

5000|$|Rita's {{mother is}} a city fox living in Copenhagen. Rita first {{mentions}} her to Hugo during their encounter at the zoo, explaining that she hunts food for the family during the night, although it seems she rarely finds enough as Rita says she is always hungry. Rita describes her as [...] "real tough" [...] and implies she has regularly fought and killed the city's stray cats. The hunt leaves her exhausted and she spends most of the daytime in the den. She strongly disapproves of Rita's night-time adventures but can do little to dissuade her. Experienced but somewhat cold, she initially refuses to harbour Hugo when Rita brings him home, stating that the den is already crowded, but Rita's pleading leads her to relent and she lets him stay for the day. She catches the two before they set off for the <b>banana</b> <b>ship</b> that evening, offering to take Hugo to the docks herself and ordering Rita to stay and look after her siblings. As they enter the industrial park they are pursued {{by one of the}} bounty hunters; fearing for her own safety she abandons Hugo before they reach the harbour, giving him vague directions before fleeing the area. Rita's mother makes two brief appearances in Jungledyret 2. She doubts Hugo will ever return to Copenhagen and tells Rita to forget about him, while she goes out to hunt for food. She is not referenced in later media. She was voiced by Helle Ryslinge in Danish and Sonja Ball in the English dub.|$|E

50|$|The Chatsworth <b>bananas</b> were <b>shipped</b> off {{to various}} {{places in the}} Pacific around the 1850s. It is {{believed}} {{that some of them}} may have ended up in the Canary Islands, though other authors believe that the bananas in the Canary Islands had been there since the fifteenth century and had been introduced through other means, namely by early Portuguese explorers who obtained them from West Africa and were later responsible for spreading them to the Caribbean. African bananas in turn were introduced from Southeast Asia into Madagascar by early Austronesian sailors. In 1888, bananas from the Canary Islands were imported into England by Thomas Fyffe. These bananas are now known to belong the Dwarf Cavendish cultivar.|$|R
50|$|Machala is a {{commercial}} {{center for the}} surrounding agriculture industries. There is a large trade in bananas, coffee and cocoa. The banana industry is especially oriented for exportation, and plays a huge role in the city's economy. <b>Bananas</b> are <b>shipped</b> out from nearby Puerto Bolívar mainly to North America. Machala's geographical position near Guayaquil also makes it an important transportation center. Many travelers heading south to Peru or north to Guayaquil funnel through the city. It is not known as a tourist destination among Ecuadorians or international tourists, though its proximity to the Pacific Ocean positions it close to beaches. Machala has a growing economy that was marked in 2007 by the inauguration of its first mall, with a movie theater, {{on the outskirts of}} the city.|$|R

50|$|Michael Levin {{started with}} a {{pushcart}} in 1906 and had his first location in a one-room cellar at 315 S. 2nd Street. In a few years he was buying bananas in larger quantities and selling wholesale. He ripened bananas in cellars he rented around Dock Street. In the 1920s, Michael Levin had grown his banana distribution {{so much that the}} Atlantic Fruit Company, a major banana supplier at the time, turned over its Philadelphia banana-ripening business to Levin. The ripening deal helped cement M. Levin's place in the banana-ripening world. During World War II, banana shipments stopped to the port in Philadelphia and all U.S. ports except those in Florida. Michael Levin went to Florida where he purchased <b>bananas</b> and <b>shipped</b> them by rail to Philadelphia. The company controlled banana distribution on the East Coast including New York, Pittsburgh, and Washington. After the War, Levin landed a contract to supply Acme Markets with all of its bananas, and would come to supply Food Fair, A&P, and Penn Fruit stores.|$|R

40|$|This report {{focuses on}} how delays are handled by a {{specific}} container shipping company on their Rotterdam-loop with import of bananas into port of Oslo. The {{company has a}} banana-importer in Oslo that imports around 810 - 1240 tons of bananas per week. Bananas are an extremely time-sensitive fruit, which means that if a delay occurs the bananas can get damaged or die. The <b>bananas</b> are <b>shipped</b> in refrigerated-containers under a low temperature {{to be able to}} transport them over long distances. The bananas come with an oceanvessel to the port of Rotterdam where they are transshipped to a feedervessel that takes them to port of Oslo. The report's focus on how the shipping company handles delays, and how the delays affect the relationship between the shipping company and their banana-importer. Collection of information has largely been done through interviews from the container shipping company, banana-importer and observation in port of Oslo including interviews with port representatives. It has also used literature to get a credible theory and to compare the theory with the results. The banana-importer forwards their bananas to its customers and relies on the shipping company that they can deliver bananas to the port Oslo in time. The shipping company has used several measures to reduce the delay time by removing one or two terminals in Rotterdam port, leave goods in the port of Rotterdam to reduce loading and unloading time or transport the banana refrigerated-containers through a third party feeder. The feedervessel always awaits the oceanvessel when it is delayed to port. Most of those interviewed from the shipping company agreed that they would need an overall role that has more knowledge and experience on specific routes to help the company's employees to understand everyone's work is important and that they should not only focus on their own work. In order to optimize the shipping company, they need to collaborate and communicate better...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} contains three {{essays on}} the relationship between the spatial distribution of economic activity and different types of public goods. In the first essay, I study how changes in transport infrastructure affect the location decisions of firms by examining how manufacturers responded to changes in road quality in Indonesia. Using new data, I document massive upgrades to Indonesia's highway networks during the 1990 s, a period in which national transportation funding increased by 83 percent. I first show that these road improvements were accompanied by a significant dispersion of manufacturing activity, and that different industries responded in ways predicted by theory. To make better counterfactual predictions, I develop a structural model of location choice in which firms face a trade off: locating closer to demand sources requires firms to pay higher factor prices. The model predicts that some location characteristics relevant to firms are determined in equilibrium, necessitating the use of instrumental variables. I estimate a random coefficients logit model with endogenous choice characteristics and find significant differences in firms' willingness to pay for greater market access across different industrial sectors. Counterfactual policy simulations suggest that new toll roads connecting urban areas would cause a modest amount of industrial suburbanization. In contrast, upgrading rural roads would have little or no effect on equilibrium firm locations. In the second essay, co-authored with Bryan Graham, we provide estimates of the implicit prices that consumers and firms pay for access to infrastructure in Honduras. Without credible estimates of the welfare effects of infrastructure improvements, it is impossible for policymakers to know whether the benefits of these investments outweigh their substantial costs. A major challenge with trying to understanding the welfare consequences of improved transport infrastructure is an identification problem: transport improvements are never randomly assigned. We overcome this identification program by exploiting variation from a novel natural experiment: Honduras' infestation with Panama disease. The Honduran railroad network was constructed by fruit companies to <b>ship</b> <b>bananas</b> from plantations to port cities, but because of an unpredictable outbreak of Panama disease, major plantations and their associated railway infrastructure were abandoned. We argue that outbreaks of Panama disease were extremely difficult to predict, and because of this, conditional on the railway network that existed in the 1930 s and a host of observable characteristics, the areas where railway lines were abandoned were randomly assigned. We use our identification strategy to uncover the implicit prices of access to infrastructure paid by consumers and the implicit production costs paid by firms. In the third essay, co-authored with Rachel Glennerster and Edward Miguel, we study how spatial variation in ethnic diversity, which exists largely for historical reasons, affects the provision of local public goods in rural Sierra Leone. Scholars have pointed to ethnic divisions as a leading cause of underdevelopment, due in part to their adverse effects on public goods. We investigate this issue in post-war Sierra Leone, one of the world's poorest countries. To address concerns over endogenous local ethnic composition, we use an instrumental variables strategy relying on historical census data on ethnic composition. We find that local diversity is not associated with worse public goods provision across a variety of outcomes, specifications, and diversity measures, with precisely estimated zeros. We investigate the role that leading mechanisms proposed in the literature play in generating the findings...|$|R
