During processing and servicing, the composite materials undergoes delamination, and petalling.

40|$|It {{is known}} that fiber metal {{laminates}} (FML) as one of hybrid materials with thin metal sheets and fiber/epoxy layers have {{the characteristics of the}} excellent damage tolerance, fatigue and impact properties with a relatively low density. Therefore, the mechanical components using FML can contribute the enhanced safety level of the sound construction toward the whole body. In the present study, the impact performance of glass fibers reinforced aluminum laminates (GFRAL) is investigated by experiments and numerical simulations. Impact tests are carried out with the <b>blunt</b> and conical <b>nose</b> projectiles of mass 29 g within sub ordnance velocity range (50 - 150 m/s). Two different thicknesses viz. 2. 6 mm and 3. 1 mm are impacted. Dynamic non-linear transient analyses are also accomplished using finite element analysis software, ABAQUS. Results show higher ballistic limit for conical nose projectile compared to <b>blunt</b> <b>nose.</b> Also, failure mode in case of conical nose projectile impact is petalling with localized delamination of the GFRAL specimen. In case of <b>blunt</b> <b>nose</b> projectile impact plugs are sheared off from front (aluminium) plate and middle (GFRP) plate. One thing is common in failure modes by both conical and <b>blunt</b> <b>nose</b> projectiles, delamination of GFRP plate in itself...|$|R

40|$|When it {{was decided}} to use a laser {{velocimeter}} to measure the properties of propellers, seeding was a great concern since large particles fail to flow and small ones are too small to be seen. Many methods were tried and weeded out by using a Malvern particle sizer. The most promising ones were tested in the tunnel and the laser velocimeter (LV) measurements compared to theoretical values of veocity as the particle approached a <b>blunt</b> <b>nose</b> body along a stagnation streamline. Data obtained from the LV system were compared with the one dimensional particle lag calculation. This figure showed the theoretical velocity over the <b>blunt</b> <b>nose</b> and a velocity profile for 5 um particles. This indicated the particles were approximately 5 um. The seeding method is shown. The seed was atomized by 2 seeders run with all 12 available atomizer jets on. The atomizer seed traveled from these two seeders through four 1 inch tubes 20 feet long to the plenum chamber where this cluster of tubes injected the seed into the air stream. The tubes were located 60 feet from the model and could be moved only by shutting the tunnel down. Future seeding plans are shown...|$|R
40|$|This work {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} the aerothermodynamics of hypersonic nonequilibrium flows over <b>blunt</b> <b>nosed</b> models and space vehicles with rarefaction effects. First, the in-house Navier-Stokes solver, UNIC-UNS code, with the slip boundary condition and finite-rate chemistry is used to simulate the hypersonic flows over a <b>blunt</b> <b>nosed</b> model and the simplified European eXPErimental Re-entry Test-bed (EXPERT) model V 4. 4. Next, hypersonic flows over the whole EXPERT 3 D model, which correspond to the expected descent trajectory with allowance for rarefaction and thermochemical nonequilibrium are simulated. By comparing with the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method, it is observed that the UNIC-UNS code is reliable in simulating hypersonic flows with rarefaction and thermochemical non-equilibrium effects. A detailed analysis of the aerothermodynamics for EXPERT {{for a wide range of}} flow regimes is also provided by utilizing the numerical flow visualization. The present numerical simulations provide some important data for EXPERT, which cannot be easily derived by experiments. This study aims to work as a precursor for future studies and to provide to the scientific community with quality data that can be used to improve tools for the design of hypersonic vehicles.

40|$|The use of {{the full}} {{unsteady}} Navier-Stokes equations to solve the flow around complex three-dimensional bodies, such as the Space Shuttle Orbiter, requires {{a substantial amount of}} computer time and storage. However, if the inviscid portion of the flow is supersonic and if there is no streamwise separation, then the three-dimensional flow field can be solved using a simplified set of equations called the parabolized Navier-Stokes equations. These simplified equations are parabolic in the streamwise direction and as a result, the solution can be marched downstream from a given initial station, thereby significantly reducing the computer time;In this study, a general parabolized Navier-Stokes equation solver is developed and the supersonic viscous flow around a flat slab delta wing and the flow around the Space Shuttle Orbiter are solved. The generalized marching scheme requires initial data which are obtained by computing the flow in the <b>blunt</b> <b>nose</b> region. This region is computed for the two problems using an axisymmetric or three-dimensional unsteady Navier-Stokes solver. The use of a generalized transformation reduces the computational region required for the three-dimensional <b>blunt</b> <b>nose</b> region and this effectively reduces the computational time required to solve the flow around the <b>blunt</b> <b>nose</b> region. An algebraic grid clustering scheme, which has a potential to be developed into a grid generation scheme, clusters the grid points around the wing-tip and wing body juncture regions and describes the Space Shuttle Orbiter body shape accurately. A simple solution surface generation scheme, outlined here, allows the user to march the solution along the most appropriate direction;The numerical solutions obtained for the two problems are compared with the available experimental data. The shock shapes, pressure coefficients and heat-transfer coefficients compare well with the experimental data at various Mach numbers and angles of incidence. Also, the parabolized Navier-Stokes solver predicts the lee-side flow field very well including the location of cross flow separation and reattachment...|$|R
