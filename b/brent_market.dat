40|$|In 1990, Iraq invaded Kuwait, {{touching}} off an economic, financial, diplomatic, {{and military}} crisis {{associated with a}} tremendous spike in oil prices and recession in OECD and oil-importing developing countries. But was the Gulf Crisis a disruption? Did it affect the fabric of oil trade? To examine this question, this paper examines the changing role of international trade intermediaries (ITIs, {{often referred to as}} “trading companies”) in the oil market. ITIs connect buyers and sellers, serving as the glue that holds many commodity markets together. Oil trading companies have attracted harsh scrutiny form policymakers as a result of allegations regarding their role in the United Nations’ Iraqi Oil-for-Food Program, but minimal scholarly attention. The paper takes advantage of a unique microdatabase on the <b>Brent</b> <b>market.</b> Produced in the U. K. North Sea, Brent Blend {{is by far the most}} widely traded crude oil in the international market. Participants in the <b>Brent</b> <b>market</b> are diverse, with the largest traders falling into two categories. The first comprises “industrial MNEs”—companies active in the business of producing or refining crude oil. The second category comprises financial houses and trading companies. This diversity provides an opportunity to test hypotheses regarding behavioral differences across types of companies and geographic origin, before, during, and after the crisis. oil, trading companies, crisis, Brent, North Sea...|$|E
40|$|The {{decision}} {{to undertake a}} study of the Brent CFD (Contract for Differences) market was made for two reasons. The first is that the Institute has done major research work on the various constituents of the <b>Brent</b> <b>market</b> complex in an almost continuous manner since 1984. This led to the publication of two books, The Market for North Sea Crude Oil (1986) l and Oil Markets and Prices (1993),’ and a number of related working papers and monographs on other oil markets and trading instruments. When researching for the most recent of these two books, very little was known about the CFD market. As a result there were only some cursory references to CFDs in Oil Markets and Prices...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{investigates the}} {{conditional}} correlations and volatility spillovers between crude oil returns and stock index returns. Daily returns from 2 January 1998 to 4 November 2009 of the crude oil spot, forward and futures prices from the WTI and <b>Brent</b> <b>markets,</b> and the FTSE 100, NYSE, Dow Jones and S&P 500 index returns, are analysed using the CCC model of Bollerslev (1990), VARMA-GARCH model of Ling and McAleer (2003), VARMA-AGARCH model of McAleer, Hoti and Chan (2008), and DCC model of Engle (2002). Based on the CCC model, {{the estimates of}} conditional correlations for returns across markets are very low, and some are not statistically significant, which means the conditional shocks are correlated only in the same market and not across markets. However, the DCC estimates of the conditional correlations are always significant. This result {{makes it clear that}} the assumption of constant conditional correlations is not supported empirically. Surprisingly, the empirical results from the VARMA-GARCH and VARMA-AGARCH models provide little evidence of volatility spillovers between the crude oil and financial markets. The evidence of asymmetric effects of negative and positive shocks of equal magnitude on the conditional variances suggests that VARMA-AGARCH is superior to VARMA-GARCH an...|$|R

40|$|The <b>Brent</b> <b>market</b> is {{reputed to}} {{determine}} the price for {{about two-thirds of the}} world’s oil trade. Yet Brent is probably the least appropriately regulated commodity market in the world. The two-thirds estimate is difficult to verify because so much of what is traded takes place in the opaque over-the-counter (‘OTC’) market. Nevertheless the proportion of international oil pricing that relies on a Brent index is undeniably large and is still growing. While Brent looks set to be caught in the cross-fire of the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, particularly the Volcker Rule, the fundamental characteristics of the Brent oil market were changed in January 2012 without so much as the raising of a regulatory eyebrow. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{recent history}} of the {{informal}} market for North Sea Brent blend has been {{of great interest to}} those studying commodity markets in general and the oil market in particular. Two aspects of this market gives it this important position. First, the very rapid growth inactivity in the <b>Brent</b> <b>market</b> means that for much of 1985 an average of at least 400 deals a month were being made. With each deal being for a lot size of 600, 000 barrels of oil at around $ 25 a barrel the total turnover i n 1985 was at least $ 72 billion. The second feature of the market is that it operates as an informal forward market. There is no central clearing agency, as in a futures market, and so each deal is done directly between agents...|$|E
40|$|Estimation {{has been}} carried out using GARCH-type models, based on the Generalized Error Distribution (GED), for both the extreme {{downside}} and upside Value-at-Risks (VaR) of returns in the WTI and Brent crude oil spot markets. Furthermore, according to a new concept of Granger causality in risk, a kernel-based test is proposed to detect extreme risk spillover effect between the two oil markets. Results of an empirical study indicate that the GED-GARCH-based VaR approach appears more effective than the well-recognized HSAF (i. e. historical simulation with ARMA forecasts). Moreover, this approach is also more realistic and comprehensive than the standard normal distribution-based VaR model that is commonly used. Results reveal that there is significant two-way risk spillover effect between WTI and Brent markets. Supplementary study indicates that at the 99 % confidence level, when negative market news arises that brings about a slump in oil price return, historical information on risk in the WTI market helps to forecast the <b>Brent</b> <b>market.</b> Conversely, it is not the case when positive news occurs and returns rise. Historical information on risk in the two markets can facilitate forecasts of future extreme market risks for each other. These results are valuable for anyone who needs evaluation and forecasts of the risk situation in international crude oil markets.

40|$|This article {{examines}} the existence of threshold cointegration between futures and spot prices for the <b>Brent</b> petroleum <b>market.</b> We then estimate the asymmetric error-correction specification utilizing the Momentum Threshold Autoregressive Consistent (M-TAR-C) approach particularly proposed by Enders and Siklos (2001). We find that, for the daily data over 2 January 2001 through 15 October 2006, the petroleum futures prices are cointegrated with the spot prices. This effectively confirms the expectations hypothesis and that asymmetric adjustments for the futures basis towards the long-run value display a negative basis from the long-run equilibrium level more persistently than a positive basis from that level. The empirical result suggests that short-run arbitrages manipulating buy-long (sell-short) futures contracts be profitable when a positive basis is weakening (a negative basis is strengthening) ...|$|R

40|$|The use of {{parametric}} GARCH {{models to}} characterise crude oil price volatility is widely {{observed in the}} empirical literature.

These results are supported {{by the use of}} robust loss functions and the Hansen 2 ̆ 7 s (2005) superior predictive ability test.

50|$|The US Energy Information Administration {{attributes}} the price spread between WTI and Brent to an oversupply {{of crude oil}} {{in the interior of}} North America (WTI price is set at Cushing, Oklahoma) caused by rapidly increasing oil production from Canadian oil sands and tight oil formations such as the Bakken Formation, Niobrara Formation, and Eagle Ford Formation. Oil production in the interior of North America has exceeded the capacity of pipelines to carry it to markets on the Gulf Coast and east coast of North America; as a result, the oil price on the US and Canadian east coast and parts of the US Gulf Coast since 2011 has been set by the price of <b>Brent</b> Crude, while <b>markets</b> in the interior still follow the WTI price. Much US and Canadian crude oil from the interior is now shipped to the coast by railroad, which is much more expensive than pipeline.|$|R

In particular, {{we examine the}} validity of the cost of carry relationship in the WTI futures market, which suggests that the difference between physical and futures crude oil prices should reflect the transportation costs. We also examine whether the futures-physical oil differential contains information regarding tanker freight rate formation. Using physical crude oil prices for the <b>Brent</b> and Bonny <b>markets,</b> WTI futures prices and freight rates we find no evidence to support the existence of a relationship between tanker freight rates and physical-futures differentials in the crude oil market. This is mainly attributed to regional supply and demand imbalances and suggests that arbitrage opportunities between oil derivatives and tanker freight markets exist.

We propose {{a collection of}} marked self-exciting point processes with dependent arrival rates for extreme events in oil markets and related risk measures. The models treat the time among extreme events in oil markets as a stochastic process. The main advantage {{of this approach is}} its capability to capture the short, medium and long-term behavior of extremes without involving an arbitrary stochastic volatility model or a prefiltration of the data, as is common in extreme value theory applications. We make use of the proposed model in order to obtain an improved estimate for the Value at Risk in oil markets. Empirical findings suggest that the reliability and stability of Value at Risk estimates improve as a result of finer modeling approach.

40|$|This article aims the {{analyses}} of the causality and temporal precedence relationships between the spot and futures prices of Brent oil, those last ones inherent to financial markets.

Thus, it has been proved that there is a bias of classical GARCH models to perform better for equity markets, compared to commodity markets, but future researches can be directed towards adapting GARCH models to the commodity market.

40|$|With the {{increasing}} level of volatility in the crude oil market, the transient data feature becomes {{more prevalent in}} the market and is no longer ignorable during the risk measurement process. Since there are multiple representations for these transient data features using a set of bases available, the sparsity measure based Morphological Component Analysis (MCA) model is proposed in this paper to find the optimal combinations of representations to model these transient data features. Therefore, this paper proposes a MCA based hybrid methodology for analyzing and forecasting the risk evolution in the crude oil market. The underlying transient data components with distinct behaviors are extracted and analyzed using MCA model. The proposed algorithm incorporates these transient data features to adjust for conservative risk estimates from traditional approach based on normal market condition during its risk measurement process.

40|$|The {{price gap}} between West Texas Intermediate (WTI) and <b>Brent</b> crude oil <b>markets</b> has been {{completely}} changed {{in the past several}} years. The price of WTI was always a little larger than that of Brent for a long time. However, the price of WTI has been surpassed by that of Brent since 2011. The new market circumstances and volatility of oil price require a comprehensive re-estimation of risk. Therefore, this study aims to explore an integrated approach to assess the price risk in the two crude oil markets through the value at risk (VaR) model. The VaR is estimated by the extreme value theory (EVT) and GARCH model on the basis of generalized error distribution (GED). The results show that EVT is a powerful approach to capture the risk in the oil markets. On the contrary, the traditional variance–covariance (VC) and Monte Carlo (MC) approaches tend to overestimate risk when the confidence level is 95 %, but underestimate risk at the confidence level of 99 %. The VaR of WTI returns is larger than that of Brent returns at identical confidence levels. Moreover, the GED-GARCH model can estimate the downside dynamic VaR accurately for WTI and Brent oil returns...|$|R
40|$|Various GARCH {{models have}} been applied to the {{research}} of financial time series. For example, studies of Myers and Thompson (1989), Baillie and Myers (1991) and Lien et al. (2002), and Chang, McAleer, and Tansuchat (2011) apply GARCH models to improve the research of optimal hedge ratios. Although multivariate conditional volatility models are often employed in the measurement of minimum variance hedging strategy, they are rarely applied to the research which involves both the optimal hedge ratio and the preference of investors. This dissertation evaluate four different multivariate conditional volatility models, they are the Constant Conditional Correlations (CCC) model, the Dynamic Conditional Correlations (DCC), the BEKK model, and the Diagonal BEKK model. These models are applied to the calculation of the optimal hedge ratio and the utility based hedge ratio of Brent and WTI crude oil markets. The main aim {{of this research is}} to examine whether the performance of hedge ratios under different multivariate volatility models could be employed by investors who are not infinitely risk averse. It is concluded that the diagonal BEKK model exhibits as the best model in terms of the measurement of hedging effectiveness, and the BEKK model appears to be the worse one among the four models measured in terms of the <b>Brent</b> crude oil <b>market.</b> Moreover, estimates of the utility based hedge ratio suggest that the DCC model and the diagonal BEKK model exhibit a similar level of utility based hedge ratios in terms of the Brent and WTI crude oil data series that examined in this dissertation. However, the utility based hedging approach suffers from several limitations and the ex-post utility measure may fail to provide better insights to the selection of hedging strategies. It should be noted that there are still other multivariate GARCH models or different utility functions which can be applied in the future research of utility based optimal hedge ratios (OHRs). In addition, the method illustrated in this dissertation can not only be used in the estimation of crude oil data but also be applied to other financial series such as commodities or securities. This would be of particular interest to those who involved in the management or hedging strategies of portfolio investment and risk management...|$|R
40|$|The role of {{information}} on the markets is crucial as its purpose is to make the trade more efficient and transparent. The data are released by different sources and each market participant {{has to be able to}} sort them out and chose the ones that are more relevant for their activities. For most of the professionals, the data coming from the U. S. Government are the original and most reliable source {{of information}}. The U. S. federal shutdown of October 2013 created some fear and uncertainty in the United States but also worldwide. There was no information on the length and on the potential consequences that the closing would have on the economy. The market participants in commodities trading have been impacted by this event, as the national entities delivering data reports to the markets were closed for a period of two weeks. As a result, some categories of players active on the commodities markets were basically 'flying blind' as they did not have access to the necessary information that they usually base their trading decisions on. This report contemplates the potential impact that the closing had on the trade of crude oil and corn in October 2013. The main objective is to determine whether the markets are too dependent on the release of information coming from the Government and what this may imply in terms of risks. The analysis of the West Texas Intermediate and <b>Brent</b> crude oil <b>markets</b> established that the shutdown created some volatility on the spot markets; however, not in a significant way. Additionally, according to the findings, the futures markets of WTI have been impacted as there was less volume traded during the month of October 2013. Unfortunately, the prices of October 2013 for the futures contracts of crude oil and corn were not publicly available. As a result, only the volume traded on the futures markets were analysed. On the other hand, the corn markets did not manifest a strong impact from the U. S. Government shutdown. The spot markets showed some volatility; however, compared to other years it was not of great meaning. Throughout the interviews held for this project, many professionals from the agricultural commodities trading businesses did mention that they noticed a decrease in the global volume of contracts traded during October 2013. Nevertheless, after analysis of the amount of corn futures contracts traded, there was no evidence that there was a decrease in the numbers of commitments at this period. It may have impacted other agricultural goods but the corn markets showed no significant differences...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} decades, the energy {{industry}} has been exposed to significant changes within the world marked. The intention of this thesis has therefore been to measure and evaluate financial risk exposure for energy companies. Financial risk has been the primary subject of this thesis. This subject has further been divided into one prediction and two hypotheses encompassing the theoretical framework of this thesis; recession versus growth, financial risk and investments. The prediction and hypotheses have been evaluated by applying both quantitative and qualitative analysis. This thesis studies financial risk exposure and its influence on 16 major oil and gas companies during a 20 year time period, from February 1989 to February 2009. World market changes may provoke several changes in financial risk exposure facing energy companies. These changes could provoke higher volatility, meaning significant changes in a company’s stock price and could further revise future investment strategies. These considerations {{form the basis for}} the first prediction in this thesis; “economic recession and resulting changes in market risk factors increases the stock price volatility and changes the investment behavior for energy companies. ” The quantitative results points toward the highest volatility measurements in periods of recession. This corresponds to the qualitative analysis, as the overall responses from the depth interviews presumed the highest volatility measures in periods of recession. Based on the quantitative and qualitative results the prediction stating that “economic recession and resulting changes in the market risk factors increases the stock price volatility for energy companies” is accepted. The investment behavior was further analyzed by evaluating the reserves replacement rate and finding and development costs of each of the company represented. Neither the quantitative nor the qualitative analysis points towards periods of recession causing changes in the investment behavior for the companies analyzed, so the predicting stating changes in a company’s investment behavior as the results of periods of recession is rejected. Periods of recession and growth caused by world market changes could have dissimilar influence on an energy company’s stock price, depending on size and value of company. The subsequent hypothesis analyzed in this thesis therefore claimed that “the stock price is more influenced by market risk in periods of recession than in periods of growth”. The quantitative results show a higher relation between the market risk factors in periods of recession compared to periods of growth. From the results of the t-test, oil and gas frequently proves a significant correlation at given significance levels. This is similar to the qualitative analysis, as the financial personnel ranked oil and gas price to provide the highest influence on a company’s stock price when asked to compare this to other financial risk factors. Based on these results the hypothesis “the stock price is more influenced by market risk factors in periods of recession than in periods of growth” was accepted. The financial risk exposure facing the energy companies can be viewed by evaluating the stock price fluctuation, and further to apply models to calculate the historical expected stock return based on included risk factors. These models are used to price risk and are therefore applied to evaluate which of the presented models provides the most accurate measure of historical expected stock return compared to the actual historic stock return. These models represent the final hypothesis stated in this thesis, “increased number of financial risk factors included in a model for pricing risk, gives a more accurate predicted historical stock return”. The results show that <b>Brent</b> oil price, <b>market</b> cap and book-to-market ratio each {{have a significant impact on}} the historic stock price return for {{the energy industry}}. Considering the calculation of expected historical stock return based on the included systematic and unsystematic risk factors, the APT multifactor model provides the most accurate model to explain historical expected stock return. The APT model incorporated the following systematic risk factors: interest rate, market index, exchange rate, oil price and gas price. These could therefore be considered as the most important risk factors for predicting historical stock return. Based on the yearly analysis, increased number of financial risk factors does not necessarily give more accurate predicted stock return. However, if considering the monthly analysis, increased number of financial risk factors did actually give a more accurate predicted stock return...|$|R
