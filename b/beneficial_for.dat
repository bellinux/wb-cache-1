5|$|The Bundled Measures Policy authorizes {{different}} factions {{within the}} state to collaborate on mitigation projects. This policy takes a more of a community-based approach by adding several groups {{for the purpose of}} multiple perspectives and inventive approaches. The Bundled Measures Policy is one method that generates co-benefits for both parties. In example, if a partaking business were to add cool roofs, there will be a reduction in greenhouse gases which is <b>beneficial</b> <b>for</b> the environment as well as the need for excess energy which is <b>beneficial</b> <b>for</b> the business.|$|E

5|$|A {{field study}} in Brisbane found that F. rubiginosa trees often bore {{both male and}} female phase syconia at the same time, which could be <b>beneficial</b> <b>for</b> {{reproduction}} in isolated populations. The same study found that male phase syconia development persisted through the winter, showing that its wasp pollinator tolerated cooler weather than those of more tropical fig species. F. rubiginosa itself can endure cooler climates than other members of the genus.|$|E
5|$|A study {{conducted}} by a United States child psychiatrist, Dr Kyle D. Pruett, found that infants between 7 and 30 months responded more favorably to being picked up by their fathers. Pruett also found that a father's parenting style is <b>beneficial</b> <b>for</b> a child's physical, cognitive, emotional and behavioral development. Mothers reassure toddlers when they become frustrated while fathers encourage them to manage their frustration. This helps the children {{learn to deal with}} stress and frustration. A long-term study Pruett conducted proved that a father's active involvement with his children, from birth to adolescence, promotes greater emotional balance, stronger curiosity and a stronger sense of self-assurance in the child.|$|E

5|$|Aposematism (from Greek ἀπό apo away, σῆμα sema sign) was a {{new term}} coined by Edward Bagnall Poulton for Alfred Russel Wallace's concept of warning coloration. It {{describes}} a family of antipredator adaptations in which a warning signal {{is associated with the}} unprofitability of a prey item to potential predators. Aposematism always involves an advertising signal. The warning signal may take the form of conspicuous animal coloration, sounds, odours or other perceivable characteristics. Aposematic signals are <b>beneficial</b> <b>for</b> both the predator and prey, since both avoid potential harm.|$|E
5|$|Exercise {{appears to}} be useful for {{preventing}} low back pain. Exercise is also probably effective in preventing recurrences in those with pain that has lasted more than six weeks. Medium-firm mattresses are more <b>beneficial</b> <b>for</b> chronic pain than firm mattresses. There is little to no evidence that back belts are any more helpful in preventing low back pain than education about proper lifting techniques. Shoe insoles do not help prevent low back pain.|$|E
5|$|Fluorine is not {{essential}} for humans or other mammals; small amounts may be <b>beneficial</b> <b>for</b> bone strength, but {{this has not been}} definitively established. As there are many environmental sources of trace fluorine, the possibility of a fluorine deficiency could apply only to artificial diets. Natural organofluorines have been found in microorganisms and plants but not animals. The most common is fluoroacetate, which is used as a defense against herbivores by at least 40 plants in Africa, Australia and Brazil. Other examples include terminally fluorinated fatty acids, fluoroacetone, and 2-fluorocitrate. An enzyme that binds fluorine to carbon – adenosyl-fluoride synthase – was discovered in bacteria in 2002.|$|E

5|$|Historically, {{individuals}} with MS were advised against participation {{in physical activity}} due to worsening symptoms. However, {{under the direction of}} an expert, participation in physical activity can be safe and has been proven <b>beneficial</b> <b>for</b> persons with MS. Research has supported the rehabilitative role of physical activity in improving muscle power, mobility, mood, bowel health, general conditioning and quality of life. Depending on the person, activities may include resistance training, walking, swimming, yoga, tai chi, and others. Determining an appropriate and safe exercise program is challenging and must be carefully individualized to each person being sure to account for all contraindications and precautions.|$|E

After being stuck with an under-performing team {{the last six}} years, he now was paired with the young Lew Alcindor, who would years later become the all-time NBA scoring leader as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. With Alcindor in the low post and Robertson running the backcourt, the Bucks charged to a league-best 66–16 record, {{including}} a then-record 20-game win streak, a dominating 12–2 record in the playoffs, and crowned their season with the NBA title by sweeping the Baltimore Bullets 4–0 in the 1971 NBA Finals. For {{the first time in}} his career, Robertson had won an NBA championship.|$|E
5|$|Killed by bushfire, Grevillea juniperina regenerates {{afterwards}} by {{seeds that}} germinate after lying dormant in the soil, stimulated {{by exposure to}} heat and smoke. Plants over 1m (3ft) high produce more seed. Intervals of 10 to 15 years between fires {{are thought to be}} most <b>beneficial</b> <b>for</b> the species' survival, as this allows seed numbers to build up in the soil over time. Grevillea juniperina can also colonise disturbed areas, though overgrowth of Bursaria spinosa can negatively impact its spread.|$|E

5|$|More {{recent studies}} however suggest that Eutharic's Amali ancestry {{may have been}} a {{deliberate}} invention on the part of Theoderic to aid his ambitions of establishing dynastic credibility. According to Gesta Theoderici Eutharic belonged to the Gothic house of Alan rather than the house of Amal. Whilst Jordanes, in his history of the Goths, does make reference to Eutharic's prudentia et virtus, or pride and valour, this too {{may have been a}} fabrication on the part of Theoderic. Those qualities were recognised as requirements of Gothic ethnographic ideology, expressed in their code of civilitas. It would have been highly <b>beneficial</b> <b>for</b> Theoderic's chosen son-in-law to possess them.|$|E
5|$|Other {{antioxidants}} are not {{obtained from}} the diet, but instead {{are made in the}} body. For example, ubiquinol (coenzyme Q) is poorly absorbed from the gut and is made through the mevalonate pathway. Another example is glutathione, which is made from amino acids. As any glutathione in the gut is broken down to free cysteine, glycine and glutamic acid before being absorbed, even large oral intake has little effect on the concentration of glutathione in the body. Although large amounts of sulfur-containing amino acids such as acetylcysteine can increase glutathione, no evidence exists that eating high levels of these glutathione precursors is <b>beneficial</b> <b>for</b> healthy adults.|$|E
