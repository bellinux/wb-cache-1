50|$|One future {{direction}} {{theories on}} <b>bilingual</b> <b>word</b> <b>recognition</b> should take is {{the investigation of}} developmental aspects of bilingual lexical access. Most studies have investigated highly proficient bilinguals, but not many have looked at low-proficient bilinguals or even L2 learners. This new direction should prove to {{bring a lot of}} educational applications.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} investigates how {{semantic}} constraint {{of a sentence}} context modulates language-nonselective activation in bilingual visual word recognition. We recorded Dutch-English bilinguals’ eye movements while they read cognates and controls in low and high semantically constraining sentences in their second language. Early and late eye movement measures yielded cognate facilitation, both for low- and high-constraint sentences. Facilitation increased gradually {{as a function of}} cross-lingual overlap between translation equivalents. A control experiment showed that the same stimuli did not yield cognate effects in English monolingual controls, ensuring that these effects were not due to any uncontrolled stimulus characteristics. The present study supports models of <b>bilingual</b> <b>word</b> <b>recognition</b> with a limited role for top-down influences of semantic constraints on lexical access in both early and later stages of <b>bilingual</b> <b>word</b> <b>recognition...</b>|$|E
40|$|Until now, {{research}} on <b>bilingual</b> auditory <b>word</b> <b>recognition</b> has been scarce, and although most studies agree that lexical access is language-nonselective, {{there is less}} consensus {{with respect to the}} influence of potentially constraining factors. The present study investigated the influence of three possible constraints. We tested whether language nonselectivity is restricted by (a) a sentence context in a second language (L 2), (b) the semantic constraint of the sentence, and (c) the native language of the speaker. Dutch-English bilinguals completed an English auditory lexical decision task on the last word of low-and high-constraining sentences. Sentences were pronounced by a native Dutch speaker with English as the L 2, or by a native English speaker with Dutch as the L 2. Interlingual homophones (e. g., lief "sweet" - leaf/lirf/) were always recognized more slowly than control words. The semantic constraint of the sentence and the native accent of the speaker modulated, but did not eliminate interlingual homophone effects. These results are discussed within language-nonselective models of lexical access in <b>bilingual</b> auditory <b>word</b> <b>recognition...</b>|$|R
2500|$|The BIA {{model is}} an {{implemented}} connectionist model of <b>bilingual</b> visual <b>word</b> <b>recognition.</b> This language-nonselective model is structured by four hierarchical levels of different linguistic representations: letter features, letters, words, and language tags (or language node). When a word is presented by this model, {{the features of}} its constituted letters are firstly activated. Then, these letter features work together and activate the letters {{of which they are}} part in the presented words. [...] In turn, these letters activate the words of that language. The word candidates activate the language nodes which are connected. They simultaneously send feedback activation to the letter level. Language nodes can also inhibit the activation of word candidates from other languages (e.g., the English language node reduces the activation of Dutch word candidates). After a complex interactive process of activation and inhibition, the lexical candidate corresponding to the presented word becomes the most active word unit.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Word</b> <b>recognition</b> {{is usually}} {{used in both}} narrow and broad ways. When it {{is used in the}} narrow sense, it means the moment when a match occurs between a printed word and its orthographic word-form stored in the lexicon, or a match between a spoken word and its phonological word-form. Only after this match has taken place, all the syntactical and {{morphological}} information of the word and {{the meaning of the word}} will become accessible for further processing. In a broader way, it refers to lexical access is the entire period from the match processing to the retrieval of lexical information. [...] In the research of <b>bilingual</b> lexical access, <b>word</b> <b>recognition</b> uses single, out-of-context words from both languages to investigate all the aspects of bilingual lexical access.|$|R
40|$|The target article {{represents}} a significant {{advance in the}} level of sophistication applied to models of <b>bilingual</b> <b>word</b> <b>recognition,</b> and Dijkstra and van Heuven are to be congratulated on this endeavour. Bearing in mind the success of the (computational) BIA model in capturing detailed patterns of experimental data, I look forward to future simulation results from the BIA+ when the proposals of this new framework are implemented. It is an essential step to draw a distinction between recognition systems and the decision mechanisms that drive responses, and the authors have provided a novel way of apportioning empirical evidence of context effects in <b>bilingual</b> <b>word</b> <b>recognition</b> across this divide. Given the explanatory weight now being placed on decision mechanisms rather than the word recognition system itself, perhaps indeed it is now time to make some simplifying assumptions about the recognition system and start building detailed computational models of the decision component of the system. Implementation will provide the clarity of theorisation and evaluation of theory viability that have been the hallmark of the BIA model thus far...|$|E
40|$|The role of cross-linguistic phonological {{overlap in}} native and {{non-native}} word recognition was examined using an auditory lexical decision task.

Cross-linguistic overlap facilitated word {{recognition in the}} non-native language, but inhibited word recognition in the native language.

40|$|Dutch-English bilinguals {{performed}} a generalized lexical decision task on triplets of items, responding with "yes" if all three items were correct Dutch and/or English words, and with "no" if {{one or more}} of the items was not a word in either language. Sometimes the second item in a triplet was an interlingual homograph whose English meaning was semantically related to the third item of the triplet (e. g., HOUSE - ANGEL - HEAVEN, where ANGEL means "sting" in Dutch). In such cases, the first item was either an exclusively English (HOUSE) or an exclusively Dutch (ZAAK) word. Semantic priming effects were found in on-line response times. Event-related potentials that were recorded simultaneously showed N 400 priming effects thought to reflect semantic integration processes. The response time and N 400 priming effects were not affected by the language of the first item in the triplets, providing evidence in support of a strong bottom-up role with respect to <b>bilingual</b> <b>word</b> <b>recognition.</b> The results are interpreted in terms of the Bilingual Interactive Activation (BIA) model, a language nonselective access model assuming bottom-up priority.

40|$|It is {{not easy}} to comment on Dijkstra and Van Heuven's model because there are many more aspects we agree with than aspects we feel uncomfortable about. Indeed, the BIA model has played an {{enormous}} role in showing us how <b>bilingual</b> visual <b>word</b> <b>recognition</b> can be achieved without recurrence to the intuitively appealing – but wrong – ideas of separate, language-specific lexicons and language-selective access. As in many other research areas, a working computational model has been much more influential in convincing critical readers (and researchers) than any series of empirical findings. The BIA+ model inherits this strength and, hopefully, in the coming years will be implemented in enough detail to exceed its predecessor. In the rest of this comment, we would like to put a cautionary note behind the temporal delay assumption introduced in the target article and provide some additional corroborating evidence for the lack of non-linguistic effects on early processes in the identification system...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{investigated}} visual <b>word</b> <b>recognition</b> in <b>bilinguals</b> and monolinguals {{through the}} effects of word frequency, lexicality and repetition. The first series of experiments focused on whether bilinguals can suppress lexical access in a non-target language {{and the role of}} task demands in L 1 and L 2 lexical access. The next series of experiments further investigated the role of task demands, list composition and repetition in monolinguals. The ERP data show, for the first time, that in bilinguals, lexical access occurs in the non-target language, supporting the notion of a nonselective lexical access. Delayed lexicality effects in ERPs for L 2 compared to L 1 suggested a delay in lexical access for L 2 in late bilinguals, although behavioural data showed a similar word frequency effect to L 1. These conflicting responses have not been anticipated by current models of <b>bilingual</b> visual <b>word</b> <b>recognition.</b> However, monolingual data make clear that lexical effects can be modulated by task demands and list composition in behavioural responses. In monolinguals, the slower processing of less familiar items was enhanced by item repetition only when the task required a lexical decision and words and word-like letter strings were presented. Lastly, this thesis has demonstrated that current models of visual <b>word</b> <b>recognition</b> have not fully implemented these elements and have not predicted response times distribution or ERPs. Future models of visual <b>word</b> <b>recognition</b> should incorporate these elements to be able to characterise lexical access in bilinguals and monolinguals...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} how noun and verb processing in <b>bilingual</b> visual <b>word</b> <b>recognition</b> {{are affected by}} within and between-language overlap. We investigated how word class ambiguous noun and verb cognates are processed by bilinguals, to see if co-activation of overlapping word forms between languages benefits from additional overlap within a language, and whether this effect is sensitive to the grammatical category of a word. Although effects of form overlap are ubiquitous in studies on nouns, {{little is known about}} such effects in verbs. In two experiments, Dutch-English bilinguals performed lexical decision tasks in L 2 in which cognate status and word class ambiguity were manipulated in nouns and verbs. Responses to verb targets in both experiments showed facilitatory effects of both types of overlap. In contrast, noun targets in both experiments showed only a cognate effect, but no ambiguity effect. We argue that the difference between verbs and nouns arises because verb representations are more complex than those of nouns. As a consequence, verb processing benefits more from within-language form overlap than noun processing...|$|R
40|$|The {{debate between}} single and dual route {{accounts}} of cognitive processes has been generated predominantly by {{the application of}} connectionist modeling techniques to two areas of psycholinguistics. This paper draws an analogy between this debate and bilingual language processing. A prominent question within <b>bilingual</b> <b>word</b> <b>recognition</b> is whether the bilingual has functionally separate lexicons for each language, or a single system able to recognize the words in both languages. Empirical evidence has been taken to support a model which includes two separate lexicons working in parallel (Smith, 1991; Gerard and Scarborough, 1989). However, a range of interference effects has been found between the bilingual’s two sets of lexical knowledge (Thomas, 1997 a). Connectionist models have been put forward which suggest that a single representational resource may deal with these data, so long as words are coded according to language membership (Thomas, 1997 a, 1997 b, Dijkstra and van Heuven, 1998). This paper discusses the criteria which {{might be used to}} differentiate single route and dual route models. An empirical study is introduced to address one of these criteria, parallel access, with regard to <b>bilingual</b> <b>word</b> <b>recognition.</b> The study fails to find support for the dual route model...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} whether language nonselective lexical {{access in}} <b>bilingual</b> auditory <b>word</b> <b>recognition</b> when listening {{in the native}} language (L 1) is modulated by (a) the semantic constraint of the sentence and (b) the second language (L 2) proficiency level. We report 2 experiments in which Dutch-English bilinguals with different proficiency levels completed an L 1 auditory lexical-decision task on the last word of low-and high-constraining sentences. The critical stimuli were interlingual homophones (e. g., lief [sweet] - leaf /li:f/). Participants recognized homophones significantly slower than matched control words. Importantly, neither the semantic constraint of the sentence, nor the proficiency level of the bilinguals interacted with this interlingual homophone effect. However, when we compared the slow and fast reaction times (RTs), we observed {{a reduction in the}} homophone interference effect when listening to high-constraining sentences in L 1 for the slow RTs, but not for the fast RTs. Taken together, this provides strong evidence for a language-nonselective account of lexical access when listening in L 1, and suggests that even when low-proficient bilinguals are listening to high-constraint sentences in L 1, both languages of a bilingual are still activated...|$|R
40|$|Many {{studies have}} {{reported}} that <b>word</b> <b>recognition</b> in a second language (L 2) {{is affected by the}} native language (L 1). However, {{little is known about the}} role of the specific language combination of the bilinguals. To investigate this issue, the authors administered a word identification task (progressive demasking) on 1, 025 monosyllabic English (L 2) words to native speakers of French, German, and Dutch. A regression approach was adopted, including a large number of within- and between-language variables as predictors. A substantial overlap of reaction time patterns was found across the groups of <b>bilinguals,</b> showing that <b>word</b> <b>recognition</b> results obtained for one group of bilinguals generalize to bilinguals with different mother tongues. Moreover, among the set of significant predictors, only one between-language variable was present (cognate status) : all others reflected characteristics of the target language. Thus, although influences across languages exist, <b>word</b> <b>recognition</b> in L 2 by proficient bilinguals is primarily determined by within-language factors, whereas cross-language effects appear to be limited. An additional comparison of the bilingual data with a native control group showed that there are subtle but significant differences between L 1 and L 2 processing...|$|R

The findings are further evidence against language-selective access models of <b>bilingual</b> <b>word</b> processing and are more in line with strong phonological models of visual <b>word</b> <b>recognition</b> than with the traditional dual-route models...|$|R

40|$|An {{increasing}} number of studies has demonstrated that learning {{to read and write}} influences the way spoken language is processed. While previous research on this field of study almost exclusively investigated orthographic effects on L 1 spoken word processing, the present thesis is aimed at extending previous findings to L 2 spoken word processing. In {{the first part of the}} thesis, a working model of <b>bilingual</b> <b>word</b> <b>recognition</b> is developed, which is able to explain orthographic and phonological interactions during L 2 word processing. The architecture of the working model is based on previous outcomes of research on auditory and visual word recognition as well as current findings on orthographic influences during spoken auditory word recognition. In the second part of the thesis, the working model is tested in three psycholinguistic experiments on auditory word recognition (rhyme judgement, phoneme deletion and lexical decision). Special emphasis of the investigation lies on a cross-linguistic comparison between native and non-native speakers of English as well as between two groups of non-native speakers of English with different orthographic backgrounds, i. e. a shallow orthography (German) and a deep orthography (Danish). The results of the experiments show that orthographic information is activated during L 2 auditory word processing. However, differences exist between L 2 participants from a shallow and a deep L 1 orthographic system. These results are discussed with reference to the working model of <b>bilingual</b> <b>word</b> <b>recognition...</b>|$|E
40|$|The present {{dissertation}} {{investigated the}} development of visual word recognition in bilingual children {{at the beginning of}} initial reading acquisition. The central aim was to contribute to the debate on differences in orthographic processing between bilinguals and monolinguals, expanding the body of existing research by knowledge on <b>bilingual</b> <b>word</b> <b>recognition</b> mechanisms in beginning readers of German. The two main goals were to (1) study differences in the developmental trajectories of reading between first (L 1) and second (L 2) language speakers, and (2) to investigate {{the development of}} orthographic processing mechanisms that are specific to the <b>bilingual</b> <b>word</b> <b>recognition</b> system. To disentangle developmental effects between dominant and balanced bilinguals, four studies were conducted, of which two focused on children learning to read in German as their L 2, and two examined German-English balanced bilinguals learning to read concurrently in both languages. Study 1 investigated performance differences between L 1 and L 2 speakers in different component processes of reading, while controlling for the impact of linguistic and executive functioning skills. Study 2 zoomed in on the mechanisms of lexical access and compared L 1 and L 2 speakers’ lexical decision performance with regard to the impact of linguistic characteristics throughout elementary school. In study 3, the parallel activation of orthographic as well as semantic representations in both languages of balanced bilingual children was examined by studying the processing of cognates and false friends in German and English.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the effects of working memory capacity, access to subordinate meanings of L 1 homonyms and degree of cross-language activation on the access to subordinate meanings of L 2 homonyms. In Experiment 1, Spanish-English <b>bilinguals</b> completed a <b>word</b> <b>recognition</b> task which assessed how quickly and accurately they accessed subordinate meanings of English homonyms that were either noncognates (e. g. fast/ rápido) or cognates (e. g. letter/letra) with Spanish. In Experiment 2, another group of Spanish-English bilinguals read sentences while having their eye-movements recorded for measures of lexical access. On the critical trials, sentences contained a homonym that was either a noncognate (e. g. fast/rápido) or cognate with Spanish (e. g. letter/letra). The context preceding the target word (i. e. homonym) was either biased to the subordinate meaning or neutral. General analyses from Experiments 1 and 2 showed that access to subordinate meanings of cognate homonyms was facilitated compared to access to subordinate meanings of noncognate homonyms. Analyses of the individual differences factors revealed that access to subordinate meanings of L 1 homonyms was the most consistent predictor of access to subordinate meanings of L 2 homonyms. These findings are discussed in terms of how these individual differences should be taken into account to better model the dynamics of bilingual lexical disambiguation. ...|$|R
40|$|When <b>bilinguals</b> speak, do <b>words</b> {{from both}} {{languages}} compete for selection? Under one hypothesis of <b>bilingual</b> <b>word</b> selection, <b>bilinguals</b> select <b>words</b> for speech similarly to monolinguals because word selection {{is restricted to}} the response language (language specific selection; e. g., Costa & Caramazza, 1999). Alternatively, <b>bilinguals</b> may select <b>words</b> for speech such that words from both languages are considered during selection (language non-specific selection; e. g., Green, 1998). Critically, if <b>bilinguals</b> choose <b>words</b> from among both the response and non-response languages, then they must manage the activation levels of two competing languages in order to select the correct word. It is assumed that bilinguals accomplish this process by exerting inhibitory control over non-response language words to reduce their activation level (e. g., Meuter & Allport, 1999), which may grant bilinguals an inhibitory control advantage in comparison to monolinguals because bilinguals constantly recruit and exercise inhibitory control processes (e. g., Bialystok, Craik & Luk, 2012). However, it {{remains an open question}} whether <b>bilingual</b> <b>word</b> selection proceeds differently from that of monolinguals. Thus, the main goal of this dissertation was to characterize <b>bilingual</b> <b>word</b> selection during speech. Specifically, I manipulated a factor known to influence word selection processes (i. e., whether a picture has more than one name or not (name agreement (NA)), e. g., sofa/couch; e. g., Vitkovitch & Humphreys, 1995) to determine how <b>bilinguals</b> select <b>words</b> for speech. I investigated <b>bilingual</b> <b>word</b> selection by comparing bilingual and monolingual speakers’ behavioral performance and neural activation patterns on a picture naming task that manipulated response and non-response language NA. The results show that bilinguals’ behavioral performance and level of neural activation are not influenced by non-response language NA. However, bilinguals did show neural connectivity patterns that were influenced by non-response language NA. I interpreted this pattern of results to suggest that <b>bilinguals</b> select <b>words</b> from both languages and that they use inhibitory control processes to do so. The results thus not only characterize how <b>bilinguals</b> produce <b>words</b> fluently in one language over another but also shed light on the potential link between <b>bilingual</b> <b>word</b> selection processes and the possible cognitive advantages associated with bilingualism...|$|R
40|$|In a {{semantic}} priming study, we investigated {{the processing of}} German–English homographs such as gift (German = “poison”, English = “present”) in sentence contexts using a joint reaction time (RT) /event-related brain potential (ERP) measure. Native German speakers with intermediate or advanced knowledge of English (N = 48) performed an all-L 2 (English) experiment where sentences such as “The woman gave her friend an expensive gift” (control prime: item) were presented, followed by targets (i. e., boss) for lexical decision. To test the role of global task effects during sentence processing, we presented half the participants (N = 24) with a 20 -min silent film narrated in German and half (N = 24) with the film in English before the experiment. To address the development of task effects over time, we analyzed {{the first and second}} blocks of the experiment. The results showed a significant interaction between semantic priming, movie version, and block in both the RTs and ERPs: there was significant semantic priming in the RTs and modulations in the N 200 and N 400 components only for participants who viewed the German movie, and only during the first block. Results suggest that in an all-L 2 sentence task with L 2 pre-task priming (English film), decision thresholds are raised high enough to eliminate measurable influence of the L 1 on the L 2. Despite identical material, participants who viewed the German film had to adjust, or zoom in, to the all-L 2 task. Implications of this zooming in process in are discussed in terms of the recent Bilingual Interactive Activation (BIA+) model of <b>bilingual</b> <b>word</b> <b>recognition</b> [T. Dijkstra, W. J. B.

Little is known about the bilingual processing of Russian and English, but studies indicate that the partially distinct character of the Russian and English scripts does not prevent co-activation (Jouravlev and Jared, 2014; Marian and Spivey, 2003; Kaushanskaya and Marian, 2007) ...|$|E

The <b>word</b> <b>recognition</b> errors considered by this study were basic miscues (substitutions, omissions, insertions, teacher-pronounced); substitution types; reversal errors; and linguistic acceptability (syntactic and semantic).

40|$|We {{present an}} {{information}} theoretic objective for <b>bilingual</b> <b>word</b> clustering that incorporates both monolingual distributional evidence {{as well as}} cross-lingual evidence from parallel corpora to learn high quality word clusters jointly {{in any number of}} languages. The monolingual component of our objective is the average mutual information of clusters of adjacent words in each language, while the bilingual component is the average mutual information of the aligned clusters. To evaluate our method, we use the word clusters in an NER system and demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in F 1 score when using <b>bilingual</b> <b>word</b> clusters instead of monolingual clusters. ...|$|R
