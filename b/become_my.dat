25|$|The {{origins of}} My Own Private Idaho came from John Rechy's 1963 novel, City of Night, which {{featured}} characters who were street hustlers {{who did not}} admit to being gay. Van Sant's original screenplay {{was written in the}} 1970s, when he was living in Hollywood. After reading Rechy's book, Van Sant realized that it was considerably better than what he was writing, so he shelved the script for years. In 1988, while editing Mala Noche, Van Sant met a street kid named Michael Parker who became a source of inspiration for the character of Mike in what would later <b>become</b> <b>My</b> Own Private Idaho. Parker also had a friend named Scott, a street kid like himself. In the script, Van Sant adapted the Scott character to that of a rich kid. The character of Scott was also fashioned after people Van Sant had met in Portland who were street hustlers.|$|E

There's great sadness in leaving my friends and the show – I was never bored with it – but I'm not at all ambivalent about this. I'm realistic about taking care of myself financially. I didn't want to walk away blindly without plans. My plans are set. I have a project with a network that is ready to go that I can't talk about yet. It's a drama mystery." ...|$|E

Dürr notes the movement's [...] "extremely dense, highly expressive texture" [...] with motifs independent from the hymn tune but derived from its beginning. The Bach scholar Richard D. P. Jones observes that the movement foreshadows , the opening chorus of Bach's St Matthew Passion, in key, 12/8 metre and [...] "much else".|$|E

[...] McCain later wrote that he had a [...] "vague aspiration" [...] of running for president for a long time. [...] He would also be candid about his motivation: [...] "I didn't decide to run for president to start a national crusade for the political reforms I believed in or to run a campaign as if it were some grand act of patriotism.

A strange lad, a little surprising on first encounter - both disturbing because of his sharp use of irony and also attractive because of a generosity that left him as vulnerable as a child. The first time I met him was at President Bonjean's house at Villepreux-les-Clayes, near Versailles, during a dinner which brought together the committee of that 'Villa Medicis Libre' which, as I said before, had been founded by Alexandre Mercereau. From that time onwards, we saw each other often and became friends.|$|E

Another important figure in Richard's early life was Ifor, his brother, 19 years his senior. A miner and rugby union player, Ifor [...] "ruled the household with the proverbial firm hand". He was also responsible for nurturing a passion for rugby in young Richard. Although Richard also played cricket, tennis, and table tennis, biographer Bragg notes rugby union football to be his greatest interest. On rugby, Richard said he [...] "would rather have played for Wales at Cardiff Arms Park than Hamlet at The Old Vic". The Welsh rugby union centre, Bleddyn Williams believed Richard [...] "had distinct possibilities as a player".|$|E
2500|$|After George Balanchine {{was hired}} by the Ballet Russe, he was {{attracted}} to Tallchief professionally and personally. She, however, was unaware of his attraction: [...] "It {{never occurred to me that}} there was anything more than dancing on his mind... It would have been preposterous to think there was anything personal." [...] Although their relationship became more personal, it was a shock to Tallchief when Balanchine asked her to marry him. During the summer of 1945, he asked her to meet him after a Los Angeles performance. Balanchine opened the car door for her; when she got in he sat in silence for a moment before saying, [...] "Maria, I would like you to <b>become</b> <b>my</b> wife". [...] "I almost fell out of my seat and was unable to respond", she recalled. [...] She eventually replied, [...] "But, George, I'm not sure I love you. I feel that I hardly know you." [...] He answered that it did not matter, and if the marriage only lasted a few years that was all right with him. After a day to think it over, Tallchief accepted his proposal.|$|E
