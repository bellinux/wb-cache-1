5|$|On 5 June 1965, {{locomotive}} 70051 Firth of Forth was hauling {{a passenger}} train when a <b>blowback</b> {{of the fire}} occurred near , severely injuring both traincrew. Driver Wallace Oakes managed to safely bring the train to a stand, but both he and fireman Gwilym Roberts were severely injured. Oakes died a week later. He was awarded the George Cross and the Carnegie Hero Trust bronze medal for his actions. Class 86 locomotive 86 240 was later named Wallace Oakes G.C. in his honour.|$|E
5|$|These {{guns were}} {{air-cooled}} {{and used a}} gas <b>blowback</b> recoil system. Unlike other automatic guns employed during World War II {{the barrel of the}} 20mm Oerlikon gun did not recoil, the breechblock never locked against the breech and actually moved forward when the gun fired. This weapon lacked a counter-recoil brake, as the force of the counter-recoil was checked by the explosion of the next round of ammunition.|$|E
5000|$|The {{guns were}} called the [...] "Davis-Warner Infallible", and their {{trademark}} was [...] "Blocks the Sear", {{a reference to}} the way the safety worked. Unlike the Schwarzlose M1908, the Davis-Warner guns are fairly conventional, striker fired, <b>blowbacks,</b> using a breechblock rather than a slide, though, since Browning had patented the idea of an auto pistol slide with an integral breechblock.|$|R
50|$|The Ion is an {{electropneumatic}} paintball marker {{manufactured by}} Smart Parts. At {{the time of}} its release, the Ion was the first fully electropneumatic marker to target entry-level players, at a price point previously inhabited only by Spyders and other mechanical <b>blowbacks.</b> The Ion has generally been credited with making high-rate-of-fire electropneumatic markers available to the masses, at a time when electropneumatic markers were considered out of reach of most casual or budget players.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Blowbacks</b> {{were fairly}} common. In a 1955 report on an {{accident}} near Dunstable, the Inspector wrote, [...] "In 1953 twenty-three cases, {{which were not}} caused by an engine defect, were reported and they resulted in 26 enginemen receiving injuries. In 1954 the number of occurrences and of injuries were the same {{and there was also}} one fatal casualty." [...] They remain a problem, as evidenced by the 2012 incident with BR standard class 7 70013 Oliver Cromwell.|$|R
5|$|Although {{the series}} fictionalises {{the world of}} MI5, several storylines are based on truth. The series had advisors who were ex-MI5 officers. The writers also {{research}} heavily on each episode. The producers were keen in world events that Britain and America were directly or indirectly responsible for, where the consequences of an operation are worse than what they intended to resolve in the first place, known as <b>blowback.</b> One example includes the two powers aiding the Afghan Mujahideen in 1989 before {{pulling out of the}} country; this ultimately lead to the rise of Al-Qaeda.|$|E
25|$|HK has {{a history}} of {{innovation}} in firearms, {{such as the use of}} polymers in weapon designs and the use of an integral rail for flashlights on handguns. HK also developed modern polygonal rifling, noted for its high accuracy, increased muzzle velocity and barrel life. Not all of its technologically ambitious designs have translated into commercially successful products (for instance, the advanced but now abandoned G11 military rifle, which fired caseless high-velocity ammunition). In its extensive product range, HK has used the following operating systems for small arms: <b>blowback</b> operation, short-recoil, roller-delayed <b>blowback,</b> gas-delayed <b>blowback,</b> and gas operation (via Short-stroke piston).|$|E
25|$|Llama I: Manufactured from 1933 to 1954. Self-loading pistol, <b>blowback</b> operation, {{miniature}} copy of Colt 1911 in 7.65mm/.32 ACP with nine-round {{magazine with}} a grip safety.|$|E
40|$|The present article {{develops}} {{the concept of}} selective realism to understand how design features and narrative frames of first- and third-person shooters (F/TPS) exclude attention to salient, yet unpleasant, features of warfare such as problematic forms of violence, long-term psychological impacts, or sociopolitical <b>blowbacks.</b> Identifying four specific filters that frame player experiences, I argue that the resulting selectivity is significant because it is characteristic of the F/TPS genre as a whole that, through its wide dissemination, impacts upon the cultural framing of actual warfare. The article illustrates features of selective realism before it conducts in-depth analysis of the titles Spec Ops: The Line and The Last of Us to show how critical game design can invite a conscious unraveling of the generic frames and the ideological positions these invite. The article concludes with a reassessment of arguments regarding alleged sociopolitical impacts of war- and violence-themed computer games...|$|R
500|$|Naomi and Emily {{escape to}} the {{countryside}} later that evening and cycle to one of Emily's favourite places by a lake before sunset. After swimming in the lake, they light a campfire, and share a cannabis joint. An act of <b>blowbacking</b> the joint leads the two to share a kiss and they proceed to make love. Emily wakes up the following morning to find Naomi preparing to leave. She pleads with Naomi not to leave her a second time and tells her that she should accept {{that she needs to}} be loved. Naomi goes home to find Kieran in bed with her mother, and leaves for college, devastated. She sees her teachers rigging the election to prevent Cook from winning, and reveals this to the form when she is announced the winner. As his first presidential act, Cook starts a riot. In the ensuing chaos, Naomi forgives Kieran, encouraging him that if he likes her mother, he should tell her so. Naomi begins to have sex with Cook before she realises that it [...] "isn't right". Surprisingly, Cook doesn't seem to mind, as he says that she must have a good reason not to follow through because she's clever. Naomi leaves, with her and Cook now sharing a better understanding of each other. That night, she visits Emily's house, but Emily refuses to open the door, not wanting Naomi to see her after she had been crying. They sit {{on opposite sides of the}} door, and Naomi admits that she does need somebody to love her. Emily offers her hand through the door's cat flap to Naomi, who finally reciprocates Emily's feelings.|$|R
40|$|The NDP {{was founded}} {{out of the}} ashes of the Co-Operative Commonwealth Federation to {{cooperate}} with the Canadian Labour Congress to become the 'political arm of organized labour' in Canada. The NDP has long claimed they are the party which represents the policy goals of organized labour in Canada: that the NDP alone will fight for trade union rights, and will fight for Canadian workers. Divergent Paths is an examination of the links between the labour movement and the ND P in an era ofneo-liberalism. Provincial NDP governments have become increasingly neoliberal in their ideological orientation, and have often proved to be no friend to the labour movement when they hold office. The Federal party has never held power, nor have they ever formed the Official Opposition. This thesis charts the progress of the federal NDP as they become more neoliberal from 1988 to 2006, and shows how this trend effects the links between the NDP and labour. Divergent Paths studies each federal election from 1988 to 2006, looking at the interactions between Labour and the NDP during these elections. Elections provide critical junctions to study discourse - party platforms, speeches, and other official documents can be used to examine discourse. Extensive newspaper searches were used to follow campaign events and policy speeches. Studying the party's discourse can be used to determine the ideological orientation of the party itself: the fact that the party's discourse has become neoliberal is a sure sign that the party itself is neoliberal. The NDP continues to drive towards the centre of the political spectrum in an attempt to gain multi-class support. The NDP seems more interested in gaining seats at any cost, rather then promoting the agenda of Labour. As the party attempts to open up to more multi-class support, Labour becomes increasingly marginalised in the party. A rift which arguably started well before the 1988 election was exacerbated during that election; labour encouraged the NDP to campaign solely on the issue of Free Trade, and the NDP did not. The 1993 election saw the rift between the two grow even further as the Federal NDP suffered major <b>blowbacks</b> from the actions of the Ontario NDP. The 1997 and 2000 elections saw the NDP make a deliberate move to the centre of the political spectrum which increasingly marginalised labour. In the 2004 election, Jack Layton made no attempt to move the party back to the left; and in 2006 the link between labour and the NDP was perhaps irreparably damaged when the CAW endorsed the Liberal party in a strategic voting strategy, and the CLC did not endorse the NDP. The NDP is no longer a reliable ally of organized labour. The Canadian labour movement must decide wether the NDP can be 'salvaged' or if the labour movement should end their alliance with the NDP and engage in a new political project...|$|R
25|$|The M1 and M1A1 had {{a barrel}} without cooling fins, a {{simplified}} rear sight, provisions only for box magazines, employed a straight <b>blowback</b> {{action and the}} charging handle was {{on the side of}} the receiver.|$|E
25|$|The M1928A1 had {{provisions}} for box and drum magazines. It had a Cutts compensator, cooling fins on the barrel, employed a delayed <b>blowback</b> action and its charging handle {{was on the}} top of the receiver.|$|E
25|$|Llama XIX: Manufactured from 1954 to 1997. Self-loading pistol, <b>blowback</b> operation, {{miniature}} copy of Colt 1911 in 9mm corto/.380 ACP with grip safety. Also had {{a longer}} manual safety lever. Identical to Llama III-A except for lighter weight aluminium alloy frame.|$|E
25|$|In May 2011, it was {{announced}} that Plame would write a series of spy novels with mystery writer Sarah Lovett. The first book in the series, titled <b>Blowback,</b> was released on October 1, 2013, by Blue Rider Press, an imprint of the Penguin Group.|$|E
25|$|Tricky has guest starred on {{a number}} of albums, {{including}} a notable appearance on Live's fifth studio album, V. This appearance came as Tricky and Live's lead singer Ed Kowalczyk had developed a close friendship, with Kowalczyk contributing vocals to 'Evolution Revolution Love', a track on Tricky's album <b>Blowback.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{strategy}} {{to support the}} Afghans against Soviet military intervention was evolved by several intelligence agencies, including the C.I.A. and Inter-Services Intelligence, or ISI. After the Soviet withdrawal, the Western powers {{walked away from the}} region, leaving behind 40,000 militants imported from several countries to wage the anti-Soviet jihad. Pakistan was left to face the <b>blowback</b> of extremism, drugs and guns.|$|E
25|$|In 1903 and 1905, the Winchester Repeating Arms Company {{introduced}} the first semi-automatic rimfire and centerfire rifles designed {{especially for the}} civilian market. The Winchester Model 1903 and Winchester Model 1905 operated {{on the principle of}} <b>blowback</b> in order to function semi-automatically. Designed entirely by T.C. Johnson, the Model 1903 achieved commercial success and continued to be manufactured until 1932 when the Winchester Model 63 replaced it.|$|E
25|$|Charlie follows Gust's {{guidance}} to seek support for post-Soviet occupation Afghanistan, but finds no enthusiasm {{in the government}} for even the modest measures he proposes. In the end, Charlie receives a major commendation for his support of the U.S. clandestine services, but his pride is tempered by his fears of the <b>blowback</b> his secret efforts could yield {{in the future and}} the implications of U.S. disengagement from Afghanistan.|$|E
25|$|The FAMAS {{assault rifle}} is a bullpup configuration, with the {{ammunition}} feed behind the trigger. The receiver housing {{is made of}} a special steel alloy, and the rifle furniture is made of fiberglass. The rifle uses a lever-delayed <b>blowback</b> action, an action used on the AA-52 machine gun derived from the prototypes built during Army Technical Department tests having taken place between the First and Second World Wars.|$|E
25|$|Llama XI-A and Llama XI-B: Manufactured from 1955 to 1995. Self-loading pistol, locked breech and <b>blowback,</b> {{based on}} Colt 1911A1, in 9mm Parabellum with grip safety. Checkered wooden or plastic grips, spurred hammer, eight-round magazine. Apart from name and caliber, not {{directly}} based on Llama XI Especial. The Llama XI-B was a compact model. Subject to recalls in 1984 (Llama XI-A) and 1992 (Llama XI-B) due to risk of accidental discharge.|$|E
25|$|BFAs for <b>blowback</b> and gas-operated {{firearms}} {{are relatively}} simple. These weapons depend on high pressures {{in the chamber}} generated by the combustion of the propellant to push the breech block to the rear, allowing another round to be chambered and fired. If a blank round is used, there is no bullet to seal the barrel, and the combustion gases exit through the muzzle without building up enough pressure to rechamber the next round.|$|E
25|$|The pistol was mass-produced {{and many}} {{examples}} still exist today. The Spanish Navy, {{along with the}} German Luftwaffe and the Chilean Navy primarily use the smaller variant Astra 300 and the Wehrmacht later altered the Astra 400 into the Astra 600 to better handle the 9mm Luger. The 400 was considered heavy as in order to handle {{the power of the}} 9mm Largo round in a <b>blowback</b> action the 400 had a reinforced slide and tough spring.|$|E
25|$|The FAMAS uses {{a delayed}} <b>blowback</b> {{operating}} system that functions best with French-specified steel-casing 5.56x45mm ammunition. Using standard brass-casing 5.56×45mm NATO ammunition employed by other armies can create over-pressure and case ruptures in the FAMAS, {{which can lead}} to severe malfunctions. Using incorrectly built ammunition also results in approximately two minor injuries for every million rounds fired from a FAMAS. As a result, the French military has discreetly banned the use of foreign-produced ammunition in all French-issued FAMAS rifles.|$|E
25|$|On 12 August 2016, Ivanov {{was fired}} from his Chief of Staff {{position}} by Putin and replaced by Anton Vaino. Ivanov then became a special envoy for transportation and the environment. Putin's firing of Ivanov {{was part of a}} series of replacements of Putin's older peers with young loyalists. The Steele Dossier (Report 2016/111) claims that his encouragement of meddling in the US 2016 Presidential elections, which provoked unanticipated <b>blowback</b> against the Kremlin, was the catalyst for his firing.|$|E
25|$|Llama III-A: Manufactured from 1954 to 1997. Self-loading pistol, <b>blowback</b> {{operation}} (earlier models up {{to about}} 1975: locked breech), miniature copy of Colt 1911 in 9mm corto/.380 ACP with seven-round magazine and with grip safety. Also fitted with longer manual safety lever. Early models fitted with lanyard ring; later models replaced this with a ventilated rib and plastic target grips. Luxury finishes (including gold plating) and various engraving options were available. One {{of the most successful}} models in the Llama range.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the church}} shooting, many {{commentators}} questioned the continued {{display of the}} flag at the memorial on the State House grounds. The flag had first been erected in 1962 by the state's Democratic governor in a protest against desegregation. Opposition and attempts to remove the flag began almost immediately. In 1996, then-governor David Beasley pushed to have it removed from the Capitol dome, only to back off and then be driven from office two years later in the political <b>blowback.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Bizon uses {{a simple}} {{straight}} <b>blowback</b> method of operation, an unlocked breech system reduces cost and build complexity. The Bizon's operating cycle {{is characterized by}} a very short recoil stroke, standard 9×18mm ammunition will only drive the bolt partially {{to the rear of the}} receiver and produces a cyclic rate of 700 rounds/min. High-impulse ammunition forces the bolt to travel all the way to the end of the receiver, barely striking the receiver wall. A rate of fire of 650–680 rounds/min is the result. This has the effect of reducing perceived recoil and increasing controllability and hit probability.|$|E
25|$|The Type 100 {{was typical}} of the class of simple, inexpensive, wartime submachine guns {{produced}} by all military powers—designed for maximum ease of production. It is based on a simplified Bergmann MP18, modified for the 8mm Nambu round. It was an automatic-only, air-cooled, <b>blowback</b> weapon firing from an open bolt and feeding from a side-mounted, 30-round detachable box magazine. The barrel was given six-groove, right-hand-twist rifling. Unusually for a submachine gun (but typical of Japanese weapons of the era), a bayonet lug was fixed under the barrel, in this case with a heavy bar and lug. Some of these models featured a bipod, and others featured a complicated muzzle brake.|$|E
25|$|The Hamada pistol is a <b>blowback</b> {{pistol and}} {{functionally}} {{a copy of}} the Browning Model 1910. The most significant design difference between the Hamada pistol and Browning Model 1910 is the replacement of the interrupter lugs used to hold the barrel of the Browning Model 1910 with a dovetail joint. The frame plate lock design and striker assembly were also modified and awarded patents in 1943. The Hamada pistol maintained high quality throughout its production, with the bluing done to a high standard. The safety, rear frame plate, and extractor were heat tempered to a reddish brown and the barrel, striker, and firing mechanism were brightly polished.|$|E
25|$|The Astra 400 {{is heavy}} {{compared}} to many contemporary service pistols {{of the time}} like the Tokarev TT-33 but is similar in weight and length to the Colt 1911. The Astra 400 {{was designed to be}} safe to fire with a simple <b>blowback</b> action unaided by any breech-locking devices. This is only possible with a heavy slide and strong recoil spring. It was fitted with an internal hammer which was considered very hard to cock. The pistol also featured grooved finger grips and left sided combined slide lock/safety behind the trigger guard. The original design was chambered in 9mm Largo, but later variants would be chambered differently so as to better fulfill different military needs.|$|E
25|$|The P7 is a {{semi-automatic}} blowback-operated firearm. It {{features a}} unique gas-delayed <b>blowback</b> locking system {{modeled on the}} Swiss Pistole 47 W+F (Waffenfabrik Bern) prototype pistol (and ultimately on the Barnitzke system first used in the Volkssturmgewehr 1-5), which used gas pressures from the ignited cartridge and fed them through a small port in the barrel (in front of the chamber) to retard the rearward motion of the slide. This is accomplished {{by means of a}} piston contained inside a cylinder located under the barrel that opposes the rearward motion of the slide until the gas pressure has declined—after the bullet has left the barrel—hence allowing the slide to end its rearward motion, opening the breech and ejecting the empty cartridge case.|$|E
500|$|Brown ran as a moderate, {{stressing}} {{his ability}} to cross party lines and highlighting his votes for the Dodd-Frank financial reform law and to repeal [...] "don't ask, don't tell". Warren campaigned on a platform championing the middle class, and supporting Wall Street regulation. Warren criticized Brown for continually voting with Republican leadership, and argued {{that he was not}} the bipartisan moderate he claimed to be. A staple of Brown's attack tactics against Warren was his consistent reference to her as [...] "Professor Warren", in attempt to portray her as an elitist academic. Brown faced <b>blowback</b> after the second debate, during which he claimed conservative Antonin Scalia was a [...] "model" [...] Supreme Court Justice, prompting boos from the debate audience.|$|E
500|$|Elements of {{the music}} video for [...] "We Found Love" [...] have been {{compared}} to the works of Britney Spears, Eminem and Madonna. The scene in which Rihanna and O'Shaughnessy blow marijuana exhalations into each other's mouths is stylistically reminiscent of the cover artwork on English musician Tricky's 2001 album <b>Blowback.</b> Rihanna's video was compared to the video for Spears' song [...] "Everytime" [...] (2004). Critics noted that Rihanna lay in a bathtub and submerged her head under the water, which {{can be interpreted as}} a failed suicide attempt. In [...] "Everytime", Spears is shown as a successful singer constantly bothered by the media and paparazzi about her turbulent relationship with her boyfriend. In [...] "Everytime"s video, Spears drowns in a bathtub {{as a result of a}} concussion. Rihanna's video also bears resemblances to that for Eminem and Rihanna's [...] "Love the Way You Lie" [...] (2010); both contain lyrical and visual content about a doomed relationship and scenes of graphic violence and substance abuse. Like [...] "We Found Love", [...] "Love the Way You Lie" [...] displays scenes of a couple in various stages of undress and intimacy. [...] "We Found Love"s video includes stylistic references to Madonna's video for [...] "Ray of Light" [...] (1998). James Montgomery of MTV News noted that [...] "Ray of Light"s video features [...] "a whole lot of high-speed, time-lapse shots taken in cities around the world", the same technique used for the drug scenes in [...] "We Found Love".|$|E
