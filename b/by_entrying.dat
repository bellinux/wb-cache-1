50|$|Presumably Weinsberg {{was created}} {{at the same}} time and {{surrounded}} with a city wall. In 1241 the town was first mentioned in one Staufish income list, where Weinsberg ranked at 29 equal with Donauwörth, Wiesbaden, Offenburg and Konstanz. The date of when Weinsberg attained its town privileges is unknown. However, it must have been before 1283, since Rudolf I had lent its town privileges to Löwenstein in this year - after the model of the city right, which its predecessors of the town Weinsberg had lent. At the beginning one half of Weinsberg was a free imperial city, the other half belonged to the Masters of Weinsberg. The town persisted on its status as a free imperial city and affirmed it <b>by</b> <b>entrying</b> to different city federations, what led to numerous quarrels between the town and the masters.|$|E

40|$|Status {{attainment}} in the Netherlands is analysed {{using both}} linear regression and multinomial logistic (MNL) regression for male labour-market cohorts between 1920 and 1990.

The regression analyses indicate that the effect of father's occupation becomes weaker for later entrants into the labour market and as work experience accumulates. The impact of education is not affected <b>by</b> <b>entry</b> year but only by work experience. The MNL models largely confirm the results of the regression analysis, but show that the weakening impact of father's occupation <b>by</b> <b>entry</b> year and experience is not due to an increased flow between occupational classes, but only to a reduced propensity to immobility...|$|R
5000|$|The {{main idea}} of the median filter is to run through the signal <b>entry</b> <b>by</b> <b>entry,</b> {{replacing}} each entry with the median of neighboring entries. The pattern of neighbors is called the [...] "window", which slides, <b>entry</b> <b>by</b> <b>entry,</b> over the entire signal. For 1D signals, the most obvious window {{is just the first}} few preceding and following entries, whereas for 2D (or higher-dimensional) signals such as images, more complex window patterns are possible (such as [...] "box" [...] or [...] "cross" [...] patterns). Note that if the window has an odd number of entries, then the median is simple to define: it is just the middle value after all the entries in the window are sorted numerically. For an even number of entries, {{there is more than one}} possible median, see median for more details.|$|R
