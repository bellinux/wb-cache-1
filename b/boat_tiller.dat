6000|$|He {{looked at}} Midwinter {{as he made}} the inquiry, but it was Allan who told him {{the story of the}} night, and Allan who asked the doctor for {{information}} in return. The one absorbing interest in Midwinter's mind--the interest of penetrating the mystery of the dream--kept him silent throughout. Heedless of all that was said or done about him, he watched Allan, and followed Allan, like a dog, until the time came for getting down into the boat. Mr. Hawbury's professional eye rested on him curiously, noting his varying color, and the incessant restlessness of his hands. [...] "I wouldn't change nervous systems with that man for the largest fortune that could be offered me," [...] thought the doctor as he took the <b>boat's</b> <b>tiller,</b> and gave the oarsmen their order to push off from the wreck.|$|R
50|$|Due to the wide, flat bottom, a {{centerboard}} was provided. Early <b>boats</b> used a <b>tiller</b> for steering, but as patent {{steering gear}} became available, the wheel came into use instead.|$|R
5000|$|Rapid or {{excessive}} {{movement of}} the tiller results {{in an increase in}} drag and will result in braking or slowing the boat. In steering a <b>boat,</b> the <b>tiller</b> is always moved in the direction opposite of which the bow of the boat is to move. If the tiller is moved to port side (left), the bow will turn to starboard (right). If the tiller is moved to starboard (right), the bow will turn port (left). Sailing students often learn the alliterative phrase [...] "Tiller Towards Trouble" [...] to remind them of how to steer.|$|R
50|$|The {{barn door}} style rudder is like Finn. Early rudders had a tang mounted to the forward edge that {{prevented}} the rudder from detaching should the <b>boat</b> capsize. Wood <b>tiller</b> mounted into a stainless rudder head {{bolted to the}} rudder. Kick-up versions are rare and made with a cast aluminum upper trunk and the rudder is shorter than the standard, with a spring mounted pin which, when pulled, allows the rudder to tilt up 90 degrees, generally white fiberglass construction.|$|R

2500|$|Rowing oars {{set aside}} for {{steering}} appeared on large Egyptian vessels long before the time of Menes (3100 BC). In the Old Kingdom (2686 BC-2134 BC) as much as five steering oars are found {{on each side of}} passenger <b>boats.</b> The <b>tiller,</b> at first a small pin run through the stock of the steering oar, {{can be traced to the}} fifth dynasty (2504–2347 BC). Both the tiller and the introduction of an upright steering post abaft reduced the usual number of necessary steering oars to one each side. Apart from side-rudders, single rudders put on the stern can be found in a number of tomb models of the time, particularly during the Middle Kingdom when tomb reliefs suggests them commonly employed in Nile navigation. The first literary reference appears in the works of the Greek historian Herodot (484-424 BC), who had spent several months in Egypt: [...] "They make one rudder, and this is thrust through the keel", probably meaning the crotch at the end of the keel (see right pic [...] "Tomb of Menna").|$|R
60|$|Billy {{clung to}} his father, {{and looked at the}} captain in {{speechless}} horror. Even Gaff himself felt an overpowering sense of dread creep over him, for he now knew that he had to deal with a raving maniac. Not knowing what to do, he sat still and silent in the stern of the <b>boat</b> with the <b>tiller</b> in his hand, and his eyes fixed immovably on those of the madman, who seemed to feel that it was a trial as to which should stare the other down, for he soon gave up singing and drinking, and devoted all his energies of body and soul to glaring at his enemy.|$|R

[...] "A more {{equitable}} bargain cannot be made, when the assets are of equal value. Here is encouragement, in good sooth; and now, Master Mariner, we will land and proceed to the Lust in Rust, which must be the place meant in the verses. 'What's yet behind,' must be Alida, the tormenting baggage! who has been playing hide-and-seek with us, {{for no other reason}} than to satisfy her womanish vanity, by showing how uncomfortable she could make three grave and responsible men. Let the <b>boat</b> go, Master <b>Tiller,</b> since that is thy name; and many thanks for thy civilities." ...|$|R
50|$|While {{on their}} trips, Z {{continues}} to stall with production of Mr. Trepid's map, as he probably feels more protective {{of the kids}} because he believes that Dallas and Florida are really his biological children because the Carters' mother named on the birth certificate was his wife. Eventually he gives Mr Trepid a map with possible hiding places, but takes the understone funds {{to prevent them from}} being stolen from Mr. Trepid. On Tiller and Florida's small trip while rafting down a river, their <b>boat</b> capsizes and <b>Tiller</b> suffers a heart attack. Luckily, Dallas, Sairy, and Z find them and Tiller is taken to a hospital where he recovers. Z starts bonding with the twins and they set up traps for Mr. Trepid while he looks for the understone funds and fails to find them.|$|R
2500|$|Little Slackwater was {{a tricky}} place to navigate. Not {{only did it}} {{have a lot of}} hairpin turns, but also just before Guard lock #5, there was a strip of land in the water called [...] "the pier" [...] : loaded boats going {{downstream}} would have to go outside the pier, and unloaded boats on the inside, thus making steering difficult for the loaded boats to get into the lock. If the current was fast in the river it could go as fast as the <b>boat,</b> rendering the <b>tiller</b> useless, and thus, a boat could be almost impossible to steer. One man reported that at the slackwater, they had him sit {{at the front of the}} boat with a hatchet in case they had to cut the towline , and had a couple of [...] hatches turned upside down, so that they could escape to shore on the hatches. On 1 May 1903, the towline to Boat No. 6 broke, with Captain Keim, Mrs. Keim, their two daughters, and Harry Newkirk aboard. One daughter drowned, another suffered a broken leg, and the captain died later of injuries. The rest (including the mules aboard) survived.|$|R
5000|$|There are regular sailing {{regattas}} {{on national}} holidays which are contested by locally built and designed boats. These regattas do {{not conform to}} international sailing rules with regard to right of way. Instead, there is only one rule, known as the [...] "hard lee" [...] rule. (The name derives from the motion required to tack a <b>tiller</b> <b>boat,</b> which is to push the tiller [...] "hard to leeward"). In the event that two boats on opposite tacks are on a collision course, {{one or both of the}} captains may elect to call [...] "hard lee" [...] to the other. When this call is made, both boats must tack regardless of whether it is advantageous or not. The objective of this manoeuvre is to attempt to gain as much distance upwind as possible before having to tack to avoid a collision. Alternatively, one captain may decide to [...] "draw" [...] and either tack earlier or change his point of sail to avoid the manoeuvre. This means a loss in height, but it may be preferable to tacking towards a shallow reef or other unfavourable position.|$|R

40|$|Fundamentals of {{ergonomics}} {{applied to}} helm stations of <b>boats.</b> From the <b>tiller</b> hinged on the stern, {{up to the}} steering wheel introduced by the great Vessels, {{depending on the type}} of vessel to which it refers, may also profoundly change the requirements of good ergonomics of a helm station. The develop of marine engineering knowledge has led to the development of ever-increasing size of vessels; so, the solution of a traditional tiller would become inconsistent with the figure of the helmsman, therefore a single man would not have been able to control properly. To do this, the solution was introduced through chains and ropes, pulleys referrals through appropriate scaling, by leading the rudder to the steering wheel. In doing so, any vessel, however large, could be ruled by one man. From sea to air or land the steering wheel is an application derived from the marine “rudder wheel”, which can be traced back to the sixteenth century. Nowadays, however, the traditional tiller still exists and is highly appreciated for boats -usually small and light- designed following the priority for simple, reliable and efficient solutions. The spread of boats of larger size, has described the adoption of a fairly standard setting, designed to meet ergonomic requirements for the functional control of the boat, in the most direct and efficient way. The introduction of modern technologies, for transfer the control signals and monitoring, have developed interesting application of these "drive by wire", totally innovative if compared to traditional mechanical technologies. Even more interesting are the "Wi-Fi" or "blue-tooth" solutions, now entering the market. Today times, to control the movement of a large vessel through a joystick is one of the most proven and reliable solutions. Moreover, the modern technology allows applications of remote controls able to drive a boat from anywhere, even from outside the boat itself, like in a videogame. This introduces new and different ergonomic problems...|$|R
