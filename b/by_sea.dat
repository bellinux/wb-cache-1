5|$|After {{wintering}} in {{the western}} coastlands of Asia Minor, the Arab army crossed into Thrace in early summer 717 and built siege lines to blockade the city, which was protected by the massive Theodosian Walls. The Arab fleet, which accompanied the land army and was meant to complete the city's blockade <b>by</b> <b>sea,</b> was neutralized soon after its arrival by the Byzantine navy {{through the use of}} Greek fire. This allowed Constantinople to be resupplied <b>by</b> <b>sea,</b> while the Arab army was crippled by famine and disease during the unusually hard winter that followed. In spring 718, two Arab fleets sent as reinforcements were destroyed by the Byzantines after their Christian crews defected, and an additional army sent overland through Asia Minor was ambushed and defeated. Coupled with attacks by the Bulgars on their rear, the Arabs were forced to lift the siege on 15 August 718. On its return journey, the Arab fleet was almost completely destroyed by natural disasters and Byzantine attacks.|$|E

5|$|Edwards's fortifications {{were tested}} in 1294 when Madog ap Llywelyn rebelled against English rule, the first major insurrection since the conquest. The Welsh appear to have risen up over the {{introduction}} of taxation, and Madog had considerable popular support. By {{the end of the}} year, Edward had returned to Wales with a large army and marched west from Chester, reaching his castle at Conwy by Christmas. Here he was trapped and besieged until January 1295, supplied only <b>by</b> <b>sea,</b> before forces arrived to relieve him in February. Harlech was also besieged but was saved from defeat by the arrival of supplies <b>by</b> <b>sea</b> from Ireland. Caernarfon, however, was still only partially completed and was stormed by Welsh forces and the castle and town set alight. In Anglesey, Welsh forces killed the royal sheriff. In the spring Edward pressed home his counterattack with a force of 35,000 soldiers, putting down the uprising and killing Madog.|$|E
