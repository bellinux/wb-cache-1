Never was {{the arrival of a}} comet watched by astronomers who had {{calculated}} its advent with more anxiety than was the appearance of the young Duke. Never did man pass through such dangers. It was the fiery ordeal. St. Anthony himself was not assailed by more temptations. Now he was saved from the lustre of a blonde face by the superior richness of a <b>blonde</b> <b>lace.</b> He would infallibly have been ravished by that ringlet had he not been nearly reduced by that ring which sparkled on a hand like the white cat's. He was only preserved from his unprecedented dangers by their number. No, no! He had a better talisman: his conceit.|$|E
50|$|<b>Blonde</b> <b>lace</b> {{became very}} popular, and {{replaced}} Mechlin lace. It is very soft, and thus was {{well suited to}} the gathered trimmings fashionable during the nineteenth century. <b>Blonde</b> <b>lace</b> was used by royalty, and was worn in the portraits of the daughter of George IV, Princess Charlotte in 1817, and of Queen Adelaide in 1830. In 1805 <b>blonde</b> <b>lace</b> was popular in Paris.|$|E
50|$|There {{was a lot}} of <b>blonde</b> <b>lace</b> made in Spain, {{mostly in}} the Catalonia region, and {{especially}} in Barcelona. It had all the same qualities as <b>blonde</b> <b>lace</b> made elsewhere, with very large flowers. It was used mainly for mantillas and scarfs and became part of the archetypical image of a Spanish lady.|$|E

50|$|<b>Blonde</b> <b>lace</b> is a {{continuous}} bobbin lace from France {{that is made}} of silk. The term blonde refers to the natural color of the silk thread. Originally this lace was made with the natural-colored silk, and later in black. Most <b>blonde</b> <b>lace</b> was also made in black. It {{was made in the}} 18th and 19th centuries. The pattern, which is generally of flowers, is made with a soft silk thread, thicker than the thread used for the ground. This causes a big contrast between the flowers and the ground. It uses the same stitches as Chantilly lace and Lille lace, and is similarly made in strips 5 inches wide and invisibly joined. <b>Blonde</b> <b>lace</b> is not as good as Chantilly lace though, as the ground isn't as firm, nor is the pattern as regular.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Blonde</b> <b>lace</b> {{was made}} in Caen from 1744, in parts of Flanders, in Barcelona, and, in small quantities, in the east Midlands of England from about 1806. [...] It didn't suffer when other lacemakers were reduced {{to the brink of}} ruin in 1821 to 1832 by the {{introduction}} of machine-made bobbin net. In fact, the demand for blonde actually increased, and Caen exported great quantities, by smuggling, to England. It was one of the earliest laces to be copied by machine- in 1833 the traverse warp machine (invented in 1811) made it for a full season, and it was sold without saying it was machine-made, at handmade prices, with no one the wiser. By 1840 <b>blonde</b> <b>lace</b> was out of favor.|$|E
50|$|Chantilly lace {{is known}} for its fine ground, {{outlined}} pattern, and abundant detail. The pattern is outlined in cordonnet, a flat untwisted strand. The best Chantilly laces were made of silk, and were generally black, which made them suitable for mourning wear. White Chantilly lace was also made, both in linen and silk, though most Chantilly laces were made of silk. The black silk Chantilly lace became especially popular, and there was a large market for it in Spain and the Americas. Chantilly and the Spanish laces (such as <b>Blonde</b> <b>lace)</b> were the most popular black laces. Little white Chantilly was ever made. Another notable thing about Chantilly lace is the use of a half-and-whole stitch as a fill to achieve the effect of light and shadow in the pattern, which was generally of flowers. The background, or r√©seau, was {{in the form of a}} six pointed star, and was made of the same thread as the pattern, unlike the otherwise similar <b>Blonde</b> <b>lace.</b> The lace was produced in strips approximately four inches wide, and then joined with a stitch that left no visible seam.|$|E
