50|$|<b>Bumetanide</b> (trade names Bumex or Burinex) is a loop {{diuretic}} of the sulfamyl category, {{most often used}} to treat heart failure. It is often used in people in whom high doses of furosemide or other diuretics are ineffective. It is marketed by Hoffmann-La Roche. The main difference between <b>bumetanide</b> and furosemide is in their bioavailability and potency. About 60% of furosemide is absorbed in the intestine, and there are substantial inter- and intraindividual differences in bioavailability (range 10-90%). About 80% of <b>bumetanide</b> is absorbed, and its absorption does not change when it is taken with food. It {{is said to be}} a more predictable diuretic, meaning that the predictable absorption is reflected in a more predictable effect.|$|E

50|$|<b>Bumetanide,</b> 3-butylamino-4-phenoxy-5-sulfamoylbenzoic acid, is {{synthesized}} from 4-chlorobenzoic acid. In {{the first}} stage of synthesis, it undergoes sulfonylchlorination by chlorosulfonic acid, forming 4-chloro-3-chlorosulfonylbenzoic acid, which is further nitrated with nitric acid to 4-chloro-3-chlorosulfonyl-5-nitrobenzoic acid. Reacting this with ammonia gives 5-aminosulfonyl-4-chloro-3-nitrobenzoic acid, which when reacted with sodium phenolate is transformed into 5-amino-sulfonyl-3-nitro-5-phenoxybenzoid acid. Reduction of the nitro group in this product by hydrogen using a palladium on carbon catalyst gives 3-amino-5-aminosulfonyl- 5-phenoxybenzoic acid. Finally, reacting this with butyl alcohol in the presence of sulfuric acid gives the desired <b>bumetanide.</b>|$|E

50|$|Acute {{cardiogenic}} {{pulmonary edema}} often responds rapidly to medical treatment. Positioning upright may relieve symptoms. Loop diuretics such as furosemide or <b>bumetanide</b> are administered, often together with morphine or diamorphine to reduce respiratory distress.

50|$|On October 24, 2008, ESPN {{reported}} that four NFL players were being suspended under the steroid policy {{as a result}} of taking <b>bumetanide.</b> It is sometimes used for weight loss because, as a diuretic, it removes water, but it also masks other drugs, including steroids, by diluting the contents of the user's urine, yielding a lower concentration of filtered substances, which makes them less likely to be detected.|$|E
50|$|CCC family {{proteins}} can catalyze NaCl/KCl symport, NaCl symport, or KCl symport {{depending on}} the system. The NaCl/KCl symporters are specifically inhibited by <b>bumetanide</b> while the NaCl symporters are specifically inhibited by thiazide. One member of the CCC family, the thiazide-sensitive NaCl cotransporter (NCC) of man is involved in 5% of the filtered load of NaCl in the kidney. Mutations in NCC cause the recessive Gitelman syndrome. NCC is a dimer in the membrane. It is regulated by RasGRP1.|$|E
5000|$|Certain {{types of}} diuretics are {{associated}} with varying levels of risk for ototoxicity. Loop and thiazide diuretics carry this side effect. The loop diuretic furosemide is associated with ototoxicity, particularly when doses exceed 240 mg per hour. The related compound ethacrynic acid has a higher association with ototoxicity, therefore it is preferred only for patients with sulfa allergies. Diuretics are thought to alter the ionic gradient within the stria vascularis [...] <b>Bumetanide</b> confers a decreased risk of ototoxicity compared to furosemide.|$|E

50|$|Some {{medications}} may reversibly affect hearing. These medications {{are considered}} ototoxic. This includes loop diuretics such as furosemide and <b>bumetanide,</b> non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) both over-the-counter (aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen) {{as well as}} prescription (celecoxib, diclofenac, etc.), paracetamol, quinine, and macrolide antibiotics. The link between NSAIDs and hearing loss tends to be greater in women, especially those who take ibuprofen six or more times a week. Others may cause permanent hearing loss. The most important group is the aminoglycosides (main member gentamicin) and platinum based chemotherapeutics such as cisplatin and carboplatin.|$|E
50|$|Once {{the person}} is stabilized, {{attention}} can be turned to treating pulmonary edema to improve oxygenation. Intravenous furosemide is generally the first line. However, people on long-standing diuretic regimens can become tolerant, and dosages must be progressively increased. If high doses of furosemide are inadequate, boluses or continuous infusions of <b>bumetanide</b> may be preferred. These loop diuretics may be combined with thiazide diuretics such as oral metolazone or intravenous chlorothiazide for a synergistic effect. Intravenous preparations are physiologically preferred because of more predictable absorption due to intestinal edema, however, oral preparations can be significantly more cost effective.|$|E
5000|$|Because furosemide, torsemide and <b>bumetanide</b> are {{technically}} sulfa drugs, {{there is}} a theoretical risk that patients sensitive to sulfonamides may be sensitive to these loop diuretics. This risk is stated on drug packaging inserts. However, the actual risk of crossreactivity is largely unknown {{and there are some}} sources that dispute the existence of such cross reactivity. [...] In one study it was found that only 10% of patients with allergy to antibiotic sulfonamides were also allergic to diuretic sulfonamides, but it is unclear if this represents true cross reactivity or the nature of being prone to allergy.|$|E
50|$|Diuretics, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} ‘water pills’, are drugs which draw excess fluid from the tissues {{of the body}} and convert it into urine. They are used for the swelling and bloating of premenstrual syndrome, for treating high blood pressure and, in older people, for heart failure caused by weakening of the heart’s pumping mechanism. Diuretics are used to pass drug test because they increase the amount of urine produced by the body. By increasing the amount of urine, it dilutes any drugs in the urine, which makes it harder to identify drugs. Examples of diuretics and masking agents are: <b>bumetanide,</b> chlorothiazide, furosemide, hydrochlorothiazide, probenecid, spironolactone (canrenone), triameterene, and trichlormethiazide.|$|E
50|$|Piretanide (INN, {{trade names}} Arelix, Eurelix, Tauliz) has been {{synthesized}} in 1973 at Hoechst AG (Germany) as a loop diuretic compound {{by using a}} then-new method for introducing cyclic amine residues in an aromatic nucleus {{in the presence of}} other aromatically bonded functional groups. Studies of piretanide in rats and dogs in comparison with other high-ceiling diuretics such as furosemide and <b>bumetanide</b> found a more suitable dose/response rate (regression line) and a more favourable sodium/potassium excretion ratio. These findings led eventually to clinical studies in man and finally to the introduction as a saluretic and antihypertensive medication in Germany, France, Italy and other countries.|$|E
50|$|On December 2, 2008, Smith {{was one of}} {{six players}} {{suspended}} for use of <b>Bumetanide</b> a diuretic, {{which can be used}} as a masking agent for steroid use. It is believed that the diuretic was found in StarCaps, a weight-loss supplement that he had been taking. Smith's original punishment was announced as a four-game suspension, covering the final four games of the 2008 regular season. Enforcement of the suspension was delayed as other players challenged the decision through federal and state courts, and the league allowed all players involved in the matter to continue playing pending a final resolution of the case. Smith's suspension was later reduced to a two games and an additional two lost paychecks, and was served at the beginning of the 2011 NFL season.|$|E
50|$|Since salt {{restriction}} is {{the basic}} concept in treatment, and aldosterone {{is one of the}} hormones that acts to increase salt retention, a medication that counteracts aldosterone should be sought. Spironolactone (or other distal-tubule diuretics such as triamterene or amiloride) is the drug of choice since they block the aldosterone receptor in the collecting tubule. This choice has been confirmed in a randomized controlled trial. Diuretics for ascites should be dosed once per day. Generally, the starting dose is oral spironolactone 100 mg/day (max 400 mg/day).40% of patients will respond to spironolactone. For nonresponders, a loop diuretic may also be added and generally, furosemide is added at a dose of 40 mg/day (max 160 mg/day), or alternatively (<b>bumetanide</b> or torasemide). The ratio of 100:40 reduces risks of potassium imbalance. Serum potassium level and renal function should be monitored closely while on these medications.|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{potency of}} {{intravenous}} <b>bumetanide</b> to furosemide using {{a ratio of}} 1 : 40 has been suggested; however, there are little data supporting this ratio. Recent drug shortages required the use of <b>bumetanide</b> in a large patient population, enabling further characterization of the efficacy of IV <b>bumetanide.</b> Objective: The primary objective {{of this study was}} to estimate a dose-response effect of IV <b>bumetanide</b> on urine output (UOP) in all patients that received 48 hours of therapy as well as in a subgroup of patients with heart failure (HF). This subgroup was used to compare the potency of <b>bumetanide</b> with furosemide. A secondary safety objective described electrolyte replacement required during therapy. Methods: This was a single-center retrospective study examining the dose-response effect of IV <b>bumetanide</b> in patients receiving at least 48 hours of intermittent (iIV) or continuous (cIV) dosing, measured by UOP per mg of drug received (mL/mg). The potency of IV <b>bumetanide</b> was compared with furosemide in a subset of patients with HF using pre-existing data. The safety of IV <b>bumetanide</b> was analyzed by quantifying electrolyte replacement received during the study period. Results: The primary outcome was higher in the iIV group (n= 93) at 1273 ± 844 mL/mg compared with the cIV group (n= 16) at 749 ± 370 mL/mg (P= 0. 002). Among patients with HF who received furosemide (iIV n= 30, cIV n= 26) or <b>bumetanide</b> (iIV n= 30, cIV n= 3), a potency ratio of 41 : 1 was found for the iIV group and 34 : 1 for all patients with HF. There was no significant difference in electrolyte replacement between groups. Conclusion: A greater response was seen with intermittent <b>bumetanide</b> compared with continuous infusion <b>bumetanide.</b> This study supports the 40 : 1 dose equivalence ratio (furosemide:bumetanide) in patients with HF receiving at least 48 hours of intravenous intermittent <b>bumetanide...</b>|$|E
40|$|Seizures are a {{prevalent}} neurodevelopmental {{disorder that}} affect up to 5 / 1000 newborns. Seizures result in detrimental developmental outcomes for many neonates, including mortality, disability and epilepsy. Current antiepileptic treatments, such as phenobarbital, display poor efficacy rates. Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) -mediated signalling may promote excitatory neurotransmission in neonates with a birth injury due to intracellular accumulation of chloride. <b>Bumetanide</b> {{is a potential}} adjunct treatment for neonatal seizures, which reduces intracellular chloride concentrations by inhibiting the sodium-potassium-chloride cotransporter NKCC 1. This accelerates the excitatory to inhibitory switch in GABA neurotransmission. In vitro bidirectional permeability assays {{were used to determine}} the apparent permeability of <b>bumetanide</b> and the potential for <b>bumetanide</b> efflux by organic anion transporter 3 (OAT 3). <b>Bumetanide</b> was found to be a transported efflux substrate of human OAT 3, thus OAT 3 inhibition is a potential therapeutic augmentation strategy. OAT 3 inhibition was investigated in vivo using an integrated intracerebral microdialysis model for the potential to augment <b>bumetanide</b> concentrations in the brain. <b>Bumetanide</b> was detected in brain extracellular fluid and this concentration increased after probenecid administration. An in vivo model of hypoxic-ischaemic neonatal seizures was established to quantify the pharmacodynamic effect of <b>bumetanide</b> in seizures. OAT 3 inhibition enhanced the concentration of <b>bumetanide</b> in the brain in this model. Seizure burden in these animals was reduced significantly by phenobarbital and <b>bumetanide</b> and decreased further when an OAT 3 inhibitor was administered. Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic modelling was employed to predict plasma and brain concentrations of <b>bumetanide</b> in a virtual neonatal population. The simulated brain tissue concentrations of <b>bumetanide</b> in neonates were below the half-maximal inhibitory concentration for the target transporter NKCC 1. However, large interindividual variability and a paucity of physiological limited the accuracy of these simulations. In summary, augmentation strategies that focus on preventing <b>bumetanide</b> efflux from the brain via OAT 3 may contribute to an improved outcome for neonates with seizures...|$|E
