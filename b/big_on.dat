5|$|Nintendo's {{attorney}} (and future board member) Howard Lincoln was {{at first}} inclined to settle for $5–7 million. Eventually, however, he decided to fight, reassuring {{the head of the}} company's U.S. division, Minoru Arakawa, that this was a sign that Nintendo had made it <b>big.</b> <b>On</b> May 6, Arakawa and Lincoln met with Coleco and Universal in Los Angeles. Hadl reiterated his stance that Donkey Kong infringed Universal's rights to King Kong. Lincoln countered that Nintendo had discovered many unlicensed uses of King Kongs name and characters and that Universal's trademark on these was less than 10 years old. In private, Greenberg tried to persuade Nintendo to sign a licensing agreement; he had not told them that he had already done so. By the end of the meeting, Hadl agreed to send a chain of title to Nintendo regarding Universal's ownership of the King Kong name. When this failed to materialize in the next few weeks, Lincoln prodded Universal again. They responded with more demands for royalties.|$|E
5|$|The eight 8-inch {{guns were}} mounted in pairs in four wing turrets {{placed on the}} superstructure. Their arc of fire, {{although}} <b>big</b> <b>on</b> paper, was in reality limited. Adjacent gun positions and superstructure would be damaged by their muzzle blast if the gun was trained alongside it, a defect also suffered by the 13-inch guns. The smaller 6-inch guns were mounted in twin wing casemates midships on the main deck level, with a 6-pounder in between. The other Hotchkiss 6-pounders lined the superstructure and bridge decks. Four of the 1-pounders were placed in hull casemates at the bow and stern {{of the ship and}} two more in the fighting tops of the masts. In 1908, all the 6-inch and most of the lighter guns were removed to compensate for the counterweights added to the main battery and because ammunition supply for the guns was considered problematic. A year later, twelve /50-caliber single-purpose guns were added midships and in the fighting tops.|$|E

The movie could have used some of the bowels-of-the-city grit Sidney Lumet brought to Q." [...] Dave Kehr, also writing for the Chicago Tribune, stated, [...] "Though it's a handsome film, carefully staged and courageously low-key, {{the transition to the}} screen only exaggerates the disposable nature of the material while depriving it of the novel's one stylistic strength, its unreliable narrator." ...|$|E

Cincinnati lost the next two games, and speculation began that the Reds were losing on purpose to extend the series and increase gate revenues. However, Cincinnati won Game Eight, 10–5, to end the series, as Williams lost his third game (Cicotte lost the other two).

Noted for his deceptive slow deliveries, dropping mid-flight and <b>big</b> <b>on</b> break, Wills' fast round arm balls sometimes reared head-high from the pitch, terrorising his opponent. English batsman Sir David Serjeant said that Wills was the only bowler he ever feared. He was known to carefully study an umpire before deciding whether to throw. A trickster, he would ask the umpire to watch his feet lest he go over the crease, and then [...] "let go a throw for all he was worth". His most flagrant throws were likened to that of a baseball pitcher.|$|E

[...] Jason Lipshultz from Billboard stated the song [...] "leans upon sunny electronica" [...] that sounds <b>big</b> <b>on</b> the chorus, where Gaga sings [...] "I'm {{on the edge of}} glory and I'm hanging on a moment of truth". Evan Sawdey of the website PopMatters found several rock elements in the composition of the song. Vena also felt that what made the song stand out from others on the radio was the saxophone solo by Clemons {{right in the middle of}} the track, as Gaga belts out, [...] "I'm on the edge with you." [...] Robert Copsey from Digital Spy said that the musical composition is a mixture of loud-sounding electric guitars and club-beat influenced synths. The song and album ends with a long coda, with the sound of the saxophone fading out.|$|E
500|$|The largest {{facility}} {{in this area}} of the park is The Marketplace – International Buffet, originally called All's Well Hall.

In the park's opening season guidebook, the facility is listed as selling [...] "bratwurst, sausages, beef and mushroom pie, smoked sausage, grilled frankfurter, sauerkraut, mashed potatoes, soft pretzels, pastries, with beer, wine, coffee, tea, milk, and soft drinks." [...] The self–serve restaurant had table service on request, and seated 528; Ginza Gardens in Grande Exposition of 1890 was the only other restaurant in the park with table service. A review of the restaurant in The Toronto Star describes the facility as the park's flagship eatery, but it received mixed reviews. [...] "The $2.50 beef and mushroom pie has a good crust and as much beef as potato. Tiny mushrooms, but <b>big</b> <b>on</b> flavor." [...] Conversely, 50 cent pretzels [...] "are strictly for teething tots –too cheewy." [...] The Marketplace currently serves an all–you–can–eat buffet, self described as [...] "upscale", offering meats like roast beef and fried chicken, pasta, a salad bar, a desert station, varied international cuisine, and other options.

Despite liking actor Lance Reddick, Wigler was displeased with his character's increased screentime, believing Broyles works better as an [...] "enigmatic figure". Wigler did however praise the villain's [...] "murderous method of choice", writing [...] "Those who've read my Fringe reviews know that I'm not <b>big</b> <b>on</b> the mystery-of-the-week element, but I have to give this episode some credit for at least making it look good." [...] IGN's Ramsey Isler rated the episode 8.0/10, noting the [...] "great work" [...] done with the CGI and props {{while at the same time}} acknowledging the opening was not [...] "particularly exciting". Isler praised Reddick's performance, but continued [...] "besides the Broyles characterization, this episode kind of fell flat. The plot unfolds slowly, and the first sixty percent of this episode is kind of a yawner. The only things that really spice up the story are Walter's antics (which are very amusing, as usual). The monster of the week, an alien stowing away in a Russian cosmonaut's body, isn't all that scary or even malevolent (it's just trying to stay alive by feeding on radiation)." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Lose My Breath" [...] {{was written}} by Beyoncé, Kelly Rowland, Michelle Williams, Rodney [...] "Darkchild" [...] Jerkins, Fred Jerkins, Sean Garrett, LaShawn Daniels and Jay-Z. The {{production}} of the song was handled by Jerkins, Beyoncé, Rowland and Garrett. Record producer Jerkins, who had previously collaborated with the group for [...] "Say My Name" [...] (2000), had worked on [...] "Lose My Breath" [...] without informing Destiny's Child. Beyoncé and Williams heard the drum instrumentation of the track and they enjoyed it with the latter feeling that the song was nothing like the mainstream radio sound. They went to their band mate Kelly Rowland presenting the song. Alongside Jerkins, the group asked for help from American rapper Jay-Z who immediately created a chorus including the lines [...] "Can you keep up" [...] without hearing the track. The group took his chorus and wrote the verses and bridge around it. During an interview with Complex, Garrett recalled the time he worked with Williams on the song, saying, [...] "There was so much magic {{going on in the}} studio. We probably recorded all the songs in about a month and every day it was a new song coming out. 'Lose My Breath' was towards {{the latter part of the}} album and that was an amazing song that we felt could not only be <b>big</b> <b>on</b> the radio but big with bands and marching bands.

500|$|There {{are several}} {{fundamental}} {{differences between the}} film and the original source material. For example, the comic {{is set in the}} 1990s, while the film is set sometime between 2028 and 2038: Alan Moore's original story was created as a response to British Thatcherism in the early 1980s and was set as a conflict between a fascist state and anarchism, while the film's story has been changed by the Wachowski [...] Brothers to fit a modern US political context. Alan Moore, however, charged that, in doing so, the story has turned into an American-centric conflict between liberalism and neo-conservatism, and abandons the original anarchist–fascist themes. Moore states that [...] "here wasn't a mention of anarchy as far as I could see. The fascism had been completely defanged. I mean, I think that any references to racial purity had been excised, whereas actually, fascists are quite <b>big</b> <b>on</b> racial purity." [...] Furthermore, in the original story, Moore attempted to maintain moral ambiguity, and not to portray the fascists as caricatures, but as realistic, rounded characters. The time limitations of a film meant that the story had to omit or streamline some of the characters, details, and plotlines from the original story. Chiefly, the original graphic novel has the fascists elected legally and kept in power through the general apathy of the public, whereas the film introduces the [...] "St. Mary's virus", a biological weapon engineered and released by the Norsefire Party as a means of clandestinely gaining control over their own country.|$|E
