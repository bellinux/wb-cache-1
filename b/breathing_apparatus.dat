5|$|The {{ability to}} dive and swim {{underwater}} while holding one's breath {{is considered a}} useful emergency skill, {{an important part of}} water sport and Navy safety training, and an enjoyable leisure activity. Underwater diving without <b>breathing</b> <b>apparatus</b> can be categorised as underwater swimming, snorkelling and freediving. These categories overlap considerably. Several competitive underwater sports are practised without <b>breathing</b> <b>apparatus.</b>|$|E
5|$|In ambient {{pressure}} diving, the diver is directly {{exposed to the}} pressure of the surrounding water. The {{ambient pressure}} diver may dive on breath-hold, or use <b>breathing</b> <b>apparatus</b> for scuba diving or surface-supplied diving, and the saturation diving technique reduces the risk of decompression sickness (DCS) after long-duration deep dives. Atmospheric diving suits (ADS) may be used to isolate the diver from high ambient pressure. Crewed submersibles can extend depth range, and remotely controlled or robotic machines can reduce risk to humans.|$|E

The band members' heads were each submerged in water bubbles attached to <b>breathing</b> <b>apparatuses</b> {{for the duration}} of the performance, with lead singer Damian Kulash completely submerged in a tank of water.|$|R
5|$|The {{breathing}} gas mixtures {{appropriate to}} a dive depend {{to a large}} extent on the maximum depth and the decompression obligations incurred by the planned duration of the dive and the time spent at each depth. The quantity of gases required for scuba will depend on the time spent at each depth, the breathing rate of the diver, the type of <b>breathing</b> <b>apparatus</b> to be used, and reasonable allowances for contingencies.|$|E
5|$|In {{the decade}} {{following}} World War II, Lambertsen et al. made further discoveries {{on the effects}} of breathing oxygen under pressure and methods of prevention. Their work on intermittent exposures for extension of oxygen tolerance and on a model for prediction of pulmonary oxygen toxicity based on pulmonary function are key documents in the development of standard operating procedures when breathing increased pressures of oxygen. Lambertsen's work showing the effect of carbon dioxide in decreasing time to onset of central nervous system symptoms has influenced work from current exposure guidelines to future <b>breathing</b> <b>apparatus</b> design.|$|E
5|$|Search {{teams were}} sent {{from the lower}} floors and searched the 30th floor, but did not find the missing firefighters. The teams then moved onto the upper levels where one team got lost on the 38th floor {{and ran out of}} air in their {{self-contained}} <b>breathing</b> <b>apparatus</b> (SCBA). That team was rescued by a search team that had been placed on the roof by a helicopter. Rescue attempts continued until helicopter operations were suspended due to heavy smoke and thermal drafts caused by the blaze.|$|E

They are equipped with hoses and pumps, and <b>breathing</b> <b>apparatuses.</b>|$|R
5|$|The caves are {{the site}} of the first cave dives in Britain which were {{undertaken}} by Jack Sheppard and Graham Balcombe. Since the 1930s divers have explored the extensive network of chambers developing <b>breathing</b> <b>apparatus</b> and novel techniques in the process. The full extent of the cave system is still unknown with approximately , including 25 chambers, having been explored. Part of the cave system opened as a show cave in 1927 following exploratory work by Herbert E. Balch. As a tourist attraction it has been owned by Madame Tussauds and, most recently, the circus owner Gerry Cottle. The cave is noted for the Witch of Wookey Hole– a roughly human shaped stalagmite that legend says is a witch turned to stone by a monk from Glastonbury. It has also been used as a location for film and television productions.|$|E
5|$|Divers {{operate in}} an {{environment}} for which {{the human body is}} not well suited. They face special physical and health risks when they go underwater or use high pressure breathing gas. The consequences of diving incidents range from merely annoying to rapidly fatal, and the result often depends on the equipment, skill, response and fitness of the diver and diving team. The hazards include the aquatic environment, the use of breathing equipment in an underwater environment, exposure to a pressurised environment and pressure changes, particularly pressure changes during descent and ascent, and breathing gases at high ambient pressure. Diving equipment other than <b>breathing</b> <b>apparatus</b> is usually reliable, but has been known to fail, and loss of buoyancy control or thermal protection can be a major burden which may lead to more serious problems. There are also hazards of the specific diving environment, and hazards related to access to and egress from the water, which vary from place to place, and may also vary with time. Hazards inherent in the diver include pre-existing physiological and psychological conditions and the personal behaviour and competence of the individual. For those pursuing other activities while diving, there are additional hazards of task loading, of the dive task and of special equipment associated with the task.|$|E
5|$|The {{next step}} is to apply hair. The hair can either be done in one of two ways; wigging, rooting or microrooting. when rooting hair is added 1-4 hair strands per plug. When microrooting, hair is added strand by strand. This can take up to 30 or more hours per head. Once the hair is finished, the {{original}} vinyl body is weighted with a soft stuffed body filled with pellets/fine glass beads/fiberfill.The weight corresponds with its age to achieve a real effect. Various additions also can be added to give the doll an even more life like appearance. Reborns heads are often weighted, so that owners have to support the head like one would a real newborn. Purchasers can have magnets attached inside the mouth or head for attaching a pacifier or hair bows. Electronic devices that mimic a heart beat, or make the chest rise and fall to simulate breathing are common. Reborns can come with an umbilical cord, baby fat, heat packs to make the reborn warm to the touch, or voice boxes that mimic infant sounds. For preemie dolls, they may come in incubators with a <b>breathing</b> <b>apparatus</b> attached to their nose.|$|E
50|$|Underwater {{ice hockey}} (also called sub-aqua ice hockey) {{is a minor}} extreme sport that is a variant of ice hockey. It is played {{upside-down}} underneath frozen pools or ponds. Participants wear diving masks, fins and wetsuits and use {{the underside of the}} frozen surface as the playing area for a floating puck. Competitors do not utilize any <b>breathing</b> <b>apparatuses,</b> but instead surface for air every 30 seconds.|$|R

5|$|DNK {{carried out}} tests {{with the system}} in 2010 for firefighters using {{self-contained}} <b>breathing</b> <b>apparatus</b> in structure fires, and found the system to be sufficient. Similar test were carried out by Oslo Fire Department later that year, and {{they found that the}} radio system was insufficient for their needs. Oslo Fire Department concluded that the DNK tests were only successful because of the use of additional directional gateway/repeater-radio equipment. Because of this firefighters in Oslo continued to use the old ultra-high frequency radios during indoor fires. Both the Norwegian Police Security Service's bodyguard service and the service for protection of the royal family have opted to not use the new radio system, citing poor coverage indoors and while lying on the ground, even in downtown Oslo. The services have stated that this does not allow for interoperability with other agencies, which is a drawback in case of major incidents. Also the joint rescue coordination centers, the Norwegian Air Ambulance and the 330 Squadron which operates Westland Sea King search and rescue helicopters have opted out of using the system because of poor coverage. During the 2011 Norway attacks at Utøya, located in northern Buskerud, police officers from surrounding police districts were not able to communicate with local police because the area did not have coverage for the TETRA system.|$|E
25|$|The FROST is {{designed}} to integrate the features of two existing support vehicles, the <b>Breathing</b> <b>Apparatus</b> Tender and the Damage Control Tender. FROST combines {{the capabilities of the}} two and has ventilation equipment, <b>breathing</b> <b>apparatus</b> and search equipment, among other features. It halves the manpower needed to for these functions from eight to four.|$|E

50|$|Asphyxiation: Underwater Ice Hockey is {{typically}} played without a <b>breathing</b> <b>apparatuses.</b> Only supervising divers wear oxygen tanks while playing; apnea divers wear diving masks for visibility. To prevent {{loss of consciousness}} {{due to lack of}} oxygen, players are switched every thirty to sixty seconds. Supervising safety divers can assist an apnea diver if they are unable to reach the surface before losing consciousness. So far the safety teams have been able to retrieve everyone.|$|R
50|$|The {{style and}} color of a clone troopers armor often varies {{depending}} on their rank, specialization, unit, or environment, for example, the clone troopers on Kashyyyk wear camouflage green scout-style armour whereas the 501st legion wears standard white armor with blue accents. Another example is the aquatic SCUBA troopers, who appear in the animated series Star Wars: Clone Wars. SCUBA troopers are equipped with high-tech <b>breathing</b> <b>apparatuses</b> and long range blaster rifles.|$|R
25|$|By {{the turn}} of the twentieth century, two basic {{architectures}} for underwater <b>breathing</b> <b>apparatus</b> had been pioneered; open-circuit surface supplied equipment where the diver's exhaled gas is vented directly into the water, and closed-circuit <b>breathing</b> <b>apparatus</b> where the diver's carbon dioxide is filtered from unused oxygen, which is then recirculated. Closed circuit equipment was more easily adapted to scuba in the absence of reliable, portable, and economical high pressure gas storage vessels.|$|E

They have methane suits {{that allow them to}} remove the <b>breathing</b> <b>apparatuses</b> they usually wear to sustain them in a non-methane atmosphere. In Halo Reach, if a player kills a Grunt in a particular way, their methane tank will ignite causing them to fly and bounce around the area out of control, causing damage if they hit the player.|$|R
40|$|Working on NASA {{missions}} allows {{engineers and}} scientists to hone their skills. Creating devices for the high-stress rigors of space travel pushes designers to their limits, {{and the results}} often far exceed the original concepts. The technologies developed for the extreme environment of space are often applicable here on Earth. Some of these NASA technologies, for example, have been applied to the <b>breathing</b> <b>apparatuses</b> worn by firefighters, the fire-resistant suits worn by racecar crews, and, most recently, the deep-sea gear worn by U. S. Navy divers...|$|R
50|$|Firefighters and {{emergency}} service workers use full face masks that provide breathing air {{as well as}} eye and face protection. These masks are typically attached to a tank carried upon {{the back of the}} wearer and are called self-contained <b>breathing</b> <b>apparatuses</b> (SCBA). Open circuit SCBAs do not normally supply oxygen, as it is not necessary and constitutes a fire hazard. Rebreather SCBAs usually supply oxygen as this is the lightest and most compact option, and uses a simpler mechanism than other types of rebreather.|$|R
25|$|In the 1920s, sport {{spearfishing}} without <b>breathing</b> <b>apparatus</b> {{became popular}} on the Mediterranean coast of France and Italy. This spurred {{the development of}} modern swimfins, diving masks and snorkels.|$|E
25|$|The {{defining}} {{equipment used}} by a scuba diver is the eponymous scuba, the self-contained underwater <b>breathing</b> <b>apparatus</b> which allows the diver to breathe while diving, and is transported by the diver.|$|E

Class 6 {{will have a}} range of 100 nmi (185 km) at 4 knots down to 50 m, but on the surface the diesel will give it a maximum speed of 20 kn. There will be built-in breathing sets for divers to conserve their underwater <b>breathing</b> <b>apparatuses.</b>|$|R
50|$|Enhanced {{equipment}} for first responders. One recent advancement is {{the commercialization of}} {{a new form of}} Tyvex™ armor which protects first responders and patients from chemical and biological contaminants. There has also been a new generation of Self-Contained <b>Breathing</b> <b>Apparatuses</b> (SCBA) which has been recently made more robust against bioterrorism agents. All of these technologies combine to form what seems like a relatively strong deterrent to bioterrorism. However, New York City as an entity has numerous organizations and strategies that effectively serve to deter and respond to bioterrorism as it comes. From here the logical progression is into the realm of New York City’s specific strategies to prevent bioterrorism.|$|R
