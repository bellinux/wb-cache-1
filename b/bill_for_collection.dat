40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the demand for}} import documentary credit in Lebanon. Five explanatory variables are selected that stand respectively for risk, price, size, conjecture, and availability of credit. As expected, the long run elasticities are {{significantly higher than the}} short run ones. Risk has an adverse impact. Interest rate elasticities, or price elasticities, are all negative and statistically significant except <b>for</b> <b>bills</b> <b>for</b> <b>collection</b> which are paid in cash at presentation of the shipping documents, and that do not depend on the interest rate. Size and conjectural elasticities are all positive and statistically significantly different from zero. As expected, the availability of credit is only important for opened and utilized letters of credit and not for outstanding documentary credit and <b>bills</b> <b>for</b> <b>collection.</b> In the long run risk, price, and conjectural elasticities are all statistically insignificantly different from one in absolute values, but, surprisingly, long run size elasticities are statistically significantly less than + 1. The paper concludes that the determinants of the demand for import documentary credit in Lebanon {{are similar to those of}} the demand for any other good or asset...|$|R

Cataloged from PDF version of Internship report. Includes bibliographical references (page 72). The internship report is designed to bridge the gulf between the theoretical knowledge and real life experience. It is designed to have a practical experience while passing through the theoretical understanding. I {{had the opportunity to}} complete my internship in a reputed bank. This report is the result of three months internship program with Prime Bank Limited, Banani branch. Bank is an intermediary institution that makes relationship between the owner of surplus savings and the investors of deficit capital. As the demand for the better service increases day by day, banking process is becoming faster and easier and banks are coming up with different innovative ideas and products. As an intern, I have worked in the General Banking (GB) department and have learned to do tasks like Issuing of Cheque Book, Cheque receive, Maintaining IBCA register, Fund Transfer, Cheque Debit, TT (Telegraphic Transfer), Pay Order and some other related tasks. I have also gained some practical knowledge about LBC (Local <b>Bills</b> <b>for</b> <b>Collection),</b> OBC (Outward <b>Bills</b> <b>for</b> <b>Collection),</b> DD (Demand Draft), inward and outward clearing functions, various reasons of dishonoring of Cheques and different savings scheme offered by this bank. Customer service quality is very important for a bank as lots depend on this and to evaluate PBL's customer service quality I have prepared a questionnaire and have taken fifty respondents answers and used SPSS software to analyze their responses. According to the respondents, Prime Bank Limited is a reputed bank; however they have rated it as number two bank among six private commercial banks. This shows lacking in marketing efficiency that does not been able to create a positive image to customers mind. PBL can do some CSR (Corporate Social Responsibilities) to improve its image. It has sixty three branches across Bangladesh; of them forty one are online. Respondents argue that PBL should introduce online facility throughout all of its branches and also should train its employees so that they can provide more faster and accurate service. In addition, respondents demand that FDR interest rate should be increased as PBL offers lower interest rate than that of some other private commercial banks. Most of the respondents are happy with the behavior of GB employees of PBL. With all its resources, the management of the bank should seek more ways to improve customer service quality so that the bank can create good image among its customers which ultimately will help it to grow faster and stay ahead of competition.

Of the water that has been billed, only about 73% was collected in 2002/03 in Ahwaz, while it was higher in Shiraz.|$|R

2500|$|Significantly, {{the foreign}} companies, despite the large {{value of their}} contracts, are only {{required}} to recycle 20 percent of the waste that they collect; the remaining 80 percent are placed into landfills. In contrast, the Zabbaleen recycle up to 80 {{percent of all the}} MSW that they collect. The foreign companies collected the trash from garbage bins placed at central collection points on the streets. However, many inhabitants of Cairo preferred the door-to-door garbage pick-up done by the Zabbaleen, especially because the bins were not plentifully located or located in inconvenient places. Thus, residents expressed their discontent with the new system, especially because they were being charged more for {{what seemed to be a}} more inconvenient system. Under the new system, residents were required to pay a monthly <b>bill</b> <b>for</b> garbage <b>collection</b> that accompanies their electricity bill. The garbage collection fee was based upon the percentage of each electricity bill so that the garbage collection fee increases proportionately to electricity consumption. Two years after the new system was imposed, Rashed writes in the Al-Ahram Weekly, [...] "residents of the governorate have been voicing increasingly vociferous complaints that the companies are working well below full capacity. The streets are not as clean as they were during the first days of the privatisation. Both company workers, and garbage receptacles, appear to be increasingly thin on the ground." ...|$|R
