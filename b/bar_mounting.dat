50|$|The {{operation}} for both barrels {{is housed in}} a single receiver. This is a single forging, milled to house the two separate actions. The magazine opening is {{cut out of the}} top of the receiver, the ejection slot out of the bottom. Each action has its own back plate. The gas piston group action is based on ZB vz. 26 design. The bolt is a steel forging well machined. The gas cylinder tube is constructed of seamless steel tubing and is threaded to the receiver at the rear. The trigger assembly is made up of two separate sear assemblies riveted to the pistol grip framework. Two pistol grips are located about 6 inches apart, the sears are connected to a horizontal trigger <b>bar</b> <b>mounting</b> a trigger on either end. Both guns may be fired by depressing either trigger. The magazine is the saddle-drum magazine type. Each side holds 50 rounds and feeds one gun. Each side has its own spring so that, {{in the event of a}} jam affecting one barrel, the other gun may continue to fire.|$|E

5000|$|Soap bar casing has true {{rectangular}} {{shape and}} the mounting screws are {{contained within the}} coil perimeter, positioned between the pole pieces, between {{the second and third}} strings and between the fourth and fifth strings, thus creating an irregular and somewhat unusual pattern. Occasionally they are mistaken for pole pieces, thus sometimes the P-90 is erroneously said to have eight pole pieces. The [...] "soap bar" [...] nickname most probably comes from its predominantly rectangular shape and proportions, {{and the fact that the}} first P-90s on the original Gibson Les Paul Model of 1952 were white. A variant of the Soap-Bar P-90 is one, which uses the [...] "dog ear" [...] mounting plate, or frame, but the [...] "soap bar" [...] cover. The reason for the variation was to mount the pickup from a flat overlaying pickguard, such as is found on the Gibson SG Special (and other SG guitars using P-90's). The [...] "dog ear" [...] mounting plate is fitted with screws and springs, that attach it to the flat pickguard and allow the pickup to hang within the body rout. The soap bar cover is used, and the soap <b>bar</b> <b>mounting</b> screws are used to affix the cover to the dog ear plate.|$|E

50|$|A {{well-known}} type of assisted takeoff is {{an aircraft}} catapult.

50|$|The bar {{resists the}} torsion through its {{stiffness}}. The stiffness of an anti-roll bar {{is proportional to}} the stiffness of the material, the fourth power of its radius, and the inverse of the length of the lever arms (i.e., the shorter the lever arm, the stiffer the bar). Stiffness is also related to the geometry of the mounting points and the rigidity of the <b>bar's</b> <b>mounting</b> points. The stiffer the bar, the more force required to move the left and right wheels relative to each other. This increases the amount of force required to make the body roll.|$|R
