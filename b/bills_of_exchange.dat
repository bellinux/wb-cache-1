40|$|The {{concept and}} types <b>of</b> <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> The topic <b>of</b> this thesis is "The concept and types <b>of</b> <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> exchange". The reason for {{choosing}} this topic {{has been my}} interest in <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> law, which was awaken by my own experience with a <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> {{on one hand and}} by the gripping seminars of subject called "Bills of Exchanges", which is taught at the Faculty of Social Sciences of the Charles University in Prague, on the other hand. The aim of the thesis is to characterize the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> and promissory note, to define their basic characteristics, to explain, what kind of them exist and to analyze their basic requirements. The thesis is composed of six chapters. The first chapter discusses the history <b>of</b> <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> and promissory note. It is divided into three sections that deal with the origin and both national and international development <b>of</b> <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> law. The second chapter is devoted to the current legislation <b>of</b> <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> law. It introduces the sources <b>of</b> <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> law and relations between them and the most specific characteristics <b>of</b> the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> law, which is rigor cambialis.

40|$|The <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> {{is a kind}} {{of paper}} in order that its holder shall entitle the debtor named in the {{document}} to pay a certain amount <b>of</b> payments. The <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> represents a means of payment and an instrument of providing the payment. It is an unconditional order given by the drawer to the drawee to pay a certain amount to the payee listed on the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange.</b> The <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> is generally a paper on the orders but it can be issued as value paper to a name. It is such promissory notes where the issuer becomes a clause not by order. The <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> though it appears as a means of payment and an instrument for securing the payment it also appears as a means of international payment, because the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> can become a modern instrument of crediting and payment. With the development of the credit market and the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> becomes a means for the drawer and the drawee. This means that instead <b>of</b> the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> to be paid after the expiry of a certain deadline for submission <b>of</b> the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> the holder may sell or discount, or to pay before the deadline for submission. With this the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> becomes a toll for discount. Based on this we can conclude that the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> has the following roles: -bill <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> serves as a means of credit; -bill <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> serves as means of payment; -bill <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> serves as a means for discount by. ...|$|R

The difference between the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> and the promissory note is an unconditional order to pay a determinate sum of money by drawer to drawee, which is characteristic for the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> exchange; whereas the promissory note is characterized by an unconditional promise to pay a determinate sum of money by drawer. The rest of essentials, except for the name of drawee logically, are the same. These essential are the term "bill of exchange" incorporated in the body <b>of</b> the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> in the same language as a text <b>of</b> the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange,</b> maturity, place <b>of</b> payment, name of payee, place and date <b>of</b> drawing a <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> and signature <b>of</b> drawer.

5|$|Upon the {{development}} of international trade, the elementary principles of credit and banking were developed. Both Jewish and Italian merchants had regular banking agents in Syria, who transacted business {{on behalf of their}} masters. <b>Bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> were also used by them in their dealings with one another and money was deposited in various banking centers throughout Syria. The encouragement of trade and industry provided the Ayyubid sultans with the funds needed for military expenditure as well as for developmental and everyday lifestyle works. Special attention was made to the economic state of the empire under al-Adil and al-Kamil. The latter maintained a strict control over expenditure; it is said that on his death he left a treasury which was equivalent to the budget of one full year.|$|E
5|$|Southern Rhodesia {{effectively}} {{became the}} entirety of Rhodesia in 1964 when Northern Rhodesia became independent as Zambia. After Southern Rhodesia's colonial government unilaterally declared independence from Britain on 11 November 1965, the anniversary became celebrated as Independence Day. The penultimate Monday in October was designated Republic Day in 1970 following {{the adoption of a}} republican system of government. All of these holidays were celebrated until 1979, when Rhodesia reconstituted itself under majority rule as the unrecognised state of Zimbabwe-Rhodesia. The country's national holidays were replaced soon after with alternatives intended to be more inclusive: President's Day, Unity Day and Ancestors' Day. These were in turn superseded in April 1980, when the country became the recognised state of Zimbabwe. The modern Zimbabwean holiday calendar differs radically from that of Rhodesia, but retains every one of the traditional holidays defined by name in the 1895 <b>Bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>Exchange</b> Regulations, with the exception of Whit Monday.|$|E
5|$|Through its Global Trade Finance Program, the IFC {{guarantees}} trade payment {{obligations of}} more than 200 approved banks in over 80 countries to mitigate risk for international transactions. The Global Trade Finance Program provides guarantees to cover payment risks for emerging market banks regarding promissory notes, <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange,</b> letters of credit, bid and performance bonds, supplier credit for capital goods imports, and advance payments. The IFC issued $3.46 billion in more than 2,800 guarantees in 2010, of which over 51% targeted IDA member nations. In its fiscal year 2011, the IFC issued $4.6 billion in more than 3,100 guarantees. In 2009, the IFC launched a separate program for crisis response, known as its Global Trade Liquidity Program, which provides liquidity for international trade among developing countries. Since its establishment in 2009, the Global Trade Liquidity Program assisted with over $15 billion in trade in 2011.|$|E

25|$|In 1609, King Philip III, {{upon the}} advice of his {{financial}} adviser the Duke of Lerma and Archbishop of Valencia Juan de Ribera, decreed the Expulsion of the Moriscos. Hundreds of thousands of Moriscos were expelled, some of them probably sincere Christians. This was further fueled by the religious intolerance of Archbishop Ribera who quoted the Old Testament texts ordering the enemies of God to be slain without mercy and setting forth the duties of kings to extirpate them. The edict required: 'The Moriscos to depart, under the pain of death and confiscation, without trial or sentence... to take with them no money, bullion, jewels or <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange....</b> just what they could carry.' Although initial estimates of the number expelled such as those of Henri Lapeyre reach 300,000 Moriscos (or 4% of the total Spanish population), the extent and severity of the expulsion in much of Spain has been increasingly challenged by modern historians such as Trevor J. Dadson. Nevertheless, the eastern region of Valencia, where ethnic tensions were high, was particularly affected by the expulsion, suffering economic collapse and depopulation of much of its territory.|$|E
