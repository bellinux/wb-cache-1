A Badal optical system was used to present either an isolated 20 / 50 Snellen E or 20 / 50 lines of text, with the full text field used in the latter condition for all <b>blur</b> judgments. Eight visually normal adult myopes were tested with paralyzed accommodation.

However, {{there was no significant}} effect of <b>blur</b> adaptation on <b>blur</b> thresholds for the 20 / 50 text, with large intersubject variability evident. The enhanced <b>blur</b> sensitivity for the isolated E target may in part be attributed to the increased visual resolution following <b>blur</b> adaptation.

40|$|Images {{acquired}} by airborne sensors exhibit <b>blur</b> due to turbulent motion {{experienced by the}} aircraft. Significant amount of <b>blur</b> renders the images unusable for subsequent visual/automated analysis, requiring a re-flight. This necessitates quantifying the amount of <b>blur</b> in an image. Most approaches to <b>blur</b> quantification use image based methods to estimate the MTF (Modular Transfer Function) that indicates the amount of <b>blur.</b> Their limitations are – (1) MTF calculation requires presence of straight edges in the image scene, which {{may not always be}} available, (2) Due to the absence of an ideal edge, the amount of <b>blur</b> estimated is relative, and (3) It is computationally expensive and therefore may not be practical for <b>blur</b> detection in real time applications. Our solution uses the sensor motion as measured by an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) mounted in the camera system to calculate the motion experienced by the aircraft and the sensor during the time the shutter was actually open. This motion information together with the <b>blur</b> detection algorithm presented in this paper can provide an accurate quantification of <b>blur</b> in pixel units. Once we identify the images that exceed a given <b>blur</b> threshold, we use a <b>blur</b> removal algorithm that uses the IMU data and a natural image prior to compute per-pixel, spatially-varying <b>blur,</b> and then de-convolves an image to produce de-blurred images.
