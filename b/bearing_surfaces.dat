25|$|Many {{long-term}} {{problems with}} hip replacements {{are the result}} of osteolysis. This is the loss of bone caused by the body's reaction to polyethylene wear debris, fine bits of plastic that come off the cup liner over time. An inflammatory process causes bone resorption that may lead to subsequent loosening of the hip implants and even fractures in the bone around the implants. In an attempt to eliminate the generation of wear particles, ceramic <b>bearing</b> <b>surfaces</b> are being used in the hope that they will have less wear and less osteolysis with better long-term results. Metal cup liners joined with metal heads (metal-on-metal hip arthroplasty) were also developed for similar reasons. In the lab these show excellent wear characteristics and benefit from a different mode of lubrication. At the same time that these two <b>bearing</b> <b>surfaces</b> were being developed, highly cross linked polyethylene plastic liners were also developed. The greater cross linking significantly reduces the amount of plastic wear debris given off over time. The newer ceramic and metal prostheses do not always have the long-term track record of established metal on poly bearings. Ceramic pieces can break leading to catastrophic failure. This occurs in about 2% of the implants placed. They may also cause an audible, high pitched squeaking noise with activity. Metal-on-metal arthroplasty releases metal debris into the body raising concerns about the potential dangers of these accumulating over time. Highly cross linked polyethylene is not as strong as regular polyethylene. These plastic liners can crack or break free of the metal shell that holds them.|$|E

[...] If the bullets have to travel a varying distance from {{the case to the}} point where they engage the rifling, then this can result in variations in pressure and velocity.

40|$|AbstractThe {{main reasons}} for {{decreased}} service times of selected nitrided and CrN coated dies were revealed and explained. Results of analysis of wear on industrial dies were combined with results obtained in laboratory wear tests. The main influential parameters in this study refer to contact pressure, die design, length of <b>bearing</b> <b>surface,</b> quality of nitrided layer, surface preparation prior coating and maintenance. It was found that lower quality of nitrided layer in combination with short <b>bearing</b> <b>surface</b> and occurrence of increased contact pressure close to exit edge of <b>bearing</b> <b>surface</b> can considerably decrease die service time and that appropriate shaping of die contours around inlet and outlet areas of <b>bearing</b> <b>surface</b> has decisive influence on die service time...|$|R
25|$|To combat {{loosening}} {{caused by}} polyethylene wear debris, hip manufacturers developed improved and novel {{materials for the}} acetabular liners. Ceramic heads mated with regular polyethylene liners or a ceramic liner were the first significant alternative. Metal liners to mate with a metal head were also developed. At the same time these designs were being developed, the problems that caused polyethylene wear were determined and manufacturing of this material improved. Highly crosslinked UHMWPE {{was introduced in the}} late 1990s. The most recent data comparing the various <b>bearing</b> <b>surfaces</b> has shown no clinically significant differences in their performance. Potential early problems with each material are discussed below. Performance data after 20 or 30 years may be needed to demonstrate significant differences in the devices. All newer materials allow use of larger diameter femoral heads. Use of larger heads significantly decreases the chance of the hip dislocating, which remains the greatest complication of the surgery.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the main}} {{problems}} with joint replacements is wear of the <b>bearing</b> <b>surfaces</b> of components. [...] This can lead to damage to surrounding bone and contribute to eventual failure of the implant. [...] Use of alternative <b>bearing</b> <b>surfaces</b> has increased in recent years, particularly in younger patients, {{in an attempt to}} improve the wear characteristics of joint replacement components. [...] These include ceramics and all-metal implants (as opposed to the original metal-on-plastic).

40|$|In this {{contribution}} {{some important}} reasons for decreased service time of selected nitrided and coated dies for Al extrusion are explained. The influences of contact pressure, length of <b>bearing</b> <b>surface,</b> nitriding conditions {{and of the}} preparation of inlet edge of <b>bearing</b> <b>surface</b> at PVD CrN coating were studied. Laboratory tests of the wear at lower and increased contact pressure and {{an analysis of the}} wear on industrial dies were carried out. The die design and the flow of the extruded material should lead to a decrease of the contact pressure on the <b>bearing</b> <b>surface.</b> Two different modes of the initial wear progress on the area at the exit edge of the <b>bearing</b> <b>surface</b> were observed. Despite good adhesional and other relevant characteristics of CrN coating, the analysis revealed that inappropriate construction of the initial edge of the die <b>bearing</b> <b>surface</b> in combination with the maintenance of the die seems to be the main reasons for a considerably decreased service time of these dies as expected...|$|R

2500|$|Hip {{dysplasia}} {{is often}} cited as causing osteoarthritis of the hip at a comparatively young age. [...] Dislocated load <b>bearing</b> <b>surfaces</b> lead to increased and unusual wear. [...] Although there are studies that contradict these findings. [...] (see [...] ) Peri-acetabular osteotomy (PAO) surgery {{can be used to}} realign the hip joint in some adolescents and adults. Subsequent treatment with total hip arthroplasty (hip replacement) is complicated by a need for revision surgery (replacing the artificial joint) owing to skeletal changes as the body matures, loosening/wear or bone resorption. Hip resurfacing is another option for correcting hip dysplasia in adults. It is a type of hip replacement that preserves more bone, and may work for younger hip dysplasia patients.|$|E
