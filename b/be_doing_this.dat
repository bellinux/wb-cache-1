In late November 1986, drummer Lombardo quit the band; he said: [...] "I wasn't making any money. I think I had just gotten married, and I figured if we were gonna <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> professionally—on a major label—I wanted my rent and utilities paid."

He believed that his experience, combined with his efforts in Iowa would make up for his lack of funds. Thompson proclaimed to Pajamas Media {{that he would be}} [...] "shocked" [...] if he did not win the straw poll, and in his own personal analysis of the race, commented: [...] "I wouldn't say Romney's in trouble, but I'd say I think it's going to be between Romney and myself."

500|$|Despite {{the success}} of the past films, the future of the {{franchise}} was put into question as all three lead actors were unsure about signing on to continue their roles for the final two films. However, by March 2007, Grint agreed to return for the last instalments. For financial and scripting reasons, the last book was divided into two films which were shot back to back, with filming concluding in June 2010. After completing the final film he said: [...] "I mean it literally has been my childhood and suddenly it all came down to really just one random scene, with us jumping through a fireplace, and then it was over. [...] But because you shoot out of sequence, it's often just 'Turn left, cross the room, okay, that's a wrap.' And you're done. [...] Yeah, it's very odd. Because suddenly it was all over, just like that. It was really emotional for all of us, realising that we're never going to <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> again.|$|E
500|$|The songwriting session—held at Absolute's studio {{located on}} Tagg's Island near Chertsey—did {{not seem to}} go well at the beginning, as the duo was heavily into R music at the time, while the group {{according}} to Wilson was [...] "always very poptastic". After two sessions the duo phoned their managers {{and told them that}} the musical association between them and the group was not working. At this point, the duo heard [...] "Wannabe" [...] for the first time, Wilson remembers: [...] "We listen to it, and we didn't get it at all. It was so different to what we were doing. We thought, 'How's this gonna work? We're not the right people to <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> band.'" [...] For the next session the group wanted to write something uptempo and a bit more fun. A full-on disco backing track came up, and [...] "Who Do You Think You Are" [...] evolved from there. Wilson commented about that session: ...|$|E
500|$|In October 1986, Slayer {{embarked}} on the Reign in Pain world tour, with Overkill in the US, and Malice in Europe.

I figured {{if we were}} gonna <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> professionally, on a major label, I wanted my rent and utilities paid." [...] To continue with the tour, Slayer enlisted Tony Scaglione of Whiplash. However, Lombardo was convinced by his wife to return in 1987. At the insistence of Rubin, Slayer recorded a cover version of Iron Butterfly's [...] "In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida" [...] for the film Less Than Zero. Although the band was {{not happy with the}} final product, Hanneman deeming it [...] "a poor representation of Slayer" [...] and King labeling it [...] "a hunk of shit," [...] it was one of their first songs to garner radio airplay.|$|E

2500|$|In August 2009, José Mourinho again {{found himself}} causing {{controversy}} after commenting that Muntari, a practicing Muslim, was lacking fitness and energy due to fasting {{during the month}} of Ramadan.

Ramadan has not arrived at the ideal moment for a player to play a football match." [...] However, since these comments, many Muslims and non-Muslims have come out in defence of Mourinho, saying that no offense was meant towards the player, but while the manager could have been more tactful in his treatment of the issue {{it stands to reason that}} a lack of food and water will affect a player's stamina and energy level.|$|E
2500|$|Panic! at the Disco went {{on record}} many times {{saying that the}} group's second album would be {{completely}} different from A Fever You Can't Sweat Out, as Rolling Stone wrote in an article: [...] "The group cemented its next direction with their first single, called [...] "Nine in the Afternoon". [...] "It's influenced by the music our parents listened to: the Beach Boys, the Kinks, the Beatles," [...] says Ross. [...] "Our new songs are more like classic rock than modern rock. We got older and started listening to different music– and this seems like the natural thing to do right now." [...] Pretty. Odd. {{has been described as}} being like [...] " [...] dropping the entire Beatles catalog into a blender, adding some modern alternative ice and the horn section from Sonia Dada, then churning out a new-millennium Liverpool smoothie." [...] In his review of the band's live album, Stephen Thomas Erlewine noted, [...] "...Pretty. Odd. suggests that they're becoming that rare thing in 2008: a pop-oriented rock band.

2500|$|In the mid-1980s, Natalie Cole {{recorded}} [...] "Pink Cadillac" [...] at {{the suggestion}} of producer Dennis Lambert; Cole recalls: [...] "I thought to myself, 'I'm too old to <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> kind of stuff', but then I'd never worked with anyone quite like Dennis before. He was very passionate about his work [...] his enthusiasm gave me the confidence that I could pull [...] off." [...] The track was intended for an album release on the Modern label; that project was canceled and Cole's [...] "Pink Cadillac" [...] and another Lambert production: [...] "I Live For Your Love", were picked up by EMI-Manhattan Records to appear on Cole's 1987 album Everlasting. [...] "Pink Cadillac" [...] was released as that album's third single in March 1988, returning Cole to the Top Ten {{for the first time since}} 1978 in April 1988 to ascend to a #5 peak - matching Cole's previous Pop chart best with [...] "I've Got Love on My Mind" [...] - that May. Cole's [...] "Pink Cadillac" [...] also reached #9 R, #16 A/C and - via a remix by David Cole (no relation) and Robert Clivilles - #1 on Billboard Hot Dance Club Play chart. According to Cole, [...] "word got back" [...] to her that Bruce Springsteen [...] "thought it was very cool that a woman could [...] and it would come out so great".

2500|$|Responding to such {{criticism}} Popović said in early 1994: [...] "Well, I'm a lawyer, so technically yes, I am committing {{an act of}} treason under Serbian laws. But I distinguish between {{the interests of the}} Serbian state and the Serbian people and I think these interests are opposed at this moment. The military defeat of the Milošević government {{is in the best interest}} of the Serbian people. It is something that every good Serbian patriot should wish for. I don't think I betrayed my people". Pressed further to clarify his position on the ramifications of such an act such as an implication that a violent foreign intervention can solve certain political problems, like the problem of an armed Serb secession from Bosnia-Herzegovina, or from Croatia, as well as his position on the inevitable civilian death toll if such an action is to occur, Popović said: [...] "I think that's an unfair question. If I see somebody trying to murder somebody else, of course my duty is to try to stop him. I'm not saying that by doing so and applying violence to the situation, I'm actually trying to help those people lead a good life. I don't know what they will do once they leave the scene. What I see Serbs doing in Bosnia is committing an act of aggression against a state that has been recognized by United Nations, and I see them committing genocide. I think that both of these things should be stopped. Of course, stopping it would not solve the problem of how these people will live next to each other in the future, but first you have to stop the crimes. The international community has an obligation to do so, under the Genocide Convention and the United Nations Charter. They have an obligation to use force to stop aggression, and to stop genocide. In any armed conflict there will be civilian casualties. Unfortunately, that's something that can't be avoided. But I don't think that this fact should prevent the international community from doing what they are obliged to do under the international law: stopping the aggression, stopping the genocide. It sounds nice to advocate peaceful means, but it is not realistic. I return to this parallel: If you see some big guy beating a kid in the street, it would be very good if you could go to him and say 'Please stop this, you shouldn't <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> <b>this,</b> it is uncivilized. This poor guy cannot defend himself.' No, if that doesn't work, you call the police, who have to use violence. At this point in history you have to revert to violence to stop crime." [...] Asked whether he signed the particular petition because of the circumstances rather than principally thinking that such measures solve problems, Popović said: [...] "I'll go even further. I signed this document knowing perfectly well that this will never happen. I did it as a gesture to show that I realized who's the main culprit in the Yugoslav conflict. And I wanted to express my opinion that this government would deserve it, even though it will never happen".|$|E
