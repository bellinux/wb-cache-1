40|$|It is now {{commonly}} {{accepted that}} the unit disk graph used {{to model the}} physical layer in wireless networks does not reflect real radio transmissions, and that the lognormal shadowing model <b>better</b> <b>suits</b> <b>to</b> experimental simulations. Previous work on realistic scenarios focused on unicast, while broadcast requirements are fundamentally different and cannot be derived from unicast case. Therefore, broadcast protocols must be adapted in order to still be efficient under realistic assumptions. In this paper, we study the well-known multipoint relay protocol (MPR). In the latter, each node has to choose a set of neighbors to act as relays in order to cover the whole 2 -hop neighborhood. We give experimental results showing that the original method provided to select the set of relays does not give good results with the realistic model. We also provide three new heuristics in replacement and their performances which demonstrate that they <b>better</b> <b>suit</b> <b>to</b> the considered model. The first one maximizes the probability of correct reception between the node and the considered relays multiplied by their coverage in the 2 -hop neighborhood. The second one replaces the coverage by {{the average of the}} probabilities of correct reception between the considered neighbor and the 2 -hop neighbors it covers. Finally, the third heuristic keeps the same concept as the second one, but tries to maximize the coverage level of the 2 -hop neighborhood: 2 -hop neighbors are still being considered as uncovered while their coverage level is not higher than a given coverage threshold, many neighbors may thus be selected to cover the same 2 -hop neighbors...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{recently}} highlighted {{that the standard}} unit disc graph (UDG) used to model the physical layer in ad hoc networks does not reflect real radio transmissions, and that the log-normal shadowing (LNS) model <b>better</b> <b>suits</b> <b>to</b> experimental simulations. Therefore, many existing communication protocols must be adapted in order to still be efficient using the LNS model. In this paper, we consider broadcasting using this model and especially focus on the Multipoint Relay protocol (MPR).

New robust evidence is found that economic growth in Brazil was actually balance-of payments-constrained in the 1948 - 2004 period. However, unlike what intuition could lead one to expect a priori, the model specification that incorporates capital flows and external debt dynamics does not differ much from the original specification of Thirlwall´s Law regarding a softening of the external constraint. ...|$|R

5|$|Alternative {{theories}} {{have been proposed}} for the diet of aetosaurs. In 1947, H J Sawin proposed that the aetosaur Longosuchus was a scavenger based on the close proximity of some specimens to {{a large number of}} skeletons that were likely carcasses. A 2009 study of the jaw biomechanics of the South American genus Neoaetosauroides suggested that the animal may have fed on larvae and insects without hard exoskeletons. This is because Neoaetosauroides lacks serrations or wear facets on the teeth and has a jaw leverage that is not designed for strong forces such as crushing and chopping. The study recognized that northern aetosaurs such as Desmatosuchus and Stagonolepis did have jaws that would have supported a strong musculature, and were likely <b>better</b> <b>suited</b> <b>to</b> eating plant material.|$|E
5|$|At {{some point}} in their history, not clearly documented, horses bred in the western regions {{crossbred}} with horses that originated south of the Gulf of Finland.

The characteristics of the original western Finnish type prevailed, however, even though influenced by outside blood and traces of outside influence could be detected for a long time. Later, this mixed type was further crossbred with larger horses from Central Europe during the Middle Ages. Foreign horses were also brought to Finland during military campaigns, and additional animals were imported to manor houses for driving. The crossbreed offspring of Central European and Finnish horses were larger than their Finnish parents, and even more suited for agricultural work.|$|E

5|$|In January 1982, the U.S. Air Force awarded two {{contracts}} to Rockwell worth a combined $2.2 {{billion for the}} development and production of 100 new B-1 bombers. Numerous changes {{were made to the}} design to make it <b>better</b> <b>suited</b> <b>to</b> the now expected missions, resulting in the new B-1B. These changes included a reduction in maximum speed, which allowed the variable-aspect intake ramps to be replaced by simpler fixed geometry intake ramps in the newer design. This reduced the B-1B's radar signature or radar cross-section; this reduction was seen as a good trade off for the speed decrease. High subsonic speeds at low altitude became a focus area for the revised design, and low-level speeds were increased from about Mach0.85 to 0.92. The B-1B has a maximum speed of Mach1.25 at higher altitudes.|$|E
