Some advance presses can even be flushed with nitrogen to create a complete anaerobic environment that can be desired for wine making with white wine grapes. Additionally, many of today's modern presses are computerized, which allows the operator to control exactly how much pressure is being applied to the grape skins and for how many cycles.|$|R

5000|$|It {{would take}} {{close to two}} hundred years for gas to become {{accessible}} for commercial use. A Flemish alchemist, Jan Baptista van Helmont, {{was the first person}} to formally recognize gas as a state of matter. He would go on to identify several types of gases, including carbon dioxide. Over one hundred years later in 1733, Sir James Lowther had some of his miners working on a water pit for his mine. While digging the pit they hit a pocket of gas. Lowther took a sample of the gas and took it home to do some experiments. He noted, [...] "The said air being put into a bladder … and tied close, may be carried away, and kept some days, and being afterwards pressed gently through a small pipe into the flame of a candle, will take fire, and burn at the end of the pipe as long as the <b>bladder</b> is gently <b>pressed</b> to feed the flame, and when taken from the candle after it is so lighted, it will continue burning till there is no more air left in the bladder to supply the flame." [...] Lowther had basically discovered the principle behind gas lighting.|$|R
50|$|Lautering is the {{separation}} of the wort (the liquid containing the sugar extracted during mashing) from the grains. This is done either in a mash tun outfitted with a false bottom, in a lauter tun, or in a mash filter. Most separation processes have two stages: first wort run-off, during which the extract is separated in an undiluted state from the spent grains, and sparging, in which extract which remains with the grains is rinsed off with hot water. The lauter tun is a tank with holes in the bottom small enough to hold back the large bits of grist and hulls. The bed of grist that settles on it is the actual filter. Some lauter tuns have provision for rotating rakes or knives to cut into the bed of grist to maintain good flow. The knives can be turned so they push the grain, a feature used to drive the spent grain out of the vessel. The mash filter is a plate-and-frame filter. The empty frames contain the mash, including the spent grains, and have a capacity of around one hectoliter. The plates contain a support structure for the filter cloth. The plates, frames, and filter cloths are arranged in a carrier frame like so: frame, cloth, plate, cloth, with plates {{at each end of the}} structure. Newer mash filters have <b>bladders</b> that can <b>press</b> the liquid out of the grains between spargings. The grain does not act like a filtration medium in a mash filter.|$|R

This study reports 6 years of {{experience}} with vesicourethral anastomosis (VUA) following robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALP) performed in Taichung Veterans General Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan. MethodsA total of 350 patients who underwent RALP by a single surgeon were reviewed. We followed Dr Patel's RALP procedure with minor modifications. VUA was checked with 120  mL and 200  mL saline in sequence. The urinary <b>bladder</b> was then <b>pressed</b> with endoscopic instruments. If a VUA leak was detected, it was sutured immediately. An 18 -French silicon Foley's catheter was inserted and removed 7 – 14 days after RALP. Preoperative characteristics and perioperative complications were assessed. ResultsOverall, 332 (94. 85 %) patients were without any leakage in {{the first step of}} the challenge, eight of whom had leakage in the second step. After repair, all were free from leakage. The other 18 patients had leakage in the first step of the challenge (5. 14 %). After repair, 12 patients were without leakage in the second step. However, one patient had urine leakage postoperatively. The other six patients had leakage in the second step. After repair, two patients were free from leakage, but the remaining four suffered from persistent minor urine leakage postoperatively. The urine leakage rate after RALP was 1. 43 % (5 / 350). The potential urine leakage after bladder challenge and endoscopic instruments pressing could be minimized to 0. 29 % (1 / 346). ConclusionVUA leakage after RALP is rare. Intraoperative VUA challenge is simple and feasible compared to postoperative retrograde cystography...|$|R

5000|$|Throughout the 19th {{century and}} until 1960, Eiswein harvests were a rare {{occurrence}} in Germany. Only six 19th century vintages with Eiswein harvests have been documented, including 1858, the first Eiswein at Schloss Johannisberg. There {{seems to have}} been little effort to systematically produce these wines during this period, and their production was probably the rare result of freak weather conditions. It was the invention of the pneumatic <b>bladder</b> <b>press</b> which made the production of ice wine practical and led to a substantial increase in the frequency and quantity of production. 1961 saw the production of a number of German ice wines, and the wine increased in popularity in the following years. The production has also been assisted by other technological inventions in the form of electrical lighting driven by portable generators (to assist harvest in the cold hours of early-morning darkness, before the sun rises and the grapes can thaw), remotely controlled temperature alarms (after a re-thawing the grapes will spoil very quickly since ice crystals will have destroyed the cell walls; thus the harvest has to be completed within a few hours on the first morning that is cold enough) and plastic films that are used for [...] "packaging" [...] the vines during the waiting period between ripeness and first frost, {{in order to protect the}} ripe grapes from being eaten by birds.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2017 Brown marmorated stink bug (BMSB), (Halyomorpha halys, Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) is an {{invasive}} species that damages numerous agricultural crops including grapes. Related damage include lower berry weight with increased exposure and cracked berries {{as a result}} of BMSB feeding activity. The insect is currently detected in 43 US states including Oregon, Washington, California, and New York. The grape and wine industries in these areas hold significant economic value. BMSB damage has already resulted in major economic loss in the agricultural industry. Current data indicates that the infestation is spreading to new regions and its population density is increasing in regions where it has been detected. Surveys show BMSB in vineyards of Oregon, Virginia and New York where BMSB can damage grapes, lowering their yield and quality. When harvested with grape clusters, BMSB can introduce volatile compounds, trans- 2 -decenal and tridecane, into wine. Prior work has shown that the presence of these compounds alters wine sensory. In this thesis, the focus is on analyzing BMSB’s impact on wine quality and consumer preference. Additionally, this work determines the action threshold (AT) for BMSB in the vineyard, which is likely to prove important to the grape and wine industry in designing control limits and maintaining wine quality. The first contribution of this work establishes the sensory detection threshold (DT) and consumer rejection thresholds (CRT) for trans- 2 -decenal in red wine. Trans- 2 -decenal {{is one of the main}} aroma compounds in BMSB taint, having green, cilantro-like aroma characteristics that is undesirable in wine. Results conclusively show that trans- 2 -decenal in wine has a negative effect on its quality. In Pinot noir, consumers were able to perceive trans- 2 -decenal at 1. 92 µg/L (DT). Consumer preference for Pinot noir and Merlot containing trans- 2 -decenal decreased significantly above the concentration of 4. 8 µg/L (CRT). Pinot noir containing trans- 2 -decenal above CRT was described as green, herbal, musty and less fruity by wine professionals. Based on such findings, the use of CRT is recommended when establishing consumer tolerance levels of trans- 2 -decenal in wine. The second contribution relates BMSB presence in vineyard with sensory threshold of trans- 2 -decenal in the finished wine. Pinot noir, Merlot and Pinot gris were produced using different densities of BMSB in grape clusters. The results of this study indicate BMSB density of three per cluster can result in Pinot noir containing trans- 2 -decenal at its DT and below its CRT. This density can be used as AT for BMSB in the vineyard since wines made from grapes contaminated at or greater than 3 BMSB per cluster are likely to experience low preference by wine consumers. The same BMSB density can be used to devise control measures for Merlot since trans- 2 -decenal CRT was found to be similar for both Pinot noir and Merlot. Pinot gris was found to be free of trans- 2 -decenal even at BMSB density of 1 per cluster. Therefore, we believe that BMSB may not be a concern for white wines. The third contribution provides methods to reduce BMSB taint in finished wine. This can be done by modifying the winemaking process or by applying corrective measures in the wine. During winemaking, destemming and pressing were identified to be the steps responsible for increasing BMSB taint levels in wine whereas alcoholic fermentation decreases taint levels. Consequently, finished white wine was found to be free of trans- 2 -decenal since fermentation occurs after pressing. However, trans- 2 -decenal was present in finished red wine since pressing occurs after fermentation. Taint levels in finished red wine are also affected by different pressing variants (free run versus press fraction, <b>bladder</b> <b>press</b> versus basket press), with press fraction and <b>bladder</b> <b>press</b> introducing more BMSB taint compared to free run and basket press. This information will allow winemakers to adjust processing steps in order to minimize BMSB taint levels in red wines. Further reduction in taint levels was shown to be possible through the use of reverse osmosis filtration. Alternatively, oak addition can be used to mask the sensory attributes of trans- 2 -decenal at the risk of introducing spicy notes into wine. None of the other common fining agents tested were found to be effective against trans- 2 -decenal. Taken together, this thesis contributes a number of novel insights into the impact of BMSB on red and white wine. By relating consumer thresholds and descriptive analysis with chemical and wine processing, we are able to establish control densities for the pest in the vineyard, identify key processing steps and post-fermentation treatments to reduce BMSB taint. The information contained in this thesis is likely to prove valuable to the wine industry in its struggle against BMSB...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} we analyze {{the energy and}} {{environmental}} impacts of sheet metal manufacturing, focusing on the aerospace industry. The motivation of this work is {{the introduction of a}} new incremental sheet forming (ISF) technology called RAFFT, which substitutes heavy part specific dies for flexible generic tools but with a slower processing rate. The analysis has two sections. The first section analyzes the current aerospace sheet forming technological and economic landscape in order to determine RAFFT's probable adoption rate and predict which technologies it will displace. The second section includes four energy and lifecycle analysis (LCA) case studies on traditional forming technologies. The first section maps the process capabilities of twenty sheet forming technologies. It also describes the business needs and typical practices of the aerospace industry, including a classification of the different business needs for parts. We find that stretch forming and flexforming (also known as a <b>bladder</b> <b>press</b> or hydroforming) dominate current aerospace production, and superplastic forming SPF is used when high formability is required. Machining is used extensively for very low volume production, such as prototyping. We find that the new RAFFT technology is best suited for very low volume production such as the production of replacement parts. The second section includes energy and LCA case studies for titanium SPF, aluminum SPF, flexforming, and stretch forming. Moreover, case studies on kirksite and cast iron die manufacturing are completed because these materials are used in forming dies. We find that SPF uses more energy and has higher impacts than stretch and flexforming. We also find that each technology has high "baseload" (no forming) electricity use due to heat losses in SPF and circulation of hydraulic fluid in stretch and flexforming, meaning that cycle time is a critical factor in electricity use. Lastly, we find that the material for the blank, the die, and the electricity can each dominate impacts depending on the particular characteristics of each case because a) the aerospace industry is willing to invest significant resources, be it time, energy, or material, to produce the desired part and b) the required amount of blank, die, and electricity are dependent on uncorrelated factors. by Kathleen Eaton Rossie.
