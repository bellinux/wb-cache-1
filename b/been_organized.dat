5|$|An early-war Army {{anti-aircraft}} company (Flugabwehr-Kompanie) {{was organized}} in three platoons {{with a total}} of eighteen Sd.Kfz. 10/4s, twelve with guns and six carrying ammunition. When the four-barrel 2 cm Flakvierling 38 was fielded in 1941 each platoon had four Sd.Kfz. 10/4s towing the guns and another for ammunition. Later these companies were reorganized {{with a total of}} eight Sd.Kfz. 10/4s carrying guns, two towing Flakvierlings and three carrying ammunition. These are just examples of some of the Army organizations which differed depending on the unit and the period. Sd.Kfz. 10/5s were substituted for 10/4s on a one for one basis.

5|$|By 1944, the SS-TV had <b>been</b> <b>organized</b> {{into three}} divisions: {{staff of the}} {{concentration}} camps in Germany and Austria, in the occupied territories, and of the extermination camps in Poland. By 1944, it became standard practice to rotate SS members {{in and out of}} the camps, partly based on manpower needs, but also to provide easier assignments to wounded Waffen-SS members. This rotation of personnel meant that nearly the entire SS knew what was going on inside the concentration camps, making the entire organization liable for war crimes and crimes against humanity.|$|E

A replica of the original monument was constructed and dedicated in 2010, but disappeared within twenty-four hours of its inauguration.|$|E

By {{the end of the}} 18th century, the fur trade had <b>been</b> <b>organized</b> into groups of canoe-paddling voyageurs working for the competing North West and Hudson's Bay Companies, with a North West Company fort located at the Grand Portage on Lake Superior. The final rendezvous was held at Grand Portage in 1803, after which the North West Company moved its operations further north to Fort William (now Thunder Bay). In 1821 the North West Company merged with the Hudson's Bay Company and the center of the fur trade moved even further north to the posts around Hudson Bay.|$|E

5|$|In August 1944 Sayyid Abd al-Rahman {{met with}} senior Congress members and tribal leaders to discuss {{formation}} of a pro-independence political party that {{was not associated with}} Mahdism. The first step taken was to launch a new daily newspaper, al-Umma (The Community). In February 1945 the Umma party had <b>been</b> <b>organized</b> and the party's first secretary, Abdullah Khalil, applied for a government license. The constitution of the party made no mention of Sayyid Abd al-Rahman or of the Ansar; the only visible link to Abd al-Rahman was the party's reliance on him for funding. However, there were rumors that the Umma party had been created by the colonial government and aimed to place Sayyid Abd al-Rahman on the throne. These rumors persisted until June 1945, when the government publicly said it would not support a Mahdist monarchy.|$|E

5|$|Thomas is also speculated to {{have been}} one of the driving forces behind the Battle of the Neva, a disputed Swedish-Novgorodian {{conflict}} that took place in 1240.

However, as the Chronicle also lists the very unlikely Norwegians as allies, the information is often regarded as mid-14th century propaganda, depicting Sweden as being in control of Norway, Finland and Tavastia.|$|E

5|$|Lieutenant Colonel James H. Lynch's 3rd Battalion, 7th Cavalry, {{on the eve}} of its {{attack against}} Hill 314 {{numbered}} 535 men, less its rear echelons. The battalion, which had <b>been</b> <b>organized</b> at Fort Benning, Georgia, from the US 30th Infantry Regiment of the US 3rd Infantry Division, had arrived in Korea at the end of August. The action of the 7th Cavalry at Hill 518, begun nine days earlier, had been its first action, and attacking Hill 314 would be its second. The battalion attack plan this time differed radically from that employed against Hill 518 and was a direct development of that failure. The key aspect of the Hill 314 attack plan was to mass as many riflemen as possible on top of the narrow ridge line, by attacking with two companies abreast along the ridge, as opposed to Hill 518, where the firepower of only a platoon, and at times of only a squad, could be brought to bear against the North Koreans. Because of the ammunition shortage there was no artillery preparation on Hill 314, but there was an air strike before Lynch's battalion, with L Company on the left and I Company on the right started its attack from the lower slopes at 11:00 on September 12.|$|E
5|$|Robben had an extra-time penalty {{saved by}} former {{teammate}} Petr Čech in the 2012 Champions League final at the Allianz Arena against Chelsea.

That was the fourth major cup final {{that he had been}} on the losing side during the last two years (FIFA World Cup final, two Champions League finals and the DFB-Pokal). Three days later in the same stadium, and while playing as a second-half substitute for the Netherlands in a friendly against Bayern Munich, he was jeered by some disgruntled Bayern fans every time he touched the ball (due to his penalty miss in the Champions League final, and as he did not play on Bayern's side during that match due to a decision taken by Netherlands coach Bert van Marwijk). The match had <b>been</b> <b>organized</b> to compensate Bayern, since Robben aggravated an injury playing for the Netherlands at the 2010 World Cup, and went on to miss several months of the 2010–11 season.|$|E
