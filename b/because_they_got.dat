25|$|In general, the {{influence}} of German trade unions has declined since 1990 and had to accept shrinking real incomes and a reform of the welfare system in 2004 ("Hartz IV laws"), which put additional pressure on wages. For some years, the DGB and its member unions have been campaigning for a minimum wage to be introduced in Germany. Well into the 1990s, they had rejected this idea <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> better results from their strong position in the German system of collective bargaining.|$|E
25|$|Nunes also {{solved the}} problem of finding the day with the {{shortest}} twilight duration, for any given position, and its duration. This problem per se is not greatly important, yet it shows the geometric genius of Nunes {{as it was a}} problem which was independently tackled by Johann and Jakob Bernoulli more than a century later with less success. They could find {{a solution to the problem}} of the shortest day, but failed to determine its duration, possibly <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> lost in the details of differential calculus which, at that time, had only recently been developed. The achievement also shows that Nunes was a pioneer in solving maxima and minima problems, which became a common requirement only in the next century using differential calculus.|$|E
25|$|Lava flows are {{enormously}} {{destructive to}} property in their path. However, casualties are rare since flows are usually slow enough {{for people and}} animals to escape, though this {{is dependent on the}} viscosity of the lava. Nevertheless, injuries and deaths have occurred, either because they had their escape route cut off, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> too close to the flow or, more rarely, if the lava flow front travels too quickly. This notably happened during the eruption of Nyiragongo in Zaire (now Democratic Republic of the Congo). On the night of 10 January 1977 a crater wall was breached and a fluid lava lake drained out in under an hour. The resulting flow sped down the steep slopes at up to , and overwhelmed several villages while residents were asleep. As a result of this disaster, the mountain was designated a Decade Volcano in 1991.|$|E
