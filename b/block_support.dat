In response, the Athenians sent a powerful fleet towards Sparta. The Spartan general Pollis then led his small fleet to try and stop the siege, but was killed during a naval battle against the Athenian general Chabrias. This naval victory was the first ever victory by an Athenian naval fleet since the Peloponnesian War. Later in 376 BCE Chabrias raided Laconia, and possibly reached Sellasia which is to the north-east of Sparta. In 375 BCE Athens mounted two successful expeditions - one into the northern Aegean under Chabrias and a second which sailed around the Peloponnese to western Greece. This force was led by Timotheos, son of Conon, who won the battle of Alyzeia in Acarnania.|$|E

50|$|Jump Ultimate Stars {{has been}} changed {{slightly}} from the gameplay of Jump Super Stars. Jump Ultimate Stars gives battle characters the ability to dash and to do a new attack while guarding, which, instead of breaking the guard of the opponent, forces them to change characters, and can be identified by a green glow {{coming out of the}} characters which executes it. Also, certain seven and eight panel koma (along with certain five and six panel koma) obtain a visual difference during battle as opposed to the appearance of the one to six koma of the very same character; some of these variations also bring a totally different set of attacks to the character (e.g. Luffy becomes Luffy (Gear 2nd) for his Level 7 & 8 koma, Naruto becomes Kyubii Naruto for his Level 7 & 8 koma, and Ichigo becomes Bankai Ichigo for his Level 7 & 8 level koma). Battle characters now have a new ability known as Ultimate Actions (UA). These UA are different for each character, as some recover health, other recover SP, while others can be used to dodge enemy attacks. Another new feature added is the Evolution Chart. This area allows players to upgrade their characters by spending gems (currency earned for KO'ing opponents) to buy a new koma. Each character has a chart, starting from the one block help koma and branching off into the two and three <b>block</b> <b>Support</b> and the four to eight block Battle koma. Some characters have alternate block paths which unlock a different type for that character (e.g. Goku as a Laughter type instead of a Power type), while others can be used to unlock koma for characters from the same series, quizzes for the series, and new worlds in the Story Mode.|$|E
40|$|Many geostatistical {{variables}} have sample distributions {{that are}} highly positively skewed. Because of this, significant deskewing of the histogram and reduction of variance occurs when going from sample to <b>block</b> <b>support,</b> where blocks are of larger volume than samples.

The SMU is usually significantly smaller than the sampling grid dimensions, in particular at exploration/feasibility stages.

A model chain (STONE) has been developed to study and predict {{the magnitude of the}} resulting ground- and surface water pollution under different environmental conditions. STONE has three main components, namely: 1) the fertiliser distribution model CLEAN; 2) the atmospheric transport and deposition model OPS; and 3) the soil and soil-water quality model ANIMO. The goal {{of this study was to}} assess the accuracy of the STONE model output by comparing model predictions with independent observations, while accounting for spatial variation and differences in spatial support. The specific STONE output considered was mineral phosphorous concentration in the top soil. Predictions from STONE are made at the <b>block</b> <b>support</b> and, specifically, for 500 × 500 m grid cells, whereas the observations are on a point support. Therefore, aggregation of the point observations or disaggregation of the STONE model predictions is needed in order to test the accuracy of the STONE model. This study used the aggregation route. Specifically, ordinary and regression block kriging were used to aggregate the point observations to the <b>block</b> <b>support.</b> Overall, there was a good correspondence between the kriged observations and the STONE predictions, with no evidence of bias in the model predictions. However, there were meaningful differences locally, which was partly attributed to the smoothing of the kriging interpolator. Closer inspection revealed that not all of the differences could be attributed to measurement errors in the phosphorous observations and interpolation errors in the kriged phosphorous maps. Thus, it was demonstrated that the STONE output suffers from input and/or model errors. However, quantification of these errors was restricted by the fairly large interpolation uncertainty of the kriged phosphorous observations. Nevertheless, the spatial pattern of error in the STONE predictions could be partly attributed to combinations of landuse and soil type...|$|E

To {{figure out}} the {{structure}} and influencing factors of welded welded turnout slab convex block of ballastless track on bridge, according to the characteristics of force and displacement of welded turnout on bridge, the turnout-bridge-platform integration computation model was established by finite element method.

40|$|Thein vitro {{study of}} the {{combined}} effects of humoral antibody and lymphocytes has been essential in attempting to understand the paradoxical effect of humoral antibodies leading to the phenomenon of enhancement (1).

40|$|Exploitation of an {{ore deposit}} can be {{optimized}} by adapting the beneficiation processes to {{the properties of}} individual ore blocks. This can involve switching in and out certain treatment steps, or setting their controlling parameters. Optimizing this set of decisions requires the full conditional distribution of all relevant physical parameters and chemical attributes of the feed, including concentration of value elements and abundance of penalty elements. As a first step towards adaptive processing, the mapping of adaptive decisions is explored based on the composition, in value and penalty elements, of the selective mining units. Conditional distributions at <b>block</b> <b>support</b> are derived from cokriging and geostatistical simulation of log-ratios. A one-to-one log-ratio transformation {{is applied to the}} data, followed by modelling via classical multivariate geostatistical tools, and subsequent back-transforming of predictions and simulations. Back-transformed point-support simulations can then be averaged to obtain block averages that are fed into the process chain model. The approach is illustrated with a 2 ̆ 7 toy 2 ̆ 7 example where a four-component system (a value element, two penalty elements, and some liberable material) is beneficiated through a chain of technical processes.

When partial prior support information is available, a sufficient condition {{based on the}} high order block RIP is derived to guarantee stable and robust recovery of block sparse signals via the weighted ℓ_ 2 /ℓ_ 1 minimization. We then show if the accuracy of arbitrary prior <b>block</b> <b>support</b> estimate is at least 50 %, the sufficient recovery condition by the weighted ℓ_ 2 /ℓ_ 1 minimization is weaker than that by the ℓ_ 2 /ℓ_ 1 minimization, and the weighted ℓ_ 2 /ℓ_ 1 minimization provides better upper bounds on the recovery error {{in terms of the}} measurement noise and the compressibility of the signal. Moreover, we illustrate the advantages of the weighted ℓ_ 2 /ℓ_ 1 minimization approach in the recovery performance of block sparse signals under uniform and non-uniform prior information by extensive numerical experiments. The significance of the results lies in the facts that making explicit use of block sparsity and partial support information of block sparse signals can achieve better recovery performance than handling the signals as being in the conventional sense, thereby ignoring the additional structure and prior support information in the problem...|$|E
40|$|An {{important}} aspect in mineral resource evaluation is {{the reduction of}} variance when post-processing the grade distributions defined on the support (volume) of the available data into distributions defined on {{the support of the}} proposed selective mining units. Although the volume-variance relationship is well understood for the estimation of global grade distributions, it is still an unsolved issue for local estimation studies based on non-parametric geostatistical methods, such as indicator kriging, for which the support correction is not inherent to the method. To clarify this relationship, the local change of support problem is examined in the scope of two parametric models (multi-Gaussian and discrete Gaussian models). It is shown that the variance reduction factor between point and block-support local distributions depends on the block being considered and is less than the global variance reduction factor. As a consequence, post-processing the local point-support grade distributions {{on the basis of the}} latter systematically understates the importance of the change of support at the local scale and makes selective mining appear more economically attractive than it really is. In the light of these results, a methodology is proposed to post-process the local point-support distributions obtained via non-parametric (indicator) methods into block-support distributions. An application to simulated data indicates that this methodology provides an accurate estimation at the <b>block</b> <b>support</b> when dealing with diffusion-type random fields...|$|E
40|$|Geostatistics is a {{field of}} study that deals with {{spatially}} dependent attributes. As information regarding these attributes is usually only available at sample locations, estimates must be made at unsampled locations. Sample data are usually measured on point support within the study region, however in reality decisions are based on small blocks and not on points. A change-of-support model is required to obtain the theoretical distribution of block values given the sample point values. Estimates arc then made for a collection of blocks, {{referred to as a}} panel. Kriging is a generic term adopted by geostatisticians for a family of estimators appropriate for spatially distributed data. The main focus of this study is the method of Disjunctive Kriging that employs the use of a family of orthogonal functions known as the Hermite polynomials. This thesis presents comparisons of the results from Disjunctive Kriging with those from the more commonly used methods of Ordinary Kriging and Indicator Kriging. Ordinary Kriging can be used to generate estimates for each small block in the study region. Panel estimates can then be derived from the block estimates within each panel. Indicator Kriging and Disjunctive Kriging use change-of-support models to obtain estimates of functions of the attribute for the panels in the study region based on the chosen <b>block</b> <b>support</b> size. Two sets of isotropic data are analysed, one of which is approximately normally distributed and the other is positively skewed.
