40|$|We {{present a}} QoS {{oriented}} notation {{suitable for the}} ODP framework. In particular, we focus on a computational view of objects: we consider systems described as configurations of interacting objects and we deal with two types of communications: message passing and flows. In message passing, signals (from one object to another) are conveyed through the (implicit) underlying infrastructure. This form of interaction is suitable for client/server applications where no strong real time or ordering constraints are needed from the communication infrastructure. In contract, in a flow type of communication, signals are conveyed through third party (binding) objects that may be explicitly called for {{in order to ensure}} specific QoS requirements needed by specific applications.

Our MOFs feature good thermal stability and permanent porosity thanks to the strong carboxylate and cyanide linkages.

40|$|Case {{study and}} model results lend some {{optimism}} {{for the potential}} of small coalitions with partially excludable public goods to substantially deepen international cooperation on energy and climate issues. Drawing motivation from other issue areas in international relations ranging from nuclear non-proliferation, transboundary air pollution and liberalized trade, we use an evolutionary-game-theoretic model to analyze regimes that yield domestic incentives to contribute to public goods provision (co-benefits). Co-benefits may be limited, but can create a nucleus for formation of coalitions that grow while deepening provision of global public goods. The Climate and Clean Air Coalition (CCAC) {{is a prime example}} of an agreement that employs partially excludable club benefits to deepen cooperation on non-CO 2 greenhouse gases. Our game-theoretic results support two important insights for the <b>building</b> <b>blocks</b> <b>approach</b> to addressing climate change: sustained cooperation in club agreements is possible even when public goods are not entirely excludable and some members of the population free-ride; and second, cooperation in small club configurations yields larger non-excludable public goods benefits than cooperation in more inclusive forums. This paper lends positive support that a proliferation of small agreements under a <b>building</b> <b>blocks</b> <b>approach</b> at the UNFCCC may be more effective (not just more likely) for deepening climate change cooperation than a fully inclusive approach.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the synthesis of}} gem-difluorinated cyclic molecules using <b>building</b> <b>block</b> <b>approaches</b> based mainly on ring-closing metathesis (RCM) using commercially available ruthenium catalysts such as Grubbs' catalyst. In the first instance, 1 -bromo- 1, 1 -difluoroprop- 2 -ene was used to synthesise difluorinated dihydropyrans in order {{to demonstrate that the}} unprecedented RCM of a substrate containing two fluorine atoms in the allylic position could be achieved. A similar approach allowed the highly diastereoselective synthesis of new 4, 4 -difluoro- 4 -deoxyhexoses using a RCM-dihydroxylation sequence. In order to widen the range of available difluorinated monosaccharide analogues, a potentially highly enantioselective, non-RCM based route was developed. This approach relied on the use of (3 -bromo- 3, 3 -difluoro-prop- 1 -ynyl) -benzene as the fluorinated <b>building</b> <b>block</b> and Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylations to introduce hydroxyl groups enantioselectively. Unfortunately, a poor choice of protecting group prevented access to the desired difluorinated monosaccharide analogues, even if the asymmetric dihydroxylation proved successful and enantioselective. RCM was also used to synthesise different types of difluorocyclooctenones from trifluoroethanol. These difluorinated 8 -membered carbocycles showed interesting and unusual conformational behaviour and were investigated by NMR experiments and a simple computational study. These difluorocyclooctenones were also used to synthesise new bicyclic structures, which are effectively conformationally restrained difluorinated monosaccharide analogues...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. One of {{the most}} {{promising}} and versatile approaches to creating new quantum algorithms is based on the quantum hidden subgroup (QHS) paradigm, originally suggested by Alexei Kitaev. This class of quantum algorithms encompasses the Deutsch-Jozsa, Simon, Shor algorithms, and many more. In this paper, our strategy for finding new quantum algorithms is to decompose Shor’s quantum factoring algorithm into its basic primitives, then to generalize these primitives, and finally to show how to reassemble them into new QHS algorithms. Taking an ”alphabetic <b>building</b> <b>blocks</b> <b>approach,</b> ” we use these primitives to form an ”algorithmic toolkit ” for the creation of new quantum algorithms, such as wandering Shor algorithms, continuous Shor algorithms, the quantum circle algorithm, the dual Shor algorithm, a QHS algorithm for Feynman integrals, free QHS algorithms, and more. Toward the end of this paper, we show how Grover’s algorithm is most surprisingly “almost ” a QHS algorithm, and how this result suggests the possibility of an even more complete ”algorithmic tookit ” beyond the QHS algorithms.
