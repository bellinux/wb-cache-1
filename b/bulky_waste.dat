2500|$|Limited {{graphite}} lifetime - Compact designs have {{a limited}} lifetime for the graphite moderator and fuel / breeding loop separator. Under the influence of fast neutrons, the graphite first shrinks, then expands indefinitely until it becomes very weak and can crack, creating mechanical problems and causing the graphite to absorb enough fission products to poison the reaction. The 1960 two-fluid design had an estimated graphite replacement period of four years. Eliminating graphite from sealed piping was a major incentive {{to switch to a}} single-fluid design. Replacing this large central part requires remotely operated equipment. MSR designs have to arrange for this replacement. In a molten salt reactor, virtually all of the fuel and fission products can be piped to a holding tank. Only a fraction of one percent of the fission products end up in the graphite, primarily due to fission products slamming into the graphite. This makes the graphite surface radioactive, and without recycling/removal of at least the surface layer, creates a fairly <b>bulky</b> <b>waste</b> stream. Removing the surface layer and recycling the remainder of the graphite would solve this issue. Several techniques exist to recycle or dispose of nuclear moderator graphite. Graphite is inert and immobile at low temperatures, so it can be readily stored or buried if required. At least one design used graphite balls (pebbles) floating in salt, which could be removed and inspected continuously without shutting down the reactor. Reducing power density increases graphite lifetime. [...] By comparison, solid-fueled reactors typically replace 1/3 of the fuel elements, including all of the highly radioactive fission products therein, every 12 to 24 months. This is routinely done under a protecting and cooling column layer of water.|$|E

In this work, chars derived from various solid wastes were characterized from the standpoint of fuel recovery and pretreatment of waste before landfilling. Sixteen kinds of municipal and industrial solid wastes such as residential combustible <b>wastes,</b> non-combustible <b>wastes,</b> <b>bulky</b> <b>wastes,</b> construction and demolition wastes, auto shredder residue, and sludges were carbonized at 500 ℃ for 1 h under nitrogen atmosphere. In order to evaluate the quality of char as fuel, proximate analysis and heating value were examined. The composition of raw waste had a significant influence on the quality of produced char. The higher the ratio of woody biomass in waste, the higher heating value of char produced. Moreover, an equation to estimate heating value of char was developed by using the weight fraction of fixed carbon and volatile matter in char. De-ashing and chlorine removal were performed {{to improve the quality of}} char. The pulverization and sieving method seems to be effective for separation of incombustibles such as metal rather than ash. Most char met a 0. 5 wt% chlorine criterion for utilization as fuel in a shaft blast furnace after it was subjected to repeated water-washing. Carbonization could remove a considerable amount of organic matter from raw waste. In addition, the leaching of heavy metals such as chrome, cadmium, and lead appears to be significantly suppressed by carbonization regardless of the type of raw waste. From these results, carbonization could be considered as a pre-treatment of waste before landfilling as well as for fuel recovery...|$|R

40|$|Future {{limitations}} {{on the availability of}} selected resources stress the need for increased material efficiency. In addition, in a climate-constrained world the impact of resource use on greenhouse gas emissions should be minimized. Waste management is key to achieve sustainable resource management. Ways to use resources more efficiently include prevention of waste, reuse of products and materials, and recycling of materials, while incineration and anaerobic digestion may recover part of the embodied energy of materials. This study used iWaste, a simulation model, to investigate the extent to which savings in energy consumption and CO 2 emissions can be achieved in the Netherlands through recycling of waste streams versus waste incineration, and to assess the extent to which this potential is reflected in the LAP 2 (currently initiated policy). Three waste streams (i. e. household <b>waste,</b> <b>bulky</b> household <b>waste,</b> and construction and demolition waste) and three scenarios compare current policy to scenarios that focus on high-quality recycling (Recycling+) or incineration with increased efficiency (Incineration+). The results show that aiming for more and high-quality recycling can result in emission reductions of 2. 3 MtCO 2 annually in the Netherlands compared to the reference situation in 2008. The main contributors to this reduction potential are found in optimizing the recycling of plastics (PET, PE and PP), textiles, paper, and organic waste. A scenario assuming a higher energy conversion efficiency of the incinerator treating the residual waste stream, achieves an emission reduction equivalent to only one third (0. 7 MtCO 2 /year) of the reduction achieved in the Recycling+ scenario. Furthermore, {{the results of the study}} show that currently initiated policy only partially realizes the full potential identified. A focus on highest quality use of recovered materials is essential to realize the full potential energy and CO 2 emission reduction identified for the Netherlands. Detailed economic and technical analyses of high quality recycling are recommended to further evaluate viable integrated waste management policies. © 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

All requests must be served, and routes are subject to a maximum duration constraint. Minimizing the number of vehicles is the main objective, while minimizing the total route duration is a secondary objective. The problem belongs to the class of rollon–rolloff vehicle routing problems (RR-VRPs), though some characteristics of the case study, such as the free circulation of containers and the limited availability of spare containers, allow us to exploit them in the solution approach. We formalize the problem as a special vehicle routing problem on a bipartite graph, we analyze its structure, and we compare it to similar problems emphasizing the impact of limited spare containers. Moreover, we propose a neighborhood-based metaheuristic that alternatively switches from one objective to the other along the search path and periodically destroys and rebuilds parts of the solution. The main algorithm components are experimentally evaluated on real and realistic instances, the largest of which fail to be solved by a mixed-integer linear programming solver.

30|$|Composting is the {{technology}} for conversion of <b>bulky</b> organic <b>wastes</b> into low volume nutrient-enriched and stable product (Yousefi et al. 2013; Kharrazi et al. 2014). Traditional composting (farmers’ practices of heaping straw and dung) is very time consuming and relatively less effective. In such a case, using half decomposed compost/manure/plant residue creates many plant nutrient and pest-related problems, rather than benefits. Vermi-composting {{is one of the}} tested technologies to effectively recycle on-farm wastes to produce quality compost for use in crop production (Chander et al. 2013; Wani et al. 2014). Vermi-composting hastens the decomposition process through physical breakdown of the raw biomass coupled with mixing of vast spectrum of microbes with the biomass while passing through earthworm gut. The microbes of earth worm gut are highly potential in digesting the organic materials as well as polysaccharides (Aira et al. 2007; Zhang et al. 2000). However, continuously maintaining ambient living conditions for earthworms is a challenge in vermi-composting and a major cause for many on-farm failures. So, the other option could be to accelerate need-based decomposition of biodegradable materials through the external addition of decomposing microbial consortium culture (aerobic-composting). This may add the convenience of undertaking composting as and when needed without worrying throughout the year about maintaining moisture and feeding material as is needed in vermi-composting. However, relative effectiveness of aerobic-composting via external microbial culture needs to be evaluated vis-à-vis vermi-composting technology, as studies indicate that vermi-composting also renders the advantage of enhancing the diversities of bacterial and fungal communities (Huang et al. 2014). Well-tested scalable composting options are need of the day not only for agricultural wastes, but also for effective disposal of municipal and household wastes (generated to the tune of 125, 000  tons per day in a country like India as per the estimates of Central Pollution Control Board (2017) to reduce pollution arising from landfills and open dumps.|$|R

40|$|The {{degradation}} of the periurban landscapes is often caused by the realization of operations planned by the town-planning and by “spontaneous” transformations out of its control {{with the creation of}} new “hybrid” landscapes between town and countryside. Calcinara-Sestri Ponente and Prà Palmaro in the west side of Genoa are considered “islands” of neglect and degradation caused by the industrial activities which have occupied the most favorable areas to production from a morphologic and logistic point of view. The fragmentation of these coastal landscapes began {{in the second half of}} the nineteenth century with the construction of the railway line along the coast; the landscape which was characterized by seaside villages and villas became an industrial suburb, eliminating the components of the landscape without interest from the point of view of “modernization”, and consequently altering the relationships between the inhabitants, induced to participate to the industrial and harbour productive processes, and the landscape, with serious repercussions on the health of the population due to polluting emissions lasted for decades, with the loss of the “memory of the places” and of the local knowledge linked to agriculture and sea activities. The progressive degradation and the loss of integrity of the complex agricultural systems linked to the coastal villas Negrone and Vivaldi-Pasqua, caused by the inappropriate occupation of the free areas, by the disorderly placing of stores, greenhouses and industrial buildings has determined a mixing of incongruent and superimposed elements. This landscape has been transformed in a “urban jungle” hardly accessible and difficult to be passed through due to the tangle of vegetation and the acclivity, where traces of unregulated activities of storage and garbage recycling can be seen, as well as precarious structures used for the breeding, abusive discharges for building materials, scraps, <b>bulky</b> urban <b>wastes.</b> The inhabitants have shown the desire of improving the non-places generated by the urbanization with forms of spontaneous associations of volunteers with the aim of improving the quality of life.

40|$|Hydrogen {{sulphide}} is {{an environmentally}} hazardous gas which {{is present in}} many gas streams associated with oil and gas industry. Oxidation of H 2 S to sulphur in air produces no <b>bulky</b> or <b>waste</b> material and requires no further purification. Activated carbon {{is known as a}} catalyst for this reaction. In this research, a coal-based precursor (luscar char) and a biomass-based precursor (biochar) were used for production of activated carbons by two common methods of activation: physical and chemical activation in which steam and potassium hydroxide (KOH), respectively, were used. Experiments were designed by the statistical central composite design method. Two models were developed for the BET surface area and reaction yield of each activation process. These models showed the effects of operating conditions, such as activation temperature, mass ratio of activating agent to precursor, activation time, and nitrogen flowrate on the BET surface area and reaction yield for each activation method for each precursor. The optimum operating conditions were calculated using these models to produce activated carbons with relatively large BET surface area (> 500 m 2 /g) and high reaction yield (> 50 wt %). The BET surface area and reaction yield for activated carbons produced at optimum operating conditions showed maximum 7 and 7. 4 % difference, respectively, comparing to the values predicted by models. The activated carbons produced at optimum operating conditions were used as the base catalysts for the direct oxidation of 1 mol % hydrogen sulphide in nitrogen to sulphur at the temperature range of 160 - 205 oC and pressure of 700 kPa. Originally activated carbons showed a good potential for oxidation of hydrogen sulphide by their selectivity for sulphur product and low amount of sulphur dioxide production. To improve the performance of steam-activated carbons, the catalysts were modified by acid-treatment followed by thermal desorption. This method increased the break-through times for coal-based and biomass-based catalysts to 115 and 141 minutes, respectively. The average amounts of sulphur dioxide produced during the reaction time were 0. 14 and 0. 03 % (as % of hydrogen sulphide fed to the reactor) for modified activated carbons prepared from biochar and luscar char, respectively. The effects of porous structure, surface chemistry, and ash content on the performances of these activated carbon catalysts were investigated for the direct oxidation reaction of hydrogen sulphide. The acid-treatment followed by thermal desorption of activated carbons developed the porosity which produced more surface area for active sites and in addition, provided more space for sulphur product storage resulting in higher life time for catalyst. Boehm titration and temperature program desorption showed that the modification method increased basic character of carbon surface after thermal desorption in comparison to acid-treated sample. In addition, the effects of impregnating agents (potassium iodide and manganese nitrate) and two solvents for impregnation process were studied on the performance of the activated carbon catalysts for the direct oxidation of H 2 S to sulphur. Sulphur L-edge X-ray near edge structure (XANES) showed that the elemental sulphur was the dominant sulphur species in the product. The kinetic study for oxidation reaction of H 2 S over LusAC-O-D(650) was performed for temperature range of 160 - 190 oC, oxygen to hydrogen sulphide molar ratio of 1 - 3, and H 2 S concentration of 6000 - 10000 ppm at 200 kPa. The values of activation energy were 26. 6 and 29. 3 kJ. gmol- 1 for Eley-Rideal and Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanisms, respectively...|$|R
40|$|An {{increased}} {{understanding of}} the world’s limited resources and the negative environmental impacts connected to solid waste management has in recent years increased interest in separate collection and treatment of organic waste {{in many parts of}} the world. As an example, increased biological treatment of organic waste is an explicit goal within the Swedish national solid waste management strategy (SEPA, 2006) and the national environmental objectives state that 35 % of all organic household waste should be treated biologically by 2010 (SEPA, 2007). Several alternatives are currently being used and developed in the areas of collection/transportation, treatment and final use of the goods recovered from organic solid waste. Household food waste makes up around 30 - 40 mass-% of the total household waste in Sweden – <b>bulky</b> household <b>waste</b> excluded – or roughly 100 kg per person a year. The objective of this thesis is to explore possible alternatives for collection and treatment of this waste fraction with the aim of maximising the environmental benefits, using the life-cycle assessment (LCA) methodology. The LCA of four different systems for separate collection of household food waste for later anaerobic digestion showed that the conservation of nutrients and readily biodegradable carbon throughout the collection chain is of great importance to the overall environmental impacts of the collection alternatives studied. Thus, a higher input of energy and resources in the collection chain can be justified when resulting in higher potential energy and nutrient recovery later in the treatment process. This work also indicates that apart from information on households regarding waste recycling, also the practical arrangements of separate collection of food waste can have a large impact in the amount and quality of separately collected food waste. Hence, there is a need to gain a better understanding of household behaviour in relation to food waste disposal and further develop the infrastructure for separate collection of this waste, to assure convenient and accessible solutions for households where separate collection of food waste is introduced. The results also show that physical pre-treatment of separately collected household food waste in paper or plastic bags – currently the most common system for household food waste collection in Sweden – can result in large losses of biodegradable material and thus a reduction of the potential energy and nutrient recovery from this waste fraction. In the four pre-treatment plants included in this work, 13 - 39 % of the potential methane production and 13 - 32 % of N-total in incoming material were found in material separated in the pre-treatment process. The comparative LCA of different treatment alternatives for household food waste based on a case study from a residential area in southern Sweden shows that separate collection of household food waste for later anaerobic digestion with production of biogas to replace petrol as vehicle fuel was more beneficial than incineration with energy recovery (heat and power), composting in decentralised reactors without cleaning of emissions or biogas production with substitution of heat and power in relation to global warming potential (GWP), photochemical ozone depletion (ODP) and acidification potential (AP), while incineration was preferable in relation to eutrophication potential (EP). The energy balance performed also shows that the anaerobic treatment alternative is preferable from a net-energy production perspective, but that incineration is preferable when comparing the scenarios on a primary energy basis, as this credits the higher net-production of electricity from the incineration alternative. The results obtained in the comparative study were to a large extent dependent on several assumptions and methodological choices. Some of the more influential assumptions on the overall results were the environmental profile of energy carriers, peat and chemical fertilisers potentially substituted by waste treatment alternatives, emissions from on-land use of bio-fertilisers and emission control from waste treatment facilities. Factors that are more visual for households participating in separate collection of food waste – such as the use of bags for collection of food waste and transport to treatment facilities – were seen to be of lesser importance to the overall results from the treatment systems compared. The potentially large variations in results depending on choices and assumptions were reflected also in the outcomes from a review of 25 previously performed LCAs of food waste management. The review shows that different conclusions often are drawn regarding the most environmentally beneficial treatment alternative for food waste and that the GWP from collection and treatment of this waste fraction can vary greatly. Calculations of GWP from incineration, landfill disposal, anaerobic digestion and composting of food waste result in anything between large net avoidance to substantial contribution to GWP according to the reviewed studies (incineration: 640 to - 305 kg CO 2 -eq/ton; landfill: 1200 to 302 kg CO 2 -eq/tonne; anaerobic digestion: 440 to - 375 kg CO 2 -eq/tonne; and compost: 1000 to - 900 kg CO 2 -eq/tonne). However, these differences are not found to be related mainly to actual differences in the environmental impacts from the systems studied, but rather to differences in system boundary settings, methodological choices (for example the view on biogenic carbon emissions and carbon sequestration as well as the eco-profile of substituted goods) and, to a lesser extent, to variations in the input data. Due to lack of consistency in system boundary setting, processes and parameters seen as highly relevant for the outcome in some studies are not considered at all in others, making comparisons between different studies difficult. Nevertheless, comparisons are readily made between results from studies, independently of the often differing frameworks and assumptions made in the studies. Also, several cases of internal inconsistencies were identified in the studies, generally due to differences in system boundary setting between scenarios. Assumptions related to the quality of input material (treated food waste), losses and emissions of carbon, nutrients and other compounds during collection, potential storage and physical pre-treatment, potential energy recovery through incineration, treatment of incineration residues, emissions from composting, emissions from storage and on-land use of bio-fertilisers and chemical fertilisers and eco-profiles of substituted goods were all identified as highly relevant for the outcomes in this type of comparison. Mass-flows of carbon, nutrients and heavy metals are in many cases not respected due to cut-offs and use of literature values rather than transfer coefficients throughout the treatment chain. Based on the results from the review and previously mentioned results from this work, more considerations should be given to: - The quantitative and qualitative impacts of different collection systems for source-separated food waste on the collected material - The quantitative and qualitative effects on separately collected food waste associated with physical pre-treatment processes - Environmental impacts from downstream processes in the treatment chain, such as storage and final use/disposal of goods/secondary waste stream resulting from different treatment processes - The potential substitution of goods with high negative environmental impact with those gained through food waste treatment In many cases there is a need for further research and improvement of input data. Unlike management systems for many other solid waste fractions, the food waste management scale can be assumed to be more influenced by geographical differences. Although the reviewed studies covered waste systems in 12 countries on three continents, similar input data found in the literature was commonly used in the studies, without further discussion of the need for adjustments to fit the local context. Six LCA-guidelines were also consulted in this work. These guidelines often did not address several of the identified key issues or give different recommendations in relation to these questions. Thus, establishment and use of more detailed guidelines within this field in order to increase both the general quality of the assessments performed as well as to increase the possibilities to compare different studies would be welcome. Increasing separate collection of food waste is very important to attain the environmental benefits viable through AD with energy and nutrient recovery of food waste. The results indicate that apart from information on households regarding waste recycling, the practical arrangements of separate collection of food waste also can have a large impact on the amount and quality of separately collected food waste. Thus, there is a need to further develop the infrastructure for separate collection of food waste, to assure convenient and accessible solutions in the households where separate collection of food waste is introduced. This poses an organisational challenge, as this can require closer collaboration between municipalities and facility owners to reach municipal and national goals on food waste collection and biological treatment. Swedish regulations on solid waste management provide a monopoly on collection and treatment of household waste. However, this work shows that many of the factors with great effect on the overall environmental impact of the food waste treatment chain are located outside of what is controlled by the decision-makers of municipal waste management strategies. This indicates the importance of a holistic approach when assessing different treatment alternatives and a need for extensive collaboration between the often different actors involved in the food waste management chain in order to maximize the potential environmental benefits...|$|R
