The brothers' mother originally {{sang in the}} band, but soon quit. Eventually they started to play shows around Omaha, Nebraska. After seeing a free show, Dave Goldberg was enlisted to join and simultaneously play organs and drums. They spent much of 2008 and 2009 on the road before releasing their debut album Alice and Friends on August 11, 2009. The album's name comes from a vegan barbecue restaurant in Chicago of the same name. They embarked {{on a tour of}} the United States in October 2009 with labelmates Jay Reatard and Nobunny and in March 2010 with Black Lips. <b>Box</b> <b>Elders</b> began an indefinite hiatus in 2010.|$|R

5|$|Passage of the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956 {{formed the}} Interstate Highway System, however only the western segment of now I-84 was {{approved}} at this time, and a designation of I-82S {{was assigned to}} a then unconstructed controlled-access highway across <b>Box</b> <b>Elder</b> County in 1957. The eastern segment of the highway was added later in 1957, and the route was numbered I-80N by 1958. By 1968, portions of the western half of the freeway had been completed, along with the segment between Tremonton and Brigham City. A portion of the freeway was completed around Morgan as well. By 1971, most of the western portions of the freeway had been constructed with two sections remaining that had at-grade intersections. Along the concurrency, there were gaps between Brigham City and Pleasant View, and one small gap near the Devil's Slide.|$|E

5|$|US-89 {{meets the}} current {{alignment}} of US-91 {{in the southern}} outskirts of Brigham City, turning east for an overlap on the city's southeast bypass. (SR-13 and SR-90 are the former alignment through Brigham City.) The two routes head east up <b>Box</b> <b>Elder</b> Canyon in the southern Wellsville Mountains, finally leaving {{the valley of the}} Great Salt Lake into a small valley that contains Mantua Reservoir (elevation 5200 feet/1585 m). US-89/US-91 turns north there, bypassing the town of Mantua to the west, and continues to ascend through Dry Canyon to Sardine Summit (elevation 5900 feet/1798 m). Another small valley leads to Wellsville Canyon, where the four-lane roadway again turns east and descends into the Cache Valley. In that valley, US-89/US-91 heads northeast, bypassing Wellsville to the east, into downtown Logan. US-91 continues northerly from Logan into Idaho, but US-89 splits to the east, beginning a long climb of the Bear River Range through Logan Canyon. The Logan Canyon Scenic Byway, a Utah and National Scenic Byway, begins at Logan and follows US-89 up the canyon, past the access road to the Beaver Mountain ski area, to Garden City and on to the state line. Bear Lake Summit (elevation 7800ft/2377 m), {{at the top of the}} range, is the highest point on US-89 in Utah, from which it descends the east slope via horseshoe curves to Garden City on the shore of Bear Lake (elevation 5900ft/1798 m). The final segment of US-89 to the Idaho state line follows the lake's west shore, its location constrained by the Bear River Range just to the west.|$|E

5000|$|After I {{had planted}} 32 trees all <b>box</b> <b>elders,</b> {{in the spring}} of 1907, I left them to grow in their new home for a year until they were six feet tall, before {{beginning}} the chair. In the spring of 1908 I gradually began the work of training the young and pliable stems to grow gradually {{in the shape of a}} chair. Most of this work consisted in bending the stems of these trees and tying and grafting them together so as to grow, if possible with all the joints cemented by nature. This was largely an experiment with me and it was with a great deal of interest that I watched and assisted nature in growing piece of furniture.The first summer's growth found all the joints I had made by tying and grafting grown firmly together. Some of the trees I found, however, grew much faster than others. To overcome this, I began to cut the stems of those trees that to my notion had grown large enough. This did not kill these trees but simply retarded their growth so as to give the weaker trees a chance to catch up.In this manner I let these trees grow for seven years. During the last two years I had only four trees growing from the root. These were the four that consisted the legs of the chair and all the other stems kept alive from these four stems because they were grafted to them. After the seventh year all the trees were cut, making in all eleven years from the time the seed was sown until the chair was finally completed.|$|R
40|$|This {{submission}} {{takes the}} form of six original musical compositions along with critical analyses. (NB in accordance with convention all references to notes and examples within the text are given in concert pitch.) The first composition, 'Lonely Isle' is written for brass band and is one movement with two contrasting sections. The music is broadly tonal throughout and the key signatures of B b major and then C minor are employed for the two sections. 'Fantasy No. 1 for Trombone' is written for solo trombone with piano accompaniment. This was written with for Brett Baker as a potential repertoire piece. The piece has one movement with three contrasting sections. The first, Allegro Scherzando, uses Lydian mode, then Andante in Dm and finally Vivace in C minor. 'At The Gates To Oblivion'was inspired by a series of role-playing video games for PC and X <b>Box</b> called 'The <b>Elder</b> Scrolls', most specifically by the game 'The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion' (Bethesda Softworks, 2006). It was originally written for brass band and was later transcribed for wind band. It is in an open key and has three movements. 'Falling Red Leaves of Autumn' is a three-movement piece for euphonium, vibraphone and piano. The titles of the three movements together form a haiku and the piece is composed using pentatonic scales, the first two movements major, and the third minor. 'The Sun God, Ra is composed for brass band and is also in one freeform movement. It is a piece of programme music inspired by ancient Egyptian mythology. Village Green Dances' is written {{with the idea of a}} brass band playing at a traditional fete or country setting and takes as it's starting point the kind of music typically performed at such events. It is written for brass band and is a suite of three pieces, an opening fanfare, a lyrical waltz and a slightly confused march.

25|$|Rapid Creek {{flows through}} Rapid City, {{emerging}} from Dark Canyon above Canyon Lake and flowing {{in a large}} arc north of Downtown. Rapid Creek descends to the southeast as the valley widens. The floodplain of Rapid Creek is mostly a series of parks, arboretums, and bike trails, one legacy of the Black Hills Flood of 1972. To the north, a series of ridges separates Rapid Creek from <b>Box</b> <b>Elder</b> Creek, with large older and new residential areas and commercial areas along I-90. To the south, the terrain rises more steeply to the southern widening of the Dakota Hogback into a plateau dividing the Rapid Creek drainage from Spring Creek.|$|E
25|$|The forested, or {{woodlands}} area {{is dominated}} by trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides), balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera), other poplars and spruces, although other species of trees do occur. Pines, mostly jack pine and lodgepole pine will often grow in areas that have sandy soil conditions. Other native species may include <b>box</b> <b>elder,</b> tamarack and willow, while the foothills area in the southeast of the region, such as Turtle Mountain or Spruce Woods Provincial Park, have woodland of white spruce and balsam fir but quaking aspen will domninate where the woodland has been cleared by fire. The proportion of forests to grasslands has increased somewhat over the prairie in areas not affected by agriculture in the last 100 years. This increase {{is partly due to}} the reduction of prairie fires which used to destroy the new saplings on the fringes of the aspen groves. Also, it was a common practice for farmers to plant stands of trees as windbreaks.|$|E
