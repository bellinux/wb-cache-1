5|$|Fellow {{citizens}} & compatriots—I am besieged, by {{a thousand}} {{or more of}} the Mexicans under Santa Anna—I have sustained a continual Bombardment & cannonade for 24 hours & have not lost a man. The enemy has demanded a surrender at discretion, otherwise, the garrison are to <b>be</b> <b>put</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sword, if the fort is taken—I have answered the demand with a cannon shot, & our flag still waves proudly from the walls. I shall never surrender or retreat. Then, I call on you in the name of Liberty, of patriotism & everything dear to the American character, to come to our aid, with all dispatch—The enemy is receiving reinforcements daily & will no doubt increase to three or four thousand in four or five days. If this call is neglected, I am determined to sustain myself as long as possible & die like a soldier who never forgets what is due to his own honor & that of his country—'Victory or Death.|$|E
5|$|On 6 October, {{a number}} of private interbank credit {{facilities}} to Icelandic banks were shut down. Prime Minister Geir Haarde addressed the nation in a speech that became infamous for its portentous closing words: 'God bless Iceland'. He announced a package of new regulatory measures which were to <b>be</b> <b>put</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Althing, Iceland's parliament, immediately, {{with the cooperation of}} the opposition parties. These included the power of the FME to take over the running of Icelandic banks without nationalising them, and preferential treatment for depositors in the event that a bank had to be liquidated. In a separate measure, retail deposits in Icelandic branches of Icelandic banks were guaranteed in full. The emergency measures had been deemed unnecessary by the Icelandic government less than 24 hours earlier.|$|E

Four republican models were debated: two involving direct election of the head of state; one involving appointment on the advice of the prime minister (the McGarvie Model); and one involving appointment by a two-thirds majority of parliament (the bi-partisan appointment model).|$|E

25|$|After this victory, {{expectations}} for the county were high, with many pundits predicting that Donegal would win the Ulster Championship. Donegal beat Antrim 1–10 to 0–07 in the preliminary round. This was the team's first Championship win since 2007. This set up an away match against Cavan from which Donegal once again emerged victorious, by a scoreline of 2–14 to 1–08. A more ominous test against Tyrone would follow this Cavan victory. The new defensive system developed by Jim McGuinness would <b>be</b> <b>put</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> test against a Tyrone team which perfected the blanket defense tactic {{on the way to}} three All Ireland victories in the 2000s.

25|$|If the {{government}} {{agrees that the}} changes are worthwhile, a Bill is drafted, usually by Parliamentary Counsel. The Bill is read and debated {{in both houses of}} parliament before it is either rejected, changed, or approved. An approved Bill must then receive the assent then handed down to either the Governor (State) or the Governor-General (Commonwealth). And then it must <b>be</b> <b>put</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> people through a Referendum and only a majority vote of all the States will ensure that law will be passed. Parliament often delegates legislation to local councils, statutory authorities and government departments, for sub or minor statute laws or rules such as Road Rules, but all law is answerable to the Commonwealth Constitution.|$|E
25|$|After 1707, Ireland was, {{to varying}} degrees, {{subordinate}} to the Kingdom of Great Britain. The Parliament of Ireland had control over only legislation, while {{the executive branch of}} government, under the Lord Lieutenant, answered to the British government in London. Furthermore, the Penal Laws meant that Catholics, who constituted the majority of Irish people, were not permitted to sit in, or participate in, elections to the parliament. Meanwhile, building upon the precedent of Poynings' Law which required approval from the Brtish Privy Council for bills to <b>be</b> <b>put</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Irish Parliament, the Dependency of Ireland on Great Britain Act 1719 declared the British Parliament's right to legislate for Ireland and the British House of Lords appellate jurisdiction over its courts.|$|E

25|$|The {{judgment}} proposes {{several questions}} to <b>be</b> <b>put</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Enlarged Board of Appeal {{in an effort}} to resolve perceived conflicts between the different decisions of the Boards of Appeal. In response to this, Alain Pompidou, then president of the European Patent Office (EPO), wrote to Lord Justice Jacob to say that while clarification of certain issues relating to excluded subject matter would be welcomed, there were currently insufficient differences between relevant Board of Appeal decisions that would justify a referral. Instead, a referral would be appropriate if the approach taken by one Board of Appeal would lead to the grant of a patent whereas the approach taken by another Board would not. On 22 October 2008, Pompidou's successor Alison Brimelow did refer a number of questions to the Enlarged Board. In its opinion G 3/08, the Enlarged Board rejected the referral as inadmissible.|$|E
25|$|The end of 1912 saw {{the end of}} a year of {{political}} struggle for Law. As well as the problem of Home Rule, there were internal party struggles; supporters of the Church of England or military reform lambasted Law for not paying attention to their causes, and tariff reformers argued with him over his previous compromise on food duties. Despite this, most Conservatives realised that as a fighting leader, Law could not be bettered. The results of by-elections throughout 1913 continued to favour them, but progress on the Home Rule Bill was less encouraging; on 7 July it was again passed by the Commons, and again rejected by the Lords on 15 July. Parliament rose for the summer recess on 15 August, and Law and the Unionists spent the summer trying to convince the King to voice an opinion on the issue. Their first suggestion was that he should withhold the Royal Assent on it, something that horrified Law's constitutional law adviser A.V. Dicey. The second was more reasonable– they argued that the Liberals had put the King in an impossible position by asking him to ratify a bill that would infuriate half of the population. His only option was to write a memo to Asquith saying this and requesting that the problem of home rule <b>be</b> <b>put</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> electorate via a general election. After thinking on this, the King agreed, and handed a note to Asquith on 11 August requesting either an election or an all-party conference.|$|E

[...] In St. Louis, Missouri, the Daily Reveille trumpeted that [...] "the flag of independence has been hoisted {{for the second time}} {{on this side of the}} Atlantic." [...] Horace Greeley in the New York Tribune wrote [...] "When a sincere republican is asked to say in sober earnest what adequate reason he can give, for refusing the demand of women to an equal participation with men in political rights, he must answer, None at all. However unwise and mistaken the demand, it is but the assertion of a natural right, and such must be conceded." ...|$|E

500|$|Bani Khuraiza,^ as {{they had}} {{assisted}} the confederates, breaking their league with the Muslims. The Muslim army besieged them for fifteen days and nights and reduced them to distress. They came down at the order given them by Saad bin Maaz, who adjudged that the males should <b>be</b> <b>put</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sword, {{the women and children}} made slaves, and their goods divided among the Muslims. The Prophet (the blessing and peace of God be on him !) addressing Saad, said, [...] "0 Saad Maaz—you have pronounced that which the Most High had ordered above the seven skies." [...] God refers to this event when He says that He brought them out of their fortresses {{as they had}} assisted the confederates and protected them. These were believers in the Old Testament, namely, Jews. God cast into their hearts terror of the Prophet and his army, and those who were killed numbered between seven and nine hundred, and their women and children were made slaves. You inherited their land, gardens, fields and houses, their fortified places, and their property consisting of money and cattle. All these were given you by God. And this saying likewise applies to the Kliaiber, to Turkey, or to Persia. It is also spoken in order that whatever country the Muslims may hereafter be in possession of, until the last day, may also be included in the above passage. God is almighty.|$|E
500|$|When The New York Times began {{publishing}} its series, President Richard Nixon became incensed. His {{words to}} National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger included [...] "People have gotta <b>be</b> <b>put</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> torch {{for this sort}} of thing..." [...] and [...] "Let's get the son-of-a-bitch in jail." [...] After failing to get The New York Times to stop publishing, Attorney General John Mitchell and President Nixon obtained a federal court injunction that The New York Times cease publication of excerpts. The newspaper appealed and the case began working through the court system. On June 18, 1971, The Washington Post began publishing its own series. Ben Bagdikian, a Post editor, had obtained portions of the papers from Ellsberg. That day the Post received a call from the Assistant Attorney General, William Rehnquist, asking them to stop publishing. When the Post refused, the U.S. Justice Department sought another injunction. The U.S. District court judge refused, and the government appealed. On June 26, 1971, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to take both cases, merging them into New York Times Co. v. United States 403 US 713. On June 30, 1971, the Supreme Court held in a 6–3 decision that the injunctions were unconstitutional prior restraints and that the government had not met the burden of proof required. The justices wrote nine separate opinions, disagreeing on significant substantive issues. While it was generally seen as a victory for those who claim the First Amendment enshrines an absolute right to free speech, many felt it a lukewarm victory, offering little protection for future publishers when claims of national security were at stake.|$|E
