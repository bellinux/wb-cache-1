One of the most important markers is chromosomal DNA fragmentation as indicated by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining. We found TUNEL staining in S. cerevisiae to be a consequence of both single- and double-strand DNA breaks, whereas in situ ligation specifically stained double-strand DNA breaks. Cells treated with hydrogen peroxide or acetic acid staining positively for TUNEL assay stained negatively for in situ ligation, indicating that DNA damage in both cases mainly consists of single-strand DNA <b>breaks.</b> <b>Pulsed</b> field gel electrophoresis of chromosomal DNA from cells dying from hydrogen peroxide, acetic acid, or hyperosmotic shock revealed DNA breakdown into fragments of several hundred kilobases, consistent with the higher order chromatin degradation preceding DNA laddering in apoptotic mammalian cells. DNA fragmentation was associated with death by treatment with 10 mM hydrogen peroxide but not 150 mM and was absent if cells were fixed with formaldehyde to eliminate enzyme activity before hydrogen peroxide treatment. These observations are consistent with a process that, like mammalian apoptosis, is enzyme dependent, degrades chromosomal DNA, and is activated only at low intensity of death stimuli...|$|R

We characterize the optical properties of SN 2011 fe in the Swift bands and find {{them to be}} broadly consistent with a "normal" SN Ia, however, no X-ray source is detected by either XRT or Chandra. We constrain the progenitor system mass loss rate to be lower than 2 x 10 ^- 9 M_sun/yr (3 sigma c. l.) for wind velocity v_w= 100 km/s. Our result rules out symbiotic binary progenitors for SN 2011 fe and argues against Roche-lobe overflowing subgiants and main sequence secondary stars if > 1 % of the transferred mass is lost at the Lagrangian points. Regardless of the density profile, the X-ray non-detections are suggestive of a clean environment (particle density < 150 cm- 3) for (2 x 10 ^ 15 <R< 5 x 10 ^ 16) cm around the progenitor site. This is either consistent with the bulk of material being confined within the binary system or with a significant delay between mass loss and supernova explosion. We furthermore combine X-ray and radio limits from Chomiuk et al. 2012 to constrain the post shock energy density in magnetic fields.

40|$|This Master thesis {{work has}} been carried out during between June and November 2006 at the Swedish Defence Research Agency (FOI) at the Department of Laser System, in Linköping. Conventional {{airborne}} laser scanner systems extract only the first and last echo from the return laser pulse. With improved processor capacities and the ability to save more data it is now possible to save and analyse the entire waveform, in post-processing, in order to extract more characteristics of the reflecting surfaces, e. g., finding more echoes. This helps create {{a better understanding of the}} shape and characteristics of objects. In vegetation more than one echo usually occurs, since the laser pulse can for example hit the canopy, some branches and leaves and finally the ground. But some of those echoes are so small that it can be difficult to distinguish them from the noise in the signal. By using deconvolution, small, yet obvious, echoes can be amplified and more information can thus be obtained about what has reflected the laser light. Deconvolution can also <b>break</b> down <b>pulses</b> from adjacent surface that can appear as one larger pulse. In this thesis the Richardson-Lucy deconvolution algorithm is used. The EM-algorithm is used to fit the waveforms to a series of Gaussians functions. After the deconvolution of the laser return from areas with vegetations more than 75 % more echoes could be extracted compared to the echoes found with the system, while for areas with buildings and roads, the deconvolution did not increase the extracted echoes significantly. More echoes was found on the ground, below the trees, which enable a more accurate model of the ground to be acquired. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R

For shorter length of the device the switched pulse is presenting time broadening. For higher length of the device, pulse breakup was observed. Considering the AOTF with loss one consider the device of length 0. 25 mm with loss of 4 dB/mm constructed with an increasing nonlinearity profile.

I will discuss several experiments examining the effects of strong field ionization in diatomic iodine {{in the presence of}} a two-­color (800 ­ and 400 nm) phase stable femtosecond laser pulse. By controlling the relative phase of the two-color pulse, the magnitude and direction of the electric field can be controlled. As strong field ionization depends exponentially on the electric field strength, ionization rates can be controlled. The spatial asymmetry of the <b>pulse</b> <b>breaks</b> the spatial symmetry of ionization allowing for control over directions of ion yields while providing insight into the physics of ionization. We find a critical region in which there is spatially asymmetric enhanced ionization of the (2, 0) channel to a counterintuitive (1, 2) channel. I will also discuss the development of a velocity map imaging (VMI) detector which provides two-dimensional information about the dissociation and distribution of molecular ions upon ionization. The VMI along with Fourier transform spectroscopy allows us to identify specific molecular orbitals from which electrons are removed through ionization by measuring the vibrational period and angular distributions of the ion fragments...|$|R
40|$|Facilitation of {{cortical}} excitability of the ipsilesional primary {{motor cortex}} (M 1) may improve dexterity {{of the affected}} hand after stroke. The effects of 10 Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over ipsilesional M 1 on movement kinematics and neural activity were examined in patients with subcortical or cortical stroke. Twenty-nine patients with impaired dexterity after stroke (16 subcortical middle cerebral artery [MCA] strokes, 13 MCA strokes involving subcortical tissue and primary or secondary cortical sensorimotor areas) received 1 session of 10 Hz rTMS (5 -second stimulation, 25 -second <b>break,</b> 1, 000 <b>pulses,</b> 80 % of the resting motor threshold) applied over: 1) ipsilesional M 1 and 2) vertex (control stimulation). For behavioral testing, 29 patients performed index finger and hand tapping movements with the affected and unaffected hand prior to and following each rTMS application. For functional magnetic resonance imaging, 18 patients performed index finger tapping movements with the affected and unaffected hand before and after each rTMS application. Ten-Hz rTMS over ipsilesional M 1, but not over vertex, improved movement kinematics in 14 of 16 patients with subcortical stroke, but not in patients with additional cortical stroke. Ten-Hz rTMS slightly deteriorated dexterity of the affected hand in 7 of 13 cortical stroke patients. At a neural level, rTMS over ipsilesional M 1 reduced neural activity of the contralesional M 1 in 11 patients with subcortical stroke, but caused a widespread bilateral recruitment of primary and secondary motor areas in 7 patients with cortical stroke. Activity in ipsilesional M 1 at baseline correlated with improvement of index finger tapping frequency induced by rTMS. The beneficial effects of 10 Hz rTMS over ipsilesional M 1 on motor function of the affected hand depend on the extension of MCA stroke. Neural activity in ipsilesional M 1 {{may serve as a}} surrogate marker for the effectiveness of facilitatory rTMS...|$|R
40|$|Scaling or smiliarity laws of plasmas are of {{interest}} if lab size plasma sources are to be scaled for industrial processes. Ideally, the discharge parameters of the scaled plasmas are predictable and the fundamental physical processes are unaltered. Naturally, there are limitations and ranges of validity. Scaling laws for direct current glow discharges are well known. If a well diagnosed discharge is scaled, the field strength in the positive column, the gas amplification and the normal current density can easily be estimated. For non-stationary high power discharges like high power impulse magnetron sputtering (HiPIMS) plasmas, scaling is not as straight forward. Here, one deals with a non-stationary complex system with strong changes in plasma chemistry and symmetry <b>breaks</b> during the <b>pulses.</b> Because of the huge parameter space no good parameters are available to define these kind of discharges unambiguous at the moment. In this contribution we will discuss the scaling laws for DC glow discharges briefly and present experimental results for a discharge with copper electrodes and helium as plasma forming gas. This discharge was operated in a pressure range from 200 to 1600 hPa with three different electrode diameters (D= 2. 1, 3. 0 and 4. 3 mm). Results from breakdown voltage measurements indicate that the pressure and electrode distance cannot be varied independently. Effects of the scaling on the reduced normal current density, the reduced normal electric field in the positive column and discharge temperature will be discussed and limitations highlighted. Compared with these results the added complexity of HiPIMS plasmas will be described. Suggestions in the community how to obtain experimental finger prints of the plasmas will be reviewed and implications from the experiences with DC discharges {{on the development of}} similarity laws for HiPIMS plasmas will be discussed.
