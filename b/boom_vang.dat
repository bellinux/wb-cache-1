5|$|Wind shear affects sailboats {{in motion}} by {{presenting}} a different wind speed and direction at different heights along the mast. The effect of low level wind shear can be factored into {{the selection of}} sail twist in the sail design, but this {{can be difficult to}} predict since wind shear may vary widely in different weather conditions. Sailors may also adjust the trim of the sail to account for low level wind shear, for example using a <b>boom</b> <b>vang.</b>|$|E
25|$|The mast head {{instruments}} {{indication of}} apparent wind speed and direction {{is different from}} what the sailor sees and feels near the surface.

25|$|Kicking straps / <b>boom</b> <b>vangs,</b> which {{control a}} boom-footed sail's leech tension by exerting {{downward}} force mid-boom. Normally {{this is a}} system of highly geared blocks, of flexible stainless steel wire and low stretch cordage but recently some sail boats have a short spar instead, often of carbon fibre. When sailing downwind the kicking strap (kicker) is tensioned to stop the boom lifting.|$|R
50|$|While under sail, the {{opposite}} {{force to the}} vang is supplied by the sail itself. When the sail is furled, a topping lift supplies the upward force on the <b>boom.</b> Some line <b>vang</b> systems incorporate a piston to provide the topping lift force and to damp oscillations. Hydraulic vangs can inherently act in the topping lift role.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: On larger sailboats, the <b>boom</b> <b>vang</b> {{is often}} a {{combination}} of a spring-loaded telescopic tube to support the boom and a pulley system to tighten the vang as shown in this picture.|$|E
50|$|The Kite is a one-design planing dingy, self-bailing, easy righting for 2 {{people or}} as a single-handler. Planes easily. Well made, sturdy, with <b>boom</b> <b>vang,</b> out- and downhauls for sail control, not a board boat like a Laser or Sunfish.|$|E
50|$|On some sailing boats, {{such as the}} 49er, {{rather than}} a set of lines pulling the boom downwards, a rigid member is used to push the boom down. By {{controlling}} leech tension, the <b>boom</b> <b>vang</b> {{is one of the}} three methods of controlling sail twist.|$|E
50|$|The Force 5 has full sail controls, {{including}} a cunningham, outhaul, <b>boom</b> <b>vang,</b> and traveller. The mainsail has a sleeve which fits over the 3-piece aluminum mast. A junior sail is available with reduced sail area for better handling when used by lower weight individuals under 185 lbs. The rudder and centerboard are solid varnished mahogany but recently fiberglass versions became available.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>boom</b> <b>vang,</b> {{kicking strap}} or kicker is an {{intricate}} set of pulleys (and, on yachts, a hydraulic ram) running diagonally between the boom {{and the lower}} portion of the mast. The kicker pulls the boom downwards. When the boat is running away from the wind the sheet will be fully eased and so the kicker becomes the primary means of controlling sail twist.|$|E
50|$|The vang {{typically}} {{runs from}} the base of the mast to a point about a third of the way out the boom. Due to the great force necessary to change the height of the boom while a boat is under sail, a line-based <b>boom</b> <b>vang</b> usually includes some sort of a pulley system. Hydraulic piston vangs are used on larger sailboats and controlled by manual or electric hydraulic pumps.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>boom</b> <b>vang</b> (US) or {{kicking strap}} (UK) {{is a line}} or piston system on a {{sailboat}} used to exert downward force on the boom and thus control {{the shape of the}} sail.The Collins English Dictionary defines it as [...] "A rope or tackle extended from the boom of a fore-and-aft mainsail to a deck fitting of a vessel when running, {{in order to keep the}} boom from riding up".|$|E
50|$|The key to {{stopping}} or rescuing a broach is to depower {{the sails}} {{at the first}} opportunity. This may be done by releasing the main or jib sheet by a foot or more or by releasing the <b>boom</b> <b>vang</b> (kicking strap) which will spill wind {{out of the top}} of the mainsail. The main means of preventing a broach is to ensure that the amount of sail set is reduced to suit the sailing conditions.|$|E

50|$|Three sail shape {{controls}} which {{control the}} leech tension, and therefore sail twist, are the mainsheet, the <b>boom</b> <b>vang</b> and the traveler. The mainsheet pulls the boom (and therefore {{the foot of}} the sail) primarily inwards at lower points of sail and downwards at higher points of sail. Manipulation of the traveler can counteract this because it always pulls the boom laterally. The vang on the other hand does the opposite, it always changes the height of the boom.|$|E

50|$|The hull is a {{hard chine}} design with a slight curve to the bottom section, and a bulb keel. Stars were {{originally}} rigged with a large, low-aspect-ratio gunter mainsail and jib, which {{was replaced by a}} short bermuda rig in 1921, before the current tall bermuda sail plan was adopted in 1930. In 1965, fiberglass replaced wood as the primary hull material. Other changes to the strict design rules for the Star class, include adding flexible spars, an innovative circular-track <b>boom</b> <b>vang,</b> and self-bailers.|$|E
50|$|A safe jibe can be {{aided by}} {{tensioning}} the <b>boom</b> <b>vang</b> (kicking strap) {{to prevent the}} boom from lifting. In fresh winds, sailing nearly directly downwind briefly {{before and after the}} jibe and making only a small direction changes will produce less heeling force and reduce the tendency to round-up. In heavier gusts, the crew or skipper can sheet the boom in and force the boom across the boat by hand, holding the boom in position by locking the traveler or using a preventer. After the jibe has been completed, the course can then be changed to higher points of sail.|$|E
50|$|He also popularised the kicking strap, or <b>boom</b> <b>vang</b> (US). This {{may take}} the form of a block and tackle linking a low point on the mast (or an {{equivalent}} point on the hull) and the boom close to the mast, which allows the boom to be let out when reaching or running without lifting. This controls the twist of the mainsail from its foot to its head, increasing the sail's power and the boat's speed and controlability. Elvstr√∏m did not advertise his new invention, leaving his competitors mystified at his superior boat-speed. Investigation of his dinghy revealed nothing as he used to remove the kicking strap before coming ashore.|$|E

50|$|A fitter {{casualty}} may climb {{a ladder}} {{more or less}} unaided, although the dangers of approaching {{the stern of the}} boat in a rough sea should be considered if that is where the only useful ladder is. A fitter casualty {{may be able to get}} a foot onto a simple loop of rope and lift themselves to the rail. A hypothermic, injured or unconscious victim may be quite incapable of helping themselves. In this case netting, slings, an inflatable dinghy or liferaft may be employed, with or without the additional assistance of a 4:1 or better tackle. Such a tackle may be fashioned from a mainsheet, a <b>boom</b> <b>vang</b> (kicking strap), or may be purpose-made for the job and stored in case needed. The yacht's winches may also be of assistance.|$|E
50|$|Many {{cruising}} sailors {{prefer to}} rig two tackles (port and starboard) that {{run from the}} midpoint of the boom to blocks on a track such as the headsail-sheet-block track. These tackles are typically a 2 - 4 part tacklesfor greater purchase. This rig can also be used as a <b>boom</b> <b>vang</b> without taking up space underthe mast that may be essential to the cruising sailor for dinghy stowage and other uses.There is a possibility of breaking the main boom with a preventer rig such as this,but many modern yachts are considered to have short enough booms and be beamy enough to overlook this possibility in normal use. For example, while running with the preventer cleated, a large swell could roll the boat, dipping the boom end into the water, snapping the boom in half.|$|E
50|$|The mast {{on current}} boats uses {{externally}} run rigging to enable their being sealed and thus buoyant, reducing any tendency {{for the boat}} to invert in a capsize. Other innovations introduced with the boats included a centrally mounted bowsprit, a compression-strut kicker or Gnav {{in place of the}} conventional kicking strap or <b>boom</b> <b>vang,</b> and ‚Äòoff-the-boom‚Äô sheeting with a take-off block at mid-boom fed from an aft bridle. The latter two rigging variations give considerably more room in the boat for the crew members, and remove any objections levelled at the original boats of being cramped due to their centre-bridle and conventional kicker. The class rules permit all variations introduced since the original Laser 3000 to be retro-fitted to existing boats, which can generally be done with minimal trouble or expense.|$|E
5000|$|Part of {{the running}} rigging, topping lifts are {{primarily}} used to hold a boom up when the sail is lowered. http://www.sailingusa.info/weather_and_reefing.htm This line would run from near the free end of the boom(s) forward {{to the top of}} the mast. The line may be run over a block at the top of the mast and down to the deck to allow it to be adjusted. For small booms, the topping lift may be run from end of the boom to the backstay or next mast aft. When the sail is raised again, the topping lift is loosened or removed. On sailboats used for racing, boom lift function is frequently incorporated into the <b>boom</b> <b>vang</b> system, to reduce the number of lines aloft. Allowing the vang to take this function also simplifies operation of the boat. http://www.sail-world.com/CruisingAus/index.cfm?SEID=2&Nid=21818&SRCID=0&ntid=0&tickeruid=0&tickerCID=0 ...|$|E
50|$|It is sloop-rigged, with a {{mainsail}} {{larger in}} proportional size {{than any other}} boat of its length. Unlike most modern racing boats, it does not use a spinnaker when sailing downwind. Instead, when running downwind a whisker pole is used to hold the jib out to windward for correct wind flow. Early Stars were built from wood, but modern boats are generally made of fiberglass. The boat must weigh at least 671 kg with a maximum total sail area of 26.5 m2.The Star class pioneered an unusual circular <b>boom</b> <b>vang</b> track, which allows the vang to effectively hold the boom down even when the boom is turned far outboard on a downwind run. Another notable aspect of Star sailing is the extreme hiking position adopted by the crew and at times the helmsman, who normally use a harness to help hang low off the windward {{side of the boat}} with only their lower legs inside.|$|E
50|$|Sailors {{wishing to}} master the Contender must learn how to trapeze and steer the boat at the same time, and how to move about the boat while keeping it level. As part of race tuning, the Contender mast is {{commonly}} raked well aft, which results in restricted space between the boom and deck. Tacking consequently requires technique and practice to avoid getting stuck under the boom. Sailing the boat level at all times (except in very light winds) is fastest and reduces capsizes, which can happen fast if the boom dips into the water. There is a trade-off between raking the mast far aft and keeping the kicker (<b>boom</b> <b>vang)</b> tight at all times (which is faster) and the higher probability of capsizing due to this less forgiving set up. Unlike older and heavier dinghy designs, the Contender requires the centerboard to be lowered at least somewhat to avoid quick capsizes when reaching and running in a breeze.|$|E
50|$|The single sail of the Optimist is sprit-rigged. Two battens stiffen the leech. It is secured {{evenly with}} ties along the luff to the mast {{and along the}} foot to the boom, pulled down tightly by a vang/kicker. The light, slim third spar, the sprit, extends through a loop {{at the peak of}} the sail; the bottom rests in the eye of a short cable or string which hangs along the front edge of the mast. Raising and {{lowering}} the sprit and adjusting the <b>boom</b> <b>vang</b> allow for adaptation of sail trim to a range of wind conditions. Similarly, the Optimist has a small string outhaul on the end of the boom. It is usually correct to tighten the boomvang, outhaul, and sprit in heavy winds and loosen them in light winds. As well as this, huge adjustments can be made to sail shape, due to all of the ties running along the mast and boom.|$|E
50|$|A well {{designed}} spinnaker will have taut leading edges when filled; leading edges that curl in will both reduce the lift and risk {{a collapse of}} the spinnaker. A {{well designed}} spinnaker will also have a smooth curve when filled, with no bubbles or depressions caused by inconsistent stretching of the sail fabric. Any deviations from a smooth curve will cause the airflow over the leeward side of the sail to separate causing a reduction in lift and reduced performance.When running downwind in heavy weather or when hit by a gust, {{with or without a}} spinnaker, there may be a tendency for a roll of increasing amplitude to build up, known as the death roll. It has been shown that this is due to aerodynamic instability of bermuda rigs when running, which can be aggravated by gusts, waves, mainsail twist, daggerboard etc. too far down, hull form, and the sailing equivalent of pilot-induced oscillation. Excessive heel leads to loss of rudder effectiveness resulting in the boat slewing round uncontrollably in the direction opposite to the direction of heel. This is known as broaching. Aerodynamic instability when running can be countered by easing the pole forward slightly and over-sheeting the spinnaker somewhat to stop it swinging from side to side, by reducing mainsail twist using the <b>boom</b> <b>vang,</b> and by skillfully trimming the mainsheet. Luffing carefully onto a broad reach may help to retain control, as can moving everyone's weight as far aft as possible. Reducing sail should be considered.|$|E
