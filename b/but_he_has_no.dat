5|$|The Thanhouser {{production}} is {{an adaptation of}} {{only part of the}} novel. The film departs significantly from the original plot, such as in the omission of the double-wedding scene. It begins with Dr Charles Primrose, the vicar of Wakefield, attending a picnic with his landlord Squire Thornhill. The vicar does not like Squire Thornhill, who is reputed to be a degenerate young man, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> reservations once he sees Thornhill's interest in his daughter, Olivia. The next scene shows Squire Thornhill convincing Olivia to elope with him, so the two can be married. But Squire Thornhill has no intention of marrying her, and commissions a farmer to arrange a fake wedding ceremony. The farmer accepts, but shakes his fist in anger at the squire after he has departed.|$|E
25|$|While {{on their}} second road trip, Humbert becomes {{suspicious}} that a driver is following them. On one occasion, Humbert leaves Dolores in a Texas hotel to run errands. After returning, he discovers Dolores's hair is disheveled and her make up is smudged. He strongly suspects {{she has had}} sex with another man while he was out <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> way to prove it. Later in the trip, Dolores falls ill and Humbert checks her into a hospital while he stays in a nearby motel. After several days, he contacts a nurse at the hospital to inquire about Dolores's condition. However, the nurse surprises him by saying her uncle has paid her bill, checked her out and has taken her to her grandfather's home. Humbert knows Lolita has no living relatives and immediately realizes something is very wrong. He embarks on a frantic search to find Dolores and her abductor but fails.|$|E
25|$|Sir Roger’s sister-in-law, Mrs. Ackroyd, her daughter, Flora, his secretary, Geoffrey Raymond and Major Blunt, a guest, are {{relaxing}} in the hall. Mrs. Ackroyd and Flora live there {{due to their}} financial circumstances. They are utterly reliant on Sir Roger who tightly controls their money and consequently they are in some debt. They discuss {{a report in the}} newspaper of the suicide of a local woman, Mrs. Ashley Ferrars, during the previous night. She had a close relationship with Sir Roger and her death has greatly affected him. They further discuss the impending announcement of the engagement between Flora and Sir Roger’s stepson, Ralph Paton and the difference that this marriage will make. A young woman who is a neighbour, Caryl Sheppard, arrives to play bridge and Flora teases her over her fascination for a recent arrival in the village – a foreigner who Caryl thinks is called M. Porrott, but Flora reveals that her uncle has told her that he in fact is M. Hercule Poirot, the famous French detective. Poirot arrives and meets everyone. He is especially taken with Caryl. During the conversation, Caryl tells Flora that she thought she saw Ralph Paton in the village that morning but Flora is surprised – as far as she knew Ralph has been in London for the previous six months ever since he had an argument with his uncle. As Caryl's brother, Dr. James Sheppard, is dining at Fernley that evening, she will be alone and she invites Poirot to dine with her. They leave together. As the others go off to change for dinner, a maid, Ursula Bourne, tidies the room and meets Ralph when he comes in from the terrace. It is obvious that the two have a secret relationship but their conversation is interrupted as Bourne sees Dr. Sheppard approaching the house. Ralph quickly hides in the adjoining library and Dr. Sheppard enters to be greeted by Parker, the butler. Dr. Sheppard may have to rush out to a confinement case later and consequently he has his doctor's bag with him which Parker looks after. Sheppard is left to his own devices for a moment and Ralph comes out of hiding and tells the doctor, an old friend, that he is in a mess with his stepfather and that he is staying at a local inn, the White Horse. Ralph leaves the house and soon Sir Roger himself comes down into the hall. He too unburdens himself on Sheppard: Mrs. Ferrars was going to be his fiancée after the year’s mourning for the late Mr. Ferrars came to an end but, when the requisite time was up, she hesitated for three more months and then confessed that she poisoned her brutal husband. She was driven to suicide by an unknown blackmailer who knew of her actions and has been draining her of funds all this time. Sir Roger is certain that she would have left him a letter detailing who her persecutor was. At that moment, Parker comes in with a letter for Sir Roger – it is from the late Mrs. Ferrars <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> time to open it as the others come down for dinner.|$|E

[...] He unofficially competed with fellow Assistant Army Commander Anupong Paochinda, who, as 1st Army Area Commander, secured Bangkok {{on the night of}} the coup. [...] The Bangkok Post reported in October 2006 that Sonthi was grooming Anupong to be his successor by giving him responsibilities over coup logistics, a greater task than had been assigned to Saprang. [...] The Asia Times quoted a former MP as saying that [...] "Anupong is seen as the real force behind the coup. Saprang is more vocal, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> real base.

I’m certainly not interested in changing or contradicting anyone’s religious beliefs.

Chiron says he doesn’t want to delve into the issue of God, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> qualms about discussing the Olympians because they are a [...] "much smaller matter." ...|$|E

In the early 1990s, with the fall of communism, Stoppard found out that all four of his grandparents had been Jewish and had died in Terezin, Auschwitz and other camps, along with three of his mother's sisters. In 1998, following the deaths of his parents he returned to Zlín for the first time in over 50 years. He has expressed grief both for a lost father and a missing past, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> sense of being a survivor, at whatever remove.

2500|$|For {{most of the}} 20th century, judges had {{followed}} a maxim of Oliver Wendell Holmes when he found {{in favor of the}} city of New Bedford as a justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court: [...] "The petitioner may have a constitutional right to talk politics, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> constitutional right to be a policeman." [...] Throughout the early 20th century the Supreme Court had held similarly. Around the beginning of the McCarthy era {{in the middle of the}} century, as public employees were required to sign loyalty oaths and deny or repudiate past membership in the Communist Party or similar organizations, the Court sided with challenges to those laws, often by holding them too vague to be enforceable. These culminated in Keyishian v. Board of Regents, where the Court struck down a broad range of New York statutes and regulations requiring faculty at state-run colleges and universities to certify that they had never been members of the Communist Party.|$|E

He regrets going with her because boredom causes them to argue. Jerry reads the business section of the newspaper to see what happened to the stock since he sold it. The stock has risen dramatically. Vanessa then claims that Jerry only took her to Vermont because he lost so much money. Back in New York, George is celebrating the rising price of his stock, which has increased by $8,000. Elaine says that she gave Robert an ultimatum, and he chose the cats. George then tells Jerry and Elaine that Wilkinson has another stock tip involving some sort of [...] "robot butcher." ...|$|E

2500|$|Other operations: On 25 March 2016, Pakistan {{claimed that}} they arrested a RAW {{operative}} {{by the name of}} Kulbhushan Yadav who was operating in Balochistan province under the covername Hussain Mubarak Patel. Pakistan claimed that he was carrying a passport under that fake identity and used to operate a jewellery shop in Chahbahar, Iran. He is believed to be a retired commander-ranked officer in Indian Navy. According to a section of Pakistani media, He was involved in terrorist incidents in Karachi and Balochistan, most notably the terrorist attack on a bus full of Shia passengers in Safoora Goth, Karachi. However, Indian MEA said that though Yadav was an Indian Navy officer who retired prematurely, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> link with the government. The Indian High Commission has also sought consular access to Yadav but Pakistan has not agreed to it. According to Indian sources, Pakistan has fabricated the documents on the retired naval officer, Kulbhushan Jadhav, and leaked them without realising glaring loopholes in the same. The Iranian President Hassan Rouhani also, dismissed Pakistan's claim and state them as mere a rumour. According to Indian official, Yadhav owns a cargo business in Iran and had been working out of Bandar Abbas and Chabahar ports. [...] "It appears that he strayed into Pakistani waters.
