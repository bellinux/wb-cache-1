Unfortunately, <b>bituminous</b> <b>materials</b> will release volatile organic compounds (VOC), making them non-environmentally friendly.

In this research, the VOC emission and material behaviors were analyzed and compared to investigate the possibility of adding styrene butadiene styrene (SBS) and active carbon filler into <b>bituminous</b> <b>materials</b> to develop environmentally-friendly materials. Thermal gravimetric analysis-mass spectrometry (TG-MS) and ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy testing (UV-Vis) were employed to characterize the VOC emission process.

This study proposes a new general thermodynamic-based framework to specifically derive thermo-viscoelastic, thermo-viscoplastic, thermo-viscodamage, and micro-damage healing constitutive models for <b>bituminous</b> <b>materials</b> and asphalt mixes. The developed thermodynamic-based framework is general and can be applied for constitutive modeling of different <b>materials</b> such as <b>bituminous</b> <b>materials,</b> soft materials, polymers, and biomaterials. This framework is build {{on the basis of}} assuming a form for the Helmohelotz free energy function (i. e. knowing how the material stores energy) and a form for the rate of entropy production (i. e. knowing how the material dissipates energy). However, the focus in this work is placed on constitutive modeling of <b>bituminous</b> <b>materials</b> and asphalt mixes. A viscoplastic softening model is proposed to model the distinct viscoplastic softening response of asphalt mixes subjected to cyclic loading conditions. A systematic procedure for identification of the constitutive model parameters based on optimized experimental effort is proposed. It is shown that this procedure is simple and straightforward and yields unique values for the model material parameters. Subsequently, the proposed model is validated against an extensive experimental data including creep, creep-recovery, repeated creep-recovery, dynamic modulus, constant strain rate, cyclic stress controlled, and cyclic strain controlled tests in both tension and compression and over a wide range of temperatures, stress levels, strain rates, loading/unloading periods, loading frequencies, and confinement levels.

We used new <b>bituminous</b> <b>material</b> (Aquaphalt) which can solidify in water. We conducted relaxation test in tension for new <b>bituminous</b> <b>material</b> at various temperatures and obtained relaxation modulus of <b>bituminous</b> <b>material</b> at various temperatures.

40|$|In {{the last}} years, {{bituminous}} hot-mix recycling in plant {{has been used}} in several road pavement rehabilitation cases in Portugal. From the environmental and economical point of view, this practice is generally recognized as an efficient technique. Therefore, an increase in the production and application of reclaimed bituminous mixtures in hot plant is expected in Portugal, in the next years. Generally, the mix design procedures in use for usual bituminous mixtures may be adapted for hot-mix recycled in plant (HMR). However, the revision of the existing methods needs some additional procedures to carry out throughout the mix design process. These adaptations must take into account the influence of milled <b>bituminous</b> <b>material</b> and its components on the final recycled bituminous mixture properties.

The moisture permeation test provides an effective approach to analyze water storage mechanisms and moisture-related phenomena such as blistering in bituminous mixtures, although the test apparatus and condition settings require some improvement. 水分による歴青系舗装の損傷は，表面や路床から液状浸入した水が原因であると考えられてきた。しかし，滑走路等のアスファルト舗装表層は実質的に不透水であることが多い。したがって，著者らは大気中の水蒸気（湿気）がこれらの要因であると考え，この検証のために新しい透湿試験装置を開発した。透湿試験から，たとえ表層材料が実質的に不透水性であっても，典型的な夏の暑い日の気象条件においては水蒸気透過による物質移動により大気中の水分が透過し，凝縮した水分が混合物中に多量に蓄積しうることが明らかとなった。試験装置や試験条件に関してさらなる改良を加えることが必要であるものの，透湿試験は水分蓄積メカニズムの解明とブリスタリング現象等の水分に関連する損傷を評価する有効な試験方法である。Research Not...|$|E

The soaring cost of petroleum products since the early nineteen sixties has made the bitumen contribution to the cost disproportionately large.
