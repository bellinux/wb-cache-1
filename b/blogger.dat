40|$|Abstract—The {{nature of}} the Blogosphere determines that the {{majority}} of <b>bloggers</b> are only connected with a small number of fellow <b>bloggers,</b> and similar <b>bloggers</b> can be largely disconnected from each other. Aggregating them allows for cost-effective personalized services, targeted marketing, and exploration of new business opportunities. As most <b>bloggers</b> have {{only a small number of}} adjacent <b>bloggers,</b> the problem of aggregating similar <b>bloggers</b> presents challenges that demand novel algorithms of connecting the non-adjacent due to the fragmented distributions of <b>bloggers.</b> In this work, we define the problem, delineate its challenges, and present an approach that uses innovative ways to employ contextual information and collective wisdom to aggregate similar <b>bloggers.</b> A real-world blog directory is used for experiments. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, report findings, and discuss related issues and future work. I...|$|R

40|$|<b>Bloggers</b> devote {{significant}} {{time not}} only producing content {{for others to}} read, watch or listen to, but also paying attention to and engaging in interactions with other <b>bloggers.</b> We hope to throw light {{not only on the}} factors that gain <b>bloggers</b> significant readership and lively interactions with their audience, but also on the rules that govern their relations with others. We relate bloggers' activity with the size and structure of their network of fellow <b>bloggers.</b> A <b>blogger's</b> readership increases with his activity, while <b>bloggers</b> who read back proportionally fewer of their readers tend also to be more active. We find evidence that those <b>bloggers</b> who read back proportionally fewer of their readers have less readers than <b>bloggers</b> who reciprocate more, but tend to receive more comments per posts.

40|$|This paper investigates and {{contrasts}} {{male and}} female bloggers’ use of one specific part of a blog – its blogroll. Most blogs carry a blogroll. It {{is a list of}} the <b>blogger’s</b> favourite blogs or recommended reads. This research, part of a larger project, investigated the blogrolls of 120 US and UK <b>bloggers,</b> analysing both the sex and the geographical location of each recommended blog. Findings suggest that North American <b>bloggers</b> {{are far more likely to}} link to other North American <b>bloggers</b> while British <b>bloggers</b> are more willing to recommend overseas blogs to their readers, including a high number of US blogs. In addition, male <b>bloggers</b> are more likely to recommend other male <b>bloggers</b> to their readers. Such practices support the continued dominance of US <b>bloggers,</b> and in particular US men, at the more popular end of the blogosphere...|$|R

Many analysts predicted that Fresno State would emerge victorious, some going as far as to predict a blowout, but said that for SMU to emerge victorious, they would have to win the field position battle as well as create turnovers.|$|E
40|$|We {{argue in}} this paper that {{attention}} to one's blog is won by paying attention to other <b>bloggers.</b> We derive properties of blogging networks from a model where <b>bloggers</b> trade attention and content.

As predicted, the activity of <b>bloggers</b> {{is found to be}} related to the size and level of reciprocity within a <b>blogger's</b> relational network.
