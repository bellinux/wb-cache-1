40|$|Abstract: At present, {{degradation}} process of steel bridges has become {{major problem in}} all over the world. Steel bridges are exposed to numerous {{degradation process}}es during long year operation period, which causes various types of defects. Corrosion is one of major cause of deterioration process of steel bridge structures. Because of the corrosion, remaining load carrying capacities of steel bridge structures are gradually decreased. So {{it is very important}} to carefully evaluate the remaining strength of steel bridges in order to understand the feasibility of those steel structures for the current usage and to evaluate the necessity of retrofitting of selected corroded members to strengthen the existing structures. There are lots of researches have been conducted in order to find out remaining tensile strength of corroded steel bridge members. To find out remaining <b>buckling</b> <b>strength</b> of corroded steel, previously conducted tensile test results are not accurate. So evaluation of <b>buckling</b> <b>strength</b> is an essential source of information for carrying out a comprehensive evaluation of its current <b>buckling</b> <b>strength</b> capacity and also the parameters involve in the method should be easily measurable. There is a need of more brisk and accurate assessment method which can be used to make reliable decisions affecting the cost and safety. This study proposes a new method to calculate the remaining <b>buckling</b> <b>strengths</b> by using minimum thickness ratio based on the results of many <b>buckling</b> <b>strength</b> <b>tests</b> conducted on specimens of corroded steel bridge plates with different corrosion conditions based on the results of many compression coupon tests of actual corroded plates. And also, it is an impossible task to predict remaining <b>buckling</b> <b>strength</b> capacities of each and every aged bridge structure by conducting experiments and so nowadays, the finite element analysis method has become the most common, powerful and flexible tool in structural analysis and makes it possible to predict the strength of complex structures more accurately than existing classical theoretical methods. Further, since it is not easy to measure several thousands of points, to accurately reproduce the corroded surface by numerical methods and to predict their buckling behaviors, a simple and reliable analytical model is proposed by measuring only the maximum corroded depth (Tc,max), in order to estimate the remaining strength capacities of actual corroded members more precisely...|$|R

Main {{emphasis is on the}} effect of residual stresses and plastic working in the pro-duction process, on the <b>buckling</b> <b>strength.</b> A <b>test</b> specimen has a cross-section of 101. 6 q~ x 2. 9 t. Some specimens are annealed and others as-delivered. It is found that the magnitude of re-sidual stresses goes up to 70 % of the yield point stress, and a considerable gradient is observed inthe residual stresses in the radial direction across the thickness.

40|$|The combined-load (compression and shear) {{buckling}} equations {{were established}} for orthotropic sandwich panels {{by using the}} Rayleigh-Ritz method to minimize the panel total potential energy. The resulting combined-load buckling equations were used to generate buckling interaction curves for super-plastically-formed/diffusion-bonded titanium truss-core sandwich panels and titanium honeycomb-core sandwich panels having the same specific weight. The relative combined-load <b>buckling</b> <b>strengths</b> of {{these two types of}} sandwich panels are compared with consideration of their sandwich orientations. For square and nearly square panels of both types, the combined load always induces symmetric buckling. As the panel aspect ratios increase, antisymmetric buckling will show up when the loading is shear-dominated combined loading. The square panel (either type) has the highest combined <b>buckling</b> <b>strength,</b> but the combined load <b>buckling</b> <b>strength</b> drops sharply as the panel aspect ratio increases. For square panels, the truss-core sandwich panel has higher compression-dominated load <b>buckling</b> <b>strength.</b> However, for shear dominated loading, the square honeycomb-core sandwich panel has higher shear-dominated combined load <b>buckling</b> <b>strength...</b>|$|R

The panels have {{three types of}} face-sheet geometry: Flat face sheet, microdented face sheet, and microbulged face sheet. The metal-matrix composite panels have three types of face-sheet layups, {{each of which is}} combined with various types of hat composite layups. Finite-element method was used in the eigenvalue extractions for both mechanical and thermal buckling. The thermal buckling analysis required both eigenvalue and material property iterations. Graphical methods of the dual iterations are shown. The mechanical and thermal <b>buckling</b> <b>strengths</b> of the hat-stiffened panels with different face-sheet geometry are compared. It was found that by just microdenting or microbulging of the face sheet, the axial, shear, and thermal <b>buckling</b> <b>strengths</b> of both types of hat-stiffened panels could be enhanced considerably. This effect is more conspicuous for the monolithic panels. For the metal-matrix composite panels, the effect of fiber orientations on the panel <b>buckling</b> <b>strengths</b> was investigated in great detail, and various composite layup combinations offering, high panel <b>buckling</b> <b>strengths</b> are presented. The axial <b>buckling</b> <b>strength</b> of the metal-matrix panel was sensitive to the change of hat fiber orientation.

The finite-element method {{is used to}} {{study the effects of}} plate-support conditions, aspect ratio, and hole size on the mechanical <b>buckling</b> <b>strength</b> of the perforated plates subjected to linearly varying loading. Results show that increasing the hole size does not necessarily reduce the mechanical <b>buckling</b> <b>strength</b> of the perforated plates. It is also concluded that the clamped boundary condition increases the mechanical <b>buckling</b> <b>strength</b> of the perforated plates more than the simply-supported boundary condition and the free boundary conditions enhance the mechanical <b>buckling</b> <b>strength</b> of the perforated plates more effectively than the fixed boundary conditions. Furthermore, for the bending cases, the critical buckling load of perforated plates with free edges is less than perforated plates with fixed edges.

40|$|Thin plate {{structures}} are more {{widely used in}} many engineering applications {{as one of the}} structural members. Generally, <b>buckling</b> <b>strength</b> of thin shell structures is the ultimate load carrying capacity of these structures. The presence of cracks in a thin shell structure can considerably affect its load carrying capacity. Hence, in this work, static <b>buckling</b> <b>strength</b> of a thin square plate with a centre or edge crack under axial compression has been studied using general purpose Finite Element Analysis software ANSYS. Sensitivity of static buckling load of a plate with a centre or a edge crack for crack length variation and its vertical and horizontal orientations have been investigated. Eigen buckling analysis is used to determine the static <b>buckling</b> <b>strength</b> of perfect and cracked thin plates. First, bifurcation buckling loads of a perfect thin plate with its mode shapes from FE eigen buckling analysis are compared with analytical solution for validating the FE models.

For this purpose, a plate girder with a four-panel web girder stiffened by vertical and longitudinal stiffeners was selected, and its deformable behaviors and the principal stress distribution of the web panel at the shear <b>buckling</b> <b>strength</b> of the web were compared after their post-shear buckling behaviors, as well as their out-of-plane displacement, to evaluate the effect of the stiffener in the web panel on the shear buckling failure. Their critical shear buckling load and shear <b>buckling</b> <b>strength</b> were also examined. The FE analyses showed that their typical shear buckling failures were affected by the structural relationship between the web panel and each stiffener in the plate girder, to resist shear buckling of the web panel. Their critical shear buckling loads decreased from 82 % to 59 %, and their shear <b>buckling</b> <b>strength</b> decreased from 88 % to 76 %, due to the effect of corrosion of the stiffeners on their shear buckling behavior.
