5|$|One {{day when}} the boat is out, Sasha finds a <b>bag</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> very young cat inside it in the water. The captain takes him home and names him Patch. The spring thaw arrives, and the captain ties up the boat and prepares to go elsewhere. Sasha decides not {{to go with the}} captain and Patch because she now knows that she is going to have kits, and wants them born in the forest. Patch and the captain are sad, but they understand.|$|E
5|$|Lavagna {{refused to}} run for senator in the 2005 midterm elections, and criticized the {{overpricing}} of public works managed by Minister of Federal Planning Julio de Vido. As a result, Kirchner asked Lavagna to resign. Finance secretary Guillermo Nielsen, who managed the debt restructuring, also resigned. Felisa Miceli, head of Banco de la Nación Argentina, replaced Lavagna as Minister of Economy. Miceli resigned in 2007, months before the presidential elections, because of a scandal over a <b>bag</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> large amount of money which was found in her office bathroom. She was replaced by Secretary of Industry Miguel Gustavo Peirano.|$|E
5|$|The group {{decides to}} use Susan, who is least willing to {{participate}} in the plot, to distract Mr. Griffin by requesting a conference with him after school. Since Susan is one of his better-performing students with a serious approach to her studies, Mr. Griffin willingly does so, allowing her to walk him to his car afterwards. Jeff, David and Mark forcefully place a bag over Mr. Griffin's head and tie him up, replacing the <b>bag</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> blindfold as they take him to a remote spot in the mountains. Betsy, thanks to a speeding ticket, arrives in the parking lot after the boys have left with Mr. Griffin. Susan was supposed to ride with Betsy, but does not want any further part in the scheme and Betsy leaves without her. Mark tells Mr. Griffin to beg but he refuses, so the students decide to leave him alone there until midnight.|$|E

25|$|There {{is also an}} {{associated}} red velvet <b>bag</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> Victor’s Olive Crown embroidered on it in yellow silk cotton with the emblem “1883” {{in the middle of}} it. This bag was made by Mrs Anne Fletcher, wife of the manager of the NSW team, in early 1883.|$|E
25|$|The lift is {{controlled}} by {{a line from the}} surface vessel, and the load is reduced by a lift <b>bag</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> volume too small to support the weight of the load when full. This allows a faster lift by the winch. The lifting gear must be capable of supporting the load if the bag fails, or must be arranged to fail safely.|$|E
25|$|A zipper {{storage bag}} is a plastic <b>bag</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> sealed or zipped opening {{that allows for}} {{transparent}} viewing of stored items inside the bag. Better known under the brand name and genericized trademark Ziploc, zipper storage bags are commonly used to hold perishable foods and snacks. Zipper storage bags were patented by Robert W. Vergobbi on May 18, 1954. However, {{they would not be}} introduced to consumers until 1968, when Dow Chemical introduced the Ziploc bags.|$|E

50|$|In {{the book}} Final Exit by Derek Humphry, a suicide bag was {{described}} as <b>a</b> large plastic <b>bag</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> adjustable velcro strip around the neck. Its use with inert gases was mentioned in the Supplement to Final Exit in 2000.|$|R
25|$|The Humanitarian Daily Ration (HDR) is a {{self-contained}} Halal meal {{designed to be}} given to refugees and other displaced people. It is designed to feed a single person for a full day, and the menus were intended to be palatable to many religious and cultural tastes around the globe. To meet this goal, no animal products or by-products, no alcohol or alcohol-based products, and minimal dairy products are used in their production. It is otherwise created and packaged much like MREs; feedback from the Afghanistan campaign led to the interior packing being reinforced to withstand being air-dropped, as the packets sometimes ruptured on impact. The outer bag is tinted a high-visibility red or yellow and has an American Flag and a picture of a person eating out of the <b>bag</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> spoon. There are usually instructions printed on it in English and one or more local languages as well.|$|E
500|$|The Mackensens were {{equipped}} with a main battery of eight new 35cm SK L/45 guns in four twin gun turrets. The turrets were mounted in superfiring pairs fore and aft of the main superstructure. The guns were placed in Drh LC/1914 mountings, which could elevate to 20degrees and depress to −5degrees. The guns were supplied {{with a total of}} 720 armor-piercing shells, or 90 per gun. The weapons were designed to fire 600kg (1,323lb) shells at a rate of fire of around 2.5 shots per minute. The shells were fired with a muzzle velocity of [...] As with other heavy German guns, these weapons used a fore propellant charge in a silk <b>bag</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> main charge in a brass case. These guns could hit targets out to a maximum distance of [...]|$|E
500|$|Doc Kuhn is {{possibly}} the greatest ball {{player on the}} squad, due to his miraculous fielding around short this season. Starting with the opening college games he went for six straight games without an error, finally putting Tot McCullough off the <b>bag</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> wide heave that broke the run. The Michigan and Ohio coaches were loud in their praises for Kuhn {{as one of the}} greatest fielding shortstops they had seen in some time. His hitting this season has been hard and timely, including a homer, four triples, and three doubles. He hits in streaks, however, and this alone will keep the phenomenal Vandy star out of a major berth in the near future. Kuhn, Embry and McCullough stand out head and shoulders above anybody in their respective lines that has visited here in recent years.|$|E

2500|$|In Britain the Daily Mail {{newspaper}} encouraged {{women to}} manufacture cotton pads, and within one month {{a variety of}} pad respirators were available to British and French troops, along with motoring goggles to protect the eyes. The response was enormous and a million gas masks were produced in a day. [...] Unfortunately, the Mails design was useless when dry and caused suffocation when wet—the respirator {{was responsible for the}} deaths of scores of men. By 6 July 1915, the entire British army was equipped with the far more effective [...] "smoke helmet" [...] designed by Major Cluny MacPherson, Newfoundland Regiment, which was a flannel <b>bag</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> celluloid window, which entirely covered the head. The race was then on between the introduction of new and more effective poison gases and the production of effective countermeasures, which marked gas warfare until the armistice in November 1918.|$|E

[...] Sierra was the only company at that time willing to agree to this, and thus he signed with them.|$|R
50|$|Originally rubber {{bags were}} used to brace pallets inside trucks. They evolved into kraft paper <b>bags</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> plastic-bag interior. As metal {{strapping}} became less popular, many companies now use polyethylene- or vinyl-based bags because of their low cost. It is important to match {{the size of the}} bag to the void.|$|R

50|$|The MSX-DOS girl {{is often}} {{portrayed as a}} young grey-haired girl {{carrying}} <b>a</b> large cartridge-shaped <b>bag</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> MSX-DOS logo on it. There is even a short game portrayed this os-tan as the hero.
