5|$|Anti-Relief partisans opened many {{lines of}} attack against Desha. They said {{his refusal to}} {{articulate}} a specific campaign platform showed {{that he was trying}} to <b>be</b> <b>all</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>all</b> people. They assailed his military record, claiming he had only volunteered for service in the War of 1812 after being promised command of a division, that he balked at fighting and discouraged General Harrison's pursuit of the British and Indians, and that he billed excessive expenses to the government after his service. Desha's legislative career was also subject to scrutiny and attack. Anti-Relief partisans claimed that he had espoused certain positions for the sole purpose of pitting the state's agrarian interests against its aristocracy. They charged that he had secretly favored the Compensation Act of 1816 and had worked to pass it, despite his vote against it. In contrast to his rhetoric in favor of a strong, well-equipped army and navy, opponents claimed he had actually voted against increasing the military's budget. As further evidence of his lack of trustworthiness, they pointed to his vote for William H. Crawford while serving as a presidential elector in 1816, even though Kentuckians were nearly unanimous in their support of James Monroe.|$|E
25|$|Until the 1950s, {{the whole}} family seated around a set {{in the living room}} was the typical way of {{listening}} to radio. Stations tried to <b>be</b> <b>all</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>all</b> people, and specialised programming was not really thought about at this stage (it did not come in until the late 1950s). Because of this, programming on most stations was pretty much the same.|$|E
500|$|Keith Waterhouse's Mrs Pooter's Diary of 1983 is an {{adaptation}} of the Grossmith original that shifts the narrative voice to Carrie Pooter. In 1996 Helen Fielding used the imaginary diary format for Bridget Jones's Diary, which records the daily paraphernalia of a single woman's life. The New York Times critic wrote that it [...] "captures neatly the way modern women teeter between 'I am woman' independence and a pathetic girlie desire to <b>be</b> <b>all</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>all</b> men." [...] This diary began as a weekly column in The Independent, and was later published in books which sold more than 15 million copies in 40 countries. In the 1990s the satirical magazine Private Eye lampooned John Major, British prime minister 1990–97, in [...] "The Secret Diary of John Major aged 47", a hybrid of the Adrian Mole diaries with The Diary of a Nobody, which made much fun of Major's lower-middle class origins.|$|E

500|$|The {{album was}} {{generally}} criticized for its {{large number of}} collaborations and producers. The Guardians Caroline Sullivan argued that although [...] "others lend a hand [...] it's very much Stefani's show"; however, most others disagreed. Jason Damas of PopMatters compared the album to a second No Doubt greatest hits album, and Pitchfork's Nick Sylvester felt that {{the large number of}} collaborators result in sacrificing Stefani's identity on the album. Anthony Carew of Neumu expressed that the album's fragmentation kept it from being [...] "a bright-and-shiny pop-music [...] ". Most reviewers held that the collaborations prevented the album from having a solidified sound. Eric Greenwood wrote for Drawer B that [...] "Stefani tries to <b>be</b> <b>all</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>all</b> people here", but that the result [...] "comes off as manipulative and contrived." [...] Entertainment Weeklys David Browne shared this opinion, stating that the album [...] "is like one of those [...] retail magazines that resembles a catalog more than an old-fashioned collection of, say, articles." ...|$|E
500|$|Byzantine {{accounts}} of Thomas's rebellion state {{that he did}} not in fact claim the throne under his own name but assumed the identity of Emperor Constantine VI, who had been deposed and murdered by his mother, Irene of Athens, in 797. Most modern scholars follow Lemerle, who dismisses this as yet another later fabrication. If it contains any truth, it is possible that this story may originate from Thomas choosing to be crowned under the regnal name of [...] "Constantine", but there is no evidence for such an act. The possible appropriation of Constantine VI's identity is linked in some Byzantine sources with the statement that Thomas was a rumoured supporter of iconolatry, as opposed to Michael's support for iconoclasm: it was under Constantine VI that veneration of the icons was restored. Nevertheless, the ambiguous phrasing of the sources, the iconoclast leanings of many themes in Asia Minor, and Thomas's alliance with the Arabs seem to speak against any open commitment to icon worship on his part. Indeed, given Michael II's conciliatory approach during his early reign, the icon worship controversy {{does not seem to have}} been a major issue at the time, and in the view of modern scholars most probably did not play a major role in Thomas's revolt. The image of Thomas as an iconophile champion opposed to the iconoclast Michael II in later, Macedonian-era sources was probably the result of their own anti-iconoclast bias. Warren Treadgold furthermore suggests that if true, Thomas's claim to be Constantine VI may have been little more than a tale circulated to win support, and that Thomas pursued a [...] "studied ambiguity" [...] towards icons, designed to attract support from iconophiles. In Treadgold's words, [...] "Thomas could <b>be</b> <b>all</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>all</b> men until he had conquered the whole empire, and then he would have time enough to disappoint some of his followers".|$|E
2500|$|According to Bhutto biographer Shyam Bhatia, Bhutto had {{a desire}} to be liked and to be popular, and for this reason [...] "was {{prepared}} to <b>be</b> <b>all</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>all</b> people", having a [...] "chameleon-like" [...] quality to blend into her environment. He for instance noted that while in Pakistan she presented herself as a conservative Muslim [...] who always wore her head covered, while as a student in Oxford she adopted a more liberal lifestyle, tending to wear a T-shirt and jeans and occasionally drinking wine. Muñoz concurred, describing Bhutto as [...] "a woman of contradictions". As a politician, she was conscious of how her image was presented in Pakistan; she dressed modestly, was never photographed with a glass lest it be interpreted as containing alcohol, and would refuse to shake men's hands.|$|E

2500|$|Osbourne's co-hosts on The Talk, Leah Remini and Holly Robinson Peete were {{released}} from their contracts in 2011. Osbourne spoke of their dismissals in December 2011 on The Howard Stern Show, stating: [...] "Some people don't really {{know who they}} are, {{and you have to}} know who you are when you're in something like this. You can't pretend to be something you're not. You have to know your brand. You can't <b>be</b> <b>all</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> everyone."

60|$|So {{that was}} why Mr. Fyshe had asked Mr. Furlong to lunch with him, and to dine with him {{later on in the}} same day at the Mausoleum Club to meet the Duke of Dulham.

60|$|Mary's next {{patient was}} feminine, and James was again left to cool his heels in the road; but not alone, for Mr. Dryland {{came out of}} the cottage. The curate was a big, stout man, with reddish hair, and a {{complexion}} like squashed strawberries and cream; his large, heavy face, hairless except for scanty red eyebrows, gave a disconcerting impression of nakedness. His eyes were blue and his mouth small, with the expression which young ladies, eighty years back, strove to acquire by repeating the words prune and prism. He had a fat, full voice, with unctuous modulations not entirely under his control, so that sometimes, unintentionally, he would utter the most commonplace remark in a tone fitted for a benediction. Mr. Dryland was possessed by the laudable ambition to <b>be</b> <b>all</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>all</b> men; and he tried, without conspicuous success, always to suit his conversation to his hearers. With old ladies he was bland; with sportsmen slangy; with yokels he was broadly humorous; and with young people aggressively juvenile. But above all, he wished to be manly, and cultivated a boisterous laugh and a jovial manner.|$|E

60|$|Polytheism everywhere--in Greece especially--held of the animistic conception, {{with its}} freakish, corruptible deities. Greek {{philosophy}} could hardly restore that Eternal {{for whom the}} Prophets battled in Israel; whom some of the lowest savages know and fear; whom the animistic theory or cult everywhere obscures with its crowd of hungry, cruel, interested, food-propitiated ghost-gods. In the religion of our Lord and the Apostles the two currents of faith in one righteous God {{and care for the}} individual soul were purified and combined. 'God is a Spirit, and they who worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth.' Man also is a spirit, and, as such, {{is in the hands of}} a God not to be propitiated by man's sacrifice or monk's ritual. We know how this doctrine was again disturbed by the Animism, in effect, and by the sacrifice and ritual of the Mediaeval Church. Too eager 'to <b>be</b> <b>all</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>all</b> men,' the august and beneficent Mother of Christendom readmitted the earlier Animism in new forms of saint-worship, pilgrimage, and popular ceremonial--things apart from, but commonly supposed to be substitutes for, righteousness of life and the selflessness enjoined in savage mysteries. For the softness, no less than for the hardness of men's hearts, these things were ordained: such as masses for the beloved dead.|$|E
60|$|It was a {{great day}} for Sir Orlando. At half-past four the House was full,--not from any desire to hear Sir Orlando's {{arguments}} against the Bill, but because it was felt that a good deal of personal interest would be attached to the debate. If one were asked in these days what gift should a Prime Minister ask first from the fairies, one would name the power of attracting personal friends. Eloquence, if it be too easy, may become almost a curse. Patriotism is suspected, and sometimes sinks almost to pedantry. A Jove-born intellect is hardly wanted, and clashes with the inferiorities. Industry is exacting. Honesty is unpractical. Truth is easily offended. Dignity will not bend. But the man who can <b>be</b> <b>all</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>all</b> men, who has ever a kind word to speak, a pleasant joke to crack, who can forgive all sins, who is ever prepared for friend or foe but never very bitter to the latter, who forgets not men's names, and is always ready with little words,--he is the man who will be supported at a crisis such as this that was now in the course of passing. It is for him that men will struggle, and talk, and, if needs be, fight, as though the very existence of the country depended on his political security. The present man would receive no such defence;--but still the violent deposition of a Prime Minister is always a memorable occasion.|$|E
6000|$|Thus, {{looking back}} into the past, {{it seems to me}} that my own {{position}} of critical expectancy was just and reasonable, and must have been taken up, on the same grounds, by many other persons. If Agassiz told me that the forms of life which had successively tenanted the globe were the incarnations of successive thoughts of the Deity; and that he had wiped out one set of these embodiments by an appalling geological catastrophe as soon as His ideas took a more advanced shape, I found myself not only unable to admit the accuracy of the deductions from the facts of paleontology, upon which this astounding hypothesis was founded, but I had to confess my want of any means of testing the correctness of his explanation of them. And besides that, I could by no means see what the explanation explained. Neither did it help me to be told by an eminent anatomist that species had succeeded one another in time, in virtue of [...] "a continuously operative creational law." [...] That seemed to me to be no more than saying that species had succeeded one another, in the form of a vote-catching resolution, with [...] "law" [...] to please the man of science, and [...] "creational" [...] to draw the orthodox. So I took refuge in that [...] "thatige Skepsis" [...] which Goethe has so well defined; and, reversing the apostolic precept to <b>be</b> <b>all</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>all</b> men, I usually defended the tenability of the received doctrines, when I had to do with the transmutationists; and stood up for the possibility of transmutation among the orthodox--thereby, no doubt, increasing an already current, but quite undeserved, reputation for needless combativeness.|$|E

While there was much speculation that their former Talk co-host, Julie Chen, had involvement in the decision, as she is married to CBS President/CEO Leslie Moonves, it was Sharon Osbourne who stated, regarding their dismissals, in December 2011 on The Howard Stern Show: [...] "Some people don't really know who they are.
