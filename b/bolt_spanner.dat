5000|$|A {{peanut butter}} wrench, {{also known as}} a crank <b>bolt</b> <b>spanner</b> or a crank spanner, is a {{single-ended}} box wrench or ring spanner used in cycling to tighten older 14 mm and 15 mm crank bolts, or the wheel nuts (track nuts) on hubs with solid axles commonly found on track bicycles, particularly the 15 mm wrench made by Campagnolo. This is the only one-piece wrench {{that can be used to}} tighten or loosen the bolt or nut which holds the crank to a square-taper bottom bracket spindle (although a thin-walled 15 mm socket and handle will also serve), whereas any wrench/spanner of the correct size will tighten or loosen wheel nuts.|$|E
6000|$|... "His was an impenetrable darkness. I {{looked at}} him as you peer down at a man who is lying {{at the bottom of a}} precipice where the sun never shines. But I had not much time to give him, because I was helping the engine-driver to take to pieces the leaky cylinders, to {{straighten}} a bent connecting-rod, and in other such matters. I lived in an infernal mess of rust, filings, nuts, <b>bolts,</b> <b>spanners,</b> hammers, ratchet-drills--things I abominate, because I don't get on with them. I tended the little forge we fortunately had aboard; I toiled wearily in a wretched scrap-heap--unless I had the shakes too bad to stand.|$|R
