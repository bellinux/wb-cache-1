5|$|In {{the first}} two games of his Air Force career, DeBerry's Falcons jumped to an {{excellent}} start. In the team's 1984 opener, the Falcons defeated San Diego State, 3417. The following week, the Falcons <b>blew</b> <b>out</b> , 757. But after those two victories, things became more difficult for the Falcons. Air Force lost its next two games (at Utah and Wyoming) before defeating , Navy, and traditional football powerhouse Notre Dame.|$|E
5|$|When I {{would look}} at the films as a whole, I would search for story reasons to use 3-D in {{different}} ways. In Toy Story, for instance, when the toys were alone in their world, I wanted it to feel consistent to a safer world. And when they went out to the human world, that's when I really <b>blew</b> <b>out</b> the 3-D to make it feel dangerous and deep and overwhelming.|$|E
5|$|On 6 January 1966, Nell {{was driving}} the family car with Harry as a passenger; {{they were going to}} the south coast of Queensland for a holiday. A tyre <b>blew</b> <b>out</b> and the car rolled on the Leichhardt Highway near Condamine. Murray was taken to Miles District Hospital with broken ribs. He had {{suffered}} heart trouble for some time, and the shock of the accident is believed to have caused his death the following day. Murray was interred at Mount Thompson Crematorium with full military honours after a funeral service at St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church, Brisbane.|$|E

5|$|Another theory {{presented}} by an expert {{shortly after the}} crash theorized that an engine fire {{could have been the}} catalyst of the accident. Under this theory, one of the two engines on the right wing may have caught fire. Shrapnel from the engine may have punctured the fuselage, causing explosive decompression. Alternatively, Julian Frank, who was known to be desperately afraid of flying, may have panicked and hit the window, weakening it such that it subsequently <b>blew</b> <b>out.</b> Under this theory, the pilots and passengers would have been aware of an emergency aboard, which would have allowed them to begin making preparations for an emergency landing. This theory was supported by the wide right turn that the aircraft appeared to make prior to disintegrating and crashing, as well as {{the fact that some of}} the passengers were found wearing life jackets.|$|E
5|$|For the {{interior}} scenes used {{to depict the}} first moments of the Impala being hit, the actors were required {{to sit in the}} car in front of a blue screen; this allowed for the truck's headlights to later be added in with visual effects. The car itself was attached to a separate rig that was built to replicate the impact of the crash. As the scene was shot, the rig flipped the car onto its side. The passenger-side window was then shattered, though the actors were protected by a sheet of Lexan that had been placed very close to the window; at the same time, cannons beneath the frame <b>blew</b> <b>out</b> pieces of rubber glass to give the appearance that the window had exploded onto them.|$|E
5|$|I {{then got}} some Coal {{from one of}} the Pits nearest thereunto, which I {{distilled}} in a Retort in an open Fire. At first there came over only Phlegm, afterwards a black Oil, and then likewise a Spirit arose, which I could noways condense, but it forced my Lute, or broke my Glasses. Once, when it had forced the Lute, coming close thereto, {{in order to try to}} repair it, I observed that the Spirit which issued out caught Fire at the Flame of the Candle, and continued burning with Violence as it issued out, in a Stream, which 1 <b>blew</b> <b>out,</b> and lighted again, alternately, for several times.|$|E
50|$|Another tradition, {{commonly}} found in Cuba, is to have 14 ladies (sometimes 7), and 14 escorts (sometimes 7) as a court. The escorts hold flowers (usually roses) and the ladies carry candles. As the quinceañera dances the waltz with her father, she <b>blows</b> <b>out</b> one candle, then picks up one rose. This continues until she has <b>blown</b> <b>out</b> all the candles and picked up all the roses. The 14 candles <b>blown</b> <b>out</b> represent her 14 previous years, and with each she makes a wish. When the time comes to cut the cake, the quinceañera will <b>blow</b> <b>out</b> her last candle, thus completing her 15 wishes. The flowers are given to her mother.|$|R

5|$|In 1985, Hurricane Gloria <b>blew</b> <b>out</b> {{a window}} of the {{monument}}. In 1986, the State of Connecticut spent $6250 to re-mortar the monument. The monument was closed until 1989 for the repair work. In 2007, Carol Kimball of The Day wrote that the State of Connecticut has not funding repairs to the historic site, {{but it would be}} required if the monument were to continue to survive. Kimball also referenced a New York Times article on the neglected monument and that the bond commission has yet to issue the approved $350,000 for its preservation. Other costs including sidewalks surrounding the entrance, and Memorial Gate itself, would require another $150,000 to repair.|$|E
5|$|In November of {{that year}} the same group planted a bomb that <b>blew</b> <b>out</b> the front of Nussbaum's house, while {{he and his wife}} were {{sleeping}} there. Nussbaum blamed the bombings on local antisemitism and bigotry, but most of his congregation blamed it on Nussbaum's anti-segregationist activism. Though the congregation officially supported him, a number of members privately urged him to leave Beth Israel and find another pulpit. The synagogue's board of trustees voted to prohibit non-Jewish groups from using the synagogue's premises unless they had prior approval from the board; the intent was to put an end to the interracial meetings that Nussbaum held there.|$|E
5|$|In the playoffs, {{injuries}} limited Wade to a career-low {{scoring average}} of 15.9 points per game, but he upped his average to 19.6 {{points a game}} during the NBA Finals against the San Antonio Spurs. After the teams split {{the first two games}} in Miami, the Spurs <b>blew</b> <b>out</b> the Heat in game 3 to take a 2-1 series lead. In game 4, Wade scored 32 points on 56 percent shooting to go with 6 steals as the Heat defeated the Spurs 109-93. The Spurs would bounce back in game 5 despite Wade's 25 points and 10 assists. Wade scored 14 points in Miami's overtime win in game 6, followed by 23 points and 10 rebounds in game 7 as the Heat clinched their second straight championship and Wade's third title.|$|E

5|$|Moderate wind gusts {{throughout}} the state downed hundreds of trees, tree limbs, and power lines. Over 382,000people were without power, {{one of the worst}} power outages on record for area utilities. Downed trees and power lines closed major streets and schools in Union County. One downed tree greatly damaged a house in Middletown, and in Hudson County several trees fell onto and damaged cars. A downed tree in Englewood injured a woman when she was struck, and a woman in Independence Township was killed when a fallen tree landed on the vehicle she was driving. Strong winds from Isabel <b>blew</b> <b>out</b> the windows in an office building in East Rutherford, causing injuries to two women when they were struck. Throughout the state, damage totaled to about $50million (2003USD, $59million 2008USD).|$|E
5|$|The Hokies {{began the}} 2005 regular season ranked {{eighth in the}} country, and played their first game at ACC {{opponent}} North Carolina State. It was a close-fought game, but quarterback Marcus Vick threw a game-winning touchdown {{early in the fourth}} quarter and the defense slowed a late NC State rally as Virginia Tech earned a 2016 win. Following the close call against NC State, the Hokies <b>blew</b> <b>out</b> their next several opponents. Virginia Tech defeated Duke and Ohio by scores of 450 each. The Virginia Tech defense held Duke's offense to just 35total yards, an NCAA record. Following those victories, Tech hosted 15th-ranked Georgia Tech, beating the Yellow Jackets by a score of 517. Tech's defensive success in those games was typical of the season as Virginia Tech won the first eight games of its season.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1997, a storm <b>blew</b> <b>out</b> the main two-story window {{at the front of}} the building, and the window's wooden frame was rotten, cracked and could not be saved. The window {{remained}} unrepaired, which left the sanctuary open to the elements for a month before the congregation, down to approximately 100 members, asked for assistance. The congregants had, by then, long held services in a smaller room, using the sanctuary only on the High Holidays. The New York Landmarks Conservancy's Endangered Buildings fund gave $2,500 for a temporary metal window, and assisted in getting approval from the Landmarks Preservation Commission for the work required to repair the damage, but the congregation did not have the $10,000 required to pay for it. Beth Hamedrash Hagodol received an additional $2,000 from the New York Landmarks Conservancy's Sacred Sites program in 1998 for a conditions survey. In 1999 a second application for National Historical designation was made, this time successful; the building was deemed significant at the local level, and was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 30.|$|E

5|$|The fourth tornado of the {{outbreak}} touched down around 2:45a.m. EST near Peacocks Crossroads in Johnston County, knocking down several trees, {{some of which}} were mature. Significant roof damage occurred after the tornado struck a double-wide mobile home and destroyed the porch of another home. Another mobile home had some of its siding torn off before the tornado dissipated. No injuries were reported {{as a result of the}} tornado and damages amounted to $30,000. The tornado was rated as an EF1 by the National Weather Service. The fifth tornado of {{the outbreak}} touched down around 3:03a.m. EST near U.S. Route 70, damaging several pine trees and causing minor roof damage. Tracking towards the northeast, the tornado destroyed a carport and the car inside. A trailer was rolled on its side and a nearby home sustained siding and shingle damage. Afterwords, the tornado struck a horse farm where it destroyed a small barn and damaged a stable. Before dissipating, the tornado <b>blew</b> <b>out</b> the windows in the garage of one home. No injuries were reported as a result of the tornado and damages amounted to $75,000. The tornado was rated as a high-end EF0 by the National Weather Service.|$|E
5|$|UConn went unbeaten {{through the}} Conference {{regular season and}} Tournament and easily {{advanced}} into the NCAA Tournament; in the regional final against Virginia a 4-points win in their closest {{game of the year}} opened the doors of the Final Four at the Target Center in Minneapolis. UConn <b>blew</b> <b>out</b> Stanford in the semifinals behind Wolters' 31 points, reaching the championship game for a rematch against Tennessee. In the final game UConn found itself in early trouble when Lobo was called for three personal fouls in 94 seconds in the first half, but in the second half the team was able to rally from a 9-point deficit and a key Rizzotti layup gave UConn the lead with less than 2 minutes to go, a lead that the team kept until the final score of 70–64 and their first national title. Rebecca Lobo was named the Final Four's Most Outstanding Player.|$|E
5|$|At the Delaware Breakwater East End Lighthouse in Lewes, strong waves {{destroyed}} the lower {{deck of the}} lighthouse, while powerful winds <b>blew</b> <b>out</b> the watchroom window. A group of eight volunteers quickly repaired the damage. Moderate wind gusts knocked down numerous trees, tree limbs, and power lines, causing widespread power outages in the state. Conectiv Energy reported the power outage associated with the hurricane {{as one of the}} worst in its history. At least 15,300 were left without power during the worst of the hurricane, including 2,500 in the capital city of Dover. Due to the power outages, only one traffic light north of the city of Wilmington was operational. The strong winds also resulted in the Delaware River and Bay Authority to reduce the speed limit on the Delaware Memorial Bridge to 40mph (65km/h). 62roads throughout the state were initially closed due to flooding, downed trees, or downed power lines. Eight roads, including U.S. Route 13A remained closed for several days, primarily due to flooding. Flooding affected the cities of Seaford, Blades, Bayview, and Augustine Beach, with residents in the latter two being forced to evacuate due to severe flooding conditions. Several state parks reported downed trees and damage. Damage in the state totaled $40million (2003USD, $44million 2006USD), and there were no deaths in the state {{as a result of the}} storm.|$|E

5|$|Bosh {{remained}} the Heat's starting center during the 2012–13 season. On February 15, 2013, Bosh was picked as an All-Star starter over the injured Rajon Rondo by coach Erik Spoelstra. The Heat achieved the league's best record and {{swept through the}} first round of the playoffs against the Milwaukee Bucks before defeating the Chicago Bulls in five games, with Bosh scoring 20 points to go with 19 rebounds in a crucial Game 3 win in Chicago. Bosh averaged 12.1 points per game throughout the playoffs, as the Heat advanced to the NBA Finals to face the San Antonio Spurs following a grueling seven-game series against Indiana. The Heat and Spurs split the first two games before the Spurs <b>blew</b> <b>out</b> Miami in Game 3 to take a 2–1 series lead. In Game 4, Bosh scored 20 points and grabbed 13 rebounds to complement Wade's 32 points and James' 33 points to bolster the Heat's win, tying the series. San Antonio would bounce back in Game 5 to force the Heat to win the final two games at home. In the final seconds of Game 6, James missed a three-pointer, and Bosh grabbed the offensive rebound and found a wide open Ray Allen in the corner. Allen hit the shot to tie the game, and in overtime the Heat had a three-point lead with seconds left. San Antonio inbounded the ball to Danny Green, who attempted a corner three, but Green's shot was blocked by Bosh to secure the Heat's victory. Bosh was held scoreless in Game 7 by Tim Duncan, but the Heat still won the game and the series to claim their second consecutive NBA Championship.|$|E
5|$|Delta caused {{considerable}} {{damage in the}} Canary Islands. The storm claimed nineteen lives and caused a total of €312million ($364million 2005 US dollars) damage throughout the archipelago. Eighteen died when a boat sank off the Canary Islands; twelve of the bodies were never found. The nineteenth man was killed when while trying to repair his roof during the storm; winds threw him from his ladder. The islands of Tenerife and La Palma were hardest hit, with many uprooted trees and landslides reported. The peak gust recorded at La Palma was 95mph (152km/h), and at Tenerife the maximum gust was 90mph (147km/h). Some patients at Tenerife's University Hospital were evacuated to a safer {{part of the building}} when paneling from the hospital's heliport was torn free and smashed some of the building's windows. Off Santa Cruz's southern quay a tug boat broke its ties, collided with another vessel, and sank. Passengers at Tenerife North Airport, who were stranded when their flights canceled, witnessed parts of the new international terminal's roof tear off in the wind. In La Palma a falling palm tree, trunk snapped by the wind, injured the leg of a German tourist. Many palm trees along the Avenida Marítima were also blown down. The storms winds <b>blew</b> <b>out</b> windows and collapsed cornices, although other structural damage was minimal. Metal plates that had been used to board up buildings were strewn all over the island.|$|E
5|$|On 30 March 1999, the Council met to {{initiate}} {{planning for a}} centre to house the visual and performing arts at the former Civic Centre site in the Port Macquarie central business district. It recommended a project plan be developed by 2001. On 21 August 2000 a Cultural Facilities Taskforce was created. In December 2000, the Council approached {{the management of the}} neighbouring shopping centre, Port Central, about a possible joint venture on the site, and the Council endorsed further negotiations on 28 May 2001. The joint venture was expected to cost around A$13.5 million, with the Council contributing A$7.3 million. The joint venture collapsed in August 2002 because the Council was not prepared to accommodate the needs of their commercial partner to make the project viable, and decided to go it alone. The new centre became an icon building {{under the direction of the}} Council's General Manager, managed by a Project Control group including the Mayor and Deputy Mayor. The costs <b>blew</b> <b>out</b> considerably by 28 June 2004, when the Council unanimously backed the project, outlays had already reached A$15A$20 million, and by late 2007 they had reached A$41.7 million. This was due to a range of factors including, that the Council bought and demolished neighbouring shops to make the facility big enough to include meeting rooms and conference facilities, and a drain built by convicts in the 19th century, and still in remarkably good condition, was discovered by archaeologists and needed to be preserved.|$|E
