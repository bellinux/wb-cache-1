5000|$|From Type MP1 to Type XP1, {{alteration}} to {{the intermediate}} and <b>buffing</b> <b>gear.</b>|$|E
5000|$|From Type TM to Type XM1, {{alteration}} to {{the intermediate}} and <b>buffing</b> <b>gear.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Times {{newspaper}} also {{demanded the}} introduction of improved couplings and <b>buffing</b> <b>gear</b> between the coaches so as {{to reduce the risk}} of telescoping.|$|E
50|$|An {{interesting}} {{development of}} the original transporter wagon concept (with bar couplers between each wagon) was that the bar couplers were discarded in favour of connecting all standard gauge wagons directly with each other by means of their ordinary <b>buffing</b> and draft <b>gear.</b> This was tried {{for a few years}} in Sweden just before the last narrow gauge freight lines were closed in the 1980s.|$|R
50|$|At the {{beginning}} of an encounter, each combatant makes an initiative roll modified by initiative effects from stats, <b>gear,</b> <b>buffs,</b> abilities, and other modifiers. Ties are broken by luck stat. Portraits are displayed {{along the top of the}} screen showing the current order of initiative. If there is not enough room for all the combatants, < > arrows are added to scroll through combatants. Players have a brief amount of time to confer before the battle begins. The default time for this is 60 seconds but the party leader can end this by clicking BATTLE at any time before the timer expires.|$|R
40|$|Rubber {{is a very}} {{flexible}} material with many desirable properties Which enable its broad use in engineering practice. Rubber or rubber-metal springs are widely used as anti-vibration or anti-shock components in technical systems. Rubber-metal springs are usually realized as a bonded assembly, however especially in shock absorbers, {{it is possible to}} realize free contacts between rubber and metal parts. In previous research it authors was observed that friction between rubber and metal in such case have a significant influence on the damping characteristics of shock absorber. This paper analyzes the development process of rubber or rubber-metal shock absorbers realized free contacts between the constitutive parts, starting from the design, construction, testing and operation, with special emphasis on the development of rubber-metal springs for the <b>buffing</b> and draw <b>gear</b> of railway vehicles...|$|R
5000|$|At some stage before 1941, the {{intermediate}} draw and <b>buffing</b> <b>gear</b> {{of two of}} the tenders, numbers 1607 and 1615, were altered to an [...] "X_" [...] tender configuration. These two tenders were reclassified to Type XM1.|$|E
5000|$|Type XM1 tenders were Type TM tenders {{which were}} {{reclassified}} after their intermediate draw and <b>buffing</b> <b>gear</b> were altered to an [...] "X_" [...] tender configuration. They first entered service in 1912, as tenders to the SAR Class MC 2-6-6-0 Denver type Mallet locomotive.|$|E
50|$|At some stage, {{probably}} {{after its}} engine was withdrawn from service c. 1937, the intermediate draw and <b>buffing</b> <b>gear</b> of Type MP1 tender no. 1634, off a Class MC1 Mallet locomotive, was altered to suit Class 10 4-6-2 Pacific no. 746. This modification converted no. 1634, {{which was also}} modified by shortening and raising {{the sides of the}} coal bunker, to the sole Type XP1 tender.|$|E
50|$|At some stage, {{probably}} {{after the}} Class MC1 were withdrawn from service in 1939, the intermediate draw and <b>buffing</b> <b>gear</b> of Type MP1 tender no. 1634 was altered to suit Class 10 4-6-2 Pacific no. 746. This modification converted no. 1634 to the sole Type XP1 tender. During the early 1960s, the tender {{was attached to}} Class 4AR Mountain no. 1560. This locomotive and the tender were both withdrawn from service by 1974.|$|E
50|$|The <b>buffing</b> <b>gear</b> between {{engine and}} tender {{consisted}} of a laminated spring, contained in a steel casting attached to the tender's front buffer beam. The tender was the Type JT which was first introduced in 1935 along with the Class 15E Mountain type and Class 16E Pacific type. The tender had a coal capacity of 14 lt t, a water capacity of 6000 imp gal and an axle load of 17 lt 15 lcwt kg.|$|E
50|$|Prior to the {{modification}} of its intermediate draw and <b>buffing</b> <b>gear</b> {{to convert it}} to the Type XP1, the tender had already been modified. Most of the Type MP1 tenders were modified by shortening and raising {{the sides of the}} coal bunker, in effect making the coal {{at the rear of the}} bunker more easily accessible to the stoker and apparently without affecting the tender's coal capacity. The profile of the Type XP1 tender corresponds with the official dimensional drawing of such a modified Type MP1.|$|E
50|$|Two of the {{locomotives}} {{were later}} modified by the SAR. No. 745 {{was equipped with}} 1 in larger diameter tyres on its coupled wheels, while no. 746 was coupled to a modified Type MP1 tender. The intermediate draw and <b>buffing</b> <b>gear</b> of the tender, no. 1634 off a Class MC1 Mallet locomotive, was altered to suit no. 746. This modification converted tender no. 1634 to the sole Type XP1 tender. While it had the same coal capacity as the Type XM2 with which the locomotives were delivered, it had a 250 imp gal larger water capacity.|$|E
50|$|The Class 12 {{locomotives}} {{introduced a}} new Type MP1 tender with a coal capacity of 10 lt t and a water capacity of 4250 imp gal. This marked {{the introduction of a}} standard tender type which, with few modifications, was eventually to be used on all the Hendrie-designed locomotives. The tender bogies were interchangeable with other tender types operating in the Transvaal and Orange Free State at the time, while its centre longitudinal frame members were carried through unbroken from buffer to buffer. The arrangement of the <b>buffing</b> <b>gear</b> between engine and tender {{was the result of a}} long series of experiments, made with the view to avoid excessive fore and aft action between engine and tender while running at high speed.|$|E
