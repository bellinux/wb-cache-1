Looking at the distribution system in Eastern Europe {{we can see that}} in recent years there has been considerable growth in the weight of the large-scale specialist retail trade. In this channel by far the largest share of turnover is generated by the chains, while franchised networks are still not very developed and play a much more modest role, and {{the same can be said}} of the <b>buying</b> <b>associations.</b> Many of the chains made their entries on the markets being studied in the Nineties, but the presence of big international names in distribution has been gradually intensifying. This report offers a comparative analysis of home furniture distribution in Eastern Europe (Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Romania), providing trends in home furniture consumption, distribution channels, market shares, retail formats, home furniture imports and short company profiles. For each country home furniture consumption is broken down according to distribution channel: furniture chains, franchises, buying groups; independent furniture retailers; non-specialist distributors (department stores, multi-stores, hypermarkets, DIY, mail order); direct sales and craftsmen. The analysis of furniture distribution by product/segment covers: upholstered furniture and kitchen furniture. Home furniture imports are broken down by country, geographical area and product (upholstered furniture, kitchen furniture, dining and living room furniture, bedroom furniture, non-upholstered seats and other furniture). Short profiles of major home furniture distributors with analyses of sales performances and market shares are also available. ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} consumer’s attitude towards licensed products in relation to the parent brand, with respect to perceived quality, likelihood to buy and associations’ transferability. Background: Brand licensing has become one of an increasingly popular ways of stretching a brand into new product categories to reach more consumers in new markets. Despite the fact that brand licensing is less risky than building a brand from scratch, the odds that licensed products will fail are still high. That is why, it is interesting to investigate consumers’ attitudes towards brand licensing in fast moving consumer goods sector and see how perceived quality, likelihood to buy and transferability of parent brand associations will impact the licensing strategy. Method: The authors will use quantitative approach; data will be gathered using self-administered questionnaires. Furthermore, the data will be analysed using SPSS, namely by employing Spearman’s correlation. Conclusion: The results of this study indicate that perceived quality, likelihood to <b>buy</b> and <b>associations</b> of the parent brand have a positive impact on the licensed products only if there is a high degree of perceived fit between the two product categories. Consumers welcome new licensed product that is in the related product category, however, the consumers appear to be sceptical to the product that is outside of the core market of the parent brand...|$|R

The outcome of this study will give a perspective on Swedishness in Swedish companies, brands and products with French consumers. References to places and countries such as French wine, Hollywood movies, and Russian roulette are examples of how the origin of countries can create associations influencing consumers' product evaluation and buying behaviour. In the process of understanding French consumers' product country image in relation to Sweden, it is important to map their <b>buying</b> behaviour and <b>associations</b> to Swedish companies, brands and products. The consumer perception of the country of origin can together with other attributes add brand equity to a company, brand or a product. Purpose: The purpose of this study is to understand how Swedishness in Swedish brands and products influences the perception of quality and to assist companies in their decision making on how to market in France. Conclusion: French consumers are influenced by global and national perceptions of countries of origin. Swedishness and Scandinavia have a particularly good reputation with French consumers.

40|$|The {{credibility}} and consistency of brands are central elements in {{its position in}} the minds of con	sumers, reducing the uncertainty linked to the <b>buying</b> processes, building <b>associations</b> and solidifying relationships of trust, repeated purchases and brand equity. Retailers started to sell their own brands – Private labels – positioned at low-end segments, based on low price and low quality. Actually we observe the coexistence of PLs with different qualitative levels, based on branding strategies that may include umbrella and/or independent names: private labels are a central strategic issue for all major food retailers. These labels may contribute to increase retailer’s differentiation, exclusivity, associations, loyalty, and, as a consequence, retailer brand equity. Brand equity results from the brand-market interaction, reflected in consumer’s perceptions, preferences and buying behaviors, built from all interactions developed between the consumer and the brand. Recent research tried to conceptualize the brand equity concept to retailers, building and testing “store equity” metrics, has the differential effect of the knowledge about retailers in consumers buying behaviors. Two of the most representative scales about brand equity in retail industry were developed by Arnett, Laverie & Meieres and Pappu & Questerb. This paper is part of an investigation process; focus on measuring Private labels brand equity in the food retailing industry.

These include: Welfare reform: since their election in May 2015, the Conservative Government have outlined a range of additional welfare reforms that are likely to affect the incomes of many Housing Association tenants. These include the extension of the overall benefit cap, freezes on various working age benefits and the continued roll out of Universal Credit Housing policy: the Housing and Planning Act (2016) outlined a number of changes to housing policy including the introduction of ‘pay to stay’ for social renters on higher incomes. The Act also provides funding for the extension of the Right to <b>Buy</b> to Housing <b>Association</b> tenants Governance and role of Housing Associations: the government is reassessing the governance of Housing Associations through a review of the Homes and Communities Agency.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{investigate}} the perception of Italian university students (Agricultural Sciences, Nutrition, Medicine, Biological Sciences, Economics, Political Science, Law) and researchers (Council for Agricultural Research and Economics and National Research Council) toward the introduction of GMOs in agro-forestry. The factors determining positive or negative attitudes towards GMOs were analyzed {{by means of a}} targeted questionnaire consisting of 42 multiple questions divided into four units: Knowledge, Opinion, Trust, Identity. The survey followed different approaches: descriptive, to assess the level of social approval of the GMOs; explorative, to detect the factors of social acceptability; comparative, to investigate cultural differences. The extent of "social acceptability" of GMOs was assessed in relation to variables such as demographics, knowledge of the meaning of GMOs, perception of the relationship between nature and science, attitudes toward the limit s of human intervention in nature, trust in institutions and regulatory policies. The questionnaire was structured with closed questions (Likert scale). Out of 560 questionnaires distributed to students, 303 replied; while out of 400 questionnaires sent to researchers, 123 replied. Data were processed through a multivariate analysis approach involving: multiple correspondence analysis (MCA), hierarchical clustering (HCA), principal component analysis (PCA) and k-means (K-m). MCA showed a clear distinction between the responses of university students and researchers; while HCA highlighted, for both, the different perception of experts and non-experts in the biotechnology field as for Knowledge, Opinion and Trust. PCA and K-m demonstrated that the positive or negative opinion toward GMOs, as for students, does not depend on their knowledge, but it is strongly associated with the level of trust in the institutions. To the contrary, as for researchers, it is related to the knowledge level of of this issue, without any linkage with the trust in the institutions. This kind of study represents a key process for understanding the social, ecological and economic dynamics that have an important impact on citizens, society and community, at national/international level. This information, amplified at different scales of interest, plays a key role for both experts (e. g. scientists, decision makers, producers) and end-users (e. g. stakeholders, <b>associations,</b> <b>buying</b> groups, persons).
