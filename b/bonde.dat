A configura????o desses grupos se d?? na jun????o de indiv??duos, moradores das periferias da cidade, os quais sofrem um processo de segrega????o e estigmatiza????o que tende a confin??-los em seus espa??os de moradia. Negando essa territoriliza????o, mas sem perder o sentido de perten??a, esses jovens agregam-se em torno de s??mbolos de poder, masculinidade e viol??ncia, para semantizar seu grupo, e saem em circula????o pelos espa??os movimentados da capital onde possam fazer-se vis??veis. A associa????o desses jovens n??o se d?? apenas pela no????o de proximidade vicinal e de perten??a ?? periferia, mas tamb??m como resposta a uma situa????o de conflito sentida no {{interior}} do grupo pela forma como s??o mal vistos em suas incurs??es at?? o centro. A partir da defini????o dessa situa????o, os jovens se organizam em grandes grupos que levam, no nome ou nos cantos que entoam, a defesa simb??lica da comunidade em que vivem. Eles se utilizam do conflito e a da estigmatiza????o que sofrem, por parte dos demais moradores da cidade, para estabelecer uma experi??ncia social compartilhada, fundando nela sua subjetiva????o. Este trabalho se desenvolveu mesclando, paralelamente, pesquisa de campo com integrantes e ex-integrantes dos <b>bondes</b> nas suas comunidades e pesquisa bibliogr??fica como forma de compreender cada dado novo por diferentes perspectivas. Desse modo, o estudo ?? dividido em cap??tulos que conjugam teoria e empiria num esfor??o por observar a a????o dos <b>bondes</b> a partir de diferentes clivagens. Para compreender os diferentes conte??dos sem??nticos constituidores dessa sociabilidade, este trabalho foi estruturado em eixos te??rico-anal??ticos: periferia e estigmatiza????o, conflito e viol??ncia, identidade e reconhecimento e est??tica e g??nero. Assim, a abordagem metodol??gica deste estudo conformou a percep????o dos <b>bondes</b> atravessados por cada eixo tem??tico numa tentativa de olhar o objeto por diferentes planos. This dissertation is {{the result}} of a research on so-called <b>bondes</b> in Porto Alegre. The sociability style of these trams is analogous to Cariocas galleys locals, young people who get together to hang out and enjoy the leisure spaces. The configuration of these groups occurs at the junction of individuals, residents of the city???s outskirts, which suffer a process of segregation and stigmatization that tends to confine them in their places of residence. Denying this territorialisation, but without losing the sense belonging, they add up around symbols of power, masculinity and violence to semanticizing your group, and go into circulation by the capital???s crowded spaces where they can make themselves visible. The association of these young people not only gives the vicinal closeness sense and belonging to the outskirts, but also in response to a situation of conflict felt within the group by how are perceived negatively in their forays to the center. From the definition of the situation, young people are organized in large groups that lead, in name or corners to chant in symbolic defense of the community in which they live. They use the conflict and stigmatization suffered by the others residents of the city to establish a shared social experience, founding it their subjectivity. This work was developed merging parallel, field research with members and former members of the <b>bondes</b> in their communities and bibliography research as a way to understand each new data from different perspectives. Thus, the study is divided into chapters that combine theory and empiricism an effort to observe the action of <b>bondes</b> from different divisions. To understand the different semantic matter of this sociability, this work was structured into theoretical and analytical axes: outskirts and stigmatization, conflict and violence, identify and recognition and aesthetics and gender.

Neither Margaret herself nor her successors observed the stipulation that in each of the three kingdoms only natives should hold land and high office, and the efforts first of Denmark (at that time by far the strongest member of the union) to impose her will on the Union's weaker kingdoms soon produced secessions.

25|$|Being {{experienced}} and having many important relationships, {{he was a}} prominent member of a regency but he looked too much {{to the past and}} the traditions during the Thirty Years' War and therefore lacked a vision suitable to the demands of a new era. The regency was divided into parties. De la Gardie was the main representative of the party in favour of warlike adventures and a close relationship to France. The opponents, represented by Lord High Treasurer Gustaf <b>Bonde,</b> Lord High Steward Per Brahe the Younger and Johan Gyllenstierna, were advocates of a more peaceful and economical way. The opinions of De la Gardie's side most often won out and, therefore, Sweden was nearly drawn into wars against Russia and Poland during the regency period. Early on in the period, in 1661, Sweden and France signed a treaty which included a secret paragraph committing Sweden to support the French candidate on the first vacancy of the Polish throne, in exchange for a large sum of money. In April 1672, the two allies signed a new treaty in Stockholm. According to this treaty, Sweden would keep an army of 16,000 men in its German dominions to make sure the German states would not interfere in a war between France and its enemies the Netherlands and Spain. In return, Sweden would receive 400,000 riksdaler annually in peacetime. In wartime, the amount would be increased to 600,000 riksdaler. In a Sweden with great financial problems, these subsidies was, in Count De la Gardie's thinking, a more attractive way to improve the state's finances than a reduction, which would mean that lands granted the nobility would be reclaimed by the Crown.|$|E

The specific name refers to Bornholm. <b>Bonde</b> and Christiansen had expected the first Danish dinosaur remains to be teeth of herbivorous dinosaurs such as hypsilophodonts or Iguanodon, and were surprised to find a dromaeosaur tooth instead, since these are rare in Early Cretaceous formations; herbivores would have been more abundant than carnivores. Because the dromaeosaur seems to have been large, they expected that resilient bones, such as claws, might be found in the future. The palaeontologists did not expect bones of larger dinosaurs to be discovered in the formation (since these would most likely have been found when the sand was commercially exploited), but hoped the remains of a Mesozoic mammal would be found.

40|$|An {{important}} task in nondestructive materials evaluation {{is the development}} of techniques to characterize the bond quality of adherent joints. Binding forces are nonlinear and cause a nonlinear modulation of transmitted and reflected ultrasonic waves. As a consequence, the higher harmonics generated by an insonified monochromatic wave give information about the adhesive <b>bondes.</b> The local binding forces in thin bonded interfaces can be obtained by the amplitudes of the ultrasonic waves of the insonified frequency and its higher harmonics as transmitted through the interface. Additional phase measurements may enable one to obtain the evaluation of the full hysteretic cycle of the interaction force.

[...] In the sixteenth century it continues its association with Esau, appearing in <b>Bonde's</b> Pylgrimage of Perfection (1526) and in the English versions of two influential works by Erasmus, the Enchiridion (1533) and the Paraphrase upon the New Testament (1548): [...] "th'enherytaunce of the elder brother solde for a messe of potage". It can be found here and there throughout the sixteenth century, e.g. in Johan Carion's Thre bokes of cronicles (1550) and at least three times in Roger Edgeworth's collected sermons (1557). Within the tradition of English Biblical translations, it appears first in the summary at the beginning of chapter 25 of the Book of Genesis in the so-called Matthew Bible of 1537 (in this section otherwise a reprint of the Pentateuch translation of William Tyndale), [...] "Esau selleth his byrthright for a messe of potage"; thence in the 1539 Great Bible and in the Geneva Bible published by English Protestants in Geneva in 1560. According to the OED, Coverdale (1535) [...] "does not use the phrase, either in the text or the chapter heading..., but he has it in 1 Chronicles 16:3 and Proverbs 15:7." [...] Miles Smith used the same phrase in [...] "The Translators to the Reader," [...] the lengthy preface to the 1611 King James Bible, but by the seventeenth century the phrase had become very widespread indeed and had clearly achieved the status of a fixed phrase with allusive, quasi-proverbial, force.|$|R
