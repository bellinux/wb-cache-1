5|$|Edward VI acceded to the English throne in 1547, and the Protestant reformers there {{hoped to}} take the {{opportunity}} to more thoroughly reform the Church of England. Archbishop Thomas Cranmer invited Vermigli and Ochino to assist in the effort. In addition, the victory of Catholic Emperor Charles V in the Schmalkaldic War and the resulting Augsburg Interim led to a hostile environment for Protestants in Germany. Vermigli accepted the invitation in November and sailed with Ochino to England. In 1548, he replaced Richard Smyth, becoming the second Regius Professor of Divinity at Oxford. This was a very influential post at a university which had <b>been</b> <b>slow</b> <b>to</b> accept reform.|$|E
5|$|Locomotion {{abilities}} are best studied for Tyrannosaurus {{and there are}} two main issues concerning this: how well it could turn; and what its maximum straight-line speed was likely to have been.Tyrannosaurus may have <b>been</b> <b>slow</b> <b>to</b> turn, possibly taking one to two seconds to turn only 45°– an amount that humans, being vertically oriented and tail-less, can spin in a fraction of a second. The cause of the difficulty is rotational inertia, since much of Tyrannosaurus’ mass was some distance from its center of gravity, like a human carrying a heavy timber.|$|E
5|$|The {{fighting}} around Base 5 was {{the final}} action of the fighting in the northern sector of the island, which essentially ended in stalemate. The Australians, under pressure to limit casualties to their largely inexperienced troops, had pursued a cautious campaign and had <b>been</b> <b>slow</b> <b>to</b> regain the initiative in the area following the defeat at Porton Plantation. In contrast, the Japanese commander—Kato—had been skillful and aggressive. On 11 August, {{in anticipation of the}} capitulation of Japan following the dropping of two atomic bombs on Japanese cities, the order to cease offensive combat operations on Bougainville was passed to all Australian units by their commanders.|$|E
50|$|The Athenians {{managed to}} survive for several reasons. First, their foes were lacking in initiative. Corinth and Syracuse <b>were</b> <b>slow</b> <b>to</b> bring their fleets into the Aegean, and Sparta's other allies <b>were</b> also <b>slow</b> <b>to</b> furnish troops or ships. The Ionian states that rebelled {{expected}} protection, and many rejoined the Athenian side.

The cause of the difficulty is rotational inertia, since much of Tyrannosaurus mass was some distance from its center of gravity, like a human carrying a heavy timber horizontally — although it might have reduced the average distance by arching its back and tail and pulling its head and forelimbs close to its body, rather like the way ice skaters pull their arms closer in order to spin faster.|$|E
5|$|A heated altercation between Ramirez and {{teammate}} Kevin Youkilis {{took place}} on June 5, during a game at Fenway Park against the Tampa Bay Rays. The Boston Globe speculated that Youkilis was angry that Ramirez has <b>been</b> <b>slow</b> <b>to</b> join a bench-clearing brawl earlier in the game. The altercation may have also been caused by Ramirez objecting to what he believed was excessive complaining by Youkilis about the strike zone, {{as well as the}} first baseman's penchant for sometimes throwing his helmet in frustration after making an out. Before the fifth inning, Ramirez was caught on NESN cameras taking a swing at Youkilis. Ramirez and Youkilis yelled at each other and had to be separated by teammates, coaches, and training staff. Youkilis headed out to the field still yelling at Ramirez, while Ramirez was escorted into the tunnel leading to the clubhouse by bench coach Brad Mills and trainer Paul Lessard.|$|E

40|$|Autism Spectrum Disorder (ADS) is {{a severe}} {{developmental}} disability characterized by impairments in social interaction and communicative skills. Despite a growing research {{interest in the}} field, the causes of these impairments remain unknown. Two lines of research, Theory of Mind (ToM) and Central Coherence (CC), using experimental tasks such as visuo-spatial perspective Taking (VPT) and the local and global levels have suggested that visuo-spatial attention and spatial variables in the self-versus other recognition, may {{be the basis of}} the cognitive processes underlying social interaction. According to spatial attention, such as observed in the Unilateral spatial neglect (USN) may contribute to explain the differences in the spatial attention and the brain activation of autistic children in these two tasks. Participants with ASD in the CC experiment <b>were</b> <b>slower</b> <b>to</b> respond to the left hemifield in the global level. In the VPT experiment the participants with ASD <b>were</b> <b>slower</b> <b>to</b> respond to the left hemifield in the interaction first personal perspective (1 PP) and condition Common ground (CG), meanwhile <b>was</b> <b>slower</b> <b>to</b> response to the right hemifield in the interaction Third personal perspective (3 PP) and condition Common Ground (CG). However in the interaction Privileged ground (PG) and 1 PP the ASD group <b>was</b> <b>slower</b> <b>to</b> response to the right hemifield...|$|R
25|$|Verbal Behavior had an uncharacteristically cool reception, {{partly as}} a result of Chomsky's review, partly because of Skinner's failure to address or rebut any of Chomsky's criticisms. Skinner's peers may have <b>been</b> <b>slow</b> <b>to</b> adopt the ideas {{presented}} in Verbal Behavior because of the absence of experimental evidence—unlike the empirical density that marked Skinner's experimental work. However, in applied settings there has been a resurgence of interest in Skinner's functional analysis of verbal behavior.|$|E
25|$|Third is {{the case}} of Captain Tenodor Ten Eyck. Sent by Carrington to support or rescue Fetterman when the sounds of battle were heard at Fort Kearny, the captain was accused of having <b>been</b> <b>slow</b> <b>to</b> march to the aid of Fetterman, taking a longer route to reach him. Ten Eyck was accused of cowardice and drunkenness, and {{permitted}} to retire from the army. It is highly unlikely that Ten Eyck, even had he taken the shortest route, would have arrived in time to assist Fetterman.|$|E

After Israel's bill was passed, it was widely predicted that nearby countries such as Egypt, Lebanon and Saudi Arabia would not introduce similar bills as they have <b>been</b> <b>slow</b> <b>to</b> adopt legislation against sexual harassment in general. However, some commentators have suggested that victims could find recourse in existing laws against pornography, indecency, defamation and invasion of privacy.|$|E

25|$|Gustave Eiffel's {{career was}} {{facilitated}} by the Industrial Revolution. For a variety {{of economic and political}} reasons, this had <b>been</b> <b>slow</b> <b>to</b> make an impact in France, and Eiffel {{had the good fortune to}} be working at a time of rapid industrial development in France. Eiffel's importance as an engineer was twofold. Firstly he was ready to adopt innovative techniques first used by others, such as his use of compressed-air caissons and hollow cast-iron piers, and secondly he was a pioneer in his insistence on basing all engineering decisions on thorough calculation of the forces involved, combining this analytical approach with an insistence on a high standard of accuracy in drawing and manufacture.|$|E
25|$|It is {{probably}} impossible to completely eliminate dimensional change in wood, but elimination {{of change in}} size may be approximated by chemical modification. For example, wood can be treated with chemicals to replace the hydroxyl groups with other hydrophobic functional groups of modifying agents (Stamm, 1964). Among all the existing processes, wood modification with acetic anhydride has been noted for the high anti-shrink or anti-swell efficiency (ASE) attainable without damage to wood. However, acetylation of wood has <b>been</b> <b>slow</b> <b>to</b> be commercialised due to the cost, corrosion and the entrapment of the acetic acid in wood. There is an extensive volume of literature relating to the chemical modification of wood (Rowell, 1983, 1991; Kumar, 1994; Haque, 1997).|$|E
25|$|The craft-based AFL had <b>been</b> <b>slow</b> <b>to</b> {{organize}} industrial workers, and {{the federation}} remained steadfastly committed to craft unionism. This {{changed in the}} mid-1930s when, after passage of the National Labor Relations Act, workers began to clamor for union membership. In competition with the CIO movement, the AFL established Federal Labor Unions (FLUs), which were local industrial unions affiliated directly with the AFL, a concept initially envisioned in the 1886 AFL Constitution. FLUs were conceived as temporary unions, {{many of which were}} organized on an industrial basis. In keeping with the craft concept, FLUs were designed primarily for organizing purposes, with the membership destined to be distributed among the AFL's craft unions after the majority of workers in an industry were organized.|$|E

25|$|Although meeting stiff resistance, Hardee {{drove the}} Union troops back three miles (5km) to the {{railroad}} and the Nashville Pike by 10 a.m., where Johnson {{was able to}} rally them. Rosecrans canceled Crittenden's attack on the Confederate right, which had begun with Brig. Gen. Horatio P. Van Cleve's division crossing the river at 7 a.m., and instead rushed reinforcements to his own right flank. He had <b>been</b> <b>slow</b> <b>to</b> recognize the threat, assuming incorrectly that McCook {{would be capable of}} turning back Hardee's assault. As Rosecrans raced across the battlefield directing units, seeming ubiquitous to his men, his uniform was covered with blood from his friend and chief of staff, Col. Julius Garesché, beheaded by a cannonball while riding alongside.|$|E
25|$|Eisenhower {{had warned}} Eden {{not to do}} it, saying the American people would never approve of a {{military}} solution to the crisis. He threatened to use financial pressure unless the British withdrew from Egypt. Eden had ignored Britain's financial dependence on the US {{in the wake of}} World War II, and was forced to bow to American pressure to withdraw. Eden had poor staff support because the Foreign Office, Commonwealth Relations Office, and Colonial Office had <b>been</b> <b>slow</b> <b>to</b> realize the need for change in Britain's world role. After Suez they started to heed Treasury warnings about the effect of high defence expenditure on the economy, and the slow growth of the British population compared with the United States and the Soviet Union. Historians often use the crisis to mark the end of Britain's status as a superpower, being able to act and control international affairs without assistance or coalition.|$|E
25|$|Despite actions taken, {{the region}} has <b>been</b> <b>slow</b> <b>to</b> recover. During the moratorium, there was a {{decrease}} in employment {{in the oil industry}} along the Florida Coast and a net increase in employment in Louisiana, which also received more concern from the oil industry. Coastal areas were impacted economically more than inland areas. The Louisiana fishing industry was shown to still be damaged by the spill years after it had occurred. Oyster numbers in particular have dropped significantly in the region. Other at risk species used as sustenance include speckled trout, crabs, and mullet. Due to proximity to the spill site, Louisiana bore the brunt of clean up efforts. BP decided on the oil dissolving chemical Corexit which was shown by the United States Environmental Protection Agency to be neither the most or least toxic option. Criticisms of the use of the chemical included health impacts on humans, such as headaches, vomiting, and reproductive problems.|$|E
