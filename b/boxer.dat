5|$|Both {{the player}} and the {{opponent}} have stamina meters, both {{displayed on the}} top of the screen. The meters decrease when either <b>boxer</b> gets hit by a punch. Boxers will get knocked down if their stamina meter runs out. Faster knockdowns will cause that <b>boxer</b> to recover less stamina upon getting up; the same happens if a <b>boxer</b> is knocked down by a knockout punch. Either <b>boxer</b> will lose if they cannot stand up before the count of ten after being knocked down (resulting in a knockout or KO) or if they are knocked down three times in the match (resulting in a technical knockout or TKO). The player can also recover some stamina while the opponent is down by pressing the buttons on the controller.|$|E

50|$|Legendary Champions is a 1968 {{documentary}} film {{written and directed}} by Harry Chapin featuring old <b>boxers</b> in action. There are many scenes that show the <b>boxers</b> outside the ring, including some that are the only ones of their kind. Several early <b>boxers,</b> John L.

The narrator states that Jack Johnson is seen picking a defeated <b>boxer's</b> teeth out of one of his gloves. The attire worn by some of the early <b>boxers</b> is more revealing than what modern-day <b>boxers</b> use, and to the other extreme, tights were even worn by some <b>boxers.</b>|$|R

40|$|AIMS: To {{examine the}} effects of rapid weight loss on mood and {{performance}} among amateur <b>boxers.</b> METHODS: Participants were 16 experienced amateur <b>boxers.</b> In stage 1, structured interviews were used to assess the type of strategies that <b>boxers</b> used to reduce weight and the value of performing at their desired weight in terms of performance. In stage 2, <b>boxers</b> completed a 4 x 2 minute (1 minute recovery) circuit training session. <b>Boxers</b> completed the circuit training session on three different occasions with a week between each. The first test was used to familiarise the <b>boxers</b> with the circuit training task; the second and third tasks were at their training weight and championship weight, respectively. Participants were given one week to reduce their body weight to their championship weight using their preferred weight making strategies; <b>boxers</b> reduced their body weight by an average of 5. 16 % of body weight. RESULTS: <b>Boxers</b> typically lost weight by restricting fluid and food intake in the week leading to competition. Repeated measures multivariate analysis of variance results indicated that rapid weight loss among <b>boxers</b> was associated with poor performance, increased anger, fatigue, and tension, and reduced vigour. CONCLUSIONS: Strategies used to make weight by <b>boxers</b> are associated with poor performance and a negative mood profile...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the article}} is the {{improvement}} of the system of training the <b>boxers</b> of different weight categories.

Correspondingly, during training the heavy-weight <b>boxers</b> should {{pay more attention to the}} development of quantitative parameters that is the development of physical state, the development of the maximal fast power and endurance; and at the same time the technique-tactical indexes of the heavy-weight group are rather high and on the level of light class sportsmen...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} was to compare two neurophysiological variables in active amateur <b>boxers</b> with non-boxing sportsmen. 41 <b>boxers</b> and 27 controls were given psychometric tests: 34 <b>boxers</b> and 34 controls underwent technetium- 99 m hexamethylpropyleneamineoxime single photon emission computerised tomography (Tc- 99 m HMPAO SPECT) cerebral perfusion scans. The controls performed better at most aspects of the psychometric tests. <b>Boxers</b> who had fought fewer bouts {{had a tendency to}} perform better at psychometric tests than those <b>boxers</b> who had fought more bouts. Tc- 99 m HMPAO SPECT cerebral perfusion scanning showed that controls had less aberrations in cerebral perfusion than the <b>boxers.</b> In conclusion, significant differences were shown in two neurophysiological variables between young amateur sportsmen who box and those who do not.
