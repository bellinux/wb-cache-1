5|$|In June 2015, lenders {{warned that}} {{time was running out}} for a deal to be agreed on a new <b>bailout</b> plan. On 17 June, Tsakalotos warned that Greece {{would not be able to}} repay its €1.6bn loan from the IMF at the end of the month unless a new <b>bailout</b> plan was agreed. The {{deadline}} for the renewal of Greece's <b>bailout</b> package was also looming at the end of June. On 26 June, an emergency cabinet meeting led to the calling of a referendum on the <b>bailout</b> deal proposed by the creditors. Capital controls and a bank holiday were announced on 28 June, with the Eurozone refusing an extension of the <b>bailout</b> plan and Greece defaulting on its loan to the IMF on 30 June.|$|E
5|$|The 1982 {{amendment}} to the <b>bailout</b> eligibility standard went into effect on August 5, 1984. Between that date and 2013, 196 jurisdictions bailed out of coverage through 38 <b>bailout</b> actions; in each instance, the Attorney General consented to the <b>bailout</b> request. Between that date and 2009, all jurisdictions that bailed out were located in Virginia. In 2009, a municipal utility jurisdiction in Texas bailed out after the Supreme Court's opinion in Northwest Austin Municipal Utility District No. 1 v. Holder (2009), which held that local governments that do not register voters {{have the ability to}} bail out. After this ruling, jurisdictions succeeded in at least 20 <b>bailout</b> actions before the Supreme Court held in Shelby County v. Holder (2013) that the coverage formula was unconstitutional.|$|E
5|$|The package's {{acceptance}} was {{put into}} doubt on 31 October when Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou announced that a referendum would be held so that the Greek people would have the final say on the <b>bailout,</b> upsetting financial markets.

40|$|We analyze incentive-efficient {{government}} <b>bailouts</b> {{within a}} canonical model of intra-firm moral hazard. <b>Bailouts</b> exacerbate the moral hazard of firms and managers in two ways. First, they make them less averse to failing. Second, the taxes to fund <b>bailouts</b> dampen their incentives. Nevertheless, if third-party externalities from keeping the firm alive are strong, <b>bailouts</b> can improve welfare. Our model suggests that governments should use <b>bailouts</b> sparingly, where social externalities {{are large and}} subsidies small; (often) eliminate incumbent owners and managers to improve a priori incentives; and finance <b>bailouts</b> through redistributive taxes on productive firms instead of forcing recipients to repay in the future...|$|R
40|$|Since 2010, Ireland, Portugal and Greece {{have all}} {{received}} financial rescue packages, or <b>bailouts.</b> But who supports and opposes these <b>bailouts,</b> and why?

40|$|Although common {{economic}} wisdom {{suggests that}} government <b>bailouts</b> are inefficient because they reduce incentives to avoid failure and induce excessive entry by marginal firms, {{it is also}} clear that <b>bailouts</b> are difficult to avoid given systemically significant enterprises. Recent experience suggests that <b>bailouts</b> will also induce litigation from shareholders and managers, complaining about expropriation and wrongful termination by the government. Our model shows how governments can design tax-financed corporate <b>bailouts</b> to reduce these distortions, and points to the causes of inefficiencies in real-world implementations (e. g., TARP). Low-distortion <b>bailouts</b> depend critically on the government’s ability to expropriate shareholders and terminate managers...|$|R
5|$|Additionally, Congress {{required}} jurisdictions seeking <b>bailout</b> {{to produce}} evidence of minority registration and voting rates, including how these rates have changed over time and {{in comparison to the}} registration and voting rates of the majority. If the court determines that the covered jurisdiction is eligible for <b>bailout,</b> it will enter a declaratory judgment in the jurisdiction's favor. The court will retain jurisdiction for the following 10 years and may order the jurisdiction back into coverage if the jurisdiction subsequently engages in voting discrimination.|$|E
5|$|By November 1998, UBS's {{losses from}} its {{exposure}} to LTCM were estimated {{at the level}} of approximately CHF 790million. UBS would prove to be the largest single loser in the LTCM collapse, ultimately writing off CHF 950million. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York organized a <b>bailout</b> of US$3.625billion by the hedge fund's major creditors to avoid a wider collapse in the financial markets. UBS contributed US$300million to the <b>bailout</b> effort, which would largely be recovered. In the aftermath of the LTCM collapse, Mathis Cabiallavetta resigned as chairman of UBS, along with three other executives.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is comprised}} of three papers exploring {{the causes of the}} likelihood and distribution of corporate <b>bailouts.</b> The first paper explores why some distressed firms receive <b>bailouts</b> while others do not. It argues that political partisanship plays a key role: left-wing governments are more likely to authorize <b>bailouts</b> on average, and are particularly more likely to save employee-rich firms. The theory is tested using a new dataset comprised of financially distressed firms, a subset of which receive <b>bailouts.</b> The second paper examines why <b>bailouts</b> are concentrated in a particular subset of industrial sectors. The primary argument is again political partisanship: left-wing governments seek to protect firms in sectors that have the most employees. Alternative explanations, including the impact of globalization and alternative forms of social protection, are also considered. The theory is shown to hold using a new dataset comprised of comprehensive counts of <b>bailouts</b> by sector across the European Economic Area. The final paper examines the nature of public opinion regarding <b>bailouts.</b> The paper undermines the standing assumption that <b>bailouts</b> are largely unpopular by instead showing that public support varies by context and is in some instances supportive. Using observational data in conjunction with survey experiments, individual characteristics, including partisanship and material self-interest, as well as firm-specific characteristics, including the relevance of the firm to the national economy, are shown to drive public support for <b>bailouts...</b>|$|R

An {{equation}} is estimated in which central government grants to regions depend on the regions' issue of debt. The data is for the period 1986 - 2006.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a non-linear DSGE model {{to assess the}} interaction between ex-post interventions in credit markets and the build-up of risk ex ante. During a systemic crisis, <b>bailouts</b> relax balance sheet constraints and mitigate {{the severity of the}} recession. Ex ante, the anticipation of such <b>bailouts</b> leads to an increase in risk-taking, making the economy more vulnerable to a financial crisis. The optimal policy requires, in general, a mix of ex-post intervention and ex-ante prudential policy. We also analyze the effects of <b>bailouts</b> on financial stability and welfare in the absence of ex-ante prudential policy. Our results show that the moral hazard effects of <b>bailouts</b> are significantly mitigated by making <b>bailouts</b> contingent on the occurrence of a systemic financial crisis...|$|R
5|$|Faced by {{the threat}} of a {{sovereign}} default and potential resulting exit of the eurozone, some final attempts were made by the Greek government in May 2015 to settle an agreement with the Troika about some adjusted terms for Greece to comply with in order to activate the transfer of the frozen <b>bailout</b> funds in its current programme. The Eurogroup recently granted a six-month technical extension of its current <b>bailout</b> programme to Greece (now set to expire by the end of June 2015), which means the time window to complete negotiations and subsequently implement the conditional measures to unlock the remaining <b>bailout</b> transfers now is very short. Expectations are that Greece in addition will need a follow-up support programme starting 1 July 2015. The Troika announced the condition for offering Greece (and begin negotiations about) establishment of a follow-up programme would be a prior successful completion of the re-negotiated current programme.|$|E

40|$|We present four {{case studies}} of <b>bailouts</b> of {{subnational}} governments in Australia, Germany, Italy and Sweden. The case studies show that <b>bailouts</b> can occur in a diverse set of institutions shaping the relations between central and subnational governments. Surpisingly, {{there is little evidence}} in favor of the `too big to fail` argument explaining <b>bailouts.</b> In contrast, elements of political favoritism play some role in most cases. The cases also indicate the importance of properly designing principal-agent relationships in the decentralization of public finances. Constitutional mandates for uniform provision of public services and attempts by the central government to dominate subnational governments in matters of fiscal policy seem to be conducive to <b>bailouts.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Chairman McHenry, Ranking Member Green {{and other}} members of the Subcommittee, thank you for the {{opportunity}} to testify at this hearing on “Who Is Too Big to Fail: Does Title II of the Dodd Frank Act Enshrine Taxpayer-Funded <b>Bailouts?</b> ” My testimony endeavors to address the questions raised in the invitation letter about the continuing likelihood of <b>bailouts</b> and incentive effects under Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act. Concerns about <b>Bailouts</b> with Title II Large financial firms still seem to be enjoying a huge subsidy on their borrowing costs due to market expectations of <b>bailouts.</b> For example, according to a widely-cited Bloomberg calculation, based on an International Monetary Fund study, the subsidy mounts to $ 83 billion per year.

The party leaders reiterated their stances regarding the EU-sponsored Portuguese bailout; Katainen and Kiviniemi were in favour of it, insisting that the <b>bailout</b> is {{necessary in order to}} assure the stability of the European economy and thus in the interest of Finland. Urpilainen and Soini were against the <b>bailout,</b> with Urpilainen demanding more responsibility from banks and investors and Soini repeating his stance that the eurozone cannot possibly function properly with countries like Portugal and Greece as members. Soini also criticised the governing parties for using scare tactics in the form of threatening Finns with rising unemployment if the <b>bailout</b> fails to pass. On other issues, Katainen, as he had stated earlier, willing to consider raising the minimum retirement age, while Urpilainen announced that the SDP would not join any coalition that does so. Katainen was the only party leader in favour of Finland's admission to NATO. However, even he said that the admission does not seem possible during the next four years as the majority of Finns are against NATO membership.|$|E
