500|$|Marceline and her father, Hunson Abadeer, {{have trouble}} {{accepting}} one another. Initially, Marceline feels {{that her father}} does not care for her, and expresses her feelings through the before-mentioned [...] "Fry Song". Although they admit to loving each other, Abadeer constantly pressures Marceline {{to follow in the}} family business and take over ruling the Nightosphere, a prospective job Marceline does not want. Marceline and the Ice King also have a complicated relationship. In the episode [...] "I Remember You", it is revealed that the Ice King—then, the human man named Simon Petrikov—discovered her crying in the ruins of a city destroyed by the Mushroom Wars. It was Simon who gave little Marceline Hambo and attempted to watch over her. This kind gesture made the Ice King a long-time close friend and father figure to Marceline. However, as the crown's power increased, Simon began to forget more and more about his relationship with Marceline, until he had all but forgotten their friendship. Former storyboard artist and current supervising director for the series Adam Muto explained that Marceline and the Ice King's history {{was not part of the}} series' initial plan, <b>but</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> [...] "evolved from [...] original course and it will likely continue to evolve in the future." ...|$|E
500|$|The first {{image the}} Coens and Raimi {{conceived}} was of Norville Barnes about {{to jump from}} the window of a skyscraper and then they had to figure out how he got there and how to save him. The inclusion of the hula hoop came {{as a result of a}} plot device. Joel remembers, [...] "We had to come up with something that Norville was going to invent that on the face of it was ridiculous. Something that would seem, by any sort of rational measure, to be doomed to failure, <b>but</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> on the other hand the audience already knew was going to be a phenomenal success." [...] Ethan said, [...] "The whole circle motif was built into the design of the movie, and that just made it seem more appropriate." [...] Joel: [...] "What grew out of that was the design element which drives the movie. The tension between vertical lines and circles; you have these tall buildings, then these circles everywhere which are echoed in the plot...in the structure of the movie itself. It starts with the end and circles back to the beginning, with a big flashback." [...] It took the Coens and Raimi three months to write the screenplay. As early as 1985, the Coens were quoted as saying that an upcoming project [...] "takes place in the late Fifties in a skyscraper and is about Big Business. The characters talk fast and wear sharp clothes." ...|$|E
500|$|After various failed relationships, Lex finally {{believes}} he has what he wants when he begins a romantic relationship with Lana Lang. In [...] "Hypnotic", {{in an effort to}} stop hurting Lana emotionally, Clark told her that he no longer loved her. This drives Lana into Lex's arms. Writer Darren Swimmer explains that this was not something that just happened in the series, <b>but</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> had been hinted at for many seasons. Rosenbaum admits that Lex had a crush on Lana for many years, but contends that he tried to help Clark win Lana early on—he succeeded. When Clark and Lana's relationship crumbled, because of Clark's deceit, Lex was waiting. Rosenbaum believes that Lana was [...] "tired of the boy and wanted a man around". By contrast, Swimmer believes that Lana started dating Lex as a way of making Clark mad, but the relationship [...] "turned into much more". Kreuk contends that Lana went to Lex because [...] "she knows she will never really love him." [...] Kreuk believes that Lana's relationship with the men in her life was originally motivated by a desire to fill a void in her life that was left after her parents were killed. This need to fill that emptiness was fulfilled in [...] "Void", when Lana took a drug to induce death so that she could see her parents in the afterlife. Upon meeting her parents, Kreuk believes that Lana realized that she no longer needed someone else to fill that hole in her. Kreuk sees this filled void as the reason why Lana would gravitate toward Lex. Kreuk feels that if Lex had chosen a different path after the events of [...] "Lexmas", then Lana {{would have been able to}} truly love him.|$|E

500|$|The {{beginning}} of season five saw, for the first time, Clark and Lana in a happy relationship together, one that was void of dishonesty and secrets. The return of Clark's powers in [...] "Hidden", {{as well as the}} secrets and lies that accompany them, caused stress on their relationship. In the series' 100th episode, Clark finally took a chance and told Lana the truth. When it resulted, indirectly, in her death and he was allowed to live the day over again Clark chose not to tell her his secret. In [...] "Hypnotic", in an effort to stop hurting Lana emotionally, Clark told her that he no longer loved her. This drove Lana into Lex's arms. Writer Darren Swimmer explains that this was not something that just happened in the series, <b>but</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> had been hinted at for many seasons.

2500|$|Shiite {{religious}} texts, {{such as the}} hadith {{transmitted by}} Imam Al-Sadiq, states, [...] "circumcision is makrumah for women". Makrumah is usually translated as [...] "meritorious action or noble deed, <b>but</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> is not religiously obligatory".|$|E
2500|$|The One is {{not just}} an {{intellectual}} concept <b>but</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> can be experienced, an experience where one goes beyond all multiplicity.

2500|$|An {{interesting}} variant on {{the concept}} of subtle bodies is found in both Alchemical Taoism and the [...] "Fourth Way" [...] teachings of Gurdjieff and Ouspensky, where it is said that one can create a subtle body, and hence achieve post-mortem immortality, through spiritual or yogic exercises. The [...] "soul" [...] then is not something one is born with, <b>but</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> one has to develop through esoteric practice.|$|E
2500|$|At the Synod of Bishops held in Rome in 1971, {{to which}} he was {{personally}} invited by the pope, Luciani suggested to the bishops assembled that dioceses in countries that were heavily industrialised should relinquish around 1% of all their income to Third World nations to be given [...] "not as alms, <b>but</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> is owed. Owed to compensate for the injustices that our consumer-oriented world is committing towards the 'world on the way to development' and to in some way make reparation for social sin, of which we must become aware".|$|E
2500|$|One of {{her works}} in Sister Outsider is [...] "The Master's Tools Will Never Dismantle the Master's House." [...] Lorde {{questions}} {{the scope and}} ability for change to be instigated when examining problems through a racist, patriarchal lens. [...] She insists that women see differences between other women not as something to be tolerated, <b>but</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> is necessary to generate power and to actively [...] "be" [...] in the world. [...] This will create a community that embraces differences, which will ultimately lead to liberation. [...] Lorde elucidates, [...] "Divide and conquer, in our world, must become define and empower." [...] Also, one must educate themselves about the oppression of others because expecting a marginalized group to educate the oppressors is the continuation of racist, patriarchal thought. She explains {{that this is a}} major tool utilized by oppressors to keep the oppressed occupied with the master's concerns. [...] She concludes that in order to bring about real change, we cannot work within the racist, patriarchal framework because change brought about in that will not remain.|$|E

2500|$|Jackson {{developed}} body dysmorphia as {{a response}} to ridicule, stating, [...] "I'd {{look in the mirror and}} hate myself. I'd sit and cry. It was so hard for me to look at myself and find something that I liked. Not just physically, <b>but</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> was good in me". She also inflicted self-harm, banging her head against the wall when feeling unattractive. She traced her fragility to her abusive marriage to recording artist James DeBarge when she was 16 years old. Jackson recalled, [...] "It all has to do with very low self esteem. Especially going into a relationship like that very young... someone telling you things like, 'no one is ever going to want you again, you should be happy here with me.'" [...] Attempting to alter his behavior and drug addiction, she explained, [...] "I learned the hard way that you can't change a person." [...] Recalling her divorce, she revealed, [...] "There came a point when I finally said, 'You know what? I just don't care what happens.' I had to do what I wanted to but had been too afraid to. And at that point I didn't care if I got my brains beat out. I just went ahead and did it. And I got my ass kicked for it. But I'm happy that I did it, or I don't think I would be here today".|$|E
