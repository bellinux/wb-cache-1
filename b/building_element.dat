HOK Sport's {{project manager for}} the project, Melinda Lehman, said that the Rooney family asked for the stadium's design to [...] "acknowledge the history of Pittsburgh and also bring in an element of looking forward, this is where Pittsburgh is going." [...] In order to accomplish this, HOK Sport used steel structurally and externally. The stone used in Heinz Field's design is artificial, in order to decrease cost. Of the glass used in the stadium's design, Lehman said, [...] "The glass is a more modern <b>building</b> <b>element,</b> which ties {{into a lot of}} the buildings in [...] Pittsburgh and gives great views of the surrounding areas." [...] The Steelers and Panthers have their own locker rooms, which differ in size based on the amount of players each team is permitted to dress for each game. The visitor facilities are modeled after the home locker rooms' design. As with its predecessor, Heinz Field's culinary service provider is Aramark; over 400eateries are located throughout the stadium. A bronze statue of Steelers founder Art Rooney, similar to those located outside PNC Park, was moved [...] from its previous position outside Three Rivers Stadium. In addition, a statue of a Pitt Panther over a paved depiction of Pitt's Cathedral of Learning was placed outside Gate A. Upon opening in 2001, Heinz Field's 27by96foot Sony JumboTron was the largest scoreboard in the NFL. In 2007, ESPN named the [...] "tipping" [...] of the oversized Heinz ketchup bottles atop the scoreboard one of the top ten touchdown celebrations in the NFL.|$|E
2500|$|But {{beyond these}} public {{buildings}} {{designed in the}} Nordic Classicism style, this same style was also used in timber constructed workers' housing, most famously in the Puu-Käpylä ("Wooden Käpylä") district of Helsinki (1920–25) by Martti Välikangas. The around 165 houses of Puu-Käpylä, modelled on farmhouses, were built from traditional square log construction clad in vertical boarding, but the construction technique was rationalised with an on-site [...] "factory" [...] with a partly <b>building</b> <b>element</b> technique. The principle of standardization for housing generally would take off during this time. In 1922 the National Board of Social Welfare (Sosiaalihalitus) commissioned architect Elias Paalanen to design different options of farmhouses, which were then published as a brochure, Pienasuntojen tyyppipiirustuksia (Standard drawings for small houses) republished several times. In 1934 Paalanen was commissioned to design an equivalent urban type-house, and {{he came up with}} twelve different options. Alvar Aalto, too, became involved, from 1936, in standard small houses, designing for the Ahlström timber and wood product company, with three types of the so-called AA system: 40 m² (Type A), 50 m² (Type B) and 60 m² (Type C). Though based on traditional farmhouses, there are also clear stylistic elements from Nordic Classicism but also modernism. However, it was with the repercussions of the Second World War that the standard system for house design took on even greater potency, {{with the advent of the}} so-called Rintamamiestalo house (literally: War-front soldier's house). These were built throughout the country; a particularly well-preserved example is the district of Karjasilta in Oulu. But this same house type also took on a different role in the aftermath of World War Two as part of the Finnish war reparations to the Soviet Union; among the [...] "goods" [...] delivered from Finland to the Soviet Union were over 500 wooden houses based on the standard Rintamamiestalo house, deliveries taking place between 1944 and 1948. A number of these houses ended up being exported from the Soviet Union to various places in Poland, where small [...] "Finnish villages" [...] were established; for example, the district of Szombierki in Bytom, as well as in Katowice and Sosnowiec.|$|E

30|$|A {{point cloud}} {{includes}} {{a set of}} 3 D points with known coordinates. The coordinates indicate {{the positions of the}} points in the building environments without any semantic or high-level geometric as-built building information. In order to retrieve this information, <b>building</b> <b>elements</b> in the environments need to be recognized from the point cloud. This way, the geometries and dimensions of the elements can be estimated and modeled correspondingly. However, the direct recognition of the <b>building</b> <b>elements</b> from the point cloud has proven difficult, especially when the detailed prior information is not available (Bosche and Haas 2008). Therefore, the visual features of <b>building</b> <b>elements</b> has been exploited here. Under the workflow of <b>building</b> <b>elements</b> recognition, the elements are first recognized in the color images based on their unique visual patterns. The patterns include the topological configurations of the elements’ contour and texture features. For example, concrete columns in buildings are dominated by long near-vertical lines (contour features) at sides and concrete surfaces (texture feature) in the middle, no matter they are rectangular or circular. Therefore, they can be located by searching such cues in the color images. When <b>building</b> <b>elements</b> are recognized from the color images, the recognition results could be used to classify the 3 D points, so that the points belonging to the same <b>building</b> <b>elements</b> could be grouped and modeled separately.|$|R

50|$|The U-factor or U-value, is {{the overall}} heat {{transfer}} coefficient that describes how well a <b>building</b> <b>element</b> conducts heat or the rate of transfer of heat (in watts) through one square metre of a structure divided by the difference in temperature across the structure. The elements are commonly assemblies of many layers of components such as those that make up walls/floors/roofs etc. It measures the rate of heat transfer through a <b>building</b> <b>element</b> over a given area under standardised conditions. The usual standard is at a temperature gradient of 24 °C (75.2 °F), at 50% humidity with no wind (a smaller U-factor is better at reducing heat transfer). It is expressed in watts per meter squared kelvin (W/m²K). This means that the higher the U-value the worse the thermal performance of the building envelope. A low U-value usually indicates high levels of insulation. They are useful as {{it is a way of}} predicting the composite behavior of an entire <b>building</b> <b>element</b> rather than relying on the properties of individual materials.|$|E
