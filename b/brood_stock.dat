40|$|Purpose. Study of {{the genetic}} {{structure}} specificity, intra- and interpopulation genetic variation of the <b>brood</b> <b>stocks</b> of Ukrainian scaled carp from different fish farms of Ukraine using DNA markers (ISSR-PCR). Methodology. A PCR (ISSR-PCR) method with appropriately selected primers {{has been used to}} investigate the genetic structure specificity. Findings. The genetic structure analysis of Ukrainian scaled carp has been carried out using three microsatellite DNA loci: (AGC) 6 G, (AСC) 6 G, (AGC) 6 С. In total, 55 amplicons were detected for all primers. Fifteen primers were detected when using (AGC) 6 G primer, 17 for (AСC) 6 G primer and 23 for (AGC) 6 С primer. The molecular weight on electropherograms had maximum values when using (AСC) 6 G primer (500 n. p. – 3500 n. p.) in Nyvky carp. The detected specific differences between the examined populations of scaled carp depend on their genetic origin. Variations of the detected amplicons are sufficient for separating individual fish or, if works are carried out with a group of broodfish, for selecting parental pairs for increasing genetic diversity. Originality. The use of ISSR-markers allowed detecting the peculiarities {{of the genetic}} structure, level of genetic variability of the <b>brood</b> <b>stocks</b> of Ukrainian scaled carp. For the first time, we obtained new data on the specificity of the genetic structure when using PCR techniques, which allow detecting specific mechanisms of the maintenance of the relative stability of the genetic material of Ukrainian scaled carps and allow controlling and preserving the specificity of their genetic structure.
