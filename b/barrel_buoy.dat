At one end of this line was a small <b>barrel</b> <b>buoy,</b> at the other the two {{fishermen}} in their boat. Buoy and boat at once began to draw together, and the fishermen to cry out, as they were jerked after us. A couple of minutes later we hooked a second net, and then a third, and in this fashion we tore straight up through the centre of the fleet.|$|E

25|$|The native blackfoot pāua, Haliotis iris, {{is a form}} of abalone. They {{are large}} sea snails which survive strong tidal surges by {{clinging}} to rocks using their large muscular foot. Wild pāua has been harvested since 1944, usually by skindivers,. Pāua aquaculture started in 1980, but has been slow moving beyond development. They are difficult to grow, and grow more slowly than salmon, mussels or oysters. Their larva and juveniles need to be grown separately. Most pāua farmers get juveniles from hatcheries, and feed them fresh kelp in land-based tanks. In Akaroa Harbour, one farmer grows pāua on plastic <b>barrels</b> tethered to <b>buoys.</b> In 2002, farmers produced five tonnes of pāua meat, worth $400,000.|$|R
