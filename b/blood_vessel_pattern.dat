40|$|A robust {{method of}} human {{authentication}} {{based on the}} retinal <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> <b>pattern</b> is presented in this paper. This method entails a segmentation process to identify retinal <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> <b>pattern,</b> template generation consisting of the bifurcation points in the retina and matching of the intersection points in the template patterns. The number of matched blood vessel intersection points between the two patterns compared {{is used as a}} measure of similarity. As Liveness detection is a highly desirable anti-spoofing measure in biometric authentication, it is ensured while acquiring retinal images in realtime. The validity of our approach is verified with experimental results obtained from 603 comparisons made using 303 retinal images from three different publicly available databases, namely DRIVE, VARIA and STARE. We found that the proposed retinal recognition method gives 100 %, 96. 3 % and 91. 1 % recognition rates respectively for the above databases. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that uses a large number of retinal images from different retinal databases for the authentication purpose...|$|E

30|$|Farzin et al. [7] {{proposed}} a novel method {{based on the}} features obtained from retinal images.

Blood vessel segmentation module had the role of extracting <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> <b>pattern</b> from retinal images. Feature generation module included optic disc detection and selecting circular region around the optic disc of the segmented image. Then, using a polar transformation, a rotation invariant template was created. Next, these templates were analyzed in three different scales using wavelet transform to separate vessels according to their diameter sizes. In the last stage, vessel position and orientation in each scale were used to define a feature vector for each subject in the database. For feature matching, they introduced a modified correlation measure to obtain a similarity index for each scale of the feature vector. Then, they computed {{the total value of}} the similarity index by summing scale-weighted similarity indices. The computational time of this method for segmentation, feature extraction, and matching is high, and this method was used only in identification mode.|$|E

In this study, we examined the role of T 1 α/podoplanin in vascular development and the effects of gene disruption in mice. T 1 α/podoplanin is first expressed at around E 11. 0 in Prox 1 -positive lymphatic progenitor cells, with predominant localization in the luminal plasma membrane of lymphatic endothelial cells during later development. T 1 α/podoplanin–/– mice die at birth due to respiratory failure and have defects in lymphatic, but not <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> <b>pattern</b> formation. These defects are associated with diminished lymphatic transport, congenital lymphedema and dilation of lymphatic vessels. T 1 α/podoplanin is also expressed in the basal epidermis of newborn wild-type mice, but gene disruption did not alter epidermal differentiation. Studies in cultured endothelial cells indicate that T 1 α/podoplanin promotes cell adhesion, migration and tube formation, whereas small interfering RNA-mediated inhibition of T 1 α/podoplanin expression decreased lymphatic endothelial cell adhesion.

Computer security can be segmented into six categories: physical, hardware, software, personnel, communications and procedures. Embedded into software security are those features which protect the system against both unauthorized access and denial of service to authorized users. Another term for this is access control. Access control mechanisms verify an individual's identity via three distinct methods: 1) something an individual knows, 2) something an individual possesses or 3) something about the individual.

Investigation of structural organization principles or quantification of dendritic and axonal innervation thus requires integration of many reconstructed morphologies into a common reference frame. Here we present a standardized 3 D model of the rat vibrissal cortex and introduce an automated registration tool that allows for precise placement of single neuron reconstructions. We (1) developed an automated image processing pipeline to reconstruct 3 D anatomical landmarks, i. e., the barrels in Layer 4, the pia and white matter surfaces and the <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> <b>pattern</b> from high-resolution images, (2) quantified these landmarks in 12 different rats, (3) generated an average 3 D model of the vibrissal cortex and (4) used rigid transformations and stepwise linear scaling to register 94 neuron morphologies, reconstructed from in vivo stainings, to the standardized cortex model. We find that anatomical landmarks vary substantially across the vibrissal cortex within an individual rat. In contrast, the 3 D layout of the entire vibrissal cortex remains remarkably preserved across animals. This allows for precise registration of individual neuron reconstructions with approximately 30 µm accuracy.

30|$|Nowadays, reliable, fast, and {{accurate}} {{recognition of a}} person is an important need for security systems, and recent advances in technology and increasing the need for security {{require the use of}} reliable biometric systems [1]. The biometric attributes used in security system for recognition include finger print, hand geometry, face, iris, and retina [2 – 8]. Each biometric feature has its strengths and weaknesses, and the choice depends on the application. Among these methods, the retina provides a higher level of security for recognition due to uniqueness and the stability of the <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> <b>pattern</b> during one's life. However, because of technological limitation in manufacturing specific imaging apparatus, its usage is limited to places where high security level is needed. Depending on the application context, a biometric system may operate in verification or identification mode. In the verification mode, the system confirms or denies a person's claimed identity by comparing the captured biometric features with the own biometric template(s) stored in the database. In the identification mode, the system recognizes an individual by searching the templates of all users in the database for a match [9]. Therefore, for identification at first step, the security system must decide about the existence of a person. After confirming the existence, the security system must determine the identity of that person. Most recognition methods based on the retinal images are used only in identification or verification mode.|$|E

30|$|Infrared (IR) or thermal {{images are}} {{considered}} {{a viable alternative to}} manage changes in illumination level and in detecting disguised faces [10 – 12]. Thermal or IR cameras capture images based on the heat patterns emitted from an object. Heat patterns emitted by an object depend on the body temperature and characteristics of the constituent material of the object. Since the <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> <b>pattern,</b> muscle, tissue etc. are different for each person, the radiated pattern of heat should be unique for each and every individual. The use of thermal face images has great advantages over visual images. Face recognition systems based on visual images results very poor under different illumination conditions, colours, disguises, and typical conditions like identical twins. However, these situations can be handled by IR images very easily but it has many drawbacks. Firstly, IR imagery depends on the temperature, {{and if there is a}} large difference in body temperature then the heat patterns generated by human body would certainly differ. Heat pattern produced by a person sitting in an air-conditioned room and the same person when sitting under strong sunlight must be different. As a matter of fact, IR images should be captured in a controlled environment i.e. with minimum variation in external temperature. Second, IR images are also sensitive to variations in the internal temperature of the face. Factors that could contribute to these variations include diseases (e.g. cold, fever etc.), facial expressions (e.g. open mouth, closed eyes), physical conditions (e.g. lack of sleeps), and psychological conditions (e.g. fear, stress, excitement). Finally, IR is opaque to spectacles and coloured glasses. This may introduce partial occlusion to the face images.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{recognition}} {{accuracy of}} a single biometric authentication system is often much reduced due to the environment, user mode and physiological defects. So a multimodal biometric approach for identity verification using two competent traits, iris and retina is proposed. This multimodal approach diminishes the drawback of single biometric system and improves the performance of an authentication system. Iris and Retina biometric recognition offers a highly reliable solution to person authentication. Iris recognition system is composed of segmentation, normalization, feature encoding and matching. Instead of using the entire iris code, only the bits that are consistent in the iris code called the Best bits are considered in the feature matching process. This reduces the computational time and storage requirements of iris code. To enhance the performance of recognition, the iris recognition process is applied to left and right irises separately and the corresponding distance scores are generated for each iris of a person. These scores are combined using the weighted sum fusion rule which further increases the recognition rate. In order to provide liveness verification for our authentication system, we also employed retinal <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> <b>pattern</b> recognition. This ensures the presence of only alive persons eliminating the possible spoofing attack. It is composed of segmentation, enhancement, feature encoding and matching. The scores from iris and retina recognition are then combined using weighted sum fusion rule, which further increases the recognition rate. To validate our approach, experiments were conducted on the iris and retina images obtained from CASIA and VARIA datasets respectively. A multimodal biometric database was constructed and then 1500 inter, intra image comparisons were made using the two datasets. The experimental results reveal that our multimodal biometric authentication system is much more reliable and precise than the single biometric approaches...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to test the {{hypothesis}} that com-ponents in mainstream (MS) and sidestream (SS) cigarette smoke inhibit growth and angiogenesis using the chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM). Varying doses of whole or gas-phase MS and SS smoke solutions were placed on day 5 CAMs, and their effects on angiogenesis were evaluated on day 6. All parameters evaluated (CAM area, major blood vessel area, major blood vessel diameter, <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> <b>pattern</b> formation, and capillary plexus formation) were inhibited to different degrees in a dose-dependent manner by both MS and SS smoke treatment. Inhibition of growth and vessel development was correlated with inhibition of cell proliferation. Inhibition of capillary plexus formation was caused by failure of mesodermal blood vessels to migrate to the ectoderm. SS smoke solution was more inhibitory than MS smoke solution in all assays, except for capillary plexus formation. In all assays, the toxicants in SS smoke partitioned mainly with the gas phase, whereas those in MS smoke were deduced to be mainly in the particulate phase in the proliferation-dependent assays (CAM area, blood vessel area, blood vessel diameter) and in both the gas and particulate phase in the pattern formation and plexus formation assays. Some of the inhibitory doses of MS and SS smoke solutions had nicotine concentrations within the range found in human smokers. Taken together, these data demonstrate that exposure to complex mix-tures of chemicals in MS and SS cigarette smoke adversely affect growth, vessel development, vessel migration, and cell prolifera-tion.

Furthermore, neural tube electroporation at E 2 with a construct for the soluble form of neuropilin- 1 caused vascular malformations and hemorrhage as well as altered nerve trajectories and peripheral nerve defasciculation at E 5 –E 6. These results suggest that neurovascular congruency does not arise from interdependence between peripheral nerves and <b>blood</b> <b>vessels,</b> but supports the hypothesis that it arises by a shared patterning mechanism that utilizes semaphorin 3 A...|$|R
40|$|The study {{reported}} {{in the first part}} of this thesis utilized optical imaging of intrinsic signals to visualize changes in orientation maps in cat visual cortex induced by pairing a visual stimulus with an intracortical electrical stimulation. We found that the direction of plasticity within orientation maps depends critically on the relative timing between visual and electrical stimulation on a millisecond time scale: a shift in orientation preference towards the paired orientation was observed if the cortex was first visually and then electrically stimulated. In contrast, the cortical response to the paired orientation was diminished if the electrical preceded the visual cortical stimulation. Spike-time-dependent plasticity has been observed in single cell studies; however, our results demonstrate an analogous effect at the systems level in the live animal. Thus, timing-dependent plasticity needs to be incorporated into our conception of cortical map development. While the pairing paradigm induced pronounced shifts in orientation preference, the general setup of the orientation preference map remained unaltered. In order to unravel potential factors contributing to this overall stability, we determined the distribution of plasticity across the cortical surface. We found that pinwheel centers, points were domains of all orientation meet, exhibited less plasticity than other regions of the orientation map. The resistance of pinwheel centers to changes in orientation preference may support maintenance of the general structure of the orientation map. The study that forms the second part employs optical imaging to visualize the retinotopy in mouse visual cortex. We were able to resolve the pattern of retinotopic activity with high precision and reliability in the primary visual cortex (area 17). Functional imaging of the position, size and shape of area 17 corresponded exactly to the location of this area in stained histological sections. The imaged maps were also confirmed with electrophysiological recordings. The retinotopic structure of area 17 showed very low inter-animal variability, thus allowing averaging maps across animals and therefore statistical analysis. These averaged maps greatly facilitated the identification of at least four extrastriate visual areas. In addition, we detected decreases in the intrinsic signal below baseline with a shape and location reminiscent of lateral inhibition. This decrease of the intrinsic signal was shown to be correlated with a decrease in neuronal firing rate below baseline. Both studies were facilitated by the development of a signal analysis technique (part III), which improves the quality of optical imaging data. Intrinsic signal fluctuations originating from blood vessels were minimized based on their correlation with the actual superficial <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> <b>pattern.</b> These fluctuation components were then extracted from images obtained during sensory stimulation. This method increases the reproducibility of functional maps from cat, rat, and mouse visual cortex significantly and might also be applied to high resolution imaging using voltage sensitve dyes or functional magnetic resonance...|$|E
40|$|The neocortex, {{especially}} that of humans, {{is considered to}} be the most complex structure in the known universe. Functionally, it is involved in higher order brain functions such as sensory processing, generation of motor commands, and cognitive processes. Structurally, it encloses the cerebral hemispheres as a one to four millimeter thick sheet and consists of a highly complex network of interconnected cells. Even though a wealth of anatomical and physiological data has been collected over the past decades, the functional organization of the neocortical microcircuitry is still a mystery. What is known for sure, however, is that information is represented and processed in the neocortex as membrane potential fluctuations travelling through the neuronal network. We refer to such fluctuations as neuronal activity. Due to its tissue penetration capabilities of up to one millimeter combined with threedimensional spatial resolution, two-photon laser-scanning microscopy (2 PM) has become the method of choice to image populations of neurons inside the neocortex of living animals. In combination with techniques that allow to load populations of several hundred cells with fluorescent indicators of neural activity (in particular: calcium indicators), it is possible to observe neuronal population activity inside the brain in vivo. Researchers performing in vivo 2 PM often use custom-built microscopy setups controlled by custom-written software due to the high flexibility they require. The continuous technical advancement of the field created a need for new control software that is flexible enough to supply both the biological researcher with the newest image acquisition techniques and the developer with a solid platform from which various new extensions can be implemented and ideas quickly realised. In {{the first part of this}} thesis, I introduce HelioScan, a software package written in LabVIEW. It serves i) as a component collection allowing to flexibly assemble a microscopy control software according to the own needs, and ii) as a framework within which new functionality can be implemented in a quick and structured manner. A specific HelioScan application assembles at run-time from individual software components and subcomponents, based on user-definable configuration files. This concept allows high flexibility with regard to different hardware or functional requirements. Currently implemented components enable i) camera-based imaging such as intrinsic optical signal (IOS) imaging, as well as different laser-scanning modes employing ii) galvanometric mirrors, iii) acousto-optic deflectors (AODs) or iv) resonant scanners. Components are implemented in an object-oriented fashion, with generic interface classes defining the component types as well as their possible interactions. New components can be implemented by inheriting from existing base classes. Various scaffold classes derived from the generic component classes allow to extend quickly on already existing functionality. Due to its component-based architecture, HelioScan fosters collaborative efforts in which several developers can work in parallel when implementing new functionality. The cellular components of the neocortical neural network are diverse with respect to their precise morphology, physiology and molecular composition. Their diversity does not form a continuum, however. As a consequence, they can be grouped into different classes based on common or at least similar features. Different functional roles can be attributed to these classes (cell types). It is thus important to be able to distinguish different cell types in two-photon calcium imaging. In the second part of this thesis, I present three methods for cell type discrimination in two-photon calcium imaging of the neocortex. The first of these methods allows to distinguish GABAergic cells, astrocytes and excitatory neurons and is based on a three fluorescent labels that can be simultaneously imaged and spectrally resolved. In particular, it involves the GAD 67 -GFP transgenic mouse line (in which GABAergic neurons express green fluorescent protein (GFP)), uses the red dye sulforhodamine 101 (SR 101) for astrocyte-specific labelling and unspecific loading with the green calcium indicator OGB- 1. The second method uses post hoc immunostaining to discriminate cells according to their expression of molecular markers. Specifically, after in vivo two-photon calcium imaging and acquisition of a three-dimensional reference image stack, the brain is cut into coronal sections. Slices containing parts of the volume-of-interest are selected based on the <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> <b>pattern</b> on their thin stripe of pial surface. After immunostaining, the slices are imaged and rotation-fitted to the reference mage stack. Cell-to-cell assignment between reference image stack and slice image stacks allows cell type discrimation according to different combinations of molecular markers. I demonstrated the applicability of this approach by discriminating different GABAergic cells based on their expression of calciumbinding proteins both in GAD 67 -GFP mice and in wildtype mice expressing a genetically encoded calcium indicator (GECI). The third method is similar to the second one, but uses a cutting procedure that provides intrinsic rotation-fitting and results in tangential sections. Although further exploration of this approach is still pending, first results indicate that cells previously imaged in vivo can be easily re-identified in the sectioned brain. In summary, I introduced two flexible and extendible tools. I expect HelioScan to become the software of choice in two-photon imaging laboratories that have to deal with diverse and frequently changing hardware and functionality requirements. The rise of chronic preparations based on viral-induced GECI expression allows activity read-outs to be recorded over weeks or months. Due to the associated decrease in the relative overhead, I expect post hoc cell-type discrimination to become a technique that is routinely applied in future experiments...|$|E
40|$|Blood vessel {{formation}} {{is critical for}} growth during development and postnatal life. Failure to establish a hierarchical branched <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> <b>pattern</b> leads to early embryonic lethality, and deregulation of the vessel patterning after birth contributes {{to the development of}} inflammatory, chronic and malignant diseases. Vascular patterning involves guided vessel sprouting, branching and fusion to form a primary network, and subsequent vessel network remodeling. These angiogenic sprouting processes are governed by orchestrated communication between cells in the tissue and the endothelial cells that line the blood vessels. The formation of new blood vessels is largely controlled by diffusible Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) that is produced by cells in hypoxic environments. The resulting gradient of VEGF will trigger in neighboring endothelium  via binding to its receptor VEGFR 2 - the selection of single endothelial cells (ECs) that will become the leading tip cells, or leader cells, of emerging sprouts. Tip cells are highly invasive and motile cells. Furthermore, they extend numerous filopodia to sense guidance cues in the surrounding microenvironment and to guide the sprout towards the source of VEGF in the hypoxic tissue. The high levels of VEGFR 2 signaling experienced by tip cells result in enrichment of the Notch ligand Delta-like 4 (Dll 4) in these leading cells. As a consequence of the increased levels of Dll 4, they induce higher levels of Notch activity in adjacent ECs, and thus instruct the adjacent cells to acquire a stalk cell identity via Dll 4 /Notch-mediated lateral inhibition. The increased Notch activity in the stalk cells, or following cells, results in a transient decrease in responsiveness to the tip cell inducing stimuli because the targets of Notch signaling, Hes and Hey/Herp, encode transcriptional repressors that can directly down regulate the expression levels of VEGFR 2, VEGFR 3 and Dll 4. Stalk cells are characterized by the production of higher levels of the target genes for Notch, VEGFR 1 and Jagged 1, while the production levels of VEGFR 2 / 3 and Dll 4 are higher in the tip cells. Genetic studies have demonstrated that Notch mediated lateral inhibition is crucial to balance the number of tip and stalk cells during sprouting angiogenesis. Many members of the BMP and TGFß signaling pathways play pivotal but often poorly defined roles in angiogenesis. Yet, their importance is highlighted by an increasing list of human vascular disorders related to perturbations in these signaling cascades. Furthermore, studies using different mouse models deficient in components of the BMP/TGFb signaling cascade have demonstrated that such animals develop severe cardiovascular defects. However, a complete understanding on the specific BMP/TGFb roles in angiogenesis is obscured by confounding observations in the field. In this project, we investigated the developmental defects in mouse embryos that lack two intracellular signal transducers of the BMP signaling cascade exclusively in endothelium, and studied some of the regulation mechanisms in further detail using a plethora of cell culture assays. We report that Smad 1 /Smad 5 mediated BMP/TGFß signaling has different crucial functions in endothelium. I) It regulates directed cell migration of tip cells, and ii) synergism between Smad 1 / 5 mediated BMP signaling via Id-proteins and Notch signaling is required for the efficient selection of tip and stalk cells. The endothelium-specific inactivation of Smad 1 /Smad 5 in mouse embryos results in impaired Dll 4 /Notch signaling and increased numbers of tip cell-like cells at the expense of stalk cells. siRNA mediated Smad 1 / 5 down regulation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) impaired the expression levels of several target genes of Notch and of other stalk cell-enriched transcripts (Hes 1, Hey 1, Jagged 1, VEGFR 1 and Id 1 - 3). Furthermore, Id proteins act as competence factors for stalk cell specification and form complexes with Hes 1, which augment Hes 1 levels in the endothelium. In contrast, pharmacological inhibition of Notch signaling induced ectopic expression of BMP responsive Id-genes. Our findings provide the first in vivo evidence for a regulatory loop between BMP/TGFß-Smad 1 / 5 and Notch signaling that orchestrates tip versus stalk cell specification and vessel plasticity. In addition, we show that embryos with only one functional allele of either Smad 1 or Smad 5 in endothelium still die a little later during gestation (E 14. 5) due to severe cardiovascular and lymphatic defects. In these embryos, we describe that arterial ECs have a mixed identity and produce proteins associated with the arterial and lymphatic endothelium. These results put the BMP/TGFß signaling pathway forward as a novel regulator of EC plasticity and identity, regulation of directed cell migration, and stabilization of the number of tip/stalk cells during mouse early-onset sprouting angiogenesis.

40|$|Glioma {{growth and}} {{progression}} {{are characterized by}} abundant development of <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> that are highly aberrant and poorly functional, with detrimental consequences for drug delivery efficacy. The mechanisms driving this vessel dysmorphia during tumor progression are poorly understood. Using longitudinal intravital imaging in a mouse glioma model, we identify that dynamic sprouting and functional morphogenesis of a highly branched vessel network characterize the initial tumor growth, dramatically changing to vessel expansion, leakage, and loss of branching complexity in the later stages. This vascular phenotype transition was accompanied by recruitment of predominantly pro-inflammatory M 1 -like macrophages in the early stages, followed by in situ repolarization to M 2 -like macrophages, which produced VEGF-A and relocate to perivascular areas. A similar enrichment and perivascular accumulation of M 2 versus M 1 macrophages correlated with vessel dilation and malignancy in human glioma samples of different WHO malignancy grade. Targeting macrophages using anti-CSF 1 treatment restored normal <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> <b>patterning</b> and function. Combination treatment with chemotherapy showed survival benefit, suggesting that targeting macrophages as the key driver of <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> dysmorphia in glioma progression presents opportunities to improve efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents.

This aspect is studied {{in terms of}} quantification {{of the degree of}} complexity associated with the distribution of <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> in eye for healthy and diabetic humans. Retina images of fifteen healthy subjects are compared with those of diabetic subjects. It is found that the increased complexity of structure and texture of the diabetic subjects results in a higher fractal dimension as compared to those of healthy subjects. Also the <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> <b>patterns,</b> both for healthy and diabetic subjects show self-similarity and scale invariance and hence the patterns are fractals. For the purpose of characterization of the irregular <b>patterns</b> of <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> in retina, box counting technique is used for the estimation of fractal dimension. A GUI based program is developed in Matlab for implementation of box counting technique and determination of fractal dimensions. Fractal dimension of retina images for diabetic subjects show higher fractal dimensions indicating higher degree of structural complexity associated with the image whereas images of healthy subjects show a lower value of fractal dimension indicating limited complexity of structure. It is shown that fractal dimension can be used to distinguish diabetic subjects from healthy subjects and hence this technique could be used in diagnosis of diabetes using images of retina.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel biometric identification system with high performance {{based on the}} features obtained from human retinal images. This system is composed of three principal modules including <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> segmentation, feature generation, and feature matching. <b>Blood</b> <b>vessel</b> segmentation module has the role of extracting <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> <b>pattern</b> from retinal images. Feature generation module includes the following stages. First, the optical disk is found and a circular region of interest (ROI) around it is selected in the segmented image. Then, using a polar transformation, a rotation invariant template is created from each ROI. In the next stage, these templates are analyzed in three different scales using wavelet transform to separate vessels according to their diameter sizes. In the last stage, vessels position and orientation in each scale are used to define a feature vector for each subject in the database. For feature matching, we introduce a modified correlation measure to obtain a similarity index for each scale of the feature vector. Then, we compute {{the total value of}} the similarity index by summing scale-weighted similarity indices. Experimental results on a database, including 300 retinal images obtained from 60 subjects, demonstrated an average equal error rate equal to 1 percent for our identification system.
