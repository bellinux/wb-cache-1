25|$|Around the 1970s {{the study}} of market {{failures}} came into focus with {{the study of}} information asymmetry. In particular three authors emerged from this period: Akerlof, Spence, and Stiglitz. Akerlof considered the problem of <b>bad</b> <b>quality</b> cars driving good quality cars {{out of the market}} in his classic “The Market for Lemons” (1970) {{because of the presence of}} asymmetrical information between buyers and sellers. Michael Spence explained that signaling was fundamental in the labour market, because since employers can't know beforehand which candidate is the most productive, a college degree becomes a signaling device that a firm uses to select new personnel.|$|E

25|$|Construction was {{organized}} by Einsatzgruppe Wiking, which was based in Mo i Rana and had clerks of works in Fauske and Tømmerneset. The work was performed {{through a number of}} German construction companies. Construction on the Polar Line started from January 1943. The first part of construction was for auxiliary facilities, such as barracks, quays and power supply. The workforce largely provided by Russian and Serbian prisoners of war (POW). Despite the enormous amount of labor-force, construction of the railway was notoriously inefficient and the part of the railway which were completed further south was of such <b>bad</b> <b>quality</b> that most of the permanent way had to be replaced.

500|$|The {{tank was}} {{powered by a}} T-26 [...] flat row 4-cylinder {{air-cooled}} petrol engine, which was a complete Soviet copy of the Armstrong Siddeley engine used in the Vickers 6-Ton. The engine was located in the rear part of the hull. Early Soviet-made tank engines were of <b>bad</b> <b>quality</b> but they became better beginning in 1934. The T-26 (Armstrong Siddeley) engine {{did not have an}} over-speed limiter, which often resulted in overheating and engine valve breakage, especially in summer. A fuel tank for [...] and an oil box for [...] were placed alongside the engine. The engine required top-grade petrol; the use of second-rate petrol could cause damage to the valve units because of engine detonation. From mid-1932, a more capacious fuel tank (290 L instead of 182 L) and a simplified oil box were introduced. An engine cooling fan was mounted over the engine in a special shroud. From early 1932, the exhaust silencer was affixed by three clamps instead of two.|$|E

Because the episode takes place in winter, the animators faced some challenges that they would not have with any other episode.

50|$|The largest {{obstacle}} {{and most}} important example of Clitophon's ignorance is his ignorance of his ignorance. Slings, in his portrayals of the levels of Clitophon's character, defines Clitophon as an unabashed young man, who is defensive when provoked; this is seen in his hubristic claims to know of Socrates' speeches and methods, and his attack of Socrates. Wishing to gain the {{knowledge of how to}} attain justice for political advancement, Clitophon knows that to be told what he wants, he needs to claim aporia. However to actually experience aporia through elenchus, Clitophon needs to acknowledge ignorance and <b>bad</b> <b>qualities.</b> Clitophon remains ignorant to his <b>bad</b> <b>qualities</b> and assumes that he knows much in terms of Socrates' speeches and methodologies.

2500|$|Involuntary {{sexual arousal}} is {{explored}} in the Confessions of Augustine, wherein {{he used the}} term [...] "concupiscence" [...] to refer to sinful lust. He taught that Adam's sin is transmitted by concupiscence, or [...] "hurtful desire", resulting in humanity becoming a massa damnata (mass of perdition, condemned crowd), with much enfeebled, though not destroyed, freedom of will. When Adam sinned, human nature was thenceforth transformed. Adam and Eve, via sexual reproduction, recreated human nature. Their descendants now live in sin, {{in the form of}} concupiscence, a term Augustine used in a metaphysical, not a psychological sense. Augustine insisted that concupiscence was not a being but a <b>bad</b> <b>quality,</b> the privation of good or a wound. He admitted that sexual concupiscence (libido) might have been present in the perfect human nature in paradise, and that only later it became disobedient to human will {{as a result of the}} first couple's disobedience to God's will in the original sin. In Augustine's view (termed [...] "Realism"), all of humanity was really present in Adam when he sinned, and therefore all have sinned.

2500|$|Augustine of Hippo {{taught that}} {{original}} sin was both {{an act of}} foolishness (insipientia) and of pride and disobedience to the God of Adam and Eve. He {{thought it was a}} most subtle job to discern what came first: self-centeredness or failure in seeing truth. The sin would not have taken place, if satan hadn't sown into their senses [...] "the root of evil" [...] (radix Mali). The sin of Adam and Eve wounded their nature, affecting human intelligence and will, as well as affections and desires, including sexual desire. The consequences of the fall were transmitted to their descendants in the form of concupiscence, which is a metaphysical term, and not a psychological one. Thomas Aquinas explained Augustine's doctrine pointing out that the libido (concupiscence), which makes the original sin pass from parents to children, is not a libido actualis, i.e. sexual lust, but libido habitualis, i.e. a wound of the whole of human nature. Augustine insisted that concupiscence was not a being but <b>bad</b> <b>quality,</b> the privation of good or a wound. The bishop of Hippo admitted that sexual concupiscence (libido) might have been present in the perfect human nature in the paradise, and that only later it had become disobedient to human will {{as a result of the}} first couple's disobedience to God's will in the original sin. The original sin have made humanity a massa damnata (mass of perdition, condemned crowd). In Augustine's view (termed [...] "Realism"), all of humanity was really present in Adam when he sinned, and therefore all have sinned. Original sin, according to Augustine, consists of the guilt of Adam which all humans inherit. As sinners, humans are utterly depraved in nature, lack the freedom to do good, and cannot respond to the will of God without divine grace. Grace is irresistible, results in conversion, and leads to perseverance.|$|E
