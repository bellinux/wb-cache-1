5000|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of war both Shikari (the disarmed remote control vessel for target ships) and Sabre (which had been disarmed as an aircraft bombing target ship) were refitted for active service as escort vessels. Sturdy, which had been refitted as a minelayer, [...] sailed for Hong Kong in 1939 but was retained in the Mediterranean as attendant destroyer to the aircraft carrier , which operated as a training carrier based at Toulon between November 1939 and the French collapse in June 1940, after which she returning to home waters. Sabre was damaged by an accident early in the war and was under repair until spring 1940. At {{the time of the}} Dunkirk evacuation in May 1940, Sabre, Scimitar and Shikari were with the 16th Destroyer Flotilla at Harwich and Saladin with the 11th Destroyer Flotilla at Devonport; all participated in the evacuation, carrying over 12,000 troops between them. Saladin was severely damaged by air attack on 28 May 1940, while Shikari was the last ship to leave Dunkirk, (at 0340 hrs, 4 June 1940), with enemy troops only 3 mi away. [...] By June 1940 Sabre, Shikari, Sturdy, Scimitar, Saladin and Sardonyx (together with the last R-class destroyer, [...] ) had formed the 22nd Destroyer Flotilla at Portsmouth; they remained there in readiness to repel a German invasion, until the autumn, when they started being allocated as escorts to Atlantic convoys. Sturdy was lost on 30 October 40 while on such duty. In 1941-42 they were refitted as escort vessels: the forward 4-inch gun was retained, but the other guns and torpedo tubes were landed; in their place, two quadruple 0.5-inch anti-aircraft (AA) guns were mounted between the funnels; a single a 12-pounder AA gun replaced the forward <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>tubes,</b> and eight depth charge throwers plus two stern racks were added (40-70 depth charges were carried). Later four single 20 mm AA replaced the 0.5-inch machine guns, and the number of depth charge throwers was reduced to four. Type 291 radar was added. Deep load displacement rose to 1385-1400 tons; Their over-loading caused them to roll terribly in rough North Atlantic weather. They served in Atlantic convoy escort groups based at Londonderry from 1940-41, and later the 21st Escort Group based in Iceland, 1942-44. Their sole success against German U-boats was on 29 June 1941 when Scimitar was escorting Convoy HX 133 and participated in the destruction of U.651 south of Iceland. As more modern ships reached the fleet in numbers, they transferred to coastal convoy work in Home Waters in late 1943-mid 1944, before paying off as training ships or to reserve in late 1944 (although Sabre was still active as a coastal escort on VE Day).|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The major {{efficiency}} {{loss of a}} boiler {{is caused by the}} hot stack gases discharging to the atmosphere which is polluting the atmosphere and on other side Pollution Control Board is forcing the norms of Pollution levels in atmosphere. One of the most cost-effective ways of improving the efficiency of a high pressure steam boiler is to install an economizer on the boiler. An economizer is a heat exchanger, which transfers heat from the stack gases to the incoming feedwater. Typically, on a high pressure water tube boiler, the efficiency improvement with an economizer is 2 to 4 %, depending on firing rate. On a high pressure fire tube boiler, the improvement is 2 to 3. 5 %, depending on boiler size and firing rate. The economizers are located in the boiler stack close to the stack gas outlet of the boiler. They may be supported from overhead or from the floor. A feedwater line, which serves the boiler, is piped to the unit. No additional feedwater control valves or stack gas dampers are required. Presently in NTPC stage II units there are banks of tubes in economizer. There was a proposal from management to add another <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>tubes</b> in the economizer so that there will be control of pollutants coming out from boiler.

40|$|Eco-friendly non-CFC {{refrigerants}} {{were introduced}} in the Air Conditioning and Refrigeration industry {{during the last few}} years to reduce damage to the stratospheric ozone layer. The HFC refrigerant R- 134 a, which has zero Ozone Depletion Potential (ODP), is being used extensively as a replacement for R- 12 and also in some centrifugal chillers as a replacement for R- 11. However, the disadvantage of R- 134 a is its comparatively high global warming potential (GWP). Owing to energy crisis and also to reduce the indirect warming impact resulting from electrical energy usage, the new refrigeration systems should be operated at the lowest possible condensing temperatures. In view of this, several active and passive techniques for augmentation of condensation heat transfer and reduction of condensation temperature are gaining increasing attention. Passive augmentation methods are more popular than active ones. To this end, micro-finned tubes of various geometrical shapes are being explored for compact heat exchangers in the refrigeration industry as the best choice. Towards understanding the enhancement in condensation heat transfer coefficients in micro-finned tubes, a test facility has been fabricated to measure the condensing coefficients for R- 134 a refrigerant. Condensation experiments have been conducted on single plain and finned tubes of outer diameter 19 mm with a refrigerant saturation temperature of 400 C and tube wall temperatures 350 C, 320 C, 300 C and 280 C respectively. Water is used as the cooling medium inside the tubes with the flow rate varying from 180 lph to 600 lph. The condensing coefficient typically ranged from 0. 9 – 1. 4 kW/(m 2 K) for plain tubes and from 4. 2 to 5. 8 kW/(m 2 K) for the finned tubes. The results of the plain v tube are found to compare favourably with the Nusselt’s theory, leading to a validation of the experimental procedure. Upon comparing the results of finned and plain tubes, it is found that provision of fins result in an enhancement factor of 3. 6 to 4. 6 in the condensation heat transfer coefficients. This level of enhancement is larger than that resulting from the enhanced surface area of the finned tube surface, suggesting that, apart from the extended area, the surface tension forces {{play an important role in}} the augmentation process by driving the condensate from the fin crests to the valleys in between the fins. The measured augmentation factors have also been cross-checked using the Wilson plot method. Detailed error analysis has been performed to quantify the uncertainty in the condensation heat transfer coefficient. The performance of a <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>tubes</b> has been determined based on the measurements carried out on practical condensers of two large chillers with refrigerating capacities of 500 TR and 550 TR. On comparing the finned tube bank results and the single finned tube results, it is found that the average condensation heat transfer coefficient in a <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>tubes</b> having N rows varies as N ¯ 1 / 6. The deterioration is in agreement with the relation proposed by Kern...|$|E
40|$|Many heat {{transfer}} {{applications such as}} steam generators in a boiler or air cooling coil of an air conditioner, can be modelled in a <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>tubes</b> containing a fluid flowing at one temperature that is immersed in a second fluid in a cross flow at different temperature. CFD simulations are {{a useful tool for}} understanding flow and {{heat transfer}} principles as well as for modelling these types of geometries. Both the fluids considered in the present study are CUO Nano fluids, and flow is classified as laminar and steady with Reynolds number between 100 - 600. The mass flow rate of the cross flow and diameter has been varied (such as 0. 05, 0. 1, 0. 15, 0. 20, 0. 25, 0. 30 kg/sec and 0. 8, 1. 0. 1. 2 & 1. 4 cm) and the models are used to predict the flow and temperature fields that result from convective heat transfer. Due to symmetry of the tube bank and the periodicity of the flow inherent in the tube bank geometry, only a portion of the geometry will be modelled and with symmetry applied to the outer boundaries. The inflow boundary will be redefined as a periodic zone and the outflow boundary is defined as the shadow. The various static pressures, velocities, and temperatures obtained are reported. In this present project tubes of different diameters and different mass flow rates are considered to examine the optimal flow distribution. Further the problem has been subjected to effect of materials used for tubes manufacturing on heat transfer rate. Materials considered are copper and Nickle Chromium alloys.
