500|$|Enio Chiola of PopMatters, {{included}} the song {{on his list}} of [...] "Top 15 Madonna Singles of All Time". He opined that [...] " [...] features a more demure Madonna, confident in her termination of a doomed relationship, and the music is accented by characteristically Asian orchestration and lovely poetic lyrics", concluding that [...] " [...] quickly learned that the {{way back into the}} public's collective hearts was to focus more attention on the music than on the frankness of her sexual image". In his 2011 review of Bedtime Stories, Brett Callwood of the Detroit Metro Times called the song [...] "spectacular". NPR Multimedia senior producer Keith Jenkins gave a positive review of the song, stating that it [...] "washes over you and gets your <b>blood</b> <b>boiling.</b> You may not walk on water after hearing it, but you may want to get your focus back by walking on broken glass". Louis Virtel, from TheBacklot.com, placed [...] "Take a Bow" [...] at number 27 of his list [...] "The 100 Greatest Madonna Songs". He wrote; [...] "Madonna's most successful single to date is a melancholic evisceration of a lover's artifice, and its hopeless plain-spokenness makes it one of the finest examples of 90s balladry". Rikky Rooksby, author of The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna, was less impressed with the track. Although he felt that it sounded [...] "shockingly normal" [...] after the [...] "ambient 'Bedtime Story'", he found the song's length as over-long and deduced it to be [...] "communica no sense whatsoever of the pain of a real goodbye." ...|$|E
500|$|Unfortunately, {{their journey}} {{does not pay}} off well. The {{customer}} is revealed to be Tom (a recurring character throughout the series), who is at first happy that he finally got his pizza, until he discovers {{he did not get}} the drink he claims to have asked for. A confused SpongeBob checks the order, which says that Tom didn't order a drink (although it is heavily implied that Mr. Krabs didn't hear Tom's order correctly or that he hung up before Tom had a chance to finish). His <b>blood</b> <b>boiling</b> with anger, Tom harshly berates SpongeBob and refuses to take the pizza or pay for it before slamming the door. SpongeBob goes back to Squidward and collapses to the ground and cries (while absorbing his tears). Infuriated that Tom berated SpongeBob and won't pay for the pizza all because of a missing drink (making the long journey and the ridiculous obstacles the duo went through a complete waste of time), Squidward confronts Tom who arrogantly says, [...] "Another one? Look, I told your little friend I ain't payin' for that!" [...] to which Squidward angrily claims, [...] "Well, this one's on the house!" [...] and brutally shoves the pizza into Tom's face as payback for his rudeness. Squidward then goes back to SpongeBob who, stilling crying, asks, [...] "Did he change his mind?" [...] Squidward cheers him up by saying, [...] "He sure did. Ate the whole thing in one bite." [...] The two then drive back to the Krusty Krab, which is comically revealed to be right across the street, much to Squidward's dismay, who then says [...] "Oh, my aching tentacles!".|$|E

60|$|They dined together, sumptuously. The wine flowed freely, {{as indeed}} {{it had done}} all day. Sir Mulberry drank to recompense himself for his recent abstinence; the young lord, to drown his indignation; and the {{remainder}} of the party, because the wine was of the best and they had nothing to pay.

60|$|Sometimes, the <b>blood</b> <b>boiling</b> in my veins, I would turn, {{thinking}} {{to go back}} and at all risk defying my tormentors, prove to myself I was no coward. But before I had retraced my steps a dozen paces, I would see in imagination the whole scene again before me: the laughing crowd, the halting passers-by, the spiteful, mocking little faces every way I turned; and so instead would creep on home, and climbing stealthily up into my own room, cry my heart out in the dark upon my bed.|$|E

60|$|Next morning, at sunrise, {{almost the}} whole of the frigate's crew landed in Port of Spain, fully armed, with Captain Vaughan at their head; the hot Welsh <b>blood</b> <b>boiling</b> in him. He unfurled the British flag, and marched into the town to take vengeance on the mob. A Spanish officer, with two or three men, came forward. What did a British captain mean by violating the law of nations? Vaughan would chastise the rascally French who had {{attacked}} his men. Then he must either kill the Spaniard or take him prisoner: and the officer tendered his sword.|$|E

Her <b>blood</b> <b>boiling</b> at what she apprehended, Phoebe could endure her present post no longer, and starting up, made the signal for leaving the dinner-table so suddenly that Augusta choked upon her glass of wine, and carried off her last macaroon in her hand. Before she had recovered breath to rebuke her sister's precipitation, Phoebe, with boldness and spirit quite new to the sisters, was confronting Juliana, and demanding what she had been saying about Hampstead.|$|E

[...] "It won't do any good to flare up here," [...] I went on to say to him; [...] "fact's fact, and we was servants, and good ones, too, though I say it myself, and the trouble is we haven't got into the way of altogether forgetting it, or, at least, acting as if we had forgotten it." ...|$|E
6000|$|What {{they had}} not {{foreseen}} was that knowledge of the future in no way affected their emotions of the present. Nathaniel Armitage grew day by day more hopelessly in love with bewitching Alice Blatchley. The thought of her marrying anyone else--the long-haired, priggish Camelford in particular--sent the <b>blood</b> <b>boiling</b> through his veins; added to which sweet Alice, with her arms about his neck, would confess to him that life without him would be a misery hardly to be endured, that the {{thought of him as}} the husband of another woman--of Nellie Fanshawe in particular--was madness to her. It was right perhaps, knowing what they did, that they should say good-bye to one another. She would bring sorrow into his life. Better far that he should put her away from him, that she should die of a broken heart, as she felt sure she would. How could he, a fond lover, inflict this suffering upon her? He ought of course to marry Nellie Fanshawe, but he could not bear the girl. Would it not be the height of absurdity to marry a girl he strongly disliked because twenty years hence she might be more suitable to him than the woman he now loved and who loved him? ...|$|E

I {{answered}} him: 'We shall be married within a month!' We parted in anger. It was a May night, and I walked out far into the country. There's no remedy for anger, or, indeed, for anything, so fine as walking. Once I stopped--it was on a common, without a house or light, and the stars shining like jewels. I was hot from walking, I could feel the <b>blood</b> <b>boiling</b> in my veins--I said to myself 'Old, are you?' And I laughed like a fool. It was the thought of losing her--I wished to believe myself angry, but really I was afraid; fear and anger in me are very much the same. A friend of mine, {{a bit of a}} poet, sir, once called them 'the two black wings of self.' And so they are, so they are...! The next morning I went to Dalton again, and somehow I made him yield.
