40|$|AbstractShrinking is a newly {{proposed}} {{technique for}} combining {{a pair of}} pseudo random binary sequences, (a,s), {{to form a new}} sequence, z, with better randomness, where randomness here stands for difficulty of prediction. The ones in the second sequence s are used to point out the bits in the sequence a to be included in z. The generator that performs this process is known as the shrinking generator (SG). In this paper, it is shown for the existing combining method that deviation from randomness in the statistics of a leads to the leakage of this statistics into z. We also show that it is sufficient for constructing a statistically balanced SG to at least have one statistically <b>balanced</b> <b>generator.</b> A new shrinking rule that yields statistically balanced output, even if a and s are not balanced, is then proposed. Self-shrinking in which a single pseudo random bit generator (PRBG) shrinks itself is also investigated and a modification of the existing shrinking rule is proposed. Simulation results show the robustness of the proposed methods. For self-shrinking, in particular, results show that the proposed shrinking rule yields sequences with balanced statistics even for extremely biased generators. This suggests possible application of the new rule to strengthen running key generators...|$|E
50|$|Hot standby {{may have}} a {{slightly}} different connotation of being active but not productive to hot spare, that is it is a state rather than object. For example, in a national power grid, the supply of power needs to be balanced to demand over a short term. It can take many hours to bring a coal-fired power station up to productive temperatures. To allow for load <b>balancing,</b> <b>generator</b> turbines may be kept running with the generators switched off so as peaks of demand occur, the generators can rapidly be switched on to balance the load. Being {{in the state of}} being ready to run is known as hot standby. Though it is not a modern phenomenon, steam train operators might hold a spare steam engine at a terminus fired up, as starting an engine cold would take a significant amount of time.|$|R

The {{shrinking}} generator is a keystream generator {{which is}} good for stream ciphers in wireless mobile communications, because it has simple structure and generates a keystream faster than other generators.

By sparsest, we mean that each row has the least possible number of nonzeros, while balanced {{means that the}} number of nonzeros in any two columns differs by at most one.

The problem was first studied by Dau et al. who showed, using probabilistic arguments, that there always exists an MDS code over a sufficiently large field such that its generator matrix is both sparsest and balanced. Motivated by the need for an explicit construction with efficient decoding, the authors of the current paper showed that the generator matrix of a cyclic Reed-Solomon code of length n and dimension k can always be transformed to one that is both sparsest and balanced, when n and k are such that k/n (n-k+ 1) is an integer.

40|$|From {{the second}} half of the last century ecology has been {{recognized}} as one of the most important value in landscape design, together with aesthetics and social involvement (Ian H. Thompson). After a period dominated by the prevalence of the aesthetical values in landscape/gardens conception a new perspective arose: the global growth and the effects of exploitation of natural resources have generated an increasing awareness about the impacts of human life on environment and a reflection on new possible way of living balancing the quality of life and the respect for nature in our territories. The ecological approach has developed thanks to some landscape architects contributions, based on their researches on: the displacement from a more anthropocentric to a more ecocentric view in landscape planning (Ian McHarg) and the introduction of the principles of balance, diversity, sustainability in order to learn to perceive and to design healty landscapes. Working with nature, in landscape urbanism, means to activate processes involving plants, animals and people, with the aim of improving the quality of life in urban environment. Therefore ecology is strictly linked to aesthetical and social aspects: landscape design must relate spatial values, by reinterpreting and enhancing the characters of the places, with social values, by introducing activities to strengthen social interactions. In contemporary landscape design, ecology is interpreted as a key approach, concerning mostly regenerative design (J. T Lyle). This innovative concept considers design as the cultural instrument accompanying and orienting ecological processes. In fact landscape design deals with urban development strategies, interventions on urban fringes, reclamation of waste lands: in all cases arise the necessity to rethink the territories starting from the restoration of an interrupted balance between natural resources and anthropic actions. The ecological approach is based on the use of natural elements and dynamics as a means for transformation of the territories. One powerful effect of these interventions is the capacity to recover the relationship between people and the spirit of the places and sometimes, the possibility to build a new identity, especially in rejected areas, and this is a “catalyst act”, involving society in regenerative design programs. New green structures enhancing environmental qualities and protecting biodiversity, agricultural technologies remediating soils and water are only few of the potentials of landscape ecology. Another important consequence of this innovative approach is the rise of a new aesthetics, as “nature is perceived as a process, not as a scenary” (R. Smithson). Recognizing change and uncertainty as the basic dynamics of landscape (M. Antrop), designers methods and sensitivity appear more effective if based on predicting different and open scenarios. But ecology is not a panacea itself: the risks in ecosystem service approach are several. First, specially in public spaces design, there is the risk of confusing the primary values of the action of planting trees and greenery: some aesthetical choices could not represent the ecological efficiency. This happens very often because the client’s will is more oriented to achieve an immediate effect, where vegetation’s use is equated to a decorative device, instead of a new <b>balance</b> <b>generator</b> one. Similarly, choices based on low maintenance perspective are not always synonymous of ecology. Furthermore, in Urban Planning, prescriptions about greenery and trees plantation follow some quantitative parameters instead of qualitative ones. The contribution of landscape design to Urbanism is based on a multidisciplinary approach which tends to detect and enhance those hidden and overwritten features characterizing the “genius loci”. Thus, ecology represents a site specific aspect and its introduction in landscape urbanism supposes a deep knowledge of the process and its effects on environment and on society...|$|R

40|$|Building new {{industrial}} plants in developing rural counties, {{as shown in}} Fig. 1, {{has the advantage of}} low land cost, honest labor and lower taxes; however, the ability of the utility grid to supply power must be carefully planned in advance of construction.

In these weak or new utility supplies, the case of unbalanced phases presents a difficult challenge, particularly to 3 -phase motors, because the sources of imbalance arise from numerous unsymmetrical conditions. Unsymmetrical transformer windings or transmission line impedance, unbalanced 3 -phase loads or a large single-phase load cause unbalanced supply. Usually phases are only <b>balanced</b> at the <b>generator,</b> and sources of imbalance can be found throughout the system. However, regardless of the cause, in an ac-connected machine, even a small voltage imbalance can induce large negative sequence currents and harmonics, due to the relatively low negative sequence impedance of a motor.

One of the problems left to solve was how to mount the balancing weight on to the rotor inside the air gap of the generator. This has to be solved before the overhead goal of balancing on site is going to be possible. This thesis work is a continuation of the results that emerge during the course “creative product development” at Luleå Technical University 2004 - 2005 when a project group received the same question at issue to investigate. The work started with analysing the work and result this group came up with. Based on that we analysed if some of the these ideas is possible to develop or to be improved. The goal with the work is to manufacture a prototype that works and be implemented in ALSTOM as a service to offer to the customers. All solutions have been discussed together with the R&D department at ALSTOM to avoid the biggest errors that can occur merging different technical areas. This has also given us an insight how ALSTOM earlier has thought about some to the problems that we have been facing during the work. The work have followed the product development process designed by Karl T. Ulrich and Steven D. Eppinger in the book “Product Design and Development”. After the first investigating steps we started to work in a 3 D-envieroment with the software IDEAS. Before the prototype was sent to production a number of simulations in 3 D-space was performed to ensure that the physical dimensions would not be a problem. Finally the production was outsourced to an external company specialized on making prototype models. With the final product produced a number of tests have been carried out to verify our simulations and assumptions. These tests have given the results that ALSTOM was looking for and probably during 2007 ALSTOM will start selling the service balancing on site. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R

In this paper, an isolated wind energy conversion system is implemented using a variable speed permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) with PWM rectifier and a battery for storing the excess amount of wind energy. To change the duty cycle of the converter, a controller of DC-DC buck converter with MOSFET as a switching component is designed using P, PI and PID controller to provide the efficient choice for the selection of the controller. The proposed scheme is implemented in MATLAB using Simulink & the simulation results show that the output voltage of the converter can be controlled according to the value of duty cycle and the excess power is stored in battery to provide <b>balance</b> between the <b>generator</b> and the load.

40|$|AbstractThe growing {{share of}} {{electricity}} production from {{variable renewable energy}} sources increases the stochastic nature of the power system. This has repercussions on the markets for electricity. Deviations from forecasted production schedules require <b>balancing</b> of a <b>generator’s</b> position within a day. Short term products that are traded on power and/or reserve markets {{have been developed for}} this purpose, providing opportunities to actors who can offer flexibility in the short term. The value of flexibility is typically modelled using stochastic scenario extensions of dispatch models which requires, as a first step, understanding the nature of forecast uncertainties. This study provides a new approach for determining the forecast errors of wind power generation in the time period between the closure of the day ahead and the opening of the first intraday session using Spain as an example. The methodology has been developed using time series analysis for the years 2010 – 2013 to find the explanatory variables of the wind error variability by applying clustering techniques to reduce the range of uncertainty, and regressive techniques to forecast the probability density functions of the intra-day price. This methodology has been tested considering different system actions showing its suitability for developing intra-day bidding strategies and also for the generation of electricity generated from Renewable Energy Sources scenarios. This methodology could help a wind power producer to optimally bid into the intraday market based on more accurate scenarios, increasing their revenues and the system value of wind...|$|R
40|$|Image {{generation}} with Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) {{has been}} {{popular in the}} last few years by using the knowledge about objects and structures to generate dreamlike images, applying smart filters or making images appear scary. Although vivid and impressive, the generated images do not appear natural to a human viewer. One can easily tell that an image is generated or digitally altered. This is not too surprising as the neural networks are usually trained with the goal of learning the common structures for image recognition and object classification. Training ANNs to generate better images is a hard problem to solve with conventional supervised learning, requiring a human to judge the quality of the generated images. Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) is a new approach that replaces the human judge with a neural network. This network is called the Discriminator and evaluates generated images from the other neural network called the Generator. These two networks partake in an adversarial battle to improve their own performance. The results of this battle is a model capable of generating new natural looking images based on unsupervised learning of an image dataset. GAN have evolved considerably since its inception, but there are still open problems. One such problem is how to objectively evaluate their performance and the quality of their generated output. Image generation has no fixed solution, and evaluating it is a difficult as evaluating other creative works. One method allows for two GANs to be compared by battling them against each other. This thesis will propose a custom state-of-the-art implementation of this method that allows for comparison between two GAN models both overall and throughout the learning process. GANs have a reputation for being hard to train. One concrete problem is maintaining the <b>balance</b> between the <b>Generator</b> and Discriminator. As for humans, it is easier to rate the quality of images then it is to actually create them. A good evaluator is necessary, but it must not outpower the generative model. This thesis will propose concrete techniques that favour the Generator without limiting the Discriminator. Two main approaches will be explored to achieve this. The first method makes guided alterations to the usually random input of the Generator. The second method adds an additional Discriminator to the model. Techniques based on both of these methods were shown to effectively guide the training process and creating strong models that outperformed regular GANs when compared with the previously mentioned evaluation metric...|$|R
40|$|The {{penetration}} of micro-grid system containing renewable energy generation is increasing exponentially for alleviating the energy source crisis and environmental pollution. Micro-grids {{are expected to}} achieve two priority aims, which are increase in stability and improvement of renewable energy generation efficiency. In terms of the first aim, micro-grid needs to keep operating with or without main-grid connecting. In grid disconnected condition, which is also called islanded condition, micro-grid system has to ensure its reliability and energy quality, to <b>balance</b> power between <b>generators</b> and loads. For the second aim, micro-grid with renewable energy sources is expected to extract maximum available energy at any moment. For realizing this aim, the energy storage system should be embedded in a micro-grid to help sharing the surplus energy from generators or missing energy required by loads. Based on above two aims, this thesis presents a comprehensive modeling of a micro-grid with the functions of islanding detection, autonomous operation, synchronization and re-synchronization and energy storage. Topology of local distribution generation is modeled by a grid-tied inverter with LCL filter. Proportional resonant controller is applied to control the inverter. A new islanding detection method which {{is a combination of}} two passive detection methods has been adopted in this research. A new method for autonomous operation of islanded micro-grid which combines weak droop control and PQ control has been used in this research. An effective and fast 50 Hz-signal extracting filter, Windowed-sinc band-pass filter has been used for synchronizing and re-synchronizing between micro-grid and main grid. A combination of bi-directional buck/boost converter and DC/AC converter is applied to connect the energy storage block with micro-grid to fulfill the discharging/charging function. A full code-based implementation of this micro-grid modeling has been conducted in Matlab Simulink environment. The simulation results have verified that this new micro-grid model could operate well. Specifically, firstly, by combining two passive islanding detection methods, one can reach error-free islanding detection and protection. Secondly, autonomous operation of micro-grid containing three DGs could be realized by employing weak droop control and PQ control. The weak droop control could share the unbalanced energy between generators and loads automatically. Thirdly, smooth synchronization and re-synchronization could be obtained by extracting fundamental signal of each inverter output by the Windowed-sinc band-pass filter. Lastly, a battery energy system has been adopted to inject or absorb energy into or from micro-grid...|$|R
