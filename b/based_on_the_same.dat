The fuzzy model is presented on one real data case. Next, the new approach, called Set of Experience Knowledge Structure (SOEKS) is adopted and presented <b>basing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> data. Instead of using data stored in the rules (fuzzy model), the market is presented using the experience stored in SOEKS.

In Chiquitos, the oldest mission, San Xavier, formed the basis for the organizational style, which consisted of a modular structure, the center formed by a wide rectangular square, with the church complex on one side and the houses of the inhabitants on the three remaining sides. The centralized organization of the Jesuits dictated a certain uniformity of measures and sizes.
