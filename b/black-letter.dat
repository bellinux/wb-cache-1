2500|$|The first {{printing}} used a black letter typeface {{instead of}} a roman typeface, which itself made a political and a religious statement. Like the Great Bible and the Bishops' Bible, the Authorized Version was [...] "appointed to be read in churches". It was a large folio volume meant for public use, not private devotion; {{the weight of the}} type mirrored the weight of establishment authority behind it. However, smaller editions and roman-type editions followed rapidly, e.g. quarto roman-type editions of the Bible in 1612. This contrasted with the Geneva Bible, which was the first English Bible printed in a roman typeface (although <b>black-letter</b> editions, particularly in folio format, were issued later).|$|E
2500|$|Nicol {{was born}} in Scotland, {{probably}} in May 1740 (or perhaps in 1741). Around 1769, he moved to London and began working for his uncle, David Wilson at his shop in the Strand. Later, the two men became partners. By spring 1773, Nicol had already become sufficiently successful to receive the king's informal commission to purchase books on his behalf. At {{the sale of the}} library of James West, president of the Royal Society, fellow booksellers such as John Almon were surprised when Nicol bought almost all available books printed by William Caxton. One remarked that [...] "a Scotchman had lavished away the king's money in buying old <b>black-letter</b> books." [...] In fact, Nicol had instructions from George III not to bid against any buyers who wanted [...] "books of science and belles lettres for their own progressive or literary pursuits".|$|E
2500|$|... was a {{decision}} by the House of Lords which established a new area of English tort law. Fletcher employed contractors to build a reservoir, playing no active role in its construction. When the contractors discovered a series of old coal shafts improperly filled with debris, they chose to continue work rather than properly blocking them up. The result was that on 11 December 1860, shortly after being filled for the first time, Fletcher's reservoir burst and flooded a neighbouring mine, run by Rylands, causing £937 worth of damage, equivalent to £102,768 [...] in 2015 terms. Rylands brought a claim under negligence against Fletcher, through which the case eventually went to the Exchequer of Pleas. The majority ruled in favour of Fletcher. Bramwell B, however, dissenting, argued that the claimant had the right to enjoy his land free of interference from water, and that as a result the defendant was guilty of trespass and the commissioning of a nuisance. Bramwell's argument was affirmed, both by the Court of Exchequer Chamber and the House of Lords, leading {{to the development of the}} [...] "Rule in Rylands v Fletcher"; that [...] "the person who for his own purposes brings on his lands and collects and keeps there anything likely to do mischief if it escapes, must keep it in at his peril, and, if he does not do so, is prima facie answerable for all the damage which is the natural consequence of its escape". No right [...] "to enjoy property" [...] exists in UK <b>black-letter</b> law, and it is this decision upon which stare decisis is built in the area.|$|E

When to the table-phrase {{more than}} one number is placed, then expect not that the same <b>black-letter</b> word is always {{to be found in}} the book to the last number, as is to the first number, but it may be some other black or marked word of like meaning; as for antichrist the black-lettered word in some places is harlot, and for apostles the <b>black-letter</b> word {{sometimes}} is twelve, because the word apostle is not in that part of the folio, though intended by twelve.|$|E

60|$|Some time ago, when {{spending}} a delightful week-end at the ancestral castle of my dear old friend, the Duke of Weatherstonhope (pronounced Wop), I came across an old <b>black-letter</b> MS. It {{is on this}} that the story which follows is based.|$|E

60|$|While Scott was reading, {{the sage}} grimalkin, already mentioned, {{had taken his}} seat in a chair beside the fire, and {{remained}} with fixed eye and grave demeanor, as if listening to the reader.

60|$|Then came {{what was}} perhaps as curious an entry as {{anything}} upon this extraordinary {{relic of the}} past. It is executed in black letter, written over the crosses or Crusaders' swords, and dated fourteen hundred and forty-five. As the best plan will be {{to allow it to}} speak for itself, I here give the <b>black-letter</b> fac-simile, together with the original Latin without the contractions, from which it will be seen that the writer was a fair mediæval Latinist. Also we discovered what is still more curious, an English version of the <b>black-letter</b> Latin. This, also written in black letter, we found inscribed on a second parchment that was in the coffer, apparently somewhat older in date than that on which was inscribed the mediæval Latin translation of the uncial Greek of which I shall speak presently. This I also give in full.|$|E
60|$|Until I {{came upon}} this <b>black-letter</b> MS. I {{had been under}} the impression, like, I presume, {{everybody}} else, that every Knight of the Round Table was a model of physical strength and beauty.

60|$|I {{should like}} to be present {{at one of these}} feasts. I saw also an old vellum manuscript, in <b>black-letter,</b> which {{appeared}} to be a record of the proceedings of the company; and at the end there were many pages ruled for further entries, but none had been made in the volume for {{the last three or four}} hundred years.|$|E
60|$|In this chair, {{from one}} year's end to another, sat that prodigious bookworm, Cotton Mather, {{sometimes}} devouring a great book, and sometimes scribbling one as big.

60|$|This early {{simplicity}} is succeeded, in French books, from, say, 1510, and afterwards, by {{the insertion}} {{either of the}} printer's trademark, or, in <b>black-letter</b> books, of a rough woodcut, illustrative {{of the nature of}} the volume. The woodcuts have occasionally a rude kind of grace, with a touch of the classical taste of the early Renaissance surviving in extreme decay.|$|E
60|$|In fact, in {{crossing}} the Trent {{one seems to}} step back into old times; and in the villages of Sherwood Forest {{we are in a}} <b>black-letter</b> region.

60|$|Master Headley turned {{aside as}} quickly as he could, through Paternoster Row, which was full of stalls, where little black books, and larger sheets printed in <b>black-letter,</b> seemed the staple commodities, and thence the burgess, keeping a heedful eye on his young companions among all his greetings, entered the broader space of Cheapside, where {{numerous}} prentice lads seemed to be playing at different sports after the labours of the day.|$|E

60|$|I was {{informed}} by Frank Bracebridge that the parson {{had been a}} chum of his father's at Oxford, and had received this living shortly after the latter had come to his estate. He was a complete <b>black-letter</b> hunter, and would scarcely read a work printed in the Roman character. The editions of Caxton and Wynkin de Worde were his delight; and he was indefatigable in his researches after such old English writers as have fallen into oblivion from their worthlessness. In deference, perhaps, to the notions of Mr. Bracebridge, he had made diligent investigations into the festive rites and holiday customs of former times; and had been as zealous in the inquiry {{as if he had}} been a boon companion; but it was merely with that plodding spirit with which men of adust temperament follow up any track of study, merely because it is denominated learning; indifferent to its intrinsic nature, whether it be the illustration of the wisdom, or of the ribaldry and obscenity of antiquity. He had pored over these old volumes so intensely, that they seemed to have been reflected into his countenance indeed; which, if the face be an index of the mind, might be compared to a title-page of <b>black-letter.</b>|$|E
6000|$|In Mr Ritson's {{curious and}} {{valuable}} collection of legendary poetry, entitled Ancient Songs, {{he has published}} this Border ditty, from a collation of two old <b>black-letter</b> copies, one {{in the collection of}} the late John duke of Roxburghe, and another in the hands of John Bayne, Esq.--The learned editor mentions another copy, beginning, [...] "Good Lord John is a hunting gone." [...] The present edition was procured for me by my friend Mr W. Laidlaw, in Blackhouse, and has been long current in Selkirkshire.

60|$|Rollo pointed as he {{said this}} to an aged woman, whose face, which was {{of the color of}} mahogany, was {{wrinkled}} in a most extraordinary manner, and who wore a cap of very remarkable shape and dimensions. She had an antique-looking book in her hands, the contents of which she seemed to be conning over with great attention. Mr. George and Rollo looked down upon the pages of the book as they passed, {{and saw that it was}} printed in what might be called an ancient <b>black-letter</b> type.|$|E
6000|$|The evening {{passed away}} delightfully in this quaint-looking apartment, half study, half drawing-room. Scott read several {{passages}} from the old romance of [...] "Arthur," [...] with a fine, deep sonorous voice, and a gravity of tone that seemed to suit the antiquated, <b>black-letter</b> volume. It was a rich treat to hear such a work, read by such a person, and in such a place; and his appearance as he sat reading, in a large armed chair, with his favorite hound Maida at his feet, and surrounded by books and relics, and border trophies, would have formed an admirable and most characteristic picture.|$|E
60|$|A {{few years}} hence, and the antiquary of another {{generation}} looking into some mouldy {{record of the}} strife and passions that agitated the world in these times, may glance his eye over the pages we have just filled: and not all {{his knowledge of the}} history of the past, not all his <b>black-letter</b> lore, or his skill in book-collecting, not all the dry studies of a long life, or the dusty volumes that have cost him a fortune, may help him to the whereabouts, either of Scotland-yard, or of any one of the landmarks we have mentioned in describing it.|$|E
60|$|As to the House of the Four Chimneys, {{it still}} {{remains in the}} great and tall family of the Van Hornes.

6000|$|I {{found the}} tide of wine and wassail fast gaining on the dry land of sober judgment. The company grew merrier and louder as their jokes grew duller. Master Simon was in as {{chirping}} a humour as a grasshopper filled with dew; his old songs grew of a warmer complexion, {{and he began to}} talk maudlin about the widow. He even gave a long song about the wooing of a widow, which he informed me he had gathered from an excellent <b>black-letter</b> work, entitled [...] "Cupid's Solicitor for Love," [...] containing store of good advice for bachelors, and which he promised to lend me.
