Turkey closed its border with Armenia, while the United Nations passed a resolution condemning the act. In the summer of 1993, Armenian forces gained more territories and, by August controlled Fizuli, Jebrail, and Zangelan. By early 1994, both countries were devastated by the war. On 5 May, the <b>Bishkek</b> Protocol was signed by {{the heads of the}} parliaments of Nagorno-Karabakh, Armenia and Azerbaijan. The Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, backed by Armenia, established de facto control of these lands. Nagorno-Karabakh (also known as Artsakh to Armenians) remains internationally unrecognized and a de jure part of Azerbaijan. However, it is in de facto unified with Armenia.|$|E

25|$|The Kyrgyz Revolution of 2010, {{also known}} as the Second Kyrgyz Revolution, began in April 2010 with the ousting of Kyrgyz {{president}} Kurmanbek Bakiyev in the capital <b>Bishkek.</b> It was followed by increased ethnic tension involving Kyrgyz people and Uzbeks in the south of the country, which escalated in June 2010. The violence ultimately led to the consolidation of a new parliamentary system in Kyrgyzstan.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to <b>Bishkek</b> and Talas, rallies and protests {{were reported in}} other parts of the country, including Naryn, Tokmok, and the Issyk-Kul region.

50|$|Because of {{sensitivity}} {{about the economic}} consequences of a continued outflow of Russians (brain drain), then president Askar Akayev took particular pains to reassure the non-Kyrgyz that no Islamic revolution would occur. Akayev paid public visits to <b>Bishkek's</b> main Russian Orthodox church and directed one million rubles from the state treasury toward that faith's church-building fund. He also appropriated funds and other support for a German cultural center. Nevertheless, there has been support from local government to build bigger mosques and religious schools. Additionally, recent bills have been proposed to outlaw abortion, and numerous {{attempts have been made}} to decriminalize polygamy and to allow officials to travel to Mecca on a hajj under a tax-free agreement.|$|R

50|$|The Central Election Commission {{completed}} registering {{presidential candidates}} on 13 June. Elections had last been held on October 29, 2000, {{with the next}} previously scheduled for late 2005. The 2000 election was marred by allegations of fraud, heightened by the high percentage of the vote for President Akayev - 74%. His nearest rival was Omurbek Tekebayev who polled 14%. Former Vice-President and opposition leader Felix Kulov had initially decided {{to run in the}} 2005 poll, but later withdrew from the race. This followed an agreement with acting President Bakyiev, whereby Kulov would become Prime Minister should the interim leader win the election. Urmatbek Baryktabasov, a businessman from eastern Karakol, was refused registration for the election, after authorities cited his alleged Kazakh citizenship. More than 100 Kyrgyz protesters demanding his registration subsequently stormed <b>Bishkek's</b> main government building, occupying it for several hours.|$|R
25|$|Riot police {{clashed with}} protesters in <b>Bishkek</b> in May during demonstrations {{in support of}} Beknazarov.

This was again repeated in November of the same year when scores were arrested as the opposition marched on the capital. Protests continued, albeit on a smaller scale, at various points over the next few years.|$|E
25|$|In Kyrgyzstan, {{transhumance}} practices, {{which never}} died {{out during the}} Soviet period, have undergone a resurgence in the difficult economic times following independence in 1991. Transhumance is integral to Kyrgyz national culture. The people use a wool felt tent, known as the yurt or jailoo, while living on these summer pastures. It is symbolised on their national flag. Those shepherds prize a fermented drink made from mare's milk, known as the kumis. A tool used in its production is the namesake for <b>Bishkek,</b> the country's capital city.|$|E
25|$|In Kyrgyzstan, the {{population}} has remained roughly stable {{over the past three}} censuses: 18,355 (1989), 19,784 (1999), and 17,299 (2009). This contrasts sharply with other non-indigenous groups such as Germans, many of whom migrated to Germany after the breakup of the Soviet Union. South Korea never had any programme to promote return migration of their diaspora in Central Asia, unlike Germany. However, they have established organisations to promote Korean language and culture, such as the Korean Centre of Education which opened in <b>Bishkek</b> in 2001. South Korean Christian missionaries are also active in the country.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of 7 April {{a small group of}} protesters were arrested outside the {{headquarters}} of the Social Democratic Party in <b>Bishkek.</b> Hundreds of protesters then gathered.

The protest group, now numbering between three and five thousand, then moved towards the center of town and into Ala-Too Square, where gunshots and stun grenades could be heard, and protesters were seen fleeing.|$|E

In 1989 she was appointed as the Executive Secretary and later as the Chairwoman of the USSR UNESCO National Committee, and she also became member of the USSR Foreign Ministry's Board. In 1989 - 1992 she served as the Vice-President of the UNESCO Executive Council. By 1992, the now independent Kyrgyzstan was led by Askar Akayev, who chose her to be Minister of Foreign Affairs and Deputy Prime Minister, positions she held until later that year when she became her country's first ambassador to the USA and Canada (19921994). In May 1994 she was called back to her original post of Kyrgyz Minister of Foreign Affairs, remaining there for three years. From 1997 to 2002, she served as the first Kyrgyz ambassador to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

25|$|On 6 April 2010, a {{demonstration}} in Talas by opposition leaders protested against government corruption and increased living expenses. The protests turned violent and spread nationwide.

In response protesters took control over the internal security headquarters (former KGB headquarters) and a state TV channel in the capital, <b>Bishkek.</b> Reports by Kyrgyzstan government officials indicated that 88 {{people were killed and}} 458 hospitalized in bloody clashes with police in the capital.

Witnesses reported that both protesters and riot police were wounded during the clashes, and at least forty-one protesters were killed. A state of emergency was declared, as well as a curfew from 10pm to 6am.|$|E
