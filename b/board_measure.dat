50|$|For example, Michael Perelman {{has argued}} in his 1989 book Keynes, Investment Theory and the Economic Slowdown: The Role of Replacement Investment and q-Ratios that the US Federal Reserve <b>Board</b> <b>measure</b> {{is just not}} very revealing.

5000|$|Following an October 2016 Cook County <b>Board</b> <b>measure</b> to {{gradually}} increase the county minimum wage to $13, many suburban municipalities passed measures overriding the wage hike {{just days before}} the first incremental increase to $10 on Saturday, July 1, 2017. Hagerty called an emergency meeting of the Evanston City Council on Friday, June 30 in order to give Evanston an opportunity to temporarily do the same. The announcement was met with criticism from local leaders, including City Clerk Devon Reid, who stated that a minimum wage increase was not a [...] "bona fide emergency" [...] and therefore did not qualify for an impromptu emergency meeting under the Illinois Open Meetings Act. Further, Hagerty was attacked for calling the minimum wage increase [...] "a fiscal danger to Evanston's businesses and the City of Evanston's future tax revenues," [...] even though he supported such an increase during his campaign. At the emergency meeting, Hagerty and members of the Council announced that a vote on the override measure would not take place, expressing support for the wage increase.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the relation between}} takeover performance and board share ownership in the acquiring company, for a sample of 363 UK takeovers completed in the period 1985 - 96. In investigating this relationship we {{pay particular attention to}} the structure of board shareholdings as well as their size. Thus in addition to the analysis of board holdings in total we analyse the separate impact of CEO shareholdings and of the pattern of non-executive and executive holdings within the board. In addition to our detailed examination of board holdings we assess the impact of non-board holdings. Our analysis controls for a variety of other influences on takeover outcomes including means of payment, acquirer size and market to book value, the relative size of the acquirer and the target, the nature of the bid in terms of hostility and industrial direction, and the pre-takeover performance of the acquiring company. We assess performance in terms of announcement returns, long run share returns and a portfolio of accounting measures. We find evidence that overall board ownership has a strong positive impact on long run share returns and a weak positive impact on operating performance. However, much stronger effects are found when the overall <b>board</b> <b>measure</b> i...|$|E
40|$|A {{growing body}} of {{research}} suggests that a strong and vigilant board can have a significant influence on the value-creating potential of medium-size companies by favouring change and innovation in strategic decision-making. Yet how best to conceptualize this relationship remains controversial in scholarly circles. The mainstream approach has been to argue for a direct relationship between board demography and company performance. In opposition stands a small but growing number of scholars who argue for a “behavioural approach” where boards’ ability to perform board tasks effectively – their actual behaviour – should be taken into account. Empirical studies comparing the two approaches are however surprisingly scarce. Based on this observation, the aim of the study is to test the mainstream board demography approach by examining the influence of boards of directors on CEOs’ commitment to take an entrepreneurial posture (EP). Both demographic and behavioural board measures are included in the model. Statistical analysis on a sample of 175 medium-size companies in the manufacturing sector gives ample support for the behavioural approach. The behavioural <b>board</b> <b>measure</b> – boards’ actual involvement in decision control – shows a positive and significant relationship with EP. On the other hand, neither board size nor the representation of non-executive directors, both commonly used measures in the demography approach, shows any significant association with EP. The study ends with a discussion of the results and presents suggestions for further research...|$|E
40|$|Background The Wii Balance Board has {{received}} increasing attention as a balance measurement tool; however {{its ability to}} prospectively predict falls is unknown. This exploratory study investigated {{the use of the}} Wii Balance Board and other clinical-based measures for prospectively predicting falls among community-dwelling older adults. Methods Seventy-three community-dwelling men and women, aged 60 - 85 years were followed-up over a year for falls. Standing balance was indexed by sway velocities measured using the Wii Balance Board interfaced with a laptop. Clinical-based measures included Short Physical Performance Battery, gait speed and Timed-Up-and-Go test. Multivariable regression analyses were used to assess the ability of the Wii Balance <b>Board</b> <b>measure</b> to complement the TUG test in fall screening. Findings Individually, the study found Wii Balance Board anteroposterior (odds ratio 1. 98, 95 % CI 1. 16 to 3. 40, P = 0. 01) and mediolateral (odds ratio 2. 80, 95 % CI 1. 10 to 7. 13, p = 0. 03) sway velocity measures predictive of prospective falls. However, when each velocity measure was adjusted with body mass index and Timed-Up-and-Go, only anteroposterior sway velocity was predictive of prospective falls (odds ratio 2. 21, 95 % CI 1. 18 to 4. 14). A faster anteroposterior velocity was associated with increased odds of falling. Area-under-the-curves for Wii Balance Board sway velocities were 0. 67 and 0. 71 for anteroposterior and mediolateral respectively. Interpretation The Wii Balance Board-derived anteroposterior sway velocity measure could complement existing clinical-based measures in predicting future falls among community-dwelling older adults. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{a qualitative}} study using {{the case study}} method of inquiry designed {{to learn more about}} what factors contribute to developing and maintaining a public governing board. This is important because public board development has been understudied in the higher education literature. This study reviews the corporate and private board performance literature and also identifies strategies that may be specific to improving higher public board performance. The focus of this study is Longwood University, a comprehensive master 2 ̆ 7 s degree granting institution. The study follows the professional development of the board and the leadership efforts of the president over an eleven year period. Presidential leadership, board culture, board education, and the interpersonal relations between the president, board chairperson (rector) and individual board members is explored. ^ The research questions framing this study include: What were the strategies used in developing the Longwood University Board of Visitors? In what way did Presidential leadership impact the board 2 ̆ 7 s evolution? How does the board maintain its values and focus on institutional mission given short term limits and frequent new appointees? What {{is the nature of the}} board 2 ̆ 7 s interaction with and relationship to faculty, staff and students? What factors do board members identify as contributing to believe contribute to their effectiveness? How does the <b>board</b> <b>measure</b> effectiveness? ^ This study found that some factors which have been identified in the literature; identifying a vision and common purpose and effectively communicating were important to public board performance. More specifically, this research indicates that sustained presidential leadership, the engagement of outside consultants, relationship building with the governor and the governors office and identifying board members unique talents are key to higher public board performance. ...|$|E
