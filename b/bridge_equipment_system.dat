40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{describe}} an implementation of audio conferencing using the ACTS T 1 -VSAT network. In particular, this implementation evaluates the use of the on-board switching capability of the satellite as a viable alternative for providing the multipoint connectivity normally provided by terrestrial audio <b>bridge</b> <b>equipment</b> The <b>system</b> that was implemented provides full mesh, full-duplex audio conferencing, with end-to-end voice paths between all participants requiring only a single hop (i. e. 250 msec. delay). Moreover, it addresses the lack of spontaneity in current systems by allowing a user to easily start a conference from any standard telephone handset connected to an ACTS earth station, and quickly add new members to the conference at any time using the 'hook flash' capability. No prior scheduling of resources is required and there is no central point of control, thereby providing the user with the spontaneity desired in audio conference control...|$|R

Lightweight can efficiently reduce the weight, promote structure optimization and improve {{performance of the}} river-crossing and military <b>bridge</b> <b>equipment.</b> After basic principles and main technologies of the lightweight application in the river-crossing and military <b>bridge</b> <b>equipment</b> components are summarized, strength design technologies for the lightweight of the equipment components are discussed, and simple shape components strength design criteria under tension / compression, bending, shearing and torsion are analyzed, which is extended to general lightweight components strength design criteria. On {{the basis of the}} lightweight design principles and strength design criteria, appropriate design methods and optimization strategies are selected, suitable lightweight high-strength material is chosen according to research and development demands, and the lightweight purpose for the river-crossing and military <b>bridge</b> <b>equipment</b> is realized...|$|R

For this, surplus Mulberry units came in useful for plugging the breaches.|$|R

40|$|Dynamic {{response}} {{of a light}} equipment item attached to a non-linear and torsionally coupled main system is evaluated under bi-directional earthquake excitation. To account for the effect of translations and torsion, each story of the building is modelled as three degrees-of-freedom (DOFs), with two DOFs for translation in two orthogonal directions and third DOF for torsion. The responses (relative displacement between the <b>equipment</b> <b>system</b> and {{the floor of the}} primary system on which the <b>equipment</b> <b>system</b> is mounted and absolute acceleration of the <b>equipment</b> <b>system</b> itself), are determined under random ground motion in two orthogonal directions, which is idealized as a stationary random process represented by a white noise excitation. The responses are obtained by time domain simulation procedure. The response behavior of the light equipment is examined under a set of parametric variations. These parameters include the uncoupled lateral frequency of the primary and the <b>equipment</b> <b>systems,</b> the ratio of uncoupled lateral to rotational frequencies of the primary system, eccentricity ratios of the primary and the <b>equipment</b> <b>systems</b> in X and Y directions, damping ratio of the primary and the <b>equipment</b> <b>systems</b> and the mass ratio of the two systems. Results of the study indicate that under some parametric conditions the responses of the <b>equipment</b> <b>system</b> are significantly affected by torsional coupling and non-linearity of the primary system. It is also observed that the responses of the <b>equipment</b> <b>system</b> can be alleviated by increasing the damping ratio of the <b>equipment</b> <b>system...</b>|$|R
