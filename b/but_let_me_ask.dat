The service of God is not a mere matter of ceremonies. Jesus Christ came to save you and me, not so much from punishment, as from sin itself. It is a great salvation. Those of you who may have been swimming with the current know and care nothing about the power of sin. If you think you do, my lads, turn up stream. Try to resist sin, and you'll learn something new. Only those who are made willing and strong by the Spirit of God can do it successfully. No doubt that remark will set adrift a lot o' thoughts and questions in your minds. To all of them I give you a short text as a good course to steer by: `Ask, and ye shall receive.' Ask light and ask wisdom.|$|R

The ASEP organization shows us how to be credible healthcare professionals in prescribing exercise medicine. OW TO BECOME an exercise physiologists isn’t complicated. <b>But,</b> first, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> the question: “Why {{do you want to}} be an exercise physiologist? ” Is it because you enjoy sports? Or, is it related to your passion for being physically fit? Of course anyone with an interest in sports and/or fitness doesn’t need an academic degree in exercise physiology to excel in either. Maybe, you are interested in exercise physiology because you have come to the understanding that what you will learn will help you work in the healthcare field? If this is the case, you are on the right track. It is true that exercise physiologists help clients and patients develop a more active lifestyle through a tailored exercise plan that will help to prevent or alleviate the symptoms of disease and/or disability. Exercise physiologists prescribe exercise medicine that is consistent with the prescriptive use of medications prescribed by medical doctors. Trainers and fitness instructors are not educated to treat heart disease, diabetes, cancer, arthritis, and emphysema with exercise. An exercise physiology degree and certification by the American Society of Exercise Physiologists (ASEP) identifies the exercise physiologist as a credible healthcare profession who is academically prepared to access a career in different hospital settings, fitness facilities, physical therapy centers, cardiac rehabilitation clinics, and wellness centers.

6000|$|I {{should like}} then {{to begin with}} two or three of the early ballads, and {{carefully}} analyse them with you. I am convinced that in them we may discover many of the great primary laws of composition, as well as the secrets of sublimity and pathos in their very simplest manifestations. It may be that there are some here to whom the study of old ballads may be a little distasteful, who are in an age when the only poetry which has charms is the subjective and self-conscious [...] "poetry of the heart"--to whom a stanza of [...] "Childe Harolde" [...] may seem worth all the ballads that ever were written: <b>but</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> remind them that woman is by her sex an educator, that every one here must expect, ay hope, to be employed at some time or other in training the minds of children; then <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> them to recall the years in which objective poems, those which dealt with events, ballads, fairy tales, down to nursery rhymes, were their favourite intellectual food, and <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> them whether it will not be worth while, {{for the sake of the}} children whom they may hereafter influence, to bestow a little thought on this earlier form of verse.|$|R

"Nothing is {{farther from}} my {{thoughts}} than chaffing you," [...] returned Westly, gently, [...] "and if {{the mere mention}} of God's name is religion, then you may claim {{to be one of the}} most religious men at the diggings, for you are constantly praying Him to curse people.

[...] "Where our {{efforts have been}} long-continued we have, through God's blessing, been successful, I {{sincerely}} believe, in bringing souls to the Saviour.

6000|$|Turnbull made {{a humorous}} grimace; then he said: [...] "We {{seem to be}} talking {{in a kind of}} shorthand; but I won't pretend not to {{understand}} you.

And you mean to say that if one may be disputed, so may the other. Well, let that pass for the moment. <b>But</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> you a question in turn. Did not this system of yours, which you swallowed whole, contain all sorts of things that were merely local, the respect for the chief of your clan, or such things; the village ghost, the family feud, or what not?
