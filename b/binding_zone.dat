40|$|Using {{crystalline}} hen's ovalbumin, {{an experiment}} on passive Schulz-Dale reaction in guinea pigs was done. The results are as follows: 1). After 24 hours of incubation period, the minimal sensitizing dose of antiserum which would cause passive Schulz-Dale reaction in guinea pigs is 0. 5 unit per 1 ml guinea pig blood. 2). As the dose of sensitizing antibody increases, the dose of antigen lessons, but the critical dose {{depends upon the}} individual animal. Furthermore no definite propotional relation exists between the two. 3). The minimal antigen dose on minimal sensitzing antibody dose is the <b>binding</b> <b>zone</b> equivalent dose by Ogata's method or the 1 / 4 of it. 4). The most appropriate antigen dose to cause anaphylaxis to the isolated guinea pig intestine which is passively sensitized is the <b>binding</b> <b>zone</b> equivalent dose of the antibody used in this reaction. 5). Comparing bovine serum which is complex antigen and crystalline hen's ovalbumin which is simple antigen, the minimal antibody sensitizing dose is extermely small in quantity in the latter when in passive Shulz-Dale reaction...|$|E

In the past decades, the mortality among patients with metastasis breast cancer has been reduced significantly via drug delivery by means of nanodiamond therapies, which are both biocompatible and scalable. In this study, we determined a theoretical pathway {{for the construction of a}} nanodiamond–tamoxifen complex that will act as a drug delivery vehicle for targeting tumor tissues of breast cancer. The tamoxifen pharmacophore was defined and the <b>binding</b> <b>zone</b> was identified for the electrostatic interaction between tamoxifen and a functionalized site of a nanodiamond particle allowing for attachment of the payload (this drug) to the surface of the nanodiamond particle. In addition, an analysis of the intermolecular interaction between the nanodiamond and tamoxifen was conducted, showing three hydrogen bonds complying fully with Lipinski’s rule of five, which states that a compound should have five or fewer hydrogen bonds to be permeating and easily absorbed by the body (qualitative prediction). All calculations were performed using the conceptual Density Functional Theory with the M 06 functional and the basis set 6 - 31 G(d). The solvent effect has been taken into account by an implicit model, the conductor like polarizable continuum model...|$|E
40|$|We use {{molecular}} dynamics simulations {{to investigate the}} tracer diffusion {{in a sea of}} polymers with specific <b>binding</b> <b>zones</b> for the tracer. These <b>binding</b> <b>zones</b> act as traps. Our simulations show that the tracer can undergo normal yet non-Gaussian diffusion under certain circumstances, e. g, when the polymers with traps are frozen in space and the volume fraction and the binding strength of the traps are moderate. In this case, as the tracer moves, it experiences a heterogeneous environment and exhibits confined continuous time random walk (CTRW) like motion resulting a non-Gaussian behavior. Also the long time dynamics becomes subdiffusive as the number or the binding strength of the traps increases. However, if the polymers are mobile then the tracer dynamics is Gaussian but could be normal or subdiffusive depending on the number and the binding strength of the traps. In addition, with increasing binding strength and the number of the polymer traps, the probability of the tracer being trapped increases. On the other hand, removing the <b>binding</b> <b>zones</b> does not result trapping, even at comparatively high crowding. Our simulations also show that the trapping probability increases with the increasing size of the tracer and for a bigger tracer with the frozen polymer background the dynamics is only weakly non-Gaussian but highly subdiffusive. Our observations are in the same spirit as found in many recent experiments on tracer diffusion in polymeric materials and questions the validity of Gaussian theory to describe diffusion in crowded environment in general...|$|R

40|$|Since 2002 {{there are}} <b>binding</b> <b>zones</b> in Burgenland {{where it is}} allowed by {{government}} to build wind power plants. This province {{was one of the}} first in Austria with such a comprehensive concept. This paper aims to evaluate the development process of the mentioned zones for the use of wind energy. The focus lies on the discussion process between the provincial government of Burgenland and the governing mayors of the affected communities. The objective is to find out how the zones were developed and which aspects (environmental, meteorological, economic or political) were crucial for the current position of the zones. The second part of the paper tries to find out if there were some conflicts during the development process. Expert interviews with the mayors showed divergent results. Some of them wanted a greater influence in the zoning process. Others are satisfied with the current situation. Towards the information of the government of Burgenland lots of mayors think that political and economic aspects played an important role in the zoning procedure. On the one hand the concept of planning wind power plants in Burgenland is a good instrument for a sustainable and professional long-term planning. On the other hand it became clear that the mayors did not have enough influence during the planning process in Burgenland. So they are not fully satisfied with the current position of the zones...|$|R
40|$|Cystic {{fibrosis}} {{results from}} mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) and ATP-regulated chloride channel. Here, we demonstrate that {{nucleoside diphosphate kinase}} B (NDPK-B, NM 23 -H 2) forms a functional complex with CFTR. In airway epithelia forskolin/IBMX significantly increases NDPK-B co-localisation with CFTR whereas PKA inhibitors attenuate complex formation. Furthermore, an NDPK-B derived peptide (but not its NDPK-A equivalent) disrupts the NDPK-B/CFTR complex in vitro (19 -mers comprising amino acids 36 - 54 from NDPK-B or NDPK-A). Overlay (Far-Western) and Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) analysis both demonstrate that NDPK-B binds CFTR within its first nucleotide binding domain (NBD 1, CFTR amino acids 351 - 727). Analysis of chloride currents reflective of CFTR or outwardly rectifying chloride channels (ORCC, DIDS-sensitive) showed that the 19 -mer NDPK-B peptide (but not its NDPK-A equivalent) reduced both chloride conductances. Additionally, the NDPK-B (but not NDPK-A) peptide also attenuated acetylcholine-induced intestinal short circuit currents. In silico analysis of the NBD 1 /NDPK-B complex reveals an extended interaction surface between the two proteins. This <b>binding</b> <b>zone</b> is also target of the 19 -mer NDPK-B peptide, thus confirming its capability to disrupt NDPK-B/CFTR complex. We propose that NDPK-B forms part of the complex that controls chloride currents in epithelia...|$|E

40|$|Kinesin {{stepping}} {{is thought}} to involve both concerted conformational changes and diffusive movement, but the relative roles played by these two processes are not clear. The neck linker docking model is widely accepted in the field, but {{the remainder of the}} step – diffusion of the tethered head to the next binding site – is often assumed to occur rapidly with little mechanical resistance. Here, we investigate the effect of tethering by the neck linker on the diffusive movement of the kinesin head, and focus on the predicted behavior of motors with naturally or artificially extended neck linker domains. The kinesin chemomechanical cycle was modeled using a discrete-state Markov chain to describe chemical transitions. Brownian dynamics were used to model the tethered diffusion of the free head, incorporating resistive forces from the neck linker and a position-dependent microtubule binding rate. The Brownian dynamics and chemomechanical cycle were coupled to model processive runs consisting of many 8 nm steps. Three mechanical models of the neck linker were investigated: Constant Stiffness (a simple spring), Increasing Stiffness (analogous to a Worm-Like Chain), and Reflecting (negligible stiffness up to a limiting contour length). Motor velocities and run lengths from simulated paths were compared to experimental results from Kinesin- 1 and a mutant containing an extended neck linker domain. When tethered by an increasingly stiff spring, the head is predicted to spend an unrealistically short amount of time within the <b>binding</b> <b>zone,</b> and extending the neck is predicted to increase both the velocity and processivity, contrary to experiments. These result...|$|E
40|$|Available at ScienceDirectMicroalgae are an {{enormous}} biological resource, representing {{one of the}} most promising sources for the development of new food products and applications. Pea protein/k-carrageenan/starch gels, interesting vegetarian alternatives to dairy desserts, served as model systems to study the addition of microalgal biomass, its effect, and subsequent rheological behaviour. Spirulina and Haematococcus gels presented a markedly different rheological behaviour compared to the control mixed biopolymer gelled system. The present goal is to clarify how these microalgae affect the gelation and interact with each biopolymer present in the complex mixed gel system. Hence, the aim of the present work is to study the effect of Spirulina and Haematococcus microalgal biomass addition on the rheological behaviour of pea protein, kcarrageenan and starch simple gels, as well as in pea protein/k-carrageenan and pea protein/starch systems. The gelation process was monitored in-situ through dynamic oscillatory measurements (temperature, time and frequency sweep tests) for a 24 h maturation period, and rheological results were supported with fluorescence optical microscopy observations. The addition of Spirulina and Haematococcus to biopolymer gelled systems induced significant changes in the gels’ rheological behaviour and microstructure. In general, it was observed that the gelling mechanism is ruled by the biopolymers, while microalgae seem to be embedded in the gel network acting as active particle fillers. The addition of Haematococcus resulted in more structured gels in comparison to the control and Spirulina systems. In the case of k-carrageenan gels, both microalgae induced a large increase in the rheological parameters, which should be related to the high ionic content of microalgal biomass. Spirulina addition on starch systems promoted a decrease in the gels’ rheological parameters. This should be related to the starch gelatinization process, probably by competing for water <b>binding</b> <b>zones</b> during the granules’ hydration proces...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability to}} form {{associations}} between {{a multitude of}} events {{is the hallmark of}} episodic memory. Computational models have espoused the importance of the hippocampus as convergence <b>zone,</b> <b>binding</b> different aspects of an episode into a coherent representation, by integrating information from multiple brain regions. However, evidence for this long-held hypothesis is limited, since previous work has largely focused on representational and network properties of the hippocampus in isolation. Here we identify the hippocampus as mnemonic convergence zone, using a combination of multivariate pattern and graph-theoretical network analyses of functional magnetic resonance imaging data from humans performing an associative memory task. We observe overlap of conjunctive coding and hub-like network attributes in the hippocampus. These results provide evidence for mnemonic convergence in the hippocampus, underlying the integration of distributed information into episodic memory representations...|$|R
40|$|In adult cats, local {{injection}} of kainic acid (KA) in the inferior olive (IO) of one side, {{from which the}} crossed olivocerebellar projection originates, produced asymmetric postural and motor deficits, attributed to selective damage of the olivary neurons. Since aspartate {{is one of the}} putative transmitters of the olivocerebellar fibers, experiments were performed to find out whether 6 - 8 days after {{injection of}} KA within the IO of one side produced changes in aspartate receptors <b>binding</b> in different <b>zones</b> of the cerebellar cortex. In particular, binding in the contralateral zones of the cerebellar cortex was referred to proteins contained in membrane suspensions and compared with the control values obtained in the same experiments from the ipsilateral zones. Binding of L-[3 H] aspartate decreased on the average to 53. 4 % of the control value in the medial zone and to 86. 1 % of the control value in the intermediate and lateral zones of the cerebellar cortex. This reduction varied in different experiments according {{to the side of the}} injection, in agreement with the well known pattern of regional distribution of the olivocerebellar projection within the cerebellar cortex. These findings favour aspartate as the putative neurotransmitter of the climbing fibers. The demonstration that binding of aspartate decreased in the cerebellar cortex of one side, 6 - 8 days after injection of KA in the corresponding IO, indicates that plastic events occur at this level following destruction of the olivocerebellar pathway. In particular, the reduced binding can be attributed either to a decrease in number of the postsynaptic receptor sites for aspartate or to a decreased affinity of this amino acid for the corresponding receptors. These findings, however, do not exclude that an hypersensitivity by denervation may occur at the level of individual Purkinje cells when they are deprived of the climbing fibers input. In order to answer this question further experiments are required to find out how the binding for aspartate is modified at increasing time intervals after the olivary lesion...|$|R

40|$|After injecting {{intravenously}} {{an appropriate}} {{dose of the}} antigen serum calculated from the <b>binding</b> <b>zone</b> and the blood volume by Ogata's antibody dilution method to 23 dogs sensitized with bovine serum, {{it was possible to}} bring about the maximum fall of blood pressure well over 80 per cent (average, 88. 8 per cent) within 30 minutes. In the case of other 21 sensitized dogs given intravenous injection of 10 mg/kg Benadryl 30 minutes prior to the reinjection, the maximum fall of blood pressure in 1 - 79 per cent (average, 43 per cent) was elicited after injecting the same dose of the antigen; and in a few instances the fall of blood pressure was practically protected. Such a suppressive effect of Benadryl was evidently more marked than the effect on the blood pressure fall induced by histamine. In Benadryl-treated dogs, a rise of the portal pressure in anaphylaxis was slower and milder although the inhibition of the elevation by histamine was more complete. Benadryl in anaphylaxis showed a more incomplete inhibition on the acceleration of the lymph flow from the thoracic duct and on the increase in protein of the lymph than that on the similar changes induced by histamine. The duration of incoagulation of the lymph in anaphylaxis was shortened in Benadryl-treated dogs. When Benadryl was added to antibody serum in vitro or in vivo (by intravenous injection), the precipitin reaction (by the method of diluting antibody) was suppressed. In the case of sensitized dogs previously injected with Benadryl, after antigen reinjection a considerable amount of antibody (precipitin) not consumed in reaction remained in circulating blood, gradually decreasing up to 48 hours later; whereas in unprotected dogs precipitin was found to have disappeared promptly after the reinjection. These findings indicate that Benadryl inhibits the union of antigen and antibody through some reversible means. Consequently, it appears that this anti-anaphylactic effect of Benadryl observed in dogs is caused not solely by the counteraction against histamine being released. The fact that Benadryl has only shown a much weaker inhibition on the congestion of the liver as reflected by the increase in portal pressure and thoracic lymph flow than that on the fall of arterial pressure suggests that the sluice reaction of hepatic vein is caused by "intrinsic histamine" released and/or some smooth muscle stimulating factors other than histamine...|$|E
40|$|Alpha-helical coiled-coils {{are common}} protein {{structural}} motifs with varied mechanical roles, such as, tropomyosin in muscle contraction or neck-stalks of kinesins and myosins, in motor proteins. Using computer simulations, we characterized elastic properties of coiled-coils both, globally and locally. Normal mode analysis for global elastic properties revealed a buckling instability due to inherently present weak non-bonded forces. We characterized this using a critical buckling length (lc). For coiled-coils, lc was {{significantly less than}} their persistence length thereby governing the filament conformation. We also found that mutations to the hydrophobic residues at the knob-into-hole interface affect elasticity of coiled-coils significantly. We built a flexibility map of tropomyosin using a local fluctuation analysis and found regional variations in flexibilities due to such breaks in the knob-into-hole packing. Overall, flexibility varies by more than twofold and increases towards the C-terminal region of the molecule. Actin <b>binding</b> sites in <b>zones</b> and broken core regions due to acidic residues at the hydrophobic face such as, the Asp 137 and the Glu 218, {{are found to be}} the most labile with moduli for splay and broad face bending as 70 nm and 116 nm, respectively. Such variations in flexibility could be relevant to the tropomyosin function, especially for moving across the non-uniform surface of F-actin to regulate myosin binding. Non-claret disjunction (Ncd), is a Kinesin- 14 family protein that walks to the microtubule's minus end. Although available structures show its alpha-helical coiled-coil neck in either pre- or post-stroke orientations, {{little is known about the}} transition between these two states. Using a combination of molecular dynamics simulations and structural analyses, we find that the neck travel is a guided diffusion involving sequential intermediate contacts with the motor head. The post-stroke is at a higher free-energy minimum than the pre-stroke. The importance of intermediate contacts correlates with the existing motility data including those of mutant Ncds and other members of the kinesin- 14 family. While the forward motion has a ~ 4. 5 kBT (kB: Boltzmann constant, T = 300 K) free energy barrier, recovery stroke goes nearly downhill in free energy. The hysteresis in forward and reverse neck motion energetics arises from the mechanical compliance of the protein, and together with guided diffusion, it may be key for the directed motility of Ncd. Although it is known that neighboring Ncds on a microtubule (MT) have an attractive interaction and a group of Ncds act cooperatively, the physical basis of neither this attraction nor the cooperativity is known. From structural analysis of Ncd neighbors on an MT lattice we find that steric hindrances between the coiled-coil neck-stalks of longitudinal neighbors drive synchrony among a group of Ncds on a single protofilament. Across lateral dimers, surface loop L 2 of the motor-head (MH) that is not bound to the MT (unbound-MH) in a pre-stroke dimer, is seen to have strong attraction to the nucleotide pocket in the MH that is bound to MT (bound-MH) of its off-axis neighbor. Such an attraction will however impede the motility in both the dimers. We hence propose rules that drive motor binding to an MT site in the presence of immediate neighbors such that motility of the group is not compromised. The unbound-MH, whose role in the walking step of an Ncd was unclear, is thus seen to regulate MT decoration...|$|R
