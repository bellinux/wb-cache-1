500|$|Later in 1802, Francis Jeffrey, {{editor of}} the Edinburgh Review, {{submitted}} a review on Thalaba. In the October 1802 edition, he claimed that Southey [...] "belongs to a sect of poets, that has established itself in this country within these ten or twelve years, and is looked upon, we believe, {{as one of its}} chief champions and apostles... As Mr Southey is the first author, of this persuasion, that has yet been brought before us for judgment, we cannot discharge our inquisitorial office conscientiously, without premising a few words upon the nature and tendency of the tenets he has helped to promulgate. The disciples of this school boast much of its originality." [...] This led to a discussion of Southey's flaws: [...] "Originality, however, we are persuaded, is rare than mere alteration... That our new poets have abandoned the old models, may certainly be admitted; <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> been able to discover that they have yet created any model of their own." [...] He continued to discuss the flaws of the British Romantic poets before returning to Thalaba when he argued, [...] "The subject of this poem is almost as ill chosen as the diction; and the conduct of the fable as disorderly as the versification... From this little sketch of the story, our readers will easily perceive, that it consists altogether of the most wild and extravagant fictions, and openly sets nature and probability at defiance. In its action it is not an imitation of anything; and excludes all rational criticism, as to the choice and succession of its incidents." ...|$|E

An army helicopter arrived to survey the crash site at 10:30 local time (04:30 UTC) but was not able to land. All 152 passengers have been confirmed dead.

2500|$|The Nation of Islam {{teaches that}} black people are the {{aboriginal}} people and that all other people come from them. Louis Farrakhan has stated [...] "If {{you look at the}} human family—now, I'm talking about black, brown, red, yellow and white—we all seem to be frozen on a subhuman level of existence. In Islam and, I believe, in development. But when moral consciousness comes and we have a self-accusing spirit, it is then that we become human beings.

2500|$|He also {{denied the}} {{existence}} of absolute space and time by saying in 1901: [...] "1. There is no absolute space, and we only conceive of relative motion and yet in most cases mechanical facts are enunciated {{as if there is}} an absolute space to which they can be referred. 2. There is no absolute time. When we say that two periods are equal, the statement has no meaning, and can only acquire a meaning by a convention. 3. Not only have we no direct intuition of the equality of two periods, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> even direct intuition of the simultaneity of two events occurring in two different places. I have explained this in an article entitled [...] "Mesure du Temps" [...] 4. Finally, is not our Euclidean geometry in itself only a kind of convention of language?" ...|$|E
2500|$|The Nation of Islam {{teaches that}} black people are the {{original}} people, and that all other people come from them. Farrakhan has stated, regarding spiritual ascension, [...] "If {{you look at the}} human family—now, I'm talking about black, brown, red, yellow and white—we all seem to be frozen on a subhuman level of existence. In Islam and, I believe, in Christian theology and Jewish theology as well, there are three stages of human development. The first stage is called the animalistic stage of development. But when we submit to animal passions, then we can do evil things to one another in that animalistic stage of development. But when moral consciousness comes and we have a self-accusing spirit, it is then that we become human beings. Right now, we have the potential for humanity, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> reached that potential, because we are functioning on the animalistic plane of existence." ...|$|E
