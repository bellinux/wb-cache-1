The <b>walking</b> <b>frame</b> communication devices have bi-directional exchange of the measured parameters between <b>walking</b> <b>frames.</b> USE - Walking frame system for analysis of movement of user for therapy of illnesses within lower range of human body (Claimed). ADVANTAGE - The <b>walking</b> <b>frame</b> communication devices have bi-directional exchange of the measured parameters between <b>walking</b> <b>frames,</b> and hence ensures reduced error rate for effective observation of the course of motion...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Biomechanical {{tools were}} used to assess {{stability}} for 11 patients who, following the surgical amputation of one lower limb, required the assistance of a <b>walking</b> <b>frame</b> to ambulate. The Walker Tipping Index (WTI), as derived from the forces applied to the <b>walking</b> <b>frame,</b> was developed specifically for this study {{to examine the relationship between}} stability and <b>walking</b> <b>frame</b> height during ambulation. How-ever, the WTI may be useful as a criterion of stability to assist clinicians in their evaluation of walker use in a variety of patient populations. Walker stability was examined as subjects, wearing their prostheses, completed 30 -sec walking trials in each of the normal, high, and low <b>walking</b> <b>frame</b> height conditions. Adjusting the height of the walker to one setting (3 cm) above or below normal appears to redistribute the load of walking between the upper and lower extremities without adversely affecting stability...|$|R

40|$|Our {{examination}} {{project has}} been to develop today’s existing <b>walking</b> <b>frames</b> and make them more exiting and user friendly for tomorrow’s users. The use of a <b>walking</b> <b>frame</b> today {{makes it easier for}} a person with a movement difficulty in different extent. It makes it easier with their living condition and the user get a more movement easier life where they can take care of the daily chores without any help from the society or the family members. With our product we get a product that not only makes it easier for the user to get out and get forward. We help the user to get forward where they often would have difficulties to get forward. An example is where its more steeper parts where it could be more difficult to get up or down and even with more difficult foundation due to bad weather. Our electrical motor driven wheel we have attached to the <b>walking</b> <b>frame</b> makes it easier at exactly this kind of situations. We have installed the wheel so it could either level up or down to have the option to walk around in the regular way. Plans on further development and manufacture of our prototype are in remembrance...|$|R

40|$|Whereas {{walking for}} {{paraplegic}} patients {{is now a}} routine clinical option, ambulation for heavily handicapped cerebral palsy patients is less well established. There are good reasons for supposing that therapeutic benefits similar to that achieved with paraplegic patients are possible for this group. However, the biomechanical problems which must be overcome are different {{and in many ways}} more difficult to address. The most important factors are identified as appropriate truncal support, control of abduction/adduction, rotation and flexion range at the hip, and of knee flexion. A means of applying these controls is described as being a combination of a <b>walking</b> <b>frame</b> and orthosis. The special <b>walking</b> <b>frame</b> provides adjustable support at thoracic, abdominal and sacral levels and incorporates castor steering and upper limb support. Controls on lower limb movements are applied through a special orthosis which has a readily available variation of specification to accommodate the wide range of conditions met in cerebral palsy. Practical application of a prototype system has shown that it can enable patients to walk unaided. However, in most cases it was used indoors only. Evaluation of the experience in applying the system has enabled the fundamental principles to permit more practical applications to be defined. All correspondence to be addressed t...|$|R
