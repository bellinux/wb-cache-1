5|$|In 2016, {{three new}} major {{metabolites}} of <b>bupropion,</b> all formed exclusively by CYP2C19, were identified. These include 4'-OH-bupropion, erythro-4'-OH-hydrobupropion and threo-4'-OH-hydrobupropion, and represent 24% of {{a dose of}} <b>bupropion</b> excreted in urine. For comparison, <b>bupropion</b> and its three previously known primary metabolites, hydroxybupropion, threohydrobupropion, and erythrohydrobupropion represent 23% of a dose of <b>bupropion</b> excreted in urine.|$|E
5|$|The {{next most}} common use is {{as an aid}} for smoking cessation. <b>Bupropion</b> reduces the {{severity}} of nicotine cravings and withdrawal symptoms. <b>Bupropion</b> is helpful for smoking cessation in smokers with no history of depression; thus, the effectiveness of <b>bupropion</b> is not due to its antidepressant effect. A typical <b>bupropion</b> treatment course lasts up to twelve weeks, with people halting the use of tobacco about ten days into the course. <b>Bupropion</b> approximately doubles the chance of quitting smoking successfully. The effectiveness of <b>bupropion</b> is comparable to nicotine replacement therapy, but less effective than varenicline.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{preclinical}} {{research with}} animal and human proteins, <b>bupropion</b> {{has been characterized}} as a weak norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI). It has also been found {{to act as a}} releasing agent of dopamine and norepinephrine (NDRA), similarly to other cathinones. However, when ingested orally by humans, <b>bupropion</b> is extensively converted in the body into several active metabolites with differing activities and influences on the effects of the drug during first-pass metabolism. These metabolites are present in much higher concentrations in the body compared to <b>bupropion</b> itself. The most important example is the major metabolite of <b>bupropion,</b> hydroxybupropion, a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (and likely releasing agent) and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) antagonist that lacks significant dopaminergic actions, and which, with oral <b>bupropion</b> treatment, can reach area under the curve (AUC) plasma concentrations that are as much as 16–20times greater than those of <b>bupropion</b> itself. Hence, the effects of <b>bupropion</b> cannot be understood unless its metabolism is also considered.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bupropion</b> is {{also known}} {{to act as a}} non-competitive {{antagonist}} of the α3β2, α3β4, α4β2, and, very weakly, α7 nACh receptors, and these actions appear to be importantly involved in its beneficial properties not only in smoking cessation, but in depression as well. The metabolites of <b>bupropion</b> also act as non-competitive antagonists of these nACh receptors, and hydroxybupropion is even more potent in comparison. At therapeutically-relevant concentrations <b>bupropion</b> and hydroxybupropion act as negative allosteric modulators of the serotonin 5-HT3A receptor. Pharmacological data on <b>bupropion</b> and its metabolites are shown in the table. <b>Bupropion</b> is known to weakly inhibit the α1 adrenergic receptor, with a 14% potency of its dopamine uptake inhibition, and the H1 receptor, with a 9% potency.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bupropion</b> {{is known}} to affect several {{different}} biological targets. It often {{is described as a}} norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI), and is also a nicotinic antagonist. However, <b>bupropion</b> {{does not appear to have}} significant dopaminergic actions in humans under normal clinical circumstances. Chemically, <b>bupropion</b> belongs to the class of aminoketones and is similar in structure to stimulants such as cathinone and amfepramone, and to phenethylamines in general.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bupropion</b> is metabolized to hydroxybupropion by CYP2B6, an isozyme of the {{cytochrome}} P450 system. Alcohol causes {{an increase}} of CYP2B6 in the liver, and persons {{with a history of}} alcohol use metabolize <b>bupropion</b> faster. <b>Bupropion</b> is metabolized to threo-hydrobupropion via cortisone reductase. The metabolic pathway responsible for the creation of erythro-hydrobupropion remains elusive.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bupropion</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely {{prescribed}} antidepressants, and the available evidence indicates that it is effective in clinical depression — as effective as several other widely prescribed drugs, including fluoxetine (Prozac) and paroxetine (Paxil), although trends favoring the efficacy of escitalopram (Lexapro), sertraline (Zoloft) and venlafaxine (Effexor) over <b>bupropion</b> have been observed. Mirtazapine (Remeron), on the other hand is significantly more effective than <b>bupropion.</b> <b>Bupropion</b> has several features that distinguish it from other antidepressants: for instance, unlike the majority of antidepressants, it does not usually cause sexual dysfunction. <b>Bupropion</b> treatment also is not associated with the sleepiness or weight gain that may be produced by other antidepressants.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bupropion</b> is the International Nonproprietary Name (INN) and British Approved Name (BAN) while <b>bupropion</b> {{hydrochloride}} is the United States Adopted Name (USAN). Amfebutamone was {{the former}} INN.|$|E
5|$|Several {{other uses}} have been {{researched}} for <b>bupropion.</b> There has been controversy {{about whether it}} is useful to add an antidepressant such as <b>bupropion</b> to a mood stabilizer in people with bipolar depression, but recent reviews have concluded that <b>bupropion</b> in this situation does no significant harm and may sometimes give significant benefit. <b>Bupropion</b> has shown no effectiveness in the treatment of cocaine dependence, but there is weak evidence that it may be useful in treating methamphetamine dependence. Based on studies indicating that <b>bupropion</b> lowers the level of the inflammatory mediator TNF-alpha, there have been suggestions that it might be useful in treating inflammatory bowel disease or other autoimmune conditions, but very little clinical evidence is available. Bupropion—like other antidepressants, with the exception of duloxetine (Cymbalta)—is not effective in treating chronic low back pain. It does, however, show some promise in the treatment of neuropathic pain.|$|E
5|$|Since <b>bupropion</b> is metabolized to hydroxybupropion by the CYP2B6 enzyme, drug {{interactions}} with CYP2B6 inhibitors are possible: this includes medications like paroxetine, sertraline, fluoxetine, diazepam, clopidogrel, and orphenadrine. The expected {{result is the}} increase of <b>bupropion</b> and decrease of hydroxybupropion blood concentration. The reverse effect (decrease of <b>bupropion</b> and increase of hydroxybupropion) can be expected with CYP2B6 inducers, such as carbamazepine, clotrimazole, rifampicin, ritonavir, St John's wort, phenobarbital, phenytoin and others. Conversely, because <b>bupropion</b> is itself a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6 (Ki = 21μM), as is its active metabolite, hydroxybupropion (Ki = 13.3μM), it can slow the clearance of other drugs metabolized by this enzyme. As an example, the ratio of dextromethorphan (a drug that is mainly metabolized by CYP2D6) to its major metabolite dextrorphan increased approximately 35-fold when it was administered to people being treated with 300mg/day <b>bupropion,</b> indicative of a major drug interaction with a common over-the-counter medicine.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bupropion</b> is a {{substituted}} cathinone. It is synthesized in two chemical steps {{starting from}} 3'-chloro-propiophenone. The alpha position {{adjacent to the}} ketone is first brominated followed by nucleophilic displacement of the resulting alpha-bromoketone with t-butylamine and treated with hydrochloric acid to give <b>bupropion</b> as the hydrochloride salt in 75–85% overall yield.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bupropion</b> is metabolized in {{the liver}} by the {{cytochrome}} P450 isoenzyme CYP2B6. It has several active metabolites: R,R-hydroxybupropion, S,S-hydroxybupropion, threo-hydrobupropion and erythro-hydrobupropion, which are further metabolized to inactive metabolites and eliminated through excretion into the urine. Both <b>bupropion</b> and its primary metabolite hydroxybupropion act {{in the liver}} as potent inhibitors of the enzyme CYP2D6, which metabolizes not only <b>bupropion</b> itself but also {{a variety of other}} drugs and biologically active substances. This mechanism creates the potential for a variety of drug interactions.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bupropion</b> {{is one of}} few {{antidepressants}} {{that does}} not cause sexual dysfunction. A range of studies demonstrate that <b>bupropion</b> not only produces fewer sexual side effects than other antidepressants, but can actually help to alleviate sexual dysfunction. According to a survey of psychiatrists, it is the drug of choice {{for the treatment of}} SSRI-induced sexual dysfunction, although this is not an indication approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. There have also been a few studies suggesting that <b>bupropion</b> can improve sexual function in women who are not depressed, if they have hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD).|$|E
5|$|<b>Bupropion</b> {{lowers the}} {{threshold}} for epileptic seizures, {{and therefore can}} potentially interact with other medications that also lower it, such as carbapenems, cholinergic agents, fluoroquinolones, interferons, chloroquine, mefloquine, lindane, theophylline, systemic corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone), and some tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., clomipramine). The prescribing information recommends minimizing the use of alcohol, since in rare cases <b>bupropion</b> reduces alcohol tolerance, and because the excessive use of alcohol may lower the seizure threshold. Also, <b>bupropion</b> {{should not be taken}} by individuals undergoing abrupt cessation of alcohol or benzodiazepine use.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, the FDA {{approved}} a sustained-release formulation of <b>bupropion</b> called Wellbutrin SR, {{intended to be}} taken twice a day (as compared with {{three times a day}} for immediate-release Wellbutrin). In 2003, the FDA {{approved a}}nother sustained-release formulation called Wellbutrin XL, intended for once-daily dosing. Wellbutrin SR and XL are available in generic form in the United States and Canada. In Canada, generic XR <b>bupropion</b> is distributed by Mylan. In 1997, <b>bupropion</b> was approved by the FDA for use as a smoking cessation aid under the name Zyban. In 2006, Wellbutrin XL was similarly approved as a treatment for seasonal affective disorder.|$|E
5|$|In Australia and the UK smoking {{cessation}} {{is the only}} licensed use of <b>bupropion.</b>|$|E
5|$|In France, {{marketing}} authorization {{was granted}} for Zyban on 3 August 2001, {{with a maximum}} daily dose of 300mg; only sustained-release <b>bupropion</b> is available, and only as a smoking cessation aid. <b>Bupropion</b> was granted a licence for use in adults with major depression in the Netherlands in early 2007, with GlaxoSmithKline expecting subsequent approval in other European countries.|$|E
5|$|In {{depressed}} {{people who}} experience symptoms of sleepiness and fatigue, <b>bupropion</b> {{has been found}} to be more effective than selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in alleviating these symptoms. There appears to be a modest advantage for the SSRIs over <b>bupropion</b> in the treatment of anxious depression.|$|E
5|$|Suicidal {{behavior}} {{is less of}} a concern when <b>bupropion</b> is prescribed for smoking cessation. According to a 2014 Cochrane review, while there is an association with suicide it is unclear if <b>bupropion</b> was the cause. In 2016 the FDA removed the black box warning about psychiatric problems when used for stopping smoking.|$|E
5|$|The {{metabolism}} of <b>bupropion</b> {{is highly}} variable: the effective doses of <b>bupropion</b> received by persons who ingest {{the same amount}} of the drug may differ by as much as 5.5times (with a half-life of 12–30hours), while the effective doses of hydroxybupropion may differ by as much as 7.5times (with a half-life of 15–25hours). Based on this, some researchers have advocated monitoring of the blood level of <b>bupropion</b> and hydroxybupropion. The half-lives of erythrohydrobupropion and threohydrobupropion are roughly 23–43hours and 24–50hours respectively.|$|E
5|$|The {{prescribing}} information {{notes that}} hypertension, sometimes severe, {{was observed in}} some people taking <b>bupropion,</b> both with and without pre-existing hypertension. The frequency of this adverse effect was under 1% and not significantly higher than found with placebo. A review of the available data carried out in 2008 indicated that <b>bupropion</b> is safe to use in people {{with a variety of}} serious cardiac conditions.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} {{reported}} cases of false-positive urine amphetamine tests in persons taking <b>bupropion.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Bupropion</b> is a {{medication}} primarily {{used as an}} antidepressant and smoking cessation aid. It is marketed as Wellbutrin and Zyban among other trade names. It {{is one of the}} most frequently prescribed antidepressants in the United States and Canada, although in many countries this is an off-label use. It is an effective antidepressant on its own, but is also popular as an add-on medication in cases of incomplete response to first-line SSRI antidepressants. <b>Bupropion</b> is taken in tablet form and is available only by prescription in most countries.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bupropion</b> is {{considered}} moderately dangerous in overdose. For significant overdoses, seizures {{have been reported}} in about a third of all cases; other serious effects include hallucinations, loss of consciousness, and abnormal heart rhythms. When <b>bupropion</b> was one of several kinds of pills taken in an overdose, fever, muscle rigidity, muscle damage, hypertension or hypotension, stupor, coma, and respiratory failure have been reported. While most people recover, some people have died, and before they died suffered multiple uncontrolled seizures and heart attacks.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bupropion</b> {{was invented}} by Nariman Mehta of Burroughs Wellcome (now GlaxoSmithKline) in 1969, and the US patent for it was granted in 1974. It was {{approved}} by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as an antidepressant on 30 December 1985, and marketed under the name Wellbutrin. However, a significant incidence of epileptic seizures at the originally recommended dosage caused the withdrawal of the drug in 1986. Subsequently, the risk of seizures was found to be highly dose-dependent, and <b>bupropion</b> was re-introduced to the market in 1989 with a lower maximum recommended daily dose.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bupropion,</b> {{when used}} for {{treating}} obesity {{over a period}} of 6 to 12 months, may result in weight loss of 2.7kg over placebo. This is not much different from the weight loss produced by several other medications, such as sibutramine or orlistat. It has been studied in combination with naltrexone. Concerns from <b>bupropion</b> include an increase in blood pressure and heart rate. In September 2014, a combination (bupropion/naltrexone) was approved by the US FDA for the treatment of obesity.|$|E
5|$|Caution {{should be}} {{observed}} when combining <b>bupropion</b> with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), {{as it may}} result in hypertensive crisis.|$|E
5|$|In April 2008, the FDA {{approved}} a formulation of <b>bupropion</b> as a hydrobromide salt {{instead of a}} hydrochloride salt, to be sold under the name Aplenzin by Sanofi-Aventis.|$|E
5|$|Animal studies {{indicate}} that administration of <b>bupropion</b> at less than the recommended therapeutic dose may actually enhance the rewarding properties of nicotine, i.e., low doses augment nicotine self-administration and high doses attenuate it.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bupropion</b> was {{approved}} by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), in 2006, for the prevention of seasonal affective disorder (SAD). In some countries (including Australia, New Zealand and the UK) depression treatment and SAD prevention are off-label uses.|$|E
5|$|Epileptic {{seizures}} are {{the most}} important adverse effect of <b>bupropion.</b> A high incidence of seizures was responsible for the temporary withdrawal of the drug from the market between 1986 and 1989. The risk of seizure is strongly dose-dependent, but also dependent on the preparation. The sustained-release preparation is associated with a seizure incidence of 0.1% at daily dosages of less than 300mg of <b>bupropion</b> and 0.4% at 300–400mg. The immediate release preparation is associated with a seizure incidence of 0.4% for dosages below 450mg; the incidence climbs to 5% for dosages between 450–600mg per day. For comparison, the incidence of unprovoked seizure in the general population is 0.07 to 0.09%, and the risk of seizure for a variety of other antidepressants is generally between 0.1 and 1.5% at recommended dosage levels. Clinical depression itself has been reported to increase the occurrence of seizures, and a study examining FDA clinical trial data has suggested that in most cases, low to moderate doses of antidepressants may not actually increase seizure risk at all. However, this study also found that <b>bupropion</b> and clomipramine were unique among antidepressants in that they were associated with increased incidence of seizures.|$|E
5|$|Suicidal {{thoughts}} and behaviors are rare in clinical trials, and the FDA requires all antidepressants, including <b>bupropion,</b> {{to carry a}} boxed warning stating that antidepressants may {{increase the risk of}} suicide in persons younger than 25. This warning is based on a statistical analysis conducted by the FDA which found a 2-fold increase in suicidal thought and behavior in children and adolescents, and 1.5-fold increase in the 18–24 age group. For this analysis the FDA combined the results of 295 trials of 11 antidepressants in order to obtain statistically significant results. Considered in isolation, <b>bupropion</b> was not statistically different from placebo.|$|E
5|$|The drug label advises that <b>bupropion</b> {{should not}} be {{prescribed}} to individuals with epilepsy or other conditions that lower the seizure threshold, such as anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, active brain tumors, or concurrent alcohol and/or benzodiazepine use and/or withdrawal. It should be avoided in individuals who are also taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). When switching from MAOIs to <b>bupropion,</b> {{it is important to}} include a washout period of about two weeks between the medications. The label recommends that caution should be exercised when treating people with liver damage, severe kidney disease, and severe hypertension, and in children, adolescents and young adults due to the increased risk of suicidal ideation.|$|E
5|$|According to surveys, the {{addition}} to a prescribed SSRI is a common strategy when people {{do not respond to}} the SSRI, even though this is not an officially approved indication. The addition of <b>bupropion</b> to an SSRI (most commonly fluoxetine or sertraline) may result in an improvement in some people who have an incomplete response to the first-line antidepressant.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bupropion</b> {{was first}} made by Nariman Mehta and {{patented}} by Burroughs Wellcome in 1969, which later {{became part of}} what is now GlaxoSmithKline. It was first approved for medical use in the United States in 1989. It was originally called by the generic name amfebutamone, before being renamed in 2000.|$|E
5|$|In a {{large-scale}} study of programs where <b>bupropion</b> {{was used for}} smoking cessation or treatment of depression, no withdrawal symptoms were observed. As of 2002 there were two case reports of people experiencing withdrawal symptoms when discontinuing buproprion taken to aid smoking cessation; the prescribing information states that dose tapering is not required when discontinuing treatment for smoking cessation.|$|E
