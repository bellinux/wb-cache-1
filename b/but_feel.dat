5|$|Hańska {{wrote to}} Balzac {{several times during}} 1832. On 7 November she posted a seven-page letter filled with praise and flattery:Your soul embraces centuries, Monsieur; its {{philosophical}} concepts {{appear to be the}} fruit of long study matured by time; yet I am told that you are still young. I would like to know you, <b>but</b> <b>feel</b> that I have no need to do so. I know you through my own spiritual instinct; I picture you in my own way and feel that were I to set eyes upon you I should exclaim, 'That is he!' Your outward semblance probably does not reveal your brilliant imagination; you have to be moved, the sacred fire of genius has to be lit, if you are to show yourself as you really are, and you are what I feel you to be—a man superior in his knowledge of the human heart.|$|E
25|$|The {{doctrines of}} papal primacy and papal {{supremacy}} {{are perhaps the}} greatest obstacles to ecumenical efforts between the Roman Catholic Church and the other Christian churches. Most Eastern Orthodox Christians, for example, would be quite willing to accord the Bishop of Rome the same respect, deference and authority as is accorded to any Eastern Orthodox patriarch, but resist granting him special authority over all Christians. Many Protestants are quite willing to grant the pope a position of special moral leadership, <b>but</b> <b>feel</b> that according any more formal authority to the pope than that would conflict with the Protestant principle of solus Christus, i.e., {{that there can be}} no intermediaries between a Christian and God except for Christ.|$|E
25|$|Some {{people with}} OCD perform {{compulsive}} rituals because they inexplicably {{feel they have}} to, while others act compulsively so as to mitigate the anxiety that stems from particular obsessive thoughts. The person might feel that these actions somehow either will prevent a dreaded event from occurring or will push the event from their thoughts. In any case, the individual's reasoning is so idiosyncratic or distorted that it results in significant distress for the individual with OCD or for those around them. Excessive skin picking, hair-pulling, nail biting and other body-focused repetitive behavior disorders are all on the obsessive–compulsive spectrum. Some individuals with OCD are aware that their behaviors are not rational, <b>but</b> <b>feel</b> compelled {{to follow through with}} them to fend off feelings of panic or dread.|$|E

500|$|O'Connor {{said he was}} {{confident}} Oxford would have won even without the clash. [...] Oxford Boat Club president Malcolm Howard remarked [...] "You cannot help <b>but</b> <b>feel</b> for the two-seat of Cambridge, it’s tough." [...] Cambridge Boat Club president Steve Dudek called it [...] "a frustrating way to lose... I would never wish that on anyone."

500|$|In a later publication, Peeters {{expressed}} a different view, stating that [...] "one cannot help <b>but</b> <b>feel</b> disappointed" [...] with Alph-Art. Similarly, Harry Thompson expressed {{the view that}} Hergé would never have completed the story, and that while [...] "many critics like to think... Tintin and Alph-Art was set to be Hergé's last great masterpiece", he disagreed, describing this as [...] "surely just wishful thinking". He added {{that it could be}} seen as [...] "a nostalgic, or regressive book, depending on your point of view." ...|$|E
500|$|Walpole added a {{preface to}} the poem reading: [...] "The {{following}} POEM came into my hands by Accident, if the general Approbation with which this little Piece has been spread, may be call'd by so slight a Term as Accident. It is the Approbation which makes it unnecessary {{for me to make}} any Apology but to the Author: As he cannot <b>but</b> <b>feel</b> some Satisfaction in having pleas'd so many Readers already, I flatter myself he will forgive my communicating that Pleasure to many more." ...|$|E

[...] The national government forced the local residents to pay restitution to those whose property had been damaged: the total eventually amounted to £23,000. However, the process took many years, and most residents received much less than the value of their property.|$|E
500|$|Review-aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes {{gives the}} film an {{approval}} rating of 78% based on 261 reviews, {{with an average}} score of 7.1/10. The site's consensus reads, [...] "It can't help <b>but</b> <b>feel</b> like the prelude it is, but Deathly Hallows: Part I is a beautifully filmed, emotionally satisfying penultimate installment for the Harry Potter series." [...] On Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating to reviews, the film has a score of 65 out of 100, based on 41 critics, indicating [...] "generally favourable reviews". On CinemaScore, audiences gave the film an average grade of [...] "A" [...] on an A+ to F scale.|$|E
500|$|Puck's {{rendition}} of [...] "Waiting for a Girl Like You" [...] was almost universally described as [...] "sweet". Flandez went further, and wrote [...] "he oozes sweet and sexy, and you can’t help <b>but</b> <b>feel</b> good", and Goldberg still further when she {{stated that it}} [...] "ends up {{being one of the}} episode’s—and season’s—sweetest moments thus far". West praised the [...] "lovely little guitar solo" [...] and gave the song a [...] "B"; Chaney bestowed the same grade and called it a [...] "cheesy moment" [...] but a [...] "nice job" [...] by Salling. Futterman commented that Puck got to [...] "showcase his nice falsetto".|$|E

500|$|With {{no return}} address, Balzac {{was left to}} reply in the Gazette de France, {{with the hope that}} she would see the notice. She did not, but wrote again in November: [...] "Your soul embraces centuries, monsieur; its {{philosophical}} concepts appear to be the fruit of long study matured by time; yet I am told you are still young. I would like to know you, <b>but</b> <b>feel</b> I have no need to do so.

500|$|The A.V. Club ranked Doctor Who the 25th best show of 2010, {{saying that}} it [...] "lacked a truly weak episode" [...] and {{highlighting}} [...] "The Time of Angels"/"Flesh and Stone", [...] "Vincent and the Doctor", and [...] "The Lodger" [...] as the best episodes. Digital Spy ranked the programme the third best of 2010, commenting that it [...] "gave us some terrific episodes— the beautifully tragic 'Vincent and the Doctor', the wonderfully-paced opener and the well-imagined finale ... but also the multi-colored monstrosity 'Victory of the Daleks'. Overall, a decent enough start for the new team, but with such a strong pedigree, we couldn't help <b>but</b> <b>feel</b> a little underwhelmed." ...|$|E
500|$|The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin {{said that}} the Jenna and Tracy subplot was not the most {{inspired}} idea, but admitted it introduced one of his [...] "favorite gags in 30 Rock history" [...] regarding two make-up artists giving Tracy a monster claw {{to use as a}} white hand when they ran out of white powder. Rabin called it a [...] "brilliant gag." [...] He was less enthusiastic with Winfrey in the episode, noting that her appearance [...] "was treated as such a seismic cultural event that tonight's episode couldn't help <b>but</b> <b>feel</b> like a letdown." [...] Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad wrote that [...] "the least effective plot" [...] in this episode was Jenna and Tracy's.|$|E

500|$|Before the film's release, reporters {{speculated that}} it would have a {{difficult}} run due to competition from DreamWorks' Shrek (a wholly CGI feature) and [...] (an action-adventure film from Paramount Pictures). Regarding the market's shift from traditional animation and competition with CGI films, Kirk Wise said, [...] "Any traditional animator, including myself, can't help <b>but</b> <b>feel</b> a twinge. I think it always comes down to story and character, and one form won't replace the other. Just like photography didn't replace painting. But maybe I'm blind to it." [...] Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly noted that CGI films (such as Shrek) were more likely to attract the teenage demographic typically not interested in animation, and called Atlantis a [...] "marketing and creative gamble".|$|E
500|$|Bell lauded the [...] "brilliant {{conversation}} between Quinn and Sue {{toward the end}} where Sue told Quinn that she admired her". Lynch though that Kurt was [...] "out of line" [...] when he [...] "declared Quinn didn't {{know what it was}} like to truly suffer". He noted that she was [...] "kicked out of her house and disowned by her father while pregnant" [...] and added, [...] "she's suffered plenty for a teenager". He said about the episode's final scene, which ended as the car Quinn was driving was about to be hit by a rapidly moving truck, [...] "you can't help <b>but</b> <b>feel</b> sucker-punched when something like this happens". Flandez called it a [...] "cowardly ending", but Canning praised the [...] "good cliffhanger", and the [...] "subtle enough" [...] storytelling that did not [...] "telegraph anything" [...] before the closing sequence.|$|E
500|$|Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal, {{pointed out}} that [...] "the truly amazing thing {{is that most of}} what happens to Peter Parker {{in the first half of}} the film has already {{happened}} in previous chapters of the Spidey saga", that [...] "what's old is old again." [...] However, Randy Myers from the San Jose Mercury News found it [...] "the best Spidey yet", describing it as [...] "strong, bold and well-acted." [...] He felt that a viewer couldn't help <b>but</b> <b>feel</b> déjà vu, but that the work shows greater [...] "dimension". Dana Stevens at Slate magazine believed that the film was an [...] "absolutely unnecessary" [...] retelling of the origin story, although it avoided [...] "the common comic-book adaptation trap of gloomy self-seriousness". Peter Travers of Rolling Stone also opined that the [...] "unnecessary" [...] reboot pulled stellar performances from Garfield and Stone and touches the heart.|$|E

500|$|Upon its release, [...] "Together When..." [...] {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} most music critics. Bradley Stern, head writer from MuuMuse, awarded the song {{a maximum of}} ten points and labelled {{it one of the}} best tracks on Guilty. He commented, [...] "Finally, a ballad with feeling!... Call me sadistic, but the best moments in an Ayumi song are the parts where it sounds like she’s about to break ("Memorial Address"). This song is full of those moments." [...] In a similar review, a staff member at Channel-Ai awarded it five stars out of five, and believed that the song is one [...] "of her strongest ballads". The reviewer further explained, [...] "The emotion within the ballad is so infectious that the audience cannot help <b>but</b> <b>feel</b> empathy towards Ayumi." [...] A staff member at CD Journal enjoyed the song, labeling it a [...] "beautiful performance" [...] by Hamasaki; the reviewer also complimented the instrumentation and production, and how it [...] "melted together comfortably".|$|E
500|$|This was {{followed}} by an October 1801 anonymous review in the Monthly Mirror that argued, [...] "It is a matter to be lamented, that, in times like the present, a work of letters can rarely be reviewed upon the ground of its own proper merits... In the consideration of this romance, the judicious critic cannot <b>but</b> <b>feel</b> that one rule of good writing has been studiously observed. His work will not incur the censure passed by the late Mr. Collins upon his Persian Eclogues, namely, that, from erroneous manners, they were 'Irish.'" [...] The review continued, [...] "He tells us it is metrical... He will excuse our ears, but we cannot agree with him. Among the sins of our youth, we, like him, have traded in desultory versification, but have long been brought back to lyrical rhyme, and heroic blank verse. The reasons are obvious... We recommend his beauties to the esteem, and his faults to the forgetfulness, of every reader. Upon the whole, he has our thanks for much amusement, and some information." ...|$|E

Anya asks Xander what she is supposed to do; he cannot answer. Willow changes her shirt again and Xander expresses his desire to find Glory and exact justice, then complains about Joyce's negligent doctors. Anya asks if they will see the body, then if the body will be cut open, and Willow responds angrily. Anya tearfully says she does not understand how to behave, or why Joyce cannot go back into her own body, unable to understand human death, she states that it is all [...] "stupid and mortal", and no one will tell her why things are happening. Xander puts his fist through the wall, making him bleed <b>but</b> <b>feel</b> oddly better. As the group leaves to visit Buffy at the hospital, Xander gets a parking ticket.|$|E
