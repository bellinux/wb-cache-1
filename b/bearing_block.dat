25|$|The bow drill {{consists}} of a <b>bearing</b> <b>block</b> or handhold, a spindle or drill, a hearth or fireboard, and a simple bow. Other early versions of mechanical drills include the pump drill and the hand drill.|$|E
25|$|The spindle, carved {{to reduce}} {{friction}} {{at one end}} and maximize it at the other, is held in a hole {{in the bottom of the}} <b>bearing</b> <b>block,</b> and at the other by the base board (which also is known variously as the hearth, hearth board, or fireboard). The string of the bow is wrapped once around it, so that it is tight enough not to slip during operation. A variation on this is called the Egyptian Bow Drill. It attaches the string by wrapping it around multiple times, or actually tying it to the drill or through a hole through the drill shaft, then wrapping it.|$|E

2500|$|The hearth and spindle {{can both}} be {{constructed}} from any medium-soft, dry, non-resinous wood, and work best when both {{are made from}} the same piece of wood; however, with practice almost any wood combination can be used provided the parts contain little or no resin or moisture. The most important factor is whether the wood is dry enough to ignite, as wet wood will not work; yucca, aspen, white cedar, basswood, buckeye and most willows all work very well. Combinations such as hazel and poplar also work well. The bow should be stiff but slightly limber and around {{the distance from the}} users armpit to their fingertips. The <b>bearing</b> <b>block</b> (handhold) can be made of anything that is harder than the spindle. Bone, antler, shell and stone work best, as they can be easily greased, do not create as much friction, and do not burn; however, hard woods such as maple and tulip and red cedar are quite serviceable and often easier to find and work. [...] Some effective materials used to grease the <b>bearing</b> <b>block</b> include sebum, animal and plant oils, or even moist vegetation.|$|E
2500|$|This {{bracketing}} system, being essential both structurally and esthetically, {{has been}} altered and refined many times {{since it was}} imported from China.

When it connects two brackets, it is instead called [...] Bearing blocks installed on top of corner posts are of necessity more complex and are called [...] because of how difficult they are to make.

2500|$|The {{hand drill}} {{is a similar}} tool, but uses a longer, thinner spindle; and instead of a <b>bearing</b> <b>block</b> and bow combination, the {{downward}} pressure and spinning is achieved by rubbing the hands together around the spindle. As the hands move downward to the base, where the drill is pinched and the hands are brought quickly to the top one at a time. This can be made unnecessary by cutting a nock {{at the top of}} the drill, tying a cord through this, and then putting your thumbs through loops in the cord. However, skilled operators can either maintain pressure with their hands almost stationary vertically; or, in a movement comparable to floating, can [...] "float" [...] their hands back to the top of the drill. There is a more limited choice of materials to use with this method, needing much softer materials, such as mullein, yucca, cattail, and root wood.|$|E
40|$|External {{gear pumps}} and motors, in their typical {{commercial}} design, {{are equipped with}} hydraulically balanced <b>bearing</b> <b>blocks,</b> which allow to maintain good volumetric efficiencies also when the pressure drop between the ports is high. The aim of this work is to analyze some geometrical aspects characterizing the <b>bearing</b> <b>blocks</b> design, evaluating their influence on the volumetric efficiency of the machine {{with the aid of}} a numerical model properly created. External gear pumps and motors operation behavior is strongly influenced by the volumetric efficiency; this parameter takes into account the leakages of fluid which typically affect the hydraulic machine operation and, together with the mechanical efficiency, determines its total efficiency and, consequently, has a great influence on power loss...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} some {{developments of}} a research activity regarding hydraulically balanced external gear pumps.

The effect of the running in process on the casing internal surface and on the pressure distribution in sealed spaces between teeth is also shown and discussed. At the end a numerical model useful in designing <b>bearing</b> <b>blocks</b> balancing surfaces is outlined.

5000|$|An early {{conception}} of chain {{used as a}} telescoping column instead a horizontal rammer was by Eldridge E. Long, who was awarded a US patent for his “Lifting Jack” in 1933, which he believed was “particularly adapted for use upon automobiles”. [...] It used a double chain configuration, each chain linking solid <b>bearing</b> <b>blocks</b> that were stacked to resist compressive loads. In 1951, Yaichi Hayakawa was awarded a US patent for his “Interlocking Chain Stanchion” which eliminated <b>bearing</b> <b>blocks</b> by integrating the compressive path of force into the interlocking links of two roller-like chains. [...] The zipper action of back-to-back interlocking chains provided guideless chain travel regardless of orientation and path of travel.|$|R

40|$|External {{gear pumps}} and motors are robust and low cost {{components}} and {{are widely used}} in industrial and mobile applications; nowadays however, optimal global efficiency represents a more crucial aspect to be considered when designing a hydraulic machine. For this reason, it becomes a primary necessity to investigate the phenomena which determine and affect the hydraulic machine total efficiency. In this work, the volumetric efficiency of external gear pumps is investigated {{by means of a}} mathematical model already presented in a previous paper and the results obtained are compared with experimental data. First of all, the mathematical model is briefly presented; then the predicted results are discussed considering the influence of the pump operating conditions. Moreover, the influence on the volumetric efficiency of the behaviour of the hydraulically balanced <b>bearing</b> <b>blocks,</b> and hence of the pump axial balance, is exposed. In particular, it is shown that the tilted position of the <b>bearing</b> <b>blocks</b> and the height of the lateral clearance can greatly affect the volumetric efficiency. The data coming from an experimental investigation carried out on commercial external gear pump units are then presented; both the volumetric and the mechanical efficiency have been measured. The comparison between the experimental data and the numerical results allows discussing the <b>bearing</b> <b>blocks</b> balancing behaviour during pump operation...|$|R
