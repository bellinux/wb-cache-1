40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new economical solution of robot control system for different sophisticated robot applications. The control system {{is based on}} PC controlled servo motor <b>control</b> <b>card</b> and an intelligent control software, which has been developed using high level graphical programming language (LabVIEW). The basic development is an interface software for making connection between the <b>control</b> <b>card</b> and LabVIEW. LabVIEW gives {{a wide range of}} opportunity of utilisation of the developed control system at different robot applications. This paper shows a complete solution of robot control system for a ZIM 15 (KUKA license) type 6 -axis robot. The DDA (Digital Differential Analysis) method and the closed loop control system of the servo motor <b>control</b> <b>card</b> are described.

At each control point, and at the Start and Finish too, the orienteer inserts the card into a battery-operated station. There are two principal types of these, SPORTIdent and EMIT although newer technologies are starting to emerge using RFID wristbands timing or QR barcode timing such as iOrienteering. The SPORTIdent <b>control</b> <b>card</b> is a small plastic stick ("e-card" [...] or [...] "e-punch', also [...] "dibber" [...] and [...] "fingerstick").
