500|$|The basidia (the spore-bearing cells) are 15–20 by 2.5–3.5µm, club-shaped, and clamped at the base. The spores are {{attached}} {{to the end of the}} basidia by four projections called sterigmata that are 1–3.5µm long. Cystidia are hyphal cells in the hymenium that do not produce basidiospores; they also make up the surfaces of the fruit body (the pelli or [...] "cuticles"). They are usually structurally distinct from the basidia, and their features may be used as microscopic characters to help distinguish and differentiate similar fungi. [...] The cheilocystidia are found on the gill edge; in P.stipticus they are narrowly club-shaped, cylindrical, spindle-shaped to [...] at the apex. They are also thin-walled, hyaline (translucent), abundant and crowded, and measure 17–45 by 3.5–6µm. The pleurocystidia, located on the gill face, are 17–40 by 3–4.5µm, spindle- or club-shaped, sometimes <b>bifurcate</b> at the apex, thin-walled, and hyaline.

500|$|Armillaria luteobubalina uses [...] "an elaborate, {{sophisticated}} aeration system" [...] {{that enables}} it to efficiently deliver oxygen into the rhizomorphs, helping it thrive in low-oxygen environments. When grown in culture, the mycelium develops into a continuous region of tissue with a perforated crust. This tissue is hydrophobic and resistant to becoming waterlogged. Rhizomorphs develop beneath clusters of so-called [...] "air-pores" [...] near the perforations. These gas spaces connect the atmosphere {{with the central}} canal of the rhizomorph, to facilitate diffusion of oxygen and satiate the organism's high oxygen requirement during growth. This aeration system {{is thought to be}} an important factor in the organism's pathogenicity, allowing it to grow on wet or waterlogged root surfaces and send hyphae or rhizomorphs into live roots or cut stumps, where conditions may be hypoxic. The rhizomorphs have a dichotomous branching pattern, so that they split or <b>bifurcate</b> at various intervals. Experiments and field observations have shown that this allows the fungus to be a more aggressive and virulent pathogen than Armillaria species whose rhizomorphs branch monopodially (where lateral branches grow from a main stem). Although the structure of A.luteobubalina rhizomorphs is specialised for spread in potentially anaerobic conditions, the soil mycelium is adaptive and can amplify the absorptive surface of peripheral hyphae in response to the presence of nutrient-rich soil.|$|E
500|$|Measuring [...] {{in length}} with a [...] {{wingspan}} and weighing around , the adult Australian raven is an all black-bird {{with a black}} beak, mouth and tongue and sturdy black or grey-black legs and feet. The tibia is fully feathered and the tarsus is long, and the feet large and strong. It has white irises. The plumage is glossy with a blue-purple to blue-green sheen, greenish over the ear coverts, depending on light. The underparts are not glossy. The Australian raven has throat feathers (hackles) that are [...] with rounded tips, while the other four species of Australian corvids have <b>bifurcate</b> tips, though this {{can be difficult to}} see in the field. The hackles are also longer than those of the other four species; when they are raised (such as when the bird is calling), they give the bird an unusual bearded appearance. The upper third of the upper mandible, including the nares and nasal groove, is covered with bristles, which can be up to [...] long. The heavy-set beak is tipped with a slight hook, and is longer than the bird's head. The wings are long and broad, with the longest of its ten primary feathers (usually the seventh but occasionally the eighth) almost reaching the end of the tail when the bird is at rest. The tail is rounded or wedge-shaped. The Australian raven can be distinguished from the two species of crow occurring in Australia by the grey base of the feathers, which is white in the latter species. The demarcation between pale and black regions on the feather is gradual in the ravens and sharply delineated in the crows. Feather bases are not normally visible when observing birds in the field, but can sometimes be seen on a windy day if the feathers are ruffled. Unlike the other four species, the Australian raven has a bare patch of skin under, and extending to beside, the bill. This can be hard to discern in the field. The three species of raven are more heavily set with a broader chest than the two crow species, with the forest raven the stockiest of all. Relative size of species is only useful when two species can be seen side by side, as the overlap in size is large and the difference in size small.|$|E

2500|$|Ojibwe {{understanding}} of kinship is complex, and {{includes not only}} the immediate family but also the extended family.

For example, ninooshenh is [...] "my mother's sister" [...] or [...] "my father's sister-in-law"—i.e., my parallel-aunt, but also [...] "my parent's female cross-cousin".

This paper {{considers}} {{the stability of}} positive steady-state so-lutions <b>bifurcating</b> from the trivial solution in a delayed Lotka-Volterra two-species predator-prey diffusion system with a discrete delay and sub-ject to the homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions on a general boun-ded open spatial domain with smooth boundary. The existence, unique-ness and asymptotic expressions of small positive steady-sate solutions <b>bifurcating</b> from the trivial solution are given by using the implicit func-tion theorem. By regarding the time delay as the bifurcation parameter and analyzing in detail the eigenvalue problems of system at the positive steady-state solutions, the asymptotic stability of <b>bifurcating</b> steady-state solutions is studied. It is demonstrated that the <b>bifurcating</b> steady-state solutions are asymptotically stable when the delay {{is less than a}} certain critical value and is unstable when the delay is greater than this critical value and the system under consideration can undergo a Hopf bifurcation at the <b>bifurcating</b> steady-state solutions when the delay crosses through a sequence of critical values. 1...|$|R
