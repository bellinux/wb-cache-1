500|$|The New York Times {{reported}} that in contrast to previous statements {{about the number of}} firings related to the scandal [...] "new internal documents show that the real number of people removed from their jobs is much smaller still: at most, three". The Department of Veterans Affairs did not dispute this number, but said that disciplinary action is being taken against over 100 other employees. Congressional Republicans were outraged. Representative Jeff Miller said. [...] "“Rather than disciplining bad employees, V.A. often just transfers them to other V.A. facilities or puts them on paid leave for months on end," [...] and [...] "“Everyone knows accountability is a major problem at the department." [...] Miller said that he would introduce new legislation to hasten the firing process. Raymond Kelley, legislative director for Veterans of Foreign Wars, said that “The government firing system is so cumbersome bad employees can continue to be paid for years,” and “We need to show them you can no longer hide just <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> government job, unclog the middle management that appears {{to be part of the}} problem and get the right people in those positions.” ...|$|E

2500|$|During his {{postponed}} trip to Venezuela, Humala {{was personally}} welcomed by Chavez at Miraflores Palace. He reiterated calls for regional integration saying [...] "As 200 years ago, when we fought colonialism, {{today we have}} common enemies like poverty, inequalities, drug trafficking and so many threats against our countries. I have come as a friend and a brother; and this brotherhood leads us to a similar future." [...] He also wished Chavez a recovery from his cancer treatment: [...] "We are giving you support, please count on our forces and the prayers of the Peruvian people, who want your recovery <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> mission to accomplish." [...] Humala also {{paid a visit to}} Simón Bolívar's birthplace house and met with officials at the headquarters of the Corporacion Andina de Fomento.|$|E

2500|$|Blackman {{attended}} a Baptist church during her teenage years, but became {{a follower of}} the Bahá'í Faith {{at the age of}} 18; she also started studying Kabbalah in the 2000s. Blackman cultivates spirituality in her musicianship. [...] "I believe that music is so sacred that once you're playing music you are doing the work of prayer, whether you're conscious of it or not, <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> focused intent", says Blackman. [...] "You transcend, because you're crossing barriers {{that a lot of people}} and even us as musicians don't normally venture to, because we don't think about it. When you can learn to move those energies, even if they're sad, into something that is of benefit, like focusing on bringing light to people who are listening, or just to the universe in general, then you can do something good with it. I don't keep that in mind 100 per cent of the time – I'm human – but I try to." ...|$|E

In August 2010 she gave birth to a second son. On 3 November 2011 it was reported that she was pregnant with a third son, and she gave birth in March 2012. When she was interviewed about parenting with Tennis.com she said [...] "Being a mother is so different; it’s not that it’s quieter or faster, it’s just different. Being a mom is tough. You understand what’s good for you and the babies, while tennis is just a game. It’s fun <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> different life when you step on the court but when the baby is sick you go crazy. When I lost a match it was really bad time, now I know it was a great time, so being a mom is tougher." ...|$|E

60|$|Last {{night the}} forlornities had all disappeared; so we {{gathered}} around the lamp, after supper, with our beer and my pipe, and in a condition of grateful snugness tackled the new magazines. I read your new story aloud, amid thunders of applause, and we all agreed that Captain Jenness {{and the old man}} with the accordion-hat are lovely people and most skillfully drawn--and that cabin-boy, too, we like. Of course we are all glad the girl is gone to Venice--for there is no place like Venice. Now I easily understand that the old man couldn't go, <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> purpose in sending Lyddy by herself: but you could send the old man over in another ship, and we particularly want him along.

Can't you let his good-natured purse be a daily prey to guides and beggar-boys? Can't you let him find peace and rest and fellowship under Pere Jacopo's kindly wing? (However, you are writing the book, not I--still, I am one of the people you are writing it for, you understand.)
