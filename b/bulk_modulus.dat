The <b>bulk</b> <b>modulus</b> of lead—a measure of its ease of compressibility—is 45.8GPa. In comparison, that of aluminium is 75.2GPa; copper 137.8GPa; and mild steel 160–169GPa. Lead's tensile strength, at 12–17 MPa, is low (that of aluminium is 6 times higher, copper 10 times, and mild steel 15 times higher); it can be strengthened by adding small amounts of copper or antimony.|$|E
5|$|Einsteinium is a synthetic, silvery-white, {{radioactive}} metal. In {{the periodic}} table, {{it is located}} {{to the right of}} the actinide californium, to the left of the actinide fermium and below the lanthanide holmium with which it shares many similarities in physical and chemical properties. Its density of 8.84 g/cm3 is lower than that of californium (15.1 g/cm3) and is nearly the same as that of holmium (8.79 g/cm3), despite atomic einsteinium being much heavier than holmium. The melting point of einsteinium (860°C) is also relatively low – below californium (900°C), fermium (1527°C) and holmium (1461°C). Einsteinium is a soft metal, with the <b>bulk</b> <b>modulus</b> of only 15 GPa, which value is one of the lowest among non-alkali metals.|$|E

Electron gas obeyed Fermi-Dirac distribution and satisfied with theory of ideal gas.

It showed that, pressure of electron gas closely related to <b>bulk</b> elastic <b>modulus,</b> and {{maybe it was the}} major factor in determining <b>bulk</b> elastic <b>modulus</b> of metal; not all of valence electrons of atom in metal became conduction electrons to form the electron gas; new model of present work is superior to traditional method based on calculating derivative of potential energy...|$|R

5|$|In the {{periodic}} table, americium is located {{to the right}} of plutonium, to the left of curium, and below the lanthanide europium, with which it shares many similarities in physical and chemical properties. Americium is a highly radioactive element. When freshly prepared, it has a silvery-white metallic lustre, but then slowly tarnishes in air. With a density of 12g/cm3, americium is less dense than both curium (13.52g/cm3) and plutonium (19.8g/cm3); but has a higher density than europium (5.264g/cm3)—mostly because of its higher atomic mass. Americium is relatively soft and easily deformable and has a significantly lower <b>bulk</b> <b>modulus</b> than the actinides before it: Th, Pa, U, Np and Pu. Its melting point of 1173°C is significantly higher than that of plutonium (639°C) and europium (826°C), but lower than for curium (1340°C).|$|E
5|$|Neptunium is a hard, silvery, ductile, {{radioactive}} actinide metal. In {{the periodic}} table, {{it is located}} {{to the right of}} the actinide uranium, to the left of the actinide plutonium and below the lanthanide promethium. Neptunium is a hard metal, having a <b>bulk</b> <b>modulus</b> of 118GPa, comparable to that of manganese. Neptunium metal is similar to uranium in terms of physical workability. When exposed to air at normal temperatures, it forms a thin oxide layer. This reaction proceeds more rapidly as the temperature increases. Neptunium has been determined to melt at 639±3°C: this low melting point, a property the metal shares with the neighboring element plutonium (which has melting point 639.4°C), is due to the hybridization of the 5f and 6d orbitals and the formation of directional bonds in the metal. The boiling point of neptunium is not empirically known and the usually given value of 4174°C is extrapolated from the vapor pressure of the element. If accurate, this would give neptunium the largest liquid range of any element (3535K passes between its melting and boiling points).|$|E
5|$|The {{previous}} {{members of}} group 8 have relatively high melting points (Fe, 1538°C; Ru, 2334°C; Os, 3033°C). Much like them, hassium {{is predicted to}} be a solid at room temperature, although the melting point of hassium has not been precisely calculated. Hassium should crystallize in the hexagonal close-packed structure (c/a=1.59), similarly to its lighter congener osmium. Pure metallic hassium is calculated to have a <b>bulk</b> <b>modulus</b> (resistance to uniform compression) {{comparable to that of}} diamond (442GPa). Hassium is expected to have a bulk density of 40.7g/cm3, the highest of any of the 118 known elements and nearly twice the density of osmium, the most dense measured element, at 22.61g/cm3. This results from hassium's high atomic weight, the lanthanide and actinide contractions, and relativistic effects, although production of enough hassium to measure this quantity would be impractical, and the sample would quickly decay. Osmium is the densest element of the first 6 periods, and its heavier congener hassium {{is expected to be the}} densest element of the first 7 periods.|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{any other}} element, helium will remain liquid down to {{absolute}} zero at normal pressures. This {{is a direct}} effect of quantum mechanics: specifically, the zero point energy {{of the system is}} too high to allow freezing. Solid helium requires a temperature of 1–1.5K (about −272°C or −457°F) at about 25 bar (2.5MPa) of pressure. It is often hard to distinguish solid from liquid helium since the refractive index of the two phases are nearly the same. The solid has a sharp melting point and has a crystalline structure, but it is highly compressible; applying pressure in a laboratory can decrease its volume by more than 30%. With a <b>bulk</b> <b>modulus</b> of about 27 MPa it is ~100 times more compressible than water. Solid helium has a density of 0.214±0.006g/cm3 at 1.15K and 66atm; the projected density at 0K and 25 bar (2.5 MPa) is 0.187±0.009g/cm3. At higher temperatures, helium will solidify with sufficient pressure. At room temperature, this requires about 114,000 atm.|$|E
5|$|Lawrencium is {{the final}} member of the {{actinide}} series and is sometimes {{considered to be a}} group 3 element, along with scandium, yttrium, and lutetium, as its filled f-shell is expected to make it resemble the 7th-period transition metals. In the periodic table, it is located {{to the right of the}} actinide nobelium, to the left of the 6d transition metal rutherfordium, and under the lanthanide lutetium with which it shares many physical and chemical properties. Lawrencium is expected to be a solid under normal conditions and assume a hexagonal close-packed crystal structure (c/a=1.58), similar to its lighter congener lutetium, though this is not yet known experimentally. The enthalpy of sublimation of lawrencium is estimated to be 352kJ·mol−1, close to the value of lutetium and strongly suggesting that metallic lawrencium is trivalent with the 7s and 6d electrons delocalized, a prediction also supported by a systematic extrapolation of the values of heat of vaporization, <b>bulk</b> <b>modulus,</b> and atomic volume of neighboring elements to lawrencium. Specifically, lawrencium is expected to be a trivalent, silvery metal, easily oxidized by air, steam, and acids, and having an atomic volume similar to that of lutetium and a trivalent metallic radius of 171pm. It is expected to be a rather heavy metal with a density of around 15.6 to 16.6g·cm−3. It is also predicted to have a melting point of around 1900K (1627°C), not far from the value for lutetium (1925K).|$|E

40|$|The trabecular {{meshwork}} (TM) {{is comparable}} to a bioactive filter that {{plays a major role}} in regulating outflow of aqueous humor of the eye and setting intraocular pressure (IOP). TM dysfunction may lead to ocular hypertension which is the major risk factor in glaucoma. Although the outflow properties of the TM have been assessed over the last sixty years, very little work has been done assessing its mechanical properties. Therefore, the major goals of these studies were two-fold: (1) to determine the relationship between mechanical properties of TM, specifically the <b>bulk</b> Young's <b>modulus,</b> and outflow function in normal and glaucomatous eyes, and (2) to establish a method and possible animal model for future testing of this relationship. Outflow function was assessed by constant pressure perfusion in enucleated eyes at four pressure levels (10, 20, 30, and 40 mmHg) to determine outflow facilities and variability in outflow resistance with pressure elevation. A micro-strain analyzer (MSA) was used to determine the circumferential <b>bulk</b> Young's <b>modulus</b> of the TM post-perfusion. Based on their relative ease of availability, pigs and rats were explored as possible animal models. Due to the small size of rat eyes, atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to assess the Young's modulus of TM rather than with a MSA. We found that there was a relationship with better outflow function and a stiffer TM in normal eyes. Additionally, glaucomatous TM was found to be much softer and more variable than normal TM. Unfortunately, porcine TM did not serve as a good model for the <b>bulk</b> Young's <b>modulus</b> of human TM, presumably due to anatomical difference in its outflow pathway. Lastly, we were able to establish a new method for measuring the Young's modulus of rat TM for future work to determine potential mechanism for evaluating stiffness changes that may be associated with glaucoma.

The method is based on the bidirectional evolutionary structural optimization (BESO) technique. The optimization problem is formulated as finding a micro-structural topology with the maximum <b>bulk</b> or shear <b>modulus</b> under a prescribed volume constraint. Using the homogenization theory and finite element analysis within a periodic base cell (PBC), elemental sensitivity numbers are established for gradually removing and adding elements in PBC.

Considering that the obtained structures may sustain {{a certain amount}} of static loadings, it is desirable to ensure the optimized designs to have a relatively high stiffness. To tackle this issue, we conducted a multiple objective optimization to maximize band gap size and <b>bulk</b> or shear <b>modulus</b> simultaneously with a prescribed volume fraction of solid material so that the resulting structures can be lightweight, as well. In particular, we first conducted the finite element analysis of the phononic band gap crystals and then adapted a very efficient optimization procedure to resolve this problem based on bi-directional evolutionary structure optimization (BESO) algorithm in conjunction with the homogenization method. A number of optimization results for maximizing band gaps with <b>bulk</b> and shear <b>modulus</b> constraints are presented for out-of-plane and in-plane modes.
