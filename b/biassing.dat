Hale was not noted as a particularly innovative judge, but took pains to ensure that his decisions were easy to understand and informative. Roger North wrote that [...] "I have known the Court of King's Bench sitting every day from eight to 12, and the Lord Chief Justice Hale's managing matters of law to all imaginable advantage to the students, and in that he took a pleasure or rather pride; he encouraged arguing when it was to the purpose, and used to debate with counsel, so that the court might have been taken for an academy of sciences as well as the seat of justice". He was noted for allowing counsel to fix any problems with pleadings, and for letting them correct him if he made an error in his summing up. He disliked eloquence, writing that [...] "If the judge or jury has a right understanding it signifies nothing but {{a waste of time and}} loss of words, and if they are weak, and easily wrought upon, it is a more decent way of corrupting them by bribing their fancies and <b>biassing</b> their affections."

60|$|That same evening Paul paced up {{and down}} his rooms in Peckwater with all his soul strangely upheaved within him and tossed and racked by a dozen {{conflicting}} doubts and passions. Had he gone too far? Had he yielded like Adam to the woman who beguiled him? Had he given way like Samson to the snares of Delilah? For the old Scripture phraseology and imagery, so long burned into his very nature, clung to him still in spite of all his faltering changes of opinion. Had he said more than he thought and felt about the Apostle? Even {{if he was going to}} revise his views, was it right, was it candid, was it loyal to the truth, that he should revise them under the <b>biassing</b> influence of Meenie's eyes? If only he could have separated the two questions--the Apostle's mission, and the something which he felt growing up within him! But he could not--and, as he suspected, for a most excellent reason, because the two were intimately bound up in the very warp and woof of his existence. Nature was asserting herself against the religious asceticism of the Apostle; it could not be so wrong for him to feel those feelings that had thrilled every heart in all his ancestors for innumerable generations.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} several {{methods that}} can be used to analyse gas turbines, based on an optimal estimation algorithm called the Kalman Filter. These techniques overcome the difficulties of more 'traditional' analysis methods, which can give misleading results because they do not explicitly consider the possibility of measurement error. An enhancement to the Kalman Filter (the 'Concentrator') is presented, which overcomes the Kalman Filter's tendency to 'smear' the effects of genuine changes in a small number of component changes and/or sensor <b>biasses</b> over the whole set of changes and <b>biasses</b> being considered. To complement this, methods of optimising some of the statistical inputs to the Kalman Filter in order to improve the ability of the 'Concentrator' to carry out the required analysis are discussed. These are based on analytical methods developed to determine the sensitivity of the Kalman Filter to its inputs. Techniques are also presented for determining the gas-path measurements in a gas turbine that are needed to enable the required analysis of component changes and/or sensor <b>biasses</b> to be performed, including determination of both possible measurement redundancy and the ability of a set of measurements to successfully differentiate between all the component changes and sensor <b>biasses</b> being sought. A recursive algorithm for time series analysis (the Smoothing/Trending Algorithm) is also presented. This produces, for each point in a time series, best estimates of the underlying levels and trends (rates of change of level) of the process generating the observations. A method of combining the 'Concentrator' and the Smoothing/Trending Algorithm is also presented, which reduces the effects of sensor noise on the analysis of component changes and sensor <b>biasses</b> from time series data. Many types of prime movers and process plant could be effectively analysed using the methods described in this thesis...|$|R

6000|$|After {{maintaining}} (what {{is readily}} granted) that negroes have a religion composed of many elements, Mr. Muller tries {{to discredit the}} evidence about the creeds of savages, and discourses on the many minute shades of progress which exist among tribes too often lumped together {{as if they were}} all in the same condition. Here he will have all scientific students of savage life on his side. It remains true, however, that certain elements of savage practice, fetichism being one of them, are practically ubiquitous. Thus, when Mr. Muller speaks of 'the influence of public opinion' in <b>biassing</b> the narrative of travellers, we must not forget that the strongest evidence about savage practice is derived from the 'undesigned coincidence' of the testimonies of all sorts of men, in all ages, and all conditions of public opinion. 'Illiterate men, ignorant of the writings of each other, bring the same reports from various quarters of the globe,' wrote Millar of Glasgow. When sailors, merchants, missionaries, describe, as matters unprecedented and unheard of, such institutions as polyandry, totemism, and so forth, the evidence is so strong, because the witnesses are so astonished. They do not know that anyone but themselves has ever noticed the curious facts before their eyes. And when Mr. Muller tries to make the testimony about savage faith still more untrustworthy, by talking of the 'absence of recognised authority among savages,' do not let us forget that custom ([Greek]) is a recognised authority, and that the punishment of death is inflicted for transgression of certain rules. These rules, generally speaking, are of a religious nature, and the religion to which they testify is of the sort known (too vaguely) as 'fetichistic.' Let us keep steadily before our minds, when people talk of lack of evidence, that we have two of the strongest sorts of evidence in the world for the kind of religion which least suits Mr. Muller's argument--(1) the undesigned coincidences of testimony, (2) the irrefutable witness and sanction of elementary criminal law. Mr. Muller's own evidence is that much-disputed work, where 'all men see what they want to see, as in the clouds,' and where many see systematised fetichism--the Veda. {222} ...|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} {{comparison}} of two methods for cosmological parameter inference from supernovae Ia lightcurves fitted with the SALT 2 technique. The standard chi-square methodology and the recently proposed Bayesian hierarchical method (BHM) are each applied to identical sets of simulations based on the 3 -year data release from the Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS 3), and also data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), the Low Redshift sample and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), assuming a concordance LCDM cosmology. For both methods, {{we find that the}} recovered values of the cosmological parameters, and the global nuisance parameters controlling the stretch and colour corrections to the supernovae lightcurves, suffer from small <b>biasses.</b> The magnitude of the <b>biasses</b> is similar in both cases, with the BHM yielding slightly more accurate results, in particular for cosmological parameters when applied to just the SNLS 3 single survey data sets. Most notably, in this case, the <b>biasses</b> in the recovered matter density Î©_ m, 0 are in opposite directions for the two methods. For any given realisation of the SNLS 3 -type data, this can result in a âˆ¼ 2 Ïƒ discrepancy in the estimated value of Î©_ m, 0 between the two methods, which we find to be the case for real SNLS 3 data. As more higher and lower redshift SNIa samples are included, however, the cosmological parameter estimates of the two methods converge. Comment: 10 pages, 7 figures, submitted to MNRA...|$|R

50|$|This type is superficially {{very similar}} to a {{resonance}} absorption isolator, but the magnetic <b>biassing</b> differs, and the energy from the backward travelling signal is absorbed in a resistive film or card on one face of the ferrite block rather than within the ferrite itself. The bias field is weaker than that necessary to cause resonance at the operating frequency, but is instead designed to give the ferrite zero permeability for one sense of rotation of the microwave signal field. The bias polarity is such that this special condition arises for the forward signal, while the backward signal sees the ferrite as an ordinary permeable material. Consequently, the electromagnetic field of the forward signal tends to be excluded from the ferrite while the field of the backward wave is concentrated within it. This results in a null of the electric field of the forward signal {{on the surface of}} the ferrite where the resistive film is placed. Conversely for the backward signal, the electric field is strong over this surface and so its energy is dissipated in driving current through the film. In rectangular waveguide the ferrite block will typically occupy the full height from one broad-wall to the other, with the resistive film on the side facing the centre-line of the guide.|$|E

Electron transfer {{was found to be}} a thermal process, no photo-assistance being observed. A powerful electron acceptor, dichloro- dicyano p benzoquinone was used for a quantitative determination of the electron donor abilities of a number of pigments. The adsorption of electron acceptors from solution has been followed by ultra-violet absorption spectroscopy and ultra-violet and visible reflectance spectroscopy. Room temperature fluorescence of pigments and of compounds on pigments has been examined and compared with solution fluorescence. The photo-reduction of pigments in the presence of alcohols was studied and the formation of small quantities of photo-produced superoxide anion adsorbed on pigments has been confirmed. The photo-electric properties of pigments have been studied by use of a simple wet electrochemical cell containing a layer of pigment deposited on an inert substrate. Photo-voltages of a number of pigments have been measured and found to correlate well with their known durabilities in paint media; providing a rapid test for the estimation of pigment durabilities. The photo-voltages and equilibrium dark potentials are discussed in terms of the band model for titanium dioxide.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{detailed}} palaeoclimate {{analysis of the}} Middle Miocene (uppermost Badenian-lowermost Sarmatian) Schrotzburg locality in S Germany, based on the fossil macro- and micro-flora, using four different methods for the estimation of palaeoclimate parameters: the coexistence approach (CA), leaf margin analysis (LMA), the Climate-Leaf Analysis Multivariate Program (CLAMP), {{as well as a}} recently developed multivariate leaf physiognomic approach based on an European calibration dataset (ELPA). Considering results of all methods used, the following palaeoclimate estimates seem to be most likely: mean annual temperature ~ 15 - 16 Â°C (MAT), coldest month mean temperature ~ 7 Â°C (CMMT), warmest month mean temperature between 25 and 26 Â°C, and mean annual precipiation ~ 1, 300 mm, although CMMT values may have been colder as indicated by the disappearance of the crocodile Diplocynodon and the temperature thresholds derived from modern alligators. For most palaeoclimatic parameters, estimates derived by CLAMP significantly differ from those derived by most other methods. With respect to the consistency of the results obtained by CA, LMA and ELPA, it is suggested that for the Schrotzburg locality CLAMP is probably less reliable than most other methods. A possible explanation may be attributed to the correlation between leaf physiognomy and climate as represented by the CLAMP calibration data set which is largely based on extant floras from N America and E Asia and which may be not suitable for application to the European Neogene. All physiognomic methods used here were affected by taphonomic <b>biasses.</b> Especially the number of taxa had a great influence on the reliability of the palaeoclimate estimates. Both multivariate leaf physiognomic approaches are less influenced by such <b>biasses</b> than the univariate LMA.
