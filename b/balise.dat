2500|$|In 1682, the French {{explorer}} Robert Cavelier de La Salle {{named the}} region Louisiana to honor France's King Louis XIV. The first permanent settlement, Fort Maurepas (at {{what is now}} Ocean Springs, Mississippi, near Biloxi), was founded by Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville, a French military officer from Canada, in 1699. By then the French had also built a small fort {{at the mouth of}} the Mississippi at a settlement they named La <b>Balise</b> (or La Balize), [...] "seamark" [...] in French. By 1721 they built a [...] wooden lighthouse-type structure to guide ships on the river.|$|E
50|$|The {{data in the}} <b>balise</b> {{can include}} the {{distance}} to the next <b>balise.</b> This is used to check for missing balises which could otherwise lead to a potential wrong-side failure.|$|E
50|$|A <b>balise</b> {{typically}} {{needs no}} power source. In response to radio frequency energy broadcast by a <b>Balise</b> Transmission Module mounted under a passing train, the <b>balise</b> either transmits {{information to the}} train (uplink) or receives information from the train (downlink, although this function is rarely used). The transmission rate of Eurobalises is sufficient for a complete 'telegram' to be received by a train passing at any speed up to 500 km/h.|$|E
50|$|A fixed <b>balise</b> is {{programmed}} to transmit {{the same data}} to every train. Information transmitted by a fixed <b>balise</b> typically includes: {{the location of the}} balise; the geometry of the line, such as curves and gradients; and any speed restrictions. The programming is performed using a wireless programming device. Thus a fixed <b>balise</b> can notify a train of its exact location, and the distance to the next signal, and can warn of any speed restrictions.|$|E
5000|$|Each pair of balises usually {{consists}} of a switchable <b>balise</b> and a fixed <b>balise.</b> A <b>balise</b> transmits a 'telegram' of either 1023 bits (93*11) or 341 bits (31*11) in the channel encoding with 11 bit per symbol. The user data block is cut into 10-bit user symbols before the scrambling and shaping operation - the effective payload of signalling information is 830 bit (83*10) for the long telegram and 210 bit (21*10) for the short telegram. The final telegram {{consists of}} ...|$|E
50|$|Balises must be {{deployed}} in pairs {{so that the}} train can distinguish the direction of travel 1→2 from direction 2→1, unless they are linked to a previous <b>balise</b> group in which case they can contain only one <b>balise.</b> Extra balises can be installed if the volume of data is too great.|$|E
50|$|A <b>balise</b> transmits telegrams at a {{specific}} site. To allow a continuous transmission the telegrams may be sent along leaky feeder cable being up to 1000 metres long. The Euroloop cable is always connected with a <b>balise</b> at its end which serves as the End of Loop Marker (EOLM). The telegram structure {{is the same as}} for the <b>balise</b> it is connected to. Originally the Euroloop used the same frequency as the Eurobalises but that was changed for specification 2.0.1 in September 2004. Euroloops had been used in Switzerland which completed the change in July 2010.|$|E
50|$|The KVB {{technology}} did already use the 27 MHz {{carrier frequency}} {{as well as}} putting the beacons {{in the center of}} the track. ABB adapted the system later for the Swedish EBICAB train protection system. The telegram types of the system were related to the TVM train protection system that started to decode the 27 bit word (27 out of 27 frequencies) with a digital signal processor in TVM-430. With KVB a single <b>balise</b> transmission had only 12 bit but it allowed for 2 to 5 balises in a <b>balise</b> group providing 24 to 80 bit of signalling information. Most of the patents on that encoding are held by GEC Alsthom. It was then to ABB to extend the telegram size from 12 bit in EBICAB 700 to 180 bit in EBICAB 900 (after encoding 255 bit) as used in the Mediterranean Corridor in Spain. In that time Ansaldo adopted the <b>balise</b> type for the digital evolution of the Italian SCMT also becoming a second supplier for the <b>balise</b> type to other railways. These <b>balise</b> types were later collectively named KER balises from their usage in KVB, Ebicab and RSDD (Ripetizione Segnali Discontinua Digitale).|$|E
50|$|A <b>balise</b> may {{be either}} a 'Fixed Data Balise,' or 'Fixed Balise' for short, {{transmitting}} the same data to every train, or a 'Transparent Data Balise' which transmits variable data, also called a 'Switchable' or 'Controllable Balise'. (Note that the word 'fixed' refers to the information transmitted by the <b>balise,</b> not to its physical location. All balises are immobile).|$|E

50|$|A <b>balise</b> which {{complies}} with the European Train Control System specification is called a Eurobalise.|$|E
5000|$|CTCS-3D: Track Circuit + <b>Balise</b> + ATP, CTCS-3D is {{equivalent}} to the European ETCS Level-1 ...|$|E
5000|$|Almost {{all packet}} types contain a {{parameter}} flagging whether its information is relevant for the [...] "nominal" [...] or [...] "reverse" [...] direction (or both). If a train sees <b>balise</b> 1 before <b>balise</b> 2 then it passes over {{the group in}} the nominal direction. Consequently, some packets may be dropped by the application software of the receiver {{if they are not}} designated for the relevant direction. The ERTMS header block of 50 bits contains the ETCS version, the current number and total count of balises within a <b>balise</b> group (up to 8 balises), a flag whether it is a copy (up to 4 copies) that increases chances for the receiver to see the telegram of the <b>balise</b> in a group, a serial number flagging whether the message has changed lately, a 10-bit country identifier along with the 14-bit <b>balise</b> group identifier allowing for a unique ID of every <b>balise</b> group. The linking information informs about the distance to the next <b>balise</b> group (one linking packet per direction) and the required train reaction if the next <b>balise</b> group is missed (e.g. train stop). The movement authority packet defines a maximum speed that may be used for a given maximum distance and maximum time - setting the maximum speed to zero will force the train to stop. The gradient profile may have a variable length based on the contained pairs of section length (scalar and number in the metric system) and section gradient (uphill/downhill flag and a number in %). Similarly the international static speed profile is given in a variable count of section parts with each part denoting the section length (number in meters - the scale is only given once {{at the start of the}} packet for all sections), the maximum speed (number * 5 km/h - allowed numbers are 0-120 i.e. some spare values are left over) and a flag if the speed restriction applies to the front or rear end of the train (possibly allowing for a delay). The trailer packet only contains its packet id with no parameters where 255 equals the state of all bits set in the 8-bit packet id field (11111111).|$|E
50|$|The payload data {{consists}} of a header followed by multiple packets defined in the ERTMS protocols. Typical packets are Packet 5 - Linking, Packet 12 - Movement Authority, Packet 21 - Gradient Profile, Packet 27 - International Static Speed Profile, Packet 255 - End of information. Many applications include optional packets like Packet 3 - National Values, Packet 41 - Level Transition Order, and Packet 136 - Infill Location Reference. If the telegram maximum of 830 bits is reached then more packets can be sent in the following balises of the same <b>balise</b> group - with up to 8 balises in a <b>balise</b> group the maximum ERTMS message per <b>balise</b> group can encompass 8 * 830 = 6640 bits (note that every telegram must contain a header and the trailer packet 255). A fixed <b>balise</b> transmits a stable message which typically can include the linking information, gradient profile, and speed profile. It may also contain track information such as route suitability data for different train types and axle load restrictions.|$|E
50|$|Siemens {{published}} a report showing {{the advantages of}} the <b>balise</b> technology for railway operations in 1992 and in the fall of 1995 they delivered prototypes of Siemens type S21 Eurobalise. ABB, Alsthom and Ansaldo did also cooperate in the development and the S21 <b>balise</b> along with other Eurobalise prototypes were tested from July to October 1996 at the Velim railway test circuit and the Austrian railways test lab (Forschungs- und Prüfzentrum Arsenal).|$|E
50|$|Eurobalises are {{typically}} placed in pairs on two sleepers {{in the center}} of the track. For ETCS they {{are typically}} spaced 3 metres apart. With the balises being numbered the train will know whether it travels in nominal (1→2) or reverse direction (2→1). Singular balises exist only when linked to a previous <b>balise</b> group or when their function is reduced to provide only the exact position. There may be up to 8 balises in an <b>balise</b> group.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>balise</b> {{typically}} {{needs no}} power source. In response to radio frequency energy broadcast by a [...] (BTM) mounted under a passing train, the <b>balise</b> transmits {{information to the}} train ('Uplink'). The provisions for Eurobalises to receive information from the train ('Downlink') {{has been removed from}} the specification. The transmission rate is sufficient to transmit at least 3 copies of a 'telegram' to be received by a train passing at any speed up to 500 km/h.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Balise</b> Transmission Module (BTM) is an {{set with}} antennas and the {{wireless}} interface for reading data telegrams from and writing to eurobalises.|$|E

50|$|A 'Fixed Data Balise', {{or short}} 'fixed balise' is {{programmed}} to transmit {{the same data}} to every train. Information transmitted by a fixed <b>balise</b> typically includes: {{the location of the}} balise; the geometry of the line, such as curves and gradients; and any speed restrictions. The programming is performed using a wireless programming device. Thus a fixed <b>balise</b> can notify a train of its exact location, and the distance to the next signal, and can warn of any speed restrictions.|$|E
5000|$|Clapham Junction rail crash - 1988 - wrong-side failure - both {{signal and}} <b>balise</b> {{would have shown}} false green lights. 35 killed, 100 plus injured.|$|E
5000|$|CTCS-2: Track Circuit + <b>Balise</b> + ATP, {{the track}} circuit is used both for block {{occupation}} detection and movement authorization, its architecture {{is similar to}} TVM-300.|$|E
50|$|It has two {{subsystem}}s: ground subsystem and onboard subsystem. The ground subsystem may {{based on}} <b>balise,</b> track circuit, radio communication network (GSM-R), and Radio Block Center (RBC). The onboard subsystem includes onboard computer and communication module.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>balise</b> [...] is an {{electronic}} beacon or transponder placed between the rails of a railway {{as part of}} an automatic train protection (ATP) system. The French word [...] "" [...] is used to distinguish these beacons from other kinds of beacons.|$|E
50|$|The {{first real}} {{implementation}} of the virtual <b>balise</b> concept has been done during the ESA project 3InSat on 50 km of track of the Cagliari-Golfo Aranci Marittima railway on Sardinia in which a SIL-4 train localisation at signalling system level has been developed using differential GPS.|$|E
50|$|Balises are {{differentiated}} {{as being}} either a 'Fixed Data Balise' transmitting {{the same data}} to every train, or a 'Transparent Data Balise' which transmits variable data, also called a 'Switchable' or 'Controllable Balise'. (Note that the word 'fixed' refers to the information transmitted by the <b>balise,</b> not to its physical location. All balises are immobile).|$|E
50|$|A {{controllable}} <b>balise</b> {{is connected}} to a Lineside Electronics Unit (LEU), which transmits dynamic data to the train, such as signal indications. Balises forming part of an ETCS Level 1 signalling system employ this capability. The LEU integrates with the conventional (national) signal system either by connecting to the lineside railway signal or to the signalling control tower.|$|E
50|$|The <b>balise</b> is {{typically}} mounted on or between sleepers or ties in the centre {{line of the}} track. A train travelling at maximum speed of 500 km/h will transmit and receive {{a minimum of three}} copies of the telegram while passing over each Eurobalise. The earlier KER balises (KVB, EBICAB, RSDD) were specified to work up to 350 km/h.|$|E
5000|$|An Eurobalise is a {{specific}} variant of a <b>balise</b> being a transponder placed between the rails of a railway. These balises constitute {{an integral part of}} the European Train Control System, where they serve as [...] "beacons" [...] giving the exact location of a train as well as transmitting signalling information in a digital telegram to the train.|$|E
50|$|Siemens had {{presented}} {{a study on}} <b>balise</b> systems in 1992 which influenced the choice of using a technology based on KVB and GSM instead of LZB when the European Rail Traffic Management System was researching a possible train signalling for Europe. The first Eurobalises were tested in 1996 and later train protection systems used them {{as a basis for}} their signalling needs.|$|E
50|$|Ansaldo STS {{has come}} to lead the UNISIG working group on GNSS {{integration}} into ERTMS within Next Generation Train Control (NGTC) WP7, whose main scope is to specify ETCS virtual <b>balise</b> functionality, {{taking into account the}} interoperability requirement. Following the NGTC specifications the future interoperable GNSS positioning systems, supplied by different manufacturers, will reach the defined positioning performance in the locations of the virtual balises.|$|E
50|$|In 1682, René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle and Henri de Tonti {{claimed the}} entire Mississippi River Valley for France, calling the river Colbert River after Jean-Baptiste Colbert {{and the region}} La Louisiane, for King Louis XIV. On March 2, 1699, Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville rediscovered {{the mouth of the}} Mississippi, {{following}} the death of La Salle. The French built the small fort of La <b>Balise</b> there to control passage.|$|E
50|$|TBL1+ {{began to}} be {{installed}} on the Belgian rail network in 2006, with full conversion to the system expected by 2012. The system is a development of TBL1, but uses Eurobalises, providing compatibility for later reconfiguration to an ETCS system. An additional safety measure is the addition of an additional <b>balise</b> 300m up-line, which forces an automatic stop on trains travelling at more than 40 km/h ahead of a red signal.|$|E
5000|$|La Balize, Louisiana, was a French fort and {{settlement}} {{near the mouth}} of the Mississippi River, in what later became Plaquemines Parish. The village's name (also spelled La <b>Balise)</b> meant [...] "seamark." [...] La Balize was historically and economically important for overseeing the river. It was rebuilt several times because of hurricane damage. The active delta lobe of the river's mouth is called the Balize Delta, after the settlement, or the Birdfoot Delta, because of its shape.|$|E
50|$|Eurobalises are {{not only}} used in the ETCS/ERTMS train {{protection}} system. There are alternative implementations that {{pick up on the}} telegram structure to encode only some packet types and adding additional specific information. ETCS trains may decode the telegrams possibly translating them like any other Class-B signalling information. It is also possible that a <b>balise</b> transmits telegrams for different systems allowing for a transitional phase from one variant to another as typically used when switching from a national train protection system to ETCS.|$|E
