5|$|The {{museum has}} a {{collection}} of 13,000 artifacts, books, photographs, art objects, and memorabilia. The DuSable collection has come largely from private gifts. It has United States slavery-era relics, nineteenth- and twentieth-century artifacts, and archival materials, including the diaries of sea explorer Captain Harry Dean. The DuSable collection includes works from scholar W. E. B. Du Bois, sociologist St. Clair Drake, and poet Langston Hughes. The African American art collection contains selections from the South Side Community Art Center students Charles White, Archibald Motley, Jr., Gus Nall, Charles Sebree, and Marion Perkins, as well as numerous New Deal Works Progress Administration period and 1960s Black Arts Movement works. The museum also owns prints and drawings by Henry O. Tanner, Richmond Barthé, and Romare Bearden, and has an extensive collection of <b>books</b> <b>and</b> <b>records</b> pertaining to African and African American history and culture.|$|E
5|$|The {{defeat and}} death of Richard III at Bosworth field was a double blow for the heralds, for they lost both their patron, the King, and their benefactor, the Earl Marshal, who was also slain. The victorious Henry Tudor was crowned King Henry VII soon after the battle. Henry's first Parliament of 1485 passed an Act of Resumption, in which large grants of crown {{properties}} made by his two predecessors to their supporters were cancelled. Whether this act affected {{the status of the}} College's charter is debatable; however, the act did facilitate the de facto recovery of Coldharbour to the crown. Henry then granted the house to his mother Lady Margaret Beaufort, for life. This was because it was supposed that the house was granted personally to John Writhe the Garter King of Arms and not to the heralds as a corporation. As a result, the heralds were left destitute and many of their <b>books</b> <b>and</b> <b>records</b> were lost. Despite this ill treatment from the King, the heralds' position at the royal court remained, and they were compelled by the King to attend him at all times (albeit in rotation).|$|E

Bernard Goldstein, the assistant treasurer and controller of the New York Star, was the assistant treasurer.

25|$|In 1892, Pinkerton Agent Charles A. Siringo, {{working out}} of the Denver Pinkerton office, played a {{significant}} role in ending the Coeur d'Alene strike. Siringo had been hired by the Mine Owners' Protective Association (MOA) to work at the Gem mine in Gem, Idaho. Siringo used the alias C. Leon Allison to join the local miners' union, ingratiating himself by buying drinks and loaning money to his fellow miners. He was elected to the post of secretary, providing access to all of the union's <b>books</b> <b>and</b> <b>records.</b>|$|E

In January 1990, he threatened an assistant of the bookshop with {{what appeared to be a}} shotgun in a cardboard box, and Brosnan served him with a trespass notice in February. His sister said he was an animal lover. Locals said this was a source of conflict with his next-door neighbour Garry Holden, whose pets kept dying.|$|E

25|$|When Joseph W. Taylor {{purchased}} 40 {{acres of}} land for the campus of Bryn Mawr College in 1878, three Victorian cottages were located on the property, later known as the Deanery, the Betweenery, and the Greenery. In 1885, M. Carey Thomas moved into the Deanery, a modest building of five rooms situated downhill and approximately 100 meters (330 feet) {{to the west of}} what was then the central campus building, Taylor Hall. The residence underwent a minor expansion in 1888 – the first of three renovations – when two small rooms were added {{to the rear of the}} house for the storage of <b>books</b> <b>and</b> <b>records.</b>|$|E
500|$|An {{argument}} {{raised in}} the case of Trohimovich v. Commissioner is that the Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution was not properly ratified, and that all laws passed by Congress since the year 1919 (which was not the year of ratification) are invalid.

500|$|In 1951, {{the current}} toll booth {{on the western}} edge of the river was {{constructed}} by the Electronic Signal Company, to replace an earlier booth on the eastern edge. In 1952, a tollpayer sued to exercise his right to inspect the <b>books</b> <b>and</b> <b>records</b> of the Commission, but lost his lawsuit and was not allowed access. In 1955, the General Accounting Office issued a report critical of the Commission and claiming that one commissioner had a conflict of interest. In response, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a suit seeking removal of the Commissioner and recovery of the misapplied funds. [...] However, the courts dismissed the case.|$|E

500|$|After {{his return}} to England, Ramsay Phipps was {{quartered}} at the Tower of London. After this assignment, {{he was sent to}} Plymouth, serving at the Prince of Wales Redoubt. In 1861, Phipps was stationed in South Shoebury, Essex. [...] He was promoted to the Royal Artillery's unique rank of second captain on 7 April 1864, and appointed brigade adjutant on 14 October 1868. The brigade adjutant functioned as the staff officer for the brigade commander: he supervised all brigade <b>books</b> <b>and</b> <b>records,</b> monitored the execution of orders, supervised the education and training of subalterns, prosecuted in all courts-martial proceedings, and accepted and transmitted all orders.|$|E
2500|$|Priorities were {{established}} {{during the process}} of conserving damaged <b>books</b> <b>and</b> <b>records,</b> the most critical of which became the retrieval of materials from flooded rooms. After they were rescued, <b>books</b> <b>and</b> <b>records</b> were typically washed and disinfected. In certain cases, bindings were cut and sheets treated individually. [...] Following a thorough cleansing, the materials were then dried in Florentine libraries, space permitting, or at locations outside of the city, such as tobacco kilns and granaries. In some circumstances, large quantities of books were covered with sawdust, as a means of drawing out moisture. When not washed prior to drying, dried mud was then scraped off the exterior of the books.|$|E

2500|$|Likewise, {{the word}} [...] "assessment" [...] {{has more than}} one tax law meaning. In the quote from Flora the term [...] "assessment" [...] does not refer to a {{statutory}} assessment by the Internal Revenue Service under [...] and [...] and other statutes (i.e., a formal recordation of the tax on the <b>books</b> <b>and</b> <b>records</b> of the United States Department of the Treasury). The term is instead used in the sense in which the taxpayer himself or herself [...] "assesses" [...] or computes his or her own tax in the process of preparing a tax return, prior to filing the return.|$|E

Hilton of Denver arrived to reinforce the WFM's legal staff. Moyer, one of the first witnesses before the jury, testified for two days.

2500|$|As an example, let's assume fund ABC Capital {{purchases}} {{computer equipment}} from XYZ Computers. Rather than paying XYZ for the computers, ABC adds {{a few cents}} to the brokerage fees it pays for executing transactions through its broker, LMN Brokers. LMN then sends payment to XYZ. (Of course, in this arrangement where third-party services have been acquired, there would be invoices and statements which would be documented in the broker's <b>books</b> <b>and</b> <b>records</b> and would serve as documentation of the expense.) If ABC had paid XYZ directly, the transaction would have been designated as a [...] "hard dollar" [...] cost. In this situation, because the computer equipments is not considered eligible research or brokerage services under Section 28(e), the arrangement could not rely on the safe harbor.|$|E
2500|$|Fr.

[...] The charge, however, was disputed by Moyer and by the Vestry of the Church of the Good Shepherd, who insisted that they only advised Bishop Bennison that a visit would not be helpful. Bennison was {{specifically}} invited to visit with the Vestry and to inspect the <b>books</b> <b>and</b> <b>records</b> of the Parish, which would have fulfilled his canonical responsibility. Moyer was publicly critical of Bennison's public statements regarding the veracity of the Bible and sexual teachings, denouncing Bennison's teachings as [...] "apostate and heretical" ...|$|E
