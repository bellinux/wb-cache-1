5|$|At first, the {{depression}} slowly tracked westward {{because it was}} <b>blocked</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> ridge of high pressure to the north. The system was under frequent reconnaissance surveillance, and {{the depression}} remained poorly organized and continued to be at tropical depression status well into 29 July. The organization of the system hindered further development despite favorable conditions with low wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures. Late on July 29, the system began to execute a turn to the northwest {{with an increase in}} forward speed. It still remained a poorly organized tropical depression south of Louisiana.|$|E
5|$|From Babylon, Alexander went to Susa, {{one of the}} Achaemenid capitals, and {{captured}} its treasury. He sent {{the bulk of his}} army to the Persian ceremonial capital of Persepolis via the Persian Royal Road. Alexander himself took selected troops on the direct route to the city. He then stormed the pass of the Persian Gates (in the modern Zagros Mountains) which had been <b>blocked</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> Persian army under Ariobarzanes and then hurried to Persepolis before its garrison could loot the treasury.|$|E

5|$|Since Smyth {{still had}} his {{commitments}} at Princeton and Chicago, he could only work on the report part-time. He wrote the report {{in his office in}} Princeton's Palmer Laboratory. Bars were installed on the windows of Smyth's office and the one adjacent to it. The hallway door to his office was locked and <b>blocked</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> large safe so that the only access was through the adjacent office, where there was an armed guard. The guards worked in eight-hour shifts, and one was present around the clock. When Smyth sent papers to Groves in Washington, D.C., they went by military courier.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} disturbance moved northward, crossing Guatemala {{from the eastern}} Pacific ocean into the northwest Caribbean Sea between September 20 and September 21. It became a tropical cyclone soon after emerging into the Caribbean, and moved across the Yucatán Peninsula as a tropical depression before becoming a tropical storm in the Gulf of Mexico on September 22 and a hurricane on September 23. It turned sharply east-northeast across the Mouth of the Mississippi river on September 24 as a minor hurricane. The storm continued east-northeast and made landfall in Florida east of Pensacola. The system evolved into an extratropical cyclone soon after passing out of the Sunshine State and continued moving east to northeast hugging the Atlantic Seaboard to near the Virginia Capes before moving slowly through the shipping lanes between Canada and Bermuda, <b>blocked</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> high pressure system in southeast Canada.|$|E
5|$|After Samus {{retrieves}} {{three pieces}} of the Light of Aether, she enters the Ing's Sky Temple and faces the Emperor Ing, the strongest Ing who guards the remaining Light of Aether. Samus defeats the creature and retrieves the last remaining energy, causing Dark Aether to become critically unstable and collapse; however, her path out of the temple is <b>blocked</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> horribly altered and unstable Dark Samus. After defeating her foe, Samus escapes as the dark world disappears around her. Returning to U-Mos, she finds that the Luminoth were {{in a state of}} hibernation but have now awakened. After a brief celebration, Samus leaves Aether in her repaired gunship. If the player completes the game with all of the items collected, Dark Samus is shown reforming herself above Aether.|$|E

40|$|This project {{seeks to}} {{implement}} a passive indoor positioning and tracking platform using Wi-Fi signals. It {{is well known that}} RF wave can be <b>blocked</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> object which results in signal attenuation [1 - 2]. The principle of this proposal is based on this phenomenon when the line-of-sight (LOS) link is <b>blocked</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> object. Hence, when a grid of such LOS links is tresspassed, it can be detected and tracked within the region...|$|R

5|$|Digging {{the tunnel}} {{turned out to}} be more {{difficult}} than expected. The soil was rocky, which forced the men to dig deeper than planned. There, they discovered a leaking gas main, which required the installation of special pumps to bring fresh air to the men. To hide the noise from the digging, one of the crew played piano and sang in the house while the others worked below. On July5, Berkman visited the prison stable, planning to make his escape. He was horrified to discover that the entrance was <b>blocked</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> large load of stones and bricks recently dumped for a construction project.|$|E
5|$|Following Stop and Smell the Roses, Starr's {{recording}} {{projects were}} beset with problems. After completing Old Wave in 1982 with producer Joe Walsh, {{he was unable}} to find a record company willing to release the album in the UK or the US. In 1987, he abandoned sessions in Memphis for a planned country album, produced by Chips Moman, after which Moman was <b>blocked</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> court injunction from issuing the recordings. Starr nevertheless maintained a high public profile through his narration over 1984–86 of the popular children's series Thomas & Friends, a Britt Allcroft production based on the books by the Reverend W. Awdry. For a single season in 1989, Starr also portrayed the character Mr. Conductor in the programme's American spin-off, Shining Time Station.|$|E
5|$|In October 2016, the U.S. {{state of}} Ohio {{announced}} that it would resume executions in January 2017, using a cocktail of midazolam, vecuronium bromide and potassium chloride but this was <b>blocked</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> Federal judge. On 25 July 2017, Ronald Phillips was executed with a three-drug cocktail including midazolam after the Supreme Court refused to grant a stay. Prior to this, the last execution in Ohio had been that of Dennis McGuire. Murderer Gary Otte's lawyers unsuccessfully challenged his Ohio execution, arguing that midazolam might not protect him from serious pain when the other drugs are administered. He died without incident in about 14 minutes on September 13, 2017.|$|E

5|$|Roma had {{a chance}} to equalise in the 27th minute, but Liverpool goalkeeper Bruce Grobbelaar saved Conti's low shot. Neal was shown a yellow card in the 32nd minute for {{bringing}} down Conti, and a few minutes later Liverpool had an opportunity to extend their lead. Liverpool striker Rush charged down Dario Bonetti's clearance and ran onto the ball, but his shot was saved by Tancredi. With minutes remaining until half-time, Roma equalised. Sebastiano Nela passed to Conti, who ran down the left-hand side of the pitch. His first attempt at crossing the ball into the penalty area was <b>blocked</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> combination of Neal and Mark Lawrenson, but his cross rebounded back to him. His second attempt found Roberto Pruzzo in the penalty area, whose glancing header went into the Liverpool goal to level the scores at 1–1.|$|E
5|$|The American Red Cross {{called it}} a major disaster, but getting relief into the area was stalled because of {{landslides}} blocking the ridge route running between Los Angeles and Kern counties. California State Route 99 was also <b>blocked</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> landslide ten miles south of Gorman, but the highway was quickly reopened later in the day. All aircraft {{not related to the}} relief effort were ordered not to land at the Tehachapi Municipal Airport. All 417 inmates from the Tehachapi Prison for Women were evacuated because of damage; the California Department of Corrections stated that the facility was left unusable. Most of the injured received medical care at Kern County General Hospital and some sought treatment at Tehachapi Valley Hospital, where some existing patients were moved to make room for new arrivals.|$|E
5|$|The Avon rises east of {{the town}} of Chipping Sodbury in South Gloucestershire, just north of the village of Acton Turville. Running a {{somewhat}} circular path, the river drains east and then south through Wiltshire. Its first main settlement is the village of Luckington, two miles (3km) inside the Wiltshire border, and then on to Sherston. At Malmesbury it joins up with its first major tributary, the Tetbury Avon, which rises just north of Tetbury in Gloucestershire. This tributary is known locally as the Ingleburn, which in Old English means 'English river'. Here, the two rivers almost meet but their path is <b>blocked</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> rocky outcrop of the Cotswolds, almost creating an island for the ancient hilltop town of Malmesbury to sit on. Upstream of this confluence the river is sometimes referred to as the 'River Avon (Sherston Branch)' to distinguish it from the Tetbury Branch.|$|E
50|$|In King's Quest III Redux the {{northern}} edge of Llewdor is <b>blocked</b> <b>by</b> rocky mountains and bluffs and a cave near the desert. The travel into the desert is <b>blocked</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> overlook. The southern edge of Llewdor is <b>blocked</b> <b>by</b> rocks or <b>a</b> fence. The desert is known as the Llewdorian desert and it is hinted that the land of Shapeir lies on the other side.|$|R

5|$|The Sleaford Navigation was a 12.5 mile (20.1km) {{canalisation}} of the River Slea in Lincolnshire, England, {{which opened}} in 1794. It ran from a junction with the River Witham, near Chapel Hill {{to the town of}} Sleaford through seven locks, most of which were adjacent to mills. Lack of finance meant that it stopped short of its intended terminus, but it gradually grew to be successful financially. The coming of the railways in 1857 led to a rapid decline, and it was officially abandoned by an act of Parliament in 1878, but remained open for a further three years. The lower part of it remained navigable until the 1940s, when it was <b>blocked</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> sluice.|$|E
5|$|The tomb {{was built}} from sarsen borders that were {{arranged}} as two trilithons, and was oriented almost east to west. As with {{four of the}} other Medway Megaliths, {{it appears to have}} been oriented toward either the Medway Valley or the North Downs. The chamber was a trapezoid in its shape, measuring about 12 feet long and 7-and-a-half feet wide. The chamber was likely 10 feet in height. It is likely that the entrance to the chamber was almost entirely <b>blocked</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> large stone, designated 'G' by excavators. Although {{it is difficult to determine}} the precise original layout of the chamber as a result of damage caused by medieval robbers, it appears likely that a medial stone divided the chamber in two. Furthermore, within the chamber, a drystone wall would have also blocked access.|$|E
5|$|With {{the match}} {{entering}} extra {{time and the}} golden goal rule applying, both sides had chances to score the decisive goal. In the second minute, Henry beat two defenders to enter the opponent's area, but his shot went just across the goal. Shortly after, Hagi received a straight red card, after game footage showed the player holding and striking Adams in the back; the Arsenal captain was awarded a yellow card for hitting Hagi during the altercation. As a result, Arsenal began to put the Turkish side under pressure by creating more chances through Henry, who almost won the game when he directed a header on goal from a long cross by Parlour, which Taffarel managed to keep out. Overmars's effort was then <b>blocked</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> Galatasaray defender.|$|E

5|$|After Picard is {{returned}} to the schoolroom, the lead Ferengi threatens to harm the children if Riker does not unlock the computer and teach his lieutenant how to operate the Enterprise. Riker pretends to instruct the Ferengi officer, but only spouts deliberately meaningless technobabble as he unlocks the computer console in Picard's schoolroom. With command functions enabled, Picard is able to activate a transporter safety function. With help from Worf's son, Alexander Rozhenko (Brian Bonsall), Guinan, and Ro, they use communication badges to trap most of the Ferengi on a transporter pad with their weapons disarmed and the exit <b>blocked</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> force field. Once {{most of them are}} detained, the children and Riker are able to overpower the remaining members and retake the Enterprise. After the events, the transporter is used to return Picard, Guinan, and Keiko to their adult states. Ro, buoyed by her experience, decides to remain a child for just a little while longer and draw some pictures, something she never did during her childhood.|$|E
5|$|He {{was arrested}} on 10 October 1990 on charges {{relating}} to kidnapping and extortion. The charges alleged an extortion scheme that involved tying a supposed bomb to a British businessman's leg. The Bhutto family considered the indictment politically motivated and fabricated. In the October 1990 elections, {{he was elected to}} the National Assembly while in jail. Bhutto and the PPP staged a walkout from the inaugural session of the National Assembly to protest Zardari's incarceration. He posted $20,000 bail, but his release was <b>blocked</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> government ordinance that removed a court's power to release suspects being tried in the terrorist court, which fast-track trials for alleged terrorists. The ordinance was later revoked and a special court acquitted him of bank fraud and conspiracy to murder political opponents. He was freed in February 1993. In March 1994, Zardari was acquitted of bank fraud charges. All other corruption charges relating to Bhutto's first term were dropped or thrown out of the courts.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{hearing the}} noise of explosions, the on-duty U.S. {{technicians}} rushed {{out the front door}} of their operations building where they were met by North Vietnamese gunfire. Blanton, the U.S. commander at Lima Site 85, was killed alongside two other U.S. technicians. Those who were not killed retreated to {{the west side of the}} mountain, where they hid on the edge of the cliff. From their hideout, the U.S. technicians fired on the North Vietnamese with their M-16 rifles and hand grenades. At 04:15, in response to the gunfire from the U.S. technicians, Muc ordered Cell 5 to reinforce Cell 3, and they captured the TACAN installation at 04:30 after 45 minutes of fighting. Meanwhile, Cell 4 had great difficulties in their attempt to seize the airstrip, where they were <b>blocked</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> Hmong mortar position. Le Ba Chom, the commander of Cell 4, was isolated from the other three soldiers of his cell. To avoid being captured alive by the numerically superior Hmong forces, Chom and his soldiers held onto their position and fought till daybreak.|$|E
