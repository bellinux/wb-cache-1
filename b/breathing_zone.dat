Eight polyethylene resins, selected primarily from those produced using an advanced solution-phase process, were extruded under commercial-scale processing conditions appropriate to their application: blown and cast film; and blow-, injection-, and rotational-molding. Air samples {{were taken from}} operator <b>breathing</b> <b>zones</b> and representative workplace air using recognized {{occupational health and safety}} protocols. The compounds selected consisted of aldehydes (acetaldehyde, acrolein, crotonaldehyde, formaldehyde, n-valeraldehyde), ketones (acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, THF, methyl n-amyl ketone, ethyl butyl ketone, ketene), organic acids (acetic, formic, and propanoic), aromatics (benzene, toluene, xylenes), and other compounds (nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, ethylene oxide, ozone, carbon monoxide, paraffin wax fume). Of the 488 concentrations measured from operator <b>breathing</b> <b>zones</b> and workplace air, 466 were below sampling method detection limits. Twelve of the remaining 22 concentrations were less than 20 % of the established exposure limits, and were therefore considered to present a statistically insignificant exposure risk. Five of the remaining 10 measurements consisted of ketene concentrations, which were found to be below detection limits upon retesting. The other five concentrations, of ozone, were also retested and found to be below detection limits. It is concluded that commercial-scale polyethylene extrusion presents minimal inhalation hazards in an adequately ventilated workplace.

40|$|Introduction: Assessment of {{exposure}} to the airborne respirable particles (PM 10) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) of asphalt manufacturing and road paving workers in the Campania region (Italy). Materials and Methods: A study was carried out during 2006 and involved 5 firms producing and employing bitumen in road paving activities. The workers studied were categorized {{on the basis of their}} job as workers in bitumen manufacturing, in road paving and in workers not exposed at bitumen fume considered like controls. Results: In the manufacturing plants the average concentrations of airborne PM 10 were 1125 ± 445 ìg/m 3 in the HMA manufacturing workers’ areas; 314 ± 81 ìg/m 3 in the process surveyors’ cabins and 92 ± 27 ìg/m 3 in the controls’ areas (administrative offices). Within the <b>breathing</b> <b>zones</b> of the worker, the average PAHs levels in air were as follows: 367 ± 198 ng/m 3 for HMA manufacturing workers; 348 ± 172 ng/m 3 for process surveyors; 21 ± 2 ng/m 3 for the controls. At the road paving sites the average airborne PM 10 levels were 1435 ± 325 ìg/m 3 for roller operators; 1610 ± 356 ìg/m 3 for paver operators; 319 ± 108 ìg/m for the controls (traffic controllers). PAHs in the <b>breathing</b> <b>zones</b> were 1220 ± 694 ng/m 3 for the paver operators; 1360 ± 575 ng/m 3 for the roller operators’ and 139 ± 135 ng/m 3 for the traffic controllers’. The results show that the more consistent hazard for asphalt workers’ health is derived from exposure to airborne PM 10 both in exposed and in non-exposed (controls) workers...|$|R

MethodsSixteen patients referred to the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health underwent mild steel (MS) and stainless steel (SS) welding challenge tests, due to suspicion of OA. Platelet count, leucocytes and their differential count, hemoglobin, sensitive CRP, lipids, glucose and fibrinogen were analyzed in addition to interleukin (IL) - 1 β, IL- 6, IL- 8, TNF-α, endothelin- 1, and E-selectin in plasma samples. Peak expiratory flow (PEF), forced expiratory volume in 1 min (FEV 1) and exhaled nitric oxide (NO) measurements were performed before and after the challenge test. Personal particle exposure was assessed using IOM and a mini sampler. Particle size distribution was measured by an Electric Low Pressure Impactor (ELPI). ResultsThe number of leukocytes, neutrophils, and platelets increased significantly, and the hemoglobin level and number of erythrocytes decreased significantly after both the MS and SS exposure tests. Five of the patients were diagnosed with OA, and their maximum fall in FEV 1 values was 0. 70 l (± 0. 32) 4 h after SS exposure. MS welding generated an average inhalable particle mass concentration of 31. 6, and SS welding of 40. 2 mg/m 3. The mean particle concentration measured inside the welding face shields by the mini sampler was 30. 2 mg/m 3 and 41. 7 mg/m 3, respectively.

As MWCNT have already found utility in different industries including construction, engineering, energy production, space exploration and biomedicine, large quantities of MWCNT may reach the environment and inadvertently lead to human exposure. This necessitates the urgent assessment of their potential health effects in humans. The current study was carried out at NanotechCenter Ltd. Enterprise (Tambov, Russia) where large-scale manufacturing of MWCNT along with relatively high occupational exposure levels was reported. The goal of this small cross-sectional study was to evaluate potential biomarkers during occupational exposure to MWCNT. All air samples were collected at the workplaces from both specific areas and personal <b>breathing</b> <b>zones</b> using filter-based devices to quantitate elemental carbon and perform particle analysis by TEM. Biological fluids of nasal lavage, induced sputum and blood serum were obtained from MWCNT-exposed and non-exposed workers for assessment of inflammatory and fibrotic markers. It was found that exposure to MWCNTs caused significant increase in IL- 12, IL 6, TNF- 1, inflammatory cytokines and KL- 6, a serological biomarker for interstitial lung disease in collected sputum samples. Moreover, the level of TGF- 21 was increased in serum obtained from young exposed workers. Overall, the results from this study revealed accumulation of inflammatory and fibrotic biomarkers in biofluids of workers manufacturing MWCNTs.

However, the influence of the age of broilers on bioaerosol concentrations has not been investigated. To evaluate the evolution of bioaerosol concentration during the fattening period, bioaerosol parameters (inhalable dust, endotoxin and bacteria) were measured in 12 poultry confinement buildings in Switzerland, at three different stages of the birds' growth; samples of air taken from within the <b>breathing</b> <b>zones</b> of individual poultry house employees as they caught the chickens ready to be transported for slaughter were also analysed. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) was used to assess the quantity of total airborne bacteria and total airborne Staphylococcus species. Bioaerosol levels increased significantly during the fattening period of the chickens. During the task of catching mature birds, the mean inhalable dust concentration for a worker was 26 +/- 1. 9 mg m(- 3) and endotoxin concentration was 6198 +/- 2. 3 EU m(- 3) air, > 6 -fold higher than the Swiss occupational recommended value (1000 EU m(- 3)).

Two paint manufacturing factories and 22 various kinds of spray painting factories (16 car painting, two aircraft painting, three video terminal painting; and one trailer painting) were included. Air concentrations of organic solvents were collected by personal samplers and analysed by gas chromatography. A total of 180 workers were given a comprehensive physical examination, a questionnaire, a liver function test, and a test for hepatitis B surface antigen. The questionnaire contained questions regarding detailed personal medical history, intake of alcohol, and use of medicine. Mixtures of solvents were used throughout the factories, and xylene and toluene were the major components found in almost all air samples with average contents of 46 % and 29 % on a weight basis of 67 air samples. No strong hepatotoxic solvents were detected. Workers were classified according to the different exposure patterns and different air concentrations of <b>breathing</b> <b>zones</b> as: high (eight hour time weighted average (8 h TWA) hygienic effects of solvents 0. 25 - 9. 83, median 1. 66), short term high (8 h TWA hygienic effects of solvents 0 - 3. 38, median 0. 12), and low (8 h TWA hygienic effects of solvents all below 0. 38). After applying a multivariate model to control the non-occupational factors (alcohol, medication, age, and hepatitis B viral infection), increase in gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) activity was found to be associated with severity of exposure to the mixture of solvents.

In 1977, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) issued the publication: Criteria for a Recommended Standard [...] Occupational Exposure to Waste Anesthetic Gases and Vapors. This publication was based primarily on scientific evidence from human and animal studies suggesting that chronic exposures to anesthetic gases increases the risk of both spontaneous abortion and congenital abnormalities in offspring among female workers and wives of male workers exposed to waste anesthetic gases. In this recommended standard, NIOSH defines the recommended exposure limits (REL) for nitrous oxide and halogenated anesthetics.

40|$|Infectious source {{strength}} {{is a crucial}} parameter in assessing infection risk and predicting the spread of infection. Descriptive informa tion reg arding the outbreak can be revealed fro m ep idemiological investiga tion, but descriptive epidemiology o ften can not provide quantitative information, such as the infectious {{source strength}}. Some additional mathematical models are required to estimate this quantitative information from {{the outcome of the}} outbreak. In cases of airborne transmissible diseases in indoor environments, spatial patterns of the cases of infection can often be observed as the occupants were likely to have been exposed to different concentrations of the infectious particles. Existing models cannot incorporate the spatial pattern of infection in an outbreak when estimating the infectious source strength, which may cause errors in estimation. This research aims at performing retrospective estimation of the infectious source strength of an influenza outbreak case during a flight with the aid of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and likelihood estimation. The approach allows consideration of the spatial distribution of infection in the outbreak in the infectious source strength estimation. In 1999, 20 of 74 passengers were infected with influenza during a 3 hour flight in Australia. The case was reconstructed using CFD. Expiratory aerosols were released from the index case's mouth in the numerical model. Spatial and temporal distribution of the expiratory aerosols in the other passengers' <b>breathing</b> <b>zones</b> and the number of expiratory aerosols deposited on different surfaces were then obtained. Based on the distribution data, the Wells-Riley approach was then used to perform a set of infection risk assessments on the passengers by using a range of quantum generation rate values. Likelihood estimation was then used to correlate the passengers' infection risks to the actual outcome of the outbreak. The quantum generation rate resulting in the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) was most likely to be the true infectious source strength in the case. Comparison between the infectious source strength estimated by this approach and that ignoring the spatial infection pattern was made. It is found the approach used in the current study gave a more reasonable estimation. This study shows that CFD and MLE can be used to estimate the infectious source strengths in outbreaks of airborne transmissible diseases. The estimated quantum generation rate can be used as the infectious source strength in other scenarios to perform infection risk assessment of influenza. © 2011 ASHRAE...|$|R
