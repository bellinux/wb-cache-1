60|$|Next day the Captain and I transacted our {{business}} in the Harbour Office. It was a lofty, <b>big,</b> <b>cool,</b> white room, where the screened light of day glowed serenely. Everybody in it--the officials, the public--were in white. Only the heavy polished desks gleamed darkly in a central avenue, and some papers lying on them were blue. Enormous punkahs sent from on high a gentle draught through that immaculate interior and upon our perspiring heads.|$|R
60|$|Then {{they entered}} the house, and a grey-haired Swedish woman led them through several match-boarded rooms into a <b>big,</b> <b>cool</b> hall. She left them there for awhile, and Agatha was busy {{for a minute or}} two with her {{impressions}} of the house. It was singularly empty by comparison with the few English homesteads she had seen. There were neither curtains nor carpets nor hangings of any kind, but it was commodious and comfortable.|$|R
2500|$|In an {{editorial}} in Time magazine on October 31, 2014, Jeffrey Kluger concluded that [...] "A fatal accident in the Mojave Desert is a lesson in the perils of space hubris. It’s {{hard not to be}} angry, even disgusted, with Branson himself. He is, as today’s tragedy shows, a man driven by too much hubris, too much hucksterism and too little knowledge of the head-crackingly complex business of engineering. For the 21st century billionaire, space travel is what buying a professional sports team was for the rich boys of an earlier era: the <b>biggest,</b> <b>coolest,</b> most impressive toy imaginable." ...|$|R
60|$|The American left Colonel Falcon in a <b>big,</b> <b>cool,</b> shadowed {{room with}} a floor of inlaid and {{polished}} woods that any millionaire in the States would have envied, excusing himself for a few minutes. He crossed a patio, shaded with deftly arranged awnings and plants, and entered a long room looking upon the sea in the opposite wing of the house. The broad jalousies were opened wide, and the ocean breeze flowed in through the room, an invisible current of coolness and health. Goodwin's wife sat {{near one of the}} windows, making a water-color sketch of the afternoon seascape.|$|R

60|$|In any case, {{she faced}} the {{scorching}} sun uncomplainingly, and arriving at last before an iron-bound {{door in a}} blank white wall, was led through an ill-kept garden, where flowers rioted, a chaos of blazing colour, at their will, into a <b>big,</b> <b>cool</b> house, which seemed filled with slumbrous quietness. She was received by a very reposeful lady of middle age in inconveniently tight-fitting black silk, with the powder thick upon her pallid face. The SeÃ±ora Anasona was, as is usual with Spanish women who have passed their third decade, somnolent in expression, and portly; but though they could only muster a very little indifferent French between them, she promptly set her guests at ease.|$|R

6000|$|Flies were no use. I {{offered him}} a bookful, every variety of shape and color, at dawn and dusk, without tempting him. I tried grubs, which bass like, and a frog's leg, which no {{pickerel}} can resist, and little frogs, such as big trout hunt among the lily pads in the twilight,--all without pleasing him. And then waterbeetles, and a red squirrel's tail-tip, which makes the best hackle in the world, and kicking grasshoppers, and a silver spoon with a wicked [...] "gang" [...] of hooks, which I detest and which, I am thankful to remember, the trout detested also. They lay there in their <b>big</b> <b>cool</b> eddy, lazily taking what food the stream brought down to them, giving no heed to frauds of any kind.|$|R

5000|$|For 1983, the Brazil-built 1.8-litre gained four hp, {{while the}} OHV 1.8 and SOHC 2.0 were {{replaced}} by a Chevrolet-built OHV 2.0, also with 90 hp.

5000|$|Humidity {{affects the}} energy budget and thereby {{influences}} temperatures in two major ways. First, water vapor {{in the atmosphere}} contains [...] "latent" [...] energy.

60|$|It was {{a relief}} to enter the <b>big,</b> <b>cool,</b> general store, but when Clare went to the dry-goods counter Dick turned aside to make his purchases. After this, he strolled about, {{examining}} specimens of native feather-work, and was presently seized by an inspiration as he stopped beside some Spanish lace. Clare ought to wear fine lace. The intricate, gauzy web would harmonize with her delicate beauty, but the trouble was that he was no judge of the material. A little farther on, a case of silver filigree caught his eye and he turned over some of the articles. This was work he knew more about, and it was almost as light and fine as the lace. The design was good and marked by a fantastic Eastern grace, for it had come from the Canaries and the Moors had taught the Spaniards how to make it long ago. After some deliberation, Dick chose a belt-clasp in a box by itself, and the girl who had been waiting on him called a clerk.|$|R
60|$|It {{was evident}} that the man did so, for he went out with a respectful gesture of comprehension, and then turned and shook a yellow fist at the door which closed behind him. He could foresee that to do as he was bidden might involve him in difficulties, but Benicia Figuera was {{something}} of a power in that country, and he knew it was seldom advisable to thwart her. She, as it happened, sat still thinking for a time, and as the result of it when Desmond's gig went ashore next morning a negro handed one of her crew a little note. That afternoon Desmond dressed himself with somewhat unusual care before he was rowed ashore, and on being ushered into a white house by a uniformed negro was not altogether astonished to find Benicia Figuera waiting for him alone in a <b>big</b> <b>cool</b> room. He had met her in Las Palmas, and she smiled at him graciously as she pointed to a little table where wine and cigarettes were laid out.|$|R
