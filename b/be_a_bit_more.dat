500|$|Raonic {{followed}} Indian Wells {{by reaching}} the quarterfinals {{at the next}} three ATP 1000 events in Miami, Monte Carlo, and Madrid, eventually losing to Kyrgios, Murray, and Djokovic, respectively. On May 2, he re-entered the top10 at No. 10. Raonic continued the clay court season with a second-round loss at the Italian Open to Kyrgios. At the French Open, he was the eighth seed, but fell in the fourth round in straight sets to world No. 55 Albert Ramos Viñolas. During the French Open, former world No. 1 and 3-time Wimbledon champion John McEnroe {{announced that he would}} join Raonic's team as a consultant for the grass court season. Commenting on McEnroe joining Moyá and Piatti on his coaching team, Raonic said: [...] "I was sort of just looking for another set of eyes to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> efficient on grass" [...] and he said it was about [...] "generally improving."

He declared, [...] "Yo, Taylor, I'm really happy for you, and I'm {{going to let you}} finish, but Beyoncé had one of the best videos of all time." [...] West was profusely criticized from celebrities and fans alike over the incident. Following the interruption, the status of Fame Kills was rumored to be in question. A representative from an US urban radio station commented: [...] "I think this could potentially affect his upcoming tour with Lady Gaga. This isn't an urban tour— urban audiences can <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> forgiving than mainstream audiences are. I can see him going on stage and people booing him. It's unfortunate." [...] Less than a week after the ticket sales began, the tour was canceled but no reason was given.|$|E
500|$|The {{competition}} between Kieswetter and Buttler for England's one-day wicket-keeping role also caused conflict at Somerset for the 2013 season: both players wanted to fulfil the {{role for the}} county. Kieswetter began the season as the wicket-keeper in the County Championship, but broke his thumb during the third match of the season, which {{kept him out of}} action for six weeks. Kieswetter had a particularly strong Twenty20 season, finishing as the leading run-scorer in the 2013 Friends Life t20 with , including five half-centuries. His teammate, Peter Trego, praised Kieswetter's ability to build big innings in Twenty20 cricket, and Kieswetter himself said that he [...] "tried to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> of a responsible player, rather than just power blazing." [...] He scored a late-season century against Warwickshire in the County Championship, but in a season in which Somerset struggled against relegation, he scored a relatively modest 606 first-class runs at an average of 31.89. At the end of the season, Buttler, whose contract with Somerset had expired, announced that he was joining Lancashire, leaving Kieswetter as the clear first-choice wicket-keeper at Somerset.|$|E

On March 5, 2010, the 2010–11 team {{had a chance}} to clinch an outright 2010–11 Ivy League men's basketball season championship, but lost to Harvard who clinched a share of the title. Following the game, Johnson made his team sit on the bench and watch the Harvard fans celebrate. [...] On March 8, Princeton defeated Penn to force a one-game playoff at the Payne Whitney Gymnasium in New Haven, Connecticut. On March 12, Princeton earned the Ivy League's automatic bid to the 2011 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament, making the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament {{for the first time since}} 2004 and 24th time in school history by defeating Harvard 63–62. Princeton was awarded the number thirteen seed and a first round match against the Kentucky Wildcats. Kentucky had eliminated Ivy League representative Cornell the prior season. [...] Kentucky emerged victorious by a 59–57 margin on a last second layup. He was named as a finalist for the Hugh Durham Award, the Ben Jobe Award, and the Skip Prosser Award.|$|E

500|$|Appearing {{in series}} two, Ianto assists {{the team in}} field {{missions}} and {{is used by the}} writers as a vehicle for one-liner jokes. Commenting on this, portrayer Gareth David-Lloyd notes that [...] "This season it's much more relaxed and he's not all about keeping secrets, he's about Torchwood and Jack— he's found his meaning and his place so his dry humour comes out a lot more and he's happier." [...] The developments in Ianto's character were also reflected in the wardrobe choice. [...] "For series two," [...] comments Ray Holman, [...] "we evolved the look quite a lot, and now his suits {{come from all over the}} place. It's just a question of where I see something that looks right for Gareth, so I've brought him a suit from Savile Row and suits from Zara and Next. We realised we could <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> flash with Ianto now he's come out of the background and started to assert himself a bit more. So we moved him into coloured shirts and snazzier ties. He started off in white and grey shirts but we realised his skin tones can take the extra colour and now he's evolving into something much sharper, which looks really good filmed in high definition." ...|$|E
500|$|Although xx {{had been}} highly {{anticipated}} by XL, the album's success exceeded expectations in the press. McDonald said their direction and sound {{would have been}} entirely different had expectations been higher. Croft was [...] "baffled" [...] by the acclaim given to what she viewed as an album they had made [...] "for themselves". Sim had mixed feelings about its success and believed it could affect his songwriting in the future: [...] "This album was done with no expectations. No one knew who we were. When I was writing the songs, I didn't think anyone other than Romy or James would ever actually hear them. Now I know so many people will. I might feel I have to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> private." [...] At the Mercury Prize ceremony, he said the time since its release has [...] "felt like a haze", but that the event serves as [...] "a moment of clarity". In their acceptance speech, the band announced they would use the £20,000 prize money {{to build their own}} studio, where they subsequently wrote and recorded their second album Coexist. When Coexist debuted in September 2012, xx was still on the British chart at number 37 and had sold 446,734 copies in the UK. The following year, it was ranked number 237 on NMEs list of the top 500 albums of all time and named the 74th greatest debut record by Rolling Stone, who found its music radical as [...] "an exercise in restraint, in the artful use of space and silence" [...] during popular music's period of maximalism.|$|E
500|$|The {{starting}} {{title track}} of Crime Cutz derived its title {{from a person}} {{of the same name}} who gave Holy Ghost! a drum break {{to be used in the}} song; it was not included in the final mix, however. It begins with [...] "spacey" [...] synthesizers, before the acoustic drum beat kicks in around a minute into the song. Halfway into the song, diva vocals from the East Coast Inspirational Singers group join in, which Frankel, [...] "literally found them on the internet. We met up the next day, and it was awesome and really moving to hear them sing. In general we've tried to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> off the cuff when recording recently, [...] a last minute addition while mixing the song." [...] Sequenced synth arpeggios, [...] "super-dry" [...] guitars, and falsetto lead vocals are also present in the arrangement. [...] "Stereotype" [...] is about the band's self-awareness and pride towards them being of a very well-known musical genre, singing in a mournful tone that [...] "I know I'm a stereotype, don't be so critical [...] Let go." [...] In the track's first draft, the drum parts and chord progression were developed first. Holy Ghost! traveled to Los Angeles to work with DJ and production duo Oliver on the song, but with little success in making the type of track Holy Ghost! wanted it to be. It was not until Oliver created a bassline for the duo that Holy Ghost! reworked the arrangement of the song into what would be the final mix that ended up on Crime Cutz.|$|E

In fact, the story that biographer Renee relates seems to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> complex. Vaughan was frequently accompanied by a friend, Doris Robinson, on her trips into New York City. In the fall of 1942, by which time she was 18 years old, Vaughan suggested that Robinson enter the Apollo Theater Amateur Night contest. Vaughan played piano accompaniment for Robinson, who won second prize. Vaughan later {{decided to go back}} and compete as a singer herself. She sang [...] "Body and Soul", and won—although the exact date of this victorious performance is uncertain. The prize, as Vaughan recalled later to Marian McPartland, was $10 and the promise of a week's engagement at the Apollo. After a considerable delay, Vaughan was contacted by the Apollo in the spring of 1943 to open for Ella Fitzgerald.|$|E
