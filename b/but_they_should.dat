5|$|After hearing {{news that}} Syed {{is trying to}} find his wife Amira Shah (Preeya Kalidas), Yusef visits her father, Qadim (Ramon Tikaram) at his office and offers to avenge his family for causing Amira pain. When Zainab and Yusef attend an event together, people assume they are married and Zainab does not correct them. Afterwards, Yusef admits to Zainab that he has great {{feelings}} for her <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> maintain some distance as she is married. Yusef continues to manipulate Zainab and ply her with pills, but she says she wishes to stop taking them, so Yusef crushes up a bottle of pills and conceals them in Zainab's food. Zainab passes out and is hospitalised, with her family believing she took a deliberate overdose, as was Yusef's plan. Concerned that he himself is causing Zainab's worries, Masood divorces Zainab by saying the triple talaq.|$|E
5|$|It is a {{particularly}} poignant melody that should play with an audience's emotions. The mistress clearly {{knew what she was}} doing sleeping with an older man, and yet there is something expletive about it as well. Eva's bitchiness should be enjoyed by an audience, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> also be investing in the plight of a young girl's eviction. The narrative of this section is so well structured that it is obvious the journey of the mistress is complete by her exit. This allows the audience to invest in a single moment while also learning more about Eva and Peron's character as they move forward in the story.|$|E
25|$|Leitkultur (core culture): A model {{developed}} in Germany by Bassam Tibi. The {{idea is that}} minorities can have an identity of their own, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> at least support the core concepts of the culture on which the society is based.|$|E

25|$|Truffles {{were rarely}} {{used during the}} Middle Ages. Truffle hunting is {{mentioned}} by Bartolomeo Platina, the papal historian, in 1481, when he recorded that the sows of Notza were without equal in hunting truffles, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> be muzzled {{to prevent them from}} eating the prize.|$|E
25|$|The father welcomes {{him back}} and {{celebrate}}s his return. The older son refuses to participate. The father reminds the older son {{that one day he}} will inherit everything. <b>But,</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> still celebrate the return of the younger son because he was lost and is now found.|$|E
25|$|Gingrich {{supports}} {{an expanded}} temporary worker program, {{with a special}} open-ended visa for high value workers. He believes workers who immigrated illegally but have family and a clean criminal record should have first opportunity to get temporary worker visas, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> be required {{to return to their}} country of origin to get the visa.|$|E

25|$|The {{question}} {{of the origin of}} man's body from pre-existing and living matter is a legitimate matter of inquiry for natural science. Catholics are free to form their own opinions, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> do so cautiously; they should not confuse fact with conjecture, and they should respect the Church's right to define matters touching on Revelation.|$|E
25|$|Surgery was {{formally}} taught in Italy {{even though it}} was initially looked down upon as a lower form of medicine. The most important figure of the formal learning of surgery was Guy de Chauliac. He insisted that a proper surgeon should have a specific knowledge of the human body such as anatomy, food and diet of the patient, and other ailments that may have affected the patients. Not only should surgeons have knowledge about the body <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> also be well versed in the liberal arts. In this way, surgery was no longer regarded as a lower practice, but instead began to be respected and gain esteem and status.|$|E
25|$|North Korean People's Liberation Front {{claims that}} it has support and {{contacts}} within disaffected officers of the Korean People's Army, but analysts are not convinced of this. They also claim to have contacts within the police of North Korea. Hankuk University of Foreign Studies professor Namkung Young says {{that members of the}} organization know the North Korean situation well, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> be more realistic with their goals. Furthermore, he noted that South Korean support for the organization could increase tensions between the governments. A U.S. military analyst was unaware of any independent sources supporting the claims that the North Korean military would be discontent enough to attempt a coup.|$|E

25|$|The new {{republic}} faced {{a dispute over}} the Åland Islands, which were overwhelmingly Swedish-speaking and sought retrocession to Sweden. However, as Finland {{was not willing to}} cede the islands, they were offered an autonomous status. Nevertheless, the residents did not approve the offer, and the dispute over the islands was submitted to the League of Nations. The League decided that Finland should retain sovereignty over the Åland Islands, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> be made an autonomous province. Thus Finland was under an obligation to ensure the residents of the Åland Islands a right to maintain the Swedish language, as well as their own culture and local traditions. At the same time, an international treaty was concluded on the neutral status of Åland, under which it was prohibited to place military headquarters or forces on the islands.|$|E

These orders have been promulgated to the Spanish, the Indians, the Mulattos, the Mestizos, and the Blacks, and those who don't respect them will be punished".|$|E
500|$|Hurley, Jin and Sawyer raid the van {{and find}} maps and beer. Meanwhile, Hurley tells Charlie to stop moping and help him start the car, saying that he might die doing it <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> make their own luck, face death, and {{possibly}} win. Hurley eventually convinces the others to push the van to a slope {{in order to get}} it started. Despite Sawyer's warnings, Hurley goes through with the plan. Charlie declares [...] "victory or death" [...] and rides with Hurley, as Sawyer and Jin push the vehicle down the steep hill. At first it looks as though they will crash, but the van starts just in time. Later, the entire group enjoys a ride.|$|E

500|$|Steam devils are {{vortices}} typically about 50 to 200 metres in diameter, essentially vertical, {{and up to}} 500 metres high. [...] The general {{shape is}} like a small waterspout <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> not be considered related. [...] Steam devils rotate with a cyclonic direction of motion, but not very fast or powerfully, usually just a few rotations per minute, and sometimes apparently not at all. [...] There is usually a well-defined inner part of the rotating column of steam and a more ragged outer part from which clumps of steam often detach. [...] Rather smaller steam devils can form over small lakes, especially the warm water in the hot springs of geyser basins. [...] In these cases typical dimensions are a metre or so diameter, but can vary from less than 0.1 to 2 metres, and a height of 2 to 30 metres with a somewhat faster rotation of 60 rpm or so. [...] The central core of the steam devil can be clear, {{in the same sense}} that the centre of a dust devil is clear of dust. [...] The core is around 10% of the width of the rotating column. [...] The sky above the steam devils may be clear, or there may be cumulus clouds present. [...] In some cases the steam devils may rise directly into the cumulus, in these cases the cumulus may actually be caused by the steam devils - see below. [...] Steam devils are a rare and short-lived phenomenon, typically surviving no more than three or four minutes, and the smaller ones over hot springs dissipating in a matter of seconds.Bluestein, p.151Holle (2007), p.9Lyons & Pease, pp.236-237Zurn-Birkhimer et al., p.2431 ...|$|E

2500|$|Beta {{blockers}} are the first-line {{treatment for}} patients with acute and chronic aortic dissection.

[...] Vasodilators such as sodium nitroprusside can be considered {{for patients with}} ongoing hypertension, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> never be used alone, as they generally cause reflex tachycardia.|$|E
