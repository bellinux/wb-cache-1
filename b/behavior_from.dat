5|$|Near Adelaide, in South Australia, three {{bottlenose}} dolphins 'tail-walk', whereby they {{elevate the}} upper part of their bodies vertically out of the water, and propel themselves along the surface with powerful tail movements. Tail-walking mostly arises via human training in dolphinaria. In the 1980s, a female from the local population was kept at a local dolphinarium for three weeks, and the scientist suggests she copied the tail-walking <b>behavior</b> <b>from</b> other dolphins. Two other wild adult female dolphins have now copied it from her.|$|E
5|$|Occasionally {{a hospice}} {{will be unable}} to provide care to a patient, either due to {{philosophical}} differences with the patient or due to a safety issue. Such causes could include disruptive or abusive <b>behavior</b> <b>from</b> the patient or other persons in the patient's home or refusal to cooperate with the hospice program. Patients may, after being discharged from hospice for any reason, re-enroll in hospice at a later date as necessary.|$|E
5|$|So-called lobtail feeding was {{observed}} in the North Atlantic. This technique involves the whale slapping {{the surface of the}} ocean with its tail between one and four times before creating the bubble net. Using network-based diffusion analysis, the study authors argued that these whales learned the <b>behavior</b> <b>from</b> other whales in the group over a period of 27 years in response to a change in the primary form of prey.|$|E

In some colonies of the ponerine ant Platythyrea punctata, the presence of CHCs in new reproductive workers triggered aggressive <b>behavior</b> <b>from</b> {{the rest of the}} colony, often between new and old reproductive workers. Specifically, the old reproductive workers rubbed a marker hydrocarbon on the antennae of the new females, identifying them as rivals and targets for aggression.|$|E
5|$|The Old Poor Law was {{a parish}} based system, there were around 15,000 such parishes {{based upon the}} area around a parish church. The system allowed for despotic <b>behavior</b> <b>from</b> the Overseers of the Poor but as Overseers of the Poor would know their paupers they were {{considered}} able to differentiate between the deserving and undeserving poor making the system both more humane and initially more efficient. The Elizabethan Poor Law operated {{at a time when}} the population was small enough for everyone to know everyone else, therefore people's circumstances would be known and the idle poor would be unable to claim on the parishes' poor rate. The system provided social stability yet by 1750 needed to be adapted to cope with population increases, greater mobility and regional price variations.|$|E
5|$|The Supremes' {{name change}} fueled already present {{rumors of a}} solo career for Ross {{and contributed to the}} {{professional}} and personal dismantling of the group. In fact, Gordy intended to replace Ross with Barbara Randolph as early as the fall of 1966, but changed his mind and instead kept Ross in the group for several more years. Gordy's caution may have been sparked by an incident in early 1966 as the group prepared to make their second appearance at the Copacabana. Angered by erratic <b>behavior</b> <b>from</b> Florence Ballard, Gordy intended to replace her with Marlene Barrow, a member of the Motown in-house singing group the Andantes. However, when club management heard of this change, they threatened to cancel the group's appearance if Ballard was replaced, as they saw Ballard's banter with her group mates as a major part of their act's success.|$|E

In the present study, an attempt was made to identify specific, patient behaviors which might be related to physician judgment of a good patient and progress of treatment. A checklist of 37 behaviors was compiled. A series of 100 patients was observed during their interaction with physicians and occurrences of <b>behaviors</b> <b>from</b> the checklist were noted by an experimenter. Physicians also indicated whether the patient was considered to be a good patient and whether treatment was progressing as expected.

40|$|Linear {{systems are}} well {{understood}} and completely predictable, whatever the initial state {{and no matter}} what is the system dimension. But if the system is nonlinear then different situation will be faced, and the theory of linear systems no longer is valid. It has been shown that the resulting <b>behaviors</b> <b>from</b> simple rules might emerge to form very complicated structure [6][10]. For example, the emerging <b>behaviors</b> <b>from</b> non-linear continuous time system or the emerging <b>behaviors</b> <b>from</b> hybrid systems or even from cellular automata can be theoretically intractrable.

25|$|During the {{classical}} period of economics, microeconomics was {{closely linked to}} psychology. For example, Adam Smith wrote The Theory of Moral Sentiments, which proposed psychological explanations of individual behavior, including concerns about fairness and justice, and Jeremy Bentham wrote extensively on the psychological underpinnings of utility. However, during the development of neo-classical economics economists sought to reshape the discipline as a natural science, deducing economic <b>behavior</b> <b>from</b> assumptions {{about the nature of}} economic agents.

40|$|Programming robot or virtual agent {{behaviors}} can be {{a challenging}} task, and makes attractive the prospect of automatically learning the <b>behaviors</b> <b>from</b> {{the actions of a}} human demonstrator. However, learning complex <b>behaviors</b> rapidly <b>from</b> a demonstrator may be difficult if they demand a large number of training samples. We describe an architecture for rapid learning of recurrent <b>behaviors</b> <b>from</b> demonstration. The architecture is based on deterministic hierarchical finitestate automata (HFAs) with classification algorithms taking the place of the state transition function. This architecture allows for task decomposition, statefulness, parameterized features and behaviors, per-behavior feature set customization, and storage of learned behaviors in libraries to be used later on as elements in more complex behaviors. We describe the system, then illustrate its application in a simple, but nontrivial, foraging task involving multiple behaviors...|$|R
