500|$|Moyler {{felt that}} the {{combination}} of [...] "I Can't Go for That" [...] and [...] "You Make My Dreams" [...] was [...] "an abomination" [...] and [...] "New Directions at their worst". He summarized: [...] "The outfits are hokey, the dance is silly, and the music has absolutely no emotion in it." [...] Slezak, however, issued the performance an [...] "A–" [...] grade, and wrote, [...] "The Troubletones beat New Directions in this particular battle, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> the frothy, silly spirit of this number, with the guys dressed like Miami Vice extras, Puck and Blaine rocking Oatestaches, and Tina getting a little moment on lead vocals." [...] Votta characterized the performance as a [...] "fun, retro number", and Jen Chaney of The Washington Post was similarly pleased, and gave it a [...] "B+".|$|E
500|$|He {{looked through}} the Yellow Pages for jobs and played at bar mitzvahs for $125; he later said [...] " [...] was glad to do it." [...] Weinberg became the live drummer for 10,000 Maniacs in 1992 after their drummer Jerry Augustyniak was injured five days before a five-week tour. He went after that {{assignment}} once he heard it was open and later said, [...] "I lived on a bus and had a roommate. Not exactly like the E Street Band, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> it. It reminded me that I am a drummer and I'm good. I was put here to play the drums. To {{turn my back on}} that ability was wrong." [...] He played at the January 1993 inauguration of Bill Clinton. Weinberg auditioned in 1993 to be the principal drummer on the Broadway show The Who's Tommy, but was selected instead as the second substitute. Despite the very low pay, Weinberg was nevertheless happy: [...] "I'd buried drumming so far into my psyche. I felt I'd resurrected it." [...] Of Springsteen's work, Weinberg felt [...] "that I would never get to play these songs again." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{track was}} {{released}} {{as the second}} single from the parent album on May 6, 1998 in the United States. Curtiss {{was not aware of}} the fact that Madonna had recorded [...] "Sepheryn" [...] as [...] "Ray of Light" [...] and heard it for the first time being played on the radio. He [...] "couldn't believe it" [...] and was initially a bit annoyed, but became pleased with what Madonna had done with his original composition. He was also satisfied with the 15% royalties he received as songwriter credit. Madonna took 30% royalties, another 15% were given to Maldoon's estate and the rest were earned by Madonna's record company. The singer said about the song: [...] "It's totally out of control. The original version is well over 10 minutes long. It was completely indulgent, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> it. It was heartbreaking to cut it down to a manageable length." [...] The original version was to be included on a compilation album, titled Veronica Electronica, although it was not released. Curtiss confirmed in an interview with The Australian in January 2017, that he recorded a contemporary jazz version of [...] "Sepheryn".|$|E

500|$|What Love Is Made Of" [...] was premiered during Irish DJ Annie Mac's eponymous {{program on}} BBC Radio 1, on 10 May 2013, though its digital {{download}} only occurred on 5 July 2013. It was serviced as an extended play, {{where it was}} bundled with three remixes, by MK (Mark Kinchen), Felix da Housecat and Brackles. The song was ultimately excluded from Katy's second studio album, entitled Little Red. During an interview with Clash, Katy was asked about why she had not included the song in the album's track listing. To that question, she responded: [...] "I just felt that I wanted to put some music out there, really. Like, 'Aaliyah' from Danger EP is on the album, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> collaborating with Jessie Ware. But [...] {{means a lot to}} me , so I wanted to get it out there, regardless of whether it was on the album." [...] Having a length of three minutes and fifty-five seconds (3:55), [...] "What Love Is Made Of" [...] is an uptempo dance and house track that has been described as [...] "rave-y" [...] and [...] "trance-y". Its instrumentation contains the sounds of pianos and synthesizers. Jordan Sargent of Spin observed that it continued the musical style first introduced in Katy's 2012 extended play (EP), Danger EP, which was [...] "straight-forward house". Idolator's Sam Lansky compared her performance in the song to recording artist Siobhán Donaghy.|$|E

[...] "I'm accustomed to being the oldest person at a gig," [...] said Poster, [...] "but when I went to see Skrillex at Roseland this year, it was dramatic.

[...] He won a scholarship to the opera course at the Royal Academy of Music, where both his sister Nanna and mezzo-soprano Katherine Jenkins were at the time. At the Academy, roles he sang included Florville in Il signor Bruschino and Fenton in Verdi's Falstaff.|$|E
2500|$|Early in {{his career}} at Hardin–Simmons, Turner and {{teammate}} A. J. Roy encouraged each other in practice sessions by referring to each other by nicknames. Turner was given the nickname [...] "Bulldog", and Roy was known as [...] "Tiger". Turner later recalled his college experience as follows: [...] "We got room, board and tuition, {{but we had to}} buy our own books and we were supposed to take care of two jobs. I had to sweep out the gym and wait tables, but I kind of farmed out the sweeping after a while. It was tough <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> it.

So this MC started calling me Evil John to {{differentiate}} us. This was when I was doing Dracula and chains. At the same time I had a girlfriend who called herself Angel when she did strip shows. She was a very nasty girl and I suggested that she call herself Evil Angel. She didn't, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> the name and wound up using it for my company." ...|$|E

2500|$|Since their Live 8 {{appearance}} in 2005, Gilmour has repeatedly {{said that there}} will be no Pink Floyd reunion. With the death of Pink Floyd keyboardist Richard Wright in September 2008, another reunion of the core group members became impossible. After Wright's death, his surviving former bandmates praised him for his influence on the sound of Pink Floyd. Gilmour said of Wright: [...] "In the welter of arguments about who or what was Pink Floyd, Rick's enormous input was frequently forgotten. He was gentle, unassuming and private but his soulful voice and playing were vital, magical components of our most recognised Pink Floyd sound. Like Rick, I don't find it easy to express my feelings in words, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> him and will miss him enormously. I have never played with anyone quite like him." ...|$|E
2500|$|After the war, {{he wrote}} a {{denunciation}} of war titled Peace with Honour (1934), which he retracted somewhat with 1940's War with Honour. During World War II, Milne {{was one of the}} most prominent critics of fellow English writer P. G. Wodehouse, who was captured at his country home in France by the Nazis and imprisoned for a year. Wodehouse made radio broadcasts about his internment, which were broadcast from Berlin. Although the light-hearted broadcasts made fun of the Germans, Milne accused Wodehouse of committing an act of near treason by cooperating with his country's enemy. Wodehouse got some revenge on his former friend (e.g., in The Mating Season) by creating fatuous parodies of the Christopher Robin poems in some of his later stories, and claiming that Milne [...] "was probably jealous of all other writers.... <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> his stuff." ...|$|E
2500|$|During World War II, Round {{became a}} fighter {{pilot in the}} Royal Air Force and was posted to Canada and then the No. 1 British Flying Training School in Terrell, Texas, serving as a flying {{instructor}} for the United States Air Force.

I had my own plane so I would fly down 300 miles to San Antonio for an 11 a.m. service, I would sing and then I would fly back home in the evening." [...] He also performed on the radio and was offered the chance to appear as a guest in a college production in Dallas, playing Canio in Pagliacci. [...] "It was my first time in any type of production <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> it." [...] Round was offered a place at a music school in New York, but turned it down to return home to England in 1943.|$|E

2500|$|Ivana Baquero as Ofelia / Princess Moanna, a {{child who}} comes to believe she is the reincarnation of a princess from the underworld. Del Toro said he was nervous about casting the lead role, and that finding the 10-year-old Spanish actress was purely accidental. (The film was shot from June–October 2005, when she was 11.) [...] "The {{character}} I wrote was initially younger, about 8 or 9, and Ivana came in {{and she was a}} little older than the character, with this curly hair which I never imagined the girl having. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> her first reading, my wife was crying and the camera woman was crying after her reading and I knew hands down Ivana was the best actress that had shown up, yet I knew that I needed to change the screenplay to accommodate her age." [...] Baquero says that Del Toro sent her lots of comics and fairy tales to help her [...] "get more into the atmosphere of Ofelia and more into what she felt". She says she thought the film was [...] "marvelous", and that [...] "at the same time it can bring you pain, and sadness, and scariness, and happiness".|$|E
