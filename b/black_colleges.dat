Results showed that some {{significant differences were found}} between <b>Black</b> and White <b>college</b> females. Of the 46 items on the Body Cathexis Scale, significant differences between <b>Black</b> and White <b>college</b> females were found on seven items with five indicating higher satisfaction of <b>Black</b> <b>college</b> females and two indicating that White college females had higher satisfaction. Of the five measurements of ideal female figure, only one differed significantly with the <b>Black</b> <b>college</b> females possessing a less restrictive measurement.
