5|$|Fourteen horses {{started at}} the 2013 Belmont Stakes. Oxbow drew the number seven post position, with rival Orb at post five. There were {{concerns}} about Stevens' fitness as he had missed races after <b>being</b> <b>thrown</b> from a horse the previous week, but medical tests {{showed no sign of}} injury. Oxbow was the third favorite at 5–1 on the morning line, but by race time his odds were at 10–1.|$|E

5|$|Fuses: Documented {{evidence}} suggests that the earliest fuses were first used by the Chinese between the 10th and 12th centuries. After the Chinese had invented gunpowder, they began adapting its explosive properties for use in military technology. By 1044 they were using gunpowder in simple grenades, bombs, and flamethrowers, all of which required a fuse to be lit before <b>being</b> <b>thrown</b> at the enemy.|$|E
5|$|In 1947, a {{nationwide}} uprising against French colonial rule was initiated in Moramanga, {{a town in}} Bezanozano territory neighboring the Betsimisaraka. During the conflict, Betsimisaraka nationalists fought French and Senegalese soldiers in an unsuccessful attempt {{to regain control of}} the port at Tamatave, the island's most important trading port. Betsimisaraka fighters and civilians suffered very heavy losses and some of the worst human rights abuses, including execution by <b>being</b> <b>thrown</b> alive from airplanes.|$|E
5|$|In mid-August, Yost moved Braun {{from third}} in the batting order to cleanup, {{switching}} him with Prince Fielder. The move was expected to allow Braun to steal more, as batting before Fielder was not conducive to him risking <b>being</b> <b>thrown</b> out on steal attempts. Additionally, successfully stealing a base would hypothetically allow opponents to intentionally walk Fielder and avoid pitching to him. At {{the end of the}} month, however, Yost reverted to his previous batting order.|$|E

40|$|Over the years, {{simulation}} {{models have been}} successfully built to observe the behavior of systems. Despite advances {{in the field and}} its growth in popularity, when simulation is to be introduced to an organization, there are challenges to be met including acceptance by staff, availability of staff to describe the various operations, existence of useful data, and management expectations. Organizations are continuously collecting data, which may lead one to believe that developing stochastic models of an organization’s activities should be easy. However, elicitation of useful information may end up being a major bottleneck because usually the information system collecting such data is not designed for stochastic modeling. Unrealistic management expectations may result in simulation modeling <b>being</b> <b>throw...</b>|$|R
5|$|The Zong {{massacre}} {{has inspired}} several works of literature. Fred D'Aguiar's novel Feeding the Ghosts (1997) {{tells the story}} of an African who survives <b>being</b> <b>thrown</b> overboard from the Zong. In the novel, the journal of the slave—Mintah—is lost, unlike that of Granville Sharp. According to the cultural historian Anita Rupprecht, this signifies the silencing of African voices about the massacre.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} these circles {{were built in the}} area around modern Dorset, {{typically}} being smaller than those found elsewhere. Most of these Dorset circles are made of sarsen stone, although the Rempstone circle is unique in being made from local sandstone. The southern half of the circle has been destroyed, with five upright and three recumbent stones remaining extant. Having been damaged by eighteenth century clay workings, the monument is at present situated within dense woodland. In 1957, a possible avenue of stones leading to the circle was discovered by ploughing but subsequently removed. Local folklore holds that the stones arrived in their position after <b>being</b> <b>thrown</b> at Corfe Castle by the Devil.|$|E
5|$|Complicating the picture, Reagan {{suffered}} {{an episode of}} head trauma in July 1989, five years before his diagnosis. After <b>being</b> <b>thrown</b> from a horse in Mexico, a subdural hematoma was found and surgically treated later in the year. Nancy Reagan, citing what doctors told her, asserted that her husband's 1989 fall hastened the onset of Alzheimer's disease, although acute brain injury has not been conclusively proven to accelerate Alzheimer's or dementia. Reagan's one-time physician Daniel Ruge has said it is possible, but not certain, that the horse accident affected the course of Reagan's memory.|$|E

5|$|Executive {{producer}} R. W. Goodwin recalls {{being on}} {{location for the}} episode's opening scene, in which Detective Barbala is thrown from a window. The room used for the scene had two windows side-by-side, and one had been replaced with sugar glass for the stunt. When the false window was blown out to simulate someone <b>being</b> <b>thrown</b> through it, the crew found that the glass window beside the false one had also accidentally been blown out. The episode's key grip, Al Campbell, suggested that the next shot show Barbala's dog lying beside his body to explain the second window breaking.|$|E
5|$|For {{short-range}} missile (throwing) weapons, a Roman infantryman {{would probably}} had either a long throwing-spear {{or two or}} three short javelins (lanceae) and half a dozen plumbatae (weighted darts) with an effective range of about 30m. Ammianus talks of a variety of missiles <b>being</b> <b>thrown</b> by the Alamanni in the battle: spicula (a kind of long pilum-type javelin, also known as an angon), verruta missilia (short throwing-spears) and ferratae arundines (probably darts and franciscas: throwing-axes). Overall, there appears little difference in the throwing-missile capability of the contenders. Ammianus indicates that the Roman infantry ranks were obliged to hold their shields above their heads for much of the time due to the volume of missiles raining down on them.|$|E
5|$|In 1979 Tonelli {{failed to}} defend his US title in the 100m backstroke, but managed third in the event at the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Championships in his final year of university. In his four years at Alabama, he was an eight-time All-American in the 100m and 200m backstroke. His triumph at the NCAA Championships came amid the {{backdrop}} of a teammate's death in a waterskiing accident during a social event {{with a group of}} fellow swimmers. Tonelli was driving the powerboat when he did a U-turn that resulted in his teammate <b>being</b> <b>thrown</b> off his skis and into the water. The boat's propellor then struck the man, who died due to severe cuts and blood loss.|$|E

General Manager Theodore Long {{informed}} the pair {{that they would}} instead be facing Kane and The Undertaker later that night in a match, which Kane and The Undertaker won. At the Royal Rumble, the Royal Rumble match was held, where the winner is the final person left in the ring after the other twenty nine wrestlers are eliminated by <b>being</b> <b>thrown</b> over the top ring rope. The Undertaker won the Royal Rumble match to earn a title shot at WrestleMania 23. At WrestleMania, he defeated Batista to win the World Heavyweight Championship and maintain his WrestleMania undefeated streak.|$|E
5|$|Some of the city's necessities such as coal {{arrived by}} barge, but most came by road. Carts, carriages, horses and {{pedestrians}} were crowded {{together and the}} gateways in the wall formed bottlenecks through which {{it was difficult to}} progress. The nineteen-arch London Bridge was even more congested. The better-off used hackney carriages and sedan chairs to get to their destinations without getting filthy. The poor walked, and might be splashed by the wheeled vehicles and drenched by slops <b>being</b> <b>thrown</b> out and water falling from the overhanging roofs. Another hazard was the choking black smoke belching forth from factories which made soap, from breweries and iron smelters and from about 15,000 houses burning coal.|$|E
5|$|The 1993 season saw long-time Red Sox fan {{favorite}} Wade Boggs defect to the Yankees after eleven {{seasons with}} Boston. Later in September 1993, the Yankees defeated Boston at Yankee Stadium via a last-moment reprieve. Trailing 3–1, Mike Stanley's apparent fly out {{with two outs}} in the ninth was nullified by a fan running onto the field prior to the pitch <b>being</b> <b>thrown.</b> The umpire had called time and when play resumed, Stanley singled. The Yankees would rally to score three runs and win on a Mattingly single.|$|E

5|$|To silence Luna, Aguinaldo {{appointed}} him as Chief of War Operations on 26 September 1898, and assigned {{the rank of}} brigadier general. In quick succession, he was made the Director or Assistant Secretary of War and Supreme Chief of the Republican Army on 28 September, arousing {{the envy of the}} other generals who were fighting since {{the first phase of the}} Revolution. Meanwhile, Luna felt that bureaucratic placebos were <b>being</b> <b>thrown</b> his way, when all he wanted was to organize and discipline the enthusiastic but ill-fed and ill-trained troops into a real army.|$|E
