40|$|Abstract Background There is {{a paucity}} of {{epidemiological}} data on <b>neck</b> <b>injury</b> in amateur rugby union populations. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the incidence, severity, aetiology and type of <b>neck</b> <b>injury</b> in Australian men's amateur rugby union. Methods Data was collected from a cohort of 262 participants from two Australian amateur men's rugby union clubs via a prospective cohort study design. A modified version of the Rugby Union Injury Report Form for Games and Training was used by the clubs physiotherapist or chiropractor in data collection. Results The participants sustained 90 (eight recurrent) <b>neck</b> <b>injuries.</b> Exposure time was calculated at 31143. 8 hours of play (12863. 8 hours of match time and 18280 hours of training). Incidence of <b>neck</b> <b>injury</b> was 2. 9 injuries/ 1000 player-hours (95 %CI: 2. 3, 3. 6). As a consequence 69. 3 % <b>neck</b> <b>injuries</b> were minor, 17 % mild, 6. 8 % moderate and 6. 8 % severe. Neck compression was the most frequent aetiology and was weakly associated with severity. Cervical facet injury was the most frequent <b>neck</b> <b>injury</b> type.

40|$|Abstract Background A {{cautious}} outlook towards <b>neck</b> <b>injuries</b> {{has been}} the norm to avoid missing cervical spine injuries. Consequently {{there has been an}} increased use of cervical spine radiography. The Canadian Cervical Spine rule was proposed to reduce unnecessary use of cervical spine radiography in alert and stable patients. Our aim was to see whether applying the Canadian Cervical Spine rule reduced the need for cervical spine radiography without missing significant cervical spine injuries. Methods This was a retrospective study conducted in 2 hospitals. 114 alert and stable patients who had cervical spine radiographs <b>for</b> suspected <b>neck</b> <b>injuries</b> were included in the study. Data on patient demographics, high risk & low risk factors as per the Canadian Cervical Spine rule and cervical spine radiography results were collected and analysed. Results 28 patients were included in the high risk category according to the Canadian Cervical Spine rule. 86 patients fell into the low risk category. If the Canadian Cervical Spine rule was applied, {{there would have been a}} significant reduction in cervical spine radiographs as 86 / 114 patients (75. 4 %) would not have needed cervical spine radiograph. 2 / 114 patients who had significant cervical spine injuries would have been identified when the Canadian Cervical Spine rule was applied. Conclusion Applying the Canadian Cervical Spine rule <b>for</b> <b>neck</b> <b>injuries</b> in alert and stable patients would have reduced the use of cervical spine radiographs without missing out significant cervical spine injuries.

In this study, numerical analysis of {{vehicle occupant}} responses during rear impact were conducted by using a human multi-body model, a seat finite element model and crash accelerations obtained from real-world accidents. The human multi-body model was developed based on the body characteristics of a typical Japanese male, including the outer body geometry, inertial properties of body segments and passive joint characteristics. The seat finite element model was extracted from a detailed car finite element model. A small modification was done to the seat model to deal with the rear impact simulations. The crash accelerations were obtained from the drive recorder database of rear collision accidents occurred in Japan. Several crash accelerations were selected and used as input conditions during the rear impact simulations. Kinematic responses of the occupants during the accidents can be reasonably predicted by the simulations. Furthermore, different level of accelerations leads to different kinematics responses that may cause variation in injury occurrence and injury severity...|$|R

A series of tests were conducted on the AFRL/HEPA Horizontal Impulse Accelerator (HIA) using human subjects to investigate the effects of helmet inertial properties and bracing techniques on human response to short-duration frontal impacts of variable magnitude. Head accelerations were measured and neck loads and moments were calculated to compare the head and neck responses using helmets of varying weight. Headrest loads were recorded to monitor and evaluate subject bracing. The neck loads and helmet weights were also extrapolated to higher levels in order to estimate injury thresholds for pilots wearing even heavier helmets at maximum seat accelerations. The results of this study will be used to establish head/neck injury criteria for helmet-mounted systems and to improve bracing techniques to minimize pilot injury during ejections...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study}} is to investigate the extent to which doctors in emergency room situations practice defensive medicine. The frequencies at which three types of medical diagnostic procedures are requested for emergency room patients are compared across three types of hospitals that each represents a different malpractice environment. The difference in the frequencies at which tests are being performed at one particular hospital versus the control hospital (without malpractice) represents the quantification of the practice of defensive medicine when other causes of variation are controlled for. Three clinical procedures are studied: skull x-rays "for head trauma patients, cervical spine x-rays <b>for</b> <b>neck</b> <b>injury</b> patients, and computed tomography for suspected stroke patients. Primary data was gathered from the individual patient records from the selected hospitals. Various attributes were specifically selected in order to get sufficiently similar and yet a representative sample from each source. statistical test based on normal probability distribution showed that physicians practicing in hospitals with threats of malpractice ordered significantly greater numbers of tests compared to the control hospital verifying the practice of defensive medicine.

In this study we analyzed {{the impact of the}} psychosocial work environment, conceptualized by the demand-control-support model, on the incidence of low back and <b>neck</b> <b>injury</b> in a cohort of 1221 public transit operators followed for 7 years and 6 months. The two main exposure variables were "job strain" (mismatch of high psychological demands and low decision latitude) and "iso-strain" (job strain plus exposure to low social support at work). Analyses controlled for demographic factors, physical workload, and pain at baseline. For low back injuries, increased hazard rates were found for job strain and iso-strain based on tertiles, with hazard ratios (HR) of 1. 30 (95 % CI= 0. 96 - 1. 75) and 1. 41 (95 % CI= 0. 98 - 2. 01), respectively. Job strain and iso-strain based on median split or analyzed as continuous variables were not associated with low back <b>injuries.</b> <b>For</b> <b>neck</b> <b>injuries,</b> job strain and iso-strain based on median split showed HRs of 1. 27 (95 % CI= 0. 99 - 1. 63) and 1. 33 (95 % CI= 1. 01 - 1. 77), respectively. Job strain and iso-strain based on tertiles had HRs of 1. 52 (95 % CI= 1. 13 - 2. 05) and 1. 73 (95 % CI= 1. 21 - 2. 45), respectively. When analyzed as continuous variables, a one-point increase on the job strain and iso-strain scales led to an 8 % (95 % CI= 0. 98 - 1. 19) and 14 % (95 % CI= 1. 02 - 1. 27) increased hazard of <b>neck</b> <b>injuries,</b> respectively.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the work underlying this thesis was firstly to develop a <b>neck</b> <b>for</b> a new rear impact dummy, to evaluate the complete dummy and to specify test conditions for a consumer test with attention to AIS 1 <b>neck</b> <b>injuries</b> in rear impacts. In {{the development of the}} dummy neck, a mathematical neck model was developed and evaluated. Furthermore, impact severity and seat designs were also investigated. Rear collisions can result in AIS 1 <b>neck</b> <b>injuries.</b> These injuries, which are becoming more frequent, occur mostly at low changes of velocity (less than 30 km/h). Since AIS 1 <b>neck</b> <b>injuries</b> can result in long-term symptoms, it is of major importance to devise protection from these injuries. When testing the safety performance of seats and head restraints, an essential tool is the crash test dummy. However, the standard crash dummy of today, the Hybrid III, has had limitations in its interaction with the seat and head restraint. The new dummy neck developed was evaluated by using data from crash tests involving volunteers as well as post mortem human subjects. For comparison, the Hybrid III frontal impact dummy was also tested under the same conditions. The new neck was found to have more human-like motion than that of the Hybrid III in low velocity rear tests when compared to both volunteers and post mortem human subjects. This was found to be the case for the head relative to upper torso horizontal and angular displacement. The new dummy neck became a fundamental part of the new, low-velocity rear impact crash dummy, the BioRID. The BioRID was found to have more human-like motion than that of the Hybrid III in low velocity rear impact tests when compared to both volunteers and post mortem human subjects. This result was observed for angular, vertical and horizontal displacement of the upper torso. The variations in acceleration pulse characteristics in different vehicle models in identical impact conditions was shown to be substantial. A similar delta-V could be generated in a large variety of ways in terms of mean acceleration and acceleration pulse shape in a rear impact. The variation in crash pulse characteristics for the same car model from different real-world crashes of similar delta-Vs was also shown to be significant. This served as a background for the specifications of the test conditions for a proposed consumer test. Real-world rear impact collisions with crash recorder-equipped vehicles, were reconstructed on a sled reproducing the real-world crash pulse. The results illustrate the risk of sub-optimisation when using only a single test in assessing <b>neck</b> <b>injury</b> protection. Further, five different seat configurations were evaluated in a series of sled tests at four impact severities. Identical vehicle seats were found to perform differently in tests with of different severities. Changing the mean acceleration (from 4. 2 g to 7. 6 g) influenced key dummy readings more than changing the delta-V (from 15 km/h to 25 km/h). Therefore, it should be expected that different real-world rear collisions at similar delta-Vs imply highly differing loading conditions to the occupants. As a consequence, the test conditions for the proposed consumer test program included specifications for several levels of change of velocity and mean acceleration. The results of this thesis are expected to become important input in the definition of future rear impact test procedures <b>for</b> <b>neck</b> <b>injury</b> risk assessment...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} a {{mathematical}} model, based on Navier Stokes equations, {{was developed and}} validated against experimental data. This model predicts the pressure changes in the spinal canal {{as a function of}} the volume change inside the canal during neck bending in the x-z (sagittal) plane. Another aim of the study was to investigate pressure phenomena and ganglion <b>injuries</b> at static <b>neck</b> extension loading and dynamic neck extension trauma with a head-restraint present. Experiments on pigs were conducted. Preliminary results indicate that ganglion injuries, as well as pressure transients inside the spinal canal, seem to correlate to the phase shift when the neck passes an s-shape (or maximal retraction) during the rearward motion of the head. That is, when the upper neck quickly changes from a flexion to an extension shape. Static loading of the neck resulted in no signs of injuries to the ganglia. A possible candidate <b>for</b> a <b>neck</b> <b>injury</b> criterion is presented, based on the relative acceleration between the top and the bottom of the cervical spine. A tolerance level based on the pig tests is also discussed...|$|R
