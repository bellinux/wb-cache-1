5|$|Agnes Mary Mansour (April 10, 1931 – December 17, 2004) was an American Roman Catholic nun who {{was given}} a choice from the Vatican in 1983 to end her {{religious}} vows or to resign from her position {{as the director of}} the Michigan Department of Social Services which required her to support and allocate public funding for abortions. The controversy involved her belief that abortion was tragic <b>but</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> legal, despite her vows as a religious and the teachings of the Catholic Church.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, {{shift workers}} have {{difficulty}} maintaining a healthy sleep-wake schedule due to night or irregular work hours. Shift {{workers need to}} be strategic about napping and drinking caffeine, as these practices may be necessary for work productivity and safety, <b>but</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> timed carefully. Because shift workers may need to sleep while other individuals are awake, additional sleeping environment changes should include reducing disturbances by turning off phones and posting signs on bedroom doors to inform others when they are sleeping.|$|E
5|$|An enhanced-potency IPV (inactivated polio vaccine) was {{licensed}} in the United States in November 1987, and {{is currently}} the vaccine of choice in the United States. The first dose of polio vaccine is given shortly after birth, usually between 1 and 2 months of age, a second dose is given at 4 months of age. The timing of the third dose depends on the vaccine formulation <b>but</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> given between 6 and 18 months of age. A booster vaccination is given at 4 to 6 years of age, {{for a total of}} four doses at or before school entry. In some countries, a fifth vaccination is given during adolescence. Routine vaccination of adults (18 years of age and older) in developed countries is neither necessary nor recommended because most adults are already immune and have a very small risk of exposure to wild poliovirus in their home countries. In 2002, a pentavalent (five-component) combination vaccine (called Pediarix) containing IPV was approved for use in the United States.|$|E

5|$|As World War II neared, Minton took a {{cautious}} position on United States involvement. When the Soviet Union invaded Finland, Minton voted against granting a loan to Finland {{to help finance}} its defense efforts. He also opposed selling munitions and weapons to the Allies or the Axis powers. He advocated and supported expanding the American military and believed that American entry into the war was inevitable, <b>but</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> delayed as long as possible. He {{voted in favor of}} the Smith Act, which made it a crime to advocate the overthrow of the government, a law specifically targeted at communists and fascists in the United States. In his final year in office, there was considerable speculation in the press that Minton would be named to higher office by Roosevelt, including cabinet positions and the Supreme Court, but neither happened.|$|E
5|$|Genetic {{analysis}} performed since the 1990s has extended {{the understanding of}} the relationship between different organisms. It is now clear the brachiopods do not belong to the Deuterostomata (such as echinoderms and chordates) as was hypothesized earlier, <b>but</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> included in the Protostomia (with mollusks and annelid worms), in a subgroup now called Lophotrochozoa. Although their adult morphology seems rather different, the nucleotid sequence of the 18S rRNA indicates that the horseshoe worms are the closest relatives of the inarticulate brachiopods rather than articulate brachiopods. For now, the weight of evidence is inconclusive as to the exact relations within the inarticulates. Consequently, it has been suggested to included horseshoe worms in the Brachiopoda as a class named Phoronata B.L.Cohen in addition to the Craniata and Lingulata, within the subphylum Linguliformea. The other subphylum Rhynchonelliformea only contains one class, which is subdivided in the orders Rhynchonellida, Terebratulida and Thecideida.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} Parliament Hill protest in Ottawa, Jack Layton {{had called for}} an {{emergency}} debate on 4 February, gathering all members of parliament at the House of Commons. It had occurred {{despite the absence of}} Prime Minister Stephen Harper. A few members of parliament, such as John McCallum and Robert Oliphant, brought up concerns of whether the aid the government sends, which was announced to be C$3 million, would successfully reach the affected civilians or not. Canada's Minister of State for the Americas Peter Kent, in an argument, suggested that extortions and funds underlying of the LTTE may still be present in Toronto. Immediately, Liberal member of parliament Jim Karygiannis assured that there were no cases of such extortions in recent times after phoning a few national security agencies. Kent reflected back, saying that both the LTTE and the Sri Lanka Army must drop their weapons in order for the war to end. Karygiannis stated that the wish of his constituency, Scarborough—Agincourt, was that the ceasefire should not be initiated by the Government of Sri Lanka or by the Government of India <b>but</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> a United Nations-initiated, internationally sponsored ceasefire. Liberal member of parliament Irwin Cotler condemned Sri Lanka's restrictions on international humanitarian aid, journalists and media to reach the affected areas of northern Sri Lanka, which has been in place for several years. He suggested to bring forth an immediate ceasefire and begin negotiation talks. The United Nations, too, were condemned for not taking an active part in ending the civil war. Deepak Obhrai, a Conservative member of parliament, was the only member to label the LTTE at fault, referring to the assassination of former Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.|$|E
