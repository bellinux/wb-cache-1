30|$|Furthermore, the S. glanis, G. cernua and C. carpio are {{not typical}} of the barbel region as they are more native to lentic {{habitats}} such as lakes and the lowlands of the Rhine. The increase in their relative abundance might be explained either by the direct connection to lentic harbours and bayous or especially by the rocky structure of the river bank which provides an excellent hiding habitat {{for at least the}} S. glanis and G. cernua. In addition, since the number of catfish was low in the Rhine in the past, this species was restocked several years ago and is now to be found in great numbers. Considering other species found more or less frequently over the 34 -odd years of investigation, it should be mentioned that fish usually migrate along the river but show a preference for a specific river section (as indicated by trout or barbel or <b>bream</b> <b>region).</b> Thus, it is probable that a fish species {{can be found in a}} river section where they are not usually abundant. The E. lucius, for example, was usually caught in the lentic harbour at the BASF SE site which in fact is the more appropriate habitat than the river itself und thus their relative low abundance compared to P. fluviatilis and S. lucioperca is not unexpected [27].|$|E
40|$|Bream (Abramis brava orientalis) {{is one of}} Cyprindae the Caspian Sea and its basin {{which has}} a special ecological, {{biological}} and economical role. Stock of this fish in the Caspian Sea has reduced during several years for different reason the over fishing, different industrial, agriculture, urban pollution and destroy of the spawning habitat. So that fishery company decided to recover the stock of this fish by the way of artificial reproduction of a Bream couple hunted from south coast of the Caspian Sea (Iran) and setting the fingerling to the rivers and inflow wetlands of the Caspian Sea. This activity has due to 20 tons Bream annual fishing in the Iranian South coast of the Caspian Sea (Gilan province coast and Anzali wetland), The artificial reproduction has decreased Bream population diversity of Caspian sea and Anzali wetland. So it has been declined to improve Braem population diversity by the entrance of Azerbijan republic Bream and encounter to the Caspian sea Bream. Meanwhile there is Bream in the Aras Dam Lake which had been forgotten by the Fishery Company of Iran. For this reason specifications morphometric, meristic and inter species Molecular Genetic have been surveyed in Anzali wetland,Southern coast of Caspian Sea,Aras Darn Lake and Azerbijan republic during 2003 - 2005. According to the research on specifications of Morphometric and Meristic of Anzali wetland(120 species),Southern coast of Caspian Sea(90 species), Aras Dam Lake(110 species) and Azerbijan Republic(125 species) has Morphometric and Meristic differences. So that average weight and total length of Anzali wetland Bream respectively was 167 g and 23 / 76 cm, 102 g and 27 / 62 cm in Caspian Sea, 461 g and 3 5 / 38 cm in Aras Darn Lake and 3 4189 g and 15 / 21 cm in Azerbijan republic (We forced to use 1 year Bream of artificial reproduction in Iran). Also variation coefficient average Morphometric, Morphometric specification Ration and meristic in Anzali wetland Bream was 17 / 45, 21 / 56 and 4 / 63, in Caspian Sea bream 22 / 58, 15 / 27 and 3124, in Aras Dam lake Lake 17145. 1. 5 / 27 and 3 / 57 and Azerbaijan republic Bream 22 / 29, 19 / 66 and 4 / 22. Also Bream of these four regions in general status had Morphometric significant differences based on One Way ANOVA Analysis. Meanwhile Anzali wetland Bream with Caspian Sea Bream from 41 Morphometric surveyed factors in 33 factors, with Aras Darn Lake Bream in 41 factors, with Azerbkjan republic Bream in 41 factors,Caspian Sea Bream with Aras Darn Lake Bream in 36 factors,with Azerbijan republic B ream in 40 factors and A ras Dam L ake Bream with Azerbijan republic Bream in 38 factors had significant statistical differences. These four <b>regions</b> <b>Bream</b> had differences according to the Morphomertric specification ration based on One Way ANOVA Analysis. Also Anzali wetland Bream was surveyed with Caspian Sea Bream from 37 factors i n 27 factors, Anzali wetland Bream with Aras Dam 1 ake in 37 factors Anzali wetland Bream with Azerbijan republic Bream in 32 factors,Caspian sea bream with Arsa Dam Lake Bream in 26 factors, Caspian Sea Bream with Azerbijan republic Bream in 29 factors and Aras Dam Lake Bream with Azerbijan republic Bream in 34 factor had significant statistical differences. Based on Meristic factor of four <b>regions</b> <b>bream</b> in 16 surveyed factors in 10 factors had meaningful differences according to the One Way ANOVA Analysis. While Anzali wetland Bream was surveyed with Caspian Sea Bream from in 3 factors,Anzali wetland Bream with Aras Dam lake in 8 factors,Anzali wetland Bream with Azerbijan republic B ream in 6 factors,Caspian Sea bream with Arsa Dam Lake Bream in 6 factors,Caspian sea Bream with Azerbijan republic Bream in 3 factors and Aras Dam Lake Bream with Azerijan republic Bream in 8 factor had significant statistical differences. Meanwihle based on Factor Analysis and Discriminant Breams had differences. Also according to the resrarchs Anzali wetland Bream in 0 + age group till 5 + (6 age groups),Caspian Sea bream in 1 + - 5 +(5 age groups),Aras Darn Lake Bream in 1 + - 7 + (7 age groups) and Azerbijan republic Bream for Morphometric and Meristic studies in 1 +age group and for molecular Genetic reaserch were in 8 +and 9 + age groups. According to the research 4 ecosystems Bream in status of same age, Aras lake Bream were bigger according to weight and length. Also in this research genetic diversity between four population was researched by PCR-RFLP technic {{on a piece of}} mitochondrion genome with the length of 3500 bp contain of tRNA-leu,tRNA-glu,ND 5 / 6,Cytb. Between 17 used enzyme. 4 enzyme, Dral, Bc 11, Haefll and Banff showed diversity in totally 6 composite haplotype was detected. Maximum nucleotide diversity by the value% 0 / 58 in Azerbijan republic Bream by all haplotype. Aras darn Lake Bream had 2 haplotype and nucleotide diversity of % 0 / 35. Anzali wetland and Caspian Sea Bream had no diversity. Statistical analysis by the usage of Monte Carlo with 1000 repeat showed significant differences between Azerbaijan Bream and other Bream(P 0 / 5) ...|$|R
