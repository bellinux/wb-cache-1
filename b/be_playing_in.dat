5|$|In the 2014 season, the United Football League {{is divided}} into two divisions, with nine teams in Division I and 12 teams in Division II. The 2009 UFL Cup was created to {{determine}} the composition of teams that will <b>be</b> <b>playing</b> <b>in</b> the league. However, new teams that did not participate in the 2009 UFL Cup will automatically join Division II.|$|E
5|$|The {{old wooden}} {{roof of the}} stand was due to be {{replaced}} {{the day after the}} Lincoln match, because it did not meet the safety regulations required for Division Two, where the team would <b>be</b> <b>playing</b> <b>in</b> the following season. Instead, it took until July 1986 for rebuilding work to begin. The ground was used for reserve team fixtures from September 1985, but only journalists and club officials were present to watch. Bradford City's senior team played home games at other grounds in West Yorkshire for 19months while Valley Parade was rebuilt. The new ground cost £2.6million to rebuild, and was reopened in December 1986.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{his agent}} Milan Ćalasan's insistence {{that his client}} would not <b>be</b> <b>playing</b> <b>in</b> the lower divisions, Žigić {{underwent}} groin surgery in the close season and resumed his Birmingham career in September. He told the Mail {{that he would be}} happy to stay and that any move would depend on the club, which was in increasing financial difficulty, wanting to sell. His first Championship goal gave Birmingham a 1–0 win against Leeds United. Early in the Europa League group match at Braga, Birmingham were awarded a penalty. In the absence of regular penalty-taker Marlon King, Žigić took on the responsibility. His attempt was saved, Braga won the match 1–0, and Birmingham finished the group one point behind them and Club Brugge so failed to qualify for the knockout rounds. Away to Leeds, Žigić scored all four in a 4–1 win, and he finished the season with eleven in the league and one in the play-off semi-final as Birmingham lost on aggregate to Blackpool.|$|E

5|$|He {{had been}} {{linked with the}} manager's {{position}} at Bradford City on numerous previous occasions, and after Colin Todd was sacked on 12 February 2007, City chairman Julian Rhodes made McCall his number one target to take over in the summer. Club captain David Wetherall temporarily took over and was later announced as caretaker manager {{for the rest of}} the 2006–07 season. On 22 May 2007, it was announced McCall would become manager of the club where he started his career, and on 1 June 2007 he assumed the position. In less than seven years since McCall's first two-game reign, serious financial problems had driven the club to the verge of closure, and although they survived the threat of oblivion, they were unable to avoid a terrible on-the-pitch decline, which continued after the financial nightmare had been relieved. On McCall's return to Valley Parade, the Bantams had just been relegated to League Two—meaning that they would <b>be</b> <b>playing</b> <b>in</b> the bottom division for the first time in 25 years. McCall set himself a target of earning promotion back to League One in his first season.|$|E
5|$|On 1 April 2008, first City's keeper Donovan Ricketts {{was blocked}} from {{coming back into}} the country {{following}} a Jamaica call-up, before City lost 2–1 at Rochdale, following a late winning goal from Rochdale's Adam Le Fondre. City returned to winnings ways four days later, when Eddie Johnson scored the only goal of a 1–0 victory over Morecambe. Johnson scored for a second successive game, three days later to secure a 1–1 draw with Barnet in a rearranged game at Valley Parade. A second successive draw on 12 April, this time 2–2 against Brentford, meant that City could no longer reach the play-offs, ensuring that they would again <b>be</b> <b>playing</b> <b>in</b> League Two during 2008–09. A late goal from Joe Colbeck on 19 April prevented a third successive draw and gave City a 2–1 victory over Grimsby Town. Colbeck was named the club's player of the season at the annual award ceremony on 23 April, but was sent off in the club's final home of the season against Milton Keynes Dons. Bradford were already 2–0 behind when Colbeck was dismissed, and despite a goal from Omar Daley, they lost 2–1, which crowned Milton Keynes as the league champions.|$|E

25|$|A 2013 {{meta-analysis}} {{reviewed the}} available data related to potential impacts of glyphosate-based herbicides on amphibians. According to the authors, the use of glyphosate-based pesticides cannot be considered the major cause of amphibian decline, the bulk of which occurred prior to {{the widespread use of}} glyphosate or in pristine tropical areas with minimal glyphosate exposure. The authors recommended further study of species- and development-stage chronic toxicity, of environmental glyphosate levels, and ongoing analysis of data relevant to determining what if any role glyphosate might <b>be</b> <b>playing</b> <b>in</b> worldwide amphibian decline, and suggest including amphibians in standardized test batteries.|$|E
