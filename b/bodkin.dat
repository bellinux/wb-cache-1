5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1956 the town came to {{national}} and worldwide attention, when Dr John <b>Bodkin</b> Adams, a general practitioner serving the town's wealthier patients, was arrested {{for the murder of}} an elderly widow. Rumours had been circulating since 1935 regarding the frequency of his being named in patients' wills (132 times between 1946 and 1956) and the gifts he was given (including two Rolls Royces). Figures of up to 400 murders were reported in British and foreign newspapers, but after a controversial trial at the Old Bailey which gripped the nation for 17 days in March 1957, Adams was found not guilty. He was struck off for four years but resumed his practice in Eastbourne in 1961. According to Scotland Yard's archives, he is thought to have killed up to 163 patients in the Eastbourne area.|$|E
5|$|After {{establishing}} a legal {{career in the}} field of insolvency, Stevenson served during the Second World War as a Deputy Judge Advocate General of the Armed Forces. He was subsequently Judge Advocate at the 1945 war crimes trial of former personnel of the German submarine U-852 for their actions in {{what became known as the}} Peleus affair. In 1954 Stevenson represented the government of British Kenya during Jomo Kenyatta's unsuccessful appeal against his conviction for membership of the rebel organisation Mau Mau. Later that year he represented the litigants in the Crichel Down affair, which led to changes in the law on compulsory purchase. In 1955 he defended Ruth Ellis, the last woman to be executed for murder in the United Kingdom, and two years later took part in the unsuccessful prosecution of suspected serial killer John <b>Bodkin</b> Adams. He was deeply distressed by the execution of Ellis, for whom there had been no defence in law, but who was expected to have been reprieved by Home Secretary Gwilym Lloyd George.|$|E

50|$|Three headed pins were {{collected}} and discovered {{to be produced}} from the long bones of a large bird. Eight straight <b>bodkins</b> and two curved <b>bodkins</b> were found which vary from oval to circular. One of the curved <b>bodkins</b> {{seem to be a}} small sharpened rib while the other being a completely worked indeterminate bone. Two complete conical points {{were collected}} 47 mm and 54 mm in length; indicate origins of splinter bone. A needle was also collected, however, it is assumed that it isn’t entirely natural. Finally, one carved bone tool was discovered originating from a bird's long bone being 6 mm in diameter.|$|R

25|$|These are short, {{rigid points}} {{with a small}} cross-section. They were made of unhardened iron {{and may have been}} used for better or longer flight, or for cheaper production. It has been mistakenly {{suggested}} that the <b>bodkin</b> came into its own as a means of penetrating armour, but research has found no hardened <b>bodkin</b> points, so it is likely that it was first designed either to extend range or as a cheaper and simpler alternative to the broadhead. In a modern test, a direct hit from a hard steel <b>bodkin</b> point penetrated Damascus chain armour. However, archery was not effective against plate armour, which became available to knights of fairly modest means by the late 14th century.|$|E
25|$|Brothers Fursey <b>Bodkin,</b> Barnabas Lynch, Joseph Nolan, {{and their}} leader, Patrick Ambrose Treacy were Christian Brothers who arrived from Ireland in Melbourne on 15 November 1868 to {{establish}} the religious institute in Australia. In 1875 Brother Treacy visited Bishop Patrick Moran, First Catholic Bishop of Dunedin, and promised him a community of Christian Brothers. In 1876 Brother <b>Bodkin</b> {{was the leader of}} the new Dunedin community, the first Christian Brothers community in New Zealand. <b>Bodkin,</b> Lynch, Nolan and Treacy Houses date from the 1940s. O'Driscoll and Rice Houses were set up in 2011. Edmund Ignatius Rice was the founder of the Christian Brothers and Brother O'Driscoll was the foundation Headmaster of the College. Each year level has six house classes and each House class is the unit of attendance, pastoral care, competitive activity and many daily activities. There are House leaders (students) and House leaders (staff) assigned to each.|$|E

50|$|Odd <b>Bodkins</b> {{was highly}} {{philosophical}} in tone, {{and the book}} contains the strips most idiosyncratic storylines. As an example of Odd <b>Bodkins</b> content, {{a large part of}} the collection is an extended sequence in which the protagonists Fred and Hugh discover that the world is being terraformed by the brass horseman General Injuns in preparation for a Martian invasion. After revealing their knowledge, they are pursued by the General and various other characters symbolizing The Establishment, fleeing on Hughs intelligent Norton motorcycle. They then encounter the ghost of Abraham Lincoln, referred to in the strip as Five Dollar Bill OBrady, who reveals that Martians orchestrated his assassination.|$|R
50|$|As Odd <b>Bodkins</b> became {{increasingly}} political, O'Neill {{feared that the}} Chronicle, which held the strip's copyright, would fire him and hire another artist. The Chronicle had axed Odd <b>Bodkins</b> a few times already, {{but it had been}} reinstated following reader protests. O'Neill decided on an odd tactic to regain control of his strip: he would engage in copyright infringement, which he reasoned would force the paper to surrender the strip's copyright back to him for fear of being sued. O'Neill worked 28 Walt Disney characters, including Mickey Mouse and Pluto, into the strip. In late November 1970, the Chronicle fired O'Neill for the final time but did not continue to run the strip.|$|R
50|$|The strip {{originated}} as a fantasy. The story {{began with}} five-year-old Patsy carried {{away in a}} kite to the magical kingdom of Ods <b>Bodkins.</b> (This setting is unrelated to Odd <b>Bodkins,</b> a comic strip launched in 1964 by cartoonist Dan O'Neill.) During her fanciful journey, Patsy was accompanied and often rescued by the masked Phantom Magician. When they returned to Earth, the Phantom Magician doffed his duds for conventional clothing and assumed the identity of Phil Cardigan, Patsy's uncle, in December 1936. With stories situated in Hollywood, Uncle Phil worked as a screenwriter and Patsy was a young movie actress for producer J. P. Panberg. After Phil was eventually written out of the strip, Patsy's new sidekick was Hollywood agent Skidd Higgins.|$|R

25|$|An {{indictment}} {{for murder}} could contain only one count and Chapman was therefore charged {{only with the}} murder of Maud Marsh. He was prosecuted by Sir Archibald <b>Bodkin</b> and the solicitor-general, Sir Edward Carson, convicted on 19 March 1903 and hanged at Wandsworth Prison on 7 April 1903. Immediately following his death his widow Lucie Kłosowski married Frank Szymanski in April 1903.|$|E
