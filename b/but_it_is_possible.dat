5|$|About 90 {{atoms of}} flerovium have been observed: 58 were {{synthesized}} directly, {{and the rest}} were made from the radioactive decay of heavier elements. All of these flerovium atoms {{have been shown to}} have mass numbers from 284 to 290.

Flerovium is predicted to be near the centre of the theorized island of stability, and it is expected that heavier flerovium isotopes, especially the possibly doubly magic flerovium-298, may have even longer half-lives.|$|E

5|$|Although Æthelwig {{was known}} for his loyalty to King William, he had an uncle who held land at Witton who died {{fighting}} for King Harold Godwinson, probably at the Battle of Stamford Bridge. While abbot, even after the Conquest, Æthelwig continued to build and ornament his abbey in the Anglo-Saxon style, not the Norman Romanesque which was being used in many of the other churches and abbeys. Besides his administrative and legal duties, Æthelwig {{was known for}} his care for the sick and the poor, as well as lepers. After the Harrying of the North by King William in 1069–1070, Æthelwig offered shelter to refugees from the ravaged areas. The Chronicon states that Æthelwig offered aid to the refugees because of his charitable nature, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> that it was also part of his royal duties in western England.|$|E
5|$|As {{the oldest}} parts of Monte Testaccio {{are at the}} bottom of the mound, it is {{difficult}} to say with any certainty when it was first created. Deposits found by excavators have been dated to a period between approximately AD 140 to 250, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> that dumping could have begun on the site as early as the 1st century BC. The mound has a roughly triangular shape comprising two distinct platforms, the eastern side being the oldest. At least four distinct series of terraces were built in a stepped arrangement. Layers of small sherds were laid down in some places, possibly to serve as paths for those carrying out the waste disposal operations.|$|E
5|$|It is {{difficult}} to reconcile {{the records of the}} Irish annals with Norse sources such as the Orkneyinga Saga but it is likely that Norwegian and Gallgáedil Uí Ímair warlords fought for control for much of period from the 9th to the 12th centuries. In 990 Sigurd the Stout, Earl of Orkney took command of the Hebrides, a position he retained for most of the period until he was killed at the Battle of Clontarf in 1014.

5|$|Tamagnino {{is known}} to have left Brescia while the {{construction}} of the sanctuary was ongoing, evidently finding his work undervalued and underpaid. The reasons for the bias are unclear, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> that Cairano enjoyed local favour, especially from the directors of the company commissioning the shrine, which allowed him to prevail over Tamagnino despite the latter's technical superiority. Tamagnino then won the prestigious contract for the façade of the Certosa of Pavia, to be installed under the aegis of Father Amedeo and Antonio Mantegazza. The corporate pact between the artist and the two sculptors strengthened in May 1492, providing Tamagnino with a unique training experience as well as a remarkable leap in his career.|$|E
5|$|Bede {{sometimes}} {{included in}} his theological books an {{acknowledgement of the}} predecessors on whose works he drew. In two cases he left instructions that his marginal notes, which gave {{the details of his}} sources, should be preserved by the copyist, and he may have originally added marginal comments about his sources to others of his works. Where he does not specify, it is still possible to identify books to which he must have had access by quotations that he uses. A full catalogue of the library available to Bede in the monastery cannot be reconstructed, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> to tell, for example, that Bede was very familiar with the works of Virgil. There is little evidence that he had access to any other of the pagan Latin writers—he quotes many of these writers but the quotes are almost all {{to be found in the}} Latin grammars that were common in his day, one or more of which would certainly have been at the monastery. Another difficulty is that manuscripts of early writers were often incomplete: it is apparent that Bede had access to Pliny's Encyclopedia, for example, but it seems that the version he had was missing book xviii, as he would almost certainly have quoted from it in his De temporum ratione.|$|E

5|$|In the Bibliotheca, the Arcadian genealogies are {{immediately}} {{followed by the}} Atlantids, and this progression is known to mirror {{the structure of the}} Catalogue because other fragments of the papyrus roll that transmits the Telephus myth cover families of Atlas' daughters: Taygete, Electra, Alcyone, Sterope, Celaeno, Maia and Merope. Maia bore Hermes to Zeus on Mount Cyllene. Taygete also slept with Zeus, becoming the mother of Lacedaemon, through whom much of the Spartan line was traced, including Tyndareos, the father of Helen, and Penelope, the wife of Odysseus. To Zeus yet again Electra bore Dardanus, the progenitor of the Trojan line, and Eetion, who was killed for sleeping with Demeter. Dardanus' sons were Erichthonius and Ilus. Hyrieus and Hyperes were Poseidon's children by Alcyone. Her section included the Ehoie of Hyrieus' daughter Antiope, who bore Amphion and Zethus to Zeus. Hyperes' daughter Arethusa slept with Poseidon and was changed to a spring in Euboea, but not before bearing Abas, the eponym of the Abantes. His line is traced down to Elephenor, leader of the Abantes in the Trojan War. Sterope lay with Ares and bore Oenomaus, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> that this union was delayed to book four as part of the section treating the family of Pelops and Oenomaus' daughter Hippodameia.|$|E
5|$|Rosebery's {{frequent}} absences {{from his}} wife fuelled gossip {{that he was a}} secret homosexual. It has been claimed that the inscrutable air that Rosebery wore was a mask to disguise his secret homosexual life. The worry of this illegal secret, it was claimed, and fear of exposure, caused his insomnia and bouts of depression. It was even whispered that his Barnbougle Castle retreat was really a venue for clandestine assignations with young men. Rosebery's possible homosexuality has been much discussed in recent times. Nothing conclusive has ever been found one way or the other, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> that he had homosexual experiences while in the care of a paedophile housemaster at Eton in his youth. No evidence exists that his wife was aware of these rumours against her husband, or even that she would have understood them, bearing in mind her sheltered upbringing and limited education. Sex education was not part of a 19th-century upper-class girl's schooling. The more public and precise accusations of Rosebery's homosexuality by the Marquess of Queensberry did not occur until three years after Lady Rosebery's death.|$|E
5|$|The {{historian}} Suetonius {{was born}} in about AD70, and started writing around AD100. He was a child {{at the time of}} the games, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> that he was born and raised in Rome, so he may have witnessed the inaugural games first-hand. His De Vita Caesarum (Lives of the Caesars, known also as The Twelve Caesars or Lives of the Twelve Caesars) probably completed around AD117 to 127, includes some detail on the opening days of the games. Later in his history of Titus he reveals further information about the games. Suetonius' histories of the early Caesars have been criticised for being based on rumour and gossip rather than accurate historical sources, and he often reports from sources which contradict each other without attempting to analyse their quality or accuracy. However, he is generally regarded as a thorough scholar and has been praised for his balanced treatment of his subjects.|$|E

5|$|The {{next night}} at 1945 hrs, a craft {{similar to the}} one the night before {{approached}} the base. In addition to being tracked on radar, it hovered around the area for 30 minutes, with characteristics of movement similar to a helicopter. Additionally, it hovered above the weapons storage area at the same altitude as the night before. At this time, possibly another object (it is unclear if it was the same one as the over the weapons storage area, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible)</b> was spotted over the flightline. The cigar-shaped object was described as hovering in mid-air, jerking around, and turning on and off its lights once. During the blackout, it traveled from the flightline, to the northern end of the runway. According to one service member, the object was chased, and eventually discovered to be hovering five feet off the ground. During this time, it was determined that the object was four car lengths long.|$|E
5|$|Triton's {{surface is}} covered with a {{transparent}} layer of annealed frozen nitrogen. Only 40% of Triton's surface has been observed and studied, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> that it is entirely covered in such a thin sheet of nitrogen ice. Like Pluto's, Triton's crust consists of 55% nitrogen ice with other ices mixed in. Water ice comprises 15–35% and frozen carbon dioxide (dry ice) the remaining 10–20%. Trace ices include 0.1% methane and 0.05% carbon monoxide. There could also be ammonia ice on the surface, as there are indications of ammonia dihydrate in the lithosphere. Triton's mean density implies that it probably consists of about 30–45% water ice (including relatively small amounts of volatile ices), with the remainder being rocky material. Triton's surface area is 23millionkm2, which is 4.5% of Earth, or 15.5% of Earth's land area. Triton has a considerably and unusually high albedo, reflecting 60–95% of the sunlight that reaches it, and it has changed slightly since the first observations. By comparison, the Moon reflects only 11%. Triton's reddish colour is thought {{to be the result of}} methane ice, which is converted to tholins under exposure to ultraviolet radiation.|$|E
5|$|Wilfrid's feast day is 12 October or 24 April. Both dates were {{celebrated in}} early medieval England, but the April date {{appeared}} {{first in the}} liturgical calendars. The April date is the date when his relics were translated to a new shrine. Immediately after his death Wilfrid's body was venerated as a cult object, and miracles were alleged to have happened {{at the spot where}} the water used to wash his body was discarded. A cult grew up at Ripon after his death and remained active until 948, when King Eadred destroyed the church at Ripon; after the destruction, Wilfrid's relics were taken by Archbishop Oda of Canterbury, and held in Canterbury Cathedral. This account appears in a foreword written by Oda for Frithegod's later poem on Wilfrid's life. However, according to Byrhtferth's Vita Sancti Oswaldi, or Life of Saint Oswald, Oda's nephew, Oswald, Archbishop of York, preserved the relics at Ripon and restored the community there to care for them. The two differing accounts are not easily reconciled, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> that Oswald collected secondary relics that had been overlooked by his uncle and installed those at Ripon. The relics that were held at Canterbury were originally placed in the High Altar in 948, but after the fire at Canterbury Cathedral in 1067, Wilfrid's relics were placed in their own shrine.|$|E

5|$|Canis Major is {{also home}} to many {{variable}} stars. EZ Canis Majoris is a Wolf–Rayet star of spectral type WN4 that varies between magnitudes 6.71 and 6.95 over a period of 3.766 days; the cause of its variability is unknown but thought to be related to its stellar wind and rotation. VY Canis Majoris {{is one of the largest}} stars known, a remote red supergiant located around 3800 light-years away from Earth. Estimates of its size, mass and luminosity have varied, with figures of 600 to 3000 times the radius, and 60,000 to 500,000 times the luminosity of the Sun. It was observed in 2011 using interferometry with the Very Large Telescope, yielding a radius of 1420 ± 120 solar radii, surface temperature of around 3490 K (and hence spectral type M4Ia) and a luminosity 270,000 times that of the Sun. Its current mass has been revised at 9–25 solar masses, having shed material from an initial 15–35 solar masses. W Canis Majoris is a type of red giant known as a carbon star—a semiregular variable, it ranges between magnitudes 6.27 and 7.09 over a period of 160 days. A cool star, it has a surface temperature of around 2900 K and a radius 234 times that of the Sun, its distance estimated at 1444–1450 light-years from Earth. At the other extreme in size is RX J0720.4-3125, a neutron star with a radius of around 5km. Exceedingly faint, it has an apparent magnitude of 26.6. Its spectrum and temperature appear to be mysteriously changing over several years. The nature of the changes are unclear, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> they were caused by an event such as the star's absorption of an accretion disc.|$|E
5|$|Michael Dokeianos {{is first}} {{mentioned}} in 1040, as protospatharios and doux, {{when he was}} sent to southern Italy to assume command of the local Byzantine province as Catepan of Italy. Prior to that, he was apparently a member of George Maniakes' expeditionary force sent to conquer Sicily in 1038. Dokeianos arrived in the mainland in November 1040, and the situation he found was critical: his predecessor Nikephoros Dokeianos, probably a relative, had been killed in January at Ascoli in a mutiny of his troops, which was followed by a revolt in Taranto and the capture of the capital, Bari, by Argyrus, son of the Lombard leader Melus. Dokeianos hanged or blinded the ringleaders of the various revolts, but he failed to address the underlying cause, the widespread resentment at the oppressive taxation imposed by the Empire as part of the preparations for the Sicilian expedition under Maniakes. Dokeianos also offered the rule of strategic fortress of Melfi to the Milanese mercenary Arduin, with the title of topoteretes. Arduin had served under previous Byzantine commanders as part of a Norman contingent, but had been flogged in a dispute about the distribution of booty taken from the Muslims in Sicily (William of Apulia claims this was done by Dokeianos, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> that it was done by one of his predecessors, perhaps George Maniakes). Arduin's grudge against the Byzantines now bore fruit. He sought the aid of the Normans who had been established at nearby Aversa since 1030, and received a contingent of 300 men, upon a promise to share his gains equally with them. Thus in March 1041 he and his men seized Melfi. The inhabitants initially opposed him, but eventually were won over by Arduin.|$|E
