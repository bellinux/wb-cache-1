Not only renewable but also petrochemical raw materials are used for synthesis of these <b>biodegradable</b> <b>plastics</b> because the ability to decompose does primary not depend from the raw material but rather from the chemical structure of the plastics. The success of these inventions is mainly influenced by the rules of the environment and the market. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate the company external boundary conditions.
