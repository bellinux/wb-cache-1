In October, Helen Taft returned from Europe on Kroonland and was met by her husband, Secretary of War William Howard Taft. The next August, Henry Yates Satterlee, the first Episcopal Bishop of Washington, returned on Kroonland from a six-week tour of cathedrals of Europe, during which he noted <b>both</b> <b>good</b> <b>and</b> <b>bad</b> design elements of cathedrals in preparation for the building of the Washington National Cathedral. Also returning on the same voyage were Admiral Charles Sperry and Lieutenant Daniel W. Wurtsbaugh of the U.S. Navy, and Brigadier General Robert O'Reilly, the Surgeon General of the U.S. Army; all were American delegates to the Second Geneva Convention. It was not the first trip on Kroonland for either Satterlee and O'Reilly. Satterlee had traveled on the liner the previous May to visit the spa town of Bad Nauheim in Hesse; O'Reilly had been on the November 1904 trip in which Kroonland had been reported as sunk.|$|E

They learn quickly, which is <b>both</b> <b>good</b> <b>and</b> <b>bad,</b> since this guardian breed needs extensive proper socialization to learn to accept strangers, especially within the home; without proper early socialization and training, these dogs are likely to become aggressive towards strangers and unfamiliar dogs.|$|E

25|$|Relationship {{counseling}} typically brings partners {{together for}} joint sessions. The counselor or therapist helps couples pinpoint {{and understand the}} sources of their conflicts and try to resolve them. Partners evaluate <b>both</b> the <b>good</b> <b>and</b> <b>bad</b> parts of their relationship. Integrative behavioral couples therapy has shown success in increasing intimacy after an affair.|$|R
25|$|Khon is {{the most}} stylized form of Thai dance. It is {{performed}} by troupes of non-speaking dancers, the story being told by a chorus {{at the side of}} the stage. Choreography follows traditional models rather than attempting to innovate. Most khon performances feature episodes from the Ramakien. Costumes are dictated by tradition, with angels, <b>both</b> <b>good</b> <b>and</b> <b>bad,</b> wearing coloured masks.|$|E
25|$|The Karma {{theory of}} Buddhism is {{integrated}} into its Twelve Nidanas doctrine, {{and has been}} extensively commented on by ancient Buddhist scholars such as Nagarjuna. Karma consists of any intentional action, whether of body or speech or in mind, which can be either advantageous (merit) or disadvantageous (demerit). <b>Both</b> <b>good</b> <b>and</b> <b>bad</b> karma sustain the cycle of samsara (rebirth) and associated dukkha, and both prevent the attainment of nirvana.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the largest}} banks, brokerages, and {{insurance}} companies desired the Act at the time. The justification was that individuals usually put more money into investments {{when the economy is}} doing well, but they put most of their money into savings accounts when the economy turns bad. With the new Act, {{they would be able to}} do both 'savings' and 'investment' at the same financial institution, which would be able to do well in <b>both</b> <b>good</b> <b>and</b> <b>bad</b> economic times.|$|E

25|$|The temple {{is a part}} of {{the popular}} Navagraha pilgrimage in Tamil Nadu. The planets are {{believed}} to influence the horoscope computed based on time of one's birth and subsequently influence the course of life. Each of the planets are believed to move from a star to another during a predefined period and thus sway over an individual's fortunes. The Navagrahas, as per Hindu customs, are believed to provide <b>both</b> <b>good</b> <b>and</b> <b>bad</b> effects for any individual and the bad effects are mitigated by prayers. As in other Navagraha temples, the common worship practises of the devotees include offering of cloth, grains, flowers and jewels specific to the planet deity. Lighting a set of lamps is also commonly followed in the temple.|$|E
25|$|Star {{grew up in}} a rural {{working class}} area of Rhode Island. Starved for {{philosophy}} she befriended an ex-nun during high school and eventually obtained a scholarship to Radcliffe College where she began taking philosophy classes. Not fitting in and deterred from taking a Religion degree, Star dropped out, married and moved to Venezuela where she co-founded an organic commune. It was here that Star asked many of the questions that formed the basis of her research. Her work is guided by interests in both technology and feminism, and it was during this time that the women's movement and Kate Millett's Sexual Politics inspired her to ask questions about technology, and the effects that <b>both</b> <b>good</b> <b>and</b> <b>bad</b> technology have on oneself and on the world.|$|E
25|$|However, the Easterners, {{who were}} {{by far the}} {{majority}} in court, were not pleased that Yi I was apparently neutral in the conflict, when they believed that Sim Euigyeom had clearly wronged. However, Yi I believed that both Kim and Sim had done <b>both</b> <b>good</b> <b>and</b> <b>bad</b> things. Sim had prevented a fifth purge of the Sarim (by chasing Yi Lyang and his followers from court in 1563), while Kim had helped form a Sarim government by introducing many new scholars into the government. However, Sim had interfered in politics despite {{his status as a}} relative of the queen, while Kim had been close to Yun Wonhyeong despite his being a Seonbi. Yi I therefore believed that both sides were equal in their deeds and misdeeds.|$|E

25|$|Greg Hill still {{refused to}} race ABA races because he {{allegedly}} hated the ABA's direct transfer {{system in which}} the winner of the first moto would then sit out and not race the second and third cycle of motos until the Main, or if the race is big enough, the semis, quarter semis, etc. He and many other racers preferred the NBL's Olympic or cumulative {{system in which the}} qualifying rounds would be run three times and the average place in each round would be added and the four lowest numbers would advance to the main. This system put a premium on consistency while the Transfer System was a little closer to luck, <b>both</b> <b>good</b> <b>and</b> <b>bad</b> for a racer. The ABA used a similar system during its controversial 1982 and 1983 Grand Nationals to choose its number one title to minimize anyone lucking into or out of the title. Also, points are awarded in the motos in the Cumulative System as well as the main so the racer doesn't walk away with nothing if he doesn't advance. Hill's objections seem odd considering he would race in the future sanctioning body the United States Bicycle Association (USBA) which used the transfer system. The USBA did offer larger, more consistent pro purses than the ABA generally.|$|E
25|$|On 17 November Dagobert {{was arrested}} for disagreeing with the representatives. He was {{eventually}} acquitted {{and returned to his}} division where he died on 18 April 1794. Meanwhile, on 3 November the government replaced Turreau with François Amédée Doppet, another ex-doctor. Not wanting to wait for Turreau's successor, the representatives reappointed d'Aoust to command from 22 to 27 November. Doppet came to take command on 28 November but was practically ignored by the representatives on mission. On 7 December, d'Aoust with 10,000 men was defeated at Villelongue-dels-Monts by Ricardos with 8,000 Spanish and Portuguese troops. The Allies lost only 56 casualties while inflicting losses of 340 killed and wounded, 312 missing, 26 guns, two colors and 2,000 muskets on the French. Doppet decided to pull back to Perpignan for the winter under cover of a spoiling attack on Villelongue. D'Aoust led the attack on 18 December which overran the Portuguese camp and slaughtered its garrison. Doppet soon came down with illness and spent the next {{two and a half months}} in bed recovering. D'Aoust was finally in full command just in time to be blamed for a disaster. In the Battle of Collioure, a Spanish corps commanded by Lieutenant General Gregorio García de la Cuesta drove the French out of Collioure and Port-Vendres on 20 December, inflicting 4,000 casualties on the French. Fort Saint-Elme was betrayed to the Spanish by its traitorous commander. D'Aoust ordered a retreat on the 21st but the Spanish harassed it severely. Finally, the French fought their way back to the safety of Perpignan but their total losses in the debacle were 7,700 men and 23 guns. The government singled out the Army of the Eastern Pyrenees for disapproval despite the fact that its representatives were in large part responsible for the defeats. D'Aoust was arrested and the representatives on mission were recalled, except Fabre who was killed at Collioure. New representatives Édouard Jean Baptiste Milhaud and Pierre Soubrany celebrated their arrival by purging the army of <b>both</b> <b>good</b> <b>and</b> <b>bad</b> army officers. However, they subsequently did a better job of keeping the army supplied while letting the army officers do their work. D'Aoust fell victim to the guillotine on 2 July 1794.|$|E

500|$|Josh Brolin plays Bretton James, {{head of the}} Churchill Schwartz {{investment}} bank, whom Jacob blames for {{the death}} of his mentor. Bretton has been described as being a villain.

Javier Bardem was in final talks to play the character; in July 2009 it was confirmed that he had turned down the project in favor of a film adaptation of the book Eat, Pray, Love, with Julia Roberts. Brolin took the part and lost 30 pounds in a month to prepare physically for this part. The actor, acknowledging that every character had <b>both</b> <b>good</b> <b>and</b> <b>bad</b> in them, viewed Bretton as being on a [...] "higher level," [...] adding that he liked the ambition his character had and that he was an opportunist.|$|E
40|$|To date, best {{practice}} in sampling credit applicants {{has been established}} based largely on expert opinion, which generally recommends that small samples of 1500 instances each of <b>both</b> <b>goods</b> <b>and</b> <b>bads</b> are sufficient, <b>and</b> that the heavily biased datasets observed should be balanced by undersampling the majority class. Consequently, the topics of sample sizes and sample balance have not been subject to either formal study in credit scoring, or empirical evaluations across different data conditions and algorithms of varying efficiency. This paper describes an empirical study of instance sampling in predicting consumer repayment behaviour, evaluating the relative accuracies of logistic regression, discriminant analysis, decision trees and neural networks on two datasets across 20 samples of increasing size and 29 rebalanced sample distributions created by gradually under- <b>and</b> over-sampling the <b>goods</b> <b>and</b> <b>bads</b> respectively. The paper makes a practical contribution to model building on credit scoring datasets, and provides evidence that using samples larger than those recommended in credit scoring practice provides {{a significant increase in}} accuracy across algorithms...|$|R

500|$|The Game Boy Advance {{version was}} met with similar reception. Nintendo Power gave it a 3.2 out of 5, lower than the Super NES version's score. IGN noted that the Game Boy Advance version [...] "gave <b>both</b> <b>good</b> <b>and</b> <b>bad</b> {{impressions}} about Kemco's abilities to port SNES to the handheld" [...] and that the multi-player mode will get it its [...] "dues". They gave specific criticism to the early build of Crazy Chase due to the stiff controls and delayed jump. They also criticized the animation for being less fluid than the Super NES version's. GamePros Fennec Fox called the Super NES game [...] "semi-obscure", while fellow GamePro writer DJ Dinobot criticized the Game Boy Advance's preview build for Crazy Chase for its controls were [...] "harder to steer than a 1976 Pinto with a flat tire".|$|E
500|$|Critical {{response}} to the film was mixed but mostly positive, in Denmark, including praise for Madsen's direction, the performances of Lindhardt, Mikkelsen, Stengade and Mygind; opinions were divided about the portrayal of the main characters. The film [...] "has shocked Danish audiences" [...] for its portrayal of the protagonists as non-heroic, and has been criticised by historians. Berlingskes Ebbe Iversen commented {{that it can be}} <b>both</b> <b>good</b> <b>and</b> <b>bad</b> to have morally ambiguous characters as it can be seen as [...] "an artistic force" [...] to have [...] "authentic protagonists psychology", {{but it can also be}} frustrating to have their motives portrayed as [...] "enigmatic". The critic stated it did not make it a bad film, instead [...] "its subtle, not uncritical portrayal of the resistance seems sober and serious, the style is worked out to the smallest detail, and in its outer form the film is the type of work that you unkindly call conventional and more kindly describe as classic." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{reviewer}} by the moniker KJB {{watched the}} episode for IGN, giving it {{one out of}} five stars.

[...] Criticism was directed at the introduction of the MACOs, which were described as Starship Troopers clones, and at the modification to the theme tune. The Xindi themselves were described as [...] "bad Farscape knock offs", and the reviewer said that they set a poor tone {{for the rest of the}} season. Michelle Erica Green said she was in a [...] "double mind" [...] about [...] "The Xindi" [...] in her review at TrekNation as there were <b>both</b> <b>good</b> <b>and</b> <b>bad</b> elements. She praised the action sequences, the make-up and McHattie as the alien foreman. Green enjoyed the twist at the end with the Xindi homeworld being already destroyed, and felt that the Xindi races would be interesting. On the other hand, she thought that the MACO scenes were too dark and that the T'Pol nude scenes were unnecessary.|$|E
