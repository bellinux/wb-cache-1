40|$|Studies on {{etiology}} {{and control}} of the stem canker and <b>black</b> <b>scurf</b> diseases caused by Rhizoctonia solani in Finland have been carried out at University of Helsinki, Department of Applied Biology, since 2003. One of the studies repeated during three growing seasons was carried out to provide a detailed characterization of the disease cycle. Because the diseases caused by R. solani can be soil- and seed-borne, the experiments were placed in an R. solani free field and established using seed tubers infested with <b>black</b> <b>scurf,</b> so to be able to focus on the seed-borne infection. Only the young below-ground parts of the potato plants were detectably infected. Four phases could be distinguished during the disease cycle, all of which were characterized by different phenotypic features and consequences on yield. The first phase included infection of the tips of sprouts prior to emergence. It resulted in delayed emergence, fewer stems and retarded development of canopy, and reduced yield and starch content in tubers. The second phase included infection of stolon tips 2 - 3 weeks after emergence of plants. During this phase the stems were no more damaged. Infection and death of stolon tips resulted in shorter stolons than observed in uninfected plants. Consequently, infected plants had a tight tuber nest in which tubers were misshaped, furrowed and highly variable in size. The third phase of the disease progression, 3 to 4 weeks after emergence, resulted in damage to the youngest tubers. They suffered from scabby, often sunken surface areas and holes, which were usually situated at the sprout-end of the tuber. In some varieties, cracking of tubers was also observed. The fourth and last phase was defined by the development of sclerotia (<b>black</b> <b>scurf)</b> on tubers. This phase was initiated by the time of maturation in all below-ground parts of the potato plant. It was triggered also by chemical haulm killing at ca. 2 weeks after the treatment. Between the aforementioned, active phases of disease progression, R. solani seemed to be inactive, residing as a tight, brown mycelium on stem bases, stolons and roots. The mycelium also formed typical fruiting bodies under moist conditions.

Under greenhouse conditions, application of a bacterial suspension of B. subtilis at 109 cell mL − 1 significantly reduced the disease incidence of stem canker and <b>black</b> <b>scurf</b> to 22. 3 and 30 %, respectively. In addition, it significantly improved some biochemical parameters, growth and tubers yield. Our findings indicate two points; firstly, B. subtilis possesses a good biocontrol activity against Rhizoctonia diseases of potato, secondly, the harmonization and suitability of the soil conditions to the growth and activity of B. subtilis guaranteed a high controlling capacity against the target pathogen...|$|E
40|$|Inter-fungal {{interactions}} and hyphal parasitism are extremely amenable to basic research {{dealing with the}} physiology and control of diseases in variety of hosts (1). In contrast to the voluminous literature pertaining to dual culture studies, there is little information regarding the biology of hyperparasitism in nature (2). Rhizoctonia solani Kühn is an important fungal pathogen that causes stem canker and <b>black</b> <b>scurf</b> to potato worldwide (8). R. solani can be parasitized by several fungal species such as Gliocladium spp., Trichoderma spp., Fusarium spp., Papulaspora sp. (9, 10) and Ver ticil l ium (5).

40|$|A {{survey of}} {{anastomosis}} groups (AGs) of Rhizoctonia species associated with potato diseases {{was conducted in}} South Africa. A total of 112 Rhizoctonia solani and 19 binucleate Rhizoctonia (BNR) isolates were recovered from diseased potato plants, characterized for AG and pathogenicity. The AG identity of the isolates was confirmed using phylogenetic analysis of the internal transcribed spacer region of ribosomal DNA. Rhizoctonia solani isolates recovered belonged to AG 3 -PT, AG 2 - 2 IIIB, AG 4 HG-I, AG 4 HG-III and AG 5, while BNR isolates belonged to AG A and AG R, with frequencies of 74, 6. 1, 2. 3, 2. 3, 0. 8, 12. 2 and 2. 3 %, respectively. Rhizoctonia solani AG 3 -PT was the most predominant AG and occurred in all the potato growing regions sampled whereas the other AGs occurred in distinct locations. Different AGs grouped into distinct clades with high maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood bootstrap support for both R. solani and BNR. An experiment under greenhouse conditions with representative isolates from different AGs showed differences in aggressiveness between and within AGs. Isolates of AG 2 - 2 IIIB, AG 4 HG-III and AG R were the most aggressive in causing stem canker while AG 3 -PT, AG 5 and AG R caused <b>black</b> <b>scurf.</b> This is the first comprehensive survey of R. solani and BNR on potatoes in South Africa using a molecularbased approach.

40|$|A {{trial was}} {{established}} in 2003, in Southern France, to assess under organic farming conditions the effect of top irrigation with sprinklers on potato yield, but also to evaluate side effects on epidemics, {{with a focus on}} late blight (Phytophthora infestans L.). Two varieties, one susceptible (Charlotte) and one with a good level of resistance to late blight (Eden), have been planted. Three irrigation regimes have been applied : no irrigation [NO], reduced or optimized irrigation [OPT] and irrigation according to usual grower practice [NORM]. Irrigation had no effect on foliar late blight development. For both varieties, commercial yield in the non-irrigated plots was significantly lower (16, 36 t. ha- 1) than in the OPT and NORM plots (resp. 26, 12 t. ha- 1 and 24, 15 t. ha- 1), with a higher proportion of small tubers for NO (11, 96 %) than for OPT and NORM (resp. 4, 25 % and 3, 32 %). Irrigation regime had no effect on proportion of tubers with affected by either late blight or Rhizoctonia (<b>black</b> <b>scurf).</b> As expected, Charlotte confirmed its susceptibility to foliar late blight, while Eden had a significant higher total yield than Charlotte (resp. 47, 19 t. ha- 1 and 32, 19 t. ha- 1). However, {{there was no significant difference}} between the two varieties for commercial yield (resp. 20, 51 t. ha- 1 and 23, 91 t. ha- 1), due to a large proportion of tubers with <b>black</b> <b>scurf</b> and of mis-shaped tubers in Eden. For conclusion, irrigation in this region is necessary to obtain reasonable yields and tuber sizes compatible with market requirements. It is possible to reduce irrigation doses without reducing significantly yields, in order to preserve water resources. Under the conditions of this trial, top irrigation on foliage did not increase late blight or silver scurf severity...|$|E
40|$|Potato is {{the third}} most {{important}} food crop {{in the world with}} production exceeding 320 million tonnes per year. Major soilborne diseases of concern to the Australian potato industry include common scab, powdery scab, <b>black</b> <b>scurf</b> and the post-harvest disease tuber soft rot. These diseases have negative impacts on the French fry potato processing sector where the cultivar ‘Russet Burbank’ is the most important commercial cultivar used. Common scab is caused by infection of developing tubers with Streptomyces spp. Previous research has developed common scab resistant somaclonal variants of Russet Burbank using a somatic cell-selection breeding technique, with the pathogens toxin (thaxtomin A) used as a positive selective agent. The current study involved determining the breadth and possible mechanism of resistance of these novel variants of Russet Burbank to other important tuber diseases such as powdery scab caused by Spongospora subterranea f. sp. subterranea (a protozoan), <b>black</b> <b>scurf</b> caused by Rhizoctonia solani (a fungus), tuber soft rot caused by Pectobacterium atrosepticum and P. carotovorum (both bacteria species). This study also involved measurement of Spongospora subterranea f. sp. subterranea root infection and developing model systems to track infection and provide an early indication of putative controls which may improve management options for powdery scab. A series of glasshouse experiments, field trials and in vitro assays were conducted to challenge five common scab resistant variants of c. v. Russet Burbank against Spongospora subterranea f. sp. subterranea, R. solani, P. atrosepticum and P. caratovorum. Pathogen inoculation techniques, sequential harvest and modified disease assessment methods were followed to evaluate the concurrent resistance level to these pathogens compared to the parent cultivar. Trial results identified three variants expressing tuber resistance to these pathogens, the clone A 380 showed 66...|$|E
40|$|Rhizoctonia solani {{inoculum}} can {{be present}} either as soil- or tuber-borne sclerotia or hyphae. Although both inoculum sources {{play a role}} in disease development, it is not clear which of the two is more important. Successive cultivation of potato crops increases R. solani soil inoculum load resulting in an escalation in disease incidence and severity. The use of tolerant cultivars, however, can effectively reduce inoculum levels thereby decreasing disease intensity. Four pot trials were conducted; the objective of the first two pot trials was to determine the effect of tuber and soil-borne inoculum and stolon inoculations on disease development in sandy and clay loam soils. The second two pot trials were aimed at determining susceptibility levels of five cultivars. Two field trials were planted over two growing seasons in the same soils, using three inoculum levels. Results from the pot trials showed that tubers harvested from inoculated sandy soils developed significantly more disease than those harvested from clay loam soils. Of the three inoculum sources, stolon inoculation and seed-borne inoculum resulted in significantly more disease on progeny tubers than those from R. solani spiked soils. Although none of the cultivars proved to be tolerant to R. solani, BP 1 was less susceptible to R. solani at temperatures between 21 - 26 oC. More severe disease symptoms were observed under cooler temperatures on all cultivars. Results from the field trial showed the cultivation of potatoes in the same soil over two growing seasons resulted in an increase in diseased (<b>black</b> <b>scurf)</b> tubers. Furthermore, <b>black</b> <b>scurf</b> was most severe on tubers from soils infested with the highest concentration of inoculum. There were significant disease severity differences, with initial soil inoculum levels being directly proportional to final disease severity. Future studies in South Africa should focus on investigating the genetic composition of various cultivars; the effect of soil type and pH on the pathogenicity of R. solani and the use of molecular diagnostic tools to detect and quantify R. solani in soils.
