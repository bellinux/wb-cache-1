[...] I never walked as much as four cubits without meditating on the Law, and never thought of its contents at places not scrupulously clean. [...] Nor did I prepare a bed for myself to enjoy regular sleep, nor did I disturb my colleagues by walking to my seat at college among them. I never nicknamed my neighbor nor rejoiced at his fall. Anger against my neighbor never went to <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> and I never passed the street near where my debtor lived; and while at home I never betrayed impatience, in order to observe what is said (in [...] ), 'I will walk within my house with a perfect heart.'" [...] (Jerusalem Talmud Taanit 67a; compare Babylonian Talmud Taanit 20b.) ...|$|E
60|$|I won't take my {{eyes off}} of them. And I'll take them to <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> to-night for safety. Besides, there is no danger. Nobody but you knows I have them.|$|E
60|$|For me no terrors {{resided in}} the thought of bugaboos and wicked ogres. The fall through leafy {{branches}} and the dizzy heights; the snakes that struck at me as I dodged and leaped away in chattering flight; the wild dogs that hunted me across the open spaces to the timber--these were terrors concrete and actual, happenings and not imaginings, things of the living flesh and of sweat and blood. Ogres and bugaboos and I had been happy bed-fellows, compared with these terrors that made their <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> throughout my childhood, and that still <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> now, as I write this, full of years.|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear," [...] said Mrs Childers, [...] "I think I shall go to <b>bed.</b> Come <b>with</b> <b>me.</b> Good-night, Nicholas. Will {{you keep}} the {{skylight}} off to-night, Jeffry? It was too hot in our cabin last night." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well," [...] she said, [...] "I won't {{play any}} more, but I don't {{want to go}} home yet. It is early, and I can never sleep here if I go to <b>bed.</b> Sit <b>with</b> <b>me</b> for half-an-hour, and then perhaps you could give me some supper?" ...|$|R
60|$|Then {{we talked}} {{of the places}} and things that I more {{particularly}} desired to see and, well, {{the end of it}} was that I went back to my hotel in love with Natalie; and as she afterwards confessed, she went to <b>bed</b> in love <b>with</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Landlord," [...] said I, [...] "tell him to stash his {{tomahawk}} there, or pipe, {{or whatever}} you call it; tell him to stop smoking, in short, and I will turn in with him. But I don't fancy having a man smoking in <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> <b>me.</b> It's dangerous. Besides, I ain't insured." ...|$|E
60|$|All these queer {{proceedings}} increased my uncomfortableness, {{and seeing}} him now exhibiting strong symptoms of concluding his business operations, and jumping into <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> I {{thought it was}} high time, now or never, before the light was put out, to break the spell in which I had so long been bound.|$|E
60|$|At last, repeating {{his usual}} saying, {{that he could}} lie naked in the <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> and not offer me the least injury, he starts out of his bed. 'And now, my dear,' says he, 'you shall see how just I will be to you, and that I can keep my word,' and away he comes to my bed.|$|E
6000|$|BECKET. Friend, am I so {{much better}} than thyself That thou shouldst help me? Thou art wearied out With this day's work, get thee to thine own <b>bed.</b> Leave <b>me</b> <b>with</b> Herbert, friend. [...] [Exit SERVANT. Help <b>me</b> off, Herbert, <b>with</b> this--and this.|$|R
60|$|I {{once had}} a hound, a right good hound, A hound both fleet and strong: He ate at my board, and he slept by my <b>bed,</b> And ran <b>with</b> <b>me</b> all the day long. But my wife took a priest, a shaveling priest, And 'such friendships are carnal,' quoth he. So my wife and her priest they drugged the poor beast, And the rat's bane is waiting for me.|$|R
5000|$|Down {{has spoken}} on several {{occasions}} about dealing with sexual predators in the film industry. In 2002, she spoke of finding fame in the late 1960s: [...] "The casting couch was in full swing, people expected it... My teen-age years were pretty intense, {{a lot of pressure}} and a lot of horrible old men out there". In a 1977 interview, she had also said: [...] "I was promised lots of lovely big film parts by American producers if I went to <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> them. Believe <b>me,</b> the casting couch is no myth".|$|R
6000|$|... "In this {{difficulty}} I therefore resolved {{to take the}} subject of the horses to <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> and to say, 'Here I have you and you shall not escape from me.' But about supper-time Manuel came in to molest me, and sat in the kitchen with a sad face, like a prisoner under sentence of death.|$|E
60|$|In 1844 Kneipp {{filled the}} world with the wonder of the water cure. Mother wanted to try it, but on sober second thought she put me through. A bucket of ice-water was poured over to see the effect. Then I was rubbed down with flannels, sheet was dipped in the water, and I was put to bed. I perspired so much that mother put a {{life-preserver}} to <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
60|$|It {{happened}} pleasantly enough one night, his lordship {{had stayed}} late, and I, not expecting him that night, had taken Amy to <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> {{and when my}} lord came into the chamber we were both fast asleep. I think it was near three o'clock when he came in, and a little merry, but not at all fuddled or what they call in drink; and he came at once into the room.|$|E
5000|$|In {{accordance}} {{with the nature of}} the text, Bach created a relatively simple composition held with short sentences and usually simple accompaniment. He repeatedly drew on popular dance forms, folk and popular melodies (such as La Folia and the folk song [...] "Mit dir und mir ins Federbett, mit dir und mir aufs Stroh", whose title translates as [...] "With you and me in the spring <b>bed,</b> <b>with</b> you and <b>me</b> on the straw") and parts from his own historical pieces (Set 14 from BWV Anh. 11 and Theorem 20 from BWV 201 / 7).|$|R
6000|$|A {{good old}} woman {{came to see}} if we wanted any thing. I thought, as I {{stretched}} myself in the <b>bed,</b> <b>with</b> feathers under <b>me</b> and feathers over me, what a heaven of rest this place must have seemed to poor travellers benighted and perishing in the snow. In the morning I looked out of my loophole on the tall, grim rocks, and a small lake frozen and covered with snow. [...] "Is this lake always frozen?" [...] said I to the old serving woman who had come to bring us hot water for washing.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{slept in}} a very {{handsome}} room, well painted, well gilded, and large, with very little fire, and no windows, [Footnote: That is, with no glass to the windows.] which is not very agreeable {{in the month of}} January. I slept on mattresses, which were laid upon the floor, and my sister, who had no <b>bed,</b> slept <b>with</b> <b>me.</b> I was obliged to sing to get her to sleep, and then her slumber did not last long, so that she disturbed mine. She tossed about, felt me near her, woke up, and exclaimed that she saw the beast, so I was obliged to sing again to put her to sleep, and in that way I passed the night. Judge whether this was an agreeable situation for one who had had little or no sleep the night before, and who had been ill all winter with colds. However, the fatigue and exposure of this expedition cured me.|$|R
6000|$|... "As {{we had no}} wood {{wherewith}} to {{make another}} fire, and so could not procure water except by the tedious process of digging through the ice, I resolved to try an experiment which I had once heard had been attempted with success. This was, to fill a bottle with snow {{and take it to}} <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> <b>me.</b> During the night the heat of my body melted the snow, and in the morning we had sufficient water to give us each a draught at breakfast.|$|E
60|$|And now put {{yourself}} in my place for a moment. Walk with me a bit in my tender childhood, <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> a night and imagine yourself dreaming such incomprehensible horrors. Remember I was an inexperienced child. I {{had never seen a}} wild boar in my life. For that matter I had never seen a domesticated pig. The nearest approach to one that I had seen was breakfast bacon sizzling in its fat. And yet here, real as life, wild boars dashed through my dreams, and I, with fantastic parents, swung through the lofty tree-spaces.|$|E
60|$|But the {{interval}} I spent in deliberating what to say, was a fatal one. Taking up his tomahawk from the table, {{he examined the}} head of it for an instant, and then holding it to the light, with his mouth at the handle, he puffed out great clouds of tobacco smoke. The next moment the light was extinguished, and this wild cannibal, tomahawk between his teeth, sprang into <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> <b>me.</b> I sang out, I could not help it now; and giving a sudden grunt of astonishment he began feeling me.|$|E
6000|$|There was {{a bed in}} the room, and we {{were walking}} to and again, eager in the discourse; at last he takes me by {{surprise}} in his arms, and threw me on the <b>bed</b> and himself <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> and holding me fast in his arms, but without the least offer of any indecency, courted <b>me</b> to consent <b>with</b> such repeated entreaties and arguments, protesting his affection, and vowing he would not let me go till I had promised him, that at last I said, 'Why, you resolve not to be denied, indeed, I can't be denied.' 'Well, well,' said I, and giving him a slight kiss, 'then you shan't be denied,' said I; 'let me get up.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, colonel, if {{you will}} come along <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> {{you will find a}} <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> hot {{blankets}} ready, and, I doubt not, a blazing fire.|$|R
5000|$|In 2002, actress Lesley-Anne Down (b. 1954) {{spoke of}} finding fame {{in the late}} 1960s: [...] "The casting couch was in full swing, people {{expected}} it... My teen-age years were pretty intense, {{a lot of pressure}} and a lot of horrible old men out there". In a 1977 interview, she had also said: [...] "I was promised lots of lovely big film parts by American producers if I went to <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> them... Believe <b>me,</b> the casting couch is no myth". In 2015, Down discussed her experiences of sexual harassment in the 1970s by an unnamed legendary Hollywood actor and also by producer Sam Spiegel, saying that she had never really enjoyed her acting career: [...] "Partly that was because of all the lecherous men, studio executives, producers and directors. There was so much running away and hiding under tables. Anyway, I started when I was ten and I’ve been doing it for 50 years." ...|$|R
60|$|And now he made deep protestations of {{a sincere}} {{inviolable}} affection for me, but all along attested {{it to be}} with the utmost reserve for my virtue and his own. I told him I was fully satisfied of it. He carried it that length that he protested to me, that if he was naked in <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> he would as sacredly preserve my virtue as he would defend it if I was assaulted by a ravisher. I believed him, and told him I did so; but this did not satisfy him, he would, he said, wait for some opportunity to give me an undoubted testimony of it.|$|E
6000|$|... "I guess {{mother is}} worried this time, because I never stayed {{out all night}} before, and I never will again without leave. It's rather good fun, though, if they only find me. I ain't afraid, and it isn't very cold. I always wanted to sleep out, and now I'm doing it. Wish poor Billy was safely down and in this good <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> <b>me.</b> Won't he be scared all alone there? Maybe the belt will break and he get hurt bumping down. Sorry now I left him, he's such a 'fraid-cat. There's the gun again! Guess it's that man after us. Hi! hollo! Here I am! Whoop! Hurrah! Hi! hi! hi!" ...|$|E
6000|$|And--oh!--he {{insists on}} {{sleeping}} {{with me on}} top the bedding; a proceeding which has scandalized the mate. [...] "I suppose he'll be using your toothbrush next," [...] Mr. Pike growled at me. But the puppy loves my companionship, and is never happier than when on the <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> <b>me.</b> Yet the bed is not entirely paradise, for Possum is badly frightened when ours is the lee side and the seas pound and smash against the glass ports. Then the little beggar, electric with fear to every hair tip, crouches and snarls menacingly and almost {{at the same time}} whimpers appeasingly at the storm-monster outside.|$|E
60|$|Monday.--All {{yesterday}} I {{was under}} the influence of opium. I had been rather seedy during the night and took a dose in the morning, {{and for the first time}} in my life it took effect upon me. I had a day of extraordinary happiness; and when I went to bed there was something almost terrifying in the pleasures that besieged me in the darkness. Wonderful tremors filled me; my head swam in the most delirious but enjoyable manner; and the <b>bed</b> softly oscillated <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> like a boat in a very gentle ripple. It does not make me write a good style apparently, which is just as well, lest I should be tempted to renew the experiment; and some verses which I wrote turn out on inspection to be not quite equal to Kubla Khan. However, I was happy, and the recollection is not troubled by any reaction this morning.|$|R
6000|$|And {{then when}} I {{went up to}} bed she come up <b>with</b> <b>me</b> and fetched her candle, and tucked me in, and mothered me so good I felt mean, and like I couldn't look her in the face; and she set down on the <b>bed</b> and talked <b>with</b> <b>me</b> a long time, and said what a splendid boy Sid was, and didn't {{seem to want to}} ever stop talking about him; and kept asking me every now and then if I {{reckoned}} he could a got lost, or hurt, or maybe drownded, and might be laying at this minute somewheres suffering or dead, and she not by him to help him, and so the tears would drip down silent, and I would tell her that Sid was all right, and would be home in the morning, sure; and she would squeeze my hand, or maybe kiss me, and tell me to say it again, and keep on saying it, because it done her good, and she was in so much trouble. And when she was going away she looked down in my eyes so steady and gentle, and says: ...|$|R
5000|$|JBU is {{a massive}} read. Even at an {{accelerated}} pace, with a deadline looming, it took me days to read it all. This is what I want from a magazine: a variety of stories to get my teeth into and some non-fiction to leaven the mixture. The only drawback was that I couldn't take it <b>with</b> <b>me</b> to my usual reading place—it just isn't possible to snuggle up in <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> a computer.|$|R
6000|$|... "I respect these things, sir, {{more than}} you respect your father's grave," [...] said Captain Truck sternly, as he rescued the last article from what he thought the impious grasp of Aristabulus again, [...] "and cat or no cat, they sink or swim {{with me for the}} {{remainder}} of the cruise. If there is any virtue in a will, which I am sorry to say I hear there is not any longer, they shall share my last <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> be it ashore or be it afloat. My dear young lady, fancy all the rest, but depend on it, punch will be sweeter than ever taken from this bowl, and 'sweethearts and wives' will never be so honoured again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For you see {{the thing}} is this. I have a poor head for figures; all other kinds of {{knowledge}} come easy to me, but how to calculate readily has never yet found an entrance into my head. At the same time, whenever I find it impossible to make out my accounts, or settle what to do, I have only to take the matter to <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> and lie awake thinking it over. For when I do that, I rise next morning feeling free and refreshed, like a man that has just eaten a water-melon; for what I have {{to do and how}} it is to be done is all as plain to my sight as this maté-cup I hold in my hand.|$|E
6000|$|About {{one o'clock}} in the morning--for so long we sat up together--I said, [...] "Come, 'tis one o'clock; I must go to bed." [...] "Well," [...] says he, [...] "I'll go with you." [...] "No, no;" [...] says I; [...] "go to your own chamber." [...] He said {{he would go to}} <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> <b>me.</b> [...] "Nay," [...] says I, [...] "if you will, I don't know what to say; if I can't help it, you must." [...] However, I got from him, left him, and went into my chamber, but did not shut the door, and as he could easily see that I was undressing myself, he steps to his own room, which was but on the same floor, and in a few minutes undresses himself also, and returns to my door in his gown and slippers.|$|E
5000|$|He {{garnered}} a {{love for}} reading at a young age. As a boy, Stanley urged his father to read him Beatrix Potter's story The Tale of Peter Rabb{{it over and over}}: [...] "I have some vivid memories of that bucolic episode Lakewood, N.J., but most vivid is the memory of my father, on a weekend visit, sitting by my <b>bed</b> filling <b>me</b> <b>with</b> bliss as he read Peter Rabbit to me, patiently read it over and over on demand until I was letter perfect in it. He must have read other stories to me as well, but of them I have no recollection because they lacked the true magic." [...] He eagerly read books in the family library by the likes of Mark Twain, Rudyard Kipling, Robert Louis Stevenson, Guy de Maupassant and Edgar Allan Poe, who were literary influences on his writing.|$|R
60|$|I insisted so peremptorily upon it, that {{he could}} not avoid coming to a point, either to keep his word <b>with</b> <b>me</b> or to break it; and this, {{notwithstanding}} he used all the skill he was master of, and employed his mother and other agents to prevail <b>with</b> <b>me</b> to alter my resolutions; indeed, the bottom of the thing lay at my heart, and that made all his endeavours fruitless, for my heart was alienated from him as a husband. I loathed the thoughts of <b>bedding</b> <b>with</b> him, and used a thousand pretenses of illness and humour to prevent his touching me, fearing nothing more than to be with child by him, which to be sure would have prevented, or at least delayed, my going over to England.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{your little}} <b>bed</b> that counts <b>with</b> you just now," [...] said the doctor. [...] "You come <b>with</b> <b>me</b> at once, or I'll throw up the case. 'You're as loony as a loon." ...|$|R
