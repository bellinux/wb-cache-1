Yang–Mills theory seeks to describe the behavior of elementary particles using these non-Abelian Lie groups and {{is at the core}} of the unification of the electromagnetic and weak forces (i.e. U(1) × SU(2)) as well as quantum chromodynamics, the theory of the strong force (based on SU(3)).

25|$|As an example, {{suppose that}} {{light in the}} orange range of {{wavelengths}} (approximately 577nm to 597nm) enters the eye and strikes the retina. Light of these wavelengths would activate both the medium and long wavelength cones of the retina, but not equally—the long-wavelength cells will respond more. The difference in the response can be detected by the brain, and this difference is the <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> perception of orange. Thus, the orange appearance of an object results from light from the object entering our eye and stimulating the different cones simultaneously but to different degrees.|$|E

500|$|The social {{implications}} {{of the theory of}} evolution by natural selection also became the source of continuing controversy. Friedrich Engels, a German political philosopher and co-originator of the ideology of communism, wrote in 1872 that [...] "Darwin did not know what a bitter satire he wrote on mankind, and especially on his countrymen, when he showed that free competition, the struggle for existence, which the economists celebrate as the highest historical achievement, is the normal state of the animal kingdom." [...] Herbert Spencer and the eugenics advocate Francis Galton's interpretation of natural selection as necessarily progressive, leading to supposed advances in intelligence and civilisation, became a justification for colonialism, eugenics, and social Darwinism. For example, in 1940, Konrad Lorenz, in writings that he subsequently disowned, used the theory as a justification for policies of the Nazi state. He wrote [...] "...selection for toughness, heroism, and social utility... must be accomplished by some human institution, if mankind, in default of selective factors, is not to be ruined by domestication-induced degeneracy. The racial idea as the <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> state has already accomplished much in this respect." [...] Others have developed ideas that human societies and culture evolve by mechanisms analogous to those that apply to evolution of species.|$|E

Despite {{the fact that the}} amount of literature on sustainability is substantial, there is lack of empirical investigation into understanding sustainability among corporations established in the Czech Republic. We used qualitative methodology (semi-structured interviews) to investigate how the largest corporations established in the Czech Republic understand and deal with sustainability-related issues.

On the <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> comparison <b>of</b> <b>our</b> results with the prior literature it is possible to sum up that our findings are mostly in accordance with previous research. Majority <b>of</b> <b>our</b> respondents perceive sustainability as containing economic, environmental and social dimension and their sustainability-related initiatives are both internally and externally oriented.
