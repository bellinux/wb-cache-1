40|$|New Zealand has {{ratified}} the Kyoto Protocol {{and agreed to}} reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels in the first commitment period 2008 - 2012. Energy generated from renewable sources, such as New Zealand plantation forests and wood processing sites, is considered greenhouse gas neutral. But the use of biomass for bioenergy in New Zealand is very small. Some {{of the reasons for}} this include a lack of information about the future fuel supply and delivered cost. This thesis aims to provide a methodology to estimate biomass fuel availability and the delivered cost, of a range of forest and wood processing sources within a district, and to analyse the impact of harvest age, harvesting practices, terrain, collection <b>and</b> <b>chipping</b> costs, opportunity cost and transport costs on the availability and delivered cost of biomass for bioenergy. The six biomass streams included were chiplogs, forest landing residues, cutover residues, sawdust, <b>bark</b> <b>and</b> <b>chip.</b> The methodology was developed based on an area in Canterbury, and tested on an area in the Nelson/Marlborough region. It utilises forest growth models, Geographic Information Systems and Microsoft Excel. Growth models allow the analysis to be customised to a particular area or region, while the use of GIS allows the model to take spatial aspects (for example slope and transport distance) into consideration. Developing the overall framework within Excel allows easy analysis of the results and changes to the underlying assumptions. Opportunity costs make up {{a large proportion of the}} total cost of delivery for the chiplog, sawdust, <b>bark</b> <b>and</b> <b>chip</b> biomass <b>and</b> need to be included in any estimate of cost for these biomass streams. The logistic system chosen for collecting <b>and</b> <b>chipping</b> the forest residues has a large impact on their delivered cost as do the transport costs. However transport cost is not the most significant influence on the delivered cost of other biomass streams. The use of biomass for electricity generation only is not currently economic in either of the areas analysed.

30|$|In Canada, Newfoundland and Labrador (NL) has {{the highest}} {{quantity}} of waste disposal per capita after Alberta. This amounts to about 429  kg of residential waste per capita (Statistics Canada [2008]). NL comprises more than 200 small communities with population between 100 and 600. Most of these small communities are located in remote and isolated areas and cannot access large solid waste disposal sites or central organic processing facilities. Therefore, on-site composting facilities have been considered as a viable means to deal with organic wastes in the small communities. Although a lack of extensive agricultural production in the northern region of NL could limit the selection of bulking agents for composting, NL generally possesses extensive peat resources. In addition, the forestry industry in NL produces wastes organic materials {{in the form of}} sawdust, <b>bark,</b> <b>and</b> wood <b>chips,</b> which can be used as the bulking agent for MSW composting (Martin et al. [1993]). The food waste constitutes approximately 40 % of the MSW and it represents a significant proportion of organic material found in MSW. Diversion of food waste from landfill since it is the biggest organic stream in municipal solid waste is essential to reach high diversion target (Environment [2013]). Therefore, detailed knowledge of the performance of the composting process with locally available bulking agents would allow the improvement of community-scale composts quality in the small communities of NL.|$|R

The effects of phenols, amino acids, reducing sugars, pH and bleaching agents on color of tortillas <b>and</b> tortilla <b>chips</b> were investigated. Baked tortillas were equilibrated for 0, 5, 15, 30, 60 min and 24 hr prior to frying to examine the effect of equilibration on chip color. White dry masa flour (1. 2 % sucrose, 2. 3 % free amino groups and 1. 2 % phenols) for tortilla chips was blended with different concentrations and combinations of glucose, lysine and ferulic acid. Calcium oxide and citric acid were used to increase or decrease pH. Hydrogen, benzoyl and calcium peroxide were added as bleaching agents to improve tortilla chip color. Masa was sheeted, baked, cut, equilibrated and fried to produce tortillas <b>and</b> <b>chips</b> using pilot <b>plant</b> equipment. The color (L, a, b), pH, and moisture content of tortillas <b>and</b> <b>chips</b> were determined. Fat content of chips was determined with NIR. Tortillas <b>and</b> <b>chips</b> became darker above pH 7. 5 and 6. 4, respectively. A decrease in lightness was accompanied by an increase in a dull, yellow color. No darkening was observed in tortillas <b>and</b> <b>chips</b> at pH < 6. 4. The minimum level of glucose, lysine and ferulic acid required to participate in the Maillard reaction was much higher in tortillas than chips with significant darkening occurring during frying. The combination of 50 ppm each of glucose, lysine and ferulic acid (GLF) caused darker chips. The combination of glucose and lysine produced darker chips at lower concentrations compared to all paired combinations of glucose, lysine and ferulic acid. Tortillas <b>and</b> <b>chips</b> prepared with hydrogen peroxide were lighter than untreated tortillas <b>and</b> <b>chips.</b> No lightening was observed by the addition of < 2500 ppm of calcium or benzoyl peroxide. Tortillas <b>and</b> <b>chips</b> prepared with GLF, citric acid and hydrogen peroxide had increased lightness when compared to tortillas <b>and</b> <b>chips</b> prepared with GLF alone. Tortillas fried immediately after baking produced oily chips which had excessive pillowing <b>and</b> poor texture. <b>Chips</b> appeared slightly darker when fried immediately compared to chips equilibrated for longer periods.

40|$|Abstract Background Feedstock cost is a {{substantial}} barrier to the commercialization of lignocellulosic biorefineries. Poplar grown using a short rotation coppice (SRC) system {{has the potential to}} provide a low-cost feedstock and economically viable sugar yields for fuels and chemicals production. In the coppice management regime, poplars are harvested after 2 years’ growth to develop the root system and establish the trees. The biomass from these 2 -year-old trees is very heterogeneous, and includes components of leaf, <b>bark,</b> branch, <b>and</b> wood <b>chip.</b> This material is quite different than the samples that have been used in most poplar bioconversion research, which come from mature trees of short rotation forestry (SRF) plantations. If the coppice management regime is to be used, it is important that feedstock growers maximize their revenue from this initial harvest, but the heterogeneous nature of the biomass may be challenging for bioconversion.

40|$|Graduation date: 1977 Douglas-fir {{wood chips}} from Oregon were pulped with kraft green liquor to produce {{semi-chemical}} pulps with properties {{suitable for the}} manufacture of corrugating medium. The effects of five cooking variables were studied, chemical charge, chip size, bark content of <b>chips,</b> pulping temperature, <b>and</b> liquor sulfidity. The combinations of levels of these five independent variables were chosen according to an incomplete block design, which allowed a maximum amount of statistical information to be obtained from only 30 individual cooks. Pulping properties studied were pulp yield, total solids of the waste liquor, pH of the waste liquor, the hypo number test of the pulp, and such pulp strength properties as Concora crush strength, tensile, burst, tear, and stiffness. Chemical charge {{is the most important}} single variable affecting pulp yield, tensile strength, and Concora strength, whereas the sulfidity does not affect the pulp yield but does affect the tensile and Concora strengths. Cooking temperature, <b>bark</b> content, <b>and</b> <b>chip</b> size have less significant effects on pulp yields and pulp strength properties. Green liquor pulps have distinctly darker colors than neutral sulfite pulps from the same wood species, and the former pulp forms denser sheets than the latter. Generally speaking, green liquor semi-chemical Douglas-fir pulps are equivalent to or slightly lower in quality than other commercial semi-chemical pulps in Concora strength, but equal or slightly superior to them in tensile and bursting strengths. The deficiency in Concora strength can be overcome with increased refining, and the slightly higher pulp yield and elimination of the causticizing step make the green liquor semi-chemical process more attractive for corrugating medium...|$|R

The pulp was washed with ultrapure water and filtered, after which the filtrate (black liquor) was collected. The black liquor was acidified to separate the supernatant and precipitation. The Cs (133 Cs and 137 Cs) concentrations in the <b>chip</b> <b>and</b> reaction products were measured. As for wood samples, the majority of Cs was present in black liquor, while only a minor amount of Cs was retained in the pulp (< 1 %). In the case of bark, {{although the majority of}} Cs was present in the black liquor, the proportion of Cs in the pulp was much higher than that in the wood pulp. In addition, the Cs in the precipitation of the bark was higher than that in the wood, possibly because the Cs in the bark was combined with some components, which is insoluble in alkaline solution. Our results suggest that 137 Cs-contaminated Cryptomeria japonica wood can be used in the pulp and paper industries.|$|R

In order to combat soil erosion, different post-fire stabilization treatments can be applied, like adding different mulch materials. In a laboratory experiment we evaluated the effect of adding plant residues, commonly used in post-fire rehabilitation (wheat straw, coconut fibre, Eucalyptus <b>bark</b> <b>and</b> wood <b>chips),</b> at two different rates on the microbial response (respiration, bacterial and fungal growth, using leucine and acetate-in-ergosterol incorporation, and biomass and community structure by means of phospholipids fatty acid analysis) in an acid forest soil affected by a high intensity wildfire. We expected fungal growth to be favoured compared to bacterial growth after adding plant material with high C/N content, especially at the higher rate. Compared to unburnt soil, burnt soil had higher pH (increasing from 4. 4 to 5. 8) and more extractable (available) C, resulting in a relatively higher increase in bacterial compared to fungal growth. Adding Eucalyptus residues to burnt soil, especially wood chips, favoured fungal growth, especially at the higher rate. Straw addition favoured both fungal and bacterial growth and was the substrate most available for decomposition, as indicated by the higher soil respiration rates. Coconut fibre contained less available C. Adding Eucalyptus residue, at both rates, and coconut fibres at the high rate, initially inhibited bacterial growth, resulting in at most a 14 day lag period. Aiming at high fungal to bacterial growth in order to maximize stabilization of soils through fungi suggest Eucalyptus residues to the prime choice for further studies on effective mulching agents, although coconut fibres, with low degradation rates, may also be a suitable choice. Nevertheless, besides aspects related to soil quality, additional information concerning the efficiency of these materials to control post-fire soil erosion should also be considered before their implementation under field conditions...|$|R
