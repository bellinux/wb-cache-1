25|$|Many {{credit cards}} {{can also be}} used in an ATM to {{withdraw}} money against the credit limit extended to the card, but many card issuers charge interest on cash advances before they do so on purchases. The interest on cash advances is commonly charged from the date the withdrawal is made, rather than the monthly <b>billing</b> <b>date.</b> Many card issuers levy a commission for cash withdrawals, even if the ATM belongs to the same bank as the card issuer. Merchants do not offer cashback on credit card transactions because they would pay a percentage commission of the additional cash amount to their bank or merchant services provider, thereby making it uneconomical. Discover is a notable exception to the above. A customer with a Discover card may get up to $120 cash back if the merchant allows it. This amount is simply added to the card holder's cost of the transaction and no extra fees are charged as the transaction is not considered a cash advance.|$|E

40|$|This article {{treats the}} {{theoretical}} consequences of consumer credit card use. A delayed repayment model provides consumer optimization and indifference conditions between cash {{and credit card}} transactions. Under realistic interest and opportunity cost rates, consumers can rationally let a balance revolve about 39 {{percent of the time}} and maintain indifference over time. Key words: credit; consumer behavior; marketing. CON SUMER CREDIT has been an importantfacet of retail purchases in the UnitedStates for many years. Availability of consumer credit has not been uniform among areas of retailing. Some areas such as sewing machines, pianos, and furniture have been con-stantly associated with some form of consumer credit for over a century. Others such as the retail gasoline industry have made consumer credit available only in recent years. Still other areas such as the retail food industry have fluc-tuated over the years with respect to existence, type, and quantity of consumer credit [1, pp. 1 - 3]. Even though credit cards are an important fact of life, little economic analysis exists which concerns their use. This article considers some theoretical consequences of consumer credit card availability in a static consumer behavior con-text. A previous treatment of consumer credit card use by Townshend-Zellner [5] provides a point of departure. Static Utility Analysis Credit cards typically involve three relevant time periods: the initial period in which pur-chases are made, the period beginning with the close of the purchase period (<b>billing</b> <b>date)</b> and ending a specified time after the <b>billing</b> <b>date</b> during which outstanding balances may be liqui-dated without imposition of an interest charge, and the period for which interest charges must be paid on outstanding (revolved) balances. A comparative statics approach can be utilized to analyze the effect of the opportunity fo...|$|E
