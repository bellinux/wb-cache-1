5|$|Barnes {{fell for}} a duck {{in his second}} over, {{bringing}} Bradman to the crease at 1/3. Bradman received a loud reception from the crowd as he came out to bat in his final Test at Lord's. Bradman initially struggled against the English bowling. He faced his first ball from Alec Coxon and inside edged it past his leg stump, before missing the third ball from Coxon and surviving an appeal for leg before wicket (lbw). Bowling from the other end, Bedser beat Bradman with seam movement off the pitch and the ball narrowly skimmed past the stumps. Standing up to the stumps, wicket-keeper Godfrey Evans removed the <b>bails</b> as Bradman leaned forward, but his foot had stayed firmly behind the crease. In another close call, Bradman inside edged a ball towards Yardley at short leg, but the English captain was slow to react and the ball landed in front of him. The Australian captain managed only three runs in the first twenty minutes as Australia had only 14 after the first half-hour. Coxon consistently moved the ball into a cautious Bradman, and the Australians scored only 32 runs in the first hour.|$|E

5|$|Emmett's {{departure}} brought Lindwall's tormentor Edrich to the crease. Bradman advised his speedster not to bowl any bouncers at Edrich, fearing {{such actions}} would {{be interpreted as}} retaliation and provoke a negative media and crowd reaction. After not bowling in the first innings, Miller came on and immediately broke through Washbrook's defences, only to see the ball graze the stumps without dislodging the <b>bails.</b> Washbrook then drove Lindwall for four before Miller bounced him in the next over. After two Miller outswingers had evaded the outside edge of Washbrook, the batsman appeared unsettled. One bouncer was hit over square leg in an uncontrolled manner for a four, and another flew in the air, narrowly evading Loxton at fine leg. Lindwall followed Miller's lead towards Washbrook and was no balled by umpire Davies for dragging his foot beyond the line. Following a disagreement, Davies threw Lindwall his jumper, but the matter faded away and the bowler was not no balled again after discussing the matter with Bradman.|$|E
40|$|Aim: To {{consider}} {{trends in}} <b>bail</b> and remand {{prior to and}} immediately following {{the implementation of the}} <b>Bail</b> Act (2013) on 20 May 2014 and the ‘show cause’ amendments on 28 January 2015. Method: Descriptive analysis of trends in police use of <b>Bail</b> CANs, police <b>bail</b> refusal, court <b>bail</b> refusal and the remand population. Results: The NSW <b>Bail</b> Act (2013) and the ‘show cause’ amendments subsequently made to it have not increased the police or court <b>bail</b> refusal rate above the level that prevailed in the two years prior to the introduction of the Act. This is despite the <b>bail</b> refusal rate for persons charged with ‘show cause’ offences being very high. It is not known whether the ‘show cause’ amendments have increased the likelihood of <b>bail</b> refusal for offences to which they apply or whether persons charged with these offences were always highly likely to be refused <b>bail.</b> The level of agreement between police and courts in relation to <b>bail</b> refusal has increased. Following the introduction of the NSW <b>Bail</b> Act 2013, there was a sharp transient fall in the percentage of defendants refused <b>bail</b> by police and courts. The police <b>bail</b> refusal rate is now around two percentage points lower than it was in 2012 and 2013. The court <b>bail</b> refusal rate has returned to the level that prevailed in 2012 and 2013. The remand population is much higher now than it was prior to the introduction of the NSW <b>Bail</b> Act (2013). The <b>bail</b> reforms at this stage appear to have made little if any contribution to this increase. Instead, it would appear to be due to two factors: (a) a sharp increase in January 2015 in the number of <b>bail</b> breaches that resulted in <b>bail</b> refusal (not the proportion) and (b) an increase in the total number of people with court proceedings commenced against them between December 2014 and March 2015. Conclusion: The NSW <b>Bail</b> Act (2013) (as amended) does not appear at this stage to have increased the percentage of persons refused <b>bail</b> or the size of the remand population. Further monitoring and analysis will be necessary to confirm this...|$|R

5|$|This brought wicket-keeper Godfrey Evans to {{the crease}} and exposed the hosts' lower-order. The {{last of the}} {{specialist}} batsmen, Compton nearly departed soon after when he leaned forward to a leg-side delivery from Johnson's off spin. He overbalanced and stumbled forwards, and Tallon removed the <b>bails.</b> There were no television replays to assist the umpires in those days, and although the attempted stumping appeared close to the naked eye, {{the benefit of the}} doubt was given to the batsman and the appeal rejected. Compton made use of this and attacked Toshack successfully, forcing Bradman to make a bowling change. In fading light, Compton combined with the gloveman to add 75 runs for the seventh wicket in 70 minutes, before Lindwall removed Evans—who attempted a wild slash—to leave England 216/7. Compton reached stumps on 64, accompanied by Alec Bedser, who was on four, as England ended the day at 231/7. Compton had been dropped one-handed on 50 by Tallon, before being missed on 64 by the wicket-keeper from the bowling of Johnston just before stumps.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bail</b> {{applications}} are always matters of urgency. <b>Bail</b> (or the refusal thereof) is entirely non-penal in character: Its refusal may {{not serve as}} a punishment; nor may a court fix an excessive amount or onerous conditions, {{in a bid to}} harass the accused. It is not anticipatory punishment. When considering <b>bail</b> applications, the courts should ignore improper pressure: for example, the threat that the accused will go on hunger strike if <b>bail</b> is refused, or that people opposed to <b>bail</b> will resort to illegal activity if <b>bail</b> is granted.

After Ann <b>bails</b> Leslie out, she tells her that Lindsay built the fence because she is jealous that Leslie was offered the Eagleton job first and wants to get a rise out of her. Ann suggests that Lindsay should be hit with a baseball bat, which gives Leslie the idea to turn Pawnee's side of Lafayette Park into a wiffle ball field, with the fence serving as the outfield wall. Lindsay is impressed by how fast Leslie turned the fence into something positive, and remembers why she and Leslie joined the parks department in the first place. With their relationship on the mend, the two agree {{to get a drink}} together. Later, Leslie returns to the office to throw Ron's party: she takes him to an empty room with steak, whiskey and his favorite movies waiting for him, and reveals that April and Andy's duties were false leads to trick him.

5|$|Miller {{returned}} to the bowling crease in England's second innings. He immediately broke through Washbrook's defences, only to see the ball graze the stumps without dislodging the <b>bails.</b> After two Miller outswingers had evaded the outside edge of Washbrook, the batsman appeared unsettled. One bouncer was hit over square leg in an uncontrolled manner for a four, and another flew in the air, narrowly evading Loxton at fine leg. However, Miller did not take a wicket and ended with 0/15 from 14 overs, but again caught Compton. Not {{for the first time}} during the season, the Australian paceman riled the crowd when he launched a series of short-pitched balls at Edrich, apparently in retaliation for the Englishman's bouncing of Lindwall. The paceman struck Edrich on the body before Bradman intervened and ordered him to stop his short-pitched barrage. In another incident, Miller was playing poker with the Englishmen during a rain delay. When the weather cleared, Hassett beckoned him to return to the field for the resumption. Miller ignored him and the poker match continued against the English players who were not currently batting. He won the pot and pocketed the money, before hurriedly running onto the ground late. When he was on the field and approaching the centre, Miller pulled the money out of his pockets. He brandished the notes to the crowd and taunted his English colleagues. The match ended in a draw after the entire fourth day and half of the fifth day was washed out. England declared upon the resumption of play on the final day and set Australia a target of 317 for victory. The tourists reached 1/92 to ensure a draw.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} various statutory presumptions surrounding <b>bail</b> {{and the risk of}} <b>bail</b> refusal. Method: A total 37, 165 cases where defendants were either granted or refused <b>bail</b> by a Local Court were analysed to determine what impact the presumptions surrounding <b>bail</b> had on the risk of <b>bail</b> refusal. Controls included in the analysis were age; gender; Indigenous status of the defendant; number of concurrent offences; the number of prior criminal convictions; whether the offender had a previous conviction for a breach offence; the number of days between the date of first court appearance and the date of finalisation; whether the defendant had legal representation in the current case; and the plea in the current case at time of finalisation. Results: After adjusting for the effects of other factors, the risk of <b>bail</b> refusal was found to be higher for those charged with offences where there was a presumption against <b>bail</b> or where <b>bail</b> should only be granted in ‘exceptional circumstances’. The risk of <b>bail</b> was also elevated for those with a larger number of prior convictions and/or concurrent offences. Three main anomalies were noted. Firstly, nearly half of those falling into the ‘exceptional circumstance’ category were on <b>bail</b> at their final court appearance. Secondly, factors such as prior criminal record, number of concurrent offences and delay in finalising a case, exert a much stronger influence on the risk of <b>bail</b> refusal than the presumptions surrounding <b>bail.</b> Thirdly, the <b>bail</b> refusal risk was higher for those charged with offences where there was no presumption for or against <b>bail</b> than for those charged with offences involving a presumption against <b>bail.</b> Conclusion: The NSW <b>Bail</b> Act may need some simplification and clarification...|$|R
5|$|Yardley won the toss {{and elected}} to bat. England {{consolidated}} their innings after falling to 2/28. The hosts were content to score slowly and regroup, and Johnson’s first ten overs before lunch yielded only seven runs. However, when Johnson was bowling his second spell after lunch, Jack Crapp hit three driven boundaries in quick succession. Crapp {{was eager to}} use his feet {{to get to the}} pitch of Johnson’s deliveries, and subsequently dealt with the spin fairly comfortably, whereas many of his compatriots stood in their crease and found matters much more difficult. Crapp's counter-attack prompted Bradman to take the second new ball and remove Johnson with the score at 2/96. England then lost three quick wickets to the pacemen to be 5/119. Soon after, Yardley lofted Ernie Toshackwho was bowling leg theoryinto the on-side and Johnson caught him for 22 at forward square leg to leave England at 6/141.
