5|$|The {{group had}} been rehearsing regularly, overseen by McLaren's friend Bernard Rhodes, and had {{performed}} publicly {{for the first}} time. Soon after McLaren's return, Nightingale {{was kicked out of}} the band and Jones, uncomfortable as frontman, took over guitar duties. According to journalist and former McLaren employee Phil Strongman, around this time the band adopted the name QT Jones and the Sex Pistols (or QT Jones & His Sex Pistols, as one Rhodes-designed T-shirt put it). McLaren had <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> <b>with</b> the New York Dolls' Sylvain Sylvain about coming over to England to front the group.|$|E

25|$|The {{case had}} first been brought by Cheryl Churchill, {{a nurse in}} the {{obstetrics}} ward at McDonough District Hospital, operated {{by the city of}} Macomb, Illinois. During a dinner break one night in early 1987, she had <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> <b>with</b> another nurse who was considering transferring to obstetrics. In that conversation she made statements critical of cross-training practices recently implemented by the hospital's nursing supervisor, Cindy Waters, and referred to personal issues between the two. Another nurse who overheard the conversation believed Churchill's comments about Waters had dissuaded her interlocutor from the transfer, and reported it to Waters. After an investigation in which Churchill alleged she was never asked about what she had said, she was fired.|$|E
500|$|In {{his first}} radio {{broadcast}} upon seizing power, {{which did not}} occur until 16:00, Khánh assailed the former regime for its performance during its three months at the top. He said [...] "The political, economic, and social situation in the countryside still offers no promising prospect. There has not been one single compensation worthy of the sacrifices accepted daily by the soldiers." [...] He alluded to a neutralist plot, claiming that [...] "some persons" [...] had joined [...] "with the colonialists standing for neutralism in order {{to pave the way}} for the Communists to enslave us". Khánh's broadcast was signed by 17 generals and 32 other senior officers. Many observers were immediately sceptical of the claims of neutralism and regarded personal ambition as the motivating factor all along. An anonymous source close to the plotters told The New York Times that [...] "We were anxious about them indeed...and we had conclusive proof that they had <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> <b>with</b> the French in terms of a neutralized Vietnam and that North Vietnam had given support to the plan", explicitly naming Kim and Xuan.|$|E
500|$|Trevor Slattery, {{having been}} {{captured}} {{at the end}} of Iron Man 3, is now being held in Seagate Prison. At the prison, he is living luxuriously, having his own personal [...] "butler", Herman, as well as other inmates who act as his fan club and protection from other inmates. Looking on at the attention Slattery receives in the cafeteria is Justin Hammer, who wonders what makes him so special. Slattery has <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> <b>with</b> a documentary filmmaker, Jackson Norriss, to chronicle the events of the Mandarin situation seen in Iron Man 3. Norriss, trying to learn more about Slattery personally, recounts his past from his first casting as a child as well as starring in a failed CBS pilot. Norriss eventually informs Slattery that his portrayal has angered some people, including the actual Ten Rings terrorist group, which Slattery did not know existed. Norriss tells him the history of the Mandarin and the terrorist group, before revealing that he is actually a member of the group. The real reason for Norriss interviewing Slattery is to break him out of prison so he can meet the actual Mandarin. Hearing this, Slattery still has no idea of the full ramifications of his posing as the Mandarin.|$|E

500|$|Burt first {{appears in}} [...] "A Wedding". Rachel {{does not want}} to sit next to Sam Evans (Chord Overstreet) at Santana Lopez (Naya Rivera) and Brittany Pierce's (Heather Morris) wedding. She states that Burt and Carole will be there, and that she hasn’t <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> <b>with</b> them {{recently}} (presumbably since Finn's death), and doesn’t want to hurt them. Mercedes Jones (Amber Riley) reassure her that they’ll want her to move on, just like they did with their first spouses’ death. They both indeed support her to find love again with Sam. He officiates the wedding, which much to his surprise, his son is also getting married. He is in the flashback episode [...] "2009", which is set during the same time period as the show's pilot episode. Burt is contacted by McKinley High counsellor Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays) to tell him that Kurt seemed to be isolated and had shown interest in a pamphlet on suicide. Burt tells Kurt that he must join a school team within a week, or face punishment. Although Burt had meant a sports team, when Kurt enthusiastically tells Burt that he has join the glee club, he accepts this as an adequate substitute in part due to its competitive aspect. In the show's final episode, [...] "Dreams Come True", Burt and Carole attend the rededication ceremony of the McKinley High auditorium in the year 2020, when it is renamed the [...] "Finn Hudson Memorial Auditorium". He enjoys the final performance from the New Directions of all generations and take a bow with the other Glee Cast members.|$|E

With all of the festivals and package tours that go through America, I've <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> <b>with</b> our manager and agent for over 10 years now about doing something that focuses on the more progressive, musician-oriented side of hard rock and metal.

2500|$|The Sherritt {{home was}} a typical period two-room slab hut, which Dan {{could see through the}} bedroom and kitchen to Joe in the back. When Weekes had first knocked, Constable William Duross had <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> <b>with</b> Sherritt and his wife in the kitchen. He joined the three other policemen, Henry Armstrong, Thomas P. Dowling, and Robert Alexander, in the bedroom. Even though they were big men, well-armed and {{experienced}} [...] "protectors", they remained there in the dark in fear while Sherritt was shot. Byrne then told Ellen Barry to open {{the front door of the}} hut. When she did, Dan Kelly was revealed a few feet away. Joe ordered the frightened women to leave the house, then the outlaws began shooting into the walls of the bedroom. The police threw themselves to the floor.|$|E
2500|$|Gingrich {{has called}} for a {{stronger}} foreign policy, {{along the lines of the}} [...] "Reagan model" [...] of toughness", having been critical of the [...] "weakness" [...] of recent administrations' policies. In 2006 Gingrich criticized George W. Bush's stance toward North Korea and Iran, stating that it was [...] "a form of appeasement". He said, [...] "We have accepted the lawyer-diplomatic fantasy that talking while North Korea builds bombs and missiles while the Iranians build bombs and missiles is progress." [...] He has also severely criticized the foreign policy of President Obama for being too weak. Gingrich singled out Obama's responses to terrorism, North Korea, and Iran as particularly problematic. On North Korea he said, [...] "There was amazing symbolism in North Korea deciding to launch a missile the very day President Obama was speaking to Europeans about his fantasy of nuclear disarmament. The West has talked with North Korea for over 15 years and they just keep building nuclear weapons and missiles. We have <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> <b>with</b> the Iranians for a decade and they continue to build nuclear capability and missiles." ...|$|E
