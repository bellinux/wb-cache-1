25|$|The Ara macaws have a Neotropical {{distribution}} from Mexico to Argentina. The {{centre of}} Ara distribution is the Amazon Basin and the Panama–Colombia border region; each {{with as many}} as four species found together (marginally five where the military macaw approach the western Amazon). Seven species are found in Bolivia, but no single locality in that (or any other) country surpasses four species. The most widespread species, the scarlet macaw, is (or was) distributed throughout large parts of Central America and the Amazon. On the other hand, the <b>blue-throated</b> <b>macaw</b> and the red-fronted macaw have tiny distributions in Bolivia. The overall range of many species and the genus as a whole has declined in historical times due to human activities. The military macaw is distributed from northern Mexico to northern Argentina, but the distribution is discontinuous, with populations in Mexico, a large gap, then a population in the Venezuelan Coastal Range and a population along the Andes from western Venezuela to northern Argentina. The blue-and-yellow macaw was expiated from Trinidad in the 1960s, as well as retreating from northern Argentina, and several species apparently became extinct in the islands of the Caribbean.|$|E
2500|$|The Ara macaws are {{generally}} fairly adaptable in their habitat requirements; this reaches its extreme in the scarlet macaw, which as suggested in its widespread distribution, uses most habitat types from humid rainforest to open woodlands to savannah. The only requirement is sufficient large trees, {{which is where}} they obtain their food and breeding holes. The other species are slightly more narrow in their habitat choices, but the need for large trees is universal.

50|$|<b>Blue-throated</b> <b>macaws</b> {{are most}} {{frequently}} found in monogamous pairs, but small groups of 7-9 do occur and one large roosting group of 70 is known. It is not known if these macaws will pair with another mate if their original mate dies. Their main mode of locomotion is flying, {{but they are also}} able to climb trees, maneuver along branches and walk on the ground. These birds are active during the day and usually stay in one general area. <b>Blue-throated</b> <b>macaws</b> communicate mostly by sound. When they suspect danger, they emit a very loud alarming call and promptly fly off. <b>Blue-throated</b> <b>macaws</b> are known {{to communicate with each other}} with quiet caws as well.|$|R
50|$|<b>Blue-throated</b> <b>macaws</b> usually breed once a {{year but}} if the eggs or nestlings are lost, they may produce a second clutch in the same {{breeding}} season. A clutch consists of one to three eggs and incubates for 26 days. Nestlings have a mass of approximately 18 g at hatching and fledge at 13 to 14 weeks. The young macaws are still fully dependent upon their parents for food after they fledge until {{they are capable of}} foraging by themselves. Even after this occurs, it has been observed that young <b>blue-throated</b> <b>macaws</b> will stay with their parents up to a year. During this time, the parents will skip an entire breeding season. <b>Blue-throated</b> <b>macaws</b> reach sexual maturity at about 5 years of age.|$|R
50|$|<b>Blue-throated</b> <b>macaws</b> are early nesters and utilize these rare {{resources}} of nest holes {{before the other}} macaws are in breeding condition.|$|R

40|$|Rediscovered in {{the wild}} twenty years ago, the {{breeding}} biology of wild <b>Blue-throated</b> <b>Macaws</b> remains largely unexplored, yet is essential to its effective conservation and recovery. Here, we analyse reproductive parameters in an intensively managed wild population of <b>Blue-throated</b> <b>Macaws,</b> providing the first data on the breeding biology of this critically endangered species. During the six-year study period, 2007 – 2012, the number of active breeding pairs either remained constant or decreased, depending on the site, and no new breeding pairs were discovered despite extensive searching. We documented nesting attempts in natural cavities in dead palms or live hardwoods, and artificial nest boxes. Egg-laying was concentrated during the end of dry season {{and the beginning of}} the wet season, August through December. Hatching failure was the greatest cause of egg losses. Half of the breeding attempts of <b>Blue-throated</b> <b>Macaws</b> produced at least one fledging, on average two, after a 85 days nestling period. An average of 4. 3 nestlings per year fledged from all known wild nests combined. Each pair lost roughly 65 % of its initial reproductive investment at each nesting attempt. In most successful nesting attempts of individualized pairs, a new nesting attempt was not detected the following year. All monitored breeding pairs showed high nest site fidelity, reusing hardwood-tree cavities and nest boxes. Our findings will aid conservation efforts by refining current actions and prompting new approaches towards the conservation and recovery o...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Blue-throated</b> <b>macaws</b> {{do not eat}} {{seeds and}} nuts {{to the same extent}} as many other macaw species do. Instead, they eat {{primarily}} fruit from large palms.

50|$|The Convention on International Trade protects certain {{endangered}} species by law, and prohibits {{them from being}} traded internationally. Several true parrots from the Ara genus (great green macaw, <b>blue-throated</b> <b>macaw,</b> scarlet macaw, military macaw), are all protected under Appendix 1 of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species.|$|E
50|$|Olson and Máiz López {{showed that}} the Saint Croix macaw is within the same size range as the <b>blue-throated</b> <b>macaw</b> and the Lear's macaw. The length of the tibiotarsus is shorter than in the <b>blue-throated</b> <b>macaw</b> but longer than in the Lear's macaw, while the lengths of the coracoid, carpometacarpus, and femur are smaller. In {{addition}} to the size, they observed that the pectoral attachment on the humerus is less excavated while the capital groove (a groove separating {{two parts of the}} head of the humerus) is wider; the head of the femur is more massive and when seen from the posterior side, more excavated under the head, neck, and trochanter. Furthermore, the more robust shaft of the femur sets it specifically apart from the Lear's macaw while the tibiotarsus is more robust with a flared distal extremity.|$|E
50|$|The <b>blue-throated</b> <b>macaw</b> has a {{very small}} {{population}} {{and is on the}} verge of extinction in the wild. It is listed on the IUCN Red List as critically endangered. It is also listed in Appendix I by CITES. Trapping is illegal as blue-throated macaws have been protected by the national legislation of Bolivia and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) since 1986. According to locals the wild population of the <b>blue-throated</b> <b>macaw</b> in the 1980s was thought to number 500-1000 individuals. Although trapping ceased later in the 1990s, the wild population remains low, with previous estimates of between 110-130 individuals, that more recently have been increased to about 350-400 after surveys by Armonia Association and the Loro Parque Fundacion found additional birds. The World Parrot Trust has many volunteers and employees working to monitor the nests to protect the chicks from predation. Chicks are also examined periodically to ensure that they are healthy and receiving adequate food from their parents. If necessary, the chick is supplemented with formula. Nest boxes have been built, current nest sites improved, and support from the local landowners has been established. In 2008, American Bird Conservancy partnered with the World Land Trust-US, Loro Parque Fundacion, and Assiociacion Armonia to create the <b>blue-throated</b> <b>macaw</b> Reserve. In 2010, the reserve was expanded by 2,800 acres (formerly Juvena Ranch) and is now 11,500 acres.|$|E
50|$|The <b>blue-throated</b> <b>macaw</b> {{is about}} 85 cm long {{including}} {{the length of}} its tail feathers and has a wingspan of approximately three feet or 0.9 m. It weighs about 900 g to 1100 g. There is little easily observable sexual dimorphism; however, males {{tend to be a}} little bigger than females with approximate masses of 750 g and 950 g respectively.Upperparts are turquoise-blue, slightly duller on crown and brighter on rump. Underparts largely bright yellow but the vent is pale blue. It has bare facial patch obscured by blue feather-lines merging into blue lower cheek and throat, separated from crown by narrow yellow stripe and bare pink skin around base of the large, black bill. On the face there is a sparsely feathered patch of skin near the base of the large dark-colored bill that has 5 or 6 horizontal stripes of blue feathers which are unique for every <b>blue-throated</b> <b>macaw</b> and can be used to individually identify adults.|$|E

Parrots International strives to form strategic cooperative partnerships with organizations and field projects. The majority of Parrots International supported projects are in Central and South American and the Caribbean. Examples include the Spix's macaw; Lear's macaw; Puerto Rican parrot; hyacinth macaw; great green macaw; military macaw; blue-fronted amazon; slender-billed conure; Pfrimer's parakeet; Bahama parrot; and the <b>blue-throated</b> <b>macaw.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>blue-throated</b> <b>macaw</b> (Ara glaucogularis; {{previously}} Ara caninde), {{also known}} as the Caninde macaw or Wagler's macaw, is a macaw endemic to a small area of north-central Bolivia, known as Los Llanos de Moxos, this species is cultural heritage of Bolivia, Recent population and range estimates suggests that about 350-400 individuals remain in the wild. The main causes of their demise is capture for the pet trade. It is currently considered critically endangered and the parrot is protected by trading prohibitions.|$|E
50|$|Ara {{is from a}} Tupi indian {{word for}} macaw; glauco (glacous latin for greyish-blue or green) + gularis (latin: throat). The <b>Blue-throated</b> <b>macaw</b> is one of 8 extant species (and a few extinct species) in genus Ara of large long-tailed parrots collectively called macaws. The genus Ara is one of six genera of Central and South American macaws in the tribe Arini, which also {{includes}} all the other long-tailed New World parrots. Tribe Arini together with the short-tailed Amazon and allied parrots and a few miscellaneous genera make up subfamily Arinae of Neotropical parrots in family Psittacidae of true parrots.|$|E
50|$|Several {{species and}} one genus have become extinct in recent centuries. A second genus is extinct in the wild. Over {{a third of}} the extant species are {{classified}} as threatened by the IUCN. A few of these are in imminent danger of extinction with fewer than 500 individuals in the wild or in captivity: glaucous macaw, Spix's macaw, <b>blue-throated</b> <b>macaw,</b> Puerto Rican parrot, and indigo-winged parrot. The chief reasons for decline in parrot populations are habitat loss through deforestation by clear-cutting, burning, and flooding by construction of dams, capture for the pet trade, and introduction of non-native predators.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>blue-throated</b> <b>macaw</b> {{lives in}} the Gran Chaco of the Beni Department of Bolivia, nesting in [...] "Islas" [...] (islands) of palm trees that dot the level plains. It is not a forest {{dwelling}} bird. This species {{is one of the}} rarest in the world, There are two areas inhabited by two sub-populations of Ara glaucogularis: one is to the northwest of Trinidad (the capital city of Beni), and the other is to the south of Trinidad. This complex landscape consists of grasslands, marshes, forest islands, and corridors of forests along waterways. They occur most often between the elevations of 200 and 300 m.|$|E
5000|$|Blue-throated macaws usually nests in {{cavities}} of palm trees, {{most often}} Attalea phalerata, although it will nest in other palm species as well. Dead palms are the preferred nest {{as they are}} hollowed out by large grubs after the tree has died. Nesting pairs of blue-throated macaws don’t consistently stay at one nest for consecutive breeding seasons and will usually search for different nesting sites every year. In the wild the <b>blue-throated</b> <b>macaw</b> often competes for nesting-holes in trees with the blue-and-yellow macaw, green-winged macaw, scarlet macaw, large woodpeckers, toco toucans, barn owls, bats, and bees. [...] The number of suitable nest trees has been reduced by land clearing in its range.|$|E
50|$|Wetmore {{placed the}} Saint Croix macaw in the macaw genus Ara {{based on a}} single tibiotarsus, a {{placement}} confirmed by Olson who reexamined the bone. The discovery of a second specimen by Máiz López at Puerto Rico consisting of several bones confirmed this placement. The Saint Croix macaw is distinguished from other macaws because of the intermediate size of the tibiotarsus and carpometacarpus. Olson and Máiz López determined {{that the size of}} this species is only comparable to geographically distant macaws, namely the Lear's macaw (Anodorhynchus leari) from Brazil and the <b>blue-throated</b> <b>macaw</b> (Ara glaucogularis) from Bolivia. Their detailed analysis of these and the other bones showed distinct differences from those species, particularly from the genus Anodorhynchus. Based on this, authorities generally recognize the Saint Croix macaw as a valid species.|$|E
5000|$|The company {{presented}} eight {{proposals for}} the registration {{of some of}} its bird breeding operations to the CITES Secretariat in 2006 and 2007. The proposals were discussed at various CITES meetings. [...] During the Fourteenth meeting of the Conference of the Parties all of its requests for registration were rejected based {{on the grounds that the}} birds in question were not native to Philippines and the company could not verify the legality of its acquirement of their breeding stocks. However the vote was a close one, members of the European Union supporting registration and some countries that are the homelands of birds in question objecting. Had the request been approved Birds International would have been able to commercially trade the following birds: Goffin's cockatoo of Indonesia, yellow crowned amazon parrot of Central and South America, yellow headed amazon parrot of Central America, red crowned amazon parrot of Mexico, hyacinth macaw of Brazil, <b>blue-throated</b> <b>macaw</b> and red fronted macaw of Bolivia and the military macaw of Central and South America.|$|E
50|$|The Saint Croix macaw (Ara autocthones) is an {{extinct species}} of parrot. The last populations {{lived on the}} Caribbean islands Saint Croix and Puerto Rico. It was {{originally}} described by Alexander Wetmore in 1937 based on a subfossil limb bone unearthed by L. J. Korn in 1934 from a kitchen midden at an Amerindian archeological site on Saint Croix. A second specimen was described by Storrs L. Olson and Edgar J. Máiz López based on various limb and shoulder bones excavated from a similar site on Puerto Rico, while a possible third specimen from Montserrat has been reported. The species {{is one of two}} medium-sized macaws of the Caribbean, the other being the smaller Cuban red macaw (Ara tricolor). Its bones are distinct from Amazon parrots {{as well as from the}} other medium-sized but geographically distant Lear's macaw (Anodorhynchus leari) and <b>blue-throated</b> <b>macaw</b> (Ara glaucogularis). The natural range is unknown because parrots were regularly traded between islands by indigenous people. Like other parrot species in the Caribbean, the extinction of the Saint Croix macaw is believed to be linked to the arrival of humans in the region.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: We {{developed}} a demographic model {{to perform a}} population viability analysis (PVA) of the Blue-throated Ma-caw (Ara glaucogularis), a critically endangered species endemic to Bolivia. PVA simulations were run using individual-based (VORTEX 9. 72) and cohort-based (RAMAS GIS 4. 0) programs. A baseline simulation allowed {{for the assessment of}} the status of the species based on estimates of extinction risk and population declines under current conditions of abun-dance and habitat availability. The role of multiple demographic, environmental, and anthropogenic parameters was evaluated to assess changes affecting population declines and extinction risk. The baseline simulation showed that the <b>Blue-throated</b> <b>Macaw</b> has a relatively low probability of extinction during the next fifty years. However, continuing threats, including declines in abundance, small population size, and low population growth rates, make this species highly vulnerable to any change. Elasticity analysis of the baseline simulation and sensitivity analysis of changes in different demographic parameters demonstrated that increases in adult mortality had the greatest effect on population growth rate and extinction risk. Furthermore, simulations of anthropogenic impacts showed that small increases in habitat loss (2 %) and population harvesting (3 %) had drastic effects on population decline. Results from this study emphasize the need for conservation actions aimed at protecting breeding individuals (i. e., decreasing adult mortality), preventing poaching ac-tivities, and promoting the conservation of available habitat for nesting sites...|$|E
40|$|Understanding {{the effect}} of habitat {{fragmentation}} is a fundamental yet complicated aim of many ecological studies. Beni savanna is a naturally fragmented forest habitat, where forest islands exhibit variation in resources and threats. To understand how the availability of resources and threats affect the use of forest islands by parrots, we applied occupancy modeling to quantify use and detection probabilities for 12 parrot species on 60 forest islands. The presence of urucuri (Attalea phalerata) and macaw (Acrocomia aculeata) palms, the number of tree cavities on the islands, {{and the presence of}} selective logging,and fire were included as covariates associated with availability of resources and threats. The model-selection analysis indicated that both resources and threats variables explained the use of forest islands by parrots. For most species, the best models confirmed predictions. The number of cavities was positively associated with use of forest islands by 11 species. The area of the island and the presence of macaw palm showed a positive association with the probability of use by seven and five species, respectively, while selective logging and fire showed a negative association with five and six species, respectively. The <b>Blue-throated</b> <b>Macaw</b> (Ara glaucogularis), the critically endangered parrot species endemic to our study area, was the only species that showed a negative association with both threats. Monitoring continues to be essential to evaluate conservation and management actions of parrot populations. Understanding of how species are using this natural fragmented habitat will help determine which fragments should be preserved and which conservation actions are needed...|$|E
