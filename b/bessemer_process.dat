5|$|The {{modern era}} in {{steelmaking}} {{began with the}} introduction of Henry Bessemer's <b>Bessemer</b> <b>process</b> in 1855, the raw material for which was pig iron. His method let him produce steel in large quantities cheaply, thus mild steel came to be used for most purposes for which wrought iron was formerly used. The Gilchrist-Thomas process (or basic <b>Bessemer</b> <b>process)</b> was an improvement to the <b>Bessemer</b> <b>process,</b> made by lining the converter with a basic material to remove phosphorus.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{introduction}} of the <b>Bessemer</b> <b>process</b> and other modern production techniques, steel was expensive and was only used where no cheaper alternative existed, particularly for the cutting edge of knives, razors, swords, and other items where a hard, sharp edge was needed. It was also used for springs, including those used in clocks and watches.|$|E
5|$|During the Civil War, Troy's {{industries}} {{played a}} key role in supporting the Union cause. The Burden Ironworks is said to have supplied all the Union Army's horseshoes, and another local ironworks supplied the USS Monitors hull plating. Its owners would later produce the first <b>Bessemer</b> <b>process</b> steel in the United States after the war.|$|E
50|$|In 1857 Mr. Griswold {{became a}} large {{owner of the}} iron mills of Troy having been granted the US <b>Bessemer</b> steel <b>process</b> patents {{important}} for expanding the Rensselaer Iron and Steel Works business.|$|R
50|$|Navigable terrain, waterways, and ports spurred an {{unprecedented}} construction of transportation infrastructure throughout the region. The region {{is a global}} leader in advanced manufacturing and research and development, with significant innovations in both production processes and business organization. John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil set precedents for centralized pricing, uniform distribution, and controlled product standards through Standard Oil, which started as a consolidated refinery in Cleveland. Cyrus McCormick's Reaper and other manufacturers of agricultural machinery consolidated into International Harvester in Chicago. Andrew Carnegie's steel production integrated large-scale open-hearth and <b>Bessemer</b> <b>processes</b> into the world's most efficient and profitable mills. The largest, most comprehensive monopoly in the world, United States Steel, consolidated steel production throughout the region. Many of the world's largest employers began in the Great Lakes region.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{example is}} the <b>Bessemer</b> steel <b>process</b> - <b>Bessemer</b> sold a patent for his {{advanced}} steelmaking process and was sued by the purchasers who couldn't get it to work. In the end Bessemer set up his own steel company because {{he knew how to}} do it, even though he could not convey it to his patent users. Bessemer's company became {{one of the largest in}} the world and changed the face of steel making.|$|R
5|$|Even though Britain led {{the world}} in steel production, the Royal Navy was slow to adopt steel warships. The <b>Bessemer</b> <b>process</b> for steel {{manufacture}} produced too many imperfections for large-scale use on ships. French manufacturers used the Siemens-Martin process to produce adequate steel, but British technology lagged behind. The first all-steel warships built by the Royal Navy were the dispatch vessels Iris and Mercury, laid down in 1875 and 1876.|$|E
5|$|Steel was {{produced}} in bloomery furnaces for thousands of years, but its large-scale, industrial use only began after more efficient production methods were devised in the 17th century, with the production of blister steel and then crucible steel. With {{the invention of the}} <b>Bessemer</b> <b>process</b> in the mid-19th century, a new era of mass-produced steel began. This was followed by the Siemens-Martin process and then the Gilchrist-Thomas process that refined the quality of steel. With their introductions, mild steel replaced wrought iron.|$|E
5|$|In 1875, Edward Windsor Richards {{became the}} General Manager of the Middlesbrough Ironworks. Richards {{was in charge}} of the design and {{construction}} of the new plant at Eston, the Cleveland Steel Works. It had three coke fired haematite blast furnaces. Richards' work helped to improve the <b>Bessemer</b> <b>process</b> for making steel, in the case when the ore is rich in phosphorus, and an alkaline rock (dolomite, limestone or magnesite) is used. This variant is called the Gilchrist-Thomas process, after its inventor Sidney Gilchrist Thomas who persuaded Richards to adopt it.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bessemer,</b> {{whose own}} <b>process</b> for {{producing}} steel was not economically viable without Mushet's method for improving quality, decided to pay Mushet an annual pension of £300, a very considerable sum, which {{he paid for}} over 20 years; possibly {{with a view to}} keeping the Mushets from legal action.|$|R
50|$|Contiguous {{with the}} {{investment}} in the furnaces was an investment in the <b>Bessemer</b> conversion <b>process</b> itself, although this investment became uncommon beyond the mid-1870s. Several Lancashire businesses developed an interest in a short space of time, including the Barrow Hematite Steel Co. which started in 1864 and operated both furnaces and converters. Others included the old ironworks firm of Rushton and Eckersley, which installed converters around 1860 and was renamed as the Bolton Iron and Steel Co, and the Mersey Steel and Iron Co which installed then in 1865.|$|R
50|$|With {{the rail}} {{building}} era {{coming to an}} end, {{the rise of the}} automotive industry in southern Ontario provided the Hamilton steel mills of the Steel Company of Canada and the Dominion Foundries and Steel Company with a new market. Dofasco introduced the basic oxygen steelmaking at its mills in Hamilton in 1954. In {{the latter part of the}} century, Algoma, in Sault Ste. Marie, built coke oven batteries and blast furnaces, while phasing out the open-hearth and <b>Bessemer</b> steel-making <b>process</b> in favour of the basic oxygen steel-making.|$|R
5|$|The {{construction}} of the railways in the mid-19th century made the Lake District, and Keswick in particular, more accessible to visitors of modest means. The original impetus for building the Cockermouth, Keswick and Penrith Railway (CKP) line came from heavy industry: the new <b>Bessemer</b> <b>process</b> of steelmaking brought a great demand for the rich iron ore from west Cumberland and the coking coal from Durham {{on the east side}} of the country. The CKP was built to enable ore and coal to be brought together at steel foundries in both counties. The line opened for goods traffic in 1864, and the following year it began to carry passengers. Fares varied, but holidaymakers could buy excursion tickets at discounted prices, such as six shillings for the 170-mile return journey from Preston to Keswick.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Industrial Revolution, Northern England had plentiful coal and water power while the poor agriculture in the uplands meant that labour in the area was cheap. Mining and milling, which had been practiced on a small scale in the area for generations, began to grow and centralise. The boom in industrial textile manufacture is sometimes attributed to the damp climate and soft water making it easier to wash and work fibres, although the success of Northern fabric mills has no single clear source. Readily available coal and the discovery of large iron deposits in Cumbria and Cleveland allowed ironmaking and, with the invention of the <b>Bessemer</b> <b>process,</b> steelmaking to take root in the region. High quality steel in turn fed the shipyards that opened along the coasts, especially on Tyneside and at Barrow-in-Furness.|$|E
5|$|Steel {{made from}} cast iron through oxygenation: The {{earliest}} known production of steel {{is a piece}} of ironware excavated from an archaeological site in Anatolia (Kaman-Kalehoyuk) and is about 4,000 years old. Other ancient steel comes from East Africa, dating back to 1400 BC. In the 4th century BC steel weapons like the Falcata were produced in the Iberian Peninsula, while Noric steel was used by the Roman military. The Chinese, who had been producing cast iron from the late Spring and Autumn period (722–481 BC), produced steel by the 2nd century BC through a process of decarburization, i.e. using bellows to pump large amounts of oxygen on to molten cast iron. This was first described in the Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD) book Huainanzi, compiled by scholars under Prince Liu An (179–122 BC). For steel, they used both quenching (i.e. rapid cooling) and tempering (i.e. slow cooling) methods of heat treatment. Much later, the American inventor William Kelly (1811–1888) brought four Chinese metallurgists to Eddyville, Kentucky in 1845, whose expertise in steelmaking influenced his ideas about air injection to reduce carbon content of iron; his invention anticipated the <b>Bessemer</b> <b>process</b> of English inventor Henry Bessemer (1813–1898).|$|E
50|$|Sandvik is {{a global}} company founded in 1862 by Göran Fredrik Göransson in Sandviken, Sweden. Sandvik is a {{high-technology}} engineering group in tools and tooling systems for metal cutting, equipment, tools and services for the mining and construction industries, products in advanced stainless steel and special alloys as well as products for industrial heating. Sandvik has about 43,000 employees and sales in more than 150 countries. Invoiced sales is approximately SEK 82 billion (2016).Sandvik was the first company to commercially exploit the <b>Bessemer</b> Steel <b>process.</b> The first blast furnace was installed by an English engineer and is now on display in a park in Sandviken. Products are now manufactured in India and China.|$|R
5000|$|Kelly {{applied for}} a patent after <b>Bessemer</b> {{patented}} the <b>process,</b> and was granted patent 17,628 in 1857. The core claim of his patent was [...] "Blowing blasts of air, either hot or cold, up and through a mass of liquid iron, the oxygen in the air combining with the carbon in the iron, causing a greatly increased heat and boiling commotion in the fluid mass and decarbonizing and refining the iron." ...|$|R
50|$|An {{important}} {{industrial use}} of ganister was as the lining bricks for the acid Bessemer converter, a steel-making process developed in 1856. The process could not initially be used successfully by steelworks other than Bessemer's though, owing to its {{need for a}} low phosphorus iron ore. This {{led to the development}} of the basic <b>Bessemer</b> or Gilchrist-Thomas <b>process,</b> which used a calcined dolomite lining instead of the siliceous ganister. This alkaline lining with a lime flux reacted with the molten iron to form a slag that removed the phosphorus impurities.|$|R
25|$|These {{purchases}} {{took place}} {{only a short}} time before the <b>Bessemer</b> <b>process</b> (announced 1856) began to undercut the old iron-making processes. That was bad luck but possibly they should have observed the <b>Bessemer</b> <b>process</b> more carefully before expanding the factory especially as Galloways, who supplied the bridges for the Ulverston and Lancaster Railway, were key players {{in the development of the}} <b>Bessemer</b> <b>process.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{introduction}} of the <b>Bessemer</b> <b>process,</b> enabling steel to be made inexpensively, led to the era of great expansion of railways {{that began in the}} late 1860s. Steel rails lasted several times longer than iron. Steel rails made heavier locomotives possible, allowing for longer trains and improving the productivity of railroads. The <b>Bessemer</b> <b>process</b> introduced nitrogen into the steel, which caused the steel to become brittle with age. The open hearth furnace began to replace the <b>Bessemer</b> <b>process</b> near the end of 19th century, improving the quality of steel and further reducing costs. Thus steel completely replaced the use of iron in rails, thus becoming standard for all railways.|$|E
25|$|The town's {{fortunes}} as a port waned rapidly when ports {{with much}} larger shipping capacity, such as Bristol and Liverpool, {{began to take}} over its main trade. Its peak of prosperity was in the 19th century when West Cumberland experienced a brief boom because haematite found locally {{was one of the}} few iron ores that could be used to produce steel by the original <b>Bessemer</b> <b>process.</b> Improvements to the <b>Bessemer</b> <b>process</b> and the development of the open hearth process removed this advantage. As with most mining communities the inter-war depression was severe; this was exacerbated for West Cumbria by Irish independence which suddenly placed tariff barriers on the principal export market.|$|E
50|$|The {{financial}} panic of 1857 {{resulted in}} Kelly's bankruptcy, {{and he was}} forced to sell his patent. The Kelly patent and the Bessemer patent were licensed for steelmaking in Pennsylvania, at the Cambria Iron Works, starting in 1857. With the patents jointly licensed, invention priority disputes became of little interest to the business world. Kelly received only about 5% of the patent royalties paid to Bessemer, and Bessemer's name was used for the <b>process.</b> <b>Bessemer</b> already had a well known steel making operation in England, and Kelly was little known.|$|R
50|$|Due to {{shortage}} of both labour and capital, little {{progress was made}} and in 1849 the government revoked the three Talabot concessions.In 1852 they were restored after Napoleon III had taken power.In 1857 the Mokta el Hadid mine was found, and the Talabots gained the concession.The ore was in a vein 2500 m long and 10 to 50 m wide.The magnetite ore was 70% pure iron.This ore, free of sulfur and phosphorus, was much more suitable for the <b>Bessemer</b> and Martin <b>processes</b> than the poorer ores high in phosphorus that are typical of France, Belgium, Luxembourg and Germany.|$|R
25|$|Cornwall Iron Furnace became {{obsolete}} by the 1880s. The <b>Bessemer</b> and open-hearth <b>processes</b> {{of creating}} steel, {{the replacement of}} charcoal with coke and anthracite coal, the discovery of iron deposits at the Iron Range in Minnesota near Lake Superior, and the building of modern factories in Pittsburgh, Steelton and Bethlehem brought {{about the end of}} iron production in Cornwall. Cornwall Furnace no longer earned a profit in its last ten years of operation and the last owner, Robert Habersham Coleman, had it shut down on February 11, 1883. In 1932, the furnace and ancillary buildings were deeded by Margaret Coleman Buckingham and have since been restored and open to the public.|$|R
25|$|The American Civil War {{boosted the}} city's economy with {{increased}} iron and armament demand. Andrew Carnegie began steel production in 1875 at the Edgar Thomson Steel Works in North Braddock, Pennsylvania, which {{evolved into the}} Carnegie Steel Company. He adopted the <b>Bessemer</b> <b>process</b> to increase production.|$|E
25|$|In 1866, Colburn founded Engineering in London as {{a weekly}} rival to The Engineer using funds {{provided}} by Henry Bessemer, the English engineer and inventor known chiefly {{in connection with}} the <b>Bessemer</b> <b>process</b> for the manufacture of steel. Engineering was an instant success and soon overtook The Engineer as Colburn’s writing style and wide engineering knowledge gave readers the information they needed.|$|E
25|$|A {{prime example}} of the decline is the Cyfarthfa Ironworks. Robert Crawshay ('Iron King') {{can be seen as}} {{one of the main reasons}} for the {{downfall}} of Cyfarthfa. The Crawshays refused to modernise by replacing iron production with steel production, using the newly discovered <b>Bessemer</b> <b>process.</b> This led to the closure of the works in 1874, which caused economic hardship and unemployment in Merthyr.|$|E
40|$|The {{metallurgical}} {{revolution of}} increased supply and decreased cost followed three stages: 1) coke {{use in the}} blast furnace, 2) puddling process for wrought iron (WI) and 3) <b>Bessemer</b> or Siemens <b>processes</b> for steel. The second {{gave rise to the}} conversion from wooden (iron-reinforced) machines to iron machines such as railroad engines, ships and long-span bridges, all hot-riveted. The self-made mechanical engineers raised the precision, scale and speed of mechanical shaping technology; this was transferred from WI to ingot steel with little difficulty for the same products with increased strength. Accurately measured mechanical properties of WI and steel were related {{for the first time to}} microstructure and processing by David Kirkaldy to improve Clyde-built ships and to propel metallurgy from artisanal to science-based...|$|R
50|$|When the tramway {{opened in}} 1796, a hemp rope was {{used on the}} incline but {{it was found that}} this was too weak and a wrought-iron chain soon {{replaced}} it. This also proved not to be strong enough and in 1809 it was replaced. The new chain had links 5 inches (127 mm) long and it was manufactured in Birmingham at a cost of £500. Records suggest that the chain was also replaced in 1817 and again in 1831. It was about 1,075 yards (983 m) long and weighed about 7 tons. With the development of the <b>Bessemer</b> steel making <b>process</b> during the 1860s, a steel rope eventually replaced the chain and this was 2 inches (51 mm) in diameter and weighed 6 tons (tonnes).|$|R
50|$|When Bessemer {{tried to}} induce makers {{to take up}} his {{improved}} system, he met with general rebuffs and was eventually driven to undertake the exploitation of the process himself. He erected steelworks in Sheffield in a business partnership with others, such as W & J Galloway & Sons, and began to manufacture steel. At first the output was insignificant, but gradually {{the magnitude of the}} operations was enlarged until the competition became effective, and steel traders generally became aware that the firm of Henry Bessemer & Co. was underselling them to the extent of UK£10-£15 a ton. This argument to the pocket quickly had its effect, and licences were applied for in such numbers that, in royalties for the use of his <b>process,</b> <b>Bessemer</b> received a sum in all considerably exceeding a million pounds sterling.|$|R
25|$|In 1848 Brown {{developed}} and patented the conical spring buffer for railway carriages, {{which was very}} successful. With a growing reputation and fortune he moved to a larger site in 1856. He began {{to make his own}} iron from iron ore, rather than buying it, and in 1858 adopted the <b>Bessemer</b> <b>process</b> for producing steel. These moves all proved successful and lucrative, and in 1861 he started supplying steel rails to the rapidly expanding railway industry.|$|E
25|$|Carnegie {{made his}} fortune in the steel industry, {{controlling}} the most extensive integrated iron and steel operations ever owned by an individual in the United States. One of his two great innovations was in the cheap and efficient mass production of steel by adopting and adapting the <b>Bessemer</b> <b>process</b> for steel making. Sir Henry Bessemer had invented the furnace which allowed the high carbon content of pig iron to be burnt away in a controlled and rapid way. The steel price dropped as a direct result, and Bessemer steel was rapidly adopted for rails; however, it was not suitable for buildings and bridges.|$|E
25|$|Finally, {{the basic}} oxygen process was {{introduced}} at the Voest-Alpine works in 1952; a modification of the basic <b>Bessemer</b> <b>process,</b> it lances oxygen from above the steel (instead of bubbling air from below), {{reducing the amount of}} nitrogen uptake into the steel. The {{basic oxygen process}} is used in all modern steelworks; the last Bessemer converter in the U.S. was retired in 1968. Furthermore, the last three decades have seen a massive increase in the mini-mill business, where scrap steel only is melted with an electric arc furnace. These mills only produced bar products at first, but have since expanded into flat and heavy products, once the exclusive domain of the integrated steelworks.|$|E
5000|$|At {{this time}} there were upwards of five {{thousand}} men, women, and children employed at Cyfarthfa, all receiving good wages, and well looked after by their master. Crawshay was often spoken of as the [...] "Iron King of Wales". His name came prominently before the public {{in connection with the}} great strikes of 1873-5. He was averse to unions among masters or men, but assented, as a necessary sequence of the action of the men, to a combination among the masters. Unionism became active at Cyfarthfa at a time of falling prices; Crawshay called his men together and warned them of the consequences of persisting in their unreasonable demands; but as they would not yield the furnaces were one by one put out. Soon after came the revolution in the iron trade, the discarding of iron for steel through the invention of the <b>Bessemer</b> and Siemens <b>processes,</b> and the thorough extinction of the old-fashioned trade of the Crawshays and the Guests.|$|R
5000|$|Dowlais came to {{prominence}} in the 18th and 19th centuries because of its iron and steelworks. By the mid 1840s there were between 5000 and 7000 men, women and children employed in the Dowlais works. During the early to mid 1800s the ironworks were operated by Sir John Josiah Guest and (from 1833) his wife Lady Charlotte Guest. Charlotte Guest introduced welfare schemes for the ironworkers. She provided for a church and a library. The school (dating from 1819) was improved and extended, becoming [...] "probably {{the most important and}} most progressive not only in the industrial history of South Wales, but of the whole of Britain". In the 1850s, after Sir John's death, the works became under the control of a board of trustees. In 1865 the <b>Bessemer</b> steel making <b>process</b> was introduced to Dowlais, with £33,000 being spent on a new steelworks. Steel production at Dowlais eventually ceased in 1936 due to the Great Depression, although the iron foundry continued until 1987.|$|R
50|$|Spathic {{iron ores}} {{are rich in}} {{manganese}} and have negligible phosphorus. This led to their one major benefit, connected with the <b>Bessemer</b> steel-making <b>process.</b> Although the first demonstrations by Bessemer in 1856 had been successful, later attempts to reproduce this were infamously failures. Work by the metallurgist Robert Forester Mushet discovered {{that the reason for}} this was the nature of the Swedish ores that Bessemer had innocently used, being very low in phosphorus. Using a typical European high-phosphorus ore in Bessemer's converter gave a poor quality steel. To produce high quality steel from a high-phosphorus ore, Mushet realised that he could operate the Bessemer converter for longer, burning off all the steel's impurities including the unwanted phosphorus and the essential carbon, but then re-adding carbon, with manganese, {{in the form of a}} previously obscure ferromanganese ore with no phosphorus, spiegeleisen. This created a sudden demand for spiegeleisen. Although it was not available in sufficient quantity as a mineral, steelworks such as that at Ebbw Vale in South Wales soon learned to make it from the spathic siderite ores. For a few decades, spathic ores were now in demand and this encouraged their mining. In time though, the original 'acidic' liner, made from siliceous sandstone or ganister, of the Bessemer converter was replaced by a 'basic' liner in the developed Gilchrist Thomas process. This removed the phosphorus impurities as slag, produced by chemical reaction with the liner, and no longer required spiegeleisen. From the 1880s demand for the ores fell once again and many of their mines, including those of the Brendon Hills, closed soon after.|$|R
