5|$|On 27 May 1905, American author Molly Elliot Seawell sailed for Europe on Kroonland on a {{day when}} six liners, with over 1,500 passengers, {{departed}} New York. In October, Helen Taft returned from Europe on Kroonland and was met by her husband, Secretary of War William Howard Taft. The next August, Henry Yates Satterlee, the first Episcopal Bishop of Washington, returned on Kroonland from a six-week tour of cathedrals of Europe, during which he noted <b>both</b> <b>good</b> <b>and</b> bad design elements of cathedrals in preparation for the building of the Washington National Cathedral. Also returning on the same voyage were Admiral Charles Sperry and Lieutenant Daniel W. Wurtsbaugh of the U.S. Navy, and Brigadier General Robert O'Reilly, the Surgeon General of the U.S. Army; all were American delegates to the Second Geneva Convention. It was not the first trip on Kroonland for either Satterlee and O'Reilly. Satterlee had traveled on the liner the previous May to visit the spa town of Bad Nauheim in Hesse; O'Reilly had been on the November 1904 trip in which Kroonland had been reported as sunk.|$|E
5|$|Seemingly gone forever, another Scarlet member {{known as}} Xi-Tiger {{took control of}} the organization. Under his rule, Scarlet became too brutal even for themselves, and they called for Epsilon to reclaim his position. More or less {{isolated}} {{from the rest of the}} group, Xi sought to find and assassinate Epsilon himself. He planned an attack on an A-Human research laboratory, where children with special abilities had been kidnapped and experimented on. Upon arriving, Xi-Tiger sensed the presence of Epsilon in one of the boys. However, he was unsure because he couldn't pinpoint the evil from Epsilon, who had entered the boy's body and was now living as a parasite. Xi-Tiger took a young girl hostage and threatened to kill her unless Epsilon revealed himself. The boy flew into a rage and morphed his body into Epsilon himself. Xi seemed to sense this strange power, and in fear, killed the girl and fled. Epsilon had completely split his dual personality apart; with <b>both</b> <b>good</b> <b>and</b> evil Epsilons now chasing after Xi-Tiger.|$|E

25|$|Neapolitan Mastiffs, as a breed, are {{extremely}} intelligent dogs with {{a tendency to}} be independent thinkers. They learn quickly, which is <b>both</b> <b>good</b> <b>and</b> bad, since this guardian breed needs extensive proper socialization to learn to accept strangers, especially within the home; without proper early socialization and training, these dogs are likely to become aggressive towards strangers and unfamiliar dogs.|$|E
25|$|Khon is {{the most}} stylized form of Thai dance. It is {{performed}} by troupes of non-speaking dancers, the story being told by a chorus {{at the side of}} the stage. Choreography follows traditional models rather than attempting to innovate. Most khon performances feature episodes from the Ramakien. Costumes are dictated by tradition, with angels, <b>both</b> <b>good</b> <b>and</b> bad, wearing coloured masks.|$|E

25|$|The Karma {{theory of}} Buddhism is {{integrated}} into its Twelve Nidanas doctrine, {{and has been}} extensively commented on by ancient Buddhist scholars such as Nagarjuna. Karma consists of any intentional action, whether of body or speech or in mind, which can be either advantageous (merit) or disadvantageous (demerit). <b>Both</b> <b>good</b> <b>and</b> bad karma sustain the cycle of samsara (rebirth) and associated dukkha, and both prevent the attainment of nirvana.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the largest}} banks, brokerages, and {{insurance}} companies desired the Act at the time. The justification was that individuals usually put more money into investments {{when the economy is}} doing well, but they put most of their money into savings accounts when the economy turns bad. With the new Act, {{they would be able to}} do both 'savings' and 'investment' at the same financial institution, which would be able to do well in <b>both</b> <b>good</b> <b>and</b> bad economic times.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} {{of the federal government}} has shaped every facet of the city of Ottawa, and its architecture has been dramatically affected for <b>both</b> <b>good</b> <b>and</b> ill. Ottawa exists as a major city almost solely because it was selected to be the capital of the new nation of Canada, and the federal government remains the dominant employer in the city. Many of Ottawa's most acclaimed structures are the result of federal government projects, but the affinity for cheapness and blandness of recent government building has also {{played a central role in}} Ottawa's perceived architectural dullness.|$|E

25|$|The {{purpose of}} SafetyLit {{is to provide}} {{information}} to allow users to identify and find articles (<b>both</b> <b>good</b> <b>and</b> poor) that have been published about injury prevention and safety promotion topics... An important part of professionalism is to identify flawed publications and counter the flaws by commenting upon them {{in a letter to}} the editor of the journal where the article was published. Further, the best knowledge today may become outdated tomorrow. Although published corrections and errata are included , the older articles with inaccuracies are not removed from the site. These out-of-date items may be useful for authors or researchers who are examining the progression of scientific or social thought on a topic.|$|E
25|$|The temple {{is a part}} of {{the popular}} Navagraha pilgrimage in Tamil Nadu. The planets are {{believed}} to influence the horoscope computed based on time of one's birth and subsequently influence the course of life. Each of the planets are believed to move from a star to another during a predefined period and thus sway over an individual's fortunes. The Navagrahas, as per Hindu customs, are believed to provide <b>both</b> <b>good</b> <b>and</b> bad effects for any individual and the bad effects are mitigated by prayers. As in other Navagraha temples, the common worship practises of the devotees include offering of cloth, grains, flowers and jewels specific to the planet deity. Lighting a set of lamps is also commonly followed in the temple.|$|E
25|$|Star {{grew up in}} a rural {{working class}} area of Rhode Island. Starved for {{philosophy}} she befriended an ex-nun during high school and eventually obtained a scholarship to Radcliffe College where she began taking philosophy classes. Not fitting in and deterred from taking a Religion degree, Star dropped out, married and moved to Venezuela where she co-founded an organic commune. It was here that Star asked many of the questions that formed the basis of her research. Her work is guided by interests in both technology and feminism, and it was during this time that the women's movement and Kate Millett's Sexual Politics inspired her to ask questions about technology, and the effects that <b>both</b> <b>good</b> <b>and</b> bad technology have on oneself and on the world.|$|E

25|$|However, the Easterners, {{who were}} {{by far the}} {{majority}} in court, were not pleased that Yi I was apparently neutral in the conflict, when they believed that Sim Euigyeom had clearly wronged. However, Yi I believed that both Kim and Sim had done <b>both</b> <b>good</b> <b>and</b> bad things. Sim had prevented a fifth purge of the Sarim (by chasing Yi Lyang and his followers from court in 1563), while Kim had helped form a Sarim government by introducing many new scholars into the government. However, Sim had interfered in politics despite {{his status as a}} relative of the queen, while Kim had been close to Yun Wonhyeong despite his being a Seonbi. Yi I therefore believed that both sides were equal in their deeds and misdeeds.|$|E
25|$|Greg Hill still {{refused to}} race ABA races because he {{allegedly}} hated the ABA's direct transfer {{system in which}} the winner of the first moto would then sit out and not race the second and third cycle of motos until the Main, or if the race is big enough, the semis, quarter semis, etc. He and many other racers preferred the NBL's Olympic or cumulative {{system in which the}} qualifying rounds would be run three times and the average place in each round would be added and the four lowest numbers would advance to the main. This system put a premium on consistency while the Transfer System was a little closer to luck, <b>both</b> <b>good</b> <b>and</b> bad for a racer. The ABA used a similar system during its controversial 1982 and 1983 Grand Nationals to choose its number one title to minimize anyone lucking into or out of the title. Also, points are awarded in the motos in the Cumulative System as well as the main so the racer doesn't walk away with nothing if he doesn't advance. Hill's objections seem odd considering he would race in the future sanctioning body the United States Bicycle Association (USBA) which used the transfer system. The USBA did offer larger, more consistent pro purses than the ABA generally.|$|E
25|$|On 17 November Dagobert {{was arrested}} for disagreeing with the representatives. He was {{eventually}} acquitted {{and returned to his}} division where he died on 18 April 1794. Meanwhile, on 3 November the government replaced Turreau with François Amédée Doppet, another ex-doctor. Not wanting to wait for Turreau's successor, the representatives reappointed d'Aoust to command from 22 to 27 November. Doppet came to take command on 28 November but was practically ignored by the representatives on mission. On 7 December, d'Aoust with 10,000 men was defeated at Villelongue-dels-Monts by Ricardos with 8,000 Spanish and Portuguese troops. The Allies lost only 56 casualties while inflicting losses of 340 killed and wounded, 312 missing, 26 guns, two colors and 2,000 muskets on the French. Doppet decided to pull back to Perpignan for the winter under cover of a spoiling attack on Villelongue. D'Aoust led the attack on 18 December which overran the Portuguese camp and slaughtered its garrison. Doppet soon came down with illness and spent the next {{two and a half months}} in bed recovering. D'Aoust was finally in full command just in time to be blamed for a disaster. In the Battle of Collioure, a Spanish corps commanded by Lieutenant General Gregorio García de la Cuesta drove the French out of Collioure and Port-Vendres on 20 December, inflicting 4,000 casualties on the French. Fort Saint-Elme was betrayed to the Spanish by its traitorous commander. D'Aoust ordered a retreat on the 21st but the Spanish harassed it severely. Finally, the French fought their way back to the safety of Perpignan but their total losses in the debacle were 7,700 men and 23 guns. The government singled out the Army of the Eastern Pyrenees for disapproval despite the fact that its representatives were in large part responsible for the defeats. D'Aoust was arrested and the representatives on mission were recalled, except Fabre who was killed at Collioure. New representatives Édouard Jean Baptiste Milhaud and Pierre Soubrany celebrated their arrival by purging the army of <b>both</b> <b>good</b> <b>and</b> bad army officers. However, they subsequently did a better job of keeping the army supplied while letting the army officers do their work. D'Aoust fell victim to the guillotine on 2 July 1794.|$|E

Sestero has also noted that the film is semi-autobiographical in nature, and attempts to serve as [...] "an advisory warning about the perils of having friends".|$|E
500|$|When basing screenplays on written work, Clouzot often {{changed the}} stories dramatically, using only key {{points of the}} {{original}} story. The author Stanislas-André Steeman, whom Clouzot worked with twice, said Clouzot would only [...] "build something after having contemptuously demolished any resemblance to the original, purely for the ambition of effect". When writing for his own features, Clouzot created characters that were usually corrupt and spineless, with the capacity for <b>both</b> <b>good</b> <b>and</b> evil within them.|$|E
