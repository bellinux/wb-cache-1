5|$|A {{statement}} is considered falsifiable {{if there is}} an observation or a test that could <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>that</b> would demonstrate that the {{statement is}} false. Statements that are not falsifiable cannot be examined by scientific investigation since they permit no tests that evaluate their accuracy. Creationists such as Henry M. Morris have claimed that any observation can be fitted into the evolutionary framework, so it is impossible to demonstrate that evolution is wrong and therefore evolution is non-scientific.|$|E
5|$|According {{to general}} relativity, light does not travel along {{straight}} lines when it propagates in a gravitational field. Instead, it is deflected {{in the presence}} of massive bodies. In particular, starlight is deflected as it passes near the Sun, leading to apparent shifts of up 1.75 arc seconds in the stars' positions in the sky (an arc second is equal to 1/3600 of a degree). In the framework of Newtonian gravity, a heuristic argument can <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>that</b> leads to light deflection by half that amount. The different predictions can be tested by observing stars that are close to the Sun during a solar eclipse. In this way, a British expedition to West Africa in 1919, directed by Arthur Eddington, confirmed that Einstein's prediction was correct, and the Newtonian predictions wrong, via observation of the May 1919 eclipse. Eddington's results were not very accurate; subsequent observations of the deflection of the light of distant quasars by the Sun, which utilize highly accurate techniques of radio astronomy, have confirmed Eddington's results with significantly better precision (the first such measurements date from 1967, the most recent comprehensive analysis from 2004).|$|E
5|$|Expressions {{of sympathy}} and {{solidarity}} from the European film community manifested in renewed assurances of continued {{support from the}} production's German partners, ARTE, and the French National Film Centre (whose support was conditional on the film having 51% of its dialogue in French). New French financing was secured from production company Mezzanine Film, and in Hungary, the Hungarian Motion Picture Foundation (MMKA) and the Minister of Culture pledged to back the production if a guarantee could <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>that</b> the film would be finished safely. A compromise filming schedule was negotiated whereby {{a quarter of the}} shoot would take place in Eastern Europe rather than Corsica and fewer shooting days would be allotted. This allowed the original €5 million budget to be reduced by €700,000 to the amount available. With the funding promises secured and a revised shooting schedule, the film's producers forged a new co-production contract in July 2005.|$|E

5|$|I think {{a strong}} case can <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>that</b> {{political}} assassination actually does change things. If {{you look at the}} assassinations in this country in the 1960s you can certainly see how it affected history in a very profound way. So if you killed right wing figures, you'd also be altering the course of history, and eliminating people who might very well be president in 1996 and those who are making bashing gays their number one issue right now. On the one hand, I'm not advocating PWA's turn themselves into human bombs, {{but on the other hand}} I have to admit that if I clicked on CNN and heard somebody had blown Patrick Buchanan's head clean off, I'd be elated, and to say otherwise would be a lie.|$|E
5|$|The French {{invasion}} {{emerged in}} 1545, when Admiral Claude d'Annebault crossed the Channel and arrived off the Solent with 200 ships on 19 July, landing {{troops on the}} Isle of Wight. Henry's fleet made a brief sortie, resulting in the Battle of the Solent, in which the English flagship, the Mary Rose, was lost, before retreating safely behind the protective fortifications. Henry was present in Portsmouth {{at the time and}} the Cowdray engraving of the battle depicts him visiting Southsea Castle. The French expedition moved further on along the coast on 25 July, bringing an end to the immediate invasion threat, but Henry gave orders for additional improvements to the fortification to <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>that</b> summer, including the construction of stone flankers and timber caponiers, to guard against a potential infantry attack. Edward VI spent a night at the castle in 1552 while inspecting the defences of Portsmouth.|$|E

25|$|Although the Professional Lawn Tennis Association issued rankings {{at the end}} of 1952 {{in which}} they called Segura the world pro no. 1, with Gonzales second, the PLTA rankings were {{notoriously}} quirky. The year before, for instance, when Kramer had beaten Segura 64 matches to 28 (or 58-27 according to Kramer) in their championship tour, they had nevertheless ranked Segura as the world no. 1 player. A strong case can therefore <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>that</b> Gonzales was actually the world pro no. 1 player for 1952 or, at the very least, shared that position with Segura.|$|E

25|$|In many {{synthetic}} processes using {{transition metal}} catalysts, metal nanoparticles {{play an important}} role as the actual catalyst or as a catalyst reservoir. ILs are an appealing medium for the formation and stabilization of catalytically active transition metal nanoparticles. More importantly, ILs can <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>that</b> incorporate coordinating groups, for example, with nitrile groups on either the cation or anion (CN-IL). In various C-C coupling reactions catalyzed by a palladium catalyst, it has been found that palladium nanoparticles are better stabilized in CN-IL compared to non-functionalized ionic liquids; thus enhanced catalytic activity and recyclability are realized.|$|E
25|$|Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory's (LLNL) {{history with}} the ICF program starts with {{physicist}} John Nuckolls, who started considering the problem after a 1957 meeting on the peaceful {{use of nuclear weapons}} arranged by Edward Teller at LLNL. During these meetings, the idea later be known as PACER first developed. PACER envisioned the explosion of large hydrogen bombs in large underground caverns to generate steam that would be converted into electrical power. After identifying several problems with this approach, Nuckolls became interested in understanding how small a bomb could <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>that</b> would still generate net positive power.|$|E
25|$|Cryptography {{is central}} to digital rights {{management}} (DRM), a group of techniques for technologically controlling use of copyrighted material, being widely implemented and deployed {{at the behest of}} some copyright holders. In 1998, U.S. President Bill Clinton signed the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), which criminalized all production, dissemination, and use of certain cryptanalytic techniques and technology (now known or later discovered); specifically, those {{that could be used to}} circumvent DRM technological schemes. This had a noticeable impact on the cryptography research community since an argument can <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>that</b> any cryptanalytic research violated, or might violate, the DMCA. Similar statutes have since been enacted in several countries and regions, including the implementation in the EU Copyright Directive. Similar restrictions are called for by treaties signed by World Intellectual Property Organization member-states.|$|E
