40|$|This paper {{examines}} the impact {{and significance of}} independent budget analysis and advocacy initiatives {{that are designed to}} improve budget transparency and the poverty focus of government expenditure priorities. It draws on case study research of six <b>budget</b> <b>groups</b> in Brazil, Croatia, India, Mexico, South Africa, and Uganda, which include non-governmental organisations, research institutions and social movements. The findings demonstrate that civil society budget initiatives contribute to improvements in the transparency of budgetary decisions and the budget process, increased budget awareness and literacy, and deeper engagement in the budget process on the part of legislators, the media and civil society organisations. While the structure of the budget process makes substantial changes in expenditure priorities difficult to achieve, <b>budget</b> <b>groups</b> directly contribute to positive impacts on budget allocations and improved implementation, thereby increasing the accountability of decision-makers. Tracking of budgetary expenditures and impacts was also found to be effective in ensuring effective utilisation of education and health expenditures. Increased budget allocations and improved utilisation of public funds that benefit poor and disadvantaged groups can ensure greater equity in budget priorities and further social justice objectives. The activities of <b>budget</b> <b>groups</b> strengthen democracy by fostering accountability, enhancing transparency and deepening participation and voice.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{exploratory}} study in school finance {{was to examine the}} relationship between transferred capital funds and budgeting practices for select public school districts in Arizona. Three major research questions were derived to examine public school fiscal management relative to budgeting efficiency, lapsing and depletion funds. The three research questions are as follows: (1) What variables can identify and are likely to maximally contribute to school districts' budget expenditures falling within a plus/minus 2 % range of the adopted budget? (2) What factors would be maximally associated with school districts having either a credit or deficit ending fund balance in the general operations budget? (3) What variables are likely to maximally contribute to school districts budgeting practices leading to increased or decreased capital levy fund balance? A systematic stratified sample of 31 school districts constituted the study group. Discriminant Function Analysis was used in the statistical treatment of 11 discriminant variables for six budget classifications. Each hypothesis was rejected at the. 01 level of significance. Capital Transfer Funds indicated maximum contribution in differentiating school <b>budget</b> <b>groups</b> which were within the plus/minus 2 % range of the adopted budget. For the second research question and hypothesis, Revenue, in linear-combination with Beginning Fund Balance and expenditure, evidenced maximum ability to differentiate the credit fund balance. Capital Transfer Funds added minimal ability to discriminate <b>budget</b> <b>groups.</b> For the third hypothesis, Revenues, Expenditures, and Capital Transfer Monies indicated high ability to discriminate <b>budget</b> <b>groups.</b> Capital Transfer Monies, however, was statistically spurious...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to analyze the {{condition}} of rice supply chain at Bulog; to identify, to evaluate and to analyze factors influencing Bulog’s performance on rice supply chain; and to formulate strategic alternative for Bulog to improve its performance on managing rice supply chain. The primary data were collected from five expert respondents at Regional Division of Bulog for West Java Area and one expert respondent at Bulog Office Centre, Jakarta. The secondary data were collected from Bulog, Central Bureau of Statistics, and FAO. Cause Effect Diagram, Time Series Analysis, and Transportation Model were used to identify, to evaluate and to analyze the data. The farmers, rural cooperatives, and private milling units were involved in the paddy/rice procurement of Bulog. The rice was distributed to <b>budgeting</b> <b>group</b> and non <b>budgeting</b> <b>group.</b> The factors influencing Bulog’s performance were value advantages (paddy quality, rice quality, quality maintenance, and technology of post harvest handling and rice processing); and productivity advantages (on-farm production, rice stock, transportation, paddy/rice defect, procurement cost and partnership). It was predicted that the rice production volume in West Java and Banten Provinces tend to decrease, each for 3 806. 33 Tons per quartile and 1 662. 85 Tons per quartile. The optimal rice transportation network should be conducted through rice distribution from Cirebon Sub Regional Division to Ciamis Sub Regional Division or from Karawang Sub Regional Division to Cianjur Sub Regional Division. Rice distribution could be conducted from Cirebon, Indramayu, Karawang and Subang Sub Regional Divisions to Jakarta Raya Sub Regional Division. Bulog was suggested to maximize its core competence on logistic area, which should be strengthened through technology modernization, rice based product diversification planning, human resources quality improvement, and networking development with related industries...|$|R
