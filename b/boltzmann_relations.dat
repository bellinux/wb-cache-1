40|$|Rapid transmembrane flow {{of sodium}} ions {{produces}} the depolarizing phase of action potentials (APs) in most excitable tissue through voltage-gated sodium channels (NaV). Macroscopic currents display rapid activation followed by fast inactivation (IF) within milliseconds. Slow inactivation (IS) has been subsequently observed in several preparations including neuronal tissues. IS serves important physiological functions, but the kinetic properties are incompletely characterized, especially the operative timescales. Here we present evidence for an "intermediate inactivation" (II) process in rat hippocampal CA 1 neurons with time constants {{of the order}} of 100 ms. The half-inactivation potentials (V 05) of steady-state inactivation curves were hyperpolarized by increasing conditioning pulse duration from 50 to 500 ms and could be described by a sum of <b>Boltzmann</b> <b>relations.</b> II state transitions were observed after opening as well as subthreshold potentials. Entry into II after opening was relatively insensitive to membrane potential, and recovery of II became more rapid at hyperpolarized potentials. Removal of fast inactivation with cytoplasmic papaine revealed time constants of INa decay corresponding to II and IS with long depolarizations. Dynamic clamp revealed attenuation of trains of APs over the 102 -ms timescale, suggesting a functional role of I: in repetitive firing accommodation. These experimental findings could be reproduced with a five-state Markov model. It is likely that II affects important aspects of hippocampal neuron response and may provide a drug target for sodium channel modulation...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} bring {{together}} into a common format work on electronegative plasmas, carried out over several years by different authors, as well as indicating how the differences have arisen. In the case of oxygen at higher pressures the dominant loss mechanism is detachment rather than recombination and the difference arose because the importance of associative detachment had not been recognized in some work. More generally, the concept of ambipolar diffusion does not carry over to electronegative plasmas. In particular the expressions given by Thompson (Thompson J B 1950 Proc. Phys. Soc. 73 818 - 21), quoted by Massey (Massey H S W 1974 Negative Ions (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press)) and again by Lieberman and Lichtenberg (Lieberman M A and Lichtenberg A J 1994 Principles of Plasma Discharges and Materials Processing (New York: Wiley-Interscience)), are wrong because {{they are based on}} the mathematical inconsistency of taking the negative ion and electron densities to be proportional, while simultaneously obeying <b>Boltzmann</b> <b>relations</b> with different temperatures. In general, electronegative plasmas are structured and there is agreement on this point; furthermore, the ratio of attachment rate to ionization rate is an important parameter in determining the structure. It is shown that a relationship exists between the central negative ion/electron density ratio and the generation and loss processes, namely ionization, attachment, detachment and recombination, over a wide range of pressures. The means of determining the plasma balance equation and so relating the ionization rate to the plasma dimension, the pressure and other discharge parameters are indicated. ...|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} the conformations of the Na+/glucose cotransporter (SGLT 1) during sugar transport using charge and fluorescence measurements {{on the human}} SGLT 1 mutant G 507 C expressed in Xenopus oocytes. The mutant exhibited similar steady-state and presteady-state kinetics as wild-type SGLT 1, and labeling of Cys 507 by tetramethylrhodamine- 6 -maleimide {{had no effect on}} kinetics. Our strategy was to record changes in charge and fluorescence in response to rapid jumps in membrane potential in the presence and absence of sugar or the competitive inhibitor phlorizin. In Na+ buffer, step jumps in membrane voltage elicited presteady-state currents (charge movements) that decay to the steady state with time constants τmed (3 – 20 ms, medium) and τslow (15 – 70 ms, slow). Concurrently, SGLT 1 rhodamine fluorescence intensity increased with depolarizing and decreased with hyperpolarizing voltages (ΔF). The charge vs. voltage (Q-V) and fluorescence vs. voltage (ΔF-V) relations (for medium and slow components) obeyed <b>Boltzmann</b> <b>relations</b> with similar parameters: zδ (apparent valence of voltage sensor) ≈ 1; and V 0. 5 (midpoint voltage) between − 15 and − 40 mV. Sugar induced an inward current (Na+/glucose cotransport), and reduced maximal charge (Qmax) and fluorescence (ΔFmax) with half-maximal concentrations (K 0. 5) of 1 mM. Increasing [αMDG]o also shifted the V 0. 5 for Q and ΔF to more positive values, with K 0. 5 's ≈ 1 mM. The major difference between Q and ΔF was that at saturating [αMDG]o, the presteady-state current (and Qmax) was totally abolished, whereas ΔFmax was only reduced 50 %. Phlorizin reduced both Qmax and ΔFmax (Ki ≈ 0. 4 μM), with no changes in V 0. 5 's or relaxation time constants. Simulations using an eight-state kinetic model indicate that external sugar increases the occupancy probability of inward-facing conformations at the expense of outward-facing conformations. The simulations predict, and we have observed experimentally, that presteady-state currents are blocked by saturating sugar, but not the changes in fluorescence. Thus we have isolated an electroneutral conformational change that has not been previously described. This rate-limiting step at maximal inward Na+/sugar cotransport (saturating voltage and external Na+ and sugar concentrations) is the slow release of Na+ from the internal surface of SGLT 1. The high affinity blocker phlorizin locks the cotransporter in an inactive conformation...|$|E
40|$|The strong inward {{rectifier}} K+ current, IK 1, shows significant outward current amplitude in {{the voltage}} range near the reversal potential and thereby causes rapid repolarization {{at the final}} phase of cardiac action potentials. However, the mechanism that generates the outward IK 1 is not well understood. We recorded currents from the inside-out patches of HEK 293 T cells that express the strong inward rectifier K+ channel Kir 2. 1 and studied the blockage of the currents caused by cytoplasmic polyamines, namely, spermine and spermidine. The outward current–voltage (I–V) relationships of Kir 2. 1, obtained with 5 – 10 μm spermine or 10 – 100 μm spermidine, were similar to the steady-state outward I–V relationship of IK 1, showing a peak at a level that is ∼ 20 mV more positive than the reversal potential, with a negative slope at more positive voltages. The relationships exhibited a plateau or a double-hump shape with 1 μm spermine/spermidine or 0. 1 μm spermine, respectively. In the chord conductance–voltage relationships, there were extra conductances in the positive voltage range, which could not be described by the <b>Boltzmann</b> <b>relations</b> fitting the major part of the relationships. The extra conductances, which generated most of the outward currents in the presence of 5 – 10 μm spermine or 10 – 100 μm spermidine, were quantitatively explained by a model that considered two populations of Kir 2. 1 channels, which were blocked by polyamines in either a high-affinity mode (Mode 1 channel) or a low-affinity mode (Mode 2 channel). Analysis of the inward tail currents following test pulses indicated that the relief from the spermine block of Kir 2. 1 consisted of an exponential component and a virtually instantaneous component. The fractions of the two components nearly agreed with the fractions of the blockages in Mode 1 and Mode 2 calculated by the model. The estimated proportion of Mode 1 channels to total channels was 0. 9 with 0. 1 – 10 μm spermine, 0. 75 with 1 – 100 μm spermidine, and between 0. 75 and 0. 9 when spermine and spermidine coexisted. An interaction of spermine/spermidine with the channel at an intracellular site appeared to modify the equilibrium of the two conformational channel states that allow different modes of blockage. Our results suggest that the outward IK 1 is primarily generated by channels with lower affinities for polyamines. Polyamines may regulate the amplitude of the outward IK 1, not only by blocking the channels but also by modifying the proportion of channels that show different sensitivities to the polyamine block...|$|E

Comparing the three parameters, good match in wave form is found for density and velocity in scales between kilometers and hundred meters (few kilometers ~ 300 m).
