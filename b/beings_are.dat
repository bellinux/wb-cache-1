5|$|All human <b>beings</b> <b>are</b> {{created in}} the image of God, but because of sin, this image is marred. It is the will of God that all people should receive {{salvation}} through faith in Jesus Christ.|$|E
5|$|Human <b>beings</b> <b>are</b> {{seen as a}} {{microcosm}} of the universe, and for example comprise the Wu Xing in form of the zang-fu organs. As a consequence, it is believed that deeper understanding of the universe can be achieved by understanding oneself.|$|E
50|$|Proof (b): 1. If a {{necessary}} <b>being</b> <b>is</b> {{cause of the}} world then it exists outside the world.2. If {{a necessary}} <b>being</b> <b>is</b> a cause of the world, then it is in time and so not outside the world.3. A necessary <b>being</b> <b>is</b> not cause of the world.|$|R
50|$|Applied to being, {{the system}} fails {{to arrive at}} a {{definition}} {{for the simple reason that}} no difference can be found. The species, the genus, and the difference are all equally being: a <b>being</b> <b>is</b> a <b>being</b> that <b>is</b> <b>being.</b> The genus cannot be nothing because nothing is not a class of everything. The trivial solution that <b>being</b> <b>is</b> <b>being</b> added to nothing is only a tautology: <b>being</b> <b>is</b> <b>being.</b> There <b>is</b> no simpler intermediary between being and non-being that explains and classifies being.|$|R
40|$|The {{only valid}} {{consideration}} of human <b>being</b> <b>is</b> what takes {{the person in}} his complexity. Human <b>being</b> <b>is</b> an open system in his relation with the medium. But, attending his racionality (deepest and most radical dimension), human <b>being</b> <b>is</b> free system. So, {{he is able to}} assert oneself ends according values...|$|R
5|$|In Scandinavian folklore, {{a diverse}} array of human-like supernatural <b>beings</b> <b>are</b> attested which might {{be thought of as}} elves and which might partly {{originate}} in medieval Scandinavian beliefs. However, the characteristics and names of these beings has varied widely across time and space, and they cannot be neatly categorised. These <b>beings</b> <b>are</b> sometimes known by words descended directly from Old Norse álfr. However, in the modern languages, these traditional terms have tended to be replaced with other terms. Things are further {{complicated by the fact that}} when referring to the elves of Old Norse mythology, scholars have adopted new forms based directly on the Old Norse word álfr. The following table summarises the situation in the main modern standard languages of Scandinavia.|$|E
5|$|A {{recurrent}} {{and important}} element of Taoism are rituals, exercises and substances aiming at aligning oneself spiritually with cosmic forces, at undertaking ecstatic spiritual journeys, or at improving physical health and thereby extending one's life, ideally {{to the point of}} immortality. Enlightened and immortal <b>beings</b> <b>are</b> referred to as xian.|$|E
5|$|Delatombe {{forces them}} to solve a mystery: The girls of the small village of Marbaden are disappearing, and the villagers are {{convinced}} that supernatural <b>beings</b> <b>are</b> responsible. The Grimms are charged with finding who is responsible, and they soon discover {{that it is the}} work of a real supernatural force: a beautiful, yet evil, 500-year-old Thuringian Queen (Monica Bellucci) stealing young girls to restore her own beauty.|$|E

50|$|According to Avicenna, {{and in an}} {{interpretation}} of Greek Aristotelian and Platonist ontological doctrines in medieval metaphysics, <b>being</b> <b>is</b> either necessary, contingent qua possible, or impossible. Necessary <b>being</b> <b>is</b> that which cannot but be, since its non-being entails a contradiction. Contingent qua possible <b>being</b> <b>is</b> neither necessary nor impossible {{for it to be}} or not to be. It is ontologically neutral, and is brought from potential existing into actual existence by way of a cause that is external to its essence. Its <b>being</b> <b>is</b> borrowed unlike the necessary existent, which is self-subsisting and is impossible for it not to be. As for the impossible, it necessarily does not exist, and the affirmation of its <b>being</b> <b>is</b> a contradiction.|$|R

5|$|The three <b>beings</b> <b>are</b> {{discovered}} to be reptilian humanoids, {{and in a}} scuffle, they capture Elliot and strike Tony with a venomous forked tongue; the Doctor and Rory subdue one while the other two retreat with Elliot back into the earth. The Doctor realises the <b>beings</b> <b>are</b> {{a new form of}} Silurians, and that they have relented in their attack since both sides hold a hostage. The captured Silurian calls herself Alaya; {{she is a member of}} the warrior caste, awoken by the drill. Alaya believes, as do all Silurians, that the Earth still belongs to them, that the drilling was a form of attack by the humans, and that they will defeat humanity eventually. Tony, suffering from the effects of the venom, says they should dissect Alaya, but the Doctor warns that it would be seen as an act of war. The Doctor decides to travel in the TARDIS down the drilling shaft to talk to the rest of the Silurians and work out a truce; Nasreen accompanies him.|$|E
5|$|From 2001, Varner {{embarked}} on a research project exploring animals in Hare's two-level utilitarianism. Personhood, Ethics, and Animal Cognition, published by Oxford University Press in 2012, was the first monograph arising from this project. In the book, Varner moved away from his biocentrism, instead endorsing a developed version of Hare's ethics. Varner draws a distinction between persons, near-persons and merely sentient beings; although all are morally considerable, the lives of persons are of the most significance, {{and the lives of}} merely sentient <b>beings</b> <b>are</b> of the least. The practical consequences of this view, though initial comments were offered in Personhood, Ethics, and Animal Cognition, will be explored in Sustaining Animals, forthcoming with Oxford University Press.|$|E
5|$|In {{the game}} the player must {{simultaneously}} drive a bus and clear roads of alien potato beings. The <b>beings</b> <b>are</b> scattered across the street, and by shooting out rows of alien potatoes, they can be cleared from the player's path. The player must clear a set number of aliens to proceed in the game. Hot Potato received mostly above average reviews from critics; it received 66.42% and 74% ratings on review aggregate websites GameRankings and Metacritic respectively.|$|E
5000|$|Killing {{a living}} <b>being</b> <b>is</b> killing one's own self; showing {{compassion}} to a living <b>being</b> <b>is</b> showing compassion to oneself. He who desires his own good, should avoid causing any harm to a living being. Suman Suttam ...|$|R

25|$|For example, the {{biological}} half-life {{of water in}} a human <b>being</b> <b>is</b> about 9 to 10 days, though this can be altered by behavior and various other conditions. The biological half-life of cesium in human <b>beings</b> <b>is</b> between one and four months.|$|R
5|$|Scholars {{have found}} it {{extremely}} difficult to assign one specific, overarching theme to the play. Proposals for a main theme include a discovery by the characters that human <b>beings</b> <b>are</b> neither wholly good nor wholly evil, but instead {{are more or less}} alike, awaking out of a dream and into reality, the danger of hasty action, or the power of tragic fate. None of these have widespread support. However, even if an overall theme cannot be found {{it is clear that the}} play is full of several small, thematic elements that intertwine in complex ways. Several of those most often debated by scholars are discussed below.|$|E
5|$|Some {{philosophers}} take an epistemic {{approach and}} argue that the mind–body problem is currently unsolvable, and perhaps will always remain unsolvable to human beings. This is usually termed New mysterianism. Colin McGinn holds that human <b>beings</b> <b>are</b> cognitively closed in regards to their own minds. According to McGinn human minds lack the concept-forming procedures to fully grasp how mental properties such as consciousness arise from their causal basis. An example would be how an elephant is cognitively closed in regards to particle physics.|$|E
5|$|Theoretically, {{all life}} forms {{are said to}} deserve full {{protection}} {{from all kinds of}} injury, but Jains recognise a hierarchy of life. Mobile <b>beings</b> <b>are</b> given higher protection than immobile ones. For the mobile beings, they distinguish between one-sensed, two-sensed, three-sensed, four-sensed and five-sensed ones; a one-sensed animal has touch as its only sensory modality. The more senses a being has, the more they care about non-injuring it. Among the five-sensed beings, the precept of non-injury and non-violence to the rational ones (humans) is strongest in Jain Ahimsa.|$|E

50|$|This <b>being</b> <b>is</b> {{outside of}} The Presence's creation. This is no fallen Angel or Leviathan, {{this is the}} soul of {{darkness}} itself. A complete absence of divine light. This <b>being</b> <b>is</b> in every way equal {{to the power of}} the Presence, but his opposite who existed before Creation.|$|R
40|$|During the Middle Ages, {{scholastic}} thinkers {{debated the}} question of whether <b>being</b> <b>is</b> univocal, anaological, or equivocal. Drawing from the tension between Thomistic analogia entis and Scotistic univocity, I argue that Heidegger’s early ontology crosses the boundaries that demarcate this triple distinction between univocal, analogical, and equivocal being. In Heidegger’s ontology, <b>being</b> <b>is</b> univocal insofar as it is considered in itself and analogical insofar as Dasein, non-Dasein entities, and <b>being</b> <b>are</b> concerned, while the relationship between god and <b>being</b> <b>is</b> equivocal. These relationships are, in turn, hierarchically related such that equivocity grounds univocity which is, in turn, more fundamental than analogy. Now, because the equivocal relationship between God and <b>being</b> <b>is</b> more fundamental than the univocity of being, Heidegger’s fundamental ontology is governed by a more primordial commitment to keep God at a distance. Hence, the hierarchy that obtains between the three medieval categories brings into suspicion Heidegger’s allegedly basic ontology. Far from being a neutral articulation of the way being reveals itself, Heidegger’s ontology is, more fundamentally, theologically grounded...|$|R
5|$|While some mythological <b>beings</b> <b>are</b> {{common to}} all Slavic ethnic groups, ale seem to be {{exclusive}} to Bulgarian, Macedonian and Serb folklore. Even so, other Slavic groups also had demons of bad weather. Among East Slavs, this witch was called Baba Yaga, and was imagined as a woman of gigantic stature with a big nose, iron teeth, and protruding chin; {{it was believed that}} she ate children, and her presence brought thunderstorms and cold weather. The term baba is present in customs, beliefs, and toponyms of all Slavic groups, usually as a personification of wind, darkness, and rain. This leads some scholars to believe there was a proto-Slavic divinity or demon called Baba, associated with bad weather.|$|E
5|$|The god of Death, Yama, employs Yama-dutas (messengers of Yama) or Yama-purushas, {{who bring}} souls of all beings to Yama for judgement. Generally, all living beings, {{including}} humans and animals, go to Yama's abode upon death {{where they are}} judged. However, very virtuous <b>beings</b> <b>are</b> taken directly to Svarga (heaven). People devoted to charity, especially donors of food, and eternal truth speakers are spared the justice of Yama's court. War-heroes who sacrifice their life and people dying in holy places like Kurukshetra are also described as avoiding Yama. Those who get moksha (salvation) also escape from the clutches of yamadutas. Those who are generous and ascetics are given preferential treatment when entering Naraka for judgement. The way is lighted for those who donated lamps, while those who underwent religious fasting are carried by peacocks and geese.|$|E
5|$|Gwyneth {{stands in}} the middle of an arch and opens the rift, {{allowing}} the Gelth to cross over. The number of Gelth is much greater than anticipated, and their true motive is revealed: they intend to kill the living to give themselves more hosts and take over the planet. One of the animated bodies strangles Sneed to death, allowing another Gelth to possess his body. Dickens flees the parlour, and Rose and the Doctor are trapped in a part of the basement. Outside, Dickens realises that the <b>beings</b> <b>are</b> affected by gas and returns to the house. He extinguishes the gaslights and turns the gas on full, pulling the Gelth out of the bodies. The Doctor tells Gwyneth to send the Gelth back and close the rift, but she cannot close it or leave. Instead she takes out a box of matches, intending to ignite the gas and kill the Gelth along with herself. The Doctor determines that Gwyneth is already dead, and that by opening the rift, she had doomed herself. The Doctor, Rose, and Dickens flee the parlour just before it explodes and burns, killing Gwyneth and the Gelth.|$|E

5000|$|... causal {{necessity}} (subsumed by Hicks {{under the}} former type): a causally necessary <b>being</b> <b>is</b> {{such that it}} is logically impossible {{for it to be}} causally dependent on any other <b>being,</b> and it <b>is</b> logically impossible for any other <b>being</b> to <b>be</b> causally independent of it.|$|R
5|$|The {{ecological}} complexities human <b>beings</b> <b>are</b> facing {{through the}} technological {{transformation of the}} planetary biome has brought on the Anthropocene. The unique set of circumstances has generated {{the need for a}} new unifying science called coupled human and natural systems that builds upon, but moves beyond the field of human ecology. Ecosystems tie into human societies through the critical and all encompassing life-supporting functions they sustain. In recognition of these functions and the incapability of traditional economic valuation methods to see the value in ecosystems, there has been a surge of interest in social-natural capital, which provides the means to put a value on the stock and use of information and materials stemming from ecosystem goods and services. Ecosystems produce, regulate, maintain, and supply services of critical necessity and beneficial to human health (cognitive and physiological), economies, and they even provide an information or reference function as a living library giving opportunities for science and cognitive development in children engaged in the complexity of the natural world. Ecosystems relate importantly to human ecology as they are the ultimate base foundation of global economics as every commodity, and the capacity for exchange ultimately stems from the ecosystems on Earth.|$|E
25|$|In the {{earliest}} Vedic literature, all supernatural <b>beings</b> <b>are</b> called Asuras. By the late Vedic period (~500 BCE), benevolent supernatural <b>beings</b> <b>are</b> {{referred to as}} Deva-Asuras. In post-Vedic texts, such as the Puranas and the Itihasas of Hinduism, the Devas represent the good, and the Asuras the bad. In some medieval Indian literature, Devas are {{also referred to as}} Suras and contrasted with their equally powerful, but malevolent half-brothers referred to as the Asuras.|$|E

50|$|In ontology, the {{different}} kinds or ways of <b>being</b> <b>are</b> called categories of being or simply categories. To investigate the categories of <b>being</b> <b>is</b> to determine the most fundamental and the broadest classes of entities. A distinction between such categories, in making the categories or applying them, is called an ontological distinction.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: An omnipotent <b>being</b> would <b>be</b> a <b>being</b> whose power <b>was</b> unlimited. The {{power of}} human <b>beings</b> <b>is</b> limited in two {{distinct}} ways: we are limited {{with respect to}} our freedom of will, and we are limited {{in our ability to}} execute what we have willed. These two distinct sources of limitation suggest a simple definition of omnipotence: an omnipotent <b>being</b> <b>is</b> one that has both perfect freedom of will and perfect efficacy of will. In this article we further explicate this definition and show that it escapes the standard objections to divine omnipotence...|$|R
