5|$|A {{number of}} other causes may produce similar {{symptoms}} including appendicitis, ectopic pregnancy, hemorrhagic or ruptured ovarian cysts, ovarian torsion, and endometriosis and gastroenteritis, peritonitis, and <b>bacterial</b> <b>vaginosis</b> among others.|$|E
5|$|Clindamycin {{has been}} proven to {{decrease}} the risk of premature births in women diagnosed with <b>bacterial</b> <b>vaginosis</b> during early pregnancy to {{about a third of}} the risk of untreated women.|$|E
5|$|Risk of {{transmission}} {{increases in the}} presence of many sexually transmitted infections and genital ulcers. Genital ulcers appear to increase the risk approximately fivefold. Other sexually transmitted infections, such as gonorrhea, chlamydia, trichomoniasis, and <b>bacterial</b> <b>vaginosis,</b> are associated with somewhat smaller increases in risk {{of transmission}}.|$|E
5|$|The {{anatomical}} {{structure of the}} internal organs and tissues of the female reproductive tract provides a pathway for pathogens to ascend from the vagina to the pelvic cavity thorough the infundibulum. The disturbance of the naturally occurring vaginal microbiota associated with <b>bacterial</b> <b>vaginosis</b> {{increases the risk of}} PID.|$|E
5|$|Clindamycin {{preparations}} for oral administration include capsules (containing clindamycin hydrochloride) and oral suspensions (containing clindamycin palmitate hydrochloride). Oral suspension is not favored for administration of clindamycin to children, {{due to its}} extremely foul taste and odor. Clindamycin is formulated in a vaginal cream and as vaginal ovules for treatment of <b>bacterial</b> <b>vaginosis.</b> It is also available for topical administration in gel form, as a lotion, and in a foam delivery system (each containing clindamycin phosphate) and a solution in ethanol (containing clindamycin hydrochloride) and is used primarily as a prescription acne treatment.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bacterial</b> <b>vaginosis</b> (BV) occurs {{more often}} in lesbians, but it is unclear if BV is {{transmitted}} by sexual contact; it occurs in celibate as well as sexually active women. BV often occurs in both partners in a lesbian relationship; {{a recent study of}} women with BV found that 81% had partners with BV. Lesbians are not included in a category of frequency of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission, although transmission is possible through vaginal and cervical secretions. The highest rate of transmission of HIV to lesbians is among women who participate in intravenous drug use or have sexual intercourse with bisexual men.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bacterial</b> <b>vaginosis</b> is not {{considered}} a sexually transmitted infection, and treatment of a male sexual partner {{of a woman with}} <b>bacterial</b> <b>vaginosis</b> is not recommended.|$|E
25|$|Infections can {{increase}} the risk of a miscarriage: rubella(German measles), cytomegalovirus, <b>bacterial</b> <b>vaginosis,</b> HIV, chlamydia, gonorrhoea,syphilis,and malaria.|$|E
25|$|Studies have {{suggested}} a possible clinical {{role for the}} use of standardized oral or vaginal probiotics in the treatment of <b>bacterial</b> <b>vaginosis,</b> either in addition to or in place of the typical antibiotic regimens. However, recent articles question their efficacy in preventing recurrence compared with other means, or conclude that there is insufficient evidence for or against recommending probiotics for the treatment of <b>bacterial</b> <b>vaginosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Bacteria {{typically}} {{associated with}} dental caries have been isolated from vaginal samples from females who have <b>bacterial</b> <b>vaginosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Drugs {{of choice}} for the {{treatment}} of <b>bacterial</b> <b>vaginosis</b> include metronidazole and clindamycin. The treatment {{of choice for}} <b>bacterial</b> <b>vaginosis</b> in nonpregnant women include metronidazole oral twice daily for seven days, or metronidazole gel intravaginally once daily for five days, or clindamycin intravaginally at bedtime for seven days. For pregnant women, the treatment of choice is metronidazole oral three times a day for seven days. Data does not report routine treatment of male sexual partners.|$|E
25|$|In addition, <b>bacterial</b> <b>vaginosis</b> an intercurrent {{disease in}} {{pregnancy}} {{may increase the}} risk of pregnancy complications, most notably premature birth or miscarriage.|$|E
25|$|Although {{previously}} {{considered a}} mere nuisance infection, untreated <b>bacterial</b> <b>vaginosis</b> may cause complications, such as increased susceptibility to sexually transmitted infections including HIV and pregnancy complications.|$|E
25|$|Prevention of <b>bacterial</b> <b>vaginosis</b> {{includes}} healthy {{diets and}} behaviors {{as well as}} minimizing stress as all these factors can affect the pH balance of the vagina.|$|E
25|$|The healthy vagina of a {{woman of}} child-bearing age is acidic, with a pH {{normally}} ranging between 3.8 and 4.5.; {{this is due to}} the degradation of glycogen to the lactic acid by enzymes secreted by the Döderlein's bacillus, which is a normal commensal of the vagina. The acidity delays or slows the growth of many strains of pathogenic microbes. An increased pH of the vagina (with a commonly used cut-off of pH 4.5 or higher) can be caused by bacterial overgrowth, as occurs in <b>bacterial</b> <b>vaginosis</b> and trichomoniasis, or rupture of membranes in pregnancy. There are different types of <b>bacterial</b> <b>vaginosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Gardnerella vaginalis is {{the main}} culprit in BV. Gardnerella vaginalis is a short rod (coccobacillus). Hence, the {{presence}} of clue cells and gram variable coccobacilli are indicative or diagnostic of <b>bacterial</b> <b>vaginosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} shown that HIV-infected women with <b>bacterial</b> <b>vaginosis</b> (BV) are more likely to {{transmit}} HIV to their sexual partners than those without BV. Diagnostic criteria for BV have also been associated with a female genital tract factor that induces expression of HIV.|$|E
25|$|Loss of acidity. To control {{bacterial}} growth, {{the vagina}} is normally slightly acidic with a pH of 3.8–4.2. A swab of the discharge is put onto litmus paper to check its acidity. A pH greater than 4.5 is considered alkaline and is suggestive of <b>bacterial</b> <b>vaginosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Metronidazole {{has also}} been used in women to prevent preterm birth {{associated}} with <b>bacterial</b> <b>vaginosis,</b> amongst other risk factors including the presence of cervicovaginal fetal fibronectin (fFN). Metronidazole was ineffective in preventing preterm delivery in high-risk pregnant women (selected by history and a positive fFN test) and, conversely, the incidence of preterm delivery {{was found to be}} higher in women treated with metronidazole.|$|E
25|$|It {{is usually}} due to infection. The three main kinds of {{vaginitis}} are <b>bacterial</b> <b>vaginosis</b> (BV), vaginal candidiasis, and trichomoniasis. A woman {{may have a}} combination of vaginal infections at one time. Testing for vaginal infections is {{not a part of}} routine pelvic exams. If there is discomfort in the vulvovaginal area, women can request their health care providers evaluate for the presence of an infection.|$|E
25|$|Metronidazole (MNZ), marketed {{under the}} brand name Flagyl among others, is an {{antibiotic}} and antiprotozoal medication. It is used either alone or with other antibiotics to treat pelvic inflammatory disease, endocarditis, and <b>bacterial</b> <b>vaginosis.</b> It is effective for dracunculiasis, giardiasis, trichomoniasis, and amebiasis. It is the drug of choice for a first episode of mild-to-moderate Clostridium difficile colitis. Metronidazole is available by mouth, as a cream, and intravenously.|$|E
25|$|Early {{evidence}} {{suggested that}} antibiotic treatment of male partners could re-establish the normal microbiota {{of the male}} urogenital tract and prevent the recurrence of infection. However, a 2016 Cochrane review found high-quality evidence that treating the sexual partners of women with <b>bacterial</b> <b>vaginosis</b> {{had no effect on}} symptoms, clinical outcomes, or recurrence in the affected women. It also found that such treatment may lead treated sexual partners to report increased adverse events.|$|E
25|$|Metronidazole is {{primarily}} used to treat: <b>bacterial</b> <b>vaginosis,</b> {{pelvic inflammatory disease}} (along with other antibacterials like ceftriaxone), pseudomembranous colitis, aspiration pneumonia, rosacea (topical), fungating wounds (topical), intra-abdominal infections, lung abscess, periodontitis, amoebiasis, oral infections, giardiasis, trichomoniasis, and infections caused by susceptible anaerobic organisms such as Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, Clostridium, Peptostreptococcus, and Prevotella species. It is also often used to eradicate Helicobacter pylori along with other drugs and to prevent infection in people recovering from surgery.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bacterial</b> <b>vaginosis</b> (BV) is {{a disease}} of the vagina caused by {{excessive}} growth of bacteria. Common symptoms include increased vaginal discharge that often smells like fish. The discharge is usually white or gray in color. Burning with urination may occur. Itching is uncommon. Occasionally, {{there may be no}} symptoms. Having BV approximately doubles the risk of infection by a number of other sexually transmitted infections, including HIV/AIDS. It also increases the risk of early delivery among pregnant women.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, the {{cultural}} practice of female genital mutilation (FGM) {{is known to}} impact women's health, though {{is difficult to know}} the worldwide extent of this practice. While generally thought of as a Sub-Saharan African practice, it may have roots in the Middle East as well. The estimated 3 million girls who are subjected to FGM each year potentially suffer both immediate and lifelong negative effects. Immediately following FGM, girls commonly experience excessive bleeding and urine retention. Long-term consequences include urinary tract infections, <b>bacterial</b> <b>vaginosis,</b> pain during intercourse, and difficulties in childbirth that include prolonged labor, vaginal tears, and excessive bleeding. Women who have undergone FGM also have higher rates of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV2) than women who have not.|$|E
25|$|Biofilms {{have been}} found to be {{involved}} in a wide variety of microbial infections in the body, by one estimate 80% of all infections. Infectious processes in which biofilms have been implicated include common problems such as <b>bacterial</b> <b>vaginosis,</b> urinary tract infections, catheter infections, middle-ear infections, formation of dental plaque, gingivitis, coating contact lenses, and less common but more lethal processes such as endocarditis, infections in cystic fibrosis, and infections of permanent indwelling devices such as joint prostheses, heart valves, and intervertebral disc. More recently it has been noted that bacterial biofilms may impair cutaneous wound healing and reduce topical antibacterial efficiency in healing or treating infected skin wounds. Early detection of biofilms in wounds is crucial to successful chronic wound management. Although many techniques have developed to identify planktonic bacteria in viable wounds, few have been able to quickly and accurately identify bacterial biofilms. Future studies are needed to find means of identifying and monitoring biofilm colonization at the bedside to permit timely initiation of treatment.|$|E

2500|$|Probiotic {{treatment}} of <b>bacterial</b> <b>vaginosis</b> is the application or ingestion of bacterial species {{found in the}} healthy vagina to cure the infection of bacteria causing <b>bacterial</b> <b>vaginosis.</b> This treatment {{is based on the}} observation that 70% of healthy females have a group of bacteria in the genus Lactobacillus that dominate the population of organisms in the vagina. Currently, the success of such treatment has been mixed since the use of probiotics to restore healthy populations of Lactobacillus has not been standardized. [...] Often, standard antibiotic treatment is used {{at the same time that}} probiotics are being tested. [...] In addition, some groups of women respond to treatment based upon ethnicity, age, number of sexual partners, pregnancy, and the pathogens causing <b>bacterial</b> <b>vaginosis.</b> In 2013 researchers found that administration of hydrogen peroxide producing strains, such as L. acidophilus and L. rhamnosus, were able to normalize vaginal pH and rebalance vaginal flora, preventing and alleviating <b>bacterial</b> <b>vaginosis.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Boric acid {{can be used}} as an {{antiseptic}} {{for minor}} burns or cuts and is sometimes used in salves and dressings, such as boracic lint. Boric acid is applied in a very dilute solution as an eye wash. Dilute boric acid {{can be used as}} a vaginal douche to treat <b>bacterial</b> <b>vaginosis</b> due to excessive alkalinity, as well as candidiasis due to non-albicans candida. As an antibacterial compound, boric acid can also be used as an acne treatment. It is also used as prevention of athlete's foot, by inserting powder in the socks or stockings, and in alcohol solution can be used to treat some kinds of [...] (ear infection) in both humans and animals. The preservative in urine sample bottles in the UK is boric acid.|$|E
2500|$|Vaginal infections left {{untreated}} {{can lead to}} further complications, especially for the pregnant woman. For <b>bacterial</b> <b>vaginosis,</b> these include [...] "premature delivery, postpartum infections, clinically apparent and subclinical pelvic inflammatory disease, [...] postsurgical complications (after abortion, hysterectomy, caesarian section), increased vulnerability to HIV infection and, possibly, infertility". Studies have also linked trichomoniasis with increased likelihood of acquiring HIV; theories include that [...] "vaginitis increases the number of immune cells {{at the site of}} infection, and HIV then infects those immune cells." [...] Other theories suggest that trichomoniasis increases the amount of HIV genital shedding, thereby increasing the risk of transmission to sexual partners. [...] While the exact association between trichomoniasis infection and HIV genital shedding has not been consistently demonstrated, [...] "there is good evidence that TV treatment reduces HIV genital shedding. Five studies were reported in the literature and, of these, four found a decrease in HIV genital shedding after TV treatment." ...|$|E
