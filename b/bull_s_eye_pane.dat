40|$|Le sujet de ma thèse est l étude de la {{diffraction}} par des trous sub-longueur percés dans des films métalliques, ainsi que la compréhension du rôle des plasmons de surface (SPs) dans la diffraction en champ lointain. Nous avons construit un goniomètre fait maison de haute qualité. Une série de trous unique percés dans un film opaque et variant continûment de k r >> 1 à k r > 1 to k r<< 1 {{in a flat}} opaque film were explored, where k is the wavevector of {{the incident}} wave and r is the radius of the hole. The experimental {{results indicated that the}} diffraction of single hole can be classified into four regimes, depending on the input polarization. A simple analytical expression reveals {{for the first time the}} subtle interplay of two competing factors: one related to surface plasmon excitation and the other originating in the coupling of the field to the waveguide mode of the aperture. When the hole is surrounded by concentric grooves (<b>bull</b> <b>s</b> <b>eye</b> structure) and is illuminated with the grooves on the output side, the beaming effect occurs: far-field diffraction is confined in very small solid angle. The effects of geometrical parameters on <b>bull</b> <b>s</b> <b>eye</b> diffraction have been studied and the diffraction patterns with the width less than 1 in the far field have been achieved. Another surface waves (CWs) different from SPs on tungsten films were studied. It was demonstrated that the CWs have beaming effect as well. By comparison we showed that CWs display much weaker enhancement in transmission than SPs through nanostructures. STRASBOURG-Bib. electronique 063 (674829902) / SudocSudocFranceF...|$|R

It wasn’t so bad today as I {{was in the}} guard mess, where all the men on guard duty are fed. I still {{had to get up}} at 0300. How was your trip honey? I hope it wasn’t too tiring for you I think of you and try to picture where you are all the time As you know I meant to the range yesterday. I was {{extremely}} intere 4 sting. In the morning I pulled + marked targets. That is I stood in the pit {{directly in front of the}} targets and flashed back the shooter’s score. It’s done by disks. A white disk is a <b>bulls</b> <b>eye</b> (<b>s),</b> a red disk is 4, a black cross on white backgnd. Is 3, and a black disk is 2. A red flag means that the target was missed altogether. They call this flag “Maggie’s Drawers. ” In the afternoon I shot the carbine, got a score of 2150 out of a possible 200, that classifies me as a marksman. Then I fired the Thompson Machine Gun. Boy that was terrific. 25 shots went off in a fraction of a second. Afterward we were all searched for shells. You can get 6 months for swiping one of them. This classification is really beginning to wash-out the men. They’re washing out left and right. A fellow in the Orr barracks made it as a bombardier. I probably won’t know my results for a few days yet, though. If I fail, I fail. That’s all there is to it. If I can’t fly I can’t, what the hell, gunnery is allright [sic] too. All I hope is that you won’t be too disappointed if it happens. I got a letter from Don T. and Pat Palryample today. Everything is the same there. I just want to be issued a steel helmet. A P. A.

40|$|More {{and more}} people are putting away their {{eyeglasses}} and contact lenses as a result of laser vision correction surgery. LASIK, the most widely performed version of this surgical procedure, improves vision by reshaping the cornea, the clear front surface of the eye, using an excimer laser. One excimer laser system, Alcon s LADARVision 4000, utilizes a laser radar (LADAR) eye tracking device that gives it unmatched precision. During LASIK surgery, laser During LASIK surgery, laser pulses must be accurately placed to reshape the cornea. A challenge to this procedure is the patient <b>s</b> constant <b>eye</b> movement. A person <b>s</b> <b>eyes</b> make small, involuntary movements known as saccadic movements about 100 times per second. Since the saccadic movements will not stop during LASIK surgery, most excimer laser systems use an eye tracking device that measures the movements and guides the placement of the laser beam. LADARVision <b>s</b> <b>eye</b> tracking device stems from the LADAR technology originally developed through several Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) contracts with NASA s Johnson Space Center and the U. S. Department of Defense s Ballistic Missile Defense Office (BMDO). In the 1980 s, Johnson awarded Autonomous Technologies Corporation a Phase I SBIR contract to develop technology for autonomous rendezvous and docking of space vehicles to service satellites.
