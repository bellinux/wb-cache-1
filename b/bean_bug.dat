40|$|The <b>bean</b> <b>bug,</b> Riptortus pedestris (Fabricius), {{is one of}} {{the major}} pests of soybean; this pest mainly feeds on soybean pods. Its {{population}} is highest when the soybean plants bear mature seeds. We aimed to determine the effect of <b>bean</b> <b>bug</b> infestation on soybean according to changes in nutrient levels and seed germination potential. Newly emerged adult males of R. pedestris (n= 5 per plant) were released into a meshed cage containing soybean plants at the R 5 stage. Another meshed cage with soybean plants was treated as control. Healthy seeds harvested from control plants were selected and accounted as undamaged seeds and seeds from bug-released cages were visually categorized into 7 different classes according to the intensity of damage incurred due to <b>bean</b> <b>bug</b> infestation. The seeds were then compared in terms of changes in weight, protein, lipid, and carbohydrate content, and germination potential. Elevated protein levels were observed in seeds that showed a higher intensity of damage. On the other hand, the lipid and carbohydrate contents and germination potential were reduced in seeds showing a higher degree of damage. Germination potential in terms of lipid and carbohydrate loss caused by bug infestation is also discussed. 5 page(s...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Cotyledon Black Decay (CBD) on soybean sprout {{mimics the}} black spot due to {{microbial}} infection. CBD, not visible or predictable at seedlot state, for some reason, shows up exclusively on cotyledon of soybean sprout during sprouting process. Such an incidence rate fluctuated from 0. 8 to 19. 5 % {{over three years}} from 2004. We suspected some pod-infecting anthracnose fungi and/or pod-blight path-ogen, or pod-sucking <b>bean</b> <b>bug,</b> {{one of the major}} pests of soybean, might have involved, of which we ruled out fungal pathogen because it was preventable through heat treatment, a proven method for seedlot disinfestation. The healthy seeds artificially fed by <b>bean</b> <b>bug</b> for one to seven days were sprouted, and 6 to 41 % of the soybean sprout revealed the CBD mimic to those occurred in soybean sprout from previous commercial seedlot screening experiments. This finding is the first report to confirm that <b>bean</b> <b>bug</b> damage to pod at R 8 stage is directly responsible for the CBD, which did not concur with any other deleterious effects on sprouting such as reduction in hypocotyls elon-gation and rooting except unsightly sprout quality. How-ever, earlier feeding either at green pod or greenish yellow pod stage (R 6 -early R 7 stage) resulted in rather severe dama-ges, which strikingly reduced hypocotyls growth to about one forth to about two third, as well as the reduction in rates of seed germination...|$|E

Merr. ], cranberry bean (Phaseolus vulgaris), and black soybean [Glycine max (L.) ]. For the R. pedestris collected at bean fields, hairy vetch field, and outdoor field, the pheromones were also analyzed using gas chromatography. We focused on tetradecyl isobutyrate (TI) which is a known insect attractant. The bugs provided with cranberry beans secreted the most TI and those provided with hairy vetch secreted the least TI; the amount of TI secreted was different {{for each of the}} beans. The bean bugs’ TI secretion percentage was the highest for those that ingested black soybean and lowest for those that ingested hairy vetch. Aggregation pheromone secretions were affected by food sources; with cases of supporting plants displaying the lowest amount of secretion, whereas cases of supporting plants and seeds displayed the highest amount of secretion as well as the highest percentage of secreting <b>bean</b> <b>bugs.</b> <b>Bean</b> <b>bugs</b> captured in <b>bean</b> fields secreted the highest amount of TI component...|$|R

(Hemiptera: Alydidae). The total developmental time from the first instar nymph to adult ranged from 18 to 25. d; R. pedestris fed with white kidney beans were the slowest to develop. In addition, bugs fed with white kidney beans had the highest mortality (93 %) and the shortest longevity (18 d). R. pedestris fed with cowpeas, soybeans, or azuki beans had high reproductive success, with the highest egg hatching success recorded in bugs fed cowpeas. The results suggest that cowpea may be a beneficial food source for the development and reproduction of bean bugs. 3 page(s...|$|E

50|$|Megacopta cribraria, {{also called}} the <b>bean</b> plataspid, kudzu <b>bug,</b> kudzu beetle, {{globular}} stink bug and lablab bug, is a shield bug native to India and China, where it is an agricultural pest of lablab beans and other legumes. The bug, while harmless to houseplants and people, often enters houses. It is attracted to white surfaces such as the walls of houses or white vehicles, {{because of the high}} reflectance of the white surfaces {{as it relates to the}} bugs' simple eyes. As a defense mechanism, they emit a foul-smelling pheromone that also acts as a congregation pheromone. Aside from smelling foul, the liquid also creates a burning sensation and sometimes leaves a red welt on bare skin. It is similar to other Plataspididae in having a somewhat unusual symbiotic relationship with its gut bacteria. Before laying eggs, females deposit particles containing the symbiont, which are then eaten by newly hatched nymphs under natural conditions. Nymphs experimentally deprived of access to the symbiont exhibited slower growth, smaller body sizes and higher mortality.|$|R

Egg maturation increased with increasing adult age, reaching a peak(between 5 - 10 days), thereafter declined with further advancement in age. It also increased with increasing temperature though the egg maturation ceased to occur at 35 ℃. The longevity of O. nezarae was dependent on temperature and food availability.

40|$|Effects of RNA {{interference}} (RNAi) targeted against circadian clock genes on {{two distinct}} types of photoperiodic responses – ovarian development and lipid accumulation – were investigated in a <b>bean</b> <b>bug</b> Riptortus pedestris, to explore which physiological {{process in the}} photoperiodic response involved the circadian clock. Ovarian development and lipid accumulation {{are known to be}} regulated by distinct output pathways. Control insects showed clear photoperiodic responses; i. e. induction of ovarian development and suppression of lipid accumulation under long-day conditions, whereas opposite characteristics under short-day conditions. We found that RNAi directed against period, a negative element of the circadian clock, produced a long-day effect for both the ovarian development and lipid accumulation, while RNAi directed against Clock, a positive element of the circadian clock, produced a short-day effect for both, irrespective of photoperiod. These results indicate that the circadian clock comprised of these genes regulates a process governing both distinct photoperiodic responses...|$|E
40|$|Parasitoid {{reproductive}} {{biology is}} one of the central issues in biological control with parasitoids because the successful production of parasitoids is essential to mass-rearing of effective biocontrol agents. Parasitoid 2 ̆ 7 s fecundity can be influenced by several physical factors, and temperature is an important factor among them. Ooencyrtus nezarae is a common egg parasitoid attacking several hemipterans including the <b>bean</b> <b>bug</b> Riptortus clavatus, a serious pest of soybean, and is a candidate agent for biological control of soybean pests. In the present study, the lifetime reproduction of O. nezarae was examined under different temperature conditions. O. nezarae was able to parasitize host eggs at a wide range of temperatures from 20 to 30 ﾟC, and the highest mean fertility, i. e., the maximum progeny production, was around 75. 0 at 25 ﾟC. However, the lifetime production of progeny was largely reduced at 20 and 30 ﾟC conditions (33. 5 and 36. 0 parasitoid progeny, respectively).

40|$|The {{effects of}} host density on progeny production, clutch size and sex ratio of Ooencyrtus nezarae, an egg {{parasitoid}} of the <b>bean</b> <b>bug</b> Riptortus clavatus, were examined {{to determine the}} optimal host provision condition in which mass-rearing efficiency of the parasitoid is maximized. Female parasitoids allocated progeny in regard to host density {{so as to avoid}} laying more eggs than the host can support. The maximum progeny production and parasitism rate occurred when 5 host eggs were given everyday throughout the life time. However, if we continuously provided with hosts for ten consecutive days, the progeny production with one host per day was more consistent than that with five hosts per day. Female O. nezarae reduced the clutch size if the host density was beyond five. However, the overall progeny sex ratio remained constant regardless of the host density. The results suggested that the excessive exposure of the host to O. nezarae wouldn 2 ̆ 7 t affect the reproductive fitness, but would reduce the reproductive potential of this parasitoid, which can in turn affect the efficiency of mass rearing perspective...|$|E

But the information on mechanism of resistance to R. clavatus is limited. The objective {{of this study was}} to identify QTLs for R. clavatus resistance using simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers in a soybean population of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) developed from the cross PI 171451 × Hwaeomputkong. A genetic map from this population was constructed with a total of 136 SSR markers cover-ing 1073. 9 cM on 20 linkage groups (LGs). With 126 F 5 RILs, two independent QTLs for resistance to R. clavatus were mapped on LGs B 1 and C 2. The amount of phenotypic variation explained by these QTLs ranged from 12 to 16 %. PI 171451 showed an escape response to R. clavatus. Under feeding conditions, 14. 4 % of RILs showed greater resistance to R. clavatus than the resistant parent. The resistance to R. clavatus in soybean from PI 171451 was incomplete and quantitatively inherited and the QTLs for resistance to R. clavatus detected in the RIL population were not significantly affected by epistatic interactions...|$|E
40|$|The <b>bean</b> <b>bug</b> Riptortus pedestris {{possesses}} a specialized symbiotic organ in a posterior {{region of the}} midgut, where numerous crypts harbor extracellular betaproteobacterial symbionts of the genus Burkholderia. Second instar nymphs orally acquire the symbiont from the environment, and the symbiont infection benefits the host by facilitating growth and by occasionally conferring insecticide resistance. Here we performed comparative transcriptomic analyses of insect genes expressed in symbiotic and non-symbiotic regions of the midgut dissected from Burkholderia-infected and uninfected R. pedestris. Expression sequence tag analysis of cDNA libraries and quantitative reverse transcription PCR {{identified a number of}} insect genes expressed in symbiosis- or aposymbiosis-associated patterns. For example, genes up-regulated in symbiotic relative to aposymbiotic individuals, including many cysteine-rich secreted protein genes and many cathepsin protease genes, are likely {{to play a role in}} regulating the symbiosis. Conversely, genes up-regulated in aposymbiotic relative to symbiotic individuals, including a chicken-type lysozyme gene and a defensin-like protein gene, are possibly involved in regulation of non-symbiotic bacterial infections.

40|$|Development of {{insecticide}} resistance {{has been}} a serious concern worldwide, whose mechanisms {{have been attributed to}} evolutionary changes in pest insect genomes such as alteration of drug target sites, up-regulation of degrading enzymes, and enhancement of drug excretion. Here, we report a previously unknown mechanism of insecticide resistance: Infection with an insecticide-degrading bacterial symbiont immediately establishes insecticide resistance in pest insects. The <b>bean</b> <b>bug</b> Riptortus pedestris and allied stinkbugs harbor mutualistic gut symbiotic bacteria of the genus Burkholderia, which are acquired by nymphal insects from environmental soil every generation. In agricultural fields, fenitrothion-degrading Burkolderia strains are present at very low densities. We demonstrated that the fenitrothion-degrading Burkholderia strains establish a specific and beneficial symbiosis with the stinkbugs and confer a resistance of the host insects against fenitrothion. Experimental applications of fenitrothion to field soils drastically enriched fenitrothion-degrading bacteria from undetectable levels to > 80 % of total culturable bacterial counts in the field soils, and > 90 % of stinkbugs reared with the enriched soil established symbiosis with fenitrothion-degrading Burkholderia. In a Japanese island where fenitrothion has been constantly applied to sugarcane fields, we identified a stinkbug population wherein the insects live on sugarcane and ≈ 8 % of them host fenitrothion-degrading Burkholderia. Our finding suggests the possibility that the symbiont-mediated insecticide resistance may develop {{even in the absence of}} pest insects, quickly establish within a single insect generation, and potentially move around horizontally between different pest insects and other organisms...|$|E
40|$|Lipopolysaccharide, {{the outer}} cell wall {{component}} of Gram-negative bacteria, {{has been shown}} to be important for symbiotic associations. We recently reported that the lipopolysaccharide O-antigen of Burkholderia enhances the initial colonization of the midgut of the <b>bean</b> <b>bug,</b> Riptortus pedestris. However, the midgut-colonizing Burkholderia symbionts lack the O-antigen, but display the core oligosaccharide on the cell surface. In this study, we investigated the role of the core oligosaccharide, which directly interacts with the host midgut, in the Riptortus-Burkholderia symbiosis. To this end, we generated the core oligosaccharide mutant strains, ΔwabS, ΔwabO, ΔwaaF and ΔwaaC, and determined the chemical structures of their oligosaccharides, which exhibited different compositions. The symbiotic properties of these mutant strains were compared with those of the wild-type and O-antigen-deficient ΔwbiG strains. Upon introduction into Riptortus via the oral route, the core oligosaccharide mutant strains exhibited different rates of colonization of the insect midgut. The symbiont titers in fifth instar insects revealed significantly reduced population sizes of the inner core oligosaccharide mutant strains ΔwaaF and ΔwaaC. These two strains also negatively affected host growth rate and fitness. Furthermore, R. pedestris individuals colonized with the ΔwaaF and ΔwaaC strains were vulnerable to septic bacterial challenge, similar to insects without a Burkholderia symbiont. Taken together, these results suggest that the core oligosaccharide of Burkholderia symbionts plays a critical role in maintaining a proper symbiont population and in supporting the beneficial effects of the symbiont on its host in the Riptortus-Burkholderia symbiosis...|$|E
