5|$|At the prom, Artie and Marge are voted prom {{king and}} queen, {{and the two}} share the first dance. Meanwhile, Homer, heartbroken, leaves and cries in the hallway. After the prom, Artie tries to get romantic with Marge in the <b>backseat</b> <b>of</b> his car: after he pushes his luck too far, she slaps him and demands to be taken home. Meanwhile, Homer's {{limousine}} time has run out, and without any money, he decides to walk home. Along the way Marge and Artie pass by Homer. After Artie drops Marge off at her house, she returns in her car to pick up Homer, realizing {{that he was the}} man for her all along. Homer manages to fix up the strap of Marge's dress with the corsage that he got her after Artie ruined it from his earlier attempt.|$|E
5|$|Cagney {{was even}} more violent towards women in the gangster film Picture Snatcher (1933): in one scene, he knocks out an amorous woman whose {{feelings}} he does not reciprocate and violently throws her into the <b>backseat</b> <b>of</b> his car. In April 1931, the same month as the release of The Public Enemy, Hays recruited former police chief August Vollmer to conduct {{a study on the}} effect gangster pictures had on children. After he had finished his work, Vollmer stated that gangster films were innocuous and even overly favorable in depicting the police. Although Hays used the results to defend the film industry, the New York State censorship board was not impressed, and from 1930 through 1932, removed 2,200 crime scenes from pictures.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} written by {{executive}} producer Diane Ruggiero and directed by John T. Kretchmer, marking Ruggiero's sixteenth and penultimate writing credit and Kretchmer's twelfth directing credit. One scene in the episode depicts Veronica and Max sitting in the <b>backseat</b> <b>of</b> a vehicle with Chelsea's pimp (a woman) and several bodyguards. Kretchmer decided to place one of the physically domineering bodyguards between Max and Veronica for comedic effect. In addition, Thomas noted that the actress of the pimp, Jackie Debatin, appeared in a similar role in an episode of The Office several weeks after the episode aired. The scene in which Keith, in a Sheriff's uniform, spots Don Lamb in his car was difficult to edit because although there was initially no radio music playing, Michael Muhney, the actor of Lamb, was moving his mouth as if singing lyrics. Thomas reported difficulty in finding a song that would match the movements.|$|E

5|$|At home, Homer {{finds the}} {{personalized}} bowling glove given to Marge by Jacques and realizes {{he may be}} losing her. It is not long until Bart realizes that Lisa's suspicions are proving to be true about their parents drifting apart and offers Homer some advice in keeping his mouth shut so it does not get worse. At work the next day, he cannot bring himself to eat the sandwich she made for him, {{saying that it is}} all he has left of her. Marge leaves for her meeting with Jacques, but finds herself reminded of lifetime commitment throughout the drive. She comes to a fork in the road, one way leading to the nuclear plant, the other to Jacques' apartment. After an agonized hesitation at the crux of the decision, she surprises Homer at the plant and kisses him warmly. An ecstatic Homer abandons his work post to carry Marge away in his arms. His co-workers want to know what to tell the boss. To the sound of their cheers, he says to say {{that they are going to}} the <b>backseat</b> <b>of</b> his car and will not be back for ten minutes.|$|E
5|$|Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) asks Dunder Mifflin CEO David Wallace (Andy Buckley) if he {{can work}} {{part-time}} so he can go to Philadelphia to help with his sports marketing job. David Wallace says {{that he might be}} needed in the office if there is a crisis with one of his clients, to which he responds that Stanley Hudson (Leslie David Baker) and Phyllis Vance (Phyllis Smith) have agreed to cover for him, though he in fact has not asked them yet. Stanley and Phyllis respond with their usual disinterest in helping others, so Jim offers to treat them to lunch. Stanley and Phyllis order extra side dishes and help themselves to an excess of wine, annoying Jim with drunken behavior and silencing him whenever he brings up the subject of their covering for him. When they arrive back at the office, a drunk Stanley and Phyllis are seemingly passed out in the <b>backseat</b> <b>of</b> Jim's car. When Jim puts his coat on them to keep them warm, Phyllis and Stanley say they will cover for him as they care for Jim and his family, laughing as they reveal they were only pranking him. Jim gives both of them a hug.|$|E

25|$|Brown {{broke the}} magazine's longstanding taboo against {{treating}} photography seriously in 1992, when she invited Richard Avedon {{to be its}} first staff photographer. She also approved controversial covers from {{a new crop of}} artists, including Edward Sorel's October 1992 cover that had people buzzing about the meaning of a punk rock passenger sprawled in the <b>backseat</b> <b>of</b> an elegant horse-drawn carriage: was it Brown's self-mocking riposte to fears she would downgrade the magazine? A year later a national controversy was provoked by her publication of Art Spiegelman's Valentine's Day cover of a Jewish man and a black woman in an embracing kiss, a comment on the mounting racial tensions between blacks and ultra-Orthodox Jews in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn, New York.|$|E

5|$|Agriculture, {{which was}} once a major {{occupation}} {{of the people of}} Dakshina Kannada, has taken a <b>backseat</b> because <b>of</b> the influx of money from natives settled in other cities, states and countries. Significant number of people from this district work in the Gulf (Middle East) countries and other states of India. Farms and fields are being converted into residential plots and commercial (shopping) complexes. Horticulture, though, has made some strides, and measures have been taken to improve the fruit plantation sector. The main crops of Dakshina Kannada are Paddy, Coconut, Arecanut, Black Pepper, Cashew and Cocoa. Rubber, Banana and Vanilla crops are also cultivated in the Sullia taluk. Rice is generally cultivated three seasons in a year, Karthika or Yenel (May–October), Suggi (October to January) and Kolake (January to April). Urad (Black gram) is grown in some areas during the season of Suggi. The Karnataka Milk Federation has a milk processing plant at Kulshekar in Mangalore. This plant processes milk procured from the cattle owned by farmers of the district.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Sequence {{analysis}} of the orangutan genome revealed that recent proliferative activity of Alu elements has been uncharacteristically quiescent in the Pongo (orangutan) lineage, compared with all previously studied primate genomes. With relatively few young polymorphic insertions, the genomic landscape of the orangutan seemed like the ideal place {{to search for a}} driver, or source element, of Alu retrotransposition. Results Here we report the identification of a nearly pristine insertion possessing all the known putative hallmarks of a retrotranspositionally competent Alu element. It is located in an intronic sequence of the DGKB gene on chromosome 7 and is highly conserved in Hominidae (the great apes), but absent from Hylobatidae (gibbon and siamang). We provide evidence for the evolution of a lineage-specific subfamily of this shared Alu insertion in orangutans and possibly the lineage leading to humans. In the orangutan genome, this insertion contains three orangutan-specific diagnostic mutations which are characteristic of the youngest polymorphic Alu subfamily, Alu Ye 5 b 5 _ Pongo. In the Homininae lineage (human, chimpanzee and gorilla), this insertion has acquired three different mutations which are also found in a single human-specific Alu insertion. Conclusions This seemingly stealth-like amplification, ongoing at a very low rate over millions of years of evolution, suggests that this shared insertion may represent an ancient <b>backseat</b> driver <b>of</b> Alu element expansion. </p...|$|R
