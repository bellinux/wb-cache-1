5|$|Final {{assembly}} for the A321 would be, as a {{first for}} any Airbus, carried out in Germany (then West Germany). This came after a dispute between the French, who claimed the move would incur $150million (€135 million) in unnecessary expenditure associated with the new plant, and the Germans, arguing {{it would be more}} productive for Airbus in the long run. The second production line was located at Hamburg, which would also subsequently produce the smaller Airbus A319 and A318. For the first time, Airbus entered the <b>bond</b> <b>market,</b> through which it raised $480million (€475 million) to finance development costs. An additional $180million (€175 million) was borrowed from European Investment Bank and private investors.|$|E
5|$|The buyout of RJR Nabisco was {{completed}} in April 1989 and KKR would spend the early 1990s repaying the RJR's enormous debt load {{through a series of}} asset sales and restructuring transactions. After the RJR Nabisco deal, KKR did not complete a single investment in 1990, the first such year since 1982. They would not complete another major leveraged buyout transaction for more than three years, largely because of the shutdown of the high yield <b>bond</b> <b>market</b> and the collapse of Drexel Burnham Lambert which filed for bankruptcy in February 1990. KKR began to focus primarily on its existing portfolio companies acquired during the buyout boom of the late 1980s. Six of KKR's portfolio companies completed IPOs in 1991, including RJR Nabisco and Duracell.|$|E
5|$|The {{international}} US-based {{credit rating}} agencies—Moody's, Standard & Poor's and Fitch—which {{have already been}} under fire during the housing bubble and the Icelandic crisis—have also played a central and controversial role in the current European <b>bond</b> <b>market</b> crisis. On one hand, the agencies {{have been accused of}} giving overly generous ratings due to conflicts of interest. On the other hand, ratings agencies have a tendency to act conservatively, and to take some time to adjust when a firm or country is in trouble. In the case of Greece, the market responded to the crisis before the downgrades, with Greek bonds trading at junk levels several weeks before the ratings agencies began to describe them as such.|$|E

In July 2013, the three employees were convicted of conspiracy in the muni market fraud: former UBS Vice President Gary Heinz was sentenced to 27 months in prison and fined US$400,000; former UBS global commodities chief Peter Ghavami was sentenced to 18 months and fined US $1 million; and former UBS VP Michael Welty received a 16-month sentence and fined US$300,000. In addition to conspiracy, Ghavami and Heinz also were convicted of wire fraud. Federal prosecutors had asked for much harsher sentences, but U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood rebuffed the request. Wood said that the criminal behavior of the three was an aberration from their normal law-abiding lives.|$|E
5|$|Both of {{the latest}} bailout {{programme}} audit reports, released independently by the European Commission and IMF in June 2014, revealed that even after transfer of the scheduled bailout funds and full implementation of the agreed adjustment package in 2012, {{there was a new}} forecast financing gap of: €5.6bn in 2014, €12.3bn in 2015, and €0bn in 2016. The new forecast financing gaps will need either to be covered by the government's additional lending from private capital markets, or to be countered by additional fiscal improvements through expenditure reductions, revenue hikes or increased amount of privatizations. Due to an improved outlook for the Greek economy, with return of a government structural surplus in 2012, return of real GDP growth in 2014, and a decline of the unemployment rate in 2015, it was possible for the Greek government to return to the <b>bond</b> <b>market</b> during the course of 2014, for the purpose of fully funding its new extra financing gaps with additional private capital. A total of €6.1bn was received from the sale of three-year and five-year bonds in 2014, and the Greek government now plans to cover its forecast financing gap for 2015 with additional sales of seven-year and ten-year bonds in 2015.|$|E

30|$|This paper also {{focuses on}} {{different}} types of interdependence between the stock <b>markets</b> and government <b>bond</b> <b>markets</b> in the same region. First, the interdependence between the stock <b>markets</b> and the <b>bond</b> <b>markets</b> in the same region {{is much more important}} than the interdependence across different regions (Baur and Lucey 2009). Second, the paper investigates the interdependence between the stock <b>markets</b> and the <b>bond</b> <b>markets</b> in 39 countries. The samples already cover approximately 80 % of the global GDP, and therefore, it can be concluded that this paper’s analysis is reliable. The interdependence across different regions may result in an overly complicated analysis. In addition, over recent years the interdependence between the stock <b>markets</b> and the <b>bond</b> <b>markets</b> has become quite valuable because the debt crisis {{is one of the most}} important parts in the Subprime Crisis and the European Debt Crisis. The financial derivatives or the real estate markets are less liquid and important than government <b>bond</b> <b>markets</b> in most of the emerging markets. Thus, in this paper, our analysis emphasizes the stock markets and the government <b>bond</b> <b>markets</b> in 39 countries.|$|R

25|$|As {{estimated}} by the <b>Bond</b> <b>Market</b> Association, in the United States, the total amount outstanding {{at the end of}} 2004 was $1.8 trillion. This amount was about 8 percent of total outstanding <b>bond</b> <b>market</b> debt ($23.6 trillion), about 33 percent of mortgage-related debt ($5.5 trillion), and about 39 percent of corporate debt ($4.7 trillion) in the United States. In nominal terms, over the previous ten years (1995–2004) ABS amount outstanding had grown about 19 percent annually, with mortgage-related debt and corporate debt each growing at about 9 percent. Gross public issuance of asset-backed securities was strong, setting new records in many years. In 2004, issuance was at an all-time record of about $0.9 trillion.|$|E
40|$|Volatility {{spillover}} {{from the}} US and aggregate European <b>bond</b> <b>markets</b> into individual European <b>bond</b> <b>markets</b> using a GARCH volatility-spillover model is analysed.

Considering the massive economic measures {{that have been taken}} over the past 12 months or so, Egyptian economic policymakers score high based on the inside lag, i.e. the lapse of time between the moment that the shock began to affect the economy and the moment that economic (monetary and fiscal) policy as well as the regulatory policy are altered and put into effect in response to the shock to various markets: goods market (real GDP), the labor market (unemployment rate), money market (interest rate and inflation), and the financial (stock and <b>bond)</b> <b>market.</b> Indeed, moderate financial panic occurred driven—at least partially—by the fear that other investors are about to panic and sell.

25|$|Credit rating {{agencies}} {{originated in the}} United States in the early 1900s, when ratings began {{to be applied to}} securities, specifically those related to the railroad <b>bond</b> <b>market.</b> In the United States, the construction of extensive railroad systems had {{led to the development of}} corporate bond issues to finance them, and therefore a <b>bond</b> <b>market</b> several times larger than in other countries. The bond markets in the Netherlands and Britain had been established longer but tended to be small, and revolved around sovereign governments that were trusted to honor their debts. Companies were founded to provide investors with financial information on the growing railroad industry, including Henry Varnum Poor's publishing company, which produced a publication compiling financial data about the railroad and canal industries. Following the 1907 financial crisis, demand rose for such independent market information, in particular for independent analyses of bond creditworthiness. In 1909, financial analyst John Moody issued a publication focused solely on railroad bonds. His ratings became the first to be published widely in an accessible format, and his company was the first to charge subscription fees to investors.|$|E
