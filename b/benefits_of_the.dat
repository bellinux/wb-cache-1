5|$|Another {{criticism}} is that outcomes {{are presented in}} terms of relative risk reduction to exaggerate the apparent <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> treatment.

"So {{the test}} is whether <b>the</b> {{alteration}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> articles was in <b>the</b> opinion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shareholders for <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> company.By what criterion is the Court to ascertain <b>the</b> opinion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shareholders upon this question? The alteration may be so oppressive as to cast suspicion on <b>the</b> honesty <b>of</b> <b>the</b> persons responsible for it, or so extravagant that no reasonable men could really consider it for <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> company. In such cases the Court is, I think, entitled to treat <b>the</b> conduct <b>of</b> shareholders as it does <b>the</b> verdict <b>of</b> a jury, {{and to say that}} <b>the</b> alteration <b>of</b> a companys articles shall not stand if it is such that no reasonable men could consider it for <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> company. Or, if the facts should raise the question, the Court may be able to apply another test - namely, whether or not <b>the</b> action <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shareholders is capable of being considered for <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> company. I cannot agree with what seems to have been <b>the</b> view <b>of</b> Peterson J. in Dafen Tinplate Co. v. Llanelly Steel Co. that whenever the Court and the shareholders may differ in opinion upon what is for <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> company, <b>the</b> view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Court must prevail. In the present case it seems to me impossible to say that <b>the</b> action <b>of</b> these defendants was either incapable <b>of</b> being for <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> company or such that no reasonable men could consider it for <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> company. It is idle to say that their action was directed against the plaintiff, because the more outrageous <b>the</b> conduct <b>of</b> a director <b>the</b> more certain it is that his removal will be bona fide for <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> company, and the more certainly will <b>the</b> efforts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shareholders, acting bona fide and for <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> company, be directed against him, because it is necessary to protect the company against such conduct for the future.

5|$|Another {{issue of}} {{controversy}} was {{the scale of}} its actual scientific return, particularly following {{the loss of the}} Spektr science module.

As such, a large amount of American research was inaccessible, reducing the science that could be performed. The safety issues caused NASA to reconsider the future of the program at various times.

The Central Valley Project Improvement Act, passed in 1992, intends to alleviate some of the problems associated with the CVP with programs like the Refuge Water Supply Program.|$|E

5|$|Many {{indigenous}} communities did not evenly {{share in the}} <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> economic boom Taiwan experienced during {{the last quarter of}} the 20th century. They often lacked satisfactory educational resources on their reservations, undermining their pursuit of marketable skills. The economic disparity between the village and urban schools resulted in imposing many social barriers on aborigines, which prevent many from moving beyond vocational training. Students transplanted into urban schools face adversity, including isolation, culture shock, and discrimination from their peers. The cultural impact of poverty and economic marginalization has led to an increase in alcoholism and prostitution among aborigines.|$|E

Other Republican politicians discouraged efforts to advertise the <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> law. Some conservative political groups launched ad campaigns to discourage enrollment.|$|E

The Union was meant to strengthen Polish control over Galicia, Moldavia, and Wallachia rather than to create fresh troubles in the north. Jogaila was preoccupied with the management of his court, battles in the southeast, and his sickly wife. He attempted to replace Skirgaila with his younger brother Vygantas, but this brother died under unclear circumstances – according to rumor he was poisoned by either Vytautas or Skirgaila. Klemens Moskarzewski was replaced with Jan Oleśnicki from Kraków as governor of Vilnius. Jogaila decided to seek a compromise with Vytautas.|$|E
5|$|Opposition members criticized Ravalomanana in {{the later}} period of his presidency, accusing him of {{increasing}} authoritarianism and the mixing {{of public and private}} interests. In addition, the <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country's growth were not evenly spread, leading to increased wealth inequality, inflation and a decline in purchasing power for the lower and middle classes. In 2008 a controversial land lease agreement with Korean agricultural firm Daewoo, the purchase of a costly presidential jet and the closure of media channels owned by opposition leader and mayor of Antananarivo, Andry Rajoelina, strengthened popular disapproval of his policies. Rajoelina rallied popular support for the opposition, leading to a popular uprising that began in January 2009 and ended two months later with Ravalomanana's resignation under pressure and Rajoelina taking control with military support in a power transfer viewed by the international community as a coup d'état.|$|E
