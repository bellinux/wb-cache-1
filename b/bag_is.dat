5|$|Clearly, {{some sort}} of {{flexible}} bag was required to contain an explosive gel so {{that it did not}} matter how the bomb landed on the target. However, a flexible <b>bag</b> <b>is</b> hard to throw and trials had not been at all satisfactory. Discussions of the problem in Macrae's office were overheard by Gordon Norwood, a master printer who Macrae had recruited from his former magazine publishing employer, but he was not directly working on the weapon. Norwood suggested that what was needed was a frangible container and to the annoyance of the War Office store keeper he obtained a 150 W light bulb with which to demonstrate his point: a spherical glass flask inside a sock of woven wool is rigid when thrown, but on contact the glass breaks and the bomb deforms to the required shape. Experiments with glass flasks filled with cold porridge confirmed that this was the way to go. The grenade needed a delay for the thrower to get clear, so the woollen sock was covered in a sticky substance ensuring that the bomb stayed in place for a few seconds before detonating. Having covered the bomb in glue, a non-sticky handle was required. In the handle, a delay fuse was ignited by releasing a sprung lever so that a five second time delay starts as the grenade leaves the thrower's hand (just like the levers found on a conventional Mills bomb type hand grenade).|$|E
5|$|In Hyderabad, Gautham accidentally spoils Sameera's {{birthday}} plans, infuriating her. Although he {{is convinced}} {{that he has made}} up an enemy to cope with being an orphan, a mysterious person tries to kill Sameera. Gautham saves her and proposes marriage, which she accepts. Sameera learns that the mysterious person is Antonio Rosarios, a Goa-based crime boss who wants to kill her because she tried to expose the presence of hydrogen cyanide in seeds sold by Rosarios' company, AG1. Gautham meets Rosarios in the lobby of Sameera's office building. Assuming that he is an illusion, he shoots Rosarios in his head. By the time Gautham realises Rosarios is real he is dead, and Gautham learns that his parents were murdered. He catches an aged taxi driver who was stalking him (one of the three men he imagined), and learns that two London-based Indians (one of whom was Rosarios) killed his parents; his father gave the taxi driver a bag to give to Gautham. In the <b>bag</b> <b>is</b> an old Rubik's Cube, a key and a British coin.|$|E

25|$|A popcorn <b>bag</b> <b>is</b> a {{specially}} designed, microwaveable bag that contains popcorn, along with oil, spices and seasoning. The <b>bag</b> <b>is</b> typically partially folded {{when it is}} placed in a microwave oven, and inflates {{as a result of}} steam pressure from the heated kernels. The earliest patent for the popcorn bag, U.S. patent #4,267,420 was filed on October 12, 1978 by William A. Brastad of Minneapolis and issued on May 12, 1981.|$|E

25|$|Lift bag {{appropriate}} capacity should {{match the}} task at hand. If the lift <b>bag</b> <b>is</b> grossly oversized a runaway or otherwise out of control ascent may result. Commercially available lifting bags may incorporate dump valves to allow the operator to control the buoyancy during ascent, {{but this is a}} hazardous operation with high risk of entanglement in an uncontrolled lift or sinking. If a single <b>bag</b> <b>is</b> insufficient, multiple bags may be used, and should be distributed to suit the load.|$|E

The thicker plastic <b>bags</b> <b>are</b> levied and although this move initially caused outrage with consumers and an initial decline in volumes, consumers use has continually increased to several billion plastic shopping bags every year. http://www.econrsa.org/papers/p_papers/pp18.pdf ...|$|R
30|$|Methods: The {{contents}} of three existing <b>bags</b> <b>were</b> audited to assess uniformity. Users' perception {{and experience of}} the <b>bags</b> <b>were</b> audited.

25|$|The tubing {{from the}} bag of fluid being {{administered}} that connects to directly to the patient is called the primary tubing. Any additional IVs to be administered {{are connected to the}} primary tubing and are called secondary IV, or IV piggyback instead of having to place multiple catheters in the patient. When administering a secondary IV medication, the primary <b>bag</b> <b>is</b> held lower than the secondary bag so that the secondary medication can flow into the primary tubing rather than fluid from the primary bag flowing into the secondary tubing. The fluid from the primary <b>bag</b> <b>is</b> needed to help flush any remaining medication from the secondary IV from the tubing into the patient.|$|E
25|$|A <b>bag</b> <b>is</b> a non-rigid or {{semi-rigid}} container usually made of paper {{which is used}} to hold items or packages. In 1868, Margaret E.

40|$|Plastic {{shopping}} <b>bags</b> <b>were</b> {{introduced to}} the consumer market about 25 years ago. Since then, they’ve become-literally-a ubiquitous part of the American landscape.

50|$|Whereas {{strapping}} and lashing {{is often}} used to secure odd-shaped cargo such as machinery, structures, and vehicles. Dunnage <b>bags</b> <b>are</b> mostly used for homogeneous shaped cargo such as food & beverage products, electronics and appliances and roll paper. Often, strapping/lashing and dunnage <b>bags</b> <b>are</b> used in combination to secure chemical products.

5000|$|Travel <b>bags</b> <b>are</b> {{available}} with many combinations of size and features, but are distinguished by rigid and/or heavily padded construction, including the clubhead cover (which on most other <b>bags</b> <b>is</b> simply an unpadded [...] "rain fly"), and locks on the zippers and bag cover. These features protect the clubs from abuse and theft, and generally makes the bag suitable for checked airline luggage. Travel <b>bags</b> <b>are</b> generally used by amateur players that travel occasionally, such as business executives; rigid flight cases that enclose the actual golf <b>bag</b> <b>are</b> generally preferred by touring players, as these cases can enclose any golf <b>bag,</b> <b>are</b> more discreet {{as to their}} contents thus further deterring theft, and the case's weight and bulk can be left behind while on the course where it's not needed.|$|R
25|$|Lift bags {{also can}} be used for static lifts, where the <b>bag</b> <b>is</b> {{anchored}} in place by rigging, and used as a lifting point with very high buoyancy compared to the load, which is then lifted in a controlled manner using a purchase or chain block or other suitable lifting device.|$|E
25|$|Metro {{travelers}} are often seen {{keeping a close}} guard on their belongings, as petty or opportunistic theft is a significant problem in Santiago.

25|$|An air{{sickness}} bag, {{also known}} as a barf bag, airsick bag, sick bag, or motion sickness <b>bag,</b> <b>is</b> a small bag commonly provided to passengers on board airplanes and boats to collect and contain vomit in the event of motion sickness.

30|$|The {{positions}} of {{the same type of}} <b>bags</b> <b>were</b> identical in a given trial. Thus, in Fig.  5, all <b>bags</b> <b>were</b> attached to the lower right side of a bigger circle.

50|$|Traditional plastic <b>bags</b> <b>are</b> {{usually made}} from polyethylene, which {{consists}} of long chains of ethylene monomers. Ethylene is derived from natural gas and petroleum.

Color concentrates and other additives are often used to add tint to the plastic. Plastic shopping <b>bags</b> <b>are</b> commonly manufactured by blown film extrusion.|$|R
50|$|Following a National Assembly vote on October 11, 2014, France banned plastic carrier bags under 50 microns {{starting}} July 1, 2016. Produce <b>bags</b> <b>are</b> banned starting January 1, 2017. Re-usable or compostable <b>bags</b> <b>are</b> allowed.|$|R
