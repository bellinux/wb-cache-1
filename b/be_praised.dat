He was posthumously inducted into the Modern Drummer Hall of Fame in 1982, becoming only the second rock drummer to be chosen, and in 2011, Moon was voted the second-greatest drummer in history by a Rolling Stone readers' poll.|$|E

The video did not receive extensive play on MTV, although it was popular on The Box, VH1, and in Canada, where it was played on MuchMusic. The video, due to its animation, also later went on to <b>be</b> <b>praised</b> at various animation festivals worldwide.|$|E

5|$|Reviewers {{identified}} the contributions from Driessen, Flanders and Boyer as of particular interest, though challenged {{the inclusion of}} chapters focussed on the environment. They also criticised the book's failure to include contributions from, or sufficiently engage with the work of, the key voices in the politically focused animal ethics literature, such as Robert Garner, Sue Donaldson and Will Kymlicka, Alasdair Cochrane, Kimberly Smith or Siobhan O'Sullivan. Wissenburg's chapter was identified as the one which engaged most directly with this literature; his approach, however, was a negative one. Garner has written that Political Animals and Animal Politics should <b>be</b> <b>praised</b> for its trailblazing, but predicted {{that it would be}} superseded by stronger collections on the same theme.|$|E
25|$|Key {{points in}} the trip were filmed by Academy Award winning cinematographer from Hollywood, Floyd Crosby, who would later <b>be</b> <b>praised</b> {{for his work on}} High Noon.

To map the route of the expedition, the Canadian {{government}} sent along two geographers, Frank Swannell and Ernest Lemarque. The expedition started off at Edmonton, Alberta on 6 July 1934 and their goal was to travel 1500 miles to Telegraph Creek, British Columbia. Much of the trip would have to be made through regions that were relatively uncharted and had no trails.|$|E
25|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 1960s, Sutherland had already established a reputation as a diva with a voice out of the ordinary. She sang Lucia to great acclaim in Paris in 1960 and, in 1961, at La Scala and the Metropolitan Opera. In 1960, she sang a superb Alcina at La Fenice, Venice, where she was nicknamed La Stupenda ("The Stunning One"). Lucia di Lammermoor generated so much excitement that standees began lining up at 7:30 that morning. Her singing of the Mad Scene drew a thunderous 12-minute ovation. Sutherland would soon <b>be</b> <b>praised</b> as La Stupenda in newspapers around the world. Later that year (1960), Sutherland sang Alcina at the Dallas Opera, with which she made her US debut.|$|E

It was only by the mid-19th century that it began to <b>be</b> <b>praised,</b> although it is now considered {{to be one of}} the greatest odes in the English language. A long debate over the poem's final statement divided 20th-century critics, but most agreed on the beauty of the work, despite various perceived inadequacies.|$|E
500|$|Flanagan {{continued}} to <b>be</b> <b>praised</b> for {{the elegance of}} his playing – critic Ben Ratliff commented in 1998 that the trio with Washington and drummer Lewis Nash was, [...] "in its controlled, elegant way, [...] {{one of the more}} extraordinarily coordinated piano trios in jazz's history". Despite the near-unanimous praise from critics and musicians for Flanagan's recordings and concert performances after he left Fitzgerald, he did not secure a recording contract with a major label for more than one album.|$|E

500|$|Lafayette, though {{initially}} acclaimed, {{found that}} he had tied himself too closely to the king. As the Revolution progressed, he was hounded into exile by the radical leadership. Maillard returned to Paris with {{his status as a}} local hero made permanent. He participated in several later journées, but in 1794 became stricken with illness, dying at the age of thirty-one. For the women of Paris, the march became the source of apotheosis in revolutionary hagiography.

500|$|This {{nation of}} ours hath, for an hundred years past, been infested by two enemies, the Papists and fanatics, who, each in their turns, {{filled it with}} blood and slaughter, and, for a time, {{destroyed}} both the Church and government.

The fanatics revile us, as too nearly approaching to Popery; and the Papists condemn us, as bordering too much on fanaticism.

500|$|An {{interest}} in portraying [...] "actual human drama" [...] has led Moore to these roles. She is particularly {{moved by the}} concept of an individual repressing their troubles and striving to maintain dignity. Parts where the character achieves an amazing feat are of little interest to her, because [...] "we're just not very often in that position in our lives." [...] Early in her career, Moore established a reputation for pushing boundaries, and she continues to <b>be</b> <b>praised</b> for her [...] "fearless" [...] performances and for taking on difficult roles.

Maintaining strong ratings since 2002, Kim Possibles premiere was the most-watched of any Disney Channel Original Series.

500|$|Later reviews {{were able}} to judge the series based on full seasons. While the acting, set design, costuming, art {{direction}} and cinematography continued to <b>be</b> <b>praised,</b> some reviewers disfavored the writing, especially of Season 1, saying [...] "the plot momentum is often virtually non-existent" [...] or as [...] "sometimes gripping but mostly boring." [...] Other reviewers pointed out that Carnivàle may [...] "demand more from its audience than many are willing to invest. [...] Without paying close attention, it's tempting {{to assume that the}} show is unnecessarily cryptic and misleading." [...] Carnivàle story was surveyed as long and complex, [...] "and if you don't start from the beginning, you'll be completely lost." [...] IGN DVD's Matt Casamassina, however, praised the show in two reviews, writing that the [...] "gorgeously surreal" [...] first season [...] "dazzles with unpredictable plot twists and scares", and that the [...] "extraordinary" [...] second season was [...] "better fantasy – better entertainment, period – than any show that dares to call itself a competitor." ...|$|E
