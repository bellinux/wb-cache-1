5|$|For the 1947–48 season, defenceman Doug Harvey {{joined the}} team. Within {{a couple years}} Harvey would <b>become</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> offensive-oriented defenceman in the NHL and he and Bouchard would form a long-time and very {{effective}} defensive pairing. Whenever Harvey undertook one of the offensive rushes for which he became famous, he was confident {{in the knowledge that}} Bouchard was backing him up if he was to lose the puck.|$|E

Finally, the player may face off against Red atop Mt. Silver, who serves as the game's final boss.|$|E

5|$|Most of {{the boys}} at St. Mary's played {{baseball}} in organized leagues {{at different levels of}} proficiency. Ruth later estimated that he played 200 games a year as he steadily climbed the ladder of success. Although he played all positions {{at one time or another}} (including infield positions generally reserved for right-handers), he gained stardom as a pitcher. According to Brother Matthias, Ruth was standing to one side laughing at the bumbling pitching efforts of fellow students, and Matthias told him to go in and see if he could do better. Ruth had <b>become</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> pitcher at St. Mary's, and when he was 18 in 1913, he was allowed to leave the premises to play weekend games on teams that were drawn from the community. He was mentioned in several newspaper articles, for both his pitching prowess and ability to hit long home runs.|$|E
5|$|Authors of the 12th and 13th centuries such as Joseph of Exeter and Albert of Stade {{continued}} {{to tell the}} legend of the Trojan War in Latin in a form that follows Dares' tale with Troilus remaining {{one of the most important}} warriors on the Trojan side. However, it was two of their contemporaries, Benoît de Sainte-Maure in his French verse romance and Guido delle Colonne in his Latin prose history, both also admirers of Dares, who were to define the tale of Troy for the remainder of the medieval period. The details of their narrative of the war were copied, for example, in the Troy Books of Laud and Lydgate and also Raoul Lefevre's Recuyell of the Historyes of Troye. Lefevre, through Caxton's 1474 printed translation, was in turn to <b>become</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> known retelling of the Troy story in Renaissance England and influenced Shakespeare among others. The story of Troilus as a lover, invented by Benoît and retold by Guido, generated a second line of influence. It was taken up as a tale that could be told in its own right by Boccaccio and then by Chaucer who established a tradition of retelling and elaborating the story in English-language literature, which was to be followed by Henryson and Shakespeare.|$|E
5|$|Super Mario Kart is also {{credited}} {{as being}} the first non-platforming game to feature multiple playable characters from the Mario franchise. As well as several sequels Nintendo has released numerous other sporting and non-sporting Mario spin-offs since Super Mario Kart; a trend in part accredited to the commercial and critical success of the game. The Mario characters have appeared in many sports games including those relating to basketball, baseball, golf, tennis and soccer. Non-sporting franchises using the Mario characters have also been created, including the Super Smash Bros. series of fighting games and the Mario Party series of board game based, party games. Mario series characters have also made cameos in games from other series such as SSX on Tour and NBA Street V3, both published by EA Sports. The genre spanning nature of the Mario series that was sparked off {{by the success of}} Super Mario Kart has been described as key to the success and longevity of the franchise; keeping fans interested despite the infrequency of traditional Mario platforming games. Following this model the Mario series has gone on to <b>become</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> selling video game franchise of all time with 193 million units sold as of January 2007, almost 40 million units ahead of second ranked franchise (Pokémon, also by Nintendo).|$|E

25|$|While fantasy has {{remained}} {{somewhat of a}} niche market, this has begun to change in recent years. The long-running series of light fantasies by Piers Anthony (Xanth) and Terry Pratchett (Discworld) regularly hit the bestseller lists from the 1980s onward. Thanks largely to J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter novels, which have <b>become</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> selling book series of all time, fantasy is becoming increasingly intertwined with mainstream fiction. The blockbuster success of several film adaptations of fantasy novels such as The Lord of the Rings and The Chronicles of Narnia has helped further this trend.|$|E

25|$|Functionally, AR NTD {{plays the}} primary role in {{regulating}} target gene transcription activation and mediating various receptor-protein and intra-receptor N-terminal and C-terminal interactions. Therefore, modulation of NTD function {{is considered an}} efficient strategy to target AR action. Among various functional domains in different nuclear receptors, NTD is the least conserved and so could maybe <b>become</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> target site for NTD antagonists to achieve AR specificity. However the structural features of the NTD are undetermined due to {{a high degree of}} flexibility in its conformation. Both biochemical and circular dichroism spectroscopy analysis suggest that AR NTD is highly disordered under native conditions, making it a difficult target for drug discovery.|$|E

He made a square deal with his employees then to sell them his furniture business. He contracted with them to make his cabinet maker’s squares and pencil blanks for payment of the shop business. Munroe in turn then produced the unique graphite paste for his pencils, of which only {{he and his wife}} knew the secret formula. He rented an old textile factory building and there fabricated pencils on a large scale. In 1835 alone he made over 5 million pencils.

25|$|The most {{difficult}} challenge that Gonzales faced {{during those years}} came from Lew Hoad, the very powerful young Australian who had won four Grand Slam titles as an amateur. In the 1958 tour, Gonzales and Hoad played head-to-head 87 times. Hoad won 18 of the first 27 matches and it appeared {{that he was about}} to displace Gonzales as the best in the world. Gonzales, however, revamped and improved his backhand during the course of those first matches, just as Bill Tilden had to do in 1920 in order to get the better of his rival Bill Johnston and <b>become</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> in the world. Gonzales then won 42 of the next 60 matches against Hoad and maintained his superiority by a margin of 51 wins to 36 wins for Hoad.|$|E
25|$|The {{reception}} of Horace's work has varied from one epoch {{to another and}} varied markedly even in his own lifetime. Odes 1–3 were not well received when first 'published' in Rome, yet Augustus later commissioned a ceremonial ode for the Centennial Games in 17 BC and also encouraged the publication of Odes 4, after which Horace's reputation as Rome's premier lyricist was assured. His Odes were to <b>become</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> received of all his poems in ancient times, acquiring a classic status that discouraged imitation: no other poet produced a comparable body of lyrics in the four centuries that followed (though that might also be attributed to social causes, particularly the parasitism that Italy was sinking into). In {{the seventeenth and eighteenth}} centuries, ode-writing became highly fashionable in England and a large number of aspiring poets imitated Horace both in English and in Latin.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, Bopara {{turned down}} £100,000 {{to play for}} the Delhi Daredevils in the IPL as a late {{replacement}} for the injured Paul Collingwood. After Collingwood retired from Tests, Bopara and Morgan were the leading contenders to take his place in the side. Bopara, who had already scored two centuries in the County Championship by May, was the favourite but an innings of 193 by Morgan for the England Lions against the touring Sri Lankans kept Bopara out of the Test side. After missing out on the series against Sri Lanka, he returned to the team in August for the third Test against India in place of the injured Trott. However, he could only manage 7 runs despite big scores from England's other batsmen. He kept his place for the next match, this time performing better with an unbeaten 44 as England {{went on to win the}} series 4–0 and <b>become</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> Test Team in the World.|$|E
