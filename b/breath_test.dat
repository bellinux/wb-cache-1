5|$|Angle {{was arrested}} on September 4, 2011, by Virginia State Troopers for {{allegedly}} driving under the influence. Angle was placed in Warren County Jail, before posting $2,000 bail and being released in the early morning. State police revealed that Angle's initial <b>breath</b> <b>test</b> at the scene, where he was stopped by police, showed a blood-alcohol concentration of 0.091 percent, which was above the legal limit of 0.08 percent. The test was later ruled not admissible and when a second test, taken at the police station, showed a blood-alcohol concentration of 0.06, the DUI charge was dropped. Angle was still charged with reckless driving. On November 8, 2011, Angle entered a plea of no contest and was fined $1,500.|$|E
5|$|Colonization with H. pylori is not {{a disease}} in and of itself, but a {{condition}} associated {{with a number of}} disorders of the upper gastrointestinal tract. Testing for H. pylori is recommended if peptic ulcer disease or low-grade gastric MALT lymphoma is present, after endoscopic resection of early gastric cancer, first-degree relatives with gastric cancer, and in certain cases of dyspepsia, not routinely. Several ways of testing exist. One can test noninvasively for H. pylori infection with a blood antibody test, stool antigen test, or with the carbon urea <b>breath</b> <b>test</b> (in which the patient drinks 14C—or 13C-labelled urea, which the bacterium metabolizes, producing labelled carbon dioxide that can be detected in the breath). Also, a urine ELISA test with a 96% sensitivity and 79% specificity is available. None of the test methods is completely failsafe. Even biopsy is dependent on the location of the biopsy. Blood antibody tests, for example, range from 76% to 84% sensitivity. Some drugs can affect H. pylori urease activity and give false negatives with the urea-based tests. The most accurate method for detecting H. pylori infection is with a histological examination from two sites after endoscopic biopsy, combined with either a rapid urease test or microbial culture.|$|E
25|$|In addition, {{the show}} noted that breath tests are often {{verified}} with blood tests (BAC, {{which are more}} accurate) and that even if a person somehow managed to fool a <b>breath</b> <b>test,</b> a blood test would certainly confirm a person's guilt.

40|$|BACKGROUND: (13) Carbon urea <b>breath</b> <b>testing</b> is {{reliable}} {{to detect}} current infection with Helicobacter pylori {{but has been}} reported to be of limited value in selected patients with atrophic body gastritis or acid-lowering medication. AIM: To evaluate the accuracy of (13) carbon urea <b>breath</b> <b>testing</b> for H. pylori detection in 20 asymptomatic patients with histologically confirmed atrophic body gastritis in a primary care setting. METHODS: (13) Carbon urea <b>breath</b> <b>testing</b> and serology were compared with H. pylori culture of a corpus biopsy as reference test. RESULTS: All tests were in agreement in 12 patients, being all positive in six and all negative in six. One patient was positive for serology and culture but negative for (13) carbon urea <b>breath</b> <b>testing,</b> five patients had only positive serology and two patients had only positive (13) carbon urea <b>breath</b> <b>testing.</b> (13) Carbon urea <b>breath</b> <b>testing</b> showed an accuracy with culture of 85 % and anti-H. pylori serology with culture of 75 %. (13) Carbon urea <b>breath</b> <b>testing</b> carried out in patients with positive serology showed an accuracy of 92 %. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis of (13) carbon urea <b>breath</b> <b>testing</b> shows optimal discrimination at the prescribed cut-off value. CONCLUSIONS: (13) Carbon urea <b>breath</b> <b>testing</b> can be used as diagnostic H. pylori test in asymptomatic patients with atrophic body gastritis, preferably in addition to serology, to select subjects for anti-H. pylori therap...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{introduction}} of random <b>breath</b> <b>testing</b> in Finland in 1977 the drinking and driving rate has halved, {{and there has been}} an appreciable reduction in the rates of death and injury from road accidents associated with drinking. The results of Finnish studies indicate that random <b>breath</b> <b>testing</b> deters social drinkers and detects problem drinkers.

5000|$|The Court {{ruled in}} favor of Birchfield and Beylund and against Bernard. The Court held that both <b>breath</b> <b>tests</b> and blood tests {{constitute}} a search under the Fourth Amendment. The Court then proceeded to analyze both types of tests under the search incident to arrest doctrine, weighing on the one hand [...] "the degree to which it intrudes upon an individual’s privacy" [...] {{and on the other hand}} [...] "the degree to which it is needed for the promotion of legitimate governmental interests." [...] Applied to <b>breath</b> <b>tests,</b> the Court concluded that <b>breath</b> <b>tests</b> do not implicate significant privacy concerns. Blood tests, on the other hand, are significantly more intrusive. Turning to the government's interest in the tests, the Court concluded that serves the very important function of providing an incentive to cooperate in alcohol testing. Weighing these interests, the Court concluded that requiring <b>breath</b> <b>tests</b> is constitutional, however, requiring blood tests is not, as the goal of traffic safety can be obtained by less invasive means (such as <b>breath</b> <b>tests).</b>|$|R

25|$|People with {{untreated}} {{celiac disease}} often present sorbitol malabsorption, {{as a result}} of the small bowel damage. Sorbitol malabsorption is an important cause for persisting symptoms in patients already on a gluten-free diet. The sorbitol hydrogen <b>breath</b> <b>test</b> has been suggested as a tool to detect celiac disease because of a strict correlation between cut-off value and intestinal lesions. Nevertheless, although it may be indicated for research purposes, it is not yet recommended as a diagnostic tool in clinical practice.|$|E
25|$|Fructose {{is absorbed}} in the small {{intestine}} without help of digestive enzymes. Even in healthy persons, however, only about 25–50g of fructose per sitting can be properly absorbed. People with fructose malabsorption absorb less than 25g per sitting. Simultaneous ingestion of fructose and sorbitol seems to increase malabsorption of fructose. Fructose {{that has not been}} adequately absorbed is fermented by intestinal bacteria producing hydrogen, carbon dioxide, methane and short-chain fatty acids. This abnormal increase in hydrogen may be detectable with the hydrogen <b>breath</b> <b>test.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{rapid and}} {{accurate}} diagnosis of active tuberculosis (TB) and its drug susceptibility remain a challenge. Phenotypic assays allow determination of antibiotic susceptibilities even if sequence {{data are not}} available or informative. We review 2 emerging diagnostic approaches, reporter phage and <b>breath</b> <b>tests,</b> both of which assay mycobacterial metabolism. The reporter phage signal, Green fluorescent protein (GFP) or b-galactosidase, indicates transcription and translation inside the recipient bacilli and its attenuation by antibiotics. Different <b>breath</b> <b>tests</b> assay, (1) exhaled antigen 85, (2) mycobacterial urease activity, and (3) detection by trained rats of disease-specific odor in sputum, have also been developed. When compared with culture, reporter phage assays shorten the time for initial diagnosis of drug susceptibility by several days. Both reporter phage and <b>breath</b> <b>tests</b> have promise as early markers to determine the efficacy of treatment. While sputum often remains smear and Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA positive early {{in the course of}} efficacious antituberculous treatment, we predict that both <b>breath</b> and phage <b>tests</b> will rapidly become negative. If this hypothesis proves correct, phage assays and <b>breath</b> <b>tests</b> could become important surrogate markers in early bactericidal activity (EBA) studies of new antibiotics.

25|$|In a {{hydrogen}} <b>breath</b> <b>test,</b> {{the most accurate}} lactose intolerance test, after an overnight fast, 25 grams of lactose (in a solution with water) are swallowed. If the lactose cannot be digested, enteric bacteria metabolize it and produce hydrogen, which, along with methane, if produced, can be detected on the patient's breath by a clinical gas chromatograph or compact solid-state detector. The test takes about 2.5 hours to complete. If the hydrogen levels in the patient's breath are high, they may have lactose intolerance. This test is not usually done on babies and very young children, because it can cause severe diarrhea.|$|E
25|$|Total {{food intake}} and {{absorbance}} rate of food will rapidly decline after gastric bypass surgery, {{and the number}} of acid-producing cells lining the stomach increases. Doctors often prescribe acid-lowering medications to counteract the high acidity levels. Many patients then experience a condition known as achlorhydria, where there is not enough acid in the stomach. As a result of the low acidity levels, patients can develop an overgrowth of bacteria. A study conducted on 43 post-operative patients revealed that almost all of the patients tested positive for a hydrogen <b>breath</b> <b>test,</b> which indicated an overgrowth of bacteria in the small intestine. Bacterial overgrowth causes the gut ecology to change and induces nausea and vomiting. Recurring nausea and vomiting eventually change the absorbance rate of food, contributing to the vitamin and nutrition deficiencies common in post-operative gastric bypass patients.|$|E
