Sitting Bull refused to surrender and in May 1877 led his band across the <b>border</b> <b>into</b> the North-West Territories, Canada. He remained in exile for four years near Wood Mountain, refusing a pardon {{and the chance to}} return. When crossing the <b>border</b> <b>into</b> Canadian territory, Sitting Bull was met by the Mounties of the region. During this meeting, James Morrow Walsh, commander of the North-West Mounted Police, explained to Sitting Bull that the Lakota were now on British soil and must obey British law. Walsh emphasized that he enforced the law equally and that every person in the territory had a right to justice. Walsh became an advocate for Sitting Bull and the two became good friends for the remainder of their lives.|$|E
