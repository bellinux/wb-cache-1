40|$|Background Point-of-care <b>blood</b> gas <b>analysis</b> is {{considered}} a standard of care in modern air ambulance operations by many professional organisations for clinical assessment and monitoring of patients. Instances where point-of-care <b>blood</b> gas <b>analysis</b> has identified clinically significant abnormalities which then led to clinical intervention are well documented and have been quantified previously in the air ambulance environment. However, results obtained from point-of-care <b>blood</b> gas <b>analysis</b> are not always required for patient care, nor do they always result in any clinical action {{on the part of}} the medical crew. Our question therefore related to the data for a Johannesburg based jet air ambulance service. Methods By means of retrospective case reviews over a one year period, we reviewed the overall frequency of utilisation of point-of-care <b>blood</b> gas <b>analysis</b> on patient transportations within a Johannesburg based jet air ambulance service. We established how often point-of-care <b>blood</b> gas <b>analysis</b> yielded abnormal findings, and how frequently abnormalities detected by point-of-care <b>blood</b> gas <b>analysis</b> resulted in clinical interventions. Results Point-of-care <b>blood</b> gas <b>analysis</b> was undertaken in 266 of 334 patients transported (79. 6...|$|R
40|$|Acid-base {{unbalance}} is {{most common}} problem in severe ill patient, especially in condition of abnormal renal function state. Acid-base unbalances are respiratory acidosis, respiratory alkalosis, metabolic acidosis, and metabolic alkalosis. Metabolic acidosis is frequently appeared in clinical state. Arterial <b>blood</b> gas <b>analysis</b> is {{considered as a}} basic test to {{the intensive care unit}} patient and emergency state. Recently some researches were done, comparing with arterial <b>blood</b> gas <b>analysis</b> and venous <b>blood</b> gas <b>analysis.</b> Because of venous blood sampling is safer than arterial <b>blood</b> gas <b>analysis,</b> and beside not so different among them for detecting pH, pCO 2, HCO 3, except pO 2 measuring. This research was done in emergency room, and for explaining no different between arterial <b>blood</b> gas <b>analysis</b> and peripheral <b>blood</b> gas <b>analysis</b> result in acid-base unbalance state patient. Especially in kidney functions decreased state. : The study was done from March, 2010 to January, 2011. The object was 89 peoples who came to emergency room for treating internal medicine problem. (Women 53, average age: 66. 7 ± 12. 1) Then compare between arterial <b>blood</b> gas <b>analysis</b> and peripheral <b>blood</b> gas <b>analysis.</b> Result: The mean arterial minus venous difference for pH, pCO 2, and bicarbonate was − 0. 0170, 2. 6528, and 0. 6124. Bland-Altman plot was done for predicting agreement of two groups, and the scale was pH − 2. 95 to 4. 17, pCO 2 − 4. 45 to 9. 76, bicarbonate − 2. 95 to 4. 16, in 95 % relative.

500|$|McConnell's work {{mainly focused}} on poison and <b>blood</b> <b>analysis,</b> and she testified in many {{criminal}} cases {{as an expert}} witness. Her work often involved determining {{the cause of death}} when poisoning was suspected. In 1930, she investigated the death of a ten-year-old Denver girl; the case was referred to at the time as the city's [...] "most famous and controversial murder case". Although she initially suspected the girl had been poisoned, McConnell discovered crushed glass in the girl's stomach and blood stains in the family car; her testimony led to the sentencing of the girl's stepmother for murder. In 1936, McConnell testified against suspected rapist and murderer Joe Arridy after finding fibers from the bedspread at the murder scene under the suspect's fingernails. (Although Arridy was convicted of murder and executed in 1939, he was granted a posthumous pardon in 2011.) McConnell also discovered that murder victim Georg Obendoerfer had been killed with a lethal dose of arsenic, which led to further investigations confirming that Anna Marie Hahn had killed Obendoerfer, as well as other men in the same way. McConnell testified at Hahn's trial in Cincinnati and Hahn was subsequently convicted and executed. After she was called to Raton, New Mexico as a key witness in a murder trial in 1935, a court reporter for the Raton Range wrote that McConnell [...] "has gained a national reputation ... in her <b>blood</b> <b>analysis</b> work". Additionally, she is thought to be the United States' first female forensic pathologist. Despite working on numerous high-profile, widely publicized cases, McConnell kept her life as private as possible and only ever gave one interview during her career.|$|E

40|$|This study {{includes}} 61 patients referred with {{pulmonary embolism}} (PE) during 1 year. At admission, <b>blood</b> gas <b>analysis,</b> chest radiography and pulmonary lung scan were obtained in each patient; in {{a subset of}} patients pulmonary angiography was also performed to make the definitive diagnosis. Patients were treated with heparin and, later, with oral anticoagulants. <b>Blood</b> gas <b>analysis,</b> chest radiograph and perfusion lung scan were repeated 7, 30, 180 and 365 days after the diagnosis to evaluate the usefulness of these techniques in the follow-up of PE. Arterial hypoxemia and perfusion impairment recovered in parallel, both in the acute phase after embolism (7 days) and later up to 1 year. The great majority of recovery occurred within the first month after embolization. Radiographic signs compatible with PE tended to decrease early and disappeared almost completely after 30 days.

In conclusion, <b>blood</b> gas <b>analysis</b> and chest radiograph may be employed with or without perfusion lung scan to follow patients with PE up to 1 month after embolization; after that, only <b>blood</b> gas <b>analysis</b> and perfusion lung scan may give useful information about recovery from or recurrence of PE...|$|R
