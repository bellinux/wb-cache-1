Since PHP 4, the PHP parser compiles input to produce bytecode for processing by the Zend Engine, giving improved performance over its interpreter predecessor.|$|E

Sequential changes {{in the direction of}} magnetization represent <b>binary</b> <b>data</b> bits. The data is read from the disk by detecting the transitions in magnetization. User data is encoded using an encoding scheme, such as run-length limited encoding, which determines how the data is represented by the magnetic transitions.|$|E
25|$|The {{machine was}} not {{intended}} to be a practical computer but was instead designed as a testbed for the Williams tube, the first random-access digital storage device. Invented by Freddie Williams and Tom Kilburn at the University of Manchester in 1946 and 1947, it was a cathode ray tube that used an effect called secondary emission to temporarily store electronic <b>binary</b> <b>data,</b> and was used successfully in several early computers.|$|E
25|$|After {{detailed}} {{forensic analysis}} of the FDR data, the flight control primary computer (FCPC) software and the air data inertial reference unit (ADIRU), {{it was determined that}} the CPU of the ADIRU corrupted the angle of attack (AOA) data. The exact nature was that the ADIRU CPU erroneously relabelled the altitude data word so that the <b>binary</b> <b>data</b> that represented 37,012 (the altitude {{at the time of the}} incident) would represent an angle of attack of 50.625 degrees. The FCPC then processed the erroneously high AOA data, triggering the high-AOA protection mode, which sent a command to the electrical flight control system (EFCS) to pitch the nose down.|$|E

This paper investigates some useful familial dependence structures and proposes analyzing <b>binary</b> familial <b>data</b> usingGaussian copula model. Advantages of this approach are discussed aswell as some computational details. An numerical example is also presented with an aim to show the capability of Gaussian copula model in more sophisticated data analysis...|$|R
25|$|The {{pits and}} lands do not {{directly}} represent the zeros and ones of <b>binary</b> <b>data.</b> Instead, non-return-to-zero, inverted encoding is used: {{a change from}} pit to land or land to pit indicates a one, while no change indicates a series of zeros. There {{must be at least}} two and no more than ten zeros between each one, which is defined by the length of the pit. This in turn is decoded by reversing the eight-to-fourteen modulation used in mastering the disc, and then reversing the cross-interleaved Reed–Solomon coding, finally revealing the raw data stored on the disc. These encoding techniques (defined in the Red Book) were originally designed for CD Digital Audio, but they later became a standard for almost all CD formats (such as CD-ROM).|$|E
25|$|In December 1946, Stockport-born Frederic Calland Williams {{returned}} to Manchester {{to head the}} Electrical Engineering department at the Victoria University of Manchester. Williams also recruited Tom Kilburn, with whom he worked with at the Telecommunications Research Establishment during World War II. Both worked on perfecting the cathode ray tube which Kilburn worked on. They eventually {{came up with the}} Williams tube, which allowed the storage of <b>binary</b> <b>data.</b> Consequently both worked on the Manchester Small-Scale Experimental Machine, nicknamed the 'Manchester Baby' and on the 21 June 1948, the Machine was switched on. Despite its low performance by modern standards - the 'baby' only had a 32-bit word length and a memory of 32 words - it was the first computer capable of storing data in the world and was breakthrough in the computer science world.|$|E

Jet 3.0 also allowed for database replication.|$|E
