Underneath the new <b>body</b> <b>material</b> were standard components from Chevrolet's regular car line, including the [...] "Blue Flame" [...] inline six-cylinder engine, two-speed Powerglide automatic transmission, and drum brakes. The engine's output, , was increased however from a Carter triple-carburetor system exclusive to the Corvette, but performance of the car was decidedly [...] "lackluster". Compared to the British and Italian sports cars of the day, the Corvette lacked a manual transmission and required more effort to bring to a stop, but like their British competition, such as Morgan, was not fitted with roll-up windows; this {{would have to wait}} until sometime in the 1956 model year. A Paxton centrifugal supercharger became available in 1954 as a dealer-installed option, greatly improving the Corvette's straight-line performance, but sales continued to decline.|$|E
2500|$|In a rare {{manuscript}} from Kashan {{compiled by}} Abulqassim in 1301, {{there is a}} complete description of how faience production was carried out. [...] Frit was made of ten parts of powdered quartz, one part of clay and one part of glaze mixture. The addition of greater amounts of clay made wheel throwing of the faience easier, and allowed {{a better quality of}} work, because otherwise the material had little plasticity. [...] The glaze itself is “formed of a roughly equal mixture of ground quartz and the ashes of desert plants which contain a very high proportion of alkaline salts. [...] These act as a flux and cause the quartz to vitrify at a manageable temperature. [...] The two alone will produce a transparent glaze”. Lane compared this material with the French pâte tender, which was used by potters as recently as the eighteenth century. [...] This <b>body</b> <b>material</b> and the new glaze offered the potter a greater handling and manipulation ability. [...] This allows the potter to improve the quality and appearance of the vessel, including more refined decorative designs and patterns. The result was a substantial variety of products such as bowls of different size and shapes, jugs, incense burners, lamps, candlesticks, trays, tiles and so on. [...] These advantages also allowed greater control of carved decoration, the use of which the Seljuks refined and extended during the twelfth century.|$|E

40|$|Transfers {{of human}} <b>body</b> <b>materials</b> are ubiquitous. From {{surrogacy}} arrangements, to sales of eggs, sperm and plasma to clinics, to black markets for kidneys, to pleas for donations of <b>body</b> <b>materials,</b> these transfers are covered and debated daily in popular and academic discourse. The associated philosophical {{and legal issues}} have been explored by {{a wide range of}} commentators. The appropriate tax treatment of these transactions, however, is mostly unexamined. Current law is unclear about what the tax consequences of these transfers are. There are no statutory provisions directly on point, Internal Revenue Service guidance is outdated and conflicting, and the small number of judicial decisions in this area are narrowly written to resolve only the tax liability of the particular taxpayer before the court. Moreover, {{there are only a few}} academic publications on this topic, of which the most comprehensive is a 1973 student note. This lack of legal clarity reflects in part the complexity of the issues involved. Transfers of human <b>body</b> <b>materials</b> raise questions as to the appropriate tax treatment across multiple federal tax regimes, each of which is governed by a distinct set of rules and informed by different considerations of tax policy and history. Moreover, these tax issues are arising in the context of evolving jurisprudence involving human bodies more generally, and they implicate complex philosophical problems. Of particular significance in this debate is whether human bodies can only provide services, or if their materials can constitute property of the person from whose body they come: whether the human body is exclusively a laborer, or if it can also be a factory or a collection of spare parts. What is more, the technology that has enabled these transfers continues to evolve rapidly, increasing the demand for human <b>body</b> <b>materials</b> and creating new markets for which no well-defined regulatory frameworks exist. In this Article, I offer a comprehensive methodology for handling the taxation of transfers of human <b>body</b> <b>materials.</b> To this end, I offer three principles for characterizing human <b>body</b> <b>materials</b> for tax purposes. This approach produces a workable set of doctrines that is consonant with our broader cultural and legal understandings, which I then apply to recurring forms of transfers of human <b>body</b> <b>materials</b> to illustrate the resulting tax treatment of these transfers...|$|R

[...] Other saxophones made of high copper alloys are sold under the brands Chateau, Kessler, Saxgourmet, and Bauhaus Walstein. [...] Yanagisawa and other manufacturers, starting with the King Super 20 around 1950, have made saxophone necks, bells, or entire instruments from sterling silver. Keilwerth and P.
