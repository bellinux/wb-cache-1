5|$|A more {{indirect}} effect would <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> contracted s and p1/2 orbitals shield (take on themselves) {{the charge of}} the nucleus more effectively, leaving even less for the outer d and f electrons, which therefore move on larger orbitals. Dubnium is greatly affected by this: unlike the previous group 5 members, its 7s electrons {{are more difficult to}} extract from an atom than the 6d electrons, though these energy levels remain close to each other.|$|E
5|$|A {{possible}} {{reason for the}} willingness of the Franks to connect themselves with the Kentish court is the fact that a Frankish king, Chilperic I, is recorded as having conquered a people known as the Euthiones during the mid-sixth century. If, as seems likely from the name, these people were the continental remnants of the Jutish invaders of Kent, then it may <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> marriage was intended as a unifying political move, reconnecting different branches of the same people. Another perspective on the marriage may be gained by considering that it is likely that Æthelberht was not yet king at the time he and Bertha were wed: it may be that Frankish support for him, acquired via the marriage, was instrumental in gaining the throne for him.|$|E
5|$|Although plague was known, it {{was still}} {{sufficiently}} uncommon that medical practitioners might have had no personal experience of seeing the disease; medical training varied from those who had attended the college of physicians, to apothecaries who also acted as modern doctors, to simple charlatans. Other diseases abounded, such as an outbreak of smallpox the year before, and these uncertainties all added to difficulties identifying the true start of the epidemic. Contemporary accounts suggest cases of plague occurred through the winter of 1664/5, {{some of which were}} fatal but a number of which did not display the virulence of the later epidemic. The winter was cold, the ground frozen from December to March, river traffic on the Thames twice blocked by ice, and it may <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> cold weather held back its spread.|$|E

5|$|An {{explanation}} {{put forward}} by the Russian Government appeared to <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> deaths of Litvinenko and Politkovskaya were intended to embarrass President Putin.

5|$|At {{some point}} after leaving Switzerland and {{arriving}} in England, Rossier {{was commissioned by}} the firm of Negretti and Zambra to travel to China to photograph the Second Opium War (18581860).

Taking into account the high costs and uncertainty incurred by the firm and the potential hazards for Rossier himself, this was an important commission.|$|E
5|$|Bede is {{somewhat}} reticent about {{the career of}} Wilfrid, a contemporary {{and one of the}} most prominent clerics of his day.

40|$|A {{generalized}} gradient projection filter algorithm for inequality constrained optimization is presented.

5|$|Evaluative {{conditioning}} {{suggests that}} if the name is liked then the name letters will be liked too. This would occur through repeated visual association of the name letters with the name. Martin and Levey defined evaluative conditioning as a variation of classical conditioning in which we come to like or dislike something through an association. Given the observation that our own name stands out among others as quite an attractive stimulus, as Cherry found in the cocktail party effect, it could <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> name-letter effect results from evaluative conditioning. Feys set up a controlled study with Flemish subjects, pairing unfamiliar symbols (Japanese kanji) with subjects' own names, and with other names. He {{found that there was}} no difference in how much subjects liked the kanji symbol representing their own name or other names. He concluded that evaluative conditioning is not the primary cause of the name-letter effect.|$|E
5|$|Excluding a few {{controversial}} claims, scientists {{agree that}} all non-avian dinosaurs became extinct at the K–Pg boundary. The dinosaur fossil record {{has been interpreted}} to show both a decline in diversity and no decline in diversity {{during the last few}} million years of the Cretaceous, and it may <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> quality of the dinosaur fossil record is simply not good enough to permit researchers to distinguish between the options. There is no evidence that late Maastrichtian non-avian dinosaurs could burrow, swim, or dive, which suggests they were unable to shelter themselves from the worst parts of any environmental stress that occurred at the K–Pg boundary. It is possible that small dinosaurs (other than birds) did survive, but they would have been deprived of food, as herbivorous dinosaurs would have found plant material scarce and carnivores would have quickly found prey in short supply.|$|E
5|$|Fodor {{starts with}} some criticisms of {{so-called}} standard realism. This view is characterized, according to Fodor, by two distinct assertions. One of these regards the internal structure of mental states and asserts that such states are non-relational. The other concerns the semantic theory of mental content and asserts {{that there is}} an isomorphism between the causal roles of such contents and the inferential web of beliefs. Among modern philosophers of mind, the majority view seems to <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> first of these two assertions is false, but that the second is true. Fodor departs from this view in accepting the truth of the first thesis but rejecting strongly the truth of the second.|$|E
30|$|However, VCO 2 -based {{calorimetry}} has two methodological challenges. <b>The</b> first <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> method {{requires a}} choice of RQ to be made, and <b>the</b> second <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> accuracy of the estimation is affected by instant variability in measurements of MV and VCO 2.|$|R
50|$|A police lineup is {{a method}} for an {{eyewitness}} to identify a perpetrator by viewing a series of photos, or a live group of suspects. One possible outcome of a lineup <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> eyewitness can correctly identify the criminal. Another outcome <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> eyewitness can correctly state <b>that</b> <b>the</b> criminal <b>is</b> not in the lineup. A third option <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> eyewitness can fail to recognize <b>that</b> <b>the</b> culprit <b>is</b> present. Lastly, the eyewitness can incorrectly select another suspect. The ideal result is to correctly identify the offender, and the worst outcome is to mistakenly identify an innocent.|$|R

5|$|In 2017, Douglas Stenton, {{director}} for heritage in the Nunavut territory in north eastern Canada, suggested that {{four sets of}} European human remains found could possibly be women. He initially suspected that DNA testing would not offer up anything more, but to his surprise they registered {{that there was no}} 'Y' chromosomal element to the DNA. Stenton acknowledged that women were known to have served in the Royal Navy in the 17th, 18th and early 19th centuries, but he also pointed out that it could <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> DNA had simply degraded as further tests proved ambiguous. Stenton also stated that whilst the probability of four disguised women aboard the two ships was very, very low; he could not rule it out completely.|$|E
5|$|Menkauhor Kaiu built {{a pyramid}} in North-Saqqara, thereby abandoning the royal {{necropolis}} of Abusir, where kings of the Fifth Dynasty {{had been buried}} since the reign of Sahure, some 80 years earlier.

5|$|Orcadian {{folklore}} had {{a strong}} Scandinavian influence, and it may <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> nuckelavee is a composite of a water horse from Celtic mythology and a creature imported by the Norsemen.

2500|$|Another {{complication}} of AC circuits <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> resistance and conductance can be frequency-dependent.

5|$|So {{long as we}} exclude one community, {{we cannot}} as a {{political}} {{speak on behalf of}} or claim to represent all the people of our presidency.

What objection can there be to admit such Brahmins as are willing to subscribe to the aims and objects of our Federation?

5|$|Stephen Phillips {{places the}} early Upanishads in the 800 to 300 BCE range.

5|$|The 260-day tzolk'in {{provided}} the basic cycle of Maya ceremony, and {{the foundations of}} Maya prophecy.

This is reinforced by the use of the tzolk'in to record dates of birth, and provide corresponding prophecy.

40|$|It <b>was</b> {{observed}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> p-mode power <b>is</b> substantially suppressed in magnetic regions.

5|$|The {{consequences}} of Ellandun {{went beyond the}} immediate loss of Mercian power in the southeast. According to the Chronicle, the East Anglians asked for Ecgberht's protection against the Mercians in the same year, 825, though it may actually {{have been in the}} following year that the request was made. In 826 Beornwulf invaded East Anglia, presumably to recover his overlordship. He was slain, however, as was his successor, Ludeca, who invaded East Anglia in 827, evidently for the same reason. It may <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Mercians were hoping for support from Kent: there was some reason to suppose that Wulfred, the Archbishop of Canterbury, might be discontented with West Saxon rule, as Ecgberht had terminated Wulfred's currency and had begun to mint his own, at Rochester and Canterbury, and it is known that Ecgberht seized property belonging to Canterbury. The outcome in East Anglia was a disaster for the Mercians which confirmed West Saxon power in the southeast.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} written by Jennifer Crittenden. She came into the writers' room and pitched {{the idea that there}} should be a teachers' strike in an episode.

Despite the title of the episode, at no point does the PTA (Parent-Teacher Association) actually disband. The title was suggested by Mirkin and was intended to poke fun at Crittenden, who thought the most exciting part of the teachers going on strike would <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> PTA might disband. In addition to this, Mirkin added a character to the episode who, on thinking the PTA has disbanded, jumps panicking out of a window. He jumps back in the same window when he is told the PTA has not disbanded.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea that}} this {{gathering}} agreed to uphold Irish laws governing the church has suggested {{that it was an}} important step in the gaelicisation of the lands east of Druim Alban.

Alternatively, if Bishop Cellach was appointed by Giric, it may <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> gathering was intended to heal a rift between king and church.|$|E
