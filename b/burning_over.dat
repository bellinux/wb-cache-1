2500|$|Suhrawardy {{became the}} Deputy Mayor of the Calcutta Corporation {{at the age}} of 31 in 1924, and the Deputy Leader of the Swaraj Party in the Provincial Assembly. However, {{following}} the death of Chittaranjan Das in 1925, he began to disassociate himself with the Swaraj Party and eventually joined Muslim League. He served as Minister of Labour, and Minister of Civil Supplies under Khawaja Nazimuddin among other positions. He was the Minister responsible during the Midnapore (Bengal) famine of 1943, but did little to relieve it. Madhushree Mukherjee's 2010 book, [...] "Churchill's secret War" [...] places the responsibility mainly on Churchill, then wartime premier of Britain for actively blocking relief to Bengal, even when the Americans offered it in their ships, in the context of Churchill's [...] unceasing refrain of a [...] "scarcity of shipping" [...] in the Atlantic. (The alleged scarcity is seriously questioned by Mukherjee based on documents available recently). Suhrawardy's government [...] did implement British scorched earth policies designed [...] to counter Japanese invasion threats, policies like <b>burning</b> <b>over</b> a thousand fishing boats to block any potential movement of invading troops. These measures aggravated starvation and famine. Relief, it was said, [...] only arrived after Wavell became Viceroy, who used the Indian Army to organise relief. However, by that time, the winter crop had arrived and famine conditions had already eased, after millions had earlier perished. In the Bengal Muslim League, Suhrawardy and Abul Hashim led a progressive line against the conservative stream led by Nazimuddin and Akram Khan.|$|E

This might be the inn at last. I hastened on: my knees now trembled under me: I was getting quite exhausted.|$|E

[...] "Being on this ship seems {{to make it so}} much more vivid--what it really means to be English. One thinks of all we've done, and our navies, and the people in India and Africa, and how we've gone on century after century, sending out boys from little country villages--and of men like you, Dick, and it makes one feel as if one couldn't bear not to be English! Think of the light <b>burning</b> <b>over</b> the House, Dick! When I stood on deck just now I seemed to see it. It's what one means by London." ...|$|E
60|$|I paced a turn {{or two on}} the poop and saw {{him take}} up his {{position}} face forward with his elbow in the ratlines of the mizzen rigging before I went below. The mate's faint snoring was still going on peacefully. The cuddy lamp was <b>burning</b> <b>over</b> the table on which stood a vase with flowers, a polite attention from the ship's provision merchant--the last flowers we should see {{for the next three}} months at the very least. Two bunches of bananas hung from the beam symmetrically, one {{on each side of the}} rudder casing. Everything was as before in the ship--except that two of her captain's sleeping suits were simultaneously in use, one motionless in the cuddy, the other keeping very still in the captain's stateroom.|$|E
60|$|At last {{we stood}} under {{a dark and}} miserable covered way, where one lamp was <b>burning</b> <b>over</b> an iron gate and where the morning faintly {{struggled}} in. The gate was closed. Beyond it was a burial ground--a dreadful spot in which the night was very slowly stirring, but where I could dimly see heaps of dishonoured graves and stones, hemmed in by filthy houses with a few dull lights in their windows and on whose walls a thick humidity broke out like a disease. On the step at the gate, drenched in the fearful wet of such a place, which oozed and splashed down everywhere, I saw, with a cry of pity and horror, a woman lying--Jenny, {{the mother of the}} dead child.|$|E

60|$|And tittering, {{they passed}} by the brother and sister, who were still unseen, but Robert heaved a sigh and murmured, 'Miserable work!' {{somewhat}} to his sister's surprise, for to her the great ill-regulated household was an unquestioned institution, {{and she did not}} expect him to bestow so much compassion on Augusta's discarded bonnet. At {{the top of the steps}} they opened a door, and entered a great wide hall. All was exceedingly still. A gas-light was <b>burning</b> <b>over</b> the fire-place, but the corners were in gloom, and the coats and cloaks looked like human figures in the distance. Phoebe waited while Robert lighted her candle for her. Albeit she was not nervous, she started when a door was sharply pushed open, and another figure appeared; but it was nothing worse than her brother Mervyn, in easy costume, and redolent of tobacco.|$|E
6000|$|... "In {{a compact}} mass the {{gigantic}} savages rushed upon our hero, shrieking with rage and brandishing their huge clubs. Ned {{stood his ground}} fearlessly, his back to a banana tree. With a sweep of his cutlass he severed {{the head of the}} leading savage from his body, while with a back stroke of his dirk he stabbed another to the heart. But resistance against such odds was vain. By sheer weight of numbers, Ned was borne to the ground. His arms were then pinioned with stout ropes made of the fibres of the boobooda tree. With shrieks of exultation the savages dragged our hero to an opening in the woods where a huge fire was <b>burning,</b> <b>over</b> which was suspended an enormous caldron of bubbling oil. 'Boil him, boil him,' yelled the savages, now wrought to the point of frenzy." ...|$|E

I {{had been in}} attendance all day yesterday on a case of singularly interesting and critical character; the disease being rare, and its treatment doubtful: I saw a similar and still finer case in a hospital in Paris; but that will not interest you. At last a mitigation of the patient's most urgent symptoms (acute pain {{is one of its}} accompaniments) liberated me, and I set out homeward. My shortest way lay through the Basse-Ville, and as the night was excessively dark, wild, and wet, I took it. In riding past an old church belonging to a community of Béguines, I saw by a lamp <b>burning</b> <b>over</b> the porch or deep arch of the entrance, a priest lifting some object in his arms. The lamp was bright enough to reveal the priest's features clearly, and I recognised him; he was a man I have often met by the sick beds of both rich and poor: and chiefly the latter. He is, I think, a good old man, far better than most of his class in this country; superior, indeed, in every way, better informed, as well as more devoted to duty. Our eyes met; he called on me to stop: what he supported was a woman, fainting or dying. I alighted.|$|E

60|$|And {{there he}} found all the wise people instructing mankind {{in the science}} of spirit-rapping, while their house was <b>burning</b> <b>over</b> their heads: and when Tom told them of the fire, they held an indignation meeting forthwith, and {{unanimously}} determined to hang Tom's dog for coming into their country with gunpowder in his mouth. Tom couldn't help saying that though they did fancy they had carried all the wit away with them out of Lincolnshire two hundred years ago, yet if they had had one such Lincolnshire nobleman among them as good old Lord Yarborough, he would have called for the fire-engines before he hanged other people's dogs. But it was of no use, and the dog was hanged: and Tom couldn't even have his carcase; for they had abolished the have-his-carcase act in that country, for fear lest when rogues fell out, honest men should come by their own. And so they would have succeeded perfectly, as they always do, only that (as they also always do) they failed in one little particular, viz. that the dog would not die, being a water-dog, but bit their fingers so abominably that {{they were forced to}} let him go, and Tom likewise, as British subjects. Whereon they recommenced rapping for the spirits of their fathers; and very much astonished the poor old spirits were when they came, and saw how, according to the laws of Mrs. Bedonebyasyoudid, their descendants had weakened their constitution by hard living.|$|E
