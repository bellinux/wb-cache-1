40|$|WOSInternational audienceThe aim of {{this work}} is to model the {{interaction}} of L-band electromagnetic waves with coastal <b>breaking</b> <b>sea</b> waves. The <b>breaking</b> <b>sea</b> waves' proles are generated using the Desingularized Technique and the electromagnetic waves scattering are computed using the High-Order Method of Moments (HO-MoM) combined with Non Uniform Rational Basis Spline (NURBS) geometry. Our study mainly focuses upon the electromagnetic waves behavior in the crest and the cavity of <b>breaking</b> <b>sea</b> waves...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{adaptive}} multiscale moment method (AMMM) {{was originally}} developed to solve Fredholm equation. More recently, this method has demonstrated {{to be effective}} for scattering problems. In this article, we show that AMMM is a relevant approach to model and to analyze the electromagnetic scattering by coastal <b>breaking</b> <b>sea</b> waves. The shape of breaking wave results from very nonlinear fluid mechanics and is a complex target for electromagnetic scattering. This article presents an efficient hydrodynamic model and, combined with AMMM, a global realistic numerical simulation of the electromagnetic signature induced by <b>breaking</b> <b>sea</b> waves...|$|R

60|$|At first {{all went}} well. He was borne up the seas; he {{slid down the}} seas in a lather of white foam. Presently {{the rise and fall}} grew steeper, and the foam began to break over his head. Robert could no longer guide himself; he must go as he was carried. Then in an instant he was carried into a hell of waters where, {{had it not been for}} his lifebelt and the plank, he must have been beaten down and have perished. As it was, now he was driven into the depths, and now he emerged upon their surface to hear their seething hiss around him, and above it all a {{continuous}} boom as of great guns--the boom of the <b>breaking</b> <b>seas.</b>|$|E
60|$|He had no {{passengers}} {{and it was}} blowing fresh with showers of sleet. Savage gusts whipped the leaden water into frothing white, and as he drew out from the shore the ripples which chased the launch grew larger. When he passed a headland they changed into short, <b>breaking</b> <b>seas,</b> and the craft plunged wildly as she crossed a strong run of tide. Here and there an island loomed up dimly, but the shore had faded into the haze. When Jimmy first joined her, the boat had carried another hand, but the man had gone and had not been replaced because trade was slack in winter. Jimmy thought {{that he might have}} trouble in getting his passengers on board; but they were not likely to be numerous, and the steamer would run into shelter behind an island.|$|E

60|$|I can say, {{that up to}} this instant, I had {{not even}} looked for Marble. So intense had been my apprehensions of missing the wreck, that I thought of nothing else, could see nothing else. Satisfied, however, that my fast would hold, I ran forward to {{look down on the}} top, that the strain of the hawser had brought {{directly}} under the very bow, over which it had fallen. It was empty! The object I had mistaken for Marble, dead or asleep, {{was a part of the}} bunt of the main-top-sail, that had been hauled down over the top-rim, and secured there, either to form a sort of shelter against the <b>breaking</b> <b>seas,</b> or a bed. Whatever may have been the intention of this nest, it no longer had an occupant. Marble had probably been washed away, in one of his adventurous efforts to make himself more secure or more comfortable.|$|E
60|$|But {{when the}} gentle Mistress Sepulvida was within {{a hundred yards}} of the Point she {{expected}} to round, she saw with some chagrin that the tide was up, and that each dash of the <b>breaking</b> <b>seas</b> sent a thin, reaching film of shining water up to the very roots of the pines. To her still further discomfiture, she saw also that a smart-looking cavalier had likewise reined in his horse {{on the other side}} of the Point, and was evidently watching her movements with great interest, and, as she feared, with some amusement. To go back would be to be followed by this stranger, and to meet the cynical but respectful observation of Concho; to go forward, at the worst, could only be a slight wetting, and a canter beyond the reach of observation of the stranger, who could not in decency turn back after her. All this Donna Maria saw with the swiftness of feminine intuition, and, without apparently any hesitation in her face of her intent, dashed into the surf below the Point.|$|E
60|$|Squall after squall, {{driving wind}} and {{blinding}} rain, smote the Minota, while a heavier sea was making. The Eugenie lay at anchor five miles to windward, {{but she was}} behind a point of land and could not know of our mishap. At Captain Jansen's suggestion, I wrote a note to Captain Keller, asking him to bring extra anchors and gear to our aid. But not a canoe could be persuaded to carry the letter. I offered half a case of tobacco, but the blacks grinned and held their canoes bow-on to the <b>breaking</b> <b>seas.</b> A half a case of tobacco was worth three pounds. In two hours, even against the strong wind and sea, a man could have carried the letter and received in payment {{what he would have}} laboured half a year for on a plantation. I managed to get into a canoe and paddle out to where Mr. Caulfeild was running an anchor with his whale-boat. My idea was that he would have more influence over the natives. He called the canoes up to him, and a score of them clustered around and heard the offer of half a case of tobacco. No one spoke.|$|E

50|$|The plateau was {{produced}} by the Kerguelen hotspot, starting with or following the breakup of Gondwana about 130 million years ago.

40|$|The {{propagation}} of large, storm-generated waves through sea ice {{has so far}} not been measured, limiting our understanding of how ocean waves <b>break</b> <b>sea</b> ice. Without improved knowledge of ice breakup, we are unable to understand recent changes, or predict future changes, in Arctic and Antarctic sea ice. Here we show that storm-generated ocean waves propagating through Antarctic sea ice are able to transport enough energy to <b>break</b> <b>sea</b> ice hundreds of kilometres from the ice edge. Our results, which are based on concurrent observations at multiple locations, establish that large waves <b>break</b> <b>sea</b> ice much farther from the ice edge than would be predicted by the commonly assumed exponential decay. We observed the wave height decay to be almost linear for large waves—those with a significant wave height greater than three metres—and to be exponential only for small waves. This implies a more prominent role for large ocean waves in sea-ice breakup and retreat than previously thought. We examine the wider relevance of this by comparing observed Antarctic sea-ice edge positions with changes in modelled significant wave heights for the Southern Ocean between 1997 and 2009, and find that the retreat and expansion of the sea-ice edge correlate with mean significant wave height increases and decreases, respectively. This includes capturing the spatial variability in sea-ice trends found in the Ross and Amundsen–Bellingshausen seas. Climate models fail to capture recent changes in sea ice in both polar regions. Our results suggest that the incorporation of explicit or parameterized interactions between ocean waves and sea ice may resolve this problem...|$|R
6000|$|... “He {{did leave}} him there,” he uttered, weightily, {{returning}} to the contemplation of the wall. “Cloete didn’t mean to allow anybody, let alone a thing like Stafford, {{to stand in the}} way of his great notion of making George and himself, and Captain Harry, too, for that matter, rich men. And he didn’t think much of consequences. These patent-medicine chaps don’t care what they say or what they do. They think the world’s bound to swallow any story they like to tell. [...] . He stands listening for a bit. And it gives him quite a turn to hear a thump at the door and a sort of muffled raving screech inside the captain’s room. He thinks he hears his own name, too, through the awful crash as the old Sagamore rises and falls to a sea. That noise and that awful shock make him clear out of the cabin. He collects his senses on the poop. But his heart sinks a little at the black wildness of the night. Chances that he will get drowned himself before long. Puts his head down the companion. Through the wind and <b>breaking</b> <b>seas</b> he can hear the noise of Stafford’s beating against the door and cursing. He listens and says to himself: No. Can’t trust him now. [...] .|$|E
60|$|The {{clouds were}} all fled, {{the beauty of}} the tropic day was spread upon Papeete; and the wall of <b>breaking</b> <b>seas</b> upon the reef, and the palms upon the islet, already trembled in the heat. A French {{man-of-war}} was going out, homeward bound; she lay in the middle distance of the port, an ant-heap for activity. In the night a schooner had come in, and now lay far out, hard by the passage; and the yellow flag, the emblem of pestilence, flew on her. From up the coast, a long procession of canoes headed round the point and towards the market, bright as a scarf with the many-coloured clothing of the natives and the piles of fruit. But not even the beauty and the welcome warmth of the morning, not even these naval movements, so interesting to sailors and to idlers, could engage the attention of the outcasts. They were still cold at heart, their mouths sour from the want of sleep, their steps rambling from the lack of food; and they strung like lame geese along the beach in a disheartened silence. It was towards the town they moved; towards the town whence smoke arose, where happier folk were breakfasting; and as they went, their hungry eyes were upon all sides, but they were only scouting for a meal.|$|E
60|$|At last, {{after many}} narrow escapes from {{complete}} swamping, the fishermen got into action. All hands tailed {{on to the}} anchor and hove it up. For'ard, as the boat's head paid off, we set a patch of sail {{about the size of}} a flour-sack. And we headed straight for shore. I unlaced my shoes, unbottoned my great-coat and coat, and was ready to make a quick partial strip a minute or so before we struck. But we didn't strike, and, as we rushed in, I saw the beauty of the situation. Before us opened a narrow channel, frilled at its mouth with <b>breaking</b> <b>seas.</b> Yet, long before, when I had scanned the shore closely, there had been no such channel. I had forgotten the thirty-foot tide. And it was for this tide that the Japanese had so precariously waited. We ran the frill of breakers, curved into a tiny sheltered bay where the water was scarcely flawed by the gale, and landed on a beach where the salt sea of the last tide lay frozen in long curving lines. And this was one gale of three in the course of those eight days in the sampan. Would it have been beaten on a ship? I fear me the ship would have gone aground on the outlying reef and that its people would have been incontinently and monotonously drowned.|$|E
50|$|The southwestern {{coast of}} Finland {{also has a}} great many skerries; so many, in fact, that they form an archipelago.

The skerries exist as small rocky islands before uplift of adjacent terrain changes the classification of this landform into a tombolo.|$|R
50|$|In the {{maritime}} arena, Casimir urged Danzig {{to build a}} fleet that {{would be able to}} <b>break</b> <b>sea</b> connections between the Teutonic Order and its allies. In May 1456 privateers hired by Danzig captured Dutch ships, which caused conflict with Amsterdam and the Duke of Burgundy, Philip the Good. In two weeks in August 1457, three ships from Danzig defeated a combined Danish-Livonian fleet of 16 ships near Bornholm.|$|R

60|$|How {{he first}} {{got in touch}} with his captain's wife Powell relates in this way. It was long before his memorable {{conversation}} with the mate and shortly after getting clear of the channel. It was gloomy weather; dead head wind, blowing quite half a gale; the Ferndale under reduced sail was stretching close-hauled across the track of the homeward bound ships, just moving through the water and no more, since there was no object in pressing her and the weather looked threatening. About ten o'clock at night he was alone on the poop, in charge, keeping well aft by the weather rail and staring to windward, when amongst the white, <b>breaking</b> <b>seas,</b> under the black sky, he made out the lights of a ship. He watched them for some time. She was running dead before the wind of course. She will pass jolly close--he said to himself; and then suddenly he felt a great mistrust of that approaching ship. She's heading straight for us--he thought. It was not his business {{to get out of the}} way. On the contrary. And his uneasiness grew by the recollection of the forty tons of dynamite in the body of the Ferndale; not the sort of cargo one thinks of with equanimity in connection with a threatened collision. He gazed at the two small lights in the dark immensity filled with the angry noise of the seas. They fascinated him till their plainness to his sight gave him a conviction that there was danger there. He knew in his mind what to do in the emergency, but very properly he felt that he must call the captain out at once.|$|E
60|$|There {{are some}} bad {{nights in the}} kingdom of the West Wind for homeward-bound ships making for the Channel; and the days of wrath dawn upon them {{colourless}} and vague like the timid turning up of invisible lights upon the scene of a tyrannical and passionate outbreak, awful in the monotony of its method and the increasing strength of its violence. It is the same wind, the same clouds, the same wildly racing seas, the same thick horizon around the ship. Only the wind is stronger, the clouds seem denser and more overwhelming, the waves appear to have grown bigger and more threatening during the night. The hours, whose minutes are marked by the crash of the <b>breaking</b> <b>seas,</b> slip by with the screaming, pelting squalls overtaking the ship as she runs on and on with darkened canvas, with streaming spars and dripping ropes. The down-pours thicken. Preceding each shower a mysterious gloom, like the passage of a shadow above the firmament of gray clouds, filters down upon the ship. Now and then the rain pours upon your head in streams as if from spouts. It seems as if your ship were going to be drowned before she sank, as if all atmosphere had turned to water. You gasp, you splutter, you are blinded and deafened, you are submerged, obliterated, dissolved, annihilated, streaming all over as if your limbs, too, had turned to water. And every nerve on the alert you watch for the clearing-up mood of the Western King, that shall come with a shift of wind as likely as not to whip all the three masts out of your ship in the twinkling of an eye.|$|E
60|$|The {{third day}} of her waiting {{isolation}} was broken upon by another intrusion. The morning had been threatening, with an opaque, motionless, livid arch above, which had taken {{the place of the}} usual flying scud and shaded cloud masses of the rainy season. The whole outlying ocean, too, beyond the bar, appeared nearer, and even seemed to be lifted higher than the Bay itself, and was lit every now and then with wonderful clearness by long flashes of breaking foam like summer lightning. She knew that this meant a southwester, and began, with a certain mechanical deliberation, to set her little domain in order against the coming gale. She drove the cows to the rude shed among the scrub oaks, she collected the goats and young kids in the corral, and replenished the stock of fuel from the woodpile. She was quite hidden in the shrubbery when she saw a boat making slow headway against the wind towards the little cove where but a moment before she had drawn up the dingey beyond the reach of <b>breaking</b> <b>seas.</b> It was a whaleboat from Saucelito containing a few men. As they neared the landing she recognized in the man who seemed to be directing the boat the second friend of Colonel Marion--the man who had come with the Secretary to take him off, but whom she had never seen again. In her present horror of that memory she remained hidden, determined at all hazards to avoid a meeting. When they had landed, one of the men halted accidentally before the shrubbery where she was concealed as he caught his first view of the cottage, which had been invisible from the point they had rounded.|$|E
5000|$|... "As {{there were}} no {{survivors}} of the crew, {{the cause of the}} Lifeboat capsizing is a matter of conjecture, but from the evidence available we are of the opinion that whilst attempting to make the Harbour on a strong flood tide and in high and dangerous <b>breaking</b> <b>sea,</b> she was suddenly capsized and the crew were thrown into the water, two men being entangled under the boat. The broken water and heavy surf caused the loss of the crew".|$|R
6000|$|Meantime, {{from the}} {{beginning}} all this had been descried from the ship's mast heads; and squaring her yards, she had borne down upon the scene; and was now so nigh, that Ahab in the water hailed her!--"Sail on the"-- but that moment a <b>breaking</b> <b>sea</b> dashed on him from Moby Dick, and whelmed him for the time. But struggling out of it again, and chancing to rise on a towering crest, he shouted,--"Sail on the whale!--Drive him off!" ...|$|R
60|$|When the Elsinore dipped her port-rail {{under and}} scooped several hundred tons of South Atlantic, and then, {{immediately}} rolling her starboard-rail under, had another hundred tons of <b>breaking</b> <b>sea</b> fall in board upon her, {{all the men}} forsook everything and scrambled for life upon the fife-rail. In the bursting spray they were quite hidden; and then I saw them and counted them all as they emerged into view. Again {{they waited for the}} water to subside.|$|R
6000|$|She {{went off}} slowly {{as though she}} had been weary and disheartened like the men she carried. She paid off very gradually, making us hold our breath till we choked, and as soon as she had brought the wind abaft the beam she started to move, and fluttered our hearts. It was awful to see her, nearly overturned, begin to gather way and drag her {{submerged}} side through the water. The dead-eyes of the rigging churned the <b>breaking</b> <b>seas.</b> The lower half of the deck was full of mad whirlpools and eddies; and the long line of the lee rail could be seen showing black now and then in the swirls of a field of foam as dazzling and white as a field of snow. The wind sang shrilly amongst the spars; and at every slight lurch we expected her to slip to the bottom sideways from under our backs. When dead before it she made the first distinct attempt to stand up, and we encouraged her with a feeble and discordant howl. A great sea came running up aft and hung for a moment over us with a curling top; then crashed down under the counter and spread out on both sides into a great sheet of bursting froth. Above its fierce hiss we heard Singleton's croak:--"She is steering!" [...] He had both his feet now planted firmly on the grating, and the wheel spun fast as he eased the helm.--"Bring the wind on the port quarter and steady her!" [...] called out the master, staggering to his feet, the first man up from amongst our prostrate heap. One or two screamed with excitement:--"She rises!" [...] Far away forward, Mr. Baker and three others were seen erect and black on the clear sky, lifting their arms, and with open mouths as though they had been shouting all together. The ship trembled, trying to lift her side, lurched back, seemed to give up with a nerveless dip, and suddenly with an unexpected jerk swung violently to windward, {{as though she had}} torn herself out from a deadly grasp. The whole immense volume of water, lifted by her deck, was thrown bodily across to starboard. Loud cracks were heard. Iron ports breaking open thundered with ringing blows. The water topped over the starboard rail with the rush of a river falling over a dam. The sea on deck, and the seas on every side of her, mingled together in a deafening roar. She rolled violently. We got up and were helplessly run or flung about from side to side. Men, rolling over and over, yelled,--"The house will go!"--"She clears herself!" [...] Lifted by a towering sea she ran along with it for a moment, spouting thick streams of water through every opening of her wounded sides. The lee braces having been carried away or washed off the pins, all the ponderous yards on the fore swung from side to side and with appalling rapidity at every roll. The men forward were seen crouching here and there with fearful glances upwards at the enormous spars that whirled about over their heads. The torn canvas and the ends of broken gear streamed in the wind like wisps of hair. Through the clear sunshine, over the flashing turmoil and uproar of the seas, the ship ran blindly, dishevelled and headlong, as if fleeing for her life; and on the poop we spun, we tottered about, distracted and noisy. We all spoke at once in a thin babble; we had the aspect of invalids and the gestures of maniacs. Eyes shone, large and haggard, in smiling, meagre faces that seemed to have been dusted over with powdered chalk. We stamped, clapped our hands, feeling ready to jump and do anything; but in reality hardly able to keep on our feet.|$|E
5000|$|The coastal {{processes}} {{occurring in}} Gulf St Vincent {{and along the}} southern coastline of Fleurieu Peninsula are complex.
