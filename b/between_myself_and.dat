25|$|In the {{dedication}} page for Uglies, Westerfeld says: “This novel {{was shaped by}} a series of e-mail exchanges <b>between</b> <b>myself</b> <b>and</b> Ted Chiang about his story “Liking What You See: A Documentary.” His input on the manuscript was also invaluable.” In another interview, Westerfeld says that this documentary is about a new technology that enables an individual to turn off their ability to see beauty so they can focus on the deeper and more important parts of another individual. In a 2012 interview on Bookyurt, Westerfeld explained that his point in writing the book was not to make a big commentary on the issues with beauty, but to make people aware of the culture of retouching that is developing in the world and to be aware of our own ideas about beauty and our need to think for ourselves.|$|E
500|$|Hattner {{has said}} of his {{conducting}} style, [...] "It is generally somewhat of a collaborative process <b>between</b> <b>myself</b> <b>and</b> the musicians, having been a player myself. I'm fairly specific about what I'm asking for {{in terms of the}} tempos and the phrasing, but bits of individual expression comes from {{the hearts and minds of}} the players themselves. I don't try to micromanage every detail." [...] In addition to conducting and clarinet performance, Hattner has participated in multimedia work with silent film both nationally and internationally. He continues to perform clarinet in ensembles such as 45th Parallel, Martingale Ensemble and other projects.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the film}} {{received}} critical acclaim and several awards, Allen himself was disappointed with it, {{and said in}} an interview, [...] "When Annie Hall started out, that film {{was not supposed to}} be what I wound up with. The film was supposed to be what happens in a guy's mind... Nobody understood anything that went on. The relationship <b>between</b> <b>myself</b> <b>and</b> Diane Keaton was all anyone cared about. That was not what I cared about... In the end, I had to reduce the film to just me and Diane Keaton, and that relationship, so I was quite disappointed in that movie". Allen has repeatedly declined to make a sequel, and in a 1992 interview stated that [...] "Sequelism has become an annoying thing. [...] I don't think Francis Coppola should have done Godfather III because Godfather II was quite great. [...] When they make a sequel, it's just a thirst for more money, so I don't like that idea so much".|$|E

If {{you feel}} as if you could not keep on, call out, and we will stop directly; but first come up <b>between</b> Surajah <b>and</b> <b>myself,</b> <b>and</b> we will take the leading reins, so that you will have nothing to attend to but holding on." ...|$|R
500|$|Kierkegaard later {{referred}} to his concept of choosing yourself as the single individual in The Concept of Anxiety, June 17, 1844, and then in his , August 31, 1844, and once again in Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits, 1847. William James echoed Kierkegaard in his lecture on The Sick Soul where he wrote, [...] "the man must die to an unreal life before he can be born into the real life." [...] You are outside yourself and therefore cannot do without the other as opposition; you believe that only a restless spirit is alive, and all who are experienced believe that only a quiet spirit is truly alive. For you a turbulent sea {{is a symbol of}} life; for me it is the quiet, deep water. Either/Or Part II p. 144, HongAnxiety is a qualification of dreaming spirit, and as such it has its place in psychology. Awake, the difference <b>between</b> <b>myself</b> <b>and</b> my other is posited; sleeping, it is suspended; dreaming, it is an intimated nothing. The actuality of the spirit constantly shows itself as a form that tempts its possibility but disappears as soon as it seeks to grasp for it, and it is a nothing that can only bring anxiety. More it cannot do as long as it merely shows itself. The concept of anxiety is almost never treated in psychology. Therefore, I must point out that it is altogether different from fear and similar concepts that refer to something definite, whereas anxiety is freedom’s actuality as the possibility of possibility. For this reason, anxiety is not found in the beast, precisely because by nature the beast is not qualified as spirit. The Concept of Anxiety, Nichol p. 42 ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1945, she {{traveled}} throughout a collapsing Germany with Gen. George S. Patton. She arrived at Buchenwald, the notorious concentration camp, and later said, [...] "Using a camera was almost a relief. It interposed a slight barrier <b>between</b> <b>myself</b> <b>and</b> the horror in front of me." [...] After the war, she produced a book entitled, Dear Fatherland, Rest Quietly, a project that helped her {{come to grips with}} the brutality she had witnessed during and after the war.|$|E

We went through a long process of weighing different factors in our lives. At {{the end of the day}} it came down to priorities, with the top three priorities being serving God, serving my family and serving others." ...|$|E
2500|$|Resnais {{was often}} {{linked with the}} group of French filmmakers who made their {{breakthrough}} as the New Wave or nouvelle vague in the late 1950s, but by then he had already established a significant reputation through his ten years of work on documentary short films. He defined his own relationship by saying: [...] "Although I was not fully part of the New Wave because of my age, there was some mutual sympathy and respect <b>between</b> <b>myself</b> <b>and</b> Rivette, Bazin, Demy, Truffaut... So I felt friendly with that team." [...] He nevertheless acknowledged his debt to the New Wave because it created the conditions of production, and particularly the financial conditions, which allowed {{him to make a}} film like Hiroshima mon amour, his first feature film.|$|E
2500|$|Cold 187um's {{association}} with Insane Clown Posse was criticized by both fans of West Coast hip hop and Juggalos. Cold 187um {{responded to the}} criticism, stating [...] "The Only Solution project was an innovative good idea <b>between</b> <b>myself</b> <b>and</b> Violent J, but everyone is so damn opinionated these days and not going {{with the idea of}} the artist’s creativity, the project was harder than it needed to be. We are all independent, we are all against mainstream music, we all should have been one not separate. That goes for both Juggalos and my West Coast Hip Hop fans. We might come from different places but we are all on the same side, fighting the same fight. It’s like anything else in life, if there is no unity the real enemy will always win. End of story." ...|$|E

2500|$|Jackson's {{idea for}} [...] "Black Cat" [...] {{was based on}} a warning to a rebel {{involved}} in substance abuse, in addition to the consequences of drug addiction. Its composition compares the theme to the folklore superstitions of cats having nine lives and black cats foreshadowing a negative omen or misfortune. She also related its title to the bold nature of a panther, saying [...] "I have always felt some kind of connection <b>between</b> <b>myself</b> <b>and</b> a panther. They're not afraid of anything, they're willing to take on anything–that's the way I feel about my work." [...] Regarding its development, she said, [...] "I was getting dressed and ready to go to the studio. The television was on - some commercials and other stuff. I just started humming a melody. I don't know why and it kept sticking in my head. So I put it down on tape." [...] She later recalled Jam & Lewis saying [...] "they thought it was something that might work." [...] Jackson was heavily involved in the song's production, stating: ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1856, Semmelweis's {{assistant}} Josef Fleischer {{reported the}} successful results of hand washing activities at St. Rochus and Pest maternity {{institutions in the}} Viennese Medical Weekly (Wiener Medizinische Wochenschrift). The editor remarked sarcastically {{that it was time}} people stopped being misled about the theory of chlorine washings. Two years later, Semmelweis finally published his own account of his work in an essay entitled [...] "The Etiology of Childbed Fever". Two years later, he published a second essay, [...] "The Difference in Opinion <b>between</b> <b>Myself</b> <b>and</b> the English Physicians regarding Childbed Fever". In 1861, Semmelweis finally published his main work Die Ätiologie, der Begriff und die Prophylaxis des Kindbettfiebers (German for [...] "The Etiology, Concept and Prophylaxis of Childbed Fever"). In his 1861 book, Semmelweis lamented the slow adoption of his ideas: [...] "Most medical lecture halls continue to resound with lectures on epidemic childbed fever and with discourses against my theories. [...] In published medical works my teachings are either ignored or attacked. The medical faculty at Würzburg awarded a prize to a monograph written in 1859 in which my teachings were rejected".|$|E
2500|$|In 1988, [...] Kovel was {{appointed}} Alger Hiss Chair of Social Studies, a non-tenured position, at Bard College. In February 2009, he {{was informed that}} his position would not be renewed after the contract ended on June 20, 2009 {{and that he would}} be moved to [...] "emeritus" [...] status at that time. Kovel argued in a letter sent to the faculty of Bard College that his contract was not renewed due to his political views. He reiterated his argument in a statement posted on his official website that the [...] "termination of service is prejudicial and [...] motivated neither by intellectual nor pedagogic considerations, but by [...] political values, principally stemming from differences <b>between</b> <b>myself</b> <b>and</b> the Bard administration on the issue of Zionism". The college president, Leon Botstein, responded in a letter sent directly to Kovel by arguing that his termination was not political but part of a larger move by Bard to reduce part-time faculty. Botstein stated: [...] "To take what is self-evidently a result of economic constraint {{and turn it into a}} trumped-up case of prejudice and political victimization insults not only your intelligence but the intelligence of your readers." [...] While Kovel called his dismissal illegitimate and vowed to fight the decision, he did leave Bard permanently per the university's decision in 2009.|$|E
