5|$|Murray, Lawrence and Chauvel {{have all}} been criticised for letting von Kressenstein's force escape. Further, it has been {{asserted}} that the tactics of the mounted troops actually helped the enemy withdrawal <b>by</b> <b>concentrating</b> <b>on</b> direct assaults rather than flank attacks. The official British historian acknowledges the disappointment caused by the successful retirement of the German, Austrian and Ottoman force but he also notes {{the quality of the}} successive rearguard positions constructed during the advance, and the strength, determination and endurance of the enemy. The strength of the rearguards was clearly demonstrated at Bir el Abd on 9 August, when the mounted force attempted to outflank the large entrenched force. They failed because they were greatly outnumbered. Indeed, if the Anzac Mounted Division had succeeded in getting round the flank without infantry support, they would have been faced with vastly superior forces and could have been annihilated.|$|E

25|$|Paralleling nueva canción in Latin America is the Cuban Nueva trova, {{which dates}} from about 1967/68, after the Cuban Revolution. It {{differed}} from the traditional trova, not because the musicians were younger, but because the content was, in the widest sense, political. Nueva trova is defined by its connection with Castro's revolution, and by its lyrics, which attempt to escape the banalities of life <b>by</b> <b>concentrating</b> <b>on</b> socialism, injustice, sexism, colonialism, racism and similar issues. Silvio Rodríguez and Pablo Milanés became the most important exponents of this style. Carlos Puebla and Joseíto Fernández were long-time old trova singers who added their weight to the new regime, but of the two only Puebla wrote special pro-revolution songs.|$|E

After Ann Ennals' death he married Betsy Garnett in 1796. They were active members of the Methodist Church, and gave the church much of their time and attention.|$|E

25|$|In 1940, Bästlein, Jacob, Abshagen and Gustav Bruhn were {{released}} from Sachsenhausen concentration camp. They immediately set {{about building a}} Resistance organization after secret meetings with the remnants of various Resistance groups of the Communist Party of Germany and other small groups. The plan was to help promote {{the overthrow of the}} Nazi regime and end the war <b>by</b> <b>concentrating</b> <b>on</b> large Hamburg companies. Through extensive contacts, they were able to build a conspiratorial network in over 30 firms, primarily in the Hamburg shipyards. Their declared goals were to mobilize the workers, support the foreign forced laborers and the Soviet prisoners of war and to sabotage the weapons production. The group consisted of Communist Party members, some Social Democrats, independents and foreign forced laborers. The group promoted a socialist Germany allied with the Soviet Union, using leaflets that were, as a rule, distributed internally. Through Wilhelm Guddorf, they had contacts outside Hamburg, with the Rote Kapelle in Berlin and Leo Drabent and Hermann Böse in Bremen.|$|E
500|$|Extreme {{isolation}} from society and community is also apparent in Crane's work. [...] During {{the most intense}} battle scenes in The Red Badge of Courage, for example, the story's focus is mainly [...] "on the inner responses of a self unaware of others". In [...] "The Open Boat", [...] "An Experiment in Misery" [...] and other stories, Crane uses light, motion and color to express degrees of epistemological uncertainty. Similar to other Naturalistic writers, Crane scrutinizes the position of man, who has been isolated not only from society, but also from God and nature. [...] "The Open Boat", for example, distances itself from Romantic optimism and affirmation of man's {{place in the world}} <b>by</b> <b>concentrating</b> <b>on</b> the characters' isolation.|$|E
500|$|Although autobiographical in nature, [...] "The Open Boat" [...] {{is a work}} of fiction; it {{is often}} {{considered}} a principal example of Naturalism, an offshoot of the Realist literary movement, in which scientific principles of objectivity and detachment are applied to the study of human characteristics. While a majority of critics agree that the story acts as a paradigm of the human situation, they disagree as to its precise nature. Some believe the story affirms man's place in the world <b>by</b> <b>concentrating</b> <b>on</b> the characters' isolation, while others—including those who call [...] "The Open Boat" [...] ideologically Symbolist—insist that the story questions man's place in the universe through metaphorical or indirect means.|$|E

500|$|The Hergé Foundation has {{maintained}} {{control of the}} licenses, through Moulinsart, the commercial wing of the foundation. Speaking in 2002, Peter Horemans, the then director general at Moulinsart, noted this control: [...] "We {{have to be very}} protective of the property. We don't take lightly any potential partners {{and we have to be}} very selective... for him to continue to be as popular as he is, great care needs to be taken of his use." [...] However, the Foundation has been criticised by scholars as [...] "trivialising the work of Hergé <b>by</b> <b>concentrating</b> <b>on</b> the more lucrative merchandising" [...] in the wake of a move in the late 1990s to charge them for using relevant images to illustrate their papers on the series.|$|E
500|$|In 1959, the BBC {{appointed}} William Glock {{as controller}} of {{music for the}} BBC. [...] During Glock's tenure, the profile and fortunes of the BBC SO began to rise. [...] Glock engaged Antal Doráti as the orchestra's principal conductor. [...] Heyworth judged that Doráti raised standards of playing and brought new vigour to the programmes in his four years in charge (1962–1966). Doráti {{was convinced that the}} orchestra was stultified <b>by</b> <b>concentrating</b> <b>on</b> studio broadcasts, as it did except during the Proms season. He strove to free players from [...] "slavery to the microphone", and Glock promoted a regular series of concerts at the Festival Hall. The music critic Tom Sutcliffe later wrote that Doráti and his successors, Colin Davis (1967–71), Pierre Boulez (1971–75) and Gennady Rozhdestvensky (1978–81) had been partly successful in improving playing standards, but had not brought the orchestra up to its original level of distinction.|$|E
500|$|In The Slave Community, Blassingame {{argues that}} [...] "historians have never {{systematically}} explored the life experiences of American slaves."

[...] Blassingame outlines that {{the reliance on}} planter sources led historians like Elkins to mimic planter stereotypes of slaves such as the [...] "submissive half-man, half child" [...] Sambo. Noting the agency slaves possessed over their lives, he contends, [...] "Rather than identifying with and submitting totally to his master, the slave held onto many remnants of his African culture, gained a sense of worth in the quarters, {{spent most of his}} time free from surveillance by whites, controlled important aspects of his life, and did some personally meaningful things on his own volition." ...|$|E

500|$|Miller and Hordern's {{collaboration}} {{continued into}} 1969 with King Lear at the Nottingham Playhouse. Hordern immediately accepted {{the title role}} but later {{said that it was}} a character he never much cared to play. Writing about Miller in his autobiography, Hordern stated: [...] "It {{was one of the most}} exhilarating and funny experiences I have had in the theatre." [...] Miller recruited Frank Middlemass to play the fool, but contrary to tradition, Miller made the character an intimate of Lear's as opposed to a servant, something which Shakespearean purists found difficult to accept. Miller decided to further defy convention <b>by</b> <b>concentrating</b> <b>on</b> the relationships between the characters rather than adding detail to scenery and costume; he was eager not to use lavish sets and lighting for the fear of detracting from the characterisations and the sentimentality of the storyline. As such, the sets were bleak and the costumes more so; it was a style that was also used when the play was televised by the BBC later that decade.|$|E
500|$|James Hunt, in {{his review}} for Den of Geek, was {{surprised}} {{that no one in}} the episode reacted to Troi undergoing what he saw as a form of rape. He also felt that her eagerness to have the child could have been a type of mind control, but none of the crew seem to consider that as a possibility. He said that the crew failed to act rationally for the sake of the plot, which was one of his pet peeves in television, adding that you could [...] "Replace any main character in this episode with a parsnip and the outcome will be unchanged." [...] Hunt also described the introduction of new elements as [...] "clunky", feigning [...] "wonder" [...] that [...] "someone doesn't say 'Nice facial hair, beardo' to Riker because that's the level of subtlety they go for." [...] Zack Handlen, in reviewing the episode for The A.V. Club gave it a score of D+, criticising the passive nature of Troi and equated her pregnancy to rape. The entire life of the child was presented as a [...] "joyous life experience", and Handlen described the lack of issues in a three-day pregnancy as [...] "bunk". He felt that the episode would have been better served <b>by</b> <b>concentrating</b> <b>on</b> the hard science fiction concept of the plasma plague, which was only used as a macguffin.|$|E
