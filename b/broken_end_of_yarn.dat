5000|$|Weaving has {{at least}} two other {{meanings}} in knitting. First, weaving in the <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> the <b>yarn</b> means burying the free <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> the <b>yarn(s)</b> in the knitted fabric to secure them, by passing them in and around the stitches. Second, weaving is sometimes used as a synonym for grafting.|$|R

40|$|AIM:To {{investigate}} the clinical effect of using microscope {{to find the}} <b>broken</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> lacrimal canalicular and annular-intubation during traumatic lacrimal-canaliculi anastomosis. METHODS:In 52 cases(52 eyes) with traumatic canaliculi laceration from March 2010 to December 2014, microscopy was used to find the <b>broken</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> lacrimal canalicular and annular-intubation implantation was performed during anastomosis. At 2 ～ 3 mo after the surgeries, annular tubes were pulled out and patients were followed up for 3 ～ 12 mo. RESULTS:In all the 52 cases, 47 cases were cured, 3 cases were improved, and 2 cases were not healed. The 2 not-healed patients were cured after treated by laser. CONCLUSION:The application of the annular-intubation for canaliculi laceration under the microscope is simple and the curative effect is reliable, besides, the the patients' appearance and normal work were not affected when the annular-tube was reserved. And it can {{reduce the incidence of}} eyelid deformity. Generally, it's a good methord for canaliculi laceration...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — The {{effect of}} a TiO 2 {{nanoparticle}} suspension (4 mg in 5 ml distilled water) doped or not with gold or iron, complexed or not with α- or β-cyclodextrin, on the mitotic division was studied. The treatment was performed in the M cellular mitotic cycle phase, in the meristematic tissue of Nigella damascena radicels, being analyzed the cytogenetic modifications. The cyclodextrin type and the ratio between cyclodextrin and titanium dioxide affect the percentage of normal cells and the chromosome aberration type. The TiO 2 complexed with α-cyclodextrin did not facilitate the reunion <b>of</b> the chromosome <b>broken</b> <b>ends</b> (absence <b>of</b> bridges in anaphase and in telophase). The titanium dioxide doped with iron, complexed with α- or β-cyclodextrin, also reduced the percentage of reunion <b>of</b> the <b>broken</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> the chromosomes. These findings suggest {{the possibility of using}} doped or undoped TiO 2, complexed with α-cyclodextrin, in the anticarcinogen therapy...|$|R
40|$|Broken implants, {{especially}} {{broken wires}} at difficult sites, may pose {{a challenge for}} the treating orthopedic surgeon. We describe a method for extraction of a broken guidewire that was, protruding into the hip joint following the insertion of a proximal femoral nail. A 35 -year-old man with displaced femoral neck fracture with ipsilateral fracture shaft of femur was operated and fixed with long proximal femoral nail. The guidewire of proximal screw broke {{during the process of}} drilling. The tip of the 2 -cm-long broken guidewire was touching the articular surface. The guidewire was misdirected posteroinferiorly from its path for the insertion of the proximal screw (6. 8 mm), this screw was removed and bone endoscopy was performed with a 30 ° arthroscope. The <b>broken</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the guidewire was located under direct vision. The grasper was introduced with its jaws at the 8 O’clock position and its position was confirmed under a C-arm image intensifier in both anteroposterior and lateral views. The <b>broken</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the guidewire was grasped and it was retrieved. The screw was replaced in its original track to complete the procedure. The fractures united and patient was asymptomatic when last followed-up at 12 months...|$|R

5000|$|Genetic {{exchange}} between two DNA molecules by homologous recombination {{begins with a}} break in both strands of DNA—called a double-strand break—and recombination is started by an endonuclease enzyme that cuts the DNA molecule that [...] "receives" [...] the exchanged DNA. In meiosis the enzyme is SPO11, which is related to DNA topoisomerases. Topoisomerases change DNA by transiently breaking one or both strands, passing the unbroken DNA strand or strands through the break and repairing the break; the <b>broken</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> the DNA are covalently linked to topoisomerase. SPO11 is similarly attached to the DNA when it forms double-strand breaks during meiosis.|$|R

That is merely a substitution of fact for fact. One may doubt whether one is perceiving or remembering or telling facts clearly, but the persuasion that there are facts, independent of one's interpretations and obdurate to one's will, remains invincible.|$|R

The purpose of the design was to incorporate Monet 2 ̆ 7 s unique artistic interpretation of nature to surface design elements in conjunction with the environmentally friendly dyeing technique. Wool yarns with three different textures were dyed with Kool-Aid drink mix and couched onto black wool gabardine to create the surface design. The loose <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>yarns</b> at the hemline are felted with added black wool roving. Carefully controlled yarn application created soft movement of artist 2 ̆ 7 s brushstrokes; while the textural transition of the felted hemline created the willow reflection harmonizing into the water...|$|R

50|$|ZFNs {{are also}} used to rewrite the {{sequence}} of an allele by invoking the homologous recombination (HR) machinery to repair the DSB using the supplied DNA fragment as a template. The HR machinery searches for homology between the damaged chromosome and the extra-chromosomal fragment and copies the sequence of the fragment between the two <b>broken</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> the chromosome, {{regardless of whether the}} fragment contains the original sequence. If the subject is homozygous for the target allele, the efficiency of the technique is reduced since the undamaged copy of the allele may be used as a template for repair instead of the supplied fragment.|$|R
