5|$|From {{source to}} mouth, 10% of the {{watershed}} is in New Castle, 42% {{in the town}} of Mount Pleasant, 33% in Greenburgh, and 14% in Yonkers. 63% of the watershed consists of dense urban or less dense suburban land development, 34% forest, and 1% agricultural. The woodlands <b>buffering</b> the river and the South County Trailway {{is one of the few}} significant areas of open space in the county south of I-287.|$|E
5|$|The Shannon Diversity Index, {{which is}} {{commonly}} {{used to measure the}} diversity of biological communities, of West Creek is slightly over 2.5. The Hilsenhoff Biotic Index, a measure of pollution-tolerant macroinvertebrates, on much of the creek ranges from 1.6 to 2.5, although an area of the creek near Benton ranges from 2.6 to 3.5. There is little riparian <b>buffering</b> along the sections of West Creek where agriculture is done.|$|E
5|$|The stomach {{itself is}} {{protected}} from the strong acid by the secretion of a thick mucus layer, and by secretin induced <b>buffering</b> with sodium bicarbonate. Heartburn or peptic ulcers can develop when these mechanisms fail. Drugs of the antihistaminic and proton pump inhibitor classes can inhibit the production of acid in the stomach, and antacids are used to neutralize existing acid.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 57,000 {{visitors}} come to {{the park}} each year {{for a variety of}} outdoor recreational activities. The 1978 final rule listing Novisuccinea chittenangoensis as threatened estimated that 60 percent of the habitat at Chittenango Falls was trampled by humans. Human disturbance also continues to threaten Novisuccinea chittenangoensis, although this has been greatly minimized by fencing of the snail's habitat area at Chittenango Falls. The current strategy for recovering Novisuccinea chittenangoensis includes <b>buffering</b> the species against extinction by perpetuating the extant population at Chittenango Falls at a baseline size, and new attempts in maintaining multiple captive populations.|$|E
5|$|In 1902 Victor Henri {{proposed}} a quantitative theory of enzyme kinetics, {{but at the}} time the experimental significance of the hydrogen ion concentration was not yet recognized. After Peter Lauritz Sørensen had defined the logarithmic pH-scale and introduced the concept of <b>buffering</b> in 1909 the German chemist Leonor Michaelis and his Canadian postdoc Maud Leonora Menten repeated Henri's experiments and confirmed his equation, which is now generally referred to as Michaelis-Menten kinetics (sometimes also Henri-Michaelis-Menten kinetics). Their work was further developed by G. E. Briggs and J. B. S. Haldane, who derived kinetic equations that are still widely considered today a starting point in modeling enzymatic activity.|$|E
5|$|The {{plant life}} around the Griffin Reservoir on Leggetts Creek {{includes}} various native trees and understory plants. From the reservoir downstream to an intake pond near Interstate 81, the creek's riparian buffer contains old growth forest, including tulip poplar trees. In addition to tulip popular, hemlock and pine also {{occur in the}} Griffin Mills reach of the creek. Near Leggetts Gap, the creek has some riparian <b>buffering.</b> Even in its lower reaches, the it has a stable vegetative cover in some areas. However, other areas are full of invasive plants. Major invasive plant species include Japanese knotweed, Norway Maple, and Ailanthus. Overall, the riparian buffer of the creek mainly consists of grassland and forested land.|$|E
5|$|A {{knowledge}} of pKa values {{is important for}} the quantitative treatment of systems involving acid–base equilibria in solution. Many applications exist in biochemistry; for example, the pKa values of proteins and amino acid side chains are of major importance for the activity of enzymes and the stability of proteins. Protein pKa values cannot always be measured directly, but may be calculated using theoretical methods. Buffer solutions are used extensively to provide solutions at or near the physiological pH for the study of biochemical reactions; the design of these solutions depends on a {{knowledge of}} the pKa values of their components. Important buffer solutions include MOPS, which provides a solution with pH 7.2, and tricine, which is used in gel electrophoresis. <b>Buffering</b> {{is an essential part of}} acid base physiology including acid–base homeostasis, and is key to understanding disorders such as acid–base imbalance. The isoelectric point of a given molecule is a function of its pK values, so different molecules have different isoelectric points. This permits a technique called isoelectric focusing, which is used for separation of proteins by 2-D gel polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.|$|E
5|$|In stream {{communities}}, few animal groups became extinct {{because such}} communities rely less directly on food from living plants {{and more on}} detritus that washes in from the land, <b>buffering</b> them from extinction. Similar, but more complex patterns {{have been found in}} the oceans. Extinction was more severe among animals living in the water column than among animals living on or in the sea floor. Animals in the water column are almost entirely dependent on primary production from living phytoplankton, while animals living on or in the ocean floor feed on detritus or can switch to detritus feeding. Coccolithophorids and mollusks (including ammonites, rudists, freshwater snails, and mussels), and those organisms whose food chain included these shell builders, became extinct or suffered heavy losses. For example, it is thought that ammonites were the principal food of mosasaurs, a group of giant marine reptiles that became extinct at the boundary. The largest air-breathing survivors of the event, crocodyliforms and champsosaurs, were semi-aquatic and had access to detritus. Modern crocodilians can live as scavengers, can survive for months without food, and their young are small, grow slowly, and feed largely on invertebrates and dead organisms or fragments of organisms for their first few years. These characteristics have been linked to crocodilian survival {{at the end of the}} Cretaceous.|$|E

25|$|Situated in the Limpopo Province, roughly {{halfway between}} Polokwane (previously Pietersburg) and AFB Makhado, {{near the town}} of Louis Trichardt. This {{property}} is used for air superiority training. <b>Buffering</b> the range is the Corbadraai Nature Reserve.|$|E
25|$|RAID-Z {{does not}} require any special hardware: it does not need NVRAM for reliability, {{and it does not}} need write <b>buffering</b> for good performance. With RAID-Z, ZFS {{provides}} fast, reliable storage using cheap, commodity disks.|$|E
25|$|Perishable. Since {{services}} are perishable, they cannot be stored for later use. In manufacturing companies, inventory {{can be used}} to buffer supply and demand. Since <b>buffering</b> is not possible in services, highly variable demand must be met by operations or demand modified to meet supply.|$|E
25|$|Windows 98 {{introduced}} WDM Audio and the Kernel Audio Mixer driver (KMixer), {{which enabled}} digital mixing, routing and processing of simultaneous audio streams {{with a higher}} quality sample rate conversion as well as kernel streaming. Under WDM, DirectSound sends data to the software-based KMixer. Windows 98 Second Edition improved WDM audio support by adding DirectSound hardware <b>buffering,</b> DirectSound3D hardware abstraction, KMixer sample-rate conversion (SRC) for capture streams, multichannel audio support and introduction of DirectMusic. If the audio hardware supports hardware mixing (also known as hardware <b>buffering</b> or DirectSound hardware acceleration), DirectSound buffers directly to the rendering device. If DirectSound streams use hardware mixing, KMixer and its latency delay are bypassed. On Windows 98 and Windows Me, WDM audio drivers were preferred but compatibility with VxD driver model was preserved.|$|E
25|$|Registered or {{buffered}} memory, which improves {{signal integrity}} (and hence potentially clock rates and physical slot capacity) by electrically <b>buffering</b> the signals with a register, {{at a cost}} of an extra clock of increased latency. Those modules are identified by an additional R in their designation, for example PC3-6400R.|$|E
25|$|SDRAM latency is not {{inherently}} lower (faster) than asynchronous DRAM. Indeed, early SDRAM {{was somewhat}} slower than contemporaneous burst EDO DRAM {{due to the}} additional logic. The benefits of SDRAM's internal <b>buffering</b> come from its ability to interleave operations to multiple banks of memory, thereby increasing effective bandwidth.|$|E
25|$|The amine group, in aminoallyl-modified nucleotide, is {{reactive}} with dyes {{such as the}} cyanine series, {{or other}} patented dyes. A problem arises when the dyes react with <b>buffering</b> agents which are necessary for the proper storage of the nucleotides. However, a carbonate buffer {{can be used to}} overcome this problem.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the high}} {{permittivity}} supports high capacitance values in small devices. Class 2 capacitors are significantly smaller than class 1 devices at the equal rated capacitance and voltage. They {{are suitable for}} applications that require the capacitor to maintain only a minimum value of capacitance, for example, <b>buffering</b> and filtering in power supplies and coupling and decoupling of electric signals.|$|E
25|$|Propylene glycol oxidizes {{when exposed}} to air and heat, forming lactic acid. If not {{properly}} inhibited, this fluid can be very corrosive, so pH <b>buffering</b> agents such as dipotassium phosphate and potassium bicarbonate are often added to propylene glycol, to prevent acidic corrosion of metal components. Pre-inhibited propylene glycol solutions {{can also be used}} instead of pure propylene glycol to prevent corrosion.|$|E
25|$|The Hewitt, Bishop and Steiger {{approach}} concerns {{sequential processing}} and inter-process communication in digital, serial, kinematic computers. It is a parallel or pseudo-concurrent theory {{as is the}} theory of concurrency. See Concurrency. In Pask's true field concurrent theory kinetic processes can interrupt (or, indeed, interact with) each other, simply reproducing or producing a new resultant force within a coherence (of concepts) but without <b>buffering</b> delays or priority.|$|E
25|$|Sri Lanka has 45 {{estuaries}} and 40 lagoons. Sri Lanka's mangrove ecosystem spans over 7,000 hectares {{and played}} {{a vital role in}} <b>buffering</b> the force of the waves in the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. The island is rich in minerals such as ilmenite, feldspar, graphite, silica, kaolin, mica and thorium. Existence of petroleum and gas in the Gulf of Mannar has also been confirmed and the extraction of recoverable quantities is underway.|$|E
25|$|These {{included}} {{reading or}} writing single characters {{to the system}} console and reading or writing a sector of data from the disk. The BDOS handled some of the <b>buffering</b> of data from the diskette, but before CP/M 3.0 it assumed a disk sector size fixed at 128 bytes, as used on single-density 8-inch floppy disks. Since most 5.25-inch disk formats used larger sectors, the blocking and deblocking and the management of a disk buffer area was handled by model-specific code in the BIOS.|$|E
25|$|Social living {{provides}} {{a multitude of}} advantages to its practitioners, including predation risk reduction, environmental <b>buffering,</b> food procurement, and possible mating advantages. The most advanced form of sociality is eusociality, characterized by overlapping generations, cooperative care of the young, and reproductive division of labor, which includes sterility or near-sterility of {{the overwhelming majority of}} colony members. With few exceptions, all the practitioners of eusociality are insects of the orders Hymenoptera (ants, bees, and wasps), Isoptera (termites), Thysanoptera (thrips), and Hemiptera (aphids).|$|E
25|$|Directly to {{the south}} are several blocks of lightly planted open space <b>buffering</b> the Aquatics Center from Beichen West. On the north a parking lot {{separates}} Digital Beijing from National Stadium Road and the InterContinental Beichen Beijing Hotel high-rise on the other side. The buildings of Science Park Nanli are across Beichen to the west, and the Pangu Seven-Star Hotel on {{the southwest corner of}} the intersection anchors the buildings of Pangu Plaza, which continue {{to the south}} along the west side of Beichen West.|$|E
25|$|The idea of epigenetics {{and gene}} {{expression}} {{has been a}} theory applied to the origins of homosexuality in humans. One team of researchers {{examined the effects of}} epi-marks <b>buffering</b> XX fetuses and XY fetuses from certain androgen exposure and used published data on fetal androgen signaling and gene regulation through non-genetic changes in DNA packaging to develop a new model for homosexuality. The researchers found that stronger than average epi-marks, epigenomes that are wrapped tightly around the DNA sequence, convert sexual preference in individuals without altering genitalia or sexual identity.|$|E
25|$|Due {{to their}} {{relatively}} high capacitance values aluminum electrolytic capacitors have low impedance values even at lower frequencies like mains frequency. They are typically used in power supplies, {{switched-mode power supplies}} and DC-DC converters for smoothing and <b>buffering</b> rectified DC voltages in many electronic devices {{as well as in}} industrial power supplies and frequency converters as DC link capacitors for drives, inverters for photovoltaic, and converters in wind power plants. Special types are used for energy storage, for example in photoflash or strobe applications or for frequency coupling in audio applications.|$|E
25|$|Glycine is a {{significant}} component of some solutions used in the SDS-PAGE method of protein analysis. It serves as a <b>buffering</b> agent, maintaining pH and preventing sample damage during electrophoresis. Glycine {{is also used to}} remove protein-labeling antibodies from Western blot membranes to enable the probing of numerous proteins of interest from SDS-PAGE gel. This allows more data to be drawn from the same specimen, increasing the reliability of the data, reducing the amount of sample processing, and number of samples required. This process is known as stripping.|$|E
25|$|RealPlayer SP {{includes}} audio CD burning capabilities, DVR-style playback <b>buffering,</b> multimedia search, Internet radio, a jukebox-style file library, an embedded {{web browser}} (using Microsoft Internet Explorer), {{and the ability}} to convert and transfer media {{to a wide range of}} devices. This includes music players such as iPod and Zune, smartphones such as iPhone and BlackBerry, portable gaming devices such as Sony PSP, and console gaming systems such as Xbox 360, PS3, and Wii. Since version 11, RealPlayer SP has gained Flash Video support, DVD, SVCD, VCD burning (120-minute) and video recording (DRM is supported).|$|E
25|$|Type 4 RTA is not {{actually}} a tubular disorder at all {{nor does it}} have a clinical syndrome similar to the other types of RTA described above. It was included in the classification of renal tubular acidoses as it is associated with a mild (normal anion gap) metabolic acidosis due to a physiological reduction in proximal tubular ammonium excretion (impaired ammoniagenesis), which is secondary to hypoaldosteronism, and results in a decrease in urine <b>buffering</b> capacity. Its cardinal feature is hyperkalemia, and measured urinary acidification is normal, hence it is often called hyperkalemic RTA or tubular hyperkalemia.|$|E
25|$|Due to the triprotic {{dissociation}} of orthophosphoric acid, so {{that its}} conjugate bases (the phosphates mentioned above) cover a wide pH range, and due to phosphoric acid/phosphate solutions being, in general, non-toxic, mixtures {{of these types of}} phosphates are often used as <b>buffering</b> agents or to make buffer solutions, where the desired pH depends on the proportions of the phosphates in the mixtures. Similarly, the non-toxic anion salts of triprotic organic citric acid are also often used to make buffers. Phosphates are found pervasively in biology, especially in the compounds derived from phosphorylated sugars, such as DNA, RNA, and adenosine triphosphate.|$|E
