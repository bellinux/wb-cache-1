40|$|The surface microlayer (SML) is {{the thin}} <b>biogenic</b> <b>film</b> {{found at the}} surface of a water body. The SML is poorly {{understood}} but {{has been shown to be}} important in biogeochemical cycling and sea-air gas exchange. We sampled the SML of the Blyth estuary at two sites (salinities 21 and 31 psu) using 47 mm polycarbonate membranes. DNA was extracted from the SML and corresponding subsurface water (0. 4 m depth) and microbial (bacteria and archaea) community analysis was performed using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of 16 S rRNA gene PCR amplicons. The diversity of bacterial functional genes that encode enzyme subunits for methane monooxygenase (pmoA and mmoX) and carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (coxL) was assessed using PCR, clone library construction and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. Methanotroph genes were present only in low copy numbers and pmoA was detected only in subsurface samples. Diversity of mmoX genes was low and most of the clone sequences detected were similar to those of mmoX from Methylomonas spp. Interestingly, some sequences detected in the SML were different from those detected in the subsurface. RFLP analysis of coxL clone libraries indicated a high diversity of carbon monoxide (CO) -utilizing bacteria in the estuary. The habitats of the closely related coxL sequences suggest that CO-utilizing bacteria in the estuary are recruited from both marine and freshwater/terrestrial inputs. In contrast, methanotroph recruitment appears to occur solely from freshwater input into the estuary. ...|$|E
40|$|Results from a time-series {{study of}} coastal sea surface microlayer (SML) and sub-surface water marine gel and {{biological}} dynamics (L 4 station, Western English Channel) {{during the transition}} from low to high productivity indicate the SML is an interfacial film with variable potential to suppress ocean-atmosphere gas exchanges dependent on bulk water processes. Phytoneuston communities were consistently enriched from sub-surface phytoplankton by a mean enrichment factor (EF) of 3. 3 showing indication of reduced photosynthetic rates and increased production of extracellular polysaccharides. Use of a new method to determine the potential for coagulation of carbon rich marine gel aggregates, termed transparent exopolymer particles (TEP) from dissolved polysaccharide precursors (P-TEP), suggests {{there is a greater}} and more dynamic total pool of organic carbon in the SML than previously reported. P-TEP was enriched (mean EF = 1. 3) as were concentrations of in-situ TEP (mean EF = 1. 1), similar to values from mesotrophic/eutrophic waters. In-situ TEP aggregates were at the highest concentration 4 weeks prior to the chlorophyll-a maximum (5. 47 mg/m³). This large bloom marked a reduction of enrichments of both gel phases and a change in the ratio of gels in particulate and dissolved states in the following weeks. A significant negative correlation with increased high nucleic acid (HNA) content bacteria was also found. Bacterial hydrolysis of aggregates, together with potential downwards particle flux at wind speeds > 3. 7 m s- 1 and sea states ranging from choppy to rough may have caused lowered in-situ TEP enrichments within a complex and dynamic system progressed by seasonal environmental forcing (e. g. > temperature, light, pCO 2). The findings support previous conclusions that although the SML is generally enriched, changed trophic states initiated by spring/summer phytoplankton blooms can prevent enhanced formation of the gelatinous <b>biogenic</b> <b>film...</b>|$|E
40|$|The sunglint {{condition}} in remote sensing images at the visible spectrum brings {{information about the}} sea surface shortwave roughness. Mineral <b>films</b> or <b>biogenic</b> <b>films</b> present in the ocean surface can effectively change this roughness. Therefore, by using normalized radiance of glint contaminated MODIS images one can detect the surfactants. Here, a new automatic technique is developed in which we compare modeled normalized sunglint radiance for clear water and surfaces with films. This approach provides a tool to detect films on sea surface. A case study of <b>biogenic</b> <b>films</b> formed by Trichodesmium cianobacteria in the southeastern Brazilian coast in January 2003 reveals the potential of MODIS images under sunglint to detect biofilms. The global monitoring of natural films is of great importance for the understanding heat, particles, momentum and gases exchanges between ocean and atmosphere. The sunglint {{condition in}} MODIS images, even dependent on specific acquisition geometric conditions (Sun and sensor), could mean an improvement in the global detection of natural films. An advantage over other methods is its relatively high spatial resolution (250 m) at zero cost to the scientific community and society. Yet, more importantly, {{is the possibility of}} using such images to reveal surfactants at low wind conditions (< 2 m/s), very difficult to do using SAR images due to the absence of Bragg scattering.

40|$|The {{increased}} {{amount of}} available Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images involves a growing workload on the operators at analysis centers. In addition, {{even if the}} operators go through extensive training to learn manual oil spill detection, they can provide different and subjective responses. Hence, the upgrade and improvements of algorithms for automatic detection that can help in screening the images and prioritizing the alarms are of great benefit. In this paper we present the potentialities of TerraSAR-X (TS-X) data and Neural Network algorithms for oil spills detection. The radar on board satellite TS-X provides X-band images with a resolution of up to 1 m. Such resolution can be very effective in the monitoring of coastal areas to prevent sea oil pollution.

Candidates with a probability less than 50 % are classified as look-alikes.

The work reported here focuses on experimental results of fluorescent features of photosynthetic microbial species (cyanobacteria) and also five different crude oil samples. The cyanobacteria samples were collected from the Baltic Sea at the end of July 2011 and were associated with cyanobacterial bloom events, and the crude oil samples were from various oil spill events. The aim of the study was to find fluorescent biosignatures of cyanobacteria (initially a species specific to the Baltic Sea) and the fingerprints of crude oil; oil spills can be difficult to differentiate from <b>biogenic</b> <b>films</b> when using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) or sunglint contaminated optical imagery. All samples were measured using a Perkin Elmer LS 55 Luminescence spectrometer over a broad range of excitation and emission wavelength from ultraviolet (UV) to near infrared (NIR). The results are presented in Excitation Emission Matrices (EEMs) that exhibit the fluorescent features of each sample. In the EEM of the seawater sample containing cyanobacteria, there is an intense emission peak from tryptophan with fluorescent excitation and emission peaks at 285 and 345 nm respectively.

40|$|A {{small-scale}} oceanic eddy, {{which was}} generated in autumn 2011 at the headland of Cap-Vert {{off the coast}} of Senegal, West Africa, and then propagated westward into the open North Atlantic Ocean, is studied by multi-sensor satellite and surface drifter data. The eddy was generated after a sudden increase of the trade winds causing an enhanced southward flow and upwelling at the coast of Senegal. After this wind burst event, an extremely nonlinear cyclonic eddy with a radius of about 10 to 20 km evolved downstream of Cap-Vert with Rossby number larger than one. Our analysis suggests that the eddy was generated by flow separation at the headland of Cap-Vert. The eddy was tracked on its way into the open North Atlantic Ocean from satellites over 31 days via its sea surface temperature and chlorophyll-a (CHL) signature and by a satellite-tracked surface drifter. The satellite images show that this small-scale eddy transported nutrients from the upwelling region westward into the oligotrophic North Atlantic thus giving rise to enhanced CHL concentration there. Maximum CHL concentration was encountered few days after vortex generation, which is consistent with a delayed plankton growth following nutrient supply into the euphotic zone within the eddy. Furthermore, the eddy was imaged by the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) onboard the Envisat satellite. It is shown that the radar signatures of cold eddies result from damping of short surface waves by <b>biogenic</b> surface <b>films</b> which arise from surface-active material secreted by the biota in the cold eddy {{as well as by the}} change of the stability of the air–sea interface.

40|$|International audienceHigh-resolution {{satellite}} images and oceanographic field measurements {{have revealed that}} oceanic eddies with diameters ranging from 1 to several hundred km are ubiquitous phenomena in the World's ocean. While eddies with horizontal scales above 100 km have been studied extensively using altimeter data, only few papers exist dealing with observations of eddies with horizontal scales below 50 km. These small-scale eddies cannot be resolved by conventional altimeters, {{but they can be}} observed from space by high-resolution optical/infrared sensors and by synthetic aperture radars (SARs). In this paper we report about a single small-scale cyclonic (cold) eddy which was generated at the headland of Cap-Vert off the coast of Senegal following a sudden freshening of the trade winds. Due to favorable cloud conditions, we were able to track the time evolution of the eddy for 31 days by {{satellite images}} acquired in the visible/ infrared band. Furthermore, the eddy was also imaged during this period by a space-borne SAR. Cold eddies become visible on SAR images via the change in the small-scale sea surface roughness caused by the damping of short surface waves by <b>biogenic</b> surface <b>films</b> or/and by the change of the stability of the air-sea interface. <b>Biogenic</b> surface <b>films</b> consist of surface-active material secreted by biota in the cold eddy. The satellite data we are using are from the MODIS sensor onboard the American Aqua satellite, the AVHHR sensor onboard the European MetOp satellite, and the Advanced SAR (ASAR) onboard the European Envisat satellite. The sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll-a (CHL) maps derived from MODIS data show that the eddy propagated from its birth place at Cap-Vert in the Senegal upwelling region westward into the open North Atlantic. During the 31 days of satellite observations, the eddy moved 200 km westward thereby carrying nutrients from the upwelling region into the oligotrophic North Atlantic, where it caused enhanced CHL concentration. Maximum CHL concentration was encountered few days after the eddy generation, which is consistent with a delayed plankton growth following nutrient supply into the euphotic zone within the eddy. Furthermore, we recorded the movement of the eddy also by a satellite-tracked surface drifter. To our knowledge, {{this is the first time}} that a small-scale eddy has been tracked over such a long time period by high-resolution satellite images and simultaneously by a surface drifter. Model calculations carried out with the "Mercator" ocean circulation model show that the generation of the small-scale eddy was linked to a sudden increase of the trade winds. This wind event caused enhanced southward flow and upwelling at the coast of Senegal.

40|$|SSCI-VIDE+CARE+MBM:NHY:SPR:CGOInternational audienceFilms {{of organic}} {{compounds}} {{exposed to the}} atmosphere are ubiquitously found on surfaces of cloud droplets, aerosol particles, buildings, plants, soils and the ocean. The sea-surface microlayer {{is one example of}} organic films that are host to countless biogenic amphiphilic compounds concentrated there with respect to bulk water. Yet, organic materials present in the bulk, such as humic acids and other photosensitizing compounds, can still have a tremendous impact on the surfactants (George, 2015). Here, we present a laboratory investigation on secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation from the reaction of ozone with volatile organic compounds (VOCs), originating from photo-induced processes in surfactant-containing water or sea-water. The results underscore the environmental importance of photochemical reactions at the air–water interface to produce SOA precursors in significant amounts, leading to significant particle formation and growth. Laboratory experiments were conducted in a custom-built 2 m 3 Teflon reaction chamber with a pure or sea-water reservoir containing nonanoic acid, a model surfactant proxy for a surface microlayer, and humic acids when desired. In other experiments nonanol was used as a surfactant for comparison. VOC concentrations were measured over time using a proton transfer reaction–time of flight–mass spectrometer (PTR–ToF–MS) as a function of irradiation (UV and visible light) in a humidified low NOx and low ozone environment. Additionally, photochemical gas- and liquid-phase products generated by irradiation of natural riverine biofilms were investigated. Characterization of organic compounds in water and aerosol particles was performed with ion chromatography and liquid chromatography–high resolution mass spectrometry (LC–HRMS) utilizing a quadrupole-orbitrap detector. Aerosol size distribution and numbers were continuously monitored during all experiments. Production of VOCs occurred while the chamber air and water were irradiated with UV light for the nonanoic acid and pure water system. Gas-phase products included alkenes, aldehydes and dienes, as observed by PTR–ToF–MS in three different ionization modes (H 3 O+, NO+ and O 2 +). Aerosol nucleation and growth occurred upon ozone introduction and reaction in the chamber but with lights switched off, further indicating the presence of unsaturated VOCs. Concentrations of aerosol particles were typically on the order of 102 – 103 cm– 3. When nonanoic acid and seawater were present, similar types and concentrations of VOCs were observed. Production of halogenated organic compounds was investigated using O 2 + reagent ions. The addition of humic acids typically enhanced photochemical VOC production and aerosol formation, where SOA numbers exceeded 104 cm– 3 after ozone injection and particle nucleation. We note that when nonanol was used as a surfactant, VOC and aerosol formation was never observed. This result highlights the potential importance of the carbonyl functionality of the acid group in the photochemical mechanism. The products were not only emitted to the gas phase, but also the bulk water. Using LC–HRMS the same VOCs, observed with the PTR–ToF–MS in the gas phase, were also identified in bulk water samples extracted during and after experiments. In addition, high molecular weight compounds such as highly oxidized organic molecules and molecular recombination products were identified in experiments with the nonanoic acid surfactant. We suggest that light absorption precedes radical chemistry at the organic surfactant interface. Recent experimental findings in our group, supported by quantum chemical calculations, reveal the possibility of exciting nonanoic acid molecules to their triplet state even under irradiation of 300 – 320 nm wavelengths. Subsequent inter- and intra-molecular reactions have been proposed generating OH and other radicals leading to a suite of products. At an organic interface neighboring organic molecules are likely to react, especially in molecular layers such as those existing in organic or <b>biogenic</b> <b>films.</b> This proximity of organic molecules is unique to an interface, in contrast to the bulk or gas phase and thus, may also result in unique chemical reaction pathways leading to VOC formation. Fatty acid and organic compound coated surfaces are ubiquitous and photon-induced chemistry at organic interfaces may be important, ultimately influencing VOC flux and SOA formation at the Earth’s surface and aloft.

40|$|Review February 24, 2016) The energy {{flows in}} Earth's natural and {{modified}} climate systems are {{strongly influenced by}} the concentrations of atmospheric particulate matter (PM). For predictions of concentration, equilibrium partitioning of semivolatile organic compounds (SVOCs) between organic PM and the surrounding vapor has widely been assumed, yet recent observations show that organic PM can be semisolid or solid for some atmospheric conditions, possibly suggesting that SVOC uptake and release can be slow enough that equilibrium does not prevail on timescales relevant to atmospheric processes. Herein, {{in a series of}} laboratory experiments, the mass labilities of films of secondary organic material representative of similar atmospheric organic PM were directly determined by quartz crystal microbalance measurements of evaporation rates and vapor mass concentrations. There were strong differences between films representative of anthropogenic comparedwith <b>biogenic</b> sources. For <b>films</b> representing anthropogenic PM, evaporation rates and vapor mass concentrations increased above a threshold relative humidity (RH) between 20 % and 30 %, indicating rapid partitioning above a transition RH but not below. Below the threshold, the characteristic time for equilibration is estimated as up to 1 wk for a typically sized particle. In contrast, for <b>films</b> representing <b>biogenic</b> PM, no RH threshold was observed, suggesting equilibrium partitioning is rapidly obtained for all RHs. The effective diffusion rate D org for the biogenic case is at least 10 3 times greater than that of the anthropogenic case. These differences should be accounted for in the interpretation of laboratory data as well as in modeling of organic PMin Earth's atmosphere...|$|R
