It {{primarily affects}} female infants and is lethal {{in the majority}} of males during fetal life. The clinical findings include skin lesions, developmental defects, and defects of the eyes, teeth, skeletal system, and central nervous system. Cardiovascular complications of this disease in general, and pulmonary hypertension in particular, are extremely rare. This report describes the case of a 3 -year-old girl with IP complicated by pulmonary arterial hypertension. Extensive cardiology workup done to the patient indicates underlying vasculopathy. This report sheds light on the relationship between IP and pulmonary hypertension, reviews the previously reported cases, and compares them with the reported case.

40|$|SUMMARY A case of incontinentia pigmenti is {{reported}} with fundus changes in 1 eye. She had microaneurysms temporal to the macula, with an abnormal branch of inferior temporal vein. There was extensive retinitis proliferans {{in the upper}} temporal equatorial region, which showed leakage on fluorescein angiography. The ocular and systemic changes in incontinentia pigmenti are reviewed here and a case {{is reported}} with fundus changes which have not been described previously. Incontinentia pigmenti (IP) is characterised by ectodermal defects, with occasional associated mesodermal abnormalities. The typical skin lesions are blue-grey to chocolate-brown arranged along the naevus lines of Blaschko. These occur on the torso and the extremities. The disease can be dif-ferentiated into 2 clinical types: Bloch-Sulzberger and Naegeli. The <b>Bloch-Sulzberger</b> <b>syndrome</b> occurs predominantly in females and is usually present at birth. There is patchy, splash-like cutaneous pig-mentation with whorls and splotches of pigment. It is associated with frequent ocular changes, absence or malformations of the teeth, and alopecia. The Naegeli type occurs in {{both males and females}} and appears after 2 years of age. There is a reticular type of pigmentation, sometimes associated with hypohidrosis, unhealthy and spotted teeth, and keratosis of palms and soles. The ocular anomalies occur in about a quarter of cases of <b>Bloch-Sulzberger</b> <b>syndrome.</b> They include cataract, uveitis, blue sclerae, conjunctival pigmenta-tion, strabismus, nystagmus, papillitis, optic atrophy, metastatic ophthalmitis, pseudoglioma, retrolental fibroplasia, phthisis bulbi, and microphthalmos.

40|$|SUMMARY A {{family is}} {{described}} in which incontinentia pigmenti (IP) is ~ variably expressed in both sexes, compatible with either autosomal dominant or X linked dominant inheritance. This is the first reported instance of an affected male with a positive family history. Immunological studies of the proband showed no significant alteration of immune function. Cytogenetic investigations of the proband and her affected brother and mother revealed no unusual propensity for chromosome breaks or gaps and no enhancement of sister chromatid exchanges. Incontinentia pigmenti (<b>Bloch-Sulzberger</b> <b>syndrome)</b> is a familial multisystem disorder manifested by characteristic dermatological lesions associated with variable abnormalities of the teeth, hair, nails, eyes, blood, and central nervous system. ' The skin lesions are usually present at birth, or appear shortly there-after, and are initially characterised by an erythema-tous eruption with linear vesiculation and an associated leucocytosis and eosinophilia followed b...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Introduction Incontinentia pigmenti or <b>Bloch-Sulzberger</b> <b>syndrome</b> {{is a rare}} X-linked {{dominant}} {{disease that}} mainly affects the skin, eyes, hair, central nervous system and teeth. The disease is predominant among women.

40|$|Incontinentia pigmenti, {{also called}} <b>Bloch-Sulzberger</b> <b>syndrome,</b> {{is a rare}} X-linked {{inherited}} dominant disorder that affects females, but causes spontaneous abortion of prenatal males. Incontinentia pigmenti is a systemic disease with clinical features similar to ectodermal dysplasia, including congenitally missing teeth. The pathogenesis is related to gene mutations in NF-kappa-B essential modulator on chromosome Xq 28. Incontinentia pigmenti {{is caused by a}} defect in the developmental stage of organs originating from the ectoderm or mesoderm and involves the skin, eyes, hair, teeth and central nervous system. This report discusses the management of three cases of 3 to 5 years old females with incontinentia pigmenti and accompanying multiple missing teeth. The cases had sparse hair, and showed oligodontia and anomalous crowns with supplementary cusps in the posterior teeth and conical anterior teeth. Removable space maintainers were applied, achieving improved esthetics, recovery of mastication and increased self-esteem in the patients.

40|$|Background: Incontinentia pigmenti (IP), {{also known}} as <b>Bloch-Sulzberger</b> <b>syndrome,</b> is a rare X-linked dominant genodermatosis that {{presents}} {{at the time of}} birth or soon after birth with cutaneous manifestation. This disorder may also affect the ectodermal tissues, such as the central nervous system, skeletal system, eyes, hair, nails, and teeth. The dermatological findings occur in four successive phases. Case report: Herein, we presented the case of a two day-old female newborn with inflammatory vesiculopustular lesions on the right forearm and lower limbs, who was in a good general condition. The patient had a history of similar disease in three other members of her family, who had dental abnormalities as the most common non-cutaneous manifestation. This case report highlighted the importance of a detailed diagnostic workup for the newborns with pustular skin disease. Conclusion: IP is a rare, x-linked dominant genodermatosis with multiple organs involvement. Dermatological abnormalities are the most prominent manifestation. The diagnosis is based on the clinical findings, the presence of positive family history of skin vesiculopustular lesions support the diagnosis. The skin lesions do not require specific treatment and prognosis depend to other organs involvement...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Incontinentia Pigmenti (<b>Bloch-Sulzberger</b> <b>Syndrome)</b> is {{a disease}} of organ {{involvement}} with ectodermic and mesodermic origin, showing dominant transition based on the X-chromosome. It affects the skin, eyes, teeth, and central nervous system. Case Report: The patient diagnosed with Incontinentia Pigmenti was referred from the Department of Dermatology, Faculty of Medicine, Mustafa Kemal University to the Department of Periodontology, Faculty of Dentistry, Mustafa Kemal University to consult whether there was anomaly in tooth germs and crests in the mouth. The patient was followed in our clinic for 5 years (examinations at 42 days, 6 months and 5 years). In the extraoral examinations, second-grade hyperkeratotic erythematous papules and plaques on the arms and legs, and linearly-arranged hyperpigmented and hypopigmented macular lesions at various grades were seen. In the intraoral examinations, no anomalies were observed in the crests and the palate during the toothless period. However, during the dentition period, wedge-shaped teeth and oligodontia were observed. In the 5 -year follow-up period, no deficiency was observed in the patient's body and mental development compared with the peers. Conclusion: Early diagnosis of Incontinentia Pigmenti can be made through observation of the dental anomalies. There is no specific treatment of this disease. As it affects multiple systems of the human body, it requires monitoring and treatment with interdisciplinary approaches...|$|E
40|$|Familial incontinentia pigmenti (IP [MIM 308310]), or <b>Bloch-Sulzberger</b> <b>syndrome,</b> is an X-linked {{dominant}} and male-lethal disorder. We recently demonstrated that mutations in NEMO (IKK-γ), which encodes {{a critical component}} of the NF-κB signaling pathway, were responsible for IP. Virtually all mutations eliminate the production of NEMO, causing the typical skewing of X inactivation in female individuals and lethality in male individuals, possibly through enhanced sensitivity to apoptosis. Most mutations also give rise to classic signs of IP, but, in this report, we describe two mutations in families with atypical phenotypes. Remarkably, each family included a male individual with unusual signs, including postnatal survival and either immune dysfunction or hematopoietic disturbance. We found two duplication mutations in these families, at a cytosine tract in exon 10 of NEMO, both of which remove the zinc (Zn) finger at the C-terminus of the protein. Two deletion mutations were also identified in the same tract in additional families. However, only the duplication mutations allowed male individuals to survive, and affected female individuals with duplication mutations demonstrated random or slight skewing of X inactivation. Similarly, NF-κB activation was diminished in the presence of duplication mutations and was completely absent in cells with deletion mutations. These results strongly indicate that male individuals can also suffer from IP caused by NEMO mutations, and we therefore urge a reevaluation of the diagnostic criteria...|$|E
