50|$|For Earth, {{atmospheric}} entry occurs {{above the}} Kármán line {{at an altitude}} of more than 100 km (62 mi.) above the surface, while at Venus atmospheric entry occurs at 250 km (155 mi.) and at Mars atmospheric entry at about 80 km (50 mi.). Uncontrolled, objects accelerate through the atmosphere at extreme velocities under the influence of Earth's gravity. Most controlled objects enter at hypersonic speeds due to their suborbital (e.g., intercontinental <b>ballistic</b> missile <b>reentry</b> vehicles), orbital (e.g., the Space Shuttle), or unbounded (e.g., meteors) trajectories. Various advanced technologies have been developed to enable atmospheric reentry and flight at extreme velocities. An alternative low velocity method of controlled atmospheric entry is buoyancy which is suitable for planetary entry where thick atmospheres, strong gravity or both factors complicate high-velocity hyperbolic entry, such as the atmospheres of Venus, Titan and the gas giants.|$|R
40|$|Algorithm for {{identification}} {{of the characteristics of}} a missile and of its trajectory on the basis of radar measurements has been proposed. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm involves the combined use of maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) and parameters estimate as well as the use of an extended Kalman filter (EKF), a real-time method. Calculations involved missile detection from deterministic data and from measures corrupted by noise including four missile fundamental parameters and six state variables. The analytic estimate thus obtained, provided clue for the convergence of a post-processing algorithm based on the MLE method. The EKF was successfully used in the determination of the state vector that determines the trajectory in the ballistic phase. Such a combined use of batch-detection algorithms for the boosted phase and real-time detection algorithms for the <b>ballistic</b> and <b>reentry</b> phases proves to be an effective solution...|$|R

The TMA-10 spacecraft undocked from the ISS at 07:14 UTC on October 21, and deorbit occurred at 09:47.

It was the second ballistic entry reported by the Soviets, Soyuz 1 being the first (although Soyuz 18a was a <b>ballistic</b> <b>reentry,</b> and Soyuz 24 reportedly also was one).|$|E
40|$|A common {{approach}} followed in state estimation of <b>reentry</b> <b>ballistic</b> targets is to formulate the problem where the process model {{is written in}} the Earth fixed inertial frame, where as the measurement model is written in the body frame of the interceptor. In such a formulation, to relate the states with the measurement vector, a transformation matrix is required to transform {{the position and velocity}} vectors from inertial frame to body frame and vice-versa. This matrix is constructed using the attitude quaternion information of the interceptor as obtained from its inertial navigation system. In a practical situation, however, when the time of flight is high, the navigation error build up is usually large, which introduces large errors in the transformation matrix. Due to this, the performance of the estimator is found to be not very good, even though the seeker gives good measurement data. To avoid this problem, a new estimation formulation is proposed in this paper, where the process model is written in the body frame of the interceptor. This formulation needs body rate information of the interceptor instead of the attitude quaternion, which does not degrade much with the time of flight. Hence, this new formulation is quite effective in estimating the target states accurately, thereby improving the mission performance substantially, even in presence of large navigation errors in the attitude quaternion. Extensive simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach...|$|R
40|$|A novel Inatable Aerodynamic Decelerator (IAD) and {{platform}} for multi-pointmeasurements in the ionosphere, has been evaluated in the REXUS (Rocket-bourneEXperiments for University Students) program. The experiment, named LAPLander(Light Airbag-Protected Lander), was launched from Esrange 4 th of March 2010 to analtitude of 88 km. LAPLander is a 3. 043 kg right-circular cylinder with {{a diameter of}} 24 cm and a length of 8. 4 cm when the IAD is folded inside. At ejection LAPLanderis spin stabilized around its polar axis with 3. 5 - 4 Hz. Contact was lost after ejectionwhich points to an electrical failure. This thesis presents {{an evaluation of the}} LAPLander IAD and a 6 Degrees-Of-Freedom (6 -DOF) ight analysis. The 6 -DOF simulation indicates that LAPLanderwould start to wobble, but if the rotation around its polar axis is decreased morethan estimated, it will start to autorotate. Perhaps with high enough angular rate todemand special precautions if a parachute is {{to be used as a}} mean of recovery. TheLAPLander IAD is designed to deploy at 6 km altitude. If the IAD was inated inspace instead, the resulting reduction in the <b>ballistic</b> factor at <b>reentry</b> would save masson the heat protection system, and thus save mass on the overall recovery system. AnIAD derived from the LAPLander IAD capable of a 250 km apogee reentry will beprovided. The IAD incorporate CO 2 cartridges to inate the system, these do each containa CO 2 valve. A pre-launch valve failure resulted in that LAPLander ew without aworking IAD. The valves are based on the principle that resistors heat Field's metalabove 62 C (the melting temperature). The main mechanism of the valve failure seemsto be brittle creep in the Field's metal at this point.

40|$|Hot {{structures}} made {{of ceramic}} matrix composites (CMC) for space reentry vehicles {{play a key}} role regarding the feasibility of advanced and reusable future space transportation systems. Thus realization of applicable flight hardware concerning hot primary structures like a nose cap or body flaps and thermal protection systems (TPS) requires system competence w. r. t. sophisticated know how in material processing, manufacturing and qualification of structural components and in all aspects from process control, use of NDI techniques, arc jet and hot structure testing. However, the most important issue to realize hot primary structures for operational space reentry vehicles is validation of materials and design concepts via real flight testing due to limitations of any existing ground based testing facility or validation methodology. So this has been the strategy of DLR since one decade and multiple reentry flight tests with samples and structural components have been performed until now. Coated and uncoated C/C-SiC specimens were integrated into the ablative heat shield of Russian FOTON capsules and they were tested during two missions in 1992 and 1994. Following on, a hot structure experiment called CETEX which principally was a kind of a little nose cap had been developed and tested during the EXPRESS mission in 1995. These three flight tests were the first ones in Europe carried out with such a kind of material and hot structural concept and many lessons were learned w. r. t. material behaviour and structural design performance under the severe environmental conditions of <b>ballistic</b> capsule <b>reentry.</b> Within an ESA program called FESTIP we developed a new design concept for a rigid surface TPS based on CMCs which should be adaptable to the outer side of a cryogenic tank structure of a future SSTO vehicle. Special TPS concept features are (flat) integrally stiffened CMC panels, hot CMC fasteners for outside attachment capability, thermal displacement compensation, sealing and insulation, provision of a purge gap etc. Based on this concept a flight experiment was realized featuring all principal design aspects mentioned before and adding three different anti oxidation coating systems. The experiment again will be integrated into the heat shield of a Russian FOTON capsule and the mission is planned for October 2002. On the longer run we started to follow a new approach based on the idea of using flat panels for a TPS instead of trying to realize continuous shaped surfaces which is todays design. So the vehicles surface will look facetted and various questions w. r. t. design, manufacturing, heat loads at edges, change of the vehicles aerodynamic properties etc. arise. Just now a flight experiment called SHEFEX (SHarp Edge Flight EXperiment) is in the definition phase and flight is scheduled to 2004. The nose cap development for NASAs X- 38 would have been the most ambitious flight experiment until now and our flight hardware was finished and installed successfully to the flight vehicle V 201 in October 2001. However as the X- 38 project has been stopped just now and other publications already described the development of the nose cap system it will not be focused on within this paper. Highlighting the most important technical issues and achievements of the flight experiments performed so far and reporting about ongoing plannings finally will provide a good insight into DLRs past and future development road map w. r. t. CMC hot structures and TPS for space reentry vehicles...|$|R
