25|$|Although blind {{students}} {{have benefited from}} talking calculators, the abacus is still very often taught to these students in early grades, both in public schools and state schools for the blind. The abacus teaches mathematical skills {{that can never be}} replaced with talking calculators and is an important learning tool for blind students. Blind students also complete mathematical assignments using a braille-writer and Nemeth code (a type of braille code for mathematics) but large multiplication and long division problems can be long and difficult. The abacus gives <b>blind</b> <b>and</b> <b>visually</b> <b>impaired</b> <b>students</b> a tool to compute mathematical problems that equals the speed and mathematical knowledge required by their sighted peers using pencil and paper. Many blind people find this number machine a very useful tool throughout life.|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I present accessories, {{techniques}} and systems which enable the <b>blind</b> <b>and</b> <b>visually</b> <b>impaired</b> {{to move in}} urban traffic. The <b>blind</b> <b>and</b> <b>visually</b> <b>impaired</b> participate in traffic as pedestrians, passengers in cars and in means of public transport etc. This thesis is therefore designed so that it covers all these fields.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to determine what could be done at botanic gardens to enhance the experiences of <b>blind</b> <b>and</b> <b>visually</b> <b>impaired</b> visitors. This was done by determining ifthere is a discrepancy between what <b>blind</b> <b>and</b> <b>visually</b> <b>impaired</b> individuals feel would enhance their experience versus what botanic gardens are doing or would do to achieve the same means. Once findings were analyzed, recommendations were made as to what botanic gardens could do to enhance the experience of <b>blind</b> <b>and</b> <b>visually</b> <b>impaired</b> visitors. Whether or not there was a discrepancy was determined through surveys administered to botanic gardens <b>and</b> <b>blind</b> <b>and</b> <b>visually</b> <b>impaired</b> individuals in a sixstate region. Observations also were made regarding botanic gardens that currently have features installed to enhance the experience of <b>blind</b> <b>and</b> <b>visually</b> <b>impaired</b> visitors through field trips. The findings indicated a discrepancy between what <b>blind</b> <b>and</b> <b>visually</b> <b>impaired</b> respondents desired <b>and</b> what botanic gardens thought should be implemented in botanic gardens to enhance the experiences of <b>blind</b> <b>and</b> <b>visually</b> <b>impaired</b> individuals. The <b>blind</b> <b>and</b> <b>visually</b> <b>impaired</b> respondents primarily desired audio stimuli while the botanic gardens desired features that would serve all visitors and be relatively easy to install. The findings also indicated that plant handling should be allowed {{and that there is a}} need for diversity of features in order to enhance the visit of all types of <b>visually</b> <b>impaired</b> visitors to the botanic garden...|$|R

50|$|According to Michael J.Bina, the 12th {{president}} of MSB since 2008, public schools cannot fully support {{students with visual}} impairments because they have not learned or been trained how to. He states that despite the government’s efforts to make all children regardless of disability feel welcomed and accepted in public schools, “schools for the blind and visually impaired continue to be relevant… The services of these institutions help visually handicapped students to gain access in normal educational settings. They provide the necessary support for attaining skills that would complement the ones they learn from public schools.” Therefore to accomplish this standard that President Bina has set for schools that intend to help the visually impaired, the Maryland School for the Blind, along with many other institutions for the blind, incorporate the Expanded Core Curriculum. Of course these schools teach subjects that are taught in public schools, such as history, math, English, etc, but they are known as the core curriculum. The Expanded Core Curriculum’s aim is to teach students the life skills that will help them become proficient in their core curriculum and eventually live well off on their own. The ECC covers nine aspects that the students need to learn: compensatory or functional academic skills, orientation and mobility, social interaction skills, independent living skills, recreation and leisure skills, career education, use of assistive technology, sensory efficiency skills, and self-determination. Each aspect focuses on a specific set of skills. The orientation and mobility aspect, for example, teaches students how to get around private and public environments - their own home, restaurants, parks, etc., special techniques - trailing, techniques on self-defense, cane skills, etc., and how to travel in unfamiliar or dangerous terrain - revolving doors, iced sidewalks, etc. Then there is the social interaction skills. It may sound unnecessary to those without any visual impairment, but the seeing learn social cues, such as gestures, the meaning of certain facial expressions, body positions, and movements, through what they see and hear. They are able to associate reactions and expressions to certain concepts even if they are not doing so intentionally. Understandably, the visually impaired cannot learn social skills through this method of sight. Therefore, the ECC carefully teaches the <b>blind</b> <b>and</b> <b>visually</b> <b>impaired</b> <b>students</b> numerous socials skills so that they can interact with those around them whether they be blind or not.|$|E
