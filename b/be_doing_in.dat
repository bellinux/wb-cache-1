5|$|Schafer {{stated that}} they began the {{development}} with the character of Eddie, and recognizing what he should <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> <b>in</b> the game—specifically, swinging around his axe, playing his guitar, and driving his hot rod. Once they found this combination of elements to work well in combat and general gameplay, {{they were able to}} expand {{out the rest of the}} game from there, as these elements provided a means of testing the game to make sure it remained enjoyable. The first major feature developed for the game was the multiplayer element, given that no previous game from Double Fine had included this feature, and was the highest risk element to the game.|$|E
5|$|When {{this episode}} was being produced, The Bachelorette was a {{bigger and more}} {{prolific}} program than when this episode was originally broadcast. In addition, ABC was not doing very well {{at the time of}} this episode's production. The production staff encountered some trouble when deciding what Peter would <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> <b>in</b> the lobby with Cleveland during his Bachelorette audition; although the series could never come up with ideas they deemed to be suitable, they intended for Peter to put his buttocks in an aquarium tank in order to embarrass Cleveland and make him want to leave. This scene was not used, and the production staff used a scene of Peter putting his naked buttocks on Cleveland's naked buttocks; they also shortened this more detailed version and used the less-detailed current version.|$|E
500|$|Growing up in a Jewish-American {{household}} {{where the}} parents demanded high achievement, Juster was intimately familiar with expectations, though {{in his case}} many of his parents' hopes were centered on his older brother, an academic star. The Terrible Trivium, the well-dressed, polite demon who sets the questers to mindless tasks, was Juster's way of representing his own tendency to avoid what he should <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> <b>in</b> favor of a more congenial occupation, such as his evasion of the grant project to write The Phantom Tollbooth. Juster drew on Feiffer's life experiences as well; the Whether Man's adage [...] "Expect everything, I always say, and the unexpected never happens" [...] was {{a favorite of the}} cartoonist's mother.|$|E

500|$|Lutyens' [...] {{memorial}} in Ayscoughfee Hall gardens was constructed by Hodson Limited of Nottingham, {{at the south}} end of the formal gardens, replacing an earlier castellated tower—a 19th-century folly known as the [...] "Owl Tower". The unveiling took place at a ceremony on 9 June 1922, presided over by General Sir Ian Hamilton and dedicated by Reverend Alfred Jarvis, Assistant Chaplain-General to Northern Command. Barbara McLaren attended the ceremony along with several other members of the Jekyll and McLaren families. Several dignitaries gave speeches at the ceremony, including Jarvis, who spoke of the dead among the poppies on the Western Front, a [...] "symbol of oblivion". Hamilton spoke of the results of the carnage of the war; referring to the idea that the First World War was the war to end war, he told the assembled: [...] "The result has been so different. Europe is a seething cauldron of racial hatred; Ireland [...] is linked in our minds with the idea of murder; Mesopotamia , India, and Egypt are straining at the leash of civilisation." [...] The general concluded: [...] "If you want to end war, you must end hatred" [...] and that [...] "In that way, I believe we shall be working towards peace, and in that way we will <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> <b>in</b> our own small way our best each of us—and Spalding minds united are a great force—and in that way we shall perpetuate the memories of those whose untimely deaths we have come here to commemorate". At the conclusion of the speeches a lone bugler played the [...] "Last Post" [...] and the crowd sang the national anthem, after which the dignitaries—including McLaren and her sons—laid floral tributes around the Stone of Remembrance.|$|E

2500|$|Heery, Simms, Simpson, Delbridge, and Salmon {{assert that}} the {{organizing}} model has several key advantages that distinguish it from the servicing model, such {{as the fact that}} the organizing model promotes [...] "systematic," [...] proactive, and well-thought out campaigns, which help the union's goals get satisfactorily and pragmatically achieved. More broadly, one of the obvious advantages of the organizing model is that it allows workers to actually be involved in the campaigns that most closely affect them, promoting both equity and equality. In addition, the organizing model, as opposed to the servicing model, provides for the union's future by broadening its support from the workers and giving them a sense of investment into the day-to-day functions of the union itself. Bob Carter and Rae Cooper, in their research about British trade unions and their use of the organizing model, state that, within the unions themselves, there was praise for the organizing model because it upheld the [...] "...core role of trade unions". This is to say that the British union members felt the organizing model adhered to what unions should <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> <b>in</b> regard to their members.|$|E
