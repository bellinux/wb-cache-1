25|$|Povenmire {{and others}} have {{proposed}} {{the existence of an}} additional tektite strewn field, the Central American strewn field. Evidence for this reported tektite strewn field consists of tektites recovered from western Belize {{in the area of the}} villages of <b>Bullet</b> <b>Tree</b> Falls, Santa Familia and Billy White. This area lies about 55nbsp&km east-southeast of Tikal where 13 tektites, two of which were dated as being 820,000 years old, of unknown origin were found. A limited amount of evidence is interpreted as indicating that the proposed Central American strewn field likely covers Belize, Honduras, Guatemala, Nicaragua and possibly parts of southern Mexico. It is speculated that the hypothesized Pantasma Impact Crater in northern Nicaragua might be the source of these tektites.|$|E

It was in this park that that fellow with an unpronounceable name made the attempt upon the Russian Czar's life last spring with a pistol.

Now in America that interesting tree would be chopped down or forgotten within the next five years, but it will be treasured here.

2500|$|Sergeant Buckland {{had given}} {{evidence}} on 3 March {{that he had}} investigated Dala and his evidence was so disparaging to Gribble's claims for the site that Commissioner Wood visited Dala on the 14th to see for himself. From what he found, Wood had no hesitation in declaring Buckland unreliable and less than candid with the commission and confirmed Gribble's account. The rainy season was late and the ash and footprints were still present and clearly visible (the first rain of the season fell {{the day after the}} Commission left). Sergeant Buckland had claimed that when he visited the site he found no evidence of a police camp, Wood found the site strewn with empty food cans and tobacco tins which he regarded as evidence of a police camp. A partially burnt tree surrounded by ash was peppered with what Gribble claimed were bullet scars but which Buckland had testified were marks made by stones or other blunt objects. Recalled by Wood, Buckland admitted that one of the marks had been a bullet scar and that Quartpot, a police tracker, had later dug a bullet from it which Wood asked to be produced. Constable Donegan, who had taken possession of the bullet, had said that he was not certain if he could find it, however it was found and given to Wood. Later, Inspector Douglas said that the bullet looked like a [...]44, the same caliber as the police issue Winchester although lighter in weight, but stated that it would be impossible for a bullet to pass through a human body and lodge in a tree behind it. Green noted that the Winchester rifle was a popular model carried by travelers in the area and that <b>bullets</b> extracted from <b>trees</b> in the Kimberley did not necessarily come from police rifles. At the subsequent trial of Regan and St Jack, Buckland repeated his testimony that there was no police camp at Dala, the tree scars had been made by a stone and the recovery of the bullet was never brought up.|$|R

60|$|The warriors, {{as soon as}} this {{interruption}} had ceased, {{resumed their}} places, and again prepared to exhibit their skill. As there was a double object in view, that of putting the constancy of the captive to the proof, and that of showing how steady were the hands of the marksmen under circumstances of excitement, the distance was small, and, in one sense, safe. But in diminishing the distance taken by the tormentors, the trial to the nerves of the captive was essentially increased. The face of Deerslayer, indeed, was just removed sufficiently from the ends of the guns to escape the effects of the flash, and his steady eye was enabled to look directly into their muzzles, as it might be, in anticipation of the fatal messenger that was to issue from each. The cunning Hurons well knew this fact, and scarce one levelled his piece without first causing it to point as near as possible at the forehead of the prisoner, in the hope that his fortitude would fail him, and that the band would enjoy the triumph of seeing a victim quail under their ingenious cruelty. Nevertheless each of the competitors was still careful not to injure, the disgrace of striking prematurely being second only to that of failing altogether in attaining the object. Shot after shot was made; all the bullets coming in close proximity to the Deerslayer's head, without touching it. Still no one could detect even the twitching of a muscle {{on the part of the}} captive, or the slightest winking of an eye. This indomitable resolution, which so much exceeded everything of its kind that any present had before witnessed, might be referred to three distinct causes. The first was resignation to his fate, blended with natural steadiness of deportment; for our hero had calmly made up his mind that he must die, and preferred this mode to any other; the second was his great familiarity with this particular weapon, which deprived it of all the terror that is usually connected with the mere form of the danger; and the third was this familiarity carried out in practice, to a degree so nice as to enable the intended victim to tell, within an inch, the precise spot where each bullet must strike, for he calculated its range by looking in at the bore of the piece. So exact was Deerslayer's estimation of the line of fire, that his pride of feeling finally got the better of his resignation, and when five or six had discharged their <b>bullets</b> into the <b>tree,</b> he could not refrain from expressing his contempt at their want of hand and eye.|$|R

50|$|The site's bird life, Morelet's crocodiles, {{lepidoptera}} and odonata {{have been}} examined, along with adjacent waterways {{further down the}} Canal and along the Haulover Creek. Overall, about 50 birds were recorded. Meerman also includes incidental notes on plants and mammals encountered. Results from studies suggest that sites adjacent to the current reserve, namely the Haulover Creek and Burdon Canal between Jones and Northern Lagoon, contain higher biodiversity than the reserve itself. The land cover of the reserve and surrounding area has been mapped and is shown on large scale colour air photos held by the Forest Department. The reserve's vegetation is almost entirely Red Mangrove, with a belt of mixed freshwater swamp species such as <b>Bullet</b> <b>Tree</b> around Fabers Lagoon.|$|E
5000|$|The El Pilar Archeological Reserve for Maya Flora and Fauna {{is open to}} {{the public}} and has a series of trails {{providing}} access throughout the site. Tourists can take a taxi from <b>Bullet</b> <b>Tree</b> Falls directly into the Maya site. Intrepid visitors [...] can experience both ancient and contemporary aspects of Maya life promoting Maya culture in the area. There is an active initiative to make El Pilar of Belize and Guatemala the first archaeological peace park in the world. While El Pilar is protected in Belize and Guatemala and rangers are on site, it remains under threat by looters and was placed on the World Monument Fund's 1996 list of 100 Most Endangered Sites in the World. Ford’s conservation strategy, called Archaeology Under the Canopy, promotes the conservation of ancient Maya monuments in the context of their natural environmental context. Sheltered under the forest canopy after 1000 years of neglect, El Pilar and all the Maya monuments are best maintained in the shade. This preserves Maya cultural heritage along with the forest gardens the Maya created.|$|E
50|$|The fungal {{pathogen}} Cristulariella depraedans {{is found}} in Europe and North America and mostly affects trees in the genus Acer. Trees affected in Germany and Britain are primarily the sycamore (A. pseudoplatanus) and the Norway maple (A. platanoides), while in North America the most affected are A. platanoides, the red maple (A. rubrum), the sugar maple (A. saccharum), the silver maple (A. saccharinum), the mountain maple (A. spicatum) and the vine maple (A. circinatum). In British Columbia {{it has also been}} reported on goatsbeard (Aruncus), and in South and Central America on the <b>bullet</b> <b>tree</b> (Bucida buceras). Studies in Germany between 1996 and 1999 extended the host range and a study published in 2000 recorded the pathogen's occurrence on 21 species of woody and herbaceous plants outside the maple group. It was shown to be present in Poland in a study lasting from 1996 to 2006, and beside Acers, the host range there included hornbeam (Carpinus betulus), dogwood (Cornus sanguinea), hazel (Corylus avellana), beech (Fagus sylvatica), honeysuckle (Lonicera xylosteum), bird cherry (Prunus padus), pedunculate oak (Quercus robur) and lime (Tilia cordata). It is unclear whether this increased host range is because of more intensive study or whether environmental factors have encouraged the fungus to attack new hosts.|$|E
40|$|In December 2012 {{then in the}} {{following}} winter season, the occurrence of whitish mycelial coat was observed on the collar of 3 - to 6 -m high Bucida buceras trees grown in hydrocultures to decorate a spacious indoor community space in Vienna. (This plant [shown in Fig. 1] belongs to Combretaceae, Myrtales and commonly named black olive tree, <b>bullet</b> <b>tree,</b> gregorywood and oxhorn bucida.) The mycelium-infested area of the bark appeared to be water-soaked. Near {{the surface of the}} potting mix (earth ball embedded in clay pebbles), the roots were also covered with whitish mycelia (Fig. 2). Over the winter season when the indoor temperature increased from 20 °C to 25 °C, these symptoms were unnoticeable. Regardless of the season, the rhizosphere contained numbers of sclerotia, dark-grey, globose and 8 – 12 mm in diameter that occasionally developed rhizomorph-like mycelial cords. Direct plating of mycelium fragments from the bark and sclerotia from the rhizosphere onto potato dextrose agar amended with ampicillin (500 mg/l) eventually yielded pure fungal cultures of similar characteristics. Cultures routinely incubated in the dark developed white and submerged colonies with sparse aerial mycelia. The fungus grew well between 10 °C and 25 °C, and failed to grow at either 5 °C or 32 °C. The optimal growth was measured at 20 °C with an average radial growth rate of 11 mm per day. After 10 to 12 days, a ring of sclerotia begun to develop {{near the edge of the}} colonies; they turned dark grey and sized 3 – 8 mm. Rather misleadingly, neither conidia, nor sexual spores were observed in these cultures. However, when the fungus was cultured in natural light under laboratory conditions at 25 °C, a completely different colony pattern was observed; it was cottony, greyish then dark grey, and produced abundant hyaline conidia borne on grey, branching tree-like conidiophores. Conidia were one-celled and egg-shaped, and their dimensions fell in the range of 9. 89 – 14. 63 (11. 48 ± 0. 31) µm× 7. 05 – 10. 05 (8. 31 ± 0. 20) µm. These features concurred with those characterising the polyphagous grey mould fungus Botryotinia fuckeliana (anamorph: Botrytis cinerea) (Elad et al., 2007). The ITS 1 /ITS 2 including the 5. 8 S subunit of rDNA of one of the isolates were amplified with primers ITS 1 -F/ITS 4, then the PCR products were sequenced. The ITS sequence determined in this way was identical to known sequences of B. fuckeliana strains, e. g. that of CBS 131. 28 (GenBank accession number: KF 859918), the type material of Botrytis cinerea f. lini, DAOM 231372 (GenBank accession number: KF 859924) and so on. Pathogenicity tests resulted in rapidly (within 2 weeks) developing disease symptoms around the site of wound inoculation with a 5 -mm-diametre mycelial agar plug: fruit rot on apple and lemon in the laboratory, and sunken lesions on stems of hydrocultured ornamental plants such as the herbaceous Monstera deliciosa and the woody Dracena marginata. To fulfill Koch’s postulates, the fungus was re-isolated from symptomatic apple fruit, and was found to exhibit the afore-mentioned morpho-physiological characteristics. Inoculation test on Bucida was not performed because of the costly risk i. e., the sale price of the trees is € 3 to 10 thousand. Consequently, the actual sensitivity of Bucida to grey mould remains uncertain, so much the more because this plant species has not been recorded as a host of the pathogen or other important parasitic fungi in natural (subtropical) environment (e. g. Whelburg et al., 1975). To our knowledge, this report is the first description of Botryotinia fuckeliana on Bucida buceras. In addition to the fact that periodic emergence of fungal mycelia on the trunk impairs the tree’s aesthetic appearance, the sclerotia resting in the potting mix may cause more serious problems in the long term. However, it cannot be precluded that the elevated indoor temperature reduces disease progression and thus the economic importance of the pathogen on this plant...|$|E
