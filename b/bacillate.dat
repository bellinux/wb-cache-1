This disease has become very dangerous because the whole quantity of about 180 t of potatoes was completaby destroyed. From the infected potato tubers there was isolated a fungus which has shown a pathogenicity against the potato tubers, as well as against the roots, underground and basal stem of the potato plants. This fungus has been well developed on the potatodextrose and malt extract aqar. Its mycelium is whitish-rose to pale brown and loose, it is being developed by medium speed and it has separated a brown pigment which colours the medium. It forms a lot of pycnidia which average about 212 μ (from 103 up to 295 μ). Conidia are one-celled, hyalin, oblong or <b>bacillate</b> with rounded ends, average abaut 6, 9 x 2, 9 μ (they vary 5, 0 - 8, 7 x 2, 5 - 3, 4 μ). It has been concluded {{that the cause of}} potato gangrene in Yugoslavia belong to the species Phoma foveata foister. As synonyms of this species there should be concidered: Phoma tuberosa Mehlus, Roseubaum et Schultz, Phoma solanicola Prill. et Del. f. foveata (Foister) Malcolmson and Phoma exigua Desm. var. foveata (Foister) Boerema...|$|E

The nasal discharge which occurs is heavily <b>bacillated</b> and is the most potent source of exit of Mycobacterium leprae from the body. The necessity for early diagnosis and treatment of leprosy {{in the absence of an}} effective vaccine is discussed and the pathological changes that occur in the nose are outlined. The roles which the leprologist and the rhinologist are able to play are mentioned...|$|R
