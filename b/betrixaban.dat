50|$|<b>Betrixaban</b> (INN, codenamed PRT-054,021) is an {{anticoagulant}} drug which {{acts as a}} direct factor Xa inhibitor. It is potent, orally active and highly selective for factor Xa, being selected {{from a group of}} similar compounds for its low hERG affinity. <b>Betrixaban</b> has undergone human clinical trials for prevention of embolism after knee surgery, and prevention of stroke following atrial fibrillation, with promising results. <b>Betrixaban</b> is currently being studied in a human clinical trial for extended duration thromboprophylaxis to prevent venous thromboembolism in acute medically ill patients. Joint development with Portola was discontinued in 2011 by Merck. <b>Betrixaban</b> is now being developed by Portola Pharmaceuticals; the drug received FDA approval on June 23rd, 2017.|$|E
50|$|Rivaroxaban, apixaban and {{edoxaban}} {{are already}} on the market. As of October 2016, several new direct Xa inhibitors have entered clinical trials. These are <b>betrixaban</b> from Portola Pharmaceuticals, letaxaban from Takeda and eribaxaban from Pfizer.|$|E
50|$|A {{new series}} of oral, direct-acting inhibitors of Factor Xa have entered {{clinical}} development, and are competitors of dabigatran, which is a direct thrombin (factor IIa) inhibitor. These include rivaroxaban (Xarelto) from Bayer, apixaban (Eliquis) from Bristol-Myers Squibb, <b>betrixaban</b> from Portola Pharmaceuticals, darexaban (YM150) from Astellas, edoxaban (Lixiana) from Daiichi, otamixaban by Sanofi, and more recently letaxaban (TAK-442) from Takeda and eribaxaban (PD0348292) from Pfizer.|$|E
50|$|Recently a {{new series}} of specific, direct acting inhibitors of Factor Xa has been developed. These include the drugs rivaroxaban, apixaban, <b>betrixaban,</b> LY517717, darexaban (YM150), {{edoxaban}} and 813893. These agents have several theoretical advantages over current therapy. They may be given orally. They have rapid onset of action. And they may be more effective against Factor Xa in that they inhibit both free Factor Xa and Factor Xa in the prothrombinase complex.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} {{anticoagulants}} inhibit {{the activity of}} Factor Xa. Unfractionated heparin (UFH), low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), and fondaparinux inhibit the activity of factor Xa indirectly by binding to circulating antithrombin (AT III). These agents must be injected. Warfarin, phenprocoumon, and acenocoumarol are orally active vitamin K antagonists (VKA) which decrease hepatic synthesis {{of a number of}} coagulation factors, including Factor X. In recent years, a new series of oral, direct acting inhibitors of Factor Xa have entered clinical development. These include rivaroxaban, apixaban, <b>betrixaban,</b> LY517717, darexaban (YM150), and edoxaban (DU-176b).|$|E
50|$|Drugs such as rivaroxaban, apixaban and {{edoxaban}} work by inhibiting factor Xa directly (unlike the heparins and fondaparinux, which work via antithrombin activation).Also <b>betrixaban</b> from Portola Pharmaceuticals, darexaban (YM150) from Astellas, {{and more}} recently letaxaban (TAK-442) from Takeda and eribaxaban (PD0348292) from Pfizer. The development of darexaban was discontinued in September 2011: in a trial for prevention of recurrences of myocardial infarction in top of dual antiplatelet therapy, the drug did not demonstrate effectiveness {{and the risk of}} bleeding was increased by approximately 300%. The development of letaxaban was discontinued for acute coronary syndrome in May 2011 following negative results from a Phase II study.|$|E

Unfractionated heparin, low-molecular-weight heparin, and warfarin have been the cornerstone of VTE prevention and treatment but are being replaced by recently approved non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) : dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban. The NOACs {{are at least as}} effective and as safe as heparins and warfarin for VTE prevention and treatment and are more convenient because they have a low propensity for food and drug interactions and are given in fixed doses without routine coagulation monitoring. The remaining limitations of currently available NOACs include their dependence on renal and hepatic function for clearance, and the lack of an approved antidote. <b>Betrixaban</b> is a new NOAC with distinct pharmacological characteristics: minimal renal clearance, minimal hepatic metabolism, and long half-life. It has undergone successful Phase II studies in orthopedic thromboprophylaxis, and in stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation. Currently, it is being evaluated in a Phase III trial of extended thromboprophylaxis in medical patients (APEX study). In this article, we describe the development of <b>betrixaban,</b> review its pharmacological profile, discuss the results of clinical trials, and examine its potential for VTE prevention and treatment.

40|$|Background/Aims: Venous {{thromboembolism}} (VTE) is {{the most}} common complication after major joint surgery. VTE can easily develop into pulmonary embolism (PE), leading to cardiopulmonary dysfunction or sudden death. We aimed to comprehensively analyse the thromboprophylactic drugs that are used to prevent thrombosis and reduce bleeding risk. Methods: We searched the PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases for randomized controlled trials that evaluated the use of thromboprophylaxis after major joint surgery. The major outcomes were the numbers of all-cause VTE and bleeding events, and the secondary outcomes were major VTE and major bleeding/clinically relevant non-major bleeding events. A random-effects network meta-analysis was used to assess the effectiveness and tolerability of each anticoagulant after major joint surgery. Results: We included 104 trials that assessed 110, 643 patients in our meta-analysis. The cluster ranking of major outcomes indicated that FXI-ASO, ardeparin, aspirin, and apixaban were ideal for preventing all-cause VTE and avoiding all bleeding events. Nadroparin, recombinant hirudin, and rivaroxaban effectively inhibited VTE but were associated with a high risk of bleeding. For secondary outcomes, we found that <b>betrixaban,</b> dalteparin, warfarin, and eribaxaban were ideal for preventing major VTE and reducing major bleeding, while rivaroxaban effectively inhibited major VTE but was associated with a high risk of major/clinically relevant non-major bleeding. A sensitivity analysis showed that the effect of apixaban was more robust for major outcomes, while aspirin was more robust for preventing all-cause bleeding events. In secondary outcomes, the effect of warfarin was more robust, while apixaban was still considered an ideal treatment to inhibit major VTE and bleeding events. Conclusion: Our study indicates that FXI-ASO, ardeparin, aspirin, and apixaban are ideal for preventing all-cause VTE and reducing all bleeding events, among which apixaban {{is the most}} reliable. <b>Betrixaban,</b> dalteparin, warfarin, and eribaxaban are ideal for preventing major VTE and reducing major/clinically relevant non-major bleeding events, among which warfarin is the most reliable...|$|E
40|$|International audienceVenous {{thromboembolism}} (VTE) is {{a serious}} disease that is often neglected, and effective and safe antithrombotic treatments are a public health priority. New antithrombotics such as rivaroxaban, apixaban, <b>betrixaban,</b> edoxaban, darexaban, TAK- 442, LY 517717, eribaxaban, otamixaban are being developed to overcome current therapeutic limitations. The new oral anticoagulants and parenteral otamixaban are under evaluation in clinical trials for VTE treatment, for VTE prevention in orthopedic surgery, for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation and for cardiovascular event prevention in patients with acute coronary syndrome. These antithrombotic agents directly and selectively inhibit factor Xa, and do not require coagulation monitoring and dose adjustment. Several of these drugs have shown promising results and {{have the potential to}} either replace or act as alternatives to traditional anticoagulants (heparins, vitamin K antagonists) ...|$|E
40|$|Well-documented {{drawbacks}} {{of traditional}} anticoagulants have {{lead to the}} quest for an ideal anticoagulant resulting in a surge of novel anticoagulant molecules. These newer agents directly target specific steps in coagulation cascade and include newer low molecular weight heparins (adomiparin), ultra low molecular weight heparins (semuloparin, RO- 14), inhibitors of activated factor II (dabigatran, AZD 0837), X (rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, <b>betrixaban),</b> IX (REG 1, 2), XI (antisense oligonucleotides, BMS 262084, clavatadine A), VII/tissue factor (tifacogin, PCI 274836, and BMS 593214), V (recomodulin, solulin), VIII (TB 402), dual thrombin/factor X inhibitors (EP 21709, tanogitran), and newer vitamin K antagonists (tecarfarin).

40|$|Atrial {{fibrillation}} {{is already}} the most common clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia and a common cause of stroke. Vitamin K antagonists are very effective {{for the prevention of}} cardioembolic stroke but have numerous limitations that limit their uptake in eligible patients with AF and reduce their effectiveness in treated patients. Multiple new anticoagulants are under development as potential replacements for vitamin K antagonists. Most are small synthetic molecules that target factor IIa (e. g., dabigatran etexilate, AZD- 0837) or factor Xa (e. g., rivaroxaban, apixaban, <b>betrixaban,</b> DU 176 b, idrabiotaparinux). These drugs have minimal protein binding and predictable pharmaco-kinetics that allow fixed dosing without laboratory monitoring and are being compared with vitamin K antagonists or aspirin in phase III clinical trials.

40|$|Atrial {{fibrillation}} (AF) is {{the most}} common cardiac rhythm disorder and a major risk factor for ischemic stroke. Antithrombotic therapy using aspirin or vitamin K antagonists (VKA) is currently prescribed for prevention for ischemic stroke in patients with AF. A narrow therapeutic range and the need of regular monitoring of its anticoagulatory effect impair effectiveness and safety of VKA, causing a need for alternative anticoagulant drugs. Recently developed anticoagulants include direct thrombin antagonists such as dabigatran or factor Xa inhibitors such as rivaroxaban, apixaban, <b>betrixaban,</b> and edoxaban. Currently, data from a phase III clinical trial are available for dabigatran only, which show the direct thrombin antagonist to be at least noninferior in efficacy to VKA for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with AF. This review focuses on current advances in the development of directly acting oral anticoagulant drugs and their potential to replace the VKA class of drugs in patients with AF.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of novel anticoagulants has had contrasting {{effects on the}} agents in the pipeline, fueling the development of some and sinking the others. The complexity of the coagulation cascade offers interesting inhibition choices that might become valid treatment options. AREAS COVERED: This review will highlight some of the anticoagulants in the pipeline. Following {{the success of the}} direct thrombin and FXa inhibitors already in the market, new agents are being tested. These include AZD 0837, <b>betrixaban,</b> letaxaban, darexaban, and LY 517717. Targeting other components of the hemostatic pathway might lead to better safety profiles without influencing efficacy. Inhibitors to FVIIa-tissue factor (FVIIa/TF) complex, FIX, FXI, and FXII are being assessed. New inspiring inhibitors are antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) and aptamers. These are highly specific agents with readily reversible effect and might be engineered to inhibit any coagulation factor. Currently tested ASOs and aptamers are inhibitors of FXI, FXII, thrombin, FIXa, and platelet GPIV. EXPERT OPINION: Some of the agents in the pipeline offer valid treatment option for long-term therapy, overcoming some of the drawbacks of the novel anticoagulants. Research is being driven by an expanding market in the anticoagulation field that has been unexploited for a long time...|$|E
40|$|Atrial {{fibrillation}} (AF) is a {{major risk}} factor for stroke. Currently, acetylsalicylic acid (a platelet inhibitor) and vitamin K antagonists (VKAs; oral anticoagulants), including warfarin, are the only approved antithrombotic therapies for stroke prevention in patients with AF. Although effective, VKAs have unpredictable pharmacological effects, requiring regular coagulation monitoring and dose adjustment to maintain effects within the therapeutic range. The clinical develop-ment pathway for novel anticoagulants often involves evaluation of efficacy and safety in a short-term indication, such as the prevention of venous thrombo-embolism (VTE), followed by longer-term VTE treatment studies, and finally chronic indications, including stroke prevention studies in patients with AF. The coagulation pathway provides many targets for novel anticoagulants, including Factor Xa (FXa) and Factor IIa (thrombin). Numerous oral, direct FXa inhibitors are {{in various stages of}} clinical development, including rivaroxaban, LY 517717, YM 150, DU- 176 b, apixaban, and <b>betrixaban,</b> and are anticipated to overcome the limitations of VKAs. Dabigatran is the only oral direct thrombin inhibitor in late-stage development. Studies of these agents for stroke prevention in patients with AF are planned or ongoing. If approved, they may represent the next generation of anticoagulants, by providing new therapeutic options for stroke prevention in patients with AF...|$|E
40|$|Venous {{thromboembolism}} (VTE) is a common, potentially fatal, and underestimated condition {{occurring in}} 1 per 1000 patients per year worldwide. 1 - 3 VTE is related either to trauma and immobilization or to increased blood coagulability. Venous thrombosis and VTE are also common after {{certain types of}} operations (eg, orthopedic surgery of the lower extremities). 1 - 3 In many cases, however, VTE is idiopathic. Several drugs are available for the prevention/treatment of venous thrombosis and VTE, namely unfractionated (UFH) or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), fondaparinux, and oral vitamin K antagonists (ie, warfarin and acenocumarol). 2, 3 These anticoagulants are effective, but they require parenteral administration (UFH, LMWH, and fondaparinux) and/or frequent anticoagulant monitoring (eg, for oral vitamin K antagonists). Novel anticoagulants in clinical testing {{for the prevention of}} VTE include orally active direct factor II inhibitors (dabigatran etexilate), parenteral direct factor II inhibitors (flovagatran sodium), orally active direct factor X inhibitors (rivaroxaban, apixaban, <b>betrixaban),</b> and ultra-LM WH. 2, 3 Dabigatran etexilate and rivaroxaban are already approved for use in atrial fibrillation. In addition, rivaroxaban is approved for VTE prevention following hip and knee replacement surgery.

40|$|Venous {{thromboembolism}} (VTE), encompassing deep {{vein thrombosis}} and pulmonary embolism, represents {{a major cause of}} morbidity and mortality in patients with cancer. Low molecular weight heparins are the preferred option for anticoagulation in cancer patients according to current clinical practice guidelines. Fondaparinux may also have a place in prevention of VTE in hospitalized cancer patients with additional risk factors and for initial treatment of VTE. Although low molecular weight heparins and fondaparinux are effective and safe, they require daily subcutaneous administration, which may be problematic for many patients, particularly if long-term treatment is needed. Studying anticoagulant therapy in oncology patients is challenging because this patient group has an increased risk of VTE and bleeding during anticoagulant therapy compared with the population without cancer. Risk factors for increased VTE and bleeding risk in these patients include concomitant treatments (surgery, chemotherapy, placement of central venous catheters, radiotherapy, hormonal therapy, angiogenesis inhibitors, antiplatelet drugs), supportive therapies (ie, steroids, blood transfusion, white blood cell growth factors, and erythropoiesis-stimulating agents), and tumor-related factors (local vessel damage and invasion, abnormalities in platelet function, and number). New anticoagulants in development for prophylaxis and treatment of VTE include parenteral compounds for once-daily administration (ie, semuloparin) or once-weekly dosing (ie, idraparinux and idrabiotaparinux), as well as orally active compounds (ie, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, <b>betrixaban).</b> In the present review, we discuss the pharmacology of the new anticoagulants, the results of clinical trials testing these new compounds in VTE, with special emphasis on studies that included cancer patients, and their potential advantages and drawbacks compared with existing therapies...|$|E
40|$|Atrial {{fibrillation}} (AF) {{is associated}} with an increased risk of thromboembolism, and is the most prevalent factor for cardioembolic stroke. Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) have been the standard of care for stroke prevention in patients with AF since the early 1990 s. They are very effective for the prevention of cardioembolic stroke, but are limited by factors such as drug-drug interactions, food interactions, slow onset and offset of action, haemorrhage and need for routine anticoagulation monitoring to maintain a therapeutic international normalised ratio (INR). Multiple new oral anticoagulants have been developed as potential replacements for VKAs for stroke prevention in AF. Most are small synthetic molecules that target thrombin (e. g. dabigatran etexilate) or factor Xa (e. g. rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, <b>betrixaban,</b> YM 150). These drugs have predictable pharmacokinetics that allow fixed dosing without routine laboratory monitoring. Dabigatran etexilate, the first of these new oral anticoagulants to be approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency for stroke prevention in patients with non-valvular AF, represents an effective and safe alternative to VKAs. Under the auspices of the Regional Anticoagulation Working Group, a multidisciplinary group of experts in thrombosis and haemostasis from Central and Eastern Europe, an expert panel with expertise in AF convened to discuss practical, clinically important issues related to the long-term use of dabigatran for stroke prevention in non-valvular AF.
