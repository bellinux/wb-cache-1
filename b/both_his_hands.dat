25|$|Peter grew to be {{extremely}} tall as an adult, especially for the time period. Standing at 6ft 8in (203cm) in height, the Russian tsar was literally {{head and shoulders above}} his contemporaries both in Russia and throughout Europe. Peter, however, lacked the overall proportional heft and bulk generally found in a man that size. <b>Both</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> and feet were small, and his shoulders were narrow for his height; likewise, his head was small for his tall body. Added to this were Peter's noticeable facial tics, and he may have suffered from petit mal, a form of epilepsy.|$|E
25|$|More recently, another {{starting}} position choice has been allowed, {{known as the}} optional offensive {{starting position}} or optional start. After the wrestler with the choice (the offensive wrestler) indicates his intention to the referee, the referee lets the defensive wrestler adjust and begin in the defensive starting position. Next, the offensive wrestler goes {{to either side of}} the defensive wrestler or behind him, with all his weight supported by both his feet or by one or both knees. The offensive wrestler would then place <b>both</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> on the opponent's back between the neck and the waist. When the referee starts the match by blowing the whistle, the defensive wrestler then has the opportunity to get back to his feet in a neutral position. Any of the starting positions may be used to resume action during a period when the wrestlers go off the mat, depending on the referee's judgment as to whether any or which wrestler had the position of advantage.|$|E

500|$|In Manadhai Thirudivittai (2001), Valayapathi (Vivek) {{pretends to}} have lost <b>both</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands.</b> His lover then {{promises}} {{to take care of}} him. The song [...] "Kanne Kalaimane" [...] is heard as the background music for the scene. In a comedy scene from Run (2002), Mohan (Vivek) imitates Haasan's mannerisms from the climax scene in Moondram Pirai to make his friend Shiva (R. Madhavan) recognise him but fails. In a similar scene from the Malayalam film Kochi Rajavu (2005), Harisree Ashokan's character uses the same mannerisms to make Dileep's character recognise him.|$|E
500|$|Shia Muslims, however, do not esteem {{him because}} they believe that he helped Abu Bakr in suppressing the {{supporters}} of Imam Ali who, according to them, was appointed by Muhammad as his political and religious successor. He killed Malik ibn Nuwayrah, and [...] "married" [...] his beautiful wife on the same day, Layla bint al-Minhal, which violated the sharia law. Shias also criticize him for fiercely opposing the message of Islam and fighting the Prophet Muhammad and Ali, for example, at the Battle of Uhud. As mentioned in Sahih al-Bukhari, he was sent by Muhammad to deal with the Arab tribe Jadhima. There, he fought them and ordered killing of all the captives, which was met with opposition and protests from other Muslims. Upon hearing about his actions, Muhammad raised <b>both</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> and said twice, “O Allah! I am free from what Khalid has done.” ...|$|E
500|$|Atomic Fiction {{created a}} freeway {{environment}} for the [...] "Twelve Bullets Fight", with a backdrop based on Detroit, Chicago, and Vancouver. The vendor also created the vehicles in the sequence. These assets were used by Blur for the opening titles, which moves through a frozen moment where Deadpool is fighting thugs inside a crashing car. It includes titles such as [...] "Directed by an overpaid tool" [...] and [...] "Produced by asshats", with Reynolds, Miller, and the writers coming {{up with their own}} credits in the hope of setting the tone {{for the rest of the}} film. Luma contributed blood and gore to the film, using practical footage as well as digital effects for more complex scenes. When Deadpool cuts off his own hand, DD did not want to be [...] "outdone" [...] by Luma, and had [...] "buckets of blood pouring out". Luma created the regrowing hand, inspired by the hand of a fetus. When Deadpool breaks <b>both</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands,</b> DD went through 20 or 30 different versions of what broken fingers could look like. For his initial scarring, Rodeo FX referenced rotting fruit and maggot-eaten meat. The company added a CG penis to Reynolds in the sequence, which [...] "you don't even notice [...] when it wasn't there it looked really weird". Rodeo also augmented the practical fire in the scene.|$|E

I have done wrong, I have transgressed, I have sinned before You, I and my house. O Lord! Forgive the wrongdoings, the transgressions, and the sins that I have committed, transgressed, and sinned before You, I and my house, as it is written in the Torah of Moses Your servant (in [...] ): [...] "For on this day shall atonement be made for you to cleanse you; from all your sins shall you be clean before the Lord."

2500|$|Considered {{by many in}} {{the media}} to be the current best goalkeeper in the world, and one of the {{greatest}} goalkeepers both of his generation and of all time, Neuer is widely regarded as a [...] "complete" [...] and modern goalkeeper; he is regarded by some in the sport to be the best goalkeeper in football since Lev Yashin, who is widely considered to be the greatest goalkeeper of all time, and is so far the only goalkeeper to have won the Ballon d'Or. A tall, large, and physically strong player, Neuer has earned critical acclaim from former players and pundits for his speed, stamina, composure, concentration, consistency, and mentality, as well as for being able to adapt to any given situation on the pitch. He is particularly known for his exceptional reflexes, shot-stopping abilities, speed, and footwork, as well as his ability to read the game, and come out to collect crosses, which enables him to command his area effectively. When the situation demands, he will also often essentially fill the role of a sweeper when opposing players have beaten the offside trap or his team's defensive line, by quickly rushing out of goal to anticipate opponents and clear the ball; his skill in this area enables his teams to maintain a high defensive line. Because of his unique playing style, Neuer {{has been described as a}} [...] "sweeper-keeper", and has been credited with revolutionising the role of the goalkeeper in modern times. Furthermore, he is effective at both stopping and scoring from penalties. Although he has been praised for his positioning and ability in one-on-one situations, certain pundits have also cited these aspects of his game as areas for improvement, however. In addition to his goalkeeping ability, Neuer has also been praised for his excellent ball control and for his accurate distribution of the ball with <b>both</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> and feet; his long throwing range and ability to kick the ball into deep areas with either foot enables him to the play the ball out on the ground or create plays or launch swift counter-attacks from the back. Regarding his skill on the ball in comparison to other players in his role, Neuer has stated that he could play in the German third division as a centre-back if so desired. Due to his leadership and vocal presence in goal, he also excels in organising his team's defensive line.|$|E
