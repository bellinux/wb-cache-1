To provide a single image of such clusters to users and utilize them in an integrated manner, cluster-of-clusters has been suggested. However, since research groups usually {{do not have the}} actual <b>backbone</b> <b>networks</b> for cluster-of-clusters, which can be reconfigured with respect to delay, packet loss, etc. as needed, it is not feasible to carry out practical research over realistic environments. Accordingly, the demand for an efficient way to emulate the <b>backbone</b> <b>networks</b> for cluster-of-clusters is overreaching. In this paper, we suggest a novel design for emulating the <b>backbone</b> <b>networks</b> of cluster-of-clusters. The emulator named NemC can support the fine-grained network delay resolution minimizing the additional overheads.

The destination PE router then decapsulates the traffic and forwards it to the CE router at the destination.

40|$|From {{the optical}} {{networking}} perspective, the future Internet {{may be viewed}} as a three-level hierarchy consisting of <b>backbone</b> <b>networks,</b> metropolitan area networks, and local access networks, as illustrated in Fig. 1. The <b>backbone</b> <b>networks</b> will provide abundant bandwidth by employing wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) links that are interconnected with reconfigurable optical add-drop multiplexers (OADMs) and optical cross connects [1]. The metropolitan area networks, or metro networks for short, interconnect the <b>backbone</b> <b>networks</b> with the local access networks. The local access networks carry the data from and to the individual users. By employing advanced LAN technologies, such as Gigabit Ethernet (GbE), and broadband access, such as xDSL and cable modems, access networks provide increasing amounts of bandwidth. Most existing metro networks are based on synchronous optical network with synchronous digital hierarchy (SONET/SDH) technology, a circuit-switched networking technology.

40|$|There {{is a great}} {{interest}} today in voice communication over the Internet (VoIP). If the Internet were to become the universal network for all communications needs, and thus were to displace the telephone network for voice communication, it must be capable of providing {{the same level of}} service quality as the telephone network. Today, this {{does not seem to be}} the case. VoIP is plagued with packet loss and variable packet delay in the network. Although measures are taken to overcome these problems (e. g., loss concealment and adaptive playout), their effectiveness is limited to certain ranges of network conditions. Thus it is of great importance to understand the packet loss and delay characteristics of today's Internet, in order to understand the effectiveness of the measures introduced to overcome the impairments. To that end, we examine in detail measurements of packet loss and delay taken over the Internet, and give a characterization thereof. We then comment on the impact that they can have on the quality of VoIP, and on the effectiveness of the measures introduced to minimize their impact. This study is limited to measurements taken only on Internet <b>backbone</b> <b>networks,</b> which represent important components in long distance communication. It reveals that packet loss and delay characteristics are not consistent across all <b>backbone</b> <b>networks.</b> Some <b>backbone</b> <b>networks</b> exhibit fairly good characteristics and may offer good quality communication, leading to a confirmation that packet voice is a sound approach.
