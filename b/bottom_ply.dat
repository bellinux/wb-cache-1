According to the results, thread tension has significant effect on thread consumption for chain-stitch 401.|$|E
40|$|Clamped {{circular}} graphite/epoxy plates (25. 4, 38. 1, and 50. 8 mm radii) with an 8 -ply quasi-isotropic layup {{were analyzed}} for static-equivalent impact loads using the minimum-total-potential-energy method and the von Karman strain-displacement equations. A step-by-step incremental transverse displacement procedure {{was used to}} calculate plate load and ply stresses. The ply failure region was calculated using the Tsai-Wu criterion. The corresponding failure modes (splitting and fiber failure) were determined using the maximum stress criteria. The first-failure mode was splitting and initiated first in the <b>bottom</b> <b>ply.</b> The splitting-failure thresholds were relatively low and tended to be lower for larger plates than for small plates. The splitting-damage region in each ply was elongated in its fiber direction; the <b>bottom</b> <b>ply</b> had the largest damage region. The calculated damage region for the 25. 4 -mm-radius plate agreed with limited static test results from the literature...|$|E
40|$|Crack-free {{magnesium}} joints of AZ 31 {{magnesium alloy}} strips were produced using laser assisted self-piercing riveting (LSPR). Thermal analysis of LSPR, using modelling and temperature measurements by infra-red thermal imaging, {{indicated that the}} laser absorption was about 18 to 35 % depending on the surface preparation of the magnesium surface, and the thermal coupling between {{the top and bottom}} plies was about 70 %. Thus, cracking was prevented not only in the <b>bottom</b> <b>ply,</b> but also in the top ply, and crack-free AZ 31 joints as thick as 6. 6 mm could be produced within 5 s cycle time. It was found that cracks during joining initiated in shear zones which formed due to limited dynamic recrystallisation (DRX) and strain localisation in regions of large and variable grain size. Since DRX is enhanced at higher temperatures, cracking was prevented by preheating to higher temperatures, up to a maximum temperature to avoid incipient melting and hot shortness. The strength of the joints was affected by the rivet length and hardness, which influenced the characteristics of the joints such as the interlock of the rivet leg into the <b>bottom</b> <b>ply.</b> Strength values as high as 5720 N and 7340 N were obtained for 4. 7 mm and 6. 4 mm thick joints respectively. Salt spray testing showed there was no corrosion issue for the various coated steel rivets, and little or no corrosion around the rivet head in either the steel or the magnesium, but significant corrosion occurred some distance from the coated rivet. Results highlighted the importance of improving the corrosion resistance of the magnesium and develop a suitable, production ready corrosion resistant system for magnesium sheet combinations...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the effect of}} misalignments in ply orientation, uniform variations in ply thickness, and through-thickness thermal gradients on the post-cure shape errors for symmetric cross-ply laminates constructed from ultra-thin composite materials. Photogrammetry-based surface measurements are performed for laminates cured at elevated temperatures. Significant out-of-plane shape errors are observed, with amplitudes âˆ¼ 75 times the laminate thickness. The magnitude of each imperfection is also characterized experimentally on coupon-level samples. A non-linear finite element model is developed and demonstrates that these imperfections result in cylindrical and twisting modes of deformation. Results are compared to Classical Lamination Theory predictions which are shown to be inadequate in predicting shape errors that require changes in Gaussian curvature. Through these studies, it is determined that thickness variations between the top and <b>bottom</b> <b>plies</b> have the most pronounced effect on shape errors...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} the APHID (Asynchronous Parallel Hierarchical Iterative Deepening) gametree search algorithm. An APHID search {{is controlled by}} a master {{and a series of}} slave processors. The master searches the first d 0 ply of the game-tree repeatedly. The slaves are responsible for the <b>bottom</b> <b>plies</b> of the game-tree. The slaves asynchronously read work lists from the master and return score information to the master. The master uses the returned score information to generate approximate minimax values, until all of the required score information is available. APHID has been programmed as an easy to implement, game-independent fffi library, and was implemented into a chess program with one day of programming effort. APHID yields reasonable performance on a network of workstations, an architecture where it is extremely difficult to use a shared transposition table efffectively. 1 Introduction The alpha-beta (fffi) minimax tree search algorithm {{has proven to be a}} difficult algori [...] ...|$|R
40|$|An {{analysis}} of delaminated composite plates with integrated active fibre composite (AFC) actuators and sensor under hygrothermal environment has been {{undertaken in the}} present work. The top and <b>bottom</b> <b>plies</b> of the laminate constitute AFC actuators and sensors. In the present investigation, hygrothermal loading is taken into consideration, {{and the effect of}} moisture and temperature on the delaminated plate structures is analysed. The minimum total potential energy approach is used for arriving at the governing equation. A finite element model for centrally located delamination is developed on the basis of first order shear deformation theory. An eight noded serendipity element with five degrees of freedom per node is considered for the finite element formulation. A parametric study on the effect of stacking sequence, boundary conditions and environmental conditions in the presence of delamination on the laminated plate is studied. The key observations from the parametric study are: there will be reduction in natural frequencies in the presence of delamination and/or hygrothermal loading, and reduction in structural stiffness due to the presence of delamination can be negated by applying voltage to the active fibre actuator layer...|$|R
40|$|Impact {{response}} of plywood laminate composites with imbedded glass and flax fibre fabrics utilising different adhesives were both experimentally produced and studied. Moreover the impact energy absorption of wood products as veneer, three and seven plies plywood and particle board were estimated. Therefore laminate composites {{were subjected to}} drop-weight tests with initial energy of 150 J and striker with diameter 20 mm {{in order to determine}} the impact force, energy absorption and deflection rate. Experimental results approved poor impact absorption properties for both single veneer ply and particle board, impact resistance was significantly higher in a plywood products. In combination with thermoplastic polymer and textile fabrics an absorbed energy of laminates was considerably enhanced. The highest specific absorbed energy values have been observed for plywood laminate produced by polyethylene adhesive and incorporating the glass fibre fabrics. During the drop-weight impact tests all samples were punctured, showing local damage in upper ply and much more extensive at the <b>bottom</b> <b>ply.</b> Damage extent was smaller in composite laminates reinforced with the fibre fabrics...|$|E
40|$|The {{spreading}} kinetics of {{drops of}} different liquids (water, glycerol and ethylene glycol) on {{different types of}} model papers have been investigated. In {{the first part of}} the investigation single ply and two-ply papers, made from pulps with different degrees of beating, were investigated. The results show that is very common the surface layer of the paper had a much larger influence on the spreading than the <b>bottom</b> <b>ply.</b> By normalising the data showing the drop radius as a function of time with the viscosity and surface tension of the liquids all data collapse onto a master curve. The results from {{the first part of the}} investigation also show that in order to determine a contact angle between the liquid and the paper the drop volume should remain constant and the contact angle should be determined when the drop has reached its equilibrium volume. In the second part of the investigation the influence of surface topography and surface energy of the papers on the spreading kinetics was determined. The results show that when the pattern of use, the avails on the surface creates fine capillaries the contact angle is decreased compared to the situation with a flat surface. For papers with a higher roughness the uneven structure creates barriers against the spreading which increases the contact angle compared to the situation with a flat surface. A simple attempt to fit the data to a power law based on a hydrodynamic approach was also conducted. The results from this treatment show that it is possible to get a good match for the sheets with virtually only surface spreading. The constants achieved in this treatment can be used to rationalise the spreading data to be compared with other investigations.

40|$|There are {{a number}} of {{important}} technologies that are required for magnesium to be taken up in structural applications. CAST research has focused on a number of these in the value chain. One of the key developments required is new wrought alloys that are more easily processed and have superior properties to the current suite of wrought Mg alloys. A new alloy has been developed that can be extruded more than twice as fast as AZ 31 with similar strength and better ductility. Furthermore, the processability rivals 6000 series Al alloys and better specific strength and ductility. The alloy has been developed primarily for extrusion but could also be used in sheet applications. A key enabling technology required for the uptake of magnesium alloys is joining. Self-pierce riveting (SPR) is a promising solid state joining technique for magnesium, especially for spot joining to dissimilar metals because the formation of brittle inter-metallic phases encountered in fusion joining such as resistance spot welding is avoided. However, while SPR joining of aluminium intensive car, truck and recreational vehicle bodies is well established with over 10 years of commercial application in the automotive industry, SPR joining of magnesium needs further development to prevent cracking of magnesium, especially when placed on the bottom {{in the design of the}} joint. This is because magnesium alloys are generally not ductile enough at room temperature to be joined mechanically by processes such as SPR and clinching which involve forming and plastic deformation. CAST has proven that laser assisted self piercing riveting is able to produce crack free joints of high integrity, even when Mg alloys are on the <b>bottom</b> <b>ply.</b> Another important area of consideration is the deformation of magnesium alloys in crash situations. It has been shown that many magnesium alloys tend to have large plastic hinges upon deformation due to their high work hardening rates. This shows great advantages in some situations where deformation occurs in a larger volume and hence more energy is absorbed. However, this same phenomenon can also cause fracture when the plastic hinge is forced to be a lower radius of curvature than the alloy would naturally bend. Hence, magnesium alloys will provide the greatest benefit when used in applications where deformation is not constrained or global buckling is the most likely deformation mechanism...|$|E

The loads are pressure and temperature which varies from 21 to 65. 5 C (case I) and from 143. 3 to 21 C (case II). An integrated computer code {{is used for}} the simulation of the damage progression. Results show that damage initiation begins at low load level, with matrix cracking at the 0 deg.

30|$|In this example, {{the impact}} energy of 7.35 Â J was {{selected}} to simulate the damage evolution process in the cross-ply laminate since 90 Â° matrix cracking was the main damage mode expected with crack induced delamination (the impact energy is too low to cause fibre breakage). Matrix cracking was initially formed in the <b>bottom</b> 90 Â° <b>ply</b> with few cracks found in the middle 90 Â° plies, in Fig. 7 a. As the impactor further contacted the composite laminate the surface indentation was formed with a bending crack, appearing on the top 0 Â° surface ply due to concentrated compressive load, while complete cracks through {{the thickness of the}} 90 Â° layers were developed accompanied by delamination at the 0 / 90 interfaces, in Fig. 7 b. As the impact event progressed, the growth rate of cracks in the middle and <b>bottom</b> 90 Â° <b>plies</b> was found to decrease, while the projectile rebound occurred, in Fig. 7 c. The simulation showed that cracks started to close once the complete rebound was reached, in Fig. 7 d with extensive delamination that matched the detected result by X-ray radiography.|$|R
50|$|The first Type IV {{had a pair}} of floats, about 7.8 m and 3.1 m apart, single stepped, round topped in {{cross-section}} and with hard chine but almost flat bottoms. These were mounted on an axle just forward of the wing leading edge, supported at its centre by a V-strut from the lower fuselage longerons and at its extremities by struts at about 45Â° to the same points. Under the trailing edge a W-form strut linked the longerons and floats, allowing passage for bombs released from the central fuselage underside. Vertical legs transmitted landing forces to the lower wing just inboard of the folding line. The floats were made of spruce and ply covered; on the planing <b>bottoms</b> the <b>ply</b> was 8 mm thick. A second example, the IVbis, had a single central main float, suitable for catapult launching, and a small, stabilizing float under each wing.|$|R
40|$|An {{approximate}} {{method is}} developed {{to investigate the}} interlaminar stresses near the free edges of beam-type composite laminate structures subjected to out-of-plane shear/bending. The method is based upon admissible function representations for in-plane stresses that contain a linear variation in the longitudinal direction. Closed-form solutions of all stress components are sought by minimizing the complementary energy {{with respect to the}} unknown functions. The resulting solutions satisfy the stress equilibrium, compatibility, and all of the boundary conditions. Numerical examples are given for both cross-ply and angle-ply laminates. It is found that interlaminar stresses under the shear/bending, particularly those for angle-ply laminates, may exhibit substan-tially different characteristics than under uniaxial loading or under pure bending.
