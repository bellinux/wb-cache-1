25|$|The {{newspaper}} {{is a general}} Sunday newspaper, covering news and politics. It is published in five sections: News, Sport, <b>Business,</b> <b>Property,</b> and Living, {{as well as a}} magazine section. In terms of news, while the newspaper maintains a broadsheet outlook, it has come in for much criticism lately due to its increasing emphasis on lifestyle features in the main section. It has also been criticised for regularly tending towards sensationalism, and for the often opinion-focused, rather than news-focused nature of its articles. It is probably better described as a middle-of-the-road newspaper, rather than a newspaper of record. In the 1980s and 1990s, the Deputy Editor was Anne Harris.|$|E

Central City continued with its plans for a south access highway despite {{the city of}} Black Hawk acquiring land {{in the path of the}} proposed road. The issue was brought before a Denver grand jury that decided Black Hawk officials had misspent taxpayer money. Central City then sued Black Hawk for $100 million; Black Hawk countersued.
