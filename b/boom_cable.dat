50|$|The {{indicator}} loop cables {{were laid}} in a miniature indicator loop pattern with legs 40 yards apart, from RAN Station 9 to Fisherman Islands. If a submerged submarine {{was detected by}} RAN Station 9 a signal would be transmitted to RAN Station 8, the Boom Defence Facility at Fort Lytton, to raise the <b>boom</b> <b>cable.</b> HMAS Kinchela was permanently moored in the Brisbane River {{as part of this}} Boom Defence system. The indicator loop was completed by HMAS Bangalow by early March 1943.|$|E
50|$|X-Force {{was created}} by {{illustrator}} Rob Liefeld after he started penciling The New Mutants comic book in 1989 with #86. The popularity of Liefeld’s art led to him taking over the plotting duties on the book. With help from writer Fabian Nicieza, who provided the dialogue for Liefeld’s plots, Liefeld transformed the New Mutants into X-Force in New Mutants #100, the book's final issue. Liefeld and Nicieza launched X-Force in August 1991. Rob Liefeld obtained the name for the series from an unknown artist at a convention a few months prior to its release. With {{the aid of a}} multiple-variant poly-bagged card, the book sold a record 5 million copies, and remains the second highest selling American comic book of all time, surpassed only by Jim Lee's X-Men book that same summer with 8 million copies. The original line-up of the team included Boom <b>Boom,</b> <b>Cable,</b> Cannonball, Domino, Feral, Shatterstar and Warpath. In later issues, X-Force's roster would include Siryn, Rictor and Sunspot.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. For present-day bridges. cable {{tensions}} test is a {{vitally important}} job in course of construction. The tensions condition of cables plays an especially {{important part in}} the course of construnction and operation. In order {{to ensure the safety of}} operation and lengthen the service life,the exact testing result is being required to obtain. In cable stayed bridges and arch bridges, the boundary condition as well as the bending rigidity has an greater effect on the cable forces testing of the short boom. This paper based on Additional Mass Method,using the method of GA-BP Neural network after Genetic Algorithm optimization to identify the cable forces of short boom and a preferable research result is obtained. Summary This paper briefly describes the linear vibration theory and cable vibration equation, its solution gives the frequency equations under three boundary conditions, and focus on analysing impact due to the bending stiffness of the cable. A brief introduction to the basic theory of the Additional Mass method, based on the added mass method, using Neural network toolbox to predict the <b>boom</b> <b>cable</b> force can achieve the target. However it requires a large amount of data and the iteration is slow as well as unstable. In this paper, BP Neural network method was optimized with the Geneti...|$|E

60|$|So Trent, {{with his}} back against the wall and not a friend to help him, faced for twenty-four hours the most {{powerful}} bull syndicate which had ever been formed against a single Company. Inquiries as to his right of title had poured in upon him, and to all of them he had returned the most absolute and final assurances. Yet he knew when closing-time came, that he had exhausted every farthing he possessed in the world--it seemed hopeless to imagine that he could survive another day. But with the morning came a <b>booming</b> <b>cable</b> from Bekwando. There had been a great find of gold before ever a shaft had been sunk; an expert, from whom as yet nothing had been heard, wired an excited and wonderful report. Then the men who had held on to their Bekwandos rustled their morning papers and walked smiling to their offices. Prices leaped up. Trent's directors ceased to worry him and wired invitations to luncheon at the West End. The bulls were the sport of everybody. When closing-time came Trent had made 100,000 pounds, and was looked upon everywhere as one of the rocks of finance.|$|R

Two cables pass around pulleys to form six links between the payload and boom. A linearization of the pulley mechanics was derived to create finite element models of the system. The models were experimentally verified and used to explore variations of the suspension geometry. Several crane concepts which use the suspension are discussed and illustrated...|$|R
50|$|Most {{models of}} the Zipper follow a similar basic format: A long, rotating, oval <b>boom</b> with a <b>cable</b> around its edge that pulls 12 cars around the ride. Except at peak times, most {{operators}} will only fill half of the cars at one time with riders. Like most carnival equipment, the ride {{is designed to be}} portable; it can be disassembled onto a truck and transported from site to site.|$|R
40|$|The GEOS <b>cable</b> <b>boom</b> {{mechanism}} {{allows the}} controlled deployment of a 20 m long cable in a centrifugal force field. In launch configuration the flat cable is reeled on a 240 mm diameter drum. The electrical {{connection between the}} rotating drum and the stationary housing is accomplished via a flexlead positioned inside the drum. Active motion control of this drum is achieved by a self locking worm gear, driven by a stepper motor. The deployment length of the cable is monitored by an optical length indicator, sensing black bars engraved on the cable surface...|$|R
50|$|The slave (the actual {{subject of}} dr.ir. Van den Bedem's thesis) is a robotic arm frame which can {{accommodate}} three independent manipulators (two for surgical tools, {{one for a}} camera). The frame for the manipulators is of the type used for pick-and-place robots, allowing the manipulators full freedom of motion in space. This means that the surgeon can also choose the optimal direction of approach for any organ, {{rather than having to}} move the patient to suit the machine. Of course the manipulators also provide force feedback through the overhead <b>cable</b> <b>boom.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Usually, non-anamorphic 4-perf {{films are}} filmed {{directly}} on the entire full frame silent aperture gate (1.33:1). When a married print is created, this frame is slightly re-cropped by the frame line and optical soundtrack down to Academy ratio (1.37:1). The movie projector then uses an aperture mask to soft matte the Academy frame to the intended aspect ratio (1.85:1 or 1.66:1). When the 4:3 fullscreen video master is created, many filmmakers may prefer to use the full Academy frame ("open matte") instead of creating a pan and scan version from within the 1.85 framing. Because the framing is increased vertically in the open matte process, {{the decision to use}} it needs to be made prior to shooting, so that the camera operator can frame for 1.85:1 and [...] "protect" [...] for 4:3; otherwise unintended objects such as <b>boom</b> microphones, <b>cables,</b> and light stands may appear in the open matte frame, thus requiring some amount of pan and scan in some or all scenes. Additionally, the unmatted 4:3 version will often throw off an otherwise tightly-framed shot and add an inordinate amount of headroom above actors (particularly with 1.85:1).|$|R
2500|$|Not to be {{confused}} with the 1893 invention with the same name, the [...] "Zipper" [...] is an amusement-thrill ride popular at carnivals and amusement parks in the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. It features strong vertical G-forces, numerous spins, and a noted sense of unpredictability. The ride's basic format is a long, rotating, oval <b>boom</b> with a <b>cable</b> around its edge that pulls 12 cars around the ride. The Zipper is designed to be transportable and assembled from site to site. The Zipper was invented in 1968 by Joseph Brown of Chance Morgan. Since this time, more than 200 rides have been built and distributed all over the world, making it one of the most mass-produced and modern-day rides of all time.|$|R
40|$|This report {{details the}} {{development}} of a tool to remove objects and debris from a large gearbox found on ships of the United States Navy, specifically to be used by NAVSEA. The tool is to be used in situations where an object or contaminant cannot easily be removed or found without completely disassembling the gearbox. This will be done using a <b>boom</b> arm, a <b>cable,</b> a gripper and a borescope. This combination will allow for a large amount of mobility and versatility when searching for the object or contaminant, which is necessary for use in different gearboxes. The process we followed to arrive at our final design can be found below. This includes background research, similar product comparison, concept generation and detailed design, followed by prototype construction and testing...|$|R
50|$|The main {{difference}} between a swing yarder and a tower yarder is that the upperworks is mounted on a large slewing bearing. This bearing permits the <b>boom</b> and <b>cable</b> system to be 'swung' across a setting without relocating the machine. An experienced operator uses timing and cable tension to swing the grapple to the desired location. In practice, however, the main benefit of a swinging machine is that once the logs are yarded up to the machine, they can be swung {{to the side and}} landed. This allows the machine to be positioned in a small area such as on a road, and to land (set down) the logs on the road behind (or in front of) the machine. By contrast a tower has no options on where to set the logs---so the tower has to be positioned back from the break of the hill so as to leave a landing area on the downhill side of the machine, the logs can only be pulled up to near the tower and then lowered to the ground making it necessary for a shovel (log loader) to also be present to remove the logs once landed. Implicitly a swing machine {{does not need to be}} as tall as a tower machine particularly in steep ground because the swing machine can be set right up to the 'edge' of the steep ground while the tower must be set back from the 'edge' to allow landing space.|$|R
5000|$|In his {{interview}} with CNN, Jessy Grizzle stated {{that this kind of}} technology could be useful for firefighting situations in which firefighters believe no one is in a burning house but surveillance is necessary. Later in {{his interview}}, he also added that the innovative control feedback algorithms could play a role in aiding paralyzed people. He said that the feedback algorithms would be necessary to successfully engineer exoskeletons, mechanical systems that attach to the human body to aid muscle movements. Grizzle is currently collaborating with Jonathan Hurst from the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon to create a new bipedal robot named [...] "MARLO". Instead of walking and running in 2D while connected to a boom, MARLO will move in 3D. A robot in 3D means that the robot would be free-standing without a safety <b>boom</b> or safety <b>cable.</b> During testing in 2013, MARLO took 15 successful steps with no boom to stable itself.|$|R
