In 2016, Messi was second on Forbes list of the world's highest-paid athletes (after Cristiano Ronaldo) with income of $81.4 million from his salary and endorsements in 2015–16. Since 2008, he has been Barcelona's highest-paid player, receiving a salary that increased incrementally from €7.8million to €13million over the next five years. His current salary of €20million net (€36million <b>before</b> <b>taxes),</b> established in 2014, is the highest ever in the sport. In addition to his salary and multimillion-euro bonuses, much of his income derives from endorsements; SportsPro has consequently cited him as one of the world's most marketable athletes every year since their research began in 2010. His main sponsor since 2006 is the sportswear company Adidas. As Barça's leading youth prospect, he had been signed with Nike since age 14, but transferred to Adidas after they successfully challenged their rival's claim to his image rights in court. Over time, Messi established himself as their leading brand endorser; from 2008, he had a long-running signature collection of Adidas F50 boots, and in 2015, he became the first footballer to receive his own sub-brand of boots, the Adidas Messi.|$|E

25|$|Income {{inequality}} in the United States has increased significantly since the 1970s after several decades of stability, meaning {{the share of}} the nation's income received by higher income households has increased. This trend is evident with income measured both <b>before</b> <b>taxes</b> (market income) as well as after taxes and transfer payments. Income inequality has fluctuated considerably since measurements began around 1915, moving in an arc between peaks in the 1920s and 2000s, with a 30-year period of relatively lower inequality between 1950–1980.|$|E

25|$|There is {{significant}} and ongoing debate {{as to the}} causes, economic effects, and solutions regarding income inequality. While before-tax income inequality is subject to market factors (e.g., globalization, trade policy, labor policy, and international competition), after-tax income inequality can be directly affected by tax and transfer policy. U.S. income inequality is comparable to other developed nations <b>before</b> <b>taxes</b> and transfers, but is among the worst after taxes and transfers. Income inequality may contribute to slower economic growth, reduced income mobility, higher levels of household debt, and greater risk of financial crises and deflation.|$|E

25|$|Measured for all households, U.S. income {{inequality}} {{is comparable to}} other developed countries <b>before</b> <b>taxes</b> and transfers, but is among the highest after taxes and transfers, meaning the U.S. shifts relatively less income from higher income households to lower income households. Measured for working-age households, market {{income inequality}} is comparatively high (rather than moderate) {{and the level of}} redistribution is moderate (not low).

25|$|According to the CBO, {{the major}} reason for {{observed}} rise in unequal distribution of after-tax income {{was an increase in}} market income, that is household income <b>before</b> <b>taxes</b> and transfers. Market income for a household is a combination of labor income (such as cash wages, employer-paid benefits, and employer-paid payroll taxes), business income (such as income from businesses and farms operated solely by their owners), capital gains (profits realized from the sale of assets and stock options), capital income (such as interest from deposits, dividends, and rental income), and other income. Of them, capital gains accounted for 80% of the increase in market income for the households in top 20%, in the 2000–2007 period. Even over the 1991–2000 period, according to the CBO, capital gains accounted for 45% of the market income for the top 20% households.|$|E

Each variable will be compared and analysed during the 5 year-period, 2006 - 2010. ENGRO being the largest company by total assets over 3 years (2006, 2007 and 2008) had more expenses, low sales, low profit <b>before</b> <b>tax</b> and return on assets compared to the other thirteen companies. FCC being the second largest company by assets showed high sales, profit <b>before</b> <b>tax</b> and return on asset in 5 years (2006 - 2010).
