30|$|Until 2006, a “bad weather-component” {{was also}} part of the AZR. The number of lost hours and the {{affected}} employees due to <b>bad</b> <b>weather</b> were recorded {{to the extent that the}} BA paid benefits until 2006. The loss of working hours through <b>bad</b> <b>weather</b> was by definition only possible in the construction sector. In 2007 the <b>bad</b> <b>weather</b> compensation (Winterbauförderung) was replaced by the seasonal short time working allowance (see above). Therefore the time-series on working hours lost due to <b>bad</b> <b>weather</b> end in 2006 (see Appendix A, Table A. 1) and are captured in line with the total short time working allowance component from 2007 on.|$|R

A technique for dehazing the <b>bad</b> <b>weather</b> images is presented. In this proposed approach, the polarized images {{are used to}} obtain the high contrast images. The input images are assumed composed by the direct light and airlight. The airlight {{is affected by the}} <b>bad</b> <b>weather</b> conditions, which makes the acquired image unclear. The key idea of the proposed method is to estimate and remove the airlight from the input images. The experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed method can effectively remove the <b>bad</b> <b>weather</b> condition and enhance the contrast of the input image...|$|R
