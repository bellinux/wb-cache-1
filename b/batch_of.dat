A follow-up <b>batch</b> <b>of</b> three locomotives (Nos. 6253–6255) {{was built in}} 1946 and this batch attracted an inflationary average cost of £15,460 each.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the structural, chemical and nutrient variation associated with different <b>batches</b> <b>of</b> original feedstock grain (wheat) and co-products (wheat distillers dried grain with solubles, wDDGS) from bioethanol processing and to study possibility of using molecular spectroscopy FT/IR-ATR technique as a rapid tool of identifying the structure spectral differences among the batches. The samples were collected from different <b>batches</b> <b>of</b> wheat and wDDGS produced from the same and newly build bioethanol plant in western Canada with updated bioethanol processing technology [...] The results of chemical composition analysis showed significant differences (P< 0. 05) among the <b>batches</b> <b>of</b> wheat and among the <b>batches</b> <b>of</b> wDDGS. The variation in term of range among the <b>batches</b> <b>of</b> wheat for crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fibre (NDF) and acid detergent fibre (ADF) were 2. 1, 2. 5 and 1. 0 %DM, respectively. Among the <b>batches</b> <b>of</b> wDDGS, the variation in CP, NDF and ADF were 3. 9, 5. 2 and 3. 8 %DM, respectively. The soluble crude protein (SCP) content ranged by 7. 2 % of CP among the <b>batches</b> <b>of</b> wheat and by 4. 2 % of CP among the <b>batches</b> <b>of</b> wDDGS. In mineral profiles, variation among the <b>batches</b> <b>of</b> wheat and wDDGS in sulfur were 0. 03 and 0. 34 % of DM, respectively. In mineral profiles, higher phosphorus and sulfur content associated with wDDGS could be a concern. The sulfur content ranged by 0. 3 % of DM among the <b>batches</b> <b>of</b> wDDGS with a mean of 1. 1 %DM. For the estimated subfractions with Cornell Net Carbohydrate and Protein System (CNCPS), the immediately rumen available PA fraction (NPN) ranged by 14. 8 % of CP among the <b>batches</b> <b>of</b> wheat and by 2. 7 % <b>of</b> CP among <b>batches</b> <b>of</b> wDDGS. The particle size analysis revealed the small particle size in all three <b>batches</b> <b>of</b> wDDGS with the geometric mean of ranging from 650 - 690 µm. In situ rumen degradation kinetic results showed a significant differences (P< 0. 05) among both wheat and wDDGS batches. Multivariate molecular spectral analyses showed a potential of using FT/IR molecular vibrational spectroscopy as a rapid method to identify structure difference associated with different batches. In conclusion, the structural, chemical and nutrient availability vary among the <b>batches</b> <b>of</b> wheat and among the <b>batches</b> <b>of</b> wDDGS. The molecular spectroscopy shows a potential as a rapid tool to identify batch difference in chemical and nutrient profiles and to detect the response of functional group to bioethanol processing. Further study is needed to analyse molecular spectral characteristics in details for development of a successful identification tool to identify batch differences. The variation among the <b>batches</b> <b>of</b> wDDGS should be considered in ration formulation especially at high inclusion rates (40 - 50 % wDDGS in diet DM) even the co-products are produced from the same bioethanol plant...|$|R
