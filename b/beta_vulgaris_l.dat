40|$|Abstract. The {{nutritive value}} of <b>Beta</b> <b>vulgaris</b> <b>L.</b> {{result mainly from}} its high content of protein {{gathered}} both in leaf blades and in petioles, and from high content of mineral salts, mainly iron and calcium, as well as vitamins C, A, B 1, B 2. Purpose of the research {{was to determine the}} effect of type potassium fertilizer (potassium chloride, potassium sulphate and potassium chloride + potassium sulphate in 1 : 1 K ratio) and different dose of potassium (0. 6; 1. 2; 1. 8 g·dm- 3) on the yield and chemical composition of <b>Beta</b> <b>vulgaris</b> <b>L.</b> The plants were cultivated in a greenhouse, in pots filled deacidified highmoor peat. Re-gardless of the type of potassium fertilizer, the yield of Beta leaves was the highest with the application of 0. 6 g K·dm- 3. Leaves of <b>Beta</b> <b>vulgaris</b> <b>L.</b> fertilized with potassium chlo-ride contained least nitrates, whereas plants fertilized with K 2 SO 4 and KCl + K 2 SO 4 con-tained much more nitrates. Increasing doses of potassium had a positive effect on the con-tent of vitamin C in the leaves. The research revealed a negative effect of increasing po-tassium dose on the plant unit weight, leaf length and percentage content of total nitrogen, protein and dry weight in leaves, especially at application of potassium chloride and po-tassium sulphate. The research showed the growth of potassium and total salt concentra-tion content in bedding as the effect of increasing potassium doses at the application of KCl and K 2 SO 4.

Ovary explants were cultured on Murashige & Skoog (MS) medium containing 2. 0 mg/l benzylaminopurine (BAP). Two treatments were tested by incubating all of the explants in darkness for 15 days, and then transferring one half to light and keeping the other half in darkness throughout the culture. Callus formation occurred in both treatments more or less at similar rates: however, {{there was a significant}} difference between the treatments with regard to the shoot-forming capacity of the explants, those transferred to light after an initial incbation in darkness producing more shoots (14. 6 %) than those kept in darkness continuously (4. 2 %). Root induction was readilyachieved within two weeks when shoots were transferred to MS medium supplemented with 2. 0 mg/l naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) and 2. 0 mg/l silver nitrate (AgNO 3). An inverse relationship between the callus and shoot-forming capacity of the individual explants was apparent.

40|$|During September 2011, post-emergence {{damping off}} of Swiss chard (<b>Beta</b> <b>vulgaris</b> subsp. cicla <b>L.)</b> was {{observed}} in a greenhouse in Villa del Prado (Spain). About 20 % of the seedlings showed damping off symptoms. Lesions were initially water soaked, dark brown necrosis of crown tissue, irregular in shape and sunken in appearance on large plants, causing the infected seedlings to collapse and eventually die. Rhizoctonia solani was isolated consistently from symp-tomatic plants. After morphological and molecular identification of the isolates, pathogenicity was tested by placing agar plugs of four isolates adjacent to the stem at {{the three or four}} true leaf stage. In inoculated plants, brown crown and stem necrosis occurred while control plants did not show disease symptoms. Pathogenicity using non-germinated seeds was also tested. All four isolates produced extensive damping off when inoculated on non-germinated seeds. To our knowledge, this is the first report of damping off of Swiss chard caused by R. solani in Europe.

40|$|The green beet (<b>Beta</b> <b>vulgaris</b> var. cicla <b>L.)</b> and red {{beetroot}} (B. <b>vulgaris</b> var. rubra <b>L.)</b> contain phytochemicals {{that have}} beneficial effects on human health. Specifically, the green beet contains apigenin, vitexin, vitexin- 2 -O-xyloside and vitexin- 2 -O-rhamnoside, while the red beetroot {{is a source}} of betaxanthins and betacyanins. These phytochemicals show considerable antioxidant activity, as well as antiinflammatory and antiproliferative activities. Vitexin- 2 -O-xyloside, in combination with betaxanthins and betacyanins, exerts antiproliferative activity in breast, liver, colon and bladder cancer cell lines, through the induction of both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways. A significant body of evidence also points to the role of these phytochemicals in the downregulation of the pro-survival genes, baculoviral inhibitor of apoptosis repeat-containing 5 and catenin beta- 1, as well as the genes controlling angiogenesis, hypoxia inducible factor 1 A and vascular endothelial growth factor A. The multi-target action of these phytochemicals enhances their anticancer activity. Vitexin- 2 -O-xyloside, betaxanthins and betacyanins can be used in combination with conventional anticancer drugs to reduce their toxicity and overcome the multidrug resistance of cancer cells. In this review, we describe the molecular mechanisms that enable these dietary phytochemicals to block the proliferation of tumor cells and inhibit their pro-survival pathways.

The isolated oil was tested for its antioxidant activity using the DPPH(.), ABTS(. +), catalase and paraoxonase assays and also for its cytotoxic, anticholinesterase and anti-tyrosinaseactivities. The essential oil exhibited high antioxidant activity (IC 50 = 0. 055 ± 0. 006 mg/mL) and important result oncatalase (524. 447 ± 2. 58 Units/mg protein). Furthermore, it exerted a significant cytotoxic effect against A 549 cell line, with IC 50 = 42. 44 ± 1. 40 μg/mL. The results indicate that the essential oil of B. <b>vulgaris</b> subsp. maritima (<b>L.)</b> Arcang. aerial parts may be used in future as an alternative to synthetic antioxidant agents, with potential application in the food and pharmaceutical industries.
