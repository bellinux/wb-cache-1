40|$|The {{research}} {{presented in}} this thesis describes how monolithic opto-electronic integration using quantum well intermixing (QWI) {{can be applied to}} improve the high brightness performance of single-mode ridge waveguide GaAs/AlGaAs quantum well (QW) lasers. The sputtered SiO 2 QWI technique is explained, and a selective process suitable for device manufacture was demonstrated. This QWI technology was applied to create three distinct devices to address the performance limitations imposed by catastrophic optical damage (COD), spatial mode instability, and overheating. A non absorbing mirror (NAM) laser technology was successfully demonstrated, capable of significantly improving the COD level of high power lasers prone to mirror degradation. Under pulsed test conditions designed to induce COD, the standard ridge laser suffered COD at 230 mW/facet, compared to 600 mW/facet for the NAM laser, demonstrating an improved COD level by a factor of 2. 6. Confirmation of the COD failure mechanism was achieved by facet inspection, and removal of the damaged facets. Successful demonstration of a high brightness single lateral mode ridge laser with a self-aligned <b>buried</b> <b>heterostructure</b> defined by QWI was achieved. The device benefits from de-coupling of the optical and electrical confinement, allowing enhanced fundamental lateral mode operation up to higher powers; the <b>buried</b> <b>heterostructure</b> improves the lateral mode discrimination, thus suppressing higher order modes. Comparison of the standard ridge laser and the <b>buried</b> <b>heterostructure</b> ridge laser for ridge widths of 5 mm clearly demonstrated the improvement gained; the standard ridge laser was too wide to operate in the fundamental mode, whereas the <b>buried</b> <b>heterostructure</b> ridge laser showed dominantly single-mode operation up to 130 mW/facet...|$|E

40|$|Unlike {{conventional}} semiconductor lasers, single {{quantum well}} (SQW) lasers with high reflectivity end facet coatings have dramatically reduced threshold currents {{as a result}} of the smaller volume of the (active) quantum well region. A cw threshold current of 0. 55 mA was obtained for a <b>buried</b> graded-index separate-confinement <b>heterostructure</b> SQW laser with facet reflectivities of ~ 80 %, a cavity length of 120 µm, and an active region stripe width of 1 µm. This is believed to be the lowest threshold current so far reported for any semiconductor laser at room temperature. The submilliampere threshold currents of these lasers allow them to be modulated at high speed without any current prebias or feedback monitoring. The relaxation oscillation frequency for these lasers was also measured. Values of differential gain derived from these measurements demonstrated that the differential gain in the uncoated lasers is less than in the coated devices. This result was expected because of gain saturation. As predicted, SQW lasers have substantially narrower spectral linewidths than bulk double heterostructure lasers. This result is attributed to lower internal loss, linewidth enhancement factor, and spontaneous emission factor. A further major reduction (> 3 x) in the linewidth of these SQW lasers was observed when the facet reflectivities were enhanced. This observation is explained theoretically on the basis of the very low losses in coated SQW lasers and the value of the spontaneous emssion factor...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the fabrication and {{the properties of}} five new semiconductor laser diode structures. All of these devices were grown from the GaAs-AlGaAs ternary system using the liquid phase epitaxial technique. In addition, a new low noise avalanche photodetector is proposed. The first example is a new technique for fabricating cleaved mirrors without cleaving through the substrate. This technique, called micro-cleavage, has potential applications for both opto-electronic integrated circuits and for the fabrication of short cavity length lasers. In this technique, cantilevers are formed by a sequence of etching steps. These cantilevers are subsequently cleaved using ultrasonic vibrations. Three devices related to high power single mode lasers are described. The first {{of these is the}} large optical cavity <b>buried</b> <b>heterostructure</b> window laser. The output power of semiconductor lasers, particularly during pulsed operation is limited by catastrophic mirror damage which occurs at power densities above a pulse width dependent damage threshold. The damage occurs due to local heating up to the melting point of the active region {{in the vicinity of the}} cleaved mirror facets. However, catastrophic mirror damage can be avoided by isolating the active layer from the cleaved mirrors, as is done in these window lasers. The second device related to high power that is described is the Inverted Strip <b>Buried</b> <b>Heterostructure</b> laser. These lasers combine many of the best features of both the buried optical guide lasers and the strip <b>buried</b> <b>heterostructure</b> that have been previously developed elsewhere. The inverted strip <b>buried</b> <b>heterostructure</b> lasers have significantly better beam quality than buried optical guide lasers and can be operated in the fundamental spatial mode for larger emitting areas (and therefore greater output power). The third device related to high power lasers is a variation of a <b>buried</b> <b>heterostructure</b> laser in which the injected current is confined to a narrow section in the center of the active layer. The optical gain is therefore also confined to a narrow section in the center of the active layer. By doing so the fundamental mode is much better matched to the optical gain than the higher order spatial modes. The result is that fundamental mode operation is possible for <b>buried</b> <b>heterostructure</b> lasers with active layer widths up to 8 µm. When the current is injected uniformly into the active layer, fundamental mode operation is possible only for active layer widths less than 2 µm. In addition to the descriptions of these devices a theoretical chapter on high power single mode lasers is included. The final laser structure that is described is a single liquid phase epitaxial growth laser structure in which the current is restricted to flow between two narrow stripes located above and below the active layer. This structure, which is fabricated using a meltback-growth technique allows the current injection to be restricted to a very narrow section of the active layer, which results in several interesting properties which are described and explained using a simple model. The final subject of this thesis is a multilayer avalanche photodetector (APD) which has been proposed for low noise applications. The noise generated by an APD is dependent on the statistics of the carrier multiplication process, since positive feedback effects, which exist when both electrons and holes produce secondary pairs, can greatly amplify any current fluctuations. Significantly more noise is generated if the electron and hole ionization rates ([alpha],[beta]) are equal than if only one carrier produces secondary pairs. The multilayer structure described and analyzed in this chapter is expected to have impact ionization which is dominated by electrons and therefore would be of importance for low noise applications. </p...|$|E
