40|$|AbstractThe {{primary purpose}} of this paper is to give an {{oscillation}} theory for second-order integral differential equations. It is shown that this theory follows in a natural way as “a corollary” from the more abstract approximation theory of quadratic forms given previously by the author. Thus, our ideas are primarily constructive and quantitative as opposed to the usual qualitative methods. We also note that the usual oscillation theory for second-order differential equations follows directly by our methods. Furthermore, our methods provide a unified theory for eigenvalue problems, optimization problems, and numerical approximation problems within this setting. In Section 1 we give the preliminaries for the remainder of the paper. In Section 2 we define the basic quadratic form and integral differential equation and give the relationships between them. These relationships are used (in Section 3) to give a theory of oscillation in our setting and some <b>basic</b> <b>oscillation</b> results.

40|$|Multiple inverted-V {{structures}} are commonly observed {{on the same}} auroral zone crossing by a low-altitude orbiting satellite. Such structures appear grouped and apparently result from an ionospheric and/or magnetospheric mechanism of stratification. More than two years of AUREOL- 3 satellite observations were analyzed to study their properties and their formation {{in the framework of}} the ionosphere-magnetosphere coupling model proposed by Tverskoy. This model predicts some natural periodicity in the electrostatic potential profile (and subsequently in the field-aligned current profiles) that could account for oscillations experimentally observed in the auroral zone, such as successive inverted-Vs. Experimental results obtained during quiet or moderately active periods demonstrate that the number of structures observed within a given event is well described by a 'scaling' parameter provided by the hot plasma stratification theory and expressed in terms of the field-aligned current density, the total width of the current band, the plasma sheet ion temperature, and the height-integrated Pedersen conductivity of the ionosphere. The latitudinal width, in the order of 100 – 200 km at ionospheric altitudes, is relatively independent of the current density, and is determined not only by the existence of a potential difference above the inverted-Vs, but also by <b>basic</b> <b>oscillations</b> of the ionosphere-magnetosphere coupling system predicted by Tverskoy. The large number of cases studied by the AUREOL- 3 satellite provides reliable statistical trends which permits the validation of the model and the inference that the multiple structures currently observed can be related directly to oscillations of the magnetospheric potential (or the pressure gradients) on a scale of ~ 1000 - 2000 km in the near-Earth plasma sheet. These oscillations arise in the Tverskoy model and may naturally result when the initial pressure gradients needed to generate a large-scale field-aligned current have a sufficiently wide equatorial scale, of about 1 RE or more.

There is a uniform steady state which, for certain values of the adjustable parameters, may be unstable. When the uniform solution is slightly unstable, the two-timing method is used to find the bifurcation of new solutions of small amplitude. These may be either non-uniform steady states or time-periodic solutions, depending on {{the ratio of the}} diffusion coefficients. In the limit that one of the diffusion coefficients is infinite, multiple steady states of finite amplitude are found. When one of the parameters is allowed to depend on space and the basic state is unstable, it is found that the non-uniform steady state which is approached may show localized spatial oscillations. The localization arises out of the presence of turning points in the linearized stability equations. When diffusion is absent it is shown how kinematic concentration waves arise.

In this paper, unlike the previous paper, however, we do not use the approximation that the oscillations are nearly vertical, but limit to a simpler case of no magnetic field.

40|$|An {{intermediate}} coupled {{model for}} the E 1 Nifio/Southem Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon is {{used to examine the}} interaction of ENSO with the seasonal cycle and how this is related to the irregularity of ENSO time series. Under annual mean conditions, the mechanisms that give rise to an inherent ENSO frequency and spatial pattern are well understood in this model. When the annual cycle is included, the ENSO cycle tends to lock to rational multiples of the annual frequency. The role of such subharmonic frequency locking in the transition to chaos in ENSO models has recently been examined by Jin et al., Tziperman et al. and Chang et al. Here we fit this transition scenario into a broader perspective. We emphasize three main points: (1) Using Floquet theory, we show step by step the relation of the ENSO mode in the linearized annual average case to the linear and nonlinear cases with the seasonal cycle. The dynamics that determine the spatial pattern and the <b>basic</b> <b>oscillation</b> mechanism are the same, thus putting a decade of theory on the linear annual average case onto firmer ground. (2) The quasi-periodicity scenario for the transition to chaos fundamentally involves two parameters, one governing the amplitude of the ENSO cycle, the other the inherent period. Examining model behavior as a function of parameters reveals that at reasonable amplitude of the ENSO cycle, superstable frequency-locked regimes are more prevalent than chaotic regimes. (3) When stochastic forcing by atmospheric uncoupled variability-"weather noise"-is included, the resulting irregularity in frequency-locked regimes still carries the signature of the frequency-locked spectral peaks.

Different cortical sources may participate in the 10 -Hz oscillation and appear to be modulated by the sensory context and functional demands. In microgravity, the marked reduction in multimodal graviceptive inputs to cortical networks participating in the representation of space could be expected to affect the 10 -Hz activity. The effect of microgravity on this <b>basic</b> <b>oscillation</b> has heretofore not been studied quantitatively. Because the alpha rhythm has a functional role in the regulation of network properties of the visual areas, we hypothesised that the absence of gravity would affect its strength. Here, we report the results of an experiment conducted over the course of 3 space flights, in which we quantified the power of the 10 -Hz activity in relation to the arrest reaction (i. e. in 2 distinct physiological states: eyes open and eyes closed). We observed that the power of the spontaneous 10 -Hz oscillation recorded in the eyes-closed state in the parieto-occipital (alpha rhythm) and sensorimotor areas (mu rhythm) increased in the absence of gravity. The suppression coefficient during the arrest reaction and the related spectral perturbations produced by eye-opening/closure state transition also increased in on orbit.

40|$|An 11 -box {{model of}} the oceanic carbon cycle {{including}} sedimentary processes is used to explore the role chemical weathering of continental silicate rocks might play in driving atmospheric CO 2 levels on glacial-interglacial timescales. Histories for the consumption of CO 2 by silicate rock weathering processes are derived from the marine Ge/Si record. Taking the major uncertainties in {{the knowledge of the}} Ge and Si cycles into account, several histories for the evolution of the riverine dissolved silica fluxes are calculated from this record. The investigation of the systematics between riverine dissolved silica and bicarbonate fluxes under different weathering regimes leads us to the tentative conclusion that although there is no correlation between dissolved silica and total bicarbonate concentrations in the major rivers, there may exist a negative correlation between weathering intensity and the ratio of dissolved silica to bicarbonate derived from silicate weathering alone. With this correlation as a working hypothesis, it is possible to interpret the dissolved silica fluxes in terms of equivalent CO 2 consumption rates. The calculated histories indicate that glacial rates of CO 2 consumption by chemical silicate rock weathering could have been twice, and possibly up to 3. 5 times, as high as they are today. When used to force the carbon cycle model, they are responsible for glacial-interglacial pCO 2 variations in the atmosphere of typically 50 – 60 ppm and up to 95 – 110 ppm. These variations are superimposed to a <b>basic</b> <b>oscillation</b> of 60 ppm generated by the model, mainly in response to coral reef buildup and erosion processes. The total pCO 2 signal has an amplitude of about 80 – 90 ppm and up to 125 – 135 ppm.

40|$|We {{consider}} nonlinear {{aspects of}} the flow of an inviscid two-dimensional jet into a second immiscible fluid of different density and unbounded extent. Velocity jumps are supported at the interface, and the flow is susceptible to the Kelvin–Helmholtz instability. We investigate theoretically the effects of horizontal electric fields and surface tension on the nonlinear evolution of the jet. This is accomplished by developing a long-wave matched asymptotic analysis that incorporates the influence of the outer regions on the dynamics of the jet. The result is a coupled system of long-wave nonlinear, nonlocal evolution equations governing the interfacial amplitude and corresponding horizontal velocity, for symmetric interfacial deformations. The theory allows for amplitudes that scale with the undisturbed jet thickness and is therefore capable of predicting singular events such as jet pinching. In the absence of surface tension, a sufficiently strong electric field completely stabilizes (linearly) the Kelvin–Helmholtz instability at all wavelengths by the introduction of a dispersive regularization of a nonlocal origin. The dispersion relation has the same functional form as the destabilizing Kelvin–Helmholtz terms, but is of a different sign. If the electric field is weak or absent, then surface tension is included to regularize Kelvin–Helmholtz instability and to provide a well-posed nonlinear problem. We address the nonlinear problems numerically using spectral methods and establish two distinct dynamical behaviors. In cases where the linear theory predicts dispersive regularization (whether surface tension is present or not), then relatively large initial conditions induce a nonlinear flow that is oscillatory in time (in fact quasi-periodic) with a <b>basic</b> <b>oscillation</b> predicted well by linear theory and a second nonlinearly induced lower frequency that is responsible for quasi-periodic modulations of the spatio-temporal dynamics. If the parameters are chosen so that the linear theory predicts a band of long unstable waves (surface tension now ensures that short waves are dispersively regularized), then the flow generically evolves to a finite-time rupture singularity.

The large number of cases studied by the AUREOL- 3 satellite provides reliable statistical trends which permits the validation of the model and the inference that the multiple structures currently observed can be related directly to oscillations of the magnetospheric potential (or the pressure gradients) on a scale of ~ 1000 - 2000 km in the near-Earth plasma sheet. These oscillations arise in the Tverskoy model and may naturally result when the initial pressure gradients needed to generate a large-scale field-aligned current have a sufficiently wide equatorial scale, of about 1 R E or more.

40|$|Observations of X-ray {{emissions}} from binary systems {{have long since}} been considered important tools to test General Relativity in strong-field regimes. The high frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (HFQPOs) observed in binaries containing a black hole candidate, in particular, have been proposed {{as a means to}} measure more directly the black hole properties such as its mass and spin. Numerous models have been suggested to explain the HFQPOs and the rich phenomenology accompanying them. Many of these models rest on a number of assumptions and are at times in conflict with the most recent observations. We here propose a new, simple model in which the HFQPOs result from <b>basic</b> $p$-mode <b>oscillations</b> of a small accretion torus orbiting close to the black hole. We show that within this model the key properties of the HFQPOs can be explained simply, given a single reasonable assumption. We also discuss observational tests that can falsify the model.

40|$|We {{propose a}} method to control noise-induced motion, based on using delayed {{feedback}} {{in the form of the}} difference between the delayed and the current states of the system. The method is applied to two different types of systems, namely, a self-oscillator near Andronov-Hopf bifurcation and a threshold system. In both cases we demonstrate that by variation of time delay one can effectively control coherence and timescales of stochastic oscillations. The entrainment of the <b>basic</b> period of <b>oscillations</b> by time delay is discovered. We give explanations of the phenomena observed and provide a theory for the system near bifurcation.
