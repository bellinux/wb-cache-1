5|$|By 1899, Waterloo had 16 {{platforms}} {{but only}} 10 numbers allocated in different {{sections of the}} station or on different levels; some numbers were duplicated. This complexity and confusion became the butt of jokes <b>by</b> <b>writers</b> and music hall comics {{for many years in}} the late 19th century, including Jerome K. Jerome in Three Men in a Boat. It was criticised and satirised in several Punch cartoons.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1770s, Johnson {{had become}} an {{established}} publisher. Writers—particularly Dissenters—sought him out, and his home started to become the centre of a radical and stimulating intellectual milieu. Because he was willing to publish multiple opinions on issues, he was respected as a publisher <b>by</b> <b>writers</b> from across the political spectrum. Johnson published many Unitarian works, but he also issued works criticizing them; although he was an abolitionist, he also published works arguing in favour of the slave trade; he supported inoculation, but he also published works critical of the practice.|$|E
5|$|In 1892, the Scottish naturalist Henry Ogg Forbes {{described}} Hawkins's rail, an {{extinct species}} of rail from the Chatham Islands, {{as a new}} species of Aphanapteryx; A. hawkinsi. He found the Chatham Islands species more similar to the red rail than the latter was to the Rodrigues rail, and proposed that the Mascarene Islands had once been connected with the Chatham Islands. These ideas were later criticised <b>by</b> <b>writers</b> such as the British palaeontologist Charles William Andrews and the German ornithologist Hans Friedrich Gadow, and the bird was moved to its own genus, Diaphorapteryx.|$|E
5|$|In England, ain't is {{generally}} considered a non-standard or illiterate usage, as it is used by speakers of a lower socio-economic class, or by educated people in an informal manner. In the nineteenth century, ain't was often used <b>by</b> <b>writers</b> to denote regional dialects such as Cockney English. Ain't is a non-standard feature commonly found in mainstream Australian English, and in New Zealand, ain't is a feature of Maori-influenced English. In American English, usage of ain't corresponds to a middle level of education, although {{it is widely believed}} that its use establishes of lack of education or social standing in the speaker.|$|E

5|$|Novelist Inez Asher {{was among}} those who wrote for the series, while other scripts were {{produced}} <b>by</b> <b>writers</b> blacklisted during the heyday of McCarthyism and the House Un-American Activities Committee.

5|$|Reserved and efficient, Ianto {{was often}} used <b>by</b> <b>writers</b> to add humorous asides to the episodes' scripts. The {{character}} becomes the main romantic interest of Captain Jack Harkness (John Barrowman), {{who is the}} lead male of the series. Established to have had heterosexual relationships prior to the series, Ianto's story forms {{a part of the}} show's ongoing exploration of human sexuality. Expanded Universe material develops on Ianto's sexual orientation {{and the nature of the}} relationship with Jack, describing Ianto as bisexual and his feelings for Jack as genuine love. Additionally, writers have used these other media to explore Ianto's characterisation; for example, some stories elaborate on Ianto's backstory, or provide insight into his feelings.|$|E

5|$|Since {{its initial}} reception, Illmatic has been {{recognized}} <b>by</b> <b>writers</b> and music critics as a landmark album in East Coast hip hop.

5|$|The {{earliest}} written references {{that have}} survived {{relating to the}} islands were made by Pliny the Elder in his Natural History, where he states that there are 30 Hebudes, and makes a separate reference to Dumna, which Watson (1926) concludes is unequivocally the Outer Hebrides. Writing about 80 years later, in 140-150AD, Ptolemy, drawing on the earlier naval expeditions of Agricola, writes that there are five Ebudes (possibly meaning the Inner Hebrides) and Dumna. Later texts in classical Latin, <b>by</b> <b>writers</b> such as Solinus, use the forms Hebudes and Hæbudes.|$|E

Due to scheduling conflicts with Airheads, Lehmann had to vacate the director's position, which was taken over by Burton.|$|E
