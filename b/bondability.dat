40|$|Gold {{metallization}} on wafer substrates for wire/ribbon bond applications require good {{bond strength}} to the substrate without weakening the wire/ribbon. This paper compares the ribbon <b>bondability</b> of Cr/Au and Ti/TiN/Pt/Au metallization systems. Both chromium and titanium {{are used to}} promote adhesion between substrates and sputtered gold films. Both can diffuse the gold surface after annealing and degrade the wire/ribbon <b>bondability.</b> Restoring <b>bondability</b> by ceric ammonium nitrate (CAN) etch was investigated. Experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of Cr/Au and Ti/TiN/Pt/Au, annealing, and CAN etch processes on 25. 4 times; 254 μm (1 × 10 mil) ribbon bonding. All bonds were evaluated by noting pull strengths and examining specific failure modes. The results {{show that there is}} no significant difference in <b>bondability</b> between Cr/Au and Ti/TiN/Pt/Au before the annealing process. At this point excellent bond strength can be achieved. However, wire/ribbon <b>bondability</b> of Cr/Au degraded after the wafers are annealed. The experimental results show that a CAN etch can remove Cr oxide. Improvement of wire/ribbon <b>bondability</b> of Cr/Au depends on the CAN etch time. The annealing process does not have significant effect on <b>bondability</b> of Ti/TiN/Pt/Au metallization. Auger electron spectroscopy was used to investigate what caused the difference in <b>bondability</b> between the two metallization...|$|E

Microstructures with different <b>bondability</b> were studied using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and an X-ray energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS).

30|$|Fiberboards were {{prepared}} from acetylated fibers with various weight gains: 0, 4.7, 9.4, 18.5, and 24.8 weight percent gain (WPG). The effects of low <b>bondability</b> of acetylated fibers on mechanical properties and dimensional changes were determined. The decreased mechanical properties of acetylated fiberboard are mainly due to low <b>bondability.</b> To improve bending strength, high face density is also needed. The thickness swelling according to JIS and the linear expansion under relative humidity changes decreased with increasing WPG. As for accelerated weathering and the outdoor exposure test, the thickness changes in 4.7 – 18.5 WPG boards were {{much higher than}} those in OWPG board and 24.8 WPG board. The high thickness change in 4.7 – 18.5 WPG boards is due to low <b>bondability.</b> Although 24.8 WPG board also has low <b>bondability,</b> the thickness change of 24.8 WPG board decreased. The high dimensional stability of acetylated fibers, caused by high WPG, probably outweighs the dimensional change caused by low <b>bondability.</b> On the other hand, during the boiling test the thickness changes in 24.8 WPG board and the 4.7 – 18.5 WPG boards were higher than those in 0 WPG board. The effect of the boiling test on the boards is more severe than that seen with the accelerated weathering and outdoor exposure test; therefore, {{the effects of the}} low <b>bondability</b> probably cancel the effects of the high WPG. It is necessary to increase the <b>bondability</b> of acetylated fibers to improve the dimensional stability and the mechanical properties.|$|E
40|$|The process {{windows are}} {{presented}} for low-temperature Au wire bonding on Au/Ni/Cu bond pads of varying Au-layer thicknesses metallized on an organic FR- 4 {{printed circuit board}} (PCB). Three different plating techniques were used to deposit the Au layers: electrolytic plating, immersion plating, and immersion plating followed by electrolytic plating. Wide ranges of wire bond force, bond power, and bond-pad temperature were used to identify {{the combination of these}} processing parameters that can produce good wire bonds, allowing the construction of process windows. The criterion for successful bonds is no peel off for all 20 wires tested. The wire pull strengths and wire deformation ratios are measured to evaluate the bond quality, after a successful wire bond. Elemental and surface characterization techniques were used to evaluate the bond-pad surfaces and are correlated to wire <b>bondability</b> and wire pull strength. Based on the process windows along with the pull strength data, the bond-pad metallization and bonding conditions can be further optimized for improved wire <b>bondability</b> and product yields. The wire <b>bondability</b> of the electrolytic bond pad increased with Au-layer thickness. The bond pad with an Au-layer thickness of 0. 7 mum displayed the highest <b>bondability</b> for all bonding conditions used. The <b>bondability</b> of immersion bond pads was comparable to electrolytic bond pads with a similar Au thickness. Although a high temperature was beneficial to wire <b>bondability</b> with a wide process window, it did not improve the bond quality as measured by wire pull strength...|$|E
40|$|The <b>bondability</b> of {{two kinds}} of Al-Si thin films in thermosonic Au wire bonding was {{examined}} by means of microshear tests. One type of film was formed by sputtering an Al- 2 % Si alloy, {{and the other was}} formed by depositing an 0. 05 micrometer-thick polysilicon layer on SiO 2 by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and then depositing a 1. 2 micrometer-thick Al layer on them by evaporation. After heat-treatment at 450 deg for 30 min., Si in the Al-Si film crystallized. The grain size of the crystallized Si affects the thermosonic wire <b>bondability,</b> i. e., for Al- 2 % Si sputtered films, good <b>bondability</b> was obtained under relatively small (1. 0 micrometer) grain size conditions. In the successive layer process, on the other hand, the grain size of crystallized Si varies with the polysilicon CVD temperature. The optimum CVD temp. was determined from the standpoint of <b>bondability</b> with respect to grain size...|$|E
40|$|Summary form only given. In recent years, the {{application}} of chip on board technology (COB) has become widespread. COB technology offers many advantages compared to conventional packaging techniques, such as the reduced weight and volume of electronic components and high flexibility. For consumer applications and especially for the harsh environmental conditions in automotive applications, a qualified investigation of reliability is necessary. COB technology with wire bonds includes die bonding, wire bonding and encapsulation of bare chips on printed circuit boards (PCBs). In order to obtain a correlation between process conditions and reliability, the <b>bondability</b> and solderability of different electroless metal finishes were investigated. In this paper, the <b>bondability</b> and solderability of palladium metal finishes with an optional gold flash and electroless plated Ni-Au metallizations are shown. The investigation of the <b>bondability</b> was performed in two steps. First, a detailed study was performed to determine the basic factors affecting <b>bondability.</b> This study includes surface investigations such as SEM, Auger spectroscopy and measurement of microhardness and microroughness.

Thermosonic copper ball bonding is an absorbing interconnection technology that serves as a viable and cost saving alternative to gold ball bonding. Its excellent mechanical and electrical characteristics make copper ball bonding attractive for high-speed, power devices and fine-pitch applications. However, copper is easily oxidized and harder than gold, which causes some critical process problems in connection with <b>bondability.</b> In this study, a 50 mum copper wire with purity of 99. 99 % was bonded on aluminum metallization with thickness 3 mum using an ASM angle 60 automatic thermosonic ball/wedge bonder. Experimental studies of copper free air balls (FABs) formation and bonding process were conducted to establish the bonding mechanism and to explain the effects of process parameters on <b>bondability.</b> A micro-slipping model was proposed to account for the effects of the ultrasonic power and bonding force on <b>bondability.</b> It was found that the <b>bondability</b> was determined by a slip area at the bonding interface. The occurrence of bonding only at the periphery of the contact area between FAB and aluminum metallization was attributed to partial slips at the bonding interface. Variation in the ultrasonic power and bonding force that lead to different stick-slip modes, can effect <b>bondability</b> in the ultrasonic bonding process. It is important to set a proper bonding time to achieve interatomic bonding without causing fatigue rupture of microjoints. It was also found that preheating of the chip to a certain temperature can improve <b>bondability...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{requirements}} on a surface {{in terms of}} micro-roughness necessary to achieve spontaneous bonding on wafer contact have been investigated.

Different wet cleaning procedures were used to modify the micro-roughness of the silicon surface. It is found that the surface rms roughness value {{is not a good}} measure for judging the <b>bondability</b> of a surface. Instead we propose the use of the Fourier spectrum of the surface roughness.

40|$|This paper reports {{comparative}} {{performance of}} wire <b>bondability</b> of electrolytically plated Au/Ni/Cu bond pads on rigid FR- 4 and bismaleimide trazine (BT) PCBs, {{as well as}} flexible polyimide (PI) substrate. The metallization surfaces were treated with plasma to study the effect of bond pad surface cleanliness on wire <b>bondability.</b> Process windows were constructed {{as a function of}} bonding temperature and bond power for the individual substrate materials. Significant improvements of wire pull strength and process window were noted after plasma treatment with a substantial reduction in minimum bonding temperature from 120 degrees C to 60 degrees C for both the rigid and flexible substrates. The minimum bond power required to produce successful bonds decreased with increasing bonding temperature. At a bonding temperature of 120 degrees C, the process window for the flexible substrate was wider than the rigid substrates. The wire <b>bondability</b> and wire pull strength of rigid substrates decreased with increasing bonding temperature above 120 degrees C due to softening of the substrate which adversely affected the effective bond force and the transmission of ultrasonic energy. In contrast, the wirebonding performance of the flexible substrate remained stable at 120 degrees C or above because the thermo-mechanical properties of flexible PI substrate were rather insensitive to temperature.

40|$|Abstract: ENIG (electroless Ni {{immersion}} gold) is one {{of surface}} finishing which has been most widely used in fine pitch SMT (surface mount technology) and BGA (ball grid array) packaging process. The reliability for package <b>bondability</b> is mainly affected by interfacial reaction between solder and surface finishing. Since the behavior of IMC (intermetallic compound), or the interfacial reaction between Ni and solder, affects to some product reliabilities such as solderability and <b>bondability,</b> understanding behavior of IMC should be important issue. Thus, we studied the properties of ENIG with P contents (9 wt % and 13 wt%), where the P contents {{is one of}} main factors in formation of IMC layer. The effect of P content was discussed using the results obtained from FE-SEM(field-emission scanning electron microscope), EPMA(electron probe micro analyzer), EDS(energy dispersive spectroscopy) and Dual-FIB(focused ion beam). Especially, we observed needle type irregular IMC layer with decreasing Ni contents under high P contents (13 wt%).

Compare with Au ball bonding, the lower wire loop and finer bond pitch of Au wedge bond makes its ideal for low profile and high I/O applications, which is the subject of the current study. As bond pad surface cleanliness, substrate materials and wire bonding process parameters play a critical role on the yield of wire bonding, this study compare Au wedge wire <b>bondability</b> of rigid FR- 4 and flexible polyimide (PI) substrate and examine the bonding improvements using plasma cleaning by the concept of process windows. Process windows demonstrate the <b>bondability</b> of the substrates at a combinations of varies bonding conditions, such as bonding temperature, bond power and with and without subjected to plasma cleaning.

40|$|Immersion Ag and {{immersion}} Sri coatings {{obtained through}} the electroless process {{have emerged as}} an alternative to Ni/Au metallisation layer for more uniform thickness and lower material cost. Microscopic studies by SEM, AFM and TEM indicated that the Ag coating had a finer sur ace morphology and lower thickness than the Sn coating.

Further study based on the D-SIM revealed that both the Ag and Sn immersion coatings were organometallic in nature. Wire bond mechanical tests showed that both the Al and Au wires were bondable on immersion Ag finish.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. To enhance the <b>bondability</b> of polyetheretherketone (PEEK), surface treatment techniques of plasma and corona discharge have been evaluated. The results have shown that these two methods are effective and practical. The treated materials not only reach their highest possible joint strength, but also show very promising joint durability. In addition, the various environments, e. g. atmosphere, heat, water, and solvent, have little effects on the enhanced <b>bondability</b> of the treated materials. By using Contact Angle Measurement, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) and Time of Flight Secondaty Ion Mass Spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) to characterise the PEEK surfaces before and after treatment, it was established {{that the lack of}} active chemical groups, which if present can form strong interatomic and intermolecular forces across the adhesive/PEEK interface, is the main cause for the poor <b>bondability</b> of the untreated PEEK. Both plasma and corona discharge treatment introduce such active functional groups, for instance, hydroxyl, carboxylic acid, amine and etc., onto the surface of PEEK film and so greatly enhance the intrinsic adhesion at the interface between treated PEEK surfaces and epoxy adhesive, as confirmed by the TOF-SIMS interfacial analysis. It is deduced that low molecular weight molecules (LMWM) are formed on treated surfaces, which contain high concentration of oxygen and/or nitrogen, and can be removed by solvent washing. The removal of LMWM will drastically reduce the wettability of the treated surfaces, but does not impair the enhanced <b>bondability.</b> It has been found that both plasma and corona discharge treated surfaces are in a thermodynamically unstable state. When exposed to the atmosphere, the treated surfaces tend to lose their improved wettability and decrease their surface polarity. Increasing temperature can not only accelerate these processes but also change the surface chemical structures of the treated materials back to that of the untreated films to some extent, as revealed by the TOF-SIMS analysis. Water immersion, on the contrary, tend to reverse the above processes...|$|E

30|$|To {{guarantee}} the demolding of the cured parts, release agents are used. Within {{the aerospace industry}} (where thermoset matrix systems are widely used), external release agents are applied to coat the mold prior to the curing process [7]. After the crosslinking reaction of the resin-system and the demolding of the parts, release agent residues are found on the parts surface as several times shown (e.g. [6 – 9]). This indicates a release agent transfer during {{the production of the}} parts. These release agent residues lower the adhesion of the parts and therefore their initial <b>bondability</b> [10]. Within industrial applications, the challenge of the relatively bad initial <b>bondability</b> is solved by an additional process step—the bonding pre-treatment. Even if there are different approaches, like a laser [8] or plasma [9] application, which allow a sufficient and potentially automated bonding pre-treatment, it is still an additional process step which lowers the production efficiency.|$|E

Soldering on immersion Ag is particularly well-established and this type of finish has been increasing throughout the world in recent years. However, the first generations of immersion Ag had the great disadvantage of not being particularly suitable for wire bonding over a longer period once it had been taken out of inert gas.

30|$|Due to the fact, that release {{agents are}} often stoved on the molds {{prior to the}} first {{production}} cycle, a displacement (on a macro-or microscopic scale) of the contamination by the resin has a minor relevance.

Copper (Cu) {{wire bonding}} on the {{pre-plated}} leadframes with Ni/Pd/AuAg plating {{has been applied}} extensively in the semiconductor industry for the interconnection of integrated-circuit (IC) packaging due to the lower material cost of Cu and its excellent electrical properties. Furthermore, the Cu wire bonding on the preplated leadframe has advantages, such as the tin whisker prevention and the robust package for automotive application. Nevertheless, a stitch <b>bondability</b> of Cu wire-preplated leadframe is facing several challenges, such as the Cu oxidation, the high hardness of Cu wire and the very thin AuAg plating on the leadframes. This paper discusses the effect of AuAg plating thickness in roughened pre-plated leadframe on the stitch bonding of Cu wires with the leadframe. The stitch bonding integrity was assessed using Dage 4000 shear/pull tool at a key wire bond responses of stitch pull at time zero (T 0). Results show that the stitch pull strength of the Cu-leadframe stitch bonding increases with the increase thickness of AuAg layer. FESEM images of the stitch bonding between the Cu wires and the pre-plated leadframes of different AuAg plating thickness did not show any defect in microstructures, thus it suggests that the bonding property is determined by diffusion mechanism at the Cu wire/AuAg stitch bonding interface. Finally, a brief discussion is provided on the stitch <b>bondability</b> of high performance Au-flashed palladium-coated copper wires on the pre-plated leadframe with different AuAg thickness...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this study, {{plastic flow}} joining using a shot peening process was investigated. Surface {{treatment}} {{is necessary to}} improve the surface properties. Shot peening {{is one of the}} surface treatments. Since the surface of substrate is hit repeatedly with a large number of shots, the substrate undergoes a large plastic deformation near its surface. Therefore, plastic flow characterized by a shear droop occurs {{at the edge of the}} substrate due to shot peening. If an implant made of a dissimilar material is set in a hollow space on the surface of the substrate and then shot-peened, it can be joined to the substrate due to the peening droop generated by the large plastic deformation during shot peening. In this method, the availability of the plastic flow, i. e., the peening droop makes the joining of the implant possible. In the experiment, a compressed-air-type shot peening machine was employed. To examine experimentally the influence of working temperature on <b>bondability,</b> equipment with a heating furnace was produced.
