5|$|In the Mediterranean, {{a guerrilla}} war waged by Greek Cypriots ended in 1960 {{leading to an}} {{independent}} Cyprus, with the UK retaining the military bases of Akrotiri and Dhekelia. The Mediterranean islands of Malta and Gozo were amicably granted independence from the UK in 1964 and became the country of Malta, though the idea had <b>been</b> <b>raised</b> <b>in</b> 1955 of integration with Britain.|$|E
5|$|Pale {{crag martin}} pairs often nest alone, {{especially}} in the Sahara, although where suitable sites are available small loose colonies may form. This martin aggressively defends its nesting territory against conspecifics and other species. In Africa breeding dates vary geographically and with local weather conditions, but in northwest Africa February to April is normal, and in Asia nesting is from April to June. Two broods are common, and three have <b>been</b> <b>raised</b> <b>in</b> a season.|$|E
5|$|The idea of {{creating}} a heritage streetcar system in Astoria, as part of efforts to redevelop and revitalize the riverfront area, had first <b>been</b> <b>raised</b> <b>in</b> 1980, long after {{the closure of the}} city's streetcar-transit system, which operated from 1892 to 1924. An attempt by city officials to acquire a trolley car in 1986 was dropped in the face of high insurance costs.|$|E
50|$|McGurk, born as Mick Rushford, <b>in</b> Glasgow, Scotland, <b>was</b> <b>raised</b> <b>in</b> the Gorbals notorious {{slum area}} by his {{grandmother}} and brothers; although some media reports claim that Rushford <b>was</b> <b>raised</b> <b>in</b> Edinburgh.|$|R
50|$|The 9th Bavarian Mixed Landwehr Brigade <b>was</b> <b>raised</b> <b>in</b> the {{northern}} part of the Kingdom of Bavaria, in the III Bavarian Corps area. The 43rd Mixed Landwehr Brigade was from the XI Corps area (the Province of Hesse-Nassau and the smaller Thuringian states).

5|$|Two monuments have <b>been</b> <b>raised</b> <b>in</b> honour of Harald in Oslo, {{the city}} {{which he is}} {{traditionally}} held to have founded. A bronze relief on granite by Lars Utne depicting Harald on horseback was raised on the eponymously named square Harald Hardrådes plass in 1905. In 1950, a large relief by Anne Grimdalen, also of Harald on horseback, was unveiled on the western façade of the Oslo City Hall.|$|E
5|$|Darwin {{summarised}} his speculation in {{his essay}} on the Elevation of Patagonia. Though tentative, it challenged Lyell's ideas. Darwin drew on measurements by the Beagles officers {{as well as his}} own measurements to propose that the plains had <b>been</b> <b>raised</b> <b>in</b> successive stages by forces acting over a wide area, rather than smaller scale actions in a continuous movement. However, he supported Lyell in finding evidence to dismiss a sudden deluge when normal processes were suddenly speeded. Seashells he had found far inland still showing their colour suggested to him that the process had been relatively recent, and could have affected human history.|$|E
5|$|Eddie Buczynski {{was born}} on January 28, 1947 in Brooklyn, New York to working class parents. His father Edmund, after whom he was named, was the {{youngest}} son of Polish parents and had <b>been</b> <b>raised</b> <b>in</b> a Brooklyn tenement with four brothers and two sisters. Enlisting in the Naval Armed Guard in 1943, he fought in the Second World War aboard two Liberty ships, the SS John Howard and the SS José Marti. Eddie's mother, Marie Mauro, was the granddaughter of southern Italian migrants and {{had grown up in}} a Brooklyn apartment. She began communicating with her future husband in 1944 as pen pals before meeting him when he returned home on leave.|$|E

5|$|Ellqvist, on {{the other}} hand, had <b>been</b> <b>raised</b> <b>in</b> Stockholm and was a lively person who enjoyed the social life {{that could only be}} found in towns or cities. She wanted to settle down in a {{comfortable}} place with a husband and have children. Bauer was not sufficiently established an artist to provide for a family; throughout his entire lifetime he relied on his parents for financial support. When he proposed to Ellqvist, Bauer did so without the approval of his parents, who thought that he should be more established in a career and self-supporting before marriage.|$|E
5|$|In 1921, the Citizens Force was reorganised to {{replicate}} the numerical designations of the AIF units and perpetuate their honours and traditions. As a result, the 12th Light Horse Regiment was re-raised in the New England region of New South Wales and headquartered at Armidale. In re-forming, the regiment drew lineage from the Citizens Forces' 12th (New England) Light Horse, which had existed parallel to the AIF light horse regiment and had remained in Australia during the war. This regiment, through a complex series of reorganisations, traced its lineage to the 6th Australian Light Horse Regiment, which had <b>been</b> <b>raised</b> <b>in</b> 1903 and perpetuated units that had contributed personnel to fight in South Africa during the Boer War.|$|E
5|$|It is {{uncertain}} when Akhmad Bassah was born, {{though he is}} thought to have <b>been</b> <b>raised</b> <b>in</b> Bandung, western Java, where he graduated from a Meer Uitgebreid Lager Onderwijs. Bassah spent time working on the state-operated railroad, apparently rising to a fairly high position, but was fired for organizing a strike of the Union of Train and Tramway Personnel. Although he left the company, Bassah remained active in social movements. He was {{an active member of the}} Sarekat Rakyat (People's Union), an organization with communist leanings, and helped that group in its mission of social service.|$|E

5|$|Mark Pennant, aged 15, {{was arrested}} on 9 October 1985 and charged with murder two days later, the first person charged in {{connection}} with the killing. Born in England to West Indian parents, Pennant had <b>been</b> <b>raised</b> <b>in</b> the West Indies until he was nine, after which he returned to the UK; he was diagnosed with learning difficulties and was attending a special school. He was arrested and handcuffed at school, taken to Wood Green Police Station, and interviewed six times over the course of two days with a teacher in attendance. He told the police that he had cut Blakelock and kicked him twice, and named Winston Silcott as the ringleader and several others, including another juvenile, Mark Lambie.|$|E
5|$|Sheep have <b>been</b> <b>raised</b> <b>in</b> the Llŷn Peninsula {{for over}} a {{thousand}} years, and Aberdaron has produced and exported wool for many years. The main product locally was felt, produced by soaking the cloth in water and beating it with large wooden paddles until the wool formed a thick mat which could be flattened, dried and cut into lengths. There were two fulling mills on the Afon Daron, in addition to three corn mills, and lichen was gathered around Y Rhiw, from which a grey dye was extracted. Arable crops consisted mainly of wheat, barley, oats and potatoes. The field boundaries date back several centuries and are marked by walls, cloddiau and hedgerows; important habitats {{for a variety of}} wildlife.|$|E
5|$|Discussions {{about making}} her sixth studio album being a Christmas record began on December 2012, {{a month after}} {{releasing}} her first greatest hits album, Greatest Hits – Chapter One. Having found {{the opportunity to do}} so, Clarkson commissioned producer and multi-instrumentalist Greg Kurstin, whom she had previously collaborated with on her albums Stronger and Greatest Hits – Chapter One, to solely produce the whole album. Despite having <b>been</b> <b>raised</b> <b>in</b> a Jewish faith and unfamiliar with Christmas songs, Kurstin still agreed to produce the project. As a result, the record marked the second time her studio album only had a single producer (the first being David Kahne solely producing My December in 2007). It also marked the fourth time Kurstin had solely produced an entire studio album apart from {{being a member of the}} musical groups The Bird and the Bee and Geggy Tah (the first three being Lily Allen's It's Not Me, It's You in 2009, Sia's We Are Born in 2010, and The Shins' Port of Morrow in 2012).|$|E

5|$|Over 300,000 {{people took}} part and raised $3.5 {{million in the}} first Terry Fox Run. Schools across Canada were urged to join the second run, held on September 19, 1982. School {{participation}} has continued since, evolving into the National School Run Day. The runs, which raised over $20 million in its first six years, grew into an international event as over one million people in 60 countries took part in 1999, raising $15 million that year alone. By the Terry Fox Run's 25th anniversary, more than three million people were taking part annually. Grants from the Terry Fox Foundation, which organizes the runs, have helped Canadian scientists make numerous advances in cancer research. The Terry Fox Run is the world's largest one-day fundraiser for cancer research, and over $600 million has <b>been</b> <b>raised</b> <b>in</b> his name. The 30th Terry Fox Run was held September 19, 2010.|$|E
5|$|Since its publication, {{some have}} viewed {{the book with}} skepticism. Some in the Middle Ages {{regarded}} the book simply as a romance or fable, due largely to the sharp difference of its descriptions of a sophisticated civilisation in China to other early accounts by Giovanni da Pian del Carpine and William of Rubruck who portrayed the Mongols as 'barbarians' who appeared to belong to 'some other world'. Doubts have also <b>been</b> <b>raised</b> <b>in</b> later centuries about Marco Polo's narrative of his travels in China, for example for his failure to mention the Great Wall of China, {{and in particular the}} difficulties in identifying many of the place names he used (the great majority however have since been identified). Many have questioned if he had visited the places he mentioned in his itinerary, if he had appropriated the accounts of his father and uncle or other travelers, and some doubted if he even reached China, or that if he did, perhaps never went beyond Khanbaliq (Beijing).|$|E
5|$|The {{battalion}} was re-raised in Newcastle, New South Wales, in May 1921 as {{part the}} re-organisation of the Australian military {{that took place}} at that time, with the battalion becoming a part-time unit of the Citizens Forces, assigned to the 8th Brigade of the 2nd Military District. Upon formation, the battalion drew its personnel from three previously existing Citizens Forces units: the 2nd and 5th Battalions of the 2nd Infantry Regiment and the 2nd Battalion of the 13th Infantry Regiment, and perpetuated the battle honours and traditions of its associated AIF battalion. As {{a result of this}} re-organisation, the battalion adopted the complex lineage of the 2nd Infantry Regiment, which could trace its history through a series of re-organisations back to the 1st Regiment, New South Wales Rifle Volunteers (Newcastle Volunteer Rifle Corps), which had <b>been</b> <b>raised</b> <b>in</b> 1860.|$|E
