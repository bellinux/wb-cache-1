500|$|After {{releasing}} the successful debut album Ooooooohhh... On the TLC Tip (1992), TLC {{began working on}} the their second release called CrazySexyCool in late 1993 and continued through till September 1994. One of the album's tracks, [...] "Creep", was based on member Tionne [...] "T-Boz" [...] Watkins' own experience. She recalled it for Billboard: [...] "You're with a guy and he's not showing you attention, so another guy comes along and you're like, 'Hey, if you were where {{you were supposed to}} be, he couldn't be showing me attention right now!' I {{was in the middle of}} this drama, because the other guy was [...] friend, and my boyfriend was just not getting it together." [...] Watkins then shared this to the group's long-time writer-producer Dallas Austin, who she had known and with whom she had shared many stories since the two were teenagers. [...] "We thought that was a good relationship to talk about because a lot of people don't admit that's how they feel – that their man's playing on them and they want to be with him so they seek attention elsewhere, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>really</b> want to be with their guy," [...] she added.|$|E
500|$|Abductive logic {{has three}} parts. First, {{there is the}} {{surprising}} fact—also called the result—that both Mulder and Scully are hallucinating, despite not taking any drugs. Second, there is Scully's hypothesis—the rule—that, {{if it were true}} the hallucination [...] "would be a matter of course". Third, there is the conclusion—the case—that [...] "there is a reason to suspect [...] as true." [...] This abduction, Abrams and Cooke point out, is an example of creative abduction, because Scully manages to pull three, separate ideas [...] "creatively" [...] together. Mulder, however, next makes an abductive conclusion. While discussing the events with Skinner, he states that he is not convinced, because drugs do not wear off only when one notices their effects. This abduction also has three parts. The result is the surprising fact that Mulder and Scully's escape seems problematic. The rule is that Mulder and Scully only think that they have escaped, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>really</b> are still underground and being digested. Finally, the case states that [...] "there is reason to suspect that" [...] Mulder and Scully have not escaped from the mushroom. This type of logic is an example of undercoded abduction, because it is the most plausible rule among many.|$|E

500|$|... "Sexy" [...] marked Paltrow's second guest {{appearance}} on Glee as substitute teacher Holly Holliday. She first appeared {{earlier in the}} second season, in the seventh episode, [...] "The Substitute". The role was devised for her by series co-creator Ryan Murphy, who suggested that she showcase her vocal and dancing talent ahead of {{the release of the}} film Country Strong, in which Paltrow plays a country singer. Paltrow was signed to Glee for two episodes, with [...] "The Substitute" [...] originally intended to feature a love quadrangle between Holly, Will, Emma and Carl. Her initial arc was, however, reduced to a single episode. Post-broadcast, Murphy said they both hoped she would appear on Glee again in the future, depending on the right storyline. In January 2011, Paltrow confirmed that she would be reprising the role. Murphy stated that she would appear in episodes fifteen and sixteen as a sex education teacher, and would serve as a love interest for Will, though she actually appeared in episodes fifteen and seventeen. Stamos also reprised his role as Emma's husband Carl. As of March 2011, he was unsure whether he would return to Glee again, but stated that he might do so to conclude Emma and Carl's storyline, explaining: [...] "I think people like me on there, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>really</b> love Will and Emma together. So I don't know how much longer people can stand Will and Emma not being together." ...|$|E

2500|$|In November 1997 {{the band}} {{released}} their second album, Our Newest Album Ever!. Following {{the success of}} their first album, the band felt that their success had been based at least partially on the third wave of ska in general. According to Scott Kerr [...] "The unfortunate reality is that good songs and good live performances have far less to do with our so-called success than our being a part of the 'flavor-of-the-month'." [...] Five Iron Frenzy sought to distance themselves from the ska scene while maintaining their artistic integrity. Dennis Culp portrayed their goal, stating that [...] "The Police used a lot of ska, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>really</b> weren't referred to as a ska band... they went far beyond ska." [...] For Five Iron, the method of achieving that goal was the creative process. On the first three releases Roper wrote most of the lyrics and Kerr supplied the musical portion. After Kerr left, the band began to explore a wider variety of musical influences, incorporating diverse influences such as Latin and swing music. Roper continued to write the lyrics, a task that he took seriously. He explained to 7ball in 1997 that [...] "It's not like we try to sit down and write wacky songs. I take songwriting pretty seriously... I've been given this podium. I have a responsibility to tell the truth about things." ...|$|E
