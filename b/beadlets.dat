40|$|AbstractBeta-carotene (BC) {{could have}} a {{protective}} or pro-carcinogenic role in lung cancer, and cell culture systems are important to evaluate it. Nevertheless, the delivery of the hydrophobic BC to cells is difficult. Different vehicles have been used such as liposomes, tetrahydrofuran and serum lipoproteins, but presenting different problems. Water dispersible <b>beadlets</b> containing BC are a good choice and can produce the greatest BC uptake {{when compared to the}} above vehicles, but other beadlet components could alter the results. Dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) could be a good alternative since it has low toxicity and it enhances the penetration of substances across biologic membranes. We aimed to characterize an appropriate model for delivering all-trans-BC to lung cells in culture and knowing its metabolism. All-trans-BC 5 μM was administered to BEAS- 2 B cells in <b>beadlets</b> or DMSO, and medium and cell samples were taken at different times. The levels of BC and its main isomers and metabolites were determined by HPLC. All-trans-BC reached the same levels in the medium (about 3. 5 μM) either when supplied in <b>beadlets</b> or in DMSO, and, with <b>beadlets,</b> 13 -cis-BC was also detected. However the amount of all-trans-BC taken up by the cells was the triple when delivered by DMSO. With both vehicles, intracellular all-trans-BC levels reached its maximum after 24 h of treatment, remaining equal after 72 h. The 9 -cis and 13 -cis isomers of BC, and oxidized metabolites, were also detected in the cells although in smaller proportion than all-trans-BC, especially with DMSO. An LDH assay did not suggest toxicity of <b>beadlets,</b> DMSO or BC itself. In conclusion, DMSO seems the most appropriate vehicle for delivering BC to lung cells in vitro, and we present a model that allows studying the effects of BC and its metabolism in the lung human BEAS- 2 B cell line...|$|E
40|$|Theory {{suggests}} that carotenoid-based signals {{are used in}} animal communication because they contain specific information about parasite resistance or immunocompetence. This implies that honesty of carotenoid-based signals is maintained by a trade-off between pigmentation and immune function for carotenoids, assuming that the carotenoids used for coloration are also immunoenhancing. We tested this hypothesis by altering the diets of nestling great tits (Paris major) with supplementary <b>beadlets</b> containing the carotenoids that are naturally ingested with food or <b>beadlets</b> containing the carotenoids that are incorporated into the feathers; a control group received <b>beadlets</b> containing no carotenoids. We simultaneously immune challenged half of the nestlings of each supplementation group, using a two-factorial design. Activatior {{of the immune system}} led to reduced color expression. However, only nestlings fed with the naturally ingested carotenoids and not with the carotenoids deposited in the feathers showed an increased cellular immune response. This shows that the carotenoids used for ornamentation do not promote the immune function, which conflicts with the trade-off hypothesis. Our results indicate that honesty of carotenoid-based signals is maintained by an individual's physiological limitation to absorb and/or transport carotenoids and by access to carotenoids, indicating that preferences for carotenoid-based traits in sexual selection or parent-offspring interactions select for competitive individuals, rather than specifically for immune function...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Lycopene is {{the main}} {{carotenoid}} in tomatoes, where it is found in high concentrations. Strong epidemiological evidence suggests that lycopene may provide protection against cardiovascular diseases. We therefore studied the effects of lycopene on diet-induced increase in serum lipid levels and the initiation of atherosclerosis in New Zealand White (NZW) rabbits. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The animals, divided into four groups of 9 animals each, were fed either a standard diet, a high-cholesterol diet containing 0. 5 % cholesterol, a high-cholesterol diet containing placebo <b>beadlets,</b> or a high-cholesterol diet plus 5 mg/kg body weight/day of lycopene (in the form of lycopene <b>beadlets),</b> {{for a period of}} 4 weeks. We found significantly elevated lycopene plasma levels in the animal group treated with lycopene <b>beadlets.</b> Compared to the high-cholesterol and the placebo group, this was associated with a significant reduction of 50 % in total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol serum levels in the lycopene group. The amount of cholesteryl ester in the aorta was significantly decreased by lycopene. However, we did not observe a significant decrease in the extent of aortic surface lipid accumulation in the lycopene group. In addition, no differences in the intima-media thickness among groups were observed. Endothelial-dependent and endothelial-independent vasodilation in isolated rabbit aortic and carotid rings did not differ among any of the animal groups. CONCLUSIONS: Lycopene supplementation for 4 weeks increased lycopene plasma levels in the animals. Although we found strongly reduced total and LDL cholesterol serum levels as well as significantly lower amounts of cholesteryl ester in the aortae in the lycopene-treated group, no significant differences in initial lesions in the aortae were detected...|$|E

40|$|Two enzymes {{have been}} {{identified}} for the oxidative metabolism of carotenoids in mammals. Carotene- 15, 15 ’-monooxygenase (CMO-I) primarily centrally cleaves β,β-carotene to form vitamin A. We hypothesize that carotene- 9 ′, 10 ’-monooxygenase (CMO-II) {{plays a key role}} in metabolism of acyclic nonprovitamin A carotenoids such as lycopene. We investigated carotenoid bioaccumulation in young adult, male, wild-type (WT) mice or mice lacking CMO-II (CMO-II KO). Mice were fed an AIN- 93 G diet or identical diets supplemented with 10 % tomato powder, 130 mg lycopene/kg diet (10 % lycopene <b>beadlets),</b> or placebo <b>beadlets</b> for 4 or 30 d. Lycopene preferentially accumulated in CMO-II KO mouse tissues and serum compared with WT mouse tissues. β-Carotene preferentially accumulated in some CMO-II KO mouse tissues compared with WT mouse tissues. Relative tissue mRNA expression of CMO-I and CMO-II was differentially expressed in mouse tissues, and CMO-II, but not CMO-I, was expressed in mouse prostate. In conclusion, the loss of CMO-II expression leads to increased serum and tissue concentrations of lycopene in tomato-fed mice...|$|E

Aim of the study: To determine the relative bioavailabilities of synthetic and tomato-based lycopene in free living volunteers in a single-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel trial. Methods: Three groups (n = 12 /group) of healthy, normolipemic male and female subjects with a mean baseline serum lycopene concentration of 0. 36 μmol/L took a dose of 15 mg/day total lycopene for 28 days from either Lycovit 10 % (<b>beadlets,</b> BASF, Germany) or Lyc-O-Mato (beads, LycoRed Natural Products, Israel) or a placebo (without lycopene) together with the main meal. The increase in serum lycopene from baseline {{was used as the}} parameter of bioavailability. Results: Synthetic and tomato-lycopene resulted in significant increases above baseline of serum total lycopene by 0. 58 and 0. 57 μmol/L, trans-lycopene by 0. 34 and 0. 41 μmol/L, and total-cis-lycopene by 0. 24 and 0. 16 μmol/L, whereas no significant changes were found in the placebo treatment.

OBJECTIVES: The objective was to investigate the plasma kinetics of synthetic zeaxanthin after repeated oral doses and to assess the possible influence of other carotenoids on plasma zeaxanthin concentrations. DESIGN: After a run-in of 3 d, 20 healthy volunteers assigned to 2 parallel dose groups received once daily oral doses of either 1 mg (1. 76 micro mol) or 10 mg (17. 6 micro mol) zeaxanthin for 42 d.

Here, we determine the role of these "decision rules" during staged contests in a simple animal, the <b>beadlet</b> sea anemone Actinia equina using a recently suggested approach of analyzing 1) traits linked to resource holding potential (RHP), 2) relationships between RHP and contest duration, and 3) contest dynamics. Depending on the activities used in the encounter, RHP, is linked to overall body size, the size of stinging nematocyst weapons, or by the ability to land blows on the opponent. Furthermore, changes in the intensity of aggression as the contest progresses indicate the use of 2 distinct types of self-assessment-based decision rules, which differ according to whether weapons {{are used in the}} contest. Therefore, these fights in animals that lack a centralized nervous system appear to involve the use of logical decision rules similar to those observed in contests in animals that are often assumed to be more "complex" in their behavior. Indeed, anemones appear to use different sources of information about incurred costs, depending on the intensity of the contest. Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press. ...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Isozymes {{of alcohol}} and other dehydrogenases convert ethanol and retinol to their {{corresponding}} aldehydes in vitro. In addition, new pathways of retinol metabolism have been described in hepatic microsomes that involve, in part, cytochrome P 450 s, which can also metabolize various drugs. In view of these overlapping metabolic pathways, {{it is not surprising}} that multiple interactions between retinol, ethanol, and other drugs occur. Accordingly, prolonged use of alcohol, drugs, or both, results not only in decreased dietary intake of retinoids and carotenoids, but also accelerates the breakdown of retinol through cross-induction of degradative enzymes. There is also competition between ethanol and retinoic acid precursors. Depletion ensues, with associated hepatic and extrahepatic pathology, including carcinogenesis and contribution to fetal defects. Correction of deficiency through vitamin A supplementation has been advocated. It is, however, complicated by the intrinsic hepatotoxicity of retinol, which is potentiated by concomitant alcohol consumption. By contrast, b-carotene, a precursor of vitamin A, was considered innocuous until recently, when it was found to also interact with ethanol, which interferes with its conversion to retinol. Furthermore, the combination of b-carotene with ethanol results in hepatotoxicity. Moreover, in smokers who also consume alcohol, b-carotene supplementation promotes pulmonary cancer and, possibly, cardiovascular complications. Experimentally, b-carotene toxicity was exacerbated when administered as part of <b>beadlets.</b> Thus ethanol, while promoting a deficiency of vitamin A also enhances its toxicity as well as that of b-carotene. This narrowing of the therapeutic window for retinol and b-carotene must be taken into account when formulating treatments aimed at correcting vitamin A deficiency, especially in drinking populations.

40|$|EN] The {{importance}} of dietary lipids for carotenoid-based ornaments {{has rarely been}} investigated, although theory predicts that dietary lipids may control {{the development of these}} widespread animal signals. Dietary lipids have been suggested to enhance the expression of male carotenoid-based ornaments because they provide carotenoids with a hydrophobic domain that facilitates their absorption and transport. Dietary lipids may also enhance the uptake of tocopherols (vitamin E), which share common absorption and transport routes with carotenoids. Here, we test whether dietary lipids enhance carotenoid availability and male carotenoid-based colorations. We also explore the effects of dietary lipids on plasma tocopherol concentration, which allow disentangling between different pathways that may explain how dietary lipids affect ornamental expression. 2. Following a two-factorial design, we manipulated dietary access of naturally occurring fatty acids (oleic acid) and carotenoids (lutein and zeaxanthin) and measured its effects on the circulating concentrations of carotenoids (lutein and zeaxanthin) and vitamin E (α- and γ-(β-) tocopherols) and on the ventral, carotenoid-based coloration of male common lizards (Lacerta vivipara). 3. Lutein but not zeaxanthin plasma concentrations increased with carotenoid supplementation, which, however, did not affect coloration. Lipid intake negatively affected circulating concentrations of lutein and γ-(β-) tocopherol and led to significantly less orange colorations. The path analysis suggests that a relationship between the observed colour change and the change in plasma concentrations of γ-(β-) tocopherol may exist. 4. Our study shows {{for the first time that}} dietary lipids do not enhance but reduce the intensity of male carotenoid-based ornaments. Although dietary lipids affected plasma carotenoid concentration, its negative effect on coloration appeared to be linked to lower vitamin E plasma concentrations. These findings suggest that a conflict between dietary lipids and carotenoid and tocopherol uptake may arise if these nutrients are independently obtained from natural diets and that such conflict may reinforce signal honesty in carotenoid-based ornaments. They also suggest that, at least in the common lizard, sexual selection with respect to carotenoid-based coloration may select for males with low antioxidant capacity and thus for males of superior health. © 2012 The Authors.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Grain Science and IndustryGreg AldrichPet {{food is a}} $ 23 billion {{industry}} that continues to grow. Owners continue to humanize their pets and their dietary needs, thus the pet food industry tends to mirror human dietary trends. Currently, pet food is trending towards higher levels of protein, thus lower levels of starch. Decreasing starch, {{one of the main}} structure forming ingredients in extruded foods, creates issues in terms of lower rates of expansion and decreased kibble durability. Consumers tend to dislike ingredients that do not serve a dual nutritional purpose; therefore gelatin may be a plausible binding ingredient for high protein pet foods. Gelatin is a pure protein derived from collagen and is sold as a dry, odorless, tasteless powder. High-bloom gelatins find numerous uses in the human food as a stabilizer, foaming agent, and capsule base among other uses. Low-bloom gelatin may find a value-adding opportunity as a nutritional binder in the pet food market. Four extrusion experiments were performed to test this hypothesis. Experiment 1 compared gelatin at 0 %, 5 %, 10 %, and 15 % inclusion and 15 % gelatin at 3 different extruder screw speeds. Results showed a decrease in expansion but an increase in hardness and pellet durability index (PDI); however there may have been inadequate preconditioning. It was unclear whether the decrease in expansion or presence of gelatin improved product durability. Experiment 2 analyzed two levels of gelatin, 0 % and 10 %, under two extruder screw speeds, 300 rpm and 500 rpm, and two hydration ratios, 17 % and 28 %. In this experiment, there were no differences in density, expansion, hardness, or PDI. This indicated that preconditioning was more ideal and may indicate gelatin does not decrease product expansion. Experiment 3 analyzed two levels of gelatin, 0 % and 10 %, at two target densities, low and high. Results indicated that gelatin created a more expanded product when processed under similar conditions as a control formula. Experiment 4 analyzed different strengths of gelatin to determine if the low-bloom gelatin experiments were repeatable with more conventional strength gelatins. Treatments were a control with no gelatin, and a 100 bloom, 175 bloom, and 250 bloom gelatin. Results showed increased gelatin strength increased product expansion, likely through a foaming effect. However, durability declined with mid- and high-bloom gelatins; thus, low-bloom gelatin may be the most promising to improve product characteristics and preserve durability. Two additional experiments were performed in order to explore gelatin bloom strength in injection molded treat processing. A lab-scale experiment was performed to optimize an initial formula. Tensile strength, strain at break, Young’s Modulus, puncture force, and peaks were measured. It was determined that equal parts gelatin, gluten, and glycerin were most ideal for further testing purposes. Determination of gelatin bloom strength effects with three bloom strength gelatins were used to produce <b>beadlets</b> on a pilot-scale twin-screw extruded and production model injection molding system. Differences were noted between treatments; wherein high bloom gelatin created a softer, more stretchy treat and low bloom gelatin created a tougher, more rubbery treat. Low-bloom gelatin may find use as a nutritional binder in high protein pet foods and may be an alternative to high-bloom gelatin in injection molded dental treats...|$|E
40|$|The {{identification}} of the hydrolysis and photodegradation products of flexible polyurethane foams (PUFs) with addition of biooriginated and biodegradable additive was the first topic of this dissertation work. Separation of polyurethane foam hydrolysis degradation products, designed for ecotoxicological tests, was managed by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (HPLC/MS). The degradations product structure was elucidated by tandem mass spectrometry (MSn). PUF photodegradation products were obtained by exposure of materials by irradiation at 254 nm. Semi-volatile degradation products were isolated from the exposed polyurethane by n-hexane extraction; volatile compounds were collected by solid phase microextraction (SPME). Gas chromatography with mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and complete orthogonal tandem gas chromatography with mass spectrometry (GCxGC/TOF MS) was used for separation and {{identification of}} photodegradation products. The influence of the bio-filler {{on the character of}} degradation products and the possible effect of PUF degradation products on the environment was discussed {{at the end of this}} section. The determination of isoprostanes – markers of oxidative stress in tissues of <b>beadlet</b> anemone (Actinia equina) was the subject of the second topic. F 2 -isoprostanes were synthesized from the arachidonic acid. With thereby prepared isoprostanes the method of determination by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC/MS/MS) was developed and optimized. The isoprostane isolation process from the Actinia equina tissues was optimized with solid phase extraction (SPE). The resulting methodology was used to quantify isoprostanes in tissues of anemones, which were exposed to both moderate and high temperature changes. The temperature changes were used to initiate the oxidative stress in organisms. In addition, concentration levels of unknown compounds were also monitored. These unknown compounds were extracted from tissues together with F 2 -isoprostanes and their identity is discussed in this dissertation work too. The possibility of using isoprostane levels in the Anthozoa tissues for the oxidative stress monitoring is discussed in the conclusion of this work...|$|R
