Verification bias arises if the reference standard cannot be applied to all patients, if investigators use different reference standards or simply because there is no reference standard.

40|$|Abstract—Pre-whitening of fMRI time-series is {{commonly}} performed to address temporal autocorrelations. The pre-whitening procedure requires {{knowledge of the}} spatially dependent autocorrelations, which in turn must be estimated from the observed data. The accuracy of the autocorrelation estimation algorithm is important because biased autocorrelation estimates result in <b>biased</b> <b>test</b> statistics, thereby increasing the expected false-positive and/or false-negative rates. Thus, a methodology for testing the accuracy of autocorrelation estimates and for assessing the performance of today’s state-of-the-art autocorrelation estimation algorithms is needed. To address these problems, we propose an evaluation framework that tests for significant autocorrelation bias in the model residuals of a general linear model analysis. We apply the proposed testing framework to 18 pre-surgical fMRI mapping datasets from ten patients and compare the performance of popula...|$|E

Recently there has been great interest in the problem of demonstrating bioequivalence of treatments, especially in the pharmaceutical industry. One of the reasons is that developing a marketable drug which is bioequivalent (i. e., equivalent in efficacy) to a well established drug typically costs 1 % or less relative to the cost of developing a new one.

Since many of the common methods used to calculate long-run abnormal stock returns following an event are conceptually flawed and often lead to <b>biased</b> <b>test</b> statistics, I focus instead on operating performance over one- and three-year horizon following mergers and acquisitions. I find that there is no significant difference between operating performance of firms that had recent M&A activity and the operating performance of their matching firms, where the matching is done based on industry, market-to-book ratio, and the past operating performance. Overall, small firms tend to have significantly better operating performance following M&A activity than large firms, and firms that report “acquisition of assets” as a form of deal tend to have better operating performance than firms that report “mergers. ” However, the differences in operating performance become insignificant once I account for endogeneity by comparing the operating performance of firms that undergone mergers and acquisitions with that of their matching firms.

40|$|In any {{assessment}} situation, one of {{the major}} goals of the test developers is to ensure that the assessment instrument is free from bias against any identifiable groups. Various differential item functioning (DIF) procedures have been proposed to assess potential bias. DIF occurs when individuals showing the same ability, but belonging to different groups, vary in their probability of getting the item correct (Hambleton, Swaminathan & Rogers, 1991 a). DIF can be classified as either uniform or nonuniform depending on whether there is an interaction between group membership and the ability levels (Penfield, 2003 a). Uniform DIF exists when there is no interaction, alternatively, nonuniform DIF is present when an interaction can be found. While both uniform and nonuniform DIF occur in testing situations, some DIF detection methods assume that DIF is uniform in nature, such as the Simultaneous Item <b>Biased</b> <b>Test</b> (SIBTEST; Stealy & Stout, 1993), or the Mantel-Haenszel statistic (MH; Holland & Thayer, 1988).

Therefore several procedures have been developed to detect both unifor...|$|E
40|$|There are two currentiJ ' popular {{statistical}} {{frameworks for}} addressing measurement {{problems such as}} test development, test-score equating, and the identification of <b>biased</b> <b>test</b> items: classical test theory and item response theory (lRT).

The intent of this module is to provide a nontechnical comparison of classical test theory and item response theory. Forty years ago, Dr. Frederic Lord made the important observation that examinee observed scores and true scores are not synonymous with ability scores: Ability scores are more fundamental because they are test independent whereas observed scores and true scores are test dependent (Lord, 1953). The main idea is that examinees come to a test administration with ability levels or scores in relation to the construct being measured by the test. These ability scores are test independent. However, examinee test scores and corre-sponding true scores will always depend on the selection of assessment tasks from the domain of assessment tasks over which their ability scores are defined.

Admissions committees now rely on the ability of a test to predict students ' performance at their institution to guide their selection. However, minority group members have criticized such uses of test scores. Three potential sources of bias against minority groups include: irrelevance of the test content, particularly verbal content, to their culture and background; discriminatory administration of the testing program; and discrininatory use of the test results.

Many of these assessments are designed and standardized for use with monolingual Standard English-speaking children. It is thus recommended that these assessments should only be used with the populations they were designed for; if not test bias might result. However, such tests are still selected and used in the clinics of many multicultural and multilinguistic communities (e. g., Singapore). This research aimed to explore the performance of 79 Singaporean English-Mandarin pre-school children on the Expressive Vocabulary (EV) sub-test of the CELF Preschool 2 UK and to determine if their performance on the EV sub-test accurately reflected their language abilities by comparing their performance on a local screening language assessment tool, the Singapore English Action Picture Test (SEAPT). Results showed that local children performed poorly as compared to their UK counterparts.

These are necessarily restricted in the number due to the computational constraints. From weather and seasonal prediction it is known that the ensemble size is crucial to yield reliable predictions.

A conceptual model is applied that enables the systematic analysis of ensemble size dependencies in a framework close to that of decadal predictions. Differences are quantified in terms of the confidence intervals coverage and the power of statistical tests for prediction scores.

30|$|As Wise and DeMars (2005, 2006) show, in {{some cases}} low-stakes testing {{conditions}} can lead to fundamentally <b>biased</b> <b>test</b> results. These effects could be intensified {{in the field of}} higher education, {{because of the lack of}} compulsory attendance (Wise and DeMars 2006; Wolf et al. 2015). Students who organize their studies independently—what is explicitly desired—could tend to neglect low-stakes tests. Due to competitive obligations during their studies, they will rather prioritize high-stakes tests that bear serious consequences for their academic progress. Consequently, low-stakes testing in higher education could lead to a higher probability of self-selection effects, as well as to a lower motivation for participating in the respective test. This can threaten the representativeness of the sample and raise the number of not-answered tasks (missing values). In addition, for some types of learners the application of statistical tools represents a serious obstacle, due to their anxiety over such formal methods. Such individuals are often unable to cope with corresponding tasks (Onwuegbuzie 2001). This phenomenon can reinforce the number of missing values and is likely to be intensified if low-stakes testing conditions prevail. This can entail large losses of data points and bias the calculated estimators as well as the identified competence structure. Further, if we consider the missing values as representing participants who lack statistical competencies, this could result in a biased underestimation of these competencies. Therefore, we focus on modeling and measuring prospective VET-educators’ competencies in consuming empirical research under high-stakes testing conditions.|$|E

These disorders are particularly characterized by disturbances to emotional and cognitive processes, which are not currently fully modeled in animals. Assays of cognitive bias have recently been used with animals to give an indication of their emotional/cognitive state. We used a cognitive <b>bias</b> <b>test,</b> alongside a traditional measure of anxiety (elevated plus maze), to investigate the effects of juvenile stress (JS) on adulthood behaviour using a rodent model. During the cognitive <b>bias</b> <b>test,</b> animals were trained to discriminate between two reward bowls based on a stimulus (rough/smooth sandpaper) encountered before they reached the bowls. One stimulus (e. g. rough) was associated with a lower value reward than the other (e. g. smooth). Once rats were trained, their cognitive bias was explored through the presentation of an ambiguous stimulus (intermediate grade sandpaper) : a rat was classed as optimistic if it chose the bowl ordinarily associated with the high value reward. JS animals were lighter than controls, exhibited increased anxiety-like behaviour in the elevated plus maze and were more optimistic in the cognitive <b>bias</b> <b>test.</b> This increased optimism may represent an optimal foraging strategy for these underweight animals. JS animals were also faster than controls to make a decision when presented with an ambiguous stimulus, suggesting altered decision making. These results demonstrate that stress in the juvenile phase can increase anxiety-like behaviour and alter cognitive bias and decision making in adulthood in a rat model...|$|R

40|$|Affective {{states are}} known to {{influence}} behavior and cognitive processes. To assess mood (moderately long-term affective states), the cognitive judgment <b>bias</b> <b>test</b> was developed and has been widely used in various animal species. However, {{little is known about}} how mood changes, how mood can be experimentally manipulated, and how mood then feeds back into cognitive judgment. A recent theory argues that mood reflects the cumulative impact of differences between obtained outcomes and expectations. Here expectations refer to an established context. Situations in which an established context fails to match an outcome are then perceived as mismatches of expectation and outcome. We take advantage of the large number of studies published on non-verbal cognitive <b>bias</b> <b>tests</b> in recent years (95 studies with a total of 162 independent tests) to test whether cumulative mismatch could indeed have led to the observed mood changes. Based on a criteria list, we assessed whether mismatch had occurred with the experimental procedure used to induce mood (mood induction mismatch), or {{in the context of the}} non-verbal cognitive <b>bias</b> procedure (<b>testing</b> mismatch). For the mood induction mismatch, we scored the mismatch between the subjects’ potential expectations and the manipulations conducted for inducing mood whereas, for the testing mismatch, we scored mismatches that may have occurred during the actual testing. We then investigated whether these two types of mismatch can predict the actual outcome of the cognitive bias study. The present evaluation shows that mood induction mismatch cannot well predict the success of a cognitive <b>bias</b> <b>test.</b> On the other hand, testing mismatch can modulate or even inverse the expected outcome. We think, cognitive bias studies should more specifically aim at creating expectation mismatch while inducing mood states to test the cumulative mismatch theory more properly. Furthermore, testing mismatch should be avoided as much as possible because it can reverse the affective state of animals as measured in a cognitive judgment bias paradigm...|$|R
40|$|Clustered data often feature nested {{structures}} and repeated measures. If coupled with binary outcomes and large samples (3 ̆e 10, 000), this complexity {{can lead to}} non-convergence problems for the desired model especially if random effects are used {{to account for the}} clustering. One way to bypass the convergence problem is to split the dataset into small enough sub-samples for which the desired model convergences, and then recombine results from those sub-samples through meta-analysis. We consider two ways to generate sub-samples: the K independent samples approach where the data are split into k mutually-exclusive sub-samples, and the cluster-based approach where naturally existing clusters serve as sub-samples. Estimates or test statistics from either of these sub-sampling approaches can then be recombined using a univariate or multivariate meta-analytic approach. We also provide an innovative approach for simulating clustered and dependent binary data by simulating parameter templates that yield the desired cluster behavior. This approach is used to conduct simulation studies comparing the performance of the K independent samples and cluster-based approaches to generating sub-samples, the results from which are combined either with univariate and multivariate meta-analytic techniques. These studies show that using natural clusters leaded to lower <b>biased</b> <b>test</b> statistics when the number of clusters and treatment effect were large, as compared to the K independent samples approach for both the univariate and multivariate meta-analytic approaches. And the independent samples approach was preferred when the number of clusters and treatment effect were small.

40|$|Abstract Background Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is {{a highly}} {{contagious}} viral disease of even-toed ungulates. Serological diagnosis/surveillance of FMD presents several problems as there are seven serotypes worldwide and {{in the event of}} vaccination {{it may be necessary to}} be able to identify FMD infected/exposed animals irrespective of their vaccination status. The recent development of non-structural 3 ABC protein (NSP) ELISA tests has greatly advanced sero-diagnosis/surveillance as these tests detect exposure to live virus for any of the seven serotypes of FMD, even in vaccinated populations. This paper analyses the performance of three NSP tests using a Bayesian formulation of the Hui-Walter latent class model to estimate test sensitivity and specificity in the absence of a "gold-standard" test, using sera from a well described cattle population in Cameroon with endemic FMD. Results The analysis found a high sensitivity and specificity for both the Danish C-ELISA and the World Organisation for Animal Health (O. I. E.) recommended South American I-ELISA. However, the commercial CHEKIT kit, though having high specificity, has very low sensitivity. The results of the study suggests that for NSP ELISAs, latent class models are a useful alternative to the traditional approach of evaluating diagnostic tests against a known "gold-standard" test as imperfections in the "gold-standard" may give <b>biased</b> <b>test</b> characteristics. Conclusion This study demonstrates that when applied to naturally infected zebu cattle managed under extensive rangeland conditions, the FMD ELISAs may not give the same parameter estimates as those generated from experimental studies. The Bayesian approach allows for full posterior probabilities and capture of the uncertainty in the estimates. The implications of an imperfect specificity are important for the design and interpretation of sero-surveillance data and may result in excessive numbers of false positives in low prevalence situations unless a follow-up confirmatory test such as the enzyme linked immunoelectrotransfer blot (EITB) is used. </p...|$|E

Although precise information is lacking, several lines of evidence attest that up to 95 % early-phase studies may not translate into tangible outcomes for improving clinical management. Major theoretical hurdles exist in the translational process, but is it also undeniable that many studies may have failed for practical reasons, {{such as the use of}} inappropriate diagnostic testing for evaluating efficacy, effectiveness or safety of a given medical intervention, or poor quality in laboratory testing. This can generate <b>biased</b> <b>test</b> results and result in misconceptions during data interpretation, eventually leading to no clinical benefit, possible harm, and a waste of valuable resources. From a genuine economic perspective, it can be estimated that over 10 million euros of funding may be lost each year in clinical trials in the European Union due to preanalytical and analytical problems. These are mostly attributions to the heterogeneity of current guidelines and recommendations for the testing process, to the poor evidence base for basic preanalytical, analytical and post-analytical requirements in clinical trials, and to the failure to thoughtfully integrate the perspectives of clinicians, patients, nurses and diagnostic companies in laboratory best practices. The most rational means for filling the gap between what we know and what we practice in clinical trials cannot discount the development of multidisciplinary teams including research scientists, clinicians, nurses, patients associations and representative of in vitro diagnostic (IVD) companies, who should actively interplay and collaborate with laboratory professionals to adapt and disseminate evidence-based recommendations about biospecimen collection and management into the research settings, from preclinical to phase III studie...|$|E

Sixteen female CD- 1 and 16 female C 57 BL/ 6 mice were trained on a tactile conditional discrimination test with grade of sandpaper as a cue for differential food rewards. Once they had learned the discrimination, half of the mice were subjected to UCMS for three weeks to induce a negative affective state.

However, UCMS affected responses to ambiguous (intermediate) cues in the judgement <b>bias</b> <b>test.</b> While control mice showed a graded response to ambiguous cues, UCMS mice of both strains did not discriminate between ambiguous cues and tended to show shorter latencies to the ambiguous cues and the negative reference cue.
