40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, {{there has been}} a {{tremendous}} increase in the demand for polymeric nanofibres which are promising candidates for various applications including tissue engineering, protective clothing, filtration and sensors. To address this demand, researchers have turned to the development of various techniques such as electrospinning, meltblowing, <b>bicomponent</b> <b>spinning,</b> forcespinning and flash-spinning for the fabrication of polymeric nanofibres. However, electrospinning is the widely used technique for the fabrication of continuous nanofibres. The ability to fabricate nanofibrous assemblies of various materials (such as polymers, ceramics and metals) with possible control of the fibre fineness, surface morphology, orientation and cross-sectional configuration, gives electrospinning an edge over other processes. Although several researches have been done in electrospinning, understanding some of the other processes is still in infancy. In this perspective article, we summarize the fundamentals of various techniques for the fabrication of nanofibres. This paper also highlights a gamut of recent advances in the techniques for nanofibre fabrication...|$|E
40|$|The {{density of}} commercially {{available}} polyacrylonitrile-based carbon fibers {{is in the}} range of 1. 75 - 1. 93 g/cm(3). It will be of great benefit to reduce the density of carbon fiber without compromising mechanical properties, so that high-performance structures made from such fibers can be lighter than those made from the solid carbon fibers. With the goal to produce high-strength and high-modulus carbon fibers with densities {{in the range of}} 0. 9 - 1. 3 g/cm(3), polyacrylonitrile (PAN) based precursor fibers were produced with a honeycomb structure. Using dry-jet wet spinning and an islands-in-a-sea geometry <b>bicomponent</b> <b>spinning</b> method, honeycomb precursor fibers were manufactured that consisted of PAN as the sea component and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) as the islands component. Subsequently, the precursor fibers were stabilized and carbonized to produce hollow carbon fibers. Resulting carbon fibers have an estimated density of around 1. 2 g/cm(3) with high tensile modulus of up to 209 N/tex. Raman spectroscopy mapping of the carbonized honeycomb fiber cross-section exhibited a strong Raman G-band intensity not only at the outer surface of the carbon fiber but also at the surface of inner walls of the honeycomb structure, suggesting that highly ordered graphitic structure was developed at these regions. close...|$|E
40|$|Melt {{spinning}} of {{conductive polymer}} composites (CPCs) is coupled with some difficulties {{such as a}} decrease of conductivity upon drawing and a reduced spinnability with increasing filler concentration. Applying bicomponent technology may provide the possibility to produce fibers from CPCs with a high filler concentration. A pilot-scale <b>bicomponent</b> melt <b>spinning</b> set-up was used to produce core/sheath fibers with fiber titers between 13 and 47 dtex. The sheath material was polyamide 6 (PA 6) or polypropylene (PP) and the core material was a CPC. Two CPCs were used, polypropylene (PP) with carbon black (CB), denoted by PP/CB, and polyethylene (PE) with multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNT), denoted by PE/MWNT. The results showed that both materials could be used with a filler concentration of 10 wt % to obtain melt draw ratios up to 195. The volumetric fraction of core material in the bicomponent structure was 28 %. A heat treatment of PP/CB fibers restored the conductivity {{to the level of}} the undrawn material, corresponding to an increase in conductivity by a factor 5. The same heat treatment had a positive effect on the conductivity of PE/MWNT fibers although the conductivity was not restored...|$|R
