5|$|The path {{originated}} as a {{route for}} the Coastguard to walk from lighthouse to lighthouse patrolling for smugglers. They needed to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> down into every bay and cove: as a result, the path closely hugs the coast providing excellent views but rarely {{the most direct}} path between two points. The South West Coast Path is no longer used by the Coastguard {{but it has been}} transformed from a practical defence system into a resource for recreational walkers. The path is covered by England's right-of-way laws, as amended by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000, which keep historic footpaths open to the public even when they pass through private property. Sections of the path are maintained by the National Trust, which owns parts of the coast.|$|E
25|$|Visual memory, in an {{academic}} environment, entails work with pictures, symbols, numbers, letters, and especially words. Students must <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at a word, form an image of that word in their minds {{and be able to}} recall the appearance of the word later. When teachers introduce a new vocabulary word, generally they write it on the chalkboard, have the children spell it, read it and then use it in a sentence. The word is then erased from the chalkboard. Students with good visual memory will recognize that same word later in their readers or other texts and will be able to recall the appearance of the word to spell it.|$|E
25|$|To reduce {{noise from}} the street, Wright {{eliminated}} street level windows in the temple. Instead, natural light comes from stained glass windows in the roof and clerestories along the upper walls. Because {{the members of the}} parish would not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> outside, Unity Temple's stained glass was designed with green, yellow, and brown tones in order to evoke the colors of nature. The main floor of the temple is accessed via a lower floor (which has seating space), and the room also has two balconies for the seating of the congregation. These varying seating levels allowed the architect to design a building to fit the size of the congregation, but efficiently: no one person in the congregation is more than 40 feet from the pulpit. Wright also designed the building with very good acoustics.|$|E

25|$|The Walking Dead is {{a graphic}} adventure, played from a third-person {{perspective}} {{with a variety}} of cinematic camera angles, in which the player, as protagonist Lee Everett, works with a rag-tag group of survivors to stay alive {{in the midst of a}} zombie apocalypse. The player can examine and interact with characters and items, and must make use of inventory items and the environment. Throughout the game, the player is presented with the ability to interact with their surroundings, and options to determine the nature of that interaction. For example, the player may <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at a character, talk to that character, or if they are carrying an item, offer it to the character or ask them about it. According to Robert Kirkman, The Walking Dead game is focused more on developing characters and story, and less on the action tropes that tend to feature in other zombie-based games, such as Left 4 Dead.|$|E
25|$|In {{racing and}} very-high-performance road cars, other disc {{materials}} have been employed. Reinforced carbon discs and pads inspired by aircraft braking {{systems such as}} those used on Concorde were introduced in Formula One by Brabham in conjunction with Dunlop in 1976. Carbon–carbon braking is now used in most top-level motorsport worldwide, reducing unsprung weight, giving better frictional performance and improved structural properties at high temperatures, compared to cast iron. Carbon brakes have occasionally been applied to road cars, by the French Venturi sports car manufacturer in the mid 1990s for example, but need to reach a very high operating temperature before becoming truly effective and so are not well suited to road use. The extreme heat generated in these systems is easily visible during night racing, especially at shorter tracks. It {{is not uncommon to}} <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at the cars, either live in person or on television and see the brake discs glowing red during application.|$|E
500|$|By this time, Pickingill was {{increasingly}} inflating his age, eventually {{claiming that he}} was 105 years old. This attracted attention from other areas, including London, and in September 1908 a journalist visited Canewdon; he arrived by automobile, the first that Pickingill had ever seen, and allowed the old man to ride in it. The journalist subsequently wrote {{an article about the}} alleged centegenerian, in which he claimed that his name was [...] "Frederick Pickingale"; it is possible that Pickingill gave the false name so that no one would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> up the parish records and discover his real age.|$|E

500|$|In {{spite of}} this, reviewers {{generally}} {{felt that the}} drawbacks of the game were minor in comparison to its strengths. IGN concluded that [...] "Morrowind isn't perfect and its system requirements are huge; but its accomplishments outweigh any reservations." [...] GameSpots review concluded with a similar summation. [...] "Morrowind does have numerous drawbacks .... But they're all generally minor enough that most anyone should <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> past them .... They'll otherwise find that Morrowind fulfills its many ambitious intentions. It's a beautiful-looking, sprawling, and completely open-ended game {{that allows you to}} play pretty much however you like".|$|E
500|$|... "Elegy" [...] {{was written}} by John Shiban and {{directed}} by James Charleston. The episode was inspired by an event that happened when Shiban and his future wife were visiting her father in the hospital. According to Shiban, he was very near death and kept looking around the room, {{even though there were}} only two visitors with him. Eventually, he asked his daughter how many people were in the room. When his daughter revealed that there were only two people with him, he kept looking around the room. Shiban was inspired by the idea that [...] "a dying person might <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> through the cracks [...] into the next world". He developed a premise revolving around a [...] "haunted bowling alley" [...] because [...] "it just seemed right".|$|E

A participating shop in Istanbul closed following an attack by a gang angered by customers drinking beer and playing music during Ramadan, the Muslim holy month of fast. Radiohead released a statement saying: [...] "Our hearts go out to those attacked tonight ...

Unlike Kakashi, who was his senior in the ANBU and referred to him as , Yamato believes ninja should <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> after themselves to the point of leaving behind any he sees as a hindrance. During his childhood, Yamato was abducted by Orochimaru and experimented upon in an attempt to replicate Hashirama's Wood Style. In the anime, the ordeal erased Yamato's memories as he was taken in by Danzo to serve as a Root operative under the code name [...] But after meeting Kakashi, Kinoe eventually left Root and joined the Anbu as Tenzo.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{boasts the}} longest {{title of the}} series and the second-longest of all Star Trek {{television}} installments, behind [...] "For the World Is Hollow and I Have Touched the Sky" [...] of the 1960s series. [...] "Looking for par'Mach" [...] drew inspiration from the 1897 play Cyrano de Bergerac, in which a brilliant Frenchman, resigned {{to the fact that}} the woman he adores will never <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> past his distractingly large nose, helps another man win the lady's heart by dictating beautiful language from nearby. The idea for a modern adaption of Cyrano de Bergerac was proposed by Michael Dorn. [...] "Looking for par'Mach" [...] was directed by Andrew Robinson, who plays the Cardassian Elim Garak on Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. This marked the first time that the actor of a recurring (but not main) Star Trek character had directed an episode in the franchise. Having just received two Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle Awards for theatrical directing, Robinson personally asked executive producer Rick Berman to direct an episode of Deep Space Nine; Robinson was pleased to have been assigned this particular episode.|$|E
500|$|The Sandman {{became a}} cult success for DC Comics and {{attracted}} an audience {{unlike that of}} mainstream comics: much of the readership was female, many were in their twenties, and many read no other comics at all. Comics historian Les Daniels called Gaiman's work [...] "astonishing" [...] and noted that The Sandman was [...] "a mixture of fantasy, horror, and ironic humor such as comic books had never seen before." [...] DC Comics writer and executive Paul Levitz observed that [...] "The Sandman became the first extraordinary success {{as a series of}} graphic novel collections, reaching out and converting new readers to the medium, particularly young women on college campuses, and making Gaiman himself into an iconic cultural figure." [...] Gaiman had a finite run in mind for the series, and it concluded with issue No. 75. Gaiman said in 1996, [...] "Could I do another five issues of Sandman? Well, damn right. And would I <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> {{at myself in the mirror}} happily? No. Is it time to stop because I've reached the end, yes, and I think I'd rather leave while I'm in love." [...] The final issue, No. 75, was dated March 1996.|$|E

500|$|During {{the late}} 20th century {{there was a}} gradual [...] "retreat" [...] from this rule; in Sagnata Investments Ltd v Norwich Corporation, the courts allowed Hansard {{material}} to be submitted to determine the purpose of legislation (but not to interpret the statute), and in Pickstone v Freemans plc, it was allowed {{to assist in the}} understanding of delegated legislation. A noted attack on the rule was made by Lord Denning in Davis v Johnson, where he said that asserting that the courts could not use Hansard was similar to saying that the judges [...] "should grope about in the dark for the meaning of an Act without switching on the light. In some cases Parliament is assured in the most explicit terms what the effect of a statute will be. It is on that footing that members assent to the clause being agreed to. It is on that understanding that an amendment is not pressed. In such cases I think the court should <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at the proceedings." [...] Despite these exceptions, the courts regularly maintained that {{it was not possible to}} use internal Parliamentary discussions as an aid to legislative interpretation. The result of Pepper was a reversal of that rule; a court could use internal Parliamentary discussions where it was relevant to [...] "the very point in question in the litigation", where a piece of legislation is [...] "ambiguous or obscure, or the literal meaning of which leads to an absurdity", with the intention being to understand [...] "the mischief aimed at or the legislative intention lying behind the ambiguous or obscure words".|$|E
