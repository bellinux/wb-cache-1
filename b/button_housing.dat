50|$|For mixed {{wireless}} and wired input doorbells, {{a special}} doorbell button {{is needed to}} maintain power continuously to the doorbell chime. The circuit {{is similar to the}} one above, except that the rectifier diode is now moved into the doorbell <b>button</b> <b>housing.</b> Pressing the doorbell button allows both negative and positive sides of the AC power signal to flow into the circuit, while releasing the button only allows either the positive or negative side to flow into the circuit. By differentiating the full and half wave signals, the doorbell is able to function as it does in the previous wired case, while also providing continuous power to the doorbell for other purposes, such as receiving wireless doorbell button input.|$|E
40|$|The outer {{circumference}} of a BPM button {{and the inner}} {{circumference of}} the <b>button</b> <b>housing</b> comprise a transmission line. This transmission line typically presents an impedance of a few tens of ohms to the beam, and couples very weakly to the 50 ohm coaxial transmission line that comprises the signal path out of the button. The modes which are consequently excited and trapped often have quality factors of several hundred, permitting resonant excitation by the beam. The thermal distortion resulting from trapped mode heating is potentially problematic for achieving the high precision beam position measurements needed to provide the sub-micron beam position stability required by light source users. We present a button design that has been optimized via material selection and component geometry to minimize both the trapped mode heating and the resulting thermal distortion...|$|E

2500|$|A second theme park, Storybook Forest, {{was opened}} in 1976. This park was themed after children's nursery rhymes and fairy tales. One {{of the main}} attractions in Storybook Forest was [...] "Gingerbread Man Pond", a pond created {{in the shape of}} a running {{gingerbread}} man, with two large <b>buttons.</b> The <b>buttons</b> <b>housed</b> Robinson Crusoe's hut and cave. There were also multiple fiberglass sculptures of story characters that are currently spread out around the kiddie areas of Funspot.

5000|$|A Mississippi {{straddle}} {{is similar}} to a live straddle, but instead of being made by the player [...] "under the gun", it can be made by any player, depending on house rules (one common variation is to allow this left of big blind or on the <b>button).</b> <b>House</b> rules permitting Mississippi straddles are common in the southern United States. Like a live straddle, a Mississippi straddle must be at least the minimum raise. Action begins with the player {{to the left of the}} straddle (in a common variation, action starts left of the big blind, skips over the straddle who is last). If, for example (in a game with $10-25 blinds), the button puts a live $50 on it, the first player to act would be the small blind, followed by the big blind, and so on. If action gets back to the straddle with no raise, the straddle has the option of raising. The player to the left of a Mississippi straddle may re-straddle by placing a blind bet raising the original straddle.|$|R

25|$|Some {{models have}} a hush or {{temporary}} silence feature that allows silencing, typically by pressing a <b>button</b> on the <b>housing,</b> without removing the battery. This is especially useful in locations where false alarms can be relatively common (e.g. near a kitchen), or users might remove the battery permanently {{to avoid the}} annoyance of false alarms, preventing the alarm from detecting a fire should one break out.|$|R
50|$|Mylnhurst was {{constructed}} in the neo gothic style, it cost £14,000, a considerable amount at the time, the house was large for a family home, but the Greaves Blakes needed the space as they had twelve children. Mylnhurst was renowned for its large beautiful gardens, with lake, Japanese garden, greenhouses and vinery. The {{early part of the}} 1900s saw a considerable parcel of land sold off to create the <b>housing</b> on <b>Button</b> Hill and Millhouses Lane, the lake was filled in at this time. In 1908 Major Greaves Blake's son Philip married Dorothy Barbour and they were given a piece of Mylnhurst land to construct their own home, known as <b>Button</b> Hill <b>House</b> at 1 Woodholm Road.|$|R
50|$|When the Walsh {{family moved}} to a house at Ranmoor in 1933 Mylnhurst was sold to the Sisters of Mercy {{for use as a}} school to cater for the Catholic {{community}} of Ecclesall. The adjacent <b>Button</b> Hill <b>House</b> was sold to the Sisters in 1936 and was used as a boarding house for Mylnhurst pupils, it later became known as St Gerards and housed novitiates, afterwards it was used as university lodgings before being demolished to make way for bungalows on Woodholm Road. The school began with seven pupils when it first opened and was known as Mylnhurst High School, changing later to Mylnhurst Convent School. By 1935 there were 96 pupils including 10 boarders and the old billiards room had been converted into a dining room.|$|R
5000|$|In 1766 {{the island}} was leased by Button Gwinnett, a signer of the Declaration of Independence. It was run as a {{plantation}} for nearly a century, until the Civil War ended. The New Georgia Encyclopedia notes that After the Civil War, Sherman's Field Order No. 15 awarded St. Catherines and the other islands to freed slaves. Tunis Campbell established dominion over Ossabaw, Sapelo, and St. Catherines islands as [...] "governor," [...] with {{the seat of his}} kingdom on St. Catherines. Under the auspices of Sherman's field order, Campbell ruled from the <b>Button</b> Gwinnett <b>House</b> from 1865 until 1867.

2500|$|Damaged power cords of {{portable}} air conditioners cause many electrical fires and about 350 deaths per year. To combat this, each portable air conditioner {{sold in the}} United States is now required to have a leakage current detector interrupter (LCDI) or ground-fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) protective device built into its power cord. The device can be integral with the power plug, or a separate module within 12 inches of the plug. An LCDI cord has a fine wire mesh around the conductors, and circuitry to detect current leaking from the conductors to the mesh, which {{would happen if the}} cord were damaged or frayed. The plugs are normal NEMA 5-15, 5-20, 6-15, 6-20 or 6-30 plugs, depending on the air conditioner, typically molded-on plugs.

40|$|This {{extended}} abstract {{describes a}} new platform for robotic manipulation research that {{was inspired by}} some of the first toys that human infants learn to manipulate. It summarizes the results of our existing research on pressing buttons and formulates some ideas for future work. Motivation and Inspiration Figure 1 : My son in his Baby Gym. When my son was growing up I noticed that it took him almost 5 months to learn how to press a button reliably on one of his toys. The toy had a number of buttons, sliders, levers, and knobs that could be manipulated (see Figure 1). These toys come in many varieties and in recent years some toy manufacturers have started to call them Baby Gyms. Initially my son was more interested in exploring the plastic casing of the button instead of the button itself. He had to learn what the button looks like and how and where to press it. This learning process started when he was 4. 5 months old and continued until he was 9 months old. Once he had mastered this skill, however, he knew how to detect other <b>buttons</b> around the <b>house.</b> Furthermore, he knew that these devices are for pushing and he knew how to push them. Light switches, keyboard keys and microwave buttons were now intuitively obvious to him {{as they were in the}} same equivalence class with that first button. Similar developmental sequences were observed for a number of other devices present in the baby gym. Copyright © 2011, Association for the Advancement of Artificia...|$|R
