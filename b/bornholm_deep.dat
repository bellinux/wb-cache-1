40|$|SummaryThe article {{presents}} data on heavy metal – Hg, Pb, Cd and Zn – {{distribution in the}} layers of marine sediments from the off-shore areas of the southern Baltic Sea: Gdańsk Deep, SE Gotland Basin and <b>Bornholm</b> <b>Deep.</b> Depth profiles of metal concentrations were converted to time-based profiles using the 210 Pb dating method and verified by 137 Cs distribution in the vertical profile. The linear sedimentation rates in the Gdańsk Deep and SE Gotland Basin are similar, 0. 18 cmyr− 1 and 0. 14 cmyr− 1, respectively, while {{the region of the}} <b>Bornholm</b> <b>Deep</b> is characterized by a greater sedimentation rate: 0. 31 cmyr− 1. Regarding anthropogenic pressure, Gdańsk Deep receives the largest share among the analyzed regions. The maximal metal concentrations detected in this area were Zn – 230 mgkg− 1, Pb – 77 mgkg− 1, Cd – 2. 04 mgkg− 1 and Hg – 0. 27 mgkg− 1. The least impact of anthropogenic pressure was noticeable in SE Gotland Basin. The combination of sediment dating with the analysis of vertical distribution of heavy metals in sediments benefited in the determination of target metal concentrations used in environmental status assessments. Reference values of heavy metal concentrations in marine sediments were determined as: Zn – 110 mgkg− 1, Pb – 30 mgkg− 1, Cd – 0. 3 mgkg− 1 and Hg – 0. 05 mgkg− 1 from the period of minor anthropogenic pressure. Basing on the determined indices: enrichment factor (EF), geoaccumulation indicator (Igeo) and contamination factor (CF) the status of marine environment was assessed regarding the pollution with heavy metals...|$|E
40|$|The first {{measurements}} o f salinity o f {{the deep}} {{water in the}} open Baltic Sea {{were made in the}} last decades of the 1800 s. At a Scandinavian science meeting in Copenhagen in 1892, Professor Otto Pettersson from Sweden suggested that regular measurements o f hydrographic parameters should be carried out at some important deep stations in the Baltic Sea. His suggestion was adopted and since that time we have rather complete hydrographical data from the <b>Bornholm</b> <b>Deep,</b> the Gotland Deep, and the Landsort Deep and from some stations in the Gulf o f Bothnia. The measurements were interrupted in the Baltic Proper during the two World Wars. At the beginning only salinity, temperature and dissolved oxygen were measured and one or two expeditions were carried out annually, mostly in summer. In the 1920 s also alkalinity and pH were occasionally measured and total carbonate was calculated. A few nutrient measurements were also carried out. After World War II we find results from four or more expeditions every year and intercalibration o f methods was arranged. Results o f temperature, salinity and dissolved oxygen measurements from the <b>Bornholm</b> <b>Deep,</b> the Gotland Deep, the Landsort Deep and salinity measurements from three stations in the Gulf o f Bothnia, covering the whole 20 th century are presented and discussed. The salinity distribution and the variations between oxygen and hydrogen sulphide periods in the deep water o f the Gotland Deep and the Landsort Deep are demonstrated. Series o f phosphate and nitrate distribution in the Gotland Deep are shown from the 1950 s to the present and the effects o f the stagnant conditions are briefly discussed.

Absolute fecun-dity in relation to body length and age, as well as relative fe-cundity, showed no {{differences between the two}} subdivisions, whereas absolute fecundity in relation to body weight was slightly higher in females from the Gdańsk Deep. Absolute fecundity in relation to age showed a high variability, par-ticularly among age classes 5 and older.

The conception of these interactions may, however, be biased {{by the lack of}} couplings to the microbial food web and direct errors in diet analyses (e. g. differences in digestion rate between food types). In this thesis, I examined the planktonic food web by analyzing the trophic structure (i. e. trophic levels) with an alternative technique, the abundances and fractionation of stable isotope. I used natural abundances of stable isotopes of nitrogen (delta 15 N) and carbon (delta 13 C) to describe the food web structure of mesozooplankton communities in the Central Baltic Sea (<b>Bornholm</b> Basin, Gdansk <b>deep</b> and Gotland Basin) and Southern North Sea (German Bight). I focused on assessing spatial and seasonal isotopic variation with respect to trophic levels of the dominant mesozooplankton species in both marine systems.

40|$|A {{medium-sized}} inflow (about 200 km 3 {{according to}} IOW data, - personal communication) of saline {{water into the}} southern Baltic Sea occurred during January 2003. Unlike any previously observed inflow, this one brought very cold water, of temperatures around 1 - 2 °C and less. Since {{the temperature of the}} deep water in the southern Baltic before the inflow was exceptionally high (11 - 12 °C), the inflowing waters produced dramatic changes and a steep temperature gradient. The movement of the inflowing waters through the deep basins and channels of the Baltic Sea from the Arkona Basin to the Gdansk Deep during next 4 - 8 months is described. Frequent mesoscale structures and intensive mixing followed the eastward transport of the inflow water, particularly in the <b>Bornholm</b> <b>Deep</b> and S&# 322;upsk Furrow.

40|$|This study summarises all the {{accessible}} data on old German {{chemical weapons}} {{dumped in the}} Baltic Sea. Mr. Goncharov formulated a concept of ecological impact evaluation of chemical warfare agents (CWA) on the marine environment and structured a simulation model adapted to the specific character of the hydrological condition and hydrobiological subjects of the <b>Bornholm</b> <b>Deep.</b> The mathematical model he has created describes the spreading of contaminants by currents and turbulence in the near bottom boundary layer. Parameters of CWA discharge through corrosion of canisters were given for various kinds of bottom sediments with allowance for current velocity. He created a method for integral estimations and a computer simulation model and completed a forecast for CWA "Mustard", which showed that in normal hydrometeorological conditions there are local toxic plumes drifting along the bottom for a distance of up to several kilometres. With storm winds the toxic plumes from separate canisters interflow and lengthen and can reach fishery areas near Bornholm Island. When salt water from the North Sea flows in, the length of toxic zones can increase up to and over 100 kilometres and toxic water masses can spread into the northern Baltic. On this basis, Mr. Goncharov drew up recommendations to reduce dangers for human ecology and proposed {{the creation of a}} special system for the forecasting and remote sensing of the environmental conditions of CWA burial places...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{discusses}} {{predictions of}} {{particulate organic carbon}} (POC) concentrations in the southern Baltic Sea. The study {{is based on the}} one-dimensional Particulate Organic Carbon Model (1 D POC), described in detail by Dzierzbicka-Głowacka et al. (2010 a). The POC concentration is determined as the sum of phytoplankton, zoo-plankton and dead organic matter (detritus) concentrations. Temporal changes in the phytoplankton biomass are caused by primary production, mortality, grazing by zooplankton and sinking. The zooplankton biomass is affected by ingestion, excretion, faecal production, mortality and carnivorous grazing. The changes in the pelagic detritus concentration are determined by the input of dead phytoplankton and zooplankton, the natural mortality of predators, faecal pellets, and sinks – sedimentation, zooplankton grazing and biochemical decomposition. The model simulations were done for selected locations in the southern Baltic Sea (Gdańsk Deep, <b>Bornholm</b> <b>Deep</b> and Gotland Deep) under predicted conditions characterized by changes of temperature, nutrient concentrations and light availability. The results cover the daily, monthly, seasonal and annual POC concentration patterns in the upper water layer. If the assumed trends in light, nutrients and temperature in the southern Baltic correctly predict the conditions in 2050, our calculations indicate that we can expect a two- to three-fold increase in POC concentration in late spring and a shift towards postponed maximum POC concentration. It can also be anticipated that, {{as a result of the}} increase in POC, oxygenation of the water layer beneath the halocline will decrease, while the supply of food to organisms at higher trophic levels will increase...|$|E
40|$|International audienceMysid shrimps are an {{important}} trophic link in the food web of the Baltic Sea. In 2002 and 2003 we investigated species composition, distribution, life cycle and prey in the Bornholm Basin (central Baltic). Three species and one genus were identified: and sp The dominant and occurred in the whole study area but were more abundant in the peripheral, more shallow regions. Size frequency distribution indicated one generation for and probably two for Main prey of all size classes in both species was the cladoceran during summer and autumn. In spring and winter also copepods of the species and were important prey items. Detritus and phytoplankton cells were of minor importance and many individuals had empty guts. Mysid shrimps in the deep basin might be advected from more shallow areas, as the abundance of all species was much lower than in coastal regions. The <b>deep</b> <b>Bornholm</b> Basin {{does not seem to}} be a favourable habitat, probably due to the inaccessibility of the oxygen deficient bottom layer.

40|$|The {{winter of}} 1998 / 1999 was mild {{in the entire}} Baltic Sea area. The summer was among the five warmest since 1946, all of it {{occurred}} in the 1990 s. The September 1999 was the warmest since 1946. The mild winter led to sea surface temperatures in the Baltic Sea that were about 1 K above the long-term mean during winter and early spring. This resulted in relatively warm water of 3 - 4 C being trapped in the summer intermediate water layer of the central Baltic Sea. The surface temperatures in the summer reached positive anomalies up to 4 K in the 20 m upper layer due to the warm summer. The deep water temperatures of the central Baltic Sea were still anomalously high due to the inflow of warm water in 1997, 0. 2 - 1. 7 K above the mean for the period 1950 - 1998. The weather conditions in winter 1998 / 1999 {{gave rise to a}} low inflow activity across the sills into the Baltic with only small inflows. Inflows in October and late December 1998 led only to the aeration of the <b>Bornholm</b> Basin <b>deep</b> water in spring 1999. From May ownwards hydrogen sulphide was measured in the Bornholm Basin up to the end of November when other small inflows led again to oxic conditions. A major inflow event did not occur. In the eastern Gotland Basin, the anoxic water covered the layer between bottom and about 130 m depth all year round. In the deep water of the western Gotland Basin, oxygen depletion has continued since 1993. The decrease in oxygen concentration led in August 1999 to the formation of hydrogen sulphide in the near-bottom layer {{for the first time since}} the mid- 1980 s. In 1999, the area of the whole central Baltic deep water which was affected by oxygen deficiency and anoxic conditions was the largest in the past 15 years. (orig.)

40|$|A 1 -D biogeochemical/physical {{model of}} marine systems {{has been applied}} to study the oxygen cycle in four {{stations}} of different sub-basins of the Baltic Sea, namely, in the Gotland <b>Deep,</b> <b>Bornholm,</b> Arkona and Fladen. The model consists of the biogeochemical model of Neumann et al. (2002) coupled with the 1 -D General Ocean Turbulence Model (GOTM). The model has been forced with meteorological data from the ECMWF reanalysis project for the period 1998 – 2003, producing a six year hindcast which is validated with datasets from the Baltic Environmental Database (BED) for the same period. The vertical profiles of temperature and salinity are relaxed towards both profiles provided by 3 -D simulations of General Estuarine Transport Model (GETM) and observed profiles from BED. Modifications in the parameterisation of the air-sea oxygen fluxes have led to a significant improvement of the model results in the surface and intermediate water layers. The largest mismatch with observations is found in simulating the oxygen dynamics in the Baltic Sea bottom waters. The model results demonstrate the good capability of the model to predict the time-evolution of the physical and biogeochemical variables at all different stations. Comparative analysis of the modelled oxygen concentrations with respect to observation data is performed to distinguish the relative importance of several factors on the seasonal, interannual and long-term variations of oxygen. It is found that natural physical factors, like the magnitude of the vertical turbulent mixing, wind speed and the variation of temperature and salinity fields are the major factors controlling the oxygen dynamics in the Baltic Sea. The influence of limiting nutrients is less pronounced, at least under the nutrient flux parameterisation assumed in the model...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} various {{scenarios of}} the {{particulate organic carbon}} (POC) in the southern Baltic Sea. The study {{is based on a}} one-dimensional Particulate Organic Carbon model (1 -D POC). Mathematically, the pelagic variables of 1 -D POC model are described by a second-order partial differential equations of the diffusion type with biogeochemical sources and sinks. The POC concentration is determined as the sum of phytoplankton, zooplankton and dead organic matter (detritus) concentrations. The temporal changes in the phytoplankton biomass are caused by primary production, mortality, grazing by zooplankton and sinking. The zooplankton biomass is affected by ingestion, excretion, faecal production, mortality, and carnivorous grazing. The changes in the pelagic detritus concentration are determined by input of: dead phytoplankton and zooplankton, natural mortality of predators, faecal pellets, and sinks: sedimentation, zooplankton grazing and biochemical decomposition. The 1 -D POC model was used to simulate temporal dynamics of POC in the southern Baltic Sea (Gdansk Deep, <b>Bornholm</b> <b>Deep</b> and Gotland Deep) under scenarios characterized by different temperature, nutrients and light. Daily, monthly, seasonal and annual variabilities of POC in the upper water layer are presented for the different scenarios. The starting-point of the numerical simulations was assumed as average values of the investigated pelagic variables for 1965 – 1998 period. Two- to three-fold increases of POC concentrations in late spring were revealed as well as the shift towards postponed maximum POC concentration. It is speculated that, due to POC increase, oxygenation of under-halocline water layer will decrease, while supply of food to organisms from higher trophic level should increase...|$|E

Our {{samples of}} bottom sediments from Kurshskii Bay were {{determined}} to contain from 15 to 26 ppm As and up to 34 ppm As {{in the vicinity of}} the Neman River mouth. Elevated As concentrations (50 - 114 ppm) were detected in four columns of subsurface bottom sediments (at depths of 10 - 65 cm) from the Vistula Lagoon. Elevated As concentrations (50 - 180 ppm) were also found in a few surface samples of sand from the Gdansk Deep near oil platform D- 6. These sediments are either partly contaminated with anthropogenic As or contain Fe sulfides and glauconite, which can concentrate As and contain its elevated concentrations. The As concentration in columns of bottom sediments from the Gulf of Finland were at the natural background level (throughout the columns) typical of the area (9 - 34 ppm). We repeatedly detected very high As concentrations (up to 227 ppm As) in politic ooze from <b>Bornholm</b> <b>Deep,</b> {{in the vicinity of the}} sunken vessel with chemical weapons.

40|$|The first {{baroclinic}} Rossby {{radius of}} deformation (R 1) {{is a fundamental}} horizontal scale of mesoscale processes. This scale is important for planning both numerical modelling and study areas. R 1 was computed {{on the basis of}} an 11 -year series of high resolution CTD measurements collected during r/v "Oceania" cruises. The data set covered the three main basins of the Baltic Proper: the Bornholm Basin (BB), the Słupsk Furrow (SF) and the Gdańsk Basin (GB). The smallest mean value of R 1 was found in the Gdańsk Basin (5. 2 km), the largest one in the <b>Bornholm</b> <b>Deep</b> (7. 3 km). The seasonal variability of R 1 is lower in the western basin than in the eastern one. The seasonal cycle of R 1 may be broken by extreme events, e. g. main Baltic inflows (MBI) of saline water. The inflowing water rebuilds the vertical stratification in the southern Baltic Sea and dramatically changes the R 1 values. The difference of R 1 between a stagnation period and an inflow situation is shown on the basis of observations made during 2002 - 2003. The main inflow occurred in winter, after ten years of stagnation, and the very low values of R 1 (about 4 km) changed to very high ones (more than 9 km). Analysis of stagnation and saltwater inflow events may throw light on the value of R 1 in future climatic scenarios. The potential influence of climate change on Baltic Sea salinity, especially a decrease in MBI activity, may change the baroclinic Rossby radius of deformation and the mesoscale dynamics. Values of R 1 are expected to be lower in the future climate than those measured nowadays...|$|E
40|$|Organic {{substances}} {{are important}} {{components of the}} marine environment as they determine the properties of seawater and the key biogeochemical processes taking place in it. Organic carbon (OC) {{is a measure of}} organic matter. For practical purposes, OC is divided into dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and particulate organic carbon (POC). Both DOC and POC {{play a major role in}} the carbon cycle, especially in shelf seas like the Baltic, where their concentrations are substantial. In a three-year study (2009 – 2011) seawater samples for DOC and POC measurements were collected from stations located in the Gdańsk Deep, the Gotland Deep and the <b>Bornholm</b> <b>Deep.</b> The accuracy and precision of analysis were satisfactory; the recovery was better than 95 %, and the relative standard deviation was 4 % (n = 5). Concentrations of chlorophyll a, phaeopigment a, salinity, pH and temperature were also measured in the same samples. These parameters were selected as proxies of processes contributing to DOC and POC abundance. The aim of the study was to address questions regarding the vertical, horizontal and seasonal dynamics of both DOC and POC in the Baltic Sea and the factors influencing carbon concentrations. In general, the highest concentrations of both DOC and POC were recorded in the surface water layer (DOC~ 4. 7  mg dm− 3, POC~ 0. 6  mg dm− 3) as a consequence of intensive phytoplankton activity, and in the halocline layer (DOC~ 5. 1  mg dm− 3, POC~ 0. 4  mg dm− 3). The lowest DOC and POC concentrations were measured in the sub-halocline water layer, where the values did not exceed 3. 5  mg dm− 3 (DOC) and 0. 1  mg dm− 3 (POC). Seasonally, the highest DOC and POC concentrations were measured during the growing season: surface DOC~ 5. 0  mg dm− 3; sub-halocline DOC~ 4. 1  mg dm− 3 and surface POC~∼ 0. 9  mg dm− 3, sub-halocline POC~∼ 0. 2  mg dm− 3. The ANOVA Kruskal-Wallis test results indicate statistically significant differences among the three study sites regarding average concentrations, and concentrations in particular water layers and seasons. It shows that concentrations of DOC and POC differ in sub-basins of the Baltic Sea. The differences were attributed to the varying distances from river mouths to study sites or the different starting times and/or durations of the spring algal blooms. Statistically significant dependences were found between both DOC and POC concentrations and Chl a (phytoplankton biomass), pH (phytoplankton photosynthetic rate), pheo (zooplankton sloppy feeding), salinity (river run-off and North Sea water inflows) and water temperature (season). This was taken as proof that these factors influence DOC and POC in the study areas...|$|E
40|$|Within SWECLIM a 3 D fully coupled ice-ocean {{model has}} been {{developed}} based on the massively parallel OCCAM code from Southampton. Compared to the global OCCAM the model has to be adopted to Baltic Sea conditions with implementations of high-frequent atmospheric forcing fields in connection with adequate bulk formulae for wind stress, heat uxes and freshwater uxes, solar radiation, river runoff, active open boundary conditions, a second-order moment turbulence closure scheme and a dynamic-thermodynamic sea ice model. Thereby, state-of-the-art sub-models and parameterizations have been used. RCO is the first 3 D coupled ice-ocean model for the Baltic Sea with the above mentioned specifications suitable for use on mpp computers like CRAY-T 3 E's. Thus, a milestone for 3 D ocean model development has been set. No other model is as fast as RCO. The performance has been improved significantly using advanced algorithms to optimize processor maps. This guarantees work load balance between the different processors. From now on {{it is possible to}} perform longterm simulations (10 years) within SWECLIM using a sufficiently resolved 3 D Baltic Sea model. The open boundary conditions have been tested. They allow waves to radiate out of the model domain and signals prescribed at the border to in uence the model interior. No significant trends (like emptying or filling) have been observed which might prevent longer integrations of the system. An option has been included in RCO for active open boundary conditions also for temperature and salinity. For the first time the turbulence closure {{model has been}} tested within a 3 D model in all Baltic sub-basins. The new flux boundary conditions for turbulent kinetic energy parameterizing breaking surface waves perform well. First results for the hindcast period 1992 / 93 are presented. Therefor, realistic atmospheric, runoff and boundary data have been used. The model is initialized using observed profile temperature and salinity data. A spin-up period of 3 months starting in May is sufficient to smooth out artificial gradients from the initialization procedure and to turn in basin wide volume changes correctly. The model results have been compared to sea level, sea surface temperature, temperature/salinity profile and ice thickness/compactness data with good agreement. Basin wide volume changes as well as daily sea level oscillations are simulated surprisingly good. Sea surface temperatures follow the observed seasonal cycle. Up- and downwelling events in RCO occur as observed with the right frequency and area extent but the sst's tend to be colder in upwelling and warmer in downwelling regions compared to observations. Mixed layer depths, which are important for the ocean heat content, agree well with previous model studies which are validated against observations intensively (Meier, 1996). The water exchange between Baltic and North Sea crucial for multi-year integrations is modelled realistically. Especially the salt water inflow in January 1993 can be reproduced. The bottom water in Bornholm Basin is replaced by new water originating from the North Sea but maximum observed bottom salinities at <b>Bornholm</b> <b>Deep</b> are underestimated by 1 - 2 PSU. Freezing, breakup date and maximum ice extent are in good correspondence with observations. Improved parameterizationsresult in modelled ice thicknesses as observed whereas other authors report too large ice thicknesses and delayed ice melting (e. g., Haapala and Lepp 7 ̆faranta, 1996). Multi-year simulations including mild, normal and severe winters will be necessary to elucidate this problem further. A comparison between an experiment with full dynamic-thermodynamics and one without dynamic effects reveals the importance of ice advection under wind influence. A process study from the beginning of February 1993 showed that under strong wind conditions a hole in the ice coverage can open with the size of half of the Bothnian Bay. At the end of January 1993 the Bothnian Bay, the coastal area of the Bothnian Sea and the eastern parts of the Gulf of Finland are ice covered. A couple of days later westerly winds led to wide open areas in the western Bothnian Bay while ice piled up at the eastern coasts to a correct amount. This phenomenon can be modelled only with ice dynamics included. The aim of SWECLIM is to increase our knowledge of the effects of climate change in Sweden and the other Nordic countries. Therefor, it is necessary to understand the present climate. For the Baltic Sea even the knowledge about the present mean state and its transients is rather poor. Only a small number of long-time observations like sea level records (for example from Stockholm, see Ekman (1988)), maximum annual ice extent (e. g., Palosuo, 1953; Sein 7 ̆fa and Palosuo, 1993) or temperature and salinityprofiles from monitoring stations in some of the sub-basins (e. g., Matth 7 ̆faus and Frank, 1992) are available. These informations are not enough to understand the driving mechanisms of mean horizontal and vertical transports of energy, momentum and matter. 3 D Baltic Sea models like RCO will close this knowledge gap in future. Thereby, {{it will be possible to}} close the water and energy cycle of the Baltic catchment area, a final goal of BALTEX. By applying atmospheric forcing data from scenario simulations in one- or two-way coupled mode it will be possible to make predictions of climate change for the Baltic Sea. Impact studies of the future marine environment will be available using detailed highly resolved information from RCO. This report presents a powerful tool for solving these and other tasks...|$|E
