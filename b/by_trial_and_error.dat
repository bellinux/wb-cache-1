5|$|From {{the start}} of his Cairo posting Clarke learned the art of {{deception}} <b>by</b> <b>trial</b> <b>and</b> <b>error.</b> From mistakes during Camilla he learned to focus on what he wanted the enemy to do rather than on what he wanted them to think. From another early operation (K-Shell, the spreading of rumours about a new Allied super-shell which eventually petered out after the media picked up the story), he learned the value of conducting deception only when there was a clear objective, rather than because it was possible. From Bastion he discovered the difficulty of running a large deception on a short timescale. From these lessons Clarke evolved his principles of deception.|$|E

5|$|Members of {{the genus}} Portia have hunting tactics as {{versatile}} and adaptable as a lion's. All members of Portia have instinctive tactics for their most common prey, but can improvise <b>by</b> <b>trial</b> <b>and</b> <b>error</b> against unfamiliar prey or in unfamiliar situations, and then remember the new approach. They can also make detours {{to find the best}} attack angle against dangerous prey, even when the best detour takes a Portia out of visual contact with the prey, and sometimes the planned route leads to abseiling down a silk thread and biting the prey from behind. Such detours may take up to an hour, and a Portia usually picks the best route even if it needs to walk past an incorrect route. If a Portia makes a mistake while hunting another spider, it may itself be killed.|$|E

5|$|The single-player {{adventure}} {{begins by}} personalizing a player character. Each character has randomly generated values for their statistical character attributes: charisma, constitution, dexterity, intelligence, strength, and wisdom. While the algorithm stays the same, the player can randomize repeatedly for new character attribute distributions until satisfied. The player {{begins with a}} sword, armor, shield, and no money, and can only see his immediate surroundings, rather than the whole level. Monsters spawn randomly, and players have three options in battle: fight, use magic, or evade. Magic includes combative missiles, fireballs, lightning bolts, and turning the undead, as well as health regeneration and trap navigation. The effects of the game's most complex spells are not outlined in the instruction manual and must be learned <b>by</b> <b>trial</b> <b>and</b> <b>error.</b> Like the game, the battle events are carried out in real time instead of in turns. Enemies increase in difficulty as the player progresses through the dungeon. They include both living and undead monsters such as elves, dragons, mummies, and wraiths. Defeating enemies awards experience points, which accrete to raise the player's experience level and increase player stats. The player is rewarded with treasures that include magical weapons, armor items, and potions. Players can code their own features into the game.|$|E
5|$|Chulip is an adventure/simulation game {{in which}} the player must improve the hero's {{reputation}} {{in the community of}} Long Life Town by kissing its various citizens. The player's health is represented by a number of hearts. To gain more hearts the player has to find and kiss other characters in the game. Finding out how and when to kiss other characters is a puzzle in of itself. The game and each of its non-player characters (NPCs) follow a 24-hour day schedule. In the daytime, many of the NPCs of the game are walking around the streets. To succeed in kissing an NPC, the player is required to wait for the correct time where they will be happy and press the corresponding button. The player must sometimes complete a certain task for that NPC. Choosing the wrong time to kiss will often result in the player getting hit and losing health. Exploring Long Life Town presents the player with numerous environmental hazards discovered <b>by</b> <b>trial</b> <b>and</b> <b>error.</b> For instance, attempting to use the town's playground equipment or being suddenly shot at by the night-patrolling policeman will cause instant death. One mission ends in the player being struck by lightning, removing more than ten hearts and resulting in a game over if the player does not have sufficient health.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the game, {{the player}} must {{investigate}} the surroundings through finding and entering doors. These doors contain shops where players can buy equipment, rooms which provide additional information {{needed in the}} quest, traps which contain powerful enemies, and exits {{to the next level}} which can be opened after finding a key. Some of the doors in the game are hidden and can only be found through <b>by</b> <b>trial</b> <b>and</b> <b>error.</b> At the beginning of the game, shops are visible and are clearly marked with the appropriate signs. Later on in the game, as Wonder Boy gets closer to the MEKA Dragon, the shop doors become unmarked while others are traps set by the level's bosses; {{near the end of the}} game, many of the shops are invisible and contain more powerful weapons. There are four types of shops throughout the game: boot shops allow the player to buy boots which make Wonder Boy jump higher and run faster, armor shops contain armor which makes Wonder Boy incur less damage from enemy attacks, shield shops contain shields which allow him to repel fire from enemies, and magical shops allow players to purchase Magic Weapons. There are also various rooms in the game which the player can enter and receive additional assistance in the quest: taverns where players can buy drinks and receive information from the bartender, Fortune Teller rooms where players may receive information about future events, and hospitals which allow players to refill their life meter and Hourglass Timer for a small price. Other rooms contain a boss in which the player must defeat to get the key to the next level, to earn additional gold, or to upgrade to a more powerful sword.|$|E

This resulted in networks still simple at the architectural level but with a dynamics difficult to master. Instead, we propose a new neuronal model using uniform and classical neuronal dynamics, with a more complex architecture based on recent findings in neuroscience. Results reported in this paper confirm the good behavior of the model and justify the complex architecture by the greater robustness and flexibility of the model...|$|R

Moreover, such fusion systems are complex because they involve a complete information treatment chain (from the information extraction to the decision). The sub-parts of the system concern also different scientific areas which add some additional difficulties. Some parameters cannot be easily set empirically and their adjustments are made <b>by</b> <b>trials</b> <b>and</b> <b>errors.</b> This paper studies an optimization of a generalized Choquet Integral parameters by means of genetic algorithms.

40|$|International audienceMulti-criterion {{optimization}} {{is so far}} {{popular for}} many complex engineering problems. The objective of active anti-roll bar of heavy vehicles is to maximize roll stability to prevent rollover in dangerous cases.

In a previous work, the authors proposed an H∞ active anti-roll bar controller for which the weighting functions were chosen <b>by</b> <b>trials</b> <b>and</b> <b>errors</b> during the design step. In this paper, Genetic Algorithms (GAs) are proposed to find optimal weighting functions for the H∞ control synthesis. Such a general procedure is applied to the case of active anti-roll bar control in heavy vehicles. Thanks to GAs, the conflicting objectives between roll stability and torques generated are handled using one high level parameter only. The multi-criterion optimization solution is illustrated via the Pareto frontier. Simulations, performed in the frequency and time domains, emphasize the efficiency of the proposed method...|$|R

The band was also motivated by moral or ethical considerations: for example, Fugazi's members regarded pricey admission for rock concerts as tantamount to price gouging a performer's most loyal fans. Fugazi's inexpensive target goal of $5 admission was spawned during a conversation on an early tour when the band's members were debating the lowest profitable admission price.|$|E
25|$|The {{identification}} of suitable matrix compounds {{is determined to}} some extent <b>by</b> <b>trial</b> <b>and</b> <b>error,</b> but {{they are based on}} some specific molecular design considerations. They are of a fairly low molecular weight (to allow easy vaporization), but are large enough (with a low enough vapor pressure) not to evaporate during sample preparation or while standing in the mass spectrometer. They are often acidic, therefore act as a proton source to encourage ionization of the analyte. Basic matrices have also been reported. They have a strong optical absorption in either the UV or IR range, so that they rapidly and efficiently absorb the laser irradiation. This efficiency is commonly associated with chemical structures incorporating several conjugated double bonds, as seen in the structure of cinnamic acid. They are functionalized with polar groups, allowing their use in aqueous solutions. They typically contain a chromophore.|$|E

40|$|During {{the past}} decade, {{we have seen}} a rapid {{escalation}} in the amount and scope of computerized visual effects employed in feature films. This trend is in large due to the advances of computational techniques for doing physically based animation. Level sets, which are dynamic implicit surfaces developed for computational physics, are a prime example of such a technique, that has found use in computer graphics, computer vision and visual effects. Within computer graphics they have been used as the underlying surface representation in water simulations, geometric modeling, shape metamorphosis and several other applications. Among the most resource-demanding effects in today’s feature films is the simulation of smoke and water. As a result, level sets and their accompanying technology are constantly being pushed to the limits. Besides being computationally expensive, the unpredictable behavior of the simulations and lack of explicit artistic control result in a workflow marred <b>by</b> <b>trials</b> <b>and</b> <b>errors.</b> In the first segment of this dissertation, I propose an out-of-core framework for ef-ficient streaming of level set computations.
