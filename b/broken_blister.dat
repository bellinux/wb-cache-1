500|$|The inquest {{was unable}} to {{determine}} Cancellor's exact cause of death, but noted several inconsistencies in Hopley's explanation of events. He had failed to summon a doctor immediately and, upon questioning, had given outlandish excuses for his failure to do so. Hopley attempted to explain away {{the blood on the}} candlestick by attributing it to a <b>broken</b> <b>blister</b> on his hand, but did not offer an explanation for Cancellor's injuries. Hopley aroused further suspicion when he asked journalists present at the inquest not to include details of the corporal punishment in their stories, [...] "in order to spare the feelings of the deceased family as of my own". Cancellor's family was deeply affected by the case, as they had been [...] "disinclined" [...] to see Cancellor beaten; his father died shortly after the inquest of a [...] "broken heart".|$|E
40|$|Pemphigus vulgaris is an {{autoimmune}} disease with manifestations blister the skin or mucosal surfaces. This can occur because of {{damage caused by}} intercellular adhesion IgG autoantibodies, sometimes IgA and IgM especially against desmoglein 3, may also at desmoglein 1, causing the release of epithelial cells known as acantholysis. 56 year old man escorted by his wife with complaints blister wounds all over the body since 1 year ago. At the first time there was vesicles on the chest diameter(2 x 2 cm). Vesicle is very loose and easily broken. Having <b>broken</b> <b>blister</b> wounds arises. The blister wounds hurt so disturb the patient to sleep. On physical examination found a general state is unwell, compos mentis awareness, good nutrition, blood pressure 120 / 70 mmHg, pulse: 96 x / min regular, respiratory 17 times per minute, temperature 36, 3 ÂºC. In dermatological status was found abnormalities in the skin with a universal location, time of the inspection found Looks macular erythema, bullae, crusting, erosion {{in all parts of}} the body, generalized distribution, irregular shape, size numuler, demarcated, and uneven surfaces. In laboratory tests of blood glucose results obtained when 158, U + 23. 1 mg / dl, creatinine 0. 94 mg / dl, AST 24. 3 U / L, alanine aminotransferase 24 U / L. Diagnosis in patients with Pemphigus Vulgaris is. Therapy given to these patients is IVFD RL xx GTT / min (micro), dexametason 1 amp / 6 hours, cefotaxime 1 g / 12 hours, Gentamycin injection 80 mg / 12 hours, Ranitidine inj 1 amp / 12 hours, and topical mupirocin 2 x 1 cream 2 %. This patient experienced disease caused {{autoimmune disease}}, so patients need to undergo treatment that has been prescribed by doctors to improve the quality adversely and prevent further complications...|$|E
60|$|The buggy {{had pulled}} {{up close to}} a rough, <b>broken,</b> <b>blistered</b> cone of spelter stuff between ten and twenty feet high. There was trouble in that place--moaning, splashing, gurgling, and the clank of machinery. A spurt of boiling water jumped into the air, and a wash of water followed.|$|R
6000|$|Imagine mighty green fields splattered {{with lime}} beds: all the flowers {{of the summer}} growing up to {{the very edge of}} the lime. That was the first glimpse of the geyser basins. The buggy had pulled up close to a rough, <b>broken,</b> <b>blistered</b> cone of stuff between ten and twenty feet high. There was trouble in that place--moaning, splashing, gurgling, and the clank of machinery. A spurt of boiling water jumped into the air and a wash of water followed. I removed swiftly. The old lady from Chicago shrieked. [...] "What a wicked waste!" [...] said her husband. I think they call it the Riverside Geyser. Its spout was torn and ragged like the mouth of a gun when a shell has burst there. It grumbled madly for a moment or two and then was still. I crept over the {{steaming}} lime--it was the burning marl on which Satan lay--and looked fearfully down its mouth. You should never look a gift geyser in the mouth. I beheld a horrible slippery slimy funnel with water rising and falling ten feet at a time. Then the water rose to lip level with a rush and an infernal bubbling troubled this Devil's Bethesda before the sullen heave of the crest of a wave lapped over the edge and made me run. Mark the nature, of the human soul! I had begun with awe, not to say terror. I stepped back from the flanks of the Riverside Geyser saying: [...] "Pooh! Is that all it can do?" [...] Yet for aught I knew the whole thing might have blown up at a minute's notice; she, he, or it being an arrangement of uncertain temper.|$|R
40|$|Bullosis diabeticorum is an {{infrequent}} {{but significant}} complication of diabetes Mellitus most commonly affecting {{the hands and}} feet. These rapidly developing bullous lesions mostly occur in patients with long standing diabetes and neuropathy. The pathophysiology of this condition remains unknown. Despite reasonably low rates of occurrence this complication potentially has significant and serious ramifications for foot health and creates a treatment conundrum. This case study demonstrates the serious nature of seemingly innocuous presentations in management of the diabetic foot. A 76 -year-old man presents to the high-risk foot clinic for treatment of a suspected Charcot foot. He has a complex medical history, which includes Type 2 diabetes, hypertension, congestive cardiac failure, hypercholesterolemia, and Gastro-esophageal reflux disease. The patient undergoes various testing to aid in diagnosing a Charcot foot, such as skin temperature testing, X-ray and bone scans. Fortunately he was not diagnosed with a Charcot foot. During a routine follow-up consult he presents with clear, serous filled blisters which have spontaneously appeared. They are in non weight-bearing areas, and the patient does not recall any trauma to the area. The blisters appear consistent with bullosis diabeticorum. There are no set criteria for appropriate treatment of blistering in these cases. Treatment options were to either leave blisters intact or de-roof them, and their treatment raises many questions. Intact blisters were left intact to maintain a sterile field; <b>broken</b> <b>blisters</b> were de-roofed to prevent infection as per normal protocol for any form of blister management. The healing outcomes were compared, with no significant difference noted. However, after healing was achieved, the patient returned to the clinic, weeks later, with another episode of blistering. The patient recalled a similar history to the first episode, with no traumatic injury to the site, and the blisters occurring overnight. The same treatment protocol was followed. However, on this occasion, the blisters did not heal as successfully, and the patient developed osteomyelitis, and subsequently suffered multiple digital amputations as a result. This case demonstrates that successful wound care can be difficult on a patient with diabetes and associated complications, such as neuropathy, peripheral vascular disease, and an increased susceptibility to infection...|$|R
40|$|Traditional {{full length}} {{crutches}} have {{fallen out of}} favour with the medical profession and consumers as they routinely cause arm injuries (<b>blistering,</b> <b>broken</b> vessels in the veins and swelling) and can sometimes lead to a condition known as crutch paralysis, or crutch palsy, which arises from the pressure put on nerves in the armpit, or axilla. Many consumers use forearm crutches, but these have their own disadvantages in that the load on the body during their use is not evenly dispersed, resulting in huge strain being placed on the shoulder, neck and back. The purpose of this project was to research and design {{a viable alternative to}} traditional crutches based on the muscular system of a human leg. The crutch would incorporate a shock absorbing feature to reduce jarring and repetitive strain on the body of the user. An ergonomic crutch was designed, featuring a curved centre pole, as opposed to a straight central pole. The researcher is currently working towards the development of a prototype of the crutch made of carbon fibre, with the aim of taking it to a clinical trial at the WDHB...|$|R
