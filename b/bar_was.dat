5|$|From 1889 to 1960, {{the meter}} {{was defined as}} the length of a platinum-iridium (90:10) alloy bar, known as the International Prototype Meter bar.

5|$|An alloy of 90% {{platinum}} and 10% iridium {{was used}} in 1889 to construct the International Prototype Metre and kilogram mass, kept by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures near Paris.

5|$|During the 19th century, the Inns {{began to}} stagnate; little {{had been changed}} since the 17th century in terms of legal {{education}} or practice, except that students were no longer bound to take the Anglican sacrament before their call to the Bar. In 1852 the Council of Legal Education was established by the Inns, and in 1872 a formal examination for the call to the <b>Bar</b> <b>was</b> introduced. Gray's Inn itself suffered more than most; as in the 18th century, the fortunes of its members declined, and many barristers who had been called to the Bar at the Inn transferred to others.|$|E
5|$|During the {{remainder}} of World War II, <b>Bär</b> <b>was</b> credited with 130 other aerial victories, including 16 while flying {{one of the first}} jet fighters, the Me 262, an achievement which would normally have earned him the coveted Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds. Hermann Göring's personal dislike of Bär, coupled with Bär's insubordinate character and lack of military discipline, deprived him of this award. After World War II, Bär continued his career as an aviator. He was killed in a flying accident on 28 April 1957 near Braunschweig.|$|E
5|$|During {{the twentieth}} century the Doom <b>Bar</b> <b>was</b> {{regularly}} dredged to improve access to Padstow. By the 1930s, when Commander H.E.

By 2010 the original channel had disappeared. The estuary is regularly dredged by Padstow Harbour Commission's dredgers, Sandsnipe and Mannin.|$|E
