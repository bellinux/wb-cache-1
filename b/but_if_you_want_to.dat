500|$|After a year, {{the coach}} was so {{impressed}} with Nowitzki's progress that he advised him: [...] "You must now decide whether you want to play against {{the best in the world}} or just stay a local hero in Germany. If you choose the latter, we will stop training immediately, because nobody can prevent that anymore. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> play against the best, we have to train on a daily basis." [...] After pondering this lifetime decision for two days, Nowitzki agreed to enter the full-time training schedule, choosing the path to his eventual international career. Geschwindner let him train seven days a week with DJK Würzburg players and future German internationals Robert Garrett, Marvin Willoughby, and Demond Greene, and in the summer of 1994, then 16-year-old Nowitzki made the DJK squad.|$|E

500|$|During World War I, Prokofiev {{returned}} to the Conservatory and studied the [...] organ to avoid conscription. He composed The Gambler based on Fyodor Dostoyevsky's novel of the same name, but rehearsals were plagued by problems, and the scheduled 1917 première had to be cancelled because of the February Revolution. In the summer of that year, Prokofiev composed his first symphony, the Classical. It was his own name for the symphony, which {{was written in the}} style that, according to Prokofiev, Joseph Haydn would have used if he had been alive at the time. It is more or less Classical in style but incorporates more modern musical elements (see Neoclassicism). The symphony was also an exact contemporary of Prokofiev's Violin Concerto No. 1 in D major, Op. 19, which was scheduled to premiere in November 1917. The first performances of both works had to wait until 21 April 1918 and 18 October 1923, respectively. He stayed briefly with his mother in Kislovodsk in the Caucasus. After completing the score of Seven, They Are Seven, a [...] "Chaldean invocation" [...] for chorus and orchestra, Prokofiev was [...] "left with nothing to do and time hung heavily on my hands". Believing that Russia [...] "had no use for music at the moment", Prokofiev decided to try his fortunes in America until the turmoil in his homeland had passed. He set out for Moscow and Petersburg in March 1918 to sort out financial matters and to arrange for his passport. In May he headed for the US, having obtained official permission to do so from Anatoly Lunacharsky, the People's Commissar for Education, who told him: [...] "You are a revolutionary in music, we are revolutionaries in life. We ought to work together. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> go to America I shall not stand in your way." ...|$|E

2500|$|Hayden kept a {{considerably}} lower national profile than conventional wisdom would suggest {{for someone who}} spent {{more than half a}} century in Washington, including 42 years in the Senate. This came in part due to a conversation he had with Maryland Congressman Fred Talbott soon after he arrived in Washington in 1912. Talbott told him, [...] "Son, there are two kinds of Congressmen—show horses and work horses. If you want to get your name in the papers, be a show horse. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> gain the respect of your colleagues, don't do it. Be a work horse." ...|$|E

[...] She commented, [...] "If [...] are offended, they have the right to be offended – just like Christians." [...] With regard to keeping with the tenets of Freedom of Speech, Mimi is permitting a wide array of depictions of Muhammad [...] "except for those inciting violence or pornographic in nature." [...] "Mainstream society does whatever the Muslim society asks out of fear of violence or political correctness. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> live in a Western society and use the system to protect your rights, you have to be willing to allow others to have theirs as well," [...] said Mimi.|$|E
2500|$|Stevens {{had been}} with Charles Clasby's law firm for six months when Bob McNeally, a Democrat {{appointed}} as U.S. Attorney for Fairbanks during the Truman administration, informed U.S. District Judge Harry Pratt {{that he would be}} resigning effective August 15, 1953, having already delayed his resignation by several months at the request of Justice Department officials newly appointed by Eisenhower. The latter had asked McNeally to delay his resignation until Eisenhower could appoint a replacement. Despite Stevens's short tenure as an Alaska resident and his relative lack of trial or criminal law experience, Pratt asked Stevens to serve in the position until Eisenhower acted. Stevens agreed. [...] "I said, 'Sure, I'd like to do that,' [...] " [...] Stevens recalled years later. [...] "Clasby said, 'It's not going to pay you as much money, <b>but,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do it, that's your business.' He was very pissed that I decided to go." [...] Most members of the Fairbanks Bar Association were outraged at the appointment of a newcomer, and members in attendance at the association's meeting that December voted to support Carl Messenger for the permanent appointment, an endorsement seconded by the Alaska Republican Party Committee for the Fairbanks-area judicial division. However, Stevens was favored by Attorney General Herbert Brownell, by Senator William F. Knowland of California, and by the Republican National Committee, (Alaska itself had no Senators at this time, as it was still a territory). [...] Eisenhower sent Stevens's nomination to the U.S. Senate, which confirmed him on March 30, 1954.|$|E
