40|$|Binding time {{analysis}} {{has proved to}} be a valuable pre-analysis for partial evaluation. Until now (almost) all binding time analyses have been monovariant, such that <b>binding</b> time <b>analysis</b> could assign only one binding time description to each function definition.

CBSD provides an architectural way for self-adaptation, in which adaptation can be performed on the macro level of architecture and easier to control. However, the big gap between the problem space (business goal and environment) and the solution space (software architecture and components), and the runtime decision-making for adaptation are two difficulties for the implementation of business-oriented self-adaptation.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The authors' {{objective}} {{was to determine the}} origin of the diminished pressor responsiveness of angiotensin II infusion in hepatoma by evaluating angiotensin II receptor status in normal liver, hepatoma tumor, and cultured hepatocytes and H 4 IIE cells. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Hepatocellular cancer is a highly vascular tumor, where the neovasculature is unique in that it arises only from the hepatic arterial circulation, whereas normal liver has both hepatic arterial and portal venous blood supply. The tumor neovasculature is also characterized by an abnormal vascular reactivity to vasoconstrictors, including the response to angiotensin II. The altered response of tumor vasculature to angiotensin II offers a potential therapeutic opportunity for modulation of tumor blood flow. However, the origin of the decreased vascular response is unknown. METHODS: The authors evaluated the hepatic vascular response to angiotensin II infusion by determining hepatic arterial blood flow to normal liver and to tumor by means of radioactive microspheres. The angiotensin II receptor status in the normal liver, hepatoma tumor, and cultured hepatocytes and H 4 IIE cells was determined br radioligand <b>binding</b> <b>analysis</b> and in cryostat sections derived from normal liver and hepatoma tumor by means of in situ <b>binding</b> <b>analysis</b> with biotinylated angiotensin II. RESULTS: Angiotensin II infusion decreased the hepatic arterial flow to normal liver and increased hepatoma to liver flow ratio. The number of angiotensin II receptors in normal liver was significantly higher than that in hepatoma (239 +/- 20 fmol/mg protein in normal liver vs. 162 +/- 15 fmol/mg protein in hepatoma) without a change in the affinity (4. 4 +/- 0. 8 nM in normal liver vs. 4. 7 +/- 1. 2 nM in hepatoma). H 4 IIE cells and primary hepatocytes had low receptor density. In situ <b>binding</b> <b>analysis</b> revealed that angiotensin II receptors were mainly on the smooth muscle cells of the neovasculature. CONCLUSIONS: The data suggests that the diminished vascular response to angiotensin II hepatoma may relate a loss of angiotensin II receptor on tumor neovasculature...|$|E

In this article, we utilized purified anti-gp 273 immunoglobulins to characterize the corresponding epitope by: (i) immunoblotting analysis of the protein after removal of O- and N-glycans; (ii) solid phase <b>binding</b> <b>analysis</b> of anti-gp 273 IgG to gp 273 N- and O-glycans; and (iii) <b>binding</b> <b>analysis</b> of the same antibody to commercially available oligosaccharides.

Anti-gp 273 IgG were then used to investigate human zona pellucida by immunoelectronmicroscopy and immunoblotting. Epitopes recognized by the antibody were demonstrated on the outer surface of the zona pellucida and shown to belong to a zona pellucida protein having electrophoretic mobility similar to human ZP 3.

40|$|AbstractPart 1 of {{this paper}} is an {{analysis}} of problems concerning type systems and static semantics relevant to designing and implementing new programming languages. Part 2 proposes and exemplifies a way to derive a static semantics from a language's dynamic semantics, using a technique known as <b>binding</b> time <b>analysis</b> known from partial evaluation (Ershov's “mixed computation”) [20, 21]. The goal is to analyze the language's type structure during the design process without the need for hand construction of a type system. Ideally, one might automate the construction of a type checker, given only the dynamic semantics as input. In particular, <b>binding</b> time <b>analysis</b> of the interpreter program can be used to distinguish statically detectable errors from dynamic ones, and a static semantics is seen as a mechanism for deciding whether the program to be interpreted can give rise to any of the static errors.
