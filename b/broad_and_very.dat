500|$|The {{spotted hyena}} {{has a strong}} and well {{developed}} neck and forequarters, but relatively underdeveloped hindquarters. The rump is rounded rather than angular, which prevents attackers coming from behind from getting {{a firm grip on}} it. The head is wide and flat with a blunt muzzle and broad rhinarium. In contrast to the striped hyena, the ears of the spotted hyena are rounded rather than pointed. Each foot has four digits, which are webbed and armed with short, stout and blunt claws. The paw-pads are <b>broad</b> <b>and</b> <b>very</b> flat, with the whole undersurface of the foot around them being naked. The tail is relatively short, being [...] long, and resembles a pompom in appearance. Unusually among hyaenids, and mammals in general, the female spotted hyena is considerably larger than the male. Both sexes have a pair of anal glands which open into the rectum just inside the anal opening. These glands produce a white, creamy secretion which is pasted onto grass stalks by everting the rectum. The odour of this secretion is very strong, smelling of boiling cheap soap or burning, and can be detected by humans several metres downwind. The spotted hyena has a proportionately large heart, constituting close to 1% of its body weight, thus giving it great endurance in long chases. In contrast, a lion's heart makes up only 0.45–0.57 percent of its body weight. The now extinct Eurasian populations were distinguished from the modern African populations by their shorter distal extremities and longer humerus and femur.|$|E
60|$|Tom {{knew the}} spot well; the river {{there is very}} <b>broad,</b> <b>and</b> <b>very</b> shallow, flowing round low islands of gravel and turf. It was very low just now too, as it {{generally}} is in October: there could not be four inches of water where the black lump lay, but on the side nearest him the water was full knee deep.|$|E
60|$|From {{the lawn}} {{there was a}} very splendid view. There was a <b>broad</b> <b>and</b> <b>very</b> fertile slope of land {{extending}} for several miles down to the shore of the lake. Beyond it was seen the blue expanse of the water, and still farther another magnificent slope of fertile and richly-cultivated land, which extended back beyond the lake {{to the foot of the}} mountains. A lofty range of snow-clad summits rose in the distance, the towering summit of Mont Blanc reposing like a monarch in the midst of them.|$|E

2500|$|Macovei was {{involved}} in a number of controversies in Romania while Justice Minister, sometimes indirectly. [...] Media and groups in support of Macovei noted that domestic criticism against her by the local media and Romanian parliament increased markedly after Romania's accession to the EU when politicians no longer worried about implications in Brussels. [...] They also said such attacks stemmed from a <b>broader</b> <b>and</b> <b>very</b> public conflict between Prime Minister Popescu-Tăriceanu and President Traian Băsescu, which divided the ruling coalition and contributed to the break-up of the [...] "Justice and Truth Alliance." [...] Macovei consistently stated that the attacks lodged against her by politicians were [...] "proof that reform was on the right track" [...] under her leadership.|$|R
50|$|A prospekt (проспе́кт) is a <b>broad,</b> multi-lane <b>and</b> <b>very</b> long {{straight}} {{street in}} urban areas. The term {{originated in the}} Russian Empire. It is often translated as avenue; however, {{it can also be}} interpreted as parkway since it is common that a prospekt is the main city route (Arterial road).|$|R
60|$|The sun {{sank into}} grey clouds, the sky flushed and darkened, the evening star trembled into sight. It was deep {{twilight}} when the captain cried out and pointed. My brother strained his eyes. Something rushed {{up into the}} sky out of the greyness--rushed slantingly upward and very swiftly into the luminous clearness above the clouds in the western sky; something flat and <b>broad,</b> <b>and</b> <b>very</b> large, that swept round in a vast curve, grew smaller, sank slowly, and vanished again into the grey mystery of the night. And as it flew it rained down darkness upon the land.|$|E
60|$|Thus {{they talked}} in great amity of many things, {{and so they}} {{travelled}} for all that day {{and the next day}} and for a part of the day after that. And somewhat early in the morning of the third day they came to the summit of a certain highland whence Sir Gareth beheld a great plain, well tilled and very fertile, spread out beneath that high place where he stood. And he beheld that the plain was very <b>broad</b> <b>and</b> <b>very</b> long and that in the midst thereof there was a hill and that upon the hill there stood a castle and that behind the castle was a town of many fair and well-built houses.|$|E
60|$|The {{two gentlemen}} agreed {{to walk up}} the {{mountain}} together, and with some trouble induced the conductor to permit them to do so. Why conductors of diligences should object to such relief to their horses the ordinary Englishman can hardly understand. But in truth they feel so deeply the responsibility which attaches itself to their shepherding of their sheep, that they are always fearing lest some poor lamb should go astray on the mountain side. And though the road be <b>broad</b> <b>and</b> <b>very</b> plainly marked, the conductor never feels secure that his passenger will find his way safely to the summit. He likes to know that each of his flock is in his right place, and disapproves altogether of an erratic spirit. But Mr. Glascock at last prevailed, {{and the two men}} started together up the mountain. When the permission has been once obtained the walker may be sure that his guide and shepherd will not desert him.|$|E

60|$|Thorgunna {{worked at}} cloth-making {{every day when}} there was no hay- making, but when the weather was dry she worked among the dry hay in the home field, and had a rake made for herself which she alone was to use. Thorgunna was a big woman, both <b>broad</b> <b>and</b> tall, <b>and</b> <b>very</b> stout; she had dark eyebrows, and her eyes were close set; her hair brown and in great abundance. She was well-mannered in her daily life, and went to church every day before {{beginning}} her work, but she was not of a light disposition nor of many words. Most people thought that Thorgunna must be in the sixties, yet she was a very active woman.|$|R
50|$|The genus Platydemus is {{characterized}} by a massive, slightly convex body with a <b>broad</b> creeping sole <b>and</b> <b>very</b> large eyes. The copulatory apparatus has a large chamber with folded epithelium in the male atrium, usually with a small penis.|$|R
60|$|What {{a man he}} was, {{if indeed}} he could be called quite human. His stature, though stout, was only that of a child; his head was enormous, and from it plaited white hair fell down on to his shoulders. His eyes were deep and sunken, his face was <b>broad</b> <b>and</b> <b>very</b> stern. Except for this snow-white hair, however, {{he did not look}} ancient, for his flesh was firm and plump, and the skin on his cheeks and neck unwrinkled, which {{suggested}} to me that the story of his great antiquity was false. A man who was over a hundred years old, for instance, surely could not boast such a beautiful set of teeth, for even at that distance I could see them gleaming. On the other hand, evidently middle age was far behind him; indeed, from his appearance it was quite impossible to guess even approximately the number of his years. There he sat, red in the red light, perfectly still, and staring without a blink of his eyes at the furious ball of the setting sun, as an eagle is said to be able to do.|$|E
60|$|Gatherum Castle would {{probably}} be called Italian in its style of architecture; though it may, I think, be doubted whether any such edifice, or anything like it, was ever seen {{in any part of}} Italy. It was a vast edifice; irregular in height--or it appeared to be so--having long wings on each side too high to be passed over by the eye as mere adjuncts to the mansion, and a portico so large as to make the house behind it look like another building of a greater altitude. This portico was supported by Ionic columns, and was in itself doubtless a beautiful structure. It was approached by a flight of steps, very <b>broad</b> <b>and</b> <b>very</b> grand; but, as an approach by a flight of steps hardly suits an Englishman's house, to the immediate entrance of which it is necessary that his carriage should drive, there was another front door in one of the wings which was commonly used. A carriage, however, could on very stupendously grand occasions--the visits, for instance, of queens and kings, and royal dukes--be brought up under the portico; as the steps had been so constructed as to admit of a road, with a rather stiff ascent, being made close in front of the wing up into the very porch.|$|E
60|$|Mr Clinton {{went back}} to the office; it was his boast that for ten years he had never missed a day. But he was dazed; he did his work mechanically, and so distracted was he that, on going home in the evening, he forgot to remove his paper cuffs, and his wife remarked upon them while they were supping. Mrs Clinton was a short, stout person, with an {{appearance}} of immense determination; her black, shiny hair was parted in the middle--the parting was <b>broad</b> <b>and</b> <b>very</b> white--severely brushed back and gathered into a little knot {{at the back of the}} head; her face was red and strongly lined, her eyes spirited, her nose aggressive, her mouth resolute. Everyone has some one procedure which seems most exactly to suit him--a slim youth bathing in a shaded stream, an alderman standing with his back to the fire and his thumbs in the arm-holes of his waistcoat--and Mrs Clinton expressed her complete self, exhibiting every trait and attribute, on Sunday in church, when she sat in the front pew self-reliantly singing the hymns in the wrong key. It was then that she seemed more than ever the personification of a full stop. Her morals were above suspicion, and her religion Low Church.|$|E

40|$|Fundamental {{investigations}} in ultrasonics in India {{date back to}} the early 20 th century. But, fundamental and applied research in the field of nondestructive evaluation (NDE) came much later. In the last four decades it has grown steadily in academic institutions, national laboratories and industry. Currently, commensurate with rapid industrial growth and realisation of the benefits of NDE, the activity is becoming much stronger, deeper, <b>broader</b> <b>and</b> <b>very</b> wide spread. Acoustic Emission (AE) is a recent entry into the field of nondestructive evaluation. Pioneering efforts in India in AE were carried out at the Indian Institute of Science in the early 1970 s. The nuclear industry was the first to utilise it. Current activity in AE in the country spans materials research, incipient failure detection, integrity evaluation of structures, fracture mechanics studies and rock mechanics. In this paper, we attempt to project the current scenario in ultrasonics and acoustic emission research in India...|$|R

60|$|Finding the coast-road {{devoid of}} {{interest}} of any kind, we turned inland towards the mining district and valley of Illapel. This valley, {{like every other}} in Chile, is level, <b>broad,</b> <b>and</b> <b>very</b> fertile: it is bordered on each side, either by cliffs of stratified shingle, or by bare rocky mountains. Above the straight line of the uppermost irrigating ditch, all is brown as on a high-road; while all below is of as bright a green as verdigris, from the beds of alfarfa, a kind of clover. We proceeded to Los Hornos, another mining district, where the principal hill was drilled with holes, like a great ants'-nest. The Chilian miners are a peculiar race of men in their habits. Living for weeks together in the most desolate spots, when they descend to the villages on feast-days there is no excess of extravagance into which they do not run. They sometimes gain a considerable sum, and then, like sailors with prize-money, they try how soon they can contrive to squander it. They drink excessively, buy quantities of clothes, {{and in a few}} days return penniless to their miserable abodes, there to work harder than beasts of burden. This thoughtlessness, as with sailors, is evidently the result of a similar manner of life. Their daily food is found them, and they acquire no habits of carefulness; moreover, temptation and the means of yielding to it are placed in their power at the same time. On the other hand, in Cornwall, and some other parts of England, where the system of selling part of the vein is followed, the miners, from being obliged to act and think for themselves, are a singularly intelligent and well-conducted set of men.|$|E
