40|$|The minimal {{model of}} spontaneously <b>broken</b> leptonic <b>colour</b> and {{discrete}} quark-lepton symmetry predicts that charged leptons {{have the same}} masses as their partner charge $+ 2 / 3 $ quarks up to small radiative corrections. By invoking a different pattern of symmetry breaking, a similar model can be constructed with the structural feature that charged leptons have to be lighter than their partner quarks because of mixing between leptonic colours, provided mixing between generations is not too strong.

Just then, too, Nasta's fierce and almost invincible highlanders, either because they were disheartened by their losses or {{by way of a}} ruse, fell back, and the remains of Good's gallant squares, leaving the {{positions}} they had held for so many hours, cheered wildly, and rashly followed them down the slope, whereon the swarms of swordsmen turned to envelop them, and once more flung themselves upon them with a yell. Taken thus on every side, what remained of the first square was quickly destroyed, and I perceived that the second, in which I could see Good himself mounted on a large horse, was on the point of annihilation. A few more minutes and it was <b>broken,</b> its streaming <b>colours</b> sank, and I lost sight of Good in the confused and hideous slaughter that ensued.|$|R

50|$|In Marat's time, Newton's {{views on}} light and colour were {{regarded}} almost universally as definitive, yet Marat's explicit purpose {{in his second}} major work Découvertes sur la Lumière (Discoveries on Light) was to demonstrate that in certain key areas, Newton was wrong. The focus of Marat's work was the study of how light bends around objects, and his main argument was that while Newton held that white light was <b>broken</b> down into <b>colours</b> by refraction, the colours were actually caused by diffraction. When a beam of sunlight shone through an aperture, passed through a prism and projected colour onto a wall, the splitting of the light into colours took place not in the prism, as Newton maintained, but {{at the edges of}} the aperture itself. Marat also sought to demonstrate that there are only three primary colours, rather than seven as Newton had argued.|$|R

Calculations already carried out to 1 -loop order is shown to give with only 3 adjustable parameters the following quantities all to within present experimental error: all 9 CKM matrix elements |V_rs| for quarks, the neutrino oscillation angles or the MNS lepton mixing matrix elements |U_μ 3 |, |U_e 3 |, and the mass ratios m_c/m_t, m_s/m_b, m_μ/m_τ. The special feature of this model crucial for deriving the above results is a fermion mass matrix which changes its orientation (rotates) in generation space with changing energy scale, a feature which is shown to have direct empirical support.

60|$|It {{was in the}} roomy dining-room of the Hotel Metropole at Brighton. Maude and Frank {{were seated}} at the {{favourite}} small round table near the window, where they always lunched. Their immediate view was a snowy-white tablecloth with a shining centre dish of foppish little cutlets, each with a wisp of ornamental paper, and a surrounding bank of mashed potatoes. Beyond, from the very base of the window, as it seemed, there stretched the huge expanse of the deep blue sea, its soothing mass of <b>colour</b> <b>broken</b> only by a few white leaning sails upon the furthest horizon. Along the sky-line the white clouds lay in carelessly piled cumuli, like snow thrown up from a clearing. It was restful and beautiful, that distant view, but just at the moment it was the near one which interested them most. Though they lose from this moment onwards the sympathy of every sentimental reader, the truth must be told that they were thoroughly enjoying their lunch.|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} how focus-on-forms instruction in second language teaching affects attention to forms in two different types of task: constrained and free production. These two different types of task were administered to 87 university students enrolled in a first-year French as a second language course before and after instruction on qualifying adjective agreement. Comparisons were made between learning-gain differences from pre- to post-tests for both tasks. Significant differences between pre- and post-test scores were found for both tasks. Although the difference between the two tasks was not significant, the learning-gain difference was somewhat higher for the constrained-production task than for the free-production task. When the total number of adjectives used in the compositions was <b>broken</b> down into <b>colour</b> adjectives and non-colour adjectives, no significant learning gains were observed between the two categories, although the learning gains for the non-colour adjectives was twice as high as for the colour adjectives. Possible explanations for these results are discussed...|$|R
40|$|In a Pinus halepensis Mill. forest, a field {{experiment}} {{was designed to}} evaluate post-fire seed predation as affected by combinations of seed colour and soil substrates: light grey and black seeds combined with light grey ash, dark grey ash and pale brown sand. A survey of bird species inhabiting the area was also carried out and polyphenolic content of seed coat was assessed in seed lots of different colour. Light grey seeds were observed to be less predated on light grey ash, suggesting eucrypsis as a protective strategy against bird predation. On the contrary, no clear pattern was observed for the predation of black seeds on different substrates. In the study area both bird species breaking the seed coat and eating the endosperm and bird species swallowing the whole seed were monitored. We have estimated that more seeds were swallowed than <b>broken,</b> in all <b>colour</b> categories. Light grey seeds, which {{were found to have}} a higher content of polyphenols, were predated more than black seeds when exposed on the same substrate. Thus, no evidence was produced that the amount of polyphenols in seed coat could protect seeds from predatio...|$|R
50|$|The Mudhol or Caravan hound has {{well-defined}} characteristics. The head is {{long and}} narrow, broad between the ears with a tapering muzzle. The jaws are long and powerful, with a scissors bite. The nose is large and black. The ears are pendulous and hang close to the skull. The eyes are large and oval in shape, from dark to hazel. The expression is a piercing gaze. The neck is long, clean, and muscular, and fits well into the shoulders. The forelegs are long and straight. The back is long, broad and well-muscled. The loins are wide and deep. The chest is strong and deep with well sprung ribs. The abdomen is tucked in. The hind quarters appear wide and well-muscled. The tail is set on low, strong at the base and tapering, quite long and carried in a natural curve. The gait is high-footed, flexing all four legs, but should not be hackneyed. There are two coat varieties - one with an entirely smooth coat {{and the other with}} silky featherings on the ears, legs, and tail. Acceptable colours are fawn, fallow, red, cream, black, and mouse-grey, or any of these <b>colours</b> <b>broken</b> with a minimal amount of white.|$|R
40|$|Camouflage is {{the primary}} defence of many animals and {{includes}} multiple strategies that interfere with figure-ground segmentation and object recognition. While matching background colours and textures is widespread and conceptually straightforward, less well explored are the optical ‘tricks’, collectively called disruptive colouration, that exploit perceptual grouping mechanisms. Adjacent high contrast colours create false edges, {{but this is not}} sufficient for an object’s shape to be <b>broken</b> up; some <b>colours</b> must blend with the background. We test the novel hypothesis that this will be particularly effective when the colour patches on the animal appear to belong to, not merely different background colours, but different background objects. We used computer-based experiments where human participants had to find cryptic targets on artificial backgrounds. Creating what appeared to be bi-coloured foreground objects on bi-coloured backgrounds, we generated colour boundaries that had identical local contrast but either lay within or between (illusory) objects. As predicted, error rates for targets matching what appeared to be different background objects were higher than for targets which had otherwise identical local contrast to the background but appeared to belong to single background objects. This provides evidence for disruptive colouration interfering with higher-level feature integration in addition to previously demonstrated low-level effects involving contour detection. In addition, detection was impeded in treatments where targets were on or in close proximity to multiple background colour or tone boundaries. This is consistent with other studie...|$|R
40|$|Gegenstand der vorliegenden klinischen Studie war es zu untersuchen, ob sich ein neueingeführtes temporäres Kronen- und Brückenmaterial von einem etablierten Werkstoff in Bezug auf Verarbeitbarkeit, Oberflächenbeschaffenheit, Interaktion mit dem Weichgewebe, Farbgebung/ Farbstabilität und Integrität (Haltbarkeit) unterschied. Im Rahmen der Untersuchung erhielten 80 Patienten insgesamt 250 temporäre Restaurationen (126 Luxatemp, 124 Protemp). Zu jeder temporären Versorgung wurde ein Protokoll geführt. Die erhobenen Daten wurden zur Analyse non-parametrischen Testverfahren unterzogen, zur multifaktoriellen Prüfung von Einflussfaktoren auf bestimmte Parameter kamen Regressionsmodelle zum Einsatz (logistische Regression, Cox-Regression). Die unifaktorielle statistische Auswertung der Ereigniszeiten erfolgte mit Hilfe der Kaplan-Meier-Methode. Für alle Tests wurde das Signifikanzniveau mit p < 0, 05 festgelegt. Hinsichtlich der Verarbeitbarkeit, Oberflächenbeschaffenheit, Interaktion mit dem Weichgewebe und Farbe unterschieden sich die Materialien in Bezug auf manche der untersuchten Eigenschaften. Die Haltbarkeit der Werkstoffe unterschied sich nicht. Die größte Schwäche beider Materialien liegt nach wie vor in der mechanischen Stabilität. Beide Materialien sind zur Kurzzeitanwendung gleichermaßen geeignet. Ist eine längere Tragedauer der Interimsversorgung vorgesehen, sollte auf weniger frakturgefährdete Konstruktionen (z. B. kunststoffverblendetes Nicht-Edelmetall-Gerüst) zurückgegriffen werden. The aim of {{this study}} was the {{clinical}} comparison of a recently introduced temporary crown and bridge material to a well-established one. Therefore processability, surface-quality, soft-tissue interaction, colouring/ colour-stability and integrity were checked. 80 patients received a total of 250 temporary restorations (126 Luxatemp, 124 Protemp). Following the assessment of baseline parameters concerning patient and restoration (colour in comparison to adjacent tooth, surface) processability of the materials was evaluated. Each restoration was monitored during the whole utilization time, fractures or losses of the appliances were registered. Upon final removal temporary crowns and bridges were checked for condition (unimpaired, <b>broken</b> or lost), <b>colour</b> and plaque-adherence. Patients soft tissue reaction (probing depth/ bleeding on probing) and opinion regarding acessability to measures of oral hygiene, surface-quality, colouring and discolourations were recorded. All data sets were subjected to nonparametrical test procedures, influence on certain parameters was assessed with different regression-models (logistic regression, Cox-regression). Survival was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier-method. For all statistical procedures the level of significance was set at p < 0. 05. The materials showed differences in some of the characteristics evaluated regarding processability, surface-quality, soft-tissue interaction and colour. Integrity of the materials was comparable. Mechanical stability still remains the main problem for both materials. Both materials can equally be recommended for short-term-use. If long-term interim treatment is planned, less fracture-prone therapeutic options (e. g. resin materials supported by metal frameworks) should be chosen...|$|R
60|$|It {{was a fine}} {{sight to}} see the boats depart for the north. It was a thrilling, heart-stirring sight to behold these picturesque, {{athletic}} men, on receiving the word of command from their guides, spring lightly into the long, heavy boats; to see them let the oars fall into {{the water with a}} loud splash, and then, taking their seats, give way with a will, knowing that the eyes of friends and sweethearts and rivals were bent earnestly upon them. It was a splendid sight to see boat after boat shoot out from the landing-place, and cut through the calm bosom of the river, as the men bent their sturdy backs, until the thick oars creaked and groaned on the gunwales and flashed in the stream, more and more vigorously at each successive stroke, until their friends on the bank, who were anxious to see the last of them, had to run faster and faster in order to keep up with them, as the rowers warmed at their work, and made the water gurgle at the bows--their bright blue and scarlet and white trappings reflected in the dark waters in <b>broken</b> masses of <b>colour,</b> streaked with long lines of shining ripples, as if they floated on a lake of liquid rainbows. And it was a glorious thing to hear the wild, plaintive song, led by one clear, sonorous voice, that rang out full and strong in the still air, while at the close of every two lines the whole brigade burst into a loud, enthusiastic chorus, that rolled far and wide over the smooth waters--telling of their approach to settlers beyond the reach of vision in advance, and floating faintly back, a last farewell, to the listening ears of fathers, mothers, wives, and sisters left behind. And it was interesting to observe how, as the rushing boats sped onwards past the cottages on shore, groups of men and women and children stood before the open doors and waved adieu, while ever and anon a solitary voice rang louder than the others in the chorus, and a pair of dark eyes grew brighter as a voyageur swept past his home, and recognised his little ones screaming farewell, and seeking to attract their sire's attention by tossing their chubby arms or flourishing round their heads the bright vermilion blades of canoe paddles. It was interesting, too, to hear the men shout as they ran a small rapid which occurs about {{the lower part of the}} settlement, and dashed in full career up to the Lower Fort--which stands about twenty miles down the river from Fort Garry--and then sped onward again with unabated energy, until they passed the Indian settlement, with its scattered wooden buildings and its small church; passed the last cottage on the bank; passed the low swampy land at the river's mouth; and emerged at last, as evening closed, upon the wide, calm, sea-like bosom of Lake Winnipeg.|$|R
