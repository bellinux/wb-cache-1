It has highlighted major weaknesses of the local economy, which were reflected by large structural budget deficits (over 5 % of GDP during 2006 - 2008) and external imbalances by two digits (remember that structural imbalance is obscured by an economic growth above potential, which brings only temporary additional <b>budgetary</b> <b>receipts).</b> European budget, resources, member states, European Commission...|$|R

It is said that, in principle, integration provides for reduction or abolition of customs duties, thereby, leading to a drop in government revenue. In spite of all that, integration has been sought after by all the countries since their attainment of independence. the main objective which is analysis of the impact of integration on the fiscal contribution capacity of African countries, we want more specifically: to identify the determining factors of the fiscal contribution; to study the nature and intensify of the effects of these variables on the share of government receipts according t the level of development of the country; to appraise the influence of integration policies on the level of fiscal contribution capacity; to analyze the impact of the number of organizations of which a country is a member on its fiscal contribution capacity.

40|$|With {{slow growth}} and high {{inequality}} Mexico needs investments in infrastructure, {{education and social}} policies. Mexico has increased spending {{in all of these}} areas. This was easily financed thanks to fiscal reforms in 2007 and 2009 as well as high oil prices in recent years. Oil revenues, which account for around one third of <b>budgetary</b> <b>receipts,</b> are highly volatile, especially due to price movements, and the prospects for production are uncertain, even though less so than in previous years. Mexico has the lowest tax revenues as a share of GDP in the OECD and much of Latin America, even when oil-related revenues are included. The government should improve the efficiency of its public spending. Mexico spends significant sums on energy subsidies, which are in large part captured by higher-income groups. Moreover, these subsidies are not in line with Mexico’s ambitious goals to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. These subsidies should be gradually withdrawn in line with the government’s goals. Extending cash benefits to the poor instead would be much more efficient to fight poverty and help citizens and {{the economy as a whole}} to buffer income shocks. Agricultural spending should be re-structured to finance more investment in public goods and less support for producers, which has proven ineffective in increasing agricultural productivity. Broadening the tax base by withdrawing some of the most distortive tax expenditures would make an important contribution to strengthen revenues. This would also help make the tax system simpler, thus reducing compliance costs as well as opportunities for tax avoidance and evasion. Efforts to enhance tax enforcement should continue.

In recent years, FHA has experienced {{a dramatic increase in}} its market role due to the contraction of other mortgage market segments. FHA insures almost all of its single-family mortgages under its Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund (Fund), which is reviewed from both an actuarial and budgetary perspective each year. On the basis of an independent actuarial review, FHA reported in November 2009 that the Fund was not meeting statutory capital reserve requirements as of the end of fiscal year 2009, as measured by the Fund's estimated capital ratio (i. e., economic value divided by the unamortized insurance-in-force). Additionally, although the Fund historically has produced <b>budgetary</b> <b>receipts</b> for the federal government, a weakening in the performance of FHA-insured loans has heightened the possibility that FHA will require additional funds to help cover its costs on insurance issued to date. In light of FHA's changing market role and financial condition, Congress asked us to examine (1) how estimates of the Fund's capital ratio have changed since 2001, the primary factors contributing to recent changes, and the budgetary implications of changes in the Fund's financial performance; (2) how FHA and its actuarial review contractor evaluate the financial condition of the Fund, including the Fund's performance under different economic scenarios; (3) the steps FHA has taken to improve the financial condition of the Fund, and how it has interpreted statutory requirements pertaining to the Fund; and (4) the performance of FHA's mortgage portfolio from 2005 through 2009, {{and the extent to which}} key characteristics of FHA-insured mortgages have changed in recent years. ...|$|R

40|$|Changes in {{parameters}} of tax and transfer programs can induce individuals {{to alter their}} behaviour {{in a wide variety}} of ways, including changes in labour supply, in the nature of employee compensation, in the choice of working in the underground economy, in savings decisions, in human capital investments and in fertility decisions. The magnitude of these responses is of critical importance in the formulation of adequate tax and transfer policies. Thus the behavioural effects of income taxes and those implicit in means-tested transfer programs may strongly influence the impact of these policies on income, tax <b>receipts,</b> <b>budgetary</b> costs and welfare. In this paper, we abide with the tradition of evaluating the impact of tax and transfer programs on labour supply at both the extensive (the decision to work or not) and the intensive margins (the number of hours worked). We provide both a theoretical and empirical survey of the labour supply impact of tax and transfer programs. An important part of the empirical results discussed in this paper focuses on the labour supply impact of tax and transfer reforms that occurred in the US, in the UK and in Canada. ...|$|R

5000|$|The {{economy of}} Syria {{is based on}} agriculture, oil, {{industry}} and services. Its GDP per capita expanded 80% in the 1960s reaching a peak of 336% of total growth during the 1970s. [...] This proved unsustainable for Syria and the economy shrank by 33% during the 1980s. However the GDP per capita registered a very modest total growth of 12% (1.1% per year on average) during the 1990s due to successful diversification. More recently, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) projected real GDP growth at 3.9% in 2009 from close to 6% in 2008. The two main pillars of the Syrian economy used to be agriculture and oil, which together accounted for about one-half of GDP. Agriculture, for instance, accounted for about 25% of GDP and employed 25% of the total labor force. However, poor climatic conditions and severe drought badly affected the agricultural sector, thus reducing its share in the economy to about 17% of 2008 GDP, down from 20.4% in 2007, according to preliminary data from the Central Bureau of Statistics. On the other hand, higher crude oil prices countered declining oil production and led to higher <b>budgetary</b> and export <b>receipts.</b>|$|R
