40|$|Motivation. Natural and {{synthetic}} <b>benzophenones</b> are compounds of great scientific and applied interest {{due to the}} varied biological and physicochemical properties that they posses. As part of a program aimed at investigating new physicochemical properties of substituted <b>benzophenones,</b> we carry out {{a study on the}} influence of the substituents and solvents upon the molecular conformations of these compounds. In the future, we expect to propose relationships between the molecular structural parameters with diverse experimental properties of the compounds that are currently being determined in our laboratory. Method. Basis sets at the HF/ 6 - 31 G(d) and B 3 LYP/ 6 - 31 G(d) levels of theory were used for calculations. Onsager's and Tomasi’s methods were used to analyze the solvent effects on the nine <b>benzophenones</b> studied. Results. A conformational equilibrium was proposed between the two conformers of <b>benzophenones</b> with the greatest thermodynamic stability. The total energies, torsional angles, dipole moments, structural and reactivity molecular parameters, and conformational equilibrium constants were calculated in vacuum, ethanol, methanol and water.

500|$|Metallic sodium is used {{mainly for}} the {{production}} of sodium borohydride, sodium azide, indigo, and triphenylphosphine. A once-common use was the making of tetraethyllead and titanium metal; because of the move away from TEL and new titanium production methods, the production of sodium declined after 1970. Sodium is also used as an alloying metal, an anti-scaling agent, and as a reducing agent for metals when other materials are ineffective. [...] Note the free element is not used as a scaling agent, ions in the water are exchanged for sodium ions. Sodium plasma ("vapor") lamps are often used for street lighting in cities, shedding light that ranges from yellow-orange to peach as the pressure increases. By itself or with potassium, sodium is a desiccant; it gives an intense blue coloration with <b>benzophenone</b> when the desiccate is dry. In organic synthesis, sodium is used in various reactions such as the Birch reduction, and the sodium fusion test is conducted to qualitatively analyse compounds. Sodium reacts with alcohol and gives alkoxides, and when sodium is dissolved in ammonia solution, {{it can be used to}} reduce alkynes to trans-alkenes. Lasers emitting light at the sodium D line are used to create artificial laser guide stars that assist in the adaptive optics for land-based visible light telescopes.|$|E

The Baeyer and Villiger intermediate leads to a 1:1 distribution of both of the above products.

40|$|AbstractRelationships between {{chemical}} mass {{shifts and}} physiochemical properties of ions are sought by examining substituted acetophenones, <b>benzophenones,</b> and pyridines in a modified ion trap mass spectrometer. Systematic changes in chemical mass shift occur {{with changes in}} substituent in the acetophenones and the <b>benzophenones.</b> Brown’s σ+ constant, which {{is a measure of}} electronic effects of substituents in reactions that involve positive charge development, is shown to correlate linearly with chemical mass shifts in para-substituted acetophenones and <b>benzophenones.</b> Brown’s σ+ constant also correlates with the ease of dissociation of the ions via a correlation with ionization energy. It is suggested that ease of dissociation is the underlying factor in determining chemical mass shifts. The experimental results also suggest that dissociative collisions between ions and buffer gas make a much greater contribution to chemical mass shifts than do elastic collisions...|$|R
