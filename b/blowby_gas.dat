40|$|The {{interactions}} between hydrazine and blowby gases from pyrovalves was explored {{in this research}} project. Investigating the decomposition chemistry of hydrazine through detailed chemical kinetic modeling is a project started last summer while participating in the Summer Faculty Fellowship program. During the 1999 - 2000 academic year, the chemical kinetic mechanism for hydrazine decomposition developed while a SFF at NASA's White Sands Test Facility was further revised and validated against the limited experimental data in the literature. This mechanism was then used in assessing the effects of <b>blowby</b> <b>gas</b> species on hydrazine decomposition. The combustion products introduced into the fuel line by pyrovalve actuation consist primarily of hydrogen gas. Hydrogen is also {{a product of the}} decomposition of hydrazine. Additional gaseous chemical species are introduced into the fuel, as well as metals and metal salts that deposit onto the walls of the fuel line. The deposition process is undoubtedly very rapid, and exothermic. Therefore, the major focus of this summer's work was examining the effects of hydrogen presence on hydrazine decomposition, with some representative calculations including the remaining gaseous species found to exist in blowby gases. Since hydrogen is a product of hydrazine decomposition, all reactions necessary to evaluate its effect on hydrazine decomposition chemistry were in the original mechanism developed. However, the mechanism needed to be considerably expanded to include the reactions of the other gaseous blowby species with hydrazine, all the intermediate species formed in its decomposition, and each other. The expanded mechanism consists of 70 species interacting via a network of 452 reactions. Calculations with molecular hydrogen introduced into hydrazine gas in an inert bath gas indicate that H 2 presence as an initial reactant in substantial amounts can dramatically impact the decomposition process for hydrazine. The other gaseous blowby species (CO, CO 2, H 2 O, CH 4, O 2, and N 2) were found to have little effect compared to the inclusion of hydrogen itself as an initial reagent. This result is undoubtedly due, in part, {{to the fact that the}} <b>blowby</b> <b>gas</b> used in these calculations consisted of 94. 6 % H 2. A more rigorous examination of the behavior of the full detailed mechanism under a variety of conditions was not performed...|$|E
40|$|In {{piston ring}} pack design, {{there is a}} {{tradeoff}} between reducing friction and increasing oil consumption. While friction reduces engine efficiency, oil consumption can poison exhaust aftertreatment systems. The primary method in studying the balance between friction and oil consumption is by understanding and modeling oil transport. This study used Two-Dimensional Laser Induced Fluorescence (2 D LIF) on a one-cylinder spark ignition research engine to view real-time oil transport in the power cylinder. The Lower Region, comprised of the 3 ' Land, skirt chamfer, the oil control ring (OCR), and the OCR groove, {{was the focus of}} this study for a number of real-world engine operating conditions. Previous studies noted that the interaction between oil and <b>blowby</b> <b>gas</b> flow is complex and important. What this research study attempted was a characterization and decoupling of the mechanisms governing oil transport {{into and out of the}} groove. This was accomplished by testing multiple piston ring pack configurations, thereby analyzing the effects of OCR and groove design. Namely a piston with no drain holes, a "Multi-Enlarged Hole" piston, and a baseline/production piston were used in conjunction with a U-Flex and Two-Piece OCR. In carrying out this analysis, a gross scaling relationship was created, utilizing the obtained LIF videos as a connection between the scaling model and the experiments' results. Mechanisms were classified into three types of oil transport: supply, release, and leakage. The primary mechanism of oil supply to the groove occurred during the intake stroke due to OCR downscraping. Oil's release from the groove was via the drain holes due to viscous shearing by blowby gases during the expansion stroke. It was found necessary that the releasing mechanism properly utilize the gas flow as well as the drainage area. Oil leakage out the groove was shown to be caused by inertia forcing oil out through the OCR gap during the intake, compression, and exhaust strokes. It was revealed that this leakage supplied oil to the Upper Region under throttled conditions. Additionally, the leakage locally affected the oil patterns of the 3 rd Land and skirt. This study is the first to document many phenomena involved in oil transport within the Lower Region. The scaling relationships that resulted from such analysis created a framework that is an initial step towards a more complete model of oil transport in the Lower Region. by Eric B. SenzerThesis (Ph.

40|$|Blowby {{emissions}} {{contribute a}} significant part of total hydrocarbon emission by an automobile, but no effort has so far been made in our country to control the same. The diesel engineers have, so far, neglected investigations in this held and the literature available on blowby emissions investigation is very scarce. This paper deals with investigations on the control of blowby emissions in high power turbocharged diesel engine by installing positive crank case ventilation (PCV) system. The lubricating oil mist escaping with <b>blowby</b> <b>gases</b> is also quite significant. Feasibility of recovering this mist by installing in the PCV system a lubricating oil mist separator, designed and fabricated for the purpose has been established. The results obtained clearly show that the blowby emissions can be effectively controlled with the help of PCV system. However, the cross-section area of the PCV pipe has to be adjusted according to the amount of <b>blowby</b> <b>gases</b> and the inflow of ventilating air through the breather. It was possible to separate the lubricating oil mist in the <b>blowby</b> <b>gases</b> and return the lubricating oil back to sump {{with the use of a}} mist separator installed in the PCV system. The PCV system and lubricating oil mist separator both can be retrofitted even on engines in service. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd...|$|R

40|$|Master's thesis in Petroleum engineeringThe EPCI (Engineering, Procurement, Construction and installation) {{contractor}} which {{delivered the}} PSVs to Alvheim {{states that the}} PSVs are sized to handle a <b>gas</b> <b>blowby</b> scenario. Marathon Norge AS does not hold any documentation of this. The object for this thesis is to verify and document that the PSVs can handle a <b>gas</b> <b>blowby</b> scenario. The equipments which have been investigated are: The Alvheim/ 3 rd party Inlet separator The 2 nd stage separator The produced water degassing drum Glycol Flash Drum Cargo tanks It is concluded {{that it is not}} sufficient to only consider the <b>gas</b> <b>blowby</b> case without including the effect of closed outlets due to high pressure. It seems that the EPCI contractor has not included closed outlet when sizing the PSVs for a <b>gas</b> <b>blowby</b> scenario. The PSVs for Alvheim/ 3 rd party Inlet separator and Glycol Flash drum are verified in this report by conservative calculations and simulations assuming a <b>gas</b> <b>blowby</b> scenario with closed outlets. The conservative computation does not verify that the PSVs for the 2 nd stage separator, the produced water degassing drum and the cargo tanks are sized for <b>gas</b> <b>blowby.</b> However, the dynamic simulation shows that the conservative scenarios are too conservative. The trivial dynamic simulation shows that the PSVs for the 2 nd stage separator are large enough to handle a <b>gas</b> <b>blowby</b> scenario with closed outlets. In spite of this result it is recommended that a more detailed dynamic simulation is to be designed to verify sufficient PSV capacity for these scenarios. First of all it is recommended to implement more details into the steady state simulation for the 2 nd stage separator and the degassing drum and investigate if it is possible to assume open liquid outlets even though the downstream pumps trip...|$|R
40|$|The {{automotive}} industry is, perhaps, {{and that is}} left open to debate, {{one of the most}} important engineering fields, and one which is increasingly influential on our everyday lives. Automotive engineering brings together all aspects of engineering knowledge to produce the one product that so many people have become dependent upon. The industry itself is vast and many tangents can be drawn from it, hence here we must define the area of interest to which this work relates. The initial concept for the work carried out stems from the passenger car industry; however, the work has more farreaching benefits and implications. As passenger vehicles become increasingly popular and increasingly advanced, so the need increases to understand more of the operation of all aspects of the vehicle. This work stems from a need to gain understanding of the flow of breather and <b>blowby</b> <b>gases</b> within an internal combustion engine (ICE) with the long-term aim of fully understanding the processes involved to enable improved engine design and reduced pollutant production. The latter is a significant driving force as legislation becomes more strict on the level of pollutants emitted from vehicles and engines. This work therefore not only reflects on passenger vehicles, but any other industry or product that uses ICEs. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceJaguar Cars Ltd. GBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Engine oil {{consumption}} {{is an important}} source of hydrocarbon and particulate emissions in modem automobile engines. Great efforts have been made by automotive manufacturers to minimize the impact of {{oil consumption}} on engine emissions. Research engineers in the last decade have been trying to study the sources and driving mechanism of oil consumption. In contrast to oil consumption mechanisms in the piston-ring-liner system of the engine, the Positive Crankcase Ventilation (PCV) blowby-oil consumption mechanism has not yet been fully characterized. Studies have shown that the blowby contribution to oil consumption could be significant under certain conditions. In this study, an experimental approach was taken in order to study the sources and characteristics of oil in the PCV <b>blowby</b> <b>gases</b> at different speeds and loads. An extensive diagnostic system was successfully integrated in a production spark ignition engine, to measure total oil consumption, blowby oil consumption and flow and in-cylinder variables, such as inter-ring pressures, oil film thickness and liner temperatures. Results showed an increase in blowby oil consumption with load and speed. Blowby flow was mainly dependent on the load of the engine. Oil concentration in the blowby varied with engine operating conditions. A strong relationship was observed between oil consumption and sump oil level, showing that the oil in the crankcase is {{an important source of}} oil in the blowby. Moreover, extensive experiments were conducted to determine the blowby flow's oil characteristics, by varying the liner temperatures and analyzing the mass distribution of different oil particle size. It was found that the average oil droplet size decreased as the load and speed were increased. (cont.) This work is an important step in understanding blowby oil consumption in efforts to minimize oil consumption in spark ignition engines. by Oscar Lopez. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|Graduation date: 1985 Adequate {{lubrication}} is of {{the utmost}} importance in internal combustion engines. Low temperature operation with low-proof alcohol may create some operational problems if alcohol and/or water accumulates in the crankcase oil. Condensates of unburned alcohol and water may be blown into the crankcase oil with <b>blowby</b> <b>gases.</b> These condensates may form an emulsion with the crankcase oil that may restrict the supply of oil for adequate lubrication. Three engine tests were performed to identify the effect of low-proof ethanol fueling on crankcase oil dilution and degradation. The first test was hydrous ethanol carburetion in a 2. 3 liter, 4 cylinder, 1974 Ford gasoline engine. The second test was a mixture of low-proof ethanol fumigation and normal diesel fuel injection (at reduced rate) in an Allis-Chalmers Model 2900 turbocharged diesel engine. The third test was also a mixture of ethanol fumigation and diesel injection in an Allis-Chalmers Model 2800 naturally aspirated diesel engine. Ethanol of 130 and 160 proof was used in these tests. The duration of each test was six hours steady operation. Independent parameters of crankcase oil temperature, engine load and speed, percent of total energy in the form of ethyl alcohol and proof of the ethyl alcohol were considered and varied. After each test the oil was sampled for American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) laboratory tests for determination of flash points, fire points, water by centrifuge, water by distillation, and viscosity at room temperature. Results for the first test indicate that the use of ethanol of 130 proof or less may result in accumulation of water in the crankcase oil that may be harmful to the engine. In the second and third tests although there was a decrease in fire and flash points {{as well as in the}} viscosity of the oil, no appreciable amount of water or alcohol was detected in the crankcase oil. It is important to mention that there was a maximum alcohol fuel flow rate beyond which the diesel engine starts to knock or misfire...|$|R
40|$|The {{piston rings}} {{are the most}} {{important}} part in engine which controls the lubricating oil consumption and <b>blowby</b> of the <b>gases.</b> The lubricating film of oil is provided to seal of gases towards crankcase and also to give smooth friction free translatory motion between rings and liner. Of the three rings present top ring is more crucial as it does the main work of restricting gases downwards the crankcase. Boundary lubrication is present at the Top dead centre (TDC) and Bottom dead centre (BDC) of the liner surface. In addition to this, top ring is exposed to high temperature gases which makes the oil present near the top ring to get evaporated and decreasing its viscosity, making metal-metal contact most of the time. Due to this at TDC, excess wear happens on the liner which is termed as Top ring reversal bore wear. The wear rate depends upon many parameters such as lubrication condition, viscosity index, contact type, normal forces acting on ring, geometry of ring face, surface roughness, material property. The present work explores the wear depth for different geometries of barrel ring using Finite Element model with the help of Archard wear law and the same is validated through experimentation. The study reveals that Asymmetric barrel rings have less contact pressure which in turn reduces the wear at Top dead centre...|$|R

The automotive industry is subject to increasing pressure to reduce the CO emissions and improve fuel efficiency in internal combustion engines. Improvements may be achieved {{in a number of}} ways. The parasitic losses throughout the engine cycle emanate from friction in all engine contact conjunctions in addition to pumping losses. In particular one main contributory conjunction is the piston ring pack assembly. At low engine speeds, the contribution of friction to the total losses within the engine is increased significantly compared with the thermodynamic losses. Additionally, the sealing capability of the ring is crucial in determining the power output of the engine with any loss of sealing contributing to power loss, as well as blowby. Most reported studies on compression ring-cylinder conjunction do not take into account complex ring in-plane and out-of-plane elastodynamics. Hitherto, {{there has not been a}} numerical methodology which integrates tribology of an elastic compression ring, subject to modal behaviour in a coupled solution. This paper discusses the inclusion of transient ring elastodynamics of the top compression ring, interacting with blowby effects within the ring pack. The ring dynamics methodology is briefly highlighted for both in-plane and out-of-plane motions. In addition, a one-dimensional gas flow model that captures blowby behaviour is included. A case study is presented, using measured engine data. Gas flow and frictional losses at various engine speeds are predicted. The effect of <b>gas</b> <b>blowby</b> on the ring's tribological response can be ascertained, as well as the ring's dynamic motion within its retaining groove.
