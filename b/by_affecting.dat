5|$|The game offers three {{different}} skill levels. Level 1 is the easiest, as {{it uses a}} simplified room layout missing one of the castles {{and one of the}} mazes, and doesn't include the bat and one of the dragons. Level 2 is the full version of the game, with the various objects appearing in set positions {{at the start of the}} game. Level 3 is similar to Level 2, but the location of the objects is randomized to provide a more challenging game. In addition, the player can use the difficulty switches on the Atari 2600 to further control the game's difficulty <b>by</b> <b>affecting</b> the behavior of the dragons: one switch controls the dragons' bite speed, and one causes them to flee when the player is wielding the sword.|$|E

25|$|In {{the fruit}} fly insulin both {{regulate}}s blood sugar {{as well as}} acting as a growth factor. Thus, in the fruit fly, serotonergic neurons regulate the adult body size <b>by</b> <b>affecting</b> insulin secretion. Serotonin has also been identified as the trigger for swarm behavior in locusts. In humans, though insulin regulates blood sugar and IGF regulates growth, serotonin controls the release of both hormones, modulating insulin release from the beta cells in the pancreas through serotonylation of GTPase signaling proteins. Exposure to SSRIs during Pregnancy reduces fetal growth.|$|E

Those mutations are primarily noted in domains which span amino acids 98-108, 178-190 or 225-238 of the p66 subunit. The most frequent mutations observed in viruses isolated from patients who have been on a failing NNRTI containing chemotherapy are Lys-103N and Tyr-181C. NNRTI resistance has been linked to over 40 amino acid substitutions in vitro and in vivo.|$|E

25|$|Therefore, {{the use of}} placebos is a {{standard}} control component of most clinical trials, which attempt to {{make some sort of}} quantitative assessment of the efficacy of medicinal drugs or treatments. Such a test or clinical trial is called a placebo-controlled study, and its control is of the negative type. A study whose control is a previously tested treatment, rather than no treatment, is called a positive-control study, because its control is of the positive type. Government regulatory agencies approve new drugs only after tests establish not only that patients respond to them, but also that their effect is greater than that of a placebo (by way of affecting more patients, <b>by</b> <b>affecting</b> responders more strongly, or both).|$|E
25|$|Research {{has been}} able to show the {{function}} of niacin in the pathway lipid metabolism. It is seen that this vitamin can decrease the synthesis of apoB-containing lipoproteins such as VLDL, LDL, IDL and Lipoprotein (a) via several mechanisms: (1) Directly inhibiting the action of DGAT2, a key enzyme for triglyceride synthesis; (2) It has the ability to bind to the receptor HCAR2 thereby decreasing lipolysis and FFA flux to the liver for triglyceride synthesis; and (3) increased apoB catabolism. On the other hand, HDL cholesterol levels are increased by niacin through direct and indirect pathways. (4) Niacin decreases CETP mass and activity, and this synergistic effect with the decrease in triglyceride levels, can indirectly raise HDL cholesterol levels. The study has also been able to show direct effects on the beta chain of ATP synthase (5) and on production (6) and hepatic uptake (7) of apoA-I also increase HDL cholesterol levels. Thus <b>by</b> <b>affecting</b> the pathway reducing lipid levels help in reducing CVD.|$|E
500|$|Both {{temperature}} and rainfall vary significantly by location within the park. [...] Lower temperatures are found at higher elevations, {{and the eastern}} slopes of the massif receive {{the most of the}} rainfall, since the western slopes lie in the rain shadow of the mountain and consequently experience a prolonged dry period. [...] The tops of the ridges experience strong winds and offer poor soil conditions. [...] The effect {{can be seen in the}} plant life and their growth rates. [...] The wide range in elevations and the rugged topography also play a crucial role in creation of the varied habitats distributed across the mountain slopes <b>by</b> <b>affecting</b> air temperature, fluctuations in temperature, and humidity levels. [...] The interplay between these factors impacts the growth and development of plants, which form the foundation of the ecosystem. [...] The result is an extremely varied and unevenly distributed forest that covers 90% of the park.|$|E
