5000|$|Various {{parameters}} are defined and specified {{to quantify the}} performance of optical switches. The steady state performance of an optical switch (or optical switching matrix) is measured by its ability to effectively transmit optical power from an input port {{to any one of}} N output ports over the “on” state transmission path, and its ability to effectively isolate input power sources from all non-active ports over the “off” state transmission paths. Other key optical performance parameters include transmission efficiency over a range of wavelengths, the ability to minimize input optical power reflected back into the input fiber, transmission balance, and <b>bidirectional</b> <b>transmission.</b> The optical switch (or switching matrix) transient behavior is another important characteristic that is specified by its speed of response to control stimulation via the time interval it takes to either transmit or block the optical signal on any given output port. Two rates can be associated with switches: the switching rate and the signal transmission rate. The switching rate is the rate at which a switch changes states. The signal transmission rate is the modulation rate of information passing through a switch. The signal transmission rate is usually much greater than the switching rate. (If the switching rate approaches or exceeds the transmission rate, then the switch can be called an optical modulator.) ...|$|E

40|$|The Distributed Coordination Function (DCF) is the {{mandatory}} access method for any compliant device in Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) {{based on the}} IEEE 802. 11 Standard. WLAN Access Points (APs) and stations (STAs) contend for the access to the wireless channel in order to transmit data by using a variation of Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA). In doing so, they consume {{a significant amount of}} energy for continuously monitoring the channel state. In this paper we investigate backwards-compatible mechanisms to increase throughput and energy efficiency in WLANs during contention periods based on DCF. The first mechanism is called Bi-Directional DCF (BD-DCF) because it allows for <b>bidirectional</b> <b>transmissions</b> between APs and STAs with a single channel access invocation. The second mechanism is called Bi-Directional Sleep DCF (BDSL-DCF) as it allows overhearing STAs to enter the sleep state, i. e. switch off the radio transceiver, during <b>bidirectional</b> <b>transmissions.</b> We analyze the performance limits of the proposed protocols in terms of throughput and energy efficiency considering different values for the data packet length and data rate.

In this standard, the currently employed Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) and the Binary Exponential Backoff (BEB) mechanism represent major sources of energy consumption at both the access point and mobile stations of a WLAN.

This paper studies the two-way 2 × 2 × 2 relay network, {{a class of}} four-unicast networks, where there are four source/destination nodes and two relay nodes, with each source {{sending a message to}} its destination. We show that without relay caching the total degrees of freedom (DoF) is bounded from above by 8 / 3, indicating that bidirectional links do not double the DoF (It is known that the total DoF of one-way 2 × 2 × 2 relay network is 2.). Further, we show that the DoF of 8 / 3 is achievable for the two-way 2 × 2 × 2 relay network with relay caching. Finally, even though the DoF of this network is no more than 8 / 3 for generic channel gains, DoF of 4 can be achieved for a symmetric configuration of channel gains.
