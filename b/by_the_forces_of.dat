The bridge's destruction during Ragnarök <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>forces</b> <b>of</b> Muspell is foretold. Scholars have proposed that the bridge may have originally represented the Milky Way and have noted parallels between the bridge and another bridge in Norse mythology, Gjallarbrú.|$|E

5|$|The {{landing at}} Anzac Cove on Sunday, 25 April 1915, {{also known as}} the landing at Gaba Tepe, and to the Turks as the Arıburnu Battle, was part of the amphibious {{invasion}} of the Gallipoli Peninsula <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>forces</b> <b>of</b> the British Empire, which began the land phase of the Gallipoli Campaign of the First World War.|$|E
5|$|The third {{attack on}} Anzac Cove (19 May 1915) was an {{engagement}} during the Gallipoli Campaign of the First World War. The attack was conducted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>forces</b> <b>of</b> the Ottoman Turkish Empire, against {{the forces of}} the British Empire defending the cove.|$|E
5|$|A French-aligned Haitian general, André Rigaud, had {{instructed}} his forces to attack all foreign shipping within their range of operations. Accordingly, once Experiment and her convoy of merchant ships neared Gonâve, the picaroons attacked them, capturing {{two of the}} American merchant ships before withdrawing. Experiment managed to save the other two ships in her convoy, and escorted them to a friendly port. On the American side, only {{the captain of the}} schooner Mary was killed. Though the picaroons took heavy losses during this engagement, they remained strong enough to continue wreaking havoc among American shipping in the region. Only after Rigaud was forced out of power <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>forces</b> <b>of</b> Toussaint L'Ouverture, leader of the 1791 Haitian Revolution, did the picaroon attacks cease.|$|E

5|$|A castle {{may have}} been {{constructed}} on Castle Island by 1257, when the 16-year-old King Alexander III of Scotland was forcibly brought there by his regents. During the First War of Scottish Independence (1296–1328), the invading English army held the castle, then named Loch Leven Castle, which lies at a strategically important position between the towns of Edinburgh, Stirling and Perth. Parts of the present fortification, the curtain wall, may date from this time and were perhaps built by the occupying English. The castle was captured by the Scots {{before the end of}} the 13th century, possibly <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>forces</b> <b>of</b> William Wallace.|$|E
5|$|Amyntas III {{was forced}} to flee his kingdom in either 393 or 383BC (based on {{conflicting}} accounts), owing to a massive invasion by the Illyrian Dardani led by Bardylis. The pretender to the throne Argaeus ruled in his absence, yet AmyntasIII eventually returned to his kingdom {{with the aid of}} Thessalian allies. AmyntasIII was also nearly overthrown <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>forces</b> <b>of</b> the Chalcidian city of Olynthos, but with the aid of Teleutias, brother of the Spartan king Agesilaus II, the Macedonians forced Olynthos to surrender and dissolve their Chalcidian League in 379BC.|$|E
5|$|As {{a direct}} {{connection}} between Tyrol and Milan, the Grisons {{and in particular the}} Val Müstair became strategically important to the Habsburgs. The Umbrail Pass in the Val Müstair connects the Vinschgau valley (Val Venosta) in southern Tyrol with the Valtellina in northern Italy. Furthermore, the Habsburgs and the Bishop of Chur had been quarrelling over the judicial rights over the region for some time. On January 20, 1499, Habsburg troops occupied the valley and plundered the Benedictine Convent of Saint John at Müstair, but were soon driven back <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>forces</b> <b>of</b> the Three Leagues, and an armistice was signed already on February 2 in Glurns (Glorenza), a village in the upper Vinschgau.|$|E
50|$|According to Human Right Watch, the {{violence}} still persisted. Pro-Gbagbo militias had {{killed at least}} 220 people during the days immediately {{before or after the}} arrest of Gbagbo.

In August, similar events committed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>force</b> <b>of</b> Ouattara were reported again <b>by</b> <b>the</b> media.

5|$|Assuming {{command of}} United States Central Command in 1988, Schwarzkopf was {{called on to}} respond to the Invasion of Kuwait in 1990 <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>forces</b> <b>of</b> Iraq under Saddam Hussein. Initially tasked with {{defending}} Saudi Arabia from Iraqi aggression, Schwarzkopf's command eventually grew to an international force of over 750,000 troops. After diplomatic relations broke down, he planned and led Operation Desert Storm—an extended air campaign followed by a highly successful 100-hour ground offensive—which defeated the Iraqi Army and liberated Kuwait in early 1991. Schwarzkopf was presented with military honors.|$|E
5|$|Bapaume {{itself was}} a small town linked by rail to Albert and Arras. There were also four major roads running through the town; running to Albert in the south-west, to Peronne in the south-east; to Cambrai {{in the east and}} to the north lay Arras. Captured <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>forces</b> <b>of</b> Imperial Germany {{in the early stages of}} the war, it had been the focus of the British forces on the opening day of the Battle of Somme in 1916. Still in German hands, it had been largely {{destroyed}} in early 1917 following their withdrawal to the Hindenburg Line. Extensive booby traps had also been left and these troubled the Australians that moved into the town afterwards. It was subsequently recaptured by the Germans during the Spring Offensive. The land surrounding Bapaume was relatively flat and thus was conducive to the use of tanks.|$|E
5|$|Buenos Aires and Montevideo {{successfully}} resisted two British invasions. In 1806, a small British army led by William Carr Beresford seized Buenos Aires {{for a brief}} time; a Montevidean army led by Santiago de Liniers liberated the city. The following year, {{a larger}} army seized Montevideo, but was overwhelmed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>forces</b> <b>of</b> Buenos Aires; the invaders capitulated and returned Montevideo to the viceroyalty. There was no aid from Spain during either invasion. Liniers organized criollo militias during the preparations for the second invasion, {{in spite of the}} prohibition against them. The Patricios Regiment, led by Cornelio Saavedra, was the biggest criollo army. These events gave criollos military power and political influence {{that they did not have}} before and, since the victory was achieved without any help from Spain, it boosted criollo confidence in their independent capabilities.|$|E

5|$|Edward now {{seized the}} initiative, and moved northwards. Lancaster convened one final meeting at Doncaster in November, and also entered into an {{alliance}} with Robert I of Scotland to strengthen his hand against the King. In January 1322 Edward crossed the River Severn, and secured the surrender {{of several of the}} marcher lords while Lancaster remained passive. As the royal army crossed the River Trent after the Battle of Burton Bridge, Lancaster was forced to flee north. On 16 March Lancaster and his army had reached Boroughbridge by the River Ure where they were joined by the Earl's Secretary Sir Robert de Holland and the force he had raised in Lancashire. There they were cut off <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>forces</b> <b>of</b> Sir Andrew Harclay, a veteran from the Scottish wars, who had gathered the levies from the counties of Cumberland and Westmorland.|$|E
5|$|For a time, Arsaces {{consolidated}} {{his position}} in Parthia and Hyrcania {{by taking advantage of}} the invasion of Seleucid territory in the west by Ptolemy III Euergetes (r.246–222BC) of Egypt. This conflict with Ptolemy, the Third Syrian War (246–241BC), also allowed Diodotus I to rebel and form the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom in Central Asia. The latter's successor, Diodotus II, formed an alliance with Arsaces against the Seleucids, but Arsaces was temporarily driven from Parthia <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>forces</b> <b>of</b> Seleucus II Callinicus (r.246–225BC). After spending some time in exile among the nomadic Apasiacae tribe, Arsaces led a counterattack and recaptured Parthia. Seleucus II's successor, Antiochus III the Great (r.222–187BC), was unable to immediately retaliate because his troops were engaged in putting down the rebellion of Molon in Media.|$|E
5|$|From October to November 1944, the Yugoslav Partisans, {{supported}} {{by both the}} Western Allies and the Soviet Union, and assisted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>forces</b> <b>of</b> the Bulgarian Fatherland Front and two brigades of Albanian partisans, retook the region of Kosovo as the Germans withdrew. The area was reincorporated into the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia. With no chance of victory, the withdrawing Germans helped Albanian collaborators escape the country as the communists drew closer. Many failed to escape and were executed by the communists upon capture. On 28 November 1944, the communist forces of Enver Hoxha emerged victorious in Albania. Hoxha subsequently implemented a totalitarian Stalinist government which banned all religions in the country.|$|E

5|$|In 1071, {{the sixth}} Count of Flanders, Arnulf III, {{was killed in}} the first Battle of Cassel <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>forces</b> <b>of</b> Robert the Frisian in a dispute over the {{succession}} to the title of count. Although Arnulf was numerically superior and was supported by King Philip I of France, Robert was able to defeat his rival's army and took the title of Count of Flanders with the acquiescence of Philip I after a further five years of struggle. The town was re-fortified, possibly by Robert, with a castle and a new set of walls built on the remains of the old Roman walls. The castle does not survive today – it was already in ruins by the early 18th century – but is depicted on old engravings as a large square tower, the Tour Grise, dominating the western flank of the hill.|$|E
5|$|In Tolkien's Middle-earth legendarium, Lúthien was {{the most}} {{beautiful}} of all the Children of Ilúvatar, and forsook her immortality for her love of the mortal warrior Beren.

Ultimately, when Beren was slain in battle against the demonic wolf Carcharoth, Lúthien, like Orpheus, approached the Valar, the angelic order of beings placed in charge of the world by Eru (God), and persuaded them to restore her beloved to life.|$|E
5|$|In {{between these}} campaigns Rupert had visited his uncle's court in England. The Palatinate cause {{was a popular}} Protestant issue in England, and in 1637 a general public {{subscription}} helped fund an expedition under Charles Louis to try and regain the electorate {{as part of a}} joint French campaign. Rupert was placed in command of a Palatinate cavalry regiment, and his later friend Lord Craven, an admirer of Rupert's mother, assisted in raising funds and accompanied the army on the campaign. The campaign ended badly at the Battle of Vlotho (17 October 1638) during the invasion of Westphalia; Rupert escaped death, but was captured <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>forces</b> <b>of</b> the Imperial General Melchior von Hatzfeldt {{towards the end of the}} battle.|$|E
