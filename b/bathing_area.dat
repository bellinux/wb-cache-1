25|$|In Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the Philippines, and the United Kingdom, {{a pair of}} red-yellow flags is used to {{mark the}} limits of the <b>bathing</b> <b>area</b> on a beach, usually guarded by surf lifesavers. If the beach is closed, the poles of the flags are crossed. The flags are {{coloured}} with a red triangle and a yellow triangle making a rectangular flag, or a red rectangle over a yellow rectangle. On many Australian beaches there is a slight variation with beach condition signaling. A red flag signifies a closed beach (in the UK also other dangers), yellow signifies strong current or difficult swimming conditions, and green represents a beach safe for general swimming. In Ireland, a red and yellow flag indicates that it is safe to swim; a red flag that it is unsafe; and no flag indicates that there are no lifeguards on duty. Blue flags may also be used away from the yellow-red lifesaver area to designate a zone for surfboarding and other small, non-motorised watercraft.|$|E
25|$|In the 18th century {{only the}} nobility and wealthy had bathtubs in their homes, at the Marais and Faubourg Saint-Germain, the fashionable districts of the time. Other Parisians either did not bathe at all, bathed with a bucket, or {{went to one}} of the public bath houses, which {{provided}} hot tubs of water for a fee. They were heavily taxed by the government, and only a dozen survived {{until the end of the}} century. The more popular alternative, especially in summer, was bathing in the river from one of the large flat-bottomed bathing barges which were moored along the Seine, particularly on the right bank between the Cours-la-Reine and the Pont Marie. They were mostly former lumber barges, which were covered with wooden or straw roofs. Bathers paid an admission charge, then went down wooden steps from the barge into the river. Wooden pilings marked the limits of the <b>bathing</b> <b>area,</b> there were ropes to the pilings for the assistance of the numerous bathers who couldn't swim. In 1770 there were twenty such bathing barges, located at the Cours-la-Reine, the quai du Louvre, the quai Conti, across from the Palais-Bourbon, and at the western end of the Île-de-la-Cité, an establishment opened by the Canons of Notre-Dame. There were separate barges for men and women, and the bathers were offered bathing costumes for rent, but many preferred to bathe nude, men frequently swam into the women's area or swam along the river in full view of the people on riverbank. In 1723 the Lieutenant-General of Police condemned the baths as an offense to public morality and urged that they be moved from the center of the city, but they were popular and remained. In 1783 the police finally restricted bathing in the river during the day, but bathing at night was still allowed.|$|E

50|$|During the Meiji period (1867-1912) {{the design}} of Japanese baths changed considerably. The narrow {{entrance}} to the <b>bathing</b> <b>area</b> was widened considerably to a regular-sized sliding door, the bathtubs were sunk partially in the floor {{so that they could}} be entered more easily, and the height of the ceiling of the bath house was then doubled. Since the bath now focused on hot water instead of steam, windows could be added, and the <b>bathing</b> <b>area</b> became much brighter. The only difference between these baths and the modern bath was the use of wood for the <b>bathing</b> <b>area</b> and the lack of faucets.|$|E
