25|$|Immediately {{south of}} the marina's {{breakwater}} is Claytons Beach, a small, unpatrolled <b>beach</b> <b>that</b> is a popular spot for surfers.

25|$|In {{the early}} 1800s, the <b>beach</b> <b>that</b> would become Nye Beach was demarcated {{to the south}} by the Yaquina River and a rocky {{outcropping}} known as Jump-off Joe. In those days, Jump-off Joe extended into the sea and posed an obstacle to beach traffic. By the mid-20th century, coastal erosion had caused the sea stack to separate from the cliff, develop an arch, and finally crumble, leaving only a scattering of rock formations to mark the spot. Without this natural barrier nothing remains to separate Nye Beach from Agate Beach State Recreation Site to the north.|$|E
