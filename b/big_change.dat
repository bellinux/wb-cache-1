5|$|Football on the Pacific Coast {{had been}} on the rise since the late 1910s. Early in 1922, Warner signed a {{contract}} with Stanford University in which he would begin coaching in 1924 (after his contract with Pitt expired). Health concerns, a significant pay raise and the rising status of Pacific Coast football made Warner make the <b>big</b> <b>change.</b> Years later, he wrote:I felt my health would be better on the Pacific coast. Weather conditions at Pittsburgh during the football season are rather disagreeable, and much of the late season work had to be done upon a field which was ankle deep in mud. At the close of every season I would be in poor physical condition, twice being rendered incapable of coaching while I recuperated in a hospital. Doctors advised me that the climate of the Pacific coast would be much better for a man of my age and in the work in which I was engaged.|$|E

25|$|When the 2nd Arkansas Infantry Regiment {{was changed}} to artillery, the blue hat cord {{was changed to}} red and the collar {{insignia}} was changed from the crossed rifles to crossed cannon. But the <b>big</b> <b>change</b> was from the rifle to the six-inch howitzer, which was used in shelling enemy positions. It took eight horses to pull {{one of the big}} cannons. After several months of classroom training, the 142nd began live fire on the horse drawn 4.7inch weapon in April 1918. After two and one-half months in the field conducting live fire training, the 142nd was certified for overseas service.|$|E

25|$|With the 1994–95 NHL lockout in place, the Mighty Ducks did {{not play}} on the ice again until January 20, 1995. The {{shortened}} season marked the debut of Paul Kariya, who played in 47 of the team's 48 games that year, scoring 18 goals and 21 assists for 39 points. The Ducks had another respectable season, going 16–27–5. 1995–96 marked a <b>big</b> <b>change</b> for the team, especially for second-year superstar Kariya. During the season, he was chosen {{to play for the}} Western Conference in the 1996 NHL All-Star Game as the lone Ducks representative. At the time of his selection, (January 1996), he was ranked 14th in league scoring with 51 points (23 goals and 28 assists) over 42 games. Despite Kariya's efforts, the Ducks were a low-scoring team.|$|E

The squadron received eighteen CF-100s, of which a prototype of its first aircraft, the Mark IV, had flown on 11 October 1952. It received its first Mk-4As in June 1954 (i.e. Tail No. 18211/18223), seeing an engine boost in the MK-4Bs it began to receive in February 1955 (i.e. Tail No. 18331/18356) and the <b>big</b> <b>change</b> with the Mk-5s (i.e. Tail No. 18464/18542) it began to receive in March 1956 (losing its guns).|$|E

25|$|In 1965 Lemass {{was once}} again re-elected Taoiseach. The <b>big</b> <b>change</b> was the {{retirement}} of such political heavyweights as James Ryan and Seán MacEntee, with Lynch taking over from the former as Minister for Finance. This appointment was particularly significant because Lemass was coming {{to the end of}} his premiership and wanted to prepare a successor. As a result, Lynch took charge of the second most important position in the Government, gaining widespread experience in a number of affairs, and accompanying Lemass to London to sign one of the most important trade agreements between Ireland and the United Kingdom. One occasion in which Lynch's authority was seen to be undermined as Minister for Finance was when the Minister for Education, Donogh O'Malley, announced that the government would provide free secondary school education for all. This proposal had not been discussed at Cabinet level as would be required to fund such a service. It subsequently transpired that Lemass had previously agreed the decision without cabinet discussion as was required.|$|E

IGN ranked [...] "Tricia Tanaka Is Dead" [...] as the second worst Lost episode, above only [...] "Stranger in a Strange Land", explaining [...] "Is there a better metaphor that Lost was running in circles at this point in Season 3 than seeing several of the castaways driving in circles on the island, with goofy grins on their faces?...

[...] She was given a regular backup slot in Detective Comics starting with issue #384 (February 1969), alternating issues with Robin until issue #404, after which she had the backup slot to herself. Frank Robbins wrote nearly all of these backups, which were penciled first by Gil Kane and later by Don Heck. Barbara Gordon’s Batgirl exceeded the earlier Bat-Girl and Batwoman characters in popularity, and readers requested for her to appear in other titles. Although some readers requested that Batwoman also continue to appear in publication, DC responded to the fan-based acclaim and criticism of the new character in an open letter in Detective Comics #417 (1971), stating: [...] "I'd like {{to say a few words}} about the reaction some readers have to Batgirl.
