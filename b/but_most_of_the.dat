5|$|At 16:00 on 30 January, {{a flight}} of 11 Mitsubishi torpedo bombers from the 751 Air Group, based at Kavieng and staging through Buka, {{attacked}} the force towing Chicago.

One torpedo hit the destroyer , causing heavy damage. Four more torpedoes hit Chicago, sinking her.|$|E
5|$|Bat dung, {{a type of}} guano, is rich in nitrates and is mined from caves for use as fertilizer.

5|$|Crawford led about 500 {{volunteer}} militiamen, {{mostly from}} Pennsylvania, deep into American Indian territory, {{with the intention}} of surprising the Indians. The Indians and their British allies from Detroit had already learned of the expedition, however, and gathered a force to oppose the Americans. After a day of indecisive fighting near the Sandusky towns, the Americans found themselves surrounded and attempted to retreat. The retreat turned into a rout, <b>but</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Americans managed to find their way back to Pennsylvania. About 70 Americans were killed; Indian and British losses were minimal.|$|E

5|$|Isabella and Mortimer rapidly took {{revenge on}} the former regime.

Edward's former chancellor, Robert Baldock, died in Fleet Prison; the Earl of Arundel was beheaded. Edward's position, however, was problematic; he was still married to Isabella and, in principle, he remained the king, <b>but</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new administration {{had a lot to}} lose were he to be released and potentially regain power.|$|E
