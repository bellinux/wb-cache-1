Saturated sodium (or potassium) chloride {{solution is}} {{passed through the}} anode compartment, leaving at a lower concentration. This method also produces very pure sodium (or potassium) hydroxide <b>but</b> <b>has</b> <b>the</b> disadvantage of requiring very pure brine at high concentrations.|$|E

For example, he showed that the Cantor set is nowhere dense, <b>but</b> <b>has</b> <b>the</b> same cardinality as the set of all real numbers, whereas the rationals are everywhere dense, but countable. He also showed that all countable dense linear orders without end points are order-isomorphic to the rational numbers.|$|E
5|$|Type C: This Mini {{connector}} {{is smaller}} than the type A plug, measuring 10.42mm × 2.42mm <b>but</b> <b>has</b> <b>the</b> same 19-pin configuration. It is intended for portable devices. The differences are that all positive signals of the differential pairs are swapped with their corresponding shield, the DDC/CEC Ground is assigned to pin 13 instead of pin 17, the CEC is assigned to pin 14 instead of pin 13, and the reserved pin is 17 instead of pin 14. The type C Mini connector can be connected to a type A connector using a type A-to-type C cable.|$|E
5|$|Units have {{a primary}} job which determines the stat boosts they receive when they level {{up and the}} {{attributes}} associated with that class. A unit may also have a secondary job set of abilities, where it can use any abilities of the selected job, but with the stat profile of the primary job. For example, an Assassin with a Sniper secondary job could use abilities from both jobs, <b>but</b> <b>has</b> <b>the</b> stat profile and appearance of an Assassin, its primary job. This may deny the use of some abilities depending on their equipped weapon. In the previous example, any abilities that require the possession of a great bow, {{will not be allowed}} for use if the character has a Katana equipped.|$|E

5|$|Some {{variation}} {{is seen in}} the 12 subspecies of house sparrows, which are divided into two groups, the Oriental P. d. indicus group, and the Palaearctic P. d. domesticus group. Birds of the P. d. domesticus group have grey cheeks, while P. d. indicus group birds have white cheeks, as well as bright colouration on the crown, a smaller bill, and a longer black bib. The subspecies P. d. tingitanus differs little from the nominate subspecies, except in the worn breeding plumage of the male, in which the head is speckled with black and underparts are paler. P. d. balearoibericus is slightly paler than the nominate, but darker than P. d. bibilicus. P. d. bibilicus is paler than most subspecies, <b>but</b> <b>has</b> <b>the</b> grey cheeks of P. d. domesticus group birds. The similar P. d. persicus is paler and smaller, and P. d. niloticus is nearly identical but smaller. Of the less widespread P. d. indicus group subspecies, P. d. hyrcanus is larger than P. d. indicus, P. d. hufufae is paler, P. d. bactrianus is larger and paler, and P. d. parkini is larger and darker with more black on the breast than any other subspecies.|$|E

25|$|Bonds to {{fluorine}} {{have considerable}} ionic character, {{a result of}} its small atomic radius and large electronegativity. Therefore, the bond length of F is influenced by its ionic radius, the size of ions in an ionic crystal, which is about 133pm for fluoride ions. The ionic radius of fluoride is much larger than its covalent radius. When F becomes F−, it gains one electron <b>but</b> <b>has</b> <b>the</b> same number of protons, meaning the attraction of the protons to the electrons is weaker, and the radius is larger.|$|E
