500|$|According to this account, Somerled {{agreed to}} join Olav in an {{expedition}} to raid Skye. The night before sailing, however, a ship wright or carpenter known as Maurice Mac Neil (the second name sometimes given as MacNiall or MacArill), by some accounts Somerled's nephew, secretly <b>bored</b> <b>holes</b> in the hull of Olav’s ship using tallow and butter to temporarily seal them. On entering the open seas the tallow was washed away {{by the action of}} the waves and the king’s ship began rapidly taking on water. Olav’s urgent appeal for help was spurned by Somerled, until he consented to the previously sought marriage. Maurice then boarded the King’s ship and filled the holes with wooden plugs he had previously prepared for the purpose. From that time the descendants of Maurice were called “MacIntyres,” “carpenters (or shipwrights) sons”.”, ...|$|E
500|$|Maple {{sugaring}} parties typically {{began to}} operate {{at the start of}} the spring thaw in regions of woodland with sufficiently large numbers of maples. Syrup makers first <b>bored</b> <b>holes</b> in the trunks, usually more than one hole per large tree; they then inserted wooden spouts into the holes and hung a wooden bucket from the protruding end of each spout to collect the sap. The buckets were commonly made by cutting cylindrical segments from a large tree trunk and then hollowing out each segment's core from one end of the cylinder, creating a seamless, watertight container. Sap filled the buckets, and was then either transferred to larger holding vessels (barrels, large pots, or hollowed-out wooden logs), often mounted on sledges or wagons pulled by draft animals, or carried in buckets or other convenient containers. The sap-collection buckets were returned to the spouts mounted on the trees, and the process was repeated for as long as the flow of sap remained [...] "sweet". The specific weather conditions of the thaw period were, and still are, critical in determining the length of the sugaring season. As the weather continues to warm, a maple tree's normal early spring biological process eventually alters the taste of the sap, making it unpalatable, perhaps due to an increase in amino acids.|$|E

2500|$|Near Drohobych and Boryslav in Galicia, {{significant}} {{oil reserves}} were [...] during the mid 19th and early 20th centuries. The first European attempt to drill for oil was in Bóbrka in western Galicia in 1854. By 1867, a well at Kleczany, in Western Galicia, was drilled using steam to about 200 meters. On December 31, 1872, a railway line linking Borysław (now Boryslav) with the nearby city of Drohobycz (now Drohobych) was opened. American John Simon Bergheim and Canadian William Henry McGarvey came to Galicia in 1882. In 1883, their company, MacGarvey and Bergheim, <b>bored</b> <b>holes</b> of 700 to 1,000 meters and found large oil deposits. In 1885, they renamed their oil developing enterprise the Galician-Karpathian Petroleum Company (...) , headquartered in Vienna, with McGarvey {{as the chief}} administrator and Bergheim as field engineer, and built a huge refinery at Maryampole near Gorlice, in {{the southeast corner of}} Galicia. Considered the biggest, most efficient enterprise in Austro-Hungary, Maryampole was built in six months and employed 1000 men. Subsequently, investors from Britain, Belgium, and Germany established companies to develop the oil and natural gas industries in Galicia. This influx of capital caused the number of petroleum enterprises to shrink from 900 to 484 by 1884, and to 285 companies manned by 3,700 workers by 1890. However, the number of oil refineries increased from thirty-one in 1880 to fifty-four in 1904. By 1904, there were thirty boreholes in Borysław of over 1,000 meters. Production increased by 50% between 1905 and 1906 and then trebled between 1906 and 1909 because of unexpected discoveries of vast oil reserves of which many were gushers. By 1909, production reached its peak at 2,076,000 tons or 4% of worldwide production. Often called the [...] "Polish Baku", the oil fields of Borysław and nearby Tustanowice accounted for over 90% of the national oil output of the Austria-Hungary Empire. From 500 residents in the 1860s, Borysław had swollen to 12,000 by 1898. In 1909, Polmin with headquarters in Lviv was established for the extraction and distribution of natural gas. At the turn of the century, Galicia was ranked fourth in the world as an oil producer. This significant increase in oil production also caused a slump in oil prices. A very rapid decrease in oil production in Galicia occurred just before the Balkans conflicts.|$|E

Before the beacon was built, the men lived in the Pharos floating light; a vessel which was moored not far from the Rock. Every day--weather permitting--they rowed to the rock, landed, and worked for one, two, or three hours, when they were drowned out, so to speak, and obliged to return to their floating home. Sometimes the landing was easy. More frequently it was difficult. Occasionally it was impossible. When a landing was accomplished, they used to set to work without delay. There was no time to lose. Some <b>bored</b> <b>holes</b> in the rock for hold-fasts; others, with pick and chisel, cut out the foundation-pit. Then the courses began to be laid. On each occasion of landing the smith had to set up his bellows, light his fire, and work in hot haste; because his whole shop, except the anvil, had to be taken down, and carried away every tide! Frequently, in fine weather, this enterprising son of Vulcan might have been seen toiling with his head enveloped in volumes of smoke and sparks, and his feet in the water, which gradually rose to his ankles and knees until, with a sudden [...] "hiss," [...] it extinguished his fire and ended his labours for the day.

We had to journey on. Two hours later we reached the foot of a tall isolated mountain, which is crowned by the crumbling castle of Banias, the stateliest ruin of that kind on earth, no doubt. It is a thousand feet long and two hundred wide, all of the most symmetrical, and at the same time the most ponderous masonry. The massive towers and bastions are more than thirty feet high, and have been sixty. From the mountain's peak its broken turrets rise above the groves of ancient oaks and olives, and look wonderfully picturesque. It is of such high antiquity that no man knows who built it or when it was built. It is utterly inaccessible, except in one place, where a bridle-path winds upward among the solid rocks to the old portcullis. The horses' hoofs have <b>bored</b> <b>holes</b> in these rocks to the depth of six inches during the hundreds and hundreds of years that the castle was garrisoned.

30|$|Let a DS be {{lowering}} {{in a plane}} circular <b>bore</b> <b>hole.</b> Then, it slides along the <b>bore</b> <b>hole</b> bottom line and its axis line is a circle of a radius ρ + a, where ρ is the radius of the <b>bore</b> <b>hole</b> axis T and a is the system clearance. In sliding, the DS is subjected to action of gravity (f gr), contact (f cont), and friction (f fr) forces. In consequence of these forces, the DS can be compressed in some segments of its length where it can begin to buckle without losing its contact with the well wall. It is necessary to predict the critical states of the DS and to construct the modes of its stability loss.|$|R
30|$|Not long ago, rather shallow wells {{with simple}} {{outlines}} were drilled {{in oil and}} gas fields. However, at the present time, deeper and more complicated trajectories of <b>bore</b> <b>holes</b> are designed in connection with exhaustion of easily accessible hydrocarbon sources. In 2015, the record 13.5  km horizontal <b>bore</b> <b>hole</b> was drilled in the Sakhalin region, Russia. According to experts’ opinions, most of the substantial achievements in the power engineering of the current century are associated with this technical direction. Particularly, some {{are related to the}} pioneering investigation of industrial extraction of shale oil and gas, whose deposits in the world essentially exceed conventional reserves. However, as a rule, drilling of such <b>bore</b> <b>holes</b> is attended by extraordinary phenomena bringing emergency situations. One of them is unstable bending buckling of a drill string (DS) in the channel of a curvilinear <b>bore</b> <b>hole</b> (Brett et al. 1989; Dawson and Paslay 1984; Kyllingstad 1995; Sawaryn et al. 2006; Gulyayev et al. 2009; Gao and Liu 2013; Huang and Gao 2014; Gao and Huang 2015). This effect is associated with deterioration of conditions of contact interaction between the DS and the <b>bore</b> <b>hole</b> wall, enlargement of friction forces, impossibility of transferring the required axial force to the bit, and the DS lockup situation. To predict these effects and exclude them in practice, computer simulation should be employed.|$|R
