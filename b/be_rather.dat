5|$|After the war, {{he worked}} as a {{district}} officer in the Australian-administered Territory of New Guinea, where he {{died at the age of}} 40, probably of complications from his war wounds. He was buried on Garua Island, New Britain. Considered by many to <b>be</b> <b>rather</b> eccentric, he was also a successful tactician, a skilful organiser, and highly regarded for his treatment of the soldiers under his command.|$|E
5|$|Arena {{was built}} using the multi-threaded library of common code called the W3C Reference Library, now called libwww. Originally, the Arena browser {{was built on}} top of Xlib as Raggett {{considered}} the programming manuals for Motif and other X libraries to <b>be</b> <b>rather</b> daunting.|$|E
5000|$|The spire of the claviform, {{light brown}} shell <b>is</b> <b>rather</b> low, its protoconch large and rather blunt. The whorls <b>are</b> <b>rather</b> convex, lacking an angle or shoulder. The shell is {{sculptured}} overall by raised spiral threads. The body whorl <b>is</b> <b>rather</b> quadrate. The aperture is oblong. The wide siphonal canal <b>is</b> <b>rather</b> short. The columella is straight. The anal sinus is deep and wide.|$|R

Maybe you can't crucify mankind on a cross of gold, but you can sure as hell crucify a statewide {{candidate}} upon a cross of no-gold.|$|E
5|$|The diet of many storm petrels {{species is}} poorly known owing to {{difficulties}} in researching; overall {{the family is}} thought to concentrate on crustaceans. Small fish, oil droplets and molluscs are also taken by many species. Some species are known to <b>be</b> <b>rather</b> more specialised; the grey-backed storm petrel is known {{to concentrate on the}} larvae of goose barnacles.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 9 mm. The forewings <b>are</b> <b>rather</b> dark purple-grey with a cloudy darker {{spot on the}} end of the cell. The hindwings <b>are</b> <b>rather</b> dark bronzy-fuscous.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 16 mm. The forewings <b>are</b> <b>rather</b> light glossy grey with the discal stigmata moderately large, cloudy and dark grey. The hindwings <b>are</b> <b>rather</b> thinly scaled and light grey.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 23-24 mm. The forewings <b>are</b> <b>rather</b> dark purplish-fuscous, strewn throughout {{with fine}} pale ochreous-fuscous strigulae {{and with a}} dark fuscous discal dot at three-fifths. The hindwings <b>are</b> <b>rather</b> dark fuscous.|$|R
5|$|Adders are {{not usually}} aggressive, tending to <b>be</b> <b>rather</b> timid and biting only when cornered or alarmed. People are {{generally}} bitten only after stepping on them or attempting to pick them up. They will usually disappear into the undergrowth at a hint of any danger, but will return once all is quiet, often to the same spot. Occasionally, individual snakes will reveal their presence with a loud and sustained hissing, hoping to warn off potential aggressors. Often, these {{turn out to be}} pregnant females. When the adder is threatened, the front part of the body is drawn into an S-shape to prepare for a strike.|$|E
5|$|In Manhattan, uptown means north (more {{precisely}} north-northeast, {{which is}} the direction the island and its street grid system are oriented) and downtown means south (south-southwest). This usage {{differs from that of}} most American cities, where downtown refers to the central business district. Manhattan has two central business districts, the Financial District at the southern tip of the island, and Midtown Manhattan. The term uptown also refers to the northern part of Manhattan above 72nd Street and downtown to the southern portion below 14th Street, with Midtown covering the area in between, though definitions can <b>be</b> <b>rather</b> fluid depending on the situation.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} the visual dimension, {{distinction}} between aggressive mimicry and camouflage is not always clear. Authors such as Wickler have emphasized {{the significance of the}} signal to its receiver as delineating mimicry from camouflage. However, {{it is not easy to}} assess how 'significant' a signal may be for the dupe, and the distinction between the two can thus <b>be</b> <b>rather</b> fuzzy. Mixed signals may also be employed. Aggressive mimics often have a specific part of the body sending a deceptive signal, with the rest being hidden or camouflaged.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 18 mm. The forewings <b>are</b> <b>rather</b> elongate and pale greyish-ochreous, with some scattered fuscous and blackish specks and markings formed of dense blackish-fuscous irroration. The hindwings <b>are</b> <b>rather</b> dark grey.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 14-16 mm. The forewings are fuscous-grey {{with the}} extreme costal edge whitish anteriorly. The stigmata <b>is</b> <b>rather</b> large, blackish, the plical directly beneath the first discal. The hindwings <b>are</b> <b>rather</b> dark grey.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 16-17 mm. The forewings <b>are</b> <b>rather</b> dark fuscous, {{slightly and}} irregularly whitish-sprinkled {{and with a}} small white discal dot at three-fifths and a dark fuscous terminal line. The hindwings <b>are</b> <b>rather</b> dark fuscous.|$|R
5|$|Despite {{its strong}} sales, Final Fantasy XIII had been criticized on several fronts. Complaints {{included}} {{that the game}} had been too linear, had not allowed enough interaction with non-player characters, and had not featured enough minigames and puzzles. The developers intended to address these criticisms with the sequel by adding the Historia Crux system, numerous sidequests from non-player characters, and the casino minigame area. Environments were made more explorable and the artists were given more freedom to include their own ideas in the game's locations, in order to rectify the shortcomings of the more artificial seeming settings in Final Fantasy XIII. Although the developers were explicitly responding to the criticism, they saw the changes and additions as making the sequel {{in line with what}} players had hoped Final Fantasy XIII would <b>be,</b> <b>rather</b> than backing away from the changes that game had brought to the series. For the structure of side quests and some other aspects such as the abundance of chocobos and the more open environment, the team drew inspiration from Rockstar San Diego's Red Dead Redemption. The game also included multiple endings, which Toriyama referred to as a first for the series.|$|E
5|$|Matilda {{received}} Stephen {{in person}} at her court in Gloucester, before having him moved to Bristol Castle, traditionally used for holding high-status prisoners. Matilda now {{began to take}} the necessary steps to have herself crowned queen in his place, which would require the agreement of the Church and her coronation at Westminster. Stephen's brother Henry summoned a council at Winchester before Easter {{in his capacity as}} papal legate to consider the clergy's view. Matilda had made a private deal with Henry that he would deliver the support of the Church in exchange for being granted control over Church affairs. Henry handed over the royal treasury to her, which proved to <b>be</b> <b>rather</b> depleted except for Stephen's crown, and he excommunicated many of her enemies who refused to switch sides. Archbishop Theobald of Canterbury was unwilling to declare Matilda queen so rapidly, however, and a delegation of clergy and nobles, headed by Theobald, travelled to Bristol to see Stephen, who agreed that, given the situation, he was prepared to release his subjects from their oath of fealty to him.|$|E
5|$|The {{atmospheric}} {{results were}} supplemented by the underground test data accumulated in the 1960s at the Nevada Test Site, {{as it was}} hoped that powerful explosions conducted in confined space might result in improved yields and heavier isotopes. Apart from traditional uranium charges, combinations of uranium with americium and thorium have been tried, as well as a mixed plutonium-neptunium charge. They were less successful in terms of yield that was attributed to stronger losses of heavy isotopes due to enhanced fission rates in heavy-element charges. Isolation of the products was found to <b>be</b> <b>rather</b> problematic, as the explosions were spreading debris through melting and vaporizing rocks under the great depth of 300–600 meters, and drilling to such depth in order to extract the products was both slow and inefficient in terms of collected volumes.|$|E

50|$|Plug's fellow Jūden-chan and rival, {{who becomes}} her supervisor. She <b>is</b> <b>rather</b> serious {{when it comes}} to work and <b>is</b> <b>rather</b> annoyed with how Plug is {{carrying}} out her job. In turn, Plug finds Allesta irritating for interfering with her work and the two girls tend to fight a lot. She sometimes ends up crying, which Plug uses as blackmail material. Compared to Plug, Allesta <b>is</b> <b>rather</b> busty, which causes Plug to tease her about that.|$|R
5|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{history of this}} group is not well documented, but the known fossils allow some preliminary conclusions: the earliest known modern picids were piculet-like forms of the Late Oligocene, about 25 million years ago (mya). By that time, however, the group was already present in the Americas and Europe, and it is hypothesized that they actually evolved much earlier, maybe {{as early as the}} Early Eocene (50 mya). The modern subfamilies appear to <b>be</b> <b>rather</b> young by comparison; until the mid-Miocene (10–15 mya), all picids seem to have been small or mid-sized birds similar to a mixture between a piculet and a wryneck. On the other hand, there exists a feather enclosed in fossil amber from the Dominican Republic, dated to about 25 mya, which seems to indicate that the Nesoctitinae were already a distinct lineage by then.|$|E
5|$|The gadfly petrels in {{the genus}} Pterodroma are seabirds of {{temperate}} and tropical oceans. Many are little-known, and their often similar appearance {{have caused the}} taxonomy of the group to <b>be</b> <b>rather</b> fluid. The forms breeding in Macaronesia on Madeira, Bugio in the Desertas Islands, and in the Cape Verde archipelago were long considered to be subspecies of the Southern Hemisphere soft-plumaged petrel, P. mollis, but mitochondrial DNA analysis, and differences in size, vocalisations, breeding behaviour, showed that the northern birds are not closely related to P. mollis, and that the Bermuda petrel or Cahow may be the closest relative of the Macaronesian birds. Sangster recommended establishing Zino's petrel on Madeira and Fea's petrel on the Desertas and Cape Verde as full species, and the species split was accepted by the Association of European Rarities Committees (AERC) in 2003.|$|E
5|$|A large robotic craft arrives {{searching for}} Finn. When Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada) finally {{encounters}} it, Jake (voiced by John DiMaggio) destroys {{it with his}} fist. Princess Bubblegum (voiced by Hynden Walch) examines the wreckage and discovers its location of origin; this engenders in Finn a desire to discover the craft's creators. Finn thus resolves to travel across the sea from whence the craft came, but before leaving, he tells Fern (voiced by Hayden Ezzy) to stay and look after Ooo for him. Princess Bubblegum, Marceline (voiced by Olivia Olson) and Fern see Finn, Jake and Susan Strong (voiced by Jackie Buscarino) off on their voyage. Initially, the journey is easy and uneventful, but soon, Finn, Jake, and Susan encounter a sea dragon named Whipple (voiced by Josh Fadem), who turns out to <b>be</b> <b>rather</b> annoying. BMO (voiced by Niki Yang), who unbeknownst to the others was stowing away on their boat, angrily tells Whipple off, which causes the sea dragon to summon a storm and destroys their boat. This predicament forces Jake to use his magical powers and take on {{the shape of a}} boat for the rest to ride. Unfortunately, {{below the surface of the}} water, a species of jellyfish latches onto him, which causes Jake to begin hallucinating. Eventually, after much struggle, Finn and Susan are able to remove them, which causes the hallucinations to end. At this point, Jake complains about wanting to return home, but Finn reveals how important this trip is to him. Whipple overhears Finn's lament and begins to feel sorry for his actions; he then uses his powers to blow the group over the dangerous waters.|$|E

5|$|The high-definition upgrade {{was not as}} {{difficult}} as it might have been as all the art assets had been created in high definition and reduced for the PS2 hardware. Other aspects for the visuals, such as character faces, needed to be redrawn by Kamitani as they remained in low definition. There were also graphic elements remade as the team considered them to <b>be</b> <b>rather</b> poor quality when compared to their current work. Added shadow effects were created, but special parameters needed to be set as there were no 3D environments to use as reference. The 2D perspective also meant that the way enemies behaved needed to be adjusted, so they would not attack the player character while still off screen. In general, the overall graphical quality was improved, the resolution was increased, and the aspect ratio was changed from the original 4:3 to 16:9. The shift to 16:9 meant that character models needed to be re-positioned so as not to leave blank spaces {{on either side of the}} central scene. As they needed to analyse the original software to make such changes but had lost the original software used to create the cutscenes, they needed to hurriedly create alternate editing software that ran on a PC. In addition to changes to scenery and model positioning, the text font was resized to match the larger screen and the text bubbles were smoothed out.|$|E
