5|$|The second common parasitoid, Elasmus polistis, {{also has}} {{disastrous}} {{effects on the}} P. exclamans nest. Up to 80 E. polistis will hatch out of a single cell. The males emerge first, and then will exit the nest and wait until the females emerge. Once the female moths emerge, the males will mate and reproduce, quickly destroying the P. exclamans population. In some cases the invading E. polistis will hide larvae in the nest so that the P.exclamans cannot find them. This {{is important to the}} survival of P.exclamans. The hosts will attempt to remove as many parasitoids as possible to prevent them from spreading to nearby nests. This defense mechanism has not been proven to be effective, as more often than not the E. polistis larvae go undetected by the hosts. In one experiment conducted, it was found that over 60% of all nests lost brood to the parasitoids E. polistis or C. iphitalis in 1981. It was also observed that larger satellites have a greater risk of being parasitized. This {{is due to the fact}} that the large nests are typically older. This relationship <b>between</b> <b>age</b> <b>and</b> parasitism can be seen with the fact that older queens’ nests tend to be parasitized more than younger queens’ nests.|$|E

25|$|There {{is clear}} polyethism among A. pallipes where the young workers {{care for the}} larvae and older workers forage and defend the nest. It is {{hypothesized}} that the young workers are delegated {{to stay in the}} nest and care for larvae because it is significantly safer {{within the confines of the}} nest while the older workers are outside being exposed to predation in order to increase life expectancy of the workers. Other activities performed by the older workers include removing larvae from the nest, rubbing gaster on the nest and destroying cells. Intra-cell activities like checking cells, moving gaster and self-grooming were all-indicative of younger workers. Therefore, there is a clear relation <b>between</b> <b>age</b> <b>and</b> function thus implying that A. pallipes displays temporal polyethism behavior.|$|E
25|$|Current {{research}} that has examined the impact of menopause on women’s self-reported sexual satisfaction indicates that 50.3% of women experience some sexual disturbance in one of five domains, and 33.7% experience disturbances {{in two of the}} domains. Of these were desire, orgasm, lubrication, and arousal disturbances. With regards to arousal, they found a significant negative association <b>between</b> <b>age</b> <b>and</b> arousal, in that as women aged {{they were more likely to}} report lower arousal scores. In the desire and orgasm domains, 38% of women reported a disturbances in their desire, and 17% reported a disturbance in their orgasm capabilities; of the 17%, 14% were premenopausal, 15.2% were postmenopausal and taking a form of HRT, and 22% were postmenopausal not on a form of HRT. Eight percent of women reported disturbances lubricating during sexual activity; 14.3% in the premenopausal group, 30% in the postmenopausal group not using a HRT, and 11.7% among those postmenopausal women using HRT. Lastly, 21% of women reported pain as a disturbance in their sexual satisfaction— the premenopausal group at 14.3%, the postmenopausal women using HRT at 13.3% and the group with the highest rates, similarly to the other results, was the postmenopausal women not taking HRT at 34%. This study concluded that there was a significant decline in sexual function related to menopause in the pain and lubrication domains.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the current study}} was to evaluate the interaction effect <b>between</b> <b>aging</b> <b>and</b> a new walkway perturbation training on risk of slip initiation. A new walkway perturbation training program was developed using an instrumented, split-belt treadmill. Five healthy older adults and five younger adults were involved in a laboratory study. An inertial measurement unit was attached to the subject’s low back region to record 3 D acceleration. Transitional acceleration of whole body center of mass (TACOM) was computed to quantify the risk of slip initiation. The results indicated a significant interaction effect <b>between</b> <b>aging</b> <b>and</b> training on TACOM. In conclusion, the walkway perturbation training program successfully reduced the risk of slip initiation for the older adults.

40|$|Abstract AIMSThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} how depressive symptoms mediate different motor control requirements in elderlies and to assess the concurring effects fomented by the interaction <b>between</b> <b>aging</b> <b>and</b> depressive symptoms, providing indirect measures of brain functionality. METHODS Sixty-eight elderlies were paired in terms of <b>age</b> <b>and</b> gender and were equally distributed into depressed and nondepressed groups, according to their score on the Beck Depression Questionnaire. The participants performed the Grooved Pegboard Test placing and withdrawing pegs while execution time and error rate were measured. RESULTS This investigation revealed that depressive symptoms exert a broad effect upon motor control, although that the symptom intensity, as well as the interaction <b>between</b> <b>aging</b> <b>and</b> depression intensity, were exclusively correlated with withdrawal task, suggesting that there is a greater effect upon motor acts with higher frontal lobe requirements. CONCLUSION The discrimination of motor control aspects provides a valuable contribution for the understanding of the underlying neurophysiology of the interaction <b>between</b> <b>aging</b> <b>and</b> depression as it represents an indirect measure of cerebral dysfunction. Further, these findings may still have clinical implications, as they can promote more rational approaches to the elaboration of preventive measures that help maintain the functional capability of depressed elderlies...|$|R
