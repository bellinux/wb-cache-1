500|$|At {{the start}} of the war, nearly 21 million people lived in the North {{compared}} to 9 million in the South. While the North's population was almost entirely white, the South had an enormous number of black slaves and people of color. [...] While the latter were free, becoming a soldier was seen as the prerogative of white men only. Many Southerners were terrified at the idea of a <b>black</b> <b>man</b> <b>with</b> a gun. Excluding old men and boys, the white males available for Confederate service were less than two million. [...] There was also the additional burden that the near four million black slaves had to be heavily policed as there was no trust between the owner and [...] "owned". The North had vastly greater industrial capacity, built nearly all of the locomotives, steamships, and industrial machinery and had a much larger and more integrated railroad system. Nearly all of the munitions facilities were in the North, while critical ingredients for gunpowder were in very short supply in the South.|$|E

As the pages open, the camera zooms to one particular photograph, of her young mother facing a wall, with her back turned. As the picture comes into full view, it turns into actual footage. Her mother turns around in anguish, as her own mother begins shouting at her and calling her a disgrace to the family. This {{is due to the fact}} that she is pregnant with the child of a <b>black</b> <b>man,</b> <b>with</b> whom she wants to move out with.

As she picks it up off the floor, she tells her mother she hates her and leaves in a taxi. From the clothing and scenery, it is notable that the scenes depicted are happening in the late 1960s, prior to Carey's birth. As the song starts playing, the video focuses on Carey, walking down the street in New York City. As she continues singing and walking down the street, the camera aims to the sky, which is darkened with cloud while light starts to peer through.|$|E

Many such disparities derive from limited access to health care, socioeconomic barriers, and cultural differences—each of which can result in minorities receiving suboptimal care, and ulti-mately in inferior outcomes. Recently published SEER data again underscore the undeniable disparities in cancer outcomes across eth-nic groups. 1 a Understanding the drivers of these disparities is relevant for all subpopulations, but for <b>black</b> <b>men</b> <b>with</b> prostate cancer, this is especially true, as there are specific action items of timely importance. <b>Black</b> <b>men</b> <b>with</b> prostate cancer have a 2. 5 -fold greater risk of lethal prostate cancer compared <b>with</b> white <b>men.</b> 1 a Hispanic <b>men</b> <b>with</b> prostate cancer have demonstrated increased incidence rates and als...|$|R
40|$|Objectives. I {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that <b>Black</b> <b>men</b> <b>with</b> high levels of distrust (i. e., mild paranoia) {{are at greater risk}} of hospitalization for mental health problems than their White counterparts. Methods. Secondary analysis was conducted of data from a subsample of 180 men in an epidemiological study. Mental health hospitalization was the outcome and ethnicity/ race, mild paranoia, and their interaction were main predictors in a logistic regression analysis. The ethnicity/race by mild paranoia interaction tested the study hypothesis. Results. The ethnicity/race by mild paranoia interaction was statistically significant. Contrary to the hypothesis, <b>Black</b> <b>men</b> <b>with</b> mild paranoia {{were less likely to be}} hospitalized. Conclusions. Black men’s lack of trust regarding the mental health system may cause them not to seek services. Factors critical to increasing their trust are acknowledgment of racial biases in the mental health system and sincere efforts to eliminate racial disparities in mental health treatment...|$|R

40|$|Background. Androgen {{deprivation}} therapy (ADT) {{for prostate}} cancer (PCa) is associated with weakness, fatigue, sar-copenia, and reduced quality of life (QoL). <b>Black</b> <b>men</b> have a higher incidence and mortality from PCa than Caucasians. We hypothesized that despite ADT, strength training (ST) would increase muscle power and size, thereby improving body composition, physical function, fatigue levels, and QoL in older <b>black</b> <b>men</b> <b>with</b> PCa. Methods. Muscle mass, power, strength, endurance, physical function, fatigue perception, and QoL were measured in 17 <b>black</b> <b>men</b> <b>with</b> PCa on ADT before and after 12 weeks of ST. Within-group differences were determined using t tests and regression models. Results. ST significantly increased total body muscle mass (2. 7 %), thigh muscle volume (6. 4 %), power (17 %), and strength (28 %). There were significant increases in functional performance (20 %), muscle endurance (110 %), and QoL scores (7 %) and decreases in fatigue perception (38 %).

40|$|Studies {{have shown}} that men tend to neglect matters {{relating}} to their health. Men also suffer from health related conditions like cancer and yet men are generally more likely than women to ignore health related matters, or are reluctant to visit health care facilities like clinics and hospitals to seek medical assistance until symptoms become very pronounced. Cancer {{is one of the}} major killers both in developed and developing countries, including South Africa. Recent statistics indicate that <b>black</b> <b>men</b> are at increased risk of prostate cancer and often develop an aggressive type of prostate cancer (CANSA, n. d. : 14). Living with prostate cancer is a huge challenge for <b>black</b> <b>men,</b> because is a health condition that is accompanied by life-threatening experiences which include psychological, physical, social and biological challenges. The perception that prostate cancer is relatively rare among <b>black</b> <b>men</b> is incorrect, as the condition means a dramatic change of a man s life and puts a huge burden on their partners. It continues to present with several enduring challenges that continue to defy solution despite extensive research. Several studies of prostate cancer have been conducted worldwide, so literature on <b>men</b> <b>with</b> prostate cancer is extensive. Despite this there are still gaps, such as experiences of <b>black</b> <b>men</b> <b>with</b> prostate cancer in South Africa. It is therefore the researcher s conviction that specific research on <b>black</b> <b>men</b> living <b>with</b> prostate cancer in the South African context is scarce. The goal of this study was to explore and describe the bio-psychosocial experiences of <b>black</b> <b>men</b> living <b>with</b> prostate cancer. The researcher conducted the study using a qualitative approach, with face-to-face, semi-structured interviews <b>with</b> 10 <b>black</b> <b>men</b> from the Pretoria Urology Hospital. The researcher used purposive sampling to select the participants. The study findings revealed that experiences of <b>black</b> <b>men</b> <b>with</b> prostate cancer are more serious than expected. The aftermath of this condition is characterised by various elements such as fear, stigma, shame, loneliness, status, loss, pain, embarrassment, non-disclosure, cultural barriers, patriarchy, as well as communication barriers with significant others about their real feelings. The issue of communication with their partners about the impact of the condition on their sexual life appeared to be a serious concern with most of the participants. Furthermore, prostate cancer is still perceived as a very personal matter that is kept secret among <b>black</b> <b>men.</b> In addition, lack of support groups as well as failure to utilise the resources because of non-disclosure and a feeling of embarrassment among <b>black</b> <b>men</b> is still a huge problem. The study concludes that living with prostate cancer as a <b>black</b> <b>man</b> is characterised by a complex combination of social, cultural, psychological, biological and physical challenges, which continue to have an impact in the lives of <b>black</b> <b>men.</b> Recommendations from the study include encouraging <b>black</b> <b>men</b> to participate in voluntary screening, and intensifying the campaigns to deal with the issue of cultural beliefs and lifestyles, as well as the value of early diagnosis. Comprehensive prostate cancer education to address the lack of knowledge and emphasise the resources available for the survivors is also recommended. Furthermore, future research on the following issues is recommended: firstly challenges encountered by partners of <b>black</b> <b>men</b> living <b>with</b> prostate cancer and, secondly, how the cultural practices of the current era impact the health decisions of <b>black</b> <b>men.</b> Mini Dissertation (MSW) [...] University of Pretoria, 2016. tm 2016 Social Work and CriminologyMSWUnrestricte...|$|R
