5|$|They were {{captured}} by the 4th Company, 2nd Battalion, 206th Mechanized Infantry Regiment of the NK 105th Armored Division. The North Korean troops marched their prisoners down the hill after taking their weapons and valuables. In a nearby orchard, they tied the prisoners' hands <b>behind</b> <b>their</b> <b>backs,</b> took some of their clothing and removed their shoes. They told the American POWs {{that they would be}} sent to the prisoner-of-war camp in Seoul if they behaved well.|$|E
5|$|The {{soldiers}} {{arrived at}} the church and promptly arrested the brothers, tying them with their hands <b>behind</b> <b>their</b> <b>backs.</b> After the arrest, Nhung and Major Dương Hiếu Nghĩa sat with Diệm and Nhu inside the APC, and the convoy departed for Tân Sơn Nhứt. They stopped at a railroad crossing on the return trip where, by all accounts, the brothers were assassinated. An investigation by Đôn later determined that Nghĩa had shot the brothers at point-blank range with a semi-automatic firearm and that Nhung sprayed them with bullets before repeatedly stabbing their bodies with a knife.|$|E
5|$|After Mayor Quimby {{makes an}} {{offensive}} joke about France, {{and refuses to}} apologize, the French president launches a neutron bomb directly into Springfield, killing everyone except Homer, who had been inspecting a bomb shelter he was considering buying from Herman's military surplus store. After the blast, Homer emerges from the shelter {{and seems to be}} the only person in town to survive the blast, but he is soon confronted by a band of hostile Springfield citizens who have become mutants. Homer flees back home where he discovers that his family survived the blast because their house was protected by its layers of lead paint. Marge and the children kill the mutants with shotguns that they were hiding <b>behind</b> <b>their</b> <b>backs</b> and the family head off to steal some Ferraris.|$|E

5|$|The U.S. {{air strike}} and {{artillery}} bombardment pushed North Korean forces off the hill. After the strike, at 15:30, the infantry attacked {{up the hill}} unopposed and secured it by 16:30. The combined strength of E and F Companies on the hill was about 60 men. The artillery and the air strike killed and wounded an estimated 500 enemy troops on Hill 303, with survivors fleeing in complete disorder. Two of the massacre survivors making {{their way down the}} hill to meet the counterattacking force were fired upon before they could establish their identity, but not hit. American forces of the 5th Cavalry Regiment quickly discovered the bodies of the American prisoners with machine-gun wounds, hands still bound <b>behind</b> <b>their</b> <b>backs.</b>|$|E
5|$|The total {{incompetence}} of the D.C. {{government in}} Washington, DC, {{has become an}} embarrassment to our entire Nation. This experiment in home rule is a disaster. All of us who serve in this Chamber, well over 95% of us, have held other positions in government. We have been mayors. We have been township trustees, State legislators, and the rest. I am convinced, Mr. Speaker, that there are well over 2,000 township trustees in my congressional district who with one arm tied <b>behind</b> <b>their</b> <b>backs,</b> could blindfolded {{do a better job}} of directing this city than the city council of D.C. It is high time that this experiment in home rule that has proven to be a disaster for our nation be terminated, that we return to some sort of logical government whereby the rest of us can function in this city.|$|E
5|$|Two-hundred fifty of Task Force Smith's {{force had}} {{returned}} to the American lines before nightfall, with about 150 more of the force killed, wounded or missing. Most of the other stragglers found their way into the American lines over the next several days. The last stragglers from 2nd Platoon, B Company, reached Chonan five days later, only 30 minutes ahead of the North Korean army. Upon the initial count, Task Force Smith suffered 20 killed in action, 130 wounded in action or missing in action, and around 36 captured. After {{the end of the war}} this figure was revised to 60 dead, 21 wounded and 82 captured, 32 of whom died in captivity. This casualty count accounted for 40 percent of Task Force Smith. U.S. troops advancing northward during the Pusan breakout offensive would later discover a series of shallow graves containing the bodies of several soldiers of the 24th Infantry Division. All had been shot in the back of the head, their hands bound <b>behind</b> <b>their</b> <b>backs</b> with communications wire. North Korean casualties were approximately 42 dead and 85 wounded, with four tanks destroyed or immobilized. The North Korean advance was delayed approximately seven hours.|$|E

25|$|For {{a number}} of hours, the gunmen hunted {{door-to-door}} for foreigners. They dragged people from their hiding places, beating some who did not cooperate, and shooting others {{as they tried to}} run away. Some foreigners had their hands bound <b>behind</b> <b>their</b> <b>backs,</b> and some had their mouths taped. The gunmen affixed bombs to some of the captives. Some foreigners were helped by local Algerians, who helped them hide.|$|E

25|$|Hundreds {{of local}} people, mostly young men, were arrested. They {{were made to}} take off their shirts and lie on the ground.

25|$|In October 2010 the Global Tamil Forum (GTF), an {{umbrella}} group for Tamil diaspora groups, published photographs {{that appeared to}} show the massacre of civilians and execution of Tamil Tigers.

It had obtained them from a Tamil Tiger intelligence official who said they had obtained the photos from someone in the Sri Lankan Army. The Sri Lankan government rejected the photos as an attempt to tarnish Sri Lanka's image.|$|E
25|$|According to Ronald Rychlak {{the clergy}} prisoners were treated {{marginally}} {{better than other}} prisoners, however treatment worsened {{in the wake of}} Papal or episcopal announcements critical of the Nazi regime, such as Pope Pius XII's 1942 Christmas address. One Easter, the guards marked Good Friday by torturing 60 priests. Tying their hands <b>behind</b> <b>their</b> <b>backs,</b> chaining their wrists, and hoisting them up by the chains – tearing joints apart and killing and disabling several of the priests. The threat of further torture was used to keep the priests obedient. Food was so lacking, that prisoners would retrieve scraps from the compost pile.|$|E

50|$|During {{the same}} time period in Hawaii, there were the unsolved killings of at least nine women on Oahu. The deaths of Lisa Au, Regina Sakamoto, and others all over the island.

However, Suzuki's disappearance did not fit that profile.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{way to look}} at teasing is as {{an honest}} {{reflection}} on differences, expressed in a joking fashion with the goal of [...] "clearing the air". It can express a comfort with the other which can be comforting. As opposed to being nice to someone's face while making disparaging remarks <b>behind</b> <b>their</b> <b>back,</b> teasing can be a way to express differences in a direct fashion rather than internalizing them.|$|R
25|$|The {{people of}} Dapeng, {{influenced}} by both Shang {{as well as}} local traditions, probably practised human sacrifice. At Qiuwan a sacrificial altar was found, consisting of a one meter high natural stone, surrounded by three large, erected stones. Around these stones, 22 human and 10 dog skeletons were found; most humans were executed by blows to the head. Twenty were then buried in a crouched position, the head to the ground with their arms tied <b>behind</b> <b>their</b> <b>backs.</b> The other two were only represented by their skulls. The remains dated from 1400–1000 BC, indicating that the site was used for a long time.|$|E
25|$|The bird the {{children}} have found has died, and {{the children}}, assisted by the adults, hold a funeral for it. Virginia is aware that she {{and the little girl}} are far more invested in the funeral than Vanessa's boys, who are probably laughing at the females <b>behind</b> <b>their</b> <b>backs.</b> As Virginia stares longingly at the dead bird she has an epiphany: her character, Clarissa Dalloway, is not like Virginia, and would not commit suicide. Like the bird's funeral bed, Clarissa represents -to Virginia- an uncaring, even foolish thing. As such, Clarissa will represent the death bed (the counterpoint) to the character who Virginia will have commit suicide.|$|E
25|$|For example, on 14 July 1995, prisoners from Bratunac were bussed northward to {{a school}} {{in the village of}} Pilica, north of Zvornik.

On 16 July 1995, following a now familiar pattern, the men were called out of the school and loaded onto buses with their hands tied <b>behind</b> <b>their</b> <b>backs.</b> They were then driven to the Branjevo Military Farm, where groups of 10 were lined up and shot systematically.|$|E
