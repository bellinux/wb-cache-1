40|$|BACKGROUND: Malignant pleural {{effusion}} {{is associated with}} short life expectancy and significant morbidity. A randomized controlled trial comparing indwelling pleural catheters (IPCs) with talc pleurodesis found that IPCs reduced in-hospital time {{and the need for}} additional procedures but were associated with excess adverse events. METHODS: Using data from the clinical trial, we compared costs associated with use of IPCs and with talc pleurodesis. Resource use and adverse events were captured through case report forms over the 1 -year trial follow-up. Costs for outpatient and inpatient visits, diagnostic imaging, nursing, and doctor time were obtained from the UK National Health Service reference costs and University of Kent's Unit Costs of Health and Social Care 2011 and inflated to 2013 using the UK Consumer Price Index. Procedure supply costs were obtained from the manufacturer. Difference in mean costs was compared using nonparametric bootstrapping. All costs were converted to US dollars using the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Purchasing Power Parity Index. RESULTS: Overall mean cost (SD) for managing patients with IPCs and talc pleurodesis was $ 4, 993 ($ 5, 529) and $ 4, 581 ($ 4, 359), respectively. The incremental mean cost difference was $ 401, with 95 % CI of -$ 1, 387 to $ 2, 261. The mean cost related to ongoing drainage in the IPC group was $ 1, 011 ($ 732) vs $ 57 ($ 213) in the talc pleurodesis group (P =. 001). This included the cost of drainage <b>bottles,</b> <b>dressing</b> changes in the first month, and catheter removal. There {{was no significant difference in}} cost of the initial intervention or adverse events between the groups. For patients with survival < 14 weeks, IPC is significantly less costly than talc pleurodesis, with mean cost difference of -$ 1, 719 (95 % CI, -$ 3, 376 to -$ 85). CONCLUSIONS: There is no significant difference in the mean cost of managing patients with IPCs compared with talc pleurodesis. For patients with limited survival, IPC appears less costly.

5000|$|In March 2009, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, in a {{unanimous}} panel opinion written by Judge Richard Posner found that Sorensen engaged in prosecutorial misconduct and made [...] "a series of improper statements" [...] {{in the trial}} court case of U.S. v. Farinella, which was appealed as 558 F.3d 695.A jury had found a Chicago businessman guilty of fraud and misbranding for relabeling 1.6 million <b>bottles</b> of salad <b>dressing</b> to extend their “best when purchased by” date, then reselling the bottles.Judge Posner found that relabeling “best when purchased by” dates was not a crime, but that Sorensen's improper argument would have required reversal in any case.|$|R
5|$|A further {{tour of the}} US {{was planned}} for December 1976, {{but it had to}} be {{cancelled}} when, on 23 November, Brian Robertson suffered a hand injury when trying to protect fellow Glaswegian, singer and friend Frankie Miller in a fracas at the Speakeasy Club in London. Miller had been jamming onstage with the reggae band Gonzalez, but had been drunk, offending Gonzalez guitarist Gordon Hunte. Hunte attacked Miller with a <b>bottle</b> in the <b>dressing</b> room, and Robertson intervened, suffering artery and nerve damage to his hand. Robertson subsequently broke Hunte's leg, broke the collarbone of another man, and headbutted another, before being hit on the head with a bottle, rendering him unconscious.|$|R
5000|$|Williams owed his {{nomination}} for governor to a deadlocked Democratic convention {{and he ran}} against future Republican President Benjamin Harrison and Greenback candidate Anson Wolcott. The campaign focused predominantly on federal financial positions that had caused a financial downturn. Williams changed {{his position on the}} Greenback movement, and came out against the inflationary practices. But the campaign was also centered around personality, and there Williams had a tremendous advantage. [...] "Blue Jeans Williams would never think that it was necessary to set about his day's work with his hair parted in the middle and his beard trimmed like a row of tree box," [...] a reporter gibed; [...] "the other emerges from his toilet with the appearance of one who used considerably the hairbrush and the oil <b>bottle.</b> Harrison <b>dresses</b> in Broadway fashion; Williams in 'blue jeans.' Harrison is a smart lawyer, to whom Governor Hendricks gave the best part of his practice. Williams is an honest old farmer, who has earned every cent he owns by the sweat of his brow. Harrison is a cold, reserved, chicken-broth order of man. Williams is an open, warm-hearted, horny-handed farmer, with broad acres to which he can point as the result of long years of patient struggling with nature." [...] Williams won in a close election by about 5,000 votes. Williams became the only person whose primary source of income came from farming to be elected Governor of Indiana. He was inaugurated on January 9, 1877.|$|R
30|$|The video-assisted {{evaluation}} {{consisted of}} seven basic {{tasks that are}} frequently used in daily activities: writing, drinking, eating, combing hair, moving an object from one point to another, moving an object from one hand to the other and, finally, one complex gesture (opening a <b>bottle,</b> tying shoelaces, <b>dressing,</b> doing up a button) to assess two-hand coordination. The patients were filmed in two different conditions: (a) on request of the examiner and (b) in real-life conditions {{with the use of}} a hidden camera. During the test in real-life conditions, the child was sitting in a playing room and ignored that he was being filmed. He/she was allocated to different stands by his/her parents. On the first table, various colouring books with markers were disposed for the assessment of writing. On the second table, the parents role played a dinner party to assess drinking and eating and moving objects. Finally, on the third table, dressing and styling accessories were arranged for the evaluation of the remaining activities. The surgeon stood behind and filmed the hand movements using a hidden camera. Each condition (on request and on hidden camera) took 15 – 30  min.|$|R
