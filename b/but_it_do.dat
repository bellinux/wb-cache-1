Main parameters in the test are magnitude and loading time of axial force. As a result, it was found that there was no effect on the flexural strength according to the timing of compression and axial force. The flexural strength of the composite beam subjected to both a constant axial compression and increasing vertical load could be predicted with somewhat safety by using code equations...|$|E
40|$|The {{process of}} {{demographic}} changes in Serbia {{is followed by}} discussions {{on the need to}} provide safety at old age and solve the problems of poverty and social exclusion of older citizens. In the current state there are no mechanisms that guarantee an adequate life standard at old age, the consequence of which is a high poverty rate, deteriorating health and limited access to social programs. The results of the Survey on life standard from 2002 and 2007 show that poverty among population in general and pensioners has decreased, while the poverty risk among people older than 65 has increased twice. The restrictive methods of the reforms cause a change in the relation between the pensions and the earnings, so that more and more pensioners receive below average, i. e. minimal pensions. Not all old people are covered by pension insurance so that a significant number (around 400. 000) does not have a safe monthly income at all. The state program of financial aid is of modest size and does not provide help to all of the poor. Welfare aid decreases the risk of poverty, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>do</b> not guarantee an adequate level of material security at old age. The low level of minimal and average pensions, the decline of participation in the average earnings and the strict criteria of the social security system have brought to awareness the necessity of 'social pensions' and various help and support programs for the elderly. ...|$|E

Research on efficacy of medicinal plants, is including the research infrastructure. Herbaceous plants tomentose perennial local name Khouchoobe in Kerman And official Zangoolaei Looleh baric and scientific name Onosma stinosiphon "Traditionally {{in the past as}} a poultice to treat skin, superficial cuts, wounds and acne has been used. Its disinfectant properties {{at the site of the}} wound have been proved. Cutaneous Leishmaniasis is throughout the country as epidemics and endemic. Purpose of this is Effectiveness Comparison between Onosma. This study was to Effect of Onosma stinosiphon Extract on Cutaneous Leishmaniasis in Infected BALB/c mice. Methods: sufficient root of Onosma stinosiphon were minced and they were dissolved in Ethanol 80. Then they were placed into the stirrer with magnets in room temperature for 24 hours. Next, they were softened. This compound was, first, sterilized and prepared as tropica with concentration of 40, 60 and 80 %. It was refrigerated until used. In the lab, 50 BABL/c mice were infected with the parasite Leishmania (L) tropica, They were divided into four control groups and a group that received 40, 60, and 80 % concentration of the extract- Onosma stinosiphon and Honey As soon as the Leishmania lesion appeared, Extract- Onosma stinosiphon was applied every two days. As well, the foot and the size of the lesion were measured the weight was also taken in all mice in the four groups by using ale and coliss every week until the death of the last mouse in the control group. Results: Average weight of mice receiving extracts each other and an average weight of mice of receiving honey with an average weight of control mice showed no significant difference (P> 0. 05). Average diameter ulcer mice receiving extracts each other and an Average diameter ulcer mice receiving honey with an average diameter size of mice control mice showed significant difference (P = 0. 000). Determine the average size of the spleen (mm) and compare survival time (days) in any study group which was not significant (P> 0. 05). Conclusion: topical use of Onosma stinosiphon extract in the treatment of cutaneous Leishmaniasis wounds causes to be the growth slower diameter size and use of topical honey prevention of cause necrosis and creation of secondary bacterial infections are, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>Do</b> not none whole parasite removal from the body...|$|E
40|$|Background World Health Organization has {{committed}} universal health coverage (UHC) in 2005 {{in order to}} protect people from catastrophic health expense. Since 2009, China has invested 850 billion into health care reform and reached the expansion of health insurance coverage, up to 95 % of total population in China. However, it is highly unlikely to find systematic reviews of researches on the financial protection by universal health coverage in China. Therefore, this article intends to focus on the financial effect of urban residents’ basic medical insurance, figure out how URBMI in China health care system affect the household health care expenditure and protect some population from catastrophic health payment. Finally, this article would recommend several measurements which might improve the effectiveness of universal health coverage on financial protection in China health system. Methods The key words, like “financial burden”, “financial risk”, “catastrophic health expense” AND “universal health coverage”, “urban residents’ basic medical insurance” were searched in several databases, including PubMed, China Journal Net, Science Direct and Google Scholar. Both English and Chinese languages were used for searching these studies. The quality evaluation of the studies would be based on the guidelines of Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE). Results Totally 240 articles were identified via the four databases, 198 articles have been excluded because they themselves were literature reviews which concentrated on specific diseases, and were not related to URBMI and financial burden, and not the case studied in China. Through screening and excluding the articles, 6 articles studying on the effect of URBMI in China on financial protection are included in this review. It was found that URBMI has slightly reduced the incidences of catastrophic health expenditure but it has insufficient impact on financial protection. Conclusion Through the systematic review on financial protection from catastrophic health expenditure by URBMI in China, it could be concluded that URBMI has slight effect on reduction of catastrophic health expenditure rate, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>do</b> not significantly make differences in financial protection. Moving towards universal coverage, financial protection could be improved by the expansion of coverage in population, health services and cost sharing. However, due to the low quality of studies and lack of sufficient quantization researches, more studies on the effect of URBMI are required. published_or_final_versionPublic HealthMasterMaster of Public Healt...|$|E

40|$|The {{progress}} {{of medicine and}} of its auxiliary sciences in {{the last fifty years}} has led to an increase in man's average life expectancy and to the aging of the world's population. This same development also entails the danger of manipulation of the human body and of its functions, especially at the very onset of life (generation control), and at its very end (euthanasia). It is to be fea red al so that with the {{progress of}} medicine man may beco me used to thinking that death is no longer an inexorable biological fact, but rather the result of a freely-taken decision (positive or negative euthanasia), so that as a consequence of this new line of thinking euthanasia may become legalised in those countries where the concept of the dignity of human life has been lost. At this stage of the manipulation of man -so characteristic of the modern world- it must be remembered that Natural Law and Morality prohibit euthanasia; they do not, on the other hand, make the use of extraordinary means to keep a person alive obligatory. The criterion which doctors have followed until now in the fight for life can and shoul be applied in the case of young patients, especially those who have suffered accidents or trauma while being in the prime of health. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>do</b> es not seem to be mandatory to use extraordinary means in the case of elderly, chronicalIy ill, or incurable patients. In these cases, common sense and the correct application of moral norms indicate that life should not be prolonged artificially, because this is tantamount to prolonging the agony of the dying or the sufferings of those patients who have entered into the final phases of their illnesses. It is therefore convenient to distinguish between three concepts to this effect. 1). Positive euthanasia means the direct causing of the patient's death. 2). Negative euthanasia can be defined as the refraining from use of effective mean s to cure a patient. 3). We are dealing here with a new concept -the artificial prolongation of life- based on the utilization of mean s which are ineffective as far as curing the patient is concerned, but effective in that they will serve to prolong the patient's life a few days or a few weeks. In this last instance, the decisión corresponds to the patient himself. In the event of the patient's being either unconscious or too weak to be able to decide, then the decision rests upon his direct next-of·kin. The doctor has the right solely to operate within the limits prescribed by the patient, and must not employ any moral coercion with the purpose of having extraordinary means applied...|$|E
