5|$|By the 17th century, two {{developments}} {{allowed for}} the transits of planets {{across the face of}} the Sun to <b>be</b> <b>predicted</b> and observed: the telescope and the new astronomy of Johannes Kepler, which assumed elliptical, rather than circular, planetary orbits.|$|E
5|$|Long term {{forecasts}} {{are made}} {{based on these}} effects. However, they are easily overridden, in winter, by the Arctic oscillation and North Atlantic oscillations, which can only <b>be</b> <b>predicted</b> about two weeks in advance. These can drop the temperature noticeably from seasonal norms.|$|E
5|$|Some comets are predictable, {{most famously}} Halley's Comet. Yet {{as a class}} of object they remain {{unpredictable}} and can appear at any time. Some have extremely lengthy orbital periods which means their past appearances and returns cannot <b>be</b> <b>predicted.</b> Others may have only ever passed through the Solar System once and so are inherently unpredictable.|$|E

50|$|The {{secondary}} structure of FAM40A <b>is</b> <b>predicted</b> to contain twenty-six alpha helices and two beta sheets. The 5' untranslated region of FAM40A <b>is</b> <b>predicted</b> to contain one stem-loop and the 3' untranslated region <b>is</b> <b>predicted</b> to contain eight stem-loop structures. Two miRNAs <b>are</b> <b>predicted</b> to bind {{to two of}} the stem-loop structures present in the 3' UTR region.|$|R
5000|$|Many {{phosphorylation}} sites <b>are</b> <b>predicted</b> for the ERICH2 protein. Interestingly, none <b>are</b> <b>predicted</b> on tyrosines only on serines and the threonines. There <b>is</b> also a <b>predicted</b> acetylation site at the N-terminus of the protein, specifically it <b>is</b> <b>predicted</b> on {{the third}} amino acid. Many SOX/SRY-sex/testis determining and related HMG box factor transcription factors and estrogen related transcription factors <b>are</b> <b>predicted</b> to bind and regulate transcription of ERICH2.|$|R
5|$|The ease of {{maintaining}} these birds in captivity {{has made them}} popular for studying behavior and physiology. Feeding behavior can <b>be</b> <b>predicted</b> by the optimal foraging theory, where animals minimize time and energy spent to maximize food intake. This theory has been tested by studying the strategies used by scaly-breasted munias to increase their feeding efficacy.|$|E
5|$|Weather {{forecasting}} of wind, precipitations {{and humidity}} {{is essential for}} preventing and controlling wildfires. Different indices, like the Forest fire weather index and the Haines Index, {{have been developed to}} predict the areas more at risk to experience fire from natural or human causes. Conditions for the development of harmful insects can <b>be</b> <b>predicted</b> by forecasting the evolution of weather, too.|$|E
5|$|Although all {{elements}} up to oganesson have been discovered, {{of the elements}} above hassium (element 108), only copernicium (element 112), nihonium (element 113), and flerovium (element 114) have known chemical properties, and only for the copernicium is there enough evidence for a conclusive categorisation at present. The other elements may behave differently from what would <b>be</b> <b>predicted</b> by extrapolation, due to relativistic effects; for example, flerovium has been predicted to possibly exhibit some noble-gas-like properties, {{even though it is}} currently placed in the carbon group. More recent experiments have suggested, however, that flerovium behaves chemically like lead, as expected from its periodic table position.|$|E
50|$|No conserved glycolation sites <b>are</b> <b>predicted</b> {{within the}} mature DEPDC1B protein product. No signal peptide or transmembrane domains <b>are</b> <b>predicted</b> within human or any {{ortholog}} protein. No prenylation sites <b>are</b> <b>predicted</b> in any DEPDC1B orthologs.|$|R
50|$|The {{physical}} {{properties of the}} c10orf35 protein were analyzed, and the molecular weight <b>was</b> <b>predicted</b> to <b>be</b> 13.2 kdal, and the isoelectric point <b>was</b> <b>predicted</b> to <b>be</b> 11.5. The properties of DUF4605 were also analyzed, and the molecular weight <b>was</b> <b>predicted</b> to <b>be</b> 6.0 kdal. The isoelectric point <b>was</b> <b>predicted</b> to <b>be</b> 6.9, which is significantly less basic than the full protein.|$|R
50|$|Only MXenes without surface {{terminations}} <b>are</b> <b>predicted</b> to <b>be</b> magnetic. Cr2C, Cr2N, and Ta3C2 <b>are</b> <b>predicted</b> to <b>be</b> ferromagnetic; Ti3C2 and Ti3N2 <b>are</b> <b>predicted</b> to <b>be</b> anti-ferromagnetic. None {{of these}} magnetic properties {{have not been}} demonstrated experimentally yet.|$|R
5|$|At Princeton University, Henry Norris Russell was {{following}} a similar course of research. He was studying {{the relationship between}} the spectral classification of stars and their actual brightness as corrected for distance—their absolute magnitude. For this purpose he used a set of stars that had reliable parallaxes and many of which had been categorized at Harvard. When he plotted the spectral types of these stars against their absolute magnitude, he found that dwarf stars followed a distinct relationship. This allowed the real brightness of a dwarf star to <b>be</b> <b>predicted</b> with reasonable accuracy.|$|E
5|$|Because {{scratches}} {{dominate the}} microwear {{texture of the}} teeth, Williams et al. suggested Edmontosaurus was a grazer instead of a browser, which would <b>be</b> <b>predicted</b> to have fewer scratches due to eating less abrasive materials. Candidates for ingested abrasives include silica-rich plants like horsetails and soil that was accidentally ingested due to feeding at ground level. The tooth structure indicates combined slicing and grinding capabilities.|$|E
5|$|In the thelytokous ant Platythyrea punctata, colonies are clonal; therefore, {{workers are}} all equally related genetically, and worker {{policing}} {{is not expected}} {{as there is no}} genetic conflict. However, one would expect severe effects on the condition of the colony if reproductive workers were left unchecked. For example, more time spent on individual reproduction would <b>be</b> <b>predicted</b> to detract from care of the queen's offspring. In studies of these ants, workers did actually display worker policing, as evidenced by increased aggression towards reproductive workers. Worker policing here is favored for group efficiency.|$|E
50|$|The protein <b>is</b> <b>predicted</b> to <b>be</b> post-translationally {{modified}} by phosphorylation and glycosylation. The protein <b>is</b> <b>predicted</b> to have four transmembrane domains {{in the nuclear}} membrane. The structure of the protein <b>is</b> <b>predicted</b> to <b>be</b> helical in the transmembrane domains. Disulfide bonds <b>are</b> <b>predicted</b> to <b>be</b> found in the region in between transmembrane domains 3 and 4, which indicates that this particular region {{is located in the}} nucleoplasm.|$|R
5000|$|A {{total of}} 22 exons exist within the gene.5 From these exons, there are 13 {{transcript}} variants. 12 of these transcript variants <b>are</b> <b>predicted,</b> {{and only a}} further 7 of these <b>are</b> <b>predicted</b> to encode a protein. Furthermore, they <b>are</b> <b>predicted</b> to encode the same protein.|$|R
50|$|The {{secondary}} structure <b>is</b> <b>predicted</b> to contain alternating sets of alpha helicies and beta strands. No helix-turn-helix (HTH) regions <b>were</b> <b>predicted.</b>|$|R
5|$|Since photons {{contribute}} to the stress–energy tensor, they exert a gravitational attraction on other objects, according {{to the theory of}} general relativity. Conversely, photons are themselves affected by gravity; their normally straight trajectories may be bent by warped spacetime, as in gravitational lensing, and their frequencies may be lowered by moving to a higher gravitational potential, as in the Pound–Rebka experiment. However, these effects are not specific to photons; exactly the same effects would <b>be</b> <b>predicted</b> for classical electromagnetic waves.|$|E
5|$|Enzymes are {{generally}} globular proteins, acting {{alone or in}} larger complexes. The sequence of the amino acids specifies the structure which in turn determines the catalytic activity of the enzyme. Although structure determines function, a novel enzymatic activity cannot yet <b>be</b> <b>predicted</b> from structure alone. Enzyme structures unfold (denature) when heated or exposed to chemical denaturants and this disruption to the structure typically causes a loss of activity. Enzyme denaturation is normally linked to temperatures above a species' normal level; as a result, enzymes from bacteria living in volcanic environments such as hot springs are prized by industrial users {{for their ability to}} function at high temperatures, allowing enzyme-catalysed reactions to be operated at a very high rate.|$|E
5|$|In {{most species}} the sexes are separate, {{but all the}} {{freshwater}} species are hermaphroditic. Nemerteans often have numerous temporary gonads (ovaries or testes), and build temporary gonoducts (ducts from which the ova or sperm are emitted), one per gonad, when the ova and sperm are ready. The eggs are generally fertilised externally. Some species shed them into the water, and others protect their eggs in various ways. The fertilized egg divides by spiral cleavage and grows by determinate development, in which {{the fate of a}} cell can usually <b>be</b> <b>predicted</b> from its predecessors in the process of division. The embryos of most taxa develop either directly to form juveniles (like the adult but smaller) or to form planuliform larvae, in which the larva's long axis {{is the same as the}} juvenile's. However, some form a pilidium larva, in which the developing juvenile has a gut which lies across the larva's body, and usually eats the remains of the larva when it emerges. The bodies of some species fragment readily, and even parts near the tail can grow full bodies.|$|E

50|$|Cu+Ne2 <b>is</b> <b>predicted</b> to <b>be</b> linear. Cu+Ne3 <b>is</b> <b>predicted</b> to <b>be</b> planar T shaped with an Ne-Cu-Ne {{angle of}} 91°. Cu+Ne4 <b>is</b> <b>predicted</b> to <b>be</b> square planar (not tetrahedral) with D4h symmetry. For alkali and {{alkaline}} earth metals the M+Ne4 cluster is tetrahedral. Cu+Ne5 <b>is</b> <b>predicted</b> {{to have a}} square pyramid shape. Cu+Ne6 has a seriously distroted octahedral shape. Cu+Ne12 has an icosahedral shape. Anything beyond that is less stable, with extra neon atoms having to make an extra shell of atoms around an icosahedral core.|$|R
5|$|Kepler's laws of {{planetary}} motion describe {{the orbits of}} objects about the Sun. Following Kepler's laws, each object travels along an ellipse with the Sun at one focus. Objects closer to the Sun (with smaller semi-major axes) travel more quickly {{because they are more}} affected by the Sun's gravity. On an elliptical orbit, a body's distance from the Sun varies over the course of its year. A body's closest approach to the Sun is called its perihelion, whereas its most distant point from the Sun is called its aphelion. The orbits of the planets are nearly circular, but many comets, asteroids, and Kuiper belt objects follow highly elliptical orbits. The positions of the bodies in the Solar System can <b>be</b> <b>predicted</b> using numerical models.|$|E
5|$|Larger bodied {{specimens}} of Dimetrodon have larger sails {{relative to their}} size, an example of positive allometry. Positive allometry may benefit thermoregulation because it means that, as individuals get larger, surface area increases faster than mass. Larger-bodied animals generate {{a great deal of}} heat through metabolism, and the amount of heat that must be dissipated from the body surface is significantly greater than what must be dissipated by smaller-bodied animals. Effective heat dissipation can <b>be</b> <b>predicted</b> across many different animals with a single relationship between mass and surface area. However, a 2010 study of allometry in Dimetrodon found a different relationship between its sail and body mass: the actual scaling exponent of the sail was much larger than the exponent expected in an animal adapted to heat dissipation. The researchers concluded that the sail of Dimetrodon grew at a much faster rate than was necessary for thermoregulation, and suggested that sexual selection was the primary reason for its evolution.|$|E
5|$|Next {{studies of}} the {{chemistry}} of dubnium were reported over a decade later, in 1988. Studies at Berkeley examined whether the most stable oxidation state of dubnium in aqueous solution was +5. Dubnium was fumed twice and washed with concentrated nitric acid; then, its sorption of dubnium on glass cover slips was {{compared with that of}} tracers of the group 5 elements niobium and tantalum and the group 4 elements zirconium and hafnium produced on‐line under similar conditions. The group 5 elements are known to sorb on glass surfaces while the group 4 elements do not. Dubnium was confirmed as a group 5 member. However, it was surprising that behavior on extraction from mixed nitric acid/hydrofluoric acid solution into methyl isobutyl ketones differed between dubnium, tantalum, and niobium. Dubnium did not extract and its behavior resembled niobium more closely than tantalum, indicating that details of complexing behavior could not <b>be</b> <b>predicted</b> based only on simple extrapolations of trends within a group in the periodic table.|$|E
50|$|FBO <b>is</b> <b>predicted</b> to <b>be</b> able {{to insert}} noble gas atoms between the {{fluorine}} and boron atom yielding FArBO, FKrBO and FXeBO. The molecules <b>are</b> <b>predicted</b> to <b>be</b> linear.|$|R

5000|$|Coiled-coils <b>are</b> <b>predicted</b> to span from residue 130-160 and 200-260. [...] The {{secondary}} composition <b>was</b> <b>predicted</b> to <b>be</b> about 60% random coils, 30% alpha helices and 10% beta sheets.|$|R
5|$|The chief {{questions}} raised by Kulakov were that the claimed alpha decay energy of sergenium was many orders of magnitude lower than expected and the half-life given was eight orders of magnitude shorter than what would <b>be</b> <b>predicted</b> for a nuclide alpha decaying with the claimed decay energy, {{but at the same}} time a corrected half-life in the region of 1016years would be impossible as it would imply that the samples contained about 100milligrams of sergenium. In 2003 it was suggested that the observed alpha decay with energy 4.5MeV could be due to a low-energy and strongly enhanced transition between different hyperdeformed states of a hassium isotope around 271Hs, thus suggesting that the existence of superheavy elements in nature was at least possible, although unlikely.|$|E
5|$|Waves are {{disturbances}} {{that carry}} energy as they move. Mechanical waves propagate through a medium – air or water, making it oscillate {{as they pass}} by. Wind waves are sea surface waves that create the characteristic chaotic pattern of any large body of water, though their statistical behaviour can <b>be</b> <b>predicted</b> with wind wave models. As waves in water or wind pass over sand, they create patterns of ripples. When winds blow over large bodies of sand, they create dunes, sometimes in extensive dune fields as in the Taklamakan desert. Dunes may form a range of patterns including crescents, very long straight lines, stars, domes, parabolas, and longitudinal or seif ('sword') shapes.|$|E

40|$|Predictions of alpha heating in L-mode and H-mode DT plasmas in ITER are {{generated}} using the PTRANSP code. The baseline toroidal field of 5. 3 T, plasma current ramped to 15 MA and a flat {{electron density profile}} ramped to Greenwald fraction 0. 85 are assumed. Various combinations of external heating by negative ion neutral beam injection, ion cyclotron resonance, and electron cyclotron resonance are assumed to start half-way up the density ramp. The time evolution of plasma temperatures and, for some cases, toroidal rotation <b>are</b> <b>predicted</b> assuming GLF 23 and boundary parameters. Significant toroidal rotation and flow-shearing rates <b>are</b> <b>predicted</b> by GLF 23 even in the L-mode phase with low boundary temperatures, and the alpha heating power <b>is</b> <b>predicted</b> to <b>be</b> significant if the power threshold for the transition to H-mode {{is higher than the}} planned total heating power. The alpha heating <b>is</b> <b>predicted</b> to <b>be</b> 8 - 76 MW in L-mode at full density. External heating mixes with higher beam injection power have higher alpha heating power. Alternatively if the toroidal rotation <b>is</b> <b>predicted</b> assuming that the ratio of the momentum to thermal ion energy conductivity is 0. 5, the flow-shearing rate <b>is</b> <b>predicted</b> to have insignificant effects on the GLF 23 - predicted temperatures, and alpha heating <b>is</b> <b>predicted</b> to <b>be</b> 8 - 20 MW. In H-mode plasmas the alpha heating <b>is</b> <b>predicted</b> to depend sensitively on the assumed pedestal temperatures.
