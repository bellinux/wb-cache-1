500|$|The {{nature of}} the fight with Ryan led to a much {{anticipated}} re-match at Cassiobury Park, Hertfordshire on 11February 1789. At stake was prize money of 600guineas, as well as Johnson's title of champion. Humphries again acted as Johnson's second and a man called Jackson was his <b>bottle-holder.</b> The fight consisted of one round of mutually displayed skill, during which Johnson was felled, and thereafter was brutal passion. Egan described it as [...] It was over in 33 minutes, when Ryan gave up the fight. One spectator, a Mr Hollingsworth, who was a corn factor and had at one time employed Johnson, was so impressed and pleased with how much he had made from betting on Johnson that he settled a £20 per annum gift for life on the fighter.|$|E
500|$|A hiatus in Johnson's boxing career followed, with no challengers {{coming forward}} until the Irish {{champion}} Michael Ryan took an interest. The fight at Wraysbury, then in Buckinghamshire, on either 18 or 19December 1787 saw Richard Humphries ("The Gentleman Boxer") acting as Johnson's second and Daniel Mendoza as his <b>bottle-holder.</b> [...] Ryan was the favourite to win before the fight, {{and he had}} Johnson reeling against the rails of the ring with {{a blow to the}} head after almost 20minutes had elapsed. Humphries' second stepped in to prevent a second strike and this enraged the crowd because they believed Ryan could continue hitting until Johnson fell to the ground. They encouraged Ryan to declare himself victor as a consequence of this foul but he refused, as he wanted to win by means other than a technicality. He allowed Johnson to recover and then, in the space of the next ten minutes, lost the bout.|$|E
60|$|The Mother Society, purged now, by {{successive}} 'scrutinies or epurations,' {{from all}} taint of Girondism, {{has become a}} great Authority: what we can call shield-bearer, or <b>bottle-holder,</b> nay call it fugleman, to the purged National Convention itself. The Jacobins Debates are reported in the Moniteur, like Parliamentary ones.|$|E
5000|$|That {{in picking}} up their men, should the seconds or <b>bottle-holders</b> {{wilfully}} injure the antagonist of their principal, the latter {{shall be deemed}} to have forfeited the battle on {{the decision of the}} referee.|$|R
5000|$|That {{the seconds}} and <b>bottle-holders</b> shall not interfere, advise, or direct the adversary of their principal, and shall refrain from all {{offensive}} and irritating expressions, {{in all respects}} conducting themselves with order and decorum, and confine themselves to the diligent and careful discharge of their duties to their principals.|$|R
5000|$|That at the {{conclusion}} of the round, when one or both of the men shall be down, the seconds and <b>bottle-holders</b> shall step forward and carry or conduct their principal to his corner, there affording him the necessary assistance, and no person whatever be permitted to interfere with this duty.|$|R
6000|$|... "What a licking I shall {{get when}} it's over," [...] young Osborne thought, {{picking up his}} man. [...] "You'd best give in," [...] he said to Dobbin; [...] "it's only a thrashing, Figs, and you know I'm used to it." [...] But Figs, all whose limbs were in a quiver, and whose {{nostrils}} were breathing rage, put his little <b>bottle-holder</b> aside, and went in for a fourth time.|$|E
60|$|As for {{resisting}} {{the law of}} Hawkins, you might as soon think of resisting immortal Jove. Berry and Tolmash, who was to be his <b>bottle-holder,</b> made their appearance immediately, and {{walked out into the}} green where Hawkins was waiting, and, with an irresistible audacity that only belonged to himself, in the face of nature and all the regulations of the place, was smoking a cigar. When Berry and Tolmash found him, the three began slowly pacing {{up and down in the}} sunshine, and we little boys watched them.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, this is {{the devil}} to pay, upon my life!' said Mr. Chickerel, with a miserable gaze at the bundle of clothes and the general {{situation}} at the same time. 'Unfortunately for her friendship, I have snubbed her {{two or three times}} already, for I don't care about her manner. You know she has a way of trading on a man's sense of honour till it puts him into an awkward position. She is perfectly well aware that, whatever scrape I find her out in, I shall not have the conscience to report her, because I am a man, and she is a defenceless woman; and so she takes advantage of one's feeling by making me, or either of the menservants, her <b>bottle-holder,</b> as you see she has done now.' ...|$|E
60|$|Fortunately he was {{adequate}} to performing this operation; and, being powerfully aided by Jenkin Vincent (who was learned {{in all cases}} of broken heads) with plenty of cold water, and a little vinegar, applied according to the scientific method practised by the <b>bottle-holders</b> in a modern ring, the man began to raise himself on his chair, draw his cloak tightly around him, and look about like one who struggles to recover sense and recollection.|$|R
5000|$|That {{the ring}} shall {{be made on}} turf, and shall be four-and-twenty feet square, formed of eight stakes and ropes, the latter {{extending}} in double lines, the uppermost line being four feet from the ground, and the lower two feet from the ground. That in {{the centre of the}} ring a mark be formed, to be termed a scratch; and that at two opposite corners, as may be selected, spaces be enclosed by other marks sufficiently large for the reception of the seconds and <b>bottle-holders,</b> to be entitled “the corners.” ...|$|R
6000|$|The party, {{consisting}} of the Antiquary, his nephew, and the old beggar, now took the sands towards Mussel-crag--the former in the very highest mood of communicating information, and the others, under a sense of former obligation, and some hope for future favours, decently attentive to receive it. The uncle and nephew walked together, the mendicant about a step and a half behind, just near enough for his patron {{to speak to him}} by a slight inclination of his neck, and without the trouble of turning round. (Petrie, in his Essay on Good-breeding, dedicated to the magistrates of Edinburgh, recommends, upon his own experience, as tutor in a family of distinction, this attitude to all led captains, tutors, dependants, and <b>bottle-holders</b> of every description. [...] ) Thus escorted, the Antiquary moved along full of his learning, like a lordly man of war, {{and every now and then}} yawing to starboard and larboard to discharge a broadside upon his followers.|$|R
6000|$|January 27.--A {{great and}} general thaw, the streets afloat, the snow {{descending}} on one's {{head from the}} roofs. Went to the Court. There was little to do. Left about twelve, and took a sitting with Graham, who begs for another. Sir James Stuart stood <b>bottle-holder</b> on this occasion. Had rather an unfavourable account of the pictures of James Stuart of Dunearn, which are to be sold. I had promised to pick up one or two for the Duke of Buccleuch. Came home and wrote a leaf or two. I shall be soon done with the second volume of Anne of Geierstein. I cannot persuade myself to the obvious risk of satisfying the public, although I cannot so well satisfy myself. I am like Beaumont and Fletcher's old Merrythought {{who could not be}} persuaded that there was a chance of his wanting meat. I never came into my parlour, said he, but I found the cloth laid and dinner ready; surely it will be always thus. Use makes perfectness.[245] ...|$|E
6000|$|One of Majesty's first acts was {{to appoint}} him Finance-Minister; [4th May, 1713: Preuss, i. 349. n.] {{and there he}} {{continued}} steady, not to be overset by little flaws of wind like this of the Spectre-Scullion's raising. It is certain he did, himself, become rich; and helped well to make his Majesty so. We are to fancy him his Majesty's <b>bottle-holder</b> in that battle with the Finance Nightmares and Imbroglios, when so much had to be subjugated, and drilled into step, in that department. Evidently a long-headed cunning fellow, much of the Grumkow type;--standing very low in Wilhelmina's judgment; and ill-seen, when not avoidable altogether, by the Queen's Majesty. [...] "The man was a poor Country Bailiff's (AMTMANN'S, kind of Tax-manager's) son: from Auditor of a regiment," [...] Papa's own regiment, [...] "he had risen to be Director of Finance, and a Minister of State. His soul was as low as his birth; it was an assemblage of all the vices," [...] [Wilhelmina, i. 16.] says Wilhelmina, {{in the language of}} exaggeration.--Let him stand by his budgets; keep well out of Wilhelmina's and the Queen's way;--and very especially beware of coming on Grumkow's field again.|$|E
60|$|And if {{this was}} an {{advertisement}} to the Castle Lane church, how much more so was it when the very pompous carriages came rolling up with their very pompous drivers, all of whom, being married men, had a depreciatory and wearied expression upon their faces, {{to show that they}} had done it all before and that it was nothing new to them. Out of the one carriage there jumped a very jaunty gentleman, somewhat past the middle age and a little inclined to stoutness, but looking very healthy and rosy nevertheless. Besides him there walked a tall, tawny-bearded man, who glanced solicitously every now and again at his companion, as though he were the <b>bottle-holder</b> at a prize-fight and feared that his man might collapse at a moment's notice. From a second carriage there emerged an athletic brown-faced young fellow accompanied by a small wizened gentleman in spotless attire, who was in such a state of nervousness that he dropped his lavender glove twice on his way up the aisle. These gentlemen grouped themselves {{at the end of the}} church conversing in low whispers and looking exceedingly uncomfortable, as is the prerogative of the sterner sex under such circumstances. Mr. Gilray, who was Tom's best man, was introduced to Herr von Baumser, and every one was very affable and nervous.|$|E
60|$|A negro and a {{white man}} were in the ring; {{everybody}} else outside. The cocks were brought in in sacks; and when time was called, they were taken out by the two <b>bottle-holders,</b> stroked, caressed, poked toward each other, and finally liberated. The big black cock plunged instantly at the little gray one and struck {{him on the head}} with his spur. The gray responded with spirit. Then the Babel of many-tongued shoutings broke out, and ceased not thenceforth. When the cocks had been fighting some little time, I was expecting them momently to drop dead, for both were blind, red with blood, and so exhausted that they frequently fell down. Yet they would not give up, neither would they die. The negro and the white man would pick them up every few seconds, wipe them off, blow cold water on them in a fine spray, and take their heads in their mouths and hold them there a moment--to warm back the perishing life perhaps; I do not know. Then, being set down again, the dying creatures would totter gropingly about, with dragging wings, find each other, strike a guesswork blow or two, and fall exhausted once more.|$|R
60|$|To {{assist the}} {{doubtful}} Wouter in the arduous business of legislation, {{a board of}} magistrates was appointed, which presided immediately over the police. This potent body consisted of a schout, or bailiff, with powers between those of the present mayor and sheriff--five burgermeesters, who were equivalent to aldermen, and five schepens, who officiated as scrubs, sub-devils, or <b>bottle-holders</b> to the burgermeesters, {{in the same manner}} as do assistant aldermen to their principals at the present day; it being their duty to fill the pipes of the lordly burgermeesters, hunt the markets for delicacies for corporation dinners, and to discharge such other little offices of kindness as were occasionally required. It was, moreover, tacitly understood, though not specifically enjoined, that they should consider themselves as butts for the blunt wits of the burgermeesters, and should laugh most heartily at all their jokes; but this last was a duty as rarely called in action in those days as it is at present, and was shortly remitted, in consequence of the tragical death of a fat little schepen, who actually died of suffocation in an unsuccessful effort to force a laugh at one of burgermeester Van Zandt's best jokes.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was a nice}} boy to {{let loose}} in a school. I could speak {{as well as an}} actor, as far as {{pronunciation}} goes; but I could hardly read words of one syllabile; and as to writing, I couldn't make pothooks and hangers respectably. To this day, I can no more spell than old Ned Skene can. What was a worse sort of ignorance was that I had no idea of fair play. I thought that all servants would be afraid of me, and that all grown-up people would tyrannize over me. I was afraid of everybody; afraid that my cowardice would be found out; and as angry and cruel in my ill-tempers as cowards always are. Now you'll hardly believe this; but what saved me from going to the bad altogether was my finding out that I was a good one to fight. The bigger boys were given to fighting, and used to have mills every Saturday afternoon, with seconds, <b>bottle-holders,</b> and everything complete, except the ropes and stakes. We little chaps used to imitate them among ourselves as best we could. At first, when they made me fight, I shut my eyes and cried; but for all that I managed to catch the other fellow tight round the waist and throw him. After that it became a regular joke to make me fight, for I always cried. But the end of it was that I learned to keep my eyes open and hit straight. I had no trouble about fighting then. Somehow, I could tell by instinct when the other fellow was going to hit me, and I always hit him first. It's the same with me now in the ring; I know what a man is going to do before he rightly knows himself. The power that this gave me, civilized me. It made me cock of the school; and I had to act accordingly. I had enough good-nature left to keep me from being a bully; and, as cock, I couldn't be mean or childish. There would be nothing like fighting for licking boys into shape if every one could be cock; but every one can't; so I suppose it does more harm than good.|$|R
6000|$|French Belleisle we have seen; who is gone again, long since, on {{his wide}} errands; fat Valori too we have seen, who is assiduously here. The other figures, except the English, can remain dark to us. Of Montijos, the eminent Spaniard, a brown little man, {{magnificent}} as the Kingdom of the Incas, {{with half a}} page of titles (half a peck, five-and-twenty or more, of handles to his little name, if you should ever require it); who, finding matters so backward at Frankfurt, and nothing to do there, has been out, in the interim, touring to while away the tedium; and is here only as sequel and corroboration of Belleisle,--say as <b>bottle-holder,</b> or as high-wrought peacock's-tail, to Belleisle:--of the eminent Montijos I have to record next to nothing {{in the shape of}} negotiation ("Treaty" [...] with the Termagant was once proposed by him here, which Friedrich in his politest way declined); and shall mention only, That his domestic arrangements were sumptuous and commodious in the extreme. Let him arrive in the meanest village, destitute of human appliances, and be directed to the hut where he is to lodge,--straightway from the fourgons and baggage-chests of Montijos is produced, first of all, a round of arras hangings, portable tables, portable stove, gold plate and silver; thus, with wax-lights, wines of richest vintage, exquisite cookeries, Montijos lodges, a king everywhere, creating an Aladdin's palace everywhere; able to say, like the Sage Bias, OMNIA MEA NAECUM PORTO. These things are recorded of Montijos. What he did in the way of negotiation has escaped men's memory, as it could well afford to do.|$|E
60|$|There is {{one point}} on which, {{as editor of}} these Manuscripts, we desire to say a word. It is thought by a portion of our readers, that the first Mr. Littlepage who has written, Cornelius of that name, has {{manifested}} an undue asperity {{on the subject of}} the New England character. Our reply to this charge is as follows: In the first place, we do not pretend to be answerable for all the opinions of those whose writings are submitted to our supervision, any more than we should be answerable for all the contradictory characters, impulses, and opinions that might be exhibited in a representation of fictitious characters, purely of our own creation. That the Littlepages entertained New York notions, and, if the reader will, New York prejudices, may be true enough; but in pictures of this sort, even prejudices become facts that ought not to be altogether kept down. Then, New England has long since anticipated her revenge, glorifying herself and underrating her neighbors in a way that, in our opinion, fully justifies those who possess a little Dutch blood in expressing their sentiments on the subject. Those who give so freely should know how to take a little in return; and that more especially, when there is nothing very direct or personal in the hits they receive. For ourselves, we have not a drop of Dutch or New England blood in our veins, and only appear as a <b>bottle-holder</b> to one of the parties in this set-to. If we have recorded what the Dutchman says of the Yankee, we have also recorded what the Yankee says, and that with no particular hesitation, of the Dutchman. We know that these feelings are by-gones; but our Manuscripts, thus far, have referred exclusively to the times in which they certainly existed, and that, too, in a force quite as great as they are here represented to be.|$|E
60|$|Mr Bonney then {{presented}} himself {{to move the}} first resolution; and having run his right hand through his hair, and planted his left, in an easy manner, in his ribs, he consigned his hat {{to the care of}} the gentleman with the double chin (who acted as a species of <b>bottle-holder</b> to the orators generally), and said he would read to them the first resolution--'That this meeting views with alarm and apprehension, the existing state of the Muffin Trade in this Metropolis and its neighbourhood; that it considers the Muffin Boys, as at present constituted, wholly underserving the confidence of the public; and that it deems the whole Muffin system alike prejudicial to the health and morals of the people, and subversive of the best interests of a great commercial and mercantile community.' The honourable gentleman made a speech which drew tears from the eyes of the ladies, and awakened the liveliest emotions in every individual present. He had visited the houses of the poor in the various districts of London, and had found them destitute of the slightest vestige of a muffin, which there appeared too much reason to believe some of these indigent persons did not taste from year's end to year's end. He had found that among muffin-sellers there existed drunkenness, debauchery, and profligacy, which he attributed to the debasing nature of their employment as at present exercised; he had found the same vices among the poorer class of people who ought to be muffin consumers; and this he attributed to the despair engendered by their being placed beyond the reach of that nutritious article, which drove them to seek a false stimulant in intoxicating liquors. He would undertake to prove before a committee of the House of Commons, that there existed a combination to keep up the price of muffins, and to give the bellmen a monopoly; he would prove it by bellmen at the bar of that House; and he would also prove, that these men corresponded with each other by secret words and signs as 'Snooks,' 'Walker,' 'Ferguson,' 'Is Murphy right?' and many others. It was this melancholy state of things that the Company proposed to correct; firstly, by prohibiting, under heavy penalties, all private muffin trading of every description; secondly, by themselves supplying the public generally, and the poor at their own homes, with muffins of first quality at reduced prices. It was with this object that a bill had been introduced into Parliament by their patriotic chairman Sir Matthew Pupker; it was this bill that they had met to support; it was the supporters of this bill who would confer undying brightness and splendour upon England, under the name of the United Metropolitan Improved Hot Muffin and Crumpet Baking and Punctual Delivery Company; he would add, with a capital of Five Millions, in five hundred thousand shares of ten pounds each.|$|E
5000|$|That at the {{expiration}} of thirty seconds (unless otherwise agreed upon) the umpire appointed shall cry “Time,” upon which each man shall {{rise from the}} knee of his <b>bottle-holder</b> and walk to his own side of the scratch unaided, the seconds and the bottle-holders remaining at their corner; and that either man failing so {{to be at the}} scratch within eight seconds, shall be deemed to have lost the battle.|$|E
5000|$|That {{each man}} shall be {{attended}} {{to the ring}} by a second and a <b>bottle-holder,</b> the former provided with a sponge and the latter {{with a bottle of}} water. That the combatants, on shaking hands, shall retire until the seconds of each have tossed for choice of position, which adjusted, the winner shall choose his corner according to the state of the wind or sun, and conduct his man thereto, the loser taking the opposite corner.|$|E
50|$|In an {{extended}} allegory, Hervey imagines his contemporary Old Father Christmas as a white-bearded magician {{dressed in a}} long robe and crowned with holly. His children are identified as Roast Beef (Sir Loin) and his faithful squire or <b>bottle-holder</b> Plum Pudding; the slender figure of Wassail with her fount of perpetual youth; a 'tricksy spirit' who bears the bowl {{and is on the}} best of terms with the Turkey; Mumming; Misrule, with a feather in his cap; the Lord of Twelfth Night under a state-canopy of cake and wearing his ancient crown; Saint Distaff looking like an old maid ("she used to be a sad romp; but her merriest days we fear are over"); Carol singing; the Waits; and the twin-faced Janus.|$|E
50|$|A hiatus in Johnson's boxing career followed, with no challengers {{coming forward}} until the Irish {{champion}} Michael Ryan took an interest.

50|$|In {{later and}} more {{elaborate}} examples {{the tables were}} fitted with a revolving wine-carriage, <b>bottle-holder</b> or tray working upon a balanced arm which enabled the bottles to be passed to any guest without shaking. The side opposite the guests was often fitted with a network bag. It has been conjectured that this bag was intended to hold biscuits, but {{it is much more}} likely that its function was to prevent glasses and bottles which might be upset from falling to the floor. That the wine-table might be drawn up to the fire in cold weather without inconvenience from the heat it was fitted with curtains hung upon a brass frame and running upon rings. Sometimes the table was accompanied by a circular bottle-stand supported on a tripod into which the bottles were deeply sunk to preserve them from the heat of the fire. Yet another form was circular with a socket in the center for the bottle. Wine-tables followed the fashion of other tables and were often inlaid with wood or brass. They are now exceedingly scarce.|$|E

Egan described it as [...] The set-to {{was one of the}} finest ever witnessed and much science was displayed; the parries and feints eliciting general admiration ... second round was terrible beyond description - science seemed forgotten - and they appeared like two blacksmiths at an anvil, when Ryan received a knock-down blow. The battle was well sustained on both sides for some time; but Ryan's passion getting the better of him, he began to lose ground. Ryan's head and eyes made a dreadful appearance and Johnson was severely punished. [...] It was over in 33 minutes, when Ryan gave up the fight. One spectator, a Mr Hollingsworth, who was a corn factor and had at one time employed Johnson, was so impressed and pleased with how much he had made from betting on Johnson that he settled a £20 per annum gift for life on the fighter.|$|E
