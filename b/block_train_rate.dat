50|$|The {{president}} of Wisconsin Central, Ed Burkhardt dispatched Mark Rosner to Australia {{to take control}} in Tasmania. Amongst Rosner’s achievements was the implementing of a new condensed Operating Rule Book, which eliminated some more complex practices in favour of vastly simplified procedures. Single car roadside freight was resumed where customers required it (discontinued under Australian National) in line with US short line practice. On sections of the main trunk line north of Hobart, moving <b>block</b> <b>train</b> spacing (5,000 metres minimum) managed over train radio replaced fixed <b>block</b> <b>train</b> order working introduced under Australian National.|$|R

30|$|Our goal is {{to study}} the link between {{retirement}} intentions and some characteristics of the work environment affecting productivity, such as the frequency of technical change or the chance to receive firm-sponsored training, computed at the industry-occupation level.

25|$|The box-cab E class {{locomotives}} {{continued in}} service. However, during the 1970s, Victorian Railways conducted detailed studies of goods traffic {{and found that}} handling costs made the transport of high rated, small freight items unprofitable. As {{a result of these}} studies, rail freight operations were rationalised around <b>block</b> <b>trains</b> carrying bulk freight such as gravel, rice or grain, and suburban goods sidings were closed in favour of road freight service. Furthermore, the use of <b>block</b> <b>trains</b> greatly reduced the need for shunting locomotives. These operational changes rendered the ageing E class suburban electric locomotives surplus, and by 1981 scrappings had commenced. The last was withdrawn from service in 1984.|$|R

40|$|The {{drawback}} of the Back Propagation (BP) {{algorithm is}} slow training and easily convergence {{to the local}} minimum and suffers from saturation training. To overcome those problems, we created a new dynamic function for each <b>training</b> <b>rate</b> and momentum term. In this study, we presented the (BPDRM) algorithm, which training with dynamic <b>training</b> <b>rate</b> and momentum term. Also in this study, a new strategy is proposed, which consists of multiple steps to avoid inflation in the gross weight when adding each <b>training</b> <b>rate</b> and momentum term as a dynamic function. In this proposed strategy, fitting is done by making {{a relationship between the}} dynamic <b>training</b> <b>rate</b> and the dynamic momentum. As a result, this study placed an implicit dynamic momentum term in the dynamic <b>training</b> <b>rate.</b> This αdmic = f(1 /η_dmic). This procedure kept the weights as moderate as possible (not to small or too large). The 2 -dimensional XOR problem and buba data were used as benchmarks for testing the effects of the ‘new strategy’. All experiments were performed on Matlab software (2012 a). From the experiment’s results, it is evident that the dynamic BPDRM algorithm provides a superior performance in terms of training and it provides faster training compared to the (BP) algorithm at same limited error...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{evidence}} indicates that prior learning about a set of cues may determine how new cues are processed. If subjects are taught that two reliable predictors of an outcome do not summate when the cues are presented together (i. e., subadditive pretraining), the subjects will tend to show a less profound <b>blocking</b> effect when <b>trained</b> with different cues. Three experiments investigated the conditions necessary for subadditive pretraining to generalize to new cues. Experiment 1 demonstrated that subadditive pretraining is less effective in reducing blocking when it is experienced in a context other than that in which the <b>blocking</b> <b>training</b> is experienced. In Experiment 2, the effectiveness of subadditive pretraining waned with time. Experiment 3 showed that subad- ditive pretraining is more effective when the temporal characteristics of pretraining cues {{are similar to those}} of the cues used in <b>blocking</b> <b>training.</b> These results provide information concerning the conditions under which learning will generalize from one set of cues to another. status: publishe...|$|R

Nevertheless, the modes Melody and Rhyme&Melody increased participants’ accuracy rates significantly in both training methods. However, this increase was substantially smaller for the participants in the <b>blocked</b> <b>training</b> groups than those in the random-order training groups, simply because participants <b>trained</b> with the <b>blocked</b> method performed exceptionally well from the start. In the novel[*]+[*]hint sentence production task, this discrepancy yielded a significant interaction of training method and Rhyme&Melody training mode.|$|R
