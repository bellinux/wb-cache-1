Although {{the attack}} on the city was to be {{conducted}} by the US Seventh Army's 100th Infantry Division, French leader Charles de Gaulle found this to be unacceptable, as he felt the capture of the region by Free French forces would increase French influence in post-war decisions. Independently, he directed General de Lattre to order the French 5th Armored Division, 2nd Moroccan Infantry Division and 3rd Algerian Infantry Division to begin their drive to Stuttgart on 18 April 1945. Two days later, the French forces coordinated with the US Seventh Army and VI Corps heavy artillery, who began a barrage the city. The French 5th Armored Division then captured Stuttgart on 21 April 1945, encountering little resistance. The city fared poorly under their direction; French troops forcefully quartered their troops in what housing remained in the city, rapes were frequent (there were at least 1389 recorded incidents of rape of civilians by French soldiers), and the city's surviving populace were poorly rationed. The circumstances of what later became known as [...] "The Stuttgart Crisis" [...] provoked political repercussions that reached even the White House. President Harry S. Truman was unable to get De Gaulle to withdraw troops from Stuttgart until after the final <b>boundaries</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>zones</b> of occupation were established.

We seek {{to answer this question}} by examining the effect that different ownership structures have on the outcomes of sugarcane farmers in India.

We find that private mills encourage sugarcane production, and that this effect is concentrated on farmers that own less land. Private mills appear to provide more loans for poorer farmers, thereby encouraging them to cultivate cane. Consumption is also relatively higher for poorer farmers living on the private side of the border. Soil testing confirms that results are not driven simply by variation in soil quality...|$|E
40|$|Abstract We {{present a}} new {{probabilistic}} seismic hazard analysis (PSHA) for New Zealand. An {{important feature of}} the analysis is {{the application of a}} new method for the treatment of historical (distributed) seismicity data in PSHA. The PSHA uses the seismicity recorded across and beneath the country to define a three-dimensional grid of a-values (i. e., parameter a of a Gutenberg–Richter distribution log N/yr a bM, in which N/yr is the number of earthquakes per year recorded inside each grid cell equal to or greater than magnitude M); parameter b and the limiting maximum cutoff magnitude of the Gutenberg–Richter distribution are defined from the sur-rounding region (14 crustal and 23 subcrustal seismotectonic zones are defined for the country) and then smoothed across the <b>boundaries</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>zones.</b> The methodology therefore combines the modern method of defining continuous distributions of seis-micity parameters (Frankel, 1995; Frankel et al., 1996) with the traditional method of defining large area sources and the associated seismicity parameters (e. g., Alger-missen et al., 1990).

40|$|The {{region of}} Southeast Srem {{is rich in}} ground waters, which is of great {{significance}} to agricultural production. The objective {{of this paper was}} to designate the zones of different groundwater types from the aspect of recharge, based on the analysis of groundwater regimes in the study area. A very complex groundwater regime in Southeast Srem, which depends on a great number of natural and some anthropogenic factors, makes it difficult to designate clearly the zones of the three main types of groundwater regime. Still, the <b>boundaries</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>zones</b> of groundwater regime types were defined {{based on the results of}} correlation analysis of the basic factors affecting the groundwater regime. Zone I includes the climatic type of groundwater. Its fluctuation corresponds to the vertical factors of water balance (precipitation and evaporation) and it is not affected by the river water level. This zone extends North and East of the line Putinci, Golubinci, Stara Pazova, Batajnica, Dobanovci, mainly in the area of the loess plateau. Within the zone, groundwater is at a relatively great depth. Only exceptionally, in the valleys, it appears almost on the surface. Zone II includes the climatic-hydrological groundwater type, which is the transition between the climatic type and the hydrological type. The fluctuation of groundwater regime is affected both by the effect of vertical balance factors, and by the effect of watercourses. Climatic-hydrological groundwater type covers the central and the lowest part of the study area and the South part of the middle terrace.

40|$|The {{accident}} at the Chernobyl {{nuclear power plant}} was the largest nuclear accident in the world. It led to radioactive contamination of 14 regions of the Russian Federation. In 1991, 4540 settlements were attributable to areas with levels of soil contamination by 137 Cs of more than 1. 0 Ci/km 2. As of 2016, 3855 settlements with the {{population of more than}} 1, 5 million people are carried to a zone of radioactive contamination according to the Government Directive No 1074 dated October 8, 2015 «On Approval of the List of settlements located within the <b>boundaries</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>zones</b> of radioactive contamination from the Chernobyl disaster». In accordance with this Directive, in the Leningrad region 29 settlements were classified as zones of radioactive contamination. This article describes the dynamics of changes in the radiation situation and its current state in the territories of the Leningrad Region affected by the Chernobyl accident. The paper presents the dynamics of 137 Cs and 90 Sr contents in food products of local origin, the results of calculations of the current average annual effective doses used for the purposes of settlements’ zoning, and the average annual effective radiation doses actually received by the population, dating back to 1986. According to the results of laboratory studies, since 1987, there have been no exceedances of the permissible levels for 137 Cs s in agricultural products and food raw materials of local origin. However in the wild products (mushrooms) excesses of the permissible levels for 137 Cs have been periodically detected. The cases of exceeding the permissible levels for the content of strontium- 90 in food, drinking water and water from open water bodies were not recorded for the entire observation period; the determined activity was at the level of tens and hundreds of times less than the permissible levels. In 2016, conservatively estimated average annual effective doses of exposure used for the purposes of settlements’ zoning, of residents of settlements in the Leningrad region, referred to the zones of radioactive contamination, do not exceed 0. 090 mSv / year. The average annual dose actually received by the population in 2016, does not exceed 0. 082 mSv / year. Thus, {{based on the results of}} the radiation monitoring, the situation associated with the impact of ionizing radiation sources in the Leningrad Region, formed as a result of the Chernobyl accident, currently is characterized as safe. </p...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{describes}} the neotectonics of the Sakhalin Island and analyzes {{the latest and}} recent tectonic stresses {{in the study area}} in order to establish their differences in the Amur and Okhotsk microplates, which boundary is confined to the Tym-Poronaisk fault, the largest NS-striking fault in the Central Sakhalin (Fig. 1). Our map of the structural geomorphological features of the study area (Fig. 2) shows three longitudinal zones: the western and eastern uplifts, and the Central Sakhalin basin between the uplifts. In the Southern Sakhalin, neotectonic stresses were studied by a combination of tectonophysical methods and the method of structural geology (Figures 3 to 6, and Table). Our study shows that the regional axes of maximum and minimum compressive principal normal stresses are primarily of the subhorizontal orientations (Fig. 5, Д). In the Northern and Central Sakhalin, neotectonic stresses were reconstructed by the structural geomorphology method. The compression axes are oriented sublatitudinally, with the NE-trending strike in the Northern Sakhalin (Fig. 7, A), and the extension axes are oriented submeridionally; in the Northern Sakhalin, respectively, they are oriented in the NW direction. The results of our study of neotectonic stresses were used to construct a map of recent geodynamics of Sakhalin (Fig. 7, Б), which shows zones differing in the geodynamic settings of the most recent faulting. According to the analysis of the recent tectonic stress with respect to the earthquake focal mechanisms in the period from 1978 to 2015 (Fig. 8), recent stresses dominating in Sakhalin have mainly the sublatitudinal low-angle orientations of the deviatoric compression axis. The submeridional low-angle orientations of the deviatoric extension axes are observed in the Northern Sakhalin and partly in the north of the Southern Sakhalin (see Fig. 8). The high-angle axes of deviatoric extension are typical of the western and central parts of the Southern Sakhalin, and such extension leads to horizontal compression and reverse faulting. In some areas of the recent stress field, the deviatoric axes of compression and extension have unstable orientations. The latitudinal boundaries of such areas are nearly coincident with the <b>boundaries</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>zones</b> that differ in the geodynamic settings of the most recent faulting, which means that these areas and zones are reliably identified. The relative inhomogeneity of the neotectonic and recent stress fields in the Southern Sakhalin does not give grounds to distinguish differences in the state of crustal stresses in the areas located {{on the sides of the}} Southern Sakhalin fault. As a consequence, a boundary between the Amur and the Okhotsk Plate in the South Sakhalin cannot be drawn along this fault. It is most likely that this boundary coincides with the Western-Sakhalin fault in the southern areas of the study region. Our data on the Central and Northern Sakhalin does not contradict with the conclusion in [Savostin et al., 1982] concerning this boundary. </p...|$|E
