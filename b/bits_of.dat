5|$|The {{encryption}} {{resembles the}} RSA algorithm. This algorithm encodes data in 3-byte blocks. First, the each byte is permuted through an 8-position permutation, then the bits are {{split into two}} 12-bit integers (by taking the low 4 <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> the second byte and the 8 <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> the first byte as the first 12-bit integer, and the 8 <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> the third byte and the 4 high <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> the second integer as the second 12-bit integer). Each is individually encrypted by taking them to the 3491st power, mod 4097; the bits are then reassembled into 3 bytes. The encrypted text is then stored in a string variable {{as part of the}} program. To shroud the would be visible and noticeable text it is compressed with the simple Lzw before final storage. As the Macintosh Common Lisp compiler compresses the main program code into the executable, this was not that necessary.|$|E
5|$|Broaching {{is often}} {{impossible}} without the specific broaching or keyway machines {{unless you have}} a system {{that can be used in}} conjunction with a modern machining centre or driven tooling lathe; these extra <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> equipment open up the possibility of producing keyways, splines and torx through one-hit machining.|$|E
5|$|It is {{one thing}} to say that a bird has a {{property}} right in its nest, or that a wolf has a property right in its den – specific <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> territory used exclusively by one animal family. But the habitat that animals need to survive extends far beyond such specific and exclusive <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> territory – animals often need to fly or roam over vast territories shared by many other animals. Protecting a bird’s nest is of little help if the nearby watering holes are polluted, or if tall buildings block its flight path. It’s not clear how ideas of property rights can help here.|$|E
50|$|This table {{specifies}} {{the input}} permutation on a 64-bit block. The meaning is as follows: the first <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> the output {{is taken from}} the 58th <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> the input; the second bit from the 50th bit, and so on, with the last <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> the output taken from the 7th <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> the input.|$|R

5|$|After {{the demise}} of the Mughal Empire, the mosque was {{converted}} into a Sikh temple and renamed Moti Mandir during the period of the Sikh rule under Ranjit Singh's Sikh Confederacy. He later used the building for the state treasury. When the British took over Punjab in 1849, they discovered precious stones wrapped in <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> rags and placed in velvet purses scattered inside the mosque, along with other inventory.|$|E
5|$|Both HDMI and DVI use TMDS to send 10-bit {{characters}} that are encoded using 8b/10b encoding that {{differs from the}} original IBM form for the Video Data Period and 2b/10b encoding for the Control Period. HDMI adds the ability to send audio and auxiliary data using 4b/10b encoding for the Data Island Period. Each Data Island Period is 32 pixels in size and contains a 32-bit Packet Header, which includes 8 <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> BCH ECC parity data for error correction and describes {{the contents of the}} packet. Each packet contains four subpackets, and each subpacket is 64 bits in size, including 8 <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> BCH ECC parity data, allowing for each packet to carry up to 224 <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> audio data. Each Data Island Period can contain up to 18 packets. Seven of the 15 packet types described in the HDMI 1.3a specifications deal with audio data, while the other 8 types deal with auxiliary data. Among these are the General Control Packet and the Gamut Metadata Packet. The General Control Packet carries information on AVMUTE (which mutes the audio during changes that may cause audio noise) and Color Depth (which sends the bit depth of the current video stream and is required for deep color). The Gamut Metadata Packet carries information on the color space being used for the current video stream and is required for xvYCC.|$|E
5|$|In {{creating}} the half dollar, Mora used motifs evoking California {{at the time}} of statehood in 1850. The obverse depicts a Gold Rush-era prospector, kneeling. He washes material with his pan, seeking <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> placer gold. The reverse adapts the Flag of California, known as the Bear Flag, showing a grizzly bear. Mora left the fields, or background, of the coin unpolished, giving the piece a textured look.|$|E

5|$|Inscriptions for the {{practice}} of magic in Gaul show the characteristic use of Greek for spells in the Imperial period. A 2nd-century curse tablet from Autun (Augustodunum) lists the names of those to be cursed in Latin, two magic words in Greek, and a series of voces magicae. A defixio (binding spell) from Amélie-les-Bains seems composed in Celtic with <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> Latin. A lamella from Roman Britain has been interpreted as Hebrew written in Greek characters.|$|E
5|$|Midshipman Jonathon Monkhouse {{proposed}} fothering the ship, as he {{had previously}} been on a merchant ship which used the technique successfully. He was entrusted with supervising the task, sewing <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> oakum and wool into an old sail, which was then drawn under the ship to allow water pressure to force it into {{the hole in the}} hull. The effort succeeded and soon very little water was entering, allowing the crew to stop two of the three pumps.|$|E

5|$|The larvae {{of other}} species of caddisfly make nets rather than cases. These are silken webs {{stretching}} between aquatic vegetation and over stones. These net-making larvae usually live in running water, different species occupying different habitats with varying water speeds. There is a constant drift of invertebrates washed downstream by the current, and these animals, and <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> debris, accumulate in the nets which serve both as food traps and as retreats.|$|E
5|$|The machine's {{instruction}} set was increased from the 7 of the SSEM to 26 initially, including multiplication done in hardware.

5|$|Being a {{saprobic}} fungus, Cyathus olla obtains {{nutrients from}} {{the breakdown of}} dead organic matter, and as such is usually found growing on woody debris; specimens found growing on soil are usually attached to <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> wood or stems present in the soil. Brodie notes that this species usually grows in moist and shaded locations, although its discovery in the arid regions of Lima, Peru, {{suggest that it is}} tolerant of low-moisture conditions. It is the most abundant species of Cyathus found in Europe, and is also common in North America. Its range extends north to Sweden and far south in South America; it has also been reported in Australia, South Africa, Iran, and India.|$|E
5|$|During Borobudur excavation, archeologists {{discovered}} colour pigments of blue, red, green, black, {{as well as}} <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> gold foil, {{and concluded}} that the monument that we see today — a dark gray mass of volcanic stone, lacking in colour — was probably once coated with varjalepa white plaster and then painted with bright colors, serving perhaps as a beacon of Buddhist teaching. The same vajralepa plaster can also be found in Sari, Kalasan and Sewu temples. It is likely that the bas-reliefs of Borobudur was originally quite colourful, before centuries of torrential tropical rainfalls peeled-off the colour pigments.|$|E

Rosa Lee, whose husband was killed in the Vietnam War, is raising her young son, Sonny (Allan Hubbard), on her own.

5|$|Mansfield's {{publicity}} {{drive was}} one of the best in Hollywood. For publicity she gave up all privacy, keeping her doors always open to photographers. In 1954, the day before Christmas she walked into publicist James Byron's office with a gift and asked him to supervise her publicity. From that time till the end of 1961, Byron shaped much of her publicity. Byron appointed most people in her team— William Shiffrin (press agent), Greg Bautzer (attorney) and Charles Goldring (business manager), and constantly planted <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> publicity material in the media. She appeared in about 2,500 newspaper photographs between September 1956 and May 1957, and had about 122,000 lines of newspaper copy written about her during this time.|$|E

The Klamath Mountains consist of multiple terranes—former volcanic islands and coral reefs and <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> subduction zones, mantle, and seafloor—that merged offshore over vast stretches of time before colliding with North America as a single block about 150 to 130million years ago. Much of the Rogue River watershed, including the Rogue River canyon, the Kalmiopsis Wilderness, the Illinois River basin, and Mount Ashland, are composed of exotic terranes.|$|E
