40|$|Callable bonds offer higher yields {{compared}} to non-callable bonds. In this paper, {{we examine the}} <b>call</b> <b>spread</b> in a global framework, while controlling for firm-level, bond-level, and country-level variables. Using an international sample of 13, 936 bonds issued between 1991 and 2007, we find that callable bonds have a positive <b>call</b> <b>spread,</b> which is statistically and economically significant. Our empirical results hold after a battery of robustness checks. We also find that junk callable bonds have a higher <b>call</b> <b>spread</b> than investment-grade callable bonds, {{which is consistent with}} the signaling theory. The empirical results also show that highly leveraged firms have a higher <b>call</b> <b>spread</b> than firms with low leverage, a finding that is consistent with the risk-shifting arguments...|$|R
50|$|The {{calendar}} <b>call</b> <b>spread</b> (see calendar spread) is a bullish {{strategy and}} consists of selling a put option with a shorter expiration against a purchased call option with an expiration further out in time. The calendar <b>call</b> <b>spread</b> is basically a leveraged version of the covered call (see above), but purchasing long call options instead of purchasing stock.|$|R
50|$|Often {{the call}} {{with the lower}} {{exercise}} price will be at-the-money while the call with the higher exercise price is out-of-the-money. Both calls must have the same underlying security and expiration month. If the bull <b>call</b> <b>spread</b> is done so that both the sold and bought calls expire on the same day, it is a vertical debit <b>call</b> <b>spread.</b>|$|R

50|$|If the trader is bearish (expects {{prices to}} fall), {{you use a}} bearish <b>call</b> <b>spread.</b> It's named this way because you're buying and selling a call and taking a bearish position.|$|R

5000|$|The {{position}} is {{so named because}} of {{the shape of the}} profit/loss graph, which loosely resembles a large-bodied bird, such as a condor. In keeping with this analogy, traders often refer to the inner options collectively as the [...] "body" [...] and the outer options as the [...] "wings". The word iron in the name of this position indicates that, like an iron butterfly, this {{position is}} constructed using both calls and puts, by combining a bull put spread with a bear <b>call</b> <b>spread.</b> The combination of these two credit spreads makes the long iron condor (and the long iron butterfly) a credit spread, {{despite the fact that it}} is [...] "long." [...] This distinguishes the position from a plain Condor position (and the plain Butterfly), which would be constructed with all calls or all puts, by combining either a bull <b>call</b> <b>spread</b> with a bear <b>call</b> <b>spread</b> or a bull put spread with a bear put spread. Because the long, plain Condor (and Butterfly) combine a debit spread with a credit spread, that overall position is instead entered at a net debit (though usually small).|$|R
5000|$|The iron {{butterfly}} is {{a neutral}} strategy {{and consists of}} a combination of a bull put credit spread and a bear <b>call</b> credit <b>spread</b> (see above). The iron butterfly is a special case of an iron condor (see above) where the strike price for the bull put credit spread and the bear <b>call</b> credit <b>spread</b> are the same. Ideally, the margin for the iron butterfly is the maximum of the bull put and bear <b>call</b> <b>spreads,</b> but some brokers require a cumulative margin for the bull put and the bear call. The maximum return generated for the iron butterfly is when the stock price is the same as when the position was entered.

50|$|Many options {{strategies}} are built around spreads and combinations of spreads.
