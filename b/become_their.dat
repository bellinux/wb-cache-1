5|$|Beginning with Everybody's In Show-biz (1972), Ray Davies began {{exploring}} theatrical concepts on the group's albums; {{these themes}} became manifest on the 1973 album Preservation Act 1 and continued through Schoolboys In Disgrace (1976). The Kinks found little success with these conceptual works, and reverted {{to a traditional}} rock format throughout {{the remainder of the}} 1970s. Sleepwalker (1977), which heralded their return to commercial success, featured a mainstream, relatively slick production style that would <b>become</b> <b>their</b> norm. The band returned to hard rock for Low Budget (1979), and continued to record within the genre throughout the remainder of their career.|$|E
5|$|By mid-1977 in {{downtown}} New York, punk rock was already ceding its cutting-edge status to the anarchic sound of Teenage Jesus and the Jerks and Mars, spearheads of {{what became known}} as no wave, although several original punk bands continued to perform and new ones emerged on the scene. The Cramps, whose core members were from Sacramento, California by way of Akron, had debuted at CBGB in November 1976, opening for the Dead Boys. They were soon playing regularly at Max's Kansas City. The Misfits formed in nearby New Jersey. Still developing what would <b>become</b> <b>their</b> signature B movie–inspired style, later dubbed horror punk, they made their first appearance at CBGB in April 1977.|$|E

Chosen as the keynote speaker at the party's national convention on May 9, 1860, many urged him to <b>become</b> <b>their</b> nominee for president.
