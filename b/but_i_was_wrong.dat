Her rights were not restored until 1820. The former Queen of Etruria wrote in her Memoirs:I was {{for two years and}} a half in that monastery and one year without seeing or talking to anybody. I was not allowed to write or receive news not even from my own son. I had been in the convent for eleven months already when my parents came with my son to Rome on 16 June 1812. I was hoping to be released immediately after their arrival, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong,</b> instead of diminishing the rigor of my imprisonment I was put under stricter orders.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the failure}} of two of her {{commercial}} releases, Zinta began working with art film directors, and turned towards neo-realistic films, known in India as Parallel Cinema. She acted in her first English film, Rituparno Ghosh's The Last Lear, as a struggling film actress opposite Amitabh Bachchan. The film premiered at the 2007 Toronto International Film Festival, and was received well. Later reviews in India were approving, with Rajeev Masand writing, [...] "Preity Zinta gets through her scenes competently, never allowing her cute-as-a-button image {{to take away from}} the impact she makes here as a conflicted, mature woman." [...] Initially dismissive of art films, Zinta eventually spoke of her first venture into the genre, confessing, [...] "I did think with art films that they don't pay you, they don't feed you, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong,</b> and I'm so happy to be here." ...|$|E

She stated that [...] "the tune rides a {{grinding}} R beat" [...] as Jackson sings in a [...] "plaintive falsetto": [...] "My life has taken me beyond the planets and the stars/ And you're the only one that could take me this far/ I'll be forever searching for your love." [...] Kaufman noted that Jackson became more forceful during the chorus, when he sang, [...] "You're the one that makes me strong / I can't make it another day / You're the fire that keeps me warm / I can't make it another day." [...] The journalist also noted the lyrical and melodical similarities between [...] "Another Day" [...] and [...] "Storm", which features Kravitz singing, [...] "I walked away <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> / You're the one that keeps me strong / You're the fire that keeps me warm / How will I get through this storm?" ...|$|E

2500|$|When McTavish and Brian Frons, {{president}} of ABC Daytime, collaborated on the storyline, their {{inspiration for the}} pairing was a story from two decades earlier [...] the Adam Chandler/Dixie Cooney/Tad Martin love triangle of the late 1980s [...] where Adam was set up as the roadblock against Tad and Dixie's union. McTavish and Frons originally saw Babe and Jamie as the true love couple with JR as the antagonist. Babe's true love was later revised. The character explains, [...] "Jamie was around {{at one of the}} lowest points of my life, and I thought that he was the one. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong.</b> As great as Jamie was, he could never take JR’s place in my heart, because JR never left." ...|$|E

60|$|Verification of {{the reasons}} above given for the paucity of this direct evidence, is yielded by contemplation of it; for it is {{observable}} that the cases named are cases which, from one or other cause, have thrust themselves on observation. They justify the suspicion {{that it is not}} because such cases are rare that many of them cannot be cited; but simply because they are mostly unobtrusive, and to be found only by that deliberate search which nobody makes. <b>I</b> say nobody, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>wrong.</b> Successful search has been made by one whose competence as an observer is beyond question, and whose testimony is less liable than that of all others to any bias towards the conclusion that such inheritance takes place.

6000|$|<b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>wrong</b> {{in saying}} that no cyclist, {{according}} to the poster, ever works. Now I come to reflect, I have seen posters representing gentlemen on cycles working very hard--over-working themselves, one might almost say. They are thin and haggard with the toil, the perspiration stands upon their brow in beads; you feel {{that if there is}} another hill beyond the poster they must either get off or die. But this is the result of their own folly. This happens because they will persist in riding a machine of an inferior make. Were they riding a [...] "Putney Popular" [...] or [...] "Battersea Bounder," [...] such as the sensible young man in the centre of the poster rides, then all this unnecessary labour would be saved to them. Then all required of them would be, as in gratitude bound, to look happy; perhaps, occasionally to back-pedal a little when the machine in its youthful buoyancy loses its head for a moment and dashes on too swiftly.|$|R

60|$|I {{reflected}} {{with pleasure}} that perhaps we had now seen {{the last of}} him, and that before that threat of Madonna's he would see fit to ride home to Cesena and remain there. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong.</b> With incredible effrontery and daring he lingered. The morrow was a Sunday, and, on the Tuesday or Wednesday following, Cesare Borgia and his cousin Ignacio were expected.

6000|$|I {{know that}} some turn of disease had begun to parade erotic images before his eyes, and I do not doubt that he drew these images.

His preparation had been the exhaustion of sin in act, while the preparation of the Saint is the exhaustion of his pride, and instead of the Saint's humility, he had come to see the images of the mind in a kind of frozen passion, the virginity of the intellect.|$|E

Oh, I was mad--mad! I knew that I could not keep up the deception for ever, that you must find me out in time. But I had a wild hope that by then we should be so close to one another that you might find it in your heart to forgive. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong.</b> I see it now.

Where once I saw only terrible wastes of barren ground now I see beauty and something noble. Then, at first, your cowboys struck me as dirty, rough, loud, crude, savage--all that was primitive. I did not want them near me. I imagined them callous, hard men, their only joy a carouse with their kind. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong.</b> I have changed. The dirt was only dust, and this desert dust is clean. They are still rough, loud, crude, and savage in my eyes, but with a difference. They are natural men. They are little children. Monty Price is one of nature's noblemen. The hard thing is to discover it. All his hideous person, all his actions and speech, are masks of his real nature. Nels is a joy, a simple, sweet, kindly, quiet man whom some woman should have loved. What would love have meant to him! He told me that no woman ever loved him except his mother, and he lost her when he was ten. Every man ought to be loved--especially such a man as Nels. Somehow his gun record does not impress me. I never could believe he killed a man. Then take your foreman, Stewart. He is a cowboy, his work and life the same as the others. But he has education and most of the graces we are in the habit of saying make a gentleman. Stewart is a strange fellow, just like this strange country. He's a man, Majesty, and I admire him. So, you see, my impressions are developing with my stay out here." ...|$|E
