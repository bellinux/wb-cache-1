500|$|The Peterloo Massacre {{has been}} {{called one of the}} {{defining}} moments of its age. Many of those present at the massacre, including local masters, employers and owners, were horrified by the carnage. One of the casualties, Oldham cloth-worker and ex-soldier John Lees, who died from his wounds on 9 September, had been present at the Battle of Waterloo. Shortly before his death he said to a friend that he had never been in such danger as at Peterloo: [...] "At Waterloo there was man to man <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> downright murder." [...] When news of the massacre began to spread, the population of Manchester and surrounding districts was horrified and outraged.|$|E
2500|$|In the 4th century BC, a few Doric temples were erected with 6 × 15 or 6 × 14 columns, {{probably}} {{referring to}} local Archaic predecessors, e.g. the Temple of Zeus in Nemea {{and that of}} Athena in Tegea. Generally, Doric temples followed a tendency to become lighter in their superstructures. Columns became narrower, intercolumniations wider. This shows a growing adjustment to the proportion and weight of Ionic temples, mirrored by a progressive tendency among Ionic temples to become somewhat heavier. In the light of this mutual influence {{it is not surprising}} that in the late 4th century BC temple of Zeus at Nemea, the front is emphasised by a pronaos two intercolumniations deep, while the opisthodomos is suppressed. [...] Frontality is a key feature of Ionic temples. The emphasis on the pronaos already occurred in the slightly older temple of Athena at Tegea, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> repeated in the opisthodomos. Both temples continued the tendency towards more richly equipped interiors, in both cases with engaged or full columns of the Corinthian order.|$|E

6000|$|It {{was several}} evenings after this that David Grief, {{lounging}} under the after deck awning of the Kittiwake and idly scanning the meagre columns of the Papeete Avant-Coureur, sat suddenly up and almost rubbed his eyes.

60|$|It was monstrous and incredible, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>it</b> <b>was.</b> There was {{no getting}} round it. The man was there talking when {{he ought to}} have been dead.

60|$|Leaving the bilious and {{mathematical}} exactitude, the preposterous peace of that backwater, he thought suddenly: 'During coverture!

60|$|The {{freckled}} girl {{went out}} and {{stood for a moment}} {{at the head of the}} stairs. When she came back she looked very hard at her friend. The incident struck her as important--wonderfully important. It was unassimilable, of course, and absurd, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> the thing that is so cardinal to a girl, the emotion, the subservience, the crowning triumph of her sex.

6000|$|Hurriedly {{depositing}} his hat, {{he ran to}} Cecilia. He still {{preserved the}} habit of knocking on her door before he entered, though she had never, so far, answered, [...] "Don't come in!" [...] because she knew his knock. The custom gave, in fact, the measure of his idealism. What he feared, or what he thought he feared, after nineteen years of unchecked entrance, could never have been ascertained; <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> that flower of something formal and precise, of something reticent, within his soul.|$|E
60|$|The Roman {{taking of}} the census was an abomination. Yet {{it had to be}} done, for it was the basis of taxation. <b>But</b> <b>there</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> again. Taxation by the State was a crime against their law and God. Oh, that Law! It was not the Roman law. It was their law, what they called God's law. There were the zealots, who murdered anybody who broke this law. And for a procurator to punish a zealot caught red-handed was to raise a riot or an insurrection.|$|E

60|$|The esquimo returns {{after five}} minutes, however. There is a bedroom in the house. He is pleased, because he didn't like putting {{us into the}} bagnio.

60|$|They looked. Some {{miles from}} them, across the great plain of bush that merged {{gradually}} into swamp, lay that {{branch of the}} Zambesi which they would reach.

60|$|Ah! {{but there}} was no truth in it--could not be.
