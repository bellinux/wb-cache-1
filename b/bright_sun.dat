5|$|A polar bear—the {{guardian}} of the ice wand—raises the ice wand from beneath the ocean. The fairies add an ice wand to each planet of the Solar System. Along with the white wand at Fairy World, the ice wands create a celestial smile that projects its light into The Darkness. The smile transforms it into a <b>bright</b> <b>sun,</b> The Kindness, and Timmy concludes The Darkness was only looking for a friend. The group returns to Dimmsdale, where an Eliminator, dubbed a 'Hug'inator by Cosmo, crashes {{in front of them}} and spews out everyone who had been sucked in. Everyone parties in Fairy World and celebrates the chosen one's accomplishment.|$|E
5|$|Dust {{kicked up}} by the winds of the parent thunderstorm, heavy rain and hail, and the {{darkness}} of night are all factors which can reduce the visibility of tornadoes. Tornadoes occurring in these conditions are especially dangerous, since only weather radar observations, or possibly {{the sound of an}} approaching tornado, serve as any warning to those in the storm's path. Most significant tornadoes form under the storm's updraft base, which is rain-free, making them visible. Also, most tornadoes occur in the late afternoon, when the <b>bright</b> <b>sun</b> can penetrate even the thickest clouds. Night-time tornadoes are often illuminated by frequent lightning.|$|E

25|$|In <b>bright</b> <b>sun</b> it is a {{very active}} little {{butterfly}} with the males setting up small territories which they will defend vigorously against rival males or indeed any unlucky passing insect. Even the shadow of a large bird passing overhead is enough to elicit a response. Females are pursued and mating usually occurs in vegetation.|$|E
500|$|The canals, drawbridges, windmills, {{thatched}} cottages and expansive {{fields of}} the Arles countryside reminded Van Gogh {{of his life in}} the Netherlands. Arles brought him the solace and <b>bright</b> <b>sun</b> that he sought for himself and conditions to explore painting with more vivid colors, intense color contrasts and varied brushstrokes. [...] He also returned to the roots of his artistic training from the Netherlands, most notably {{with the use of a}} reed pen for his drawings.|$|E
500|$|The {{young soldier}} is {{unaware of what}} is happening, at first – he asks why the bugles are blowing, and why the Sergeant looks so pale, but is told that Deever is being hanged, and that the {{regiment}} is drawn up in [...] "ollow square" [...] to see it. He presses the Sergeant further, in the second verse – why are people breathing so hard? why are some men collapsing? These signs of the effect that watching the hanging has upon {{the men of the}} regiment are explained away by the Sergeant as being due to the cold weather or the <b>bright</b> <b>sun.</b> The voice is reassuring, keeping the young soldier calm in the sight of death, just as the Sergeant will calm him with his voice in combat. In the third verse, Files thinks of Deever, saying that he slept alongside him, and drank with him, but the Sergeant reminds him that Deever is now alone, that he sleeps [...] "out an' far to-night", and reminds the soldier of the magnitude of Deever's crime – ...|$|E

2500|$|The Boston Terrier is {{characteristically}} {{marked with}} white {{in proportion to}} either black, brindle, seal (color of a wet seal, a very dark brown that looks black except in the <b>bright</b> <b>sun),</b> {{or a combination of}} the three. Any other color is not accepted as a Boston Terrier by the American Kennel Club, as they are usually obtained by crossbreeding with other breeds and the dog loses its characteristic [...] "tuxedo" [...] appearance.|$|E

The {{official}} logo of the First Asiad depicted a <b>bright</b> <b>sun</b> in red with 16 rays {{and a white}} circle {{in the middle of}} the disc of the sun and eleven rings, representing each participating nation, on a white background, symbolising peace. [...] Japanese athletes won the most golds and overall medals, with 24 and 60 respectively; while the host nation India had the 15 golds and 51 overall medals with most bronzes (20) and finished at second spot in a medal table. The next Asian Games organised by India were the 1982 Asian Games, some 31 years later.|$|E
2500|$|Early {{one morning}} Kurnaz was given new orange overalls, {{and his head}} was bound in a gas mask, his ears covered with {{soundproof}} headphones, and his eyes with thick black diving goggles. His hands were put in mittens. Blindfolded and so tightly handcuffed that circulation was cut off, he was punched in the face, kicked in the genitals, and left on the ground. Some hours later Kurnaz and others were chained together and herded onto a plane. [...] During the long flight, the prisoners {{were not allowed to}} sleep: [...] "the soldiers kept hitting us to keep us awake." [...] The feel of <b>bright</b> <b>sun</b> and extreme heat showed him that he had arrived in a different country.|$|E

6000|$|The Florentine, {{eager to}} taste his new liberty, left his companions awhile, and strolled away through the {{celestial}} forest, whose thick and lively verdure gave coolness to the senses {{in the midst}} of the <b>brightest</b> <b>sun.</b> A fragrance came from every part of the soil; a sweet unintermitting air streamed against the walker's face; and as the full-hearted birds, warbling on all sides, welcomed the morning's radiance into the trees, the trees themselves joined in the concert with a swelling breath, like that which rises among the pines of Chiassi, when Eolus lets loose the south-wind, and the gathering melody comes rolling through the forest from bough to bough.[53] ...|$|R
