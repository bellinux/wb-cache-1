5|$|The Russian Air Force, which {{operates}} {{the largest number}} of Su-25s, planned to upgrade older aircraft to the Su-25SM variant, but funding shortfalls had slowed the progress; by early 2007 only seven aircraft had <b>been</b> <b>modified.</b>|$|E
5|$|The clouds {{may show}} a large variety of {{different}} patterns and forms. An identification scheme was developed by Fogle in 1970 that classified five different forms. These classifications have since <b>been</b> <b>modified</b> and subdivided.|$|E
5000|$|Depending on context, a {{particular}} noun could <b>be</b> <b>modified</b> by either a restrictive or nonrestrictive adjective clause. For example, while [...] "broccoli" [...] <b>is</b> <b>modified</b> nonrestrictively {{in the preceding}} sentence, it <b>is</b> <b>modified</b> restrictively in the following.|$|R
5000|$|... 3. Stencil Function passes/Depth Function passes: [...] If say func is GL_ALWAYS, the stencil {{test will}} always pass. If depth test also passes. Both Color/Depth buffer <b>are</b> <b>modified.</b> Stencil buffer <b>is</b> <b>modified</b> as per glStencilOp zpass. If say, glStencilOp(GL_KEEP, GL_KEEP, GL_KEEP) then Stencil values are not changed, only Color and Depth buffers <b>are</b> <b>modified.</b>|$|R

5|$|Although the RF-4M {{would have}} had some advantages, it was {{discounted}} as the cost would have been greater, with consequently fewer aircraft purchased, while only those that had <b>been</b> <b>modified</b> {{would have been able}} to undertake the reconnaissance mission. Ultimately, the RAF chose the standard F-4M and external pod, which allowed all of its aircraft to perform all designated roles.|$|E
5|$|Bristol has a {{long history}} of trade, {{originally}} exporting wool cloth and importing fish, wine, grain and dairy products; later imports were tobacco, tropical fruits and plantation goods. Major imports are motor vehicles, grain, timber, produce and petroleum products. Since the 13th century, the rivers have <b>been</b> <b>modified</b> for docks; during the 1240s, the Frome was diverted into a deep, man-made channel (known as Saint Augustine's Reach) which flowed into the River Avon.|$|E
5|$|However, Chase had {{designed}} the aircraft {{to allow for}} the easy installation of engines; the first XG-20 had already <b>been</b> <b>modified</b> with two radial piston engines, becoming the XC-123, the prototype of the long-serving C-123 Provider family of transports. Meanwhile, the second prototype XG-20 was returned to Chase Aircraft, to be fitted with two twin pods for General Electric J47 turbojets, becoming the XC-123A, the first jet-powered transport aircraft built in the United States.|$|E

Each spinneret has many spigots, {{each of which is}} connected to one silk gland. There are at least six types of silk gland, each producing a different type of silk.|$|E
5|$|The eastern ends of English cathedrals show {{a greater}} {{diversity}} {{than those of}} any other country. Those built in the Norman era had high apsidal ends surrounded by a lower ambulatory, as is typical of Northern France. This arrangement still exists at Norwich and in part at Peterborough and also, with variation, in the Early English Gothic east end at Canterbury, but in every other case has <b>been</b> <b>modified.</b>|$|E

5|$|The rows of {{buildings}} {{on either side}} of Market Street are punctuated periodically by large access gates that lead to the space behind the buildings, gates that are wide enough to drive a horse and cart through. The town's straight planned streets are a common feature in many Plantation towns, and its industrial history is still evident in the presence of many former linen mills that have since <b>been</b> <b>modified</b> for modern use.|$|E

5|$|After {{the ship}} arrived in Invergordon, Baden was {{carefully}} examined by Royal Navy technicians. Naval engineers inspected the hull, including the screws, bilge keels, and rudders, {{to determine the}} water resistance of the hull form. The ship {{was found to have}} been approximately as efficient as the British s. The ship's armor system was extensively investigated; the British team concluded that the ship had not <b>been</b> <b>modified</b> to incorporate the lessons from the Battle of Jutland of 31 May– 1 June 1916.|$|E

5|$|Among Motul de San José and {{its most}} {{important}} satellite La Trinidad de Nosotros, the majority of remains from Trinidad were from aquatic species, while at Motul de San José the majority were from terrestrial species. 10% of animal remains from Motul had <b>been</b> <b>modified</b> to form artefacts, compared with only 4% of animal remains at Trinidad. Artefact remains found at La Trinidad de Nosotros {{were more likely to}} be waste products from artefact manufacture while at Motul de San José they {{were more likely to be}} artefacts at the end of their usable life. Aquatic animal products arriving at Motul de San José were far more likely to be consumed by the elite than by commoners, whether used as food or to craft artefacts.|$|E
