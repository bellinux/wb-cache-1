González-Barahona y Gregorio Robles MartínezThe open {{nature of}} FLOSS (Free/Libre/Open Source Software) {{projects}} has brought {{new ways of}} analyzing from different perspectives how software is developed. FLOSS projects represent {{a significant portion of}} the empirical academic literature. One of the main characteristics of these projects is the distributed environment of work. This implies specific infrastructure to keep communicated developers in order to work all together and make decisions. In addition, the traditional hierarchical structures found in enterprises are now being moved by the flatter structures of the libre software communities where meritocracy is in most of the cases the key to be listened to. One of those innovative ways of doing research is related to the mining of software repositories where traces of the activity is kept and publicly available to anyone interested. This also brings positive consequences in contrast to traditional research and this is the possibility to replicate other studies. This thesis, among other goals aims to provide as much information as possible to be consequently replicated and raise, if proceed, as much discussion among researchers as possible and being as useful as possible to some others. Regarding to the analysis carried out in this dissertation, this is focused on the better understanding of the bug life cycle and human related factors that may be more prone to introduce errors in the source code. Specifically, this will play with the concept of <b>bug</b> <b>seeding</b> that is the event of involuntary introduce an error in the source code that later will be discovered and fixed (bug fixing commit). Understanding when a bug was introduced, where exactly in the source code and by whom, opens new research questions that stress the point of looking for potential causes of that involuntary bug introduction event. Although others could have been studied, this dissertation has focused on two potentially buggy attributes of developers that may help them to be less or more prone to introduce errors: experience and the time of the day. With respect to the main contributions, from our best known, this is the first study where the concept of <b>bug</b> <b>seeding</b> commits is used to study the bug life cycle: studying the time to fix a bug from its very beginning (when it was seeded), resultant distributions, comparison to the time to other similar studies focused on the bug tracking system, finding rate of the buggy commits and study of the defective fixing changes. In addition, once the bug life cycle was studied, this dissertation looked for potential human related factors that might be more prone to be buggy. Among other results, on the contrary to other similar and previous literature, no relationship between the experience of a developer and the quality of the changes was found. Regarding to the time of the day to fix a bug, specific timeframes of the day were found to be more prone to introduce errors than others. Sistemas Telemáticos y Computació...|$|E

30|$|Forrest and Weimer have {{recently}} investigated {{the benefits of}} “synthesizing diversity” by generating neutral software variants. A software variant {{is said to be}} neutral with respect to a suite of test cases if it passes all the same test cases as the original program. Neutral software variants have been shown to repair <b>bugs</b> experimentally <b>seeded</b> into test programs[12]. When program variants evolved by GP were evaluated on the tests that had been removed from the original test suite, an average of 19 out of 5000 variants passed {{one or more of the}} tests. In other words, the variants had repaired some of the <b>seeded</b> <b>bugs</b> by chance.

40|$|Abstract A {{large number}} of {{proteins}} in salivary gland extracts of the leaffooted pine <b>seed</b> <b>bug,</b> Leptoglossus corculus Say, were strongly recognized by a polyclonal antibody-based assay developed for detecting saliva of the western conifer <b>seed</b> <b>bug.</b> Lepfoglossus occidentalis Heidemann, in lodgepole pine, Pinus contorta var. lafifolia Engelmann, seeds. An average of approximately 85 % of loblolly pine, Pinus faeda L., seeds exposed to feeding by L. corculus for 1 to 4 weeks in the laboratory contained detectable amounts of salivary proteins when the antibody assays were performed weekly on samples (n = 10) of seed. In comparison, radiography of exposed seed detected an average of approximately 63 % damaged seed over the same 4 -wk period, indicating that the antibody assay increased sensitivity of damage detection by approximately one-third. Depletion of insoluble polypeptides and proliferation of soluble polypeptides 523. 5 kDa was apparent after SDS-PAGE and quantitative assays were performed on proteins extracted from seeds that were damaged by exposure to L. corculus feeding.

40|$|Factors {{involved}} in the mechanism of soybean resistance to pod sucking bug R. linearis were identified using resistant soybean genotypes, IAC- 100, and IAC- 80 - 596 - 2 and the susceptible variety, Wilis as a check. The role of trichomes in resistance was assayed removing trichomes from the pod shell, and seed coat and the resistance was determined {{based on the number}} of stylet punctures made by the <b>bug.</b> <b>Seed</b> of IAC- 100 and IAC- 596 - 2 that had longer, denser trichomes, higher crude fiber content and suffered fewer stylet punctures than Wilis. This suggested that denser and longer trichomes interfered with stylet piercing of the pod shell. When the trichomes of IAC- 100 and IAC- 596 - 2 were removed these genotypes were more susceptible to insect feeding. In further studies, replacement of IAC- 100 and IAC- 596 - 2 seed with seed of Wilis in the pods of resistant genotypes resulted less stylet punctures on the Wilis seed. It was concluded that denser and longer trichomes on pods along with harder pod shells acts as a physical barrier in antixenosis resistance of soybean to the pod sucking bug. Therefore, IAC- 100, and IAC- 596 - 2 genotypes have good potential for used as resistant parents in a soybean breeding program...|$|R

40|$|Summary The {{impact of}} feeding {{by the western}} conifer <b>seed</b> <b>bug</b> (Leptoglossus occidentalis Heidemann) on storage re-serves of {{developing}} seeds of Douglas-fir (Pseudostuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) was studied by caging nymphal and adult <b>seed</b> <b>bugs</b> on cones during late-season development, and nymphs on cones during early, mid- and late-season develop-ment. Analysis of the major storage reserves of partially dam-aged seeds revealed that late-season feeding by each life stage and feeding by nymphs at all three stages of cone development significantly reduced the amounts of lipid and buffer-insoluble (crystalloid) protein in seeds at harvest by up to 78 and 97 %, re-spectively. Seeds showing light to moderate damage on radio-graphs did not exhibit {{a reduction in the}} amount of buffer-soluble (matrix) protein. Seeds damaged by feeding during early development compensated in part by continuing to synthesize lipid and crystalloid protein. Light or moderate damage to mature Douglas-fir seeds exposed to L. occidentalis in the laboratory reduced seedling emergence by> 80 %, but the seedlings that emerged successfully appeared to suffer no adverse effects when grown under standard nursery condi-tions...|$|R
50|$|In southeastern New Mexico, staples (comprising {{at least}} 5% of scaled quail diet in both summer and winter) were {{mesquite}} and croton (Croton spp.) seeds, green vegetation, and snout beetles. Nonpreferred foods eaten {{in winter and}} available but not consumed in summer included broom snakeweed (the main winter food), crown-beard (Verbesina encelioides), cycloloma (Cycloloma atriplicifolium), and lace <b>bugs.</b> Mesquite <b>seeds</b> and broom snakeweed seeds together made up 75% of the winter diet. Grasshoppers were a summer staple. Insect galls, cicadas, scarab beetles, spurge (Euphorbia spp.), plains bristlegrass (Setaria macrostachya) seeds, and white ratany (Krameria grayi) were consumed in a less pronounced seasonal pattern. Another study reported substantial amounts of prairie sunflower seeds (Helianthus petiolaris) and pigweed (Amaranthus spp.) seeds in the diet of scaled quail.|$|R

40|$|Whitebark pine, Pinus albicaulis Engelm. is an {{important}} but declining high-elevation tree species in western forests. Regeneration of this species has been difficult {{and the impact of}} cone and seed insects unknown. Seven sites selected from the geographical range of whitebark pine in Idaho, Montana, Washington, Oregon, and California were examined for cone and seed insects and their impact. Ten different insect species were found affecting various reproductive structures of whitebark pine. Insects having the greatest impact across most sites were fir coneworm (Dioryctria abietivorella (Grote)) and western conifer <b>seed</b> <b>bug</b> (Leptoglossus occidentalis Heidemann).
