5|$|Year 1346 (MCCCXLVI) was {{a common}} year {{starting}} on Sunday (link will display the full calendar) of the Julian calendar. It was {{a year in the}} 14th century, {{in the midst of a}} period known in European history as the Late Middle Ages. In Asia that year, the <b>Black</b> <b>Plague</b> came to the troops of the Golden Horde Khanate; the disease also affected the Genoese Europeans they were attacking, before spreading to the rest of Europe. In Central and East Asia, there was a series of revolts after Kazan Khan was killed in an uprising, and the Chagatai Khanate began to splinter and fall; several revolts in China began what would eventually lead to the overthrow of the Yuan dynasty. The Indian kingdom of Vijayanagara won several victories over Muslim conquerors in the north in this year as well.|$|E
25|$|In 1345, the Golden Horde made {{a second}} attempt to lay siege on the Genoese city of Kaffa. (An earlier attempt had failed because Kaffa {{was able to}} get {{provisions}} across the Black Sea.) The 1345 siege would fail in the following year as the Mongols were struck with the <b>Black</b> <b>Plague</b> and forced to retreat. This siege is therefore noted as one of the key events that brought the <b>Black</b> <b>Plague</b> to Europe.|$|E
25|$|Yersinia pestis is {{in effect}} a strain of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, but with a {{pathogenicity}} island that confers a drastically different pathology (<b>Black</b> <b>plague</b> and tuberculosis-like symptoms respectively) which arose 15,000 to 20,000 years ago.|$|E
50|$|Bosnia and Herzegovina, {{along with}} most of Europe, {{experienced}} a resurgence of the <b>Black</b> Death <b>plague</b> in the 18th century. Bašeskija chronicled the lives of 4,000 of the dead, mostly adult Bosniaks.|$|R

25|$|The <b>Black</b> <b>plague</b> {{affected}} Erdington severely {{as indicated}} in the 14th century local records. Henry de Pipe, owner of the Manor of Pipe (now Pype Hayes Hall), lost his wife and all but one child. His second wife, Maud, {{was the daughter of}} George de Castello of Castle Bromwich.

25|$|William of Ockham (1285–1350), Doctor Invincibilis, was an English Franciscan friar, philosopher, logician and theologian. Ockham {{defended the}} {{principle}} of parsimony, which could already {{be seen in the}} works of his mentor Duns Scotus. His principle later became known as Occam's Razor and states that if there are various equally valid explanations for a fact, then the simplest one should be chosen. This became a foundation of what would {{come to be known as}} the scientific method and one of the pillars of reductionism in science. Ockham probably died of the <b>Black</b> <b>Plague.</b> Jean Buridan and Nicole Oresme were his followers.|$|E
25|$|Also in England in 1345, Princess Joan was betrothed to Pedro of Castile, son of Alfonso XI of Castile and Maria of Portugal. She {{would never}} marry him, however, but would die of the <b>Black</b> <b>Plague</b> on her journey to Spain to meet him. Spain, meanwhile, {{continued}} its struggle to regain Muslim territory on the Iberian Peninsula. In {{that same year}} Alfonso XI attacked Gibraltar {{as a part of}} the Reconquista, but was unable to conquer it. In 1345 Muhammud V was made its ruler. The York Minster Cathedral, the largest Gothic cathedral in northern Europe, was completed in this year as well. It remains the largest in the region to this day. England was still recovering from French occupation. Until 1345, all school instruction had been in French, rather than English.|$|E
25|$|Besides the War of Succession and the Hundred Years' War, France was in {{the midst}} of an {{interesting}} period. Several decades earlier, the Roman Papacy had moved to Avignon and would not return to Rome for another 33 years. The Avignon Papacy was then ruled by Pope Clement VI, who was aiding the French in their war against the English with Church funds. Also, in the year 1345, the famous Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris was completed after nearly two centuries of planning and construction. On 24 March, a man named Guy de Chauliac observed a strange astronomical sign: the planets Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars conjoined in the sky under the sign of Aquarius. That same day the area experienced a solar eclipse. This sign was interpreted as foreboding by many, and Chauliac would later blame it for the <b>Black</b> <b>Plague,</b> which arrived less than five years later.|$|E

25|$|Mamluk Egypt {{was a major}} {{producer}} of textiles and a supplier of raw materials for Western Europe. However, the frequent outbreaks of the <b>Black</b> <b>Plague</b> led {{to a decline in}} the Mamluk territories' production of goods such as textiles, silk products, sugar, glass, soaps, and paper, which coincided with the Europeans' increasing production of these goods. Trade continued nonetheless and despite papal restrictions on trade with the Muslims during the Crusades. Mediterranean trade was dominated by spices, such as pepper, muscat nuts and flowers, cloves and cinnamon, as well as medicinal drugs and indigo. These goods originated in Persia, India, and Southeast Asia and made their way to Europe via the Mamluk ports of Syria and Egypt. These ports were frequented by European merchants, who in turn sold gold and silver ducats and bullions, silk, wool and linen fabrics, furs, wax, honey and cheeses.|$|E
25|$|Sultans Baybars and Qalawun, and the Syrian viceroys of an-Nasir Muhammad {{during his}} first two reigns, emirs Salar and Baybars II, were averse to {{granting}} Bedouin sheikhs iqtaʿat, and when they did, the iqtaʿat were of low quality. However, during an-Nasir Muhammad's third reign, the Al Fadl were granted high-quality iqtaʿat in abundance, strengthening the tribe {{to become the most}} powerful among the Bedouin of the Syrian Desert region. Beyond his personal admiration of the Bedouin, an-Nasir Muhammad's motivation for distributing iqtaʿat to Al Fadl, especially under the leadership of Muhanna ibn Isa, was to prevent them from defecting to the Ilkhanate, which their leaders had done frequently {{in the first half of}} the 14th century. Competition over iqtaʿat and the post of amir al-ʿarab among the Bedouin tribes of Syria, particularly the Al Fadl, led to conflict and rebellion among the two tribes and other Bedouin, leading to mass bloodshed in Syria in the aftermath of an-Nasir Muhammad's death. The Mamluk leadership in Syria, weakened by the losses of the <b>Black</b> <b>Plague,</b> was unable to quell the Bedouin through military expeditions, so they resolved to assassinate the sheikhs of the tribes. including those of Upper Egypt. The Al Fadl tribe eventually lost favor, while the Bedouin tribes of al-Karak were strengthened by the later Bahri sultans.|$|E
25|$|In 1348, {{while the}} <b>black</b> <b>plague</b> ravaged Europe, the Alcazaba and the castle of Gibralfaro took their final shape. The city had several gates that allowed {{passage through the}} walls, some of which still stand today, such as the Puerta Oscura (Dark Gate) and the Puerta del Mar (Sea Gate). Looming over the port, the Alcazaba was the Moorish citadel built on the hill called Mount Gibralfaro in {{the centre of the}} city, on whose summit was the castle. The citadel and the castle were {{connected}} by a corridor known as La Coracha between two zig-zagging walls that followed the contours of the land. Erected in the 11th century, the Alcazaba combined defensive fortifications with residential palaces and inner gardens; it was fortified with three walls towards the sea, and two facing the town. Antonio de Nebrija counted, in the circumference of the castle, 110 large towers, besides a great number of turrets. The same walls also enclosed the whole compound, though each building had its own entrance. The Puerta de los Arcos (Gate of the Arch) of the Torre del Tinel (Tower of Tinel) was the entrance to the Nasrid palace in the enclosure dating to the 13th and 14th centuries. Remnants of the old city wall remain today in Calle Alamos and Calle Carreteria.|$|E

25|$|If {{the first}} {{inhabitants}} of the Faroe Islands were Irish monks, then they must have lived as a very small group of settlers. Later, when the Vikings colonised the islands, there was a considerable increase in the population. However, it never exceeded 5,000 until the 19th century. Around 1349, about half the population perished in the <b>Black</b> Death <b>plague.</b>|$|R

500|$|Korn {{begins with}} [...] "Blind", {{starting}} with the dueling riffs of James Shaffer and Brian Welch. Lead vocalist Jonathan Davis' first line is [...] "Are you ready?!", which {{is now one of}} the band's trademarks. [...] "Blind" [...] is about Davis' drug problems (mostly amphetamines) and how he would feel scattered when he was under the influence. Davis told Metal Hammer that on the album's second track, [...] "Ball Tongue", he [...] "didn't sing a goddamn word in that song. I couldn't describe what I wanted to do, so that's how it came out. It's a really heavy sound." [...] "Ball Tongue" [...] is about a man had to work with Korn on a T-shirt design. He either had a pierced tongue or had a wart on his tongue and he gave Korn a really hard time. [...] "Shoots and Ladders" [...] is about how many nursery rhymes have dark meanings. The song explores the concept of nursery rhymes. Davis relates: [...] "'Shoots and Ladders' uncovers the hidden messages in nursery rhymes, the first songs many of us ever hear. 'Shoots and Ladders', to set the record straight, calls out nursery rhymes for what they really are. I choose each rhyme for a different reason—'Baa Baa Black Sheep' has racist overtones. 'London Bridge' talks of all the people of London dying (from the <b>Black</b> <b>Plague,</b> as does 'Ring Around the Roses'). Then there's 'Little Red Riding Hood'—one story tells of the wolf raping Red Riding Hood and killing her." ...|$|E

In the autumn of 1348, the <b>Black</b> <b>Plague</b> reached England and {{decimated}} the population.
