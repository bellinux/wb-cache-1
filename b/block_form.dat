25|$|Compressed tea, called tea bricks, tea cakes or tea lumps, and tea nuggets {{according}} to the shape and size, are blocks of whole or finely ground black tea, green tea, or post-fermented tea leaves that have been packed in molds and pressed into <b>block</b> <b>form.</b> This was the most commonly produced and used form of tea in ancient China prior to the Ming Dynasty. Although tea bricks are less commonly produced in modern times, many post-fermented teas, such as pu-erh, are still commonly found in bricks, discs, and other pressed forms. Tea bricks can be made into beverages like tea or eaten as food, and were also {{used in the past}} as a form of currency.|$|E
25|$|The Chinese {{roots of}} Japanese {{calligraphy}} {{go back to}} the twenty-eighth century B.C., to a time when pictographs were inscribed on bone for religious purposes. When this writing developed into an instrument of administration for the state, the need for a uniform script was felt and Li Si, prime minister in the Chinese dynasty of Qin, standardized a script and its way of being written. He sanctioned a form of script based on squares of uniform size into which all characters could be written from eight strokes. He also devised rules of composition where horizontal strokes are written first and characters are composed starting from top to bottom, left to right. Because the symbols were inscribed with sharp instruments, the lines were originally angular and in many ways Li Si's achievements were made obsolete by the appearance of brush and ink (see Chinese calligraphy). The ink-wet brush creates a line quite different from a sharp stylus. It affords variation in thickness and curve of line. Calligraphy retained the <b>block</b> <b>form</b> of Li Si and his eight strokes but the writer was free to create characters that emphasized aesthetically pleasing balance and form. The way a character was written gave a message of style.|$|E
500|$|Glide waxes {{enhance the}} speed of the gliding surface, and are applied by ironing them onto the ski and then {{polishing}} the ski bottom. [...] Three classes of glide wax are available, depending on the level of desired performance with higher performance coming at higher cost. [...] Hydrocarbon glide waxes, based on paraffin are common for recreational use. [...] Race waxes comprise a combination of fluorinated hydrocarbon waxes and fluorocarbon overlays. [...] Fluorocarbons decrease surface tension and surface area of the water between the ski and the snow, increasing speed and glide of the ski under specific conditions. Either combined with the wax or applied after in a spray, powder, or <b>block</b> <b>form,</b> fluorocarbons significantly improve the glide of the ski and are widely used in cross-country ski races.|$|E

6000|$|... § XXI. One step more: I take a mid-cusped {{side piece}} in its <b>block</b> <b>form</b> at t, with the bricks which load {{the back of}} it. Now, as these bricks support it behind, and since, {{as far as the}} use of the cusp is concerned, it matters not whether its weight be in marble or bricks, there is nothing to hinder us from cutting out some of the marble, as at u, and filling up the space with bricks. (Why we should take a fancy to do this, I do not pretend to guess at present; all I have to assert is, that, if the fancy should strike us, there would be no harm in it). Substituting this side piece for the other in the window n, we have that at w, which may, perhaps, be of some service to us afterwards; here we have nothing more to do with it than to note that, thus built, and {{properly}} backed by brickwork, it is just as strong and safe a form as that at n; but that this, as well as every variety of ogee arch, depends entirely for its safety, fitness, and beauty, on the masonry which we have just analysed; and that, built on a large scale, and with many voussoirs, all such arches would be unsafe and absurd in general architecture. Yet they may be used occasionally {{for the sake of the}} exquisite beauty of which their rich and fantastic varieties admit, and sometimes for the sake of another merit, exactly the opposite of the constructional ones we are at present examining, that they seem to stand by enchantment.|$|E
