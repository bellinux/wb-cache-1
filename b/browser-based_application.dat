40|$|This paper {{describes}} the design, implementation {{and evaluation of}} Native Client, a sandbox for untrusted x 86 native code. Native Client aims to give <b>browser-based</b> <b>applications</b> the computational performance of native applications without compromising safety. Native Client uses software fault isolation and a secure runtime to direct system interaction and side effects through interfaces managed by Native Client. Native Client provides operating system portability for binary code while supporting performance-oriented features generally absent from web application programming environments, such as thread support, instruction set extensions such as SSE, and use of compiler intrinsics and hand-coded assembler. We combine these properties in an open architecture that encourages community review and 3 rd-party tools. 1...|$|R

5000|$|On December 1, 2008, Good OS {{announced}} its next operating system, Cloud. Cloud {{can be described}} as an [...] "instant-on <b>browser-based</b> <b>application</b> environment". With Cloud, users can browse the Internet seconds after turning on their computer, and can also use it to run applications, like Skype, or a media player. Cloud shows a Dock similar to gOS 3 in the browser window, and will keep loading the main operating system (Windows, Linux, OSX) in the background. An icon in the Dock will tell the user when the main OS has finished booting in the background, and can be used to switch instantly to the main OS, when tasks not (yet) supported under Cloud are needed. A beta test program for Cloud version 1.0 was announced January 30, 2009.|$|E

40|$|Location-based {{services}} {{are becoming increasingly}} Web-based, {{as a result of}} the availability of networked mobile devices and mobile Internet access. The "Location and the Web (LocWeb) " workshop targets the capabilities and constraints of Web-based location-based services, which can be implemented as <b>browser-based</b> <b>applications,</b> or as native applications using Web services. The focus of this CHI workshop is on approaches which handle the complexity of location-based services, specifically looking at location abstractions, location sharing, context-relevant information, privacy issues, and interface and interaction design. The goal of this workshop is to serve as a starting point for attaining a better understanding of how the Web has to change in order to embrace location as a first-level concept, and how these changes might be reflected in applications and user interfaces that transform the Web into a platform for location-based services...|$|R
40|$|Constraints {{provide a}} useful {{technique}} for ensuring that desired properties hold in an application. As a result, {{they have been}} used {{in a wide range of}} applications, including graphical layout, simulation, scheduling, and problem-solving. We describe the design and implementation of an Object Constraint Programming language, an object-oriented language that cleanly integrates constraints with the underlying language in a way that respects encapsulation and standard object-oriented programming techniques, and that runs in <b>browser-based</b> <b>applications.</b> Prior work on Object Constraint Programming languages has relied on modifying the underlying Virtual Machine, but that is not an option for web-based applications, which have become increasingly prominent. In this paper, we present an approach to implementing Ob-ject Constraint Programming without Virtual Machine support, along with an implementation as a JavaScript extension. We demonstrate the resulting language, Babelsberg/JS, on a number of applications an...|$|R
