(Some manufacturers also lightly grind the faces to get them smoother.) But even with that the machining process leaves peaks and valleys {{on the surface of}} the steel. When a new [...] "out of the box" [...] coupling is initially engaged most peaks on both mating surfaces touch which means that the potential contact area can be significantly reduced.

40|$|Abstract. Because of {{the great}} speed range in a {{finishing}} block of a wire rod mill, the reduction of torsional vibrations {{makes it possible to}} achieve closer rolling tolerances. The components transmitting the torque like gear <b>box,</b> <b>coupling</b> etc. can generate non-smooth or alternating torques which affect the product quality. To study the influences of torsion vibrations on the product quality, the dynamic interactions of the block and rolling process are simultaneously analyzed by a simulation model. As an example, a three stand arrangement is considered. The real transmission system is idealized as a structurally discrete torsional vibration model. The generalized rotational coordinates with a large number of rotational degrees of freedom can be reduced among others constants by means of gear ratios. Euler-Lagrange equations are applied to create the coupled equations of motion, which together constitute an ordinary differential equation of order 28. The rolling and main drive torques are defined as excitation for vibration {{on the right side of}} the equation system. A DC motor is selected as main drive and the voltage circuit equation of motor is integrated into the system of differential equations. The armature current and its interaction are consequently simulated. The rotational speed of rolls and motor, as well as roll torques, longitudinal stresses in rod and section widths are shown in diagrams as the result and thereby the torsional vibration of the essential elements of the system are studied for different temperatures and cross-sectional variations...|$|E

By treating the oscillator as a probe through the backreaction effect of the qubit on the oscillator circuit, we extract frequency splitting features analogous to the Autler-Townes effect from quantum optics, thereby extending the analogies between superconducting and quantum optical phenomenology. These features are found in a frequency band that avoids the need for high frequency measurement systems and therefore may be of use in qubit characterization and coupling schemes. In addition we find this frequency band can be adjusted to suit an experimental frequency regime by changing the oscillator frequency.

5000|$|In quantum computing, {{a charge}} qubit is a qubit whose basis states are charge states (e.g. states which {{represent}} {{the presence or}} absence of excess Cooper pairs in the island). In superconducting quantum computing, a charge qubit is formed by a tiny superconducting island (also known as a Cooper-pair <b>box)</b> <b>coupled</b> by a Josephson junction to a superconducting reservoir (see figure). The state of the qubit is determined by the number of Cooper pairs which have tunneled across the junction. In contrast with the charge state of an atomic or molecular ion, the charge states of such an [...] "island" [...] involve a macroscopic number of conduction electrons of the island. The quantum superposition of charge states can be achieved by tuning the gate voltage U that controls the chemical potential of the island. The charge qubit is typically read-out by electrostatically coupling the island to an extremely sensitive electrometer such as the radio-frequency single-electron transistor.|$|R

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the decoherence of quantum states in two Al/AlOx/Al Cooper-pair <b>boxes</b> <b>coupled</b> to lumped element superconducting LC resonators. At 25 mK, the first qubit had an energy relaxation time T 1 that varied from 30 us to 200 us between 4 and 8 GHz and displayed an inverse correlation between T 1 and the coupling to the microwave drive line. The Ramsey fringe decay times T 2 * were in the 200 - 500 ns range while the spin echo envelope decay times Techo varied from 2. 4 - 3. 3 us, consistent with 1 /f charge noise with a high frequency cutoff of 0. 2 MHz. A second Cooper-pair box qubit with similar parameters showed T 1 = 4 - 30 us between 4 - 7. 3 GHz, and that the T 1 and the coupling were again inversely correlated. Although the lifetime of the second device was shorter {{than that of the}} first device, the dependence on coupling in both devices suggests that further reduction in coupling should lead to improved qubit performance.

40|$|The {{charging}} of {{a quantum}} <b>box,</b> <b>coupled</b> to a lead by tunneling through a single resonant level, is studied near the degeneracy {{points of the}} Coulomb blockade. Combining Wilson's numerical renormalization-group method with perturbative scaling approaches, the corresponding low-energy Hamiltonian is solved for arbitrary temperatures, gate voltages, tunneling rates, and energies of the impurity level. Similar {{to the case of}} a weak tunnel barrier, the shape of the charge step is governed at low temperatures by the non-Fermi-liquid fixed point of the two-channel Kondo effect. However, the associated Kondo temperature TK is strongly modified. Most notably, TK is proportional to the width of the level if the transmission through the impurity is close to unity at the Fermi energy, and is no longer exponentially small in one over the tunneling matrix element. Focusing on a particle-hole symmetric level, the two-channel Kondo effect is found to be robust against the inclusion of an on-site repulsion on the level. For a large on-site repulsion and a large asymmetry in the tunneling rates to box and to the lead, there is a sequence of Kondo effects: first the local magnetic moment that forms on the level undergoes single-channel screening, followed by two-channel overscreening of the charge fluctuations inside the box.
