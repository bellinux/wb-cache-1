25|$|Flaming {{is done to}} {{loops and}} straight-wires in {{microbiology}} labs. Leaving the loop in the flame of a <b>Bunsen</b> <b>burner</b> or alcohol lamp until it glows red ensures that any infectious agent is inactivated. This is commonly used for small metal or glass objects, but not for large objects (see Incineration below). However, during the initial heating infectious material may be sprayed from the wire surface before it is killed, contaminating nearby surfaces and objects. Therefore, special heaters have been developed that surround the inoculating loop with a heated cage, ensuring that such sprayed material does not further contaminate the area. Another problem is that gas flames may leave carbon or other residues on the object if the object is not heated enough. A variation on flaming is to dip the object in 70% or higher ethanol, then briefly touch the object to a <b>Bunsen</b> <b>burner</b> flame. The ethanol will ignite and burn off rapidly, leaving less residue than a gas flame.|$|E
25|$|Another type plating out organisms, next to streaking, on {{agar plates}} is the spot {{analysis}}. This type of analysis {{is often used}} to check the viability of cells and performed with pinners (often also called froggers). A third used technique is the use of sterile, glass, beads to plate out cells. In this technique cells are grown in a liquid culture of which a small volume is pipetted on the agar plate and then spread out with the sterile, glass beads. Replicate plating is another technique in order to plate out cells on agar plates. These four techniques are the most used ones, but others are also possible. It is crucial to work in a sterile manner in order to prevent contamination on the agar plates. Plating is thus often done in a laminar flow cabinet or on the working bench next to a <b>bunsen</b> <b>burner.</b>|$|E

2500|$|As a chemist, Faraday {{discovered}} benzene, {{investigated the}} clathrate hydrate of chlorine, invented an early {{form of the}} <b>Bunsen</b> <b>burner</b> and the system of oxidation numbers, and popularised terminology such as [...] "anode", [...] "cathode", [...] "electrode" [...] and [...] "ion".

2500|$|In a {{laboratory}} under normal gravity conditions {{and with a}} closed oxygen valve, a <b>Bunsen</b> <b>burner</b> burns with yellow flame (also called a safety flame) at around [...] This is due to incandescence of very fine soot particles that are produced in the flame. With increasing oxygen supply, less black body-radiating soot is produced due to a more complete combustion and the reaction creates enough energy to excite and ionize gas molecules in the flame, leading to a blue appearance. The spectrum of a premixed (complete combustion) butane flame on the right shows that the blue color arises specifically due to emission of excited molecular radicals in the flame, which emit most of their light well below ≈565 nanometers in the blue and green regions of the visible spectrum.|$|E
60|$|Holmes {{was seated}} at his side-table clad in his dressing-gown, and working hard over a {{chemical}} investigation. A large curved retort was boiling furiously in the bluish flame of a <b>Bunsen</b> <b>burner,</b> and the distilled drops were condensing into a two-litre measure. My friend hardly glanced up as I entered, and I, seeing that his investigation must be of importance, seated myself in an arm-chair and waited. He dipped into this bottle or that, drawing {{out a few}} drops of each with his glass pipette, and finally brought a test-tube containing a solution over to the table. In his right hand he held a slip of litmus-paper.|$|E
6000|$|But {{he never}} really did experiments, except that in the class in {{systematic}} botany he sometimes made us tease common flowers to pieces. He did not do experiments if he could possibly help it, because {{in the first place}} they used up time and gas for the <b>Bunsen</b> <b>burner</b> and good material in a ruinous fashion, and in the second they were, in his rather careless and sketchy hands, apt to endanger the apparatus of the Institute and even the lives of his students. Then thirdly, real experiments involved washing up. And moreover they always turned out wrong, and sometimes misled the too observant learner very seriously and opened demoralising controversies. Quite early in life I acquired an almost ineradicable sense of the unscientific perversity of Nature and the impassable gulf that is fixed between systematic science and elusive fact. I knew, for example, that in science, whether it be subject XII., Organic Chemistry, or subject XVII., Animal Physiology, when you blow into a glass of lime-water it instantly becomes cloudy, and if you continue to blow it clears again, whereas in truth you may blow into the stuff from the lime-water bottle until you are crimson in the face and painful under the ears, and it never becomes cloudy at all. And I knew, too, that in science if you put potassium chlorate into a retort and heat it over a <b>Bunsen</b> <b>burner,</b> oxygen is disengaged and may be collected over water, whereas in real life if you do anything of the sort the vessel cracks with a loud report, the potassium chlorate descends sizzling upon the flame, the experimenter says [...] "Oh! Damn!" [...] with astonishing heartiness and distinctness, and a lady student in the back seats gets up and leaves the room.|$|E

6000|$|Its [...] "principal" [...] was a lean, long {{creature}} of indifferent digestion and temper, who proclaimed {{himself on a}} gilt-lettered board in his front garden George Garden Woodrow, F.S.Sc., letters indicating that he had paid certain guineas for a bogus diploma. A bleak white-washed outhouse constituted his schoolroom, and the scholastic quality of its carved and worn desks and forms was enhanced by a slippery blackboard and two large yellow out-of-date maps, one of Africa and the other of Wiltshire, that he had picked up cheap at a sale. There were other maps and globes in his study, where he interviewed inquiring parents, but these his pupils never saw. And in a glass cupboard in the passage was several shillingsworth of test tubes and chemicals, a tripod, a glass retort, and a damaged <b>Bunsen</b> <b>burner,</b> manifesting that the [...] "Scientific laboratory" [...] mentioned in the prospectus was no idle boast.|$|E
6000|$|Science is the {{organised}} {{conquest of}} Nature, and I can quite understand that ancient libertine refusing to co-operate {{in her own}} undoing. And I can quite understand, too, my father's preference {{for what he called}} an illustrative experiment, which was simply an arrangement of the apparatus {{in front of the class}} with nothing whatever by way of material, and the <b>Bunsen</b> <b>burner</b> clean and cool, and then a slow luminous description of just what you did put in it when you were so ill-advised as to carry the affair beyond illustration, and just exactly what ought anyhow to happen when you did. He had considerable powers of vivid expression, so that in this way he could make us see all he described. The class, freed from any unpleasant nervous tension, could draw this still life without flinching, and if any part was too difficult to draw, then my father would produce a simplified version on the blackboard to be copied instead. And he would also write on the blackboard any exceptionally difficult but grant-earning words, such as [...] "empyreumatic" [...] or [...] "botryoidal." ...|$|E
