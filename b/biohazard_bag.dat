50|$|At {{the scene}} of the car accident, Skinner tells Linden and Holder the girl had red hair and was badly injured. The driver says a man pursued the girl through the forest. Linden traces the girl's {{original}} path to find a red <b>biohazard</b> <b>bag</b> hanging on a tree. Back in the car, Linden and Holder interpret the empty <b>biohazard</b> <b>bag</b> as a sign the girl is still alive. They begin to canvas the area and the city looking for her.|$|E
40|$|All {{disposable}} lab ware {{contaminated with}} potentially biohazardous materials (blood, body fluids, human cell culture media, bacteria culture media, viruses, recombinant DNA, etc). Note: gloves, regardless of contaminated or not, and paper towels used for work surface or equipment decontamination must {{be disposed of}} in a clear autoclave bag or red <b>biohazard</b> <b>bag.</b> â€¢ Contaminated Pasteur pipettes should be disposed of in sharps container or autoclaved and discarded in a glass disposal box...|$|E
40|$|The LX 20 modular {{chemistry}} (BUNm) {{is used to}} quantitatively {{determine the}} concentration of blood urea nitrogen in serum or plasma {{by means of the}} enzymatic conductivity rate method. A precise volume of sample is injected into the urease reagent in a reaction cup containing an electrode that responds to changes in solution conductivity. Electronic circuits determine the rate of increase in conductivity, which is directly proportional to the concentration of urea in the sample. Urea nitrogen measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of certain renal and metabolic diseases in conjunction with creatinine measurements. 2. SAFETY PRECAUTIONS Consider all plasma or serum specimens potentially positive for infectious agents including HIV and the hepatitis B virus. We recommend the hepatitis B vaccination series for all analysts working with whole blood and/or plasma. Observe universal precautions; wear protective gloves, laboratory coats. Place disposable plastic, glass, and paper (pipette tips, gloves, etc.) that contact plasma and any residual sample material in a <b>biohazard</b> <b>bag</b> and keep these bags in appropriate containers until disposal by maceration chlorination. Wipe down all work surface...|$|E
5000|$|Linden visits Adrian's {{foster home}} and sees him happily {{playing in the}} backyard. She notices a drawing on his bedroom wall that is {{identical}} to the [...] "Picasso drawing" [...] in the Seward case file, except this drawing has buildings next to the grove of trees. She recognizes the buildings as the abandoned factory where the recent victim was found. Linden returns there with the new sketch. She matches the trees from the drawing with a nearby grove, then makes her way through the trees to discover a pond with scattered corpses rotting in <b>biohazard</b> <b>bags.</b>|$|R
5000|$|After Linden {{finds the}} pond {{containing}} decomposed bodies, Skinner debriefs {{a task force}} at the station: 17 bodies were found encased in <b>biohazard</b> <b>bags,</b> throats slashed or heads severed, all female teenagers. Ashley Kwon is confirmed as having likely been killed by the same person. Skinner presumes the killer may hold victims for several days before killing them. Holder mentions teenager Kallie Leeds (Cate Sproule) has recently gone missing. In Skinner's office, Linden suggests {{a connection to the}} Trisha Seward case. Skinner gives Linden a badge, welcoming her back, but is hesitant about re-opening the Seward case. In prison, Seward showers next to Alton (James Lewis), who asks about an [...] "A" [...] tattoo on Seward's chest. Becker (Hugh Dillon) says it's for Adrian (Rowan Longworth), Seward's son. Seward finds a razor blade planted in his soap and hides it inside his mouth.|$|R
40|$|Transporting {{animals from}} one {{location}} to another can be stressful to laboratory animals and {{can increase the}} potential for disease transmission or injury. Investigators and their staff transferring and/or transporting animals between facilities, animal housing rooms, investigators or protocols must complete certain forms to assure regulatory compliance and to maintain the colony health status. Contact the Department of Comparative Medicine on the Central and Waterfront Campus (DCM-C) at 503 - 494 - 8425 or the Division of Comparative Medicine on the West Campus (DCM-W) Small Lab Animal Unit (SLAU) at 503 - 690 - 5228 for detailed information regarding the required forms and procedures. Scope This policy applies to any animals being transported on the Central/Waterfront Campus (CWC) to ensure that animal transport is conducted in a safe and appropriate manner. Transport of animals (excluding NHPs) on the West Campus (WC) should be done according to the procedures outlined in SOP SLA- 008. Policy Requirements for the transportation of animals excluding NHPs are as follows: 1. All transportation of animals should be planned to minimize transit time, {{reduce the risk of}} zoonoses, assure adequate ventilation and temperature, and protect the animals against physical trauma. Whenever possible, all animals transported must be in a species-appropriate container. The container must be sanitizable or disposable and must have no floor openings or crevices that may injure the animal. 2. Drape the transport cart with a washable or sanitizable cloth/sheet to ensure animals and cages are shielded from public view. Yellow isolation gowns, lab coats and <b>biohazard</b> <b>bags</b> are not acceptable for covering cages. 3. Minimize noise and vibration by using a transport cart with wheels in good repair. 4. Animals must not be left unattended outside of the vivarium. 5. All caging, dirty bedding and carcasses should be returned to DCM {{at the end of the}} experimental procedure. Dirty caging should be covered and carcasses should be double bagged. 6. For transport of large numbers of animals (more than can fit on a transport cart) contact DCM-...|$|R
