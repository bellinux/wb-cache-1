5|$|Beat 'em ups {{are related}} to—but {{distinct}} from—fighting games, {{which are based}} around one-on-one matches rather than scrolling levels and multiple enemies. Such terminology is loosely applied, however, as some commentators prefer to conflate the two terms. At times, both one-on-one fighting games and scrolling beat 'em ups have influenced each other in terms of graphics and style and can appeal to fans of either genre. Occasionally, a game will feature <b>both</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> gameplay.|$|E

5|$|Some {{research}} suggests that G-spot and clitoral orgasms are of the same origin. Masters and Johnson {{were the first to}} determine that the clitoral structures surround and extend along and within the labia. Upon studying women's sexual response cycle to different stimulation, they observed that both clitoral and vaginal orgasms had the same stages of physical response, and found that the majority of their subjects could only achieve clitoral orgasms, while a minority achieved vaginal orgasms. On this basis, Masters and Johnson argued that clitoral stimulation is the source of <b>both</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> orgasms, reasoning that the clitoris is stimulated during penetration by friction against its hood.|$|E

25|$|Crittenden {{proposes that}} <b>both</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> {{information}} can be split off from consciousness or behavioural expression as a 'strategy' to maintain the availability of an attachment figure: 'Type A strategies were hypothesized {{to be based on}} reducing perception of threat to reduce the disposition to respond. Type C was hypothesized to be based on heightening perception of threat to increase the disposition to respond' Type A strategies split off emotional information about feeling threatened and type C strategies split off temporally-sequenced knowledge about how and why the attachment figure is available. By contrast, type B strategies effectively use <b>both</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> information without much distortion. For example: a toddler may have come to depend upon a type C strategy of tantrums in working to maintain the availability of an attachment figure whose inconsistent availability has led the child to distrust or distort causal information about their apparent behaviour. This may lead their attachment figure to get a clearer grasp on their needs and the appropriate response to their attachment behaviours. Experiencing more reliable and predictable information about the availability of their attachment figure, the toddler then no longer needs to use coercive behaviours with the goal of maintaining their caregiver's availability and can develop a secure attachment to their caregiver since they trust that their needs and communications will be heeded.|$|E
40|$|The {{detection}} and classification of faults in {{electric transmission lines}} is an essential task to be performed. Within an electric power system a diversity of faults which come from low impedance faults (LIFs) to high impedance faults (HIFs) are exhibited. Last faults {{are more difficult to}} be detected due to the use of conventional distance relays. In addition, when they are not detected irreversible consequences are presented into the system. From above, it is inferred that taking into account that HIFs are less frequent than LIFs it appears essential to guaranty that any protection device must be able to satisfactorily detect <b>both</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> electric faults. The aim {{of this paper is to}} present an algorithm to detect and classify <b>both</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> faults LIFs and HIFs using ANFIS (Adaptive Network-based Fuzzy Inference System).
