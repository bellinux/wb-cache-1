25|$|Banking in Switzerland is {{regulated}} by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA), which derives its authority {{from a series of}} federal statutes. The country's tradition of <b>bank</b> <b>secrecy,</b> which dates to the Middle Ages, was first codified in the Federal Act on Banks and Savings Banks, colloquially known as the Banking Law of 1934. The regime of <b>bank</b> <b>secrecy</b> that Swiss banks are famous for came under pressure {{in the wake of the}} UBS tax evasion scandal and the 1934 banking law was amended in 2009 to limit tax evasion by non-Swiss bank clients.|$|E

40|$|A 2009 G 20 {{official}} document {{stated that the}} era of <b>banking</b> <b>secrecy</b> is over but is it? If <b>banking</b> <b>secrecy</b> {{is the result of}} market mechanisms, it suggests that worldwide demand and supply are likely to remain {{for a long time to}} come. Since the Global Financial Crisis, many countries have fought to combat <b>banking</b> <b>secrecy,</b> yet it permeates both national and international industries, and global efforts to prevent <b>banking</b> <b>secrecy</b> have been ineffective or at worst counterproductive. In this book, the authors show how the growth of criminal activity has systematically generated a demand for <b>banking</b> <b>secrecy.</b> They explore how national politicians and international banks have been motivated to supply <b>banking</b> <b>secrecy</b> through economic and political incentives, and shed light on the economics and politics of <b>banking</b> <b>secrecy.</b> This book takes a multidisciplinary approach to reveal the variety of behaviours and processes involved in making dirty money appear clean, providing an in-depth study of financial transactions which are characterized by a special purpose: hiding the originally illegal sources. This work will be of interest to students and scholars of economics and finance, and those with an interest in <b>banking</b> <b>secrecy,</b> global finance, international banking, and financial regulation...|$|R

We find that the value of <b>banking</b> <b>secrecy</b> to the private banks is large, accounting for 8 to 14 % of their market value; in contrast, the value of <b>banking</b> <b>secrecy</b> to the universal banks is small. We further find that tax evasion may be less important and privacy concerns more important a source of value of <b>banking</b> <b>secrecy</b> than might previously have been thought...|$|R
40|$|For all its notoriety and {{controversial}} character, {{the history of}} Swiss <b>banking</b> <b>secrecy</b> remains largely unexplored. This article traces the crucial phases of its development. It reveals that the maintenance and reinforcement of <b>banking</b> <b>secrecy</b> represented a major objective of Swiss authorities throughout the twentieth century, and exerted a substantial influence on Swiss domestic and foreign policy. It demonstrates that, contrary to popular opinion, the institution of Swiss <b>banking</b> <b>secrecy</b> did not arise from a desire to protect the funds deposited in Switzerland by Jewish victims of Nazi persecution but rather had substantially different origins. Moreover, this article shows that Swiss <b>banking</b> <b>secrecy</b> gave rise to tensions between Switzerland and the Great Powers, especially during and after World War II, when it poisoned relations between Switzerland and the United State...|$|R

After Birkenfeld's award, the Swiss newspaper Blick claimed, “Birkenfeld was a blessing for the Swiss financial industry,” in that his revelations helped accelerate the industry's transition away from its reliance on “dirty” money by dooming the <b>bank</b> <b>secrecy</b> laws that enabled tax evasion.|$|E

40|$|Swiss <b>banking</b> <b>secrecy</b> {{used to be}} a quirk of Swiss {{law that}} went largely {{untouched}} until recent times. Recently through high profile, year-long pressure by governments the world over, this secrecy, which had shielded account owners from declaring their financial assets and thus, taxable income, was partly dismantled. This oddity in Swiss law was always a hot button issue for many governments around the world, and lately came to the forefront of discussion for change in front of the Swiss government and the Swiss public. This paper aims to investigate how Swiss <b>banking</b> <b>secrecy</b> came about, and how it has evolved to its current reduced form thanks to internal and external actors, and the context of an increasingly globalized world. The transformation of attitudes towards privacy, financial responsibility and the external world for the Swiss taxpayer and voter has inevitably changed the Swiss <b>banking</b> <b>secrecy.</b> The actors involved in enacting any changes, namely the Swiss Parliament, the Federal Council, economic institutions and the Swiss people, all have their own motives, which will be analysed and discussed. It will be shown that cultural shifts and current events which at first glance might seem unconnected may have an impact on precise financial law. Throughout this paper, the aim is to track the increasing trend of total financial transparency, and to illustrate how a complex web of actors and events led to this and how this relates to Switzerland and the Swiss <b>banking</b> <b>secrecy.</b> It also aims to track the domestic opinion of the Swiss voters who, thanks to the Swiss legislative structure, will have a direct say on changes made regarding Swiss <b>banking</b> <b>secrecy,</b> for example the Initiative Matter. Switzerland whose shroud of <b>banking</b> <b>secrecy</b> was previously seen as untouchable, now no longer applies for foreign investors, as the automatic exchange of information is due to begin. Now the question remains, what is left of the Swiss <b>banking</b> <b>secrecy</b> for its domestic taxpayers, and what does its future hold? Finally, the conclusion shall outline the purpose of the <b>banking</b> <b>secrecy</b> {{in the eyes of the}} Swiss taxpayers, and in what way it could obstruct their willingness to financially contribute towards the community. In a global trend tending towards transparency, it will be explained that taxation of Swiss wealth and derived income will be achieved either through an extension of the Swiss withholding tax if the <b>banking</b> <b>secrecy</b> was to remain, or through increased tax authority knowledge of the taxpayers’ financial private sphere. With these theoretical incomes, the future of the Swiss <b>banking</b> <b>secrecy</b> and on a larger scale, the Swiss financial and fiscal systems are in flux, and it is an exciting time to be watching...|$|R

25|$|The {{investigation}} of Spitzer was reportedly initiated after North Fork Bank reported suspicious transactions to the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network {{as required by}} the <b>Bank</b> <b>Secrecy</b> Act, which was enhanced by Patriot Act provisions, enacted to combat terrorist activity such as money-laundering. Spitzer reportedly had at least seven liaisons with prostitutes from the agency over six months, and paid more than $15,000 for their services. Federal agents had him under surveillance twice in 2008. According to published reports, investigators believe Spitzer paid up to $80,000 for prostitutes {{over a period of several}} years – first while he was attorney general, and later as governor.|$|E
25|$|Along {{with changes}} to {{surveillance}} measures, the Patriot Act also made substantial changes to laws relating to money laundering.

It requires financial institutions to keep records of cash purchases of negotiable instruments, file reports of cash transactions exceeding a daily aggregate amount of $US10,000, and to report suspicious activity that might signify money laundering, tax evasion or other criminal activities. The MLCA, passed in 1986, further enhanced the BSA by making it a crime to structure transactions {{in such a way as}} to avoid BSA reporting requirements.|$|E

During a six month span, Spitzer had at least seven or eight liaisons with women from the agency and paid more than $15,000. According to published reports, investigators alleged that Spitzer paid up to $80,000 for prostitutes over a period of several years while he was attorney general, and later as governor. Spitzer first drew the attention of federal investigators when his bank reported suspicious money transfers under the anti-money laundering provisions of the <b>Bank</b> <b>Secrecy</b> Act and the Patriot Act. The resulting investigation was triggered by the belief that Spitzer might have been hiding bribe proceeds and led to the discovery of the prostitution ring.|$|E
25|$|He {{learned that}} the chemists of the French Connection had moved clandestine labs for {{refining}} heroin from Marseilles to Sicily. At the end of 1980 he visited the United States and started {{to work with the}} U.S. Justice Department, resulting in “some of the biggest international law enforcement operations in history” such as the Pizza Connection. The inquiries extended to Turkey, an important stopover on the route of morphine base; to Switzerland, where <b>bank</b> <b>secrecy</b> laws facilitated money laundering; and to Naples where cigarette smuggling rings were being reconfigured as heroin operations. At the end of 1981, he finalised the Spatola case for trial, which enabled the prosecution to win 74 convictions, based on Falcone's “web of solid evidence, bank and travel records, seized heroin shipments, fingerprint and handwriting analyses, wiretapped conversations and firsthand testimony” that proved that “Sicily had replaced France as the principal gateway for refining and exporting heroin to the United States”.|$|E
25|$|Israel {{also took}} {{a series of steps}} to evade the embargo and clandestinely trade with the Arab world.

In other cases, foreign companies would purchase Israeli technology and materials, use them to assemble completed products, and export them to Arab countries while concealing this fact from their customers. Arrangements with American companies were worked out where the American companies would buy goods from Israeli affiliates and export them as American-made goods. Israeli ships were re-flagged as ships of other nations and provided with faked bills of landing so they could directly export goods to the Arab and Muslim world. Greece and Cyprus were particularly popular hubs for smuggling Israeli goods into the Arab world due to their location, multilateral economic connections, large merchant fleets, and Cyprus' corporate and <b>bank</b> <b>secrecy</b> laws.|$|E
40|$|Over {{the period}} 2002 to 2003,Switzerland and the European Union (EU) {{were engaged in}} {{negotiations}} regarding <b>banking</b> <b>secrecy.</b> The EU's stated goal was for Switzerland to abolish <b>banking</b> <b>secrecy.</b> Switzerland refused and offered to impose a withholding tax on interest income instead. The two parties eventually agreed on the latter solution. We {{examine the effect of}} these negotiations on the share prices of four Swiss banks: UBS, Credit Suisse Group (CSG), Julius Baer (Baer), and Vontobel. Overall, investors believe that bank profitability will not be impacted by the imposition of the withholding tax. The event-by-event response of the share prices differs across banks. Whereas the two universal banks (UBS and CSG) primarily react to the threat of sanctions on their EU-based operations, the private banks (Baer and Vontobel) react strongly to events suggesting that <b>banking</b> <b>secrecy</b> might be abolished.

This paper focuses on a central reason behind the success of the Swiss banking sector: the institution of <b>banking</b> <b>secrecy,</b> deeply enshrined in the Swiss history and tradition. The rapid development of international markets that eventually gave rise to a “group structuration process” has, however, progressively eroded Swiss <b>banking</b> <b>secrecy.</b> It has had to bend before the duty of transparency within the groups in order not to promote financial criminality through accelerated asset inflows. Switzerland has also had to develop a comprehensive legislative frame to tackle financial criminality, and to enter into international agreements providing for mutual assistance.
