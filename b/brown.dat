30|$|While the {{metabolic}} benefits of <b>browning</b> in humans {{remain to be}} fully established, safety is a concern that must first be addressed regarding any method used to induce <b>browning.</b> Cold exposure is a classic and efficient way to induce <b>browning,</b> but its obvious discomfort, together with risks of hypothermia, makes it impractical for clinical use. Therefore, <b>browning</b> agents, either endogenous or exogenous, provide an attractive alternative for improving metabolic diseases. Here we discuss a few commonly used <b>browning</b> agents {{to draw attention to}} the safety concern of inducing WAT <b>browning.</b>|$|R
5|$|In 1987, <b>Brown</b> again ran for governor, {{entering}} a crowded Democratic primary that included Lieutenant Governor Steve Beshear, former governor Julian Carroll, Grady Stumbo, and political newcomer Wallace Wilkinson. He entered the race late – filing his candidacy papers in late February before the primary election in late May. When <b>Brown</b> approached {{the state capitol}} to file his papers, Beshear met him outside the filing office and challenged him to an impromptu debate, but <b>Brown</b> declined. As <b>Brown</b> quickly became the frontrunner, Beshear attacked his lavish lifestyle {{in a series of}} campaign ads, one of which was based on the popular television show Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous. Other ads by Beshear played up Brown's ties to James P. Lambert, while still others claimed that <b>Brown</b> would raise taxes. <b>Brown</b> refuted Beshear's claims in ads of his own, and the battle between Beshear and <b>Brown</b> opened an opportunity for Wilkinson – who distinguished himself from the field by advocating for a state lottery – to make a late surge. He defeated <b>Brown,</b> his closest competitor, by a margin of 58,000 votes.|$|E

But while Blair praises <b>Brown</b> as a good Chancellor and a committed public servant, he believes his decision to abandon the New Labour policies of the Blair years leads to the party's 2010 election defeat.
