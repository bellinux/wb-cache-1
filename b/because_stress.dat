25|$|There has {{previously}} been no effective method of treatment for the neurobehavioral aspects of the disease. Even children treated from birth with allopurinol develop behavioral and neurologic problems, despite never having had high serum concentrations of uric acid. Self-injurious and other behaviors are best managed {{by a combination of}} medical, physical, and behavioral interventions. The self-mutilation is often reduced by using restraints. Sixty percent of individuals have their teeth extracted in order to avoid self-injury, which families have found to be an effective management technique. <b>Because</b> <b>stress</b> increases self-injury, behavioral management through aversive techniques (which would normally reduce self-injury) actually increases self-injury in individuals with LNS. Nearly all affected individuals need restraints to prevent self-injury, and are restrained more than 75% of the time. This is often at their own request, and occasionally involves restraints that would appear to be ineffective, as they do not physically prevent biting. Families report that affected individuals are more at ease when restrained.|$|E

5000|$|An optimal {{level of}} stress is {{considered}} good because medical students develop coping abilities. [...] However, too much stress causes problems. Previous studies have reported that {{a significant percentage of}} medical students suffer anxiety disorders <b>because</b> <b>stress</b> has a strong relationship to emotional and behavioral problems. Feelings of disappointment academically are most prevalent in those students who have poor academic performance.|$|E
50|$|The {{length of}} the vowel is a {{grammatical}} abstraction, {{and there may be}} more phonologically distinctive lengths. For example, in Finnish, there are five different physical lengths, <b>because</b> <b>stress</b> is marked with length on both grammatically long and short vowels. However, Finnish stress is not lexical and is always on the first two moras, thus this variation serves to separate words from each other.|$|E

5000|$|Chlorophyll {{fluorescence}} {{can measure}} most types of plant stress. Chlorophyll fluorescence {{can be used}} as a proxy of plant <b>stress</b> <b>because</b> environmental <b>stresses,</b> e.g. extremes of temperature, light and water availability, can reduce the ability of a plant to metabolise normally. This can mean an imbalance between the absorption of light energy by chlorophyll and the use of energy in photosynthesis.|$|R

50|$|Some {{types of}} {{mechanical}} failure mechanisms are: excessive deflection, buckling, ductile fracture, brittle fracture, impact, creep, relaxation, thermal shock, wear, corrosion, stress corrosion cracking, and {{various types of}} fatigue. Each produces {{a different type of}} fracture surface, and other indicators near the fracture surface(s). The way the product is loaded, and the loading history are also important factors which determine the outcome. Of critical importance is design geometry <b>because</b> <b>stress</b> concentrations can magnify the applied load locally to very high levels, and from which cracks usually grow.|$|E

50|$|One {{method of}} {{avoiding}} stress fractures {{is to add}} more stress to the bones. Though this may seem counter-intuitive (<b>because</b> <b>stress</b> fractures are caused by too much stress on the bone), moderate stress applied to the bone {{in a controlled manner}} can strengthen the bone and make it less susceptible to a stress fracture. An easy {{way to do this is}} to follow the runner's rule of increasing distance by no more than 10 percent per week. This allows the bones to adapt to the added stress so they are able to withstand greater stress in the future.|$|E
50|$|The rules {{also create}} {{difficulties}} with the -ii and -iae endings derived from personal names, <b>because</b> the <b>stress</b> falls {{in a place}} that is not usual for those names.|$|R
30|$|<b>Because</b> the <b>stress</b> field {{around the}} {{horizontal}} wellbore changes dramatically, {{the effect of}} the horizontal wellbore on the stress field distribution should be considered. Numerical calculation can achieve the above purpose.|$|R
5|$|The northeastern part of Iran lies across part of {{the belt}} of active {{continental}} collision between the Arabian Plate and the Eurasian Plate. Iran is crossed by several major faults, with 90% of them being seismically active and subject to many earthquakes each year; {{the area around the}} rupture experiences minor quakes almost daily. The most seismically active parts of this area are the Zagros fold and thrust belt and the Alborz mountain range. Qazvin Province, which is located between these two zones, suffers less earthquakes, but these may be more powerful <b>because</b> <b>stresses</b> have longer to build.|$|R
50|$|There are {{different}} classifications for coping, or defense mechanisms, however {{they all are}} variations on the same general idea: There are good/productive and negative/counterproductive ways to handle stress. <b>Because</b> <b>stress</b> is perceived, the following mechanisms do not necessarily deal with the actual situation that is causing an individual stress. However, they may be considered coping mechanisms if they allow the individual to cope better with the negative feelings/anxiety that they are experiencing due to the perceived stressful situation, as opposed to actually fixing the concrete obstacle causing the stress. The following mechanisms are adapted from the DSM-IV Adaptive Functioning Scale, APA, 1994.|$|E
50|$|A {{yield surface}} is a five-dimensional {{surface in the}} six-dimensional space of stresses. The yield surface is usually convex {{and the state of}} stress of inside the yield surface is elastic. When the stress state lies on the surface the {{material}} is said to have reached its yield point and the material is said to have become plastic. Further deformation of the material causes the stress state to remain on the yield surface, even though the shape and size of the surface may change as the plastic deformation evolves. This is <b>because</b> <b>stress</b> states that lie outside the yield surface are non-permissible in rate-independent plasticity, though not in some models of viscoplasticity.|$|E
50|$|Blank page {{syndrome}} {{is similar to}} writer's block, but is not a psychological term. It can happen to a writer {{at any point in}} time, irrespective of their career success. This syndrome can be very irksome to authors and often leads to a long span of time where they cannot come up with anything new. Coping strategies include: distracting oneself from the piece for a while, reading a book, and forcing oneself to write something even if it makes no sense. To avoid blank page syndrome, it is best to have an idea when one sits down to write, and to keep from procrastinating <b>because</b> <b>stress</b> only worsens the blank page syndrome.|$|E
40|$|Stress {{averaged}} through {{thickness of}} plate measured nondestructively. Theory of elasticity combined with laser interferometric technique into technique for measurement of residual stresses in solid objects - usually in thin, nominally-flat plates. Measurements particularly useful in inspection of wafers of single-crystal silicon for making solar cells or integrated circuits, <b>because</b> <b>stresses</b> remaining after crystal-growing process cause buckling or fracture. Used to predict deflections of plates caused by known applied loads under specified boundary condition, or to infer applied loads that cause known deflections. Also used to relate known deflections to residual stresses equivalent to stresses produced by fictitious applied loads...|$|R

30|$|Shear failure usually {{results in}} {{borehole}} collapse or breakout. Borehole breakouts are collapsed regions {{located on the}} least horizontal principal stress for vertical wells and are generally formed by compressive shear failure. Therefore, compressional failure will occur {{in the direction of}} the minimum horizontal <b>stress</b> <b>because</b> the tangential <b>stress</b> will reach a maximum here.|$|R
5000|$|Cast Vinyl is {{the most}} common {{material}} used in color change wraps. A cast vinyl starts as a liquid and is cast into a sheet or form and then processed through ovens, evaporating solvents in the liquid. When the solvents evaporate, the remainder is a solid film usually about 2 thousands of an inch thick. Cast films conform well to curved shapes and strongly retain their original, shape. This durability of shape allows for predictability on application and in applying heat to relax the material back to its natural form after modest stretching. Cast vinyls are less prone to shrinkage <b>because</b> <b>stress</b> (such as extrusion as in calendered films) is not applied to the material during the manufacturing process.|$|E
50|$|Its {{decommissioning}} {{has been}} exceptionally difficult, time-consuming and expensive. Since the original operators were {{overwhelmed by the}} effort, government agencies took over dismantling and disposal. In 2003 the reactor and its nuclear waste became government property. the temporary storage of 152 casks of spent fuel has been a controversy since 2009. The approval expired in 2013, <b>because</b> <b>stress</b> tests could not sufficiently demonstrate safety; no permanent solution has been reached. since 2012 plans to export the casks to the United States have been considered due to the extremely high disposal expenses. In 2014, a massive concrete wall to protect against terrorist plane crashes was to be built. On July 2, 2014 the Federal Environment ministry issued an evacuation order for the temporary storage.|$|E

30|$|The {{shed load}} does not {{completely}} reflect the system <b>stress</b> <b>because</b> the system <b>stress</b> should also capture the electricity customers’ stress, {{which is the}} product of the magnitude of the shed-load and the time to restore the shed-load.

50|$|Drug {{taking and}} relapse are heavily {{influenced}} {{by a number of}} factors including the pharmacokinetics, dose, and neurochemistry of the drug itself as well as the drug taker’s environment and drug-related history. Reinstatement of drug use after a period of non-use or abstinence is typically initiated by one or a combination of the three main triggers: stress, re-exposure to the drug or drug-priming, and environmental cues. These factors may induce a neurochemical response in the drug taker that mimics the drug and thus triggers reinstatement. These cues may lead to a strong desire or intention to use the drug, a feeling termed craving by Abraham Wikler in 1948. The propensity for craving is {{heavily influenced by}} all three triggers to relapse and is now an accepted hallmark of substance dependence. Stress {{is one of the most}} powerful stimuli for reinstating drug use <b>because</b> <b>stress</b> cues stimulate craving and drug-seeking behavior during abstinence. Stress-induced craving is also predictive of time to relapse. Comparably, addicted individuals show an increased susceptibility to stressors than do non-addicted controls. Examples of stressors that may induce reinstatement include emotions of fear, sadness, or anger, a physical stressor such as a footshock or elevated sound level, or a social event. Drug-priming is exposing the abstinent user to the drug of abuse, which will induce reinstatement of the drug-seeking behavior and drug self-administration. Stimuli that have a pre-existing association with a given drug or with use of that drug can trigger both craving and reinstatement. These cues include any items, places, or people associated with the drug.|$|E
