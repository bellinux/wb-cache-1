2500|$|Lepore, Buzaglo, Liberman, Golant, Greener, and Davey (2014) {{investigated}} the helper-therapy principle in a randomized control {{trial of a}} [...] "prosocial", other-focused Internet Support Group (P-ISG) designed to elicit peer-instigated, supportive interactions online among female breast cancer survivors. When compared to female breast cancer survivors who participated in a standard, self-focused Internet Support Group (S-ISG), which was not designed to explicitly provide opportunities for helping interactions to take place, analyses found that individuals in the P-ISG condition did provide more support to others yet P-ISG participants experienced {{a higher level of}} depression and anxiety following the intervention than those in S-ISG. These results fail to provide support for the helper-therapy principle which posits that [...] "helping others is effective at promoting mental health" [...] (p.4085). In accounting for these results, Lepore et al. (2014) suggest that it is possible that women in the P-ISG condition felt hesitant to express their negative feelings out of fear that doing so might impact others adversely, whereas women in the S-ISG felt more able to unburden themselves of emotional pain and thus enjoyed <b>better</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> outcomes.|$|E
2500|$|Psychological {{flexibility}} {{has been}} found to improve mental health and absence rates. A mediating variable is job control, which suggests that people feel they have more psychological flexibility when they have more control over their jobs. This is likely due to workers feeling less restricted by what they are allowed to do and more empowered to solve a problem. A longitudinal study on psychological flexibility and job control showed that these variables predicted workers’ mental health, job performance, and even their ability to learn new software. The study demonstrates the power of psychological flexibility in the workplace as psychologically flexible workers have <b>better</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> and job performance. Allowing workers more job control would likely increase work productivity as it would increase the workers’ psychological flexibility. In leadership studies, flexibility, defined as [...] "the ability to get along with different groups and adapt to the demands of many organizations," [...] is one aspect of portability, or the ability to acquire skills and move from one company to the next.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{quantify}} time caring, {{burden and}} health status in carers of stroke patients after discharge from rehabilitation; {{to identify the}} potentially modifiable sociodemographic and clinical characteristics associated with these outcomes. Methods: Patients and carers prospectively interviewed 6 (n = 71) and 12 (n = 57) months after discharge. Relationships of carer and patient variables with burden, health status and time analysed by Gaussian and Poisson regression. Results: Carers showed considerable burden at 6 and 12 months. Carers spent 4. 6 and 3. 6 hours per day assisting patients with daily activities at 6 and 12 months, respectively. Improved patient motor and cognitive function were associated with reductions of up to 20 minutes per day in time spent in daily activities. <b>Better</b> patient <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> and cognitive function were associated with <b>better</b> carer <b>mental</b> <b>health.</b> Conclusions: Potentially modifiable factors such as these {{may be able to}} be targeted by caregiver training, support and education programmes and outpatient therapy for patients...|$|R
