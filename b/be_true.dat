5|$|The {{unresolved}} larger narrative arc encourages {{speculation about}} future story events. According to Martin, {{much of the}} key to Ice and Fire future lies over a dozen years in the fictional past, of which each volume reveals more. Events planned from the beginning are foreshadowed, although Martin is careful {{not to make the}} story predictable. The viewpoint characters, who serve as unreliable narrators, may clarify or provide different perspectives on past events. Therefore, what the readers believe to <b>be</b> <b>true</b> may not necessarily <b>be</b> <b>true.</b>|$|E

5|$|Eureka {{has been}} read in many ways, {{in part because}} Poe's sincerity in the work is questionable. It has been {{considered}} prophetically scientific, intuitively romantic, and even calculatingly ironic.

Assuming Sn <b>is</b> <b>true</b> implies a contradiction, Sk <b>is</b> <b>true</b> and not true, so our {{assumption}} is absurd. We must conclude for each i, the sentence Si <b>is</b> not <b>true.</b> But if Si <b>is</b> not <b>true,</b> it <b>is</b> also <b>true,</b> so we have the paradox that each sentence in Yablo's list <b>is</b> <b>true</b> and not true.|$|R

5|$|Nevertheless, it is conjectured that Zarankiewicz's and Urbanik's {{formula is}} optimal. This {{has come to}} be known as the Zarankiewicz {{crossing}} number conjecture. Although some special cases of it are known to <b>be</b> <b>true,</b> the general case remains open.|$|E
5|$|Skeptics {{argue that}} the {{connection}} of conspiracy theorists and occultists follows from their common fallacious premises. First, any widely accepted belief must necessarily be false. Second, stigmatized knowledge—what the Establishment spurns—must <b>be</b> <b>true.</b> The result is a large, self-referential network in which, for example, some UFO religionists promote anti-Jewish phobias while some antisemites practice Peruvian shamanism.|$|E

5000|$|A {{language}} is called fully interpreted, if meanings {{are attached to}} its sentences so that they all <b>are</b> either <b>true</b> or false, and the following rules are valid when A and B denote its sentences (iff stands for if and only if): A <b>is</b> <b>true</b> iff ¬A <b>is</b> false, and A is false iff ¬A is true; A ∨ B <b>is</b> <b>true</b> iff A or B <b>is</b> <b>true,</b> and false iff A and B are false; A ∧ B <b>is</b> <b>true</b> iff A and B <b>are</b> <b>true,</b> and false if A or B is false; A ↦ B <b>is</b> <b>true</b> iff A <b>is</b> false or B <b>is</b> <b>true,</b> and false iff A <b>is</b> <b>true</b> and B <b>is</b> false; A ↔ B <b>is</b> <b>true</b> iff A and B <b>are</b> both <b>true</b> false or both false, and false iff A <b>is</b> <b>true</b> and B <b>is</b> false or A is false and B <b>is</b> <b>true.</b> If P(x) <b>is</b> a formula and X {{is a set of}} terms, then P is called a predicate with domain X if P(x) is a sentence for each assignment of a term of X into x (shortly, for each x ∈ X), and if ∃ x P(x) and ∀ x P(x) exist and satisfy the following rules: ∀ x P(x) <b>is</b> <b>true</b> iff P(x) <b>is</b> <b>true</b> for every x ∈ X, and false iff P(x) is false for some x ∈ X; ∃ x P(x) <b>is</b> <b>true</b> iff P(x) <b>is</b> <b>true</b> for some x ∈ X, and false iff P(x) is false for all x ∈ X.|$|R
5000|$|One {{consequence}} of Stalnaker's {{acceptance of the}} Uniqueness Assumption is that, if the law of excluded middle <b>is</b> <b>true,</b> then all instances of the formula (A > C) ∨ (A > ¬C) <b>are</b> <b>true.</b> The law of excluded middle is the thesis that for all propositions p, p ∨ ¬p <b>is</b> <b>true.</b> If the Uniqueness Assumption <b>is</b> <b>true,</b> then for every antecedent A, there is a uniquely closest world where A <b>is</b> <b>true.</b> If the law of excluded middle <b>is</b> <b>true,</b> any consequent C <b>is</b> either <b>true</b> or false at that world where A <b>is</b> <b>true.</b> So for every counterfactual A > C, either A > C or A > ¬C <b>is</b> <b>true.</b> This <b>is</b> called conditional excluded middle (CEM).

However, the community was still suppressed as a heresy and the accusation of being an Azali was often enough for most to believe it to <b>be</b> <b>true.</b> Coupled with the Azali practice of taqiyya (dissimulation) determining {{whether or not a}} particular figure in Persian politics was an Azali is difficult.|$|E
5|$|Aphthous-like {{ulceration}} {{may occur}} {{in association with}} several systemic disorders (see table).
