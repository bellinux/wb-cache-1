Tenders were requested by the project at the end of 1986, and 19 submissions were made, 12 of which included ship designs: the Netherlands' M-class (later Karel Doorman-class) frigate, a design based on the German MEKO 200 multipurpose frigate design, Italy's Maestrale-class frigate, the French F2000 design, the Canadian Halifax-class frigate, the German Type 122 (later Bremen-class frigate), Norway's Nordkapp-class offshore patrol vessel, the British Type 23 frigate (which was proposed by two different shipyards), South Korea's Ulsan-class frigate, and an airship design proposed by Airship Industries. By August 1987, a cost ceiling of A$3.5 billion (1986 terms) was established, and the submitted proposals were narrowed down in October to Blohm + Voss's MEKO design, the M class offered by Royal Schelde, and a scaled-down version of the British Type 23 proposed by Yarrow Shipbuilders. The Type 23 proposal was eliminated in November 1987, with the other two going into a development phase where the designer partnered with an Australian shipbuilder: Blohm + Voss with AMECON, and Royal Schelde with Australian Warship Systems.|$|E

Other reports required (impossible) negative standard deviations in subsets of patients, or contained fractional patients, negative NYHA classes.

40|$|Purpose: Pars plana vitrectomy with {{internal}} limiting membrane peeling for idiopathic epiretinal membrane has shown varying results. More data are {{needed on the}} factors associated with visual outcome. Methods: We extracted <b>baseline</b> clinical <b>characteristics,</b> optical coherence tomography (OCT) characteristics and 3 -month postoperative best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA). Linear regression {{analysis was used to}} evaluate whether <b>baseline</b> and OCT <b>characteristics</b> are associated with BCVA at 3 months as well as BCVA difference. Results: Out of 82 operated eyes, 66 (80 %) had a 3 -month follow-up, and 47 (71 %) showed a 3 -month postoperative improvement. Preoperative BCVA was an independent determinant of postoperative BCVA (r = 0. 31; p < 0. 01) and BCVA difference (r = 0. 68; p < 0. 01). Other <b>baseline</b> and OCT <b>characteristics</b> showed no independent associations with postoperative outcome. Conclusion: Better preoperative BCVA predicts better postoperative BCVA.

Methods: A longitudinal design was used to conduct dental inspections at baseline and one-year, for two groups of randomly selected community-living older adults – one group of 116 people with dementia and a comparison group of 116 people without dementia. Results: At one-year there were 103 dementia and 113 (112 dentate) non-dementia participants. Coronal and root surface caries incidence was higher for dementia participants (p 1 decayed/filled root surface at baseline. Among dementia participants, being male was the <b>baseline</b> <b>characteristic</b> predictive in logistic regression for coronal caries increments, and having > 1 decayed coronal surface was the <b>baseline</b> <b>characteristic</b> predictive for root caries increments. Conclusions: Coronal and root caries incidence and increments were significantly higher in the community-living older adults with dementia over the one-year follow-up period. Dementia participants had high levels of coronal and root caries increments; characteristics related to high caries increments included sex (males), dementia severity (moderate-severe), high carer burden, oral hygiene care difficulties, use of neuroleptic medication (with high anticholinergic adverse effects) and previous experience of caries.

50|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide {{standardized}} definitions and a roadmap of test processes for the Environmental Stress Screening (ESS) of replacement and repaired components used on Air Force systems. The term “component” is used interchangeably with the term “unit” and includes Line-replaceable unit (LRU) and sub-units (SRU). A component selected for testing is a Unit Under Test (UUT). Operational Safety, Suitability, and Effectiveness (OSS&E) policy and instructions require consistency in the disciplined engineering process used to ensure that activities such as maintenance repairs and part substitutions do not degrade system or end-item <b>baselined</b> <b>characteristics</b> over their operational life. <b>Baselined</b> <b>characteristics</b> are highly dependent on reliability, which is verified and maintained by ESS testing. OSS&E policy and instructions also require consistent engineering processes to ensure manufacturing and repair entities are accountable for delivering quality products, and to provide selection and qualification criteria for new sources of supply. Determinations of product quality and source capabilities usually require ESS testing. While considerable information concerning ESS methods and procedures is available including United States Military Standards, handbooks, guides, and the original equipment manufacturer’s test plans, often these publications use differing and confusing definitions for the testing phases where ESS is applied. Lengthy explanations were needed to clarify contract clauses citing these publications. This paper ensures testing requirements are uniformly applied and clearly understood in writing source qualification requirements and contracts.|$|R

5000|$|Mainly {{there are}} two types of {{medication}} therapies used for aversion, they are Antidipsotropic and Effect - altering agents. A strong precedent of the successful effects of aversion therapy is identified with Naltrexone, an opioid-dopamine release pathway inhibitor and Disulfiram, an acetaldehyde dehydrogenase inhibitor. This enzyme is responsible for a portion of the metabolism of alcohol and, when inhibited, causes hangover-like effects almost immediately after consuming alcohol, thus promoting an unpleasant association with a chemical dependence. However, most patients never drink on it because they are aware of the negative effect, and instead, use it to help counter urges to drink while they are developing other coping skills and hope that over time the craving for alcohol will be extinguished from not being reinforced. Prior studies have shown Antabuse brings relief to the majority of its users, describing, [...] "Patients who could not remain sober from one visit to the next achieved many months of continuous sobriety."More recent studies have compared aversion to [...] "Minnesota Model" [...] programs and have found patients matched on 17 <b>baseline</b> <b>characteristics,</b> to have higher abstinence rates at 6 and 12 months with the aversion.Traditional aversion therapy, which employed either chemical aversion or electrical aversion while effective, is commonly replaced with aversion imagery, a technique which is known as covert sensitization. Covert sensitization, or covert conditioning, involves provoking mental imagery to create associations with undesirable habits. While the efficacy of covert conditioning may be comparable to that of more-prevalent techniques in aversion therapy, these treatments may be combined to enhance an individual's likelihood for success in ending an unwanted habit.|$|E

40|$|AbstractSixty {{patients}} who had recurrent episodes of symptomatic atrial fibrillation or flutter, or both, and who had failed one to five prior drug trials were treated with open label oral propafenone hydrochloride. On a mean maximal tolerated dose of 795 ± 180 mg/day, actuarial estimates of the percent of individuals free of recurrences of symptomatic atrial fibrillation/flutter during propafenone treatment were: 1 month, 54 %; 3 months, 44 % and 6 months, 40 %. No individual <b>baseline</b> <b>characteristic</b> achieved statistical significance as a correlate of poor response to propafenone. Drug-related adverse reactions were reported in 22 % of patients but were severe enough to require termination of propafenone in only 5 %.

Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome surgery studies largely evaluate single procedures or procedure combinations in case series designs, but it can be difficult to compare results across studies.

The format includes thor-ough characterization of <b>baseline</b> subject <b>characteristics</b> and the use of outcome measures that reflect the spectrum of obstructive sleep apnea and its consequences. As the apnea-hypopnea index is the most common, albeit controversial, pri-mary outcome measure in obstructive sleep apnea syndrome surgery studies, the authors propose analysis and reporting standards to facilitate understanding its role as an outcome measure.
