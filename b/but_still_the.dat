It is bounded by Hertfordshire to the south-east, Cambridgeshire to the north-east, Northamptonshire to the north, and Buckinghamshire to the west. It has an area of , and a {{population}} estimated in 2016 at 640,000, with an increase of 11% over the previous ten years. Geographically, it is mainly rural, <b>but</b> <b>still</b> <b>the</b> fourteenth most densely populated county of England, with over half the population living in the two largest built-up areas, Luton and Bedford.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland's success drew {{large crowds}} {{both at home}} and away in 1947. The team's average home {{attendance}} was 55,848 people during the season, slightly lower than in 1946 <b>but</b> <b>still</b> <b>the</b> best in either the AAFC or NFL. Including away games, a total of 666,017 people saw the Browns play, a professional football record. Although the team was a major success on the field, the following season was even better for Cleveland. The team won all of its games in 1948 and a third straight AAFC championship.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} centuries, the Byzantines were usually on the defensive, and avoided open field battles, preferring {{to retreat to}} their {{fortified}} strongholds. Only after 740 did they begin to launch counterstrikes of their own, <b>but</b> <b>still</b> <b>the</b> Abbasid Empire was able to retaliate with often massive and destructive invasions of Asia Minor. With the decline and fragmentation of the Abbasid state after 861 and the concurrent strengthening of the Byzantine Empire under the Macedonian dynasty, the tide gradually turned. Over a period of fifty years from ca. 920 to 976, the Byzantines finally broke through the Muslim defences and restored their control over northern Syria and Greater Armenia. The last century of the Arab–Byzantine wars was dominated by frontier conflicts with the Fatimids in Syria, but the border remained stable until {{the appearance of a}} new people, the Seljuk Turks, after 1060.|$|E

5|$|Wragg {{agreed to}} Teach's demands, and a Mr. Marks and two pirates were given {{two days to}} collect the drugs. Teach moved his fleet, and the {{captured}} ships, to within {{about five or six}} leagues from land. Three days later a messenger, sent by Marks, returned to the fleet; Marks's boat had capsized and delayed their arrival in Charles Town. Teach granted a reprieve of two days, <b>but</b> <b>still</b> <b>the</b> party did not return. He then called a meeting of his fellow sailors and moved eight ships into the harbour, causing panic within the town. When Marks finally returned to the fleet, he explained what had happened. On his arrival he had presented the pirates' demands to the Governor and the drugs had been quickly gathered, but the two pirates sent to escort him had proved difficult to find; they had been busy drinking with friends and were finally discovered, drunk.|$|E

In that way, the vessel, designed for speed, permitted the fishing fleets to develop into working more distant waters, a process which developed further when it was possible to obtain ice and ultimately, refrigeration.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{the lack}} of {{knowledge}} available about the whole Antarctic ecosystem, large scale experiments involving krill are already being performed to increase carbon sequestration: in vast areas of the Southern Ocean {{there are plenty of}} nutrients, <b>but</b> <b>still,</b> <b>the</b> phytoplankton does not grow much. These areas are termed HNLC (high nutrient, low chlorophyll). The phenomenon is called the Antarctic Paradox, and occurs because iron is missing. Relatively small injections of iron from research vessels trigger very large blooms, covering many miles. The hope is that such large scale exercises will draw down carbon dioxide as compensation for the burning of fossil fuels.|$|E
25|$|A special form of {{boundaryless}} {{organization is}} virtual. Hedberg, Dahlgren, Hansson, and Olve (1999) consider the virtual organization as not physically existing as such, but enabled by software to exist. The virtual organization exists within {{a network of}} alliances, using the Internet. This means while {{the core of the}} organization can be small <b>but</b> <b>still</b> <b>the</b> company can operate globally be a market leader in its niche. According to Anderson, because of the unlimited shelf space of the Web, the cost of reaching niche goods is falling dramatically. Although none sell in huge numbers, there are so many niche products that collectively they make a significant profit, and that is what made highly innovative Amazon.com so successful.|$|E

25|$|In 1965, Donald Knuth {{invented the}} LR parser (Left to Right, Rightmost derivation). The LR parser can {{recognize}} any deterministic context-free language in linear-bounded time. Rightmost derivation has very large memory requirements and implementing an LR parser was impractical {{due to the}} limited memory of computers at that time. To address this shortcoming, in 1969, Frank DeRemer proposed two simplified versions of the LR parser, namely the Look-Ahead LR (LALR) and the Simple LR parser that had much lower memory requirements {{at the cost of}} less language-recognition power, with the LALR parser being the most-powerful alternative. In 1977, memory optimizations for the LR parser were invented <b>but</b> <b>still</b> <b>the</b> LR parser was less memory-efficient than the simplified alternatives.|$|E
25|$|It {{quickly became}} apparent, however, that {{the scope of}} work under {{discussion}} by the ACMA would overwhelm the small board of directors. Herbert records that the ACMA submitted a petition in November 1906 asking the UDC to support the ACMA organizationally and financially. This resolution was approved by the UDC. <b>But</b> <b>still</b> <b>the</b> work overwhelmed the ACMA. By mid-1907, {{it was clear that the}} UDC would have to completely take over the memorial's fund-raising, design, and construction. On June 19, 1907, Mrs. Lizzie George Henderson, President-General of the UDC, asked the ACMA to delegate its functions to the UDC, with the UDC and Sons of Confederate Veterans (SCV) retaining certain powers to themselves. The ACMA quickly agreed.|$|E
25|$|<b>But</b> <b>still</b> <b>the</b> {{problems}} of the collaborators would not go away. At d'Estouteville's inquiry of May 1452, two vital but highly placed witnesses were not called – Raoul Roussel, archbishop of Rouen and Jean Le Maître, vicar of the Inquisition in 1431. Though new testimonies were taken from two canons of Rouen cathedral, neither of them remembered very much about the events of 1431. By January 1453, d'Estouteville had returned to Rome, his principal mission to negotiate a peace having been unsuccessful. However, the Inquisitor Bréhal had been busy collecting information and learned opinions from canonists and theologians on the case. Even more importantly, the month before saw {{the death of the}} Archbishop Roussel, removing a substantial obstacle to the reopening of the trial and the rehabilitation of Joan.|$|E
