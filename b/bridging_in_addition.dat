40|$|A 65 -year-old male {{regularly}} {{involved in}} competitive cycling {{came to our}} sports medicine laboratory for the annual mandatory pre-participation screening. Cycling screening protocol includes a cardiological examination, basal ECG and cardiac stress test. The clinical examination was unremarkable, and the patient’s blood pressure was 120 / 75 mmHg. The rest-ECG was normal. The ardiac exercise stress test showed a 2 mm ST-segment inversion in the anterior leads (V 3 -V 4 -V 5 -V 6) at peak exercise. No presence of arrhythmias or symptoms were reported. Due to an ST segment depression recorded during the cardiac exercise stress test, we performed a coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) that showed two myocardial bridges of the left coronary artery. However, we observed no atherosclerotic plaque of the coronary lumen. A dobutamine stress echocardiogram and a bicycle stress echocardiogram were normal. We concluded for ventricular repolarisation abnormalities during maximal exercise testing due to the electrocardiographic findings in an asymptomatic athlete without any coronary artery disease. In literature, myocardial bridging is regarded as a common anatomic variant rather than a congenital anomaly. Nevertheless, some reports show that myocardial ischemia and myocardial infarction or sudden death could be caused by myocardial <b>bridging.</b> <b>In</b> <b>addition,</b> intramyocardial bridging is a recognised cause of sudden death in athletes. Therefore, according to the Italian cardiological guidelines for competitive sports (COCIS 2009), we recommended the patient avoid physical overload and sport practice...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} set out {{to investigate}} the role that community radio can potentially play as a space in which young people engage with their own role as citizens and, in so doing, participate in discussions that seek to address social problems in a community divided by class, income, gender and race. The study examines how a local community radio station - Radio Grahamstown - developed a youth programme Y 4 Yin which the producers of the show and its audience came together to negotiate the meaning of citizenship. The study examines whether this interactive programme was able to function as something like a public sphere where in young people were able to develop {{a greater sense of}} agency, at least in the realm of citizenship. Using evidence gathered through focus group discussions with a group of young school-going leamers, interviews conducted with the producers of the show Y 4 Y, and drawing on Dahlgren's elaboration of a functional public sphere, the research concludes that the show provided a useful platform for Grahamstown high school students to develop their own notions of citizenship and to, at least partially and tentatively, build some 'bridges' across the vectors of socio-economic division in the town. However, the research also concludes that the Y 4 Y producers often failed to use a mode of address contemporary to the youth and often did not use production techniques congruent with young people's cultural tastes. This limited the programme's appeal and its potential as an enabler of discussion about notions of citizenship and as a platform for social <b>bridging.</b> <b>In</b> <b>addition,</b> because of the producers' control over the choice of topics put up for discussion, open interaction was more limited than could have been expected. In addition, the study also concludes that various limitations to the leamers' freedom of expression (including their fear that teachers might be listening in to the shows) inhibited the programme's role as a deliberative public sphere where issues could be aired, common ground found, and solutions discussed. ...|$|E
