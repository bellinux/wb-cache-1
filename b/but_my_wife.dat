500|$|Neither Tracy nor {{his wife}} ever pursued a divorce, despite their estrangement. He told Joan Fontaine, [...] "I {{can get a}} divorce {{whenever}} I want to, <b>but</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> and Kate like things just as they are." [...] Louise, meanwhile, reportedly commented: [...] "I will be Mrs. Spencer Tracy until the day I die." [...] Hepburn did not interfere and never fought for marriage.|$|E
500|$|Gwen's {{father and}} a New York City Police Department captain who hunts both Spider-Man out of {{distrust}} and the Lizard for his rampage. Leary explained {{that he did not}} know much about Spider-Man in the comics and was [...] "more of a Batman guy. Not the '60s [...] but the really dark Batman. <b>But</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> was a Spider-Man nut, which was why I went to Tobey Maguire ones." [...] He added that long before he was cast as George Stacy his friend Jeff Garlin, a Spider-Man fan, [...] "said to me, 'The first time I met you, I thought you were George Stacy!' This was like 30 years ago. I was like, 'What?!'" [...] Director Webb said of his casting, [...] "e all trust Denis Leary. He's got this attitude, but you love him. In this movie, he puts pressure on Peter Parker. He's on Spider-Man's case, but you understand him. I've said this before, but good drama comes from competing ideas of what's good." ...|$|E
500|$|Xhinovci {{has come}} to believe that he is Hitler reincarnated since he began {{dressing}} as the Nazi leader. He carries numerous pieces of Nazi paraphernalia around with him, including Nazi-era Reichsmarks, swastika-emblazoned buttons, scarves embroidered with swastikas and other Nazi imagery, as well as a copy of Mein Kampf. He has business cards featuring a swastika and the word [...] "Hitler" [...] printed in bold. Locals and peacekeepers alike do not seem to mind Xhinovci's Hitler impersonations, especially as many Kosovars are too preoccupied with the country's crippling poverty and rampant corruption to give his actions much thought. On the contrary, many passersby—including some NATO peacekeepers—stop and greet him with the Nazi salute. One local told Vice News: [...] "I have {{a lot of other things}} to worry about in my life. I might look at him if he walks by, but that's it." [...] Locals apparently believe that his way of earning a living [...] "shows great enterprise". [...] "People respect me," [...] Xhinovci explains. [...] "The young and old [...] men, women and children. Everyone greets me with [...] "Heil Hitler". Xhinovci's five daughters, referred to locally as [...] "Hitler's children", are not bothered by their father's Hitler impersonations. Xhinovci reportedly attends parent-teacher conferences dressed as Hitler and says that teachers and other parents do not mind his appearance. He says that every time he goes to pick his daughters up from school he is surrounded by children who want to talk with him and take pictures. [...] "Girls like to touch my face. They think it's a mask. They pull my hair and ask if they can kiss me on the face. When I'm out of the house with my family, people stop to talk to me. <b>But</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> is not a jealous person—she doesn't mind." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Good Heaven--I wish I {{had more}} to give you! Here's--wretched--the merest trifle. It is every farthing I have left. I have none <b>but</b> what <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> gives me, you know, and I can't ask her now." ...|$|R

60|$|I was on {{the point}} of {{remarking}} that the Society for Psychical Research {{had nothing to do with}} spiritualism except to investigate it, <b>but</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> saw my intention and checked me.|$|E
6000|$|... "I must {{apologize}} again," [...] {{said the}} young man, [...] "for so soon intruding upon you with <b>my</b> marital infelicities, <b>but,</b> as <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> has neglected to furnish {{me with her}} address, I am deprived of the legitimate recourse of a family row." ...|$|R
60|$|Pretty women I {{had seen}} in plenty, for my aunts and my mother were counted fair, <b>but</b> <b>my</b> uncle's <b>wife</b> was as little like to them as a sunset glow to pale moonshine or a crimson rose to white day-lilies.|$|R
6000|$|... [4] Goethe, Zahme Xenien, Vierte Abtheilung. I {{should be}} glad {{to take credit for}} the close and {{vigorous}} English version; <b>but</b> it is <b>my</b> <b>wife's,</b> and not mine.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is a fruit-piece. You {{would think}} it not a very {{suitable}} picture for a doctor's consulting-room, <b>but</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> will not have it in the drawing-room. She says it is frankly obscene." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I never should, Mr. Holmes. <b>But</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> does. It is {{frightening}} her to death. She says nothing, but I can see terror in her eyes. That's why I want to sift {{the matter to}} the bottom." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll do it," [...] {{decided the}} man. [...] "I'll help, {{and you can}} do most of the work. <b>But</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> has gone fishing for red eels to-day, so some of you will have to mind the children." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For shame! Why {{does not}} Barnes Newcome portion his younger brothers? I have no {{patience}} with that----Why! Goodness! There is Clive going away, actually! Clive! Mr. Newcome!" [...] <b>But</b> though <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> {{ran to the}} study-window and beckoned our friend, he only shook his head, jumped on his horse, and rode away gloomily.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{seems to}} have done ye good already, man," [...] said the laird, putting the bottle and glass on that {{convenient}} shelf--the window-sill. [...] "I've {{no idea what the}} physic is, <b>but</b> <b>my</b> good <b>wife</b> seems to know, and that's enough for me; and for you, too, I think." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{following}} day a grand dinner was served to us <b>but</b> as <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> did not appear, I ordered a servant to call her. Still {{she did not}} come, and I waited impatiently for some time. At last she entered the room, and she took our places at the table, and plates of rice were set before us.|$|R
6000|$|I {{would have}} {{detained}} him, <b>but</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> {{made me a}} sign not to interfere. [...] "But surely, Mr. Tedham," [...] she pleaded, [...] "you {{are going to leave}} some word for her--or for Mrs. Hasketh to give her?" ...|$|E
60|$|DEAR MRS. McQUISTON,--I {{have never}} had an {{experience}} which moved me to believe the living can communicate with the dead, <b>but</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> and I have experimented in the matter when opportunity offered and shall continue to do so.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don’t {{suppose he}} meant any harm," [...] said the mollified Mr. Chalk, after the crestfallen Joseph {{had gone into}} the house. [...] "I hope I haven’t been and said too much, <b>but</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> insisted on me coming round and {{speaking}} about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm surely never horrid or low," [...] he returned, [...] "about anyone <b>but</b> <b>my</b> extravagant <b>wife.</b> I can do {{with all}} our friends--as I see them myself: what I can't do with is the figures you make of them.

"Aweel, sir, ye'll {{choose for}} yoursell, to be sure," [...] said Niel Blane, {{somewhat}} disconcerted; [...] "but deil a guide ye'll need if ye gae doun {{the water for}} twa mile or sae, as gin ye were bound for Milnwoodhouse, and then tak the first broken disjasked-looking road that makes for the hills,--ye'll ken 't by a broken ash-tree that stands at the side o' a burn just where the roads meet; and then travel out the path,--ye canna miss Widow Maclure's public, for deil another house or hauld {{is on the road}} for ten lang Scots miles, and that's worth twenty English.

60|$|As for lodgings, {{they were}} soon had. My old landlady, Mrs. Stokes, sent her Jemima {{to say that}} her first floor was at our service; and when we had taken {{possession}} of it, and I offered {{at the end of}} the week to pay her bill, the good soul, with tears in her eyes, told me that she did not want for money now, and that she knew I had enough to do with what I had. I did not refuse her kindness; for, indeed, I had but five guineas left, and ought not by rights to have thought of such expensive apartments as hers; <b>but</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife's</b> time was very near, and I could not bear to think that she should want for any comfort in her lying-in.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am right}} {{glad to hear}} it," [...] the innkeeper said. [...] "I don't know that I am much afraid myself; <b>but</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> and {{daughter}} are in a terrible fright, and wanted me to quit the house and go south till it is all over." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I won't {{have you}} here, and {{let that be}} an end of it. It's all very well when I choose {{to have a few}} friends to dinner, <b>but</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> can do very well without your fal-lalling here all day. Will you {{remember}} that, if you please?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I know that,' {{said the}} man; 'your real father was sold at Hamburg last Michaelmas, and your real mother died while calving in spring; <b>but</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> and I have adopted you as our own, {{and you are}} our only heir, so you must call me [...] "Father."' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, sir, I {{know that}} you can do nothing, <b>but</b> now that <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> and child are {{actually}} starvin', I really don't see the sin of helpin' myself to a loaf at the nearest baker's, and giving him leg-bail for it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... --"But {{what if she}} mistook thy mind [...] And {{followed}} thee to strife, [...] Then kneeling did entreat thy love [...] As Paynims ask for life?"

6000|$|... "Ah, wait." [...] The {{eyes that}} for a moment had sparkled with new hope, grew dull again; the lines of care descended between the brows. [...] "Oh, what to decide! What to decide! It is what I wish, <b>my</b> friend. <b>But</b> how will <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> take it?" ...|$|R
60|$|I got {{a little}} miserable fun out of this, <b>but</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> would not laugh; {{she would not be}} placated in any way; she held me in a sort {{responsible}} for the dilemma I had conjectured, and inculpated me in some measure for that which had really presented itself.|$|E
60|$|That matches {{are made}} in heaven, may be, <b>but</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> {{would have been just}} the wife for Peter the Great, or Peter the Piper.

6000|$|... 'You {{have made}} an {{excellent}} debut as aide-de-camp,' said he; 'Savary has told me all that has occurred, and nothing could have been better arranged.

60|$|We were {{so full of}} the {{delights of}} our return that we forgot all about the Sunday dinner and our guests, <b>but</b> Pomona, whom <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> was {{training}} to be an excellent cook, did not forget, and Euphemia was summoned to a consultation in the kitchen.|$|R
60|$|He died next year: {{when his}} widow, who called herself Mrs. Hoggarty-Grimes-Wapshot, of Castle Hoggarty, said {{that over the}} grave of her saint all earthly resentments were forgotten, and {{proposed}} to come and live with us; paying us, of course, a handsome remuneration. <b>But</b> this offer <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> and I respectfully declined; and once more she altered her will, which once more she had made in our favour; called us ungrateful wretches and pampered menials, and left all her property to the Irish Hoggarties. <b>But</b> seeing <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> one day in a carriage with Lady Tiptoff, and hearing {{that we had been}} at the great ball at Tiptoff Castle, and that I had grown to be a rich man, she changed her mind again, sent for me on her death-bed, and left me the farms of Slopperton and Squashtail, with all her savings for fifteen years.
