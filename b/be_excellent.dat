5|$|Though {{considered}} to be quick-firing, the propellant for 7-inch guns was loaded in bags, making them slower than contemporary 6-inch guns. The Navy considered these to <b>be</b> <b>excellent</b> for the intended role; however, in World War I North Atlantic convoy duty, the disadvantages in seakeeping outweighed the utility; they were removed from battleships remaining in US service in 1918.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{there being}} only two flat stages (the first two road race days), many top-tier sprinters started the race, as the Tirreno–Adriatico is {{traditionally}} considered to <b>be</b> <b>excellent</b> preparation for Milan–San Remo. Every Milan–San Remo winner since Andrei Tchmil in 1999 raced Tirreno–Adriatico (rather than Paris–Nice) beforehand. Tyler Farrar, Tom Boonen, Alessandro Petacchi, André Greipel, world champion Thor Hushovd, the aforementioned McEwen, {{and the last}} two Milan–San Remo winners Mark Cavendish and Óscar Freire all started the race.|$|E

5|$|The {{battles of}} zduhaći were furious. They were {{accompanied}} by forceful gales and whirlwinds which uprooted trees and whipped up dust. In Montenegro, it was considered dangerous to throw stones in the wind, because that might knock out an eye of a zduhać, who would kill the culprit. A fighting zduhać was supposed to retain his peck measure and milk bucket, while trying to seize these objects from an enemy zduhać; he should hit and not get hit. The victorious band of zduhaći would loot the yield of all agricultural produce from the territory of their defeated foes. The harvest in the coming season would thus <b>be</b> <b>excellent</b> for the victors and poor for the defeated zduhaći.|$|E
5|$|The present {{building}} {{incorporates the}} chancel from a 13th-century church {{which may have}} replaced a wooden building {{of two or three}} centuries earlier. Additions in the 14thcentury included stone effigies representing a knight and his wife, considered to <b>be</b> <b>excellent</b> examples of such sculptures. More structural changes took place at regular intervals, and a major Victorian restoration by architect Somers Clarke included an extension to the nave and a new tower. English Heritage has listed the church at Grade I because of its architectural and historical importance.|$|E

In cases of relapse, re-casting and/or more extensive surgery was considered.|$|R
5|$|Behavior {{is known}} {{mainly from the}} marsh rice rat and O.couesi, with some {{scattered}} data from the other species. Oryzomys are semiaquatic, spending {{much time in the}} water, and otherwise mainly live on the ground; both the marsh rice rat and O.couesi are known to <b>be</b> <b>excellent</b> swimmers and will flee into the water when disturbed. Both are also active during the night and build nests of interwoven vegetation, which may be suspended above the water. Breeding may occur throughout the year in both species, but is known to be seasonally variable in the marsh rice rat. In both, gestation takes about 21 to 28days and litter size is usually one to seven, averaging three to five. Young marsh rice rats and O.couesi become reproductively active when about 50days old.|$|E
5|$|The five reel {{film was}} {{released}} through the Pathé Exchange as a Pathé Gold Rooster Play on October 7, 1917. Charles E. Wagner of the Exhibitor's Trade Review {{found it to}} be a good film with great direction and photography, but was concerned that the stunt in which the baby appeared {{to be involved in the}} accident was too real. Wagner stated the film had sufficient action and pathos without sexual suggestiveness; which should prove a strong program for the Pathé program. Frances Agnew of The Morning Telegraph {{found it to be}} an average picture that was not exceptional for audiences, but it would hold sentimental appeal for the average viewer. A reviewer for The New York Dramatic Mirror found the film's excessive use of coincidental meetings to be highly improbable, but found Warde's performance to <b>be</b> <b>excellent</b> and the rest of the cast give good performances. The reviewer said that Emile Chautard had made the improbable story more plausible.|$|E
5|$|The largest {{source of}} wealth for Plymouth Colony was the fur trade. The {{disruption}} of this trade caused by Myles Standish's raid at Wessagussett created great hardship for the colonists {{for many years to}} come, and was directly cited by William Bradford as a contributing factor to the colonists' economic difficulties in their early years. The colonists attempted to supplement their income by fishing; the waters in Cape Cod bay were known to <b>be</b> <b>excellent</b> fisheries. However, they lacked any skill in this area, and it did little to relieve their economic hardship. The colony traded throughout the region, establishing trading posts as far away as Penobscot, Maine. They were also frequent trading partners with the Dutch at New Amsterdam.|$|E

5|$|To give a {{sense of}} the dry and dusty {{environment}} of the Dust Bowl, smoke and dirt were constantly blown through tubes onto the set. The actors' clothes were ragged and drenched in dirt, and Carnivàle had approximately 5,000 people costumed in the show's first season alone. The creative team listened to 1930s' music and radio and read old Hollywood magazines to get the period's sound, language, and slang right. The art department had an extensive research library of old catalogs, among them an original 1934 Sears Catalog, which were purchased at flea markets and antique stores. The East European background of some characters and Asian themes in Brother Justin's story were incorporated into the show. Aside from the show's supernatural elements, a historical consultant deemed Carnivàle historic accuracy to <b>be</b> <b>excellent</b> regarding the characters' lives and clothes, their food and accommodations, their cars and all the material culture.|$|E
