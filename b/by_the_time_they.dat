5|$|By contrast, ovarian cancer, {{the leading}} cause of {{reproductive}} organ cancer deaths, and the fifth commonest cause of cancer deaths in women in the United States, lacks an effective screening programme, and is predominantly a disease of women in industrialised countries. Because it is largely asymptomatic in its earliest stages, more than 50% of women have stage III or higher cancer (spread beyond the ovaries) <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>they</b> are diagnosed, with a consequent poor prognosis.|$|E
5|$|From early November, chicks begin {{moulting}} into juvenile plumage, {{which takes}} {{up to two}} months and is often not completed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>they</b> leave the colony; adults cease feeding them during this time.

5|$|Hurricanes (or their remnants) {{occasionally}} track {{through the}} area in late summer and early fall, but are often weak <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>they</b> reach Washington, {{partly due to the}} city's inland location. Flooding of the Potomac River, however, caused by a combination of high tide, storm surge, and runoff, has been known to cause extensive property damage in the neighborhood of Georgetown.|$|E

5|$|Most lionesses {{will have}} {{reproduced}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>they</b> are {{four years of}} age. Lions do not mate at any specific time of year, and the females are polyestrous. As with other cats' penises, the male lion's penis has spines that point backward. During withdrawal of the penis, the spines rake {{the walls of the}} female's vagina, which may cause ovulation. A lioness may mate with more than one male when she is in heat.|$|E
5|$|Orangutans build nests {{specialized}} {{for both}} {{day or night}} use. These are carefully constructed; young orangutans learn from observing their mother's nest-building behaviour. In fact, nest-building is a leading cause in young orangutans leaving their mother for the first time. From six months of age onwards, orangutans practice nest-building and gain proficiency <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>they</b> are three years old.|$|E
5|$|Summers are hot and humid; {{during this}} season, highs {{average in the}} upper80s °F (lower30s °C) and lows average in the upper60s °F (lower20s °C). The {{combination}} of heat and humidity in the summer brings very frequent thunderstorms, some of which occasionally produce tornadoes in the area. While hurricanes (or their remnants) occasionally track through the area in late summer and early fall, they have often weakened <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>they</b> reach Stephens City, {{partly due to the}} city's far inland location.|$|E

5|$|A {{total of}} 962 {{vehicles}} were produced from 1942 to 1943. It {{had originally been}} planned that Britain would receive all of the examples produced through Lend-Lease, intending to use them in the Western Desert, but <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>they</b> arrived the campaign was over. Additionally, the purpose-built M10 tank destroyer, armed with a 3-inch gun (and later a 17-pounder gun in British service) had begun to enter production. As a result, the British transferred 650 half-tracks to the Soviet Union under the Soviet Aid Program. Britain retained 30 and the remainder were taken by the US; except for one kept by the U.S. Army, these British and American vehicles were converted back to standard M3 Half-tracks.|$|E

5|$|Arsenal {{defeated}} Tottenham 1–0 on 25 April 2005, {{which meant}} Chelsea needed {{to wait on}} Saturday in order to mathematically win the title. Second position was the best Arsenal could aim for <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>they</b> faced West Bromwich Albion on 2 May 2005. Goals from Van Persie and Edu earned a 2–0 win for the team and Arsenal beat Champions League finalists Liverpool at Highbury to all-but secure second spot. Arsenal recorded the biggest win of the league season, against Everton at Highbury. An inspired performance by Bergkamp helped the team win 7–0; he created the opening two goals and scored in the second half. Arsenal lost their {{final game of the}} campaign, away to Birmingham City. It was a lacklustre performance by the visitors, who equalised through Bergkamp after going a goal behind, but conceded in the 90th minute.|$|E
5|$|As he withdrew, Frederick {{established}} a fighting line {{north of the}} village, and it eventually served as a rallying point for stragglers and survivors. By mid-morning, around 10:00, the Prussians retreated to the north-west. Any pursuing troops were met with a wall of musket fire. Frederick and his surviving army were {{out of range of}} the Austrian army <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>they</b> had reorganized. Hans Joachim von Zieten and Friedrich Wilhelm von Seydlitz, who also had remained alert all night, organized a rear guard action that prevented the Austrians from falling upon the retreating Prussians. This discouraged even the most determined Austrians; the Croats and irregulars contented themselves with pillaging the village and the Prussian bodies.|$|E
50|$|A {{series of}} devastating fires struck {{the port city}} of Portsmouth, New Hampshire, early in the 19th century.

5|$|As {{the rest}} of the 3rd Light Horse Brigade {{advanced}} to Tiberias, their left flank moved over the site of the 1187AD Battle of Hattin. On 26 September, the 3rd Light Horse Brigade camped to the north of Tiberias, at Medjel on the shore of the Sea of Galilee. A squadron of the 9th Light Horse Regiment rode out at 12:30 to investigate reports of a considerable enemy force at Safed. <b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>they</b> arrived at 18:00, the force had withdrawn. Meanwhile, the 8th Light Horse Regiment restored order in the town and established guards on stores of grain while the remainder of the brigade rested after their night-time advance.|$|E
5|$|Both sexes become {{sexually mature}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>they</b> are a year old. Females enter oestrus (typically five days long) from January to March. In males, {{spermatogenesis}} occurs mainly in February and March. In southern Turkmenistan, mating occurs from January to early February. The mating season {{is marked by}} noisy fights among males for dominance. Mating behaviour {{is similar to that}} in the domestic cat: the male pursues the female in oestrus, seizes her by {{the nape of her neck}} and mounts her. Vocalisations and flehmen are prominent during courtship. After a successful copulation, the female gives out a loud cry and reacts with aversion towards her partner. The pair then separate.|$|E
5|$|Both sexes become {{sexually mature}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>they</b> are a year old; {{production}} of gametes begins even earlier at seven to ten months. However, successful mating takes place only at 12 to 15 months. Breeding takes place throughout the year. Oestrus, {{one to three}} days long, recurs every two weeks unless the female is pregnant. Females in oestrus show a spike in urine-marking, and form temporary pairs with males. Mating has not been extensively studied; limited number of observations suggest that copulation, that lasts nearly four minutes on an average, begins with the male smelling the areas urine-marked by the female, who rolls on the ground. Following this he approaches and mounts the female. The pair separate after copulation.|$|E

5|$|<b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>they</b> {{were ready}} for their first {{practical}} installation, they heard {{that one of their}} members, Girja Sharan, had obtained a grant to construct a dew condenser in Kothara, India. In April 2001, Sharan had incidentally noticed substantial condensation on the roof of a cottage at Toran Beach Resort in the arid coastal region of Kutch, where he was briefly staying. The following year, he investigated the phenomenon more closely and interviewed local people. Financed by the Gujarat Energy Development Agency and the World Bank, Sharan and his team went on to develop passive, radiative condensers for use in the arid coastal region of Kutch. Active commercialisation began in 2006.|$|E
5|$|Casualties were {{heaviest}} {{among the}} troops landing {{at either end}} of Omaha. In the east at Fox Green and the adjacent stretch of Easy Red, scattered elements of three companies were reduced to half strength <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>they</b> gained the relative safety of the shingle, many of them having crawled the 300 yards (270m) of beach just ahead of the incoming tide. Within 15 minutes of landing at Dog Green on the western end of the beach, A/116 had been cut to pieces, the leaders among the 120 or so casualties, the survivors reduced to seeking cover at the water's edge or behind obstacles. The smaller Ranger company to their right had fared a little better, having made the shelter of the bluffs, but were also down to half strength.|$|E
