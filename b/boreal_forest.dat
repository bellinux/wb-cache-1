50|$|<b>Boreal</b> <b>forests</b> {{are found}} in the {{northern}} regions of the United States. Canada is made up of <b>boreal</b> <b>forests.</b> These forests have long cold winters and short cool summers. Precipitation can reach over 200 centimeters per year typically in the form of snow. Because of the cold climate in the <b>boreal</b> <b>forests,</b> the growing season is 3 months long. <b>Boreal</b> <b>forests</b> are made up of evergreen trees, mosses, and lichens. Mosses are a plant species that thrive in areas that are moist. Mosses can tolerate dry periods as well by holding water and moisture in the dead leaves and cells. Lichens are organisms in the form of fungal filaments. Algae is a form of lichen in the <b>boreal</b> <b>forests.</b>|$|R

To achieve and protect sustainable development of <b>boreal</b> <b>forests</b> {{there is a need}} to arrange monitoring of <b>boreal</b> <b>forests</b> conditions. Its goal is to establish the scientific rationale for the required protection level, conservation and regeneration of <b>boreal</b> <b>forests,</b> and their use level. A new synthetic approach to sustainable development of the regional timber cluster evaluation (the Komi republic) is worked out, it considers the system integrity. A new methodology of sustainable development level calculation is introduced; it is based on a synthetic model of the timber cluster duality: forestry ? forest use and basic public relationship indicators. Conditions, opportunities and limits of sustainable development of <b>boreal</b> <b>forests</b> are considered. Methodical and practical schemes of sustainable regional timber cluster development evaluation are approved. Possible mechanisms of results use in the regional forest sector management practice are described, as well as sustainable development planning at the regional and company level. Integrated model of the timber cluster sustainable development and methods of <b>boreal</b> <b>forests</b> changes evaluation, required for its practical implementation are suggested to be used as the basic tool for the solution of a wide range of regional problems in strategic planning and sustainable management in <b>boreal</b> <b>forests.</b> One of important goals of forest planning and sustainable forest management is the evaluation of the resources and ecological potential of <b>boreal</b> <b>forests,</b> provision of balanced use and <b>boreal</b> <b>forests</b> regeneration, their evaluation and forecasting. The basic model of the forest cluster dynamic provides the possibility to achieve that goal, which has certain forest management strategies, forest use regimes and regeneration. By each fixed forest use and regeneration level a potential evaluation of the timber cluster sustainable development might be calculated, it's based on the dual optimization method that is a Cartesian product and ecological and economical limitations system that reflect the timber cluster sustainable development criteria and indicators...|$|R

5|$|The fisher (Pekania pennanti) {{is a small}} {{carnivorous}} mammal {{native to}} North America. It {{is a member of}} the mustelid family (commonly referred to as the weasel family) and is in the monospecific genus Pekania. The fisher is closely related to but larger than the American marten (Martes americana). The fisher is a forest-dwelling creature whose range covers much of the <b>boreal</b> <b>forest</b> in Canada to the northern United States. Names derived from aboriginal languages include pekan, pequam, wejack, and woolang. It is also called a fisher cat, although it is not a feline.|$|E
5|$|Although fishers are {{competent}} tree climbers, {{they spend}} most of their time on the forest floor and prefer continuous forest to other habitats. Fishers have been found in extensive conifer forests typical of the <b>boreal</b> <b>forest</b> but are also common in mixed hardwood and conifer forests. Fishers prefer areas with continuous overhead cover with greater than 80% coverage and will avoid areas with less than 50% coverage. Fishers are more likely to be found in old-growth forests. Since female fishers require moderately large trees for denning, forests that have been heavily logged and have extensive second growth appears to be unsuitable for their needs.|$|E
5|$|In 2016, two genetic {{studies of}} North American gray wolves {{found that they}} formed six {{ecotypes}} – genetically and ecologically distinct populations separated from other populations by their different type of habitat. These six wolf ecotypes were named West Forest, <b>Boreal</b> <b>Forest,</b> Arctic, High Arctic, Baffin, and British Columbia. The studies found that precipitation and mean diurnal temperature range were the most influential variables. These findings were in accord with previous studies that precipitation influenced morphology and that vegetation and habitat type influenced wolf differences. The local adaptation of a wolf ecotype most likely reflects a wolf's preference {{to remain in the}} type of habitat that it was born into.|$|E

5|$|In cool {{temperate}} regions, conifers often predominate; {{a widely}} distributed climax {{community in the}} far north of the northern hemisphere is moist taiga or northern coniferous forest (also called <b>boreal</b> <b>forest).</b> Taiga is the world's largest land biome, forming 29% of the world's forest cover. The long cold winter of the far north is unsuitable for plant growth and trees must grow rapidly in the short summer season when the temperature rises and the days are long. Light is very limited under their dense cover {{and there may be}} little plant life on the forest floor, although fungi may abound. Similar woodland is found on mountains where the altitude causes the average temperature to be lower thus reducing the length of the growing season.|$|E
5|$|The James Bay {{hydroelectric}} dam complex contains several {{relatively short}} 735kV power lines that send electricity to three principal substations, ordered from west to east: Radisson, Chissibi, and Lemoyne. From these substations, six 735kV power lines traverse the vast expanses of taiga and <b>boreal</b> <b>forest</b> in clear-cut stretches of land; this shows up clearly in aerial photos. The terrain {{that the power}} lines cross is {{for the most part}} not mountainous, but smooth and replete with lakes. Generally, four of the lines runs together in two pairs and the other two run solo, although the two single lines sometimes do run in a pair. Two intermediate 735kV power lines, one in the north and one in the south, connect all six power lines along their path to southern Quebec.|$|E
5|$|The United States Fish and Wildlife Service has {{continued}} to purchase and manage habitat in many areas to support the migratory stopover, wintering and breeding populations of the American black duck. In addition, the Montezuma National Wildlife Refuge has purchased and restored over 1,000 acres of wetlands to provide stopover habitat for over 10,000 American black ducks during fall migration. Also, the Atlantic Coast Joint Venture has been protecting the habitat of the American black duck through habitat restoration and land acquisition projects, mostly within their wintering and breeding areas.

40|$|Last {{century was}} marked by the rapid {{economical}} and scientific development: population increased by five-six times, energy use {{in the developed countries}} increased by hundred times, pollution of atmosphere and soil caused by technogenic emissions became global. Most fears among the scientists and politicians are dealing with the evident climate warming, which is exhibited in the northern regions. Against this background, the researches about the leading role of <b>boreal</b> <b>forests</b> in the carbon balance in giogeocenoses on land and regional economics attract a lot of interest. The analysis of the European <b>forest</b> fund and <b>boreal</b> <b>forests</b> of the Russian European North, including the Komi Republic was made and we developed the action plan, aiming at more efficient and careful use of <b>boreal</b> <b>forests.</b> Natural complex of the north European <b>boreal</b> <b>forests</b> ? is a unique natural unit, which plays the global biospheric role in the ecological balance control on the continent. It?s quite practical to make the international project ?<b>Boreal</b> <b>forests</b> of the European north? in order to preserve their ecological and protective role. Special attention should be paid to the <b>boreal</b> <b>forests</b> monitoring, by creating the integrated <b>boreal</b> <b>forests</b> monitoring system in both Western and Eastern Europe and the fact that in North-East of Europe, in the Cis-Ural region of Komi, there are remained huge pristine forest areas should be taken into account. Considering the great ecological and economical significance of the <b>boreal</b> <b>forests,</b> it?s very important to make the proposal about the international cooperation in rational use based on sustainable principles and productivity increase. Among the northern forest regions of the European North, the forest fund of the Komi republic attracts special attention, as it comprises the forth part of the <b>forest</b> covered <b>boreal</b> area and the tenth part of the total European forest area. Figuratively speaking, every tenth tree on the continent grows in the Komi republic. At the same time, nature protected areas make 1 / 3 of all forests in the republic and almost 40 mln hectors of forest covered area of the Komi republic make the landfill for carbon and are actively involved in the biospheric balance.

5|$|A {{number of}} field studies {{conducted}} in the <b>boreal</b> <b>forest</b> region of Northern Ontario (Canada) showed that A.sarcoides {{was found to be}} frequently associated with various deciduous and coniferous tree hosts that had been affected by the fungal disease known as heart rot; this discovery was noted as unusual, as most fungal tree infections are known to be caused by Basidiomycetes, not Ascomycetes. In the case of the commercially valuable tree species black spruce (Picea mariana), it was determined that prior colonization by A.sarcoides reduces the incidence of subsequent infection by common fungal pathogens, such as Fomes pini and Scytinostroma galactina; furthermore, A.sarcoides can exist in the wood with no noticeable harmful effects on the host. A similar relationship was shown later to exist with jack pine trees (species Pinus banksiana), whereby A.sarcoides inhibited Peniophora pseudopini, but had little effect on the subsequent growth of Fomes pini. The study also showed that A.sarcoides is isolated more frequently from defective wood as the age of the tree increases (trees examined in the study were over 80 years old), and that it can infect both uninfected heartwood as well as previously decayed wood; in the latter case it usually coexists with the causal fungi.|$|E
