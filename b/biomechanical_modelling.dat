This may have better allowed the various species of sauropods to exist without competition.With a laterally and dorsoventrally flexible neck, and the possibility of using its tail and rearing up on its hind limbs (tripodal ability), Diplodocus would have had the ability to browse at many levels (low, medium, and high), up to around 10 m (33 ft) from the ground. The neck's range of movement would have also allowed the head to graze below the level of the body, leading some scientists to speculate on whether Diplodocus grazed on submerged water plants, from riverbanks. This concept of the feeding posture is supported by the relative lengths of front and hind limbs. Furthermore, its peg-like teeth may have been used for eating soft water plants. Matthew Cobley et al. (2013) dispute this finding that large muscles and cartilage would have limited neck movements. They state that the feeding ranges for sauropods like Diplodocus were smaller than previously believed and the animals may have had to move their whole bodies around to better access areas where they could browse vegetation. As such, they might have spent more time foraging to meet their minimum energy needs. The conclusions of Cobley et al. were disputed in 2013 and 2014 by Mike Taylor, who analysed the amount and positioning of intervertebral cartilage to determine the flexibility of the neck of Diplodocus and Apatosaurus. Taylor found that the neck of Diplodocus was very flexible, and that Cobley [...] et al. were incorrect in that flexibility as implied by bones is less than in reality.|$|E

Such registration requires accounting for large differences between source and target images caused by deformations of soft organs/tissues and articulated motion of skeletal structures. The registration algorithms relying solely on image processing methods exhibit deficiencies in accounting for such deformations and motion. We propose to predict the deformations and movements of body organs/tissues and skeletal structures for whole-body CT image registration using patient-specific non-linear <b>biomechanical</b> <b>modelling.</b> Unlike the conventional <b>biomechanical</b> <b>modelling,</b> our approach for building the biomechanical models does not require time-consuming segmentation of CT scans to divide the whole body into non-overlapping constituents with different material properties. Instead, a Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) algorithm is used for tissue classification to assign the constitutive properties automatically at integration points of the computation grid. We use only very simple segmentation of the spine when determining vertebrae displacements to define loading for biomechanical models. We demonstrate the feasibility and accuracy of our approach on CT images of seven patients suffering from cancer and aortic disease. The results confirm that accurate whole-body CT image registration can be achieved using a patient-specific non-linear biomechanical model constructed without time-consuming segmentation of the whole-body images...|$|E

40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and was awarded by Brunel University. Moment arms are important in many contexts. Various methods {{have been used to}} estimate moment arms. It has been shown that a moment arm changes as a function of joint angle and contraction state. However, besides the influence of these anatomical factors, results from recent studies suggest that the estimation of moment arm is also dependent on the methods employed. The overall goal of this thesis was to explore the interaction between the methodological and anatomical influences on moment arm and their effect on estimates of muscle-tendon forces during <b>biomechanical</b> <b>modelling.</b> The first experiment was a direct comparison between two different moment arm methods that have been previously used for the estimation of Achilles tendon moment arm. The results of this experiment revealed a significant difference in Achilles tendon moment arm length dependent on the moment arm method employed. However, besides the differences found, results from both methods were well correlated. Based on these results, methodological differences between these two methods were compared across different joint angles and contraction states in study two. Results of experiment two revealed that Achilles tendon moment arms obtained using both methods change in a similar way as a function of joint angle and contraction state. In the third experiment, results from the first two experiments were used to determine how methodological and anatomical influences on Achilles tendon moment arm would change muscle-tendon forces during the task of submaximal cycling. Results of the third experiment showed the importance of taking the method, ankle angle and contraction state dependence of Achilles tendon moment arm into account when using <b>biomechanical</b> <b>modelling</b> techniques. Together, these findings emphasis the importance of carefully considering methodological and anatomical modifiers when estimating Achilles tendon moment arm...|$|E
40|$|Summary. <b>Biomechanical</b> <b>modelling</b> {{has become}} a very popular {{technique}} for investigating functional anatomy. Modern computer simulation packages make producing such models straightforward and {{it is tempting to}} take the results produced at face value. However the predictions of a simulation are only valid when both the model and the input parameters are accurate and little work has been done to verify this. In this paper a model of the hu-man jaw is produced and a sensitivity analysis is per-formed to validate the results. The model is built using the ADAMS multibody dynamic simulation package in-corporating the major occlusive muscles of mastication (temporalis, masseter, medial and lateral pterygoids) as well as a highly mobile temporomandibular joint. This model is used to predict the peak three-dimensional bite forces at each teeth location, joint reaction forces, and the contributions made by each individual muscle. The re-sults for occlusive bite-force (1080 N at M 1) match those previously published suggesting the model is valid. The sensitivity analysis was performed by sampling the input parameters from likely ranges and running the simulation many times rather than using single, best estimate values. This analysis shows that the magnitudes of the peak re-tractive forces on the lower teeth were highly sensitive to the chosen origin (and hence fibre direction) of the tem-poralis and masseter muscles as well as the laxity of the TMJ. Peak protrusive force was also sensitive to the mass-eter origin. These result shows that the model is insuffi-ciently complex to estimate these values reliably although the much lower sensitivity values obtained for the bite forces in the other directions and also for the joint reac-tion forces suggest that these predictions are sound. With-out the sensitivity analysis {{it would not have been}} possible to identify these weaknesses which strongly sup-ports the use of sensitivity analysis as a validation techni-que for <b>biomechanical</b> <b>modelling...</b>|$|E
