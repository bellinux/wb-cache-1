We find that the effects of gradient coupling on amplitude death in diffusive coupled nonidentical oscillators is quite different between those two <b>boundaries</b> <b>conditions.</b> With no-flux boundary conditions, there is a system size related critical gradient coupling $r_c$ within which the gradient coupling tends to monotonically enlarge the amplitude death domain in the parameter space. With the periodical boundary conditions, there is an optimal gradient coupling constant $r_o$ to realize largest AD domain. The gradient coupling first enlarges then decreases the amplitude death domain of diffusive coupled oscillators. The amplitude death domain of parameter space are analytically predicted for small number of gradient coupled oscillators. Comment: 20 pages, 7 figure...|$|E
