The -O suffix has {{generally}} been lost in Tariana, while the -nuku dependent-marking suffix has <b>been</b> <b>gained.</b> <b>In</b> any non-subject function, this suffix may be added to a noun. There is evidence that dependent markers have been gained via local diffusion, as all Tucano language in the area utilize dependent markers.

[...] Gage also worked with the newly arrived generals on a plan to break the grip of the besieging forces. They would use an amphibious assault {{to take control of the}} unoccupied Dorchester Heights, which would be followed up by an attack on the rebel camp at Roxbury. They would then seize the heights on the Charlestown peninsula, including Breed's Hill and Bunker Hill. This would allow the British to eventually take the colonial headquarters at Cambridge. The colonists were warned of these plans, and seized the initiative. On the night of 16–17 June, they fortified Breed's Hill, threatening the British position in Boston. On 17 June 1775, British forces under General Howe seized the Charlestown Peninsula at the Battle of Bunker Hill. [...] It was a Pyrrhic victory; Britain won but suffered more than 1,000 casualties without significantly altering the state of the siege. Henry Clinton called it [...] " [...] dear bought victory, another such would have ruined us", while other officers noted that nothing had <b>been</b> <b>gained</b> <b>in</b> the victory.

The divisions needed for the attack of the 1st Italian Army on the Eighth Army, were delayed for a week by the failure of Unternehmen Ochsenkopf and the Battle of Medenine was a costly failure. Allfrey was promoted to Major-General on 9 March. An Axis success would have meant the loss of Béja and the retirement of the Allied line along the northern sector, including a withdrawal from Medjez el Bab, which would have prolonged the campaign and interfered with Allied plans for the Allied invasion of Sicily.|$|E

60|$|All {{these signs}} of rage are {{probably}} in large part, {{and some of}} them appear to be wholly, due to the direct action of the excited sensorium. But animals of all kinds, and their progenitors before them, when attacked or threatened by an enemy, have exerted their utmost powers in fighting and in defending themselves. Unless an animal does thus act, or has the intention, or at least the desire, to attack its enemy, it cannot properly be said to be enraged. An inherited habit of muscular exertion will thus have <b>been</b> <b>gained</b> <b>in</b> association with rage; and this will directly or indirectly affect various organs, in nearly the same manner as does great bodily suffering.|$|E
60|$|Errors {{arising from}} the two causes just named, and from others,--such {{as some of the}} seeds not having been {{thoroughly}} ripened, though care was taken to avoid this error--the sickness or unperceived injury of any of the plants,--will have been to a large extent eliminated, in those cases in which many crossed and self-fertilised plants were measured and an average struck. Some of these causes of error will also have been eliminated by the seeds having been allowed to germinate on bare damp sand, and being planted in pairs; for it is not likely that ill-matured and well-matured, or diseased and healthy seeds, would germinate at exactly the same time. The same result will have <b>been</b> <b>gained</b> <b>in</b> the several cases in which {{only a few of the}} tallest, finest, and healthiest plants on each side of the pots were measured.|$|E
60|$|The {{scholarly}} {{method has}} now been applied for many years, {{and what are the}} results? The ideas attained by the method have been so popularised that they are actually made to enter into the education of children, and are published in primers and catechisms of mythology. But what has a discreet scholar to say to the whole business? 'The difficult task of interpreting mythical names has, so far, produced few certain results'--so writes Otto Schrader. {4} Though Schrader still has hopes of better things, it is admitted that the present results are highly disputable. In England, where one set of these results has become an article of faith, readers chiefly accept the opinions of a single etymological school, and thus escape the difficulty of making up their minds when scholars differ. But differ scholars do, so widely and so often, that scarcely any solid advantages have <b>been</b> <b>gained</b> <b>in</b> mythology from the philological method.|$|E

60|$|It is, however, {{when we come}} to true fruits (in {{a popular}} sense) that we find varied colours evidently {{intended}} to attract animals, in order that the fruits may be eaten, while the seeds pass through the body undigested and are then in the fittest state for germination. This end has <b>been</b> <b>gained</b> <b>in</b> a great variety of ways, and with so many corresponding adaptations as to leave no doubt as to the value of the result. Fruits are pulpy or juicy, and usually sweet, and form the favourite food of innumerable birds and some mammals. They are always coloured so as to contrast with the foliage or surroundings, red being the most common as it is certainly the most conspicuous colour, but yellow, purple, black, or white being not uncommon. The edible portion of fruits is developed from different parts of the floral envelopes, or of the ovary, in the various orders and genera. Sometimes the calyx becomes enlarged and fleshy, as in the apple and pear tribe; more often the integuments of the ovary itself are enlarged, as in the plum, peach, grape, etc.; the receptacle is enlarged and forms the fruit of the strawberry; while the mulberry, pineapple, and fig are examples of compound fruits formed in various ways from a dense mass of flowers.|$|E
60|$|Although {{the first}} dawnings of intelligence, {{according}} to Mr. Herbert Spencer,[48] {{have been developed}} through the multiplication and co-ordination of reflex actions, and {{although many of the}} simpler instincts graduate into actions of this kind and can hardly be distinguished from them, {{as in the case of}} young animals sucking, yet the more complex instincts seem to have originated independently of intelligence. I am, however, far from wishing to deny that instinctive actions may lose their fixed and untaught character, and be replaced by others performed by the aid of the free will. On the other hand, some intelligent actions—as when, birds on oceanic islands first learn to avoid man—after being performed during many generations, become converted into instincts and are inherited. They may then be said to be degraded in character, for they are no longer performed through reason or from experience. But the greater number of the more complex instincts appear to have <b>been</b> <b>gained</b> <b>in</b> a wholly different manner, through the natural selection of variations of simpler instinctive actions. Such variations appear to arise from the same unknown causes acting on the cerebral organisation, which induce slight variations or individual differences in other parts of the body; and these variations, owing to our ignorance, are often said to arise spontaneously. We can, I think, come to no other conclusion with respect to the origin of the more complex instincts, when we reflect on the marvellous instincts of sterile worker-ants and bees, which leave no offspring to inherit the effects of experience and of modified habits.|$|E
