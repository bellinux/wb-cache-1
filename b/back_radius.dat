40|$|The {{parameters}} of soft contact lenses may alter during wear. A series of clinical and laboratory experiments {{were conducted in}} order to examine the parameter stability of eight soft contact lenses manufactured from different materials. The following materials (and nominal water contents) were used: HEMA/VP 40 %, HEMA/VP 55 %, HEMA/VP 70 %, VP/MMA 55 %, VP/MMA 70 %, HEMA 40 %, HEMA/MAA 55 % and HEMA/MAA 70 % (HEMA: 2 -hydroxy-ethyl methacrylate, VP: vinyl pyrrolidone, MMA: methyl methacrylate, MAA: methacrylic acid). Two lenses from each of the eight soft contact lens groups were used in experiments concerning the parameter stability. Six subjects were fitted with lenses for 1 day. Verification of <b>back</b> optic zone <b>radius,</b> total diameter, <b>back</b> vertex power, centre thickness and water content was undertaken at 20 degrees C. In vitro measurements of water content, oxygen transmissibility, total diameter and <b>back</b> optic zone <b>radius</b> were taken at 35 degrees C before lens fitting and after 6 h of lens wear. Distortion, discolouration and lens quality were assessed before and after lens wear. When the temperature was raised from 20 to 35 degrees C, a significant reduction in lens water content for all the lens types was observed, as well as a significant reduction in total lens diameter {{for the majority of the}} lens types. Water content, oxygen transmissibility, total diameter and <b>back</b> optic zone <b>radius</b> of all the lens types reduced, following a 6 h open eye wearing period. For the majority of the lens types, these changes were found to be statistically significant. Distortion, discolouration and quality of the lenses remained unchanged throughout the study with the exception of the HEMA/MAA 70 % lens. Correlating a number of parameters generated in this study, gave the following conclusions. High water content materials exhibit a low relative change in oxygen transmissibility following a 6 h wear period. Soft contact lens dehydration leads to a decrease in oxygen transmissibility and total diameter, following a 6 h wear period. These results will assist practitioners in predicting the alterations that occur in soft contact lens parameters and oxygen performance as a result of lens wear...|$|R

Methods: Measurements of 27 soft spherical contact lenses were made using the Optimec JCF and a new OCT based instrument, the Optimec is 830. Twelve of the lenses analysed were specially commissioned from a traditional hydrogel (Contamac GM Advance 49 %) and 12 from a silicone hydrogel (Contamac Definitive 65), each set with a range of <b>back</b> optic zone <b>radius</b> (BOZR) and centre thickness (CT) values. Three commercial lenses were also measured; CooperVision MyDay (Stenfilcon A) in − 10 D, − 3 D and + 6 D powers. Two measurements of BOZR, CT and total diameter were made for each lens in temperature controlled saline on both instruments. Results: The results showed that the is 830 and JCF measurements were comparable, but that the is 830 had a better repeatability coefficient for BOZR (0. 065 mm compared to 0. 151 mm) and CT (0. 008 mm compared to 0. 027 mm). Both instruments had similar results for total diameter (0. 041 mm compared to 0. 044 mm).

50|$|Base curve radius, {{or simply}} base curve, {{abbreviated}} BCR or BC, {{is the measure}} of one important parameter of a lens in optometry.

Typical values for a contact lens are from 8.0 to 10.0 mm. The base curve is the radius of the sphere {{of the back of the}} lens that the prescription describes (the lower the number, the steeper the curve of the cornea and the lens, the higher the number, the flatter the curve of the cornea and the lens). This number is important in order to allow the contact lens to fit well to the wearer's cornea for comfort, to facilitate tear exchange, and to allow oxygen transmission.|$|R

40|$|The {{strength}} of contact lens materials {{is an important}} consideration with respect to resistance to damage during lens handling and long term durability, and may govern some aspects of in-eye lens performance. The tensile properties of hydrogel contact lenses manufactured from eight different materials were examined {{in a series of}} clinical and laboratory experiments using the Instron 1122 Universal Testing Instrument. Lenses from the following eight materials (and nominal water contents) were used: HEMA/VP 40 %, HEMA/VP 55 %, HEMA/VP 70 %, VP/MMA 55 %, VP/MMA 70 %, HEMA 40 %, HEMA/MAA 55 % and HEMA/MAA 70 % (HEMA: 2 -hydroxy-ethyl methacrylate, VP: vinyl pyrrolidone, MMA: methyl methacrylate, MAA: methacrylic acid). Tensile strength, elongation-at-break and Young's modulus were measured. A technique was devised that enables three parallel-sided specimens of identical width to be cut from a single contact lens with good accuracy. It was found that materials made from HEMA/MAA [...] although having a very low tensile strength and elongation-at-break [...] exhibit only a moderate Young's modulus. Materials made from HEMA/VP exhibit high-to-moderate tensile strength, high elongation-at-break and moderate-to-low Young's modulus. Materials made from VP/MMA exhibit high tensile strength and high-to-moderate elongation-at-break, but the Young's modulus is high for the 55 % water content and low for the 70 % water content materials. The HEMA 40 % material exhibits a moderate tensile strength, a low elongation-at-break and a high Young's modulus. This experiment highlights the necessity of developing an accepted standard test methodology for contact lens material stiffness evaluation, in order to derive useful comparative information. Six subjects were fitted with the same lenses for one day. In vitro measurements of total diameter and <b>back</b> optic zone <b>radius</b> were taken at 35 degrees C before lens fitting and after 6 h of lens wear. Lens water content, the relative change in lens total diameter (%deltaTD) and relative change in lens <b>back</b> optic zone <b>radius</b> (%deltaBOZR) were calculated and correlated with the tensile properties of the eight hydrogel lens materials.

Four fenestrated lenses were tested, each lens containing four mid-peripheral fenestrations of the same size. The diameter of the fenestrations used in the four lenses ranged from 0. 39 to 0. 96 mm. An unfenestrated lens was also tested. All lenses were made of HEMA and were ordered with the following specifications: - 3. 00 D, 14. 0 mm diameter, 8. 4 mm <b>back</b> central optic <b>radius</b> and 0. 06 mm centre thickness. There was a significant negative correlation between comfort and fenestration size, indicating that larger fenestrations are less comfortable. Even the lens with the smallest fenestrations (0. 39 mm) was significantly less comfortable than the unfenestrated lens. The implication of this finding is that fenestrations may not be clinically efficacious in view of the poor comfort (and presumably increased mechanical effect of the fenestration edges on the tarsal conjunctiva) of fenestrated lenses...|$|R
30|$|What {{explains}} the substantial {{improvement in the}} RAPID core radii? In Rodriguez et al. (2016 a), we explored a direct comparison between CMC and a state-of-the-art direct N-body simulation of 106 particles (the DRAGON simulation, Wang et al. 2016). There, we found good agreement between most of the structural parameters of the two cluster models (e.g., the half-mass radii, the formation and ejection rate of BHs, etc.). However, the one notable exception was {{the evolution of the}} inner parts of the cluster such as the core radii and the inner-most Lagrange radii (the radius enclosing a certain fraction of the cluster mass). This was especially true when considering the Lagrange radii of only the BHs (Rodriguez et al. 2016 a, Fig.  7), where the inner-most few BHs would fall into a much deeper state of collapse (by nearly two orders of magnitude) into the cluster center than the equivalent radii from the N-body model. The cluster would remain in this deep state until the formation of a BH binary, which would reverse this deep collapse and bring the inner Lagrange <b>radii</b> <b>back</b> into agreement with the N-body results.|$|R
30|$|One {{of the key}} {{contributions}} of rigidity-based approach is that it provides how to systematically construct globally rigid graphs (in other words, localizable graphs), using trilateration from graphs without this property. Construction involves sensors determining distances not just to their immediate neighbors, but also to their two- and three-hop distant neighbors [19]. This corresponds to increasing the sensing radius temporarily by adjusting transmit powers for each sensor. In the case of determining distances to two-hop neighbors, doubling of the sensing radius will suffice. Indeed, an advantage of this construction-based approach is that during deployment, sensors can first perform simple topology control (using, for example, measurement power control) to construct a topology with simple connectivity-based properties. Then using construction-based operation, the network constructs a localizable topology. Once the localization of each node is achieved, sensor nodes decrease their sensing <b>radii</b> <b>back</b> to one-hop distances. The following results summarize the methods provided by Anderson et al. in [19]. Suppose G is connected. G 2 is generated by doubling the sensing radius, and G 3 is generated by trebling the sensing radius. First, if G is an edge 2 -connected graph in ℝ 2, then G 2 is globally rigid. Secondly, if G is a connected graph in ℝ 2, then G 3 is globally rigid.|$|R

Piggyback contact lens fittings combining Senofilcon-A soft lenses of − 6. 00, − 3. 00, + 3. 00 and + 6. 00 D with Rose K 2 RGP contact lenses were performed. Corneal topography was taken on the naked eye and over each soft contact lens before fitting RGP lenses. Mean central keratometry, over-refraction, RGP <b>back</b> optic zone <b>radius</b> (BOZR) and estimated final power as well as VA were recorded and analyzed. Results: In comparison to the naked eye, the mean central keratometry flattened with both negative lens powers (p 0. 05). RGP’s BOZR decreased significantly with both positive in comparison with both negative soft lens powers (all p 0. 05). Estimated RGP’s final power increased significantly with positive in comparison with negative lens powers (all p 0. 05). Visual acuity did not change significantly between the different soft lens powers assessed (all p > 0. 05).

Subsequent relaxation of the inner disk could account for the observed X-ray enhancement light curve of Swift J 1822. 3 - 1606. We obtain model fits to the X-ray data with basic disk parameters similar to those employed to explain the X-ray outburst light curves of other anomalous X-ray pulsars and soft gamma repeaters. The long period (8. 4 s) of the neutron star can be reached by the effect of the disk torques in the long-term accretion phase ((1 - 3) x 10 (5) yr). The currently ongoing X-ray enhancement could be due to a transient accretion epoch, or the source could still be in the accretion phase in quiescence. Considering these different possibilities, we determine the model curves that could represent the long-term rotational and the X-ray luminosity evolution of Swift J 1822. 3 - 1606, which constrain the strength of the magnetic dipole field to the range of (1 - 2) x 10 (12) G {{on the surface of the}} neutron star...|$|R

Next, when the RADIUS server has available AVs, key generation procedures are launched immediately. First, old fast re-authentication identity, Nonce_S, Counter_S, and MK are used as seeds to generate new MK (XKEY) key calculated as XKEY = SHA- 1 (fast re-authentication identity || Counter_S || Nonce_S || MK) where '||' denotes a concatenation operation.

Methods: One hundred and twenty-three consecutive ortho-k patient files from the Optometry Clinic of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University were reviewed. Pertinent data at the preliminary visit and at the morning visit after 2 weeks of lens wear for 63 patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria were retrieved for analysis. All patients were either fitted with DreimLens (DreimLens Taiwan, Taiwan Macro Vision Group, Taiwan, China) or eLens (E&E Optics Ltd., Hong Kong SAR, China) designs. Only data from the right eye were analysed. The validity of the Jessen formula was evaluated by comparing the equation of the plot of myopic reduction attempted (based on the Jessen formula) and myopic reduction achieved (based on subjective refraction). Results: The Jessen formula was found to underestimate the intended target of myopic reduction following ortho-k. The results suggested that the formula should be revised to BOZR = flattest K - (1. 23 target reduction + 1. 27). Conclusion: If the intention is to overcorrect the ortho-k patient by 0. 75 D to allow for regression during the daytime, the Jessen formula with a compression factor of 0. 75 is not valid to determine the BOZR of the ortho-k lens designs.

40|$|Keratoconus is a non-inflammatory corneal {{disease that}} {{progressively}} causes topographical alteration of the cornea {{as a result}} of thinning, and consequently leads to impaired vision. In this thesis, the clinical studies are showed that the incidence rate and severity of keratoconus in Asir province, Saudi Arabia is high with an early onset and more rapid progress to the severe disease stage at a young age compared to other countries. The result also showed that the disease required different contact lens designs to be available in the clinics and the selection of initial <b>back</b> optic zone <b>radius</b> for multiple contact lens designs should be based in the steepest keratometric reading in early stage, and on average keratometric reading on moderate and advanced stages. However, regardless of the stage of disease, tricurve contact lens design should be selected based on average keratometric reading. Ultrastructure investigation of the anterior surface of Bowman's layer using different microscopes revealed that the changes are not limited to the apical cone only, but extend to the periphery of the cornea especially in the advances stage of keratoconus. Also, although the topographical map is usually used in trephination, {{it was found that the}} topographical features alone failed to indicate the full extent of the progress of keratoconus towards the corneal periphery.

MethodsThirty-one keratoconus subjects (50 eyes) without previous history of CL wear were recruited for the study. Subjects were randomly fitted to either an apical-touch or three-point-touch fitting approach. The lens’ <b>back</b> optic zone <b>radius</b> (BOZR) was 0. 4 mm and 0. 1 mm flatter {{than the first}} definite apical clearance lens, respectively. Differences between the baseline and post-CL wear for steepest, flattest and average corneal power (ACP) readings, central corneal astigmatism (CCA), maximum tangential curvature (KTag), anterior corneal surface asphericity, anterior corneal surface HOA and thinnest corneal thickness measured with Pentacam were compared. ResultsA statistically significant flattening was found over time on the flattest and steepest simulated keratometry and ACP in apical-touch group (all p< 0. 01). A statistically significant reduction in KTag was found in both groups after contact lens wear (all p< 0. 05). Significant reduction was found over time in CCA (p= 0. 001) and anterior corneal asphericity in both groups (p< 0. 001). Thickness at the thinnest corneal point increased significantly after CL wear (p< 0. 0001). Coma-like and total HOA root mean square (RMS) error were significantly reduced following CL wearing in both fitting approaches (all p< 0. 05). ConclusionShort-term rigid gas-permeable CL wear flattens the anterior cornea, increases the thinnest corneal thickness and reduces anterior surface HOA in keratoconus subjects. Apical-touch was associated with greater corneal flattening in comparison to three-point-touch lens wear...|$|R

In a galactic fountain, the ejected gas is re-captured by the gravitational potential and falls back onto the disk. From 3 D non-equilibrium radiative cooling hydrodynamical simulations of these fountains, we find that they may reach altitudes smaller than 5 kpc in the halo and hence explain {{the formation of the}} so-called intermediate-velocity-clouds (IVCs) often observed above the disk of these galaxies. On the other hand, the high-velocity-clouds (HVCs) that are observed at higher altitudes (of up to 12 kpc) require another mechanism to explain their production. We argue that they could be formed either by the capture of gas from the intergalactic medium and/or by the action of magnetic fields that are carried out to the halo with the gas in the fountains. Due to angular momentum losses (of 10 ¿ 15 %) to the halo, we find that the fountain material falls <b>back</b> to smaller <b>radii</b> and is not largely spread over the galactic disk, as previously expected, but falls near the region where the fountain was produced This result is consistent with the metal distribution derived from recent chemical models of the galaxy. We also find that after about 150 Myr, the gas circulation between the halo and the disk in the fountains reaches a steady state regime, and this is relatively insensitive to the galacto-centric distance where the fountains are produced. The fall back material leads to the formation of new generations of complex structures that help to feed the supersonic turbulence in the disk...|$|R
40|$|We {{have used}} HST/COS {{to obtain a}} series of 4 FUV (915 - 2148 A) spectroscopic {{observations}} of the prototypical dwarf nova U Geminorum during its cooling following a two-week outburst. Our FUV spectral {{analysis of the data}} indicates that the white dwarf (WD) cools from a temperature of 41, 500 K, 15 days after the peak of the outburst, to 36, 250 K, 56 days after the peak of the outburst, assuming a massive WD (log(g) = 8. 8) and a distance of 100. 4 pc. These results are self-consistent with a 1. 1 solar mass WD with a 5, 000 km radius. The spectra show many absorption lines of but no emission features. We find supra-solar abundances of nitrogen confirming the anomalous high N/C ratio. The FUV lightcurve reveals a 5 % modulation with the orbital phase, showing dips near phase 0. 25 and 0. 75, where the spectra exhibit an increase in the depth of some absorption lines and in particular strong absorption lines from Si, Al, and Ar. The phase dependence we observe is consistent with material overflowing the disk rim at the hot spot, reaching a maximum elevation near phase 0. 75, falling <b>back</b> at smaller <b>radii</b> near phase 0. 5 where it bounces off the disk surface and again rising above the disk near phase 0. 25. There is a large scatter in the absorption lines' velocities, especially for the silicon lines, while the carbon lines seem to match more closely the orbital velocity of the WD. This indicates that many absorption lines are affected by- or form in- the overflowing stream material veiling the WD, making the analysis of the WD spectra more difficult.

40|$|We here {{explore the}} effects of the SN explosions into the {{environment}} of star-forming galaxies like the Milky Way. Successive randomly distributed and clustered SNe explosions cause the formation of hot superbubbles that drive either fountains or galactic winds above the galactic disk, depending on the amount and concentration of energy that is injected by the SNe. In a galactic fountain, the ejected gas is re-captured by the gravitational potential and falls back onto the disk. From 3 D nonequilibrium radiative cooling hydrodynamical simulations of these fountains, we find that they may reach altitudes up to about 5 kpc in the halo and thus allow for the formation of the so called intermediate-velocity-clouds (IVCs) which are often observed in the halos of disk galaxies. The high-velocity-clouds that are also observed but at higher altitudes (of up to 12 kpc) require another mechanism to explain their production. We argue that they could be formed either by the capture of gas from the intergalactic medium and/or by the action of magnetic fields that are carried to the halo with the gas in the fountains. Due to angular momentum losses to the halo, we find that the fountain material falls <b>back</b> to smaller <b>radii</b> and is not largely spread over the galactic disk. Instead, the SNe ejecta fall nearby the region where the fountain was produced, a result which is consistent with recent chemical models of the galaxy. The fall back material leads to the formation of new generations of molecular clouds and to supersonic turbulence feedback in the disk.

40|$|Lameness, an {{increasing}} animal welfare problem, {{has a negative}} impact on milk production, body condition and reproductive performance in dairy cows [1, 2 and 3]. The objective of this research is to develop and analyze image parameters correlated with expert gait scores that are applicable for continuous lameness detection. Experiments were done on ILVO farm in Ghent Belgium in August/September 2007. A camera recorded postures and movements of 10 lactating Holstein cows while passing the corridor to the pasture outside the barn. The gait of the cows was scored by experts on a scale of 1 to 3. Image features of track way overlap and spine arch were investigated by using labelled countour points. The trackway overlap can be described by the distance between the placement of the fore hoof on the floor and the placement of the hind hoof on the floor (see Figure 1). Within the spine arch 2 corresponding values can be calculated: the curvature of the <b>back</b> and the <b>radius</b> as a basis of the curvature (see Figure 2). Results show that each calculated image feature has a relation to the expert scores on lameness. Regarding the parameter trackway overlap, The cows with walking problems have higher locomotion scores and greater positive trackway overlap values at least in one leg. The results of the parameter spine arch show that in between the 10 cows the curvature of the back becomes more convex with high gait score. The radius has a linear relation to the curvature and becomes smaller with {{an increasing}} convexity and a higher gait score. It shows track way overlap and spine arch are useful image features for lameness detection. A further goal is the development of an automatic on-line lameness detection tool after analyzing more lame cows and more image features. status: accepte...|$|R
40|$|The in-eye {{performance}} of soft contact lenses {{may be affected}} by the material from which they are fabricated and may alter during wear. This study describes clinical and laboratory experiments that were conducted in order to examine the in-eye {{performance of}} eight soft contact lenses manufactured from different materials; these materials (and nominal water contents) were: HEMA/VP 40 %, HEMA/VP 55 %, HEMA/VP 70 %, VP/MMA 55 %, VP/MMA 70 %, HEMA 40 %, HEMA/MAA 55 % and HEMA/MAA 70 % (HEMA: 2 -hydroxy-ethyl methacrylate, VP: vinyl pyrrolidone, MMA: methyl methacrylate, MAA: methacrylic acid). Two lenses from each of the eight soft contact lens groups were used in experiments concerning their parameter stability. Six subjects were fitted with lenses for 1 day. Verification of <b>back</b> optic zone <b>radius,</b> total diameter, <b>back</b> vertex power, centre thickness and water content was undertaken at 20 degrees C. In vitro measurements of total diameter were taken at 35 degrees C before lens fitting and after 6 h of lens wear. In vivo measurements of lens centration, up-gaze lag, post-blink movement, total diameter and subjective assessment of comfort were taken (a) immediately after lens insertion (1 min), (b) 20 min later and (c) 6 h later (same day). The majority of differences of the in vivo parameters between lens types (with respect to lens centration, lag, movement on blink, lens total diameter and comfort) were not found to be statistically significant throughout the 6 h wearing period. It was also found that lenses increase in diameter when first placed on the eye and decrease in diameter when they were removed from the eye. The information generated in study concerning the in-eye performance of soft contact lens materials may assist the contact lens industry and contact lens practitioners in developing and prescribing soft lenses with optimal performance characteristics...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{compare the}} number of ordered lenses {{required}} to achieve an optimal lens fit between three-point-touch and apical touch fittings in keratoconus subjects with nipple and oval cones using the first definite apical clearance lens (FDACL) as a starting point. Methods: First trial lens was selected following manufacturer’s guidelines and the <b>back</b> optic zone <b>radius</b> (BOZR) was flattened or steepened in 0. 10 mm steps until a FDACL was found. Subsequently, subjects were randomly allocated to three-point-touch (BOZR 0. 10 mm flatter than FDACL) and apical touch fittings (BOZR 0. 40 mm flatter than FDACL). Changes were made solely in total lens diameter, edge lift, and/or back vertex power until an optimal lens fit was achieved. Differences between fitting approaches were compared in terms of optimal lens fit rates defined {{as the percentage of}} subjects successfully fitted with the first lens ordered from the manufacturer. Results: Sixty-one subjects (109 eyes) were randomly allocated to threepoint- touch and apical touch fitting approaches. An average of 2. 3 trial lenses were necessary to achieve the FDACL. An optimal lens fit rate was achieved with the first lens in 84 of 109 eyes (77 %). No statistically significant differences in optimal lens fit rates were found between three-point-touch and apical touch fitting approaches (83 % and 71 %, respectively; P = 0. 12) and between nipple and oval cones (81 % and 68 %, respectively; P = 0. 12). Conclusions: The use of the FDACL provides a systematic, reliable, and repeatable starting point for Rose K 2 contact lens fitting in keratoconus. Eye care practitioners should anticipate higher optimal lens fit rates when using three-point-touch (83 %) in comparison with apical touch contact lens fittings (71 %). J.

40|$|Purpose To {{examine the}} {{influence}} of lens centre thickness on the in-vitro and in-vivo (lens on eye) flexure of miniscleral contact lenses. Methods Nine subjects with normal corneae participated (mean age 25 ± 4 years, including 7 females and 2 males, 6 Caucasians and 3 Asians). Three spherical miniscleral lenses (Irregular Corneal Design, Capricornia, Australia) of different centre thickness (150 µm, 250 µm and 350 µm) were used. The lenses were made from hexafocon B with the same <b>back</b> optic zone <b>radius,</b> total diameter, <b>back</b> vertex power and sagittal depth. In-vitro lens flexure was measured using a videokeratoscope (Medmont E 300, Australia) with the contact lens mounted in a customised lens holder. In-vivo lens flexure was measured using the videokeratoscope after a 15 minute settling period following lens insertion. The order of lens wear was randomised between subjects. Mean axial power maps were calculated from the over-topography data for each miniscleral lens. The anterior lens surface astigmatism derived from the best-fit spherocylinder was used to quantify the magnitude of lens flexure. Results In-vitro lens flexure was significantly greater for the 150 µm lens (0. 20 ± 0. 04 D) compared to the 250 µm (0. 06 ± 0. 03 D) and 350 µm lenses (0. 07 ± 0. 02 D) (p < 0. 001). However, in-vivo lens flexure did not vary significantly with lens centre thickness; 150 µm lens (0. 45 ± 0. 39 D), 250 µm lens (0. 36 ± 0. 31 D), 350 µm lens (0. 40 ± 0. 27 D) (p = 0. 58). Conclusions Decreasing the centre thickness of the ICD miniscleral lens to 150 µm, while controlling for other lens parameters, did not significantly alter in-vivo lens flexure. Minimising the centre thickness of ICD miniscleral lenses may be a possible method to improve the oxygen transmissibility of lenses made from lower Dk materials without inducing clinically significant lens flexure...|$|R
