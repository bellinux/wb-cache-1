40|$|Background: Ultrasonic {{evaluation}} of intima-media thickness (IMT) {{is an early}} marker of assessing the development of atherosclerosis and determining cardiovascular risk. To attain the best possible diagnosis, {{it is essential that}} medical images be clear, sharp and without noise and artifacts. Objectives: Comparison of speckle reducing anisotropic diffusion (SRAD), discrete (DTD) and continuum topological derivative (CTD) on B-mode ultrasound images of common carotid and <b>brachial</b> <b>arteries</b> throughout the cardiac cycle. Patients and Methods: In a cross-sectional design, an examination was performed on forty-two human subjects {{with a mean age of}} 44 Â± 6 years from April 2013 to June 2013. This study was approved by the ethics committees of Kashan University of Medical Sciences and Beheshti Hospital. An ultrasonic examination of common carotid and <b>brachial</b> <b>arteries</b> of forty-two human subjects was performed. The program was designed in MATLAB software to extract consecutive B-mode images and apply region of interest (ROI) on the IMT of the common carotid and <b>brachial</b> <b>arteries.</b> Then, three different noise reduction filters with the Canny edge detection were used in ROI separately. Finally, the program measured the image quality metrics. Results: According to values of eleven different image quality metrics (mentioned in the main text), there was a significant difference between CTD, DTD and SRAD filters with the Canny edge detection status in the common carotid and <b>brachial</b> <b>arteries</b> throughout the cardiac cycle (all P values < 0. 001). For example, peak signal to noise ratios (PSNR) using CTD, DTD and SRAD filters were 95. 43 Â± 0. 64, 88. 86 Â± 0. 82 and 73. 02 Â± 0. 20 in common carotid and 96. 39 Â± 1. 25, 92. 58 Â± 0. 11 and 88. 27 Â± 0. 63 in <b>brachial</b> <b>arteries,</b> respectively (both P values < 0. 001). Conclusions: By measuring image quality metrics, this study showed that DTD and CTD filters with the Canny edge detection respectively, are better than SRAD filter with the Canny detection for speckle suppression and details preservation in both arteries in the ultrasound images.

500|$|Although {{his mother}} was a Jehovah's Witness, Fleury was raised as a Roman Catholic. He {{attended}} mass from age 6 to 12, serving as an altar boy until the church's priest died of a heart attack, depriving Fleury of one of his earliest positive influences. Always lacking money and a stable home, Fleury received support from the community, in particular the Peltz family in Russell, who ensured that he and his brothers were fed and bought them new clothes when required. In January 1982, Fleury's dreams of playing in the NHL nearly ended at the age of 13 when, during a game, he suffered a deep cut under his arm that severed his <b>brachial</b> <b>artery.</b> He missed nearly a year of contact hockey as a result. Five months after the incident, the community raised money to send him to the Andy Murray Hockey School in Brandon, Manitoba. It was there that Fleury met Graham James, who was working as a scout for the Winnipeg Warriors of the Western Hockey League (WHL). [...] James told Fleury that he had the skill to play in the NHL despite his size, and promised to recruit him to play junior hockey for the Warriors when he was old enough.|$|E

40|$|Type I {{diabetic}} patients (DM- 1) with {{an elevated}} urinary albumin excretion (UAE> 30 mg/ 24 h) {{have a high}} cardiovascular risk. However, DM- 1 patients with normal UAE have incipient abnormalities of the cardiovascular and nervous systems, such as elevations of blood pressures, increases in arterial stiffness and deterioration of autonomic nervous function. We studied the interrelationships of these abnormalities in normoalbuminuric DM- 1 patients. In 76 patients, we performed two cardiovascular reflex tests (deep in- and expiration test (IE test) and lying-to-standing test (LS test)), and determined aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV), local arterial compliances of the common carotid, femoral and <b>brachial</b> <b>arteries,</b> and 24 -h blood pressures. The DeltaRRmax value of the LS test was associated with aortic PWV (negatively) and the compliance coefficients of the carotid, femoral and <b>brachial</b> <b>arteries.</b> Per 100 -ms increase in DeltaRRmax, pulse wave velocity decreased by 0. 39 m/s, compliance coefficients of the carotid, femoral and <b>brachial</b> <b>arteries</b> increased by 0. 06, 0. 08 and 0. 05 mm 2 /kPa, respectively. These associations were independent of age, 24 -h mean arterial pressure and 24 -h heart rate. Increases in arterial stiffness were associated with increases in 24 -h systolic and pulse pressure (per 1 m/s increase in PWV, systolic and pulse pressure increased by 2. 1 and 1. 7 mmHg, respectively). In normoalbuminuric DM- 1 patients, deterioration of autonomic nervous function is associated {{with an increase in}} arterial stiffness, which, in turn, was associated with, and may cause, increased systolic and pulse pressure.

AIM: The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of medical treatment with the GH receptor antagonist pegvisomant on vascular structure and function in acromegalic patients resistant to somatostatin analogues. PATIENTS: Ten patients (4 males and 6 females, 28 - 58 yr) and 20 sex-, age-, and body mass index-matched healthy controls entered the study. All patients were treated for 18 months with pegvisomant at doses ranging from 10 to 40 mg/day. OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome measures were measurement of carotid arteries intima-media thickness (IMT), and <b>brachial</b> <b>arteries</b> flow mediated dilation (FMD); secondary outcome measures were blood pressure, blood glucose and lipids levels. RESULTS: Carotid arteries maximal IMT was significantly higher in patients than in controls at baseline (1. 18 ± 0. 59 vs 0. 69 ± 0. 13, p= 0. 001) and slightly, but not significantly, decreased after treatment (0. 97 ± 0. 17). <b>Brachial</b> <b>arteries</b> FMD was significantly lower in patients than controls at baseline (7. 5 ± 2. 5 vs 13. 1 ± 1. 4, p< 0. 001) and significantly increased after treatment (8. 8 ± 3. 7, p= 0. 016). Systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure values, serum glucose and insulin levels and homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) index were higher, whereas HDL-cholesterol levels were lower in patients than controls at baseline. After treatment, SBP and DBP, as well as serum glucose and insulin levels and HOMA index significantly decreased whereas no significant change was found in serum lipid profile. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study suggested that long-term treatment with pegvisomant induced a slight reduction of carotid arteries wall thickness and a significant improvement of <b>brachial</b> <b>arteries</b> vascular function in patients with acromegaly resistant to somatostatin analogues...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Arterial {{stiffness}} {{increases with}} ageing and hypertension. Regular physical activity has been recommended {{as an important}} management component of hypertension. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the acute impact of maximal dynamic exercise and the effect of 20 weeks of aerobic exercise on arterial stiffness of the carotid and <b>brachial</b> <b>arteries</b> in older hypertensives. Nine previously sedentary and treated older hypertensives (2 men and 7 women, age 68. 2 ± 5. 4 yrs) performed maximal treadmill exercise to volitional fatigue while arterial stiffness indices (arterial distensibility and � stiffness index) were measured prior to, immediately (about 10 min) following, and 24 h following maximal exercise. These measurements were repeated following 20 weeks of moderate intensity aerobic exercise training. Maximal exercise had no impact on arterial stiffness indices immediately and 24 h following exercise intervention. Following 20 weeks of training, arterial stiffness indices remained unchanged at rest and following maximal exercise. These data show that, in older hypertensives, 1) acute maximal dynamic exercise had no impact on arterial stiffness of the carotid and <b>brachial</b> <b>arteries,</b> and 2) 20 weeks of moderate intensity aerobic exercise training failed to modify arterial stiffness...|$|R
