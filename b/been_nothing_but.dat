25|$|Unmentioned in the Domesday Book, Oldham {{during the}} Middle Ages (from {{the time of}} its {{founding}} in the 9th century through to the Industrial Revolution) is believed to have <b>been</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> a mere scattering of small and insignificant settlements spread across the moorland and dirt tracks which linked Manchester to York. However Oldham does appear in legal documents from this time, invariably recorded as territory under minor ruling families and barons. In the 13th century, Oldham was documented as a manor held from The Crown by a family surnamed Oldham, whose seat was at Werneth Hall. It was this family which produced one of the greatest benefactors to education for the nation; Hugh Oldham.|$|E

Club named Fringe the 15th best show of 2010, {{stated that}} the episode [...] "Peter" [...] gave [...] "the series' {{overarching}} storyline a devastating emotional core", making the series a [...] "rare blend of inventive ideas, wild ambition, and unexpected soulfulness". IGN named Fringe the 18th best science fiction show of all time in a 2011 listing, stating that {{since the middle of}} the first season, [...] "it's <b>been</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> a series of satisfyingly jaw-dropping 'holy eff!' moments layered with wonderful, nuanced performances from Anna Torv, Joshua Jackson and John Noble".|$|E

500|$|In January 2010, Sevigny won a Golden Globe {{award for}} Best Supporting Actress– Series, Miniseries or Television Film for her {{performance}} in the third season of Big Love. The series itself also received nominations in two other categories. During a press conference following the award win, Sevigny addressed the repressed women living in the fundamentalist Mormon compounds: [...] "These women are kept extremely repressed. They should be helped. They don't even know who {{the president of the}} United States is." [...] In addition, she had various screening credits that year: Sevigny landed major roles in two independent comedy films: Barry Munday and Mr. Nice in Munday, Sevigny plays the sister of a homely woman who is expecting a child by a recently castrated womanizer (opposite Patrick Wilson and Judy Greer); in Mr. Nice, she had a leading role as British marijuana-trafficker Howard Marks' wife, alongside Rhys Ifans; the film was based on Marks' autobiography of the same name. In a later interview with The A.V. Club, Sevigny was asked if she felt that the show's message was that polygamy was [...] "wrong". In response, Sevigny stated: [...] "No, absolutely not. I think there are more parallels to gay rights and alternative lifestyles within Big Love—more so than 'Polygamy is wrong'. I think they actually condone people who decide to live this lifestyle outside of fundamentalist sects." [...] During the same interview, Sevigny stated her disappointment with the series' fourth season, calling it [...] "awful" [...] and [...] "very telenovela"—though she stated that she loves her character and the writing, she felt the show [...] "got away from itself". Sevigny later regretted making the statements, saying she was very [...] "exhausted" [...] and [...] "wasn't thinking about what [...] was saying"; she also apologized to the show's producers. [...] " [...] that I was biting the hand that feeds me, because I obviously love the show and have always <b>been</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> positive about it. And I didn't want anybody to misunderstand me or think that I wasn't, you know, appreciative." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mel's exit storyline {{was linked}} to Steve's death, and Outhwaite claimed that viewers would be gripped by the storyline right up until her own exit {{a few months after}} Steve's. She commented, [...] "Mel is devastated by Steve's death. She thinks that Phil caused it and rushes into the Vic and goes for him. Mel acts brave, but inside she is breaking. She is given a {{necklace}} of black pearls on the day Steve dies and it breaks her heart. She knows Phil was involved in the death but can't prove it. He has <b>been</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> trouble for her and she won't try to build bridges now [...] Mel looks brave on the outside but inside she's cracking up." [...] In the on-screen events, Mel's anger turns to devastation when Phil informs her that Steve had been having sex with his sister Sam Mitchell. After being arrested over Steve's money laundering and discovering she was pregnant with Steve's baby, Mel confronted everyone who had wronged her before leaving Walford. At the time, Outhwaite stated that her final scenes were the hardest that she'd ever filmed. Tony Stewart, critic for The Mirror suggested that Mel's exit in April 2002 was thrilling and described it as [...] "a devastating story of betrayal and her ultimate revenge [...] one by one her friends desert her." [...] Stewart praised Mel's final scene with the following description: [...] "When she faces her last exit at Victoria Coach Station, there is a glint in her eye as Mel looks at the destination board and speaks on her mobile. 'Pick a number for me,' she says. 'One to 20. Great. Thank you.' And with that she is gone... but never forgotten." ...|$|E
