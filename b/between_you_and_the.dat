Just a direct {{connection}} <b>between</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> contact patch. The responses to steering, throttle, brake, and gearshift inputs are so nearly instantaneous that they verge on the telepathic.

On 17 May 2010, West Ham and Newham London Borough Council {{submitted}} a formal plan to the Olympic Park Legacy Company {{for the use of}} the Olympic Stadium following the 2012 Summer Olympics. The proposal was for a stadium with a capacity of 60,000 which would retain a competition athletics track. The proposal was welcomed by the chairman of UK athletics, Ed Warner, who said, [...] "I think it will feel great as a football stadium and I speak as a football fan as well the chairman of UK Athletics. I think you'd find West Ham would cover the track in the winter season so it wouldn't look like you had a track <b>between</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> pitch." ...|$|E

[...] Kate Claxton echoed J. B. Studley's line, and stage manager J. W. Thorpe appeared, also urging an orderly exit. But the audience was now thoroughly panicked and ignored the people on the stage.|$|E

But brother wolf, I {{would like to make}} peace <b>between</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> people." [...] Then Francis led the wolf into the town, and {{surrounded}} by startled citizens made a pact between them and the wolf. Because the wolf had “done evil out of hunger, the townsfolk were to feed the wolf regularly. In return, the wolf would no longer prey upon them or their flocks. In this manner Gubbio was freed from the menace of the predator. Francis even made a pact on behalf of the town dogs, that they would not bother the wolf again. Finally, to show the townspeople {{that they would not be}} harmed, Francis blessed the wolf.|$|E
2500|$|The album's vocal {{production}} received prominent recognition. Jackson's layered [...] "breathy harmonies", {{built upon}} [...] "little countermelodies" [...] and overdubbed [...] "nonverbal asides," [...] were considered an inventive technique; providing a [...] "plush romance." [...] Jackson's approach to [...] "shrouded" [...] harmonies were also thought to produce intimacy and comfort; which [...] "makes even a relatively raw number like [...] "Sexhibition" [...] {{feel like a}} private moment <b>between</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> owner of history's most downloaded breast." [...] LA Weekly called Jackson's multilayered vocals her [...] "calling card and primary weapon", backed by the album's lyrics as metaphorical [...] "bullets." [...] Robert Christgau regarded the [...] "synth-dance" [...] productions enhanced by [...] "sensual background murmurs." [...] Its vocals were described as [...] "lovely" [...] and [...] "quite graceful", containing an [...] "unassuming flutter and grit"; ultimately displaying a progression, saying [...] "Jackson has grown into her voice {{along with the rest}} of her body." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{right to}} choice is {{probably}} an individual right only, {{as opposed to}} also being a family right or a union right, however the rights are <b>between</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> government and not between you {{and a member of}} your family. [...] In the 1995 Supreme Court case B. (R.) v. Children’s Aid Society, in which two parents attempted to block a certain treatment for their child on religious grounds, it was argued that the personal choice aspect of liberty guaranteed family privacy. [...] This argument drew from United States case law, but the Supreme Court of Canada pointed out section 7 of the Charter contains individual rights, and hence there cannot be family rights. [...] Still, mindful that there was still choices involved in the family situation, the Supreme Court split on whether liberty rights were infringed. [...] Likewise, in I.L.W.U. v. The Queen (1992), the Supreme Court stressed the individual nature of section 7 to deny unions had a right to strike as part of the members' liberty. [...] The Court also stressed that strikes were socioeconomic matters that did not involve the justice system, and section 7 was concentrated on the justice system.|$|E
2500|$|However, legends {{surrounding}} Saint Francis of Assisi {{show him}} befriending a wolf. According to the Fioretti, {{the city of}} Gubbio was besieged by the Wolf of Gubbio, which devoured both livestock and men. Francis of Assisi, who was living in Gubbio at the time took pity on the townsfolk, and went up into the hills to find the wolf. Soon fear of the animal had caused all his companions to flee, but the saint pressed on and when he found the wolf he {{made the sign of}} the cross and commanded the wolf to come to him and hurt no one. Miraculously the wolf closed his jaws and lay down at the feet of St. Francis. [...] "Brother Wolf, you do much harm in these parts and you have done great evil ..." [...] said Francis. [...] "All these people accuse you and curse you… But brother wolf, I would like to make peace <b>between</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> people."

In this manner Gubbio was freed from the menace of the predator. Francis, ever the lover of animals, even made a pact on behalf of the town dogs, that they would not bother the wolf again.|$|E
