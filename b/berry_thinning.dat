For <b>berry</b> <b>thinning,</b> an end effector consists of an upper, middle, and lower part. The upper part has two plates and a rubber that can open and close. The two plates compress the grapes to cut off the rachis branches and extract the bunch of grapes. The middle part contains a plate of needles, a compression spring, and another plate which has holes spread across its surface. When the two plates compress, the needles punch holes through the grapes. Next, the lower part has a cutting device which can cut the bunch to standardize its length.|$|E

Consiste na remoção de 60 a 70 % das bagas de cada cacho para que as remanescentes se desenvolvam em tamanho e com qualidade. Em videiras Italia e seus mutantes, esse trabalho é realizado passando-se uma escova plástica ao longo da inflorescência e a disponibilidade de mão-de-obra treinada é {{fundamental}} para sua perfeita execução. A despenca consiste na remoção de partes dos cachos (ráquis), é um método de raleio simples e rápido. O objetivo deste trabalho foi comparar métodos e fases fenológicas para realizar o raleio de bagas da uva fina de mesa Black Star, nova mutação da cultivar Brasil, no município de Marialva, PR. As videiras foram conduzidas em latada, no espaçamento de 3, 0 x 4, 0 m, e o experimento foi conduzido em duas safras regulares (2012 e 2013). O delineamento experimental foi blocos casualizados, com cinco repetições e cinco tratamentos: testemunha (sem raleio); raleio com escova plástica realizado cinco dias antes do florescimento; despenca quando as bagas apresentavam 3 - 6 mm de diâmetro; despenca 7 - 10 mm de diâmetro; e despenca 11 - 15 mm de diâmetro. Foram avaliadas as seguintes variáveis: massa (g), comprimento (mm), diâmetro (mm), esfericidade e cor das bagas; teor de sólidos solúveis (SST), acidez titulável (AT) e índice de maturação (SST/AT) do mosto; massa (g), comprimento (cm) e largura (cm) dos cachos; produção por planta (kg/planta) e a produtividade (t ha- 1). Os dados foram submetidos à análise de variância e as médias comparadas pelo teste de Tukey a 5 %. Conclui-se que o raleio de bagas é uma prática obrigatória na uva Black Star para se obter frutas de qualidade. A operação deve ser realizada com a escova plástica na pré-floração. Na impossibilidade de executar ou finalizar esse tratamento, pode-se empregar a despenca de bagas do estádio fenológico de 3 - 6 mm até 11 - 15 mm de diâmetro, mas esta pratica reduz a produtividade. The thinning {{is one of}} {{the operations}} with higher requirement of manpower in the production of table grapes. This activity removes 60 - 70 % of the berries from each cluster, so that the remaining fruits grow in size and quality. In grapevine 'Italia' and its mutants, the thinning is done by passing a plastic brush along the inflorescence and the availability of skilled manpower trained is crucial for its perfect execution. The 'despenca' involves removing parts of clusters (rachis) is a simple and fast method of thinning. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the methods and timing to perform the <b>berry</b> <b>thinning</b> on new table grape 'Black Star' in the city of Marialva, PR. The vines were trained in an overhead trellis system, spaced at of 3, 0 x 4, 0 m, and the trial were carried out in two regular seasons (2012 and 2013). A randomized block design was used as a statistical model with five replications and five treatments: control; inflorescence thinning by plastic brush at five days before flowering; thinning when berries had 3 - 6 mm in diameter; thinning when berries had 7 - 10 mm in diameter; and thinning when berries had 11 - 15 mm in diameter. The following variables were evaluated: mass (g), length (mm) diameter (mm), sphericity and color of berries, total soluble solids (SST), titratable acidity (AT) and maturation index (SST/AT) of must, mass (g), length (cm) and width (cm) of clusters; yield (kg/plant) and yield (t ha- 1).

40|$|Bunch rot {{caused by}} mildews {{may lead to}} severe losses at harvest {{especially}} in the case of rainy seasons. For this reason, practices have been implemented to achieve <b>berry</b> <b>thinning</b> which allows to obtain aerated clusters also in cultivars with dense bunches that retain strongly humidity. The most common practice consists of treatments with gibberellins (GAs) at the moment of flowering (anthesis), which results in a reduction of fruit set, and consequently produces looser bunches. GA treatments however have very different effects on different grapevine cultivars: the reduction of fruit set remains limited in the family of Pinot, where it is compensated by harvesting of healthier grapes, but results to be dramatic in other cultivars such as Sauvignon Blanc, with excessive yield’s loss and effects persisting even in the years successive to the treatment. Gibberellins (GAs) are plant hormones that regulate growth and influence various developmental processes, including germination, dormancy, stem elongation, flowering and fruit set. All known gibberellins are synthesized by the terpenoid pathway and then modified by several GA oxidases until they reach their biologically-active form. The two main active GAs synthesized in plants are GA 1 and GA 4, although it is yet not clear which form is mainly regulating developmental processes in grapevine inflorescences. Active GAs are eventually deactivated by modifications into inactive gibberellin forms. The pool of active gibberellins is maintained both by regulation of their biosynthetic pathway involving GA 13, GA 20 and GA 3 oxidases, and their modifications through GA 2 oxidases. Active gibberellins in plants are sensed by GID proteins (Gibberellin-insensitive-Dwarf), and the GA response is regulated mainly through a family of repressors of gene expression: the DELLA proteins. In the presence of the GA signal, GID interacts with DELLA proteins and direct them to proteolysis. This work aims to characterize the molecular response to GAs of Vitis vinifera inflorescences from the cultivars Pinot Gris and Sauvignon Blanc, which show very different fruit set reduction in response to GA treatment. We set up a analytical method to determine endogenous concentrations of several gibberellin species in grapevine inflorescences of the two cultivars, which allows us to detect up to nine different GAs starting from a methanolic extract separated by reverse phase UPLC chromatography coupled with a mass spectrometer. In addition, this works aims to characterize the family of grapevine GA oxidases in terms of gene structure, gene expression and activity, and to determine whether their expression levels are different in the two cultivars following treatment with GA 3. Here, the most up-dated results of these investigations will be presented...|$|E

Today, well-known natural growth and growth regulators are examined in 5 groups; these are Auxins, Cytokinins, Gibberellins, Abscisic acid (Dormins) and Ethylene. Gibberellic acid is especially used in viticulture. It affects grape berry by means of different ways. Some of these effects include formation of flower cluster, berry set, berry enlargement, cluster lenghts elongation, <b>berry</b> <b>thin</b> in cluster, prevention of berry cracking, pollinicide effect of Gibberellic acid in seeded grape varieties to create seedlessness, etc. Besides, it was also found that it has effects on rooting, but this effect was not found beneficial.

Bird pepper is also widely cultivated and escaped in the tropical and subtropical Eastern Hemisphere (Bailey 1941). It is the wild ancestor of the pimento, the bell pepper, {{and some of the}} hot peppers (Bailey 1941). The domestication of these pepper varieties from bird pepper is reported to have taken place in Mexico or Central America (Hawkens 1991). General Description. —Bird pepper is also known as red pepper, wild pepper, wild chili, pimiento, and ají de gallina (Liogier 1995). The current growth is herbaceous, but it later hardens and becomes woody. The wood is brittle. Older plants are multistemmed and very branchy, with a thick, leafy crown. The leaves are dark green, ovate to lanciolate, 4 to 15 cm long, with petioles 0. 5 to 3 cm long. The twigs are stiff and straight between nodes. The flowers are mostly solitary or in pairs. The corolla is greenish-white or yellowish-white, 1 to 2 cm broad, with blue, violate, or yellow anthers. The fruits, which are ellipsoidal <b>berries</b> with <b>thin</b> flesh, are 0. 4 to 3 cm long (usually about 0. 8 cm in wild plants) and red or orange-red.

40|$|A ‘Niagara Rosada’ tem se apresentado como alternativa para a produção de uvas na região Noroeste do Estado de São Paulo, devido ao menor custo com mão-de-obra, não necessitando de raleio de bagas, menor suscetibilidade às doenças fúngicas, boa aceitação no mercado interno e aos bons rendimentos obtidos em condições irrigadas, com possibilidade de produção de frutos no período da entressafra das regiões tradicionais produtoras. Entretanto, devido às condições edafoclimaticas, os cachos e bagas da ‘Niagara Rosada’ são relativamente pequenos, o que torna desfavorável à comercialização. Com isso, para melhorar a qualidade dos frutos, a utilização de reguladores vegetais, pode auxiliar na melhoria das características morfológicas dos cachos e bagas. Dentre os reguladores, a aplicação das giberelinas tem sido usada em vinhedos visando melhorar suas características, obtendo-se com seu emprego bagas maiores e, {{conforme}} a variedade, mais alongadas. Outro regulador utilizado é o thidiazuron (TDZ) cujos estudos mostraram resultados promissores, como a melhoria das características dos cachos e bagas de uvas. Em função disso, o objetivo do trabalho foi avaliar o efeito de concentrações de ácido giberélico (AG 3) e thidiazuron (TDZ) nos cachos e bagas da cv. Niagara Rosada. O trabalho foi desenvolvido no período de agosto a dezembro de 2007, em um vinhedo experimental localizado na Fazenda de Ensino, Pesquisa e Extensão da UNESP – Campus de Ilha Solteira, localizada em Selvíria – MS. Utilizou-se o delineamento experimental inteiramente casualizado em esquema fatorial 4 x 4, correspondendo a 4 concentrações de AG 3 (0, 50, 100 e 150 mg. L- 1) e 4 concentrações de TDZ (0, 5, 10 e 15 mg. L- 1). Os tratamentos foram avaliados aos 15 dias após o pleno florescimento, mediante imersão dos cachos. Foram avaliadas as seguintes variáveis [...] . 'Niagara Rosada' {{has been}} presented as an alternative {{for the production of}} grapes in the northwest region of São Paulo State, due to the lower cost of labor, without the need for <b>berries</b> <b>thinning,</b> less susceptibility to fungal diseases, good acceptance in the domestic market and good results obtained in irrigated conditions, with the possibility of production of fruits during the season of the traditional producing regions. However, because soil and climatic conditions, bunches and berries of 'Niagara Rosada' are relatively small, which makes the trading less attractive. Therefore, to improve fruit quality, the use of plant regulators, may help to improve the morphological characteristics of clusters and berries. Among the regulators, the application of gibberellins has been used in vineyards with the objective to improve its characteristics. The application of the Gibberelinns acid results in larger berries and depending of the variety provide more elongated fruits. Another regulator used is the Thidiazuron (TDZ) whose studies showed promising results, such as improving the characteristics of the grapes’ clusters and berries. Therefore the objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of concentrations of gibberellic (GA 3) and thidiazuron (TDZ) acid in clusters and berries of cv. Niagara Rosada.
