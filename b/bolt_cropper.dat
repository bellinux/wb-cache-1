50|$|A bolt cutter, {{sometimes}} called <b>bolt</b> <b>cropper,</b> {{is a tool}} used for cutting chains, padlocks, bolts and wire mesh. The original use for bolt cutters was, as the name suggests, to cut bolt seals from shipping containers at the delivery point. It typically has long handles and short blades, with compound hinges to maximize leverage and cutting force. A typical bolt cutter yields 20 kN of cutting force for a 250 N force on the handles.|$|E
