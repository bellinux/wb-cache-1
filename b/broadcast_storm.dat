50|$|In {{a mobile}} ad hoc network (MANET), route request (RREQ) packets are usually {{broadcast}} to discover new routes.These RREQ packets may cause broadcast storms and compete over the channel with data packets.One approach {{to alleviate the}} <b>broadcast</b> <b>storm</b> problem is to inhibit some hosts from rebroadcasting to reduce the redundancy, and thus contention and collision.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Broadcast</b> <b>storm</b> {{control is}} a feature of many managed {{switches}} in which the switch intentionally ceases to forward all broadcast traffic if the bandwidth consumed by incoming broadcast frames exceeds a designated threshold. Although this does not resolve the root broadcast radiation problem, it limits broadcast radiation intensity and thus allows a network manager to communicate with network equipment to diagnose and resolve the root problem.|$|E
30|$|These {{modifications}} {{allow to}} reduce the number of network-wide PREQ messages initiated by the source node, when both the source and destination nodes belong to the same cluster.

40|$|One of the {{fundamental}} data transmission mechanisms in Ethernet LAN is broadcasting. Flooding is a direct broadcasting technique used in these networks. A significant drawback of this method {{is that it can}} lead to <b>broadcast</b> <b>storms.</b> This phenomenon is more common in multivendor switch environment. <b>Broadcast</b> <b>storms</b> usually results in dissension, collision and redundancy leading to degradation of the network performance. Most of the storms appear without much warning and it affects the efficiency of network even in situations when the network is expected to work most efficiently. There are several characteristic patterns by which storm can appear in a LAN, like rate monotonic repetition, transient appearances with different types of growth properties and decay profiles. In this paper we discuss the storm build up pattern in an industry and present various reasons for storm in LAN. We have identified a strategy for controlling network storms, using multiple static agents. These agents inhibit storm packet regeneration in the network using the knowledge of storm growth pattern. A model developed out of empirical studies is used to differentiate normal packet growth from storm packet growth and used in control mechanism of storms.

50|$|In some cases, a <b>broadcast</b> <b>storm</b> can be instigated for {{the purpose}} of a denial of service (DOS) using one of the packet {{amplification}} attacks, such as the smurf attack or fraggle attack, where smurf sends a large amount of ICMP Echo Requests (ping) traffic to a broadcast address, with each ICMP Echo packet containing the spoof source address of the victim host. When the spoofed packet arrives at the destination network, all hosts on the network reply to the spoofed address. The initial Echo Request is multiplied by the number of hosts on the network. This generates a storm of replies to the victim host tying up network bandwidth, using up CPU resources or possibly crashing the victim.|$|E

30|$|In advance, the {{prevention}} of <b>broadcast</b> <b>storm</b> {{is an important issue}} of data exchange. Previous studies proposed different methods to overcome such problem. For example, Saito et al. proposed a method to solve the problem by adjusting the broadcast interval according to the number of receive errors [4]. When the number of receive errors increases, it means a <b>broadcast</b> <b>storm</b> is being formed. Therefore, the broadcast interval is increased to prevent the occurrence of the <b>broadcast</b> <b>storm.</b> Bana and Varaiya proposed an alternative way, called Space Division Multiple Access (SDMA) for overcoming the problem of <b>broadcast</b> <b>storm</b> [7]. SDMA divides geographical space into smaller spaces. Vehicles locate their space according to the position information in order to use the network bandwidth in turns. However, SDMA relies on a high clock accuracy among vehicles (within 100 nanosecond) that is difficult to achieve in practical environment.|$|E
40|$|Broadcasting in ad hoc {{networks}} {{is required}} for many routing and other network-layer protocols to request information like routes or locations about destination nodes. Most of these routing protocols use a simple flooding mechanism that can cause <b>broadcast</b> <b>storms,</b> particularly in high density environments. Although many techniques have been proposed {{to address the problem}} of <b>broadcast</b> <b>storms,</b> they require additional periodic location beacons or do not satisfactorily reduce transmission redundancy in high density environments. We propose Cell Broadcast, a broadcast protocol that significantly reduces redundancy without the use of beaconing and while maintaining complete reachability in a high density environment. The proposed technique divides a terrain into cells. These cells help a node to determine its geographic relationship with a broadcasting node. This geographic relationship can eliminate rebroadcasts not only from nodes close to a broadcasting node but also from a majority of nodes near the transmission edge of the broadcasting node. The effect is that, in a high density environment, only a few nodes located near the 4 diagonal corners of a transmission range need to rebroadcast to maintain 100 % reachability. To the best of our knowledge, this technique is not present in any existing techniques that do not use location beaconing...|$|R

The security issues of the delay propagation achieved authentication and non-replication. The propagation delay mechanism avoids problems of communication collision and <b>broadcast</b> <b>storms,</b> but increases the propagation delay.

The delay time (seconds) is acceptable, since to deal with traffic-related events such as a car accident needs a lot of time (minutes or hours).|$|R
30|$|To date, {{there are}} many {{approaches}} to address the MLBS problem in multi-hop wireless networks. The simplest by far is flooding [16], where each node simply re-transmits a received message to its neighbors unscrupulously. However, this causes <b>broadcast</b> <b>storms</b> [17] and is thus very costly and causes long latencies. Consequently, a number of researchers, e.g., [18 - 20], have proposed methods that improve the efficiency of broadcast. In this paper, we address {{a variant of the}} MLBS problem, which aims to find an efficient, interference-free schedule that yields the minimum broadcast latency.|$|R

40|$|Information {{dissemination}} (flooding) {{forms an}} integral part of routing protocols, network management, service discovery and information collection (sensing). Given the broadcast nature of ad hoc network communications, information dissemination provides a challenging problem. Blind flooding in ad hoc networks results in the <b>broadcast</b> <b>storm</b> problem. To limit the <b>broadcast</b> <b>storm</b> problem, mechanisms for optimised flooding have been proposed. However, this optimisation reduces the inherent level of redundancy. the minimum spanning tree (MST) algorithm using local one hop topology in a distributed manner as the basis of a more reliable optimised flooding mechanism called, reliable minimum spanning tree (RMST) flood is proposed. RMST utilises unique properties of MST graphs that allow for broadcast transmissions to be replaced by unicast transmissions. Unicast transmission is inherently more reliable than broadcast transmission as it utilises link layer acknowledgement and retransmission, thereby improving the reliability of a flood and reducing the <b>broadcast</b> <b>storm</b> problem. Simulation is used to show that RMST is able to achieve equivalent reliability in terms of packet delivery compared to blind flooding. Importantly, RMST is able to achieve significantly better performance than MPR and equivalent performance to LMSTFlood in terms of reducing the <b>broadcast</b> <b>storm</b> problem...|$|E

When designing an efficient and reliable broadcast protocol for VANETs, the <b>broadcast</b> <b>storm</b> problem must be considered.

The weighted p-persistence scheme assigns a higher probability to vehicles that are located farther away from the broadcaster and the slotted p-persistence scheme divides the transmission range into a pre-determined number of slots and assigns the pre-determined probability at each slot. However, these schemes have some problems. In a dense network, multiple vehicles may rebroadcast the message simultaneously, resulting in collisions. Also, in a sparse network, the waiting time can cause a long delay before the message is rebroadcasted. These mean that the performance of existing broadcast schemes is highly dependent on the vehicle density and distribution.|$|E
