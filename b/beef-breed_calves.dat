40|$|A herd of 277 <b>beef-breed</b> <b>calves</b> {{in three}} age groups was mis-takenly given the poultry {{coccidiostat}} maduramicin {{in a total}} mixed ration. It caused an acute toxicosis in which sudden death was the sole clinical finding in most cases. One group of 212 calves aged five to eight months suffered a mortality of 51 per cent in eight days and a total mortality of 56 per cent dur-ing the 40 days in which mortality was recorded. Mortality of only 3 per cent was recorded in two other groups of calves aged nine to 16 months in eight days and a total mortality of 11 per cent over the 40 -day period. MADURAMICIN (Cygro; Cyanamid) belongs {{to the group of}} poly-ether ionophores which are used in farm animals as both coccid-iostats and growth promotants. In cattle, monensin and lasalocid are approved for use as growth promotants and have been incorporated into cattle feedstuffs on a large scale for many years. These iono-phores have been the cause of many toxicoses in growing cattle (Wardrope and others 1983, Schweitzer and others 1984, Blanchard and others 1993), usually involving acute toxicoses, but occasionally inducing chronic intoxications (Shlosberg and others 1986). Madu-ramicin is approved only as a coccidiostat in broiler chickens and turkeys, at a concentration of 5 g/tonne of feed. It was suspected (Perl and others 1991) and later shown to be the cause of chronic (Shlosberg and others 1992) or subacute (Fourie and others 1991) cardiomyopathy syndromes in cattle fed poultry litter from madu-ramicin-treated broilers. In cattle in Israel, the toxicoses were usually associated with feeding poultry litter containing residues of up to 12 ppm of maduramicin, or with the ingestion of large amounts of poul-try litter containing as little as 2 ppm. No other reports describing the deleterious effects of feeding cattle maduramicin under field condi-tions have been found. This paper describes an acute mass toxicosis in calves due to accidental contamination of feed with maduramicin. Materials and methods History of the her...|$|E
