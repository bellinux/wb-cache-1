5|$|The monarchy of <b>Barbados</b> has {{its roots}} in the English monarchy, under the {{authority}} of which the island was claimed in 1625 and first colonized in 1627, and later the British monarchy. By the 18th century, <b>Barbados</b> became one of the main seats of the British Crown's authority in the British West Indies, and then, after an attempt in 1958 at a federation with other West Indian colonies, continued as a self-governing colony until, on 30 November 1966, the country gained independence from the United Kingdom, retaining the then reigning monarch, Elizabeth II, as monarch of the newly formed monarchy of <b>Barbados.</b> The monarch is represented in the country by the Governor-General of <b>Barbados,</b> Sir Elliott Belgrave.|$|E
5|$|The {{music of}} <b>Barbados</b> {{includes}} distinctive national styles of folk and popular music, including elements of Western classical and religious music. The culture of <b>Barbados</b> is a syncretic mix of African and British elements, and the island's music reflects this mix through song types and styles, instrumentation, dances, and aesthetic principles.|$|E
5|$|As {{defending}} champions, Trinidad again {{qualified for}} {{the final of the}} Inter-Colonial Tournament in January 1927 and faced <b>Barbados,</b> the home team on this occasion. In a high-scoring match which lasted for eight days, <b>Barbados</b> recovered from being 384 runs behind after the first innings. St Hill contributed a first innings duck and a score of 18 in the second innings, batting down the order. Later in the year, St Hill took part in the trial matches for the 1928 tour of England. Playing for British Guiana and Trinidad against <b>Barbados</b> and Jamaica, he scored 144, the highest innings of his career. St Hill was particularly severe on the bowling of George Francis, a bowler who had represented West Indies. In the other matches, scores of 45, 44 and 71, secured his place in the touring team.|$|E
5|$|Barbadian folk traditions {{include the}} Landship movement, {{which is a}} satirical, {{informal}} organization based on the British navy, tea meetings, tuk bands and numerous traditional songs and dances. In modern <b>Barbados,</b> popular styles include calypso, spouge, contemporary folk and world music. <b>Barbados</b> is, along with Guadeloupe, Martinique, Trinidad, Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands, {{one of the few}} centers for Caribbean jazz.|$|E
5|$|<b>Barbados</b> is the easternmost of {{the islands}} located within the Caribbean Sea. Home to 280,000 residents, <b>Barbados</b> was first settled by the British in the 1620s. The nation {{remained}} a British colony until it declared total independence from the United Kingdom in 1966. The first appearance of a uniquely Barbadian delegation at the Olympic games came two years after it declared independence. At its debut, nine male athletes arrived to participate at the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City. Previously, <b>Barbados</b> (as a British colony) constituted {{a major part of}} the West Indies Federation along with Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago, which sent a delegation to participate at the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome.|$|E
5|$|By the 19th century, the Barbadian colonialists grew to fear slave revolts, and specifically, the use {{of music}} {{as a tool of}} {{communication}} and planning for revolution. As a result, the government passed laws to restrict musical activities among slaves. At the same time, American and other forms of imported music were brought to <b>Barbados,</b> while many important elements of modern Barbadian music, like tuk bands, also emerged. In the 20th century, many new styles were imported to <b>Barbados,</b> most influentially including jazz, ska, reggae, calypso and soca. <b>Barbados</b> became home to many performers of these new genres, especially soca and calypso, while the island also produced an indigenous style called spouge, which became an important symbol of Barbadian identity.|$|E
5|$|National Heroes Square in Bridgetown, <b>Barbados,</b> {{was named}} Trafalgar Square in 1813, before its better-known British namesake. It was renamed in 1999 to commemorate {{national}} heroes of <b>Barbados.</b> There {{is a life}} scale replica of the square in Bahria Town, Lahore, Pakistan where it is a tourist attraction and centre for local residents.|$|E
5|$|Small did {{not play}} more {{first-class}} cricket until after the First World War, but during the war he played in Egypt alongside future West Indian captain Karl Nunes. When he resumed his Trinidad career in 1920, he played in two games against <b>Barbados.</b> In the first, he scored 33 and 62, his first score over fifty in first-class cricket. In the second, he scored 102 not out, his maiden century. He also took three wickets in total in the games, {{both of which were}} won by <b>Barbados.</b> In 1921, the Inter-Colonial Tournament resumed, but despite playing both games, Small had little success. During the 1922 tournament, Small scored 33 and 82 against British Guiana and took three for 46 Guiana's first innings. Having beaten Guiana, Trinidad lost to <b>Barbados</b> once more in the final in which Small scored 36 and 5, but took only two wickets in 35 overs.|$|E
5|$|Small {{made his}} {{first-class}} debut for Trinidad on 11 November 1909, playing against a team chosen by WC Shepherd. Small scored 13 and 0 in the match and bowled two over {{without taking a}} wicket. The following January, Small made his first appearance for Trinidad in the Inter-Colonial Tournament; he scored seven runs in his only innings and took four for 16 in British Guiana's first innings. In the final against <b>Barbados,</b> he took one wicket {{in the game and}} scored 17 and 8 in his two innings. Trinidad won the match. Later that year, Small played against <b>Barbados</b> again, in the final of the next Inter-Colonial Tournament, but had little success in that match, nor in the 1912 tournament when his best score in two games was 15 runs, and he took a total of three wickets. In both instances, <b>Barbados</b> won the tournament.|$|E
5|$|The oryzomyines of the Caribbean were revised in 1962 by Clayton Ray, who {{examined}} the specimens Gregory had found and redescribed them. He suggested that M.audreyae {{may in fact}} have come from <b>Barbados</b> instead of similarly named Barbuda, citing the occurrence of a different oryzomyine ("Ekbletomys hypenemus") in other cave deposits on Barbuda, circumstantial evidence for the occurrence of a native rodent on <b>Barbados,</b> uncertainty whether Gregory ever visited Barbuda, and biogeographical considerations.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Jerry {{formed as}} a {{tropical}} depression from a tropical wave on October 6 near <b>Barbados.</b> The storm intensified into a tropical storm early the following day on October 7 while initially located under an environment of weak vertical wind shear. After reaching its peak of 50mph (80km/h), Jerry passed just south of <b>Barbados</b> late on October 7 and through the Windward Islands on October 8. Deterioration in organization occurred, and Jerry dissipated while moving rapidly westward well south of Puerto Rico.|$|E
5|$|When cricket resumed in February 1920, St Hill was {{selected}} in two matches against <b>Barbados</b> as Trinidad travelled to <b>Barbados.</b> Trinidad were heavily defeated in both games. St Hill scored 18 and 41 {{in the first}} game opening the batting, and after scoring two runs at number four in the second game, reverted to opening and scored 96, sharing an opening partnership of 140 with C. P. Cumberbatch. The next tournament took place in Trinidad during September 1921, and St Hill scored 104 runs from number three—his maiden first-class century—as Trinidad defeated British Guiana. The final against <b>Barbados</b> was affected by rain and left drawn when <b>Barbados</b> had to catch the boat home; St Hill scored six runs, batting at number three, and 48 batting at number six. In the inter-colonial matches of September 1922, St Hill continued to bat in a variety of positions, batting at numbers three, five and six, as well as opening the batting. However, he scored just 49 runs in four innings. Although Trinidad reached the final, they were once more heavily defeated by Bardados.|$|E
5|$|While at <b>Barbados,</b> Rodney {{received}} news of Tobago, and on 29May dispatched Drake in Gibraltar {{with five}} other ships. Drake intercepted the French the following day, but being hopelessly out-numbered retired to <b>Barbados.</b> He arrived on 3June, and Rodney immediately put to sea {{with the entire}} fleet. The British reached Tobago the following day, only to learn it had surrendered two days previously.|$|E
5|$|A-10s of the 23rd TFW were {{deployed}} to Bridgetown, <b>Barbados</b> during Operation Urgent Fury, the American Invasion of Grenada. They provided air {{cover for the}} U.S. Marine Corps landings {{on the island of}} Carriacou in late October 1983, but did not fire weapons as Marines met no resistance.|$|E
5|$|After Janet passed <b>Barbados,</b> {{the island}} was {{declared}} a state of emergency. Relief workers on <b>Barbados</b> helped to clean up debris scattered by the strong winds on highways, and the local government made requests for food and construction materials. The extensive damaged caused by Janet on the island to low-income households led the passage of the 1955Housing Act, which created the National Housing Authority (NHA) in 1956. The NHA was responsible for the acquisition of lands on which houses could be built with stronger and more permanent materials, which was thought to minimize maintenance costs and hurricane-related damage. The newly founded organization quickly worked to rebuild homes after the hurricane struck.|$|E
5|$|At 5a.m.AST (0900UTC) August 16 the {{respective}} governments of St. Lucia and Dominica issued hurricane warnings {{in anticipation of}} Hurricane Dean's imminent approach. In Dominica, a dozen and a half tourists were evacuated to concrete shelters. The government of Dominica also canceled leave for emergency service personnel and evacuated Princess Margret Hospital, fearing that its roof might be vulnerable to the storm's winds. At {{the same time the}} Meteorological Service of <b>Barbados</b> issued a tropical storm warning for <b>Barbados</b> and a tropical storm watch for St. Vincent. Three hours later, at 8 a.m. AST (1200 UTC), the Meteorological Service of Antigua issued a tropical storm watch for Montserrat, Antigua, St. Kitts, Nevis and Barbuda. Shortly thereafter the Trinidad and Tobago Meteorological Service issued a tropical storm watch for Grenada and its dependencies.|$|E
5|$|BWI. Athletes from <b>Barbados,</b> Jamaica, and Trinidad and Tobago competed as the British West Indies (BWI) at the 1960 Games. The West Indies Federation only existed as {{a nation}} from 1958–1962, so the {{constituent}} nations once again competed independently in 1964.|$|E
5|$|<b>Barbados</b> sent a {{delegation}} {{to compete at}} the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China. The island nation made its tenth appearance as an independent nation upon its arrival in Beijing. Eight athletes across three sports and ten events represented <b>Barbados,</b> marking the smallest delegation in its history up to the Beijing Games. Its runners and swimmers advanced past the first rounds in their events in four of their nine events, although none advanced to their events' final rounds or medaled. The nation's flagbearer during the Beijing Games was swimmer Bradley Ally.|$|E
5|$|Between its 1968 debut and its {{appearance}} at the Beijing Olympics, Barbadian delegations appeared at every Summer Olympics except for the 1980 Summer Olympics, {{which took place in}} Moscow in the Soviet Union. With the exceptions of the 1968 and the 2008 Barbadian teams, every appearance by <b>Barbados</b> at the Olympics (as of Beijing) included at least ten athletes; its smallest delegation arrived in 2008, carrying only eight competitors. All the delegations except the one that arrived in 1968 have included female athletes. Prior to and including the 2008 Beijing Olympics, there had been one medalist from <b>Barbados.</b> Obadele Thompson won a bronze medal at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia, as part of Barbados' most successful showing at any Olympic games as of 2008.|$|E
5|$|Carter was {{transferred}} to Bahamas as Governor and Commander-in-Chief in 1898, and after a temporary transfer to Trinidad, in July 1904 he {{was transferred}} to the <b>Barbados</b> as Governor and Commander-in-Chief.|$|E
5|$|During the Inter-Colonial Tournament in October 1925, Fernandes made {{significant}} scores {{in each of}} British Guiana's matches: he scored 89 runs in the first innings of their match against <b>Barbados,</b> helping his side {{to open up a}} 144-run first innings lead, which they converted into an eight wicket victory. In the subsequent match against Trinidad, he reached 124, but lacked support from his teammates, three of whom fell just short of half-centuries. British Guiana eventually lost the match by two wickets. In the following February, the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) toured the West Indies, playing matches in <b>Barbados,</b> Trinidad, British Guiana and Jamaica. Three of the matches, one in each location excluding Jamaica, was against representative West Indies sides: Fernandes played in the match held in British Guiana, but not in either of the others, and also played in both matches between British Guiana and the touring MCC. In the last of these matches, he was selected as captain of the British Guiana side, and marked the occasion by scoring 120 in his team's only innings of a drawn match. He remained as captain for the colony's 1927 match against <b>Barbados,</b> in which their opponents scored 715/9 declared: the second highest innings score made against the team.|$|E
5|$|His next post was as Governor for the Lagos Colony {{where he}} {{negotiated}} treaties {{with the local}} chiefs which protected Christian missionaries and ending human sacrifies. He later served as the Governor for The Bahamas and <b>Barbados</b> and finally as the Governor for Trinidad and Tobago.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Abby {{bypassed}} <b>Barbados</b> {{a tropical}} depression, {{which resulted in}} minimal effects. Maximum sustained winds on <b>Barbados</b> were reported at 23mph (57km/h), while gusts were recorded up to 37mph (60km/h). There are no other effects known on <b>Barbados.</b> St. Lucia had borne {{the brunt of the}} storm when Hurricane Abby made landfall as a category 1 hurricane. Rainfall on the island totaled at 6.80in (172.7mm). Tropical storm force winds were recorded on the island for the passage of Hurricane Abby on July 10, though there were no hurricane force winds reported. In addition, a roof collapsed in on a house, killing six of the residents living there. The passage of Hurricane Abby also resulted in $435,000 (1960 USD, $ USD) of damage on St. Lucia. Martinique was near the path of Hurricane Abby, which resulted in some effects. The Martinique Aimé Césaire International Airport in Fort-de-France recorded rainfall at nearly three inches (76.2mm), while rain in another village was measured at nearly four inches (101.2mm). Winds on Martinique were also at least tropical storm force during the passage of Hurricane Abby. However, wind gusts on Martinique were around 75mph (120km/h), greater than that which was observed on St. Lucia. There were also damaged roads and bridges, mainly due to landslides. The island nation of Dominica was also affected by Hurricane Abby. Hurricane Abby produced nearly sixin (152.4mm) of rain on the island. Winds were also similar to those that were measured on <b>Barbados.</b> Hurricane Abby left about $65,000 (1960 USD, $ USD) in damage to Dominica.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Flora passed <b>Barbados</b> a {{few days}} after Hurricane Edith moved through the area. The two hurricanes {{resulted}} in about $65,000 in damage (1963USD), primarily to fishing interests.|$|E

5|$|In {{anticipation}} of Dean's significant damage, several emergency response groups gathered funds and readied personnel. On August 14 the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Response Agency (CDERA) placed its Regional Response Mechanism on standby and contacted the National Disaster Coordinators of {{all member states}} in the Lesser Antilles. On August 15 the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) dispatched teams to <b>Barbados,</b> Dominica, and St. Kitts {{in advance of the}} hurricane to provide damage assessment should the hurricane affect those islands. The Eastern Caribbean Donor Group convened a meeting on August 16 under the Chair of the Resident Representative United Nations Development Programme <b>Barbados</b> in anticipation that member states would require international assistance.|$|E
5|$|Jazz is a {{genre of}} music from the United States which reached <b>Barbados</b> {{by the end of}} the 1920s. The first major {{performer}} from the island was Lionel Gittens, who was followed by Percy Green, Maggie Goodridge and Clevie Gittens. These bandleaders played a variety of music, including swing, a kind of pop-jazz, Barbadian calypso and waltzes. With little recorded music on the island, radio broadcasts such as Willis Conover's Voice of America had a major influence. In 1937, riots over poverty and disenfranchisement occurred, and people like Clement Payne had risen to fame advocating reform. In that year, Payne was deported and riots broke out in Bridgetown, spreading throughout the island. The following year, the <b>Barbados</b> Labour Party was formed by C. A. Braithwaite and Grantley Adams.|$|E
