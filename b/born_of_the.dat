5|$|From {{the late}} 15th century, {{a number of}} {{painters}} emphasised landscape in their works, a development led {{in part by the}} shift in preference from religious iconography to secular subjects. Second-generation Netherlandish painters applied the mid-14th-century dictum of natural representation. This was <b>born</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rising affluence of the region's middle class, many of whom had now travelled south and seen countryside noticeably different from their flat homeland. At the same time, the later part of the century saw the emergence of specialisation and a number of masters focused on detailing landscape, most notably Konrad Witz in the mid-15th century, and later Joachim Patinir. Most innovations in this format came from artists living in the Dutch regions of the Burgundian lands, most notably from Haarlem, Leiden and 's-Hertogenbosch. The significant artists from these areas did not slavishly reproduce the scenery before them, but in subtle ways adapted and modified their landscapes to reinforce the emphasis and meaning of the panel they were working on.|$|E
5|$|Norodom Sihanouk was {{the only}} child <b>born</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> union between Norodom Suramarit and Sisowath Kossamak. His parents, who heeded the royal court astrologer's advice that he risked dying {{at a young age}} if he was raised under parental care, placed him under the care of Kossamak's grandmother, Pat. When Pat died, Kossamak brought Sihanouk to live with his {{paternal}} grandfather, Norodom Sutharot. Sutharot delegated parenting responsibilities to his daughter, Norodom Ket Kanyamom. Sihanouk received his primary education at the Francois Baudoin school and Nuon Moniram school in Phnom Penh. During this time, he received financial support from his maternal grandfather, Sisowath Monivong, to head an amateur performance troupe and soccer team. In 1936 Sihanouk was sent to Saigon, where he pursued his secondary education at Lycée Chasseloup Laubat, a boarding school.|$|E

25|$|For Merleau-Ponty, it {{is these}} uses {{of the notion of}} style that lead Malraux to {{postulate}} a cleavage between the objectivity of Italian Renaissance painting and the subjectivity of painting in his own time, a conclusion that Merleau-Ponty disputes. According to Merleau-Ponty, {{it is important to consider}} the heart of this problematic, by recognizing that style is first of all a demand owed to the primacy of perception, which also implies taking into consideration the dimensions of historicity and intersubjectivity. (However, Merleau-Ponty's reading of Malraux has been questioned in a recent major study of Malraux's theory of art which argues that Merleau-Ponty seriously misunderstood Malraux.) For Merleau-Ponty, style is <b>born</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> interaction between two or more fields of being. Rather than being exclusive to individual human consciousness, consciousness is <b>born</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pre-conscious style of the world, of Nature.|$|E
