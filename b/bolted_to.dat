5|$|A {{report was}} {{approved}} by Brampton City Council during a council meeting on August 16, 1993. The report suggested that in British Columbia, such sculptures are frequently displayed outdoors. As Chinguacousy Park bears an Aboriginal name, it was deemed appropriate for the sculpture to be used {{at the entrance of}} the nearby area. It was to be <b>bolted</b> <b>to</b> a 1.5-metre high (five-foot high) tree stump.|$|E
5|$|On September 10, 2015, Miyamoto {{confirmed}} a fan theory {{stating that}} the entirety of Super Mario Bros. 3 takes place as a stage play. The game opens with curtains being pulled, featuring obstacles hanging from the catwalk, objects <b>bolted</b> <b>to</b> the background, and shadows on the skyline. When Mario finishes a level, he walks off the stage.|$|E
5|$|The skins of the fuselage, {{wings and}} {{tailplane}} were secured by rivets, and in critical {{areas such as}} the wing forward of the main spar where an uninterrupted airflow was required, with flush rivets; the fuselage used standard dome-headed riveting. From February 1943 flush riveting was used on the fuselage, affecting all Spitfire variants. In some areas, such as {{at the rear of the}} wing, and the lower tailplane skins, the top was riveted and the bottom fixed by brass screws which tapped into strips of spruce <b>bolted</b> <b>to</b> the lower ribs. The removable wing tips were made up of duralumin-skinned spruce formers. At first the ailerons, elevators and rudder were fabric-covered. When combat experience showed that fabric-covered ailerons were impossible to use at high speeds, a light alloy replaced the fabric, enhancing control throughout the speed range.|$|E
50|$|When the {{solenoid valve}} is {{energized}} {{the air in}} front of the bolt vents, allowing the bias supplied {{to the rear of the}} <b>bolt</b> <b>to</b> move it forward. When the bolt has moved forward enough to seal the breech, the pin unseals from the powertube it rides in, and air is vented through the <b>bolt</b> <b>to</b> the ball, firing it. When the solenoid valve is de-energized, air is again supplied to the front of the <b>bolt</b> <b>to</b> return it.|$|R

5|$|Carbon fibre is {{actually}} a carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer, and is a strong, light-weight material used {{in a number of}} applications, including sporting goods like baseball bats, car parts, helmets, sailboats, bicycles and other equipment where rigidity and high strength-to-weight ratio is important. The polymer used for this equipment is normally epoxy, but other polymers are also used, depending on the application, and other reinforcing fibres may also be included. In the blade manufacturing process, sheets of impregnated material are cut into square sheets and pressed onto a form to produce the final shape. From 30 to 90 sheets may be layered, depending on the expected weight of the athlete, and the mold is then autoclaved to fuse the sheets into a solid plate. This method reduces air bubbles that can cause breaks. Once the result is cooled, it is cut into the shape of the blades. The finished blade is <b>bolted</b> <b>to</b> a carbon fibre socket that is an intimate fit to each of Pistorius' legs. These are custom made and make up the bulk of the total cost, along with the assessment and setting up of the finished prostheses. Each limb costs between $15–18,000 USD.|$|E
5|$|Each engine main {{combustion}} chamber (MCC) receives fuel-rich hot gas from a hot-gas manifold cooling circuit. The gaseous hydrogen and liquid oxygen enter the chamber at the injector, which mixes the propellants. A small augmented-spark igniter-chamber {{is located in}} the center of the injector, and this dual-redundant igniter is used during the engine start sequence to initiate combustion. The igniters are turned off after approximately three seconds because the combustion process is self-sustaining. The main injector and dome assembly are welded to the hot-gas manifold, and the MCC is also <b>bolted</b> <b>to</b> the hot-gas manifold. The MCC comprises a structural shell made of Inconel 718 which is lined with a copper-silver-zirconium alloy called NARloy-Z, developed specifically for the RS-25 in the 1970s. Around 390 channels are machined into the liner wall to carry liquid hydrogen through the liner to provide MCC cooling, as the temperature in the {{combustion chamber}} reaches 3300°C (6000°F) during flight – higher than the boiling point of iron.|$|E
5|$|As {{the tornado}} crossed South Richard Road, it {{intensified}} {{into a very}} high-end EF4 and inflicted catastrophic damage to several large homes as it impacted the Deer Creek subdivision. Well-built homes along South Richard Road and East Kuehl Court were leveled and swept from their foundations with debris strewn downwind. Several vehicles parked at these residences were moved some distance or tossed, and wind rowing of debris occurred. One house had its concrete walkway pulled {{a few inches from}} its original location, and notable scouring of lawn grass was observed in the subdivision. These structures were estimated to have been impacted by winds near 200mph (320km/h), the upper bound of an EF4 tornado. The homes swept away in this area were <b>bolted</b> <b>to</b> their foundations and there is some speculation that the tornado may have reached EF5 intensity at this point, though close inspection revealed that some of the washers were missing from the anchor bolts, and that low-lying shrubbery near the homes was left mostly intact, preventing a higher rating. Continuing northeast, the tornado temporarily weakened as it destroyed a few large barns or outbuildings, ripped the roof off two brick residences, and collapsed most walls of another house, but once again gained strength as it approached Illinois Route 64. A large restaurant and a residence had their exterior walls collapsed.|$|E

25|$|The engine {{mounting}} was substantially different. Instead of being suspended from an alloy cradle {{as on the}} Mark A and B, the engine now sat in a steel cradle <b>bolted</b> <b>to</b> a steeply inclined steel tube that pivoted directly behind the engine through an alloy steering head bracket. This bracket, holding the engine and front wheel unit is <b>bolted</b> <b>to</b> a cast alloy bulkhead which forms a major structural component of the car. The {{engine mounting}} {{was said to have}} been a regular source of failures on both the Mark A and the Mark B, and this new design was again the work of Granville Bradshaw.|$|E

25|$|Of this work, {{the major}} item was the {{modification}} of the wheels. The solution adopted by the National Railway Museum Workshop was to employ a metal fabricator to cut four rings from 40-mm-thick steel plate. These were cut with enough precision not to need any further machining. The rings were then <b>bolted</b> <b>to</b> the existing wheels and were a complete success.|$|E

Bolts being the method of {{securing}} the helmet to the diving suit. The helmet could also be secured to the breastplate (corselet) by bolts {{as in the case}} of US twelve-four helmets (12 <b>bolts</b> <b>to</b> the suit, four <b>bolts</b> seal helmet <b>to</b> corselet). The no bolt helmet used a spring-loaded clamp to secure the helmet to corselet over the suit. Swedish helmets were distinctive for using a neck ring instead of a corselet, a pioneer of modern diving equipment but hugely cumbersome and uncomfortable for the diver. This equipment is commonly referred to as [...] "heavy gear." ...|$|R

30|$|Manipulation of the {{electric}} field {{has been used to}} create interesting scaffold geometries (Wang et al. 2009). In this study, {{the electric}} field was manipulated by attaching two stainless steel <b>bolts</b> <b>to</b> the collection plate. Fibers aligned themselves between the two bolts and radially from the <b>bolts</b> <b>to</b> the collection plate. This method creates aligned nanofibers without the use of a rotating mandrel, which promotes an increase in scaffold porosity.|$|R
50|$|The MG 34 fires {{from an open}} <b>bolt</b> <b>to</b> prevent cook-offs {{when the}} weapon got hot after long, {{sustained}} fire and to improve the airflow through the barrel allowing it to cool faster. The firearm was designed with a rotating bolt operated by short recoil aided by a muzzle booster. When the firearm is ready <b>to</b> fire the <b>bolt</b> is pulled back to the rear and is held back by the sear. With {{the pull of the}} trigger the sear disengages sending the bolt forward under pressure from the recoil spring. A cartridge is stripped from the magazine or belt and the round is pushed into the chamber. As the bolt moves forward into battery the bolt rotates engaging the locking lugs and chamber locking the <b>bolt</b> <b>to</b> the barrel. The striker strikes and ignites the primer and the round is fired. The recoil causes the barrel and <b>bolt</b> <b>to</b> move backwards a short distance. The rearward movement of the barrel causes the rotating <b>bolt</b> <b>to</b> rotate back disengaging the locking lugs and unlocking the bolt from the barrel. The barrel returns to its forward position while the <b>bolt</b> recoils <b>to</b> its rear position. The empty casing is ejected and the cycle can begin anew.|$|R
