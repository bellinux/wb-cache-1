5|$|A {{brain tumor}} is an {{abnormal}} growth of cells within the brain or inside the skull, {{and can be}} cancerous (malignant) or non-cancerous (<b>benign).</b> Just over half of all primary brain tumors are malignant; the rest are <b>benign,</b> though they may still be life-threatening. In the United States in 2000, survivors of <b>benign</b> primary brain tumors outnumbered those who had cancerous primary brain tumors by approximately 4:1. Metastatic brain cancer is over six times more common than primary brain cancer, as it occurs in about 10–30% of all people with cancer.|$|E
5|$|Borates {{are used}} as {{environmentally}} <b>benign</b> wood preservatives.|$|E
5|$|Cervical polyps, {{which are}} <b>benign</b> {{overgrowth}}s of endocervical tissue, if present, may cause bleeding, or a <b>benign</b> overgrowth {{may be present}} in the cervical canal. Cervical ectropion refers to the horizontal overgrowth of the endocervical columnar lining in a one-cell-thick layer over the ectocervix.|$|E
5|$|In June 2011, {{he had a}} <b>benign</b> tumor {{from his}} {{brainstem}} surgically removed.|$|E
5|$|According {{to another}} legend, Chamunda {{appeared}} from the frown of the <b>benign</b> goddess Parvati to kill demons Chanda and Munda. Here, Chamunda {{is viewed as}} a form of Parvati.|$|E
5|$|Heart murmurs are {{abnormal}} heart sounds {{which can}} be either pathological or <b>benign.</b> One example of a murmur is Still's murmur, which presents a musical sound in children, has no symptoms and disappears in adolescence.|$|E
5|$|Other {{suggestions}} included ameloblastoma or a <b>benign</b> salivary {{mixed tumor}} (also {{known as a}} pleomorphic adenoma).|$|E
5|$|StrobilurinA {{has been}} {{isolated}} from the fruit bodies. Strobilurins have fungicidal activities and well known for their broad fungicidal spectrum, low toxicity against mammalian cells, and environmentally <b>benign</b> characteristics.|$|E
5|$|The vast {{majority}} of cases of hyperparathyroidism {{are the result of}} the random formation of <b>benign,</b> but metabolically active, parathyroid adenoma swellings. These instances comprise approximately 80–85% of all documented cases of hyperparathyroidism.|$|E
5|$|Adrenal {{tumors are}} {{commonly}} found as incidentalomas, unexpected asymptomatic tumors found during medical imaging. They {{are seen in}} around 3.4% of CT scans, {{and in most cases}} they are <b>benign</b> adenomas. Adrenal carcinomas are very rare, with an incidence of 1 case per million per year.|$|E
5|$|Aphthous {{stomatitis}} is {{a common}} condition characterized by the repeated formation of <b>benign</b> and non-contagious mouth ulcers (aphthae) in otherwise healthy individuals. The informal term canker sores is also used, mainly in North America, although this may also refer to any mouth ulcer.|$|E
5|$|BHD can be {{suggested}} by clinical findings but is definitively diagnosed by molecular genetic testing to detect mutations in the FLCN gene. The classical clinical triad includes <b>benign</b> growths of the hair follicles; pulmonary cysts and spontaneous pneumothorax; and bilateral, multifocal renal tumors.|$|E
5|$|Barium is not {{carcinogenic}} and it {{does not}} bioaccumulate. Inhaled dust containing insoluble barium compounds can accumulate in the lungs, causing a <b>benign</b> condition called baritosis. The insoluble sulfate is nontoxic and is not classified as a dangerous goods in transport regulations.|$|E
5|$|Esophageal strictures {{are usually}} <b>benign</b> and {{typically}} develop after {{a person has}} had reflux for many years. Other strictures may include esophageal webs (which can also be congenital) and damage to the esophagus by radiotherapy, corrosive ingestion, or eosinophilic esophagitis. A Schatzki ring is fibrosis at the gastro-esophageal junction. Strictures may also develop in chronic anemia, and Plummer-Vinson syndrome.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, Peggy {{featured}} in a storyline about breast cancer. It {{was the first time}} that the soap had given one of its characters the illness, though the issue was covered much less substantially in 1987 as a means of promoting breast cancer screening, when Sue Osman (Sandy Ratcliff) discovered a lump on her breast, which turned out to be <b>benign.</b>|$|E
5|$|In July 2015, Angle was {{expected}} to make an appearance at London Comic Con in England but his management team tweeted that Angle underwent emergency surgery to remove fluid buildup on his spinal cord after all of his extremities went numb. A week before this emergency, he had surgery to remove a <b>benign</b> tumor from his neck.|$|E
5|$|Pancreatic mucinous cystic {{neoplasms}} are a broad {{group of}} pancreas tumors that have varying malignant potential. They are being detected at a greatly increased rate as CT scans become {{more powerful and}} common, and discussion continues as how best to assess and treat them, given that many are <b>benign.</b>|$|E
5|$|Sold as Cialis and {{initially}} codenamed IC351, tadalafil {{is a drug}} prescribed for erectile dysfunction (ED) and approved for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). It is a phosphodiesterase type5 (PDE5) inhibitor, similar in function to sildenafil. In addition to ED and PAH, tadalafil has undergone clinical trials {{for the treatment of}} <b>benign</b> prostatic hyperplasia and for female sexual dysfunction.|$|E
5|$|The Devi Gita, {{like the}} Bhagavad Gita, is a {{condensed}} philosophical treatise. It presents the divine female {{as a powerful}} and compassionate creator, pervader and protector of the universe. She {{is presented in the}} opening chapter of the Devi Gita as the <b>benign</b> and beautiful world-mother, called Bhuvaneshvari (literally, ruler of the universe). Thereafter, the text presents its theological and philosophical teachings.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} to base the creatures on real animals was made early on. To offer players variety, {{a mixture of}} <b>benign</b> and aggressive creatures was deemed necessary. The team decided to implement anthropomorphised bipedal animals, because their humanoid form evoked empathy, and credibility in their potential sentience. Due to technical restraints, bipedal creatures also provided greater flexibility for animation and game dynamics.|$|E
5|$|The third type, {{pancreatic}} mucinous cystic neoplasms (MCNs) mainly {{occur in}} women, and may remain <b>benign</b> or progress to cancer. If these lesions become large, cause symptoms, or have suspicious features, they {{can usually be}} successfully removed by surgery.|$|E
5|$|The weretiger {{replaces the}} {{werewolf}} in shapeshifting folklore in Asia; in India they were evil sorcerers, while in Indonesia and Malaysia they were somewhat more <b>benign.</b> In the Hindu epic Mahabharata, tigers are fiercer and more ruthless than lions.|$|E
5|$|To {{pursue the}} concept of racial entitlement—even for the most admirable and <b>benign</b> of purposes—is to {{reinforce}} and preserve for future mischief the way of thinking that produced race slavery, race privilege and race hatred. In the eyes of government, we are just one race here. It is American.|$|E
25|$|Meningiomas {{often are}} {{considered}} <b>benign</b> tumors {{that can be}} removed by surgery, but most recurrent meningiomas correspond to histologic <b>benign</b> tumors. The metabolic phenotype of these <b>benign</b> recurrent meningiomas indicated an aggressive metabolism resembling that observed for atypical meningioma.|$|E
25|$|Lymphangiosarcoma is a {{malignant}} soft tissue tumor, whereas lymphangioma is a <b>benign</b> tumor occurring frequently {{in association with}} Turner syndrome. Lymphangioleiomyomatosis is a <b>benign</b> tumor of the smooth muscles of the lymphatics that occurs in the lungs.|$|E
25|$|The {{expression}} of hTERT {{can also be}} used to distinguish <b>benign</b> tumors from malignant tumors. Malignant tumors have higher hTERT expression than <b>benign</b> tumors. Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) quantifying hTERT expression in various tumor samples verified this varying expression.|$|E
25|$|<b>Benign</b> Rolandic {{epilepsy}} or <b>benign</b> {{childhood epilepsy}} with centrotemporal spikes (BCECTS) {{is the most}} common epilepsy syndrome in childhood. Most children will outgrow the syndrome (it starts around the age of 3-13 with a peak around 8–9 years and stops around age 14-18), hence the label <b>benign.</b> The seizures, sometimes referred to as sylvian seizures, start around the central sulcus of the brain (also called the centrotemporal area, located around the Rolandic fissure, after Luigi Rolando).|$|E
25|$|Rarely, <b>benign</b> {{intracranial}} hypertension.|$|E
25|$|Grade 1 {{tumors are}} <b>benign</b> astrocytomas.|$|E
25|$|About 95% {{of ovarian}} cysts are <b>benign,</b> not cancerous.|$|E
25|$|Spontaneous {{conversion}} of ventricular fibrillation {{to a more}} <b>benign</b> rhythm is rare in all but small animals. Defibrillation is the process that converts ventricular fibrillation to a more <b>benign</b> rhythm. This is usually by application of an electric shock to the myocardium and is discussed in detail in the relevant article.|$|E
25|$|A {{neoplasm}} can be <b>benign,</b> potentially malignant, or malignant (cancer).|$|E
25|$|A {{substantial}} number of women develop <b>benign</b> ovarian cysts after a hysterectomy.|$|E
25|$|<b>Benign</b> or {{malignant}} primary bone {{tumors are}} rare causes of hip fractures.|$|E
