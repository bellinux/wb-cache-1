5|$|Solitary in nature, the Atlantic torpedo {{is often}} seen resting on or half-buried in the {{substrate}} during the day, becoming more active at night. Large and well-defended from attack, it seldom falls prey to other animals. Known parasites of the Atlantic torpedo include the tapeworms Calyptrobothrium occidentale and C. minus, Grillotia microthrix, Monorygma sp., and Phyllobothrium gracile, the monogeneans Amphibdella flabolineata and Amphibdelloides maccallumi, and the copepod Eudactylina rachelae.

5|$|The tucuxi (Sotalia fluviatilis) in the Amazon River {{is another}} species descended from oceanic dolphins; however, {{it does not}} {{perfectly}} fit the label of 'facultative' either, as it occurs only in fresh water. The tucuxi was until recently considered conspecific with the Guiana dolphin (Sotalia guianensis), which inhabits marine waters. It may also be true for the Irrawaddy dolphin and the finless porpoise that, although the species {{may be found in}} both freshwater and marine environments, individual animals found in rivers may not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> in the ocean, and vice versa. The tucuxi is currently classified as an oceanic dolphin (Delphinidae).|$|E
5|$|The nose cone, which {{contained}} the ordnance that would impact the target, would {{separate from the}} rocket booster. This made the rocket lighter as only the nose cone and its ordnance had to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> re-entry, rather than the rocket. The unique innovations of the Hiroc missiles, such as the gimballed engines, and the internally supported frame, {{would go on to}} inspire the Atlas rockets. Several things changed however, such as the aluminum used for the missiles skin of the Hiroc, was switched out for stainless steel in the Atlas, because stainless steel had a higher melting point. The engines of the Atlas missiles were also much stronger, generating a total of 150,000 pounds-force (667,000 Newtons), compared to the Hiroc's total of 8,000 pounds-force (35,585 Newtons).|$|E

5|$|Gliese 876 b {{currently}} {{lies beyond}} {{the outer edge}} of the habitable zone but because Gliese 876 is a slowly evolving main-sequence red dwarf its habitable zone is very slowly moving outwards and will continue to do so for trillions of years. Therefore, Gliese 876 b will, in trillions of years time, lie inside Gliese 876's habitable zone, as defined by the ability of an Earth-mass planet to retain liquid water at its surface, and remain there for at least 4.6 billion years. While the prospects for life on a gas giant are unknown, large moons may be able to support a habitable environment. Models of tidal interactions between a hypothetical moon, the planet and the star suggest that large moons should <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> in orbit around Gliese 876 b for the lifetime of the system. On the other hand, it is unclear whether such moons could form in the first place. However, the large mass of the gas giant may make it more likely for larger moons to form.|$|E

25|$|O. longistaminataas donor of perenniality traits. This African {{species is}} genetically diverse, {{strongly}} perennial and rhizomatous. Rhizomes may <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> and spread in drier conditions than stolons. The downside of this donor {{is that it}} is more distantly related to cultivated rice and the crosses and backcrosses are much more difficult to make. Descendents of the few successful crosses are mostly infertile, and few were perennial. Interestingly, many of the perennial plants lacked rhizomes. Rhizomes may not be essential for survival, but they may help plants survive stress and they certainly help them spread.|$|E

25|$|The recent {{moves away}} from {{intervention}} buying, subsidies for specific crops, reductions in export subsidies, have changed the situation somewhat. In the past years intervention has been reduced or abolished in all sectors. After two decades of significant CAP reforms, farmers can now respond to market signals and increase production {{to react to the}} higher prices. Although the new decoupled payments were aimed at environmental measures, many farmers have found that without these payments their businesses would not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>survive.</b> With food prices dropping over the past thirty years in real terms, many products have been making less than their cost of production when sold at the farm gate.|$|E
25|$|Rascher {{was also}} tasked with {{discovering}} how long German airmen would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> if shot down above freezing water. His victims {{were forced to}} remain out of doors naked in freezing weather for up to 14 hours, or kept in a tank of icewater for 3 hours, their pulse and internal temperature measured {{through a series of}} electrodes. Warming of the victim was then attempted by different methods, most usually and successfully by immersion in very hot water, and also less conventional methods such as placing the subject in bed with women who would try to sexually stimulate him, a method suggested by Himmler.|$|E
25|$|The {{ability to}} <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> in both fresh and salt water also gives another benefit {{that has been}} driven by evolution. Because the {{majority}} of sharks are only able to survive in salt water, the bull shark has evolved to have their offspring in the fresh water where other sharks cannot enter. The freshwater acts as a protective area where the young are able to grow and mature without the threat of larger sharks preying on the younger bull sharks. This is an explanation for the behavior that is observed from the Bull sharks as to why there would be any reason for the adult bull shark to ever travel into a freshwater area despite being able to tolerate the high salinity of marine water.|$|E

25|$|After {{the rise}} of the being Gog, Alan Scott allies with the Justice Society members that oppose Gog's simplistic view of the world. However, after encountering a Justice Society from an {{alternate}} universe in which his daughter Jade is still alive, he considers asking the seemingly all powerful being to raise his daughter from the dead. Later, Sandman learns that Gog is rooting himself into the Earth, and if he remains for one more day, the Earth will no longer <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> without him. The rest of the JSA arrive to kill Gog by separating his head from the Earth, which {{is the only way to}} save the planet. The Society members ally with Gog in an attempt to protect him until they see him attempt to attack a Society member. All of Gog's followers, including Magog, turn on him, causing Gog's blessing on them to be undone. The JSA are able to topple Gog and send him to the Source Wall, but Alan is unable to see his daughter.|$|E
25|$|Viruses in the Paramyxoviridae {{family are}} also antigenically stable, {{meaning that the}} glycoproteins on the viruses are {{consistent}} between different strains of the same type. There are two reasons for this phenomenon. The first is that the genome is non-segmented and thus cannot undergo genetic reassortment. In order for this process to occur, segments are needed as reassortment happens when segments from different strains are mixed {{together to create a}} new strain. With no segments, nothing can be mixed with one another and so there is no antigenic shift. The second reason relates to the idea of antigenic drift. Since RNA dependent RNA polymerase does not have an error checking function, many mutations are made when the RNA is processed. These mutations build up and eventually new strains are created. Due to this concept, one would expect that paramyxoviruses should not be antigenically stable; however, the opposite is seen to be true. The main hypothesis behind why the viruses are antigenically stable is that each protein and amino acid has an important function. Thus, any mutation would lead to a decrease or total loss of function, which would in turn cause the new virus to be less efficient. These viruses would not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> as long compared to the more virulent strains, and so would die out.|$|E
