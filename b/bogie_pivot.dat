50|$|As on the Class 7E, the locomotive's {{pantograph}} {{contact shoe}} centres are directly above the <b>bogie</b> <b>pivot</b> centres {{to reduce the}} possibility of pantograph hookups on catenary in sharp curves, such as in turnouts, {{as a result of}} sideways movement of the pantograph in relation to the overhead wire.|$|E
50|$|A {{bogie bolster}} {{is the central}} section of the bogie that carries the entire weight of a coach's under frame. The <b>bogie</b> <b>pivots</b> around it using the center pivot pin. It couples to the bogie frame at each end using the {{secondary}} suspension system (typically coil springs and spring plank).|$|R
50|$|The two 3-axle <b>bogies</b> <b>pivot</b> on {{a central}} pin, with primary {{suspension}} {{being of the}} coil spring type with additional dampers. The power transmission is electric. In the original Class 130 a 16-cylinder turbo-charged diesel engine created electric energy for the nose-suspended DC traction motors. (Some rebuilt locomotives have 12-cylinder engines).|$|R
50|$|In some rare examples, {{such as the}} narrow-gauge , the bogie axles {{have been}} linked by {{coupling}} rods. Having only a single final-drive per bogie allows more room for the <b>bogie</b> <b>pivots</b> on this narrow-gauge design. With high power full-size locomotives, splitting the drive directly to two axles is preferred, as it only requires a less powerful final drive gearbox.|$|R
50|$|The second {{batch of}} 116 {{locomotives}} were delivered with tenders {{of which the}} underframe was modified. To improve the weight distribution, both <b>bogie</b> <b>pivot</b> centres were relocated 6 in towards the rear. This enabled the water capacity to be increased to 9500 imp gal on these 116 tenders.|$|E
50|$|As on the Class 7E, the locomotive's {{pantograph}} {{contact shoe}} centres are directly above the <b>bogie</b> <b>pivot</b> centres. The reason {{is to reduce}} the possibility of pantograph hookups on catenary in sharp curves, such as in turnouts, as a result of sideways movement of the pantograph in relation to the overhead wire.|$|E
50|$|The Class 7E was {{the first}} SAR {{electric}} locomotive on which the pantograph contact shoe centres were located directly above the <b>bogie</b> <b>pivot</b> centres. This {{reduces the risk of}} pantograph hookups on catenary in sharp curves such as in turnouts as a result of sideways movement of the pantograph in relation to the overhead wire.|$|E
50|$|Diagrams {{provided}} by Mallet {{make it clear}} that the swivelling truck was to be a Bissell truck, that is, a pony truck or <b>bogie</b> <b>pivoting</b> about a vertical pin some distance behind the centre of the truck itself. The weight of the front part of the locomotive frame was to be supported on an arc-shaped radial bearing. The truck could therefore turn into a curve and move to some extent laterally.|$|R
50|$|The {{main body}} of the vehicle is self-supporting, {{consisting}} of an underframe of three longitudinal sill plates (centre and sides), side walls, transverse support members for the <b>bogie</b> <b>pivots</b> and for the transformer, and end sill plates. The roof is in three sections and is removable, the two drivers cabins also have a replaceable front end. The buffer beam section is also a separate part, which allows replacement if it is damaged in a collision.|$|R
25|$|Lubricating {{the frame}} {{components}} (axle bearings, horn blocks and <b>bogie</b> <b>pivots)</b> depends on capillary action: trimmings of worsted yarn are trailed from oil reservoirs into pipes {{leading to the}} respective component. The rate of oil supplied {{is controlled by the}} size of the bundle of yarn and not the speed of the locomotive, so it is necessary to remove the trimmings (which are mounted on wire) when stationary. However, at regular stops (such as a terminating station platform), oil finding its way onto the track can still be a problem.|$|R
50|$|In the past, many {{different}} types of bogie (truck) have been used under tramcars (e.g. Brill, Peckham, maximum traction). A maximum traction truck has one driving axle with large wheels and one nondriving axle with smaller wheels. The <b>bogie</b> <b>pivot</b> is located off-centre, so more than half the weight rests on the driving axle.|$|E
50|$|In railway {{passenger}} cars fitted with flexicoil suspension, the springs {{are the only}} mechanical connection between the bogie and the car body. In heavier types of flexicoil suspension rolling stock, a <b>bogie</b> <b>pivot</b> fitted with rubber-metal bearings is used to hold a cross anchor yoke, which transfers the forces to the bogie frame via two cross anchor link pins.|$|E
50|$|The bogie {{suspension}} system consisted of coil primary suspension, and flexicoil secondary suspension with anti-hunting and anti-rocking dampers. Tractive forces from bogie to locomotive were transferred via traction rods {{connected to a}} low lying connection at the <b>bogie</b> <b>pivot</b> centre. Mechanical braking was by wheel mounted disc brakes. Electric braking is either up to 4.5MW rheostatic braking via roof mounted resistors, or up to 7.2MW regenerative braking.|$|E
50|$|Many low floor trams have fixed bogies which {{increase}} track {{wear and}} tear, while decreasing {{the speed at}} which a tram can drive through a curve (usually 4-15 km/h in 20 m radius curve). The Škoda ForCity and the newest Alstom Citadis X04 try to counter the effect with low floor <b>pivoting</b> <b>bogies</b> while maintaining 100% low floor design. Prior to the new design, <b>pivoting</b> <b>bogies</b> could only be used under high floors, hence such trams could only be part low-floor, with high-floor sections over the <b>pivoting</b> <b>bogies.</b>|$|R

50|$|There {{are also}} {{articulated}} railcars, with bogies under the point between the carriages rather than two <b>pivoting</b> <b>bogies</b> under each carriage (see Jacobs bogie).|$|R
50|$|Interestingly, in {{both the}} UK and the USA, single Fairlies were the first {{locomotives}} in each country to use the European Walschaerts valve gear. The Stephenson link gear, which was usual at the time, used multiple eccentrics between the frames but the Walschaerts gear was mounted outboard of the frames and connecting rods. This was advantageous because the Fairlie system required this space between the frames for the <b>bogie</b> <b>pivot.</b>|$|E
50|$|Like the {{subsequent}} Classes 2E, 3E and 4E, the Class 1E had bogie mounted draft gear. It had a Bo+Bo wheel arrangement with an articulated inter-bogie linkage, therefore no train forces were transmitted {{directly to the}} locomotive body. The <b>bogie</b> <b>pivot</b> centres were 6604 mm apart. One of the bottom pivot centres was fixed while the other was free to move longitudinally to allow for any wear occurring in the articulated coupling between the two bogies.|$|E
50|$|The {{rationale}} behind the design was that, if the tender frame could {{be carried on}} more points, represented by the rigidly mounted and Bissel wheels, instead of on only two <b>bogie</b> <b>pivot</b> centres, the frame could be made lighter. The vacuum cylinders which actuated brake blocks on the rigidly mounted wheels were mounted {{on top of the}} tank behind the coal bunker since the wheel arrangement left insufficient room to mount them under the frame as usual.|$|E
5000|$|A Bissel truck (also: Bissell {{truck or}} Bissel bogie) is a single-axled <b>bogie</b> which <b>pivots</b> towards {{the centre of}} a steam {{locomotive}} to enable it to negotiate curves more easily. Invented in 1857 by [...] and usually known as a pony truck, {{it is a very}} simple and common means of designing a carrying axle.|$|R
50|$|Modalohrs are {{specialized}} wagons {{for carrying}} road trailers and road tractors on the AFF route from France to Italy and Luxembourg to Spain and vice versa; {{there are plans}} to expand this service. A deck between the <b>bogies</b> (trucks) <b>pivots</b> (swings) 30°, allowing the trailers to be loaded from the sides. The cars are built by Lohr Industrie.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotive}} body {{consisted of}} single bridging slab. On this slab the body parts were fixed with screws. The bridging slab {{laid on the}} <b>bogies</b> using <b>pivot</b> bearings. To prevent the transmission of tractive forces over the body the bearings had longitudinal play. Beside these two spring-loaded bearings were mounted. The locomotive body was almost {{identical to the one}} of the Be 4/6 12302.|$|R
50|$|Transnet Freight Rail {{insisted that}} the {{locomotive}} should be designed {{in such a way}} that the pantograph contact shoe centres are directly above the <b>bogie</b> <b>pivot</b> centres, as was done on the Class 7E and Class 7E2, Series 1 and Series 2. The reason is to reduce the possibility of pantograph hookups on catenary in sharp curves, such as in turnouts, as a result of sideways movement of the pantograph in relation to the overhead wire.|$|E
50|$|Transnet Freight Rail {{insisted that}} the {{locomotive}} must be designed {{in such a way}} that the pantograph contact shoe centres are directly above the <b>bogie</b> <b>pivot</b> centres, as was done on the Class 7E and Class 7E2, Series 1 and Series 2 and again on the Class 20E. The reason is to reduce the possibility of pantograph hookups on catenary in sharp curves, such as in turnouts, as a result of sideways movement of the pantograph in relation to the overhead wire.|$|E
50|$|The Type FT tender was {{an unusual}} type which used six pairs of wheels in a 2-8-2 wheel arrangement, with the leading and {{trailing}} wheels in Bissel-type pony trucks {{and the rest of}} the axles mounted with a rigid wheelbase. Like the leading and trailing wheels of the engine, all tender wheels were fitted with roller bearings. The rationale behind the design was that if the tender frame could be carried on more points represented by the rigid and Bissel wheels instead of on only two <b>bogie</b> <b>pivot</b> centres, the frame could be made lighter.|$|E
50|$|The Jacobs bogie can {{be found}} in trams (streetcars) such as the Tatra K2 and Oslo's SL79. The first 100% low floor tram with <b>pivoting</b> <b>bogies,</b> the Škoda ForCity, also uses {{modified}} Jacobs bogies.|$|R
50|$|However, it was {{subsequently}} decided that, as the naval floating crane Titan {{was available in}} Sydney and was capable of lifting weights up to 200 tons, the problem was solved. So the <b>bogies,</b> central <b>pivot,</b> undercarriage and gun were unloaded in the Port of Sydney direct on the rails, at Jones Bay, Darling Harbour. From there, the gun was hauled to the N.S.W.G.R. Eveleigh Workshops, where {{with the assistance of}} Lieut. George Norman Pockett, Australian Army Engineer Ordnance Corps, all fittings and parts were reassembled.|$|R
50|$|The {{pony truck}} can move {{radially}} around a real or virtual pivot. When the pivot is situated {{at a point}} inside the truck, the truck is called a bogie. What makes it a Bissel <b>bogie</b> is the <b>pivot</b> being placed outside to the rear or fore.|$|R
50|$|The tender had a coal {{capacity}} of 10 lt t, a water {{capacity of}} 5587 imp gal {{and a maximum}} axle load of 12 lt 10 lcwt kg. It had an unusual wheel structure of six pairs of wheels in a 2-8-2 wheel arrangement, with the leading and trailing wheels in Bissel-type pony trucks {{and the rest of}} the axles mounted with a rigid wheelbase. Like the leading and trailing wheels of its engine, all tender wheels were fitted with roller bearings. The rationale behind the design was that, if the tender frame could be carried on more points, represented by the rigidly mounted and Bissel wheels, instead of on only two <b>bogie</b> <b>pivot</b> centres, the frame could be made lighter.|$|E
5000|$|There {{were several}} {{modifications}} form the standard US design. One is the alteration to the <b>bogie</b> <b>pivot</b> pin {{from the usual}} centre position to a point 18 in towards the buffer beam. The alteration enabled the locos to travel the tight curves found in the works, and also reduced excessive buffer and coupler misalignment. Deep buffer beams were fitted with a 3+1/2 in rail clearance, to minimise damage during derailments. To reduce excessive body roll due to poor track conditions, extra bearing pads were fitted {{to the outside of}} the bogie frame and the main frame. The fitting of large [...] capacity air reservoirs on each side enabled the locos to be used with 6 of the pneumatic dump cars in use at the steelworks. Also as the standard US design did not have buffers fitted, the BHP locos were fitted with buffers with oversized buffer heads, necessary for the tight curves and BHP’s own internal rolling stock.|$|E
30|$|<b>Bogie</b> <b>pivot</b> pin Transfers {{tractive}} effort (longitudinal) and cornering (lateral) {{forces from the}} bogie to the car-body. These are modelled with two nonlinear springs constrained {{to move in the}} longitudinal and lateral directions, respectively, with 4  mm of travel (±  2  mm from centre).|$|E
50|$|The bogies {{consist of}} the two lateral main beams, and the two cross beams at each end; there is no middle welded cross beam. The {{transfer}} of pulling and braking power from bogie to locomotive takes place via two rods, which connect the locomotive via pivot pin to the <b>bogie.</b> The <b>pivot</b> pins are mounted with a slight slant to enable {{the formation of a}} right angle to the also slightly slanted rods. The rods are spring mounted at about 40 mm to the pivot pin, so that the movement of the bogie could be balanced.|$|R
50|$|The fixed bogies {{which are}} used by most 100% low floor trams {{increase}} track wear and decrease {{the speed at which}} a tram can drive through a curve (usually 4 - 15 km/h in 20 m radius curve). The 15 T is designed to cope with these issues through Jacobs bogies under the articulations and <b>pivoting</b> <b>bogies</b> at the tram's ends. For a time it was said to be the only true 100% low floor tram with <b>pivoting</b> <b>bogies</b> in production. However, the Alstom Citadis X04, an experimental 100% low floor tram currently being developed with <b>pivoting</b> <b>bogies</b> (but with sections of high floor seating over the bogies), has made an initial production appearance as a modified Citadis 301 (with a fixed centre bogie) in Istanbul, and for Helsinki, a tram with similar interior solution and all <b>pivoting</b> <b>bogies</b> is undergoing trials as of 2015. With the same length of tramcar, the Škoda 15 T has also four bogies compared to the predecessor Škoda 14 T's three (same on most other 100% low floor trams) (fixed) bogies, which decreases the load each wheel puts on the track. The most of the tram floor is at height of 350 mm above rail; the height over the bogies is 450 mm above rail; the transition is inclined, without interior steps. The corridor above the central bogies is 700 mm wide. The bogies may be all driven, or some of them may be idle ones, depending on the customer's preferences. The bogies have two axles and two-level springing. The mounted wheels are made of rubber-sprung wheels with integrated brake-discs and axle bearing. On the axle bearings there is a combined, dynamically resistant, primary rubber-bonded-metal-sprung bogie framework. This bogie framework supports four traction motors and one (in outer bogies) or two (in inner bogies) sprung swing bolsters. The secondary springing of the swing bolsters is secured by steel coil springs with parallel hydraulic rotating dampers. On the swing bolsters there are pivot bearings, which facilitate full rotation of the bogie below the body without any limitations.|$|R
50|$|In the Škoda ForCity, {{which is}} the world's first 100% low floor tram with <b>pivoting</b> <b>bogies,</b> a Jacobs bogie {{supports}} the articulation between the two or more carbody sections. An articulated tram may be low-floor variety or high (regular) floor variety. Newer model trams may be up to 72 m long and carry 510 passengers at a comfortable 4 passengers/m2. At crush loadings this would be even higher.|$|R
