5|$|Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark {{retreated from}} Wollstonecraft's earlier focus on God as judge to God as mere creator, {{shocking}} some conservative readers {{who were not}} prepared to accept anything akin to deism. Worried more about Wollstonecraft's promotion of sensibility, fellow feminist and author Mary Hays criticized the book's mawkishness. A professor of moral philosophy, Thomas Brown, published a poetic response to the book, The Wanderer in Norway (1816). Rather than rejoicing in the freedom that Wollstonecraft argued the connection <b>between</b> <b>nature</b> <b>and</b> emotion offered, however, Brown represented {{her work as a}} failure and Wollstonecraft as a tragic victim. He read the book as a cautionary tale, whereas Wollstonecraft had intended it as a description of the possibilities of social and personal reform. As Favret argues, almost all of the responses to Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark placed the narrator/Mary in the position of a sentimental heroine, while the text itself, with its fusion of sensibility and politics, actually does much to challenge that image.|$|E
5|$|Some {{argue that}} nature {{represents}} a chaotic, lawless order {{which is in}} direct confrontation with the civilisation of Camelot throughout Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. The green horse and rider that first invade Arthur’s peaceful halls are iconic representations of nature's disturbance. Nature is presented throughout the poem as rough and indifferent, constantly threatening the order of men and courtly life. Nature invades and disrupts order in the major events of the narrative, both symbolically and through the inner nature of humanity. This element appears first with the disruption caused by the Green Knight, later when Gawain must fight off his natural lust for Bertilak’s wife, and again when Gawain breaks his vow to Bertilak by choosing to keep the green girdle, valuing survival over virtue. Represented by the sin-stained girdle, nature is an underlying force, forever within man and keeping him imperfect (in a chivalric sense). In this view, Gawain {{is part of a}} wider conflict <b>between</b> <b>nature</b> <b>and</b> chivalry, an examination of the ability of man's order to overcome the chaos of nature.|$|E

25|$|Eco{{feminism}} is a {{term that}} links feminism with ecology. Its advocates say that paternalistic/capitalistic society {{has led to a}} harmful split <b>between</b> <b>nature</b> <b>and</b> culture. Early ecofeminists propagated that the split can only be healed by the feminine instinct for nurture and holistic knowledge of nature's processes. Modern ecofeminism, or feminist eco-criticism, eschews such essentialism and instead focuses more on intersectional questions, such as how the nature-culture split enables the oppression of female and nonhuman bodies. It is also an activist and academic movement that sees critical connections between the exploitation of nature and the domination over women both caused by men.|$|E
25|$|Although {{scientists}} favor biological {{models for}} the cause of sexual orientation, they do not believe that it is the result of any one factor. They generally believe that it is determined by biological and environmental factors; they state that most people's sexual orientation is determined at an early age, and sexual orientation development involves a complex interplay <b>between</b> <b>nature</b> <b>and</b> nurture. The biological factors are genetic and hormonal, both of which affect the fetal development of the brain, while environmental factors may be sociological, psychological, or involve the early uterine environment. Scientists generally do not believe that sexual orientation is a matter of choice.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} yōkai animals other than cats in old tales that have similar attributes: the deep {{tenacity}} of snakes, {{the ability of}} foxes (kitsune) to shapeshift into women, and the brutality of tanuki in eating humans depicted in the Kachi-kachi Yama folktale from the Edo period. Cats in particular, however, have acquired {{a great number of}} tales and superstitions surrounding them, due to the unique position they occupy <b>between</b> <b>nature</b> <b>and</b> civilization. As cities and towns were established and humans began living farther apart from nature, cats came with them. Since cats live close to humans yet retain their wild essence and air of mystery, stories grew up around them, and gradually the image of the bakeneko was formed.|$|E

500|$|Critic Gabriele Sander {{has called}} Berge Meere und Giganten an [...] "epic about the {{conflict}} <b>between</b> <b>nature</b> <b>and</b> technology," [...] {{and other critics}} have also emphasized the novel's portrayal of the often violent relationship between humanity, nature, and technology. Peter Sprengel has taken a different approach, arguing that the novel is characterized not by a dichotomous opposition <b>between</b> <b>nature</b> <b>and</b> technology, but rather by the way it blurs {{the distinction between the}} organic and the inorganic. Hannelore Qual has documented how the novel ties Döblin's philosophy of nature to his ideas about society and politics, arguing for an affinity between Döblin's thought and the anarchism of Gustav Landauer and Pyotr Kropotkin.|$|E

Here van Gogh was more concerned about emotional and spiritual reality than literal interpretation. The women harvest olives for sustenance.

The poem depicts {{the relationship between}} Lucy and nature through a complex opposition of images. Antithetical couplings of words—"sun and shower", [...] "law and impulse", [...] "earth and heaven", [...] "kindle and restrain"—are used to evoke the opposing forces inherent in nature. A conflict <b>between</b> <b>nature</b> <b>and</b> humanity is described, as each attempts to possess Lucy. The poem contains both epithalamic and elegiac characteristics; Lucy is shown as wedded to nature, while her human lover is left alone to mourn {{in the knowledge that}} death has separated her from humanity.|$|E

500|$|The {{exploration}} of the relationship <b>between</b> <b>nature</b> <b>and</b> evangelical Christianity is another typically Victorian theme. Coral connects the two ideas. Literary critic Katharine Anderson explains that coral jewellery, popular in the period, had a [...] "pious significance". The [...] "enchanted garden" [...] of coral the boys discover {{at the bottom of}} their island's lagoon is suggestive of [...] "missionary encounters with the societies of the Pacific Island". [...] In Victorian society coral had been given an [...] "evangelical framing", and the little [...] "coral insect" [...] responsible for building coral reefs mirrored the [...] "child reader's productive capacity as a fundraiser for the missionary cause"; literary critic Michelle Elleray discusses numerous children's books from the early to mid-19th century, including The Coral Island, in which coral plays such an educational role.|$|E

[...] Critic Jenny Emery Davidson believes that Dillard's act of [...] "stalking" [...] allows her to rewrite the hunting myth, a popular theme in nature writing which mediates the space <b>between</b> <b>nature</b> <b>and</b> humans. [...] Although {{a long tradition of}} male nature writers—including James Fenimore Cooper, Jack London and Richard Nelson—have used this theme as [...] "a symbolic ritual of violence", Dillard [...] "ventures into the terrain of the hunt, employing its rhetoric while also challenging its conventions." ...|$|E
500|$|Six singles were {{released}} from Post: [...] "Army of Me", [...] "Isobel", [...] "It's Oh So Quiet", [...] "Hyperballad", [...] "Possibly Maybe", and [...] "I Miss You"; {{with three of}} them charting in the British top 10. The acclaimed music videos that accompanied every single heavily aided Björk's success, and have been noted for its surrealism, thematic focus on the relationship <b>between</b> <b>nature</b> <b>and</b> technology, and artistic legitimation of the medium. The peak of media interest on the singer and the extensive Post Tour proved detrimental to her welfare: she caused controversy by knocking a reporter to the ground, and a stalker unsuccessfully attempted to murder her. Because of this, Björk would relocate away from the press in Spain to produce Homogenic, her following studio album. For its integration of pop and experimental styles, Post is now considered one of Björk's quintessential releases, {{one of the greatest}} albums of the decade and, occasionally, of all time.|$|E

An online sample of 399 U. S. women and men (Mage = 34. 55 years) completed measures of body appreciation, connectedness to nature, nature exposure, appearance investment, sociocultural attitudes toward appearance, and self-esteem. Path analysis showed that <b>nature</b> exposure <b>and</b> connectedness to <b>nature,</b> respectively, were associated with body appreciation in women and men, both directly and indirectly via self-esteem. Connectedness to nature also mediated the link <b>between</b> <b>nature</b> exposure <b>and</b> body appreciation. In men, but not women, the link <b>between</b> connectedness to <b>nature</b> <b>and</b> body appreciation was also mediated by appearance investment and internalisation of a muscular ideal. These results may point to novel methods for promoting more positive body image in adults through engagement with nature...|$|R
