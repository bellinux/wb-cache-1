Doggett interprets this statement as reflecting Harrison's [...] "decaying relationship" [...] with McCartney at the time. Lennon too had been a friend of Harrison's since school days, and Leng includes him {{as a source of}} Harrison's [...] "minibereavement" [...] at the Beatles' impending demise.|$|E

500|$|Jeremy Medina of Entertainment Weekly said he {{believed}} although the show initially needed improvement, that it had arrived at a [...] "settled and focused" [...] series with [...] "The Banquet". He praised the episode as a whole, {{as well as individual}} small moments, like Leslie's haircut, April calling her [...] "sir", Ron's affinity for bacon-wrapped shrimp, Tom's coining of the phrase [...] "peacockin" [...] to mean standing out in bars. Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger said [...] "The Banquet" [...] was funnier than other recent Parks and Recreation episodes, although he said the Leslie character continues to too closely resemble a female Michael Scott, the protagonist of The Office. Sepinwall said of the show, [...] "I {{know a lot of people}} have already given up, but I really feel like the show is a summer's worth of tweaking away from being good. It's not there yet, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> glimmers." ...|$|E
500|$|Stengel tried incessantly {{to promote}} the Mets, talking to reporters or anyone else who would listen. He often used the word [...] "amazin'" [...] (as he put it) and soon this became the [...] "Amazin' Mets", a {{nickname}} that stuck. Stengel urged the fans, [...] "Come out and see my amazin' Mets. I been in this game a hundred years <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> new ways to lose I never knew existed before." [...] Stengel was successful in selling the team to some extent, as the Mets drew 900,000 fans, half again as many as the Giants had prior to their departure, though the games against the Giants and Dodgers accounted for half of the total. The team was less successful on the field, finishing {{with a record of}} 40â€“120, the most losses of any 20th century major league team. They finished 60 games behind the pennant-winning Giants, and 18 games behind ninth-place Chicago.|$|E

500|$|While Wollstonecraft does {{call for}} {{equality}} {{between the sexes}} in particular areas of life, such as morality, she does not explicitly state {{that men and women}} are equal. What she does claim is that men and women are equal in the eyes of God. However, such claims of equality stand in contrast to her statements respecting the superiority of masculine strength and valour. Wollstonecraft famously and ambiguously writes: [...] "Let it not be concluded that I wish to invert the order of things; I have already granted, that, from the constitution of their bodies, men seem to be designed by Providence to attain a greater degree of virtue. I speak collectively of the whole sex; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> not the shadow of a reason to conclude that their virtues should differ in respect to their nature. In fact, how can they, if virtue has only one eternal standard? I must therefore, if I reason consequently, as strenuously maintain that they have the same simple direction, as that there is a God." [...] Her ambiguous statements regarding the equality of the sexes have since made it difficult to classify Wollstonecraft as a modern feminist, particularly since the word and the concept were unavailable to her.|$|E
500|$|... "A Time Machine Is My New Girlfriend" [...] is a frenetic rocker with a Bo Diddley rhythm, {{and lyrics}} cautioning {{listeners}} that relationships can come with [...] "late fees". Hunt explained its lyrics to be {{a metaphor for}} his lover making him feel younger. The title track features metronomic drumming and chicken scratch riffs. It is about people from different economic classes falling in love after social and economic conditions moved them into the same neighborhood. The setting is described in the first verse, [...] "It's the end of white flight / even tycoons are licking their wounds / economic blight got the neighborhood looking gap-toothed / end of white flight / maybe now you see something you like / money tight and you're hating your life". Hunt said that writing the song was [...] "essentially a response {{to some of the}} things I have seen {{as a result of the}} global recession we are going through. I wasn't trying to make any political statement. I was more making a philosophical comment that essentially says we have all these unspoken issues in our society. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> a collision of those ideas and unresolved issues. My question is what could you have been hoping for when we make the kind of decisions in our society that we have made." ...|$|E

[...] Almost as if to predict the upcoming Vietnam War, he stated: [...] "Our most important duty {{is to keep the}} peace for the U.S., as Dwight Eisenhower had done.

2500|$|A {{few weeks}} after his {{conviction}} in New Jersey, Slocum and the Spray visited Sagamore Hill, the estate of US President Theodore Roosevelt {{on the north shore}} of Long Island, New York. Roosevelt and his family were interested in the tales of Slocum's solo circumnavigation. The President's young son, Archie, along with a guardian, spent the next few days sailing with Slocum up to Newport aboard the Spray, which, by then, was a decrepit, weather-worn vessel. Slocum again met with President Roosevelt in May 1907, this time at the White House in Washington. Supposedly, Roosevelt said to him, [...] "Captain, our adventures have been a little different." [...] Slocum answered, [...] "That is true, Mr. President, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> you got here first." ...|$|E
2500|$|Among curators and art {{collectors}} {{and others in}} the art world, Koons' work is labeled as Neo-pop or Post-Pop as part of a 1980s movement in reaction to the pared-down art of Minimalism and Conceptualism in the previous decade. Koons resists such comments: [...] "A viewer might at first see irony in my work... <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> none at all. Irony causes too much critical contemplation". Koons' crucial point is to reject any hidden meaning in his artwork. The meaning is only what one perceives at first glance; there is no gap between what the work is in itself and what is perceived. He tries to reach a widest possible audience by using familiar objects with sentimental value. He considers it his mission to make the viewer confident of his own judgment and taste.|$|E

2500|$|One picture bride {{summarizes}} {{the feelings of}} many of the brides subsequent to meeting their husbands, she writes [...] "I came to Hawaii and was so surprised and very disappointed, because my husband sent his twenty-five-year-old handsome-looking picture...He came to the pier, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> he's really old, old-looking. He was forty-five years more old than I am. My heart stuck." [...] On average, the grooms were ten to fifteen years older than their brides. The age of their husbands were not the only shock for the women, they were also taken aback by their living conditions. Many women expected to live in houses like ones in the photos the men sent them, but instead found plantation quarters that were crude, isolated, and racially segregated. One of the reasons that the grooms and go-betweens were not altogether truthful with the future brides was because they believed that the women would not come if they knew the reality of the man and his conditions.|$|E
2500|$|Rousseau also {{mentioned}} the watchmaker theory. He wrote the following in his 1762 book, Emile: [...] I am {{like a man}} who sees the works of a watch for the first time; he is never weary of admiring the mechanism, though he does not know the use of the instrument and has never seen its face. I do not know what this is for, says he, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> that each part of it is fitted to the rest, I admire the workman in the details of his work, and I am quite certain that all these wheels only work together in this fashion for some common end which I cannot perceive. Let us compare the special ends, the means, the ordered relations of every kind, then let us listen to the inner voice of feeling; what healthy mind can reject its evidence? Unless the eyes are blinded by prejudices, can they fail to see that the visible order of the universe proclaims a supreme intelligence? What sophisms must be brought together before we fail to understand the harmony of existence and the wonderful co-operation of every part for the maintenance of the rest? ...|$|E
2500|$|Buddhism accepts both {{freedom and}} {{determinism}} (or {{something similar to}} it), {{but in spite of}} its focus towards the human agency, rejects the western concept of a total agent from external sources. According to the Buddha, [...] "There is free action, there is retribution, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> no agent that passes out from one set of momentary elements into another one, except the [...] of those elements." [...] Buddhists believe in neither absolute free will, nor determinism. It preaches a middle doctrine, named pratitya-samutpada in Sanskrit, often translated as [...] "inter-dependent arising". This theory is also called [...] "Conditioned Genesis" [...] or [...] "Dependent Origination". It teaches that every volition is a conditioned action as a result of ignorance. In part, it states that free will is inherently conditioned and not [...] "free" [...] to begin with. It is also part of the theory of karma in Buddhism. The concept of karma in Buddhism is different from the notion of karma in Hinduism. In Buddhism, the idea of karma is much less deterministic. The Buddhist notion of karma is primarily focused on the cause and effect of moral actions in this life, while in Hinduism the concept of karma is more often connected with determining one's destiny in future lives.|$|E

2500|$|Obama was {{scheduled}} to give his keynote address {{on the night of}} Tuesday, July 27. [...] Some Obama advisors were concerned prior to his delivery, because it amounted to the first time he used a teleprompter. [...] He would have three one-hour practice sessions in what were normally the FleetCenter locker rooms of the Boston Bruins and the Boston Celtics, reportedly having difficulty with the teleprompter while also learning various techniques in speaking to a live and TV audience. [...] Once while Obama was backstage rehearsing his speech, he met Kerry staffer and speechwriter Jon Favreau (later to become Obama's speechwriter), who instructed him that to avoid overlap with Kerry, a sentence had to be changed. The sentence involved, later recalled as [...] "We're not red states and blue states; we're all Americans, standing up together for the red, white, and blue" [...] was to conclude his paragraph on red states and blue states, but was instead used by Kerry as [...] "Maybe some just see us divided into those red states and blue states, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> us as one America: red, white, and blue"; it is unclear whether or not this already existed in Kerry's speech, but regardless, its removal left Obama incensed.|$|E
