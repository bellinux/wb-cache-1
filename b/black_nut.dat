They expected and received many gifts, {{and they were so}} much addicted to theft that a constant watch had to be kept upon them, while examples had occasionally to be made of those who were caught in the act. Soon after their arrival the ships were visited in state by the King of the island, whose name was Terreeoboo. Some of his chiefs accompanied him, and all of them were dressed in rich feathered cloaks and helmets, and armed with long spears and daggers. Along with them they brought their idols, which were gigantic busts made of wicker-work, curiously covered with small feathers. Their eyes were made of large pearl oysters, with a <b>black</b> <b>nut</b> fixed in the centre of each; double rows of dogs' teeth ornamented their mouths, and their features were strangely distorted. The King and his friends were hospitably received. Presents were made, and expressions of good-will and friendship interchanged.|$|E

50|$|Interiors were {{available}} in four colors: <b>black,</b> <b>nut</b> brown, sky blue, and wine red. With the only exceptions of the A and C-pillar inner plastic moldings, the windshield and rear hatch inner plastic surrounding moldings, the door latches, the door cranks, the side armrests, the door ashtrays, {{the steering wheel and}} column plus the dashboard the rest of the interior is 100% made and designed in Mexico by VAM's styling department. The most striking features of the Lerma's interior design relied on the its door panels, side panels, trunk and seats. The first two incorporated high trim fabric and lower portion horizontal carpet inserts with fake horizontal chrome (lower portion) and woodgrain (upper portion) moldings. The seats consisted of a fixed rear bench seat and individual recling front wide bucket seats with adjustable headrests. The pattern on these seats is nothing short of impressive, incorporating a design of four squared buttons forming another square over the seat bottoms and backs. These portions are actually outer ones over {{the main body of the}} seat and is not stretched out, giving the feeling and impression of having a cushion over both the main seat bottom and back. The bases of both sets of seats are covered in carpet. The VAM Lerma was the only four-door VAM car not to incorporate a fixed front bench seat, making it also the only four-door VAM car to incorporate individual (reclining) front seats. The Lerma's trunk is unique among VAM (and AMC) cars alike. It is a closed compartment covered in carpet and incorporated both rear stereo speakers at each side of the lid. The lid itself is hinged to the back of the frame near the rear seat back and had a fixed rear light similar to the ones used in the hood, it would flick on and off depending on the position of the lid. Despite how truly elegant the trunk looked, its design made to follow the side lines of the interior of the car as well as the dimensions of the massive rear hatch glass ended up creating a truly low amount of trunk space for barely anything other than the spare tire. This situation forced owners to buy an external roof rack fixed to the side drip rails in order to be able to carry any luggage, which might compromise the looks of the car.|$|E

50|$|<b>Black</b> walnut <b>nuts</b> are shelled commercially in the United States. About 65% of {{the annual}} wild harvest comes from the U.S. state of Missouri, and the largest {{processing}} plant is operated by Hammons Products in Stockton, Missouri.

Consumers include black walnuts in traditional treats, such as cakes, cookies, fudge, and pies, during the fall holiday season. The nuts' nutritional profile leads to uses in other foods, such as salads, fish, pork, chicken, vegetables and pasta dishes.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: [...] The current {{situation}} of black walnut (Juglans nigra L.) in the United States related to area, volume, growth, mortality, and removals is presented.

The majority of the black walnut timberland was classed as sawtimber. Growing-stock and sawtimber volume almost doubled between 1963 and 1989. The long-term future for black walnut appears bright due to favorable growth to removal ratios. Aspects of <b>black</b> walnut <b>nut</b> production in relation to the resource are presented...|$|R

40|$|A {{review of}} {{research}} related to oral submucous fibrosis (OSF) among South Africans of Indian descent shows a certain uniqueness compared to other countries. In South Africa the betel habit is more common among women, only 60 &#x 0025; of chewers prefer the betel quid while the rest like the nut by itself, the majority of chewers prefer the baked (<b>black)</b> <b>nut</b> variety and a minority add tobacco to their chew. This pattern reflects {{in the distribution of}} OSF and the practice of the habit by OSF subjects. Compared to chewers without OSF, OSF subjects are younger and have shorter histories of chewing. Yet the profile of systemic diseases were similar among subjects with and without OSF. The habit as practised in South Africa also determines the pattern of oral squamous carcinomas. They are more common in women, with buccal mucosa cancers being the most frequent. The latter are commonly found in subjects not using any tobacco, indicating the carcinogenicity of the areca nut. It was also shown that oral cancer can develop in chewers without an intermediate precancerous OSF phase. A follow-up of OSF cases after cessation of the habit revealed that once present the disease is permanent. An analysis of cultured OSF fibroblasts demonstrated a permanent shift to larger cells theoretically capable of producing larger amounts of collagen. Thus the agents in the nut could be the initiators of the disease and its permanent character the result of a phenotypic alteration in cells from changes in gene expression...|$|E

40|$|Thevetia neriifolia Juss., family apocynaceae, {{to which}} also be-long strophanthus, apocynum, and oleander (Nerium oleander)., is a tree, 10 to 20 feet high, {{originally}} indigenous to South Amer-ica and the West Indies, but now cultivated in the East Indies, India, the Hawaiian Islands and Western Africa. The plant bears brown or <b>black</b> <b>nuts,</b> the toxic property {{of which was}} a!-ready known to European scientists, such as Pison and Clusius (2), {{in the second half}} of the sixteenth century. Clusius (1574) described how the native Indians wore the shells of the nuts around their neck, waist, or legs, and used them as ornaments and rattles during dances. In the nineteenth century, additional information became available (3). Guibourt definitely stated that the kernels of the nuts are fatally poisonous, and Madianne (1827) observed that an emulsion of one kernel caused the death of a dog in twenty-five minutes. Decourtilz, as quoted by Huse-mann (4), mentioned a case of poisoning in a young negro. Simi-larly, Balfour and Maclagen (1857) reported two additional cases of intoxification, with ultimate recovery, resulting from eating the nut. Dumontier (1856), cited by DeVry (5), also published an account of the poisoning of a mulatto child, three years of age, who died from eating a seed of Thevetia neriifolia. Dey (6) no-ticed two cases of homicidal poisoning in Bengal in the course of one month.
