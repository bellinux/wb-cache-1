25|$|January 23, 1812, 1515 UTC (9:15 a.m.); (M ~7.3) {{epicenter}} around New Madrid, {{although this}} is disputed. This was probably {{the smallest of the}} three main shocks, but resulted in widespread ground deformation, landslides, fissuring, and stream <b>bank</b> <b>caving</b> in the meizoseismal area. Johnston and Schweig attributed this earthquake to a rupture on the New Madrid North Fault. A minority viewpoint holds that this earthquake's epicenter was in southern Illinois. A 2011 expert panel urged further research to clarify this point, stating that the Illinois hypothesis would mean that an extended section of fault exists, perhaps still loaded and capable of hosting a great earthquake in the future.|$|E
50|$|Hydraulic action {{describes}} the erosion {{caused by the}} dragging of water over the stream bed and bank. This dragging, coupled {{with the impact of}} small parties, easily loosens and erodes smaller alluvial matter, such as gravel, sand, silt and clay (Mangelsdorf, 1990). One powerful example of hydraulic action is <b>bank</b> <b>caving,</b> which normally occurs when a stream loosens sediment and undercuts a bank. Consequently, large masses of sediment slump and collapse into the stream, adding significantly to the stream’s load (Strahler and Strahler, 2006). The severity of hydraulic action increases with stream velocity and current stream load.|$|E
50|$|The 1811-12 New Madrid {{earthquakes}} {{were caused}} by earthquakes on the Mississippi River, and represent bank failure caused by tectonic activity in the New Madrid Seismic Zone (NMSZ). The NMSZ {{is the result of}} a failed rift system which remains weak today, and thus is prone to faulting and earthquake activity. The earthquakes caused immediate bank failure, in which the surface banks fell above and below the water surface, causing swells large enough to sink a boat. Some swells {{were caused by}} the sediment falling into the river, but at other times the swells themselves hitting the banks caused large areas of the Mississippi banks to fall at one time. The waters of the Mississippi were seen to flow backwards, due to the shocks caused by the earthquake. Large amounts of sediment were introduced into the river. <b>Bank</b> <b>caving</b> was seen as far downriver as Memphis, Tennessee. Vertical offsets may have been the primary source of turbulence, though short lived.|$|E

40|$|Serious flooding, slope failures, and {{landslides}} {{occurred when}} a violent rainstorm hit Nakorn Srithammarat Province. As {{a result of}} the findings of project TCP/THA/ 8957 (E) and to avoid future repetitions of such damage in southern Thailand, the following measures should be taken by the responsible authorities of the Royal Thai Government. 1. Automatic flood warning systems should be installed in more meteorological stations in southern provinces, particularly those districts and communities located around mountainous areas. A flood warning simulation could be developed to give early warnings to the local people. No further settlements should be allowed on steep slopes in catchment areas and vulnerable villages should be relocated to safer places. 2. In order to monitor the impact of floods and landslides in the affected areas, and identify slope failures (through remote sensing techniques), RFD should create a Geographic Information Systen (GIS) to register information. 3. In order to monitor natural catastrophes and their ecological impact, appropriate watershed management planning and permanent research station(s) should be established. 4. Future soil erosion may be avoided by undertaking reforestation, erosion control and soil conservation measures for stabilizing steep slopes. Such rehabilitation works should {{be a part of the}} integrated watershed management plan. Permanent embankments should be constructed in some parts of rivers to protect future <b>bank</b> <b>caving.</b> 5. In order to reduce surface runoff and soil losses, additional agricultural cover crops of economic interest to farmers should be planted under rubber trees. Carefully designed terracing should be promoted on steep slopes where agricultural crops are cultivated. 6. The conversion of natural forests into rubber plantations or for agricultural use should be regulated. 7. In order to inform local people of the natural functions of the forest, including their limitations in extreme events, extension programmes on nature conservation and soil conservation should be developed...|$|E

50|$|Tawny fish owls {{are highly}} solitary and {{territorial}} as are {{a majority of}} owls. The breeding season is November to February in India and December to February in Assam. Nest locations found have included large holes in river <b>banks,</b> <b>caves</b> in cliffs and the fork or crotch of a large tree. As in all owls, tawny fish owls do not build a nest so merely lay their eggs on the bare ground of whatever surface they use. They also not infrequently nest in abandoned nests built by Pallas's fish eagles (Haliaeetus leucoryphus). Usually two eggs are laid but sometimes only one is. The eggs can {{range in size from}} 56 to 58.8 mm x 45.5 to 48.3 mm, with an average of 57.1 x 46.9 mm, and are similar in size to those of the brown fish owl.

5000|$|As Twain {{describes}} {{at length}} in Life on the Mississippi, a rare combination {{of skills and}} talents, honed to perfection and maintained there by unremitting drill, was required in the mid-Nineteenth Century, in order to safely navigate a steamboat on the Mississippi and the Missouri, [...] "vast streams...whose alluvial <b>banks</b> <b>cave</b> and change constantly, whose snags are always hunting up new quarters, whose sandbars are never at rest, whose channels are for ever dodging and shirking, and whose obstructions must be confronted in all nights and all weathers without that time {{the aid of a}} single light-house or a single buoy." [...] The pilot needed to have total, perfect, and instantaneous recall for every detail of the river's meandering and ever-changing channel, with its chutes, islands, sandbars, underwater rocks, [...] "reefs", snags, and sunken wrecks. He needed to be able to intuit exactly how any rise or fall in the river would affect its minimum depth at hundreds of shoal places, and know how to read {{the surface of the water}} [...] "like a book." [...] Finally, and most importantly, the successful pilot required [...] "good and quick judgment and decision, and a cool, calm courage that no peril can shake." [...] Successful pilots were able to command a salary variously reported as six times that of a clergyman and greater than that of the Vice-President of the United States. In this demanding profession, Horace Bixby was an acknowledged master.|$|R
50|$|During {{the summer}} of 1859, Harris and Netherland engaged {{in a series of}} debates at {{campaign}} stops across the state. In spite of the growing sectional crisis, the key issue at most campaign stops was the Bank of Tennessee, which had become controversial following a series of bank failures in 1857. Harris, who had been bickering with the <b>bank's</b> president, <b>Cave</b> Johnson, opposed the bank. Netherland, arguing the bank provided money for the state's education fund, supported it. The issue of slavery occasionally came up, with Harris attempting to tie Netherland to the abolitionist motives of northern Republicans, and Netherland accusing Harris of sensationalizing the issue.|$|R

60|$|WHOSOEVER {{has done}} me the {{courtesy}} {{to read my}} chapters which have preceded this may possibly wonder that I deal so minutely with piloting as a science. It was the prime purpose of those chapters; and I am not quite done yet. I wish to show, in the most patient and painstaking way, what a wonderful science it is. Ship channels are buoyed and lighted, and therefore it is a comparatively easy undertaking to learn to run them; clear-water rivers, with gravel bottoms, change their channels very gradually, and therefore one needs to learn them but once; but piloting becomes another matter when you apply it to vast streams like the Mississippi and the Missouri, whose alluvial <b>banks</b> <b>cave</b> and change constantly, whose snags are always hunting up new quarters, whose sandbars are never at rest, whose channels are for ever dodging and shirking, and whose obstructions must be confronted in all nights and all weathers {{without the aid of}} a single light-house or a single buoy; for there is neither light nor buoy to be found anywhere in all this three or four thousand miles of villainous river.{footnote [True at the time referred to; not true now (1882).]} I feel justified in enlarging upon this great science for the reason that I feel sure no one has ever yet written a paragraph about it who had piloted a steamboat himself, and so had a practical knowledge of the subject. If the theme were hackneyed, I should be obliged to deal gently with the reader; but since it is wholly new, I have felt at liberty to take up a considerable degree of room with it.|$|R
60|$|On {{the river}} front {{some of the}} houses was {{sticking}} out over the bank, and they was bowed and bent, and about ready to tumble in, The people had moved out of them. The <b>bank</b> was <b>caved</b> away under one corner of some others, and that corner was hanging over. People lived in them yet, but it was dangersome, because sometimes a strip of land as wide as a house caves in at a time. Sometimes a belt of land {{a quarter of a}} mile deep will start in and cave along and cave along till it all caves into the river in one summer. Such a town as that has to be always moving back, and back, and back, because the river's always gnawing at it.|$|R

50|$|The {{combined}} canal {{system was}} the largest canal {{system in the world}} - but was only profitable for a short period. The canal was useless in winter, and the <b>banks</b> were constantly <b>caving</b> in, requiring constant dredging to remain passable.

Two of Mason's brothers had been business partners of Duff in Kaskaskia, Illinois, in the 1780s. Mason created a combination tavern, gambling den, brothel, and criminal refuge.

60|$|This was the stormiest {{sea that}} we witnessed,--more tumultuous, my {{companion}} affirmed, than the rapids of Niagara, and, of course, on {{a far greater}} scale. It was the ocean in a gale, a clear, cold day, with only one sail in sight, which labored much, {{as if it were}} anxiously seeking a harbor. It was high tide when we reached the shore, and in one place, for a considerable distance, each wave dashed up so high that it was difficult to pass between it and the bank. Further south, where the bank was higher, it would have been dangerous to attempt it. A native of the Cape has told me that, many years ago, three boys, his playmates, having gone to this beach in Wellfleet to visit a wreck, when the sea receded ran down to the wreck, and when it came in ran before it to the bank, but the sea following fast at their heels, caused the <b>bank</b> to <b>cave</b> and bury them alive.|$|R

5000|$|In the 1880s, {{the area}} was an {{important}} railroad and river terminus for cotton distribution, {{and a series of}} ferries facilitated movement of cargo and passengers from the island to the Illinois riverbank. The narrow gauge Texas and St. Louis Railway built into Bird's Point in 1882. When the remainder of the railroad was completed, it stretched from Bird's Point to Gatesville, Texas. An incline was used to transfer railcars onto car floats for the cross-Mississippi trip from Birds Point to Cairo, Illinois. The narrow-gauge Texas and St. Louis went bankrupt and the new company was the St. Louis Arkansas and Texas Railway. That railroad standard gauged the rail line so the railroads shippers would not have to break bulk by transferring to a different gauge railroad. When the St. Louis, Arkansas and Texas Railway went bankrupt it was taken over by the St. Louis Southwestern Railway, nicknamed the Cotton Belt. The railroad ran from Bird's Point through Pine Bluff, Arkansas, Texarkana, Texas and to Gatesville, Texas, offering planters a convenient route to transfer their cotton bales to the Mississippi for water transport to markets in the Midwest. The Cotton Belt moved most of its car ferry operations to a new incline and car float at Gray's Point, Missouri in 1898. In September 1908, the river <b>bank</b> <b>caved</b> in and essentially destroyed the boat yard and surrounding facilities. The railroad incline was destroyed in a flood in April 1909. The Cotton Belt continued to serve Birds Point with rail service for a number of years. The Cotton Belt 5.3 mile rail line between Birds Point and Wyatt, Missouri was abandoned by Interstate Commerce Commission order on October 9, 1938. In late 1941 an oil pipeline was laid on the old Cotton Belt right of way between Wyatt and Birds Point to facilitate the transportation of crude oil by barge. A small tank farm was built just south of Birds Point for oil storage. Cotton Belt handled railroad tank cars from Texas and Louisiana to Wyatt for shipment of the oil to Birds Point and trans loading onto barges.|$|R

Here and there a cabin or two, standing in small openings on the gray and grassless banks--cabins which had formerly stood a quarter or half-mile farther to the front, and gradually been pulled farther and farther back as the shores caved in.

25|$|The more {{primitive}} species nest in existing cavities, {{for example in}} an old woodpecker nest, while other species excavate burrows in soft substrate such as sand banks. Swallows in the genera Hirundo, Ptyonoproggne, Cecropis, Petrochelidon and Delichon build mud nests close to overhead shelter in locations that are protected from both the weather and predators. The mud-nesters are most common in the Old World, particularly Africa, whereas cavity-nesters are the rule in the New World. Mud nesting species in particular are limited in areas of high humidity, which causes the mud nests to crumble. Many <b>cave,</b> <b>bank</b> and cliff dwelling species of swallow nest in large colonies. Mud nests are constructed by both males and females, and amongst the tunnel diggers the excavation duties are shared as well. In historical times, the introduction of man-made stone structures such as barns and bridges, together with forest clearance, {{has led to an}} abundance of colony sites around the globe, significantly increasing the breeding ranges of some species. Birds living in large colonies typically have to contend with both ectoparasites and conspecific nest parasitism. Old males benefit most from coloniality, since they are able to maintain their own nests and benefit from frequent extra-pair copulations.|$|R
40|$|This {{study focused}} on gully {{development}} along River Ngaddabul floodplain in Maiduguri, Borno State, Nigeria. The objectives were to examine the factors and processes influencing gully development. The data used were obtained through measurements of the parameters such as gully length, width and depth at four locations. Also examine were slope angles, relief and vegetation of the topography and mapping of the gully patterns. The data were subjected to laboratory and statistical analysis. The findings revealed that factors that influence gullying (process) along the floodplain are rainfall amount, runoff taking advantage of footpaths, wheeled-tracks and soil texture. It was also revealed that human activities such as sand mining contribute to gullying processes by influencing mass wasting processes like slumping through undermining of channel <b>banks</b> leading to <b>caving</b> as well as collapse of channels. The construction of new houses along the road due to population pressure accelerated the gullying processes. The River Ngaddabul annual floods also contribute towards gullying (processes) by deepening the channels, leading to the initiation of new gullies on the slopes. In view of these, the study recommended that drainage channel should be constructed in the gully affected areas to check the volume of runoff influencing gullying. Sand quarrying should be restricted to specific locations along the road {{in order to prevent}} further disfiguring of the Ngaddabul channel through undermining processes along the channel...|$|R
6000|$|So California and I took a steamboat, {{and upon}} a sumptuous {{blue and gold}} morning steered up the Willamette River, on which Portland stands, into the great Columbia--the river that brings the salmon {{that goes into the}} tin that is emptied into the dish when the extra guest arrives in India. California {{introduced}} me to the boat and the scenery, showed me the [...] "texas," [...] the difference between a [...] "tow-head" [...] and a [...] "sawyer," [...] and the precise nature of a [...] "slue." [...] All I remember is a delightful feeling that Mark Twain's Huckleberry Finn and Mississippi Pilot were quite true, and that I could almost recognise the very reaches down which Huck and Jim had drifted. We were on the border line between Oregon State and Washington Territory, but that didn't matter. The Columbia was the Mississippi so far as I was concerned. We ran along the sides of wooded islands whose <b>banks</b> were <b>caving</b> in with perpetual smashes, and we skipped from one side to another of the mile-wide stream in search of a channel, exactly like a Mississippi steamer, and when we wanted to pick up or set down a passenger we chose a soft and safe place on the shore and ran our very snub nose against it. California spoke to each new passenger as he came aboard and told me the man's birthplace. A long-haired tender of kine crashed out of the underwood, waved his hat, and was taken aboard forthwith. [...] "South Carolina," [...] said California, almost without looking at him. [...] "When he talks you will hear a softer dialect than mine." [...] And it befell as he said: whereat I marvelled, and California chuckled. Every island in the river carried fields of rich wheat, orchards, and a white, wooden house; or else, if the pines grew very thickly, a sawmill, the tremulous whine of whose saws flickered across the water like the drone of a tired bee. From remarks he let fall I gathered that California owned timber ships and dealt in lumber, had ranches too, a partner, and everything handsome about him; in addition to a chequered career of some thirty-five years. But he looked almost as disreputable a loafer as I.|$|R
6000|$|... "At {{so short}} a distance, and with so good a rest, I could not miss, {{and before the}} smoke cleared away I winged another, and the rest ran back hastily. I sent a shot or two among them as they were consulting, {{with the result that}} they rode off three or four hundred yards farther back. They did not attempt to return my fire, for, except when I raised my head for a moment, they could see nothing of me. They doubtless learned from the women that I had a Colt's rifle and a brace of revolvers, and that if they were to make a rush across the open not many of them were likely to reach me. After a talk two or three of them mounted their horses and rode so as to strike the river both above and below me, {{intending}} no doubt to cross if they found a place where there was a chance of doing so. I felt pretty sure that they would do nothing till it was dark, then they would crawl up and make a rush; I was certain, anyhow, that they would not give it up, as there were two of their number lying on the veldt besides the two at the farmhouse. There was, however, more pluck in them than I had given them credit for, for about mid-day they began to advance, crawling along the ground as if stalking a quarry. The men who had gone out on horseback had all returned, but just as the others started crawling up three of them galloped away down stream. I determined at once to shift my position a bit, so as to put off the evil hour. I pulled a stone as big as my head out of the clay of the bank {{and put it on the}} edge where my head had been, and then got down into the water. It was waist-deep at a couple of feet from the bank, which above was too steep to walk along. I had gone a hundred yards when I saw, seven or eight inches above the water-level, a hole, and pushing my arm in I found it was a place where a good bit of the <b>bank</b> had <b>caved</b> in. Laying my gun and pistols down on a ledge I felt about farther. At the top it went in nearly three feet, and was higher at the back than it was at the water's edge. At any rate it afforded a good chance of safety. Holding the revolvers, the chamber of the rifle, and my ammunition above water, I stooped until I could get into the hole, which was but just wide enough for the purpose; then I pushed myself back to the end. I found there was just height enough for me to sit with my mouth above water. The back sloped so that I had to dig my heels into the clay to prevent myself from slipping forward.|$|R
