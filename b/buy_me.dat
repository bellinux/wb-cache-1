500|$|British critic Leslie Halliwell {{states the}} film's {{influence}} as [...] "it {{led directly to}} all the kaleidoscopic swinging London spy thrillers and comedies of the later sixties". In particular, the visuals and storyline are credited with inspiring The Monkees' television series. The [...] "Can't <b>Buy</b> <b>Me</b> Love" [...] segment borrowed stylistically from Richard Lester's earlier The Running Jumping & Standing Still Film, {{and it is this}} segment, in particular using the contemporary technique of cutting the images to the beat of the music, which has been cited as a precursor of modern music videos. Roger Ebert goes even further, crediting Lester for a more pervasive influence, even constructing [...] "a new grammar": [...] "he influenced many other films. Today when we watch TV and see quick cutting, hand-held cameras, interviews conducted on the run with moving targets, quickly intercut snatches of dialogue, music under documentary action and all the other trademarks of the modern style, we are looking at the children of A Hard Day's Night". In an interview for the DVD re-release of A Hard Day's Night, Lester said he had been labelled the father of MTV and had jokingly responded by asking for a paternity test.|$|E
