40|$|Analysis <b>of</b> peptide <b>binding</b> {{to human}} {{neutrophils}} (PMN) using phage display techniques has revealed cell-specific motifs reactive with the PMN surface. Phage libraries display-ing either linear 9 -mer or cyclic 10 -mer and 6 -mer peptides were incubated with normal human neutrophils followed by elution of bound phage with low pH (pH 2. 2) and non-ionic detergent. Three rounds of selection generated several re-lated peptide sequences that bound with high avidity to PMN. Using the linear 9 -mer library, PMN-binding phage expressed peptides with the motif (G/A) PNLTGRW. The <b>binding</b> <b>of</b> phage <b>bearing</b> this motif was highly specific since no binding was observed on lymphocytes, fibroblasts, epithe-lial, or endothelial cells.

40|$|A new generic device {{suitable}} for the investigation of ligand-receptor interactions is presented. In particular, the research focused on optical waveguides constituted by an attenuated total internal reflection (ATR) element, transparent in the infrared and whose surfaces were activated in view <b>of</b> covalently <b>binding</b> a receptor. Silicon and germanium ATR elements were considered. The original method {{is based on the}} grafting of bifunctional spacer molecules directly at the surface of the germanium crystal, avoiding the deposition of an intermediate metal layer. The grafting <b>of</b> these <b>binding</b> molecules (under their N-hydroxysuccinimidyl ester forms) was performed either by wet chemistry or by photochemistry. The functionalized surfaces, which allow the <b>binding</b> <b>of</b> molecules <b>bearing</b> peripherical NH 2 groups, were successfully used, e. g. for the detection of proteins (streptavidin) or of small molecules (biotin).

40|$|Key {{residues}} of {{the human}} mineralocorticoid receptor (hMR) involved in the recognition of agonist and antagonist ligands were identified by alanine-scanning mutagenesis based on a homology model of the hMR ligand-binding domain. They were tested for their transactivation capacity and ability to bind agonists (aldosterone, cortisol) and antagonists (progesterone, RU 26752). The three-dimensional model reveals two polar sites located at the extremities of the elongated hydrophobic ligand-binding pocket. Mutations of Gln 776 and Arg 817 in site I reduce the affinity of hMR for both agonists and antagonists and affect the capacity of hMR to activate transcription, suggesting that the C 3 -ketone group, common to all ligands, is anchored by these two residues conserved within the nuclear steroid receptor family. In contrast, mutations of Asn 770 and Thr 945 in the opposite site only affect the <b>binding</b> <b>of</b> agonists <b>bearing</b> the C 21 -hydroxyl group. The <b>binding</b> <b>of</b> hMR antagonists that exhibit a smaller size and faster off-rate kinetics compared with agonists is not affected.

40|$|Pseudomonas aeruginosa binds {{to human}} {{respiratory}} mucins by mechanisms involving flagellar component-receptor interactions. The adhesion of P. aeruginosa strain PAK is {{mediated by the}} flagellar cap protein, FliD, without the involvement of flagellin. Two distinct types of FliD proteins {{have been identified in}} P. aeruginosa: A type, found in strain PAK, and B type, found in strain PAO 1. In the present work, studies performed with the P. aeruginosa B-type strain PAO 1 indicate that both the FliD protein and the flagellin of this strain are involved in the binding to respiratory mucins. Using polyacrylamide-based fluorescent glycoconjugates in a flow cytometry assay, it was previously demonstrated that P. aeruginosa recognizes Le(x) (or Lewis x) derivatives found at the periphery of human respiratory mucins. The aim of the present work was therefore to determine whether these carbohydrate epitopes (or glycotopes) are receptors for FliD proteins and flagellin. The results obtained by both flow cytometry and a microplate adhesion assay indicate that the FliD protein of strain PAO 1 is involved in the <b>binding</b> <b>of</b> glycoconjugates <b>bearing</b> Le(x) or sialyl-Le(x) determinants, while the <b>binding</b> <b>of</b> flagellin is restricted to the glycoconjugate bearing Le(x) glycotope. In contrast, the type A cap protein of P. aeruginosa strain PAK is not involved in the binding to glycoconjugates bearing Le(x), sialyl-Le(x), or sulfosialyl-Le(x) glycotopes.

40|$|The {{synthesis}} of four homologous anthraquinones (AQ I-IV) <b>bearing</b> increasing lengths <b>of</b> polyethylene glycol (PEG) side chains and their binding to AT- and GC-rich DNA hairpins are reported. The molecules were designed {{such that the}} cationic charge is at a constant position and the ethylene glycol units chosen to allow significant increases in size with minimal changes in hydrophobicity. The mode and affinity <b>of</b> <b>binding</b> were assessed using circular dichroism (CD), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), surface plasmon resonance (SPR), and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). The binding affinity decreased as the AQ chain length increased along the series with both AT- and GC-rich DNA. ITC measurements showed that the thermodynamic parameters <b>of</b> AQ I-IV <b>binding</b> to DNA exhibited significant enthalpy-entropy compensation. The enthalpy became more favorable while the entropy became less favorable. The correlation between enthalpy and entropy may involve not only the side chains, but also changes in the <b>binding</b> <b>of</b> water and associated counterions and hydrogen bonding. The interactions of AQ I-IV with GC-rich DNA have been studied via molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The geometry, conformation, interactions, and hydration of the complexes were examined. As the side chain lengthened, binding to DNA reduced the conformational space, resulting {{in an increase in}} unfavorable entropy. Increased localization of the PEG side chain in the DNA groove, indicating some interaction of the side chain with DNA, also contributed unfavorably to the entropy. The changes in free energy <b>of</b> <b>binding</b> due to entropic considerations (- 3. 9 to - 6. 3 kcal/mol) of AQ I-IV were significant.

40|$|Bearing is a {{key part}} of rotary machines, and its working {{condition}} is critical in normal operation of rotary machines. Vibrational signals are usually analyzed to monitor the status <b>of</b> <b>bearing.</b> However, information on the status <b>of</b> <b>bearing</b> is always buried in heavy background noise; that is, status information <b>of</b> <b>bearing</b> is weaker than the background noise. Extracting the status features <b>of</b> <b>bearing</b> from signals buried in noise is difficult. Given this, a step-varying vibrational resonance (SVVR) method based on Duffing oscillator nonlinear system is proposed to enhance the weak status feature <b>of</b> <b>bearing</b> by tuning different parameters.

40|$|HLA-B 27 subtypes {{share many}} {{structural}} features, including their pocket B, which interacts with a conserved Arg residue {{at the second}} position of B* 2705 -bound peptides. Subtypes differ among each other at other locations in the peptide binding site. In this study, metabolic labeling and radiochemical pool sequencing were used to address the following issues: (a) presence of the Arg 2 (R 2) motif among peptides bound to the various HLA-B 27 subtypes; (b) influence of mutations inside and outside pocket B on this motif; and (c) the degree of similarity among the peptide pools bound to the various B 27 subtypes. Sequencing of Arg-labeled peptide pools extracted from B* 2701 to B* 2706, and from two site-directed mutants of B* 2705 with changes outside pocket B, indicated {{that all of these}} molecules bind peptides with Arg at position 2. Peptides from several mutants with changes altering the structure of pocket B, and from one mutant at the pocket B rim, also retained the R 2 motif. However, this was absent in the peptide pool extracted from the M 45 mutant, in which the negative charge of pocket B, conferred to HLA-B 27 by Glu 45, was canceled. These results indicate that alterations outside pocket B, and even disruption of the network of hydrogen bonds that stabilizes Arg binding in pocket B, do not impair <b>binding</b> <b>of</b> peptides <b>bearing</b> the R 2 motif, but a nonconservative substitution at position 45 does. As a substantial fraction of anti-B* 2705 cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) clones crossreact with the M 45 mutant (Villadangos, J., B. Galocha, D. Lopez, V. Calvo, and J. A. Lopez de Castro. 1992. J.

Metabolic labeling with various other amino acids and radiochemical sequencing revealed similarities, but also substantial differences, among the peptide pools from the various HLA-B 27 subtypes. This strongly suggests that many peptides bind to multiple subtypes, but significant subsets of peptides bound to a given HLA-B 27 subtype do not bind to other subtypes or do so with greatly altered efficiency.

In the conclusion, the results are summarized for the selected types <b>of</b> <b>bearings.</b> The results shows that behavior <b>of</b> the <b>bearings</b> is not always be as envisaged by standard, particularly in terms of bending moment loading...|$|R

40|$|Purpose. Lack of {{kinematics}} {{models and}} imperfection {{of the known}} dynamics models <b>of</b> the roller <b>bearings</b> <b>of</b> railway rolling stock axle-boxes do not allow designing the optimal structure <b>of</b> <b>bearing</b> cages, providing the required service life and reliability <b>of</b> <b>bearing</b> units <b>of</b> wheel sets for cars and locomotives. The studies of kinematics and dynamics <b>of</b> roller <b>bearings</b> <b>of</b> axle boxes for cars and locomotives and modeling of their parts interaction to create the analytical method <b>of</b> <b>bearing</b> cages calculation are necessary. Methodology. This purpose has been achieved due to the modeling of kinematics of the ideal (without gaps) and real (taking account the gaps, manufacturing and installation errors) <b>bearings,</b> substantiation <b>of</b> the transfer mechanism of motion from the rollers to bearing cage, modeling the dynamics of rolling, research of interaction forces of the rollers with bearing cage. Findings. It is established that the kinematics <b>of</b> ideal <b>bearing</b> {{is determined by the}} contact deformations of the rollers and rings, when the kinematics <b>of</b> real <b>bearing</b> depends mainly on the side gaps in the windows <b>of</b> the <b>bearing</b> cage. On the basis of studies <b>of</b> the real <b>bearing</b> kinematics the dynamics models of the rollers and bearing cage interaction were constructed. The conducted studies of kinematics and dynamics <b>of</b> rolling <b>bearings</b> have changed our view of them as of the planetary mechanism, explained the reason <b>of</b> <b>bearing</b> cage loading, and confirmed the possibility of destruction during operation. Originality. It was first proposed a mechanism for motion transfer from the rollers to the <b>bearing</b> cage <b>of</b> roller <b>bearings,</b> consisting in that the side gap in the bearing cage window is reduced gradually multiple of the number of rollers of radial loading area according to the bearing cage motion. The models <b>of</b> roller <b>bearing</b> dynamics, which allow calculating the interaction forces of parts for all modes of operation, were improved. Practical value. Use of the offered models of kinematics and dynamics <b>of</b> the roller <b>bearings</b> will develop analytical calculation method <b>of</b> the <b>bearing</b> cage for the choice of its optimal design according to criterion of maximum service life and reliability <b>of</b> the <b>bearing</b> unit <b>of</b> wheel sets of the railway rolling stock...|$|R
