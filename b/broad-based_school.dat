40|$|Drawing on data {{collected}} {{for a larger}} study of second language learner characteristics at the Trinity College Dublin (Ireland), a profile of freshmen taking introductory Spanish in 1990 - 91 is reported. Subjects were 21 students, 20 female and 1 male. Most were of traditional college age, and a few were in their 30 s. Almost half had previous Spanish language instruction. Most were also studying another language. Students had a relatively <b>broad-based</b> <b>school</b> education, often concentrating on and doing well in languages and language-related subject areas. The students perceived Spanish as suiting a range of interests, utilitarian, cultural, and other. Most had begun language study after age 10 and in formal instruction, and none had found it difficult. Elements of language learning found congenial included particular kinds of learning materials and classroom activities, and contributions of native speakers and language teachers. Age at which the students had begun formal language instruction (under 12 and over 12 years) {{was not related to}} students ' later success, but meaningful interaction did appear related to success. Attitudes toward grammar instruction and toward interactions with native speakers also influenced success. A brief bibliography is included.

40|$|Original title: Voortgezet onderwijs in de jaren negentig. Many {{changes and}} {{innovations}} {{have been set}} in motion in Dutch secondary education in recent years: the introduction of basic secondary education, increases in scale, profiles and the 'house of study' {{in the second phase}} of senior general secondary and pre-university education, new programmes for pre-vocational secondary education and a new pupil care structure. All these changes have created a great deal of unrest in the education system, and have also generated a large amount of discussion in political circles and in the media. This publication first looks at the different problems and considerations which underlay all these innovations. The current status and experiences gained to date are also reviewed. The central focus is on the effects at pupil level. Are pupils in large, <b>broad-based</b> <b>school</b> communities more negative about their school and their education than pupils in small, specialist schools? Do they benefit from a school which combines different school types, or do they see this as a disadvantage? To what extent have school transfer patterns changed {{as a result of the}} different policy interventions? Has there been a decrease or an increase in the inequality of opportunity in secondary education in recent years? The report provides answers to questions such as these. It also looks at the extent to which the problems that led to the innovations in the early 1990 s have eased since then. Based on the findings, a number of suggestions are made for reappraisal and adaptation. The purpose of the report is to engender a discussion on this...|$|E

40|$|We {{construct}} a new dataset of inequality in educational attainment {{by age and}} sex at the global level. The comparison of education inequality measures across age groups allows us to assess the effect of inter-generational education attainment trends on economic growth. Our results indicate that countries which are able to reduce the inequality of educational attainment of young cohorts over time tend to have higher growth rates of income per capita. This effect is additional to that implied by the accumulation of human capital and implies that policies aiming at providing <b>broad-based</b> access to <b>schooling</b> have returns {{in terms of economic}} growth that go beyond those achieved by increasing average educational attainment.

40|$|We {{studied the}} local {{manifestation of a}} {{national}} procedural program that addressed problems regarding employment, education, housing and the physical neighborhood environment, social cohesion, and safety in the most deprived neighborhoods in the Netherlands. We aimed to assess if such a program, without the explicit aim to improve health, results in area-based interventions that address the social determinants of health {{to such an extent}} that future health impacts may be expected. We used standardized questionnaires and face-to-face interviews with 39 local district managers. We analyzed the content of the area-based interventions to assess if the activities addressed the social determinants of health. We assessed the duration and scale of the activities in order to estimate their potential to change social determinants of health. Most districts addressed all six categories of social determinants of health central to the procedural program. Investments in <b>broad-based</b> primary <b>schools,</b> housing stock, green space, and social safety seemed to have the potential to result in district-level changes in social determinants. The scale of activities aimed at employment, income, educational attainment, and the social environment seemed too small to expect an impact at the district level. We conclude that the area-based interventions addressed the neighborhood environment {{to such an extent that}} future health impacts of the Dutch District Approach may be expected. The health effects in the long term might be more substantial when area-based interventions were devoted more to the improvement of the socioeconomic circumstances of resident...|$|R
40|$|Teacher {{research}} {{represents a}} broad and very live topic {{not only in the}} field of mathematics education. But what is meant by teacher research? In (Anderson & Herr, 1999), the following characterisation is given: “By practitioner 2 research we refer to a <b>broad-based</b> movement among <b>school</b> professionals to legitimate knowledge produced out of their own lived realities as professionals. This includes an ongoing struggle to articulate an epistemology of practice that includes experiences with reflective practice, action research, teacher study groups, and teacher narratives”. The role and status of teacher research is an object of sharp and vivid debate not only in the field of mathematics education – see for example (Anderson, 2002), (Metz & Page, 2002). Breen (2003) presents the contrasting views on the contributions that teachers are making to the field of mathematics education: “On the one hand, there is a growing movement for more teachers to become involved in a critical exploration of their practice through such methods as critical reflection, action research, and lesson studies. The contrasting position makes the claim that thes...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the struggle for}} school desegregation in Philadelphia from 1945 – 1967. Although the school desegregation movements in the northern cities of Chicago and New York have been researched, {{there has been no}} study of Philadelphia 2 ̆ 7 s movement. Standard historical methods including the researching of primary and secondary sources supplemented by interviews of such key participants as A. Leon Higginbotham Jr. were applied in gathering data. Although the author expected to find a <b>broad-based,</b> well-organized <b>school</b> desegregation movement supported by a vocal African American community, such was not the case. Working class and poor Blacks became involved in actions at local schools but not at the citywide level. Instead, the African American and white liberal middle class seemed to be the main supporters of school desegregation. Beginning in 1963 a large section of this group worked together in the Coordinating Council for School Integration. Tactically, they pursued desegregation through socially acceptable avenues of dissent. The civic leaders who supported school desegregation were somewhat peripheral to city politics. No key office holders or business leaders proclaimed strong support for school desegregation. Instead, the mayor and the city council president spoke out against busing to relieve overcrowding. Opposition to this busing arose in all of the predominantly white sections of the city. In an atmosphere electrified by racial awareness, the school district responded to a federal judge 2 ̆ 7 s order to draw up a desegregation plan by studying the question, taking minor desegregation steps and instituting compensatory educational programs rather than desegregating the schools. Thus, the political and racial politics in the school system, the city and the nation were decisive for school integration. Philadelphia did not stand alone in its failure to desegregate its schools. Neither New York nor Chicago desegregated their schools. It seems that only under the mandate of federal law would these northern urban school systems have been desegregated. ...|$|R
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Technical Vocational Education and Training (TVET) in Fiji is {{undergoing}} major reforms. This study {{looks at the}} new climate of TVET in Fiji where the current government has given {{the green light to}} a new platform of TVET initiatives. This includes the newly formed Fiji National University that gives equal status to traditional and new technological professions. At the same time a <b>broad-based</b> secondary <b>school</b> curriculum with both academic and TVET subjects has been introduced. However, community acceptance of reinvented TVET has been very slow. This study is a response to this apparent lack of acceptance from the community. It focuses on the perceptions and attitudes towards TVET of students in junior secondary school. It also examines current discourses expressed about TVET by key stakeholders in the Fijian education system, including pupils, parents, teachers, education officers and the Minister for Education. Quantitative and qualitative methods were used during the fieldwork process to gather data from four case study schools from parts of Fiji, and from education stakeholders. The four theories guiding this study are: Constructivism, Social Reproduction, Post-Colonial Theory and Sociology of Knowledge. This study found that there is a mismatch between growth-oriented labour force needs and skilled capacities gained through education. Furthermore, a significant finding related to the conditions that give rise to the habitus is that inequalities in terms of career opportunities and aspirations are reproduced by the education system especially for children from large, poor families and those who live with relatives. Through efforts to work effectively with ‘grass-roots’ Fijian community members this study developed a new culturally appropriate methodology of ‘veivosaki-yaga’ during the focus group interviews. This study found competing viewpoints between stakeholders and between the different ways various groups of people currently understand TVET. Analysis of this contradictory data produced a discourse hierarchy and classification model which succinctly illustrates how TVET in Fiji is defined and understood differently by different stakeholders. This hierarchal model suggests possible reasons why there has been no consistent support for, and implementation of, TVET in Fiji. While there was consensus among high profile stakeholders that TVET has the potential to help Fiji meet its MDGs as well as its other developmental objectives, among ‘grass-roots’ stakeholders there was no such optimism or idealism. In Fiji TVET has a generally negative perception in the community. In part {{this may be due to}} the diverse discourses that exist between major stakeholders such as senior government officials, teachers, parents and students. People at the top of the hierarchy associate TVET with highly paid professions and trades, whereas those at the lower levels of the hierarchy consider TVET to be second-class education leading to low status, low wage-earning, labour intensive jobs. Finally this study proposes a name and identity transformation from TVET to CTP – Career Training and Placement - to fulfill the vision and transformative discourse of major stakeholders and to eventually change the perceptions of the community about vocational education. CTP has the potential to be an inclusive innovative programme that aligns school subjects with career placement so that there is smoother transition between school and work for students in Fiji. In such a programme, school subjects and post-school training formerly viewed negatively as ‘TVET’ take their rightful place in the range of career-oriented study options available to junior secondary pupils and their families...|$|R
