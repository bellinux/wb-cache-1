40|$|The {{removal of}} iron {{impurities}} to desired regions in silicon wafers {{has been studied}} using phosphorus and boron doped layers and <b>bulk</b> defects as <b>gettering</b> sites. Techniques to remove metal impurities, so-called gettering techniques, are needed for improving the performance of both the microelectronic and photovoltaic silicon devices, although the desired location of impurities may be different in various applications. In this work, both separate and simultaneous influences of the doped layers and bulk defects on the gettering behaviour of iron, e. g. the gettering efficiency and gettering mechanisms, were investigated. The phosphorus diffusion gettering studies at low temperatures enabled the determination of a more accurate segregation coefficient for iron between a phosphorus diffused layer and bulk silicon. Comparison between the phosphorus diffusion gettering experiments and similar experiments with boron showed that boron diffusion gettering can in some cases be nearly {{as effective as the}} phosphorus diffusion gettering. The gettering studies with implanted boron layers revealed that the gettering occurs also by precipitation, not only by segregation. Competitive gettering between an implanted boron layer and bulk defects was investigated using specially designed gettering anneals. It was found that depending on the desired location of iron in silicon wafers in different applications, iron can be collected either to the doped layers or the <b>bulk</b> defects. The <b>gettering</b> anneals were also applied to a microelectronic device process and their effect on the electronic device parameters was evaluated. These results contribute to the understanding of iron behaviour in silicon. Thus, they can help when designing the gettering anneals both for microelectronic and photovoltaic fabrication processes...|$|R
40|$|Existing {{analyses}} of the pulsed response of an MOS capacitor for minority-carrier lifetime determination result in a lifetime value averaged {{over most of the}} depletion region width. In this report, an analysis of MOS C-t data is presented that enables minority-carrier generation lifetime to be plotted as a function of depletion region depth. The technique is shown to be useful for samples with bulk or buried interfacial layer defects that have defect-free surfaces. Data are presented for intrinsically <b>gettered</b> <b>bulk</b> crystals and extrinsically gettered Si(2 -pct Ge) epitaxial layers with misfit dislocations. In addition, for samples that do have uniform lifetimes, the measurement time required for determining carrier lifetime has been reduced by more than an order of magnitude...|$|R

For this study, several getters are deposited and analyzed {{in terms of}} sorption performances, microstructure and activation mechanism. Compared to single layer evaporated titanium reference, {{the addition of a}} sub-layer is shown to decrease the activation temperature of the NEG. Effective pumping of nitrogen is monitored by Residual Gas Analysis (RGA). Microstructure investigation by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) reveals no apparent modification in NEG morphology due to sub-layer addition. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) and depth profiling monitoring of NEG activation under high vacuum conditions (10 − 8  mbar) shows the dissolution of the NEG surface oxide in the <b>getter</b> <b>bulk,</b> along with the formation of carbide and nitride compounds.

40|$|Plasma-enhanced {{chemical}} vapor deposition (PECVD) is a cost-effective, performance-enhancing {{technique that}} can provide surface passivation and produce an effective antireflection coating layer at the same time. To gain the full benefit from improved emitter surface passivation on cell performance, {{it is necessary to}} tailor the emitter doping profile so that the emitter is lightly doped between the gridlines, but heavily doped under them. This selectively patterned emitter doping profile has historically been obtained by using expensive photolithographic or screen-printed alignment techniques and multiple high-temperature diffusion steps. We built on a self-aligned emitter etchback technique first described by Spectrolab. We included PECVD-nitride deposition because the low- recombination emitter produced by the etchback requires good surface passivation for improved cell performance. The nitride also provides a good antireflection coating. We studied whether plasma-etching techniques can use standard screen-printed gridlines at etch masks to form self-aligned, patterned-emitter profiles on multicrystalline (MC-Si) cells from Solarex Corp. This investigation determined that reactive ion etching (RIE) is compatible with using standard, commercial, screen printed gridlines as etch masks to form self- aligned, selectively-doped emitter profiles. This process results in reduced gridline contact resistance when followed by PECVD treatments, an undamaged emitter surface easily passivated by plasma-nitride, and a less heavily doped emitter between gridlines for reduced emitter recombination. This allows for heavier doping beneath the gridlines for even lower contact resistance, reduced contact recombination, and better <b>bulk</b> defect <b>gettering.</b> Our results found improvement of half a percentage point in cell efficiency when the self-aligned emitter etchback was combined with the PECVD-nitride surface passivation treatment...|$|R
30|$|Due to {{the high}} price of fossil energy source and huge {{pollution}} of environmental issue, in the recent years, the development of renewable energy has regained our attention. The development of the solar energy industry {{is one of the most}} popular technologies in renewable energy. The majority of solar cells are made from crystalline silicon; more than half of the crystalline silicon solar cell production is based on multicrystalline silicon (mc-Si). The quality of multicrystalline silicon (mc-Si) wafers may become worse in the future for several reasons; the main reason is that lower-quality feedstock will probably be used for cost reduction and availability reasons [1]. Improving conversion efficiency using a low-cost material development is the main research activity in the photovoltaic field [2, 3]. Several experiments demonstrated that the electrical properties of crystalline silicon solar cells can be improved by coating the n[*]+[*]emitter region with a porous silicon layer [2 – 5], and many technologies have been used for this purpose [6 – 8], such as using vanadium oxide as an antireflection coating [9]. The possibility of improving the electrical properties of silicon wafers, by extracting impurities from them, using thermal treatment under oxygen atmosphere, or phosphorus diffusion, is well known [10 – 13]. Besides, the porous silicon (PS) layer may be used as an efficient sacrificial layer for gettering metallic impurities [11, 14]. There are two general classifications of gettering, namely extrinsic and intrinsic. Extrinsic gettering refers to gettering that employs external means to create the damage or stress in the silicon lattice in such a way that extended defects needed for trapping impurities are formed. These chemically reactive trapping sites are usually located at the wafer surfaces, away from the <b>bulk.</b> Intrinsic <b>gettering</b> is using oxygen to enforce precipitation of metallic impurities, such as copper, not at the wafer surface but in its bulk. A preparatory step in this case is a thermal treatment causing precipitation of the excess oxygen which, for a variety of reasons related to the specific properties of oxygen in silicon, forms oxygen precipitates in the bulk of the wafer rather than at its surface. Those oxygen precipitates then act as gettering sites for metallic impurities. PS may also be used as an excellent antireflective coating or as a passivating layer on the emitter of crystalline silicon [15]. Most often, the formation of PS can create defects in the surface of the Si substrate that may enhance the gettering effect as extrinsic gettering effect. A phosphorus gettering model was proposed [16], which stated that the gettering speed is controlled by two steps. The first step is to limit the gettering temperature by releasing diffusion of metal impurities, and the second step is to control the best gettering temperature by the segregation function. Other authors [17] proposed that silicon self-interstitial current generated during phosphorus (P) diffusion is an essential factor of the gettering mechanism, and also found that Fermi level-enhanced solubility in the P diffused layer contributes to the gettering effect. The use of an infrared (IR) furnace for the fabrication of p-n junction [18, 19] and gettering impurity through the porous silicon layer [20] is one of the processes that may be used to reach this goal. In this work, we will investigate the increase of carrier lifetime and the conversion efficiency of multicrystalline silicon solar cells gettered by a phosphorous gettering process using a sacrificial porous silicon layer in which the impurities will be trapped.|$|R
