5|$|Under the {{influence}} of C. S. Peirce and William James, Putnam also <b>became</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> there is no fact–value dichotomy; that is, normative (e.g., ethical and aesthetic) judgments often have a factual basis, while scientific judgments have a normative element.|$|E
5|$|In February 1777 while encamped at Morristown, New Jersey, Washington <b>became</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> only {{smallpox}} inoculation by variolation {{would prevent}} the destruction of his Army. He ordered the inoculation of all troops and, by some reports, death by smallpox in the ranks dropped from 17% of all deaths to 1% of all deaths.|$|E
5|$|Upon reading Pike's journal, Hill <b>became</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> the Kansas site {{could not}} be the correct one. To him, the local {{topography}} {{did not appear to}} match that described by Pike; and when he attempted to retrace Pike's route, he concluded that the actual village site must be some distance northwest of the Kansas monument.|$|E

5|$|A {{few years}} after being married, Anne Dallas Dudley became {{involved}} in the temperance movement as a supporter of alcohol prohibition. Through her work in the temperance movement and her association with friends such as Maria Daviess and Ida Clyde Clark, Dudley <b>became</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> women's place in society could only be improved if women were allowed to vote. At the time, however, a majority of men and women opposed the idea of women participating in the political process.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the First World War, the Austro-Hungarian Navy's U-boat fleet consisted of six largely experimental submarines of three classes. The Navy had five larger, more modern submarines (what would have been the U-7 class) under construction in Germany at the outbreak of war, but when the Navy <b>became</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> delivery of the U-7 boats would be impossible, they were sold to Germany in November 1914.|$|E
5|$|Beilhart {{left his}} brother-in-law's home {{a year later}} and went {{to live and work}} on a sheep farm. The family he lived with were devout Seventh Day Adventists. During this time, he <b>became</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> their view of the Bible and its teachings were quite {{different}} than what he had been raised to understand, but he accepted their religion entirely.|$|E

5|$|Bohr <b>became</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> light {{behaved like}} both waves and particles, and in 1927, {{experiments}} confirmed the de Broglie hypothesis that matter (like electrons) also behaved like waves. He conceived the philosophical principle of complementarity: that items could have apparently mutually exclusive properties, {{such as being}} a wave or a stream of particles, depending on the experimental framework. He {{felt that it was}} not fully understood by professional philosophers.|$|E
5|$|By July 1808, Breckinridge {{had decided}} to return to Princeton in October to finish his studies. His roommate, James G. Birney, and the {{university}} president, Samuel Stanhope Smith, were both ardent abolitionists, and through their influence, he <b>became</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> slavery must be ended, but only by voluntary emancipation, not by government interference. He completed his bachelor's degree in 1810.|$|E
5|$|In 1935 he {{returned}} to Germany {{as a member of}} the International Force supervising the Saarland plebiscite. Afterwards, he joined the German Intelligence Section at the War Office. In 1937 he became Assistant Military attaché in Berlin to Noel Mason-Macfarlane. As such, Strong got to know many senior German military officers personally, including Wilhelm Keitel. Like Mason-Macfarlane, he <b>became</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> war with Germany was imminent and inevitable.|$|E
40|$|We could <b>become</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> a {{particular}} theory of very-high-energy physics is correct if (1) {{it has a}} tightly constrained structure and is linked strongly enough with observed particle interactions, or (2) it predicts new physics beyond the standard model which is discovered. The author makes the case that experiments of this decade and the next allow the possibility <b>that</b> we might <b>become</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> grand unification, a candidate theory of the second type, is correct...|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} to Lee, the police arrested {{a friend of}} Phagan's for the crime. Gradually, the police <b>became</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> these were not the culprits. By Monday, the police had theorized that the murder occurred {{on the second floor}} (the same as Frank's office) based on hair found on a lathe and what appeared to be blood on the ground of the second floor.|$|E
5|$|Instead {{of being}} sobered by their 3,000 casualties, Archduke John {{and his staff}} <b>became</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> the enemy was on the run. The Austrian general ordered a pursuit of the French through forested terrain. But, instead of fleeing, Moreau and his troops {{were waiting for the}} Austrians. The two armies met in the decisive Battle of Hohenlinden two days later.|$|E
5|$|Neither U-10 {{nor any of}} {{her sister}} boats were {{complete}} when World War I began in August 1914. With the boats under construction at Kiel, the Austrians <b>became</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> {{it would be impossible}} to take delivery of the boats, which would need to be towed into the Mediterranean past Gibraltar, a British territory. As a result, U-10 and her four sisters were sold to the Imperial German Navy on 28 November 1914.|$|E

5|$|On 9 June, General Jean Lannes beat Feldmarschallleutnant Peter Ott in the Battle of Montebello. This caused Bonaparte {{to become}} overconfident. He <b>became</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> Melas would not attack, and further, that the Austrian {{was about to}} retreat. As other French forces closed from the west and south, the Austrian {{commander}} had withdrawn most of his troops from their positions near Nice and Genoa to Alessandria on the main Turin-Mantua road.|$|E
5|$|After half an hour's play Lycett Green {{once again}} <b>became</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> Gordon-Cumming was cheating. He left {{the table and}} sent a note to his mother-in-law—still at the table—recounting his suspicions: she took no action. By the time the game was {{finished}} Mary Wilson, the two Lycett Greens and Stanley Wilson—all {{of whom had been}} watching Gordon-Cumming closely—were convinced that he had been cheating, although they differed in their versions of what they saw. Others saw nothing, including people sitting closer to him, such as the prince, Lady Coventry (sitting next to Gordon-Cumming) and Levett (sitting opposite him). Over the two nights' play Gordon-Cumming won a total of £225.|$|E
5|$|As I {{was reading}} about Cope and Marsh, I ran across Knight as {{something}} of a bit player in their lives. As I got further into the Cope and Marsh story, and I liked the two less and less as people—which is different from liking them as characters, of course—I wanted to have a character in the book for the readers to root for, and neither of the scientists could fill that role. When I found out that Knight had met Cope just before Cope died, I <b>became</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> he was the character I needed.|$|E

5|$|At the 1928 {{election}} Bruce's {{government was}} returned to power, but it now had a majority of just nine a fragile result, given the growing propensity for Nationalist member defections. Most of the Nationalists' parliamentary gains from 1925 had been wiped out. James Scullin had assumed {{the leadership of the}} ALP earlier in the year, upon the retirement of Charlton, and the party was invigorated as a consequence. Bruce was undeterred, though, and <b>became</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> unless costs of production for industry in Australia could be lowered and industrial peace secured, Australia was heading towards a major economic crisis. This doctrine was the basis of his appeals to the public for the next year and a half.|$|E
5|$|Corder's {{skeleton}} was put {{on display}} in a glass case in the West Suffolk Hospital, and apparently was rigged with a mechanism that made its arm point to the collection box when approached. Eventually, the skull was removed by Dr John Kilner, who wanted to add it to his extensive collection of Red Barn memorabilia. After a series of unfortunate events, he <b>became</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> the skull was cursed and handed it on to a friend named Hopkins. Further disasters plagued both men, and they finally paid for the skull {{to be given a}} Christian burial in an attempt to lift the supposed curse.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Lamberti of Bari had {{suggested}} to Goheen in 1976 that Primitivo {{might be the}} Croatian variety Plavac Mali. By 1982 Goheen had confirmed that they were similar but not identical, probably by isozyme analysis. Some Croatians, however, <b>became</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> Plavac Mali {{was the same as}} Zinfandel, among them Croatian-born winemaker Mike Grgich. In 1991 Grgich and other producers came together as the Zinfandel Advocates and Producers (ZAP) with the objectives of promoting the varietal and wine, and supporting scientific research on Zinfandel. With this support, UCD professor Carole Meredith went to Croatia and collected over 150 samples of Plavac Mali throughout Dalmatia, in collaboration with the University of Zagreb.|$|E
