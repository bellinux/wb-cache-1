Development {{and characteristics}} of <b>mechanically</b> <b>despun</b> spacecraft antenna for deep space probes, tactical communications, and community broadcast applications. Mode of access: Internet...|$|R
50|$|ATS-3 {{experiments}} included VHF and C-band communications, a color spin-scan camera (principally {{developed by}} Verner E. Suomi), an image dissector camera, a <b>mechanically</b> <b>despun</b> antenna, resistojet thrusters, hydrazine propulsion, optical surface experiments, and {{the measurement of}} the electron content of the ionosphere and magnetosphere.|$|R
50|$|The main {{objective}} of the mission was to take UV images of the hydrogen corona for about 30 days before and after Comet Halley's descending crossing of the ecliptic plane. Solar wind parameters were measured for a much longer time period. The spacecraft is spin-stabilized at two different rates (5 and 0.2 rpm). Hydrazine thrusters are used for attitude and velocity control; star and sun sensors are for attitude control; and a <b>mechanically</b> <b>despun</b> off-set parabolic dish is used for long range communication.|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} and performance is described of a high-gain antenna designed {{to serve on}} the Pioneer Venus Orbiter spacecraft as a backup to the principal high-gain antenna unit in the unlikely event the <b>mechanically</b> <b>despun</b> antenna mechanism malfunctioned. The final design, a center-fed standing wave array of six sleeve dipoles enclosed in a fiber glass radome, performed successfully, as did all the antennas, on the Pioneer Orbiter spacecraft which was launched on May 20, 1978, as part of the Pioneer Venus mission. Photographs of experimental models giving details of design and construction are included, as well as graphs showing measured pattern and impedance matching characteristics of the subject antenna...|$|R
40|$|The orbit {{profile for}} the Atmosphere Explorer {{requires}} a velocity adjust capability of 2000 ft/sec/sec and individual maneuvers {{of up to}} 24 ft/sec in magnitude. This requirement is met by a monopropellant hydrazine propulsion subsystem which also provides, {{by virtue of the}} tank arrangement, a means of adjusting the spacecraft center of mass in orbit, thereby minimizing external disturbance torques. The attitude control subsystem is of the momentum bias type. A large internal flywheel furnishes gyroscopic stiffness and permits rapid changes in operating mode (<b>despun</b> <b>to</b> spinning mode) by controlled interchange of momentum between the flywheel and the spacecraft main body...|$|R
