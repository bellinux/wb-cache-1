The proposal to build the new highway was mooted as a result of the severe congestion along the Federal Route 1. Because of the financially massive scale of the project, the highway was planned to be privatised and tolled, but none of the constructors being invited by {{the government}} were willing to do the job due to economic uncertainties at that time and the plan could not be materialised. It was only after Tun Dr. Mahathir Mohamad became the Prime Minister that the North-South Expressway project was revived. The North-South Expressway was launched in 1981, where the Jitra-Bukit Kayu Hitam section was constructed as an upgrade of the existing Federal Route 1 section into a divided highway with partial access control and at-grade intersections. At that time, the construction of the Kuala Lumpur-Seremban Expressway E2 was still ongoing, and therefore the expressway would later form the pioneer route for the southern route. Unlike the other sections of the North-South Expressway, the Jitra-Bukit Kayu Hitam section did not comply with the expressway standards defined by the Arahan Teknik 8/86: A Guide on Geometric Design of Roads which was only published by the Malaysian Public Works Department (JKR) later in 1986, resulting the section to be grandfathered as a part of the North-South Expressway E1.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the definition {{and evaluation of}} a new protocol for providing a wireless sensor network (WSN) with a hierarchical organization. Differently from previously proposed solutions, our protocol, termed CC ("double c," for clique clustering), includes in its operation a fail-safe mechanism for dealing with node failure or removal, which are typical of WSNs. More specifically, the network is partitioned into clusters that are cliques, i. e., nodes in each clusters are directly connected to each others. An efficient mechanism for building a connected backbone among the clique clusters is provided. Clustering, backbone formation and backbone maintenance are completely localized, in the precise sense that only nodes physically close to a failing node {{are involved in the}} reconfiguration process. We compare the performance of CC with that of DMAC, a protocol that has been previously proposed for building and maintaining clusters and backbones in presence of node removal. Our comparison concerns metrics that are central to WSN research, such as time for clustering and backbone reorganization, corresponding overhead (in bytes and transmission energy), backbone size, extent of the reorganization (i. e., the number of nodes involved in it), and <b>backbone</b> <b>route</b> length.

40|$|We {{present the}} {{definition}} and performance {{evaluation of a}} protocol for building and maintaining a connected backbone among the nodes of a wireless sensor networks (WSN). Building backbones first, and then coping with network dynamics is typical of protocols for backbone formation. Rules for building the backbone, however, do {{not take into account}} the following network dynamics explicitly. This makes maintaining a connected backbone quite costly, especially in terms of reorganization time, overhead and energy consumption. Our protocol includes in the backbone forming operations a fail-safe mechanism for dealing with the addition and the removal of nodes, which are typical events in a WSN. More specifically, the network is kept partitioned into clusters that are cliques, i. e., nodes in each cluster are directly connected to each others. Therefore, removing a node does not disrupt a cluster, and adding one requires simple operations for checking node admission to the cluster. The protocol, termed CC ("double C", for clique clustering), comprises three phases, each designed to render the operations of the others swift and efficient. The first phase partitions the network into clusters that are cliques. Clusters are then joined to form a backbone that is provably connected. Finally, the third, more on-line phase, maintains the backbone connected in face of node additions and removals. We compare the performance of CC with that of DMAC, a protocol that has been previously proposed for building and maintaining clusters and backbones in presence of network dynamics. Our comparison concerns metrics that are central to WSN research, such as time for clustering and backbone reorganization, corresponding overhead, extent of the reorganization (i. e., number of nodes involved in it), and properties of the resulting backbone, such as its size, <b>backbone</b> <b>route</b> length, number of gateways and nodes per cluster.

We are interested in the minimum Connected Vertex Cover problem, a generalization of the classical minimum Vertex Cover problem, which allows to obtain a connected backbone. Recently, Delbot et al.

In this paper, we propose a distributed and self-stabilizing version of their algorithm with the same approximation guarantee. To the best knowledge of the authors, it is the first distributed and fault-tolerant algorithm for this problem.
