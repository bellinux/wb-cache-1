5|$|Mississippi based Grapico <b>Bottling</b> Company {{troubles}} did not {{end with}} its union problems. In September 1924, John Henry Ennis of Ellisville, Mississippi purchased a Grapico. On drinking it, Ennis discovered that the contents were filled with flies, some of which he swallowed and became sick. On filing a lawsuit against Grapico <b>Bottling</b> Company and its sole stockholder, Philip Carriere, Ennis learned that Grapico <b>Bottling</b> Company had filed for and successfully dissolved itself as a corporation between the time Ennis consumed the flies and filed suit against Grapico <b>Bottling.</b> On appeal, the Supreme Court of Mississippi issued an opinion that serve as precedent in Mississippi for the rule that a stockholder of a corporation is not liable for the debts, liabilities, and other acts of the corporation. After Grapico <b>Bottling</b> Company (Mississippi) dissolved in 1925, Rochell's Grapico <b>Bottling</b> Works became the sole supplier of Grapico to Mississippi.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to experiencing taxes {{as a result}} of its success, the Grapico efforts found labor troubles. In 1920, the International Union of United Brewery, Flour, Cereal, Soft Drink and Distillery Workers presented Grapico <b>Bottling</b> Company (Mississippi) with a union agreement. When the company refused to sign the agreement, the 112 employees at Grapico <b>Bottling</b> Company were called to strike. The Grapico <b>Bottling</b> Co. eventually signed the agreement.|$|E

5|$|By 1919, Grapico {{manufacturer}} J.

5|$|Malvern {{water has}} been bottled and {{distributed}} in the UK and abroad from {{as early as the}} reign of James I, with water <b>bottling</b> at the Holy Well being recorded in 1622. Various local grocers have bottled and distributed Malvern water during the 19th and early 20th centuries, but it was first bottled on a large commercial scale by Schweppes, who opened a <b>bottling</b> plant at Holywell in Malvern Wells in 1850. As official caterers to the Great Exhibition of 1851, Schweppes introduced the water as Malvern Soda, later renaming it Malvern Seltzer Water in 1856. In 1890 Schweppes moved away from Holywell, entered into a contract with a Colwall family, and built a <b>bottling</b> plant in the village in 1892. The Holywell was subsequently leased to John and Henry Cuff, who bottled there until the 1960s. The Holywell became derelict until 2009 when {{with the aid of a}} Lottery Heritage grant, production of 1200 bottles per day of Holywell Spring Water was recommenced by an independent family-owned company. The well is believed to be the oldest <b>bottling</b> plant in the world.|$|E
5|$|Rochell's early Grapico {{efforts were}} not without problems. For example, in November 1921, Grapico <b>Bottling</b> Works {{acquired}} a US$648 Baltimore Semi-Automatic Machine, Model B-1485 from New Orleans based Crown Cork and Seal Co. to cork and seal soda water bottles. Within three months, the bottle capper began to fail. Frequently, {{the neck of}} the moving bottles became stuck in the machine, which additionally broke bottles whose contents drenched workers. In addition, the caps made by the machine did not seal properly so that carbonation gas escaped from the Grapico bottles. After Grapico refused to pay the US$358 balance, the Sheriff seized the <b>bottling</b> machine from Grapico. The matter was resolved 3½ years later by the Louisiana First Circuit Court of Appeal, who set aside the machine sales contract so that Grapico <b>Bottling</b> Works no longer owed the balance.|$|E

5|$|In 1927, Schweppes {{acquired}} from the Burrows family Pewtress Spring, in Colwall, {{on the western}} side of the Herefordshire Beacon, approximately two miles from Colwall village. The source here emerges at the fault line between the Silurian thrust and the Precambrian diorite and granite above it. The spring was renamed Primeswell Spring, and in 1929 Schweppes commenced <b>bottling.</b> The factory employed 25 people who filled 26 million bottles annually. It was operated by Coca-Cola Enterprises Ltd., and the water was sold under the Schweppes brand name. On 20 October 2010 Coca-Cola Enterprises, who owned the Malvern brand, announced that production would be ceasing as of 3 November 2010. This decision, which was widely criticised both in the town and beyond, was due to the declining market share Malvern has on the overall water market.

5|$|O'Brien {{intended}} the brewery to be a modern facility {{similar to those}} in California, and brought in Charles Bolbrugge, a brewer from San Francisco, to run the operation. The facility probably took the form of a tower brewery, which minimised the requirements for power supplies, and had a cooperage built adjacent to it. Some of the equipment was probably reused from the local Eldorado <b>Bottling</b> works, which had closed three years before, and possibly the old Dawson City Brewery, which was then combined with up-to-date steam pumps, <b>bottling</b> machines and an artificial refrigeration plant. A variety of second-hand bottles were probably collected from around Dawson City, many of which were then reused at the new brewery, the remainder being discarded along the nearby river shore. The malt and hops for the brewing process were imported from California.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of these experiments {{was to provide}} benchmark data to validate calculational codes used in critically safety assessments of plant configurations. Arrays containing up {{to as many as}} sixteen three-liter <b>bottles</b> filled with plutonium nitrate were used in the experiments. A split-table device was used in the final assembly of the arrays. Ths planar arrays were reflected with close fitting plexiglas on each side and on the bottom but not the top surface. The experiments addressed a number of factors effecting criticality: the critical air gap between <b>bottles</b> in an array of fixed number of <b>bottles,</b> the number of <b>bottles</b> required for criticality if the <b>bottles</b> were touching, and the effect on critical array spacing and critical <b>bottle</b> number due to the insertion of an hydrogeneous substance into the air gap between <b>bottles.</b> Each <b>bottle</b> contained about 2. 4 l of Pu(NO{sub 3 }) {sub 4 } solution at a Pu concentration of 105 g Pu/l, with the {sup 240 }Pu content being 2. 9 wt% at a free acid molarity H{sup +} of 5. 1. After the initial series of experiments were performed with <b>bottles</b> separated by air gaps, plexiglas shells of varying thicknesses were placed around each <b>bottle</b> to investigate how moderation between <b>bottles</b> affects both the number of <b>bottles</b> required for criticality and the critical spacing between each <b>bottle.</b> The minimum of <b>bottles</b> required for criticality was found to be 10. 9 <b>bottles,</b> occurring for a square array with <b>bottles</b> in contact. As the <b>bottles</b> were spaced apart, the critical number increased. For sixteen <b>bottles</b> in a square array, the critical separation between surfaces in both x and y direction was 0. 96 cm. The addition of plexiglas around each <b>bottle</b> decreased the critical <b>bottle</b> number, compared to those separated in air, but the critical <b>bottle</b> number, even with interstitial plastic in place was always greater than 10. 9 <b>bottles.</b> The most reactive configuration was a tightly packed array of <b>bottles</b> with no intervening material...|$|R
