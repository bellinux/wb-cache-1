50|$|Disease can {{be spread}} by chitterlings not cleaned {{properly}} and undercooked. Pathogens include E. coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Salmonella. Chitterlings are often soaked and rinsed thoroughly {{in several different}} cycles of cool water, and repeatedly picked clean <b>by</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>removing</b> extra fat, undigested food, and specks of feces. They may then be turned inside out, cleaned and boiled, sometimes in baking soda and/or salt, and the water discarded.|$|R

40|$|Summary {{of changes}} in this version: Rework test {{framework}} {{to be under the}} Transposome namespace. Add mgblast and formatdb executables for Linux to be installed, which will keep users (at least on Linux) from having to compile this <b>by</b> <b>hand.</b> <b>Remove</b> use of MooseX roles for handling options in favor of core Getopt::Long. Reduce verbosity in log by not logging output of each blast process. Clean up log formatting for readability. Rework tests to use local bin, so tests will pass without modifying the PATH. Add configuration details to log. Update documentation for all options to main application. See the "Changes" file for more information...|$|R

These small appliances are used to mix the cream until it is close to forming solid butter. This mixture is then mixed <b>by</b> <b>hand</b> to <b>remove</b> the buttermilk and water.|$|R
50|$|At the Robert G. White Large Animal Research Station (LARS), a {{modified}} bison crush {{is used to}} gently but firmly hold the muskoxen in place, and the pelt combed out using a long-toothed comb or hair pick. After the fleece is removed, it is cleaned <b>by</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>removing</b> vegetation and other foreign matter, and then dehaired. Dehairing is the removal of intermediate hairs (greater than 30 micrometres in diameter). Dehairing is accomplished by carding as one would cashmere. Mechanical carding can cause breakage and weaken and roughen the qiviut. (Because the pelt is combed rather than shaved, {{there are very few}} guard hairs using this method. Pelts from hunted animals are shaved, so the dehairing process in this case is more laborious.) After dehairing, the qiviut may be cleaned again, if necessary.|$|R
5000|$|Excarnation is the {{practice}} of removing the flesh from the corpse without interment. The Zoroastrians have traditionally left their dead on Towers of Silence, where {{the flesh of the}} corpses is left to be devoured by vultures and other carrion-eating birds. Alternatively, it can also mean butchering the corpse <b>by</b> <b>hand</b> to <b>remove</b> the flesh (also referred to as [...] "defleshing").|$|R

25|$|Growth of {{the water}} {{hyacinth}} in Lake Victoria has been tracked since 1993, reaching its maxima biomass in 1997 and then declining again {{by the end of}} 2001. Greater growth was observed {{in the northern part of}} the lake, in relatively protected areas, which may be linked to current and weather patterns and could also be due to the climate and water conditions, which are more suitable to the plants growth (as there are large urban areas to the north end of the lake, in Uganda). The invasive weed was first attempted to be controlled <b>by</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>removed</b> manually from the lake; however, re-growth occurred quickly. Public awareness exercises were also conducted. More recently, measures have been used such as the introduction of natural insect predators, including two different water hyacinth weevils and large harvesting and chopping boats, which seem to be much more effective in eliminating the water hyacinth.|$|R
50|$|The coated nuclei {{are then}} dried and {{polished}} <b>by</b> <b>hand</b> to <b>remove</b> imperfections such as bumps and blemishes. This coating process is repeated (around 30 times) until {{a multitude of}} fine layers is formed over the nuclei, building up the density and color uniformity. To assure durability, the formed, blended multiple layers are subjected to various gases and solutions that make them impervious to discoloration, chipping and peeling.|$|R

[...] This process of cleaning the wila is called kálka in the Secwepemc language, and likely helps to remove the toxin vulpinic acid, which is slightly water-soluble.|$|R
5000|$|The {{origin of}} the Italian tuneup comes from Ferrari. Owners would drive their cars {{infrequently}} and never run them hard, which causes the engine to build up enough carbon inside to affect performance. Mechanics would perform a [...] "tuneup" [...] by driving several laps around a race track to get the engine hot enough to burn out the built up carbon.

50|$|Thermographic {{printing}} is {{a process}} that involves several stages but can be implemented in a low-cost manufacturing process. The process involves printing the desired designs or text with an ink that remains wet, rather than drying on contact with the paper. The paper is then dusted with a powdered polymer that adheres to the ink. The paper is vacuumed or agitated, mechanically or <b>by</b> <b>hand,</b> to <b>remove</b> excess powder, and then heated to near combustion. The wet ink and polymer bond and dry, resulting in a raised print surface similar to the result of an engraving process.|$|R

40|$|This study {{compared}} {{removal of}} pairs of co-adhering and non-co-adhering oral actinomyces and streptococci from salivary pellicles by manual, rotating/oscillating electric and sonic toothbrushes, applying weights up to 240 g. First, actinomyces {{were allowed to}} adhere to a pellicle in a parallel plate flow chamber, after which streptococci suspended in saliva were perfused through the chamber at 33 degreesC. On average, 34 - 39 % of the adhering bacteria were adhering as single organisms. For co-adhering and non-co-adhering pairs, 33 and 10 % of the adhering bacteria were involved, respectively, in aggregates comprising more than 10 organisms. Brushing <b>by</b> <b>hand</b> <b>removed</b> 82 % at low weight (40 g), which was less than by electric (93 %) or sonic (92 %) brushing, while for all modes of brushing bacterial removal increased with increasing weight to 95 - 99 %. For a non-co-adhering pair, subsequent exposure of brushed pellicles to a streptococcal suspension yielded only 2 - 16 % of bacteria involved in large aggregates, regardless of the mode ofbrushing. For the co-adhering pair, however, de novo streptococcal adhesion to hand-brushed pellicles yielded 34 - 57 % of bacteria involved in large aggregates, while electric and sonic brushing left 22 - 35 % of the bacteria involved in large aggregates. De novo streptococcal adhesion for the co-adhering pair increased with increasing weight for the electric and sonic brush {{in contrast to the}} manual brush. Since a strong influence of co-adhesion is evident in de novo streptococcal adhesion, despite nearly complete removal of all actinomyces, these observations suggest that the three modes of brushing leave footprints to which streptococci preferentially adhere...|$|R

50|$|The dunes have {{suffered}} from non-native or inappropriate plantings such as alder, privet, hawthorn, michaelmas daisy, {{and in particular the}} Rugosa rose (Rosa rugosa). It is a suckering shrub which develops new plants from the roots and forms dense thickets 1-1.50 m tall. In late summer and early autumn the plants unusually often bear fruit and flowers at the same time. Planted nearby at the car park as an ornamental plant it has spread to the reserve and is now widespread and expanding. It is extremely tolerant of seaside salt spray and storms and is considered an invasive species. At Stevenston it is out-competing native flora, thereby threatening the biological diversity of this Local Nature Reserve. SNAPS (Scottish National Aerial Photography Scheme) has been used to map the areas of the Japanese rose domination. It is hoped that volunteers will be able to prevent its further spread by digging it out <b>by</b> <b>hand</b> and <b>removing</b> it from the site for appropriate disposal.|$|R
5000|$|There are regular {{fairs and}} fetes at Flitton and Greenfield Village Hall, which {{also serves as}} a {{communal}} recreation ground. A traditional method of [...] "stone picking" [...] was adopted during the development of the recreation ground when local children were asked to pick stones from the field <b>by</b> <b>hand</b> to <b>remove</b> the bad fortune associated with the 1920s strawberry blight. Maypole dancing was used for several years on May Day as a further example of Celtic pagan tradition. Accordingly, a carnival procession using carts and later tractors, from Westoning to Flitton would be used to start off the May Day celebrations. Fetes continue to be held on the site most years. A travelling funfair was once a regular feature of the field next to the Old Bell Public House in Greenfield. Fetes and fairs were also traditionally held in the field next to Moat Farm. Both of these sites are now occupied by private residences.|$|R

40|$|Carcass beef has {{traditionally}} been washed <b>by</b> <b>hand</b> to <b>remove</b> foreign material such as hair, soil particles, and microbiological organisms that have contaminated the surfaces. These carcasses are inspected by the Food Safety Inspection Service (FSIS) to detect defects related to carcass cleanliness. Recent {{research and development of}} technology have emphasized automated machine washing. At pressures above that normally used, it is conceivable that water could penetrate tissue surfaces and be absorbed by the carcasses. Also, longer wash periods may enhance water uptake by carcasses. According to the ASH RAE Handbook and Product Directory, the average shrinkage of carcass beef using good current practices was 1. 3 % at 20 hr postmortem. USDA meat inspection regulations required that carcasses sustain no net increase in weight due to absorption of water during the washing process. There is no available literature on the effects of various automated washing techniques on carcass weights after a 20 -hr chill.
