Tibetan butter tea contains rock salt and dre, a butter made from yak milk, which is churned vigorously in a cylindrical vessel closely resembling a <b>butter</b> <b>churn.</b> The same may be said for salt tea, which is popular in the Hindu Kush region of northern Pakistan.|$|E

2500|$|In 1980 the {{publishing}} house Schibsted forlag suggested {{the writing of}} a historical series of novel to Margit Sandemo. First she didn't get excited about this idea and she decided to continue to write novel series for magazines. In her own words, {{she changed her mind}} in 1981 when she saw a picture of a medieval church painting in a newspaper. It showed a woman making butter in a <b>butter</b> <b>churn</b> and the Devil behind her, trying to seduce her. Sandemo got the idea for the entire 47 book series The Legend of the Ice People from this picture, although in the beginning she [...] thought that the series will comprise only eight books. The first volume, Spellbound, was published in 1982.|$|E

50|$|Originally, {{buttermilk}} {{referred to}} the liquid left over from <b>churning</b> <b>butter</b> from cultured or fermented cream. Traditionally, before cream could be skimmed from whole milk, the milk was left to sit {{for a period of}} time to allow the cream and milk to separate. During this time, naturally occurring lactic acid-producing bacteria in the milk fermented it. This facilitates the <b>butter</b> <b>churning</b> process, since fat from cream with a lower pH coalesces more readily than that of fresh cream. The acidic environment also helps prevent potentially harmful microorganisms from growing, increasing shelf-life. However, in establishments that used cream separators, the cream was hardly acidic at all.|$|R

25|$|Milk {{had to be}} {{processed}} to preserve it. This was done by first churning it, using a goatskin or clay container to separate the butterfat from the whey. The butterfat was processed by boiling and then cooling it to make clarified butter, which could then be stored for a long time.
