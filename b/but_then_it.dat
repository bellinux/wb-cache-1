5|$|Star Trek has led {{directly}} or indirectly {{to the creation of}} a number of magazines which focus either on science fiction or specifically on Star Trek. Starlog was a magazine which was founded in the 1970s. Initially, its focus was on Star Trek actors, <b>but</b> <b>then</b> <b>it</b> began to expand its scope.|$|E
5|$|What {{grabbed me}} at first {{actually}} {{was the fact}} it was so big. The melody starts off very soft <b>but</b> <b>then</b> <b>it</b> gets massive and kinda angsty. I've had lots of friends who've gone through 'Battlefield' situations in their relationships, so when I was singing the song I put myself in their position and {{tried to imagine what}} they were going through. I got so, so into it and I think you can tell.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally all Danish sockets were {{equipped}} with a switch to prevent touching live pins when connecting/disconnecting the plug. Today, sockets without switch are allowed, <b>but</b> <b>then</b> <b>it</b> is a requirement that the sockets have a cavity to prevent touching the live pins. The shape of the plugs generally {{makes it difficult to}} touch the pins when connecting/disconnecting.|$|E

25|$|In the Quebec City district, {{the lower}} court (tribunal antérieur) was {{established}} in 1664 and had jurisdiction to try cases at first instance, <b>but</b> <b>then</b> <b>it</b> was abolished in 1674. The Sovereign Council appointed trial judges (juges inférieurs) to adjudicate cases at first instance until the Provostry of Quebec (prévôté de Québec) was created in May 1677.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} common {{objections}} to rule-consequentialism is that it is incoherent, because {{it is based on the}} consequentialist principle that what we should be concerned with is maximizing the good, <b>but</b> <b>then</b> <b>it</b> tells us not to act to maximize the good, but to follow rules (even in cases where we know that breaking the rule could produce better results).|$|E
25|$|Naguib {{began to}} clash with other RCC members {{over how the}} Revolution's goals should be implemented. He wanted to phase out the {{political}} influence {{of the military and}} return the country to civilian rule, believing that the role of the military was not to rule the country, but rather to protect those in power. The army, he thought, could interfere to change a corrupt regime, <b>but</b> <b>then</b> <b>it</b> should withdraw.|$|E

25|$|Australia {{lost the}} fourth test {{and there was}} some media talk that Chappell might find his way back in the team for the fifth test in place of Graham Yallop, who had shown {{weakness}} against fast bowling. Chappell scored 46 in a tour game, <b>but</b> <b>then</b> <b>it</b> seemed the wicket for the fifth test would take spin, which Yallop excelled at playing, so he kept his spot and Chappell remained 12th man.|$|E
25|$|While the {{two forms}} of the {{recurrence}} formula are clearly mathematically equivalent, the first subtracts 1 from a number extremely close to 1, leading to an increasingly problematic loss of significant digits. As the recurrence is applied repeatedly, the accuracy improves at first, <b>but</b> <b>then</b> <b>it</b> deteriorates. It never gets better than about 8 digits, even though 53-bit arithmetic should be capable of about 16 digits of precision. When the second form of the recurrence is used, the value converges to 15 digits of precision.|$|E
25|$|The {{position}} {{had been}} long before selected, and {{the whole of the}} ground had even been surveyed, with a view to meet the contingency which had now actually occurred; <b>but</b> <b>then</b> <b>it</b> must be remembered, that in this design the co-operation of the IV Corps (Bülow's) was fully expected, whereas the latter had now become a doubtful question: and hence it was that Blücher was led to place more reliance upon a direct support from Wellington, than would otherwise have been the case.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{talk like}} a man, St. Clare,--just as if a mother could be {{relieved}} {{of the care}} of a child in that state; <b>but,</b> <b>then,</b> <b>it's</b> all alike,--no one ever knows what I feel! I can't throw things off, as you do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "O, I don't {{believe in}} such things; it's all talk. If people have feeling, they will show it,--they can't help it; <b>but,</b> <b>then,</b> <b>it's</b> a great misfortune to have feeling. I'd rather {{have been made}} like St. Clare. My {{feelings}} prey upon me so!" ...|$|R
5000|$|Lambert {{relates to}} the song as her own anthem: [...] "It’s {{antagonistic}} in a fun way, and I loved the attitude behind it. It kind of fools you, because it’s got this really country, laid-back intro, <b>but</b> <b>then</b> <b>it’s</b> balls-to-the-wall {{the rest of the}} way. It’s so much fun!" ...|$|R
25|$|The {{advantage}} to this design {{is that the}} brake is not being applied to slow the vehicle, it is simply clutching {{the second set of}} gears in or out. This means it does not dissipate energy, except in the brief period it is being applied or released. Smoother steering can be accomplished by partial application of the brake, <b>but</b> <b>then</b> <b>it</b> begins to dissipate energy like the braked differential. The main disadvantage is {{that there is only one}} turning radius. Like the standard differential solution, these systems are also subject to self-turning when travelling over terrain.|$|E
25|$|Operation Yevusi lasted two weeks, from 22 April 1948 to 3 May 1948. Not all {{objectives}} were achieved before the British enforced a cease-fire. A Palmach force occupied the strategically located San Simon monastery in Katamon. Arab irregulars attacked the monastery {{and a heavy}} battle evolved. Both sides {{had a lot of}} wounded and killed fighters. The Palmach considered a retreat while the wounded fighters would blow themselves up, <b>but</b> <b>then</b> <b>it</b> was realized that the Arab force was exhausted and could not continue the fighting. As a result, the Arab residents left the suburb and the southern besieged Jewish suburbs were released.|$|E
25|$|Regular Show (also {{known as}} Regular Show in Space during its eighth season) is an American {{animated}} television sitcom created by J. G. Quintel for Cartoon Network that aired from September 6, 2010, to January 16, 2017. The series {{revolves around the}} lives of two working-class friends, a blue jay named Mordecai and a raccoon named Rigbyboth employed as groundskeepers at a local park. They usually try to solve a simple problem <b>but</b> <b>then</b> <b>it</b> leads to a surreal, extreme, and often supernatural misadventure. During these misadventures, they interact with the show's other main characters: Benson, Pops, Muscle Man, Hi-Five Ghost, Skips, Margaret and Eileen.|$|E

25|$|Experienced miners from Northumberland and Wales were {{recruited}} for the digging and the British attack began on 17 April 1915. The hill was captured quickly with only seven casualties <b>but</b> <b>then</b> <b>it</b> {{was found that}} the salient which had been created, made occupation of the hill very costly. Both sides mistakenly accused the other of using poison gas in the April fighting; German attacks on the hill in early May included the use of gas shells and the Germans recovered the ground at the second attempt on 5 May. It remained in German hands until the Battle of Messines in 1917, when two of the Mines in the Battle of Messines were detonated beneath Hill 60 and the Caterpillar.|$|E
25|$|Use {{of trucks}} was {{constrained}} {{by the lack of}} fuel and high costs of synthetic gasoline on the German side, and the losses of equipment in 1941–1942 on the Soviet side. The Soviets managed their losses with the formation of 76 horse transport battalions of 500 horses each, and employed reindeer in the Arctic and camels in the South. But overcoming shortage of horses themselves was insurmountable: a work horse matures in three to four years; farm stocks were already depleted of horses as well as tractors. Western European nations, starting with the United Kingdom, witnessed shortage of horses since the 1920s and adjusted their armies accordingly. Germany of the 1920s managed to restore their population of horses, <b>but</b> <b>then</b> <b>it</b> declined again as farm horses were replaced by motor power.|$|E
25|$|The Allied {{strategy}} {{had called}} for General Francisco Javier Venegas and the Spanish Army of La Mancha to prevent the French IV Corps under General of Division Horace François Bastien Sébastiani from reinforcing Joseph's army at Talavera. In this, Venegas was completely unsuccessful, but another opportunity opened up. With Sébastiani gone from his front, the way to Madrid was almost undefended. Though his own army was too crippled to move at the moment, Wellesley hoped that pressure from Venegas' offensive would compel the French to retreat. The Army of La Mancha pressed forward to Toledo and Aranjuez on 29 July, <b>but</b> <b>then</b> <b>it</b> unaccountably halted in place until 5 August. Dropping off Marshal Claude Perrin Victor's 18,000-man I Corps to watch Wellesley and Cuesta, Joseph pulled back to a position at Illescas where he could move to block either Venegas or Wellesley if necessary.|$|E

25|$|Further {{illustrations}} are plentiful. In East v Maurer where Maurer lied that {{he would}} not set up a barber competing with the one he was selling to East, Maurer was liable for East's normal market lost profits, costs of improvements and the price paid minus the business' selling price. In Smith New Court Ltd v Scrimgeour Vickers (Asset Management) Ltd Smith New Court Ltd was deceitfully told there were close rival bids for shares in a company called Ferranti IS Inc. Smith New Court Ltd bought, <b>but</b> <b>then</b> <b>it</b> transpired that massive fraud had occurred. The Court of Appeal held that only £1.2m was recoverable, the difference between the market price at the time of purchase and the real price, but the House of Lords held that the full losses of £11.8m were recoverable (even though the fraud was unconnected to the misrepresentation) because that loss was one which Smith New Court Ltd had due to entering the transaction after being deceived. In practice, because an action for negligent misrepresentation has now been developed through Hedley Byrne and the Misrepresentation Act 1967 s 2(1), it is often not beneficial to sue for deceit. The only certain difference is that the defence of contributory negligence is unavailable in a deceit action. But deceit is harder to prove, since evidence of a person's state of mind is needed. Because the charge can sink people's reputations, alleging deceit is also contrary to professional conduct rules at the bar, unless a good case exists. A large difference which is subject to debate, is that the causation and remoteness rules are more generous for deceit. Certainly this is true when comparing negligence and deceit. However, the Misrepresentation Act 1967 s 2(1), which was modelled on the law as it stood when the Act was passed, has the same causation rules as for deceit (see below).|$|E
