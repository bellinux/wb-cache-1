40|$|Distributed mobile {{transactions}} utilize commit protocols {{to achieve}} atomicity and consistent decisions. This is challenging as mobile environments are typically characterized by frequent perturbations such as network disconnections and node failures. On one hand environmental constraints on mobile participants and wireless links {{may increase the}} resource <b>blocking</b> <b>time</b> of fixed participants.

40|$|A {{real-time}} {{garbage collector}} has to fulfill two conflicting properties: avoid heap fragmentation and provide short <b>blocking</b> <b>time.</b> The heap {{needs to be}} compacted to avoid probably unbounded fragmentation.

Copying of large objects and especially large arrays introduces long <b>blocking</b> <b>times</b> that are unacceptable for real-time systems.

40|$|Contemporary {{railway traffic}} {{requires}} different train services {{share the same}} infrastructure. Capacity consumption together with the homogeneous level of train traffic gives {{a picture of the}} efficient use of infrastructure. Previous research suggests that the utilization is more efficient with a homogeneous operating program. During last decades, many researchers tried to describe and/or define the homogeneity of operating programs in rail service; however, no definition considered the infrastructure occupation. In addition, several methods were developed to evaluate the homogeneity in railway operation considering variations in speed, running time and headway. But, the occupancy of infrastructure has not been discussed in the existing methods. An extension of existing definitions is presented {{from the perspective of the}} infrastructure, which can be characterized by variations in <b>blocking</b> <b>time,</b> buffer time and running direction. The <b>blocking</b> <b>time,</b> buffer time and running direction describe the occupancy of train path on track sections based on the <b>blocking</b> <b>time</b> model. Accordingly, the homogeneity of operating programs is evaluated through three parameters, namely the homogeneity of <b>blocking</b> <b>time</b> (HBL), the homogeneity of buffer time (HBU) and the homogeneity of running direction (HRD). The overall homogeneity (OH) combined HBL; HBU and HRD to realize an integrity evaluation of homogeneity of operating programs. The results show that this new methodology can quantify the homogeneity of railway operations, not only for track sections but for an entire network, which contributes significantly to the efficient utilization of infrastructure. With the method developed in this thesis, the interrelationship between homogeneity of operating programs and operation quality were investigated quantitatively. Firstly, both the influence of each parameter of homogeneity and the overall homogeneity were analyzed. The operation quality (delay-coefficient) is evaluated for timetables with different train types, arrangements of buffer times and sequences of train runs. The results show that the operation quality deteriorates with less homogeneous timetables, in which the variation in buffer time has a more significant influence. Finally, the influence of homogeneity of operating programs is studied for different traffic flows. The low traffic flow is more sensitive to the homogeneity of buffer time and the homogeneity of <b>blocking</b> <b>time</b> is more significant for high traffic flow...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} introducing stochastic <b>blocking</b> <b>times</b> to support timetable planning. The approach redefines timetable conflicts by associating a probability with each conflict estimated {{as a function of}} process-time variability. The method consists of calibrating a motion equation using data collected on board the train. The calibration set can then be used to compute the stochastic behaviour of individual trains or in micro-simulation models. In this research the behaviour of individual trains was investigated and tested. The method consists of repeatedly simulating an individual train run on a microscopic infrastructure model using the estimated performance parameter distributions obtained in the calibration. The resulting <b>blocking</b> <b>times</b> are stored and depicted in a time–distance diagram using transparencies to represent each run. The diagram {{presents a}} wider occupation staircase, in which colour intensity is proportional to the occupation probability. When a second train is inserted into the diagram the probabilistic occupation steps of the two trains can overlap, showing the conflict probability. The soft- ware also computes and displays a series of data including the probability of conflicts. The method has been tested on the mixed-traffic, double-track line between Trieste and Venice.
