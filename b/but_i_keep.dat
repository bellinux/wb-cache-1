6000|$|... "Gad, you can't dislike {{him more}} than I do; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>keep</b> good friends with him for all that, and you must do the same. Now, look here, Angela, will you promise to keep a secret?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{brought my}} old doll, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>keep</b> her hidden because I am {{too big to}} play with her, and yet I can't bear to throw her away, I'm so fond of her," [...] said Rose, {{continuing}} her confidences in a whisper.|$|E

6000|$|... "I do what I can for him, {{but it is}} very little. I bathe his {{forehead}} with water, and pour it between his lips.
