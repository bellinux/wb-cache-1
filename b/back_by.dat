2500|$|An [...] "asset-backed security" [...] is {{sometimes}} {{used as an}} umbrella term for a type of security <b>backed</b> <b>by</b> a pool of assets, and sometimes for {{a particular type of}} that security – one <b>backed</b> <b>by</b> consumer loans or loans, leases or receivables other than real estate. In the first case, collateralized debt obligations (cdo, securities <b>backed</b> <b>by</b> debt obligations – often other asset-backed securities) and mortgage-backed securities (mbs, where the assets are mortgages), are subsets, different kinds of asset-backed securities. (Example: [...] "The capital market in which asset-backed securities are issued and traded is composed of three main categories: ABS, MBS and CDOs". (italics added)).

5|$|Across the battlefield, as {{the first}} line of Persian ships was pushed <b>back</b> <b>by</b> the Greeks, they became fouled in the {{advancing}} second and third lines of their own ships. On the Greek left, the Persian admiral Ariabignes (a brother of Xerxes) was killed early in the battle; left disorganised and leaderless, the Phoenician squadrons appear to have been pushed back against the coast, many vessels running aground. In the centre, a wedge of Greek ships pushed through the Persians lines, splitting the fleet in two.|$|E
