25|$|The Bistromath arrives {{too late}} {{at the gate}} to stop the robots, so its {{occupants}} transport to the planet to attempt {{to negotiate with the}} Krikkit people. To their surprise, they find that the people seem to lack any desire to continue the war, and are directed to the robot and spaceship facilities in orbit about the planet. With Zaphod and Marvin's help, the group is able to infiltrate the facilities. Trillian deduces that the Krikkiters have been manipulated, reasoning that the people of Krikkit could not simultaneously <b>be</b> <b>smart</b> enough to develop their ultimate weapon—a bomb that could destroy every star in the universe—while also being stupid enough not to realise that this weapon would also destroy them.|$|E

2500|$|During April 2009, U.S. Federal Reserve Vice Chair Janet Yellen {{discussed}} the [...] "Paradox of deleveraging" [...] described by economist Hyman Minsky: [...] "Once this massive credit crunch hit, it didn’t take {{long before we}} were in a recession. The recession, in turn, deepened the credit crunch as demand and employment fell, and credit losses of financial institutions surged. Indeed, we have been in the grips of precisely this adverse feedback loop for more than a year. A process of balance sheet deleveraging has spread to nearly every corner of the economy. Consumers are pulling back on purchases, especially on durable goods, to build their savings. Businesses are cancelling planned investments and laying off workers to preserve cash. And, financial institutions are shrinking assets to bolster capital and improve their chances of weathering the current storm. Once again, Minsky understood this dynamic. He spoke of the paradox of deleveraging, in which precautions that may <b>be</b> <b>smart</b> for individuals and firms—and indeed essential to return the economy to a normal state—nevertheless magnify the distress of the economy as a whole." ...|$|E
