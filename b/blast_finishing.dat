40|$|AbstractThe final finish {{operations}} have great significance in an overall manufacturing cycle of a product. The surface finishing and modification of surfaces {{have been the}} vital requirements {{of most of the}} products. The processes like shot peening, shot <b>blasting,</b> abrasive <b>finishing</b> and super finishing are being largely employed for such requirements. While final finishing of flat and outside surfaces are relatively easy and well established, the internal surfaces such as those of pipes is not so simple. In this paper, the application of low frequency alternative magnetic field has been explored for imparting surface modification including surface on the internal cylindrical surface. The cold drawn SUS 304 stainless steel (SS) pins have been used as micro tools. The interaction of vibrating SS pins (due to AC magnetic field) with internal surface of rotating pipe has resulted in micro indentation of surface thereby improving surface characteristics. An experimental setup has been developed to investigate the effect of major process parameters on the percentage improvement in surface finish and surface hardness. Response Surface Methodology has been employed to design the experiment for demonstrating the effect of various process parameters on the surface finish and hardness of the processed surface. It is observed that SUS 304 stainless steel pins are capable of improving the surface characteristics like surface finish and surface hardness in the internal surface of brass tube...|$|R
40|$|The article {{presents}} the results of a comparative analysis of the metal substructure for dental prosthesis made from a Co-Cr-Mo-W alloy by two techniques, i. e. precision investment casting and selective laser melting (SLM). It was found that the roughness of the raw surface of the SLM sinter is higher than the roughness of the cast surface, which is compensated by the process of blast cleaning during metal preparation for the application of a layer of porcelain. Castings have a dendritic structure, while SLM sinters are characterized by a compact, fine-grain microstructure of the hardness higher by about 100 HV units. High performance and high costs of implementation the SLM technology are the cause to use it for the purpose of many dental manufacturers under outsourcing rules. The result is a reduction in manufacturing costs of the product associated with dental work time necessary to scan, designing and treatment of sinter compared with the time needed to develop a substructure in wax, absorption in the refractory mass, casting, sand <b>blasting</b> and <b>finishing.</b> As a result of market competition and low cost of materials, sinter costs decrease which brings the total costs related to the construction unit making using the traditional method of casting, at far less commitment of time and greater predictability and consistent sinter quality...|$|R
40|$|A bonding {{evaluation}} {{that investigated}} the cryogenic tensile strength of several different adhesives / resins was performed. The test materials consisted of 6061 aluminum test pieces adhered to a wet-wound graphite laminate {{in order to}} simulate the bond created at the liner-composite interface of an aluminum lined composite overwrapped pressure vessel. It was found that for cryogenic applications, a flexible, low modulus resin system must be used. Additionally, the samples prepared with {{a thin layer of}} cured resin - or prebond - performed significantly better than those without. It was found that it is critical that the prebond surface must have sufficient surface roughness prior to the bonding application. Also, the aluminum test pieces that were prepared using a surface etchant slightly outperformed those that were prepared with a grit <b>blast</b> surface <b>finish</b> and performed significantly better than those which had been scored using sand paper to achieve the desired surface finish. An additional impact investigation studied the post impact tensile strength of composite rings in a cryogenic environment. The composite rings were filament wound with several combinations of graphite and aramid fibers and were prepared with different resin systems. The rings were subjected to varying levels of Charpy impact damage then pulled to failure in tension. It was found that the addition of elastic aramid fibers with the carbon fiber mitigate the overall impact damage and drastically improve the post impact strength of the structure in a cryogenic environment...|$|R
40|$|A {{fracture}} mechanics based approach {{was used to}} determine the debond energy or fracture toughness of the stem-cement interface for a variety of conditions. The goals of the study were to determine if early cementing of stems increased the debond energy of grit blasted stem-cement interfaces and if debond energy was dependent on mold type. Early (2 min) and late (6 min) times of cementation were considered for two different grit <b>blasted</b> surface <b>finishes</b> (16 and 60 grit, Ra= 5. 7 or 2. 3 microm). Specimen fabrication was performed using a relatively simple, unconstrained rectangular mold and a mold that more closely simulated in vivo conditions. The rectangular mold was used with all components at room temperature whereas the in vivo simulated mold had a body that resembled the femoral canal in shape and was warmed to body temperature. Early cementing did not increase the debond energy using the in vivo simulated mold. Extensive porosity was found at the interface, and porosity had a strong negative effect on debond energy. When the simpler, rectangular mold was used, early cementing did result in higher debond energies, but few voids were found at the interface. It appears that porosity at the interface was the major factor affecting the debond energy. The results from this study do not support the concept that improved stem-cement interface strength can be obtained by application of the cement while it is in a low viscosity state...|$|R
40|$|BLAST {{is arguably}} the single most {{important}} piece of software ever written for the biological sciences. It is the core of most bioinformatics workflows, being a critical component of genome homology searches and annotation. It has influenced the landscape of biology by aiding in everything from functional characterization of genes to pathogen detection to the development of novel vaccines. While BLAST is very popular, it is also often one of the most computationally intensive parts of bioinformatics analysis. In our workflows, BLAST typically takes the majority of cpu time, and we need to parallelize to finish in a reasonable time frame. Waiting for <b>BLAST</b> to <b>finish</b> without having any clue of how long it&#x 2019;s going to take is kind of depressing, and you could waste a day of work trying to run a job that would never finish. If you feel the same way we do, then check out Cunningham, a tool we designed to estimate BLAST runtimes for shotgun sequence datasets using sequence composition statistics. We&#x 2019;ve trained its models on real metagenomic sequence data using the Amazon EC 2 cloud, and it will provide a relatively quick estimate for datasets with up to tens of millions of sequences. It&#x 2019;s not perfect, but it&#x 2019;ll give you at least some idea of expected runtime, how large a cluster you&#x 2019;re going to need, how much you&#x 2019;ll need to partition your data, etc. We use it all the time now, so we hope it&#x 2019;ll be useful to someone else out there.

5000|$|The scene {{goes back}} to the present, the official, looking {{sympathetic}} and moved by what he is hearing, listens as Capelli sadly says Alpha Team later guessed that Murphy, who knew if the team performed Leavitt's plan no one would have made it home, so he did the only thing he could think of - Murphy decided to sacrifice himself to make sure the Chimera didn't get the bomb, and the team got home. Murphy must have used a syringe to give Oppenheimer a transfusion of his own blood, which for a normal human would be like taking a hit of pure adrenalin. It would kill him within 10 minutes, but Murphy possibly figured he wasn't going to survive much longer anyway, and he needed him awake. Because the ship was only 5,000 feet off the ground, and Murphy knew as long as the tank stayed in one piece, the team, possessing Sentinel regenerative powers, was only rendered unconscious after they crashed onto the snowy ground. Oppenheimer, however, died in the fall. 20 or 30 minutes later, Alpha Team regained consciousness and saw [...] "it" [...] from about 50 miles away - the bomb detonating and completely destroying the ship in a fiery explosion, with Murphy still aboard.

50|$|Construction of {{the canal}} began in June 1837 with William Fowler as the engineer, who was {{replaced}} by Benjamin Townshend in September 1838, who had himself been replaced by William Richardson by the time construction was completed. The main contractor was James Frost, who was from Wednesbury. The canal was all on one level, with a stop lock at its junction with the Stourbridge Canal, {{and the length of}} the main line was about 2 mi. It was completed in 1840, opening on 27 June, and had cost Â£49,000, including Â£3,000 to purchase the tramway, which was paid for in 1841. The Sandhills Branch, which ran for 0.6 mi from the main line to wharves and limekilns on the Kinswinford to Sandhills, was opened later in 1840. The 0.3 mi Bromley Branch left the main line a little above the stop lock, and opened in 1841, although it was not authorised by the enabling Act. The canal was a success, with good amounts of iron ore and limestone being carried to <b>blast</b> furnaces, and <b>finished</b> iron and coal being exported to the wider region.|$|R
40|$|One {{possible}} loosening {{mechanism of}} the femoral component in total hip replacement is fatigue cracking of the cement mantle. A computational method capable of simulating this process may therefore be a useful tool in the preclinical evaluation of prospective implants. In this study, we investigated {{the ability of a}} computational method to predict fatigue cracking in experimental models of the implanted femur construct. Experimental specimens were fabricated such that cement mantle visualisation was possible throughout the test. Two different implant surface finishes were considered: grit blasted and polished. Loading was applied to represent level gait for two million cycles. Computational (finite element) models were generated to the same geometry as the experimental specimens, with residual stress and porosity simulated in the cement mantle. Cement fatigue and creep were modelled over a simulated two million cycles. For the polished stem surface finish, the predicted fracture locations in the finite element models closely matched those on the experimental specimens, and the recorded stem displacements were also comparable. For the grit <b>blasted</b> stem surface <b>finish,</b> no cement mantle fractures were predicted by the computational method, which was again in agreement with the experimental results.

40|$|Repeated heat-quench {{cycles of}} Al-llOO samples {{resulted}} in increased surface roughness and corresponding {{shifts in the}} temperature-time cooling curve towards shorter overall quench periods. Three different types of initial surface roughness were applied to the test samples: polished, particle <b>blasted,</b> and milled <b>finishes.</b> For {{each of the three}} test surfaces, cooling curve shifts during repeated heat-quench cycles were accompanied by surface roughening, the shift was smallest with the milled sample. The surface roughness was examined with the aid of scanning electron microscopy, surface contact profilometry, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Sur-face profiles obtained via the profilometer revealed, on a relative basis, significant changes in surface roughness on the polished and particle blasted surfaces but not on the milled (roughest) surface. The roughening was the result of (a) hydrogen diffusion associated with oxidation, (b) oxidation buildup, and, to a lesser extent, (c) expulsion of impurities along dendrite boundaries. The hydrogen diffusion caused localized pressure buildup within the surface and along grain boundaries resulting in the formation of both microscopic (1 to 10 fim) features on the polished and particle blasted surfaces and relatively large (20 to 1000 pm) bumps and blisters on the particle blasted surface. It is shown how these wide spectrum surface roughness features affect cooling rate by (a) raising the Leidenfrost temperature separating the film and transition boiling regimes, (b) increasing the number of boiling sites on the quenched surface, and (c) altering the impact dynamics of the spray drops. ...|$|R
