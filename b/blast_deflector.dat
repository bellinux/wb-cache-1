25|$|A jet <b>blast</b> <b>deflector</b> (JBD) or {{blast fence}} is a safety device that redirects the high energy exhaust from a jet engine to prevent damage and injury. The {{structure}} must {{be strong enough}} to withstand heat and high speed air streams as well as dust and debris carried by the turbulent air. Without a deflector, jet blast can be dangerous to people, equipment and other aircraft.|$|E
25|$|Aircraft {{carriers}} use {{jet blast}} deflectors {{at the rear}} of aircraft catapults, positioned to protect other aircraft from exhaust blast damage. Jet blast deflectors are made of heavy duty material that is raised and lowered by hydraulic cylinders or linear actuators. The jet <b>blast</b> <b>deflector</b> lies flush with and serves as a portion of the flight deck until the aircraft to be launched rolls over it {{on the way to the}} catapult. When the aircraft is clear of the deflector, the heavy panel is raised into position to redirect the hot jet blast. As soon as the deflector is raised, another aircraft can be brought into position behind it, and flight deck personnel can perform final readiness duties without the danger of hot, violent exhaust gases. Such systems were installed on aircraft carriers in the late 1940s and early 1950s, as jet-powered aircraft began to appear in navies.|$|E
500|$|A {{decision}} was made to replace the six NR-23 guns in the nose with four AM-23 cannon with 225 rounds per gun that had a rate of fire 50% greater than that of the NR-23 and to totally revise the gun installation. The guns were moved to the very tip of the nose in a separate compartment made of heat-resistant steel and provided with a special <b>blast</b> <b>deflector</b> chamber to deflect the blast gasses away from the engine inlets. [...] Two doors were provided {{at the bottom of the}} chamber to ventilate the chamber while firing. One problem occurred almost immediately during testing when the blast gases accumulated in the section where spent cartridges and links were saved and sometimes ignited. Occasionally this was strong enough to actually deform the chamber. The spent shell case section was thoroughly ventilated and muzzle brakes were introduced to successfully cure the problem.|$|E
25|$|Jet <b>blast</b> <b>deflectors</b> {{range in}} {{complexity}} from stationary concrete, metal or fiberglass fences to heavy panels that are raised and lowered by hydraulic arms and actively cooled. <b>Blast</b> <b>deflectors</b> {{can be used}} as protection from helicopter and fixed-wing aircraft propwash. At airports and jet engine service centers, jet <b>blast</b> <b>deflectors</b> can be combined with sound-deadening walls to form a ground run-up enclosure within which a jet aircraft engine can safely and more quietly be tested at full thrust.|$|R
2500|$|Jet <b>blast</b> <b>deflectors</b> {{began to}} appear at {{airports}} in the 1950s. Airports in the 1960s used jet <b>blast</b> <b>deflectors</b> with a height of , but airports in the 1990s needed deflectors that were twice as high, and even up to [...] high for jet airliners such as the McDonnell Douglas DC-10 and MD-11, which have engines mounted in the tail above the fuselage. Airports often place their deflectors at the beginnings of runways, especially when roadways or structures are adjacent. Airports that are in dense urban areas often have deflectors between taxiways and airport borders. Jet <b>blast</b> <b>deflectors</b> usually direct exhaust gases upward. However, a low-pressure zone can form behind the blast fence, causing ambient air and debris to be drawn upward with the jet exhaust, and hot, toxic gases to circulate behind the blast fence. Jet <b>blast</b> <b>deflectors</b> {{have been designed to}} counteract this problem by using multiple panels and various angles, and by using slotted panel surfaces.|$|R

5|$|Viktor Pugachyov, {{piloting}} {{the second}} Su-27K, {{became the first}} Russian to conventionally land aboard an aircraft carrier on 1 November 1989. It {{was found that the}} carrier's jet <b>blast</b> <b>deflectors</b> were too close to the engine nozzles when raised at an angle of 60°; thus an improvised solution held the deflectors at 45°. However, when the aircraft was in front of it for longer than the maximum six seconds, the shield's water pipes exploded. The pilot, Pugachyov, reduced engine throttle, accidentally causing the detents (blocks used to restrain aircraft from accelerating) to retract and the fighter to move forwards. The aircraft was quickly stopped; Pugachyov later took off without the use of <b>blast</b> <b>deflectors</b> or detents. Since then, a Kamov Ka-27PS search-and-rescue helicopter was flown close to the carrier in case of an accident.|$|R
50|$|After the {{cease-fire}} in Vietnam in 1973, Enterprise proceeded to the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, Bremerton, Washington, where the carrier was altered and refitted {{to support the}} Navy's newest fighter aircraft - the Grumman F-14 Tomcat. Two of four jet <b>blast</b> <b>deflectors</b> were enlarged to accommodate the Tomcat. The No. 4 propulsion shaft was replaced; it had been bent when its screw became fouled in a discarded arresting gear cable.|$|R

50|$|The ATF Dingo has a {{modular design}} with five elements: chassis, {{protection}} cell, storage space, engine compartment, and bottom mine <b>blast</b> <b>deflector.</b> Its design is lighter and includes an armored chassis with a blast pan {{instead of the}} more common monocoque hull found in modern blast resistant vehicles. IBD's layered MEXAS is used and the windows are angled to deflect blasts and bullets. A tarpaulin is used over the back storage area instead of metal to save weight.|$|E
50|$|At {{the time}} the naval Flanker was being {{developed}} the Soviets were building their first generation of aircraft carriers and had no experience with steam catapults {{and did not want}} to delay the introduction of the carriers. Thus it was decided to use a take-off method that did not require catapults by building up full thrust against a <b>blast</b> <b>deflector</b> until the aircraft sheared restraints holding it down to the deck. The fighter would then accelerate up the deck onto a ski jump and become airborne.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time as the Fleet Air Arm was {{receiving}} its first aircraft, the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment had three FG.1s delivered to its 'C' Squadron for flight deck trials aboard Eagle. Two sets of trials were successfully carried out in March and June 1969; the first comprised approaches and touch and go landings, while the second set of trials involved full catapult launch and arrested recovery. As a result of the reheat from the Spey turbofans, the ship's jet <b>blast</b> <b>deflectors</b> (JBD) were not used; instead a steel plate was fixed to the deck to absorb the heat of the engines building to launch, and fire hoses were used after each launch to prevent them melting.|$|R
2500|$|High energy {{jet engine}} exhaust can cause injury and damage. Jet blast {{has been known}} to uproot trees, shatter windows, {{overturn}} automobiles and trucks, flatten poorly made structures and injure people.

Hurricane-force air streams moving at speeds up to [...] have been measured behind the largest jet-powered aircraft at distances of over [...] A Boeing 777's two General Electric GE90 engines combine to create a thrust of approximately , a level of force which is high enough to kill people. To prevent these problems, jet <b>blast</b> <b>deflectors</b> redirect the air stream in a non-dangerous direction, frequently upward.|$|R
50|$|In early 1966 Eagle was {{refitted}} at Devonport {{once more}} and was fitted with a single DAX II arrestor wire (no.3, her other wires were DAX I). She was recommissioned in 1967.Eagle was originally intended to receive a further refit that would have enabled her to comfortably operate the McDonnell Douglas Phantom (she had already successfully operated them in trials). Her two BS5 catapults fitted in her 1959-64 refit were already powerful enough to launch fully laden F-4s, but her Jet <b>Blast</b> <b>Deflectors</b> were still of the older steel plate design, and the reheated exhaust of the Phantom's Rolls Royce Spey engines required water-cooled deflector plates. It was also planned to fit bridle catchers to the catapults as a cost-saving measure, as the bridles would otherwise be lost after a single launch.|$|R
50|$|On 13 August 2011, the F-35 {{successfully}} completed jet <b>blast</b> <b>deflector</b> (JBD) testing at Lakehurst. F-35C test aircraft CF-1 {{along with an}} F/A-18E tested a combined JBD cooling panel configuration. The tests measured temperature, pressure, sound level, velocity, and other environmental data; the JBD model will enable the operation of all carrier aircraft, including the F-35C. Further carrier suitability testing continued in preparation for initial ship trials in 2013. On 18 November 2011, the U.S. Navy used its new Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS) to launch an F-35C into the air for the first time.|$|E
50|$|Approximately 45 {{minutes before}} launch time, flight crews conduct {{walk-around}} inspections and man their aircraft. Approximately 30 minutes prior to launch, aircraft are started, and pre-flight inspections are conducted. Approximately 15 minutes prior to launch, ready aircraft are taxied from their parked positions and spotted on or immediately behind the catapults. The ship is {{turned into the}} natural wind. As an aircraft is taxied onto the catapult, the wings are spread and a large jet <b>blast</b> <b>deflector</b> (JBD) panel rises out of the flight deck behind the engine exhaust. Prior to final catapult hookup, Final Checkers (inspectors) make final exterior checks of the aircraft, and loaded weapons are armed by Ordnancemen.|$|E
50|$|On 6 November 2010, {{the first}} F-35C arrived at Naval Air Station Patuxent River. The {{replacement}} engines for at-sea repair are {{too large to}} be transported by current underway replenishment systems. In 2011, the F-35Cs were grounded for six days after a software bug was found that could have prevented the control surfaces from being used during flight. On 27 July 2011, the F-35C test aircraft CF-3 completed its first steam catapult launch during a test flight at Naval Air Engineering Station Lakehurst; the TC-13 Mod 2 test steam catapult, representative of current fleet technology, was used. In addition to catapult launches at varying power levels, a three-week test plan included dual-aircraft jet <b>blast</b> <b>deflector</b> testing and catapult launches using a degraded catapult configuration to measure the effects of steam ingestion on the aircraft.|$|E
50|$|The two sub-types of SCB-27 {{modifications}} {{were primarily}} {{a result of}} changes in catapult technology in the early-1950s. SCB-27A vessels utilized a pair of H 8 slotted-tube hydraulic catapults, while the later SCB-27C vessels were fitted {{with a pair of}} C 11 steam catapults, a British innovation (in fact the first four installed, on Hancock and Ticonderoga, were British-built). To accommodate the catapult machinery, the SCB-27C vessels were slightly heavier (43,060 vice 40,600 tons) and after bulging wider abeam (103 vice 101 feet) than their SCB-27A sisters. Additionally, the SBC-27C carriers were equipped with jet <b>blast</b> <b>deflectors,</b> deck cooling, fuel blending facilities, emergency recovery barrier and storage and handling for nuclear weapons, which was not included in all of the SCB-27A carriers. Under SCB-27C the No. 3 (after) elevator was moved to the starboard deck edge; this elevator was located further aft on the first three SCB-27C ships than it was on the ships which received it concomitantly with an angled flight deck under the SCB-125 program.|$|R
2500|$|Jet <b>blast</b> <b>deflectors</b> aboard {{aircraft}} carriers {{are placed in}} very {{close proximity to the}} [...] temperatures of modern jet fighter exhaust. The non-skid decking surface of the deflector suffers heat damage and requires frequent maintenance or replacement. Additionally, the hot deflector surface cannot be used as normal decking until it has cooled enough to allow aircraft tires to roll over it. To mitigate the heat problem, active cooling systems were installed in the 1970s, tapping the fire mains (fire suppression water systems) to use seawater circulating through water lines within the deflector panel. However, the water cooling system adds more complexity and failure points, and requires additional maintenance. The most recent method tried by the United States Navy for solving the heat problem was introduced in 2008 with USS George H.W. Bush which uses heavy-duty metal panels covered in heat-dissipating ceramic tiles similar to those used on the Space Shuttle. The tiled panels can be changed quickly and easily—the ship carries a large replacement supply. Without active water lines, the passively-tiled deflector is expected to require much less maintenance.|$|R
5000|$|On 28 January 2005 {{the ship}} entered {{shipyard}} for Drydocking Planned Incremental Availability (DPIA). Many ship's systems were upgraded and maintenance {{was done to}} the hull. The ship's four jet <b>blast</b> <b>deflectors</b> were removed and upgraded to handle the increased heat generated by the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet. One defensive Phalanx CIWS mount and one Sea Sparrow launcher were replaced by two Rolling Airframe Missile launchers. During the 11 months the ship was drydocked, the crew contributed 20,000 hours of volunteer community service {{to the city of}} Newport News, Virginia. The work was completed on schedule, and George Washington returned to her Norfolk home port on 17 December 2005.On 1 December 2005, the United States Navy announced that George Washington would replace [...] as the forward-deployed carrier at the U.S. Yokosuka Naval Base in Japan, becoming the first nuclear-powered surface warship permanently stationed outside the continental U.S. In an attempt to explain the carrier's mission to the Japanese public, the U.S. Navy printed a manga about life aboard GW, titled [...] "CVN-73".|$|R

5000|$|The M41A1, M41A2, and M41A3 were {{equipped}} with a 76mm M32A1 high velocity rifled cannon firing fixed high explosive (HE), armor piercing (AP), or high velocity armor piercing (HVAP) ammunition. The baseline M41 was {{equipped with}} a very similar 76mm M32/T91E3 cannon. In all four marks, a co-axial [...]30 caliber machine gun is mounted {{to the left of}} the main armament; additionally, in US service an external [...]50 caliber machine gun was also mounted to the turret roof. The 76mm cannon has a maximum elevation of +19° and a depression of -9°. It utilizes a vertical sliding breech block and a spring actuated, inertia percussion firing mechanism. To prevent overpressure and help absorb recoil, the cannon has also been fitted with a bore evacuator, a <b>blast</b> <b>deflector,</b> and a concentric hydrospring recoil system. Ranging is manual and conducted through the gunner's M97A1 telescopic sight. Maximum range of the M32/T91E3 and M32A1 is estimated at 4,752 meters.|$|E
50|$|At {{the time}} of the announcement, Ark Royal was {{beginning}} a reconstruction with an austere refit of radar systems, communications, partial electrical rewiring and fittings needed to allow operation of the Phantom (despite {{the fact that it was}} a worse base for such a conversion than Eagle), and it was deemed unacceptable either to cancel the much needed work, or to spend such a large amount of money (approx. £32m) for less than three years continued use. A change of government led, as a consequence, to retain Ark Royal following her 1967-1970 refit, but not to proceed with a refit of Eagle, in spite of the estimated cost of providing her with fittings and <b>blast</b> <b>deflectors</b> to operate Phantoms being only £5m. Eagle was decommissioned in 1972, partly due to damage inflicted in a partial grounding a year before; repairs would have probably required a minimum 18-month refit in 1972-3 at a cost of around £40 million to operate till 1977. Many of the second squadron of F-4 Phantoms intended for Eagle were immediately transferred to the RAF. Eagle remained officially in reserve as a source of spares to maintain Ark Royal until 1978, but could never have been brought back into service.|$|R
5000|$|By 1960, {{the area}} around Water Street had been {{acquired}} by the city via eminent domain to build the Westinghouse Building, and this necessitated an eventual move to Parkway Center in the Pittsburgh suburb of Greentree, as the very first tenant. Heyl & Patterson participated in a high-profile project for the Public Auditorium Authority of Pittsburgh - the Civic Arena. Applying technology normally used for ore bridges and other bulk material handling machines, Heyl & Patterson designed and manufactured the trucks, gear motors and 480-volt AC motor drive that opened and closed the arena roof. A total of 42 trucks mounted on 78 wheels, 30 of which were individually driven, supported and moved the six moveable sections on the largest stainless steel dome in the world. [...] In 1961, Heyl & Patterson opened its Florida Operations Division with an office and fabrication plant on Merritt Island near Cocoa Beach, Florida, {{at the entrance to}} Kennedy Space Center. Florida Operations would serve the aerospace community at Cape Canaveral, and developed a system of <b>blast</b> <b>deflectors</b> for the space program launch pads. Later in the decade, Heyl & Patterson opened a Service Center in Charleston, West Virginia as a warehouse to stock spare parts.|$|R
50|$|In 1959 Eagle entered Devonport Dockyard {{to begin}} this {{extensive}} refit, and by May 1964 it was complete. Standard displacement had increased to around 44,100 tons (full load displacement was 54,100 tons) and Eagle was now the largest aircraft carrier in the Royal Navy. Total cost of the refit was £31 million. The refit was intended to extend her operational life for another 10 years, and she now operated Blackburn Buccaneer, de Havilland Sea Vixen, Supermarine Scimitar and Fairey Gannet aircraft, but water-cooled jet <b>blast</b> <b>deflectors</b> (needed to operate the RN Phantom fighters) were not fitted, and therefore the full potential of the ship was not realized. In 1964-5 it was claimed Eagle and the proposed CVA01 and half sized Hermes would be a viable three carrier fleet until 1980. Victorious would {{have been replaced by}} CVA01 in 1973. In reality the 1958 Royal Navy assessment was that with affordable modernization of the existing carrier fleet, only HMS Hermes would be effective after 1975, and she was too small. These assessments by the Director of Naval Construction in November 1958 were very accurate, taking into account the slower than expected pace of reconstruction, corrosion of war-built hulls, the obsolete power trains except in Victorious, and the cheap unsatisfactory mix of DC electrics with AC add-on generators where needed in Eagle and Ark Royal.|$|R
