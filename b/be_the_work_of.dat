5|$|Chrysippus is {{the first}} Stoic for whom the third of the four Stoic categories, i.e. the {{category}} somehow disposed is attested. In the surviving evidence, Chrysippus frequently makes use of the categories of substance and quality, but makes little use {{of the other two}} Stoic categories (somehow disposed and somehow disposed in relation to something). It is not clear whether the categories had any special significance for Chrysippus, and a clear doctrine of categories may <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> later Stoics.|$|E
5|$|During {{the papal}} interdict on England during King John's reign, John of Tynemouth {{remained}} in England. He {{also served as}} a papal judge-delegate on several occasions. He died in 1221, between 25 March and August. This date of death is only recorded in a medieval work, the Annals of Dunstable, often felt to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> another canonist, Richard de Mores.|$|E
5|$|In the episode, Millennium Group {{profiler}} Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) {{travels to}} Arkansas to investigate allegations {{of child abuse}} in the community, meeting fellow Group member Lara Means (Cloke).

50|$|Having {{passed through}} the South Garth there are seven figures carved {{at the base of}} the windows and these {{represent}} the Seven Christian Virtues- “Charity”, “Hope”, “Faith”, “Courage”, “Temperance”, “Prudence” and “Justice”. The statue of “Prudence” is it seems based on Prudence Maufe, the wife of the architect; even <b>the</b> shoes <b>are</b> in <b>the</b> style of shoes which she wore. “Hope” and “Justice” <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sculptor Richard Browne. “Faith” <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> John Cobbett and “Charity”, “Courage”, “Temperance” and “Prudence” <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> Alan Collins. <b>The</b> statue “Faith” <b>was</b> incidentally a gift from the Women’s Royal Army Corps.|$|R
5|$|In {{the north}} {{transept}} is Wells Cathedral clock, an astronomical clock from about 1325, believed to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> Peter Lightfoot, a monk of Glastonbury.

It is the second-oldest surviving clock in England, after the Salisbury cathedral clock.|$|E
5|$|Many {{scholars}} {{believe that}} early Upanishads were interpolated and expanded over time. There are differences within manuscripts {{of the same}} Upanishad discovered {{in different parts of}} South Asia, differences in non-Sanskrit version of the texts that have survived, and differences within each text in terms of meter, style, grammar and structure.Patrick Olivelle (2014), The Early Upanishads, Oxford University Press, , pages 583-640F Rusza (2010), The authorlessness of the philosophical sūtras, Acta Orientalia, Volume 63, Number 4, pages 427-442 The existing texts are believed to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> many authors.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{account of}} the death of Magnus Erlendsson, Earl of Orkney, whose Latin original is lost but partially survives in an Icelandic translation was written by a 'Meistari Roðbert'.

5|$|The series {{centers on}} FBI special agents Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{and her new}} partner John Doggett (Robert Patrick)—following the alien {{abduction}} of her former partner, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny)—who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. In this episode, John Doggett, after having been assigned to the X-Files, joins Scully to investigate a series of gruesome murders that appear to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> a bat-like creature. This being their first case together, Scully and Doggett find that their investigative techniques are less than similar.|$|E
5|$|Alien {{opened in}} American theaters on May 25, 1979. The film had no formal premiere, yet moviegoers {{lined up for}} blocks to see it at Grauman's Egyptian Theatre in Hollywood where a number of models, sets, and props were {{displayed}} outside to promote it during its first run. Religious zealots {{set fire to the}} model of the space jockey, believing it to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> the devil. In the United Kingdom, Alien premiered at a gala performance at the Edinburgh Film Festival on September 1, 1979, before starting an exclusive run at the Odeon Leicester Square in London on September 6, 1979, but it did not open widely in Britain until January 13, 1980.|$|E
5|$|Jordan Black (Brittany Tiplady) is {{awakened by}} a nightmare, and is comforted by her father Frank Black (Lance Henriksen). However, Black is soon called to {{investigate}} {{the body of a}} woman at a dog pound in Portland, Oregon. Black works for the Millennium Group, an organisation which offers private investigation services and consults with law enforcement on certain types of cases. He is asked by Group member Jim Penseyres (Chris Ellis) to help a local detective on the murder case, as he is being considered as prospective member of the Millennium Group. Black believes the murder to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> a serial killer, and is convinced there will be a message from him on the bodies.|$|E

5|$|Mahatma Gandhi's life {{achievement}} stands {{unique in}} political history. He has invented {{a completely new}} and humane means for the liberation war of an oppressed country, and practised it with greatest energy and devotion. The moral influence he had on the consciously thinking human being of the entire civilised world will probably be much more lasting than it seems in our time with its overestimation of brutal violent forces. Because lasting will only <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> such statesmen who wake up and strengthen the moral power of their people through their example and educational works. We may all be happy and grateful that destiny gifted us with such an enlightened contemporary, {{a role model for}} the generations to come.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, in Raleigh, North Carolina, a {{young couple}} are kidnapped by a man dressed as a police officer. Several days later, Scully and her partner Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) discuss the case in Mulder's office at FBI headquarters. Mulder relates that the case seems to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> a repeat offender, and {{there is reason to}} believe the couple will be killed in a matter of days. He also tells Scully that Luther Lee Boggs (Brad Dourif), a serial killer he had helped to {{apprehend}} years before, has claimed to have had psychic revelations about the kidnapping and has offered to help police in exchange for his death sentence being commuted. Mulder is unusually skeptical about Boggs' claims.|$|E
5|$|The {{manuscript}} today comprises 340 folios and, since 1953, {{has been}} bound in four volumes. The leaves are on high-quality calf vellum, and the unprecedentedly elaborate ornamentation that covers them includes ten full-page illustrations and text pages that are vibrant with decorated initials and interlinear miniatures and mark the furthest {{extension of the}} anti-classical and energetic qualities of Insular art. The Insular majuscule script of the text itself appears to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> at least three different scribes. The lettering is in iron gall ink, and the colours used were derived {{from a wide range}} of substances, many of which were imports from distant lands.|$|E

5|$|Mother {{begins with}} the story of a young, married, American couple who mysteriously vanish from their small, rural town. Two years later, the husband, George, {{returned}} as mysteriously as he vanished, and began a strange study in complete seclusion. His wife, Maria, was never heard from again. Years later, in the late 1980s (dated specifically as 1988 in the Famicom version, but kept ambiguous in later releases), a young American boy named Ninten is attacked at home in a paranormal event. His father explains that Ninten's great-grandfather studied psychic powers, and asks Ninten to investigate a crisis occurring across the world, later revealed to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> an invading alien race. After finishing a few tasks, Ninten is warped to the world of Magicant, where the land's ruler, Queen Mary, asks Ninten to find her song, the Eight Melodies, and play them for her. Ninten returns to Earth and befriends a young boy, Lloyd, who is being teased at an elementary school. The two travel to the town of Snowman to deliver a lost hat to Ana, a young girl with psychic powers. Ana tells Ninten she saw him in a dream, and joins the party in hopes of finding her missing mother.|$|E
5|$|Other {{works were}} {{attributed}} to Egbert in the Middle Ages, {{but they are not}} regarded by modern scholars as authentic. These include a collection of church canons, as well as a penitential and a pontifical. The penitential, known as the Paenitentiale Ecgberhti, was ascribed to Ecgbert by the 8th or 9th centuries, but its surviving versions have little or no content that can be reliably traced to Ecgbert. The pontifical, known as the Pontificale Egberti, is thought to owe its attribution to Ecgbert's authorship {{to the fact that the}} penitential ascribed to Ecgbert was included within its contents. Lastly, the collection of church laws known previously as the Excerptiones Ecgberhti but today as the Collectio canonum Wigorniensis, has been shown to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> a later archbishop of York, Wulfstan, and was not connected with Ecgbert until after the Anglo-Saxon period. Besides these Latin works, an Old English text, known variously as the Scriftboc, Confessionale Pseudo-Egberti or Confessionale Egberti, was once stated to be a translation from Latin by Ecgbert, but is now known to date from the late 9th or 10th century.|$|E
5|$|Scully {{tells her}} {{version of the story}} via a {{flashback}} to the previous day. She arrives at work and Mulder tells her about a murder in Texas, which he believes to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> vampires. In her version, Mulder is exuberant, insensitive, and irritating, while she is calm and mindful of her thoughts. The agents travel to the small town of Chaney, Texas where they meet Sheriff Hartwell (Luke Wilson), whom Scully finds highly charming. Mulder and Hartwell leave to investigate further while Scully autopsies the body. She discovers that the victim, whose last meal had been pizza, was incapacitated with chloral hydrate. She returns to the motel room and orders a pizza, but Mulder soon appears and sends her back to autopsy another body. She leaves him just as her food is delivered. When she finds that the second victim had also ingested chloral hydrate in a pizza, she realizes Mulder is in danger and returns to the motel room. She finds him about to be attacked by the pizza delivery boy, Ronnie Strickland (Patrick Renna). She shoots at Ronnie, who runs off into the woods. When she catches up to him, Mulder has gotten there first and hammered a stake into Ronnie's heart.|$|E

25|$|On January 16, 1988, Rena Chapouris and Michael St. Hilaire {{were found}} dead {{within a few}} blocks of each other, in {{circumstances}} which appeared similar to the previous murders.

25|$|It is {{not universally}} {{accepted}} that <b>the</b> three killings <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same person.
