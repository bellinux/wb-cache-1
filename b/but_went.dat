5|$|A beefsteak {{is a type}} of banquet {{in which}} sliced beef {{tenderloin}} is served to diners as all-you-can-eat finger food. The dining style originated in 19th-century New York City as a type of working-class celebration <b>but</b> <b>went</b> into a decline in the mid-20th century. Resurrected by caterers in New Jersey, the beefsteak banquet style is now popular in that state's Bergen and Passaic counties, and is enjoying a revival in New York City, where the style originated, due to the reemergence of a biannual beefsteak in Brooklyn.|$|E

5|$|A {{photo of}} a dazed Tittle {{in the end zone}} taken by Morris Berman of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette on September 20, 1964, is {{regarded}} among the most iconic images in the history of American sports and journalism. Tittle, in his 17th and final season, was photographed helmet-less, bloodied and kneeling immediately after having been knocked to the ground by John Baker of the Pittsburgh Steelers and throwing an interception that was returned for a touchdown at the old Pitt Stadium. He suffered a concussion and cracked sternum on the play, <b>but</b> <b>went</b> on to play the rest of the season.|$|E

5|$|Arsenal, the {{defending}} champions, entered the match as favourites, <b>but</b> <b>went</b> behind early when Brian Stein scored. Luton's disciplined approach, {{coupled with a}} strong performance by Dibble, contained Arsenal to few chances throughout the game. The holders equalised and {{took the lead in}} quick succession through Martin Hayes and Alan Smith, but failed to seal the win when Nigel Winterburn missed a penalty. A revitalised Luton staged a late comeback; Caesar's failed clearance led to Danny Wilson equalising, and in the 90th minute, Brian Stein scored the winner after poor defending from Arsenal.|$|E

5|$|Stanford {{returned}} the game's opening kickoff to its 24-yard line, where the Cardinal offense began the game's first possession. On the game's first play, Stanford quarterback Andrew Luck ran 11yards through the Virginia Tech defense {{for a first}} down. The success was short-lived, however, as Stanford's next three plays did not gain enough ground for another first down, and the team punted from its 37-yard line. Virginia Tech's first possession was no more successful than Stanford's had been. The Hokies' offense entered the game at its 31-yard line after the punt, <b>but</b> <b>went</b> three-and-out after failing to gain a first down.|$|E
5|$|Tech {{took over}} at its 13-yard line {{following}} the 63-yard punt <b>but</b> <b>went</b> three {{and out and}} was itself forced to punt. Air Force's offense returned to the field at its 47-yard line after the kick. The Falcons picked up one first down, but the Tech defense stiffened and forced a fourth down. Needing just inches to gain a first down, Air Force elected to attempt to gain the needed yardage rather than punt the ball away. But before the Falcons could start the play, time ran out in the third quarter. With one quarter remaining, the Falcons still held a 107 lead.|$|E

Trying to grab the ball over his shoulder, he muffed the catch, and the ball bounced into the end zone, where it was recovered by Buffalo's Ray Anthony Long for a Bull touchdown. The special-teams miscue by Howard allowed Buffalo to tie the game at 10–10 with 11:36 remaining in the second quarter.|$|E
