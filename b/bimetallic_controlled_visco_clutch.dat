In this review we outline {{the current state of the}} art in research on selectivity in heterogeneous catalysis. Current in-situ surface science techniques have revealed several important features of catalytic selectivity. Sum frequency generation vibrational spectroscopy has shown us the importance of understanding the reaction intermediates and mechanism of a heterogeneous reaction, and can readily yield information as to the effect of temperature, pressure, catalyst geometry, surface promoters, and catalyst composition on the reaction mechanism. DFT calculations are quickly approaching the ability to assist in the interpretation of observed surface spectra, thereby making surface spectroscopy an even more powerful tool.

With a well-controlled surface composition, the nanocrystal NiCu 3 /C catalyst exhibited a maximum DMF yield of 98. 7 %. NAP-XPS characterization showed that the Ni–Cu nanocrystals were completely reduced below 250 °C in H 2; this, together with bulk thermodynamic calculations, implies that the catalysts were completely reduced under the reaction conditions.

Kinetically stabilized Cu@Pt core-shell nanoparticles were prepared by deposition of Pt onto Cu nanoparticles. The Cu@Pt particles exhibit high stability toward alloying upon annealing. In contrast, the Pt@Cu particles readily transform into alloy structures in the same conditions. This abnormal stability of the Cu@Pt particles is attributed to the Kirkendall mass transport effect, where the inherent diffusion direction from the Pt to Cu is hindered by a limited population of vacancies in the Cu cores.

40|$|Recently {{there has}} been renewed {{attention}} in dry reforming of methane (DRM) due to potential environmental benefits of utilizing CO 2 {{and an increase in}} demand for synthesis gas. DRM refers to the chemical reaction of methane and carbon dioxide to form hydrogen and carbon monoxide which are designated as synthetic gas (syngas). Syngas is primarily produced from a catalytic steam reforming process where the resulting H 2 /CO product ratio is higher than the ratio required for many down-stream processes. DRM produce a syngas with a H 2 /CO ratio close to unity, making it an ideal feed for the Fischer-Tropsch process and highly selective syntheses {{of a wide range of}} chemicals. The DRM utilizes CO 2 as an oxidant to react methane over a heterogeneous catalyst. Group VIII metal catalysts have been extensively studied for DRM. Both noble metals (e. g. Ru, Rh, Pt, Pd) and non-noble metals (e. g. Ni, Fe, Co) have been found to be catalytically active towards this reaction. The main problem in DRM is related to catalyst deactivation due to sintering and carbon deposition. Although noble metal based catalysts are usually highly active, stable at high temperatures and experience low carbon formation, they have the drawbacks of high cost and limited availability. Hence, a more promising alternative is to incorporate small amounts of noble metals into non-noble metal catalysts. Here, we report DRM over nickel alumina catalysts prepared by incipient wetness. The effect of modifying the catalyst with small amounts of Rh, Ru, Pt and Pd were studied. Two nickel catalysts on different alumina supports have also been investigated for comparison. The nickel loading was kept constant at 12 wt% for all the catalysts and the modified catalysts had a loading of 12 wt% Ni and 0. 5 wt% noble metal. The characteristics of the catalysts were investigated by X-Ray diffraction (XRD), textural measurements, active metal dispersion and temperature-programmed reduction. Results from the XRD showed that the particle size was affected by the support and reduced by the noble metals. The textural measurement indicated similar surface area, were a slight reduction was observed for the modified catalysts. Indications from the TPR analysis suggested that characteristics of the support has a high impact on the reducibility of Ni based catalysts. The activity and stability was investigated in a fixed-bed stainless steel reactor. The catalysts were activated at 600 oC and the DRM reactions were carried out at 700 oC at equimolar reactant feed and a gas hour space velocity of 120, 000 Scm 3 g- 1 h- 1. The stability of the catalyst was investigated for 15 hours. The activity was found to be dependent on the support and improvements were observed for the catalysts modified with Rh, Pt and Ru, while Pd showed reduced activity. In addition, the Rh modified catalyst was investigated at 650 and 600 oC to determine the effect of temperature. The deactivation rate and H 2 /CO ratio was found to decrease with temperature, which contradicts thermodynamic equilibrium calculations.

While significant breakthroughs have been made, particularly in the area of monometallic nanoparticles with regard to shape and size, relating the bimetallic structure, i. e., core@shell or alloy to a specific reactivity remains a difficult task. Work presented in this thesis describes the synthesis, characterization and catalytic properties of mono and bimetallic nanoparticles. Our efforts were motivated by the desire to understand the relationships that exist between metallic nanoparticle structure and their function as catalysts. This work also seeks to better understand the dynamic changes a nanoparticle's structure undergoes during typical catalytic operating conditions. Our approach is to use a wide array of analytical tools including optical methods, electron microscopy, XRD and mass spectrometry to provide an interlocking description of nanoparticle structure, function and durability. We show how the polymer coatings and degraded carbonaceous deposits affect propene hydrogenation catalytic activity of Pt nanoparticles. We also present a unique view of the interplay between thermodynamic and kinetic variables that <b>control</b> <b>bimetallic</b> nanoparticle alloy structures by looking at ordered and disordered PdCu alloy nanoparticles as a function of particle size. In another study we show that Ru@Pt and PtRu alloy nanoparticle catalysts have similar surface structures under oxidizing conditions but completely different surface structures under reducing conditions as probed by vibrational spectroscopy. These differences and similarities in surface composition correlate very well to their catalytic activity for CO oxidation under oxidizing and reducing environments, respectively. Finally, we present the synthesis and characterization of Cu@Pt nanoparticles with a particular focus on the core@shell formation mechanism.

Unfortunately, sintering of nanoparticles usually occurs in reaction conditions leading to particle growth {{and eventually to}} a degradation of physical properties. Encapsulations of metal particles in a microporous support have been presented as a solution against sintering since the porous scaffold may limit particle diffusion and eventually their coalescence. However, the efficiency {{of this approach is}} limited as the size of the pore is usually larger than the size of the particle. Furthermore diffusional limitation becomes very likely when sub-nanometric microporous support are in play. Recent developments in zeolite materials with hierarchical porous structures for which the mean diffusion path is considerably reduced offers new perspectives in Catalysis by metals. We present general concepts for the synthesis of hollow zeolites and original hollow silicalite- 1 and ZSM- 5 single crystals with thin and controlled shell thickness [1 - 3]. We will describe a generic process for synthesizing bimetallic nanoparticles encapsulated in hollow zeolites, yielding yolk-shell type materials. The originality of the synthesis design is that the hollow zeolites act as nanoreactors in which the bimetallic particles are formed. The here presented process allows controlling the size (2 - 10 nm) and compositions of NPs which are factors that ultimately determine the catalytic properties [4]. A series of mono- (Au, Pd, Pt) or bi- (AuAg, PdAg, PtAg and PdPt) metallic nanoparticles individually encapsulated in hollow silicalite- 1 single crystals have been prepared and characterized.

Lignocellulosic biomass is structurally diverse and therefore requires detailed understanding of the thermal depolymerization and catalytic hydrodeoxygenation reactions to optimize the overall process. This dissertation describes the experimental work using model compounds to elucidate the role of <b>bimetallic</b> catalyst and <b>control</b> the reaction operating parameters such as temperature and hydrogen pressure to maximize energy recovery in the liquid product from biomass resource. ^ Water-gas shift (WGS) is a well-known reaction to produce hydrogen and finds application industrially in steam-reforming of methane and other fossil-based feedstocks. Traditionally, gas-phase WGS has been studied on noble metal based catalysts in experimental conditions relevant to reforming of methane. Recently, aqueous-phase reforming of oxygenated organic compounds has been considered {{to be one of the}} promising routes to produce hydrogen from sustainable biomass derivatives. One of the hypothesis in that study was that WGS played a vital role in production of hydrogen and thus it is important to quantify and qualify the contribution of WGS under aqueous reforming conditions. Platinum (Pt) and platinum-molybdenum (Pt-Mo) catalysts supported on multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) were chosen since they were studied previously for aqueous-phase reforming of glycerol. Under these conditions, kinetics of WGS were significantly altered, especially CO order which is ∼ 0. 9 compared to ∼ 0. 1 for gas-phase WGS. Furthermore, Mo is shown to alter the kinetics of WGS reaction in a similar way both in gas and liquid-phase WGS. ^ Fast-hydropyrolysis followed by in-line catalytic hydrodeoxygenation has been shown to have the potential to produce hydrocarbon fuels using hydrogen as co-feed. The objective of the research project was to identify and quantify the primary products of fast hydropyrolysis as well as establish the effect of temperature on overall product distribution. A torch igniter typically used in rocket engines was modified to design a reactor that is able to continuously feed biomass at a g min- 1 scale and complete the entire process from fast hydropyrolysis to condensation of bio-oil in a matter of 3 ̆c 70 ms at 3. 6 MPa hydrogen pressure. Levoglucosan, cellobiosan, glycolaldehyde and glucopyranosyl-β-aldehyde were the major products from cellulose pyrolysis at 500 °C. As hydropyrolysis temperature was increased in the range of 500 to 700 °C, the bio-oil product distribution shifted toward C 2 -C 5 light oxygenates. The identification and quantification of products with molecular weight higher than the monomer (levoglucosan) at 70 ms residence time compared to their absence in reactors with residence time of 2 - 3 s indicate that levoglucosan is not the sole primary product of cellulose pyrolysis. Thus a portion of levoglucosan is a result of dimer (cellobiosan) and trimer (cellotriosan) degradation. ^ Hydropyrolysis of cellulose resulted in a product distribution that retained most of the oxygen from parent cellulose. Catalytic hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) therefore assumes the vital part of selectively removing that oxygen as water and thus transforming the oxygenated organic compounds to fungible hydrocarbon fuels. Furfural and dihydroeugenol were the chosen model compounds to represent cellulose and lignin fraction of biomass. Discerning the role of catalyst descriptors and hydrogen pressure were the main objectives of the study.

40|$|Surface structure, mobility, and {{composition}} of transition metal catalysts were studied by high-pressure scanning tunneling microscopy (HP-STM) and ambient-pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (AP-XPS) at high gas pressures. HP-STM {{makes it possible to}} determine the atomic or molecular rearrangement at catalyst surfaces, particularly at the low-coordinated active surface sites. AP-XPS monitors changes in elemental composition and chemical states of catalysts in response to variations in gas environments. Stepped Pt and Cu single crystals, the hexagonally reconstructed Pt(100) single crystal, and Pt-based <b>bimetallic</b> nanoparticles with <b>controlled</b> size, shape {{and composition}}, were employed as the model catalysts for experiments in this thesis. Surface reconstruction at low-coordinated step sites at high gas pressures was first explored on a stepped Pt(557) single crystal surface under O 2. At 298 K, 1 Torr of O 2 is able to create nanometer-sized clusters that are identified as surface Pt oxide by AP-XPS, which covers the entire Pt(557) surface. On the flat Pt(111) surface under 1 Torr of O 2, Pt oxide clusters can form but are mostly accumulated within 2 nm from the steps. The hexagonal oxygen chemisorption pattern is observed on the terraces. At lower pressures such as 10 - 7 Torr, O 2 only adsorbs at the step edges on Pt(557). The majority of the Pt oxide clusters disappear on both Pt(557) and Pt(111) surfaces after O 2 is evacuated to the 10 - 8 Torr range. Quantitative XPS analysis with depth profiles indicates that the Pt oxide formed on Pt(557) is less than 0. 6 nm thick and that the Pt oxide concentration at surface together with oxygen coverage varies reversibly with the O 2 pressure. The disappearance of Pt oxide clusters upon O 2 evacuation is ascribed to reactions of Pt oxide towards H 2 and CO in the vacuum background gases. The structure and surface chemistry of the Pt(557) surface was therefore studied under H 2 -O 2 and CO-O 2 mixtures. After exposing Pt(557) to approximately 1 Torr of O 2 to induce the formation of Pt oxide clusters, H 2 was slowly added into the system. Both HP-STM and AP-XPS results show that the Pt oxide coverage decreases with the H 2 partial pressure and that all the Pt oxide disappears at H 2 partial pressures above 43 mTorr. Pt steps are restored with the removal of Pt oxide clusters. Water is produced in the gas-phase, which co-adsorbs with hydroxyl species on Pt(557). Detailed analysis shows that the consumption of surface Pt oxide is exclusively responsible for the decrease of oxygen coverage on Pt(557). In the coexistence of 1 Torr of CO and 1 Torr of O 2, Pt oxide clusters are not observed like under the H 2 -O 2 mixture. Instead, triangular Pt clusters and double-sized terraces induced by CO are observed. Influences of step configuration on the surface restructuring processes were studied on Pt(557) and Pt(332) that differ only in the step orientation. 500 mTorr of CO creates Pt clusters shaped as triangles and parallelograms on Pt(557) and Pt(332), respectively. When 500 mTorr of C 2 H 4 was introduced afterwards, Pt clusters are removed on Pt(332) but preserved on Pt(557). The three-fold hollow sites at the (111) steps enable the Pt(332) surface to accommodate ethylidyne even covered by CO. As a result, kink Pt atoms at the cluster edges are driven to diffuse to form straight steps, so as to admit more ethylidyne at steps. In contrast, Pt(557) has (100) steps on which ethylidyne does not adsorb, therefore keeping the island structure after the introduction of C 2 H 4. When 500 mTorr of C 2 H 4 was added first into the high-pressure cell, a periodic pattern is resolved at step edges on Pt(332). In contrast, some bright species separated by more than 1 nm are observed on Pt(557). Further introducing 500 mTorr of CO does not facilitate the formation of Pt clusters. The structure and mobility under C 2 H 4, H 2, and CO were also studied on the Pt(100) surface, whose topmost layer is rearranged into a hexagonal overlayer in vacuum. Under 1 Torr of C 2 H 4, the hexagonal reconstruction is preserved on Pt(100), which is covered by highly mobile adsorbates. Pt atoms on the hexagonal layer can also move {{as a result of the}} weakened interaction between the surface layer and the bulk. The mobility is enhanced under 1 Torr of 1 : 1 C 2 H 4 -H 2 mixture because the Pt(100) -hex surface is active in ethylene hydrogenation. The surface mobility along with the catalytic reaction is quenched after introducing 3 mTorr of CO. Meanwhile, the hexagonal reconstruction is lifted by the adsorption of CO. At 5 × 10 - 6 Torr of C 2 H 4, CO from background gases can also adsorb on Pt(100), creating Pt islands that do not revert to the hexagonal surface when the C 2 H 4 pressure was further increased to 1 Torr. In order to understand the effect of substrates on surface reconstruction, the structure of the stepped Cu(557) surface was monitored in equilibrium with high pressures of gases. Cu generally binds to the reducing gases such as CO, H 2, and C 2 H 4 weaker than Pt, leading to a lower coverage on Cu than on Pt at the same gas pressure. Accordingly, 12 Torr of CO is required to induce clusters on Cu(557), because higher CO pressures are needed to keep a sufficient amount of CO that can stabilize clusters. At 1 Torr, large terraces with an average width of 23 nm are observed on Cu(557), because of the low diffusion barrier for Cu atoms both on terraces and along the steps. 500 mTorr of H 2 results in step coalescence on Cu(557), giving rise to 6 nm wide terraces. C 2 H 4 adsorption at 500 mTorr results in 5 nm large clusters. CO does not change the Cu(557) surface structure while adding into C 2 H 4, but causes the appearance of large terraces while co-adsorbing with H 2. Under oxidizing gases, for example 1 Torr of O 2, the Cu(557) surface is significantly oxidized, forming thick layers of Cu oxide. Pt-based bimetallic nanoparticle catalysts were also investigated with AP-XPS under reaction conditions to study their surface chemistry. PtFe nanoparticles do not undergo any surface segregation at 298 K when the gas environment changes, but surface Fe atoms are partially reduced under the C 2 H 4 -H 2 mixture and partially oxidized under O 2. Neither does the surface composition of Pt 9 Co-Co core-shell nanoparticles change while heating under H 2 even to 673 K nor do oxidation states. In Pt-Ni systems, at 393 K, Ni is oxidized under O 2 and migrates to the surface because Ni is more susceptible to oxidation than Pt. In contrast, when the surface is reduced by H 2, Pt segregates to the surface since the surface free energy of Pt is lower. Such segregation does not occur at 353 K owing to the low atomic mobility in lattice...|$|R
