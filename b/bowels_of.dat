By 08:00, Africaine was a dismasted hull and Corbet was dead in the <b>bowels</b> <b>of</b> the ship, although the exact manner of his death was to cause lasting controversy. By 10:00, Boadicea had been joined by Otter and Staunch and bore down on the French ships and their prize, so that by 15:30 Bouvet was persuaded to abandon Africaine and tow the damaged Iphigénie back to Port Napoleon. By 17:00, Boadicea pulled alongside Africaine and the French prize crew surrendered. Rowley later reported that a number of British sailors leaped into the sea at his approach and swam to Boadicea, requesting that they be allowed to pursue the French ships in the hope of capturing one.|$|E
5|$|In a later {{version of}} the film, Auto comes to the docking bay to {{retrieve}} EVE's plant. The film would have its first cutaway to the captain, but Stanton moved that as he found it too early to begin moving away from WALL-E's point-of-view. As an homage to Get Smart, Auto takes the plant and goes into the <b>bowels</b> <b>of</b> the ship into a room resembling a brain where he watches videos of Buy n Large's scheme {{to clean up the}} Earth falling apart through the years. Stanton removed this to keep some mystery as to why the plant is taken from EVE. The captain appears to be unintelligent, but Stanton wanted him to just be unchallenged; otherwise he would have been unempathetic. One example of how unintelligent the captain was depicted initially is that he was seen to wear his hat upside-down, only to fix it before he challenges Auto. In the finished film, he merely wears it casually atop his head, tightening it when he assumes real command of the Axiom.|$|E

The Gravemind reveals to the Arbiter that the Great Journey would destroy Flood, humans, and Covenant altogether, and sends both the Arbiter and Master Chief to different places to stop Halo's activation. The Master Chief is teleported into High Charity, where a civil war has broken out among the Covenant; In Amber Clad crashes into the city, and Cortana realizes that Gravemind used them as a distraction to infest In Amber Clad and spread the Flood. As the parasite overruns the city, consuming the Prophet of Mercy in the process, the Prophet of Truth orders Tartarus to take Keyes, Johnson, and Guilty Spark to Halo's control room and activate the ring. The Master Chief follows Truth aboard a Forerunner ship leaving the city; Cortana remains behind to destroy High Charity and Halo if Tartarus succeeds in activating the ring.|$|E

Later on, as Cate and Dr. Schenker {{fly back to}} England, he is {{captured}} by H.A.R.M., led by Magnus Armstrong, who knocks Cate unconscious. Armstrong decides to spare Cate's life, believing {{that she is a}} fellow Scot. Cate awakens and is soon thrown from the plane as it explodes. After surviving the fall via parachute, Cate is later introduced to a new partner, Tom Goodman, a UNITY agent from the American branch. After meeting him in a nightclub in Hamburg, they are ambushed by H.A.R.M. but manage to escape. The nightclub is owned by a German singer named Inge Wagner, whom Cate suspects is connected with H.A.R.M. The two are then tasked to investigate a cargo freighter containing several suspicious chemical containers that UNITY believes are linked to Dr. Schenker. Cate gets in the freighter, and after taking photos of the containers, is knocked unconscious by Armstrong, who spares her life by locking her in a cargo hold, thus ignoring Wagner's insistence that she must be liquidated. As the freighter heads out to sea, it slowly begins to sink, due to a huge explosion. Wagner and Armstrong escape immediately, but Cate has to fight her way out of the <b>bowels</b> <b>of</b> the freighter. Because Cate could not obtain the required information, she and Tom must return to the sunken freighter to finish gathering intelligence aboard. Cate goes scuba diving, and after investigating the shipwreck and obtaining the captain's log and the cargo manifest, she is ambushed by H.A.R.M. divers sent from a submarine commanded by Armstrong and Wagner but manages to escape.|$|E

40|$|Acute {{neonatal}} malnutrition alters lumenal glycoproteins {{as demonstrated}} by altered lectin binding. To {{determine the effect of}} a 72 -h fast on lumenal glycolipids, specifically the monosialoganglioside GM 1, we quantitated cholera toxin (CT) binding and adenylate cyclase activity. The calculated number of specific sites for CT binding to microvillus membrane (MVM) from newborn rabbits fasted for 72 h was decreased in MVM from proximal small bowel (7 +/- 0. 8 x 10 (8) /micrograms protein) compared to 72 -h control neonatal rabbits (18 +/- 3. 3 x 10 (8) micrograms protein). In distal small bowel {{there was no difference in}} the calculated receptor sites/micrograms MVM protein between fasted (8 +/- 1. 7 x 10 (8)) and fed (11 +/- 4 x 10 (8)) groups. MVM prepared from proximal small <b>bowel</b> <b>of</b> fed animals bound significantly more CT than MVM prepared from distal small <b>bowel</b> <b>of</b> fed animals. The affinity for CT was the same in all MVM preparations. Neuraminidase treatment of MVM resulted in increased CT binding in fed and fasted rabbit proximal and distal MVM preparations, but the greatest increase occurred in MVM prepared from proximal small bowel from fasted animals. There was no difference in adenylate cyclase activity in fed, fasted, and proximal or distal small bowel crude membrane preparations. Refeeding (120 h) resulted in normalization of CT binding in MVM from proximal small <b>bowel</b> <b>of</b> fasted animals. We conclude a 72 -h fast in neonatal rabbits resulted in decreased regional CT binding in MVM prepared from proximal small <b>bowel</b> <b>of</b> fasted animals, but no change in adenylate cyclase activity. Refeeding reverses CT binding abnormalities...|$|R

Twenty preterm infants with a gestational age of 33 weeks or less who were resident on a neonatal unit were studied from the initiation of milk feeds until discharge. The infants were randomised to receive either milk feeds or milk feeds supplemented with Lactobacillus GG 10 (8) colony forming units twice a day for two weeks. The clinical features of the two groups of infants were similar. Orally administered Lactobacillus GG was well tolerated and did colonise the <b>bowel</b> <b>of</b> premature infants. However, colonisation with Lactobacillus GG did not reduce the faecal reservoir of potential pathogens and there was no evidence that colonisation had any positive clinical benefit for this particular group of infants...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIntroductionPortal {{hypertension}} (PH) {{is characterized}} by vasodilatation in the portal system and the <b>bowel</b> is one <b>of</b> the severely affected organs. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is a molecule with important properties and widely used in clinical practice. ObjectiveTo evaluate NAC action in the <b>bowel</b> <b>of</b> animals submitted to the animal model of partial portal vein ligation (PPVL). Methods 18 male Wistar rats were divided into three experimental groups (n= 6) : sham-operated (SO), PPVL, and PPVL+NAC. On the 8 th day after surgery, N-acetylcysteine (10 mg/kg, ip) was administered daily for 7 days. On the 15 th day the animals’ bowel was collected for oxidative stress analysis, immunohistochemistry and Western blot. We evaluated the expression of NF-KB and TNF-α by immunohistochemistry and of iNOS by Western blot. Lipid peroxidation was assessed by TBARS technique, and the activities of antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutation peroxidase (GPx) were checked. ResultsWe observed an increased expression of NF-KB and TNF-α in PPVL group, and an increased iNOS expression assessed by Western blot. NAC reduced the expression of all proteins evaluated. We also observed an increase in oxidative stress in the <b>bowel</b> <b>of</b> mice PPVL group compared to controls (SO), and NAC was effective in reducing these values in PPVL+NAC group. Also, {{a reduction in the}} activity of SOD and GPx enzymes was observed in the diseased group, and NAC was able to restore the activity of the enzymes assessed. ConclusionWe suggest the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant action of NAC in the <b>bowel</b> <b>of</b> animals submitted to PPVL model...|$|R
