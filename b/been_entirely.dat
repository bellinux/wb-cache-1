5|$|The {{receding}} {{coast line}} continued to threaten Sandgate Castle, and severe storms in 1927 and 1950 undermined {{large parts of}} the castle. By the time that a new seawall was built in the early 1950s, the southern third of the castle had <b>been</b> <b>entirely</b> destroyed.|$|E

5|$|Waymon then {{applied for}} a {{scholarship}} to study at the prestigious Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, where she was denied despite a well-received audition. Waymon became fully convinced this rejection had <b>been</b> <b>entirely</b> due to racial discrimination. Years later, two days before her death, the Curtis Institute of Music bestowed on her an honorary degree.|$|E
5|$|According {{to reports}} in The Sun, the {{following}} day at 3:00pm, those who were left of the original 6th Regiment disbanded. No official order was given to this effect, but their duties had by this point <b>been</b> <b>entirely</b> assumed by federal troops, the soldiers of the 5th, and the newly formed 7th and 8th. The armory of the 6th remained guarded by a single police officer.|$|E
5|$|Aetosaur remains {{have been}} found since the early 19th century, {{although}} the very first remains that were described were mistaken for fish scales. Aetosaurs were later recognized as crocodile relatives, with early paleontologists considering them to be semiaquatic scavengers. They are now considered to have <b>been</b> <b>entirely</b> terrestrial animals. Some forms have characteristics {{that may have been}} adaptations to digging for food. There is also evidence that some if not all aetosaurs made nests.|$|E

40|$|A plane graph <b>is</b> called <b>entirely</b> k-choosable if, for any list {{assignment}} L {{such that}} |L(x) | = k for each x ∈ V (G) ∪ E(G) ∪ F (G), we can assign each element x a color from its list such that any two {{elements that are}} adjacent or incident receive distinct colors. Wang and Lih [13] conjectured that every plane graph <b>is</b> <b>entirely</b> (∆ + 4) -choosable. They showed that every plane graph with ∆ ≥ 12 <b>is</b> <b>entirely</b> (∆ + 4) -choosable and that every plane graph with ∆ ≥ 9 <b>is</b> <b>entirely</b> (∆ + 5) -choosable.

5|$|In 1900, Dunne {{moved to}} New York. Dooley's musings, since the war, had <b>been</b> <b>entirely</b> on affairs outside Chicago, with no Bridgeport columns, as Dunne needed {{to satisfy the}} demands of a {{national}} audience. In January 1900, just before he left the Journal, he wrote a Bridgeport piece, in which many of the earlier ones were recalled. This was the last Dooley piece written for a newspaper not to be syndicated; it appeared exclusively in the Journal.|$|E
5|$|It {{was some}} time {{afterward}} when the thought flashed upon {{my mind that}} the disturbances I had observed {{might be due to}} an intelligent control. Although I could not decipher their meaning, it was impossible for me to think of them as having <b>been</b> <b>entirely</b> accidental. The feeling is constantly growing on me that I had been the first to hear the greeting of one planet to another.|$|E

5|$|Since its {{creation}} following the 1930 census, the 12th district had been represented by Democrats. The 12th stretched from {{just south of}} Pasadena to the Orange and San Bernardino county lines, encompassing such small towns as Whittier, Pomona and Covina. The area has since <b>been</b> <b>entirely</b> absorbed into the Los Angeles megalopolis, {{but at the time}} it was principally agricultural. The freeway system had barely touched the 12th district; only a small segment of the Pasadena Freeway cut across its northwest corner.|$|E
5|$|The red ruffed lemur and the {{black-and-white}} ruffed lemur were formerly recognized as subspecies, Varecia variegata rubra and Varecia variegata variegata respectively. In 2001 both were elevated to species status, {{a decision that}} was later supported by genetic research. Three subspecies of black-and-white ruffed lemur, which had been published decades earlier, were also recognized as variegata, editorum, and subcincta, although studies have not <b>been</b> <b>entirely</b> conclusive.|$|E
5|$|Under {{pressure}} from Philip III of France and other rulers, on September 1, 1271, the cardinals agreed to cede their authority to {{a committee of}} six. The committee included two cardinals of the faction of Orsini (Giovanni Gaetano Orsini and Giacomo Savelli), three Ghibelines (Simone Paltinieri, Ottaviano Ubaldini and Guy de Castella) and Cardinal Riccardo Annibaldi, while Angevin cardinals seem to have <b>been</b> <b>entirely</b> marginalized.|$|E

5|$|William's {{choice of}} Pevensey as a {{defensive}} location may not have <b>been</b> <b>entirely</b> due to practical military reasons. It also had political connotations, implying that the Normans were on a level with the Romans. He followed a similar pattern elsewhere in England, building the Tower of London alongside the still-extant Roman city wall and constructing Colchester Castle {{on top of the}} ruins of the Temple of Claudius.|$|E
5|$|Between 1945 and 1950 the US {{fleet of}} battleships had <b>been</b> <b>entirely</b> decommissioned; however, Missouri was spared this fate {{due to the}} {{influence}} of President Harry S. Truman, a native Missourian, who refused to allow the battleship to be decommissioned, and against the advice of Secretary of Defense Louis Johnson, Secretary of the Navy John L. Sullivan, and Chief of Naval Operations Louis E. Denfeld, Truman ordered Missouri to be maintained with the active fleet partly because of his fondness for the battleship and partly because the battleship had been christened by his daughter. As a result, Missouri was involved in various training and flag waving exercises at home and abroad between World War II and the Korean War.|$|E
5|$|By the 21st century {{many of the}} Device Forts {{had been}} damaged by, {{or in some cases}} lost entirely, to coastal erosion; the problem had existed at some {{locations}} since the 16th century and still persists, for example at Hurst. East Cowes Castle and East Tilbury Fort have <b>been</b> <b>entirely</b> lost, while the East Blockhouse, Mersea and Sandsfoot have been badly damaged, a third of Sandgate and most of St Andrews have been washed away. Other sites were demolished, built upon or simply eroded over time; almost no trace remains of the bulwarks along the Downs, for example. The remaining sites are protected by UK conservation law, either as scheduled monuments or listed buildings.|$|E

5|$|Great Britain VIII was a nine-day railtour from London to Cornwall, Scotland {{and back}} to London. Various steam {{locomotives}} were scheduled to haul the train on {{each day of the}} tour, which was to have <b>been</b> <b>entirely</b> steam hauled. Participants paid between £1,995 and £2,895 per person for the nine-day tour. Despite fears that the tour would be cancelled, it was run although with changes to the locomotives hauling it. DB Schenker agreed to operate the first two days of the tour. The tour suffered a number of issues including steam locomotives being replaced by diesels, and a lack of train heating; these resulted in a significant number of passengers leaving the tour early.|$|E
5|$|In 2002 the University of Leicester Archaeological Services {{decided to}} {{excavate}} the presumed {{location of the}} abbey's kitchens, to clarify the layout of that area of the abbey. These first excavations located both {{the north and south}} walls and a 15th–16th-century brick oven, confirming that it was indeed the kitchens. The area excavated was enlarged in 2003, with the south-west corner of the building and a second oven uncovered: this corner had not <b>been</b> <b>entirely</b> robbed of stone, with two courses of sandstone remaining. The second oven was found to contain charcoal, fragments of wheat and barley, fish-bones and hazelnuts. A drain identified in the 1930s excavation was also located, and found to contain small bones, fish-scales, and the bones of rats who had formerly lived in the drain.|$|E
5|$|Khrushchev greatly {{improved}} relations with Yugoslavia, which had <b>been</b> <b>entirely</b> sundered in 1948 when Stalin {{realized he could}} not control Yugoslav leader Josip Tito. Khrushchev led a Soviet delegation to Belgrade in 1955. Though a hostile Tito did {{everything he could to}} make the Soviets look foolish (including getting them drunk in public), Khrushchev was successful in warming relations, ending the Informbiro period in Soviet-Yugoslav relations. During the Hungarian crisis, Tito initially supported Nagy, but Khrushchev persuaded him of the need for intervention. Still, the intervention in Hungary damaged Moscow's relationship with Belgrade, which Khrushchev spent several years trying to repair. He was hampered by the fact that China disapproved of Yugoslavia's liberal version of communism, and attempts to conciliate Belgrade resulted in an angry Beijing.|$|E
