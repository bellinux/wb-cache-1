30|$|Using the LM 2 C server, the OnCampus {{architecture}} {{regulates the}} process of data transfer between servers and clients to support system services. The communication process for establishing location-based instant messaging between clients and the two-tier servers is illustrated in Fig. 2. A client submits location information to LSS after connecting with it. LSS will then provide feedback {{on a set of}} data, including attributes of the surrounding area, MSS identifiers, as well as the corresponding relations of connection permission. After receiving the data, the client needs to determine the assigned MSS and wait to receive permission from the MSS to broadcast. The MSS adds the client to the <b>broadcast</b> <b>list</b> and then delivers permission-related information to the client. Messages will only be conveyed to clients who are included in the user list of a specified MSS. When a client on the user list of a particular MSS is out of the range of this MSS, the connection between the client and the MSS will be terminated and a connection request will be made to another MSS without communicating with the LSS.|$|E

40|$|Location Aided Broadcast Protocol (SLABP), is {{put forward}} in this paper.

There is only one node selected for carrying out broadcast within a given grid. A detailed explanation of SLABP algorithm is presented. The simulation results have shown improved performance of SLABP in many aspects. I...|$|R
