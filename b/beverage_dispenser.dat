The companies had designed special cans (officially the Carbonated <b>Beverage</b> <b>Dispenser</b> Evaluation payload or CBDE) to test packaging and dispensing techniques {{for use in}} zero G conditions.

In 1958, Mazo-Lerch held the first food show, {{and was one}} of the first distributors to offer both custom-cut meats and <b>beverage</b> <b>dispenser</b> programs. The diversification trend continued over the years, as foodservice distributors provided disposable items such as paper napkins and tablecloths, followed by china and glassware, then light and heavy equipment.|$|E

50|$|While STS-51-F's primary payload was the Spacelab 2 {{laboratory}} module, the payload {{that received}} the most publicity was the Carbonated <b>Beverage</b> <b>Dispenser</b> Evaluation, which was an experiment in which both Coca-Cola and Pepsi tried to make their carbonated drinks available to astronauts. A helium-cooled infrared telescope (IRT) was also flown on this mission, and while it did have some problems, it observed 60% of the galactic plane.|$|E

50|$|Started in 1947 {{as a small}} {{metalworking}} {{shop that}} made metal water coolers for blue collar workers, Igloo Products is now a leading ice chest and <b>beverage</b> <b>dispenser</b> manufacturer, perhaps known best for its Playmate brand. The company's first all-plastic ice chest was introduced in 1962. Igloo makes the coolers for personal and industrial use and claims that nearly three in every four US households owns an Igloo cooler. The company's more than 500 products (including personal, beverage, and full-sized coolers) are sold through more than 250 retailers in the US and abroad. Private investment firm Westar Capital purchased Igloo from Brunswick in 2001. J.H. Whitney & Company became the new majority owner in 2008. In March 2014, ACON, a Washington, D.C.-based private equity firm, purchased Igloo from J.H. Whitney, which will maintain a small stake in the Company.|$|E

40|$|Project (M. S., Computer Engineering) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2010. Beer foam is a {{major source}} of waste in most bars today. An average bar will lose close to 10, 000 a year due to beer waste. Automated Beverage Dispensers attempt to {{eliminate}} this waste, however most fail due to the inability to prevent excess amounts of beer foam during pouring of a beer. The root cause of beer foam is best described by Henry???s Law which describes the relationship between the solubility of a gas in a liquid due to temperature and pressure. 	Automated Beverage Dispensers currently regulate pressure however they do not control the beverage temperature; this must be regulated in order to eliminate beer foam. The beverage temperature can be regulated by an Automated <b>Beverage</b> <b>Dispenser</b> {{through the use of a}} custom computer controlled heat exchanging system. This heat exchanging system combines hardware, software, and mechanical components in a way that is energy efficient, environmentally safe, and cost effective. In the context of an Automated <b>Beverage</b> <b>Dispenser</b> this integrated solution holds temperature and pressure constant thus eliminating beer waste due to foam. Computer Engineerin...|$|E

40|$|Cold {{beverage}} dispensers {{belong to}} the group of light commercial refrigeration machines that includes beverage coolers, ice machines and storage units for food items. Beverage dispensers use a vapor compression system to charge a thermal storage, usually an ice bank, which is used to indirectly cool tap water and beverage concentrate. For these machines, R 290 (propane) and R 744 (carbon dioxide) are among the favorite candidates to completely replace high GWP HFC refrigerants in the future. Because of flammability and charge restrictions for R 290, carbon dioxide is in some cases preferred even if some of its thermodynamic and transport properties are less favorable than those of R 290, especially at high ambient temperature. This study evaluated the performance of a baseline R 134 a <b>beverage</b> <b>dispenser</b> machine by experimentally measuring initial pull down time and energy consumption during compressor cycling operation at 24 Â°C and 38 Â°C ambient temperatures, respectively. Another important performance criteria for dispensers is the burst capacity, which is the number of 350 ml drinks dispensed at the rate of 3 drinks per minute while maintaining a beverage temperature below 5 Â°C. This test simulates the typical load profile of the machine during peak serving time in hotels and motels. Burst capacity is closely related to thermal storage capacity and therefore the ice amount was also closely monitored. The machineâ€™s refrigeration system was afterwards converted to R 744 refrigerant, using a transcritical cycle. Special attention was given to optimization of capillary tube size, refrigerant charge amount and gas cooler design where the strongest impact on the performance at different ambient temperatures was expected. Appropriate instrumentation and theoretical analysis helped to identify optimum selection of capillary tube and R 744 refrigerant charge. The optimized R 744 system used 385 g of charge and pulled down in approximately half the time and dispensed at least 25 % more drinks while keeping the energy consumption comparable with its baseline R 134 a system. Slight increase in gas cooler cost was well overcome by the benefits of larger burst capacity and significantly shorter pull down time allowing: the redesigned <b>beverage</b> <b>dispenser</b> can be kept off longer and needs to be turned on shortly before the serving time...|$|E

50|$|In 1935, Campagna {{participated in}} the Outfit {{infiltration}} of the Chicago Bartenders & <b>Beverage</b> <b>Dispensers</b> Union. In 1940, the union head obtained a temporary injunction against Campagna and other Outfit members. However, when the case went to trial, the union leader refused to testify and case was dismissed. In 1943, Campagna and his associates stole about $900,000 from the treasury of the Retail Clerks International Protective Association, Local 1248, in Chicago. The funds were never recovered.|$|R
50|$|In 1993, {{branches}} {{were formed}} elsewhere in Colombia (including Bogota) {{to increase the}} company's nationwide presence. In 1998, shopping freezers and <b>beverage</b> <b>dispensers</b> were added to Haceb Industries' cooling-appliance line; in addition, the range of gas appliances was expanded to meet the high demand for gas cookers in Colombia. These products also received Icontec certification. In 1999, a new organisational model was launched, allowing the company to increase the focus on its commercial business and expand its portfolio of products. The award of Best After Sales Service Portfolio (1999), a national award, recognised the company's leadership in its business field. In 2000, the company implemented its Call Centre, a centralised service which aimed to provide a quick response {{to the needs of}} clients across the country; in the same year, the company was restructured in concentric fashion, allowing corporate culture and multi-tasking to grow stronger.|$|R
50|$|JJSF markets frozen {{beverages}} primarily {{under the}} names ICEE, SLUSH PUPPIE and PARROT ICE in the United States, Mexico and Canada. Frozen beverages {{are sold in}} the Frozen Beverages segment found in foodservice and retail sectors.

JJSF supplies customers with ingredients required for production of the frozen beverages, and supports retail sales efforts with in-store promotions and point-of-sale materials. JJSF also sells frozen non-carbonated beverages under the SLUSH PUPPIE and PARROT ICE brands through a distributor network and through its own distribution network. JJSF provides managed service and/or products to approximately 111,000 Company-owned and customer-owned dispensers. JJSF also has the rights to market and distribute frozen beverages under the name ICEE to the entire continental United States (except for portions of nine states) as well as internationally.|$|R
