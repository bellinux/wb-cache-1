5|$|As Hurricane Ophelia {{moved past}} Cape Hatteras it {{turned to the}} east. Wind shear {{increased}} on September 16 and weakened Ophelia into a tropical storm for the last time. Ophelia turned to the northeast and <b>brushed</b> <b>past</b> Nantucket Island, Massachusetts on the next day. As it approached Nova Scotia on September 17, the storm became extratropical, but maintained its strength as it made landfall in the extreme eastern portion of the province. The extratropical storm passed over southern Newfoundland later that day, before finally dissipating on September 23 in the North Sea.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Jimena was {{the tenth}} named storm and second {{hurricane}} of the 2003 Pacific hurricane season. Jimena formed on August 28 {{in the far}} Eastern Pacific Ocean as a tropical depression and moved westward where it rapidly became a hurricane the following day. The storm moved westward into the Central Pacific Ocean where it became a Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. After reaching its peak strength as a Category2 hurricane, the storm began to weaken due to increasing wind shear. Jimena <b>brushed</b> <b>past</b> the Hawaiian Islands before becoming a tropical depression on September 3. The weakening storm then crossed the international dateline before dissipating on September 5, {{becoming one of the}} few storms to cross both 140ºW and International Date Line.|$|E

500|$|Several {{scenes were}} created due to onset {{accidents}} and ad-libbing. In the cold opening, Dwight tries to impress Jim with his recently purchased [...] "fitness orb". Initially dismissive, Jim pops the ball after Dwight becomes increasingly obnoxious and troublesome. Before filming, the scene had been successfully rehearsed [...] "about ten times"; each time, when Krasinski punctured the plastic, the ball slowly deflated. However, {{when it came}} time to film the scene, Krasinski accidentally hit the ball [...] "right on the seam", resulting in Wilson quickly—and dramatically—hitting the carpet. In fact, several of the cast members in the background can be seen laughing, due to the unexpected nature of the shot. Initially, the cut was relegated to the blooper reel, but Wilmore pleaded with Daniels to include it in the finished episode. The [...] "accidental boob grab" [...] scene was based on a mistake made by Carell during a rehearsal. Originally, he was supposed to pat Hardin's shoulder. Instead, however, he accidentally <b>brushed</b> <b>past</b> her breast. Hardin, finding the accident [...] "hilarious", demanded that Carell do it during the actual shooting. Furthermore, several of the scenes were improvised beyond the initial lines given to Steve Carell and Melora Hardin, such as the ending wherein Michael and Jan have a discussion about Michael's flaws. Wilson recounts that he had to sit at his desk for [...] "an hour and a half" [...] due to the ad libbing.|$|E
2500|$|The {{prosecution}} presented considerable {{evidence in}} an attempt to bind the Earps and Holliday over for trial. On {{the second day of the}} hearings, William Allen testified for the prosecution that [...] "the firing commenced by the Earp party. I think it was Doc Holliday who fired first." [...] Johnny Behan testified that he tried to prevent the confrontation. I [...] "told them...I was down there for the purpose of disarming the Clantons and McLaurys. They wouldn't heed me, paid no attention. And I said, 'Gentleman, I am Sheriff of this County, and I am not going to allow any trouble if I can help it.' They <b>brushed</b> <b>past</b> me." [...] He said Cowboys had put up their hands or thrown open their coats to show they weren't armed, and that Doc Holliday had fired first. He testified that the first five shots had come from the Earps. He clearly blamed the Earps and Doc Holliday for instigating the shootout.|$|E
50|$|In hemoperfusion, {{the blood}} perfuses a filter {{composed}} of artificial cells filled with activated carbon or another microporous material. Small molecules in solution within the serum (such as the toxin) cross the membranes into the microporous material (and get trapped therein), but formed elements (the blood cells) <b>brush</b> <b>past</b> the artificial cells {{just as they}} <b>brush</b> <b>past</b> each other. In this way, the microporous material's filtering ability can be used without destroying the blood cells.|$|R

2500|$|The mood aboard Bismarck was mixed. Seaman Adolf Eich was {{off duty}} for some fresh air. He climbed {{up to the}} bridge {{for as long as}} nobody stopped him. When he got there he found the {{atmosphere}} pleasant. Lindemann was shaking the hand of Adalbert Schneider for his Knight's Cross award bestowed upon him for the destruction of Hood. Lütjens also looked pleased. As the morning wore on the atmosphere changed. Müllenheim-Rechberg saw Lindemann wearing a life jacket and watched as the captain ate his breakfast in silence. He did not return Müllenheim-Rechberg's salute. Müllenheim-Rechberg also met Lütjens as the Admiral {{made his way to the}} bridge. Lütjens returned his salute as he <b>brushed</b> <b>past</b> but said nothing. To Müllenheim-Rechberg it seemed as if the two men most responsible for Bismarck had retreated into their own private worlds. That morning, on the 27 May 1941, Lütjens sent a request for a U-Boat to pick up the ship's war diary. In this last transmission, Lütjens included: [...] "Ship no longer manoeuvrable. We fight to the last shell. Long live the Führer". Lütjens did not hide their fate from his crew. He ordered the ships stores to be opened and allowed the crew to help themselves. It was a sign to all onboard Bismarck was doomed.|$|E
