5000|$|Backspotfacing (back spot facing) is {{analogous}} to <b>backboring,</b> meaning that the tool manages to reach {{to the far side}} of the workpiece (away from the spindle side) and cut back toward the spindle. Such operations can be done with boring bars reaching through a hole while shifted off-center, then shifting onto center for the cut, or with back-deburring style tools whose cutting edges open and close in umbrella-like or check-valve-like fashion.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are various}} types of boring. The boring bar may be {{supported}} on both ends (which only works if the existing hole is a through hole), {{or it may be}} supported at one end (which works for both through holes and blind holes). Lineboring (line boring, line-boring) implies the former. <b>Backboring</b> (back boring, back-boring) is the process of reaching through an existing hole and then boring on the [...] "back" [...] side of the workpiece (relative to the machine headstock).|$|E
5000|$|Shotguns are classed {{according}} to gauge, a related expression. The gauge of a shotgun refers {{to how many}} lead spheres, each with a diameter {{equal to that of}} the bore, amount to one pound in weight. In the case of a 12-gauge shotgun, it would take 12 spheres the size of the shotgun's bore to equal a pound. A numerically larger gauge indicates a smaller barrel: a 20-gauge shotgun requires more spheres to equal a pound; therefore, its barrel is smaller than the 12-gauge. This metric is used in Russia as [...] "caliber number": e.g., [...] "shotgun of the 12 caliber." [...] The 16th caliber is known as [...] "lordly" [...] (барский). While shotgun bores can be expressed in calibers (the [...]410 bore shotgun is in fact a caliber measure of [...]41 caliber mm), the nature of shotshells is such that the barrel diameter often varies significantly {{down the length of the}} shotgun barrel, with various levels of choke and <b>backboring.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Shotgun bores are {{commonly}} [...] "overbored" [...] or [...] "backbored", meaning {{that most of}} the bore (from the forcing cone to the choke) is slightly larger than the value given by the formula. This is claimed to reduce felt recoil and improve patterning. The recoil reduction is due to the larger bore producing a slower acceleration of the shot, and the patterning improvements are due to the larger muzzle diameter for the same choke constriction, which results in less shot deformation. A 12-gauge shotgun, nominally 18.5 mm, can range from a tight 18.3 mm to an extreme overbore of 20.3 mm. Some also claim an increased velocity with the overbored barrels, up to 15 m/s, which is due to the larger swept volume of the overbored barrel. Once only found in expensive custom shotguns, overbored barrels are now becoming common in mass marketed guns. Aftermarket <b>backboring</b> is also commonly done to reduce the weight of the barrel, and move the center of mass backwards for a better balance. Factory overbored barrels generally are made with a larger outside diameter, and will not have this reduction in weight—though the factory barrels will be tougher, since they have a normal barrel wall thickness.|$|E
