50|$|<b>Bond</b> <b>insurance</b> {{generally}} {{reduces the}} borrowing costs for an issuer since investors {{are prepared to}} accept a lower interest rate {{in exchange for the}} credit enhancement provided by the <b>bond</b> <b>insurance.</b> The interest savings from the use of <b>bond</b> <b>insurance</b> are generally shared between the issuer (as its incentive to use the insurance) and the insurer (as its premium for providing the insurance). Since an issuer generally has the option of selling its securities with or without insurance, the issuer will generally only use insurance when doing so results in overall cost savings acceptable to the issuer. Municipal <b>bond</b> <b>insurance</b> premiums are generally paid up-front as a lump sum; while non-municipal <b>bond</b> <b>insurance</b> premiums are generally paid in periodic installments over time.|$|E

5000|$|Municipal <b>bond</b> <b>insurance</b> was {{introduced}} in the U.S. in 1971 by American Municipal Bond Assurance Corp. (subsequently renamed AMBAC and later [...] "Ambac"), the first of the financial guaranty corporations, being a separately capitalized insurance company formed for the purpose of insuring bonds. Ambac was joined in 1973 by Municipal <b>Bond</b> <b>Insurance</b> Association (subsequently renamed “MBIA”), Financial Guaranty Insurance Company (“FGIC”) in 1983, and Financial Security Assurance Inc. (“FSA,” now known as Assured Guaranty Municipal) in 1985. These became known as the “big four” bond insurers. Other participants in this sector included Capital Markets Assurance Corp. (“CapMac”) (1988) and Bond Investors Guaranty Insurance Company (“BIG”) (1985), both subsequently acquired by MBIA; Capital Guaranty Corp. (1986), subsequently acquired by FSA; and College Construction Loan Insurance Corporation (“Connie Lee”) (1987), subsequently acquired by Ambac. FSA, which was the first bond insurer organized to insure non-municipal bonds, established the business of insuring ABS. The 1980s also saw the birth of monoline financial guaranty reinsurance companies, including Enhance Reinsurance Company (“Enhance Re”) (1986) and Capital Reinsurance Company (1988). The 1990s then saw the combination of the municipal <b>bond</b> <b>insurance</b> business with the ABS insurance business, and also saw the expansion of <b>bond</b> <b>insurance</b> into Europe, Asia, Australia, and Latin America.|$|E

40|$|Reaching-for-yield—the {{propensity}} to buy riskier assets {{in order to}} achieve higher yields—is believed to be an important factor contributing to the credit cycle. This paper analyses this phenomenon in the corporate bond market. Specifically, we show evidence for reaching for yield among insurance companies, the largest institutional holders of corporate <b>bonds.</b> <b>Insurance</b> companies have capital requirements tied to the credit ratings of their investments. Conditional on ratings, insurance portfolios are systematically biased toward higher yield, higher CDS bonds. This behavior appears {{to be related to the}} business cycle, being most pronounced during economic expansions. It is also more pronounced for the insurance firms for which regulatory capital requirements are more binding. The results hold both at issuance and for trading in the secondary market and are robust to a series of bond and issuer controls, including issuer fixed effects as well as liquidity and duration. Comparison of the ex-post performance of <b>bonds</b> acquired by <b>insurance</b> companies does not show outperformance, but higher volatility of realized returns...|$|R
