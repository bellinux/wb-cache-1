5|$|Both Dio and Suetonius {{agree that}} gladiatorial {{contests}} and a wild-beast hunt, the venatio, also {{took place at}} the lake area, but they again disagree on the details. Dio states this took place on the first day, with the lake covered over with planking and wooden stands erected around it, while Suetonius says the events occurred in the basin after the water had <b>been</b> <b>let</b> out. Suetonius writes that 5,000 animals were killed there in a single day. Although no record of the animals pursued in these hunts survives (Dio mentions hunts of cranes and elephants but does not give a location), larger exotic animals were popular, notably elephants, big cats and bears, though smaller game such as birds, rabbits and goats also featured.|$|E
5|$|In the three-acre garden, when Jane and Kingsley lived there, {{there was}} an old barn that was itself a listed building, a conservatory, a gravel drive, three {{descending}} lawns, a rose garden, cedar trees, a mulberry tree (where Lucy Snowe, their cat, was buried), and a weathervane dating to 1775. At the end of the garden, through a five-bar gate, there lay a five-acre meadow that also belonged to the property and had <b>been</b> <b>let</b> out to two local women for their horses.|$|E

5|$|The Oriel Street {{site was}} {{acquired}} between 1329 and 1392. No. 12, now staircases 19 and 20, {{is the oldest}} tenement acquired by the college; known as Kylyngworth's, it was granted to the college in 1392 by Thomas de Lentwardyn, Fellow and later Provost, having previously <b>been</b> <b>let</b> to William de Daventre, Oriel's fourth Provost, in 1367. A back wing to the property was added around 1600 and further work to the front was conducted in 1724–38. In 1985, funded by a gift from Edgar O'Brien and £10,000 from the Pilgrim Trust, Kylyngworth's was refurbished along with Nos. 10, 9 and 7.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} {{then became}} involved with Ashley Abbott (Eileen Davidson) and the two were later married; their union ended after a year due to Tucker's adultery. In 2011, {{it was revealed that}} Tucker was the previously unknown father of Devon Hamilton (Bryton James), which also revealed a long ago affair with Yolanda Hamilton (Debbi Morgan); a plot that was met with positive reviews. While several television critics were surprised by the decision to replace Russ with Nichols, the actor was well received throughout his run. In December 2012, it was announced that Nichols had <b>been</b> <b>let</b> go from the soap opera; Tucker made his final appearance on January 29, 2013, when he announced his move to Hong Kong.|$|E
5|$|On {{his return}} to Britain in 1821, MacGregor claimed that King George Frederic Augustus of the Mosquito Coast in the Gulf of Honduras had created him Cazique of Poyais, which he {{described}} as a developed colony with an existing community of British settlers. When the British press reported on MacGregor's deception following the return of fewer than 50 survivors in late 1823, some of his victims leaped to his defence, insisting that the general had <b>been</b> <b>let</b> down by those whom he had {{put in charge of}} the emigration party. A French court tried MacGregor and three others for fraud in 1826 after he attempted a variation on the scheme there, but convicted only one of his associates. Acquitted, MacGregor attempted lesser Poyais schemes in London over the next decade. In 1838, he moved to Venezuela, where he was welcomed back as a hero. He died in Caracas in 1845, aged 58, and was buried with full military honours in Caracas Cathedral.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the next}} decade the house was likely to have <b>been</b> <b>let,</b> as Maria Davenport {{preferred}} to live elsewhere. Her eldest son, William Davenport Davenport married firstly to Camilla Maria Gatt, then secondly to Diana Handley, whom he lived with at Bramall for four years before the estate was passed to him. Maria moved to London where she lived with her youngest son, Charles, and died in 1866. During William's tenure Bramall was regularly visited {{by members of the}} public, and the Chapel continued to be used for regular services of worship. However, following his death in 1869, the property was let to Wakefield Christy of Christys & Co Hatting, therefore ending direct involvement from the Davenport family. This occurred because William's son, John, was too young to inherit the estate. John's whereabouts during Christy's seven-year tenure is unknown, though he was shown as a visitor at Bramall in 1871, and in 1874 became the first chairman of the Bramhall School Board. In 1876, shortly before he returned to the house, he was listed as living on Ack Lane in Bramhall.|$|E
5|$|The {{most famous}} {{of the very few}} chairs which have come down from a remote antiquity is the reputed Chair of Saint Peter in St Peter's Basilica at Rome. The wooden {{portions}} are much decayed, but it would appear to be Byzantine work of the 6th century, and to be really an ancient sedia gestatoria. It has ivory carvings representing the labours of Hercules. A few pieces of an earlier oaken chair have <b>been</b> <b>let</b> in; the existing one, Gregorovius says, is of acacia wood. The legend that this was the curile chair of the senator Pudens is necessarily apocryphal. It is not, as is popularly supposed, enclosed in Gian Lorenzo Bernini's bronze chair, but is kept under triple lock and exhibited only once in a century. Byzantium, like Greece and Rome, affected the curule form of chair, and in addition to lions’ heads and winged figures of Victory (or Nike) and dolphin-shaped arms used also the lyre-back which has been made familiar by the pseudo-classical revival {{of the end of the}} 18th century.|$|E
5|$|In January 1944, Eichelberger was {{informed}} {{that he would be}} in charge of the next operation, a landing at Hansa Bay with the 24th and 41st Infantry Divisions. However, in March this was cancelled in favor of Operation Reckless, a landing by the same force at Hollandia. The operation meant leapfrogging the Japanese defenses at Hansa Bay, but was risky because it was outside the range of land-based air cover. Cover was instead provided by aircraft carriers of the United States Pacific Fleet, but this meant that the operation had to adhere to a strict timetable. Hoping to avoid a repeat of Buna, Eichelberger meticulously planned the operation, and implemented a thorough training program that emphasized physical fitness, individual initiative, small unit tactics and amphibious warfare. The operation went well, mainly because surprise was achieved and few Japanese were present in the area. However, poor topographical intelligence led to an inability to clear some beaches due to their being backed by swamps. Supplies piled up on the beaches, with fuel and ammunition being stored together in some instances. On 23 April a single Japanese plane ignited a fuel dump, which caused a fire that resulted in 124 casualties and the loss of 60 per cent of the ammunition stockpile. An appalled Krueger felt that Eichelberger had <b>been</b> <b>let</b> down by his staff, and offered to transfer Byers to an assistant division commander's post, but Eichelberger turned down the offer.|$|E

25|$|Sir Horace Vere, {{seeing that}} the Spanish were gaining ground reacted with swift speed. He {{selected}} 100 pikemen and 200 musketeers from his brother Francis's regiment, and placed them {{under the command of}} Sir Charles Fairfax. A second detachment of 400 men, under Sir John Ogle, was to follow and 200 of Cecil's cavalry came up in support. The way was narrow, and on either side there were swamps and stagnant waters, where the sea had <b>been</b> <b>let</b> in over the polder lands. Fairfax led his men to the attack with great vigour and after a sharp engagement, he forced the Spanish to retire behind their entrenchments, and followed them so closely that they were routed. Many plunged into the swamps and flooded polders, some escaped but some drowned or were trapped. More of Ogle's men joined the fight to complete the rout.|$|E
25|$|The {{estate of}} Pockerley Old Hall is {{presented}} {{as that of a}} well off tenant farmer, in a position {{to take advantage of the}} agricultural advances of the era. The hall itself consists of the Old House, which is adjoined (but not connected to) the New House, both south facing two storey sandstone built buildings, the Old House also having a small north-south aligned extension. Roof timbers in the sandstone built Old House have been dated to the 1440s, but the lower storey (the undercroft) may be from even earlier. The New House dates to the late 1700s, and replaced a medieval manor house to the east of the Old House as the main farm house - once replaced itself, the Old House is believed to have <b>been</b> <b>let</b> to the farm manager. Visitors can access all rooms in the New and Old House, except the north-south extension which is now a toilet block. Displays include traditional cooking, such as the drying of oatcakes over a wooden rack (flake) over the fireplace in the Old House.|$|E
25|$|After the defeat, Richthofen {{travelled}} to see Hitler on 11 February. He {{first met}} with Göring, who {{was worried that}} Richthofen would use the opportunity to criticise his leadership. In the event he did not, but Richthofen did criticise Göring's reluctance to disagree with Hitler and attacked his willingness {{to allow him to}} receive what he considered to be faulty advice. When Richthofen did meet Hitler he criticised him openly for micromanagement, though he did insist he had <b>been</b> <b>let</b> down by his advisors. Hitler took all of this calmly, and admitted (as he had done to Erhard Milch) that he bore the ultimate responsibility for the air lift fiasco. Richthofen argued commanders needed more tactical and operational freedom, as had Manstein. Hitler agreed. Richthofen was probably helped, regardless of his criticism, by the fact that Hitler genuinely liked him, and believed him to be loyal. Four days later Richthofen was promoted to the rank of field marshall being the youngest officer beside Göring to reach this rank in the Wehrmacht.|$|E
