50|$|The most {{commonly}} used and commercially available fluorescent <b>base</b> <b>analogue,</b> 2-aminopurine (2-AP), has a high-fluorescence quantum yield free in solution (0.68) that is considerably reduced (appr. 100 times but highly dependent on base sequence) when incorporated into nucleic acids. The emission sensitivity of 2-AP to immediate surroundings is shared by other promising and useful fluorescent base analogues like 3-MI, 6-MI, 6-MAP, pyrrolo-dC (also commercially available), modified and improved derivatives of pyrrolo-dC, furan-modified bases and many other ones (see recent reviews). This sensitivity to the microenvironment has been utilized in studies of e.g. structure and dynamics within both DNA and RNA, dynamics and kinetics of DNA-protein interaction and electron transfer within DNA. A newly developed and very interesting group of fluorescent base analogues that has a fluorescence quantum yield that is nearly insensitive to their immediate surroundings is the tricyclic cytosine family. 1,3-Diaza-2-oxophenothiazine, tC, has a fluorescence quantum yield of approximately 0.2 both in single- and in double-strands irrespective of surrounding bases. Also the oxo-homologue of tC called tCO (both commercially available), 1,3-diaza-2-oxophenoxazine, has a quantum yield of 0.2 in double-stranded systems. However, it is somewhat sensitive to surrounding bases in single-strands (quantum yields of 0.14-0.41). The high and stable quantum yields of these base analogues make them very bright, and, in combination with their good <b>base</b> <b>analogue</b> properties (leaves DNA structure and stability next to unperturbed), they are especially useful in fluorescence anisotropy and FRET measurements, areas where other fluorescent base analogues are less accurate. Also, {{in the same family}} of cytosine analogues, a FRET-acceptor <b>base</b> <b>analogue,</b> tCnitro, has been developed. Together with tCO as a FRET-donor this constitutes the first nucleic acid <b>base</b> <b>analogue</b> FRET-pair ever developed. The tC-family has, for example, been used in studies related to polymerase DNA-binding and DNA-polymerization mechanisms.|$|E

The lowest energy absorption band at 360 nm (epsilon = 9000 M- 1 cm(1)) is dominated by a single in-plane polarized electronic transition and the fluorescence, centred at 465 nm, has a quantum yield of 0. 3. When incorporated into double-stranded DNA, tC(O) shows only minor variations in fluorescence intensity and lifetime with neighbouring bases, and the average quantum yield is 0. 22. These features make tC(O), on average, the brightest DNA-incorporated <b>base</b> <b>analogue</b> so far reported. Furthermore, it base pairs exclusively with guanine and causes minimal perturbations to the native structure of DNA. These properties make tC(O) a promising <b>base</b> <b>analogue</b> that is perfectly suited for e. g. photophysical studies of DNA interacting with macromolecules (proteins) or for determining {{size and shape of}} DNA tertiary structures using techniques such as fluorescence anisotropy and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) ...|$|E

The systematic separation of a library comprising 36 representatives on the commercially available Whelk O 1 chiral stationary phase provided valuable information on structure-enantioselectivity relationships.

More generally, we show how accumulated evidence suggests that both BrdUrd and 2 -aminopurine have two mutagenic effects intracellularly: perturbation of normal deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate pools and analogue mispairs in DNA. We propose a molecular basis for various observations of normal exogenous deoxyribonucleosides as synergists and counteragents to <b>base</b> <b>analogue</b> mutagenesis. A model is proposed to explain the antipolarity of BrdUrd and 2 -aminopurine mutagenesis [...] i. e., why mutants at hot spots for induction by one <b>base</b> <b>analogue</b> are usually hot spots for reversion by the other.

Phenotypic revertants of dam mutants to <b>base</b> <b>analogue</b> resistance include second site mutations in mutL or mutS genes 4, which are also part of the correction system. We report here that E. coli dam mutants are also sensitive to the DNA methylating agent N-methyl-N 2 ̆ 7 -nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), which introduces O 6 -methylguanine (m 6 G) into the DNA. This sensitivity, however, was not observed using methylating agents which generate only low amounts of this alkylated base. Furthermore, the introduction of either a mutL or a mutS mutation into dam strains abolished the sensitivity to MNNG. These results suggest that mismatch correction occurs at m 6 G residues in DNA.
