40|$|Graduation date: 1968 A {{method of}} culturing Eriosoma pyricola on {{detached}} root pieces {{was developed to}} ensure a regular supply of aphids for experimental work. Another method was designed for studying the alate sexuparae formation in woolly <b>pear</b> <b>aphid,</b> whereby growing plants were infested so that the aphids or their progeny could be recovered later. Sexuparae were produced in woolly <b>pear</b> <b>aphid</b> colonies on the roots of "Domestic Bartlett" seedlings treated to induce dormancy, indicating E. pyricola is holocyclic in Oregon. No sexuparae were found while shoot growth continued. Shoot growth of pear seedlings ceased when the plants were exposed to 10 -hour photoperiods at a constant 24 °C. Growth continued for a much longer time when plants were kept under 16 -hour photoperiods at alternating day and night temperatures, 24 °C and 18 °C, respectively. However, aphids did not produce sexuparae when cultured on detached root pieces from plants treated for four weeks under 10 -hour photoperiods at a constant 24 °C. Also, sexuparae were not found in aphid colonies on root pieces of dormant plants from the field. All these results agree with our field observations. In the field, sexuparae are produced for about two months in late summer and early fall on the roots of infested plants. After this, no more sexuparae appear in the remaining aphid populations which continue as apterous virginoparae on pear roots until autumn of the following year. Experiments on growth cessation in pear plants indicated that short day-length was not the critical factor responsible for the induction of growth cessation in pear seedlings. These experiments also showed that constant temperatures were {{more important in the}} regulation of growth in this pear variety. The direct effect of photoperiods and temperatures on sexuparae production in this aphid was also investigated. Aphids on detached root pieces did not produce sexuparae when exposed to 10 -hour photo-periods at alternating day and night temperatures, 24 °C and 18 °C, respectively. Aphid cultures on detached root pieces were kept under different combinations of 10 - and 16 -hour photoperiods and 15 ° and 18 °C constant temperatures. But the treatments had no effect on sexuparae formation. No sexuparae were found in aphid colonies on root pieces kept in continuous darkness at constant temperatures of 15 °, 18 °, 21 °, 24 ° and 27 °C for periods of 14 to 49 days. Also, sexuparae were not produced when aphid cultures on root pieces were alternated between 15 ° and 24 °C every 12 hours for 47 days. Sexuparae were not found in our stock cultures maintained at 21 °C for about three years. Direct effect of different temperatures on the development and increase in numbers of woolly <b>pear</b> <b>aphid</b> was also studied. Apterous E. pyricola on detached roots developed and reproduced normally at 24 °C, but failed to reproduce and died within two weeks when kept at 27 °C. Apterous from stock culture and alate virginoparae from elm galls were transferred to the detached roots of "Domestic Bartlett" pear, Amelanchier florida Lindl., Sorbus sitchensis, Crataegus species, Ribes sativum and Red Delicious apple.

40|$|Graduation date: 1974 Various {{aspects of}} the biology of the woolly <b>pear</b> <b>aphid</b> Eriosoma pyricola were studied {{in order to further}} {{understand}} its annual cycle. It was already known that. E. pyricola produces alate sexuparae in response to the onset of dormancy in its secondary host, a pear. This study of E. pyricola on detached root pieces showed that alatae were also produced in response to crowding. The crowding stimulus appeared to be necessary for elate production and could act alone, without any seasonal stimulus from the host plant, as the root pieces were cut from live plants throughout the year. The crowding stimulus followed a delayed density dependent pattern when densities were high, which was not apparent when densities were low. Aging cultures produced greater numbers of alatae. The crowding stimulus did not act maternally, but on the second and third instar and occasionally on the fourth instar young. The alate fourth instar young were found to be gregarious, a factor enhancing the crowding effect once the first alatae appeared so that {{a large proportion of the}} population would become alatiform within a short time. The population remaining on the roots continued as the apterous morph until densities built up again. Neither the crowding nor the host plant stimulus affected the whole population, some individuals remaining in the apterous form. It was considered that sporadic crowding during the summer determined which individuals would respond to the host plant stimulus...|$|R

For NMR relaxometry, disordered tissue shows higher transverse relaxation rates compared to sound tissue, especially at higher magnetic field strength and for long pulse spacing.

Correlation between relaxation times and diffusion showed that the proton pools in disordered tissue are grouped into a smaller number of populations compared to sound tissue, also highlighting cell decompartmentation in disordered tissue. At a macroscopic level, fast low angle shot MR images, effective transverse relaxation-weighted (TR 11 ms and TE 3. 7 ms) and proton density-weighted (TR 7. 6 ms and TE 2. 5 ms), were acquired for pears at a rate of 54 mm/s.

This Conference was a join activity with COST Action 924. The physiological bases for the effectiveness of technologies used in fresh-cut fruit were examined {{in an attempt to}} foster the shift from a market-pull to a science-push innovation model. Respiration rate of fresh-cut ‘Rocha’ pear were measured at various oxygen concentrations. Apparent Km values for oxygen uptake were very close to the fermentation thresholds, indicating that it is physiologically impossible to reduce the respiration rate of fresh-cut pear by more than 50 % without inducing fermentation. Based on this information, we hypothesize that optimizing oxygen concentration inside packages is of little or no value in fresh-cut pears. Additionally, additives used to reduce enzymic browning and softening may have pleiotropic effects on quality. It was found that pH significantly affected the rate and intensity of <b>browning</b> of fresh-cut <b>pears.</b> <b>Browning</b> was more intense in pears treated at pH 3. 0 and less pronounced at pH 7. 0, but the softening rate was lower at the latter pH value.

Biological control may provide a solution to these challenges, by increasing the biodiversity and robustness in the surrounding ecosystems. The anthocorid bugs Anthocoris nemorum and A. nemoralis {{are considered to be}} effective predators on three important pest species in Norwegian fruit production: the pear psyllid Cacopsylla pyri in pear, and the green apple aphid Aphis pomi and the rosy apple aphid Dysaphis plantaginea in apple. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the potential of A. nemorum and A. nemoralis as biological control agents of these pest species in Norway. Field surveys and semi-field experiments were carried out in apple and pear orchards in western Norway. The predation potential was tested by performing sleeve-cage experiments. Information about spatial and temporal patterns of natural populations of A. nemorum and A. nemoralis and their prey was obtained by sampling orchards and analyzing the data with generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) incorporating the spatial structure. The results from the sleeve cage experiments showed that A. nemorum has the potential to control both C. pyri populations in <b>pear</b> and <b>aphid</b> populations in apple. Surprisingly, commercially bought A. nemoralis did not manage to reduce C. pyri populations, when compared to the control. Differences between commercially reared and natural populations of A. nemoralis should be researched. Results from the orchard survey in pear supported the hypothesis that natural populations of A. nemoralis are more specialized towards finding C. pyri nymphs and eggs than A. nemorum. However, A. nemorum was present in the orchard earlier, and in larger abundances than other studies has suggested. This highlights that A. nemorum’s role in controlling pear psyllids may be more important in Norway than previously assumed. The presence of ants was negatively related to number of Anthocorid nymphs in pear, and to imago A. nemorum in apple. Ants should therefore be taken into account when biocontrol systems in orchards are planned...|$|R

We found both adsorbents successfully reduced CO 2 and C 2 H 4 levels even though the incidences were visually found at 3 months of storage. Most severe internal browning was observed on CO 2 adsorbent-untreated pears under high CO 2 levels (7 - 9 %) increasing {{since the beginning of}} storage.

The development of disorders during postharvest ripening and storage of fruit also depends on a range of preharvest factors such as climate conditions and crop load.

40|$|The organic {{market has}} grown {{exponentially}} in Europe {{during the last}} ten years. However, the organic fruit industry has shown the lowest growth rates (1 - 5 % market share) compared to other commodities. One major reason is the high production risk due to high disease and pest pressure in humid climates. Key pests and diseases in apple and pear include scab, sooty blotch, and fire blight as well as rosy apple <b>aphid,</b> <b>pear</b> sucker, and codling moth. In cherry, damages due to brown rot (Monilinia) and the cherry fruit fly make organic production almost unfeasible. In an ideal organic system, all possible measures that lead to improved stability of the system must be implemented. In fruit production, such measures include (i) use of resistant varieties (scab), (ii) active promotion of predators (rosy apple aphid), (iii) sanitation (cherry monilinia), (iv) microclimate management (planting density, covering trees), and (v) strengthening the plant self-defence system (e. g. building up of soil fertility, bio-dynamic preparations). At present, most organic orchards have been designed for conventional production and, therefore, lack most stabilising components. In consequence, organic fruit production still depends largely on direct pest and disease control methods.

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of the production of Stemphylium vesicarium conidia and Pleospora allii ascospores from different inoculum sources on the ground were compared in a model system of a wildflower meadow mainly composed of yellow foxtail, creeping cinquefoil and white clover. The meadow was either inoculated (each October) or not inoculated with a virulent strain of S. vesicarium, and either covered or not covered with a litter of inoculated pear leaves. Spore traps positioned a few centimetres above the ground were exposed for 170 7 -day periods between October 2003 and December 2006. Ascospores and conidia were trapped in 46 and 25 % of samples, respectively. Ascospore numbers trapped from the pear leaf litter were about five times higher than those from the meadow, while conidial numbers were similar from the different inoculum sources. The ascosporic season was very long, with two main trapping periods: December-April, and August-October; the former was most important for the leaf litter, the latter for the meadow. The conidial season lasted from April to November, with 92 % of conidia caught between July and September. The fungus persistently colonized the meadow: the meadow inoculated in early October 2003 produced spores until autumn 2006. The present work demonstrates that orchard ground is {{an important source of}} inoculum for <b>brown</b> spot of <b>pear.</b> Thus, it is important to reduce inoculum by managing the orchard ground all year long...|$|R
40|$|Peptide BP 15 {{has shown}} {{antifungal}} activity against several plant pathogenic fungi, including Stemphylium vesicarium, the causal agent of <b>brown</b> spot of <b>pear.</b> BP 15 inhibits the germination, growth and sporulation of S. vesicarium and displays post-infection activity by stopping fungal infection in pear leaves. In this work, live-cell imaging was undertaken {{to understand the}} antifungal mechanism of BP 15. A double-staining method based on the combination of calcofluor white and SYTOX green coupled with epifluorescence microscopy was used to investigate fungal cell permeabilization and alterations in fungal growth induced by BP 15. GFP-transformants of S. vesicarium were obtained and exposed to rhodamine-labelled BP 15. Confocal laser microscopy provided evidence of peptide internalization by hyphae, resulting in fungal cell disorganization and death. S. vesicarium membrane permeabilization by BP 15 {{was found to be}} peptide-concentration dependent. BP 15 at MIC and sub-MIC concentrations (10 and 5 μM, respectively) inhibited S. vesicarium growth and produced morphological alterations to germ tubes, with slow and discontinuous compromise of fungal cell membranes. Fungal cell membrane disruption was immediately induced by BP 15 at 100 μM, and this was accompanied by rapid peptide internalization by S. vesicarium hyphae. Peptide BP 15 interacted with germ tubes and hyphae of S. vesicarium but not with conidial cellsThis research {{was supported in part by}} grants from the Ministerio de Educaci on y Ciencia (AGL 2009 - 09829 /AGR and AGL 2011 - 30354 -C 02 - 01) of Spai...|$|R
40|$|Brown spot disease on pear {{caused by}} Stemphylium vesicarium may affect leaves and fruits. Inoculum sources present on orchard floors play an {{important}} role in the epidemiology of <b>pear</b> <b>brown</b> spot. The pathogen can overwinter on plant residues and multiply and spread on the residues during the growing season. In the Netherlands, brown spot characteristically occurs only in a fraction of the orchards per season. Until now, no tools are available for Dutch pear growers to predict the risk of brown spot in specific orchards. As a consequence, preventive fungicide sprayings are common. The concentration of DNA of pear-pathogenic S. vesicarium was quantified by a specific TaqMan-PCR assay for various types of plant residues present on orchard floors to evaluate their importance as potential inoculum source. The pathogen was often found in residues of pear leaves, grasses and weeds, but only occasionally in mummies and prunings. Studies of the population dynamics showed that S. vesicarium decreased in dead pear leaves during early winter whereas pathogen populations developed with irregular pattern during the growing season on residues of weeds and grasses. Based on DNA concentrations of S. vesicarium in plant residue samples taken in 78 to 106 orchards in the springs of 2010, 2011 and 2012, the risk of brown spot development could be predicted for individual orchards. Such a risk prediction will allow growers to adapt their fungicide spray schedules to avoid unnecessary sprays in low-risk orchards. © 2013 KNPV...|$|R
40|$|Stemphylium vesicarium is {{the causal}} agent of <b>brown</b> spot of <b>pear,</b> an {{important}} disease reported in pear-growing areas of Europe. The pathogen {{is able to}} colonize pear leaf debris and dead tissues of herbaceous plants and produce abundant ascospores and conidia {{that are capable of}} infecting pear trees. Inoculum monitoring in pear orchards is mainly achieved through spore traps and species identification is based on conidial morphology, but the similarities on conidial traits among species of Stemphylium make correct identification difficult. In this work a total of thirty-seven Stemphylium isolates from pear orchards were characterized at the morphological, pathogenic, and molecular level. Correspondence among ITS and gpd sequences and morphological traits were evaluated. Species identification based exclusively on morphological data was not feasible. Combined morphological and molecular data were necessary for unambiguous identification of isolates in the S. vesicarium species group. Only isolates identified as S. vesicarium were pathogenic on pear. The study revealed that several species of Stemphylium coexist in pear orchards with S. vesicarium, the causal agent of BSP, and that combined morphological and molecular data are needed to differentiate them. Consequently, direct measurements of the airborne inoculum using volumetric spore traps may overestimate the actual pathogen populationThis research {{was supported in part by}} grants from Ministerio de Educacion y Ciencia (AGL 2006 - 04987 /AGR and AGL 2009 - 09829 /AGR) of Spain; Comissio Interdepartamental de Recerca i Tecnologia from the Generalitat de Catalunya (2009 SGR 00812) and BR 10 / 17 from the University of Giron...|$|R
40|$|Research on {{innovative}} Integrated Pest Management (IPM) tools is done onstation and on-farm in the PURE project. The {{idea is that}} IPM {{tools are}} tested under well-defined conditions in experimental orchards. Subsequently, they are tested in commercial orchards {{as part of a}} total IPM system where drawbacks and bottlenecks become clear. In subsequent on-station experiments the drawbacks or bottlenecks are solved and adjusted IPM tools are again tested in commercial orchards. We call this the "design - assessment - adjustment cycle". It is meant, together with co-innovation techniques, to promote uptake of innovative IPM tools by commercial farmers. For apple, new innovations are the use of exclusion netting against codling moth (Cydia pomonella), and the use of an antagonist against conidia of Venturia inaequalis. For pear, the overwintering inoculum of <b>brown</b> spot of <b>pear</b> (Stemphylium vesicarium) is reduced by antagonists and natural fertilisers, and the control of pear sucker (Cacopsylla pyricola) is promoted by natural enemies. For both apple and pear an innovative canopy adapted sprayer is used to reduce emissions and to further reduce pesticide use. Efficacy of these innovative IPM tools and IPM systems is assessed by the newly developed software for environmental effects: SYNOPS, for economic effects: PREMISE, and for overall sustainability, including economic, social and environmental aspects: DEXiPM-pomefruit. Results show that the overall sustainability of the conventional system is already high. Nevertheless, innovative IPM tools provided an improvement of environmental quality with an efficient control of diseases or pests. The cost for running the innovative IPM systems was often higher than the conventional system. </p...|$|R
40|$|Isolates of Stemphylium vesicarium causing <b>brown</b> spot of <b>pear</b> can be {{distinguished}} from nonpathogenic isolates of S. vesicarium from pear or from other hosts {{on the basis of}} distinctive amplified fragment length polymorphism fingerprinting profiles. DNA fragments specific for isolates pathogenic to pear were identified and a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was developed on the sequence from one of these specific DNA loci. This TaqMan PCR has a high sensitivity with a dynamic range for reliable quantification between 1 ng and 100 fg of DNA. The method detected pear-pathogenic isolates of S. vesicarium originating from four different European countries and various regions within those countries. No cross-reaction was found with either the nonpathogenic isolates of S. vesicarium tested or isolates belonging to other Stemphylium spp. or related fungi. The pathogen was detected on leaves with brown-spot symptoms originating from six different locations in The Netherlands, Italy, and Spain. Pear-pathogenic S. vesicarium populations were monitored on crop residues in two Dutch orchards between October 2007 and October 2008. Brown spot had been observed at both orchards {{at the end of the}} growing season of 2007. In one location, pear-pathogenic S. vesicarium was detected only sporadically on crop residues and no brown-spot symptoms were observed on fruit in 2008. At the other location, a pathogenic population was found on fallen pear leaves and on other crop residues but this population decreased during winter. From the beginning of the growing season in 2008 onward, the pathogen population could not be detected and the disease incidence was only 0. 6 %. The TaqMan PCR will allow more detailed studies on epidemiology of brown spot and on the effect of disease control measures...|$|R
40|$|A {{review of}} the main results {{obtained}} by Time-resolved Reflectance Spectroscopy (TRS) and of its possible applications {{for the detection of}} inner attributes and defects in fruit is presented. Common spectroscopy techniques employ continuous wave light and measure the diffusively remitted intensity which is determined by both the absorption and the scattering properties of the sample. Light absorption is related to chemical properties, while scattering to physical structure. Quantification of absorption and scattering may be obtained by space- or time-resolved methods. TRS is a technique based on the measurement of the temporal delay and broadening experienced by a short laser pulse while traveling through a turbid medium and explores a volume of pulp at a depth of 1 - 2 cm. TRS has been used to detect some internal defects and disorders in the intact fruit, such as brown heart, internal browning, internal bruises, water soaked tissue, as well as internal attributes related to maturity, texture and cell wall structure. The scattering coefficient was found {{to be related to the}} translucency of tissue and was used to detect internal bruises and water soaked tissue (i. e., water core in apples and Botrytis decayed kiwifruits). The scattering coefficient was related to pectin composition and textural properties of apples such as firmness and mealiness. Absorption coefficient in the 600 - 700 nm region can detect <b>brown</b> heart in <b>pears</b> and internal <b>browning</b> in apples. The absorption coefficient at 670 nm is related to fruit maturity and it was used in nectarines to predict their softening time and to detect too immature fruit which are not able to ripen. Being non-destructive, TRS measurements can be repeated on the same fruit, following the development and the changes occurring with ripening or storag...|$|R
