40|$|Excavations {{continued}} in 1999 on an Iron Age settlement at Birnie, Moray, where metal-detecting had recovered a disturbed Roman coin hoard. Earlier work had shown the settlement {{was in part}} contemporary with the coins, {{and it may have}} been the residence of a powerful local chieftain who had contacts with the Romans. Work in 1999 concentrated on a roundhouse which had been partly exposed in 1998. This proved to be well-preserved, with <b>burnt</b> <b>deposits</b> which probably relate to its destruction after it was abandoned. Although these were only partly excavated, they have the potential to give a rare insight into the structure of an Iron Age house. The house was large, some 14 m in diameter, supported on a ring of substantial posts. It was rebuilt once. Excavation of an area around the house revealed a range of pits and postholes. It also uncovered a well-preserved medieval blacksmith's workshop. This was probably linked to the community which lived around the important church at Birnie. A metal detecting survey found more silver coins from the hoard, as well as two Roman brooches. One of these is probably earlier than the coins, which indicated the hoard was not a one-off contact. This suggests the inhabitants of Birnie were indeed people of some importance, as they had connections with the Roman world on several occasions...|$|R

40|$|The <b>Burnt</b> Timber <b>deposit</b> is one {{of several}} gold {{deposits}} along the Johnson Shear Zone, a major east-trending fault zone on the southern margin of the Lynn Lake greenstone belt in northern Manitoba. The deposit is hosted by mafic tectonite of the Wasekwan Group. Gold is associated with silica, pyrite and carbonate enrichment that occurred during dextral shearing along the shear zone. The Johnson Shear Zone has a strong east-trending shear foliation. This foliation is deformed by chevron folds, which are, in turn, sheared along the shear foliation, forming isolated fold packets in the shear zone. These structures are overprinted by a crenulation cleavage and kinks that formed during later dextral shearing. East-trending cataclasite units and pseudotachylite veins cut across the earlier ductile structures, and are displaced by late, north-trending, sinistral faults...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — The <b>Burnt</b> Timber gold <b>deposit</b> {{is located}} in the Paleoproterozoic Lynn Lake greenstone belt of the Trans-Hudson Orogen, Manitoba. The deposit occurs along the Johnson shear zone, and is hosted by enriched and {{depleted}} tholeiitic volcanic arc basalts cut by feldspar porphyry dikes. The Johnson shear zone is a regional, belt-parallel structure characterized by the intensification of the regional S 2 foliation. At the <b>Burnt</b> Timber <b>deposit,</b> S 2 is folded by centimeter- to meter-scale, Z-shaped, F 3 chevron folds that have an axial planar S 3 crenulation cleavage. Within the 20 to 30 m-wide core zone of the shear zone, S 2 and F 3 are transposed parallel to S 3 and the volcanic rocks are strongly sheared parallel to S 3. The presence of a steeply plunging stretching lineation, together with dextral shear sense indicators along both S 2 and S 3 on horizontal surfaces, suggest that the Johnson shear zone is a dextral transpression zone. Gold was introduced in pyritic, biotitic, and carbonatized mafic volcanic rocks along the core of the shear zone. Mylonitic mafic volcanic rocks contain localized high-grade zones (≥ 10 g/t Au) that differ from wider carbonatized, low-grade zones (< 3 g/t Au) by the presence of deformed gold-bearing quartz-pyrite veins. High-grade zones are also associated with swarms of quartz-pyrite veins that cut across sericitized and carbonatized feldspar porphyry dikes, which acted as brittle, competent bodies during shearing. Gold deposition in the high-grade zones was controlled by the channeling of hydrothermal fluid along the core of the shear zone during shearing of the volcanic rocks, and brittle fracturing of th...|$|R
50|$|Excavations {{conducted}} {{prior to}} commencement {{of building the}} Limerick Southern Ring Road and Limerick Tunnel uncovered treasures such as penannular ring pins, and several post-medieval brick-making kilns. Also recovered were a copper-alloy stick pin, a needle, two saddle querns, <b>burnt</b> stone <b>deposits,</b> and very high quantities of animal bone (including worked antler handles, horn cores, and spindle whorls, indicating textile making), alder wood charcoal, and charred hazelnut shells. The largest site uncovered was an Early Christian ditched enclosure at Coonagh West with a diameter of 40m that exploited a glacial drumlin, including a series of shallow gullies and oak post holes {{both internal and external}} to the enclosure, indicative of houses having been present dating back to the 16th century BC, a 27m trackway that enabled access to and from the river, pits, a hearth, as well as some pottery. Archaeologists suggested that {{it may have been a}} type of ringfort that exploited a dry gravel mound in a predominantly wet and marginal landscape.|$|R
40|$|The 2009 {{excavations}} examined six roundhouses, {{three of}} which had burnt down. Several showed signs of later activity. Trench AL looked at <b>burnt</b> <b>deposits</b> uncovered in a previous trial trench. It revealed a substantial ring-ditch house, 16 m in diameter, which had been repaired and rebuilt before burning down, preserving some wonderful structural charcoal. Later activity {{in the same area}} included two stone hearths. In the east part of the trench, a small post-ring was located from a house c. 7. 6 m in diameter. In the SW corner a rectangular erosion scoop, perhaps a yard, was found. Isolated features included one which had a large fragment of a fired clay structure, perhaps from a kiln or furnace, dumped in it. Further work on the trench D burnt-down house confirmed the phasing from 2008, and added further detail- notably {{what seems to be a}} collapsed partition from the reuse of the building. To the east, trench AM produced another burnt-down ring-ditch house, c. 13. 5 m in diameter. Again there was evidence of later activity, with a hearth set into the destruction deposits, although with no surviving trace of any associated structure. Trench AN returned to roundhouse N and revealed a complex, lengthy sequence of post-roundhouse use, including hints of an overlying, lightly built structure around a cooking pit. An unusual house was revealed in trench AP. This exposed a building which seems to have two entrances. It comprises a ring-groove 10. 2 m in diameter, with no internal post-ring for support the wall took all the weight. Again there was evidence of activity after the house had become structurally unsound. Two further trenches (AO and AQ) confirmed the eastern extent of the site, with a marked fall-off in feature density. AO included an enigmatic small enclosure with a large pit dug through its centre. Among a rich range of finds, pride of place goes to a Romano-British penannular brooch from trench AM. In a separate, short season earlier in the year, further work was carried out on the medieval corn kiln on the site's western edge, while a trial trench down the hill on which Birnie Kirk sits revealed a tantalising wealth of archaeology. ...|$|R
40|$|The 2005 {{excavations}} on {{the later}} prehistoric and medieval site at Birnie, Moray investigated {{two very different}} roundhouses. The main focus was a large house (c. 16 m in diameter), occupied {{around the time of}} the coin hoards, which had burnt down and was very well-preserved. Its full extent was exposed, with an entrance to the south-east, central hearth and internal ring of large structural posts. Preservation was best to the rear, where a ring-ditch lay against the outer wall. In the western half of the building the destruction <b>deposits</b> revealed <b>burnt</b> turfs from the roof and substantial charred timber fragments from the structure of the building. In the eastern half the layers overlying these <b>burnt</b> <b>deposits</b> were removed. Finds included Iron Age yellow glass beads, a sherd of Roman coarse ware (the first Roman pot from Birnie), and two pieces of cannel coal jewellery, another first for the site. These show the inhabitants had connections across the Moray Firth - the nearest source of raw materials is Golspie in Sutherland. Another house partly examined in 2000 was fully exposed. Any internal features had been ploughed away, but a three-phase ring-groove 13. 8 m in diameter was revealed, with an eastern entrance. It is probably a house which was reused as an enclosure. Excavation of a sub-rectangular feature showed it was the sunken floor of a turf-walled building with no earth-fast foundations. It went through a series of phases, the lateste with a cobbled floor. Similar features have been interpreted as medieval, but the finds from this structure suggest a late Iron Age of Pictish date. This is the first hint of Pictish activity at Birnie, but radiocarbon dates are needed to confirm this. A speculative trench on the west of the site, where the site cabins are normally located, uncovered a very rare late Bronze Age metalworking area. A series of pits contained fragments of clay crucibles and moulds for axes pins and bangles. One pit contained the charred remains of a large oak object, perhaps a charred tree trunk from use as an anvil. In another pit, saddle quern and rubber fragments had been deliberately buried, apparently as part of a ritual. A successful series of visits for local schools was held, and around 300 people attended an Open Day...|$|R

40|$|Zinc-bismuth alloys {{have been}} {{suggested}} as materials for running layers in plain bearings to replace lead alloys, because they are environmentally benign [1]. Zinc-bismuth alloys also have melting points higher than zinc-tin alloys and thus {{are considered to be}} superior to the latter. A major challenge in the electrodeposition of zinc-bismuth alloys is the difference in standard potentials of the two metals of 1. 08 V. Thus very little is known on electroplated zinc-bismuth alloys [2]. Cyclic voltammetry and Hull cell experiments have shown that sole complexation of bismuth with common ligands such as gluconate, tartrate or citrate is insufficient to avoid <b>burnt</b> bismuth <b>deposits.</b> A proper choice of bath additives and pH, however, allows the deposition of zinc-bismuth alloys in a composition range and with a morphology, that is suitable for bearing applications [3]. A rotating Hull cell has been used to study the effect of current density and mass transport on the properties of zinc-bismuth alloys electroplated from electrolytes of various compositions. The local alloy composition and layer thickness measured by X-ray fluorescence have been used to calculate current efficiencies for the electrodeposition. The crystallite size and texture of the alloy layers have been measured by X-ray diffraction. Scanning electron microscopy revealed the morphology and energy dispersive analysis of X-rays showed the element distribution in the biphasic deposits. The microhardness of various alloy compositions has been measured on cross sections...|$|R
40|$|It is {{apparent}} from the widespread distribution of burnt mounds that Ireland {{was the most}} prolific user of pyrolithic technology in Bronze Age Europe. Even though burnt mounds {{are the most common}} prehistoric site type in Ireland, they have not received the same level of research as other prehistoric sites. This is primarily due to the paucity of artefact finds and the unspectacular nature of the archaeological remains, compounded by the absence of an appropriate research framework. Due to the widespread use of the technology and the various applications of hot water, narratives related to these sites have revolved around discussions of age and function. This has resulted in a generalised classification, where the term ‘fulacht fia’ covers several site types that have similar features but differing functions and age. The study presents a re-evaluation of fulachtaí fia in light of some 1000 sites excavated in Ireland. This is the most comprehensive study undertaken on the use of pyrolithic technology in prehistoric Ireland, dealing with different aspects of site function, chronology, social role and cultural context. A number of key areas have been identified in relation to our understanding of these sites. Previous investigations of burnt mounds have provided little information on the temporality of individual sites. It has been established that appropriate sampling strategies can provide important information about the formation of individual sites, their relationships {{to each other and to}} other monuments in the same cultural landscape. The evidence suggests that considerable caution should be exercised with regard to certain single radiometric dates from <b>burnt</b> stone <b>deposits,</b> based on the degree of certainty of the dated sample and its association with pyrolithic activity. Previously regarded as Bronze Age in date, there are now numerous examples of pyrolithic-type processes in earlier contexts, with the origins of the water-boiling phenomenon now considered to be Early Neolithic. A review of recent excavation evidence provides new insights into the use of pyrolithic technology for cooking. This is based on the discovery of faunal remains at several sites, combined with insights gained through experimental studies. The model proposed here is of open-air communal feasting and food sharing hosted by small family groups, as a medium for social bonding and the construction of community. It is also argued that if cooking was the primary activity taken place at these sites, this should not be viewed as a mundane functional activity, but rather one that actively contributed to the constitution of social relations. The formality of the technology is also supported by the presence of possible specialised structures, some of which were used for cooking/feasting while others were for ritualised sweat-bathing. The duration and frequency of activities associated with burnt mounds and the opportunities they provided for social interaction suggest that these sites contributed some familiar frames of reference to contemporary discourse...|$|R
40|$|The 2008 {{excavations}} at Birnie (Moray) {{produced a}} wide range of excitement, both structural and artefactual. The story of the burnt-down roundhouse (trench D) became increasingly clear, with the smaller underlying roundhouse (c. 12. 5 m in diameter) more fully exposed and the structure of the later ring-ditch house revealed. A key discovery was that part of the building had been reused prior to its destruction, with structural modifications and intense activity in the south-east of what was by then a fairly ramshackle building. After the fire, a cobbled surface was laid over the area; this may have been the focus for the Pictish activity on the site, as later scooped buildings seem to be ranged around this yard. Trench AH examined a well-preserved ring-ditch house some 15. 5 m in diameter. Unusual features included a monumental double-door entrance, one side of which was closed off or restricted, and a partition separating the entrance passage from the ring ditch. At the end of the house's life a series of pits was dug across the dooreay, with <b>burnt</b> material being <b>deposited</b> in them and in the ring ditch. this is probably a symbolic decommisioning of the structure. The trench also produced our best evidence yet for Pictish buildings. The vestigial remains are best interpreted as floor hollows from two buildings at right angles, with associated features suggesting a cruck roof and a central hearth. A range of striking finds in this trench included a painted pebble, a glass marble or pin head and a short dagger in its sheath. A return to the area west of the coin hoards finally confirmed that a large ring ditch house lurked there too, wiht the 2000 hoard directly in front of its ?blocked doorway. Over this was a series of spreads, rich in charcoal and clay, which probably represent demolition debris from an unrelated later structure in the vicinity; the area was subsequently levelled by cobblilng. Elsewhere in the trench, a much smaller post-ring building some 5 m in diameter was found. In a separate campaign, the medieval corn-drying kiln previously sampled in 2004 was more fully exposed and found to be well-preserved. ...|$|R
