In this study, alkali treatment was performed on kenaf <b>bast</b> <b>fibers</b> in order to remove surface impurities. Grinding and without grinding kenaf <b>bast</b> <b>fibers</b> has been used. Kenaf <b>bast</b> <b>fibers</b> were immersed into 3 %, 6 %, and 9 % concentrated sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solutions for 1 h, 3 h and 6 h. The effects of solution concentrations and treatment times on the mechanical properties of kenaf <b>bast</b> <b>fibers</b> were evaluated.

Besides, results of scanning electron microscope analysis showed that the surface of fiber became cleaner after alkali treatment. In addition, composites reinforced by untreated and alkali-treated kenaf <b>bast</b> <b>fibers</b> were fabricated by using hot press method. Tensile tests were carried out for produced composites.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the fiber dimensions, physical and chemical properties of the bast and without bast stalk of Sahel-Variety of cotton stalk, required samples were prepared and studied. The results showed that fiber and lumen diameter and  cell wall thickness of  without <b>bast</b> stalk <b>fibers</b> were greater than those of <b>bast</b> <b>fibers,</b> while <b>bast</b> <b>fibers</b> were longer. Thus, this fibers can be classified as short and medium length fibers respectively. Data showed that the Length/ Diameter ratio and Runkle ratio of the <b>bast</b> <b>fibers</b> were greater than those of without <b>bast</b> stalk <b>fibers,</b> and flexibility coefficient in without <b>bast</b> stalk <b>fibers</b> was greater. Stalk with higher diameter had less bast proportion. Oven-dried density and swelling and shrinkage values of thicker stalks were greater than those of thinner ones, but apparent and basic densities,as well as porosity in thinner stalks were higher.

Unlike other <b>fibers</b> including cotton, <b>bast</b> <b>fibers</b> possess transverse nodes and fissures in cross-sectional and longitudinal directions. Their morphologies {{and associated}} internal structures were anatomically examined under the scanning electron microscope. The results showed that the morphologies of the nodes and the fissures of <b>bast</b> <b>fibers</b> varied depending on the construction of the inner fibril cellular layers. The transverse nodes and fissures were formed by the folding and spiralling of the cellular layers during plant growth. The dimensions of nodes and fissures were determined by the dislocations of the cellular layers. There were also many longitudinal fissures in <b>bast</b> <b>fibers.</b> Some deep longitudinal fissures even opened the fiber lumen for a short way along the fiber. In addition, the lumen channel of the <b>bast</b> <b>fibers</b> could be disturbed or disrupted by the nodes and the spirals of the internal cellular layers.

40|$|Abstract: The cotton stalk <b>bast</b> <b>fibers</b> are a {{new kind}} of natural {{cellulose}} fibers, which have the similar properties as the flax fibers. Polypropylene (PP) is a type of matrix material and commonly used in composites. The cotton stalk <b>bast</b> <b>fibers</b> as reinforced materials and PP as matrix were used to make {{a new kind of}} composite in the experiment. The composites were prepared by mixing, molding and cold forming. Orthogonal experiment table including mass fraction of fibers, molding temperature, molding pressure and molding time was devised. Then the flexural strength, tensile strength and impact strength were tested and the analysis of range was done. The optimal processing condition was obtained as follows: mass fraction of fibers was 30 %, molding temperature was 190 ˚C, molding pressure was 12 MPa and molding time was 480 s. The result showed that the cotton stalk <b>bast</b> <b>fibers</b> reinforced PP composites had good mechanical properties...|$|R

5000|$|Failed {{attempts}} have been made to exploit rubber (from the latex) and fiber (from seeds' [...] "floss") production from the plant industrially. The fluffy seed hairs have been used as the traditional background for mounted butterflies and other insects. The compressed floss has a beautiful silk-like sheen. The plant has also been explored for commercial use of its bast (inner bark) fiber which is both strong and soft. U. S. Department of Agriculture studies in the 1890s and 1940s found that common milkweed has more potential for commercial processing than any other indigenous <b>bast</b> <b>fiber</b> plant, with estimated yields as high as hemp and quality as good as flax. Both the <b>bast</b> <b>fiber</b> and the floss were used historically by Native Americans for cordage and textiles. Milkweed oil from the seeds can be easily converted into cinnamic acid, which is a very potent sunscreen when used at a 1-5% concentration.|$|E
50|$|Linen is a <b>bast</b> <b>fiber.</b> Flax fibers vary {{in length}} from about 25 to 150 mm (1 to 6 in) and average 12-16 {{micrometers}} in diameter. There are two varieties: shorter tow fibers used for coarser fabrics and longer line fibers used for finer fabrics.

50|$|The {{inner bark}} of Lagetta species—the phloem layer that carries {{nutrients}} from the leaves to the roots—consists of twenty to thirty tough, thin, dense layers of interlacing <b>bast</b> <b>fibers.</b> Whereas in most economically important fibrous plants the <b>bast</b> <b>fibers</b> are formed in straight, parallel lines, in the Lagetta species they separate and rejoin {{to form a}} fine natural net or mesh of tiny rhomboids.

Lacebark is thus unique among other tropical barkcloths in being produced without having to be beaten into shape.|$|R

50|$|The Setralit {{techniques}} are applied either on crushed dry straw of <b>bast</b> <b>fiber</b> plants (mechanical fiber extraction) or on decorticated fibers (long fibers, flax tow).

With the help of modified Setralit techniques the shives may also be upgraded separately.|$|E
50|$|Retting is {{the process}} of extracting fibers from the long lasting life stem or bast of the <b>bast</b> <b>fiber</b> plants.

40|$|Actinomycetes {{isolated}} from 10 different soil and compost samples were screened for production of pectinolytic enzyme activities when grown on pectin-containing {{solid and liquid}} media. Pectinolytic enzymes, detected by using plate diffusion tests with a medium containing ramie (Boehmeria nivea) plant material as the sole carbon source, were mainly pectate lyases, but low activities of pectinesterases were also observed. Polygalacturonases and polymethylgalacturonases were not produced. Multiple forms of pectate lyases were detected in the culture supernatants {{of some of the}} strains by using the zymogram technique of isoelectric focusing gels. Xylanolytic and cellulolytic activities were always found to be associated with pectinolytic activities. None of the pectinolytic enzymes were produced in a medium with glucose as the sole carbon source.
