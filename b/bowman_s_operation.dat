40|$|International audienceFull {{dimensional}} multi-configuration time-dependent Hartree {{calculations of}} {{the zero point}} energy and the tunneling splitting of malonaldehyde using a recently published potential energy surface [Y. Wang, B. J. Braams, J. M. <b>Bowman,</b> <b>S.</b> Carter, and D. P. Tew, J. Chem. Phys. 128, 224314 (2008) ] are reported. The potential energy surface has been approximated by {{a modified version of}} the nmode representation and careful convergence check has been performed to ensure accurate results. The obtained value for the splitting (23. 4 cm− 1) is in acceptable agreement with the experimental value of 21. 583 cm− 1. The computed zero-point-energy is 14 670 cm− 1 which is lower than previous results of Wang et al., but likely to be about 4 cm− 1 too low because of shortcomings of the nmode representation of the potential. The energies reported in this abstract contain a correction to account for neglected vibrational angular momentum terms...|$|R
