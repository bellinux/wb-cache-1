This paper aims to the {{research}} of high voltage lateral {{insulated gate bipolar transistor}} (LIGBT) and proposes the design for reducing the substrate leakage current of this device. The junction between LIGBT’s p-type substrate and n-epi layer may have a large electrical field and causes the hole current to flow during the turn-on state. To prevent this substrate leakage current, an n-type buried layer (NBL) and a p-type buried layer (PBL) are used.

40|$|Abstract: Derived by the {{increasing}} distributed {{electric power generation}} in correlation to large energy grids, {{there is a need}} for active compensation and power-flow control. Equally important is a linking of midsized off-shore windfarms, on which a thyristor-based HVDC conversion and transmission would be inadequate, con-cerning money and space consumption. For the latter, IGBT-based valve technology is looking more promis-ing. In relation to FACTS, the same could be used for STATCOM functionality, emitting both leading and lagging reactive power. The use of that technology however, is posing non neg-ligible problems with transformer insulation at the HVDC converter. The pulses used by the IGBT switches include much higher frequencies than the wanted 50 / 60 Hz, due to their large slew-rate. Therefore, material properties, e. g. electric strength, of common transformer insulation will be analyzed at frequencies of several 10 kHz to some 100 kHz. Accord-ing to <b>break</b> <b>down</b> <b>voltages</b> of transformerboard around 100 kV, at 50 Hz and 1 mm gap, HF-test-voltages of those amplitudes need to be generated.
