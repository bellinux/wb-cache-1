5000|$|A {{full body}} {{taxidermy}} of a two-headed calf {{is on display}} at the Garth and Jerri Frehner Museum of Natural History on the Southern Utah University campus in Cedar City, Utah. [...] "The Dancing Calves" [...] were born by natural delivery with considerable assistance from S. T. Nelson of Cedar City, Utah on Mother's Day, May 8, 1949, to a crossbred cow owned by Willard Lund of Paragonah, Utah. The [...] "Father Bull" [...] is unknown but must have been an outstanding Hereford. The double calf was alive and healthy but died during birth. This calf, or calves, joined together {{from the beginning of the}} neck as far as the belly, with two complete, almost perfect body frames, had but one system of vital organs. Each of the two normal heads had a food channel to one stomach and a <b>breathing</b> <b>channel,</b> or windpipe, to the one set of lungs. The two briskets, or breasts, shared on each side by these calves, contained the one set of lungs on one side and the one heart on the other side. Branching off from the one stomach and digestive system were two channels of elimination. This calf weighed approximately 85 pounds at birth. The over-all measurements as it stands mounted are: 42.5 inches high, 20 inches from tail to tail, and 18 inches from side to side including the front legs. The [...] "Mother Cow" [...] lived and was sold as a [...] "fat cow" [...] in July 1949. This calf was stuffed by Mr. C. J. Sanders, taxidermist, 2631 South State Street, Salt Lake City 5, Utah, who stated that it is the most unusual monstrosity he has ever worked with. Dr. A. C. Johnson, of Cedar City, Utah, stated that this is the best specimen of monstrosity in animal life that he has ever seen or heard of in his 47 years of practice as a veterinarian. [...] "The Dancing Calves" [...] were owned by West and Gail Seegmiller who displayed them for many years at their Desert Pearl Cafe (no longer in existence), in Cedar City, Utah. Dr. A. C. Johnson, Dr. T. Donald Bell, William H. Lund, Dr. R. G. Williams, Dr. J. S. Prestwich, Dr. A. L. Graff, S. T. Nelson, and James Hoyle, Jr. all signed as witnesses that they saw the calf in the flesh soon after birth and knew it to be authentic. The calves and original document were donated to the Garth and Jerri Frehner Museum of Natural History on the Southern Utah University campus in Cedar City, Utah, where they are now on display.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Non-invasive human sensing {{based on}} radio signals has {{attracted}} {{a great deal of}} research interest and fostered a broad range of innovative applications of localization, gesture recognition, smart health-care, etc., for which a primary primitive is to detect human presence. Previous works have studied the detection of moving humans via signal variations caused by human movements. For stationary people, however, existing approaches often employ a prerequisite scenario-tailored calibration of chan-nel profile in human-free environments. Based on in-depth under-standing of human motion induced signal attenuation reflected by PHY layer channel state information (CSI), we propose DeMan, a unified scheme for non-invasive detection of moving and stationary human on commodity WiFi devices. DeMan takes advantage of both amplitude and phase information of CSI to detect moving targets. In addition, DeMan considers human breathing as an intrinsic indicator of stationary human presence and adopts so-phisticated mechanisms to detect particular signal patterns caused by minute chest motions, which could be destroyed by significant whole-body motion or hidden by environmental noises. By doing this, DeMan is capable of simultaneously detecting moving and stationary people with {{only a small number of}} prior measurements for model parameter determination, yet without the cumbersome scenario-specific calibration. Extensive experimental evaluation in typical indoor environments validates the great performance of DeMan in various human poses and locations and diverse channel conditions. Particularly, DeMan provides a detection rate of around 95 % for both moving and stationary people, while identifies human-free scenarios by 96 %, all of which outperforms existing methods by about 30 %.

50|$|Ashtoret lunaris is {{commonly}} encountered sandy and muddy shores, especially near seagrass beds from the intertidal zone {{to a depth}} of 50m. It is usually nocturnal and spends the day buried in the substrate just below the surface creating <b>breathing</b> <b>channels</b> {{to the surface of the}} sand. They hunt small shellfish, worms and other animals during the night, they are known to take other crabs. When threatened A lunaris often draws its legs up under the overlapping edges of the carapace and appears to sham death, this may make it difficult for a predator to dismember the crab.|$|R
40|$|Performers and {{listeners}} (or audience) {{communicate with}} each other in music performances. Many researchers that investigated musical communication focused on communication only via musical sound. Further, in many live performances (especially popular music performance) it has been observed empirically that various kinds of inter-performer, performer-listener, or inter-listener communication occur. This has been examined in previous studies, but only for specific channels. However, it is important to clarify the frequency of usage and importance of communication channels, in order to illustrate the whole process of communication in music performance. Therefore, {{the purpose of this study}} is to explore communication channels extensively. To this end, an investigation was conducted on various performers and listeners based on a communication process model. The results suggested that performers often interact with each other using mainly gaze and <b>breathing</b> <b>channels,</b> not only musical sound, and secondly body movement and facial expression. In addition, transmitted signals and received signals indicated a similar tendency. In performer-listener interaction, transmitted signals and received signals indicated a different pattern. Facial expression and body movement were highly rated, and language was important only as a received signal. It was implied that inter-audience communication rarely occurred, and, even if it exists, a listener only receives signals from other audience, but does not consciously send these signals. This study represents a first step of a broader research that will contribute to the presentation of an overview of communication in music performance. 1...|$|R
40|$|The afferent {{pathways}} mediating cardiovascular and ventilatory hypoxic re-flexes {{were identified}} in anaesthetized, spontaneously <b>breathing</b> (ASB) <b>channel</b> catfish, Ictalurus pimctatus (Rafinesque), by bilateral section of cranial nerve IX and branchial branches of cranial nerve X to the four gill arches (Xbi-Xb 4). Cardiovascular and ventilatory responses to hypoxia and NaCN were attenuated by partial denervation of the gills. There were no significant cardiovascular or ventilatory reflex responses to either hypoxia or NaCN after total branchial denervation. This suggests that hypoxic reflexes in channel catfish are mediated by O 2 -sensitive chemoreceptors located peripherally in the gills and innervated by cranial nerves IX and X...|$|R
40|$|Background: Second {{generation}} extraglottic airway devices with gastric {{access and}} separate <b>breathing</b> <b>channels</b> have {{ushered in a}} new era where their use is increasingly prevalent in surgical patients who would have been traditionally intubated for general anesthesia. New innovations like the i-gel, which is constructed of a thermoplastic elastomer, provide an airtight seal around patient′s perilaryngeal anatomy without the inflatable cuff mechanism found in the laryngeal mask airway supreme (LMAS). Methods: We conducted a randomized controlled trial comparing the LMAS with the i-gel in 70 anesthetized paralyzed patients undergoing laparoscopic female sterilization. Our primary outcome measure was the oropharyngeal leak pressure (OLP). We studied secondary outcomes of successful first attempt insertion rates, time and ease of the airway and gastric tube insertion, leak fractions and pharyngeal morbidity. Results: We found no difference in the OLP between LMAS and i-gel, 25. 9 (4. 2) versus 24. 4 (4. 3) s, P= 0. 153. Both devices had similar first attempt insertion rates (LMAS 94 % vs. i-gel 91 %) with similar ease and comparable times to achieve an effective airway, LMAS 14. 7 (2. 7) versus i-gel 16. 5 (9. 6) s, P= 0. 306, although gastric tube insertion was easier and faster for the LMAS, 7. 9 (1. 9) versus i-gel 14. 8 (7. 7) s, P< 0. 005. Intraoperatively, there was a significantly greater leak fraction with the i-gel of 0. 06 (0. 03) versus 0. 04 (0. 02) with the LMAS, P= 0. 013. Three patients (8. 6 %) with LMAS had mild sore throat; one patient (2. 9 %) had mucosal injury. No complications were documented in the i-gel group. Conclusions: Both these extraglottic airway devices offer similar OLPs, high insertion success rates at the first attempt with similar ease and insertion times (albeit longer gastric tube insertion with i-gel). Both provided effective ventilation despite a higher leak fraction with i-gel that was clinically inconsequential...|$|R

5000|$|Originally {{it seems}} that each {{appendage}} bearing segment had two separate pairs of appendages; and upper and a lower pair. These would later fuse into {{a single pair of}} biramous appendages, with the upper branch acting as a gill while the lower branch was used for locomotion. In some segments of all known arthropods the appendages have been modified, for example to form gills, mouth-parts, antennae for collecting information, or claws for grasping; arthropods are [...] "like Swiss Army knives, each equipped with a unique set of specialized tools." [...] In many arthropods, appendages have vanished from some regions of the body; it is particularly common for abdominal appendages to have disappeared or be highly modified.The most conspicuous specialization of segments is in the head. The four major groups of arthropods - Chelicerata (includes spiders and scorpions), Crustacea (shrimps, lobsters, crabs, etc.), Tracheata (arthropods that <b>breathe</b> via <b>channels</b> into their bodies; includes insects and myriapods), and the extinct trilobites - have heads formed of various combinations of segments, with appendages that are missing or specialized in different ways. In addition, some extinct arthropods, such as Marrella, belong to none of these groups, as their heads are formed by their own particular combinations of segments and specialized appendages.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the thermal switch which {{is composed of}} several switching <b>channels,</b> <b>breathing</b> grooves, reservoirs and actuators to control the liquid column. In the “on ” state, a switching channel is filled with liquid supplied by an actuator, which decreases the thermal resistance. In the “off ” state, the air fills in the gap of two plates instead of the liquid column and the thermal resistance is increased. Through this switch operation, temperature of the designated hot spot can be controlled locally. In order to realize the desired switch operation, the liquid column should be precisely controlled based on channel design. The switching channel is composed of burst area and path area to achieve the smooth operation. The burst area was geometrically designed to provide the hydrophilic surface geometrically by taking into account of burst area. Experiments were performed on a designed switch for the liquid column control and the heat flow regulation.

40|$|Repetitive {{closure of}} the upper-airway characterises obstructive sleep apnea. It {{disrupts}} sleep causing excessive daytime drowsiness, and is linked to hypertension and cardiovascular disease. Previous studies simulating the underlying fluid mechanics of two-dimensional channel flow are based upon velocity-driven boundaries with symmetric positioning of the soft-palate. In {{the first part of}} the present work the two-dimensional work of Balint (2001) is extended to a pressure-driven model where the stability solutions space mapped for the soft-palate, symmetrically placed within viscous channel flow. As a result of this work the modelling of Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA) it is proposed that modelling should focus on nasal breathing as the first indicator for the presence of OSA. Numerical simulations reveal the appearance of amplification of soft-palate displacement over several breathing cycles with asymmetric positioning of the soft-plate and for nasal <b>breathing</b> (single <b>channel</b> flow). Such events increase airway hydraulic resistance at the start of inhalation, a vulnerably period of the breathing cycle for collapse of the pharynx. In the second part of the present work three-dimensional studies are conducted for duct flow and flow through an anatomically correct reconstructed geometry, supporting the findings of the two-dimensional work of the first part. Moreover, extending understanding of anatomical interactions, through development of a three-dimensional geometry reconstruction based on an airway at the end of inhalation. Here the geometry is reconstructed from quantitative date linked to the breathing cycle, captured via an in vivo method using an adapted endoscope technique. Simulations reveal flow mechanisms that produce low-pressure regions on the side walls of the pharynx and on the soft-palate within the pharyngeal section of minimum area. Soft-palate displacement and lateral pharynx-wall deformations reduce further the pressures in these regions creating forces that would tend to narrow the airway owing to flow curvature. These phenomena suggest a mechanism for airway closure in the lateral direction as observed in an bronchoscope study conducted as part of this thesis...|$|R

40|$|P 2 X receptors are trimeric cation {{channels}} that open {{in response to}} the binding of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to a large extracellular domain. The x-ray structure of the P 2 X 4 receptor from zebrafish (zfP 2 X 4) receptor reveals that the extracellular vestibule above the gate opens to the outside through lateral fenestrations, providing a potential pathway for ions to enter and exit the pore. The extracellular region also contains a void at the central axis, providing a second potential pathway. To investigate the energetics of each potential ion permeation pathway, we calculated the electrostatic free energy by solving the Poisson-Boltzmann equation along each of these pathways in the zfP 2 X 4 crystal structure and a homology model of rat P 2 X 2 (rP 2 X 2). We found that the lateral fenestrations are energetically favorable for monovalent cations even in the closed-state structure, whereas the central pathway presents strong electrostatic barriers that would require structural rearrangements to allow for ion accessibility. To probe ion accessibility along these pathways in the rP 2 X 2 receptor, we investigated the modification of introduced Cys residues by methanethiosulfonate (MTS) reagents and constrained structural changes by introducing disulfide bridges. Our results show that MTS reagents can permeate the lateral fenestrations, and that these become larger after ATP binding. Although relatively small MTS reagents can access residues in one of the vestibules within the central pathway, no reactive positions were identified in the upper region of this pathway, and disulfide bridges that constrain movements in that region do not prevent ion conduction. Collectively, these results suggest that ions access the pore using the lateral fenestrations, and that these <b>breathe</b> as the <b>channel</b> opens. The accessibility of ions to one of the chambers in the central pathway likely serves a regulatory function...|$|R
5000|$|Other inward {{currents}} {{that help}} generate intrinsic spiking and bursting in pacemaker neurons are the calcium current and calcium-activated nonspecific currents (ICAN). When a neuron becomes depolarized, voltage gated calcium channels become activated and calcium {{is able to}} flow into the cell which usually leads {{to the release of}} neurotransmitters. Calcium-sensitive dyes have shown that internal concentrations of calcium increase during bursts. The activation of different calcium channels has distinct effects on the activity of neurons in the pre-Bötzinger complex. L-type calcium channels are known to increase the frequency of action potentials in some neurons, which might be the reason calcium influx through these channels has been observed during the augmentation when tissues have low levels of oxygen. P/Q-type calcium channels are mainly responsible for the release of neurotransmitters that excite, or activate, postsynaptic neurons. Studies have shown that blockage of these channels leads to the inhibition of sighs, which indicates calcium flow through these channels is necessary for sighs. Other research has also suggested that calcium flow through N-type calcium channels is essential for normal breathing, and is responsible for the activation of calcium-dependent potassium channels. Calcium-activated nonselective cation currents are important for the intrinsic spiking and bursting activity in CS pacemaker neurons. Metabotropic glutamate 1/5 receptors appear to be important for the increase in intracellular calcium that activate ICAN. The initial burst in a neuron usually leads to the activation of the transient sodium current and the several types of calcium currents.These currents depolarize the cell further enough to activate NMDA receptors and ICAN, which helps cell regenerate its bursts. The ratio between inward and outward currents helps determine the activity of pacemaker neurons in the pre-Bötzinger complex. The major outward currents involved in the regulation of neuron activity are potassium currents. [...] Although the exact role of potassium currents is still being investigated, it appears that potassium and sodium leak currents are crucial for the rhythmicity of the pre-Bötzinger complex. Transient A-type potassium currents are more common in neurons that are involved in the inspiration process. When A-type potassium currents were blocked with 4-AP in slices of the pre-Bötzinger complex, synchronized bursts in inspiratory neurons was affected as well as communication with hypoglossal motor pools that help regulate breathing. This suggests that transient A-type potassium currents are needed for the synchronized bursts in inspiratory neurons and for effective respiratory control. Other potassium channels like large conductance calcium-dependent potassium channels and sodium chloride dependent potassium channels appear to end burst potentials in neurons. Moreover, ATP-dependent potassium channels help neurons detect changes in energy or oxygen levels to modify <b>breathing</b> patterns. These <b>channels</b> are activated by decreases in ATP, which suggests they provide the needed hyperpolarization during hypoxia.|$|R
