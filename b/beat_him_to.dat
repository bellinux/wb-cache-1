5|$|As {{a result}} of a {{defensive}} injury crisis at the club, Carrick started the 2012–13 season as a makeshift centre-back. His inexperience in the role was exploited by Everton in the season opener, as Marouane Fellaini <b>beat</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> a corner kick to score the only goal of the game. He continued in the role for the next match against Fulham. He scored his first goal of the season in a 1–0 Champions League victory against Galatasaray, after series of ball movement leading to Michael Carrick rounding the goalkeeper to score with his left foot. On 24 November 2012, Carrick was left out the squad that defeated QPR 3–1, ending his run of 33 consecutive league starts.|$|E
5|$|After {{his success}} in Belgium with Gent, Mido signed a five-year {{contract}} with Eredivisie team Ajax in 2001. He suffered a concussion during their UEFA Cup match with Limassol, after colliding with a defender. He made his return for the team against Heerenveen, a match which Ajax lost 5–1. However, he was sent off against Twente, after kicking Spira Grujić whilst trying to <b>beat</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> the ball, {{for which he was}} later given a three-match ban. He returned for Ajax against Vitesse, coming on as a substitute in the 75th minute. He failed to be selected for the substitutes bench against Feyenoord in March 2002, which was due to a minor clash with manager Ronald Koeman, and Mido left for a short vacation in Cairo. Mido scored in Ajax's victory over Utrecht in the KNVB Cup final, meaning he ended the 2001–02 season with the Dutch League and Cup double.|$|E

5|$|Danilo Di Luca made {{it clear}} that he was aiming for the time bonuses {{available}} in this stage, both at the finish line and the intermediate sprint. As such, his team worked to bring the morning's breakaway back well before the end of the stage. Just as he had in the mountains, race leader Denis Menchov stayed right with Di Luca, and the two of them contested the intermediate sprint, with Di Luca's team trying to give him a successful leadout. They mistimed it, however, and Menchov was able to come around Di Luca and <b>beat</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> the line (Di Luca's teammate and accomplished sprinter Alessandro Petacchi managed to beat Menchov in the sprint to limit Di Luca's losses). Both Menchov and Di Luca got time bonuses, but Menchov got 4 for second in the sprint and Di Luca 2 for third, padding Menchov's lead in the overall classification.|$|E
5|$|His season's best {{came under}} unusual {{circumstances}} at the British Grand Prix – {{due to a}} system malfunction he was initially timed by hand at dead on ten seconds, which was amended to 9.96s after video evidence was consulted. He could not match that form at the World 100m final: Kim Collins, Darrel Brown, Darren Campbell, and Chambers all finished within a split second {{of each other and}} Chambers was adjudged to have finished fourth. Chambers squandered his anchoring lead in the 4×100m relay, allowing Joshua J. Johnson of the United States team to <b>beat</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> the finish line. In spite of his close fourth and a relay silver medal, {{there was a sense of}} disappointment in the press that Chambers' record breaking claims and gold medals had not materialised.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Megan {{spends time}} with her {{daughter}} Lacey (Mary Mouser), who is upset about having Kate in her father's life. Megan comforts her, and Lacey reassures Megan that Kate will not replace her. Megan visits the new crime scene, investigating why Patrick Deline (Brad Standley), is found dead. On the other case, it is revealed that Martin is not the father of Julie's child, but after much evidence is checked, {{it is in fact}} Patrick, the person who was killed in Megan's case. Julie had asked his old school friend Patrick to be the father of her child, as she wanted someone that she knew. Her request made both Patrick his partner, Steve Turtell (Michael Dean Connolly) cry. The couple and Julie had not told Martin, as Martin divorced ex-wife Alexandra after Patrick introduced Julie to Martin, when he was decorating the Loeb's house. It is revealed that Alan, the financial director, killed both Patrick and Julie. Alan kept stealing from Martin, and was found out by Patrick, so he <b>beat</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> death. Julie also found out, so he panicked, and shot her. Alan begs for forgiveness towards Martin, who in anger, shoots Alan, in front of Bud and Samantha and is consequently arrested, whilst Alan dies.|$|E

Armstrong's eighteen successful title defenses {{were the most}} in history in the Welterweight division. In 1941, they boxed a rematch, this time, Zivic stopping Armstrong in 12 rounds. In 1942, Armstrong's record was 13–1, including wins over world champions (Fritzie) Zivic, Jenkins and Zurita.|$|E

25|$|The {{organisation}} of the 1930–31 tour gave Vizzy {{a standing}} in Indian cricket that was {{second only to}} the Maharaja of Patiala. About this time, Patiala fell out with Lord Willingdon, the viceroy of India, and Vizzy got close with the viceroy. He donated a pavilion named after the viceroy in the newly constructed Feroz Shah Kotla ground in Delhi.

25|$|As the Laotian Civil War flared, the Central Intelligence Agency {{established}} a secret guerrilla {{army in the}} Plain of Jars. Interposed between the communist settlement around Xam Neua and the Royal Lao Government in Vientiane, the Hmong military irregulars fought {{to hold on to}} their traditional territory, and to preserve Laos. After the failure and defeat of Operation Pigfat and Operation Raindance in early 1969, the communists had overrun the Plain of Jars to within ten kilometers of the guerrillas' main base at Long Chieng.

Eventually, Donnelly relented and the fight was staged {{on the banks of}} the Grand Canal. The event aroused a great deal of interest in Dublin, and a good crowd turned up. Right up to the time they took sparring positions, Donnelly tried to talk his rival out of fighting, but his pleas fell on deaf ears.

Donnelly was declared the new champion of the city.|$|E

25|$|After asking Gibson to {{take over}} his {{personal}} finances and switching his management from Jacobs and Roxborough to Marshall Miles, the Louis camp negotiated {{a deal with the}} IRS under which Louis would come out of retirement, with all Louis's net proceeds going to the IRS. A match with Ezzard Charles—who had acquired the vacant heavyweight title in June 1949 by outpointing Walcott—was set for September 27, 1950. By then, Louis was 36 years old and had been away from competitive boxing for two years. Weighing in at 218, Louis was still strong, but his reflexes were gone. Charles repeatedly <b>beat</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> the punch. By the end of the fight, Louis was cut above both eyes, one of which was shut tight by swelling. He knew he had lost even before Charles was declared the winner. The result was not the only disappointing aspect of the fight for Louis; only 22,357 spectators paid to witness the event at Yankee Stadium, and his share of the purse was a mere $100,458. Louis had to continue fighting.|$|E
25|$|As the Laotian Civil War flared, the Central Intelligence Agency {{established}} a secret guerrilla {{army in the}} Plain of Jars. Interposed between the communist settlement around Xam Neua and the Royal Lao Government in Vientiane, the Hmong military irregulars fought {{to hold on to}} their traditional territory, and to preserve Laos. After the failure and defeat of Operation Pigfat and Operation Raindance in early 1969, the communists had overrun the Plain of Jars to within ten kilometers of the guerrillas' main base at Long Chieng. As a riposte, Hmong General Vang Pao plotted another spoiling offensive against the pressing communists. However, the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) <b>beat</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> it with Campaign Thoan Thang. After the Vietnamese campaign ran its course, Vang Pao launched yet another inconclusive offensive that failed to clear the foe from the Plain of Jars, Operation Off Balance. By 28 June 1969, the PAVN had 60 tanks deployed. Additionally, there were seven new Vietnamese infantry battalions poised on the Plain, while the Royalist remained unreinforced. The PAVN now had a total of 26 battalions in the Plain of Jars area, seemingly poised for a further wet season offensive.|$|E
25|$|There were {{no changes}} in the {{classification}} until another summit finish on the sixth stage, when Rodríguez and Froome were the two contenders for the stage victory. Froome had attacked to bring himself and Rodríguez, but a second attack from Rodríguez brought him clear, and with time bonuses on the line, extended his lead to ten seconds. In Andorra, it again {{came down to the}} main favourites for the race; for a time, Alberto Contador attacked off the front and maintained a lead of around ten seconds – looking for his first victory since his return from a doping ban – before tying up and Valverde and Rodríguez <b>beat</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> the line, with Froome having cracked further back. Rodríguez put another twenty seconds into his lead the following day after attacking on the final climb, and his advantage of around a minute prior to the individual time trial was sufficient for him to maintain the lead after the stage; he put in the seventh-fastest time on the stage to keep the leader's jersey, but by only a second from Contador, who moved ahead of Froome in the classification. As a result, Rodríguez topped the overall standings with the more mountainous second half of the Vuelta still to race.|$|E
