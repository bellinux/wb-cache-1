40|$|Plastid {{transformation}} is a well-established tool for biotechnology as it allows highexpression levels of proteins {{and as it}} provides <b>biological</b> transgene <b>containment</b> because of maternal inheritance of cytoplasmic genes in most crops. In basic research the function and regulation of plastid encoded genes can be further studied {{with the help of}} plastid transformation. This study is focused on the three most critical steps to achieve plastid transformation in Arabidopsis thaliana and Rapid-Cycling Brassica rapa (RCBr), the establishment of a regeneration protocol, the construction of species specific vectors and the use of different transformation protocols. First, to allow the generation of fertile plants out of transformed cells, a reliable regeneration protocol was established. Fertile plants of Arabidopsis thaliana were obtained with high regeneration efficiencies from cotyledons, seed derived calli and protoplasts. In RCBr, fertile plants could be regenerated from tissue culture of hypocotyls. For introduction of genes into plastids, appropriate vectors with different selection and visual markers were constructed. These ensure site specific integration of desired sequences and enable selection of transformed cell lines. In this study, species specific vectors for Nicotiana tabacum, Arabidopsis thaliana and RCBr were designed and cloned, using aminoglycoside resistance markers such as the aadA gene (confers resistance to spectinomycin and streptinomycin), the nptII or the aphA 6 gene (conferring resistance to kanamycin). To allow the selection through the herbicides phosphinothricin or bialaphos, the bar gene was employed. In addition, fluorescence markers such as GFP, DsRed and AmCyan were taken as visual markers. After the establishment of a regeneration protocol and the construction of specific vectors, two different protocols for plastid transformation, the particle gun- or PEG (Polyethylene glycol) -mediated transformation method, were applied. However, no transformed plant in Arabidopsis thaliana and RCBr could be recovered so far. That the transformation protocol does work in principal could be shown by the use of Nicotiana tabacum. Plastids of Nicotiana tabacum were successfully transformed using both transformation methods and AmCyan as new visual marker. Out of these experiments, fertile homoplasmic tobacco plants could be obtained as was shown by Southern blot analysis and reciprocal crosses. Thus, the functionality of the used transgene expression cassettes was clearly proven...|$|R
40|$|The {{resistance}} of polylactide to biodegradation {{and the physical}} properties of this polymer can be controlled by adjusting the ratio of l-lactic acid to d-lactic acid. Although the largest demand is for the l enantiomer, substantial amounts of both enantiomers are required for bioplastics. We constructed derivatives of Escherichia coli W 3110 (prototrophic) as new biocatalysts {{for the production of}} d-lactic acid. These strains (SZ 40, SZ 58, and SZ 63) require only mineral salts as nutrients and lack all plasmids and antibiotic resistance genes used during construction. d-Lactic acid production by these new strains approached the theoretical maximum yield of two molecules per glucose molecule. The chemical purity of this d-lactic acid was âˆ¼ 98 % with respect to soluble organic compounds. The optical purity exceeded 99 %. Competing pathways were eliminated by chromosomal inactivation of genes encoding fumarate reductase (frdABCD), alcohol/aldehyde dehydrogenase (adhE), and pyruvate formate lyase (pflB). The cell yield and lactate productivity were increased by a further mutation in the acetate kinase gene (ackA). Similar improvements could be achieved by addition of 10 mM acetate or by an initial period of aeration. All three approaches reduced the time required to complete the fermentation of 5 % glucose. The use of mineral salts medium, the lack of antibiotic resistance genes or plasmids, the high yield of d-lactate, and the high product purity should reduce costs associated with nutrients, purification, <b>containment,</b> <b>biological</b> oxygen demand, and waste treatment...|$|R

30|$|When Cohen {{reported}} that his research enables scientists {{to cross the}} species barriers, suggesting the invention or creation of new species, U.S. politicians started, soon after, to draft regulations {{for the application of}} GMOs [17]. This in turn alerted those scientists that envisaged large economic potential based on their work and patents, and in 1977, a draft law for GMO regulation was stalled when Cohen convinced politicians that the results of the new technology could also have appeared in nature. Expecting a revolution in biology and an immense impact on business, genetic engineering was declared as equivalent to conventional breeding methods, meaning a GMO is not a new organism with unforeseeable risks and does not require specific regulation [18]. In 1976, the NIH adopted guidelines, which set up a system based on <b>biological</b> and physical <b>containments.</b> Later, the U.S. National Research Council formalised the risk assessment approach [19]. When in 1983 the first GM bacteria and plants were released in field trials in California, the existing health protection guideline concept was applied to assess possible environmental risks [20]. The U.S. has opted using existing frameworks to set up a consultation system. 1 Nowadays, genes and proteins that render herbicide tolerance to GM plants are assessed and deregulated according to the rules for food additives; plants possessing Bt genes and proteins fall under the pesticide approval rules and growth hormone-producing fish has to be checked under the procedures for approval of animal drugs. Two recent U.S. law cases stated that the procedure agreed upon by the authorities and the applicant for deregulating herbicide-resistant golf lawn grass and alfalfa were faulty. A more rigid assessment under the norms of U.S. environmental laws had to be conducted. With these court decisions it seems that GM plants that can interact substantially with wild or domesticated genetic resources via pollen flow must undergo a more detailed risk assessment in the USA as, for example, GM soy or maize. It remains open until a final supreme court decision, if and how these court cases will influence the future GM crop regulation in the USA.|$|R
50|$|Because tobacco has {{a strong}} {{tendency}} towards self-fertilisation, the reliability of transplastomic plants {{is assumed to be}} even higher under field conditions. Therefore, the researchers believe that only one in 100,000,000 GM tobacco plants actually would transmit the transgene via pollen. Such values are more than satisfactory to ensure coexistence. However, for GM crops used in the production of pharmaceuticals, or in other cases in which absolutely no outcrossing is permitted, the researchers recommend the combination of chloroplast transformation with other <b>biological</b> <b>containment</b> methods, such as cytoplasmic male sterility or transgene mitigation strategies.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to agricultural measures, {{there may be}} also biological tools to prevent the genetically modified crop from fertilising conventional fields. Researchers are investigating methods either to prevent GM crops from producing pollen at all (for example male-sterile plants), or to develop GM crops with pollen that nonetheless does not contain the additional, genetically engineered material. In {{an example of the}} latter, transplastomic plants can be generated in which the genetic modification has been integrated in the DNA of chloroplasts - the cell nucleus contains no transgenes and thus the pollen contains no chloroplasts and thus no transgenes. Two important research projects on co-existence are and Co-Extra.

40|$|There are {{different}} possibilities of <b>biological</b> <b>containment</b> to restrict {{and to prevent}} the dispersal of bacterial recombinant DNA after the deliberate release: The use of plasmids with a confined host-range neither transferable by conjugation nor mobilisable, has to be mentioned in this contents. Binding of the recombinant DNA to a specific host is more efficient by integrating the genetical material into the bacterial chromosome. To prevent the dispersal of the organism itself mutations are introduced that lower the competitiveness with the natural bacterial flora leading to a long-term elimination. Another way to eliminate the deliberate released bacteria is the inducible expression of lethal genes. There are some serious problems {{with the formation of}} resistant bacteria and effective practical use of the inducing molecules. Considering this none of the introduced systems can said to be a practicable biological containment-mechanism. Genetically modified poxviruses are used for the control of rabies. In this case the <b>biological</b> <b>containment</b> is based on the inactivation of the thymidin-kinase-gene (tk), which is important for the virulence of the virus. The inactivation of the tk-gene is due to the insertion of the glycoprotein G-gene of the rabies-virus. This leads to the expression of the glycoprotein G-gene inducing the production of antibodies against the rabies virus. Baculoviruses are used to control insect pest and valid to have highly restricted host ranges. The <b>biological</b> <b>containment</b> is based on the reduction of the ecological fitness by inactivation of the polyhedrin-codinggene. <b>Biological</b> <b>containment</b> of plants (Nicotiana tabacum, Brassica napus) is tried to be achieved by the induction of male sterility.
