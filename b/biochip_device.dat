40|$|A {{microfluidic}} <b>biochip</b> <b>device</b> {{has been}} designed and proven to withstand temperatures up to ap-proximately 90 ◦C. Although effective for some of our applications, there is a desire to increase this temperature an additional 5 to 7 degrees. The chamber design (schematic is shown in Figure 1) consists of an inlet, a reaction chamber, a waste chamber, a channel connecting the reaction chamber to the waste chamber, and a vent hole. The reaction chamber volumes are low enough that surface tension dominates. The current microfluidic design does not require hydrophobic stops for the liquid containment, and for manu-facturing reasons, it is preferred not to have this feature added. The inlet is sealed prior {{to the increase in}} temperature elevation, but the vent remains open. Our goal is to design a connecting channel which prevents the liquid in the reaction chamber from entering the waste chamber during a 5 minute temperature elevation step...|$|E
40|$|Trapping {{ability on}} a <b>biochip</b> <b>device</b> {{is useful for}} {{systematic}} cell addressing and real-time observation of single cells analysis, however, precise control over the cell movements remains challenging. This thesis addresses the problem of controlling movement of single cells on a biochip platform by a technique called the Dielectrophoretic (DEP) force. Existing researches showed that the DEP force offers precise control of cell movements through various microelectrode designs which generate strong polarization effects i. e., DEP forces, but with the expense of damaging cell’s structure. The thesis contribute three new microelectrode designs for trapping single cells: the dipole, the quadrupole and the adaptive octupole, structured on a metal-insulator-metal (multilayer) biochip platform called the Sandwiched Insulator with Back Contact (SIBC) biochip. Cores of the study lie on the microelectrode designs {{that are capable of}} generating strong DEP holding forces, the back contact to enhance trapping of single cells and the fabrication process of creating a metal-insulator-metal structure. This thesis also presents details on the experimental setups of the trapping experiments and the numerical analysis of the microelectrode designs. The SIBC biochip comprises of the back contact on the first metal layer, the microcavity (cell trap) on the insulator layer and the three microelectrodes on the second metal layer. Together, the three microelectrodes and the back contact generate DEP forces that attract particles/single cells toward microcavities and maintain their positioning in the traps. Prior to the fabrication, profiles of the DEP force generated by the microelectrodes are studied using COMSOL 3. 5 a software. Simulation results suggest that the DEP trapping region can be created surrounding the microcavity if the microelectrode and the back contact are connected with AC signals that have different phases. The strongest DEP force can be obtained by setting the back contact and the microelectrodes with AC signals that have 180 degree phase difference. Evaluations on the trapping functionality for the three microelectrodes were conducted using polystyrene microbeads and Ishikawa cancer cells line suspended in various medium. Trapping capability of the three microelectrodes was demonstrated through experiments with 22 percent of the Ishikawa cancer cells and 17 percent of the polystyrene microbeads were successfully trapped. With these promising results, the new microelectrode designs together with the SIBC biochip structure have huge potentials for biomedical applications particularly in the field of diagnosis and identification of diseases...|$|E

Precision laser micromachining is an ideal flexible manufacturing technique for such materials with the ability to fabricate structures to sub-micron resolutions and a proven track record in manufacturing scale up. Described here is the manufacture of a range of optical <b>biochip</b> <b>devices</b> and components using laser micromachining techniques.

All current hCC assays are based on ex vivo detection. Here we describe the generation and evaluation of antibodies that allow the repetitive binding and release of hCC and hCC-fusion proteins, a prerequisite for long-term measurement, which is required for compatibility with implantable <b>biochip</b> <b>devices</b> and {{for the development of}} innovative antibody-based assays suitable for continuous in vivo and in vitro monitoring. Recombinant hCC and hCC-fusion proteins were produced in Escherichia coli and HEK 293 T cells and were used to generate antibodies by hybridoma technology. After screening by indirect and sandwich ELISAs, 12 monoclonal hybridoma cell lines producing hCC-specific monoclonal antibodies were identified. To determine their hCC association and dissociation properties, the antibodies were analysed by surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy, revealing three with the desired fast binding and moderate-to-fast release characteristics. The analysis of binding and dissociation in the presence of hCC and hCC-fusion proteins using fluorescence-based replacement assays showed that mAb CyDI- 4 was the most suitable for further analysis. The results showed that repetitive replacement on mAb CyDI- 4 was possible and that most of the change in signal intensity occurred after 20 - 30 min. Furthermore, the suitability of mAb CyDI- 4 for serum hCC measurement was confirmed by a fluorescence-based replacement assay using serially-diluted reference serum from the Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements (ERM-DA 471 /IFCC).

40|$|We have {{developed}} a range of optical <b>biochip</b> <b>devices</b> for conducting live and fixed cell-based assays. The devices encompass the ability to process an entire assay including fluorescently labelling cells, a microfluidic system to transport and maintain cells to deliver them to an optical area of the device for measurement, {{with the possibility of}} a incorporating a sorting step in between. On-chip excitation provided by red emitting LED and lasers define the excitation wavelength of the fluorophore to be incorporated into the assay readout. The challenge for such an integrated microfluidic optical biochip has been to identify and characterise a longterm fluorescent label suitable for tracking cell proliferation status in living cells. Traditional organic fluorophores have inherent disadvantages when considering their use for an on-chip device requiring longterm cellular tracking. This has led us to utilise inorganic quantum dots (QDots) as fluorophores for on- chip assays. QDs have unique properties such as photostability, broad absorption and narrow emission spectra and are available in a range of emission wavelengths including far red. They also have much higher quantum efficiencies than traditional organic fluorophores thus increasing the possible dynamic range for on-chip detection. Some of the QDots used have the added advantage of labelling intact cells and being retained and distributed among daughter cells at division, allowing their detection for up to 6 generations. The use of these QDs off-chip has suggested that they are ideal for live cell, non-perturbing labelling of division events, whereby over time the QD signal becomes diluted with each generation. Here we describe the use of quantum dots as live cell tracers for proliferating populations and the potential applications in drug screening and optical biochip environments...|$|R
40|$|Bioreactive {{surfaces}} are seminal to the fabrication of semiconductor-based <b>biochip</b> <b>devices.</b> Their efficient preparation by {{the reaction of}} silicon with organic molecules, and the characterization of the formed monolayer films with spectroscopic and electrochemical techniques were the main objectives of the research described in this thesis. For {{the formation of a}} carboxy-terminated monolayer on silicon the conventional protocol consists of two steps: thermally or photochemically initiated reaction of an ester (CH 2 =CH(CH 2) xCOOR) with hydrogen-terminated silicon (111) and subsequent hydrolysis. Vibrational sum frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopic {{studies have shown that the}} ester hydrolysis is incomplete and disrupts the molecular orientation of the monolayer structure. Searching for a more direct route to bioreactive silicon surfaces, the kinetics of photochemical reactions of silicon with various organic molecules were investigated. It was found that under UV irradiation, alkenes react much faster than alkanoic acids. Therefore, the reaction of bifunctional molecules can be controlled to preferentially attach the alkene terminus to the silicon surface. Such a one-step reaction eliminates the complications encountered during ester hydrolysis. Studies of DNA monolayers immobilized on silicon revealed that their molecular orientation depends on the DNA-cation affinity: during immobilization of single-stranded DNA, the perturbation of molecular orientation of the monolayer occurred in the order Mg 2 + > Ca 2 + > K+ ~ Na+, whereas, during hybridization, disruption of the monolayer occurred in the order K+ ~ Na+ > Mg 2 + ~ Ca 2 +. A reliable metal contact on top of organically modified silicon is vital for solid-state electrical measurements. The thermal and sputtering metal deposition protocols have been assessed with SFG spectroscopy and by the electrical characterizations; the deposited gold penetrated and damaged the monolayers in both cases. Therefore, a device using a mercury drop electrode was designed and tested with the hydrogen terminated and the decane monolayer on silicon (111). The J-V curves proved that the mercury contact preserved the monolayer. Furthermore, the capabilities of the device to reveal electrical properties such as effective barrier height and ideality factor in relation to the molecular structures of ω-functionalized monolayers have been demonstrated. These findings are seminal to the future development of DNA-based molecular junctions...|$|R

A more precise control of the fluid flow can be achieved by piezoelectrically agitated surface acoustic waves (SAW) generated by interdigital transducers on top of the chip, traveling across the surface and entering the fluid filled channels. The fluid and SAW interaction can be described by a mathematical model which consists of a coupling of the piezoelectric equations and the compressible Navier-Stokes equations featuring processes that occur on vastly different time scales.

The bio-nanobattery under development at NASA s Langley Research Center provides new capabilities for electrical power generation, storage, and distribution {{as compared to}} conventional power storage systems. Most currently available electronic systems and devices rely on a single, centralized power source to supply electrical power to a specified location in the circuit. As electronic devices and associated components continue to shrink in size towards the nanometer-scale, a single centralized power source becomes impractical. Small systems, such as these, will require distributed power elements to reduce Joule heating, to minimize wiring quantities, and to allow autonomous operation of the various functions performed by the circuit. Our research involves the development and characterization of a bio-nanobattery using ferritins reconstituted with both an iron core (Fe-ferritin) and a cobalt core (Co-ferritin). Synthesis and characterization of the Co-ferritin and Fe-ferritin electrodes were performed, including reducing capability and the half-cell electrical potentials. Electrical output of nearly 0. 5 V for the battery cell was measured. Ferritin utilizing other metallic cores were also considered to increase the overall electrical output. Two dimensional ferritin arrays were produced on various substrates to demonstrate the feasibility of a thin-film nano-scaled power storage system for distributed power storage applications. The bio-nanobattery will be ideal for nanometerscaled electronic applications, due to the small size, high energy density, and flexible thin-film structure.

As an another approach, quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) and surface acoustic wave (SAW) sensors in both {{have been used for}} an element detecting the mass change. A QCM sensor using a bulk wave traveling through the interior of the piezoelectric element is already commercialized with the operation frequency with 5 to 30 MHz depending on the quartz thickness. In contrast, a SAW is caused to occur by applying a high frequency to the interdigital transducer (IDT) electrode disposed on the piezoelectric surface. Operating frequency depends on the IDT width and can easily generate frequencies in the MHz band by semiconductor processing technology. A mass change of the solution occurs in the signal with highly sensitive operation, thereby solution sensor of the SAW method has been expected. The {{purpose of this study is}} to produce a liquid phase system sensor using a longitudinal wave radiation into a liquid phase by Rayleigh wave, which is one of the SAW mode.
