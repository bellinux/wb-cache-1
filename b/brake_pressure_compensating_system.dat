40|$|This paper {{analyses}} the damping in <b>pressure</b> <b>compensated</b> closed centre mobile working hydraulic systems. Both rotational and linear loads {{are covered}} and the analysis applies to {{any type of}} pump controller. Only the outlet orifice in the directional valve will provide damping to a <b>pressure</b> <b>compensated</b> <b>system.</b> Design rules are proposed for how the system should be dimensioned {{in order to obtain}} a high damping. The volumes {{on each side of the}} load have a high impact on the damping. In case of a small volume on the inlet side, the damping becomes low. However, the most important thing is to design the outlet orifice area properly. There exists an optimal orifice dimension for maximized damping; both smaller and larger orifice areas give lower damping independently of the volumes. This paper presents a method to dimension the outlet orifice area and the load volumes in order to obtain a desired system damping. Experimental results, which confirm the theoretical expectations, are also presented. The conclusions are that it is possible to obtain a high damping contribution from the outlet orifice if the system is dimensioned correctly. However, the energy efficiency needs to be considered while improving the dampin...|$|R
40|$|Up to day, drip {{irrigation}} systems have reached {{to a high}} level of technology. But, these systems are not able to show their potential benefits, due to various reasons. Emitter clogging can affect distribution uniformity and the system performance, which has direct relationship with water quality. In this study five types of emitters with different nominal discharges, with or without self-flushing system and with or without <b>pressure</b> <b>compensating</b> <b>system</b> were evaluated under three management schemes; untreated well water (S 1), acidic treated water (S 2) and magnetic treated water (S 3) in order to reduce chemical clogging. Flow reduction rate, statistical uniformity coefficient (Uc), emission uniformity coefficient (Eu) and variation coefficient of emitters’ performance in the field (Vf) were monitored. The emitter performance indexes (Uc and Eu) decreased during the experiment due to emitter clogging. The Uc and Eu values in different management schemes confirmed that the acidification has better performance than the magnetic water in order to control emitter clogging and keep high distribution uniformity. Regarding to Vf values, the priority of untreated and treated water was as S 2 >S 3 >S 1 for each emitter. </p...|$|R
40|$|An {{innovative}} and unique working concept for variable delivery external gear machines (VD-EGMs) {{is presented in}} this study. The proposed design not only encompasses all the well-known and important advantages of traditional external gear machines but also introduces a feature for varying the displacement (flow delivered per unit revolution). The novel principle of achieving variable displacement in EGMs {{is based on the}} variable timing of the connections of the displacement chambers/tooth space volumes (TSVs) with the inlet/outlet ports. The timing variation is obtained by the addition of a simple element (called a “slider”) within the lateral bushings. The position of the slider determines the amount of flow displaced per unit revolution. Starting from the geometry of the design and the proposed concept, analytical expressions for predicting displacement variation, flow rate and input shaft torque were derived. With this working principle, the range of variation of the displacement can be significantly increased by modifying the gear profiles. Therefore, in this work, novel gears with asymmetric teeth profile are designed {{with the help of a}} novel tool developed particularly for this process. However, due to the inherent nature of the displacing action of the EGM due to the meshing of the gears, it is not possible to achieve a full flow variation from 0 %- 100 %. Therefore, to maximize the range of flow variation while considering all the other important performance features of the machine to be maintained at an optimum, a multi-objective genetic algorithm based optimization method is used to identify the optimal design of gears and grooves in the lateral bushings. The performance of the design configurations were analyzed in detail by using HYGESIM (HYdraulic GEar machines SIMulator) Simulation tool. An optimal design of the machine was identified which was capable of maximizing the reduction (100 %– 68 %) in flow variation, thereby providing lower delivery flow at the expense of reduced torque (hence reduced input power). The validity of the proposed novel VD-EGM was demonstrated using a proof of concept test performed using the prototypes of the optimal design. The simulated results provided by HYGESim were validated with those obtained from the measured data thereby accomplishing a very good agreement between the experimental data and the model predictions. The successful proof of concept test results, lead to the design of two flow control actuation systems which represent a manual system and an automatic <b>pressure</b> <b>compensated</b> <b>system.</b> The performances of the prototypes were analyzed using a steady state test rig. Experimental results show that the flow rate and input shaft torque reduces proportionally with displacement in the case of the manual flow control system. The measured volumetric efficiencies at lower levels of displacement were found to be lesser than those at maximum displacement, which are in line with the performance of typical other VD units in the market. The flow control actuation system based on pressure compensator principle was designed to reduce the flow automatically depending on the pressure at the outlet. Experimental performance of the VD-EGM with <b>pressure</b> <b>compensated</b> actuation <b>system</b> show that the delivered flow reduces automatically after the preset pressure is reached. The input shaft torque was also seen to reduce proportionally with the corresponding displacement. The experimental results show positive potentials in the working concept of the VD-EGM, which would lead to a new direction in designing cost effective VD units that can be used in place of fixed displacement units to provide the additional flow on demand functionality; thereby significantly increasing the overall energy efficiency of the hydraulic system in which the VD-EGM is used. ...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{research}} suggests that drivers use specific visual information to execute braking behaviors [Faj 05] and that drivers calibrate braking behavior to this visual information over time [Faj 09]. Specifically, Fajen (2005) argued that when successfully braking, participants adjust <b>braking</b> <b>pressure</b> to maintain a visually-specified ideal <b>braking</b> <b>pressure</b> less than one’s maximum ability to brake. In the current paper, we investigated whether factors, specifically one’s emotional state, would alter the relationship between braking behavior and visually-specified ideal <b>braking</b> <b>pressure</b> over time. Specifically, we investigated whether the performance of braking changed when anxious. Previous research demonstrated that anxiety influences static perceptual judgments of space [Gra 12] {{and the performance of}} open-loop sports actions [Bei 10]. Open-loop actions are actions where once the movement has been initiated there are no opportunities to alter the outcome (i. e., putting a golf ball). This research shows an influence of anxiety on static perceptual tasks and the performance of open-loop actions suggesting that anxiety may also influence more complex everyday actions like braking. It is important to know whether, and how, the influence of anxiety extends to the performance of closedloop actions like braking given the potential realworld consequences of poor performance...|$|R
