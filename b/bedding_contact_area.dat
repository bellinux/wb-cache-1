40|$|Although {{compaction}} of viscoelastic powders is {{an important}} process in food, pharmaceutical, ceramic and detergent industries, current scale-up methodologies are highly based on trial error. This research work aims to make compaction of viscoelastic powders more mechanistic by relating the microscopic phenomenon of <b>contact</b> <b>area</b> formation during powder consolidation, to the macroscopic compact properties, viz. density and tensile strength. Pharmaceutical (MCC-APAP) and food (Soy protein based) powders were selected for this purpose. Variation of compact density and tensile strength of MCC-APAP mixtures was studied {{as a function of}} compaction pressure, drug (APAP) and moisture contents. The density and tensile strength of Soy Flour and Soy Protein compacts was studied as a function of compaction pressure. Lower APAP and higher moisture contents were found to favor formation of denser compacts with higher tensile strength. Soy flour compacts were found to be slightly denser but exhibited much lower tensile strength compared to Soy Protein Concentrate. At a given compact porosity, the tensile strength of MCC based powders was found to be higher compared to Soy powders. The maximum viscoelastic <b>contact</b> <b>area</b> between two particles was estimated using Lum-Duncan Hewitt model (1999) combining viscoelastic properties, compaction pressure and time as input variables. Measurement of compaction and viscoelastic properties confirmed that while addition of drug and moisture decreased and increased the deformability of MCC particles, Soy Protein concentrate particles were much more deformable compared to Soy Flour. This claim of higher deformability was supported by higher true strains of individual powder <b>beds</b> and normalized <b>contact</b> <b>area</b> between two particles. It was also concluded that MCC particles are much more deformable compared to soy powders. Semi-analytical models were proposed to predict the density of compacts made from each powder, as a function of total viscoelastic <b>contact</b> <b>area</b> in the compact, bulk and maximum compact densities as well as coordination number. It was proposed that the rate of density increase was determined by the total <b>contact</b> <b>area</b> corresponding to the average of density range. The tensile strength was found to exponentially increase with <b>contact</b> <b>area.</b> However, compacts at same porosity were found to exhibit markedly different tensile strengths suggesting the importance of including particle bonding properties to estimate <b>contact</b> <b>area.</b> Thus, it was shown that <b>contact</b> <b>area</b> takes into account the important raw material and compaction variables hence enhancing the mechanistic understanding of viscoelastic powder compaction. Limitations of results were also discussed and specifics of future studies were proposed in order to develop more fundamental models to predict compact density and tensile strength. ...|$|R

40|$|Most {{engineers}} describe {{sliding friction}} using the friction coefficient, {{the ratio of}} frictional force to normal force. While this proportionality is very simple, its origin is not trivial at all and has been subject of investigation {{for more than a}} century. The current consensus is that both frictional and normal force are proportional to the 'real contact area'. Surface roughness prevents surfaces from coming into full contact; the real <b>contact</b> <b>area</b> is simply the fraction of the apparent <b>contact</b> <b>area</b> in which the two surfaces are in molecular contact. In this thesis, we experimentally test the relation between normal force, real <b>contact</b> <b>area</b> and friction. This is not an easy task; there are no existing experimental techniques that allow measurement of the real <b>contact</b> <b>area</b> at rough interfaces with molecular-scale sensitivity. We synthesize custom-made pressure sensitive fluorescent molecules and immobilize them at the frictional interface such that they reveal the real <b>contact</b> <b>area</b> through their fluorescence intensity. This technique enables us to experimentally test contact and friction mechanics. We find that the real <b>contact</b> <b>area</b> is not proportional to the normal force due to the specific type of plastic deformations that control contact formation. We show that friction is proportional to the real <b>contact</b> <b>area,</b> however the proportionality constant that links friction to <b>contact</b> <b>area</b> evolves in time and therefore depends {{on the history of the}} contact. These results provide new insights into friction at rough interfaces and demonstrate the potential of fluorescent <b>contact</b> <b>area</b> imaging...|$|R
40|$|The <b>contact</b> <b>area,</b> {{as well as}} {{the contact}} pressure, is created when a {{respiratory}} protection device (a respirator or surgical mask) contacts a human face. A computer-based algorithm for determining the <b>contact</b> <b>area</b> between a headform and N 95 filtering facepiece respirator (FFR) was proposed. Six N 95 FFRs were applied to five sizes of standard headforms (large, medium, small, long/narrow, and short/wide) to simulate respirator donning. After the contact simulation between a headform and an N 95 FFR was conducted, a <b>contact</b> <b>area</b> was determined by extracting the intersection surfaces of the headform and the N 95 FFR. Using computer-aided design tools, a superimposed <b>contact</b> <b>area</b> and an average <b>contact</b> <b>area,</b> which are non-uniform rational basis spline (NURBS) surfaces, were developed for each headform. Experiments that directly measured dimensions of the <b>contact</b> <b>areas</b> between headform prototypes and N 95 FFRs were used to validate the simulation results.

The bleached CD 58 molecules accumulated in the <b>contact</b> <b>area</b> were rapidly replaced by fluorescent CD 58 that diffused into the <b>contact</b> <b>area</b> from adjacent bilayer regions outside the <b>contact</b> <b>area.</b> Rapid recovery of the accumulated fluorescence directly demonstrates that the CD 2 -CD 58 bonds are dissociating and that the dissociation leads to partner exchange, rather than rebinding of the same CD 2 -CD 58 pairs. This suggests that the solution off-rate provides an accurate description of CD 2 -CD 58 interaction in <b>contact</b> <b>areas.</b> Accumulated fluorescent IgG in contacts between K 562 cells expressing low affinity Fc receptors and planar bilayers with fluorescent IgG bound to hapten-derivitized phospholipids displayed slower recovery than CD 58 by a factor of 10.
