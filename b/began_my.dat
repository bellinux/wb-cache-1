5|$|I finally <b>began</b> <b>my</b> {{prescribed}} {{regime of}} hormones to continue my overdue gender transition in February. It's been such an amazing relief for {{my body and}} brain to finally come into alignment with each other. My stress and anxiety levels have tapered off quite considerably. Overall, things are beginning to move along nicely.|$|E
500|$|A {{few days}} earlier I'd just heard of the tragic death of my colleague... As I meditated on the {{fragility}} of our human frame, I was drawn once more {{to the life of}} the spirit. Rocamadour had the effect of restoring me to the faith of my childhood. This sanctuary, undoubtedly the oldest in France... had everything to captivate me... The same evening of this visit to Rocamadour, I <b>began</b> <b>my</b> Litanies à la Vierge noire for female voices and organ. In that work I tried to get across the atmosphere of [...] "peasant devotion" [...] that had struck me so forcibly in that lofty chapel.|$|E
2500|$|Presently {{the moon}} rose, dead ahead of me; and painted boldly across its face was {{the figure of}} an Indian. He wore this war-bonnet of the Sioux, at his {{shoulder}} was a rifle pointed at someone in the river-bottom 30 feet [...] below; in another second he would drop one of my friends. I raised my old muzzle-loader and fired. The figure collapsed, tumbled down the bank and landed with a splash in the water. 'What is it?' called McCarthy, as he hurried back. 'It's {{over there in the}} water.' 'Hi!' he cried. 'Little Billy's killed an Indian all by himself!' So <b>began</b> <b>my</b> career as an Indian fighter.|$|E

2500|$|That {{garden was}} the place where my {{appearance}} as a cyclist at the Vélodrome d’Hiver was thought up. Gleizes and Villon claimed that I wouldn’t be able to cycle 100 kilometres without putting a foot on the ground. I bet them that I could {{for the price of}} a lunch. It’s actually a pretty hard thing to do to keep going over 100 kilometres on country roads. Neither of my opponents had a car and they didn’t want to chase after me on one of those velocipedes. A journalist from our circle of friends suggested cycling in a velodrome which is actually just as tiring, especially for someone who is not used to it. But I agreed. A few days later, one morning at ten, I <b>began</b> <b>my</b> laps in the Vélodrome d’Hiver. An hour went by and then another. The spectators, Fernand Léger was among them, cheered me on with increasing enthusiasm until quite unexpectedly the sound of a gong brought me to a halt. I had won my meal by my honourable average speed. (Metzinger) ...|$|E
2500|$|Jan Wong {{declined}} {{the invitation of}} host Guy A. Lepage to explain herself at the popular Québécois talk show Tout le monde en parle. She has declared: [...] "I brought forward {{a point of view}} [...] and I maintain it." [...] She has claimed that, during the controversy, she was the target of sexist and racist attacks, citing a Le Devoir cartoon that caricatured Wong with thick glasses and buck teeth opening a fortune cookie that said [...] "Beware of Bill 101". The newspaper claimed that it was a reference to the Chinese restaurants of her well-known father, Bill Wong, not her ethnicity. Jan Wong wrote extensively about the whole experience in her book Out of the Blue, A Memoir of Workplace Depression, Recovery, Redemption and Yes, Happiness. In it, Jan Wong described in detail the backlash she received immediately after her article published, how the Globe and Mail management, in her view, abandoned her in front of the torrent of negative reactions from all sides, and how she spiraled down into depression. [...] She described when she found the ‘exact moment I <b>began</b> <b>my</b> descent into depression’ when she was shattered by racial attack. This book was self-published after Doubleday, the publisher of her previous books, pulled out mere days before print although Doubleday denied any legal interference from The Globe. [...] It was released on May 5, 2012.|$|E
2500|$|In April 2015, {{during a}} video conference {{to promote the}} {{documentary}} Terminal F about Edward Snowden, Bolivia's ambassador to Russia, María Luisa Ramos Urzagaste, accused Assange of putting the life of Bolivian president Evo Morales at risk by intentionally providing the United States with false rumours that Snowden was on the president's plane when it was forced to land in Vienna in July 2013. [...] "It is possible that in this wide-ranging game that you <b>began</b> <b>my</b> president did not play a crucial role, but what you did was not important to my president, but it was to me and the citizens of our country. And I have faith that when you planned this game you took into consideration the consequences", the ambassador told Assange. Assange stated that the plan [...] "was not completely honest, but we did consider that the final result would have justified our actions. We weren't expecting this outcome. The result {{was caused by the}} United States' intervention. We can only regret what happened." [...] Later, in an interview with Democracy Now!, Assange explained the story of the grounding of Morales' plane, saying that after the United States cancelled Snowden's passport, WikiLeaks thought about other strategies to take him to Latin America, and they considered private presidential jets of those countries which offered support. The appointed jet was that of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, but Assange stated that [...] "our code language that we used deliberately swapped the presidential jet that we were considering for the Bolivian jet [...] and in some of our communications, we deliberately spoke about that on open lines to lawyers in the United States. And we didn’t think much more of it. [...] We didn’t think this was anything more than just distracting." [...] Eventually, the plan was not pursued and, under Assange's advice, Snowden sought asylum in Russia.|$|E

But previously to that, my much-loved, much-abused, and long-suffering mother had taught me to read and write, so that my brain was not altogether unfurnished when I went to school.|$|E

If, however, 'had found' be regarded as a subjunctive, the meaning is, 'I <b>began</b> <b>my</b> flight, and determined to continue it until I had found (i.e. should have found) you.' Comp.
