50|$|The British philosopher Timothy Sprigge has {{suggested}} that in some respects <b>Bradley's</b> absolute idealism receives a better exposition in Essays on Truth and Reality than it had in <b>Bradley's</b> earlier work Appearance and Reality (1893). He notes that <b>Bradley's</b> coherence theory of truth is the classic statement of such a position, comparing <b>Bradley's</b> views to those of Willard Van Orman Quine.|$|R

5|$|In the 1908 presidential election, <b>Bradley</b> {{supported}} Charles W. Fairbanks for the Republican nomination, while Willson favored William Howard Taft. Disharmony marred {{the state}} nominating convention, and despite being a newly minted senator, <b>Bradley</b> was not chosen as a {{delegate to the}} Republican National Convention.

Max Branning (Jake Wood) says an emotional goodbye to his son and Jack agrees to help them escape. They leave via the back door as Max delays the police at the front, and hide a few streets away. Jack also leaves by the back door but Marsden sees him and he is unable to meet <b>Bradley</b> and Stacey, who are nervously waiting. <b>Bradley</b> says they should go without Jack, but when they go to get a taxi to St Pancras railway station, <b>Bradley</b> realises he has left the passports at home and goes back to get them, leaving Stacey to wait. However, Stacey grows impatient and phones him. The police notice him when his phone rings, and in a bid to escape them, he runs up a fire escape and crawls across the roof of The Queen Victoria with an officer following him. He shouts at Stacey to run, but stumbles and falls backwards from the roof to the ground, dying instantly. Max and Stacey are devastated, and he pulls her away from the body. She tells him it is her fault, as <b>Bradley</b> did not kill Archie, she did. The following day, Marsden says the police will no longer be pursuing the investigation. Stacey then goes missing, and on the day of Bradley's funeral, Jack receives news that a court has found <b>Bradley</b> guilty of Archie's murder.|$|E

5|$|On September 23, 2007, however, he tore {{his right}} ACL while being {{restrained}} by Padres manager Bud Black during an altercation with first base umpire Mike Winters. Home plate umpire Brian Runge reportedly told <b>Bradley</b> that Winters {{said that he}} had tossed his bat in Runge's direction in a previous at-bat. After <b>Bradley</b> reached first base, he questioned Winters about the alleged bat throwing and subsequent communication with Runge. According to <b>Bradley</b> and Padres first base coach Bobby Meacham, Winters addressed <b>Bradley</b> with a barrage of profanity. <b>Bradley</b> then moved towards Winters. While restrained by Black, <b>Bradley</b> fell to the ground and injured himself. He missed the final week of the regular season in 2007, during which the Padres lost to the Colorado Rockies in a one game playoff for the National League wild card on October 1.|$|E

5|$|Republican William S. Taylor {{was elected}} to succeed <b>Bradley</b> in the {{contentious}} 1899 gubernatorial election. When Democratic nominee William Goebel and his running mate J. C. W. Beckham challenged the election results, <b>Bradley</b> formed part of the legal team for the Republicans. The case was appealed to the Supreme Court, which found {{in favor of the}} Democrats. Despite {{being a member of the}} state's minority party, <b>Bradley</b> {{was elected to}} the U.S. Senate in 1907. Again, divisions within the Democratic Party played a role in his election. Bradley's opposition to Prohibition made him more palatable to some Democrats than their own candidate, outgoing Governor Beckham. Beckham refused to withdraw in favor of a compromise candidate, and after two months of balloting, four Democratic legislators crossed party lines and elected <b>Bradley.</b> <b>Bradley</b> had a largely undistinguished career in the Senate. On the day he announced he would not seek re-election to his Senate seat, he was involved in a streetcar accident. He died from his injuries on May 23, 1914.|$|E
