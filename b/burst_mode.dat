5|$|The PHEBUS {{experiment}} {{was designed by}} CESR (Toulouse) to record high energy transient events in the range 100keV to 100MeV. It consisted of two independent detectors and their associated electronics. Each detector consisted of a bismuth germanate (BGO) crystal 78mm in diameter by 120mm thick, surrounded by a plastic anti-coincidence jacket. The two detectors were arranged on the spacecraft so as to observe 4π steradians.

40|$|Encoding {{of muscle}} {{movement}} on two time scales by a sensory neuron that switches between spiking and <b>bursting</b> <b>modes.</b> J. Neurophysiol. 82 : 2786 – 2797, 1999. The gastropyloric receptor (GPR) neurons of the stomatogastric nervous {{system of the}} crab Cancer borealis are muscle stretch receptors that can fire in either a spiking or a <b>bursting</b> <b>mode</b> of operation. Our goal is to understand what features of muscle stretch are encoded by these two modes of activity. To this end, we characterized {{the responses of the}} GPR neurons in both states to sustained and rapidly varying imposed stretches. The firing rates of spiking GPR neurons in response to rapidly varying stretches were directly related to stretch amplitude. For persistent stretches, spikingmode firing rates showed marked adaptation indicating a more complex relationship. Interspike intervals of action potentials fired by GPR neurons in the spiking mode were used to construct an accurate estimate of the time-dependent amplitude of stretches in the frequency range of the gastric mill rhythm (0. 05 – 0. 2 Hz). Spike trains arising from faster stretches (similar to those of the pyloric rhythm) were decoded using a linear filter to construct an estimate of stretch amplitude. GPR neurons firing in the <b>bursting</b> <b>mode</b> were relatively unaffected by rapidly varying stretches. However, the burst rate was related to the amplitude of long, sustained stretches, and very slowly varying stretches could be reconstructed from burst intervals. In conclusion, the existence of spiking and <b>bursting</b> <b>modes</b> allows a single neuron to encode both rapidly and slowly varying stimuli and thus to report cycle-by-cycle muscle movements as well as average levels of muscle tension...|$|R

25|$|The main {{function}} of the ARAS is to modify and potentiate thalamic and cortical function such that electroencephalogram (EEG) desynchronization ensues. There are distinct differences in the brain’s electrical activity during periods of wakefulness and sleep: Low voltage fast burst brain waves (EEG desynchronization) are associated with wakefulness and REM sleep (which are electrophysiologically similar); high voltage slow waves are found during non-REM sleep. Generally speaking, when thalamic relay neurons are in <b>burst</b> <b>mode</b> the EEG is synchronized {{and when they are}} in tonic mode it is desynchronized. Stimulation of the ARAS produces EEG desynchronization by suppressing slow cortical waves (0.3–1Hz), delta waves (1–4Hz), and spindle wave oscillations (11–14Hz) and by promoting gamma band (20 – 40Hz) oscillations.|$|E

2500|$|An {{originally}} classified 1984 US interagency {{intelligence assessment}} states that {{in both the}} preceding 1970s and 80s, the Soviet and US military were already following the [...] "existing trends" [...] in warhead miniaturization, of higher accuracy and lower yield nuclear warheads, this is seen when assessing the most numerous physics packages in the US arsenal, which in the 1960s were the B28 and W31, however both quickly became less prominent with the 1970s mass production runs of the 50 Kt W68, the 100 Kt W76 and in the 1980s, with the B61. This trend towards miniaturization, enabled by advances in inertial guidance and accurate GPS navigation etc., was motivated by a multitude of factors, namely the desire to leverage the physics of equivalent megatonnage that miniaturization offered; of freeing up space to fit more MIRV warheads and decoys on each missile. Alongside the desire to still destroy hardened targets but while reducing the severity of fallout collateral damage depositing on neighboring, and potentially friendly, countries. As {{it relates to the}} likelihood of nuclear winter, the range of potential thermal radiation ignited fires was already reduced with miniaturization. For example, the most popular nuclear winter paper, the 1983 TTAPS paper, had described a 3000 Mt counterforce attack on ICBM sites with each individual warhead having approximately one Mt of energy; however not long after publication, Michael Altfeld of Michigan State University and political scientist Stephen Cimbala of Pennsylvania State University argued that the then already developed and deployed smaller, more accurate warheads (e.g. W76), together with lower detonation heights, could produce the same counterforce strike with a total of only 3 Mt of energy being expended. They continue that, [...] if the nuclear winter models prove to be representative of reality, then far less climatic-cooling would occur, even if firestorm prone areas existed in the target list, as lower fusing heights such as surface bursts, would also limit the range of the burning thermal rays due to terrain masking and shadows cast by buildings, while also temporarily lofting far more localized fallout when compared to airburst fuzing – the standard mode of employment against un-hardened targets. This logic is similarly reflected in the originally classified 1984 Interagency Intelligence assessment, which suggests that targeting planners would simply have to consider target combustibility along with yield, height of burst, timing and other factors {{to reduce the amount of}} smoke to safeguard against the potentiality of a nuclear winter. Therefore, as a consequence of attempting to limit the target fire hazard by reducing the range of thermal radiation with fuzing for surface and sub-surface bursts, this will result in a scenario where the far more concentrated, and therefore deadlier, local fallout that is generated following a surface burst forms, as opposed to the comparatively dilute global fallout created when nuclear weapons are fuzed in air <b>burst</b> <b>mode.</b>|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{test program}} was {{conducted}} to investigate the failure modes of undamaged and damaged graphite-epoxy cylindrical tubes subjected to internal pressure. Some tubes were intentionally damaged by either a longitudinal-line cut or a single-point impact. Both types of damage were intended to simulate fiber breakage caused by a local damage. The objectives of the program were to investigate the failure modes of graphite-epoxy cylindrical tubes subjected to internal pressure, with and without local damage, and to qualitatively determine the relative burst pressure degradation associated with preexisting local damage to the tubes. A high-speed motion analyzer was used to record images of the fractures. The images provide the failure mode information that was not available in existing literature. Testing was conducted under three conditions: hydraulic pressurization, pneumatic pressurization with solid inserts, and pneumatic pressurization with inert propellant inserts. A tube with a longitudinal cut can fail by three different modes: a local leakage <b>mode,</b> a <b>bursting</b> <b>mode</b> with fracture initiating from the cut, or a <b>bursting</b> <b>mode</b> with complete tube disintegration.
