[...] Jen Aprahamian of Comic Vine said [...] "Ms. Marvel makes a delightful debut, showing confidence and heart {{even before she}} puts on a mask. Kamala is not your average superheroine and her stories seem like they're headed in an exciting direction. Kudos to Marvel for expanding its range; amping up the diversity factor {{in a way that}} doesn't feel token or temporary is a great move, and Ms. Marvel is launching with a solid first issue and a world—a universe, even—of story possibilities." [...] Joshua Yehl of IGN said, [...] "Ms. Marvel introduces a vibrant and troubled character that you can't help but love." [...] George Marston of Newsarama said, [...] "Ms. Marvel is a solid debut issue, and that in itself should be a victory not just for G. Willow Wilson and Adrian Alphona, but for Marvel Comics itself... It's not exactly edgy, and Kamala Khan is not exactly the first reluctant teen hero in Marvel's long history, <b>but</b> <b>Ms.</b> Marvel is one of the strongest debuts for a new character that Marvel has had in a long time." ...|$|E

500|$|... "We Belong Together" [...] {{became a}} [...] "career re-defining" [...] song for Carey, {{at a point}} when many critics had {{considered}} her career over. Unlike most of Carey's recent singles at that time, [...] "We Belong Together" [...] received generally positive reviews from critics, most of whom hailed the song as her [...] "return to form", following reviews for Charmbracelet (2002), that suggested Carey had lost her signature vocal range and power. Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine wrote [...] "the... diva [...] cool with breathy, rapid-fire verses until the final full strong-voiced climax that... proves that 'The Voice' has indeed returned." [...] Additionally, he said that [...] "The song is as 'innovative' as Mariah has been in years." [...] Other critics commended Carey on her novel singing style which, according to Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times, gave the song its propulsion, writing [...] "This style {{is part of the}} reason why she has been able to turn a ballad into a summer smash. 'We Belong Together' doesn't have a guest rapper, or a hard-hitting beat, <b>but</b> <b>Ms.</b> Carey's tricky vocal lines give the song more propulsion than you'd expect, with tightly coiled counter-rhythms that tug against the beat." [...] Johnny Loftus from Metro Times called it a [...] "summer hit" [...] and wrote [...] "We all know it’s the intangibles that make a summer single anyway, those untraceable currents that grab the heart and feet, and despite not being an anthem, 'We Belong Together' is that rousing." ...|$|E
500|$|Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger {{said the}} series {{needs to find}} a way to {{distinguish}} Leslie from Steve Carell's Michael Scott from The Office, but he said the pilot episode was funny, particularly the Aziz Ansari character. Sepinwall also said The Office did not find its footing until the second season, so comparisons simply based on the pilot were not fair. (Ironically, most critics now agree that Parks and Recreation set a significantly higher standard after the second season.) Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times said the supporting cast needed stronger writing and reinforcements, but that Poehler was excellent in a lead role unique for women because it is based on weakness and wrongheadedness, but still a positive and strong part. Stanley said, [...] "The pilot episode isn’t perfect, <b>but</b> <b>Ms.</b> Poehler very nearly is." [...] Verne Gay of Newsday said Poehler has [...] "plenty of appeal here" [...] so he felt the show might have potential, but felt the pilot was for the most part a [...] "near knockoff" [...] of The Office. Likewise, Paige Wiser of the Chicago Sun-Times said [...] "so far it's a pale Xerox of the paper company", although she said [...] "there are lots of funny little moments that could add up to a great series." [...] Robert Bianco said the episode was not funny, and the way in which the scripts and supporting cast ridicule and ignore the Leslie character leaves a [...] "sour whiff of gratuitous cruelty." [...] He also called the pilot unoriginal and described it as [...] "a style in search of a show," [...] despite Poehler's likability. Similarly, Rob Owen of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette said, [...] "Watching Poehler's pathetic character have her dreams stomped on by apathetic bureaucrats is off-putting, more so than Michael Scott's obliviousness," [...] although Owen said the Ansari character was amusing.|$|E
