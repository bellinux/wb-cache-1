25|$|Townsville is characterised as a {{tropical}} savanna climate (Köppen climate classification Aw). Owing to a quirk of geographical location, Townsville's winter rainfall {{in particular is}} {{not as high as}} elsewhere in the eastern coastal tropics of Queensland, such as Cairns. The winter months are dominated by southeast trade winds and mostly fine weather. Further north the coastline runs north/south and the trade winds are lifted to produce rainfall right through the year. Townsville, however, lies on a section of coastline that turns east/west, so the lifting effect is not present. As a result, winter months are dominated by <b>blue</b> <b>skies,</b> warm days and cool nights, although at times significant rainfall may occur.|$|E

[...] The network's biggest concern in picking up the series was that Battlestar Galactica would fall victim to the same trappings of space opera as other television properties (Star Trek, Andromeda, Stargate). [...] Two aspects that assuaged these concerns were specifically discussed in the episode's DVD commentary. [...] First, [...] "33" [...] went into Gaius Baltar's (James Callis) mind and visited his house on Caprica (shot in Lions Bay, British Columbia); being swept away by the <b>blue</b> <b>skies</b> and beaches in his fantasy was not the sort of imagery expected of space opera-type shows.
