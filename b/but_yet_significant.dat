40|$|Between 27 % and 43 % of {{the elderly}} express {{different}} forms of worry about victimization (WAV) (or fear of crime) in Canada (Beaulieu and al., 2003). According to Ferraro (1995), beside age, gender is an important predictor of fear of crime; women reporting {{the highest levels of}} perceived risk, constrained behaviours and fear. This study aims (1) to develop a WAV model from seventeen interviews with elderly women, and (2) to establish parallels between this qualitative model and the WAV quantitative model proposed by L'Espérance and al.

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} {{an experimental}} method to separately test the optical response {{of a single}} sub-wavelength nano-structure to tailored electric and magnetic field distributions in the optical domain. For this purpose a highly focused y-polarized TEM 10 -mode is used which exhibits spatially separated longitudinal magnetic and transverse electric field patterns. By displacing a single sub-wavelength nano-structure, namely a single split-ring resonator (SRR), in the focal plane, different coupling scenarios can be achieved. It is shown experimentally that the single split-ring resonator tested here responds dominantly as an electric dipole. A much smaller <b>but</b> <b>yet</b> statistically <b>significant</b> magnetic dipole contribution is also measured by investigating the interaction of a single SRR with a magnetic field component perpendicular to the SRR plane (which {{is equivalent to the}} curl of the electric field) as well as by analyzing the intensity and polarization distribution of the scattered light with high spatial resolution. The developed experimental setup as well as the measurement techniques presented in this paper are a versatile tool to investigate the optical properties of single sub-wavelength nano-structures.

40|$|During {{the last}} three decades, the use of modern organic {{synthetic}} pesticides has increased about 40 -fold. Total U. S. production, for domestic and expert use, in 1976 was about 1. 4 million pounds. Crops receiving the most intensive application of various pesticides were cotton for insecticides, corn for herbicides, and fruits and vegetables for fungicides. Examination of use trends of pesticides indicates that the volume in pounds of herbicides used on crops is increasing, whereas the quantities of insecticides and fungicides remain stable. New chemical classes of compounds such as the synthetic pyrethroid insecticides are being introduced, <b>but</b> are not <b>yet</b> <b>significant</b> {{in terms of their}} share of the market. The increased usage of pesticides, together with knowledge of some of their adverse effects, has alerted the public to the need for regulation.

40|$|In this study, we {{examined}} {{a number of}} short and long-term sensorimotor, behavioural and cognitive consequences of an experimental ischemia induced by a 60 -min right middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in 129 S 2 mice. During 14 days after surgery, a classical sensorimotor assessment was conducted using hanging wire test, negative geotaxis test, grip strength test, accelerated rotarod test and locomotor activity-meter. In order to provide a technique {{for the assessment of}} more resistant consequences of ischemia on fine psychomotor control, the peak procedure (a modified version of the operant fixed-interval schedule of reinforcement) was used. This procedure also helped to objectify temporal perception in mice five weeks following surgery. On several sensorimotor tests, ischemic mice showed some degree of impairment which rapidly tended to improve after stroke, a profile of results substantially consistent with previous studies. Five weeks post-surgery, ischemic mice tested with the peak procedure exhibited a moderate <b>but</b> <b>yet</b> <b>significant</b> temporal regulation impairment along with a reduced response rate compared to control mice. The present results suggest that the peak procedure and other derived operant schedules of reinforcement may provide useful and sensitive tools for the long-term assessment of both behavioural and cognitive aspects of the consequences of an experimental ischemia.

40|$|The melanin-concentrating hormone MCH(1) {{receptor}} {{has been}} proposed to exert an inhibitory control on monoaminergic (especially dopaminergic) activity within the mesolimbic system, which underpins drug seeking and reward. That hypothesis predicts that an inactivation of these receptors should enhance the sensitivity to drug rewarding effects. To test that prediction, we examined the propensity of mice lacking the melanin-concentrating receptor (MCH(1) KO) and their intact counterparts (WT) to form cocaine- and amphetamine-induced conditioned place preference. The conditioned rewarding effects induced by 0. 375, 0. 75, 1. 5 and 3 mg/kg amphetamine were assessed in two sub-experiments and those induced by 1, 2, 4 and 8 mg/kg cocaine in two other sub-experiments. All mice were tested under saline for place preference 24 h following four every-other-day conditioning trials and an initial pre-conditioning session under saline. Most of the cocaine and amphetamine doses induced place preference, but without any genotype difference being revealed. Also, none of the cocaine doses induced psychomotor sensitization during conditioning, whereas amphetamine generated clear-cut dose-dependent sensitization in both genotypes. Albeit MCH(1) KO mice exhibited higher levels of psychomotor activation, the rates of sensitization were comparable across genotypes at 1. 5 and 3 mg/kg amphetamine. Moreover, 0. 375 and especially 0. 75 mg/kg amphetamine produced a slight <b>but</b> <b>yet</b> <b>significant</b> sensitization in MCH(1) KO but not in their WT counterparts. Despite such an effect, the results cannot be considered as unambiguously supportive of the tested prediction. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|William LathamThis is an {{independent}} research study highlighting scale benefits of soft costs and modularity as strategies for increasing cost-competitiveness in the solar PV industry. On the economies of scale front, {{an analysis of the}} implied soft costs over time presents a general trend of a decline in unit costs per watt due to decreasing module costs rather than soft cost declines, suggesting that modularity may be an effective strategy to drive down costs in solar PV project development. To that end, this analysis sought to index the level of modularity present in different US industries to see if the theory held true across the US economy and could be sustained and applied to the solar PV industry. Using a binary probit regression model: this research yielded an index of the level of modularity present in each US industry, as delineated by the NAICS codes, that was based on the following variables: intermediate transport levels, inter-industry interactions, energy intensity of industries, Cost of Goods Sold (as a percentage of All Returns), and level of technology. Energy intensity was found to be insignificant on the regression. The study revealed substantial skewedness in the distribution of index values, with a high concentration of points centered around {{the low end of the}} index, followed by a definitely sparsely populated central band, followed by a smaller <b>but</b> <b>yet</b> <b>significant</b> concentration of industries that were highly modular. Many of the modular industries are centered on capital production in a few select sectors. Unfortunately, the North American Industry Classification System data presently available does not capture the renewable energy industry with enough specific detail to be able to draw specific conclusions about the presence of economies of modularity in utility-scale solar PV as originally desired. However, these results represent a powerful framework that can be replicated to draw solar PV industry-specific conclusions when more detailed energy sector input-output data tables become available in the next 12 to 18 months.

Protein 2 yielded 4 cyanogen bromide peptides, none of which was identical to those of protein 1, and the sum of these peptides was also equivalent to the apparent molecular weight of the uncleaved protein.

40|$|The {{vertical}} zonation of light, O 2, H 2 S, pH, and sulfur bacteria was {{studied in}} two benthic cyanobacterial mats from hypersaline ponds at Guerrero Negro, Baja California, Mexico.

In mats, where oxygen produced by photosynthesis diffused far below {{the depth of the}} photic zone, colorless sulfur bacteria (Beggiatoa sp.) were the dominant sulfide oxidizing organisms. In a mat, where the O 2 -H 2 S interface was close to the photic zone, <b>but</b> <b>yet</b> received no <b>significant</b> visible light, purple sulfur bacteria (Chromatium sp.) were the dominant sulfide oxidizers. Analysis of the spectral light distribution here showed that the penetration of only 1 % of the incident near-IR light (800 - 900 nm) into the sulfide zone was sufficient for the mass development of Chromatium in a narrow band of 300 micromoles thickness. The balance between O 2 and light penetration down into the sulfide zone thus determined in micro-scale which type of sulfur bacteria became dominant...|$|R
40|$|We have {{identified}} Syntaxin 3 (Stx 3) as the Q-SNARE {{involved in the}} fusion of Aquaporin 2 (AQP 2) storage vesicles to the apical membrane in MCD 4, a mouse renal collecting duct cell line in response to forskolin. Here we describe the functional involvement of Munc 18 b, a mem- ber of the Sec/Munc family of proteins, as a negative regulator of the SNARE complex formation catalyzing AQP 2 fusion to the apical membrane. It {{has been reported that}} Munc 18 proteins can sta- bilize syntaxins in their closed conformation thus preventing their interaction with other SNARE motifs and hence the formation of the SNARE complex mediating vesicles to membrane fusion. In MCD 4 cells, by RT-PCR, western blotting and immunofluorescence approaches, two isoforms of Munc 18 were found expressed: Munc 18 b, the epithelial cells specific isoform and Munc 18 c the ubiquitously expressed isoform. As confirmed by confocal xz scanning, both isoforms were mainly associated to the apical plasma membrane where they possibly interact with Stx 3. The role of Munc 18 in AQP 2 exocytosis was investigated in cells in which the expression of both Munc 18 isoforms was knocked-down by specific SiRNAs. In control MCD 4 cells, surface biotinylation technique indicated a 3 to 4 -fold increase of apical AQP 2 after treatment with forskolin compared to untreated cells. Interestingly, in cells silenced for Munc 18 b expression, the amount of AQP 2 at the apical membrane was 7 -fold higher than in untreated cells even in basal condition and FK pro- moted a small <b>but</b> <b>yet</b> <b>significant</b> increase of AQP 2. When Munc 18 c isoform was knocked-down, the effect on AQP 2 exocytosis was less dramatic. This is in line with observation that Munc 18 b isoform binds preferentially to Stx 3. These data, taken together, suggest that Munc 18 b association to Stx 3 prevents AQP 2 vesicle fusion to the apical membrane in unstimulated cells. Removal of this negative regulator by SiRNA induced spontaneous fusion of AQP 2 vesicles to the apical mem- brane in the absence of FK stimulation. This indicates that Munc 18 b displacement from Stx 3 may be part of the vasopressin regulated signal cascade leading to AQP 2 exocytosis in collecting duct renal cells...|$|E
40|$|Background: Some {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} the role of calcium in reducing body mass index (BMI) or fat mass. Though, BMI does not provide very valid information about changes in body fat mass, Fat Mass Index (FMI) relates body fat mass to height and allows comparing body fat mass of individuals at different heights. This study investigated the possible association between dietary calcium intake (CI) and other nutritional factors and weight status of girls aged 8 - 10 years. Materials and Methods: In this case-control study, 110 girls aged 8 - 10 with FMI at or above 7. 2 kg/m 2 as cases and 307 girls with FMI less than 7. 2 kg/m 2 as controls were recruited through multistage cluster random sampling. FMI at or above 7. 2 kg/m 2 was considered as the cutoff point for obesity. Body fat mass was assessed by a stand on bio impedance analyzer. In order to assess CI, {{participants were asked to}} complete a validated food frequency questionnaire. Results: Mean and standard deviation of CI in the case group was significantly lower than the control group 649 ± 103 and 951 ± 152 mg/d, respectively (P < 0. 01). After Adjustment for total energy intake, the percentage of energy from fat, carbohydrate and protein in quartiles of physical activity, inverse association between CI and obesity was significant and in the highest quartile of physical activity the association was weaker. By further adjustment for the effect of fruits and vegetable intake inverse association between CI and obesity became weaker <b>but</b> <b>yet</b> was <b>significant.</b> Conclusion: The inverse relationship between CI and FMI remained significant even after controlling for confounding factors. FMI may be more accurate, compared to BMI, in showing the association between CI and obesity...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the nature of the accelerating expansion of the late-time universe, it is important to experimentally determine whether dark energy is cosmological constant or dynamical in nature. If dark energy already exists prior to inflation, which is a reasonable assumption, then one expects that a dynamical dark energy would leave some footprint in the anisotropy of the late-time accelerated expansion. We invoke the quintessence field, one of the simplest dynamical dark energy models, to investigate the effects of its quantum fluctuations (fully correlated with curvature perturbations) during inflation and estimate the anisotropy of the cosmic expansion so induced. For that we calculate the perturbed luminosity distance and its power spectrum, which is an estimator of anisotropicity of late-time accelerated expansion. We find that the gravitational potential at large scales and late times is less decayed in QCDM compared to that in Λ CDM so that the smaller the redshift and multipole, the more deficit of power in QCDM. These features may help to distinguish the cosmological constant from a dynamical dark energy. In this regard, the apparent (<b>but</b> not <b>yet</b> statistically <b>significant)</b> power deficit in CMB low multipoles based on Λ CDM may even be a smoking gun for QCDM.
