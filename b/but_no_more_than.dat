5|$|Early {{observations}} {{have revealed}} a few genuinely hyperbolic (i.e. non-periodic) trajectories, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> could {{be accounted for}} by perturbations from Jupiter. If comets pervaded interstellar space, they would be moving with velocities of the same order as the relative velocities of stars near the Sun (a few tens of km per second). If such objects entered the Solar System, they would have positive specific orbital energy and would be observed to have genuinely hyperbolic trajectories. A rough calculation shows that there might be four hyperbolic comets per century within Jupiter's orbit, give or take one and perhaps two orders of magnitude.|$|E
5|$|Göring {{ordered that}} no more {{transport}} flights be made. Albert Kesselring complained that this would deny the Axis forces vital supplies, and Göring once again permitted flights. This time they were to travel via Sardinia, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 60–70 flights would be allowed per night; some 250 had been mounted daily before Flax. The transports also had to run the gauntlet of radar-equipped Bristol Beaufighters but these rarely were successful at intercepting them.|$|E
5|$|After Kiev, the Red Army {{no longer}} outnumbered the Germans {{and there were}} no more trained {{reserves}} directly available. To defend Moscow, Stalin could field 800,000 men in 83 divisions, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 25 divisions were fully effective. Operation Typhoon, the drive to Moscow, began on 30 September 1941. In front of Army Group Center was a series of elaborate defense lines, the first centered on Vyazma and the second on Mozhaysk. Russian peasants began fleeing ahead of the advancing German units, burning their harvested crops, driving their cattle away, and destroying buildings in their villages as part of a scorched-earth policy designed to deny the Nazi war machine of needed supplies and foodstuffs.|$|E

25|$|As {{an agency}} of the Commonwealth, the Virginia Port Authority reports to the Virginia Secretary of Transportation. The Governor of Virginia {{appoints}} 11 citizens to form the Virginia Port Authority Board of Commissioners, and the state treasurer is an ex officio member of the Board. Commissioners serve staggered five year terms {{at the pleasure of}} the Governor, and no commissioner may serve more than two consecutive terms. Law dictates that there must be one, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> one, commissioner from Norfolk or Virginia Beach; one, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> one, commissioner from Portsmouth or Chesapeake; and one, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> one, commissioner from Hampton or Newport News. Traditionally, an active or retired senior executive from Norfolk Southern Railway and an individual with ties to the coal industry have also served as members of the Board. The Board elects a chairman and vice chairman from within its membership.|$|E
