This is often resolved with <b>built-up</b> <b>floor</b> systems involving clever sound-isolation and absorption techniques, {{and at the same}} time providing passage space for plumbing, wiring, and even heating and cooling equipment.|$|E

It consists mainly of office space (floors 5-43, except 24) but features a revolving restaurant at the 48th and 49th floor and a helipad atop the building. The first five floors are retail spaces.|$|E

40|$|Numerical methods {{based on}} wave {{modelling}} are explored for the vibroacoustic analysis of wave propagation, sound transmission and interior noise in vehicles and buildings at medium and high frequencies. The presence of sound absorbing porous materials in practical engineering structures is also considered. The wave modelling techniques provide computational efficiency and physical insight, and two such methods having these advantages are developed {{in this thesis}} namely: the semi-analytical finite {{element method and the}} wave expansion method. The semi-analytical finite element method is applicable to structures which have constant properties in one direction, and it uses a finite element discretization of the cross-section and analytical functions in the third direction. Equations of motion are derived from this method to study wave propagation characteristics, which help understand the vibroacoustic behavior of structures. These characteristics may also be used by high frequency techniques, such as statistical energy analysis. The wave propagation in sandwich panels with a poroelastic core, which is modeled with Biot's theory, is investigated thoroughly. The semi-analytical finite element method retains the flexibility of the finite element method on geometry and also dramatically increases the computational speed thanks to the orthogonality of the analytical functions when used to calculate forced response. The calculated response of partitions is integrated into diffuse field sound transmission loss calculations of, for example, <b>built-up</b> train <b>floor</b> partitions and multilayer panels lined with porous materials. The calculations are computationally efficient and show good agreement with measurements, thus it is interesting for industrial optimizations. The wave expansion method uses a priori defined plane wave solutions to the Helmholtz equation for approximation of the sound field in geometrically complex enclosures. It reduces the requirements regarding the number of degrees of freedom compared to the finite element method, which, furthermore, is polluted by dispersion errors. Therefore, the wave expansion method is particularly appealing for high frequency (or large wavenumber) calculations. Its application in interior sound field predictions is assessed within the automobile context. QC 20140916 </p...|$|R

5000|$|Deep litter is {{an animal}} housing system, {{based on the}} {{repeated}} spreading of straw or sawdust material in indoor booths. An initial layer of litter is spread for the animals to use for bedding material and to defecate in, and as the litter is soiled, new layers of litter are continuously added by the farmer. In this fashion, a deep litter bedding can build up to depths of 1-2 meters. [...] "The usual procedure for <b>built-up</b> <b>floor</b> litter is to start with about 4 inches of fine litter material with additions of 1 to 2 inches later as needed without removal of the old. A depth of 6 to 12 inches is maintained by partial removals from time to time." [...] (Plamondon) Many consider {{this to be a}} natural means to disposing of animal feces. “The deep litter cultivation is a modern ecological breeding technique based on decomposing feces by microbiological methods, a post processing method for poultry Manure.” (Li, 1410) ...|$|E

"The first {{experimental}} evidence {{with reference to}} the user of built-up litter as a sanitary procedure was secured by the Ohio Station in 1946 when it was first used in the brooder house. During the three years previous when the floor litter was removed and renewed at frequent intervals, the average mortality of 10 broods, or a total of 18,000 chicks, was 19 percent. During the succeeding three years with the use of built-up litter, the average mortality of 11 broods, or a total of 10,000 chicks, was 7 percent. Seldom did a brood escape an attack of coccidiosis before the use of built-up litter. Afterward there was no noticeable trouble from coccidiosis in 11 consecutive broods started and raised on the same old <b>built-up</b> <b>floor</b> litter. Old built-up litter is floor litter which has been used by two or more previous broods of chicks." [...] (Plamondon) To build immunity against coccidia, chicks are normally vaccinated. Experiments have shown that deep litter is an effective method of exposing chicks to the bacteria at a safe rate. Chicken feces produces ammonia which is known for killing coccidia. “a 10 percent solution of ammonia spray is considered effective for killing coccidia. Being unable to withstand such a spray, they may likewise be unable to withstand the constant ammoniacal atmosphere in built-up litter.” (Plamondon) ...|$|E
40|$|Graphite-epoxy floor {{sections}} {{representative of}} aircraft fuselage construction were statically and dynamically tested {{to evaluate their}} response to crash loadings. These floor sections were fabricated using a frame-stringer design typical of present aluminum aircraft without features to enhance crashworthiness. The floor sections were tested {{as part of a}} systematic research program developed to study the impact response of composite components of increasing complexity. The ultimate goal of the research program is to develop crashworthy design features for future composite aircraft. Initially, individual frames of six-foot diameter were tested both statically and dynamically. The frames were then used to construct <b>built-up</b> <b>floor</b> sections for dynamic tests at impact velocities of approximately 20 feet/sec to simulate survivable crash velocities. In addition, static tests were conducted {{to gain a better understanding}} of the failure mechanisms seen in the dynamic tests...|$|E
