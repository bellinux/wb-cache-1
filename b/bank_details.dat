The worm steals users' <b>banking</b> <b>details,</b> usernames and passwords by propagating through Orkut. The attack was triggered as users launched an executable file {{disguised as a}} JPEG file. The initial executable file that causes the infection installs two additional files on the user's computer. These files then e-mail <b>banking</b> <b>details</b> and passwords to the worm's anonymous creator when infected users click on the [...] "My Computer" [...] icon. The infection spreads automatically by posting a URL in another user's Orkut Scrapbook, a guestbook where visitors can leave comments visible on the user's page. This link lures visitors with a message in Portuguese, falsely claiming to offer additional photos. The message text that carries an infection link can vary from case to case. In addition to stealing personal information, the malware can also enable a remote user to control the PC and make it part of a botnet, a network of infected PCs.|$|R
