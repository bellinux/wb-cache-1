5|$|Water is {{essential}} to a thermal power station, heated to create steam to turn the steam turbines. Water used in the boilers is taken from two licensed boreholes on site. Once this water has <b>been</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> turbines it is cooled by condensers using water taken from the nearby River Ouse. Water is pumped from the river by a pumphouse on the river, north of the station. Once it has <b>been</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> condenser, the water is cooled {{by one of the}} natural draft cooling towers, with two towers serving each generating set. Once cooled, the water is discharged back into the river.|$|E

ILM supervisor Dennis Muren considered using stop motion animation for the scene.

5|$|Major {{reconstruction}} of King's began in 1966 following {{the publication of}} the Robbins Report on Higher Education. A new block facing the Strand designed by E. D. Jefferiss Mathews was opened in 1972. In 1980 King's regained its legal independence under a new Royal Charter. In 1993 King's, along with other large University of London colleges, gained direct access to government funding (which had previously <b>been</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> university) and the right to confer University of London degrees itself. This contributed to King's and the other large colleges being regarded as de facto universities in their own right.|$|E

Governor General Adrienne Clarkson won wide praise for boosting Canadians' pride in the armed forces, spending Christmasses and New Years with forces personnel in Afghanistan and the Persian Gulf and earning herself a special tribute from the Canadian Forces upon her retirement from the Queen's service in 2005. Members of the Royal Family continued their duties as honoraries, visiting troops in Canada and Afghanistan, as well as attending memorials.|$|E

25|$|There {{has long}} been an {{ambition}} to physically link the Darwin and Pride Hill shopping centres. The most pursued opportunity has <b>been</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> development of vacant land between the sites to precede a larger-scale regeneration of the Riverside site. The 'Gap site' was a retail and leisure link development proposed by Morris Property, owners of the land, and was granted full planning permission in 2006 prior to the centres being sold to new owners. The onset of economic crisis ensured the scheme was put on hold. Dunedin, promoters of the scheme in 2005, put four branding proposals to the public vote in a high-profile marketing push for the renaming of the present centres following the new development's completion. The reconfigured centre would have been branded 'Castle Gate'.|$|E
25|$|Zaman's {{downfall}} {{was triggered}} by his attempts to consolidate power. Although it had <b>been</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> support of the Barakzai chief, Painda Khan Barakzai, {{that he had come}} to the throne, Zaman soon began to remove prominent Barakzai leaders from positions of power and replace them with men of his own lineage, the Sadozai. This upset the delicate balance of Durrani tribal politics that Ahmad Shah had established and may have prompted Painda Khan and other Durrani chiefs to plot against the shah. Painda Khan and the chiefs of the Nurzai and the Alizai Durrani clans were executed, as was the chief of the Qizilbash clan. Painda Khan's son fled to Iran and pledged the substantial support of his Barakzai followers to a rival claimant to the throne, Zaman's older brother, Mahmud Shah. The clans of the chiefs Zaman had executed joined forces with the rebels, and they took Kandahar without bloodshed.|$|E
25|$|Howard Robinson is {{a philosopher}} who has {{concentrated}} his research within {{the philosophy of}} mind. Taking what has <b>been</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> {{latter part of the}} last century an unfashionable stance, he has consistently argued against those explanations of sensory experience that would reduce them to physical origins. He has never regarded the theory of sense-data as refuted, but has set out to refute in turn the objections which so many have considered to be conclusive. The version of the theory of sense-data he defends takes what is before consciousness in perception to be qualia as mental presentations that are causally linked to external entities, but which are not physical in themselves. Unlike the philosophers so far mentioned, he is therefore a dualist, one who takes both matter and mind to have real and metaphysically distinct natures. His books (particularly Matter and Sense and Perception) are characterized by the thoroughness with which he deals with the arguments of opposing philosophers, thus setting a professional example that it would be well for his opponents to follow (for there has been a tendency to take for granted that the theory of sense-data is wholly obsolescent). In one of his most recent articles he takes the physicalist to task for ignoring the fact that sensory experience can be entirely free of representational character. He cites phosphenes as a stubborn example (phosphenes are flashes of neural light that result either from sudden pressure in the brain—as induced, for example, by intense coughing, or through direct physical pressure on the retina), and points out that it is grossly counter-intuitive to argue that these are not visual experiences on a par with open-eye seeing.|$|E

500|$|Nevelson {{continued}} to utilize wood in her sculptures, but also experimented with other {{materials such as}} aluminum, plastic and metal. [...] Black Zag X from 1969, {{in the collection of}} the Honolulu Museum of Art is an example of the artist's all-black assemblages incorporating the plastic, Formica. [...] In the fall of 1969, she was commissioned by Princeton University to create her first outdoor sculpture. After completion of her first outdoor sculptures, Nevelson stated: [...] "Remember, I was in my early seventies when I came into monumental outdoor sculpture... I had <b>been</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> enclosures of wood. I had <b>been</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> shadows. I had <b>been</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> enclosures and come out into the open." [...] Nevelson also praised new materials like plexiglas and cor-ten steel, which she described as a [...] "blessing". She embraced the idea of her works being able to withstand climate change and the freedom in moving beyond limitations in size. These public artworks were created by the Lippincott Foundry. Nevelson's public art commissions were a monetary success, but art historian Brooke Kamin Rapaport states that these pieces were not Nevelson's strongest works, and that Nevelson's [...] "intuitive gesture" [...] is not evident in the large steel works.|$|E

500|$|Levels of LH/FSH may be {{suppressed}} by a raised prolactin level, {{and are therefore}} not interpretable unless prolactin is low or normal. In men, the combination of low LH and FSH in combination with a low testosterone confirms LH/FSH deficiency; a high testosterone would indicate a [...] source elsewhere in the body (such as a testosterone-secreting tumor). In women, the diagnosis of LH/FSH deficiency depends on whether the woman has <b>been</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> menopause. Before the menopause, abnormal menstrual periods together with low estradiol and LH/FSH levels confirm a pituitary problem; after the menopause (when LH/FSH levels are normally elevated and the ovaries produce less estradiol), inappropriately low LH/FSH alone is sufficient. Stimulation tests with GnRH are possible, but their use is not encouraged.|$|E
