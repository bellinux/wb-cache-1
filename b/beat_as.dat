5|$|Cissé {{made his}} return to {{training}} on 20 October 2006, and scored his first goal for Olympique de Marseille on 22 December 2006 when they <b>beat</b> <b>AS</b> Saint-Étienne 2–1. With only four goals in 14 appearances by April, Cissé's performances were drawing such criticism that former player Jean-Pierre Papin urged Cissé's critics to be more patient while the striker recovered from his career-threatening injury. Despite the slow start, Cissé managed to score 4 goals in his final 7 league appearances to finish with 8 goals in 21 league appearances, helping Marseille to finish 2nd in the 2006–07 season and guarantee a Champions League place for the 2007–08 season. On 12 May 2007, he scored 2 goals in the French Cup Final against Sochaux, although Marseille still lost the match 5–4 on penalties, after a 2–2 stalemate after extra time following a late equaliser by another Liverpool player on loan Anthony Le Tallec.|$|E

500|$|... "Blank Page" [...] is {{a simplistic}} piano {{arranged}} ballad, which lasts for a duration of [...] (four minutes and four seconds). Her vocal range spans from F3 to G5. Lyrically, {{the song is}} about how Aguilera wishes to [...] "wipe the slate clean" [...] with a former lover and [...] "reconcile an old romance". She knows that she has wronged him, but is asking {{to be given a}} second chance. Andrew Hampp for Billboard noted that this sentiment is revealed by Aguilera in the lyrics [...] "If I could do undo that I hurt you/ I would do anything for us to make it through". The song begins with the chords of a piano as Aguilera sings [...] "I know there's hurt/ I know there's pain/ But people change/ Lord, knows I've been no saint/ In my own way/ Regret choices I've made/ How I do I say I'm sorry?/ How do I say I'm sorry?." [...] On the chorus, the lyrics are hopeful that she can right any wrongs she may have committed: [...] "Draw me a smile, and save me tonight/ I'll be your blank page waiting for you to bring me to life/ Paint me a heart, let me be your art/ I am a blank page waiting for life to start/ Let our hearts start and <b>beat</b> <b>as</b> one together/ Let our hearts start and <b>beat</b> <b>as</b> one forever".

500|$|Much {{like her}} {{previous}} albums, {{the record is}} feminist, with greater exploration of gender issues and conflated with [...] "an unwavering look at black female sexual agency." [...] Soraya McDonald of The Washington Post viewed Beyoncé as significant to black feminism as it celebrates black female sexuality in mainstream music and {{in the context of}} hip hop, where it is typically only shown through the male perspective. The album's most explicit commentary on gender is the three-part [...] "Flawless". It opens with the earlier released [...] "Bow Down", before seguing into an excerpt of a speech by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie on the socialization of girls. The final part uses a staccato, trap <b>beat</b> <b>as</b> Beyoncé reflects on her own feminist attitudes, encouraging self-acceptance among women and criticizing misogynist sentiments.|$|E
500|$|... "Do or Die" [...] {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics.

She considered [...] "Do or Die" [...] {{to be one of}} the album's [...] "most straightforward tracks". Dan Slessor of Alternative Press praised it as one of the album's highlights, in which Thirty Seconds to Mars exercises their capacity for writing [...] "titanic choruses full of sweeping drama in a manner that is almost untouchable". Brent Faulkner from PopMatters gave a mixed response, writing that the song [...] "relies on a familiar <b>beat</b> <b>as</b> well as liberal layering". Writers for Contactmusic commended [...] "Do or Die" [...] as one of the standout songs on Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams and a [...] "slow-burning hit of epic, synth-heavy electronica".|$|E
