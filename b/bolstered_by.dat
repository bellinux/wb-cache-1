5|$|OutKast {{made a deal}} to hold Polaroid cameras {{during some}} of its performances. Polaroid does not release sales figures, but its public image, {{previously}} in decline with {{the growing popularity of}} digital cameras, was <b>bolstered</b> <b>by</b> the song.|$|E
5|$|The 1956 team {{repeated}} as NL champions; {{the team}} was <b>bolstered</b> <b>by</b> the play of Duke Snider, who hit a league-leading 43 home runs and also {{led the league in}} walks. They fell to third place (84-70) in 1957.|$|E
50|$|The use of kenaf is {{anticipated}} to offset 300,000 pounds of oil-based resin {{per year in}} North America and should reduce {{the weight of the}} door <b>bolsters</b> <b>by</b> 25 percent.|$|R
50|$|During the Cromwellian {{siege of}} 1649, this tower and {{sections}} of the city wall were pounded with cannon fire. The tower was not built {{for this type of}} defence, so it required <b>bolstering</b> <b>by</b> half-filling with earth to take the impact of the cannon.|$|R
60|$|Attached to the <b>bolster</b> <b>by</b> a towel, {{under his}} father's bayonet and the oleograph {{depicting}} the Nativity, sat the baby. In the air {{there was the}} scent of him, of walls, and washing, and red herrings. The two young people took their seat on the window-sill.|$|R
5|$|Another {{well-known}} artefact with {{an astronomical}} use is the Antikythera mechanism. In this case {{analysis of the}} artefact, and reference to the description of similar devices described by Cicero, would indicate a plausible use for the device. The argument is <b>bolstered</b> <b>by</b> the presence of symbols on the mechanism, allowing the disc to be read.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bolstered</b> <b>by</b> {{grants and}} subsidies, {{cultural}} events and institutions grew in Fairbanks. The Fairbanks Light Opera Theatre {{was created in}} 1970, and {{groups such as the}} Fairbanks Concert Association and the Northstar Ballet were also created at about the same time. Fairbanks largest arts event, the Summer Arts Festival, began in 1980 and continues today.|$|E
5|$|The city of Arlington {{plans to}} {{increase}} the number of jobs within the city to over 20,000 by 2035, <b>bolstered</b> <b>by</b> the proposed designation of the Arlington-Marysville Manufacturing Industrial Center by the Puget Sound Regional Council.

50|$|The {{development}} of the province was <b>bolstered</b> further <b>by</b> {{the construction of the}} Saint Petersburg-Riihimäki railroad in 1870, the Viborg-Joensuu railroad in 1894 and the Petrograd-Hiitola railroad in 1917.|$|R

5|$|A police {{van with}} two {{officers}} arrived {{a short time}} after the shootings began, at around 11:00. They entered the yard of the college where they were shot at by Saari, and forced to retreat. From around 11:45 to 12:00 further police units, <b>bolstered</b> <b>by</b> a number of armoured vehicles, began to arrive on the scene. They attempted to enter the building through the main corridor, but this assault was aborted due to the black smoke that was emanating from within the building.|$|E
5|$|Although {{traditionally}} {{depicted as}} a biped, {{it has been suggested}} since the mid-1970s that Spinosaurus was at least an occasional quadruped. This has been <b>bolstered</b> <b>by</b> the discovery of Baryonyx, a relative with robust arms. Because of the mass of the hypothesized fatty dorsal humps of Spinosaurus, Bailey (1997) was open to the possibility of a quadrupedal posture, leading to new restorations of it as such. The hypothesis that Spinosaurus had a typical quadrupedal gait has fallen out of favor, though spinosaurids may have crouched in a quadrupedal posture.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bolstered</b> <b>by</b> {{the fresh}} troops, the Spartans and their Macedonian allies {{prepared}} themselves for Pyrrhus' next assault against the trench. The presence of more adversaries intensified Pyrrhus' determination {{to capture the}} city and he ordered another attack on the trenches. He was unable to accomplish anything and suffered further losses. The failure of this attack convinced Pyrrhus about the futility of persevering with the siege {{and he decided to}} lift it and withdraw.|$|E
2500|$|The fame of the tribes' {{tenacity}} {{and fighting}} skills, probably <b>bolstered</b> [...] <b>by</b> dime novels, was widely known among Europeans. In early 20th century Parisian society, the word Apache was adopted into French, essentially meaning an outlaw.|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} whether auditors adjust their effort and pricing decisions for political visibility. We argue, from the behavioural literature, that political visibility will create {{the need for}} more justification by auditors. Using data on actual audit fees, hours and billing rates for a sample of New Zealand public sector companies, we find that total audit fees are positively related to the number of press mentions (our proxy for political visibility). Consistent with our expectations we find that audit fees are monotonically related to audit fees. We also find that auditors increase the hours spent on the audit but not billing rates, which further suggests defensive <b>bolstering</b> <b>by</b> auditors. Copyright (c) 2010 The Authors.

5|$|Following on from Tintin in the Land of the Soviets and <b>bolstered</b> <b>by</b> {{publicity}} stunts, Tintin in the Congo was {{a commercial}} success within Belgium {{and was also}} serialised in France. Hergé continued The Adventures of Tintin with Tintin in America in 1932, and the series subsequently became a defining part of the Franco-Belgian comics tradition. In 1946, Hergé re-drew and coloured Tintin in the Congo in his distinctive ligne-claire style for republication by Casterman, with further alterations made {{at the request of}} his Scandinavian publisher for a 1975 edition.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after his}} coronation, Mindaugas {{transferred}} some lands to the Livonian Order – portions of Samogitia, Nadruva, and Dainava—although his control over these western lands was tenuous. There {{has been much}} discussion among historians as to whether in later years (1255–1261) Mindaugas gave even more lands to the order. The deeds might have been falsified by the order; the case for this scenario is <b>bolstered</b> <b>by</b> {{the fact that some}} of the documents mention lands that were not actually under the control of Mindaugas and by various irregularities in treaty witnesses and seals.|$|E
5|$|In March 1935, Chadwick {{received}} {{an offer of}} the Lyon Jones Chair of physics at the University of Liverpool, in his wife's home town, to succeed Lionel Wilberforce. The laboratory was so antiquated that it still ran on direct current electricity, but Chadwick seized the opportunity, assuming the chair on 1 October 1935. The university's prestige was soon <b>bolstered</b> <b>by</b> Chadwick's Nobel Prize, which was announced in November 1935. His medal was sold at auction in 2014 for $329,000.|$|E
50|$|Crestwood has a {{very active}} SEN policy, with a higher than average {{proportion}} of SEN pupils than most other schools, this has been <b>bolstered</b> recently <b>by</b> {{the introduction of a}} scheme whereby Crestwood becomes the major centre for deaf or hard of hearing pupils throughout the Dudley Metropolitan Borough.|$|R

40|$|Some {{comparisons}} are hard. How should {{we think about}} such comparisons? According to John Broome, we should think about {{them in terms of}} vagueness. But the vagueness account has remained unpopular thus far. Here I try to <b>bolster</b> it <b>by</b> clarifying the notion of comparative vagueness that lies at its heart...|$|R
5|$|Industry {{observers}} have attributed Lexus' early marketing successes {{to higher levels}} of perceived quality and lower prices than competitors, which have enabled the marque to attract customers upgrading from mass-market cars. A reputation for dependability, <b>bolstered</b> <b>by</b> reliability surveys, also became a primary factor in attracting new customers from rival premium makes. Lexus has since grown to command higher price premiums than rival Japanese makes, with new models further increasing in price and reaching the more than $100,000 ultra-luxury category long dominated by rival European marques.|$|E
5|$|Liliʻuokalani {{ascended to}} the throne on January 29, 1891, nine days after her brother's death. During her reign, she {{attempted}} to draft a new constitution which would restore {{the power of the}} monarchy and the voting rights of the economically disenfranchised. Threatened by her attempts to abrogate the Bayonet Constitution, pro-American elements in Hawaii overthrew the monarchy on January 17, 1893. The overthrow was <b>bolstered</b> <b>by</b> the landing of US Marines under John L. Stevens to protect American interests, which rendered the monarchy unable to protect itself.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, 2nd Saudi Arabian National Guard Brigade's 5th Battalion moved {{north of}} Khafji to block Iraqi {{reinforcements}} attempting {{to reach the}} city. This unit was further <b>bolstered</b> <b>by</b> the 8th Ministry of Defense and Aviation Brigade, and heavily aided by Coalition air support. Although fear of friendly fire forced the 8th Ministry of Defense and Aviation Brigade to pull back the following morning, Coalition aircraft successfully hindered Iraqi attempts to move more soldiers down to Khafji and caused large numbers of Iraqi troops to surrender to Saudi forces.|$|E

25|$|Immediately upon Inauguration in 1869, Grant <b>bolstered</b> Reconstruction <b>by</b> prodding Congress to readmit Virginia, Mississippi, and Texas {{into the}} Union, while {{ensuring}} their constitutions protected every citizen's voting rights. Grant met with prominent black leaders for consultation, {{and signed a}} bill into law that guaranteed equal rights to both blacks and whites in Washington D.C.|$|R
5|$|Six {{years later}} Beckham again {{attempted}} {{to win the}} Senate seat. Due {{to the passage of}} the Seventeenth Amendment, the senator would not be elected by the legislature, but by popular vote. In the Democratic primary Beckham defeated Augustus O. Stanley, a 12-year veteran congressman. The Republican nominee was former governor Augustus E. Willson. <b>Bolstered</b> <b>by</b> his support of President Woodrow Wilson, Beckham won the election by 32,000 votes.|$|E
5|$|The Polish {{soldiers}} {{serving in}} the Dąbrowski Legion were granted Lombardian citizenship and were paid the same wage as other troops. They were allowed {{to use their own}} unique Polish-style uniforms, with some French and Lombardian symbols, and were commanded by other Polish speakers. By early February 1797 the Legion was 1,200 strong, having been <b>bolstered</b> <b>by</b> the arrival of many new recruits who had deserted from the Austrian army.|$|E
5|$|The series {{marked the}} first time that an NHL team with a captain from Europe had made the Finals, as Senators captain Alfredsson hails from Sweden. (Previously, only Americans or Canadians had captained teams in the Finals.) Alfredsson {{would be one of the}} bright lights for the Senators in the series, as he had been in all the playoff series. But he would be one of the few bright lights as Anaheim won the series in five games <b>bolstered</b> <b>by</b> strong {{defensive}} play and opportunistic scoring.|$|E
50|$|Among topics {{discussed}} were ending fiscal misappropriation and attracting foreign investment. Presented at the Congress was the 8th National Socio-Economic Development Plan, which {{strives to}} remove Laos {{from the list}} of the world's most underdeveloped countries by 2020.

40|$|Formulation’s {{strategies}} {{occur in}} the spoken text and are intended to structure and organize the statements of a text {{so that it is}} understandable to the interlocutor, who must interpret it satisfactorily. In this act of formulating and reformulating sentences, some language changes can be seen not only in the informational content, but also in morphosyntatic field. In this work, we found the verbal changes that happen in the formulation process in events that feature especially remediation strategies and paraphrase. For this, we used the verb notions and formulating strategies presented by Ilari & Basso (2008), Castilho (2002; 2010) and Favero, Andrade & Aquino (1999; 2006), among others, which are <b>bolster</b> <b>by</b> a functionalist view of language. Thus, we intend to highlight the importance of addressing the study of the verbs class on a functionalist perspective, which considers the language spoken in their real context of use...|$|R
