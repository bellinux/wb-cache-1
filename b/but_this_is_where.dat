5|$|Yosemite Valley {{represents}} only {{one percent of}} the park area, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>where</b> most visitors arrive and stay. The Tunnel View is the first view of the Valley for many visitors and is extensively photographed. El Capitan, a prominent granite cliff that looms over Yosemite Valley, {{is one of the most}} popular rock climbing destinations in the world because of its diverse range of climbing routes in addition to its year-round accessibility. Granite domes such as Sentinel Dome and Half Dome rise , respectively, above the valley floor.|$|E
25|$|The next {{event is}} a right-angle bend, of no {{apparent}} significance from the boat, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>where</b> the canal (and the Trent) changes its basic direction from south-east (heading away from Runcorn) to north-east (heading towards Nottingham).|$|E
25|$|There {{is today}} a general {{consensus}} that all modern amphibians, the Lissamphibia, {{have their origin in}} Labyrinthodont stock, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>where</b> consensus ends. The fragile {{bones of the}} Lissamphibians are extremely rare as fossils, and the modern amphibians are highly derived, making comparison with fossil Labyrinthodonts difficult.|$|E
50|$|In {{the close}} season before the 1977-78 season, Channon left Southampton — {{still in the}} Second Division — to join Manchester City in a £300,000 deal. His new club were making progress, having just {{finished}} second in the First Division behind champions Liverpool, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>where</b> they peaked and Channon struggled to settle. He scored just 12 goals in his first season and 11 in his second.|$|R
50|$|Perinetti didn’t {{have much}} {{experience}} in the lower leagues after leading teams at the top, so his role as sporting director {{would have been much}} harder than he thought. It was difficult to find players at that level, to kickstart their careers in the fourth division of Italian football, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>where</b> his experience and knowledge, earned over a career that spanned 43 years, came to the fore His first major deal came with the appointment of manager Paolo Favaretto, who, unlike Perinetti, was experienced in managing at this level.|$|R
60|$|Again Jerry's {{feelings}} were outraged. He could understand flank attack. Often he and Michael had played at that, {{although it had}} only been playing. But to retreat without fighting from a fight once started was alien to Jerry's ways and nature. With righteous wrath he charged into the hole after his enemy. <b>But</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>where</b> the wild-dog fought to best advantage--in a corner. When Jerry sprang up in the confined space he bumped {{his head on the}} box above, and the next moment felt the snarling impact of the other's teeth against his own teeth and jaw.|$|R
500|$|Solo {{became the}} twenty-seventh American woman and second goalkeeper to reach 100 caps with her {{start in the}} 3–1 {{semifinal}} win over France.

If {{anything happens to}} me before I can bring this off, I'm hanged if I know what to tell you to do with the packet. It's worth its weight in banknotes to more persons than one, but there's a beastly risk in having anything to do with it. I think you'd better burn it! There's money in it, but I don't see how you could handle it. Burn it, Agnes. It's too risky a business for you! I only hope that in a week or so I shall burn this letter myself, and you and I will be on our way to America.|$|E

40|$|Entrepreneurs {{are those}} that {{have a passion for}} {{creating}} and growing an enterprise. They have motivation and capacity in abundance.

50|$|Situated in a {{facsimile}} of London's Christmas Square, {{the special}} is co-hosted by Rex (Johnny Counterfit), an erudite and intellectual Tyrannosaurus Rex, and Herb (Tim Conner), a dimwitted, bespectacled Styracosaurus with a voracious appetite. Some critics have cited similarities {{between these two}} characters and film critics Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert. Rex and Herb previously appeared in Vinton's Dinosaurs! - A Fun-Filled Trip Back in Time!, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>where</b> they were given speech and more complex personalities.|$|E
5000|$|The {{history of}} Sogod Parish {{seems to be}} an endless cycle of starts and {{beginnings}} (Even its present church building which was started in the early 1960s and considered one of the biggest in the diocese is still unfinished.) <b>But</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>where</b> one can find the charm of the place and its people.

5000|$|<b>But</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>where</b> the {{agreement}} ends; philosophers differ widely over the exact {{diagnosis of the}} situation, and the lesson to be taken from it.

We might call the former optimists about philosophical progress and the latter pessimists. (Note that being a pessimist {{about the prospects for}} philosophical progress {{is not the same as}} being a pessimist about philosophy. See below.) ...|$|E

50|$|Roelofs {{was born}} on the Hommema-sate (estate) near Hijum in Friesland, the {{youngest}} of four sons and two daughters. His father was Roelof Pytters, a tenant farmer and tax receiver. His mother was Neeltje Alberts from Finkum. The oldest son Klaas trained as a steersman, but did not work as one, and instead became a doctor in Sexbierum. The other sister Lisbeth married and left the household. It {{was not an easy}} life on the farm, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>where</b> the other three boys, Pieter, Albert and Arjen worked.

50|$|It {{is ironic}} that the only wine growing region {{of the state of}} Saarland is not {{actually}} on the River Saar, but on the Upper Moselle in the municipality of Perl. <b>But</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> not <b>where</b> Saar wine <b>is</b> made which is also part of the Moselle wine region; that comes from the lower reaches of the Saar in the state of Rhineland-Palatinate. The wine made in the Saarland in the Moseltor ("Moselle Gate") area is also a Moselle wine.|$|R
50|$|The general plot of {{the first}} season was the two would be heroes going out to find a dragon to kill, just so they could become rich and famous - and never {{have to pay for}} a drink again.

The second season has them being given another quest - to rescue a maiden. Indirectly, the two heroes manage to do just that. The third season has the heroes being prepared to face off against the often mentioned Dragon of Silverlake.|$|E
50|$|The {{federation}} is {{governing the}} national leagues in Russia, {{which is set}} up in a top-tier Russian Bandy Super League and second tier leagues, as well as the Russian Cup. The Russian Bandy Super League is fully professional and the winning team each year is crowned Russian champions. There are also a lot of regional and city leagues for minor and junior teams, which are not directly connected to the national leagues (teams can not be promoted to a national league) <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>where</b> new bandy talents are discovered.

50|$|Yosemite Valley {{represents}} only {{one percent of}} the park area, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>where</b> most visitors arrive and stay. More than half a dozen creeks tumble from hanging valleys at the top of granite cliffs that can rise 3000-4000 feet (900-1200 m) above the valley floor, which itself is 4000 ft (1200 m) above sea level. These streams combine into the Merced River, which flows out from the western end of the valley, down the rest of its canyon to the San Joaquin Valley. The flat floor of Yosemite Valley holds both forest and large open meadows, which provide breathtaking views of the surrounding crests and waterfalls.|$|E
50|$|Lemi Abiodun Ghariokwu {{was born}} Emmanuel Sunday on 26 December 1955, in Agege, Lagos. He is from Agbor, Delta State but has spent {{all his life}} in Lagos, Nigeria.

His father {{wanted him to be}} a mechanical engineer, so he attended a technical school; Yaba College of Technology Secondary School, where he studied technical and science subjects <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>where</b> his school journey ended.

His maturity into self and social consciousness was facilitated by Fela Kuti, Peter Tosh, Marcus Garvey, Malcolm X, Kwame Nkrumah and Steve Biko. Lemi is married with four children - Asilem Eweka, Tamara Ajasa, Omotosho, and Odafin-Nevo Shekinah.|$|R
