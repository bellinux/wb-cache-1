40|$|Lottery {{policies}} have been created by many states to generate additional funds to support public initiatives, such as higher education scholarships. In 2009, Arkansas adopted a lottery to generate higher education scholarships. The purpose of this qualitative case {{study was to examine}} the Arkansas state lottery policy design process to better understand how the Social construction of higher education students and other citizens became embedded within the policy. The Social construction of target populations theory (Ingram 2 ̆ 6 Schneider, 1993), guided three research questions regarding how policy actors in Arkansas Socially constructed citizens while designing lottery legislation, how these Social constructions became embedded within the policy, and how the Social constructions became communicated to the public. Through 18 participant interviews, document analysis, and journaling, this study examined how policy actors Socially constructed target populations while forming lottery policy. The findings were presented as a descriptive analysis, which outlined the development of the lottery policy, and an interpretive analysis, which was guided by the three research questions. In the current study, I found that policy actors Socially constructed three targeted populations when designing the lottery scholarship act: (a) students as <b>beneficiaries,</b> (<b>b)</b> lottery players supplying the extra revenue, identified as mostly composed of low-income citizens, and (c) retailers and vendors as beneficiaries. Policy actors embedded these constructions into the policy design through several ways: (a) the initiated act developed constructions of students, (b) the modification of the Academic Challenge scholarship, (c) competing goals for this policy were created since access did not necessarily guarantee degree completion, and (d) the retail and vendor community received favorable benefits in the form of commission and state contracts. These constructions were communicated to the public by the messages created in the Hope for Arkansas lottery campaign and the development of the policy, which was conveyed through the media and the Arkansas Department of Higher Education. The study concludes with recommendations for future research and implications for policy and practice, which focus on sustainability of scholarship award amounts, programs for the poor, and strategies to accomplish degree completion and access goals within the policy...|$|R

40|$|Conditional cash {{transfers}} (CCTs) {{have become}} a popular tool to reduce poverty and inequality {{in the short run}} and to promote investments in human capital. CCTs are now present in almost all parts of the developing world, especially in Latin America. As the name indicates, CCT programs transfer money to a targeted group conditional on the recipient’s behavior, such as school attendance for children, vaccinations, health checks for infants and pregnant women, and attendance of workshops on hygiene and nutrition. Oportunidades (previously named Progresa) is a CCT program in Mexico that consists of three components: one related to education, one to health, and one to nutrition. According to Levy (2006), Oportunidades transfers represent, on average, 25 percent of household income for Mexico’s rural poor and between 15 and 20 percent for the urban poor 1. The program has expanded rapidly since its inception: starting from 140 thousand households in August 1997, it reached 5 million households at the beginning of 2008. Given its large size, Oportunidades is expected to have large indirect and second-round effects on the economy.

40|$|Sponsors {{and clients}} of {{agricultural}} R&D are showing increasing concern about research costs and benefits. R&D organisations need {{to assess the}} impact of research to justify spending, obtain continuous technical and financial support from donors, and research sponsors. Further, impact assessment for R&D organisations are essential to assess their management systems in order to optimise the benefits from scarce research resources. At present criteria to assess the performance, objective verifiable indicators and means of verification are not available. No systematic method is in practice to assess the research management performance. Therefore, a study was under taken to develop tea R&D management criteria and incorporated these in a methodology to assess performance of research management in the tea sector. A case study approach was adopted. Six case studies were conducted on Tea Research Institutes of Asia and Africa. Case studies were grouped into two phases. Phase One was exploratory in nature and developed the conceptual framework for the research. This enabled the identification of research management criteria, objective verifiable indicators and means of verification. These can be used to improve in R&D management decision making. In addition, a scoring model was developed to assess the performance of research management in tea. Phase Two applied the developed conceptual model to four tea R&D organisations and analysed their performance. This clearly showed that the identified criteria and developed conceptual model can be used to analyses the performance of tea R&D management. Results indicated that there is lack of a structured approach to organising and conducting R&D activities. Research is carried out without any systematic approach for research prioritisation. Appraisal and resource allocation are inadequately addressed. Management information systems for rational, quick and effective decision making for the most part are weak and unorganised. Data on resource utilisation and benefits derived by individual research projects are rarely recorded and maintained properly. There is a lack of general awareness especially regarding importance of studying the rate of uptake of technology. A good correlation, however, was observed between organisations adopting best practices and suggested guidelines and the performance of tea R&D organisations in terms of perceived benefit to the client industry. The most effective R&D was associated with committee culture, problem identification, monitoring, evaluation, publication, technology dissemination and feedback. The developed model was applied in specific context of Bangladesh Tea Research Institute. Specific suggestions are made on how to improve the linkages with the industry, better ways of problem identification, evaluation and technology dissemination, and there by increased contribution to the productivity of the tea sector. A research management cycle (RPCM) was developed which proposes to carry out research in an organised way emphasising the participation of the <b>beneficiary.</b> <b>Best</b> practices for all the identified criteria and guidelines for major research management criteria were developed to support in R&D decision making.

In this paper, we present a microsimulation model to predict drug expenditures in 2001 for a representative cohort of Medicare beneficiaries under the status quo and three different plans: (1) a catastrophic plan modeled on the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act (PL 100 - 360), which was passed in 1988 but repealed one year later after higher-income Medicare beneficiaries protested new premiums, (2) a zero-deductible plan that caps out-of-pocket expenses at $ 4, 000 per year, and (3) a zero-deductible plan that does not cap out-of-pocket expenses. We use data from a representative sample of Medicare Part <b>B</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> from the 1995 Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS) Cost and Use file. Under the status quo, drug expenses average $ 1, 459 per beneficiary, out-of-pocket costs average $ 646, and 8. 2 % of the population has very high expenses (defined as more than $ 2, 000 out-of-pocket for drugs). Under a catastrophic plan, average annual drug expenses are $ 1, 344, out-of-pocket costs are $ 645, and 6. 8 % of beneficiaries have very high expenses.

40|$|Background Despite its {{effectiveness}} in reducing mortality, colorectal cancer (CRC) screening rates are low, especially among low-income and minority groups; however, physician recommendation can increase screening rates. Methods We performed a multilevel {{analysis of the}} Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey data linked to Medicare claims and the Area Resource File to identify determinants of racial and socioeconomic disparities in CRC screening among 9985 Medicare Parts A and <b>B</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> with a usual physician. Recent CRC screening was defined as receipt of either a home fecal occult blood test, flexible sigmoidoscopy, or colonoscopy at recommended intervals. Results Unadjusted rates of screening were 48 % for white and 39 % for black beneficiaries (P<. 001). Racial differences in CRC screening receipt were eliminated after adjustment for socioeconomic status as measured by income and education. Socioeconomic status disparities decreased but remained significant after adjustment for personal and health system factors. Awareness of CRC (adjusted odds ratio, 2. 76; 95 % confidence interval, 2. 29 - 3. 33) and having a primary care generalist (vs another specialist) as one's usual physician (adjusted odds ratio, 1. 31; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 12 - 1. 53) were associated with higher odds of screening, controlling for other factors. The odds of screening were also higher among those whose usual physician was rated more highly on information-giving skills. Conclusions Racial differences in CRC screening rates among Medicare beneficiaries with a usual physician are explained by differences in socioeconomic status. Beneficiaries with a primary care generalist as their usual physician had higher rates of CRC screening receipt. Increased efforts to make Medicare beneficiaries aware {{of the benefits of}} CRC screening may capitalize on the associations found in this study between CRC knowledge, physician information giving, and timely screening...|$|R

MethodsThis is a retrospective cohort analysis of a 100 % sample of annualized Medicare claims data on 1 157 475 beneficiaries aged 66 to 99 years with an office visit to either a chiropractor or primary care physician for neck pain. We compared hazard of vertebrobasilar stroke and any stroke at 7 and 30 days after office visit using a Cox proportional hazards model. We used direct adjusted survival curves to estimate cumulative probability of stroke up to 30 days for the 2 cohorts. ResultsThe proportion of subjects with stroke of any type in the chiropractic cohort was 1. 2 per 1000 at 7 days and 5. 1 per 1000 at 30 days. In the primary care cohort, the proportion of subjects with stroke of any type was 1. 4 per 1000 at 7 days and 2. 8 per 1000 at 30 days. In the chiropractic cohort, the adjusted risk of stroke was significantly lower at 7 days as compared to the primary care cohort (hazard ratio, 0. 39; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 33 - 0. 45), but at 30 days, a slight elevation in risk was observed for the chiropractic cohort (hazard ratio, 1. 10; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 01 - 1. 19).

40|$|South African {{affirmative action}} {{law in the}} {{workplace}} is in its infancy. Yet some concepts in this context have already proven to be unclear or in need of interpretation, or are lacking. This thesis focuses on the beneficiaries of affirmative action in employment law. The Employment Equity Act (EEA) creates `designated groups' &# 9472; black people, women and people with disabilities &# 9472; as the beneficiaries of affirmative action. It lays down two requirements for beneficiaries of affirmative action which are investigated: (a) beneficiaries must be from the designated groups - in this regard, the {{question that arises is}} whether, having been categorised as disadvantaged, persons are presumed to be de facto disadvantaged and entitled to benefit from affirmative action, or whether further evidence of actual past disadvantage is required; and (<b>b)</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> must be `suitably qualified'. In addition, citizenship as a third requirement for beneficiaries of affirmative action has been mooted in case law. This is evaluated against modern interpretation theory, the Constitution and discrimination law. Against the background of a comparative investigation of the position in the US and Canada, and under international law, specific findings and recommendations are made in respect of South African affirmative action law. These relate to the interpretation of the concept `disadvantage', to a pragmatic and contextualised approach to the notion `degrees of disadvantage', to the recognition of the concept `multiple disadvantage', to the clarification of the meaning and application of the concept `suitably qualified' in a code of good practice, and to a policy decision by government to ensure that affirmative action measures apply mainly to South African citizens who otherwise qualify to benefit. To this end, certain amendments to the EEA, its regulations and codes of good practice are proposed with the aim of ensuring that affirmative action measures in fact benefit those intended by the EEA. Some projections are made to indicate the way forward for affirmative action in South Africa. JurisprudenceLL. D...|$|R
40|$|The {{highland}} Tigray {{region of}} Northern Ethiopia has historically suffered significantly from drought shock events. These events, {{coupled with a}} high poverty rate- have left a severe impact on the agricultural output and community survival of the region. Several development interventions have been implemented in Ethiopia to address the effects of drought and poverty, the largest being the recent Food for Work Productive Safety Net Programme (PSNP). The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess the food security and drought survival needs of Ethiopian communities, more specifically, communities in the Northern Tigray Region. The main research questions were: (a) what are major themes from the permanent literature on the PSNP's management policies' impact at the <b>beneficiary</b> level; and (<b>b)</b> what are common needs of drought prone villages in the Tigray Region of Northern Ethiopia? Research Question (a) was approached through content analysis of six purposely chosen peer reviewed journal articles related to the implementation of the first five years of the PSNP. Data was analyzed through the constant comparative method and two major themes emerged: Targeting Policy, and Transfer Policy. To address Research Question (b), the researcher traveled to four drought prone villages in the Tigray Region and facilitated a combination of Participatory Rural Appraisal and Rapid Rural Appraisal techniques to assess community-level needs. Interviews with Non-Governmental Agency employees, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development employees, and University faculty provided institutional perspective to the research question. Data was analyzed using the constant comparative method and inductively formed into 11 themes, housed in three sectors: Economic Diversification, Environmental Management, and Social Coping Mechanisms. The results of this study concurred with food security literature; namely that mechanisms for selecting intervention beneficiaries (i. e., targeting policy) and the process for distributing benefits (i. e., transfer policy) are practical concerns at the village level in Ethiopia. Analysis of participatory data formed a framework of community drought survival needs in the context of the Tigray Region. Asset building, water management, and human capacity are example needs which emerged from this study and should be addressed for the long term improvement of Ethiopia's resilience to drought shock events...|$|R
