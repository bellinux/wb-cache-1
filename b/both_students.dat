Levenson et al. demonstrated how the students' reasoning reflected their concepts of zero and division.|$|E
5|$|As a {{cost-saving}} move, {{effective on}} July 1, 1934, the Georgia Board of Regents transferred {{control of the}} relatively large Evening School of Commerce to the University of Georgia and moved the small civil engineering program at UGA to Tech. The move was controversial, and <b>both</b> <b>students</b> and faculty protested against it, fearing that the Board of Regents would remove other programs from Georgia Tech and reduce it to an engineering department of the University of Georgia. Brittain suggested {{that the lack of}} Georgia Tech alumni on the Board of Regents contributed to their decision. Despite the pressure, the Board of Regents held its ground. The Depression also {{had a significant impact on}} the athletic program, as most athletes were in the commerce school, and resulted in the elimination of athletic scholarships, which were replaced by a loan program. Plans for an industrial management department to replace and supersede the Evening School of Commerce were first made in fall 1934. The department was established in 1935, and evolved into Tech's College of Management.|$|E
5|$|Known {{for more}} than a century of arts, Meridian {{contains}} many art and cultural organizations and hosts many cultural events. One of the first art organizations in the city, The Meridian Art League, was established in February 1933. Art exhibitions were originally held in Lamar Hotel in downtown Meridian, but after a name change to Meridian Art Association in 1949, exhibitions were held at various locations around the city. After the Carnegie library at 25th Ave and 7th St was closed, the Art Association remodelled the building into the Meridian Museum of Art to serve as a permanent home for exhibits. The museum was opened in 1970 and has since featured rotating exhibitions as well as many educational programs for <b>both</b> <b>students</b> and adults. Over thirty exhibitions are held annually, ranging from traditional decorative arts to ethnographic and tribal materials, photography, crafts, and many other works of art. The collection also includes 18th and 19th century portraits, 20th century photography, and several sculptures.|$|E

The analysis of Seevers, et al. (1998) data suggests that <b>both</b> <b>student</b> means and class means are sufficiently reliable measuresfor most purposes. These data are used to illustrate the GT estimation of reliabilities for <b>both</b> <b>student</b> means, involving averaging over items, and class means, involving averaging over <b>both</b> items and <b>students.</b> The use of GT to obtain standard errors for use in interpreting differences in class means is also illustrated and recommendations on the interpretation of class means are given...|$|R

5|$|Like {{his father}} and {{brothers}} before him, Ted attended Harvard College. In his spring semester, {{he was assigned to}} the athlete-oriented Winthrop House, where his brothers had also lived. He was an offensive and defensive end on the freshman football team, with his play being characterized by his large size and fearless style. In his first semester, Kennedy and his classmates arranged to copy answers from another student during the final examination for a science class. At the end of his second semester in May 1951, Kennedy was anxious about maintaining his eligibility for athletics for the next year, and he had a classmate take his place at a Spanish language examination. The ruse was immediately discovered and <b>both</b> <b>students</b> were expelled for cheating. In a standard Harvard treatment for serious disciplinary cases, they were told they could apply for readmission within a year or two if they demonstrated good behavior during that time.|$|E

5|$|World War I {{had a large}} {{impact on}} the school. A newfound sense of patriotism had the {{administration}} require students to recite the Pledge of Allegiance as an entrance requirement to the school. The war also {{had an effect on}} enrollment as all of the male students gradually left the school to join the war efforts; in 1916 there were 421 total students, 382 in 1917, 172 in 1918 (including only one male student), and in 1919, 147 students. In addition to the students, some of the faculty members joined the military. Due to the decreased student enrollment, the remaining faculty had the opportunity to further their own training. On campus, <b>both</b> <b>students</b> and faculty worked with the Red Cross, organized bond drives, and sent packages to troops overseas.|$|E
