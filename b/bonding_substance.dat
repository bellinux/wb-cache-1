30|$|Dental {{adhesive}} {{systems are}} commonly used for bonding the restorative material to the tooth structure. The bonding mechanism is basically characterized by the substitution of superficial tooth minerals for resin monomers, which polymerize in situ, creating a micro-mechanical interlocking between the tooth and the <b>bonding</b> <b>substance.</b> This process is known as hybridization, where a hybrid layer is formed between the tooth substrates and the restorative material [1]. The bonding mechanism starts with {{the application of a}}n acidic substance, which enables the superficial tooth demineralization; then, another substance is used to prepare the demineralized substrate (primer), followed by the application of a resinous substance (resin bond), which links the tooth to the restorative material. Depending on the mode of using or combining these adhesive substances (acid, primer, and resin bond), different adhesive systems are present in the dentistry field.|$|E

Lipid vesicles of one type were elongated into a sausage-like or flattened-saccular shape, and were interassociated into sheets which were usually one vesicle thick. These sheets remained intact during homogenization and centrifugation, because some of the lipid vesicles in the sheet were interconnected through their bounding membranes, and because there seemed to be a <b>bonding</b> <b>substance</b> between adjacent vesicles. These vesicles were called "composite" lipid vesicles to distinguish them from the more usual, or "simple," lipid vesicles of other plant and animal tissues.

40|$|Adhesive bonding {{takes place}} when an {{adhesive}} undergoes the conversion from liquid to solid. The liquid properties {{are needed for}} the adhesive to fully wet the <b>bonding</b> <b>substance,</b> and the solid properties are needed for the strength required for the union of the final product. The mobility of an adhesive depends heavily on its own {{physical and chemical properties}} and those of the wood surface upon which it is being applied. To improve the interaction, wood is often resurfaced prior to bonding to provide a smooth surface with minimal extractives and other debris. Scientists question whether this step is necessary for wood modified by acetylation, which creates a more hydrophobic material. The amount of adhesive penetration into a wood substrate has a direct correlation to the bond quality. Insufficient penetration causes minimal surface contact for chemical bonding or “mechanical interlocking. ” Over-penetration of adhesive will create “starved‘ ‘ or dry bond lines. Fluorescence microscopy is an excellent method of examining adhesive penetration into lumens. It is possible for most adhesives to fluoresce either in their natural form (primary or auto-fluorescence) or when treated with chemicals capable of fluorescing (secondary fluorescence), such as added dyes or pigments. Fluorescence microscopy in our study revealed that the degree of penetration was good for both acetylated and unacetylated wood despite the difference in bond durability. In addition. good lumen penetration did not correlate to poor strength previously observed, therefore leading to the conclusion that lumen penetration does not always relate with bond strength or percent wood failure...|$|E

It is {{important}} for researchers and clinicians to study constructs related {{to the development of}} substance use as this information can provide clinicians and staff working in health centers insight on how to assist students abusing substances. Poor quality relationships with parents have been correlated with substance use; however, studies examining parenting and substance use utilized small, clinical, primarily male samples. Moreover, {{there is a lack of}} research on parental bonding and substance use among college students. The current study examined parental <b>bonding,</b> <b>substance</b> use, age, ethnicity, gender of students, and gender of parents in a college student sample. It was hypothesized that those reporting low parental care and high overprotection would be at increased risk of substance use. Consistent with previous research, men reported using more substances than women. Research on gender, age and ethnicity related to parental bonding and substance use has been limited and contradictory so specific hypotheses were not made regarding these variables. In this study, demographic variables and substance use were unrelated to parental care or overprotection. Latinos and Latinas reported significantly higher paternal overprotection than European-Americans, but contrary to past research this ???over??? protection was not related to poor parental bonding, suggesting that future research examine the utility of such bonding measures for diverse samples.

Maternal health and wellbeing through pregnancy and antenatal bonding also {{play a key role}} in determining bonding postnatally, but the extent to which these relationships may be disrupted by poor mental health or substance use is unclear. This study aimed to examine the extent to which mother-fetal <b>bonding,</b> <b>substance</b> use and mental health through pregnancy predicted postnatal mother-infant bonding at 8  weeks. Participants were 372 women recruited from three metropolitan hospitals in Australia. Data was collected during trimesters one, two and three of pregnancy and 8  weeks postnatal using the Maternal Antenatal Attachment Scale (MAAS), Maternal Postnatal Attachment Scale (MPAS), the Edinburgh Antenatal and Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), the Depression and Anxiety Scales (DASS- 21), frequency and quantity of substance use (caffeine, alcohol and tobacco) as well as a range of demographic and postnatal information. Higher antenatal bonding predicted higher postnatal bonding at all pregnancy time-points in a fully adjusted regression model. Maternal depressive symptoms in trimesters two and three and stress in trimester two were inversely related to poorer mother-infant bonding 8  weeks postnatally. This study extends previous work on the mother's felt bond to her developing child by drawing on a large sample of women and documenting the pattern of this bond at three time points in pregnancy and at 8  weeks postnatally. Utilising multiple antenatal waves allowed precision in isolating the relationships in pregnancy and at key intervention points.

The Greeks inhabitants in Crete and Cyprus used lime mortars as well (Eight century B. C.), whereas Babylonians and Syrians used bitumen to construct stone and brick masonries. Ancient Greeks, similarly, used claimed limestone, while Romans made the first concrete (opus caementicium) : mixed lime putty with brick dust or volcanic ash; Romans used with stone to construct roadways, buildings and aqueducts and walls around a fourth-century B. C. and “by the second century B. C. the new material began to be used for buildings in Rome” (Elliot C. D., 1992, p. 167). B. Herring and S. Miller wrote (Miller S., 2002, p. 16) : Lime-coated mud walls were constructed in central India as early as 2, 500 B.

40|$|Background Mother-infant {{relationship}} {{quality in}} the first year of life has important implications for offspring development through the life course. The emotional bond that a mother feels towards her baby is critical to offspring social, emotional and cognitive development (Bornstein, 2014). Likewise, the capacity for a mother and her infant to share an emotional connection and enjoy a mutually fulfilling and healthy relationship, otherwise known as emotional availability (EA), is critical to establishing positive parent-child relationships (Biringen & Easterbrooks, 2012). Despite an emerging literature on the importance of bonding and EA, little is known about the predictors of the mother’s felt bond to her offspring across pregnancy and the postnatal period as well as emotional availability at infant age 12 -months. Even less is known about the predictors of the relationship between partners and their infants. There are a range of factors theorised to promote bonding and EA in infancy including healthy parent-infant bonding during pregnancy and parent wellbeing (i. e., good mental health and low-risk substance use); yet these factors have not been comprehensively assessed in both mothers and their partners across the first year of life. Aims Four empirical studies sought to examine: (1) maternal bonding to offspring across the pregnancy and postnatal period, and to examine a broad range of sociodemographic and psychosocial predictors of the maternal-offspring bond; (2) the extent to which mother-fetal <b>bonding,</b> <b>substance</b> use and mental health through pregnancy predicted postnatal mother-infant bonding at 8 -weeks; (3) the extent to which postnatal bonding, maternal mental ill-health and substance use at infant age 8 -weeks predicted mother-infant bonding and mother EA at 12 -months of age; and, (4) the role of mother and partner bonding, mental health and substance use at 8 -weeks post-birth on mother and partner-infant EA at 12 -months infant age, accounting for the correlated dyadic influence. Methods Using a sample of pregnant women participating in an Australian pregnancy cohort study of perinatal health and development, participants completed maternal and paternal bonding, mental health and substance use questionnaires at each trimester (one, two and three), 8 -weeks and 12 -months postnatal. Data was collected on a range of sociodemographic and psychosocial factors. The EA Scales were used to code the quality of interactions between mother-infant and partner-infant dyads during a 20 -minute free play observational video recorded at 12 -months infant age. Results Maternal-fetal bonding increased in quality and intensity across the pregnancy period with a plateauing of bonding representations towards the end of pregnancy. Bonding between late pregnancy and the early postnatal period remained relatively stable. Maternal-fetal bonding was the strongest predictor of maternal bonding in the postnatal period, both at 8 -weeks and 12 -months. Mental health and substance use also predicted both maternal and paternal relationship quality, as indicated by bonding and EA measures. Tobacco use for both mothers and partners was negatively associated with EA at 12 -months. Conclusion The results of this thesis show that early bonding to the fetus was not only important in laying the foundation for mother-infant bonding in the early postnatal period, but also later in the postnatal period. Moreover, both maternal mental ill-health and substance use appeared to play a small yet significant role in predicting later bonding. However, it was notable that substance use occurred only infrequently in the sample and that substance abuse/dependence were not reported in this sample. These results highlight the importance of supporting the development of a healthy bond between a mother and her fetus during pregnancy and in the early postnatal period. The results also suggest that interventions could be targeted towards parents struggling with symptoms of depression and/or substance use during pregnancy and postnatal. Interventions aimed at emotional regulation and EA promotion for young parents with a history of depression and substance use might also be helpful in strengthening the mother/partner-child relationship. There is a need for further longitudinal research continuing into the toddler and preschool years, including continued assessment of partners and the important role they play. Targeted interventions aimed at enhancing bonding have the potential to strengthen parent-infant relationships through the first year of life...|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} was to explore whether protective factors such as parental monitoring, parental <b>bonding</b> and parental <b>substance</b> abstinence affect the association between subculture affiliation and adolescents' substance use. We used data from 15 -year-old elementary school pupils (N = 1380; mean age = 15. 47; response 79. 5 %) who participated in the Health Behaviour in School Aged Children 2009 / 2010 study. The association between subculture affiliation and substance use (smoking, drinking alcohol, drunkenness, and cannabis use) was adjusted for parental monitoring, parental <b>bonding</b> and parental <b>substance</b> abstinence for boys and girls separately using logistic regression. Adolescents affiliated to one of the selected youth subcultures were significantly more likely to use substances than other 15 -years-olds, except for cannabis use in girls. Adjustment for parental monitoring reduced the association between subculture affiliation and substance use by 31 - 64 % in girls and by 10 - 23 % in boys. Adjustment for parental <b>bonding</b> and parental <b>substance</b> abstinence led to no changes or minor changes. After adjustments for protective factors, subculture affiliation remained significantly associated with substance use. The role of protective factors in adolescents with a subculture affiliation regarding substance use is rather limited. Our findings imply that preventive strategies targeting youth subcultures should take protective factors into account and be gender-specific. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

30|$|The {{polarity}} of a monomer is {{a characteristic}} that shows its hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity ratio [7]. Generally, the primer substance is applied over the dentin substrate, {{which is a}} humid structure that is chemically compatible with hydrophilic molecules; so, the primer should be hydrophilic, enabling the resin monomers infiltration into the demineralized dentin, leading to their entanglement with the exposed collagen fibrils [27]. Nevertheless, hydrophilic substances tend to suffer faster degradation phenomena due to the hydrolysis processes {{that occur in the}} oral environment [7, 24]. In contrast, the resin <b>bond</b> <b>substance,</b> which is applied over the primer, should be a hydrophobic material, as this characteristic implies strength and more stability for the adhesive to resist the degradation phenomena [28]. Even so, the resin bond should be only moderately hydrophobic, as a poor interaction between the primer and the resin bond may occur (phase separation). Considering that the same primer formulation was used in the current study, the Exothane-based adhesives (experimental resin bonds) have probably an extremely hydrophobic nature, as very low bond strength results were obtained (Figure  2), whit complete adhesive failure modes. This characteristic shows that a proper interaction between the primer and the experimental resin bonds have not occurred, including for the control UDMA-based resin bond. This result may suggest that the urethane derivatives investigated in this study are hydrophobic substances, even when they are mixed with TEGDMA (a more hydrophilic monomer). On the other hand, the control CLSE showed 55 % of cohesive/mixed failure modes, indicating that a strong hybrid layer was created between the dentin substrate and the adhesive components. This is already understood because the CLSE is constituted by 10 -methacryloyloxydecyl dihydrogen phosphate (MDP), which enables a chemical and a micro-mechanical bonding mechanisms [2], improving the bond strength results, as confirmed by the present study.|$|R
