5|$|In 1785 {{the castle}} {{was bought by}} the Oxford County Justices and {{rebuilding}} began under the London architect William Blackburn. The wider castle site had already <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> by the late 18th century, with New Road being built through the bailey and the last parts of the castle moat being filled in to allow {{the building of the}} new Oxford Canal terminus. Building the new prison included demolishing the old college attached to St George's chapel and repositioning part of the crypt in 1794. The work was completed under Daniel Harris in 1805. Harris gained a reasonable salary as the new governor and used convict labour from the prison to conduct early archaeological excavations at the castle {{with the help of the}} antiquarian Edward King.|$|E
5|$|Continental {{reformer}} Philipp Melanchthon {{was aware}} that he was very much admired by Henry. In early 1539, Melanchthon wrote several letters to Henry criticising his views on religion, in particular his support of clerical celibacy. By late April another delegation from the Lutheran princes arrived to build on Melanchthon's exhortations. Cromwell {{wrote a letter to the}} king in support of the new Lutheran mission. However, the king had <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> his stance and concentrated on wooing conservative opinion in England rather than reaching out to the Lutherans. On 28 April 1539, Parliament met for the first time in three years. Cranmer was present, but Cromwell was unable to attend due to ill health. On 5 May the House of Lords created a committee with the customary religious balance between conservatives and reformers to examine and determine doctrine. However, the committee was given little time to do the detailed work needed for a thorough revision. On 16 May, the Duke of Norfolk noted that the committee had not agreed on anything, and proposed that the Lords examine six doctrinal questions—which eventually formed the basis of the Six Articles. They affirmed the conservative interpretation of doctrines such as the real presence, clerical celibacy, and the necessity of auricular confession, the private confession of sins to a priest. As the Act of the Six Articles neared passage in Parliament, Cranmer moved his wife and children out of England to safety. Up until this time, the family was kept quietly hidden, most likely in Ford Palace in Kent. The Act passed Parliament at the end of June and it forced Latimer and Nicholas Shaxton to resign their dioceses given their outspoken opposition to the measure.|$|E

25|$|A 1982 {{survey of}} romance readers {{confirmed}} that the new styles of writing were attracting new readers to the genre. 35% of the readers surveyed had begun reading romances after 1977. An additional 31% of those surveyed had been readers for between 6 and 10 years, meaning they had become interested in the genre after 1972, when Woodiwiss's revolutionary novel was published. This means that two-thirds of those surveyed joined the genre after it had <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> <b>change.</b>|$|E
25|$|While fantasy has {{remained}} {{somewhat of a}} niche market, this has <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> in recent years. The long-running series of light fantasies by Piers Anthony (Xanth) and Terry Pratchett (Discworld) regularly hit the bestseller lists from the 1980s onward. Thanks largely to J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter novels, which have become the best selling book series of all time, fantasy is becoming increasingly intertwined with mainstream fiction. The blockbuster success of several film adaptations of fantasy novels such as The Lord of the Rings and The Chronicles of Narnia has helped further this trend.|$|E
25|$|Illiteracy {{is both an}} {{important}} cause, and {{an important}} effect, of chronic global poverty. Improvements in livelihoods and access to services in rural communities depends {{on their ability to}} manage local organizations, or hold external ones accountable. The processes of development can also be undermined by educated agents of development whose 'deeply interiorized literacy' informs their decisions. In recent years this has <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> <b>change,</b> with methods of engagement with oral communities that have emphasized participation, voice, and other development methods like participatory rural appraisal, participatory action research and Farmer Field Schools.|$|E

25|$|By the 1880s Russian {{literature}} had <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> <b>change.</b> The age of {{the great}} novelists was over and short fiction and poetry became the dominant genres of Russian literature {{for the next several}} decades, which later became known as the Silver Age of Russian Poetry. Previously dominated by realism, Russian literature came under strong influence of symbolism in the years between 1893 and 1914. Leading writers of this age include Valery Bryusov, Andrei Bely, Vyacheslav Ivanov, Aleksandr Blok, Nikolay Gumilev, Dmitry Merezhkovsky, Fyodor Sologub, Anna Akhmatova, Osip Mandelstam, Marina Tsvetaeva, Leonid Andreyev, Ivan Bunin, and Maxim Gorky.|$|E
25|$|However, a major {{defeat at}} the battle of Spercheios in 996 {{signaled}} that the tide of the war had <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> in the Byzantines' favour. From 1001 onwards, Basil II launched yearly campaigns into Bulgarian territory, methodically taking important cities such as Preslav, Pliska and Vidin, and inflicting several defeats on Samuil. In addition, in 1003 Samuil was involved in a war with the Kingdom of Hungary. After years of campaigning, in 1014, in the decisive battle of Kleidion the Bulgarian army was crushed and 14,000 captured Bulgarian soldiers were blinded and sent to Samuil, who died at the sight of his army on 6 October.|$|E
25|$|The Canadian {{government}} had already <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> its energy policy. Inflation {{had become a}} national problem and oil prices were rising, and on September 4, 1973 Pierre Trudeau asked the western provinces {{to agree to a}} voluntary freeze on oil prices. Nine days later, his government imposed a 40-cent tax on every barrel of exported Canadian oil. The tax equalled the difference between domestic and international oil prices, and the revenues were used to subsidize imports for eastern refiners. At a stroke, Ottawa began subsidizing eastern consumers while reducing the revenues available to producing provinces and the petroleum industry. Alberta premier Peter Lougheed soon announced that his government would revise its royalty policy in favour of a system linked to international oil prices.|$|E

25|$|The current constitution, {{created in}} 1982, states in Article V that no {{organization}} or individual {{is above the}} law and in Article III makes the People’s Congresses and state administration responsible to the people, {{paving the way for}} later efforts to allow enforcement of individual rights. Passage of the Administrative Litigation Law of 1987 created legal recourse for individuals from arbitrary government action, an avenue previously unavailable. Despite the deep-seated norm against legal proceedings, litigation in the Chinese courts has increased dramatically, especially in recent years. The continuing weakness of courts resulting from their dependence on the local government for financial support and enforcement undermines the effectiveness of these remedies but this has also <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> with China’s initiatives to increase legal training and the professionalism of the judiciary.|$|E

500|$|Independent of the LM, the LCL had <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> <b>change.</b> It {{eventually}} supported Don Dunstan's {{bills for}} electoral reform, {{both to the}} House of Assembly and the Legislative Council, and its internal structure was reorganised and modernised, particular {{with the arrival of}} Tonkin, its first urban leader. The LCL renamed itself the South Australian Division of the Liberal Party of Australia to bring itself into line with its federal counterpart. Thus, many {{of the reasons for the}} LM's split had become null. Combined with the LM's declining membership (one third of members had not renewed) and its large debt, it found itself in a precarious position. Negotiations in 1976 began with the aim for the LM to merge into the new Liberal Party, and news of the secret talks were leaked in April. Once the news became public, Millhouse stated his complete opposition: [...] "I will not rejoin the Liberal Party ... I have meant what I said in the past and I do not see any change in the attitude of the Liberal Party to alter my view." [...] He said doing so would entail a surrender of honour and self-respect, and described the LM as the only [...] "genuine Liberal party" [...] in the nation, boldly predicting that its agenda would become dominant in society. Millhouse's stand was widely condemned by the media, who saw it as based on pride rather than pragmatism, and unhelpful for anti-Labor politics. Hall, however, wanted to unite the non-Labor forces, and acknowledged that [...] "there is no prospect of maintaining LM electorate groups... in simple terms, our alternatives are to swallow some little pride, and unite to fight Labor." [...] He said to do otherwise would be to [...] "exist in splendid selfish isolation", and said they could not survive as a relevant force by holding Goyder and Mitcham and losing upper house seats owing to a dwindling vote. Hall said the LM's reform agenda had been fulfilled, their finances were untenable and contended there was no ideological reason remaining for a split. This put him at increasing odds with Millhouse, who continued to describe the Liberals as [...] "very conservative". Some members of the Liberals were also wary of a merger, owing to the long-standing antipathy between the two groups, and persistent criticism of them from the LM over the years.|$|E
