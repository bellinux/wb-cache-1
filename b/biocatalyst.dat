Entrapment can be between lattices of polymer, known as gel entrapment, or within micro-cavities of synthetic fibers, known as fiber entrapment.

40|$|Metagenomics is a {{powerful}} cultivation-independent approach, which {{can be applied to}} gain access to the <b>biocatalysts</b> from uncultured marine microorganisms. Discovery of marine <b>biocatalysts</b> by this approach, in general, involves four main steps. First, a metagenomic library containing a pool of biocatalyst-encoding genes is constructed from a marine environment, which can be done by various methods, including cloning of enzymatically-digested DNA, uncut DNA, and PCR-amplified products. Second, the metagenomic library is screened for the genes of interest by employing the activity assay of expression product, in situ hybridization, or Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Third, the obtained target genes, both functional and phylogenetic genes, are sequenced and analysed by using bioinformatic tools in order to gain information on the functional and structural properties as well as the microbial sources of the encoded <b>biocatalysts.</b> Finally, the target genes are expressed in suitable microbial hosts, thereby producing the corresponding recombinant <b>biocatalysts.</b> All existing methods in engineering of marine <b>biocatalysts</b> for the performance improvement can be classified into two main strategies: (i) rational design and (ii) directed evolution.

50|$|Desulfobulbus propionicus {{can serve}} as a <b>biocatalyst</b> in {{microbial}} electrosynthesis. Microbial electrosynthesis is the usage of electrons by microorganism to reduce carbon dioxide to organic molecules. Desulfobulbus propionicus, when present at the anode, oxidizes elemental sulfur to sulfate, which creates free electrons in the process. The free electrons flow to the organism located at the cathode. The microbe present at the cathode utilizes the electron energy transferred from Desulfobulbus propionicus to create organic matter (e.g. acetate) by reducing carbon dioxide. The use of microbial electrosynthesis has potential to aid in the production and waste maintenance of industrial chemicals and energy production.|$|E

40|$|Microbial laccases are {{powerful}} enzymes capable of degrading lignin and other recalcitrant compounds including endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). Efficient EDC removal on an industrial scale requires robust, stable, {{easy to handle}} and cost-effective immobilized <b>biocatalysts.</b> In this direction, magnetic <b>biocatalysts</b> are attractive due to their easy separation through an external magnetic field. Recently, a bioinspired immobilization technique that mimics the natural biomineralization reactions in diatoms {{has emerged as a}} fast and versatile tool for generating robust, cheap, and highly stable (nano) <b>biocatalysts.</b> In this work, bioinspired formation of a biotitania matrix is triggered on the surface of magnetic particles in the presence of laccase in order to produce laccase-biotitania (lac-bioTiO 2) <b>biocatalysts</b> suitable for environmental applications using a novel, fast and versatile enzyme entrapment technique. Highly active lac-bioTiO 2 particles have been produced and the effect of different parameters (enzyme loading, titania precursor concentration, pH, duration of the biotitania formation, and laccase adsorption steps) on the apparent activity yield of these <b>biocatalysts</b> were evaluated, the concentration of the titania precursor being the most influential.

In relation to the second definition, synthetic organic or inorganic catalysts applied to accomplish a chemical transformation accomplished in nature by a <b>biocatalyst</b> (e.g., a purely proteinaceous catalyst, a metal or other cofactor bound to an enzyme, or a ribozyme) {{can be said to}} be accomplishing a biomimetic synthesis, where design and characterization of such catalytic systems has been termed biomimetic chemistry.|$|E
50|$|Merck’s process {{chemistry}} department contracted Codexis, a medium-sized biocatalysis firm, {{to develop a}} large-scale biocatalytic reductive amination for the final step of its sitagliptin synthesis. Codexis engineered a transaminase enzyme from the bacteria Arthrobacter through 11 rounds of directed evolution. The engineered transaminase contained 27 individual point mutations and displayed activity four orders of magnitude greater than the parent enzyme. Additionally, the enzyme was engineered to handle high substrate concentrations (100 g/L) and to tolerate the organic solvents, reagents and byproducts of the transamination reaction. This biocatalytic route successfully avoided {{the limitations of the}} chemocatalyzed hydrogenation route: the requirements to run the reaction under high pressure, to remove excess catalyst by carbon treatment and to recrystallize the product due to insufficient enantioselectivity were obviated by the use of a <b>biocatalyst.</b> Merck and Codexis were awarded the Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge Award in 2010 for the development of this biocatalytic route toward Januvia®.|$|E
50|$|Utilization of {{wastewater}} as {{a potential}} substrate for biohydrogen production has been drawing considerable interest in recent years especially in the dark fermentation process. Industrial wastewater as a fermentative substrate for H2 production addresses most of the criteria required for substrate selection viz., availability, cost and biodegradability (Angenent, et al., 2004; Kapdan and Kargi, 2006). Chemical wastewater (Venkata Mohan, et al., 2007a,b), cattle wastewater (Tang, et al., 2008), dairy process wastewater (Venkata Mohan, et al. 2007c, Rai et al. 2012), starch hydrolysate wastewater (Chen, et al., 2008) and designed synthetic wastewater (Venkata Mohan, et al., 2007a, 2008b) {{have been reported to}} produce biohydrogen apart from wastewater treatment from dark fermentation processes using selectively enriched mixed cultures under acidophilic conditions. Various wastewaters viz., paper mill wastewater (Idania, et al., 2005), starch effluent (Zhang, et al., 2003), food processing wastewater (Shin et al., 2004, van Ginkel, et al., 2005), domestic wastewater (Shin, et al., 2004, 2008e), rice winery wastewater (Yu et al., 2002), distillery and molasses based wastewater (Ren, et al., 2007, Venkata Mohan, et al., 2008a), wheat straw wastes (Fan, et al., 2006) and palm oil mill wastewater (Vijayaraghavan and Ahmed, 2006) have been studied as fermentable substrates for H2 production along with wastewater treatment. Using wastewater as a fermentable substrate facilitates both wastewater treatment apart from H2 production. The efficiency of the dark fermentative H2 production process was found to depend on pre-treatment of the mixed consortia used as a <b>biocatalyst,</b> operating pH, and organic loading rate apart from wastewater characteristics (Venkata Mohan, et al., 2007d, 2008c, d, Vijaya Bhaskar, et al., 2008d).|$|E
40|$|Enzymes are {{increasingly}} being used {{for the production of}} chiral compounds with high enantiomeric purity for the synthesis of fine chemicals and pharmaceuticals. Reason for this lies mainly in the high substrate and reaction specificity of many <b>biocatalysts.</b> Interesting starting compounds are often not or only slightly soluble in water. The employment of an organic solvent offers a convenient alternative to the aqueous system. Use of a gel-stabilized two-phase-system could avoid an inactivation of the sensitive <b>biocatalysts</b> by the solvent. The <b>biocatalysts</b> are protected in the hydrogel from the detrimental effects of the solvent which serves as a reservoir for the poor water soluble substrate. The conversion of hydrophobic substrates with immobilized <b>biocatalysts</b> could be shown by the example of the stereospecific reduction of p-bromo-acetophenone with the carbonyl reductase from candida parapsilosis (CPCR). The purified CPCR could be used in pure aqueous systems, aqueous-organic two-phase-systems and gel-stabilized two-phase-systems. The cofactor NADH + H+ is essential for the reduction of keto groups. To avoid stoichiometric amounts, regeneration of the cofactor is necessary and was investigated by a substrate-coupled mode with 2 -propanol and an enzyme-coupled mode with the formate dehydrogenase from candida boidinii (FDH). Both reactions were optimized. The <b>biocatalysts</b> could be immobilized successfully in polyvinyl alcohol beads and into a thermosensitive matrix, based on polyacrylamide.
