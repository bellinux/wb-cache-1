5|$|The ferry {{currently}} operates {{between a}} floating <b>boathouse</b> {{on the north}} bank of the Thames and a rudimentary jetty on the south bank. The <b>boathouse</b> is also in use as a private mooring for leisure craft. The ferry operates on all weekends, and weekdays between February and October. As well as the ferry service, rowboats, canoes and motorboats can also be hired from the <b>boathouse.</b>|$|E

50|$|When {{the palace}} was built, two <b>boathouses</b> were {{constructed}} {{on the rocky}} shore of Spinola Bay. The <b>boathouses</b> are rather plain, and have two arches leading to a wide open area. The <b>boathouses</b> are now restaurants, with {{the one on the}} left called San Giuliano and the one on the right called Raffael. Both restaurants are managed by San Giuliano Catering Ltd.|$|R
50|$|The <b>boathouses</b> {{are seen}} as centers of the rowing {{community}} around the United States. Rowers from the <b>boathouses</b> compete at every level, including local clubs, high schools, colleges, summer racing programs, and international-level athletics.|$|R

5|$|In 1940, University of Miami President Bowman Ashe {{recruited}} F.G. Walton Smith, a young British {{marine biologist}} {{who was working}} in the Bahamas. Smith joined the Department of Zoology, and began organizing the development of a marine laboratory. In 1943, the Board of Trustees of the University of Miami established the Marine Laboratory for the University. They invited researchers and oceanographers to associate themselves with this laboratory. Its three original objectives were teaching, basic research, and applied marine research. The laboratory focused on subjects specific to the tropical environment. Initially, the Marine Lab was located in a private <b>boathouse</b> on an estate on Belle Isle in Miami Beach, Florida. In 1945, when the <b>boathouse</b> became structurally unsafe, the lab moved to a converted apartment building in Coral Gables, Florida near the main campus.|$|E
5|$|John Cust, 1st Earl Brownlow, {{owner of}} Belton House from 1807–1853, {{commissioned}} the architect Anthony Salvin to undertake {{improvements to the}} Estate in 1838. Salvin's additions included a public house, estate cottages, a hermitage and the <b>boathouse.</b>|$|E

5|$|On 23 August 1994, in a <b>boathouse</b> on the Scottish {{island of}} Jura, Drummond and Cauty incinerated £1,000,000 in cash. The burning was {{witnessed}} {{by an old}} friend of Drummond's, freelance journalist Jim Reid, who subsequently wrote an article about the ceremony for The Observer. It was filmed on Super 8 by their friend Gimpo.|$|E
5|$|The camp {{still stands}} today, with his cabin, a guest cabin, a chickee shelter, docks, a <b>boathouse,</b> and {{assorted}} cages from his zoo. There are also fruit trees that he planted, including surinam cherry, Java plum and wild almond.|$|E
5|$|Today, a CSX Corporation {{railroad}} bridge {{runs through}} the site of Fort Jackson, and the Potomac shoreline {{just south of the}} bridge is being studied by the National Park Service as one possible site for an Arlington County <b>boathouse.</b> Just south of the federal George Washington Memorial Parkway, between the CSX tracks and I-395, is Arlington County's Long Bridge Park. The northern end of the park, not yet developed for recreational use, may include part of the site of Fort Jackson. A National Park Service study commissioned during the ongoing review of potential <b>boathouse</b> sites included an observation that historical artifacts from Fort Jackson may still be present at the site.|$|E

5|$|K Foundation Burn a Million Quid was {{an action}} on 23 August 1994 {{in which the}} K Foundation (an art duo {{consisting}} of Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty) burned cash {{in the amount of}} one million pounds sterling in a disused <b>boathouse</b> on the Ardfin Estate on the Scottish island of Jura. The money represented the bulk of the K Foundation's funds, earned by Drummond and Cauty as The KLF, one of the United Kingdom's most successful pop groups of the early 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Later {{structures}} that break the classical theme include the Gothic style <b>boathouse,</b> a Gothic Alcove – now a romantic ruin hidden amongst undergrowth – and a Gothic Chapel, once {{home of the}} village cobbler (and facetiously named St Crispin's) but later used as the estate kennels. A monument dedicated to Queen Elizabeth II was erected on her 60th birthday in 1986.|$|E
5|$|The suburb was {{originally}} three low lying islands that {{were covered in}} shell grit and saltbush and surrounded by mangrove and samphire swamps. Fishermen had established huts on the islands by 1865 and by 1873 there were 13 huts and a <b>boathouse</b> recorded when the area was surveyed by Thomas Evans. By the 1890s people were visiting the islands attracted to the supposed curative properties of the mangrove mud, using the beach for bathing and fishing for crabs.|$|E

5|$|The university's most {{competitive}} programs include track and field, which claims world record holder and Olympic gold medalist Tom Courtney as an alumnus; sailing, which is headquartered at the Morris Yacht and Beach Club in City Island, Bronx; crew, which rows {{out of the}} Peter Jay Sharp <b>Boathouse</b> on the Harlem River and frequents the Henley Royal Regatta in the United Kingdom; and golf, which is affiliated with the Winged Foot Golf Club in Mamaroneck, New York.|$|E
5|$|Although Carmarthenshire is less frequented as {{a tourist}} {{destination}} than some other counties in Wales, it offers {{a wide range of}} outdoor activities. Much of the coast is fairly flat; it includes the Millennium Coastal Park, which extends for ten miles to the west of Llanelli; the National Wetlands Centre; a championship golf course; and the harbours of Burry Port and Pembrey. Further west are the sandy beaches at Llansteffan and Pendine, and Dylan Thomas' <b>boathouse</b> at Laugharne. Further inland {{there are a number of}} medieval castles, hillforts and standing stones.|$|E
5|$|Andrew Crosse {{conducted}} {{a series of}} experiments with electricity, including the development of large voltaic piles, at the house during his ownership in the early 19th century. The main building of Fyne Court burnt down in 1894. The buildings which survived the fire have been used as offices and a visitor centre by organisations such as the Somerset Wildlife Trust and Quantock Hills AONB Service since it came into the ownership of the National Trust in 1967. It is surrounded by a large country estate of woodland, ponds and meadows. Within the grounds are a folly and <b>boathouse.</b>|$|E

5|$|By 1795, the {{original}} Bridgewater Canal from Worsley to Manchester had proved an economic success, prompting its owner, Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater, to seek powers to extend it route to Leigh via Astley. The Duke's plans were approved, despite {{opposition from the}} local population. Canal traffic brought trade to Astley Green where the Hope and Anchor Inn (now the <b>Boathouse)</b> was built with stabling for horses that pulled the barges. The original canal bridge built to connect Lower and Higher Green lasted until 1904, when it was replaced. The second bridge was replaced in 1920 by an iron bridge, which could be raised to counter the effects of mining subsidence. A boatyard was established by Lingards Bridge.|$|E
5|$|Caspersen {{supported}} rowing, and {{was involved}} with the Princeton National Rowing Association (PNRA) and Princeton International Regatta Association (PIRA). In 1998, he provided funding to build a <b>boathouse</b> to benefit the rowing programs of Peddie and the nearby Lawrenceville School {{on the north shore}} of Mercer Lake in West Windsor, New Jersey. Located at the Mercer Lake Race Course—site of the 1988, 1992, 2004 and 2008 United States Olympic Rowing Team Trials—the facility is used for training, racing, camps, clinics and administration by Peddie, Lawrenceville, the Hun School, high schools in Mercer County, New Jersey, USRowing, the US National Team, and the Mercer Junior Rowing Club, as well as PNRA and PIRA.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{navigation}} being closed, {{a guide to}} Midhurst published in 1895 advertised that skiffs could be hired, and fishing could be enjoyed. The boats were hired out by a plumber called William Port, and his business continued to prosper until 1912, when his <b>boathouse</b> burned down. Rowing boats were also available for hire at Coultershaw and Fittleworth. Another book called A New Oarsman's Guide, published in 1896, suggested that the river could be canoed from Iping to the Arun, a distance of , when there was sufficient water. By that time, none of the locks were workable, and boats had to be carried around them.|$|E
50|$|There {{used to be}} ornate wooden barges on {{the river}} bank here at the {{southern}} end of Christ Church Meadow to house rowing facilities and for viewing races. Now the barges are gone and there are <b>boathouses</b> instead a little further down the river near the confluence with the River Cherwell. Poplar Walk in Christ Church Meadow is used as a route to and from the <b>boathouses.</b>|$|R
