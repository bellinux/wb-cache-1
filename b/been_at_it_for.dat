This is required to retain the efficiency of the trigger at increased event rates despite its fixed bandwidth. The focus lies on the early digitization and finer segmentation of the data provided to the trigger. Furthermore, there is the possibility to implement new energy reconstruction algorithms which are adapted to the specific requirements of the trigger. In order to constitute crucial design decisions, such as the digitization scale or the choice of digital signal processing algorithms, comprehensive simulations are required. High trigger efficiencies <b>are</b> decisive <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> the successful continuation of the measurements of rare StandardModel processes as well as for a high sensitivity to new physics beyond the established theories. It can be shown that a significantly improved resolution of the missing transverse energy calculated by the trigger is achievable due to the revised segmentation of the data. Various energy reconstruction algorithms are investigated in detail. It can be concluded that these will facilitate reliable trigger decisions for all expected working conditions and for the whole possible energy range...|$|R

People with bipolar disorder, or those who <b>are</b> <b>at</b> risk <b>for</b> <b>it,</b> also set higher goals in laboratory tasks than other people. The work reported here examines whether persons vulnerable to mania set elevated goals in their lives. In two studies, a measure of lifetime vulnerability to mania was related to traits bearing on incentive sensitivity, and also to endorsement of high ambitions for fame, wealth, and political influence (assessed by a new measure). Relations were weaker to ambitions for other kinds of extreme goals. The effects were independent of current symptoms of mania and depression and lifetime depression. There was also evidence that incentive sensitivity and elevated aspirations made independent contributions to variance in the measure of manic risk. Discussion focuses on the implications of high goal setting for understanding goal dysregulation and mania...|$|R

40|$|Since 1987, in Kenya, {{through the}} National Housing Corporation (NHC), {{an arm of}} the central {{government}} that delivers affordable houses, the local government embarked on the redevelopment of Pumwani the oldest surviving affordable low income housing in Nairobi. Pumwani was started in 1923 and it targeted early African immigrants to Nairobi. Currently, the old Pumwani is home to some of the city’s poorest dwellers majorities who depend on the informal sector for an income. Redevelopment <b>was</b> targeted <b>at</b> housing all the genuine dwellers. Instead delivery ended up with house types that <b>were</b> <b>at</b> first rejected by the beneficiaries. Although the new housing was slightly of an improved physical and spatial quality it was unaffordable. Beneficiaries were required to pay an average monthly rent of US$ 157 for up to eighteen years towards purchase of the new house. In the beginning, some of them had declined to take position of the newly built houses. To raise the basic rent majorities of those who have since moved in have opted to rent out some of the space. To date there is still standoff with some of the houses still unoccupied. Except during the period of social survey when the beneficiaries were brought in to supply the necessary information, the entire construction process was undertaken by NHC under a turnkey project. Among other factors the construction process <b>was</b> <b>at</b> fault <b>for</b> <b>it</b> raised the costs. Also, some of the basic housing needs were not effectively looked into.

40|$|The nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) {{family of}} {{transcription}} factors play {{a pivotal role}} in the inflammatory and immune responses, as well as cell growth and survival. Since its discovery 25 years ago, NF-kappaB has {{emerged as one of the}} most intensely studied eukaryotic transcription factors, due to its pleiotropic functions and its inducible pattern of expression that is subject to multi-level regulation. Many modulatory events affect NF-kappaB function and thus to have a better understanding of the NF-kappaB pathway and its gene regulation will require additional studies of NF-kappaB's modulators. The goal of this thesis was to investigate the role of intra- and extra-cellular modulators of NF-kappaB. To study how intracellular modulators affect NF-kappaB function, various genetic and biochemical approaches were used to identify potentially new NF-kappaB's interacting proteins. Two AGC family kinases, STK 38 and STK 38 L, were chosen for further study. These two proteins were found to not only interact with NF-kappaB's p 65 subunit but also act as its kinases in vitro. shRNA mediated knockdown combined with gene expression analysis revealed that STK 38 and STK 38 L via their kinase function regulated p 65 activity on some, but not all NF-kappaB-responsive inflammatory genes in response to TNFa stimulation. To study the role of extracellular modulators on the apoptotic behaviors of cells, a panel of human immortalized and cancer liver cell lines were pre-treated with pro-inflammatory cytokines TNFa and IL- 1 a followed by TRAIL, a potent inducer of cell death. This context-dependent approach revealed that TNFa and IL- 1 a had diverse effects on cell death behaviors and inhibiting the NF-kappaB pathway was enough to block pro-inflammatory cytokines-mediated pro-death or pro-survival outcomes. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high throughput sequencing, realtime PCR and Western blotting were used to identify NF-kappaB's target genes involved in the cell death pathway. From these data, new regulatory mechanisms that affect cell death behaviors were proposed. Dysregulation of NF-kappaB activation has been implicated in various pathologies including inflammatory diseases and cancer. The results described here represent progress toward understanding the NF-kB pathway and its gene regulation program.

40|$|A {{standard}} platitude {{about the}} function of causal knowledge or theories {{is that they are}} valuable because they support prediction, explanation, and control. Knowledge of predator-prey relations enables us to predict future animal populations, as well as design policies or interventions that help influence those populations. If we understand the underlying biochemical mechanisms of some disease, then we can predict who <b>is</b> <b>at</b> risk <b>for</b> <b>it,</b> explain why it produces particular symptoms, and develop interventions to try to reduce its prevalence or the symptom severity. Of course, there are many situations in which one has, for practical reasons, only some of these desiderata; for example, control might be infeasible for technical or ethical reasons. But these remain, for many researchers, the ideal for why causal knowledge is a valuable end of scientific inquiry, including biological inquiry. There are, however, certain types of systems—in particular, chaotic systems—in which it appears that these ends are unattainable, and these systems appear to be widespread in the biological domain, broadly construed (e. g., Benincà et al., 2008; Cushing, Costantino, Dennis, Desharnais, 2 ̆ 6 Henson, 2003; Guastello, Koopmans, 2 ̆ 6 Pincus, 2009; Hastings 2 ̆ 6 Powell, 1991; Skarda 2 ̆ 6 Freeman, 1987; Tsuda, 2001). In this paper, we will show why it is natural to think that causal models of chaotic systems cannot satisfy any of the three functions. But we will also show why this natural thought is wrong: we can have usable causal knowledge about even chaotic systems. Moreover, the ways in which we can have such knowledge lead us naturally to rethink a standard understanding of how causal learning and modeling proceed. In particular, just as we often must find the appropriate variables for a causal system, we also must determine the proper level or granularity of description for the dynamics of that system...|$|R
40|$|An {{economy in}} {{transition}} needs solutions. The affirming shift towards a lower carbon economy today presents major challenges, in particular to industry since the balance between competitiveness and responsibility <b>is</b> <b>at</b> risk. <b>It</b> urges <b>for</b> efficiencies, of resources, enery, waste; to close loops; to ponder activities that cross borders and cluster efforts. Hence economies of scope and scale are reinforced, chaining and pooling products, facilities, services. The challenge is indeed to see business clustering as a driver of opportunities, to seize and exploit any form of industrial symbiosis. Long before it had a name, the sharing economy first saw the light. It grew organically, starting from a wish, a need or a duty to collaborate. B 2 B (1 to 1) as well as network (1 to M) deals originated from the technical or spatial proximity of down- or upstream business potential, creating economic wins, in a conventional legal framework. Adding the sustainability principle to this LEST concept, however, requires a strong social and environmental dimension; a win for society, built on corporate responsibility. Such win-win situations focus eg on reuse of waste streams, optimisation of processes and resources, energy efficiency and recovery, new technologies to reduce footprints, involvement of localities, etc. District heating networks, using industrial waste heat to supply local communities or feed neigbouring companies at a business park, are typical examples of industrial symbiosis with society or industry as a privileged partner. Whether as eco-industrial park, business improvement district or multi-stakeholder cooperative, the symbiosis thus created needs a strong management structure and full partnership agreement {{in order to be}} succesful; to value the concepts of coopetition and co-option, to counter free rider behaviour, to seek competitive advantage while taking responsible care. In this talk the drivers and pittfalls of cluster activities are discussed, based on 15 years of experience in applied multidisciplinary research. The presented examples of business clustering set off this session on industrial symbiosis...|$|R
