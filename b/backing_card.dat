50|$|The Card Bet: (as {{shown in}} the Korean version) Two playing cards placed in a bag. One is the Joker. The other is a double <b>backed</b> <b>card</b> with no face. A person must reach into the bag, {{retrieve}} a card and place on the table face down. Then the card is flipped. If it is the face card one person wins, {{if it is the}} double <b>backed</b> <b>card,</b> the other person wins. You let your opponent to choose light or dark for their card choice. You let your opponent remove and flip the card each and every time. You point out that if the face up card is placed directly on the table before it is flipped then the result is already known and therefore is invalid and does not count for either person. First person to 7 wins.How to win the Card Bet:This game gives the illusion of a 50/50 chance for both players. However, the double <b>backed</b> <b>card</b> will win 66% of the time. Therefore, the trick is to force your opponent to choose the face cards as their winning card to put the odds in your favor.Offer your opponent to choose between the light or dark card. If they say light, tell them they have chosen the face up cards. If they choose dark, tell them they have chosen the dark, shifty Joker to represent them and you will have the light blue <b>backed</b> <b>cards.</b> Thus irrespective of their decision you force them to choose the Joker. If your opponents card is drawn, half the time it will be face up and will automatically be deemed voided. If your card is drawn, it will always be flipped and yield a win for you. Your card will never be voided. Ultimately you almost certainly must win.|$|R
5000|$|The front lid {{contains}} two, four, or six tabs to {{keep any}} liner notes in place. The liner notes typically {{will be a}} 120 × 120 mm booklet, or a single 242 × 120 mm leaf folded in half. In addition, there is usually a <b>back</b> <b>card,</b> 150 × 118 mm, underneath the media tray and visible through the clear back, often listing the track names, studio, copyright data and other information. The <b>back</b> <b>card</b> is folded into a flattened [...] "U" [...] shape, with the sides being visible along the ends (often {{referred to as the}} spine) of the case. The ends usually have the name of the release and the artist, and often label or catalogue information printed on them, and are designed to be visible when the case is stored vertically, 'book-style', on shelves.|$|R

50|$|Humphry is the {{spelling}} Ozias himself {{used in his}} signature on the <b>backing</b> <b>card</b> of his miniature of Charlotte, Princess Royal (1769; Windsor Castle). This is also {{the spelling}} given in the catalogues of the annual exhibitions of the Royal Academy from 1779 to 1795. The different spelling in the far more common form of Humphrey may originally well {{be due to a}} mistake but was already in use during his own lifetime. It appears thus in the Royal Academy catalogues for the years 1796 and 1797 {{as well as in the}} writings of Horace Walpole and John Thomas Smith. Humphry is the generally used spelling today.|$|E
5000|$|Later, toy maker Cragstan {{wanted a}} piece of the diecast market that Corgi and Dinky had {{captured}} and enlisted Gamda Koor models for its international (and specifically American) sales. These models also used the garage door box, but often with a patriotic red, white and blue color scheme on the <b>backing</b> <b>card</b> and {{down the side of the}} box. Cragstan called its Sabra Super Cars, [...] "Detroit Seniors". The Cragstan and Detroit Senior names were also molded into the plastic chrome bases of these cars. There were few differences between Sabra and Cragstan castings. One could be seen on the Chevelle wagon. The Chevrolet bow tie was shown on the sides behind the front wheel well, but on the Cragstan version it is missing. The Cragstan cars went for $1.49 in the US market, but did not bear the standard Israeli police, army and post symbols (Bickford 2013).|$|E
50|$|A {{consignment}} of Friendly Floatee toys, {{manufactured in}} China for The First Years Inc., departed from Hong Kong {{on a container}} ship, the Ever Laurel, destined for Tacoma, Washington, U.S. On 10 January 1992, during a storm in the North Pacific Ocean close to the International Date Line, twelve 40-foot (13.3 m) intermodal containers were washed overboard. One of these containers held 28,800 Floatees, a child's bath toy which came {{in a number of}} forms: red beavers, green frogs, blue turtles and yellow ducks. At some point, the container opened (possibly due to collision with other containers or the ship itself) and the Floatees were released. Although each toy was mounted in a plastic housing attached to a <b>backing</b> <b>card,</b> subsequent tests showed that the cardboard quickly degraded in sea water allowing the Floatees to escape. Unlike many bath toys, Friendly Floatees have no holes in them so they do not take on water.|$|E

50|$|The {{purpose of}} the crossbelt pouch was so that an officer or senior rank could post an {{important}} message into the courier's pouch, by unhooking the leather tab, inserting the note, then securing the flap, in the briefest possible time. The courier would then ride off at speed to deliver it. In some bands - a tradition still held by the bands of the footguards, larger pouches were used to store march cards (cards measuring approximately 180 mm × 130 mm on which the individual instrumental sheet-music parts are pasted). The march cards are held, to enable the player to read his part, in a heavy duty clip (known as a 'lyre') which is attached to his instrument. At {{the back of the}} lyre, but facing forward, is placed the 'backing card', to hide the music from the view of the public. The <b>backing</b> <b>card</b> normally shows the 'cap badge' of the regiment or corps.|$|E

40|$|J. W. Lindt’s Colonial man and Aborigine {{image from}} the GRAFTON ALBUM: “On {{chemistry}} and optics all does not depend, art must with these in triple union blend” (text from J. W. Lindt’s photographic <b>backing</b> <b>card)</b> In this paper, I follow an argument that Lindt held a position in his particular colonial environment where he was simultaneously both an insider and an outsider and that such a position may be considered prerequisite in stimulating exchange. A study of the transition of J. W. Lindt in Grafton, N. S. W. in the 1860 s from a traveller to a migrant and subsequently to a professional photographer, as well as Lindt’s photographic career, which evolved through strategic action and technical approaches to photography, bears witness to his cultural relativity. One untitled photograph from this period of work constructs a unique commentary of Australian colonial life that illustrates a non-hegemonic position, particularly as it was included {{in one of the}} first albums of photographs of Aborigines that Lindt gifted to an illustrious person (in this case the Mayor of Grafton). As in his other studio constructions, props and backdrops were arranged and sitters were positioned with care, but this photograph is {{the only one in the}} album that includes a non-Aborigine in a relationship to an Aborigine. An analysis of the props, technical details of the album and the image suggests a reconciliatory aspect that thwarts the predominant attitudes towards Aborigines in the area at that time...|$|E

5000|$|Historically, {{the first}} {{attempts}} to mark playing cards involved bends, crimps and tiny pinprick bumps known as [...] "blisters", resembling the Braille script. Later, {{when the first}} designs appeared on the <b>backs</b> of playing <b>cards,</b> cheats began altering the designs on the <b>backs</b> of <b>cards.</b> Hustlers have used various inks, pigments and scratches, to add or remove lines or patterns from the <b>back</b> of the <b>card</b> design.

50|$|In New France, {{playing cards}} were issued {{as a method}} of payment in the 1680s by the Intendant of New France, in {{addition}} to the coins introduced in the 1660s. However, the massive drain of wealth from New France to Europe resulting from mercantilist trade policies made it impossible to <b>back</b> <b>card</b> money with gold bullion. Card money was thus essentially worthless. The card system collapsed in the 1690s, causing long-term suspicion of paper money {{on the part of the}} French settlers.|$|R
