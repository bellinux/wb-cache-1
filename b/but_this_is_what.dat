500|$|Approximately {{ten days}} after the forced {{abortion}} occurred, the Shaanxi Provincial Population and Family Planning Commission launched an investigation. [...] On June 13, Yu Yanmei, the deputy head of Ankang, visited the Deng household. [...] Two days later, the commission concluded that Feng had indeed been forced into an illegal abortion, writing, [...] "Such practice has seriously violated the relevant policies... harmed the image of our family planning work, and caused extremely poor effects in society." [...] Three officials, including {{the head of the}} local family-planning department, were suspended from their jobs on June 14. An employee of the Ankang Family Planning Bureau said that [...] "grass-roots comrades aren't stupid, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> they're forced to do... This is a problem with the entire system." ...|$|E
2500|$|Protesters' {{statements}} and actions during the rioting led Butman to say, [...] "We were always hoping that after World War II no Jew {{would ever be}} killed just for being Jewish, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> happened {{in the city of}} New York." [...] In his eulogy at the funeral, the Rev. Al Sharpton made comments about [...] "diamond dealers" [...] and commented [...] "It's an accident to allow an apartheid ambulance service in the middle of Crown Heights." [...] In addition, a banner displayed at the funeral read [...] "Hitler did not do the job".|$|E
2500|$|Metrolink {{spokeswoman}} Denise Tyrrell disclosed the {{day after}} the crash that a preliminary investigation of dispatch records and computers showed the engineer of the Metrolink passenger train failed to stop his train for a red railway signal, which indicated his train did not have authority to proceed on the main track [...] She was quoted as saying, [...] "We don't know how the error happened, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> we believe happened. We believe it was our engineer who failed to stop at the signal." [...] Tyrrell said that if the engineer had obeyed the signal, the accident would not have occurred. However Los Angeles County Supervisor and Metrolink board member Don Knabe said it was premature to blame the engineer, speculating that [...] "there could always be a technical malfunction where... there was a green light both ways." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{million is}} more than the leaves on all the trees in these openings"--le Bourdon's notions were a little exaggerated, perhaps, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> he SAID--"yes, more than the leaves on all these oaks, far and near. A million is a countless number, and I suppose would make a row of men as long as from this spot to the shores of the great salt lake, if not farther." ...|$|R
60|$|It never {{occurred}} to the good-natured monarch that such a name was certain to call down the hatred and jealousy of the fairies in a body on the child, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> happened. No sooner had they heard of this presumptuous name than they resolved to gain possession of her who bore it, and either to torment her cruelly, {{or at least to}} conceal her from the eyes of all men.|$|R
60|$|Matt Hilary {{learned from}} his father {{the result of the}} conference with the State's attorney, and he came up to Hatboro' the next day, to see Putney on his father's behalf, and to express the wish of his family that Mr. Putney would let them do {{anything}} he could think of for his clients. He got his message out bunglingly, with embarrassed circumlocution and repetition; <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> it came to in the end.|$|R
60|$|How much of {{what follows}} I said to de Tessin at the time I do not clearly remember, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> I had in mind.|$|E
60|$|We murmured that it {{was very}} {{astonishing}} and very gratifying, or something to that effect. I don't think we knew what it was either, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> our politeness expressed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Keep that," [...] said Holmes, quietly {{putting his}} foot upon it; [...] "you {{will find it}} useful at the trial. <b>But</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> we really wanted." [...] He held up a little {{crumpled}} piece of paper.|$|E
6000|$|<b>But</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> not <b>what</b> Mr. Wharton desired. [...] "I shouldn't like that, my dear. Of {{course he}} would {{know that you were}} in the house." ...|$|R
6000|$|The Baroness hoped so, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> not <b>what</b> she said. [...] "They {{are very}} pretty," [...] she said, [...] "but they are mere little girls. Where are the women--the women of thirty?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't mean only to-day, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> only <b>what</b> he {{had made}} up his mind to. He never expects to leave Belforest, and he thinks—-oh, Jock!-—he thinks it is meant to do Bobus good." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Reading {{over what}} I have written, I find I have not nearly done justice {{to my own}} sense of the genius and moral energy of the book; <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> you will best excuse.--Believe me most {{sincerely}} and faithfully yours, ...|$|E
6000|$|He wandered {{home and}} found his wife radiant with the horified {{interest}} {{we have in the}} tragedies of our friends. [...] "Of course Paul isn't altogether to blame, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> comes of his chasing after other women instead of bearing his cross in a Christian way," [...] she exulted.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is quite}} true that I {{might be a}} wiser person, Celia," [...] said Dorothea, [...] "and that I might have done {{something}} better, if I had been better. <b>But</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> I am going to do. I have promised to marry Mr. Ladislaw; and I am going to marry him." ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>But</b> now, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> the LORD says— he {{who created}} you, O Jacob, he who formed you, O Israel: [...] "Fear not, for I have {{redeemed}} you; I have summoned you by name; you are mine.|$|R
60|$|Linda? Wild horses {{could not}} drag from her {{anything}} {{that she thought}} would harm me. So intense is her fidelity that it almost shames me. I do not deserve it. <b>But</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> not <b>what</b> I came to you about.|$|R
6000|$|... "No; {{they say}} only some white {{officers}}, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> foolishness. <b>What</b> could white officers do without soldiers? As for the Fantis they are cowards, {{they are only}} good to carry burdens and to hoe the ground. They are women and not men." ...|$|R
6000|$|... '"Aha! You see," [...] he said, crowing, as it were, over me placidly. [...] "Only," [...] he went on, [...] "you {{just try}} to tell this {{to any of them}} here. They would think you a fool, a liar, or worse. And so I can stand it. I've done a thing or two for them, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> they have done for me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I don't know anythin' 'bout that business; <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> I {{was kind}} er figgerin' on. It costs terrible {{to get a}} doctor, of course; but don't you s'pose we might make the same trade with one that we did with the lawyer? If we'd 'gree {{to give him a}} paper, an' black his boots, till the bill was paid, I don't reckon it would take long to fix Ikey in great shape." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'There,' began Mr. Edmonstone, 'you {{may tell}} Amy she may give him up, and a lucky escape she has had. <b>But</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> comes of {{settling}} matters in my absence.' So he proceeded with the narration, mixing the facts undistinguishably {{with his own}} surmises, and overwhelming his wife with dismay. If a quarter of this was true, defence of Guy {{was out of the}} question; and it was still more impossible to wish Amy's attachment to him to continue; and though much was incredible, it was no time to say so. She could only hope morning would soften her husband's anger, and make matters explicable.|$|E
60|$|He {{spoke at}} an opportune moment. Since her {{cherished}} ambition had failed her, Hetty Torrance had grown a trifle {{tired of the}} city and the round of pleasure that must be entered into strenuously, and there were times when, looking back in reverie, she saw the great silent prairie roll back under the red sunrise into the east, and fade, vast, solemn, and restful, a cool land of shadow, when the first pale stars came out. Then she longed for the jingle of the bridles and the drumming of the hoofs, and felt once more the rush of the gallop stir her blood. <b>But</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> she would not show, and her eyes twinkled a trifle maliciously.|$|R
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> exactly <b>what</b> the Nicene Creed {{does not}} do. It {{does not say}} that the Holy Spirit is life: but that He is the Lord and Giver of life--a {{seemingly}} small difference in words: but a most vast and important difference in meaning and in truth.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{you were}} not vexed with me for anything? I have been afraid that I--that you--" [...] Staniford {{found that he was}} himself getting short of breath. He had begun with the {{intention}} of mystifying her, but matters had suddenly taken another course, and he was really anxious to know whether any disagreeable associations with that night lingered in her mind. With this longing came a natural inability to find the right word. [...] "I was afraid--" [...] he repeated, and then he stopped again. Clearly, he could not tell her that he was afraid he had gone too far; <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> he meant. [...] "You don't walk with me, any more, Miss Blood," [...] he concluded, with an air of burlesque reproach.|$|R
60|$|My sensations {{are worth}} noting. For the moment I felt {{precisely}} as I had when I {{was hit by}} that bullet in Lauman's charge. I was aware of something very like pain, yet I could not place the cause of it. <b>But</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> since has made me feel queer: you doubtless remember staying at Hollingdean, when I was a boy, and hearing the story of Lord Northwell's daredevil Royalist ancestor,--the one with the lace collar over the dull-gold velvet, and the pointed chin, and the lazy scorn in the eyes. Those eyes are painted with drooping lids. The first time I saw Clarence Colfax I thought of that picture--and now I thought of the picture first.|$|E
6000|$|Miss Crawford blundered most towards Fanny {{herself in}} her {{intentions}} to please. She meant to be giving her little heart a happy flutter, and filling her with sensations of delightful self-consequence; and, misinterpreting Fanny's blushes, still thought she must be doing so {{when she went to}} her after the two first dances, and said, with a significant look, [...] "Perhaps you can tell me why my brother goes to town to-morrow? He says he has business there, but will not tell me what. The first time he ever denied me his confidence! <b>But</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> we all come to. All are supplanted sooner or later. Now, I must apply to you for information. Pray, what is Henry going for?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I tell you, once again,' he said, 'they can't hurt you. You {{shall have}} an action for false imprisonment, {{and make a}} profit of this, yet. We will devise a story for you that should carry you through twenty times such a trivial scrape as this; {{and if they want}} {{security}} in a thousand pounds for your reappearance in case you should be called upon, you shall have it. All you have to do is, to keep back the truth. You're a little fuddled tonight, and {{may not be able to}} see this as clearly as you would at another time; <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> you must do, and you'll need all your senses about you; for a slip might be awkward.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I can't," [...] Marcia broke in. [...] "I mustn't be {{away when}} Bartley gets back." [...] The thought was {{something}} definite {{in the sea}} of uncertainty on which she was cast away; she never afterwards lost her hold of it; she confirmed herself in it by other inventions; she pretended that he had told her where he was going, and then that he had written to her. She almost believed these childish fictions as she uttered them. At the same time, in all her longing for his return, she had a sickening fear that when he came back he would keep his parting threat and drive her away: she did not know how he could do it, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> she feared.|$|R
5000|$|The {{concept of}} culture, {{like any other}} piece of knowledge, can be abused and misinterpreted. Some fear that the {{principle}} of cultural relativity will weaken morality. [...] "If the Bugabuga do it why can't we? It's all relative anyway." [...] <b>But</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> exactly <b>what</b> cultural relativity does not mean.|$|R
60|$|In {{the course}} of his married life March had learned not to censure the irretrievable; <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> just <b>what</b> his wife had not learned; and she poured out so much astonishment at what Fulkerson had done, and so much disapproval, that March began to {{palliate}} the situation a little.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] says Alan, [...] "I wish {{he was a}} man of more penetration, for by my troth I {{am afraid}} he will make little enough of it! <b>But</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> I have in my mind. This cross is {{something}} in the nature of the crosstarrie, or fiery cross, which is the signal of gathering in our clans; yet he will know well enough the clan is not to rise, for there it is standing in his window, and no word with it. So he will say to himsel', The clan is not to rise, but there is something. Then he will see my button, and that was Duncan Stewart's. And then he will say to himsel', The son of Duncan is in the heather, and has need of me." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{had been}} led to expect at the [...] "Well," [...] a {{pastoral}} scene, wild flowers, flocks and flowing waters; so I looked with a jaundiced eye upon a deep hole full of slightly brackish water dug in a tamped hollow-a kind of punch-bowl with granite walls, upon whose grim surface a few thorns of exceeding hardihood braved the sun for a season. Not a house was in sight-it was as barren and desolate a spot as the sun ever [...] "viewed in his wide career." [...] <b>But</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> the Arabian traveller must expect. He is to traverse, for instance, the Wady Al-Ward-the Vale of Flowers. He indulges in sweet recollections of Indian lakes beautiful with the Lotus, and Persian plains upon which Narcissus is the meanest of grasses. He sees a plain like swish-work, where knobs of granite act daisies; and where, at every fifty yards, some hapless bud or blossom is dying of inanition among the stones.|$|E
6000|$|A {{course of}} action for the liberals, {{moderate}} but substantial, has [...] been sketched. The party in general have accepted it. After the [...] late conversations, {{there is no reason}} to anticipate a breach upon [...] any of the conditions laid down anywhere for immediate adoption, [...] between the less advanced and the more advanced among the leaders. [...] It must occupy several years, and it may occupy the whole [...] parliament. According to your view they will, unless on a single [...] condition [i.e. Mr. Gladstone’s leadership], refuse to combine [...] in a cabinet, and to act, with a majority at their back; and will [...] make over the business voluntarily to the tories in a minority, at [...] the commencement of a parliament. Why? They agree on the subjects [...] before them. Other subjects, unknown as yet, may arise to split [...] them. <b>But</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> may happen to any government, and it can [...] form no reason.|$|E
6000|$|He stopped, and Herries said, [...] "Yes, of course! <b>But</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> not {{altogether}} <b>what</b> we mean. Do you think Dearham {{would take the}} post?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Producer H. Galen Walker {{said in an}} interview: [...] "There's {{about seven}} or eight {{additional}} scenes in the Japanese version that we cut out in the U.S.—one, just for timing, and just for pace of story. That was the big issue. I'm sure Mr. Kawajiri was really unhappy about the cut, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> the other producers thought was best for everybody." [...] An opening exposition text-sequence, which is traditional for Highlander films, was also added for the American version. Walker said that Kawajiri's original cut [...] "will probably <b>be</b> out later <b>this</b> year," [...] in an interview conducted in June 2007. More than a year later, the director's cut was finally released in Japan on December 5, 2008 with the running time of 95 minutes (10 minutes longer than the U.S. version).|$|R
6000|$|... "My {{dear old}} partner of joys and sorrows," [...] said Archie, wounded, [...] "we court criticism, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> mere abuse. <b>What</b> seems to <b>be</b> the difficulty?" ...|$|R
