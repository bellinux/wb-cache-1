However, ray-traced solutions for hemispherical occlusion require many rays per shading point (typically 256 - 1024) due to the full hemispherical angular domain. Moreover, each ray can be expensive in scenes with moderate to high geometric complexity. However, many nearby rays sample similar areas, and the final occlusion result is often low frequency. We give a frequency analysis of shadow light fields using distant illumination with a general BRDF and normal mapping, allowing us to share ray information even among complex receivers.

This paper examines the prospects for the detectability of such gamma ray halos. We explore a broad range of astrophysical parameters, including the inhomogeneous distribution of magnetic fields in the large scale structure as well as various possible chemical compositions and injection spectra; and we consider the case of a source located outside clusters of galaxies. With respect to the gamma-ray flux associated to synchrotron radiation of ultra-high energy secondary pairs, we demonstrate that it does not depend strongly on these parameters and conclude that its magnitude ultimately depends on the energy injected in the primary cosmic <b>rays.</b> <b>Bounding</b> the cosmic <b>ray</b> luminosity with the contribution to the measured cosmic ray spectrum, we then find that the gamma-ray halo produced by equal luminosity sources is well below current or planned instrument sensitivities. Only rare and powerful steady sources, located at distances larger than several hundreds of Mpc and contributing to a fraction > 10 % of the flux at 10 ^ 19 eV might be detectable. We also discuss the gamma-ray halos that are produced by inverse Compton/pair production cascades seeded by ultra-high energy cosmic rays.

Observed AGN-induced cavities/bubbles are a leading candidate for suppressing cooling, usually via some form of mechanical heating. At the same time, observed X-ray cavities and synchrotron emission point toward a significant non-thermal particle population. Previous {{studies have focused on}} the dynamical effects of cosmic-ray pressure support, but none have built successful models in which cosmic-ray heating is significant. Here we investigate a new model of AGN heating, in which the intracluster medium is efficiently heated by cosmic-rays, which are injected into the ICM through diffusion or the shredding of the bubbles by Rayleigh-Taylor or Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities. We include thermal conduction as well. Using numerical simulations, we {{show that the}} cooling catastrophe is efficiently suppressed. The cluster quickly relaxes to a quasi-equilibrium state with a highly reduced accretion rate and temperature and density profiles which match observations. Unlike the conduction-only case, no fine-tuning of the Spitzer conduction suppression factor f is needed.

In this thesis we present hardware and software developments, central simulations studies, theoretical calculations, calibrations and data analysis for the overall development of two engineering radio arrays at the Pierre Auger Observatory with special emphasis on the antenna sensor. The transient nature of the air shower signal requires a detailed description of the antenna to allow for a calibrated measurement of the incident signal. We identify the vector effective length as suitable quantity to perform the calculation of the antenna response to transient signals including multiple reflections, interference and polarization effects.
