500|$|Producer Martin Hannett [...] "dedicated {{himself to}} {{capturing}} and intensifying Joy Division's eerie spatiality". Hannett believed punk rock was sonically conservative {{because of its}} refusal to use studio technology to create sonic space. The producer instead aimed {{to create a more}} expansive sound on the group's records. Hannett said, [...] " [...] were a gift to a producer, because they didn't have a clue. They didn't argue". Hannett demanded clean and clear [...] "sound separation" [...] not only for individual instruments, but even for individual pieces of Morris's drumkit. Morris recalled, [...] "Typically on tracks he considered to be potential singles, he'd get me to play each drum on its own to avoid any <b>bleed-through</b> of sound". Music journalist Richard Cook noted that Hannett's role was [...] "crucial". There are [...] "devices of distance" [...] in his production and [...] "the sound is an illusion of physicality".|$|E
2500|$|Countertransference is {{a common}} problem in {{clinical}} settings. Despite having no evidence, therapists may find themselves believing that their client’s pathology is [...] "self-evident". Therapists may feel intense disgust and aversive reactions. Feelings of countertransference can interfere with therapy. Another common problem is when clients conceal their sexual preferences from their therapists. This can compromise any therapy. To avoid non-disclosure, therapists are encouraged to communicate their openness in indirect ways with literatures and artworks in the waiting room. Therapists can also deliberately bring up BDSM topics {{during the course of}} therapy. With less informed therapists, sometimes they over-focus on clients’ sexuality which detracts from original issues such as family relationships, depression, etc. A special subgroup that needs counselling is the [...] "newbie". Individuals just coming out might have internalized shame, fear, and self-hatred about their sexual preferences. Therapists need to provide acceptance, care, and model positive attitude; providing reassurance, psychoeducation, and bibliotherapy for these clients is crucial. The average age when BDSM individuals realize their sexual preference is around 26 years. Many people hide their sexuality until they can no longer contain their desires. However, they may have married or had children by this point. Therefore, therapists need to facilitate couple's counselling and disclosure. It is important for therapists to consider fairness to partner and family of clients. In situations when boundaries between roles in the bedroom and roles {{in the rest of the}} relationship blurs, a [...] "bleed-through" [...] problem has occurred. Therapists need to help clients resolve distress and deal with any underlying problems that led to the initial <b>bleed-through.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{signal that}} leaks from the {{transmitter}} to the receiver is called <b>bleed-through.</b> Electronic circuits have limited dynamic range, and this reduces receiver sensitivity.|$|E
50|$|Print-through (sometimes {{referred}} to as <b>bleed-through)</b> is a generally undesirable effect that arises {{in the use of}} magnetic tape for storing analogue information, in particular music.|$|E
50|$|Feed-through null is {{typically}} required to eliminate <b>bleed-through</b> between the {{transmitter and receiver}} to increase sensitivity in practical systems. This {{is typically}} used with continuous-wave angle tracking (CWAT) radar receivers that are interoperable with surface-to-air missile systems.|$|E
5000|$|Roller ball pens with liquid-ink {{are more}} likely to [...] "bleed" [...] through the paper. Liquid ink is more readily absorbed into the paper due to its lower {{viscosity}}. This viscosity also causes problems when leaving the tip on the paper (to pause for a thought for example). The <b>bleed-through</b> effect is greatly increased as the ink is continually absorbed into the paper, creating a blotch. This does not affect gel-ink roller ball pens as much. This is one way through which the thickness of gel-ink gives it an advantage, in that it isn't as prone to being absorbed. Though the <b>bleed-through</b> effect of a gel-ink roller ball is greater than that of a ballpoint, it is usually not too significant.|$|E

In the absence of spectral <b>bleed-through,</b> the cross-correlation function is zero for non-interacting particles. In contrast to FCS, the cross-correlation function increases with increasing numbers of interacting particles.|$|E
50|$|Interrupted continuous-wave {{can be used}} to {{eliminate}} <b>bleed-through</b> between the transmit and receive antenna. This kind of system typically takes one sample between each pair of transmit pulses, and the sample rate is typically 30 kHz or more. This technique is used with the least expensive kinds of radar, such as those used for traffic monitoring and sports.|$|E
5000|$|At {{one point}} there was <b>bleed-through</b> of a {{previously}} recorded vocal {{in the recording}} of [...] "Whole Lotta Love".

5000|$|LED-backlit LCDs are not self-illuminating (unlike pure-LED systems). There {{are several}} methods of {{backlighting}} an LCD panel using LEDs, {{including the use}} of either white or RGB (Red, Green, and Blue) LED arrays behind the panel and edge-LED lighting (which uses white LEDs around the inside frame of the TV and a light-diffusion panel to spread the light evenly behind the LCD panel). Variations in LED backlighting offer different benefits. The first commercial full-array LED-backlit LCD TV was the Sony Qualia 005 (introduced in 2004), which used RGB LED arrays to produce a color gamut about twice that of a conventional CCFL LCD television. This was possible because red, green and blue LEDs have sharp spectral peaks which (combined with the LCD panel filters) result in significantly less <b>bleed-through</b> to adjacent color channels. Unwanted <b>bleed-through</b> channels do not [...] "whiten" [...] the desired color as much, resulting in a larger gamut. RGB LED technology continues to be used on Sony BRAVIA LCD models.|$|E
5000|$|Aside from Haughm's illness, {{the band}} had {{problems}} with the amps {{that were on the}} stage and issues with <b>bleed-through</b> in the microphones, which was corrected in post-production. The decision was made to release the film in black and white because the color footage was not usable; the transfers were presented to the band in a format that was incompatible with the editor's software, though Haughm said that he felt the [...] "1930s silent film" [...] aesthetic worked well.|$|E
5000|$|Double-sided inkjet {{printing}} {{is usually not}} possible with inexpensive low-weight copy paper because of <b>bleed-through</b> {{from one side to}} the other. These papers are also unsuitable for photographic work because standard office paper is usually not [...] "white" [...] enough. This results in a poor color gamut and leads to [...] "muddy" [...] colors. For all types of paper, printer driver settings must be adjusted to suit the paper, so that the printer delivers the right amount of ink.|$|E
50|$|The PTI {{preservative}} imparts {{very little}} {{color to the}} wood. Producers generally add a color agent or a trace amount of copper solution so as to identify the wood as pressure treated and to better match the color of other pressure treated wood products. The PTI wood products are very well adapted for paint and stain applications with no <b>bleed-through.</b> The addition of the wax stabilizer allows a lower preservative retention plus substantially reduces the tendency of wood to warp and split as it dries. In combination with normal deck maintenance and sealer applications, the stabilizer helps maintain appearance and performance over time. PTI pressure treated wood products are no more corrosive than untreated wood and are approved {{for all types of}} metal contact, including aluminum.|$|E

5000|$|One {{drawback}} of {{the water}} based lacquer {{is that it has}} a tendency to be highly reactive to other fresh finishes such as quick dry primer (excluding waterborne lacquer primers), caulking and even some paints that have a paint /primer aspect. Tannin <b>bleed-through</b> can also be an issue, depending on the brand of lacquer used. Once it happens, there is no easy fix as the lacquer is so reactive to other products. It is best when planning to spray a white based lacquer over raw wood to source and find a primer that will seal in the tannin. Some painters will use a clear to seal, but several light and fast drying coats must be applied to ensure a good seal. It is then recommended to wait until the next day to start spraying the color so the clear has time to harden and keep the white from pulling the tannin right through the clear. Also, depending on the state / province in which the product is purchased and how familiar the supplier is with wbl, {{it can be difficult to}} get any answers from representatives, as many are unfamiliar with the potential reaction problems and how to fix them if they arise.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Ancient manuscripts {{represent}} important artefacts {{in cultural}} heritage, yet many are in very poor condition. One significant problem {{that affects the}} readability of some manuscripts is <b>bleed-through</b> degradation, where text from the recto or verso side bleeds through the folio. In the last decade {{there has been an}} increasing amount of work in this area which, in general, takes a machine learning approach. This paper presents a practical Bayesian approach to the problem, building a relatively low compute intensive algorithm starting with a linear degradation model.

This project executes algorithms to reduce <b>bleed-through</b> distortion using techniques in digital image processing.

30|$|The <b>bleed-through</b> {{database}} at {{the website}} [20] comprises 25 registered recto–verso sample grayscale image pairs, taken from larger high-resolution manuscript images, with varied degrees of <b>bleed-through.</b> In addition, for each image a binary ground-truth mask of the foreground text is provided.

40|$|Many old {{manuscript}} {{documents were}} written {{on both sides}} of the paper, and the <b>bleed-through</b> from one side of the document to the other increases the difficulty in reading or deciphering the information on the page. This paper presents techniques for reducing such <b>bleed-through</b> distortion using techniques of digital image processing. Both sides of the document are scanned, maintaining full spatial and amplitude resolution (8 bits/sample). The bleedthrough is reduced by processing both sides of the document simultaneously. First the verso side is flipped from left to right, and then the recto and flipped verso images are registered. This registration is necessary since it is impossible to perfectly align the front and back when scanning the document, and the scanner may not be perfectly uniform. We used a six-parameter affine transformation to register the two sides, determining the parameters using an optimization method. Once the two sides have been registered, areas consisting primarily of <b>bleed-through</b> are identified and replaced by the background color or intensity. The method has been tested on a number of documents, including documents we generated under controlled conditions and some original manuscripts; the readability of documents with heavy <b>bleed-through</b> has been greatly improved by this method. 1...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{research on}} the restoration of documents suffering <b>bleed-through</b> and the joint compression of the original document and its <b>bleed-through</b> corrected version. This topic as presented in this thesis requires four steps: (i) registration, (ii) segmentation, (iii) inpainting and (iv) compression. First, {{a review of existing}} methods for registration and segmentation are presented, followed by a review of some existing image compression formats for the purpose of compressing the images. Then, the development of efficient registration and segmentation algorithms that are based on previous research are presented, along with a new method for joint document compression. The methods presented in this thesis are compared with previous methods and are shown to have improvements over them. In terms of registration, the method presented here is faster in reaching a more accurate final solution than previous registration methods presented for this problem. The segmentation algorithm presented here is shown to accurately segment portions of <b>bleed-through</b> away {{from the rest of the}} document. On the topic of joint compression, it is shown in this thesis that jointly compressing a document with its <b>bleed-through</b> corrected version will reduce the bandwidth required to transmit those document images, when compared to simply compressing the two images individually...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a fully automatic {{framework for the}} restoration of double-sided historical manuscripts which are impaired by ink <b>bleed-through</b> distortions. First, the recto side and the verso side of a manuscript are precisely registered with a non-rigid registration method.

Next, we extract prominent foreground feature images with the two registered images. By referring to the feature images, we iteratively perform wavelet decomposition and construction to smear <b>bleed-through</b> interferences and to enhance foreground texts on the manuscript. We test the proposed framework with real manuscripts from the archives and the experimental results are encouraging. 1...|$|E
