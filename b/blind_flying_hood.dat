50|$|Instructor and trainee sat in open tandem cockpits. The latter, at the rear, was {{provided}} with the then-new <b>blind</b> <b>flying</b> panel and a cockpit hood was fitted so <b>blind</b> <b>flying</b> instruction was possible. The RAF Tomtits had 150 hp (112 kW) Mongoose IIIC motors. The prototype was first flown by George Bulman in November 1928.|$|R

50|$|Auster IV with <b>blind</b> <b>flying</b> {{instruments}} (Vacuum pump) and flap modification, and removable {{armour plate}} installed for pilot only, 790 built.|$|R
50|$|Avionics systems {{increased}} in sophistication and became more widespread, including power-assisted flight controls, <b>blind</b> <b>flying</b> instrumentation, radio communications and radar tracking.|$|R
50|$|A <b>blind</b> <b>flying</b> {{panel is}} a sub-panel {{in the cockpit}} {{containing}} six instruments mounted away from the main panel on three rubber suspension points. All the instruments on the <b>blind</b> <b>flying</b> panel are vacuum powered from a vacuum pump fitted {{on one of the}} engines, making the instruments independent of the electrical supply. It incorporates the following pitot/static and vacuum operated instruments:- Airspeed indicator, altimeter, climb/descent indicator, artificial horizon, turn and slip indicator and a directional gyro.|$|R

50|$|Two-seat primary trainer aircraft. Powered by a 130 hp (97 kW) de Havilland Gipsy Major {{piston engine}} and {{fitted with a}} hood over the rear cockpit for <b>blind</b> <b>flying</b> instruction. Named Tiger Moth II in RAF.|$|R
50|$|In summer 1943, Müller joined Hajo Herrmann {{as part of}} the latter's {{experimental}} Wilde Sau single-engine night fighting unit Stab/Versuchskommando Herrmann. Herrmann considered Müller {{an ideal}} candidate for the role because of his <b>blind</b> <b>flying</b> instructing experience.|$|R
50|$|In {{preparation}} for his flight to Norway, Solberg practiced <b>blind</b> <b>flying,</b> studied his route, and created his own maps of it. He received financial and technical support {{from two of}} his brothers, Bernt Balchen, and several other people.|$|R
50|$|The {{airfield}} {{was opened}} in 1944 at Royal Air Force Station Sturgate. Originally used for <b>blind</b> <b>flying</b> training two operational Lancaster squadrons arrived in June 1945 but both {{then moved to}} RAF Waddington in January 1946. The station closed to flying between 1946 and 1953.|$|R
5000|$|... 12 R-XIII's were {{converted}} to <b>blind</b> <b>flying</b> trainers R-XIIIt in 1934, with higher closed trainee cab. Some {{were converted}} to simple liaison aircraft, removig armament and mounting a windscreen in the second cab. Several R-XIII were used to tow gliders, using a special frame with a hook, attached to a fuselage.|$|R
2500|$|An Air Ministry {{investigation}} {{determined the}} cause of the accident to be pilot error due to the pilot's lack of experience in navigation and <b>blind</b> <b>flying.</b> Although conditions lower down were extremely poor, there was little cloud between [...] The sea was calm and the pilot was unable to distinguish its surface.|$|R
50|$|The ANT-18 {{featured}} rotation {{through all}} three axes, effectively simulated all flight instruments, and modeled common {{conditions such as}} pre-stall buffet, overspeed of the retractable undercarriage, and spinning. It was fitted with a removable opaque canopy, {{which could be used}} to simulate <b>blind</b> <b>flying,</b> and was particularly useful for instrument and navigation training.|$|R
50|$|In 1944, the Yakovlev UT-2 was the {{standard}} primary trainer of the Soviet Air Forces, but its simplicity caused problems when pilots {{moved on to}} more sophisticated aircraft, so the Yakovlev design bureau designed a more sophisticated derivative, the UT-2L, which featured an enclosed tandem cockpit, the addition of flaps and <b>blind</b> <b>flying</b> instruments.|$|R
50|$|The sole H.P.51 flew in its {{revised form}} {{for a short}} while with Handley Page. In January 1937 it went on to RAF Martlesham Heath for {{performance}} testing, then joined the RAE which it served until early 1940. During that period it was involved with air-to-air refuelling, <b>blind</b> <b>flying</b> instrumentation and intercom and radio developments.|$|R
5000|$|In 1934, Orville Wright wrote, [...] "Except for Maj. Ocker's great zeal as a missionary, I {{doubt whether}} {{the course in}} <b>blind</b> <b>flying</b> would be a {{requirement}} in the Army today. I believe that his campaign of education has had more influence in bringing {{about the use of}} instruments than that of any other person." ...|$|R

25|$|After {{completing}} {{one year}} of studies at the teacher's college, Puusepp transferred to a pilot's school, first in Volsk and later in Orenburg. He stayed at the latter as a flight instructor, having graduated. He was later transferred to a newly formed squadron specializing in <b>blind</b> <b>flying</b> (using only the airplane's instruments due to limited visibility).|$|R
25|$|The ATA trained its pilots only {{to ferry}} planes, {{rather than to}} achieve {{perfection}} on every type. For example, aerobatics and <b>blind</b> <b>flying</b> were not taught, and pilots were explicitly forbidden to do either, {{even if they were}} capable of doing so. The objective of the ATA was to deliver aircraft safely and that meant taking no unnecessary risks.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Blind</b> <b>flying</b> in fog or cloud {{should only}} be {{undertaken}} with gyroscopic instruments, which they did not have, and Alcock twice {{lost control of the}} aircraft and nearly hit the sea after a spiral dive. [...] Alcock also had to deal with a broken trim control that made the plane become very nose-heavy as fuel was consumed.|$|R

50|$|An Air Ministry {{investigation}} {{determined the}} cause of the accident to be pilot error due to the pilot's lack of experience in navigation and <b>blind</b> <b>flying.</b> Although conditions lower down were extremely poor, there was little cloud between 3,000 and 8,000 ft (900 and 2,400 m). The sea was calm and the pilot was unable to distinguish its surface.|$|R
50|$|Si 204D: A <b>blind</b> <b>flying</b> trainer {{developed}} by ČKD / BMM in the Czech Protectorate; the first D-0 pre-series aircraft was delivered in January 1943 plus another 44. Production of the D-1 {{was carried out}} by Aero and BMM. D-3 aircraft were built with wooden wings and tailplanes in an effort to relieve pressure on the Aluminium supply.|$|R
50|$|The Miles Hawk Trainer was {{developed}} from the Hawk Major to meet a requirement to supplement the de Havilland Tiger Moth in the training role. The aircraft had dual controls, <b>blind</b> <b>flying</b> equipment and vacuum operated flaps. In 1937 the design was further developed to meet an Air Ministry specification for a trainer and became the M.14 Magister.|$|R

50|$|During the Invasion of Poland in 1939, Żubrs {{were not}} used in combat. Several were {{destroyed}} on the ground, {{along with many other}} training aircraft. The Germans captured several LWS-6, including the twin-tailfin prototype, and used them for <b>blind</b> <b>flying</b> training until at least 1942 (among others, in Blindflugschule Schleissheim). Ironically, the Luftwaffe service of this bomber was longer than the Polish one.|$|R
5|$|The Z-4 was {{designed}} as trainer. Although nearly identical to the Z-2 and Z-3, it featured several equipment changes optimised for <b>blind</b> <b>flying</b> training. The four-seat aircraft had a single control column with dual steering, which was achieved by a jib protruding to the right. Rudder pedals were in front of both seats. The defensive armament and bomb racks were reduced, or in most cases omitted to reduce weight.|$|R
50|$|The Si 204D {{was used}} mainly in B- and C-Schools (advanced schools) and in FÜG 1 (delivery {{wing of the}} Luftwaffe), {{probably}} as a taxi aircraft for crews who had delivered other aircraft to fighting units. The utilization in <b>blind</b> <b>flying</b> schools was sporadic; for radio schools {{there is no evidence}} of use. The Si 204A flew mainly with communications squadrons and flying services for senior officers, but also with schools.|$|R
50|$|The {{first two}} prototypes only were {{delivered}} as passenger aircraft {{with the old}} cockpit. The maiden flight of the first prototype was before September 1940, possibly on 25 May 1940, that of the second prototype before February 1941. The third prototype was re-designed as a trainer aircraft for <b>blind</b> <b>flying.</b> As a result of this, the maiden flight was not earlier than the end of 1941 or the beginning of 1942.|$|R
50|$|This panel {{arrangement}} {{was incorporated into}} all RAF aircraft built to official specification from 1938, such as the Miles Master, Hawker Hurricane, Supermarine Spitfire, and 4-engined Avro Lancaster and Handley Page Halifax heavy bombers, but not the earlier light single-engined Tiger Moth trainer, and minimized the type-conversion difficulties associated with <b>blind</b> <b>flying,</b> since a pilot trained on one aircraft could quickly become accustomed to any other if the instruments were identical.|$|R
50|$|Apart {{from the}} {{standard}} variant, 50 RWD 8a PWS were built with an additional 95 l (25 U.S. gal) fuel tank in thicker central wing section, giving increased range. A small series was built with a rear cab covered with <b>blinds,</b> for <b>blind</b> <b>flying</b> training. A frame with a hook for glider towing could {{be attached to the}} aircraft. A further development of the RWD 8 was the aerobatics and training aircraft, the RWD-17.|$|R
5000|$|The Stampe et Vertongen RSV.28/180 Type III, {{also known}} as the RSV.28-PSV [...] (for {{pilotage}} sans visibilité, French for <b>blind</b> <b>flying)</b> was a military trainer aircraft built in Belgium to teach instrument-flying techniques. It was a response to a 1929 order from the Belgian Air Force, whose instrument-flying certification required a flight around a 100 km triangular course and return to a point less than 5 km from the start, using instruments only.|$|R
25|$|Maitland was {{eventually}} promoted to colonel during World War II, commanded a B-26 Marauder bomb group in combat in 1943, then {{retired from the}} Air Corps. In the 1950s he became an Episcopal minister. Hegenberger returned to his work with the Materiel Division and won the 1934 Collier Trophy for developing the first <b>blind</b> <b>flying</b> landing system. He rose through the ranks to major general and command of the Tenth Air Force in China during World War II.|$|R
500|$|I./JG234 was {{equipped}} with the Messerschmitt Bf 109E-3 in December 1938 and re-designated as I. Gruppe of Jagdgeschwader 26 [...] "Schlageter" [...] (JG26—26th Fighter Wing), named after Albert Leo Schlageter, on 1 May 1939. Müncheberg was transferred to 11. Staffel of Lehrgeschwader 2 (11./LG2—11th squadron of the 2nd Demonstration Wing) in mid-1939. 11.(Nacht)/LG2 was formed on 1 August 1939 and experimented with night fighting techniques. Only pilots with excellent <b>flying</b> abilities, especially <b>blind</b> <b>flying,</b> were chosen.|$|R
