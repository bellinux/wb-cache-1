He proposed an anthology series with each season <b>being</b> <b>a</b> <b>standalone,</b> serialized show set in a different era, beginning with a prequel to the original series, then stories set during the original series, during Star Trek: The Next Generation, and then [...] "beyond to a time in Trek that's never been seen before". Fuller compared this to what American Horror Story did for horror, and described the proposal as a platform for [...] "a universe of Trek shows". However, CBS told Fuller to just start with a single serialized show and see how that performs first, and he began further developing the concept of a prequel to the original series.|$|E
5000|$|Labeled [...] "Trilogy of the Dead" [...] until Land of the Dead, each film is {{laden with}} social {{commentary}} on topics ranging from racism to consumerism. The films are not produced as direct follow-ups {{from one another}} and their only continuation {{is the theme of}} the epidemic of the living dead. This situation advances with each film, showing the world in a worsening state, but each film is independent of its predecessor. This is exemplified by the fact that each movie is set within the era it is filmed, with Land of the Dead being set in modern times with current (as of 2005) technology such as game consoles, flatscreen televisions, cell phones and other examples of modern tech. This {{would not have been possible}} if the original 1968 epidemic had progressed to the state that Dawn and Day had depicted, as no new technology would have been created. The fifth film does not continue the depiction of progress, but returns to the similar events depicted in the first film in the very beginning of a zombie outbreak. The films depict how different people react to the same phenomenon, ranging from citizens to police to army officials and to citizens again. Each takes place in a world worsened since its previous appearance, the number of zombies ever increasing and the living perpetually endangered, but with each entry <b>being</b> <b>a</b> <b>standalone</b> film that is not directly continuing global events from the previous.|$|E

40|$|Inclusion {{of content}} with {{temporal}} {{behavior in a}} structured documents leads to such a document gaining temporal semantics. If we then allow changes to the document during its presentation, this brings with it a number of fundamental issues {{that are related to}} those temporal semantics. In this paper we study modifications of active multimedia documents and the implications of those modifications for temporal consistency. Such modifications are becoming increasingly important as multimedia documents move from <b>being</b> primarily <b>a</b> <b>standalone</b> presentation format to <b>being</b> <b>a</b> building block in a larger application. We present a categorization of modification operations, where each category has distinct consistency and implementation implications for the temporal semantics. We validate the model by applying it to the SMIL language, categorizing all possible editing operations. Finally, we apply the model to the design of a teleconferencing application, where multimedia composition is only a small component of the whole application, and needs to be reactive {{to the rest of the}} system. The primary contribution of this paper is the development of a temporal editing model and a general analysis which we feel can help application designers to structure their applications such that the temporal impact of document modification can be minimized...|$|R

50|$|Nth Man: The Ultimate Ninja is a {{comic book}} about an American ninja set in an {{unspecified}} near future where World War III has started. It was written by Larry Hama between 1989 and 1990, based largely on his success writing the G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero comic, which he wrote concurrently with The Nth Man (and also features a modern ninja {{as one of the}} main characters). Nth Man and Alfie O'Meagan first appeared in Marvel Comics Presents #25 (August 1989). The series was meant to last for 24 issues, but was cancelled after 16. In spite of this, Hama was able to resolve the storyline early. Ron Wagner, who penciled the series for its entire run, attributes its commercial failure to its <b>being</b> set in <b>a</b> <b>standalone</b> universe instead of the popular Marvel Universe, as well as the absence of costumed characters.|$|R
40|$|Graphene, {{including}} pristine graphene and its analogues of graphene oxide {{and reduced}} graphene oxide, is revolutionizing {{the way we}} design high performance devices, particularly {{in the areas of}} sustainable energy and environmental technologies. From environmental remediation and sensing to energy conversions and storage, there are many successful cases of graphene applications. Instead of <b>being</b> <b>a</b> <b>standalone</b> working material, graphene is almost always coupled with another active material as a composite. With its high surface-to-bulk ratio, efficient heat transfer, and electron conduction, the interfacing with graphene not only helps to overcome such limitations in the bare working material but actually accentuates them. To achieve this, the strategy of surface functionalization of graphene, with either soft matters (e. g., organics, molecular linkers, proteins) or solid inorganic matters (e. g., metal nanoparticles, oxide semiconductors), holds the key to enabling the fabrication of high performance composites. The resultant architectures, in which the graphene is applied to, yield the highest achievable properties and should be unique to the specific applications. This Review provides a bottom-up account encompassing the functionalization of graphene to the design of graphene-based composites and also their selected applications in high performance systems relevant to energy and the environment. 37 page(s...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new approach}} for synchronized phasor measurement-based state estimation, which starts from the buses with synchronized phasor data and enables highly accurate estimation of portions of the power system with connectivity to these phasor data buses. Observability analysis is used to assemble the buses for this Phasor State Estimator (PSE). The state estimation is formulated as an iterative least-squares problem, with bus voltage and line current magnitudes and phases as the estimated variables. An important aspect of this formulation {{is its ability to}} correct for constant or random phase biases that may exist in some phasor measurement equipment. Beside <b>being</b> <b>a</b> <b>standalone</b> state estimator, the PSE can enhance the reliability of a conventional state estimator. The PSE methodology is demonstrated for a power transfer path in the New York power system. © 2009 IEEE. Personal use of this material is permitted.

40|$|We {{investigate}} in {{this paper}} the architecture of deep convolutional networks. Building on existing {{state of the art}} models, we propose a reconfiguration of the model parameters into several parallel branches at the global network level, with each branch <b>being</b> <b>a</b> <b>standalone</b> CNN. We show that this arrangement is an efficient way to significantly reduce the number of parameters without losing performance or to significantly improve the performance with the same level of performance. The use of branches brings an additional form of regularization. In addition to the split into parallel branches, we propose a tighter coupling of these branches by placing the "fuse (averaging) layer" before the Log-Likelihood and SoftMax layers during training. This gives another significant performance improvement, the tighter coupling favouring the learning of better representations, even {{at the level of the}} individual branches. We refer to this branched architecture as "coupled ensembles". The approach is very generic and can be applied with almost any DCNN architecture. With coupled ensembles of DenseNet-BC and parameter budget of 25 M, we obtain error rates of 2. 92 %, 15. 68 % and 1. 50 % respectively on CIFAR- 10, CIFAR- 100 and SVHN tasks. For the same budget, DenseNet-BC has error rate of 3. 46 %, 17. 18 %, and 1. 8 % respectively. With ensembles of coupled ensembles, of DenseNet-BC networks, with 50 M total parameters, we obtain error rates of 2. 72 %, 15. 13 % and 1. 42 % respectively on these tasks...|$|E
40|$|Current {{methods for}} {{generating}} terrain databases do {{a poor job}} of integrating drainage features into the terrain skin, and in arid areas leave out features such as ravines and dry washes altogether. This paper demonstrates a way to automatically extract ravines using a combination of hydrological analysis and image understanding techniques. A physically realistic hydrological analysis is run on 30 -meter DEM data to generate initial estimates of ravine locations, which are then fine-tuned by an active contour (snake) method. The approach builds on standard tools, rather than <b>being</b> implemented as <b>a</b> <b>standalone</b> system. 1 Introduction A key use of simulation and terrain database systems by the military is to conduct training exercises and to plan missions.
