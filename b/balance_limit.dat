The researches at all took place in Uberlândia, Monte Carmelo, Iraí de Minas counties and others, prior focusing the basins of Douradinho at Uberlândia, Pantaninho and Divisa at Iraí de Minas and Boa Vista at Prata. This Triângulo Mineiro specific area has been through several geographical changes over the twentieth century implying alteration on its landscape structure. According to this, the need of knowing the processes dynamic as well as the diagnoses methods and also how to elaborate bating corrections and means to recover degraded areas has become extremely necessary. The main goal was the identification of either the mechanisms or the conditions stablishers responsible for erosion processes. “The tropical environment is characterized by a damaged landscape composed by potentially affected areas and others recently occupied which present initial effects. Both the areas need planning research. Whenever those environments get altered by human action, their fragilities show up ” (Baccaro, 1994 : 19). The gully formation processes at the basins have been developed and/or dynamized by uncontrolled human action and its improperly usage of soil and occupation of the area not considering its dynamic <b>balance</b> <b>limit.</b> This limit represents how far the environment naturally stands for antropic alterations not destabilizing the slopes and generating irreversible catastrophic consequences.

40|$|Poor {{ultraviolet}} (UV) quantum {{conversion efficiency}} {{contributes to a}} reduction in the efficiency of silicon based photovolatic cells. In the UV, the main loss mechanism is through surface recombination of photo-generated carriers due to the shallow absorption depth of high energy photons.

It is proposed that the organic pigment lumogen yellow S 0790 (lumogen) {{can be used as a}} suitable down shifting optical thin film in conjunction with silicon based photovoltaic cells.

The solar cell is simulated with a model based upon the detailed <b>balance</b> <b>limit</b> introduced by Shockley and Queisser. This concentrator photovoltaic system consisting of a triple junction solar cell and a Fresnel lens concentrator is simulated including changes in temperature and spectrum over daytime and during all seasons. Comparing two simulations, one with the Fresnel lens kept at constant temperature and one with a realistic temperature variation of the lens, allows us to analyze the impact of Fresnel lens temperature on system efficiency under realistic environmental conditions.

40|$|Abstract—Efficient {{external}} luminescence is {{a prerequisite}} for high-voltage solar cells. To approach the Shockley–Queisser limit, a highly reflective rear mirror is required. This mirror enhances the voltage of the solar cell by providing internally luminescent photons with multiple opportunities for escaping out the front sur-face. Likewise, intermediate reflectors in a multibandgap solar cell can assist external luminescence to enhance the voltage for each cell in a stack. These intermediate reflectors must also transmit the subbandgap photons to the next cell in the stack. A practi-cal implementation of an intermediate selective reflector is an air gap sandwiched by antireflection coatings. The air gap provides perfect reflection for angles outside the escape cone, and the an-tireflection coating transmits angles inside the escape cone. As the incoming sunlight is within the escape cone, it is transmitted on to the next cell, while most of the internally trapped luminescence is reflected. We calculate that air gap intermediate reflectors, along with a rear mirror, can provide an absolute efficiency increase of 5 % in multibandgap cells.

40|$|Methods of {{exceeding}} the detailed <b>balance</b> <b>limit</b> {{for a single}} junction solar cell have included down-converting high energy photons to produce two photons; and carrier multiplication, whereby high energy photons produce more than one electron-hole pair. Both of the methods obey the conservation of energy in similar ways, and effectively produce a higher current in the solar cell. Due to this similarity, it has been assumed {{that there is no}} thermodynamic difference between the two methods. Here, we compare the two methods using a generalized approach based on Kirchhoff's law of radiation and develop a new model for carrier multiplication. We demonstrate that there is an entropic penalty to be paid for attempting to accomplish all-in-one splitting in carrier multiplication systems, giving a small thermodynamic - and therefore efficiency - advantage to spectral splitting prior to reaching the solar cell. We show this analytically using a derivation of basic thermodynamic identities; numerically by solving for the maximal efficiency; and generally using heat-generation arguments. Our result modifies the existing literature on entropy generation limits in solar cells, and creates a new distinction among 3 rd generation photovoltaic technologies.

40|$|Clean {{renewable}} {{solar energy}} is {{and will continue}} to be a critically important source of electrical energy. Solar energy has the potential of meeting all of the world 2 ̆ 7 s energy needs, and has seen substantial growth in recent years. Solar cells can convert sun light directly into electrical energy, and much progress has been made in making them less expensive and more efficient. Solar cells are often characterized and modeled at 25 °C, which is significantly lower than their peak operating temperature. In some thermal concentrating systems, solar cells operate above 300 °C. Since increasing the temperature drastically affects the terminal characteristics, it is important to quantify the losses caused by raising the temperature. Methodologies for including the temperature dependent material parameters in analytical and detailed numerical models have been examined. The analytical model has been developed to analyze Shockley-Queisser detailed <b>balance</b> <b>limit,</b> as well as the Auger, Radiative and SHR recombination limiting cases from 25 °C to 800 °C, at 1 x, 500 x and 2000 x suns concentrations.

40|$|The power {{conversion}} efficiency of the most efficient organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells has recently increased to over 10 %. To enable further increases, the factors limiting the device efficiency in OPV must be identified. In this review, the operational mechanism of OPV cells is explained and the detailed <b>balance</b> <b>limit</b> to photovoltaic energy conversion, as developed by Shockley and Queisser, is outlined. The various approaches {{that have been developed}} to estimate the maximum practically achievable efficiency in OPV are then discussed, based on empirical knowledge of organic semiconductor materials. Subsequently, approaches made to adapt the detailed balance theory to incorporate some of the fundamentally different processes in organic solar cells that originate from using a combination of two complementary, donor and acceptor, organic semiconductors using thermodynamic and kinetic approaches are described. The more empirical formulations to the efficiency limits provide estimates of 10 – 12 %, but the more fundamental descriptions suggest limits of 20 – 24 % to be reachable in single junctions, similar to the highest efficiencies obtained for crystalline silicon p-n junction solar cells. Closing this gap sets the stage for future materials research and development of OPV...|$|E

40|$|The {{growth and}} {{characterization}} of GaAs nanowires and GaNPAs thin-films is discussed {{within the context}} of finding a material system that is suitable as an intermediate band solar cell (IBSC) absorber. The IBSC is an attractive concept proposed to exceed the Shockley-Queisser detailed <b>balance</b> <b>limit</b> for photovoltaic efficiency. These solar cells have an additional intermediate band, allowing for the absorption of below bandgap photons, thus resulting in an increase in photocurrent and higher efficiency. Suitable materials systems for the implementation of the IBSC concept, however, are presently lacking. Recent work on the highly-mismatched alloy (HMA) GaAsN has shown that the unique features of the electronic band structure demonstrate optical activity of three energy bands and have led to the realization of a proof-of-concept IBSC. GaAsN, however, is not without shortcomings. Another HMA material, GaNPAs, which offers a wide range of bandgap tunability and is better matched to the solar spectrum is proposed. This work covers the optical characterization of both GaAs nanowires and GaAsPN using traditional visible-light semiconductor characterization techniques including optical absorption spectroscopy, photo-modulated reflectance, steady-state photoluminescence, and spectral photoconductivity. Additionally, photovoltaic devices based on GaNPAs are demonstrated and assessed as potential IBSCs...|$|E

The edge impurity transport in the ergodic layer formed by stochastic magnetic field lines with long connection length (10 - 2000 m) can also exhibit interesting phenomena in the competition of perpendicular and parallel transport. The LHD discharge is highly robust against impurity buildup, and operation is possible essentially up to the global power <b>balance</b> <b>limit</b> because current-driven instability does not principally exist.

40|$|A {{numerical}} evaluation {{technique is}} used to study the impact of practical barriers, such as heavy doping effects (Auger recombination, band gap narrowing), surface recombination, shadowing losses and minority-carrier lifetime (Tau), on a high efficiency silicon solar cell performance. Considering a high Tau of 1 ms, efficiency of a silicon solar cell of the hypothetical case {{is estimated to be}} around 29 %. This is comparable with (detailed <b>balance</b> <b>limit)</b> maximum efficiency of a p-n junction solar cell of 30 %. Value of Tau is varied from 1 second to 20 micro. Heavy doping effects, and realizable values of surface recombination velocities and shadowing, are then considered in succession and their influence on cell efficiency is evaluated and quantified. These practical barriers cause the cell efficiency to reduce from the maximum value of 29 % to the experimentally achieved value of about 19 %. Improvement in open circuit voltage V sub oc is required to achieve cell efficiency greater than 20 %. Increased value of Tau reduces reverse saturation current and, hence, improves V sub oc. Control of surface recombination losses becomes critical at higher V sub oc. Substantial improvement in Tau and considerable reduction in surface recombination velocities is essential to achieve cell efficiencies greater than 20 %...|$|E
