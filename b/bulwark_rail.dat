The lower planks of the deck rose from the water and, although this still rushed in and out through the scupper holes, and rose at times {{to the level of the}} <b>bulwark</b> <b>rail,</b> he felt that the worst was over.|$|E

[...] he turned to speak with Skallagrim. The Baresark was gone, for, wasting no breath in words, already he was fixing the long shields on the <b>bulwark</b> <b>rail.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{dissemination}} of Clayton Dissinger Mell's 1917 monograph on the subject, [...] "True Mahogany", {{resulted in the}} increased use of mahogany in ship construction: [...] "It is particularly suited for planking, waterways, <b>bulwarks,</b> <b>rails,</b> skylights and companions, bitts, gangway ladders, and other deck work. With the later employment of iron, steel and teak in shipbuilding, mahogany became far more important as a furniture wood, though it is still preferred to any other wood for the framework of small sailing vessels. Large sailing vessels with mahogany framework were sold for enormous prices and manufactured into fine furniture." ...|$|R

No air that stirred; the black {{smoke from the}} funnels of the mail steamer Zanzibar lay low {{over the surface of}} the sea like vast, floating ostrich plumes that vanished one by one in the starlight. Benita Beatrix Clifford, for that was her full name, who had been christened Benita after her mother and Beatrix after her father's only sister, leaning idly over the <b>bulwark</b> <b>rail,</b> thought to herself that a child might have sailed that sea in a boat of bark and come safely into port.|$|E
5000|$|The Tuncurry was {{involved}} in a collision with a Tug in the early morning of 30 September 1906: Passengers by the coasting, steamer Tuncurry were awakened early this morning whilst on a voyage from Sydney to Cape Hawke by a crash, and on looking out, were surprised to find that their vessel had been in collision with the tug Advance (1884). The Tuncurry returned to Sydney today. An ugly hole in her starboard quarter afforded ample evidence of the early morning smash.The collision occurred shortly after 4 o'clock this morning in the vicinity of North Head. The Tuncurry, which belongs to Messrs. Allen Taylor and Co.'s line, in charge of Captain E. P. O'Bierne, left Pyrmont on Saturday night on her regular week's end trip to Cape Hawke. She carried several passengers and a general cargo. The weather, on clearing the Heads, was somewhat overcast and thick. All, however, went well until about five miles north of North Head, when the tug suddenly loomed up and the collision resulted. The tug had evidently come from Newcastle, and it is stated was [...] "cruising" [...] on the lookout for inward-bound sailing vessels. The two vessels met with considerable force. The Tuncurry received the full strength of the blow on the starboard quarter. Her long counter saved her from being sent to the bottom. Had she been struck a little further forward nothing could have saved her. All the bulward planks in the vicinity were splintered, the damage extending below the covering board. The <b>bulwark</b> <b>rail</b> and stanchions were driven on board by the impact, and passengers who were berthed in the deck house in the vicinity were imprisoned by the wreckage. They were, however quickly rescued from their perilous position by Captain O'Bierne and his officers. The tug meanwhile stood by to render any necessary assistance. A hurried examination was made by Captain O'Bierne. and finding the damage well above water he signalled to the tug that no assistance was needed and immediately headed back to Sydney. The tug put into Newcastle, damaged at the bows.|$|E
