5|$|After the breakout, the Austro-Hungarian navy saw {{very little}} action, {{spending}} {{much of its}} time in its <b>base</b> <b>at</b> Pola (now Pula, Croatia). The navy's general inactivity was partly caused {{by a lack of}} coal, which became a problem as the war progressed, and partly by a fear of mines in the Adriatic (which also kept the Italian navy in port for most of the war). They did, however, leave Pola to bombard Ancona in May 1915. On 23 May 1915, four hours after the Italian declaration of war reached the main Austro-Hungarian naval <b>base</b> <b>at</b> Pola, the members of the Tegetthoff class {{and the rest of the}} fleet departed to bombard the Italian coast. The Austro-Hungarian ships bombarded the important naval <b>base</b> <b>at</b> Ancona, and later the coast of Montenegro, without opposition; by the time Italian ships arrived on the scene, the Austro-Hungarians were safely back in Pola.|$|E
