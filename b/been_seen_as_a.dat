5|$|Spirited Away {{contains}} critical {{commentary on}} modern Japanese society concerning generational conflicts and environmental issues. Chihiro has <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{representation of the}} shōjo, whose roles and ideology had changed dramatically since post-war Japan.|$|E
5|$|An {{alcoholic}} and womanizer, Kunichika also portrayed women deemed beautiful (bijinga), contemporary social life, {{and a few}} landscapes and historical scenes. He worked successfully in the Edo period, and carried those traditions into the Meiji period. To his contemporaries and now to some modern art historians, this has <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> significant achievement during a transitional period of great social and political change in Japan's history.|$|E
5|$|Malawi has <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{haven for}} {{refugees}} from other African countries, including Mozambique and Rwanda, since 1985. These influxes of refugees have placed {{a strain on}} the Malawian economy but have also drawn significant inflows of aid from other countries. Donors to Malawi include the United States, Canada, Germany, Iceland, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Ireland, the UK and Flanders (Belgium), as well as international {{institutions such as the}} World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the European Union, the African Development Bank and UN organisations.|$|E
50|$|Schumpeterian rent <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> form of {{economic}} rent, although Schumpeterian rent may <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> incentive towards greater economic inefficiency.|$|R
50|$|Observe {{also that}} a {{necessity}} measure can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> lower probability and a possibility measure can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> upper probability.|$|R
50|$|Independence can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{special kind}} of {{conditional}} independence, since probability can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> kind of conditional probability given no events.|$|R
5|$|Sociology {{of leisure}} {{is a fairly}} recent {{subfield}} of sociology, compared to more traditional subfields such as sociology of work, sociology of the family, and sociology of education: it saw most of its development {{in the second half}} of the 20th century. Until then, leisure had often <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> relatively unimportant, minor feature of society. Leisure is now recognized as a major social institution, deserving of serious sociological inquiry, particularly in Western societies.|$|E
5|$|The Bororo {{people of}} Mato Grosso in central Brazil {{regarded}} the constellation as a land tortoise Geriguigui, while the Tucano {{people of the}} northwestern Amazon region saw it as an egret. To the Tupi people of São Luís Island in Brazil, Corvus might have <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> grill or barbecue—seychouioura, on which fish were grilled. The depiction could have also referred to the Great Square of Pegasus.|$|E
5|$|The third letter openly {{incorporates}} Swift's {{argument that}} political authority {{stems from the}} consent of a population. As such, the third letter has <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> response {{in part to the}} Declaratory Act, which had undermined the independence and the authority of Irish legislature and judiciary in favour of the British. The Declaratory Act removed the ability for any in Ireland to speak for the people of Ireland, and it was necessary for the act to be removed before the people could be heard.|$|E
40|$|When {{modelling}} a domain, it {{is often}} the case that certain individuals are represented as belonging to multiple categories, generating therefore "tangled" hierarchies: 1. A physical object can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> amount of matter 2. <b>A</b> hole can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> region of space 3. <b>A</b> building can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> place 4. A biological organ can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> aggregate of molecules 5. An association can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> group of people 6. A physical object can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> temporal process This phenomenon is quite common: the examples above have been taken from existing toplevel ontologies used in practice, and they are responsible, in our opinion, of many situations of tangleness, confusion, and lack of semantic rigour. We advocate in the present paper a design principle aimed to clarify such situations and produce more reusable and well-founded ontologies. It can be stated as follows: Ontological Distinction Principle: Classes corresponding to different ident...|$|R
50|$|After WWII {{women were}} {{discouraged}} from entering into engineering. During the war, their efforts <b>were</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> patriotic duty. After the war, women in engineering <b>were</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> abnormality.|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> bicone can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{polyhedral}} {{limiting case}} of an n-gonal bipyramid where n approaches infinity. It can also <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> dual of <b>a</b> cylinder <b>as</b> <b>an</b> infinite-side prism.|$|R
5|$|This {{letter is}} seen as the final salvo in the Drapier's fight against Wood's patent. Although there was a {{possible}} agreement between Carteret and Walpole over ending the patent, Swift found it necessary to publish this defence of the fourth letter to ensure that Walpole would not back down from his promise of removing the patent. It has also <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> letter celebrating Harding's release from being tried for printing the Drapier's letters.|$|E
5|$|A Welsh shipbroker, W. J. Orders, {{organised}} {{a collection}} fund {{on the floor}} of the Cardiff Coal Exchange and floated a public testimonial of one shilling. The national response was considerable and within weeks the total was into hundreds of pounds. This drew the Welsh Football Union (WFU) into a confrontation with the IRFB, as rule 2 on professionalism stated that no player was allowed to receive money from his club, or any member of his club, for services rendered to football. The fund could have <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> professional fee to Gould, henceforth making him ineligible to play for his country. The WFU argued that the money raised was not given by the club, but rather an outpouring of thanks from the Welsh public to a national hero.|$|E
5|$|Kepler-10c is an {{exoplanet}} {{orbiting the}} G-type star Kepler-10, located around 568 light-years away in Draco. Its discovery was announced by Kepler in May 2011, {{although it had}} <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> planetary candidate since January 2011, when Kepler-10b was discovered. The team confirmed the observation using data from NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope and a technique called Blender that ruled out most false positives. Kepler-10c was the third transiting planet to be confirmed statistically (based on probability rather than actual observation), after Kepler-9d and Kepler-11g. The Kepler team considers the statistical method {{that led to the}} discovery of Kepler-10c as what will be necessary to confirm many planets in Kepler's field of view.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{statement}} can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{support of}} the harmony between the teachings and Chán. The second statement can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> support of a [...] "special transmission outside the teachings".|$|R
50|$|In some areas, the {{bullhead}} <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> desirable quarry, for its fighting qualities exceed its size. In other areas, it <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> nuisance fish {{due to its}} efficient bait-stealing qualities.|$|R
50|$|Toad <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> zombie, {{along with}} several {{other members of the}} zombie Freedom Force chasing after the still living Blob. They succeed, <b>as</b> he <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> zombie in Dead Days.|$|R
5|$|Kiarostami's {{style is}} notable {{for the use}} of long shots, such as in the closing {{sequences}} of Life, and Nothing More... and Through the Olive Trees, where the audience is intentionally distanced physically from the characters to invite reflection on their fate. Taste of Cherry is punctuated throughout by shots of this kind, including distant overhead shots of the suicidal Badii's car moving across the hills, usually while he is in conversation with a passenger. The physical distancing techniques stand in juxtaposition to the dialogue, which always remains in the foreground. Like the coexistence of private and public space, or the frequent framing of landscapes through car windows, this fusion of distance with proximity has <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> way of generating suspense in the most mundane of moments.|$|E
5|$|Mindaugas and his {{antagonist}} Daniel {{reached a}} reconciliation in 1255; the Black Ruthenian lands {{were transferred to}} Roman, Daniel's son. Afterwards Mindaugas's son Vaišvilkas received baptism {{as a member of}} the Orthodox faith, becoming a monk and later founding a convent and monastery. Tautvilas's antagonism was temporarily resolved when he recognized Mindaugas's superiority and received Polatsk as a fiefdom. A direct confrontation with the Mongols occurred in 1258 or 1259, when Berke Khan sent his general Burundai to challenge Lithuanian rule, ordering Daniel and other regional princes to participate. The Novgorod Chronicle describes the following action as a defeat of the Lithuanians, but it has also <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> net gain for Mindaugas.|$|E
5|$|Some {{licences}} {{have not}} been renewed; for example, the RMC Aggregates quarry at Eldon Hill was forced to close in 1999, and landscaping is ongoing. The proposals dating from 1999 from Stancliffe Stone Ltd to re-open dormant gritstone quarries at Stanton Moor have <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> test case. They are hotly contested by ecological protesters and local residents on grounds that the development would threaten nearby Bronze Age remains, in particular the Nine Ladies Stone Circle, {{as well as the}} natural landscape locally. As of 2007, negotiations are ongoing to shift the development to the nearby Dale View quarry, a less sensitive area.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{statement}} can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{support of}} the harmony between the teachings and Chán. The second statement can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> support of a [...] "special transmission outside the teachings".|$|R
50|$|Dom Peters <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> shining {{example for}} all inner-city {{children}} {{wanting to get}} into professional sport after coming through the Broncos youth system. He <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> highly promising winger when injury-free.|$|R
5000|$|It can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {4/2} antiprism; with {4/2} being a tetragram, a {{compound}} of two dual digons, and the tetrahedron <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> digonal antiprism, this can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> compound of two digonal antiprisms.|$|R
5|$|The {{massive and}} rapid {{expansion}} of the cattle egret's range is due to its relationship with humans and their domesticated animals. Originally adapted to a commensal relationship with large grazing and browsing animals, it was easily able to switch to domesticated cattle and horses. As the keeping of livestock spread throughout the world, the cattle egret was able to occupy otherwise empty niches. Many populations of cattle egrets are highly migratory and dispersive, and this has helped the species' range expansion. The species has <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> vagrant in various sub-Antarctic islands, including South Georgia, Marion Island, the South Sandwich Islands and the South Orkney Islands. A small flock of eight birds was also seen in Fiji in 2008.|$|E
5|$|The {{title of}} the film was chosen to counter American author Katherine Mayo's 1927 polemical book Mother India, which vilified Indian culture. Allusions to Hindu mythology are {{abundant}} in the film, and its lead character has <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> metonymic representation of a Hindu woman who reflects high moral values {{and the concept of}} what it means to be a mother to society through self-sacrifice. Mother India metaphorically represents India as a nation in the aftermath of independence, and alludes to a strong sense of nationalism and nation-building. While some authors treat Radha as the symbol of women empowerment, others see her cast in female stereotypes. The film was shot in Mumbai's Mehboob Studios and in the villages of Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Uttar Pradesh states. The music by Naushad introduced Western classical music and Hollywood-style orchestra to Hindi cinema.|$|E
5|$|This high {{concentration}} and oppressive {{treatment of the}} slave population led to rebellions. In 135 BC and 104 BC, the First and Second Servile Wars, respectively, erupted in Sicily, where small bands of rebels found {{tens of thousands of}} willing followers wishing to escape the oppressive life of a Roman slave. While these were considered serious civil disturbances by the Roman Senate, taking years and direct military intervention to quell, they were never considered a serious threat to the Republic. The Roman heartland had never seen a slave uprising, nor had slaves ever <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> potential threat to the city of Rome. This would all change with the Third Servile War.|$|E
50|$|As the {{displacement}} can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> mechanical analogue of electric charge, the absement can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> mechanical analogue of the time-integrated charge, a quantity useful for modelling {{some types of}} memory elements.|$|R
5000|$|Cashmere Ramada and Shelley Oceans {{appeared}} in the Neil's Puppet Dreams episode [...] "Dream Bump." [...] Cashmere Ramada <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> dancer while Shelly Oceans <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> drag queen (performed by Allan Trautman).|$|R
30|$|As already {{explained}} in [12], RS can also <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> form of non-orthogonal multi-user transmission. Indeed, in its simplest form, the common message in RS can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> non-orthogonal layer added onto the private layers.|$|R
5|$|Traditionally, {{the arrest}} of the bishops has <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> turning point in Stephen's reign, and the event that turned the ecclesiastical {{hierarchy}} against him. Recent historians have held a lively debate on the issue; a few still hold to the traditional interpretation, but most have decided that reactions in the English church were more ambivalent. One modern historian, David Crouch, believes that {{the arrest of}} the bishops signalled {{the beginnings of the}} Anarchy, not because of any alienation of the church, but through court politics, where Stephen showed himself incapable of manipulating the factions of his court. The ascendency of the Beaumonts was marked by the placement of one of their protégés, Philip de Harcourt, as Chancellor.|$|E
5|$|Both Guitar Hero and Rock Band, {{a similar}} series of games {{developed}} by Harmonix (who originally developed Guitar Hero), {{have altered the}} video game and music industries. For video games, the introduction of Guitar Hero has led rhythm games {{to become one of}} the industries' largest growing markets. The series has also sparked the creation of both commercial and independently developed games with similar gameplay mechanics as well as learning tools using a real guitar in place of the controller. Older artists featured in Guitar Hero and Rock Band have experienced a surge in the popularity of their music, and the games have <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> way for younger audiences to experience the classic rock songs featured in the games. Newer bands and unsigned artists have also found success by being included in the game. This has led several bands to actively seek placement of their songs within the games. The impact of Guitar Hero on the music industry has caused music publishers to re-evaluate their approach to music licensing and their relationship with the video game industry.|$|E
5|$|For most of {{the last}} century {{military}} service {{has been one of the}} single greatest shared experiences of white Australian males, and although this is now changing due to the professionalisation of the military and the absence of major wars during the second half of the 20th century, it continues to influence Australian society to this day. War and military service have been defining influences in Australian history, while a major part of the national identity has been built on an idealised conception of the Australian experience of war and of soldiering, known as the Anzac spirit. These ideals include notions of endurance, courage, ingenuity, humour, larrikinism, egalitarianism and mateship; traits which, according to popular thought, defined the behaviour of Australian soldiers fighting at Gallipoli during the First World War. The Gallipoli campaign was one of the first international events that saw Australians taking part as Australians and has <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> key event in forging a sense of national identity.|$|E
5000|$|On January 3, 2017, Bramnick {{announced}} that he would not run for New Jersey governor in 2017, <b>as</b> he <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> potential frontrunner for the Republican gubernatorial nomination. Bramnick <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> potential 2018 Senate candidate against Sen. Robert Menendez.|$|R
50|$|The crossed square cupola may <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{part of some}} uniform polyhedra. For example, {{the great}} cubicuboctahedron may <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> six crossed square cupolae {{connected}} at their triangular faces, while the nonconvex great rhombicuboctahedron may <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> blend of six cupolae. Additionally, the nonconvex great rhombicuboctahedron may <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> octagrammic prism with the octagrams excavated with crossed square cupolae, similarly to how the rhombicuboctahedron may <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> octagonal prism with the octagons augmented with square cupolae. Rotating one of the cupolae in this construction results in the pseudo-great rhombicuboctahedron. To this may be added the great rhombihexahedron, as the exclusive or of {{all three of these}} octagrammic prisms which may be used to construct the nonconvex great rhombicuboctahedron.|$|R
5000|$|It can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> {{equilateral}} hexagonal tiling {{with each}} hexagon divided into 12 triangles {{from the center}} point.
