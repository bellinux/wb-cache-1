50|$|The University {{expedition}} {{was primarily}} sponsored by Land Rover, {{who provided the}} vehicles, but was also sponsored {{by a total of}} more than 80 other third parties through both loaned and donated equipment and supplies, ranging from whiskey to collapsible <b>buckets,</b> as <b>well</b> as monetary donations. The expedition was both filmed and documented, and the footage broadcast in the mid-50s on the BBC, which gave it the film in the first place at the behest of David Attenborough.|$|R
50|$|In this response, Clarke {{argues for}} the {{necessity}} {{of the existence of}} absolute space to account for phenomena like rotation and acceleration that cannot be accounted for on a purely relationalist account. Clarke argues that since the curvature of the water occurs in the rotating <b>bucket</b> as <b>well</b> as in the stationary bucket containing spinning water, it can only be explained by stating that the water is rotating in relation to the presence of some third thing—absolute space.|$|R
50|$|The next day, Madog and Cadfael {{find the}} place of Baldwin Peche's murder, where the Aurifaber {{property}} meets the Severn. Three plants grow there, found on his body. Further clues of rocks and a coin there point to the murderer, and the thief. Cadfael, Beringar and Liliwin realise that while Susanna could not have attacked her father during the party, an accomplice could have done so. Then Susanna retrieved the treasure from the <b>well</b> <b>bucket</b> and hid it in that oatmeal bin when the men chased after the jongleur. When Peche's servant boy found a coin in the <b>well</b> <b>bucket,</b> Peche attempted to blackmail Susanna, a distinct mistake. Liliwin sees danger for his Rannilt.|$|R
40|$|Groundwater {{resources}} {{are an important}} water reserve, requiring their constant monitoring and protection. This study aims determine the natural vulnerability to contamination of groundwater {{in the area of}} Bairro Our Lady of Perpetual Help in Santa Maria - RS. To determine the vulnerability was used the "GOD" methodology, G - Groundwater hydraulic confinement O - overlaying strata, D - depth to groundwater table (Foster et., 2003). Were analyzed 54 alternative sources: 19 of them are dug wells, 23 are tube wells, two are sources springs and 10 wells are disabled. About wells in operation, 30 of them use submersible pumps or compressors (air lift), and in 12 water is removed manually (<b>bucket</b> <b>wells).</b> The dug wells are in areas that varies of negligible to high vulnerability. The two sources / springs are located in negligible vulnerable areas. Based in this study I could conclude there are several wells constructed in an irregular manner, presenting health risk to the population that uses underground water for human consumption. In areas of considerable vulnerability is essential a frequent monitoring of groundwater quality to avoid human contact with polluted waters...|$|R
50|$|The village, home to 150 families, {{suffered}} from financial problems {{and lack of}} a regular water supply. After years of hauling water in <b>buckets</b> from a <b>well</b> six kilometers away, the village received a government water pipeline in 1935. Electricity was hooked up in 1939.|$|R
50|$|The 1940s were {{years of}} {{austerity}} and difficulty. Mains electricity arrived {{just after the}} Second World War but the need to collect water in <b>buckets</b> from nearby <b>wells</b> and springs continued until 1961. Only then were clean piped water and underground sewage and drainage systems available for most householders.|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} we compare {{different}} batch construction methods for mini-batch training of recurrent neural networks. While popular implementations like TensorFlow and MXNet suggest a bucketing approach {{to improve the}} parallelization capabilities of the recurrent training process, we propose a simple ordering strategy that arranges the training sequences in a stochastic alternatingly sorted way. We compare our method to sequence <b>bucketing</b> as <b>well</b> as various other batch construction strategies on the CHiME- 4 noisy speech recognition corpus. The experiments show that our alternated sorting approach is able to compete both in training time and recognition performance while being conceptually simpler to implement...|$|R

The tool allows to upload and download objects in parallel. It is free software and licensed according to the MIT License.
