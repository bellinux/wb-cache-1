Plants are exposed to many stress factors, such as drought, high salinity or pathogens, which reduce the yield of the cultivated plants or affect the quality of the harvested products. Although there are many kinds of <b>biotic</b> <b>stress,</b> the majority of plant diseases are caused by fungi.

40|$|Introduction. Pests, {{diseases}} and weeds (<b>biotic</b> <b>stresses)</b> are significant limiting factors for crop yield and production. However, the limitations associated with conventional breeding methods necessitated {{the development of}} alternative methods for improving new varieties with higher resistance to <b>biotic</b> <b>stresses.</b> Molecular techniques have developed applicable methods for genetic transformation {{of a wide range}} of plants. Genetic engineering approach has been demonstrated to provide enormous options for the selection of the resistance genes from different sources to introduce them into plants to provide resistance against different <b>biotic</b> <b>stresses.</b> Literature. In this review, we focus on strategies to achieve the above mentioned objectives including expression of insecticidal, antifungal, antibacterial, antiviral resistance and herbicide detoxification for herbicide resistance. Conclusion. Regardless of the concerns about commercialization of products from genetically modified (GM) crops resistant to <b>biotic</b> <b>stresses,</b> it is observed that the cultivation area of these crops is growing fast each year. Considering this trend, it is expected that production and commercialization of GM crops resistant to <b>biotic</b> <b>stresses</b> will continue to increase but will also extend to production of crops resistant to abiotic stresses (e. g. drought, salinity, etc.) in a near future...|$|R

50|$|<b>Biotic</b> <b>stress</b> is {{stress that}} occurs {{as a result}} of damage done to an {{organism}} by other living organisms, such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, parasites, beneficial and harmful insects, weeds, and cultivated or native plants. It is different from abiotic stress, which is the negative impact of non-living factors on the organisms such as temperature, sunlight, wind, salinity, flooding and drought. The types of biotic stresses imposed on an organism depend the climate where it lives as well as the species' ability to resist particular stresses. <b>Biotic</b> <b>stress</b> remains a broadly defined term and those who study it face many challenges, such as the greater difficulty in controlling biotic stresses in an experimental context compared to abiotic stress.|$|E

30|$|The {{expression}} of genes involved in JA synthesis varied under both the <b>biotic</b> and abiotic <b>stresses</b> (Figure  5 c). The genes encoding LOX and allene oxide synthase (AOS), {{both of which}} function in chloroplasts [25], were induced by the <b>biotic</b> <b>stresses</b> and the SiAF and SiNF treatments, although some of these genes were suppressed by the abiotic stresses (Figure  5 c). The {{expression of}} the JAZ genes was activated by the <b>biotic</b> <b>stresses</b> and the ozone, SiAF, and SiNF treatments and suppressed by other abiotic stresses (Figure  5 d). Many types of stress factors induced genes encoding AP 2 -EREBP and WRKY proteins, although the specific responsive genes were also dependent {{on the type of}} stress (Figure  5 e and f). Genes that were highly induced by the SiAF treatment were also induced by the <b>biotic</b> <b>stresses</b> but were suppressed by the abiotic stresses such as chilling and drought. WRKY 45 (LOC_Os 05 g 25770) gene expression was induced by the <b>biotic</b> <b>stresses</b> and the ozone, SiAF, and SiNF treatments but was suppressed by the abiotic stresses (Figure  5 f and Additional file 3 : Table S 2). The genes encoding PR proteins also responded to many types of stress factors, and these gene responses were also dependent on the type of stress (Additional file 3 : Table S 2). Among chitinase genes, the DEGs activated by the SiAF and the SiNF treatments were similar to those activated by the <b>biotic</b> <b>stresses</b> (Figure  5 g).|$|R

30|$|Azospirillum is {{currently}} {{one of the}} most broadly studied and commercially employed PGPB. Previous studies with Azospirillum emphasize its capacity of fixing atmospheric N 2, followed by benefits in promoting plant growth via synthesis of phytohormones. More recently, {{it has been shown that}} the benefits should be extended to the capacity of some Azospirillum strains to protect plants from <b>biotic</b> <b>stresses,</b> triggering ISR defense mechanisms, and from abiotic stresses, through IST. Figure  1 summarizes the mechanisms discussed in this review of tolerance of abiotic and <b>biotic</b> <b>stresses</b> promoted by inoculation of Azospirillum in plants, encompassing detoxification of oxidative stress, ISR and IST. The mechanisms that PGPB use to cope with <b>biotic</b> and abiotic <b>stresses</b> vary with the plant species and cultivar and with the bacterial species and strains, and also depend on the phytopathogen and the intensity of the abiotic stress. Further studies to elucidate the mechanisms of action of PGPB—as well as of the response of plants to stresses—are of fundamental importance for understanding the potential and increasing the use of PGPB as an important and sustainable strategy to mitigate the effects of <b>biotic</b> and abiotic <b>stresses</b> in agriculture.|$|R
