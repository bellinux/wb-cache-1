When sending a <b>blind</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>copy</b> (bcc), the users to whom the message is sent directly will not be aware of the recipients of the <b>blind</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>copy</b> or even if one was sent in the first place.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} a {{framework in which}} a group of agents communicates by means of emails, {{with the possibility of}} replies, forwards and <b>blind</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>copies</b> (BCC). We study the epistemic consequences of such email exchanges by introducing an appropriate epistemic language and semantics. This allows us to determine when a group of agents acquires common knowledge of the formula expressing that an email was sent. We also show that in our framework from the epistemic point of view the BCC feature of emails cannot be simulated using messages without BCC recipients. Finally, we clarify the notion of a causal relationship between emails using the concept of properly terminating email exchanges...|$|R

50|$|<b>Blind</b> <b>Carbon</b> <b>Copy</b> (BCC) is {{an option}} {{available}} in most email clients that allows the sender to send the message {{to a list of}} BCC addresses (in addition to primary recipients) without other addressees knowing about that fact. BCC addresses are concealed from recipients, including others on the BCC list.|$|E
5000|$|BCC: <b>blind</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>copy</b> to {{tertiary}} recipients {{who receive}} the message. The {{primary and secondary}} recipients cannot see the tertiary recipients. Depending on email software, the tertiary recipients may only see their own email address in BCC, or they may see the email addresses of all primary and secondary recipients.|$|E
50|$|Messages {{forwarded}} {{through an}} email alias retain the original SMTP envelope sender and recipient. If {{the message is}} a <b>blind</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>copy,</b> the recipient can only tell whether the message was forwarded through the alias by examining the message headers. However, the standard does not mandate mentioning the envelope recipient in the headers. Therefore, recipients of a message {{may not be able}} to recover what email address has been used by the sender to eventually deliver the message to their mailbox.|$|E

5000|$|In e-mail, the {{abbreviation}} CC indicates {{those who}} are to receive {{a copy of a}} message addressed primarily to another (CC is the abbreviation of courtesy copy). The list of recipients in copy is visible to all other recipients of the message. An additional BCC (<b>blind</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>copy)</b> field is available for hidden notification; recipients listed in the BCC field receive a copy of the message, but are not shown on any other recipient's copy (including other BCC recipients). It is considered good practice to indicate to the other recipients that a new participant has been added to the list of receivers (e.g. by writing [...] "I sent a copy to John Doe" [...] or [...] "John Doe, who is reading in copy, ...").|$|E
5000|$|In the mid-1990s, {{with the}} rise of spamming, spammers resorted to {{re-routing}} their e-mail through third party e-mail servers to avoid detection and to exploit the additional resources of these open relay servers. Spammers would send one e-mail to the open relay and (effectively) include a large <b>blind</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>copy</b> list, then the open relay would relay that spam to the entire list. [...] While this greatly reduced the bandwidth requirements for spammers at a time when Internet connections were limited, it forced each spam to be an exact copy and thus easier to detect. After abuse by spammers became widespread, operating an open relay came to be frowned upon among the majority of Internet server administrators and other prominent users. [...] Open relays are recommended against in RFC 2505 and RFC 5321 (which defines SMTP). The exact copy nature of spam using open relays made it easy to create bulk e-mail detection systems such as Vipul's Razor and the Distributed Checksum Clearinghouse. To counter this, spammers were forced to switch to using hash busters to make them less effective and the advantage of using open relays was removed since every copy of spam was [...] "unique" [...] and had to be sent individually.|$|E
40|$|Film; 55 mins; <b>Blind</b> <b>Carbon</b> <b>Copy</b> is {{a metaphysical}} drama juxtaposing {{language}} and images with a dialogue of disembodiment. Performance and meaning are rendered tautologically redundant through repetition and difference. <b>Blind</b> <b>Carbon</b> <b>Copy</b> includes a performance undertaken by six actors, a dancer, a baby, various life drawing sessions and two bands; one based around guitar and drums, the other electronics. Where does concrete meaning lie and what takes precedent in these moments?

40|$|Tracing {{criminal}} {{ties and}} mining evidence {{from a large}} network to begin a crime case analysis has been difficult for criminal investigators due to large numbers of nodes and their complex relationships. In this paper, trust networks using <b>blind</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>copy</b> (BCC) emails were formed. We show that our new shortest paths network search algorithm combining shortest paths and network centrality measures can isolate and identify criminals' connections within a trust network. A group of BCC emails out of 1, 887, 305 Enron email transactions were isolated for this purpose. The algorithm uses two central nodes, most influential and middle man, to extract a shortest paths trust network.
