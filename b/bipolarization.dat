Second, the generalized <b>bipolarization</b> measure is defined and related to poverty via the headcount ratio, the income gap ratio and the overabundance gap ratio. In particular, it is shown that polarization is high when the headcount ratio is around 0. 5 and polarization is little when the headcount ratio is far from this value.

40|$|Many {{polarization}} measures {{proposed in}} the literature assume some invariance condition. Clearly, each invariance condition imposes a specific value judgment on polarization measurement. In inequal-ity and poverty measurement, B. Zheng suggests rejecting these invariance conditions as axioms, and proposes replacing them with the unit-consistency axiom.

Since the 1990 s, the central party system has become characterized by intense <b>bipolarization</b> between state-wide parties and wholesale alternation in government. Although a similar process of <b>bipolarization</b> has occurred in most (but not all) regional party systems, the effects in terms of coalition formation and government alternation are very different. Spanish regions are characterized by innovative coalitions between state-wide and non-state-wide parties, with patterns of government alternation that diverge from the central level. A majority of regions are characterized by predominant party systems with no alternation in government, while others see partial alternation where small regionalist parties form promiscuous coalitions with state-wide parties to stay perpetually in office. Meanwhile, the large bilingual regions (Catalonia, Basque Country, Galicia) have all shifted from predominant party systems to more competitive ones characterized by wholesale alternation, but with underlying structures of competition and party coalitions that differ significantly from the central level...|$|E
40|$|At {{the onset}} of mitosis, cells need to break down their nuclear envelope, form a bipolar spindle and attach the {{chromosomes}} to microtubules via kinetochores. Previous {{studies have shown that}} spindle <b>bipolarization</b> can occur either before or after nuclear envelope breakdown. In the latter case, early kinetochore-microtubule attachments generate pushing forces that accelerate centrosome separation. However, until now, the physiological relevance of this prometaphase kinetochore pushing force was unknown. We investigated the depletion phenotype of the kinetochore protein CENP-L, which we find to be essential for the stability of kinetochore microtubules, for a homogenous poleward microtubule flux rate and for the kinetochore pushing force. Loss of this force in prometaphase not only delays centrosome separation by 5 - 6 minutes, it also causes massive chromosome alignment and segregation defects due to the formation of syntelic and merotelic kinetochore-microtubule attachments. By contrast, CENP-L depletion has no impact on mitotic progression in cells that have already separated their centrosomes at nuclear envelope breakdown. We propose that the kinetochore pushing force is an essential safety mechanism that favors amphitelic attachments by ensuring that spindle <b>bipolarization</b> occurs before the formation of the majority of kinetochore-microtubule attachments...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—We {{intend to}} point out the {{differences}} which exist between the classical Gini concentration coefficient and a proposed <b>bipolarization</b> index defined for an arbitrary random variable which have a finite support. In fact Gini's index measures only the "poverty degree " for the individuals from a given population taking into consideration their wages. The Gini coefficient is not so sensitive to the significant income variations in the "rich people class ". In practice there are multiple interdependent relations between the pauperization and the socio-economical polarization phenomena. The presence of a strong pauperization aspect inside the population induces often a polarization effect in this society. But the pauperization and the polarization phenomena are not identical. For this reason it isn't always adequate to use a Gini type coefficient, based on the Lorenz order, to estimate the <b>bipolarization</b> level of the individuals from the studied population. The present paper emphasizes these ideas by considering two families of random variables which have a linear or a triangular type distributions. In addition, the continuous variation, depending on the parameter "time " of the chosen distributions, could simulate a real dynamical evolution of the population.

40|$|Bipolar spindle {{assembly}} in the vertebrate oocyte {{relies on a}} self-organization chromosome-dependent pathway. Upon fertilization, the male gamete provides a centrosome, and the first and subsequent embryonic divisions occur {{in the presence of}} duplicated centrosomes that act as dominant microtubule organizing centres (MTOCs). The transition from meiosis to embryonic mitosis involves a necessary adaptation to integrate the dominant chromosome-dependent pathway with the centrosomes to form the bipolar spindle. Here, we took advantage of the Xenopus laevis egg extract system to mimic in vitro the assembly of the first embryonic spindle and investigate the respective contributions of the centrosome and the chromosome-dependent pathway to the kinetics of the spindle <b>bipolarization.</b> We found that centrosomes control the transition from the meiotic to the mitotic {{spindle assembly}} mechanism.
