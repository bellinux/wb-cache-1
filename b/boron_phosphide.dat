It has a clear to light yellow sludgy appearance. It will detonate under strong shock. High temperatures, whether by sudden heating of any quantity, or by the accumulation of heat when large quantities are burning, will also cause detonation. The material can react vigorously with reducing materials and is incompatible with sodium dichromate or sulfuric acid. It must be stored in a cool, ventilated place, away from acute fire hazards and easily oxidized materials. It also reacts violently with aluminium, <b>boron</b> <b>phosphide,</b> cyanides, esters, PN2H, phosphorus, NaCN, SnC12, sodium hypophosphite, thiocyanates, etc. When heated to decomposition it emits highly toxic fumes of NOx.

Also significant is the finding that the maximum sub-surface shear stress, which is generated by particle impacts, is close to the coating–substrate interface: this partially explains the rapid failure of the coating.

Journal of Vacuum Science & Technology A, 33 (3), 6. doi: 10. 1116 / 1. 4917010 Icosahedral <b>boron</b> <b>phosphide</b> (B 12 P 2) is {{a wide-bandgap}} semiconductor possessing interesting properties {{such as high}} hardness, chemical inertness, and the reported ability to self-heal from irradiation by high energy electrons. Here, the authors developed Cr/Pt and Ni/Au ohmic contacts to epitaxially grown B 12 P 2 for materials characterization and electronic device development. Cr/Pt contacts became ohmic after annealing at 700 degrees C for 30 s with a specific contact resistance of 2 x 10 (- 4) Omega cm(2), {{as measured by the}} linear transfer length method. Ni/Au contacts were ohmic prior to any annealing, and their minimum specific contact resistance was similar to l- 4 x 10 (- 4) Omega cm(2) after annealing over the temperature range of 500 - 800 degrees C. Rutherford backscattering spectrometry revealed a strong reaction and intermixing between Cr/Pt and B 12 P 2 at 700 degrees C and a reaction layer between Ni and B 12 P 2 thinner than similar to 25 nm at 500 degrees C.
