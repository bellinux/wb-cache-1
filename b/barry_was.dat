5|$|John <b>Barry</b> <b>was</b> not {{available}} to score the film because of throat surgery, so the soundtrack's score was composed and conducted by Michael Kamen, who was known for scoring many action films at the time, such as Lethal Weapon and Die Hard. The film's darker and more violent plot elicited calls for cuts by the British Board of Film Classification.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there was}} a setback in {{progress}} with a stonemasons' strike between September 1841 and May 1843, the House of Lords had its first sitting in the new chamber in 1847. In 1852 the Commons was finished, and both Houses sat in their new chambers for the first time; Queen Victoria first used the newly completed royal entrance. In the same year, while <b>Barry</b> <b>was</b> appointed a Knight Bachelor, Pugin suffered a mental breakdown and, following incarceration at Bethlehem Pauper Hospital for the Insane, {{died at the age}} of 40.|$|E

5000|$|The {{given name}} <b>Barry</b> <b>is</b> an Anglicised form of various names {{stemming}} from the Irish names Finnbarr ("fair-topped", [...] "fair-haired") and Barrfind ("fair-headed", [...] "fair-haired"). For example, <b>Barry</b> <b>is</b> sometimes derived from the Irish Bairre, Barra, and Barre, which are in turn forms of the name Barrfind. Furthermore, <b>Barry</b> <b>is</b> sometimes an Anglicised form of the Irish Finnbarr, which also has short forms of Bairre, Barra, and Barre. Similarly, <b>Barry</b> <b>is</b> sometimes an Anglicised form of the latter short form Barra. In other cases, <b>Barry</b> <b>is</b> an Anglicised form of the Irish Berach ("pointed", [...] "sharp"). The given name <b>Barry</b> <b>is</b> one of many names, used throughout the world, that is derived from Gaelic. Since the twentieth century, the name has become very popular in Australia. A variant form of the given name is Barrie. Pet forms of the name are Baz and Bazza.|$|R

5|$|Carrigan {{retired as}} player and manager after 1916, {{returning}} to his native Maine to be a businessman. Ruth, who played under four managers {{who are in the}} National Baseball Hall of Fame, always maintained that Carrigan, who is not enshrined there, was the best skipper he ever played for. There were other changes in the Red Sox organization that offseason, as Lannin sold the team to a three-man group headed by New York theatrical promoter Harry Frazee. Jack <b>Barry</b> <b>was</b> hired by Frazee as manager.|$|E
5|$|Gregory {{was born}} at Roxborough, County Galway, the {{youngest}} daughter of the Anglo-Irish gentry family Persse. Her mother, Frances <b>Barry,</b> <b>was</b> related to Viscount Guillamore, and her family home, Roxborough, was a 6,000-acre (24km²) estate located between Gort and Loughrea, the main house of which was later burnt down during the Irish Civil War. She was educated at home, and her future career was strongly influenced by the family nurse (i.e. nanny), Mary Sheridan, a Catholic and a native Irish speaker, who introduced the young Augusta to the history and legends of the local area.|$|E
5|$|Much of Carter's {{inspiration}} for the episode came from reports of Phineas Gage, who underwent a personality change after a blasting accident drove an iron rod completely through his head (though the idea that Gage became violent, immoral, or a pathological liar, as Scully describes him, is without foundation). The aliens' use of a dental drill on <b>Barry</b> <b>was</b> inspired by a neighbour of Carter {{who said that he}} was abducted and that the aliens drilled holes into his teeth – which a dentist analyzed and said could not be done with any equipment he knew.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane <b>Barry</b> <b>was</b> {{the fourth}} {{tropical}} depression, second hurricane and named storm of the inactive 1983 Atlantic hurricane season. Developing {{out of a}} tropical wave on August23, Barry quickly strengthened {{off the coast of}} Florida, reaching an initial peak intensity with winds of 60mph (95km/h). However, increased wind shear caused the storm to weaken to a tropical depression before making landfall near Melbourne, Florida, the next morning. Traveling almost due west, the storm regenerated and became a hurricane on August28. The storm made landfall on the northern Mexican coastline later that day at peak intensity. Rapid weakening followed shortly after and the storm dissipated the next day. The storm had only minor effects in the United States but destroyed hundreds of homes and left over 400 homeless in northern Mexico. Despite the damage, there were no reports of fatalities or injuries.|$|E
5|$|This season {{produced}} seven tropical depressions, {{of which}} four became named storms; three attained hurricane status, of which one {{became a major}} hurricane, a storm that ranks as a Category3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. Hurricane Alicia had its name retired due to the fatalities and severe damage caused in Texas. The storm killed 21people and caused $2.6billion(1983 USD; $5.6billion 2008 USD) in damages, making it the costliest storm, at the time, in Texas history. Hurricane <b>Barry</b> <b>was</b> a weak Category 1 hurricane that traveled almost due west across the Gulf of Mexico {{for most of its}} track before making landfall in extreme northern Mexico.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm <b>Barry</b> <b>was</b> {{a rapidly}} forming {{tropical}} cyclone that made landfall on Florida, United States, in early June 2007. The second named storm of the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season, Barry developed from a trough of low {{pressure in the}} southeastern Gulf of Mexico on June 1. It tracked rapidly northeastward, reaching peak winds of 60mph (95km/h) before weakening and making landfall near Tampa Bay as a tropical depression. Barry quickly lost tropical characteristics after wind shear removed much of the convection, and early on June 3 it completed the transition into an extratropical cyclone. The extratropical remnants tracked up the East Coast of the United States, and were absorbed by a larger extratropical cyclone on June 5.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Storm <b>Barry</b> <b>was</b> a {{weak and}} {{short-lived}} tropical cyclone that brought heavy rains {{to parts of}} Central America and Mexico in June 2013. Barry originated from a tropical wave that developed in the southern Caribbean Sea. The wave tracked northwestward and began to develop in marginally favorable conditions. On June17, the disturbance was upgraded to Tropical Depression Two by the National Hurricane Center. Due to its close proximity to land, the system failed to intensify before crossing the southern Yucatán Peninsula. The depression emerged over the Bay of Campeche late on June18 and became increasingly organized. During the afternoon of June19, data from Hurricane Hunters revealed the system had intensified into a tropical storm. The newly named Barry attained peak winds of 45mph (75km/h) before making landfall in Veracruz, Mexico on June20. Once onshore, the storm quickly weakened and degenerated into a remnant low that night.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{previous}} Bond films, {{the production}} of Moonraker was not based at Pinewood, as Broccoli moved it to Paris for financial reasons, although the scenes for the cable car interiors and space battle exteriors were filmed at Pinewood, with the special effects team of Derek Meddings active in the UK throughout production. Principal photography began on 11 August 1978 in Paris. The sets designed by returning production designer Ken Adam were the largest ever constructed in France and required more than 222,000 man-hours to construct (approximately 1,000 hours by each of the crew on average). Much of the film {{was shot in the}} cities of London, Paris, Venice, Palmdale, California, Port St. Lucie, Florida and Rio de Janeiro. Principal filming finished back in Paris on 27 February 1979, a 28-week schedule that had allowed Roger Moore only three days off. John <b>Barry</b> <b>was</b> again asked to score an Eon film.|$|E
5|$|With the {{demolition}} of the workhouse, however, <b>Barry</b> <b>was</b> able to build the Gallery's first sequence of grand architectural spaces, from 1872 to 1876. Built to a polychrome Neo-Renaissance design, the Barry Rooms were arranged on a Greek cross-plan around a huge central octagon. Though it compensated for the underwhelming architecture of the Wilkins building, Barry's new wing was disliked by Gallery staff, who considered its monumental aspect to be in conflict with its function as exhibition space. Also, the decorative programme of the rooms did not take their intended contents into account; {{the ceiling of the}} 15th- and 16th-century Italian gallery, for instance, was inscribed with the names of British artists of the 19th century. But despite these failures, the Barry Rooms provided the Gallery with a strong axial groundplan. This was to be followed by all subsequent additions to the Gallery for a century, resulting in a building of clear symmetry.|$|E

5|$|At the 1965 Academy Awards, Norman Wanstall won the Academy Award for Best Sound Effects Editing for his work, making Goldfinger {{the first}} Bond film {{to receive an}} Academy Award. John <b>Barry</b> <b>was</b> {{nominated}} for the Grammy Award for Best Score for a Motion Picture, and Ken Adam was nominated for the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) for Best British Art Direction (Colour), where he also won the award for Best British Art Direction (Black and White) for Dr. Strangelove. The American Film Institute has honoured the film four times: ranking it No.90 for best movie quote ("A martini. Shaken, not stirred"), No.53 for best song ("Goldfinger"), No. 49 for best villain (Auric Goldfinger), and No.71 for most thrilling film. In 2006, Entertainment Weekly and IGN both named Goldfinger as the best Bond film, while MSN named it as the second best, behind its predecessor. IGN and EW also named Pussy Galore as the second best Bond girl. In 2008, Total Film named Goldfinger as the best film in the series. The Times placed Goldfinger and Oddjob second and third on their list of the best Bond villains in 2008. They also named the Aston Martin DB5 as the best car in the films.|$|E
5|$|Barry {{then began}} a {{westerly}} course towards central Florida. However, wind shear began to increase, causing {{the system to}} weaken. The NHC downgraded the storm back to a tropical depression on August25. Barry made landfall near Melbourne, Florida the same morning with winds of 35mph (55km/h). After crossing Florida, the depression traveled towards the west-southwest due to a strong upper-level flow. On August27, Barry became sufficiently organized to be reclassified as a tropical storm while located in the central Gulf of Mexico. The re-strengthening {{was the result of}} decreased wind shear and more favorable conditions over the Gulf. The storm continued to become better organized as it traveled nearly due west towards Mexico. At 1200UTC the next day, <b>Barry</b> <b>was</b> upgraded to a hurricane while located about 75mi (120km) southeast of Brownsville, Texas. The hurricane continued to intensify until it made landfall about 35mi (55km) south-southeast of Brownsville at peak intensity with winds of 80mph (130km/h). The storm quickly weakened after landfall and dissipated the next day over northern Mexico.|$|E
