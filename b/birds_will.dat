5|$|In general, common ravens {{live in a}} {{wide array}} of environments but prefer heavily {{contoured}} landscapes. When the environment changes in vast degrees, these <b>birds</b> <b>will</b> respond with a stress response. The hormone known as corticosterone is activated by the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis. Corticosterone is activated when the bird is exposed to stress, such as migrating great distances.|$|E
5|$|After {{the chicks}} hatch, the <b>birds</b> <b>will</b> desert their nest. Even though the young can swim and dive during this time, they rarely do, instead {{staying on the}} parents' backs for four days after hatching. After about 10 days, the parents split the chicks up, with each parent taking care of {{about half of the}} brood. After this split, the chicks are {{independent}} in about 10 days, and fledge in about three weeks.|$|E
5|$|Australian ravens {{generally}} walk {{when moving}} {{around on the}} ground, though do hop when hurrying. They preen themselves frequently, particularly when roosting {{in the middle of}} the day. They also engage in allopreening, where <b>birds</b> <b>will</b> preen each other's head and neck. This takes place particularly in autumn, winter and spring, and is important in pair bonding. Either member may initiate it, generally by landing near the other bird, shuffling next to its mate, then bending its head forward and presenting its nape.|$|E

5|$|Ninety-five {{percent of}} seabirds are colonial, and seabird colonies {{are among the}} largest bird colonies in the world, {{providing}} one of Earth's great wildlife spectacles. Colonies of over a million birds have been recorded, both in the tropics (such as Kiritimati in the Pacific) and in the polar latitudes (as in Antarctica). Seabird colonies occur exclusively {{for the purpose of}} breeding; non-breeding <b>birds</b> <b>will</b> only collect together outside the breeding season in areas where prey species are densely aggregated.|$|E
5|$|The {{flight is}} weak-looking and {{resembles that of}} a bat, with {{fluttering}} interspersed with short glides. When feeding, the birds hang with raised wings and patter on the surface with their feet, but, unlike the Wilson's storm petrel, do not {{look as if they}} are walking on the water. <b>Birds</b> <b>will</b> sometimes settle on the sea. Like other petrels, the European storm petrel cannot walk properly on land, but shuffles on its tarsi; once there is enough room, the bird flaps its wings to support itself on its toes.|$|E
5|$|When a mouse {{or other}} prey is spotted, the kite drops silently onto it, feet-first with wings raised high; {{sometimes}} in one long drop to ground level, {{more often in}} two or more stages, with hovering pauses at intermediate heights. Prey is seized in the talons and about 75% of attacks are successful. Prey can either be eaten in flight or carried back to a perch. <b>Birds</b> <b>will</b> have a favoured feeding perch, beneath which accumulate piles of pellets or castings.|$|E
5000|$|The {{following}} {{notes were}} made {{in regard to the}} spotted catbird’s curious personality, [...] "On entering a scrub from the roadside one may hear a Catbird call perhaps a hundred yards away. The <b>bird</b> <b>will</b> probably call several times in the next few minutes, advancing nearer and each time, until, at last, the <b>bird</b> <b>will</b> be seen arriving on a branch close to the intruder, where it will continue its harah calling at intervals, whilst watching closely its human neighbour. In all probability after a short interval the <b>bird’s</b> mate <b>will</b> arrive in answer to the calls of the first bird." [...] They exhibit arboreal displays similar to other passerines.|$|R

5|$|As a small {{woodland}} {{bird with}} cryptic plumage and a quiet call, the Eurasian treecreeper is easily overlooked as it hops mouse-like up a vertical trunk, progressing in short hops, using its stiff tail and widely splayed feet as support. Nevertheless, {{it is not}} wary, and is largely indifferent {{to the presence of}} humans. It has a distinctive erratic and undulating flight, alternating fluttering butterfly-like wing beats with side-slips and tumbles. Migrating birds may fly by day or night, but the extent of movements is usually masked by resident populations. It is solitary in winter, but in cold weather up to a dozen or more <b>birds</b> <b>will</b> roost together in a suitable sheltered crevice.|$|E
5|$|In larger lek groups {{there is}} less risk of predation. In a group there are more {{individuals}} to alert the group about an approaching predator. All the birds in the groups will be vigilant in looking for a predator because there is an advantage to seeing the predator first. There is also the risk that in a bigger group there will more false alarm signals. The common signal is vocalization, after which the <b>birds</b> <b>will</b> fly up into the trees. It was found the birds did not however give this signal {{when there was a}} snake.|$|E
5|$|The birds breed {{easily in}} captivity and can lay eggs every 3 weeks between February and November. Once the female has one egg in her nest, {{she will not}} lay another. An egg takes about 30 days to hatch. The eyes of the young open around 3 weeks and the yellow down will show black pin {{feathers}} at about 6 weeks. The best time for hand raising is at about 10 weeks when their black feathers are in place but the tail feathers are still short. Young birds fledge after about 4 months and both sexes have the colouring of their mother. Mature male <b>birds</b> <b>will</b> become aggressive to young male birds at puberty (4 years); they must be separated if caged.|$|E
50|$|The last {{possible}} riddle is Which <b>bird</b> <b>will</b> fly slowest? The proper answer {{for this is}} that the bird that drinks poison will fly slowest.|$|R
5000|$|Caiques also {{exhibit a}} unique {{behavior}} known as [...] "surfing", where the <b>bird</b> <b>will</b> vigorously rub its face, wings and chest against any nearby soft item (e.g. carpets, towels, cushions, crumpled paper, curtains or human hair) while using its beak to pull itself along. During this, the <b>bird</b> <b>will</b> display jerky movements and may roll over several times. This behavior {{is thought to}} be a cleaning or bathing motion and occurs regardless of age or sex. In the wild, caiques use wet leaves for this behavior.|$|R
50|$|The <b>bird</b> <b>will</b> {{breed in}} captivity and thrives {{on a diet}} of canary grass seed, millet, and other small seeds. They bathe daily if water is accessible.|$|R
5|$|Nominate T. merula may {{commence}} breeding in March, but {{eastern and}} Indian races are {{a month or}} more later, and the introduced New Zealand birds start nesting in August (late winter). The breeding pair prospect for a suitable nest site in a creeper or bush, favouring evergreen or thorny species such as ivy, holly, hawthorn, honeysuckle or pyracantha. Sometimes the <b>birds</b> <b>will</b> nest in sheds or outbuildings where a ledge or cavity is used. The cup-shaped nest is made with grasses, leaves and other vegetation, bound together with mud. It is built by the female alone. She lays three to five (usually four) bluish-green eggs marked with reddish-brown blotches, heaviest at the larger end; the eggs of nominate T. merula are 2.9×2.1centimetres (1.14×0.93in) in size and weigh 7.2grammes (0.25oz), of which 6% is shell. Eggs of birds of the southern Indian races are paler than those from the northern subcontinent and Europe.|$|E
5|$|The family uses {{a number}} of {{techniques}} to obtain prey. The majority of antbirds are arboreal, with most of those feeding in the understory, many in the middle story and some in the canopy. A few species feed in the leaf litter; for example, the wing-banded antbird forages in areas of dense leaf-litter. It does not use its feet to scratch the leaf litter, as do some other birds; instead it uses its long bill to turn over leaves rapidly (never picking them up). The antbirds that forage arboreally show {{a number of}} techniques and specialisations. Some species perch-glean, perching on a branch watching for prey and snatching it by reaching forward, where others sally from a perch and snatch prey on the wing. In both cases <b>birds</b> <b>will</b> hop through the foliage or undergrowth and pause, scanning for prey, before pouncing or moving on. The time paused varies, although smaller species {{tend to be more}} active and pause for shorter times.|$|E
5|$|This martin {{builds a}} deep bowl nest on a {{sheltered}} horizontal surface, or a neat quarter-sphere against a vertical rock face or wall. The nest is constructed with mud pellets and lined with grass or feathers, {{and may be}} built on natural sites under cliff overhangs or on man-made structures such as buildings and bridges. It is often reused for subsequent broods or in later years. This species is often a solitary breeder, but small groups may breed close together in suitable locations. The two or three eggs of a typical clutch are white with brown and grey blotches, and are incubated by both adults for 16–19 days prior to hatching. Both parents then feed the chicks. Fledging takes another 22–24 days, although the young <b>birds</b> <b>will</b> return to the nest to roost {{for a few days}} after the first flight.|$|E
5000|$|The call of a lilac-breasted roller is a harsh, sawing [...] "rak rak rak" [...] that is {{used during}} flight. Usually, the <b>bird</b> <b>will</b> perch to sing.|$|R
50|$|Often, this <b>bird</b> <b>will</b> nest in a thorny tree or a tall {{coconut palm}} where its nest {{is said to}} be similar to the American crow though smaller.|$|R

5|$|The {{songs and}} calls of antbirds are {{generally}} composed of repeated simple uncomplicated notes. The family {{is one of}} the suboscines (suborder Tyranni) which have simpler syrinxes ("voiceboxes") than other songbirds. Nevertheless, their songs are distinctive and species-specific, allowing field identification by ear. Antbirds rely on their calls for communication, as is typical of birds in dark forests. Most species have at least two types of call, the loudsong and the softsong. The functions of many calls have been deduced from their context; for example some loudsongs have a territorial purpose and are given when birds meet at the edges of their territories, or during the morning rounds of the territory. Pairs in neighbouring territories judge the proximity of rivals by the degradation of the song caused by interference by the environment. In bouts of territorial defence the male will face off with the other male and the female with her counterpart. Loudsong duets are also potentially related to the maintenance of pair bonds. The functions of softsongs are more complex, and possibly related to pair-bond maintenance. In addition to these two main calls a range of other sounds are made; these include scolding in mobbing of predators. The calls of antbirds are also used interspecifically. Some species of antbirds and even other <b>birds</b> <b>will</b> actively seek out ant-swarms using the calls of some species of ant-followers as clues.|$|E

500|$|In general, juveniles have {{feathers}} {{which are}} narrower and more sharply {{pointed at the}} tip. This can be particularly visible when the bird is in flight, {{especially in the case}} of raptors. The trailing edge of the wing of a juvenile bird can appear almost serrated, due to the feathers' sharp tips, while that of an older <b>bird</b> <b>will</b> be straighter-edged. [...] The flight feathers of a juvenile <b>bird</b> <b>will</b> also be uniform in length, since they all grew at the same time. Those of adults will be of various lengths and levels of wear, since each is moulted at a different time.|$|R
25|$|Behavioural {{studies show}} that many avian species focus on distant objects {{preferentially}} with their lateral and monocular ﬁeld of vision, and <b>birds</b> <b>will</b> orientate themselves sideways to maximise visual resolution. For a pigeon, resolution is twice as good with sideways monocular vision than forward binocular vision, whereas for humans the converse is true.|$|E
25|$|Before {{and after}} the nesting season, groups of {{breeding}} <b>birds</b> <b>will</b> sometimes initiate gatherings; these seem to occur at the boundary of the group's combined range or in the unclaimed land separating it from neighbouring groups. The initiation signal is a conspicuous display flight given by a bird surveying its territory: it spirals tens of meters/yards high into the air, usually briefly does a fluttering hover {{at the top of}} the spiral, and then glides down. Group neighbours will respond by performing the same type of flight, and eventually about half the group's members will depart to the meeting location where they will spend several tens of minutes – sometimes more than an hour – chattering, calling, duetting, and excitedly moving about the meeting site (which typically is some small tree or shrubbery). In winter, <b>birds</b> <b>will</b> often assemble in small groups and roost together, particularly to keep warm during the night; this is apparently not initiated with a specific assembly display however.|$|E
25|$|Montezuma oropendola (Psarocolius montezuma) is a {{tropical}} bird that shares a similar distribution to S. septentrionalis. It {{has been observed}} that more of these <b>birds</b> <b>will</b> nest in trees that are tall, umbrella-shaped, and exhibit a presence of wasps, specifically S. septentrionalis. The wasps will utilize their defensive mechanisms and stings in order to deter both predators and ectoparasites. As a result, S. septentrionalis can exist in a commensalistic relationship with Montezuma oropendola.|$|E
