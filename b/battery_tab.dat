Alpha Battery commanded by CPT Alvaro Gomez entered federal service in Fort Sill, OK. Under the supervision of 1SG Alfredo Barrera, the soldiers trained and deployed to Iraq. While readying their equipment in Kuwait, Alpha Battery was given her mission and the five radar sections were split up. One AN-TPQ37 radar section (SSG Gonzales) {{was attached to the}} 1st Marine Division in Al Taqadum another (CW3 Earnest Metcalf) was assigned to the 1st Infantry Division at LSA Anaconda and the three AN-TPQ36 radar sections (CW2 Davidson, CW2 Bien, and SSG Johnson) were assigned to the 2nd Infantry Division in Mosul. The headquarters and support platoon (1LT Christopher Galvan) operated out of Forward Operating Base Freedom in northern Mosul. In addition to the target acquisition mission, the support platoon supplemented patrols conducted by the 25th Infantry Division Fires Brigade FIST Team and provided security for the FOB's perimeter by manning the entrance gates and watch towers. At the conclusion of the battery's deployment, its members were awarded 3 Bronze Star Medals, 1 Purple Heart Medal, 47 Army Commendation Medals, 74 Combat Action Badges, several memorandums of appreciation from command staff, and authorized to wear the unit shoulder sleeve insignia for wartime service from the 2nd Infantry Division, the 25th Infantry Division, the 36th Infantry Division, or the 1st Infantry Division.|$|E
40|$|Ultrasonic {{metal welding}} {{is widely used}} for joining {{multiple}} layers of dissimilar metals, such as aluminum/copper battery tabs welding onto copper busbars. It is therefore {{important to have a}} robust product/process design using ultrasonic metal welding that ensures consistent welds with desired quality. In this work, the effects of longitudinal and flexural vibrations of the <b>battery</b> <b>tab</b> during ultrasonic welding on the development of axial normal stresses that occasionally cause cracks near the weld area are studied by applying a one-dimensional continuous vibration model for the <b>battery</b> <b>tab.</b> Analysis results indicate that fracture could occur near the weld area, due to low cycle fatigue as a result of large dynamic stresses induced by resonant flexural vibration of the <b>battery</b> <b>tab</b> during welding.

40|$|Lithium-ion {{battery is}} one {{the most popular}} types of {{batteries}} currently used in electric vehicles. To meet the power requirement, hundreds of Lithium ion battery cells are connected together before being assembled into a battery pack. Ultrasonic welding is {{the most widely used}} joining technology to connect battery cells together. In an ultrasonic welding process, high frequency oscillation is used to generate small relative motions between sheet metals to be welded, and produce solid-state bonds between the sheet metals clamped under pressure. One of the major issues for battery pack ultrasonic welding is that sometimes the welding process damages the battery cell. It is hypothesized that, during the ultrasonic welding process, high frequency vibrations of <b>battery</b> <b>tabs</b> may transfer vibration energy into the battery cell, inducing high stresses and even causes damages at the interior joints of the battery cell. In this study, an analytical model to describe the vibration of <b>battery</b> <b>tabs</b> was developed. Experimental data shows good correlation to the analytical model in the stress value. For the experimental measurement, a signal conditioning and data acquisition system was developed which was shown to have good signal-noise ratios when compared to a commercially available measurement system...|$|R

40|$|Ultrasonic {{metal welding}} (USMW) for battery tabs must be {{performed}} with 100 % reliability in battery pack manufacturing as {{the failure of}} a single weld essentially results in a battery that is inoperative or cannot deliver the required power due to the electrical short caused by the failed weld. In ultrasonic metal welding processes, high-frequency ultrasonic energy is used to generate an oscillating shear force (sonotrode force) at the interface between a sonotrode and few metal sheets to produce solid-state bonds between the sheets clamped under a normal force. These forces, which influence the power needed to produce the weld and the weld quality, strongly depend on the mechanical and structural properties of the weld parts and fixtures in addition to various welding process parameters, such as weld frequencies and amplitudes. In this work, the effect of structural vibration of the <b>battery</b> <b>tab</b> on the required sonotrode force during ultrasonic welding is studied by applying a longitudinal vibration model for the <b>battery</b> <b>tab.</b> It is found that the sonotrode force is greatly influenced by the kinetic properties, quantified by the equivalent mass, equivalent stiffness, and equivalent viscous damping, of the <b>battery</b> <b>tab</b> and cell pouch interface. This study provides a fundamental understanding of <b>battery</b> <b>tab</b> dynamics during ultrasonic welding and its effect on weld quality, and thus provides a guideline for design and welding of battery tabs from tab dynamics point of view. © 2014 by ASME...|$|E

Methods: A sample of 221 nursing home residents aged 18 – 100 years in Jordan was recruited for this study. All participants were assessed using the Arabic versions of the Tinetti assessment <b>battery</b> (<b>TAB)</b> for gait and balance, mini–mental state examination, and disability of arm, shoulder, and hand assessment test. Results: A total of 221 nursing home residents were included in this study. Different chronic diseases were medically reported in this study. Psychiatric disorders (45. 7 %) were shown to be the most prevalent disease seen among the participants, followed by hypertension and diabetes mellitus affecting 33. 5 % and 23. 5 % of the participants, respectively. However, the least prevalent diseases were stroke (17. 2 %), joint inflammation (17. 2 %), and arthritis (9. 0 %). Based on TAB scores, the participants were classified into three groups: high risk of falls (≤ 18; n= 116), moderate risk of falls (19 – 23; n= 25), and low risk of falls (≥ 24; n= 80). The correlation between physical activity and mental health problems with risks of falls was reported in all participants. The data showed that participants with over 50 % upper extremity disability, stroke, heart disease, arthritis, joint diseases, diabetes, and hypertension recorded higher risks of falls as measured by TAB test compared to those with low and moderate TAB scores. Also, impairment in cognitive abilities and psychiatric disorders was shown to be associated with gait and balance problems, with a higher risk of falls in 47. 5 % and 46. 1 % of the residents, respectively. Conclusion: This study revealed a significant impact of upper limb disability, stroke, heart disease, arthritis, joint diseases, diabetes, and hypertension as well as psychiatric disorders and cognitive disabilities on gait and balance deficits among home-resident older adults.

40|$|In {{ultrasonic}} {{metal welding}} processes, high-frequency ultrasonic energy {{is used to}} generate friction and heat at the interface between weld parts to produce solid-state bonds. It has been observed that sufficient energy is required to produce proper bonding, while excessive energy can cause such quality issues as weld fracture and perforation. Therefore, {{it is important to}} have a product/process design in ultrasonic welding to ensure efficient energy conversion from ultrasonics to welding energy, minimizing energy loss in the process. In this work, vibrational energy loss associated with the longitudinal and flexural vibrations of the Cu coupon during ultrasonic welding is studied by applying one-dimensional continuous vibration models. To facilitate our modeling, experimental results from the free response of Cu coupon were obtained to determine the damping characteristics of the Cu coupon in the welding process. Our analysis shows that substantial energy loss can occur during welding due to the flexural vibration of the Cu coupon, especially when the overhang (the upper part of the Cu coupon extended from the anvil) of the Cu coupon resonates at or close to the welding frequency (about 20 kHz), degrading the weld quality of <b>battery</b> <b>tabs.</b> This study contributes to understanding the fundamental dynamics of the Cu coupon during ultrasonic welding and its impact on weld quality...|$|R

40|$|Li-ion cells {{provide an}} energy dense {{solution}} for systems that require rechargeable electrical power. However, these cells can undergo thermal runaway, {{the point at}} which the cell becomes thermally unstable and results in hot gas, flame, electrolyte leakage, and in some cases explosion. The heat and fire associated with this type of event is generally violent and can subsequently cause damage to the surrounding system or present a dangerous risk to the personnel nearby. The space flight environment is especially sensitive to risks particularly when it involves potential for fire within the habitable volume of the International Space Station (ISS). In larger battery packs such as Robonaut 2 (R 2), numerous Li-ion cells are placed in parallel-series configurations to obtain the required stack voltage and desired run-time or to meet specific power requirements. This raises a second and less obvious concern for batteries that undergo certification for space flight use: the joining quality at the resistance spot weld of battery cells to component wires/leads and <b>battery</b> <b>tabs,</b> bus bars or other electronic components and assemblies. Resistance spot welds undergo materials evaluation, visual inspection, conductivity (resistivity) testing, destructive peel testing, and metallurgical examination in accordance with applicable NASA Process Specifications. Welded components are cross-sectioned to ensure they are free of cracks or voids open to any exterior surface. Pore and voids contained within the weld zone but not open to an exterior surface, and are not determined to have sharp notch like characteristics, shall be acceptable. Depending on requirements, some battery cells are constructed of aluminum canisters while others are constructed of steel. Process specific weld schedules must be developed and certified for each possible joining combination. The aluminum canisters' positive terminals were particularly difficult to weld due to a bi-metal strip that comes ultrasonically pre-welded by the manufacturer. This was further complicated as the maximum electrode force was limited to low-electrode force to prevent deflection of the aluminum can during welding. Other Li-ion cells are comprised of smaller diameter cylindrical steel canisters which are inherently capable of handling greater force from the electrodes. Allowing higher-electrode forces aids greatly in insuring a consistent resistance network for the weld. Overall lessons learned: developing good jigs is critical to insure the parts and electrodes are planer to one another and the location of the weld sites remains accurate and repeatable; maintaining strict control over materials is critical [...] materials must be of a specific hardness and chemical composition to insure that a weld schedule is repeatable; accuracy of the die used to stamp the projections is critical and worth the investment; and proper seasoning of the electrodes is critical to producing consistent welds [...] once the electrodes have been properly seasoned, cleaning/dressing should be avoided until it is absolutely necessary...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, the {{electrochemical}} and thermal behavior of an LFP lithium-ion pouch battery is modeled, within a finite elements method framework, {{in order to}} study the fast charge procedure that is sought {{in most of the}} battery applications and to assess the design process of the BTMS. The simulation approach couples a 2 D empirical electrochemical cell model, based on a simple equivalent circuit model approach, with a 3 D thermal model that solves for the thermal activity and temperature distribution among the battery volume. The electrical performance of the battery under study is characterized experimentally at different ambient temperatures. The open-circuit voltage curve of the battery is approximated from both long relaxation time and continuous low current measurements, and the associated battery impedance is determined from the operating voltage measurements under different continuous current charge and discharge rates. The thermal performance is experimentally measured by testing the battery within an isothermal calorimeter, and the obtained data is employed to corroborate the validity of the implemented model. The results from the developed electrochemical-thermal model present good agreement with the overall battery thermal measurements data. The developed model is used, {{in the second part of}} the thesis, to study the behavior and the design of the battery thermal management system. On one hand, local battery cooling is analyzed, concluding that local cooling near the <b>battery</b> current <b>tabs</b> can enhance the battery life expectancy. On the other hand, a novel battery pack assembly design for automobile application is presented and modeled, including simple lumped models for heat pipe and thermoelectric elements, and an optimization methodology is set to find the optimal geometry for such design...|$|R
40|$|To {{quantify}} {{the impact of}} non-uniform current distribution in a large-format Li-ion cell on its overall energy density, five cell configurations with different positive tab numbers and locations were developed. This was enabled by a specially designed segmented cell with reconfigurable positive tabs on the outside. Current distribution and overall discharge performance were measured and correlated {{with each other for}} all five cell configurations. It is shown that tab number and location have significant effects on the performance and current distribution of a Li-ion <b>battery</b> cell. Fewer <b>tabs</b> typically cause lower performance but excessive tabs do not help. The 1 -tab-co-located configuration causes both very non-uniform current distribution and very low overall discharge performance, and should be avoided in tab design for cells bigger than ∼ 2. 4 Ah. The effects of tab configuration on overall performance can be attributed to and explained by current distribution. Discharge energy of the experimental cell decreases almost linearly with a current density non-uniformity factor. Non-uniform current distribution results in non-uniform utilization of active materials, reducing energy density, and likely also accelerating degradation of the Li-ion cell. Future research on diagnosing and improving current density uniformity in large format Li-ion batteries that enable vehicle- and grid-energy storage is highly warranted...|$|R
40|$|Title {{from first}} page of PDF file (viewed September 13, 2010) Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 40 - 42) Williams syndrome (WS) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by a deletion of about 20 genes including the elastin gene on chromosome 7. Individuals with WS have a uneven cognitive profile as adults: they are mildly to moderately retarded with significantly impaired visuo-spatial skills, however, language is a strength and they show a characteristic behavioral profile of extremely sociable and friendly personalities. In spite of the late onset of language in WS as children, they later develop a robust vocabulary similar to mentally age matched typically developing children. Interestingly, they {{do not appear to}} follow the typical path of language development. In typical development, a link has been noted between language development and earlier development of nonverbal communicative tools such as gestures, eye gaze, joint attention, and social referencing. Current research suggests that children with WS do not produce many gestures, such as those seen in typical development, until after they have acquired language. Moreover, they may have difficulties in areas of social referencing as they often become fixated with unfamiliar faces. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to examine the production of nonverbal communicative behaviors of young children with WS and their relation to vocalizations. Participants included 12 children with WS and 30 typically developing controls matched on mental ages, as calculated by the Bayley Mental Development Index. All data were previously collected via video recording by Dr. Ursula Bellugi as part of the Project in Cognitive and Neural Development at UCSD. Nonverbal communicative behaviors were measured by means of tasks from the Laboratory Temperament Assessment <b>Battery</b> (Lab <b>Tab).</b> Four questions were addressed: (1) Do toddlers with WS produce nonverbal communicative behaviors? (2) If children with WS are producing nonverbal behaviors with communicative intent, what do these behaviors look like? (3) Provided children with WS produce nonverbal communicative behaviors, will such behaviors co-occur with vocalizations? (4) Will children with WS look more at a person than an object? In exploring such questions, the present study sought to explore the overall question: Do children with WS use nonverbal forms of communication during language development similar to children of typical development? Results suggest that when including a more broad range on nonverbal behaviors, children with WS do produce nonverbal behaviors with communicative intent...|$|R
