40|$|The (betaalpha) (8) -barrel enzymes N'-[(5 '-phosphoribosyl) formimino]- 5 -aminoimidazole- 4 -carboxamide {{ribonucleotide}} isomerase (tHisA) and imidazole glycerol phosphate synthase (tHisF) from Thermotoga maritima catalyze two successive {{reactions in}} the biosynthesis of histidine. In both enzymes, aspartate residues at the C-terminal end of beta-strand 1 (Asp 8 <b>in</b> <b>tHisA</b> and Asp 11 in tHisF) and beta-strand 5 (Asp 127 <b>in</b> <b>tHisA</b> and Asp 130 in tHisF) {{are essential for}} catalytic activity. It was demonstrated earlier that <b>in</b> <b>tHisA</b> the substitution of Asp 127 by valine (tHisA-D 127 V) generates phosphoribosylanthranilate isomerase (TrpF) activity, a related (betaalpha) (8) -barrel enzyme participating in tryptophan biosynthesis. It is shown here that in tHisF the corresponding substitution of Asp 130 by valine (tHisF-D 130 V) also generates TrpF activity. To determine the effectiveness of individual amino acid exchanges in these conversions, each of the 20 standard amino acid residues was introduced at position 127 of tHisA and 130 of tHisF by saturation random mutagenesis. The tHisA-D 127 X and tHisF-D 130 X variants with TrpF activity were identified by selection in vivo, and the proteins purified and characterized. The results obtained show that removal of the negatively charged carboxylate side-chain at the C-terminal end of beta-strand 5 is sufficient to establish TrpF activity <b>in</b> <b>tHisA</b> and tHisF, presumably because it allows the binding of the negatively charged TrpF substrate, phosphoribosylanthranilate. In contrast, the double mutants tHisA-D 8 N+D 127 V and tHisF-D 11 N+D 130 V did not show detectable activity, demonstrating that the aspartate residues at the C-terminal end of beta-strand 1 are essential for catalysis of the TrpF reaction. The ease with which TrpF activity can be established on both the tHisA and tHisF scaffolds supports the evolutionary relationship of these three enzymes and highlights the functional plasticity of the (betaalpha) (8) -barrel enzyme fold...|$|R

The paper begins with {{a brief description of}} TPM and the <b>barriers</b> <b>in</b> implementation of TPM. Interpretive Structural Modeling ISM and its role <b>in</b> analyzing the <b>barriers</b> <b>in</b> TPM implementation is explained in brief. Applications of ISM in analyzing issues in various fields are highlighted with special emphasis on TPM. The paper moves on to introduction to Structural Equation Modeling SEM and its role in validating ISM <b>in</b> analyzing <b>barriers</b> <b>in</b> implementation of TPM. The paper concludes with a gap analysis from the current literature research that can be carried out and expected outcomes from the proposed research...|$|R
