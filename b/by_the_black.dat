5|$|A {{good picture}} of the county in 1086 is given by Domesday Book, though there is some {{difficulty}} in identifying the various places since the hundreds are not specified. The total population given for the county, which had different boundaries to those today, was 13,399, however this only included the heads of households, so with their families {{this may have been}} around 67,000. Farming seems to have prospered for the next three centuries but was severely hit <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> Death which in 1348 arrived in Dorset and quickly spread through Somerset, causing widespread mortality, perhaps as much as 50% in places. It re-occurred, resulting in a change in feudal practices since the manpower was no longer so available.|$|E
5|$|As with Gearbox's {{previous}} expansion pack , Blue Shift {{returns to}} the setting and events of the original game, but portrays the story {{through the eyes of}} another person.

After a scientific mishap causes Black Mesa to be invaded by aliens, Calhoun must fight his way to safety. The game received mostly positive reception. Many reviewers were critical of the short length of the game and the lack of new content, although the inclusion of a High Definition pack that upgraded the models and textures in both Blue Shift and the preceding Half-Life games was praised.|$|E

5|$|Operation Spring was {{scheduled}} in four tightly timed phases. The Calgary Highlanders would attack Bourguébus Ridge and May-sur-Orne {{to secure the}} flanks of the main thrust, {{which was to be}} a move on Verrières Ridge <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> Watch, along with armoured support from the British 7th Armoured Division and the 4th Canadian (Armoured) Division. The plan called for the offensive to start on 23 July but poor weather led to a postponement for 48 hours. Taking advantage of this respite, the I SS Panzer Corps reinforced the ridge with an additional four battalions, 480 tanks and 500 guns. Allied Intelligence learned of this reinforcement through Ultra signals intercepts and advised Simonds's headquarters.|$|E

5|$|Population {{declined}} {{in the first half}} of the 14th century, starting with the Great Famine in 1315, followed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> Death of 1348–50. Despite the decline, however, German artists, engineers, and scientists developed a wide array of techniques similar to those used by the Italian artists and designers of the time who flourished in such merchant city-states as Venice, Florence and Genoa. Artistic and cultural centres throughout the German states produced such artists as the Augsburg painters Hans Holbein and his son, and Albrecht Dürer. Johannes Gutenberg introduced moveable-type printing to Europe, a development that laid the basis for the spread of learning to the masses.|$|E
5|$|Starting {{at the end}} of the 14th century, {{no doubt}} on account of the devastation caused mid-century <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> Death, there was a general shift towards less {{expensive}} techniques. Many things which would have earlier been completely forbidden by the guilds were now commonplace (using low quality wool, carding, etc.). In the silk industry, the use of water-powered mills grew, and by the 15th century, the loom designed by Jean le Calabrais saw nearly universal use.|$|E
