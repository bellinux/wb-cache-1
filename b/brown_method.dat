40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe <b>brown</b> <b>method</b> of solving zero sum two person games by {{a method of}} successive approximations was programmed for the NCR- 102 A Digital Computer. Game matricies up to order 8 x 8 were investigated, although the program could easily be extended to order 16 x 16 without leaving the magnetic drum, or to arbitrarily higher order games by also using magnetic tape. The problem of obtaining all strategies of a convex set of optimal strategies was solved {{in a number of}} cases and the concept of a complementary game was developed. The <b>Brown</b> <b>method</b> was found to converge too slowly in most cases so that a modification of the method was used. In the <b>Brown</b> <b>method,</b> successive approximate strategies are developed for each player until a stage is reached in which the opposing strategies give equal values to the game (or give values sufficiently close), at which time (approximate) optimal strategies have been obtained. Julia Robinson has proved the convergence of the <b>Brown</b> <b>method.</b> The modification consists in comparing a maximum value of the game for Player I with a minimum value of the game for Player II at different stages of the iteration until these values are equal or sufficiently close to each other.

In contrast to the traditional <b>Brown</b> <b>method</b> [Brown, R. L. J. Res. Natl. Bur. Stand. (U. S.) 1978, 83, 1 - 8] and CKD method (Cooney, D. O.; Kim, S. S.; Davis, E. J. Chem. Eng. Sci. 1974, 29, 1731 - 1738), the new approximation developed in this study (known as the KPS method) does not require interpolation or numerical techniques. The KPS method agrees well with the CKD method under all experimental conditions and also with the <b>Brown</b> <b>method</b> at low Sherwood numbers. At high Sherwood numbers corresponding to high uptake on the wall, flow entry effects become relevant and are considered in the KPS and CKD methods {{but not in the}} <b>Brown</b> <b>method.</b> The practical applicability of the KPS method is demonstrated by analysis of measurement data from experimental studies of rapid OH, intermediate NO 3, and slow O 3 uptake on various organic substrates. The KPS method also allows determination of the penetration of aerosol particles through a tube, using a single equation to cover both the limiting cases of high and low deposition described by Gormley and Kennedy (Proc. R. Ir. Acad., Sect. A. 1949, 52 A, 163 - 169).

Becauseof the wide rangeof normal excretionvalues,the point is madethat onlyserialanalysesof a patient’sphysio-logic course (e. g., in pregnancy associatedwith diabetes) are of clinicalvalue. lvi ODERN ESTROGEN METHODOLOGY dates back only some 5 years {{to the time when}} Brown reported a chemical method for the measure-ment of the three “classic ” urinary estrogens-estriol, estradiol- 17 fl (estradiol), and estrone (1).

These were the first technics capable of measuring, with any accuracy, the small amounts of these three com-pounds occurring in nonpregnancy urine. Methods of Brown and Bauld Both of these methods are based on the acid hydrolysis of the con-jugated estrogens in 1 / 5 of a 24 -hour urine volume, with extraction of the free estrogens and purification of the extracts, taking advan-tage of the phenolic properties of the compounds in question. This is followed by simple partition between benzene and water, yielding an estriol-containing aqueous phase and a benzene-soluble estrone-estradiol fraction. At this point the procedures diverge.

40|$|The out-of-plane bending of {{offshore}} mooring chains {{leads to a}} rapid deterioration of the chain, ultimately leading to failure in a period that is {{a fraction of the}} design-life. The deformation of the contact surface of the chainlinks leads to the interlocking of the link. This in turn causes the chain to behave like a bending beam. The combination of the chains behaving in this manner and the vessel movement leads to a bending moment in the chain link, especially in the top section, where the tensions are high. Due to the alternating nature of the loading, multiaxial fatigue effects cause chain failure. In this thesis, a literature study is performed, forming an introduction to the general concept of fatigue and the exploration of available methods. For multiaxial loadings, so-called critical plane methods are widely accepted as the most effective approach. This critical plane method search for the material plane experiencing most damage, according to the damage criterion that is assessed. Furthermore, a number of methods for the cycle decomposition are present. For uniaxial methods, the rainflow method is most used. Applying this method to multiaxial fatigue problems can lead to problems, which leads to the formation of alternative approaches. The other approaches being discussed are the Wang & <b>Brown</b> <b>method</b> and the Modified Wang & <b>Brown</b> <b>method.</b> The Bannantine & Socie method is discussed too, but could be classified as a critical plane search algorithm, instead of a novel cycle counting method. After the exploration of the problem, a finite element model is created. This model consists of multiple chain links, that are proofloaded while plastic deformation is allowed. This leads to the aforementioned deformation of the contact surfaces on the links. After the proofloading step is completed, three different cases are performed with an elastic material formulation. These cases comprise of varying angle ranges; Case 1 only induces an out-of-plane bending in the analysed link, Case 2 induces an out-of-plane and in-plane load, while Case 3 is similar to Case 2, apart from an added phase difference between the two angles. The stress and strain results from the finite element analyses are input in the Pragtic fatigue software. For each case, a number of fatigue criteria are calculated. These criteria are, named after the author, the following: McDiarmid, Dang Van, Matake, Liu & Mahadevan, Carpinteri & Spagnoli, Findley, Wang & Brown & Miller, Smith & Watson & Topper and Socie. Different critical plane search algorithms and/or cycle counting methods have been explored. Some of these criteria lead to a Fatigue Index, while others lead to an Accumulated Damage formulation. From the results {{it is clear that the}} cases combining two angles lead to higher damages, leading to the believe that the multiaxial behaviour should be taken into account when assessing fatigue damage of mooring chains. Furthermore, it seems that for the different cases, the SWT criterion gives either the highest or the lowest damage. As this is originally a multiaxial parameter, it shows that the use of traditional uniaxial methods could either over- or underestimate the damage, depending on the specific loading. Furthermore, results show that the criterion that is suggested by Bureau Veritas' Guidance Note on OPB, namely the Dang Van criterion, often gives the lowest fatigue index. This suggests that this criterion might not be conservative enough. This statement needs to be validated with the help of experiments. Furthermore, the method specifically aimed at multiaxial problems, the Wang & <b>Brown</b> <b>method</b> (including the multiaxial cycle counting method), leads to highest accumulated damage. As this method was aimed for multiaxial and non-proportional loading, it can be reasoned that this method makes a conservative, proper prediction. As for the critical plane orientation, it seems that the most damaging plane, likely the location of crack growth, is often close to the shear plane. This fuels the believe that the shear stress is the factor driving the OPB failure mode. However, since this problem inherently involves a mean stress (the tension on the mooring chain), the critical plane does not need to be the shear plane. When exploring this with the globe plane search algorithm, it seems that the critical plane is often a plane oriented at some angle in between the shear and normal plane. The results and statements made in this report are at this point mathematical. As the OPB concept is relatively newly discovered, more experiments are needed to be able to back up any statements that can be made. Furthermore, the research presented here could benefit from a larger group of cases, and added detail on the loading part of the analyses. Furthermore, as material fatigue parameters are limited, a sensitivity anayses on these parameters could shed some light on the influence of parameters used. The parameters used in this report are taken from similar materials and should at least give a very reasonable approximation of the material's fatigue behaviour.

Other breakfast meals include cornmeal porridge which is made with fine cornmeal or polenta, milk and condensed milk and sugar to sweeten, more British influenced meals like Eggs, bacon and toast are also popular alongside fried fish and plantains. During Lunchtime or Dinner Common vegetables eaten are Plantain, Tania, Yam, Potato, rice and peas. Meat and poultry typically eaten include Chicken (which is very popular), beef, fish which are normally stewed down with onions, carrots, garlic, ginger and herbs like thyme and using the <b>browning</b> <b>method</b> to create a rich dark sauce. Popular meals include rice and peas, Stew chicken, Stew beef, fried and stewed fish and {{many different types of}} hearty fish broths and Soups which are packed full with dumplings, carrots and ground provisions.|$|R
50|$|During World War II, {{while working}} with Hermann Irving Schlesinger, <b>Brown</b> {{discovered}} a <b>method</b> for producing sodium borohydride (NaBH4), {{which can be}} used to produce boranes, compounds of boron and hydrogen. His work led to the discovery of the first general method for producing asymmetric pure enantiomers. The elements found as initials of his name H, C and B were his working field.|$|R

40|$|Peripheral {{heavy ion}} {{reactions}} at ultra relativistic energies have large angular momentum {{that can be}} studied via two particle correlations using the Differential Hanbury <b>Brown</b> and Twiss <b>method.</b> We analyze the possibilities and sensitivity of the method in a rotating system. We also study an expanding solution of the fluid dynamical model of heavy ion reactions. Comment: 7 pages, 4 figures. Proceedings of the WPCF 2014 workshop, Gyöngyös, Hungar...|$|R
