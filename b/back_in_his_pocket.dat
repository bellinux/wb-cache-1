2500|$|Guiteau put {{his pistol}} <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>pocket</b> {{and turned to}} leave via a cab that he had waiting for him outside the station, but {{collided}} with policeman Patrick Kearney, who was entering the station after hearing the gunfire. Kearney apprehended Guiteau. He was so excited at having arrested {{the man who had}} presumably shot Garfield that he neglected to take Guiteau's gun from him until after their arrival at the police station. Kearney demanded, [...] "In God's name, what did you shoot the president for?" [...] Guiteau did not respond. The rapidly gathering crowd screamed, [...] "Lynch him!", but Kearney and several other police officers took the assassin to the police station a few blocks away. As he surrendered to authorities, Guiteau uttered the exulting words, repeated everywhere: [...] "'I am a Stalwart of the Stalwarts! I did it and I want to be arrested! Arthur is President now!'" [...] This statement briefly led to unfounded suspicions that either Arthur or his supporters had put Guiteau up to the crime. The Stalwarts were a Republican faction loyal to former President Grant; they strongly opposed Garfield's Half-Breeds. Like many other vice presidents, Chester A. Arthur had been selected as a running mate for political advantage — to placate his faction rather than for his skills or loyalty. Guiteau, in his delusion, had convinced himself that he was striking a blow to unite the two factions of the Republican Party.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Delamayn {{folded up}} the manuscript, {{and put it}} <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>pocket.</b>|$|E
60|$|Sir Timothy glanced {{presently}} at {{his thin}} gold watch {{and put it}} <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>pocket</b> regretfully.|$|E
60|$|The docker {{looked over}} his {{shoulder}} agin, and then 'e put <b>his</b> 'and <b>in</b> <b>his</b> trouser-pocket and just showed 'em a big, fat gold locket with diamonds stuck all over it. Then he shoved it <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>'is</b> <b>pocket,</b> while Sam's pal was giving 'im a pinch worse than wot the other was.|$|R
60|$|He {{replaced}} {{the letter in}} the envelope and stood erect to put this <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> breast <b>pocket.</b>|$|R
60|$|All our rations, save {{what each}} man had held <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>pockets,</b> {{were with the}} baggage-train, {{therefore}} we {{did not make a}} very hearty meal at noon, and perhaps it was as well, for while we were eating the small amount of food at our disposal two companies of Maryland militia, under command of Major Peter, came into camp on the double quick, with every evidence of terror on their faces.|$|R
60|$|Tom had put {{the line}} <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>pocket,</b> and {{was looking at the}} hooks one by one, before he spoke again.|$|E
6000|$|Julian composedly {{consulted}} his watch. [...] "She is {{ten minutes}} after her time," [...] he said, {{and put his}} watch <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>pocket</b> again.|$|E
6000|$|... "Exactly," [...] said Mr. Sturgis, {{taking the}} {{photograph}} {{from her and}} putting it <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>pocket.</b> [...] "I recognised him directly {{he opened the door}} to me." ...|$|E
60|$|He looked impatiently at his watch. As {{he put it}} <b>back</b> again <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>pocket</b> {{there was}} a ring at the bell. Was it the lad {{bringing}} the luggage? Yes. And, with it, the lawyer's report? No. Better than that--the lawyer himself.|$|R
60|$|He strode {{off to the}} stable, {{despite the}} protests of Mr. Hogg, and, {{standing}} by the door, appeared to be deep in thought; then he came <b>back</b> slowly, feeling <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>pockets</b> as he walked.|$|R
6000|$|He put <b>back</b> <b>his</b> {{tobacco-pouch}} <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>pocket.</b> <b>His</b> {{handsome face}} was {{as hard as}} stone. His clear blue eyes defied all the girls in England put together to see into his mind. [...] "Have you done, Miss Lundie?" [...] he asked, suddenly changing to a bantering politeness of tone and manner.|$|R
6000|$|Trudaine, who had hastily and confusedly put {{his letter}} <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>pocket</b> the moment Lomaque began to read, seemed {{at a loss}} for an answer. He patted his sister's hand rather absently, and said: ...|$|E
60|$|Hazard {{glanced at}} Gus {{and then put}} the flask <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>pocket.</b> But when they pulled the doubled rope through the last {{eye-bolt}} and {{set foot on the}} Saddle, he again drew out the bottle.|$|E
6000|$|The Sergeant had the {{handcuffs}} ready. After {{looking at the}} prisoner's delicate wrists by the lantern-light, he put his fetters <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>pocket.</b> [...] "A lady--and no doubt about it," [...] he said {{to one of his}} assistants.|$|E
6000|$|He {{smiled to}} himself, {{and put the}} letter <b>back</b> <b>in</b> the envelope, and {{considered}} the subject for a while. Below the odd rough surface, {{he was a man}} in ten thousand; no more single-hearted and more affectionate creature ever breathed the breath of life. He had not been understood <b>in</b> <b>his</b> own little circle; there had been a want of sympathy with him, and even a want of knowledge of him, at home. Amelius, popular with everybody, had touched the great heart of this man. He perceived the peril that lay hidden under the strange and lonely position of <b>his</b> fellow-voyager--so innocent <b>in</b> the ways of the world, so young and so easily impressed His fondness for Amelius, it is hardly too much to say, was the fondness of a father for a son. With a sigh, he shook his head, and gathered up his letters, and put them <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>pockets.</b> [...] "No, not yet," [...] he decided. [...] "The poor boy really loves her; and the girl may be good enough to make the happiness of his life." [...] He got up and walked about the room. Suddenly he stopped, struck by a new idea. [...] "Why shouldn't I judge for myself?" [...] he thought. [...] "I've got the address--I reckon I'll look in on the Farnabys, in a friendly way." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{went down}} to meet Cargill {{on the night of}} the promised call. He found him seated on the small of <b>his</b> <b>back,</b> <b>his</b> hands <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>pockets.</b> <b>His</b> absurd little hat (that seemed to partake of his every mood) was rolled into a point in front, and pulled down aggressively over his eyes. He was {{particularly}} violent, and paid no attention whatever to Bradley.|$|R
60|$|The old {{man with}} the ax moved {{cautiously}} along the corridor upon {{the second floor of}} the Castle of Blentz until he came to a certain door. Gently he turned the knob and pushed the door inward. Holding the ax behind <b>his</b> <b>back,</b> he entered. <b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>pocket</b> was a great roll of money, and there was to be an equal amount waiting him at Lustadt when his mission had been fulfilled.|$|R
60|$|He {{leaned forward}} to replace the {{paper-knife}} on the table, and, after blowing his nose with some emphasis, put the handkerchief <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>pocket</b> and sat listening with a judicial air for anything that his chief clerk might wish to put before him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Two hours more," [...] sighed Tommy, {{as he put}} {{the letter}} <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>pocket.</b> [...] "How can I get any clothes when they’re all locked up? And aunt said I was to look after ’im and see he didn’t get into no mischief." ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. White {{dropped it}} <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>pocket,</b> and placing chairs, motioned his {{friend to the}} table. In the {{business}} of supper the talisman was partly forgotten, and afterward the three sat listening in an enthralled fashion to a second instalment of the soldier's adventures in India.|$|E
5|$|Goebel {{played a}} role in a famous Ohio State-Illinois game on November 13, 1943. The game was Paul Brown's last game as coach of the Buckeyes. With the score tied 26–26, Ohio State threw an {{incomplete}} forward pass into the end zone as the gun sounded. The game appeared to have ended in a tie, the teams left the field, and the stands emptied. However, Ohio State assistant coach Ernie Godfrey had noticed Goebel, who was the head linesman, drop a handkerchief to signal a penalty. On hearing the gun sound, Goebel had picked up the handkerchief and put it <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>back</b> <b>pocket.</b> Godfrey confronted Goebel, who conceded that Illinois was offsides. Twenty minutes later, the teams came back onto the field and the Buckeyes kicked a 33-yard field goal to give Coach Brown a 29–26 win <b>in</b> <b>his</b> final game.|$|R
60|$|His inquiry, loud-voiced and {{not entirely}} coherent, {{received}} at first scant {{attention from the}} usher to whom he addressed himself. They were directed to their places at last, however. The house was in darkness, and with the music Edith forgot, for a time, the slight shock which she had received. The opera was Samson et Dalila, and a very famous tenor was making his reappearance after a long absence. Edith gave herself up to complete enjoyment of the music. Then suddenly she was startled by a yawn at her side. Burton was sitting <b>back,</b> <b>his</b> hands <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>pockets,</b> <b>his</b> mouth wide-open.|$|R
60|$|A {{minute later}} {{a man with}} naked feet stole up behind them. He was close to them before any sound warned them of his approach. Jacob looked round and uttered a sharp exclamation. Captain Hampton was {{in the act of}} {{springing}} to his feet when he received a violent blow on the shoulder, and fell face foremost on the ground. With a cry of rage Jacob sprang at his assailant and caught him by the throat. The man shook him off and brought down his hand {{on the top of his}} head with such force that he fell insensible. Then he stooped over Captain Hampton, and having turned him over on <b>his</b> <b>back</b> felt <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>pockets,</b> but rose with an exclamation of disgust, having only found two or three dollars in them, as Captain Hampton had taken the precaution of laying aside his watch and emptying <b>his</b> <b>pockets</b> of money and papers before leaving his room. Ten minutes later some sailors coming along the wharf came across Jacob, who was just trying to get on to his feet.|$|R
6000|$|... 'He will live,' {{said the}} little swordsman, putting his lancet <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>pocket.</b> 'And now, who may you be to whom I owe this {{interference}} which shortened the affair, though mayhap {{the result would}} have been the same had you left us to settle it amongst ourselves?' ...|$|E
6000|$|BURKE--[With a stupendous sigh.] Oh, glory be to God, I'm after believing you now! [He {{takes the}} cross from her hand, his face beaming with joy, {{and puts it}} <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>pocket.</b> He puts his arm about her waist {{and is about to}} kiss her when he stops, appalled by some terrible doubt.] ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's all. He {{never said}} a word; just glared, and put his sleeve <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>pocket</b> quickly. 'I was saying,' said he, 'that there was the {{prescription}} burning, wasn't I?' Interrogative cough. 'How the devil,' said I, 'can you move an empty sleeve like that?' 'Empty sleeve?' 'Yes,' said I, 'an empty sleeve.' ...|$|E
50|$|The circus troupe is sent {{to perform}} in New York City. Anatoly, who has talked of little else but defecting, can't bring himself {{to go through with}} it; and Vladimir, who had opposed the scheme as {{reckless}} and foolhardy, suddenly decides to do it. He runs from his Soviet controllers and hides behind a perfume counter at Bloomingdale's under the skirt of the clerk, Lucia Lombardo. When local police and the FBI arrive, Vladimir stands up to his controllers and defects with news cameras rolling. Vladimir is left with nothing but the clothes on <b>his</b> <b>back,</b> the money <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>pocket,</b> and a pair of blue jeans he had planned to buy for <b>his</b> girlfriend <b>in</b> Moscow.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the season}} 4 premiere, [...] "Fun Run", Jim and Pam confess {{that they have}} started dating after the camera crew catches them kissing. The office {{ultimately}} learns of their relationship in [...] "Dunder Mifflin Infinity". In [...] "Chair Model", after teasing Pam about his impending proposal, Jim tells the documentary crew he is not kidding around about an engagement and shows them a ring he bought a week after he and Pam started dating. In the next few episodes, Jim fake-proposes to Pam multiple times. In [...] "Goodbye, Toby", Pam discovers she's been accepted at Pratt Institute, an art and design school in Brooklyn [...] In an interview later in the episode, Jim announces that he will propose to Pam that evening. Just as Jim is preparing to propose, however, Andy Bernard stands up and makes his own impromptu proposal to Angela. Having had his thunder stolen by Andy, Jim reluctantly puts the ring <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> jacket <b>pocket,</b> leaving Pam visibly disappointed as she was expecting Jim to propose that night.|$|R
60|$|A year later, George's {{only son}} Robert was born; {{and from that}} moment the history of those two able and useful lives is almost inseparable. During the whole of George Stephenson's long upward struggle, and during the hard battle he had {{afterwards}} to fight {{on behalf of his}} grand design of railways, he met with truer sympathy, appreciation, and comfort from his brave and gifted son than from any other person whatsoever. Unhappily, his pleasure and delight in the up-bringing of his boy was soon to be clouded for a while by the one great bereavement of an otherwise singularly placid and happy existence. Some two years after her marriage, Fanny Stephenson died, as yet a mere girl, leaving her lonely husband {{to take care of their}} baby boy alone and unaided. Grief for this irretrievable loss drove the young widower away for a while from his accustomed field of work among the Tyneside coal-pits; he accepted an invitation to go to Montrose in Scotland, to overlook the working of a large engine in some important spinning-works. He remained in this situation for one year only; but during that time he managed to give clear evidence of his native mechanical insight by curing a defect in the pumps which supplied water to his engine, and which had hitherto defied the best endeavours of the local engineers. The young father was not unmindful, either, of his duty to his boy, whom he had left behind with his grandfather on Tyneside; for he saved so large a sum as 28 pounds during his engagement, which he carried <b>back</b> with him <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>pocket</b> on <b>his</b> return to England.|$|R
60|$|There was a {{momentary}} pause. Once more the dripping rustle {{of the rain}} and the steady ticking of the clock filled up the gap of silence. Mr. Pendril put the Instructions <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>pocket,</b> considered a little, and, turning toward Norah and Miss Garth, recalled their attention to the present and pressing necessities of the time.|$|E
60|$|A large frozen moon like a lustrous snowball {{began to}} show through the tangle of twigs in front of them, and by its light the narrator {{had been able to}} refresh his memory of Captain Keith's text from a scrap of printed paper. As he folded it up and put it <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>pocket</b> Flambeau threw up his hand with a French gesture.|$|E
60|$|And the Duke, having {{met a man}} {{who knew}} about his grandfather, felt in his own element. In fact, he was so delighted with Dr. Boomer and the Nigerian rubber tree and the shaded {{pictures}} and the charm of the whole place and the certainty that {{half a million dollars}} was easily findable in it, that he put his eyeglass <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>pocket</b> and said.|$|E
60|$|Nicholas snuffed the candles, put <b>his</b> hands <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>pockets,</b> and, leaning <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> chair, {{assumed a}} look of patient {{suffering}} and melancholy resignation.|$|R
60|$|Austen {{laid down}} the paper, leaned <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> chair, and thrust <b>his</b> hands <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>pockets,</b> and with a little {{vertical}} pucker <b>in</b> <b>his</b> forehead, regarded his friend.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Micawber, leaning <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> {{chair with}} <b>his</b> hands <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>pockets,</b> eyed us aside, and nodded his head, {{as much as}} to say that the case was very clearly put.|$|R
