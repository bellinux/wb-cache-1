5|$|The East River Bridge is a {{multi-span}} <b>bridge</b> <b>in</b> Sheet Harbour, Nova Scotia {{that carries}} Trunk7 over the Northeast Arm of Sheet Harbour. It replaced a {{bridge of the}} same name that was built in 1956 and demolished in 2016. Construction began on the current <b>bridge</b> <b>in</b> September 2014 and was finished on 17December 2015, with a bridge walk commemorating the closing of the old East River Bridge and the opening of the new bridge. The old structure was a green arch bridge with a half-through, two-hinge type arch that was built in 1956, but was nearing the end of its lifespan leading to plans for construction of a new bridge funded by the federal and provincial governments. Nova Scotia had considered repairs to the old <b>bridge</b> <b>in</b> an effort to extend its lifespan, but ultimately elected to construct a new bridge.|$|E

5|$|Although {{some of its}} {{stones were}} plundered for use elsewhere, the Pont du Gard {{remained}} largely intact. Its survival was due to its use as a toll bridge across the valley. In the 13th century the French king granted the seigneurs of Uzès the right to levy tolls on those using the bridge. The right later passed to the Bishops of Uzès. In return, they were responsible for maintaining the <b>bridge</b> <b>in</b> good repair. However, it suffered serious damage during the 1620s when Henri, Duke of Rohan made use of the bridge to transport his artillery during the wars between the French royalists and the Huguenots, whom he led. To make space for his artillery to cross the bridge, the duke had {{one side of the}} second row of arches cut away to a depth of about one-third of their original thickness. This left a gap on the lowest deck wide enough to accommodate carts and cannons, but severely weakened the <b>bridge</b> <b>in</b> the process.|$|E
