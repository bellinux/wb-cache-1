40|$|We {{introduce}} a natural generalization of Borel 2 ̆ 7 s Conjecture. For each infinite cardinal number κ, let BCκ denote this generalization. Then BCℵ 0 {{is equivalent to}} the classical Borel conjecture. Assuming the classical Borel conjecture, ¬BCℵ 1 {{is equivalent to the}} existence of a Kurepa tree of height ℵ 1. Using the connection of BCκ with a generalization of Kurepa 2 ̆ 7 s Hypothesis, we obtain the following consistency results: 1. If it <b>is</b> <b>consistent</b> that there <b>is</b> a 1 -inaccessible cardinal then it <b>is</b> <b>consistent</b> that BCℵ 1. 2. If it <b>is</b> <b>consistent</b> that BCℵ 1, then it <b>is</b> <b>consistent</b> that there <b>is</b> an inaccessible cardinal. 3. If it <b>is</b> <b>consistent</b> that there <b>is</b> a 1 -inaccessible cardinal with ω inaccessible cardinals above it, then ¬BCℵω+(∀n 3 ̆cω) BCℵn <b>is</b> <b>consistent.</b> 4. If it <b>is</b> <b>consistent</b> that there <b>is</b> a 2 -huge cardinal, then it <b>is</b> <b>consistent</b> that BCℵω. 5.

5|$|After Victoria {{converted}} to alphanumeric route markers the Victorian section was signed as B23. In 2013 the NSW and ACT conversion to alphanumeric routes occurred {{and the remainder}} of the highway (south of Hindmarsh Drive in the ACT) was then also signed as B23. This violates the convention in New South Wales, where numbered routes below 50 are prefixed with an 'A' and 'B' routes are numbered above 50; the violation was allowed so the number and letter would <b>be</b> <b>consistent</b> across state lines.|$|E
5|$|Astatine has an {{electronegativity}} of 2.2 on {{the revised}} Pauling scale– {{lower than that}} of iodine (2.66) and the same as hydrogen. In hydrogen astatide (HAt) the negative charge is predicted to be on the hydrogen atom, implying that this compound should instead be referred to as astatine hydride. That would <b>be</b> <b>consistent</b> with the electronegativity of astatine on the Allred–Rochow scale (1.9) being less than that of hydrogen (2.2). The electron affinity of astatine is predicted to be reduced by one-third because of spin–orbit interactions.|$|E

Does it follow that T <b>is</b> <b>consistent?</b> If so, then T <b>is</b> <b>consistent</b> relative to S. Two theories are equiconsistent if each one <b>is</b> <b>consistent</b> {{relative to the}} other.|$|R

5|$|Attalus was a {{young child}} when his father died, {{sometime}} before 241BC, after which he was adopted by Eumenes I, the incumbent dynast.

In most cases the LFTs will <b>be</b> <b>consistent</b> with obstruction: raised bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase and γ-glutamyl transpeptidase. In the early stages, however, pressure on the liver cells may be the main feature and the tests will resemble those in hepatitis, with elevations in alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase.|$|E

5|$|The {{book also}} has a {{practical}} dimension, presenting debates between anthropocentric and non-anthropocentric approaches to environmental ethics as of little practical consequence, and suggesting that animal rights goals can <b>be</b> <b>consistent</b> with holistic environmentalist goals. Jensen argues that Varner's own discussion of the reconciliation of environmentalism and animal advocacy is too narrow, but that, nonetheless, Varner's own biocentric individualism offers potential in this area, even despite the limited engagement in the book with practical animal-related issues.|$|E

5|$|At {{the most}} extreme points of its perceptibility, it was felt with {{intensity}} II or III (Weak) at Healdsburg {{in the north and}} Santa Barbara in the south, Visalia in the central valley and Twain Harte in the Sierra Nevada foothills. It was also listed as having been felt (with no specific intensity level given) by residents in high-rise buildings in Reno, Nevada. Closer to the epicenter, several instances of damage were aligned with the highest observed intensity. The structural effects to the gas station's walls and roof at Casa de Fruta, the beam damage {{on the second floor of}} the Ford's department store in Gilroy, and the caved-in roof from the fallen parapet at the law office in Hollister were all considered by the United States Geological Survey to <b>be</b> <b>consistent</b> with intensity VII (Very strong) shaking.|$|E

The Rheasilvia region is richest in diogenite, consistent with the Rheasilvia-forming impact excavating material from deeper within Vesta.

25|$|Assuming ZF <b>is</b> <b>consistent,</b> Kurt Gödel {{showed that}} the {{negation}} of the axiom of choice is not a theorem of ZF by constructing an inner model (the constructible universe) which satisfies ZFC and thus showing that ZFC <b>is</b> <b>consistent.</b> Assuming ZF <b>is</b> <b>consistent,</b> Paul Cohen employed the technique of forcing, developed for this purpose, {{to show that the}} axiom of choice itself is not a theorem of ZF by constructing a much more complex model which satisfies ZF¬C (ZF with the negation of AC added as axiom) and thus showing that ZF¬C <b>is</b> <b>consistent.</b> Together these results establish that the axiom of choice is logically independent of ZF. The assumption that ZF <b>is</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>is</b> harmless because adding another axiom to an already inconsistent system cannot make the situation worse. Because of independence, the decision whether to use the axiom of choice (or its negation) in a proof cannot be made by appeal to other axioms of set theory. The decision must be made on other grounds.|$|R

He was also part of the 5 Gorkha Rifles (Frontier Force) briefly as he had received his posting order as Commanding Officer of 3/5 Gorkha Rifles (FF).

5|$|In the {{eleventh}} century, Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen, 965–1040) rejected the Greek ideas about vision, whether the Aristotelian tradition that {{held that the}} form of the perceived object entered the eye (but not its matter), or that of Euclid and Ptolemy that held that the eye emitted a ray. Al-Haytham proposed in his Book of Optics that vision occurs by way of light rays forming a cone with its vertex {{at the center of the}} eye. He suggested that light was reflected from different surfaces in different directions, thus causing objects to look different. He argued further that the mathematics of reflection and refraction needed to <b>be</b> <b>consistent</b> with the anatomy of the eye.|$|E
