5|$|In October 1973, the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC, {{consisting}} of the Arab majority of OPEC plus Egypt and Syria) declared significant production cuts and an oil embargo against the United States and other industrialized nations that supported Israel in the Yom Kippur War. A previous embargo attempt was largely ineffective {{in response to the}} Six-Day War in 1967. However, in 1973, the result was a sharp rise in oil prices and OPEC revenues, from US$3/bbl to US$12/bbl, and an emergency period of energy rationing, intensified by panic reactions, a declining trend in US oil production, currency devaluations, and a lengthy UK coal-miners dispute. For a time, the UK imposed an emergency three-day workweek. Seven European nations banned non-essential Sunday driving. US gas stations limited the amount of gasoline that could be dispensed, closed on Sundays, and restricted the days when gasoline could be purchased, based on license plate numbers. Even after the embargo ended in March 1974 following intense diplomatic activity, prices continued to rise. The world experienced a global economic recession, with unemployment and inflation surging simultaneously, steep declines in stock and <b>bond</b> <b>prices,</b> major shifts in trade balances and petrodollar flows, and a dramatic end to the post-WWII economic boom.|$|E

The <b>bond</b> <b>pricing</b> problem is further considered within the Heath-Jarrow-Morton (HJM) framework in which the analytic solution follows directly from the short rate dynamics under the forward measure...|$|R

25|$|The {{financial}} markets use stochastic models {{to represent the}} seemingly random behaviour of assets such as stocks, commodities, relative currency prices (i.e., {{the price of one}} currency compared to that of another, such as the price of US Dollar compared to that of the Euro), and interest rates. These models are then used by quantitative analysts to value options on stock prices, <b>bond</b> <b>prices,</b> and on interest rates, see Markov models. Moreover, it {{is at the heart of}} the insurance industry.|$|E
25|$|The {{market price}} of a bond is {{the present value of}} all {{expected}} future interest and principal payments of the bond discounted at the bond's yield to maturity, or rate of return. That relationship is the definition of the redemption yield on the bond, which is likely to be close to the current market interest rate for other bonds with similar characteristics. (Otherwise there would be arbitrage opportunities.) The yield and {{price of a}} bond are inversely related so that when market interest rates rise, <b>bond</b> <b>prices</b> fall and vice versa.|$|E
40|$|This article {{proposes a}} new {{approach}} to <b>bond</b> <b>price</b> dynamics. By means of exponential formulae and a notion of forward derivatives we construct a general theoretical framework, which allows to include most of known <b>bond</b> <b>price</b> properties. In particular, we perform a new analysis of no arbitrage conditions together with their consequences on the corresponding return premium. An expression for the general <b>bond</b> <b>price</b> is obtained which also turns out to be computationally convenient. Finally, we specify our result in a general multifactor <b>bond</b> <b>pricing</b> model. (orig.)

25|$|<b>Bond</b> <b>prices</b> {{can become}} {{volatile}} {{depending on the}} credit rating of the issuer – for instance if the credit rating agencies like Standard & Poor's and Moody's upgrade or downgrade the credit rating of the issuer. An unanticipated downgrade will cause the market price of the bond to fall. As with interest rate risk, this risk {{does not affect the}} bond's interest payments (provided the issuer does not actually default), but puts at risk the market price, which affects mutual funds holding these bonds, and holders of individual bonds who may have to sell them.|$|E
25|$|Corporate {{transactional}} events generally {{fit into}} three categories: distressed securities, risk arbitrage, and special situations. Distressed securities include such events as restructurings, recapitalizations, and bankruptcies. A distressed securities investment strategy involves {{investing in the}} bonds or loans of companies facing bankruptcy or severe financial distress, when these bonds or loans are being traded at a discount to their value. Hedge fund managers pursuing the distressed debt investment strategy aim to capitalize on depressed <b>bond</b> <b>prices.</b> Hedge funds purchasing distressed debt may prevent those companies from going bankrupt, as such an acquisition deters foreclosure by banks. While event-driven investing in general tends to thrive during a bull market, distressed investing works best during a bear market.|$|E

2500|$|The {{yield to}} {{maturity}} (YTM) is {{the discount rate}} which returns the market price of a bond without embedded optionality; it is identical to [...] (required return) in the above equation. YTM is thus the {{internal rate of return}} of an investment in the bond made at the observed price. Since YTM can be used to price a bond, <b>bond</b> <b>prices</b> are often quoted in terms of YTM.|$|E
2500|$|These {{factors are}} likely to change over time, so the market price of a bond will vary after it is issued. The market price is {{expressed}} {{as a percentage of}} nominal value. Bonds are not necessarily issued at par (100% of face value, corresponding to a price of 100), but <b>bond</b> <b>prices</b> will move towards par as they approach maturity (if the market expects the maturity payment to be made in full and on time) as this is the price the issuer will pay to redeem the bond. This is referred to as [...] "Pull to Par". At other times, prices can be above par (bond is priced at greater than 100), which is called trading at a premium, or below par (bond is priced at less than 100), which is called trading at a discount. Most government bonds are denominated in units of $1000 in the United States, or in units of £100 in the United Kingdom. Hence, a deep discount US bond, selling at a price of 75.26, indicates a selling price of $752.60 per bond sold. (Often, in the US, <b>bond</b> <b>prices</b> are quoted in points and thirty-seconds of a point, rather than in decimal form.) [...] Some short-term bonds, such as the U.S. Treasury bill, are always issued at a discount, and pay par amount at maturity rather than paying coupons. This is called a discount bond.|$|E

2500|$|Academics {{had to play}} {{catch up}} with {{practitioners}} in this matter. One important theoretic development came from a Czech mathematician, Oldrich Vasicek, who argued in a 1977 paper that <b>bond</b> <b>prices</b> all along the curve are driven by the short end (under risk neutral equivalent martingale measure) and accordingly by short-term interest rates. [...] The mathematical model for Vasicek's work was given by an Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process, but has since been discredited because the model predicts a positive probability that the short rate becomes negative and is inflexible in creating yield curves of different shapes. [...] Vasicek's model has been superseded by many different models including the Hull–White model (which allows for time varying parameters in the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process), the Cox–Ingersoll–Ross model, which is a modified Bessel process, and the Heath–Jarrow–Morton framework.
