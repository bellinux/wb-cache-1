5|$|I do {{not know}} what I may appear to the world, but to myself I seem to have been only like a boy playing on the sea-shore, and {{diverting}} myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered <b>before</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
5|$|I was to {{keep the}} fish <b>before</b> <b>me</b> in a tin tray, and {{occasionally}} moisten the surface with alcohol from the jar... In ten minutes I had seen all that could be seen in that fish, and started in search of the Professor – who had, however, left the Museum; and when I returned, after lingering over some of the odd animals stored in the upper apartment, my specimen was dry all over. I dashed the fluid over the fish as if to resuscitate the beast from a fainting fit, and looked with anxiety for a return of the normal sloppy appearance. This little excitement over, nothing was done but to return to a steadfast gaze at my mute companion.|$|E
5|$|Reaching the cascade, {{or rather}} cataract, the roaring {{of which had}} a long time {{announced}} its vicinity, my soul was hurried by the falls into a new train of reflections. The impetuous dashing of the rebounding torrent from the dark cavities which mocked the exploring eye, produced an equal activity in my mind: my thoughts darted from earth to heaven, and I asked myself why I was chained to life and its misery? Still the tumultuous emotions this sublime object excited, were pleasurable; and, viewing it, my soul rose, with renewed dignity, above its cares – grasping at immortality – it seemed as impossible to stop the current of my thoughts, as of the always varying, still the same, torrent <b>before</b> <b>me</b> – I stretched out my hand to eternity, bounding over the dark speck of life to come.|$|E

25|$|Through Cambridge and Bloomsbury, Young had {{a longstanding}} {{friendship}} with E.M. Forster. Suffering writer’s block {{while working on}} A Passage to India, the novelist was Young’s guest at the Lacket in early May 1922. Shortly afterwards he wrote to Young declaring, “an unfinished novel’s <b>before</b> <b>me</b> now, and sometimes I work at it with distaste and despair…You certainly have done more than any individual I know to help me by direct remarks. Your knowledge {{of the business of}} creating seemed to me profounder than that possessed by so-called artists.” These comments suggest that Young gave Forster significant advice and encouragement at a crucial stage on work on the latter’s eventual masterpiece.|$|E

60|$|This {{new love}} {{that was in}} me; this giant {{sensation}} of a day's growth, was first love. Hitherto, I had been heart-whole.

25|$|The blacking-warehouse was {{the last}} house on the {{left-hand}} side of the way, at old Hungerford Stairs. It was a crazy, tumble-down old house, abutting of course on the river, and literally overrun with rats. Its wainscoted rooms, and its rotten floors and staircase, and the old grey rats swarming down in the cellars, {{and the sound of}} their squeaking and scuffling coming up the stairs at all times, and the dirt and decay of the place, rise up visibly <b>before</b> <b>me,</b> as if I were there again. The counting-house was on the first floor, looking over the coal-barges and the river. There was a recess in it, in which I was to sit and work. My work was to cover the pots of paste-blacking; first with a piece of oil-paper, and then with a piece of blue paper; to tie them round with a string; and then to clip the paper close and neat, all round, until it looked as smart as a pot of ointment from an apothecary's shop. When a certain number of grosses of pots had attained this pitch of perfection, I was to paste on each a printed label, and then go on again with more pots. Two or three other boys were kept at similar duty down-stairs on similar wages. One of them came up, in a ragged apron and a paper cap, on the first Monday morning, to show me the trick of using the string and tying the knot. His name was Bob Fagin; and I took the liberty of using his name, long afterwards, in Oliver Twist.|$|E

[...] He was particularly {{moved by the}} plight of the children living in the penal colony with their parents. For example: ...|$|E
500|$|Goldman {{traveled}} to Canada in 1927, {{just in time}} to receive news of the impending executions of Italian anarchists Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti in Boston. Angered by the many irregularities of the case, she saw it as another travesty of justice in the US. She longed to join the mass demonstrations in Boston; memories of the Haymarket affair overwhelmed her, compounded by her isolation.

500|$|The final movement, [...] "" [...] (I have a {{difficult}} journey <b>before</b> <b>me),</b> opens with a triad fanfare, which the bass voice sings on the words [...] "Nur getrost" [...] (Be comforted). It {{is similar to a}} motif in Bach's Violin Concerto in E minor, BWV 1042. The soprano reprises the chorale melody in duple rather than the original triple time, with a responding line in the bass voice. After two phrases, the ritornello plays alone for eight measures before both voices re-enter in counterpoint to complete the chorale.|$|E

[...] "Marty [...] had started writing <b>before</b> <b>me,</b> and sent me some of his ideas," [...] Salvatori said. [...] "I picked a few that I felt I could add some magic to, and worked on those. I also came up with several ideas that I sent to Marty that {{he put his hands}} on." [...] Once the duo felt they had enough material, the Chicago-based Salvatori flew to Bungie in Seattle to complete the arrangements and record live musicians.|$|E

She is a twice winner of the WH Smith Young Writers Award for both fiction and poetry. She has described herself as a [...] "late bloomer": [...] "All of my friends were kissing boys and drinking cider way <b>before</b> <b>me.</b> I found it really depressing that we weren't making camp fires and everyone was doing grown-up stuff." [...] "I loathed being a teenager." [...] She had a nervous breakdown and developed anorexia {{at the age of}} 15 and underwent Freudian psychoanalysis for four years.|$|E

500|$|Critics {{compared}} Leavins to {{works by}} other R artists. Rogers wrote {{that it was}} a perfect fit for listeners of Joss Stone and Jamie Cullum Daniel Garrett of The Compulsive Reader listed the record alongside Ella Fitzgerald's The Best of the Song Books (1993) and Diana Ross' Blue (2006), praising each woman as the [...] "three ladies of song". Honolulu Star-Bulletin's Gary C.W. Chun favorably compared Leavin to Gladys Knight's <b>Before</b> <b>Me</b> (2006). Rogers wrote that Cole's vocal performance demonstrated a [...] "tasteful restraint" [...] and was an improvement over contemporary artists. He felt that Cole's voice was better than the [...] "modulated warbling that seems to pass for contemporary R these days".|$|E
500|$|Wilberforce's {{involvement}} in the abolition movement was motivated {{by a desire to}} put his Christian principles into action and to serve God in public life. He and other Evangelicals were horrified by what they perceived was a depraved and unChristian trade, and the greed and avarice of the owners and traders. Wilberforce sensed a call from God, writing in a journal entry in 1787 that [...] "God Almighty has set <b>before</b> <b>me</b> two great objects, the suppression of the Slave Trade and the Reformation of Manners [...] ". The conspicuous involvement of Evangelicals in the highly popular anti-slavery movement served to improve the status of a group otherwise associated with the less popular campaigns against vice and immorality.|$|E

I called on the ghosts of Aristophanes, of Shakespeare, of Lope de Vega. I wept and swallowed my own tears... And I cursed the fate that bound me to him... Yet even as I cursed and condemned, the tears rose. For my whole life, my whole past, was <b>before</b> <b>me</b> on that stage... Poor weak first step of our Yiddish theater...
