2500|$|Unlike the arthropods, velvet worms do {{not possess}} a rigid exoskeleton. Instead, their fluid-filled body cavity acts as a {{hydrostatic}} skeleton, similarly to many unrelated soft-bodied animals that are cylindrically shaped, for example sea anemones and various worms. Pressure of their incompressible internal bodily fluid on the body wall provides rigidity, and muscles are able to act against it. The body wall consists of a non-cellular outer skin, the cuticula; a single layer of epidermis cells forming an internal skin; and beneath this, usually three layers of muscle, which are embedded in connective tissues. The cuticula is about a micrometer thick and covered with fine [...] In composition and structure, it resembles the cuticula of the arthropods, consisting of α-chitin and various proteins, although not containing collagen. It {{can be divided into}} an external epicuticula and an internal procuticula, which themselves consist of exo- and endo-cuticula. This multi-level structure is responsible for the high flexibility of the outer skin, which enables the velvet worm to squeeze itself into the narrowest crevices. Although outwardly water-repellent, the cuticula is not able to prevent water loss by respiration, and, as a result, velvet worms can only live in microclimates with high humidity to avoid desiccation. The surface of the cuticula is scattered with numerous fine papillae, the larger of which carry visible villi-like sensitive bristles. The papillae themselves are covered with tiny scales, lending the skin a velvety appearance (from which the common name is likely derived). It also feels like dry velvet to the touch, for which its water-repellent nature is responsible. Moulting of the skin (ecdysis) takes place regularly, around every 14 days, induced by the hormone ecdysone. The inner surface of the skin bears a hexagonal pattern. At each moult, the shed skin is replaced by the epidermis, which lies immediately beneath it; unlike the cuticula, this consists of living cells. Beneath this lies a thick layer of connective tissue, which is composed primarily of collagen fibres aligned either parallel or perpendicular to the body's longitudinal axis. The colouration of Onychophora is generated by a range of pigments. The solubility of these pigments is a useful diagnostic character: in all arthropods and tardigrades, the <b>body</b> <b>pigment</b> is soluble in ethanol. This is also true for the Peripatidae, {{but in the case of}} the Peripatopsidae, the <b>body</b> <b>pigment</b> is insoluble in ethanol.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to assess whether {{ultrasound}} biomicroscopy (UBM) examination of anterior uveal tumors could help in tissue differentiation. Five anterior uveal tumors in five patients underwent UBM (Paradigm P 45, 50 MHz) examination prior to fine needle aspiration (FNA) of the lesion; two melanomas, one nevus, one metastatic carcinoma, and one bilateral iris lymphoma were cytologically diagnosed. Only UBM information was obtained from four small non-growing lesions consistent with iris nevi. Four ciliary <b>body</b> <b>pigmented</b> tumors elevated by 4 to 6 mm were examined both with UBM and immersion standardized echography (Cinescan S, Quantel Medical). UBM showed high reflective iris subsurface in all iris nevi. Of the FNA verified iridociliary pigmented tumors, the iris pigment epithelium was found to be indistinct in iridociliary melanoma only. Iridociliary melanoma, nevus and metastatic carcinoma showed angle invasion and similar acoustic pattern and reflectivity on UBM examination. Multiple iris masses were imaged in lymphoma and metastatic carcinoma. Two ciliary body low to medium reflective and two ciliary body high reflective tumors on standardized echography, consistent with ciliary body melanoma and melanocytoma, were plagued or observed for four and thirteen years; UBM was informative for superficial margins and angle invasion only. In conclusion, UBM was very useful for location and size of small anterior uveal tumors, but could not help in tissue differentiation of iridociliary tumors. Multiple iris lesions were found in iridociliary lymphoma or metastatic carcinoma only.

Métodos: Foram estudados de modo retrospectivo os prontuários de 73 pacientes, 82 olhos, com diagnóstico ecográfico de cisto primário de íris ou corpo ciliar durante o período de janeiro/ 97 a dezembro/ 99. Utilizou-se o biomicroscópio ultra-sônico, aplicando técnicas padronizadas de imersão. Resultados: À biomicroscopia ultra-sônica os cistos caracterizaram-se por apresentarem paredes finas e regulares, e conteúdo anecóico. Quarenta e oito pacientes (65, 7 %) eram do sexo feminino. A maior incidência (28, 8 %) ocorreu para o grupo incluído no intervalo de 20 a 29 anos de idade. Observou-se uma característica distribuição, predominantemente nos quadrantes temporais inferiores. Conclusões: A biomicroscopia ultra-sônica mostrou-se útil no diagnóstico de cistos primários do epitélio pigmentar da íris e do corpo ciliar, auxiliando na diferenciação de patologias tumorais e avaliando possíveis complicações.

40|$|International audienceNeural crest-like cells (NCLC) that {{express the}} HNK- 1 antigen and form <b>body</b> <b>pigment</b> cells were {{previously}} identified in diverse ascidian species. Here we investigate the embryonic origin, migratory activity, and neural crest related gene expression patterns of NCLC in the ascidian Ciona intestinalis. HNK- 1 expression first appeared {{at about the}} time of larval hatching in dorsal cells of the posterior trunk. In swimming tadpoles, HNK- 1 positive cells began to migrate, and after metamorphosis they were localized in the oral and atrial siphons, branchial gill slits, endostyle, and gut. Cleavage arrest experiments showed that NCLC are derived from the A 7. 6 cells, the precursors of trunk lateral cells (TLC), one of the three types of migratory mesenchymal cells in ascidian embryos. In cleavage arrested embryos, HNK- 1 positive TLC were present on the lateral margins of the neural plate and later became localized adjacent to the posterior sensory vesicle, a staging zone for their migration after larval hatching. The Ciona orthologues of seven of sixteen genes that function in the vertebrate neural crest gene regulatory network are expressed in the A 7. 6 /TLC lineage. The vertebrate counterparts of these genes function downstream of neural plate border specification in the regulatory network leading to neural crest development. The results suggest that NCLC and neural crest cells may be homologous cell types originating in the common ancestor of tunicates and vertebrates and support the possibility that a putative regulatory network governing NCLC development was co-opted to produce neural crest cells during vertebrate evolution...|$|E
40|$|All <b>body</b> <b>pigment</b> {{cells in}} {{vertebrates}} {{are derived from}} the neural crest. In fish the neural crest can generate up to six different types of pigment cells, as well as various non-pigmented derivatives. In mouse and zebrafish, extensive collections of pigmentation mutants have enabled dissection of many aspects of pigment cell development, including fate specification, survival, proliferation and differentiation. A collection of spontaneous mutations collected from wild medaka (Oryzias latipes) populations and maintained at Nagoya University includes more than 40 pigmentation mutations. The descriptions of their adult phenotypes have been previously published by Tomita and colleagues (summarised in Medaka (Killifish) Biology and Strains, 1975), but the embryonic phenotypes have not been systematically described. Here we examine these embryonic phenotypes, paying {{particular attention to the}} likely defect in pigment cell development in each, and comparing the spectrum of defects to those in the zebrafish and mouse collections. Many phenotypes parallel those of identified zebrafish mutants, although pigment cell death phenotypes are largely absent, presumably due to the different selective pressures under which the mutants were isolated. We have identified mutant phenotypes that may represent the MitflKit pathway of melanophore specification and survival. We use in situ hybridisation with available markers to confirm a key prediction of this hypothesis. We also highlight a set of novel phenotypes not seen in the zebrafish collection. These mutants will be a valuable resource for pigment cell and neural crest studies and will strongly complement the mutant collections in other vertebrates. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
