25|$|Under Mullins' watchful eye, {{most of the}} {{multiple}} story dormitories, now visibly present on the Fayetteville skyline were constructed, {{as well as the}} Graduate Education <b>building,</b> <b>science</b> and engineering buildings, and the now demolished Carlson terraces. A new student union was built with the old track and field space becoming an outdoor mall area, now situated between the library and the union, and the Fine Arts Center and the law school. Growth went beyond student enrollment and buildings with record private contributions flowing in to the tune of nearly three million dollars from 1962 to 1965.|$|E
25|$|Binghamton {{has grown}} to include roughly 120 buildings, {{including}} recent additions from a $2.2 billion SUNY capital plan.
