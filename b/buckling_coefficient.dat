40|$|Abstract: Buckling, a form {{of failure}} {{happened}} to plated structures, is investigated in this study. The main focus is to investigate the effects of thickness of the plates having through-thickness holes on buckling when the plate is subjected to in-plane compression. Plates having length of 200 mm and width of 100 mm are chosen to have thickness in range from 0. 50 mm to 10 mm. Two holes of diameters of 20 mm are implemented in plates. The finite element procedure using ABAQUS is applied for analyses. Then using the Gerard and Becker equation compressive <b>buckling</b> <b>coefficients,</b> Kc, are calculated and presented to enable engineers to calculate buckling load for the desired plate with holes in specific dimension. In order to generalize the obtained results, verification analysis has been performed by taking plates having different dimensions from the original ones used in this study.

40|$|Horizontal {{curvature}} {{offers many}} benefits {{related to the}} design and construction of bridges and is often used for bridge designs in complex road geometries. Though horizontal curvature provides geometric and alignment benefits from a roadway design perspective, curvature introduces torsion and warping that complicates bridge behavior. This {{is especially true for}} steel, plate girder bridges that are torsionally weak and contain slender cross-sectional elements. While the impact of horizontal curvature on flexural response of steel girders has been studied, the impact of horizontal curvature on plate girder shear strength has not been thoroughly evaluated. ^ While {{a number of studies have}} looked at the shear strength of slender, straight, plate girder webs, limited studies have examined shear strength of horizontally curved plate girders with slender webs. Jung and White experimentally investigated horizontal curvature influence on shear strength. Batdorf computationally investigated how horizontal curvature impacts slender, steel web panels via derivation of a shear <b>buckling</b> <b>coefficient</b> that included horizontal curvature. ^ This study investigated how horizontal curvature influences steel, plate girder, shear strength. Shear behavior was examined computationally using calibrated Finite Element Models (FEM) to perform parametric studies that incorporated horizontal curvature and critical geometric properties. This information was used to develop two shear buckling coefficients, one based on simplified representation of Batdorf’s shear <b>buckling</b> <b>coefficient</b> and the other by introducing horizontal curvature into Timoshenko and Gere’s shear <b>buckling</b> <b>coefficient.</b> Effectiveness of these shear buckling coefficients was assessed via comparisons between shear capacities from the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials Load and Resistance Factor Design Bridge Design Specifications (AASHTO LRFD). Comparisons involved girder FEM models whose properties cover the range of possible horizontal curvatures, web slenderness and panel aspect ratios. After assessing how horizontal curvature could influence shear behavior, possible beneficial effects were assessed by evaluating increased possible increases in shear stiffener spacing using proposed shear buckling coefficients. ^ Results showed that horizontal curvature enhanced shear strength for the slender, steel girder webs that were studied. Including curvature during web design could also increase maximum allowable shear stiffener spacing. ...|$|E
40|$|Using {{a double}} affine transformation, the {{classical}} buckling equation for specially orthotropic plates {{and the corresponding}} virtual work theorem are presented in a particularly simple fashion. These dual representations are characterized by a single material constant, called the generalized rigidity ratio, whose range is predicted to be the closed interval from 0 to 1 (if this prediction is correct then the numerical results using a ratio greater than 1 in the specially orthotropic plate literature are incorrect); when natural boundary conditions are considered a generalized Poisson's ratio is introduced. Thus the buckling results are valid for any specially orthotropic material; hence the curves presented in the text are generic rather than specific. The solution trends are twofold; the <b>buckling</b> <b>coefficients</b> decrease with decreasing generalized rigidity ratio and, when applicable, they decrease with increasing generalized Poisson's ratio.

Then we consider the numerical solution of the buckling problem. For the finite element approximation of Reissner-Mindlin equations, {{it is well known}} that some kind of reduced integration or mixed interpolation has to be used to avoid locking. In particular we consider Duran-Liberman elements, which have been already proved to be locking-free for load and vibration problems. We adapt the classical approximation theory for non-compact operators to obtain optimal order error estimates for the eigenfunctions and a double order for the eigenvalues. These estimates are valid with constants independent of the plate thickness. We report some numerical experiments confirming the theoretical results. Finally, we refine the analysis in the case of a uniformly compressed plate. Key words. Buckling, Reissner-Mindlin plates, finite elements, non-compact spectral problems.
