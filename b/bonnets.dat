5|$|Scotch <b>bonnets</b> are predators; {{they search}} for their food on sandy {{stretches}} of the ocean floor, where they consume echinoderms such as sand dollars, sea biscuits, and other sea urchins (such as Echinocardium cordatum), drilling into their tests {{with the aid of}} sulfuric acid.|$|E
5|$|Crest badges, {{much like}} clan tartans, {{do not have}} a long history, and owe much to Victorian era romanticism, having only been worn on the bonnet since the 19th century. The {{original}} badges used by clans are said to have been specific plants worn in <b>bonnets</b> or hung from a pole or spear.|$|E
5|$|In 1910 Brooks had {{her first}} solo show at the prestigious Gallery Durand-Ruel, {{displaying}} thirteen paintings, almost all of women or young girls. Some were portraits; others showed anonymous models in interior scenes or against tonal backgrounds, often with pensive or withdrawn expressions. The paintings were generally naturalistic, showing an attentive eye for the details of Belle Époque fashion, with parasols, veils, and elaborate <b>bonnets</b> on display.|$|E
50|$|The <b>bonnet</b> {{provides}} a leakproof closure for the valve body. The threaded {{section of the}} stem goes through a hole with matching threads in the <b>bonnet.</b> Globe valves may have a screw-in, union, or bolted <b>bonnet.</b> Screw-in <b>bonnet</b> is the simplest <b>bonnet,</b> offering a durable, pressure-tight seal. Union <b>bonnet</b> is suitable for applications requiring frequent inspection or cleaning. It also gives the body added strength. A <b>bonnet</b> attached with bolts is used for larger or higher pressure applications. The <b>bonnet</b> also contains the packing, a wearable material that maintains the seal between the <b>bonnet</b> and the stem during valve cycling.|$|R

40|$|The {{controllability}} of {{stiffness of}} <b>bonnet</b> tool polishing large aspheric lenses was studied, aiming {{to ensure the}} high stability and uniform removal rate of <b>bonnet</b> tool in polishing process. After analyzing the force situation of <b>bonnet</b> tool when polishing large aspheric lenses, the stiffness of the <b>bonnet</b> tool was calculated, and then influencing factors of stiffness of <b>bonnet</b> tool and the effects brought by stiffness of <b>bonnet</b> in polishing process were discussed.

5|$|Some Scotch <b>bonnets</b> have a {{completely}} smooth and glossy shell. This {{was thought to}} be a different species which was given the name cicatricosa by Gmelin in 1791. This taxon was recognized for a while, including up until 2010 as a separate species, Semicassis cicatricosa. However, in 2015 this is considered to be only a form, therefore S. cicatricosa has become another synonym of S. granulata.|$|E
5|$|Growth is slow, and the veligers {{are carried}} by the ocean {{currents}} for up to 14 weeks. As the veligers mature, they develop their first shell (the smooth protoconch) and turn into very small juvenile snails, at which point they sink to the ocean floor. As {{is the case in}} all shelled mollusks, the mantle is what secretes the shell; shell growth begins at what will later become the apex of the shell, and typically rotates clockwise. As the animal gradually matures, the mantle continues to secrete shell material. Scotch <b>bonnets</b> complete maturation in one to six years. However, some have lived more than six years.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bonnets</b> {{could be}} made {{of a variety of}} materials. <b>Bonnets</b> formed from buckram and wire and covered with fashion fabric were very popular. During the warmer seasons, <b>bonnets</b> made of straw, woven horsehair, or {{gathered}} net were also seen. Heavier materials like velvet were favored for winter <b>bonnets,</b> though quilted winter hoods were much more practical and warm.|$|E

50|$|A poke <b>bonnet</b> (sometimes also {{referred}} to as a Neapolitan <b>bonnet)</b> is a women's <b>bonnet,</b> featuring a small crown and wide and rounded front brim.

5|$|On 10 November 1718, <b>Bonnet</b> {{was brought}} to trial before Sir Nicholas Trott, sitting in his {{capacity}} as Vice-Admiralty judge. Trott had already sat in judgment on <b>Bonnet's</b> crew and sentenced most of them to hang. <b>Bonnet</b> was formally charged with only two acts of piracy, against the Francis and the Fortune, whose commanders were on hand to testify against <b>Bonnet</b> in person. Ignatius Pell had turned King's evidence in the trial of <b>Bonnet's</b> crew and now testified, somewhat reluctantly, against <b>Bonnet</b> himself. <b>Bonnet</b> pleaded not guilty and conducted his own defence without assistance of counsel, cross-examining the witnesses to little avail, and calling a character witness in his favour. Trott rendered a damning summation of the evidence, and the jury delivered a guilty verdict. Two days later, after treating the convicted man to a stern lecture on his violation of Christian duties, Trott sentenced <b>Bonnet</b> to death.|$|R
