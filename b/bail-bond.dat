500|$|Carroll {{was charged}} with {{implementing}} {{an amendment to the}} state constitution approved by voters in 1975 to drastically reorganize the state's judicial system. The Kentucky Court of Appeals, the state's court of last resort, was renamed the Kentucky Supreme Court, and a new Court of Appeals was created and interposed between the Supreme Court and the state's circuit and district courts. The position of county judge was made a purely administrative position, and the office was renamed county judge/executive. Historian Lowell H. Harrison opined that the amendment made Kentucky's legal system [...] "a model for the nation." [...] Carroll also pushed through legislation eliminating the private <b>bail-bond</b> system.|$|E

500|$|In North Carolina, Jerry Blanchard {{was indicted}} for {{threatening}} to kill Obama during a July 15, 2008 breakfast at a Waffle House. He allegedly called Obama the [...] "Antichrist" [...] at the breakfast, and made similar threats against Obama later at a hotel. Blanchard {{was placed in}} custody {{despite the fact that}} no evidence surfaced that he planned to go through with an assassination attempt. Later that same month in Florida, Raymond H. Geisel was charged with making threatening statements against Obama during a <b>bail-bonds</b> training class on July 31. Geisel also threatened to put a bullet in the head of then-President Bush, although Geisel later claimed he was joking. He was found to be in possession of ammunition, body armor, a combat-style hatchet, tear gas, a loaded 9mm handgun and four loaded magazines. Geisel said he collected firearms, and was only using the gun for his <b>bail-bonds</b> course. Geisel remained in custody for a month.|$|R
5000|$|Raymond H. Geisel {{was charged}} with making {{threatening}} statements against Obama during a <b>bail-bonds</b> training class on July 31, 2008, in Miami, Florida. During the course, Geisel referred to Obama with a racial epithet and said, [...] "If he gets elected, I'll assassinate him myself." [...] Geisel also threatened to put {{a bullet in the}} head of then-President Bush, although Geisel later claimed he was joking. In his hotel room, authorities found ammunition, body armor, a combat-style hatchet, tear gas, a loaded 9 mm handgun and four loaded magazines. Geisel said he collected firearms, and was only using the gun for his <b>bail-bonds</b> course. Geisel remained in custody for a month. He later plead [...] "not guilty" [...] on August 20, 2008. With trial date set for January 2009, in December 2008 there was discussion of a plea agreement for Geisel who faced up to thirty years in prison if convicted on all four counts brought against him. In December 2009, Geisel was convicted on weapons charges and served three years' supervised probation stemming from that conviction. The threat charges were dropped as part of his plea agreement.|$|R
5000|$|By 1980 she {{appeared}} on TV almost weekly, {{starting with a}} recurring role as housekeeper Adelaide Brubaker in the sitcomDiff'rent Strokes. In 1981 she landed another recurring role as Emma Tisdale on the TV show The Dukes of Hazzard. In the 1982 - 83 season, Volz was the matriarch in the Filthy Rich, a series spoofing prime-time soap operas of the day. Volz's character Winona [...] "Mother B" [...] Beck, was the discarded first wife of cryogenically frozen Big Guy Beck (Slim Pickens and, after his death, Forrest Tucker), constantly trying {{to escape from the}} nursing home to return to the family mansion, Toad Hall. Volz's final series role was as the <b>bail-bonds</b> woman that hired Lee Majors bounty-hunter character on The Fall Guy from 1985 until the series ended in 1986.|$|R
60|$|It was {{certainly}} very expedient that Sam {{should be made}} to reappear as soon as possible. The idea was general in the parish that the Vicar knew all about him. George Brattle, who had become bail for his brother's reappearance, had given his name on the clear understanding that the Vicar would be responsible. Some half-sustained tidings of Carry's presence in Salisbury and of the Vicar's various visits to the city were current in Bullhampton, and with these were mingled an idea that Carry and Sam were in league together. That Fenwick was chivalrous, perhaps Quixotic, in his friendships for those whom he regarded, had long been felt, and this feeling was now stronger than ever. He certainly could bring up Sam Brattle if he pleased;--or, if he pleased, as might, some said, not improbably be the case, he could keep him away. There would be Â£400 to pay for the <b>bail-bond,</b> but the Vicar was known to be rich as well as Quixotic, and,--so said the Puddlehamites,--would care very little about that, if he might thus secure for himself his own way.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Crawley had again seated himself, {{and during}} this period of the affair was leaning over the table with his face buried on his arms. Mrs. Crawley sat by his side, utterly {{impotent}} as to any assistance, just touching him with her hand, and waiting behind her veil till she should be made to understand what was the decision of the magistrates. This was at last communicated to her,--and to him,--in a whisper by Mr. Walker. Mr. Crawley must understand that he was committed to take his trial at Barchester, at the next assizes, which would be held in April, but that bail would be taken;--his own bail in five hundred pounds, and that of two others in two hundred and fifty pounds each. And Mr. Walker explained further that he and the bailmen were ready, and that the <b>bail-bond</b> was prepared. The bailmen were to be the Rev. Mr. Robarts, and Major Grantly. In five minutes the bond was signed and Mr. Crawley was at liberty to go away, a free man,--till the Barchester Assizes should come round in April.|$|E
6000|$|The tidings of {{what had}} been done by the magistrates at their petty {{sessions}} was communicated the same night to Grace Crawley by Miss Prettyman. Miss Anne Prettyman had heard the news within five minutes of the execution of the <b>bail-bond,</b> and had rushed to her sister with information as to the event. [...] "They have found him guilty; they have, indeed. They have convicted him,--or whatever it is, because he couldn't say where he got it." [...] "You do not mean that they have sent him to prison?" [...] "No;--not to prison; not as yet, that is. I don't understand it altogether; but he's to be tried again at the assizes. In the meantime he's to be out on bail. Major Grantly is to be the bail,--he and Mr. Robarts. That, I think, was very nice of him." [...] It was undoubtedly the fact that Miss Anne Prettyman had received an accession of pleasurable emotion when she learned that Mr. Crawley had not been sent away scathless, but had been condemned, as it were, to a public trial at the assizes. And yet she would have done anything in her power to save Grace Crawley, or even to save her father. And it must be explained that Miss Anne Prettyman was supposed to be specially efficient in teaching Roman history to her pupils, although she was so manifestly ignorant of the course of law in the country in which she lived. [...] "Committed him," [...] said Miss Prettyman, correcting her sister with scorn. [...] "They have not convicted him. Had they convicted him, there could be no question of bail." [...] "I don't know how all that is, Annabella, but at any rate Major Grantly is to be the bailsman, and there is to be another trial at Barchester." [...] "There cannot be more than one trial in a criminal case," [...] said Miss Prettyman, [...] "unless the jury should disagree, or something of that kind. I suppose he has been committed, and that the trial will take place at the assizes." [...] "Exactly,--that's just it." [...] Had Lord Lufton appeared as lictor, and had Thompson carried the fasces, Miss Anne would have known more about it.|$|E
5000|$|During {{the first}} six seasons, the series {{takes place in the}} fictional seaside town of Storybrooke, Maine, in which the {{residents}} are actually characters from various fairy tales and other stories that were transported to the [...] "real world" [...] town and robbed of their original memories by the Evil Queen Regina (Lana Parrilla) who used a powerful curse obtained from Rumpelstiltskin (Robert Carlyle). The residents of Storybrooke, where Regina is its mayor, have lived an unchanging existence for 28 years, unaware of their own lack of aging. The town's only hope lies with a <b>bail-bonds</b> person named Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison), the daughter of Snow White (Ginnifer Goodwin) and Prince Charming (Josh Dallas), who was transported from the Enchanted Forest to our world via a magic tree as an infant before she could be cursed. As such, she is the only person who can break the curse and restore the characters' lost memories. She is aided by her son, Henry (Jared S. Gilmore), with whom she was recently reunited after giving him up for adoption upon his birth, and his Once Upon a Time book of fairy tales that holds the key to breaking the curse. Henry is also the adopted son of Regina, providing a source of both conflict and common interest between the two women.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} is a {{study of}} the use of discretion in the bail system and also {{a study of the}} oppressive aspects of the bail system in the United States in general and Fulton County, Georgia in particular. Throughout the criminal justice system the fate of a greater number of lives is determined by the discretion of judicial authorities. These judicial authorities determine whether or not defendants will be incarcerated and if so, for how long. Often these judicial authorities are neither aware of nor sensitive to problems and frustrations of the defendants. Hence the discretion of judicial authorities might be detrimental to the defendant. Because of discretion in the <b>bail-bonding</b> system, men and women in American are held in jails and experience prison life for extended periods of time before their trials because they are not able to acquire bail. Often these people are found innocent of any wrong doing. The problems this study focuses upon are to determine if through the use of discretion bail is used as a tool of social control for political activists, whether or not bail for Black people is higher than that of white people committing the same and whether or not bail for males is higher than that of females committing the same crime. Also this study focuses upon whether or not bail is higher during periods of political and/or social disorder as compared to relatively stable periods in our society. This study was based upon primary data compiled from the files of the Fulton County Jail and the Atlanta Historical Society archives. Additionally, data were generated from the employment of three major research techniques. The techniques were interviewing, administering questionnaires and a survey of the literature. While conducting interviews, open ended questions were used in order to obtain meaningful responses from those persons being interviewed. The persons interviewed were judges, lawyers and bondsmen in Fulton County, Georgia. The files of the Fulton County Jail and the Atlanta Historical Society archives were surveyed to get an accurate account of bail given to defendants for certain crimes with data stratified as to race, age, occupation and sex of the defendants. The crimes surveyed were first offender cases of theft by taking, murder, rape, prostitution, and burglary. The Random Start Regular Interval method of collecting data was employed. In reviewing the literature, the libraries of Atlanta University, Atlanta Historical Society, Emory University, Georgia State University, Georgia Institute of Technology, Kennesaw College, the Atlanta Public Library, and my personal library were most helpful. This study is composed of six chapters and a conclusion to empirically analyze the bail system in its functional processes and to gauge the impact of judicial discretion on the administration of bail. Chapter I presents the introduction, methodology and a review of the literature. In Chapter II, a historical analysis of the bail system is given. The origin of the present bail system is discussed and an explanation of the nature, purpose and use of bail is given. Methods of obtaining pretrial release are surveyed to determine how each method will benefit a certain segment of the population. Also, included in this chapter are Supreme Court Cases pertinent to bail and its administration to show the legal foundation upon which the bail system and bondsmen operate. Chapter III assesses the characteristics of recipients of bail. Here, a general discussion of bail and judicial discretion, as they relate to the poor, minorities and Black political activists is presented in an effort to measure the difference in bail administration if any exist. Case studies of the effects that the administration of bail and judicial discretion had on the Black Panthers, Martin Luther King, Jr., Angela Davis, and Hosea Williams are presented. Chapter IV is an analysis {{of the results of the}} questionnaires and interviews administered. The findings here are juxtaposed to that of the literature in hopes of supplementing material on the subject matter. Chapter V is an analysis of data collected from the Fulton County Jail Dockets and the files of the Fulton County Jail. The data are analyzed to determine if judicial discretion in the awarding of bail is evenly and justly administered to all people regardless of race, age, sex or occupation. The period covered is from 1950 - 1978. Chapter VI determines the relationship of social change and/or social disorder to change in the administration of bail. Primarily this section seeks to discover if through the use of judicial discretion bail is a tool of social control. The last part of this chapter is an analysis of the reaction of the bail system to social and political disorder. The final section of this research effort consists of the conclusion of this study. This study concludes that through judicial discretion, blacks, poor people, males and political activists are victimized and discriminated against in the administration of bail in Fulton County, Georgia in particular and the United States in general. It also concludes the present system of administering bail is not economically sound. It further concludes that bail is a means of social control and that bail has been used to drain funds and dis band politically active groups in the United States. A final conclusion of this study is that before racism, sexism and other types of discrimination are alleviated in the bail system, it has to first be alleviated from the entire society...|$|R

5000|$|The Bronx Freedom Fund {{bailed out}} nearly 200 people from 2007 to 2009.

The bill, sponsored by Senator Rivera, passed unanimously through both chambers of the state legislature in 2011. It was vetoed by Governor Andrew Cuomo, and a revised bill passed in 2012.

50|$|Once {{publishers}} {{learned of}} the provisions, the repressive measure encountered strong opposition. All the native associations irrespective of religion, caste and creed denounced the measure and kept their protests alive. All the prominent leaders of Bengal and India condemned the Act as unwarranted and unjustified, and demanded its immediate withdrawal. The newspapers themselves kept criticizing the measure without end. The succeeding administration of Lord Ripon reviewed the developments consequent upon the Act and finally withdrew it. However, the resentment it produced among Indians helped fuel Indiaâs growing independence movement. The Indian Association,Â which is {{generally considered to be}} one of theÂ precursorsÂ of theÂ Indian National Congress, was one of the Act's biggest critics. The crucial demand for a judicial trial in case of an accusation of sedition against an editor was never conceded by the government, although in October I878 the act was modified in minor respect; the submission of proofs before publication was no longer insisted upon, although the <b>bail-bond</b> remained.|$|E
