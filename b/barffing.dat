50|$|He contested the two-member Hokitika {{electorate}} in 1876 with <b>Barff,</b> Richard Seddon, Robert Reid and Conrad Hoos. Button {{had known}} Seddon professionally, {{as they were}} both lawyers and often argued cases as opponents.

Thus Button (and <b>Barff)</b> caused Seddon's only ever defeat at an election; Seddon is to date New Zealand's longest-serving Prime Minister. When Hokitika electorate constituents passed a resolution in 1878 that thanked Button but expressed regret {{that he did not}} support Sir George Grey, Button handed in his resignation.

50|$|<b>Barff</b> {{was born}} in the English county of Kent on 5 March 1833, {{probably}} at Lee (now part of Greater London), where he was baptised five months later. He first came to New Zealand to join the West Coast Gold Rush in the mid-1860s. The West Coast was initially part of the Canterbury Province and following a requisition in October 1865, he was first elected as the member of the West Coast Goldfields electorate in the following month. <b>Barff</b> and Evan Prosser, who was elected at the same time, were the first members from the West Coast on the Canterbury Provincial Council. In July 1866, <b>Barff</b> became a member for the Westland electorate. He remained a member of the Canterbury Provincial Council until December 1867. The Westland district separated from the Canterbury Province on 1 January 1868, and <b>Barff</b> joined the Westland County, which was the predecessor to Westland Province. During the existence of Westland County (January 1868 - November 1873), <b>Barff</b> represented the ridings of Westland, Ōkārito, and Arahura. He did not join the Westland Provincial Council, but stood for the first election in January 1874 as one of three candidates in the two-member Arahura electorate (incorrectly referred to as 'Waimea' in some sources). Much to his surprise, he was defeated with 120 votes by Richard Seddon and Houlahan, who were equal at 145 votes.He represented the Westland South electorate in the House of Representatives from 1868 to 1870, when he was defeated for Hokitika by John White.
