5|$|Archosaurs (crocodilians and <b>birds)</b> <b>and</b> <b>mammals</b> show {{complete}} {{separation of}} the heart into two pumps {{for a total of}} four heart chambers; it is thought that the four-chambered heart of archosaurs evolved independently from that of mammals. In crocodilians, there is a small opening, the foramen of Panizza, {{at the base of the}} arterial trunks and there is some degree of mixing between the blood in each side of the heart, during a dive underwater; thus, only in <b>birds</b> <b>and</b> <b>mammals</b> are the two streams of blood – those to the pulmonary and systemic circulations – permanently kept entirely separate by a physical barrier.|$|E
5|$|It {{and similar}} animals may {{possibly}} be the common {{ancestors of the}} broad swath of all vertebrate terrestrial fauna: amphibians, reptiles, <b>birds,</b> <b>and</b> <b>mammals.</b> The first well-preserved Tiktaalik fossils were found in 2004 on Ellesmere Island in Nunavut, Canada.|$|E

5|$|Fish do {{not possess}} {{parathyroid}} glands; several species {{have been found to}} express parathyroid hormone. Developmental genes and calcium-sensing receptors in fish gills are similar to those within the parathyroid glands of <b>birds</b> <b>and</b> <b>mammals.</b> It has been suggested that the tetrapod glands may have been evolutionarily derived from these fish gills.|$|E
5|$|Individual F. aurea {{trees are}} common on dairy farms in La Cruz, Cañitas and Santa Elena in Costa Rica, {{since they are}} often spared when forest is {{converted}} to pasture. In interviews, farmers identified the species as useful for fence posts, live fencing and firewood, and as a food species for wild <b>birds</b> <b>and</b> <b>mammals.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{circuits}} in the cerebellum {{are similar}} across all classes of vertebrates, including fish, reptiles, <b>birds,</b> <b>and</b> <b>mammals.</b> There {{is also an}} analogous brain structure in cephalopods with well-developed brains, such as octopuses.

5|$|Cleaning {{symbiosis}} is {{a mutually}} beneficial association between individuals of two species, where one (the cleaner) removes and eats parasites {{and other materials}} {{from the surface of}} the other (the client). Cleaning symbiosis is well-known among marine fish, where some small species of cleaner fish, notably wrasses but also species in other genera, are specialised to feed almost exclusively by cleaning larger fish and other marine animals. Other cleaning symbioses exist between <b>birds</b> <b>and</b> <b>mammals,</b> and in other groups.|$|E
5|$|Fossil {{footprints}} {{show that}} pterosaurs stood {{with the entire}} foot {{in contact with the}} ground (plantigrade), {{in a manner similar to}} many mammals like humans and bears. Footprints from azhdarchids and several unidentified species show that pterosaurs walked with an erect posture with their four limbs held almost vertically beneath the body, an energy-efficient stance used by most modern <b>birds</b> <b>and</b> <b>mammals,</b> rather than the sprawled limbs of modern reptiles. Indeed, erect-limbs may be omnipresent in pterosaurs.|$|E
5|$|The French {{zoologist}} Etienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire {{showed in}} 1818 in his theorie d'analogue ("theory of homologues") that structures were shared between fishes, reptiles, <b>birds,</b> <b>and</b> <b>mammals.</b> When Geoffroy went further and sought homologies between Georges Cuvier's embranchements, such as vertebrates and molluscs, his claims triggered the 1830 Cuvier-Geoffroy debate. Geoffroy stated {{the principle of}} connections, namely that {{what is important is}} the relative position of different structures and their connections to each other.|$|E
50|$|He {{also was}} known for his {{expertise}} as a collector of <b>bird</b> <b>and</b> <b>mammal</b> specimens, <b>and</b> Cheyenne crafts. During this period, he also worked with anthropologist Frank Hamilton Cushing in documenting Plains Indian Sign Language.|$|R
50|$|Predators likely include snakes, <b>birds,</b> <b>and</b> small <b>mammals.</b> To escape predation, P. yonahlossee {{produces}} secretions {{from its}} tail that are noxious to <b>birds</b> <b>and</b> other <b>mammals.</b> Also, after initial contact, they become immobile, making them harder to detect, which may increase survival from visual predators.|$|R
50|$|Pratt has {{illustrated}} {{at least}} 20 books, including several plates in the Handbook of the Birds of the World and he created several <b>bird</b> <b>and</b> <b>mammal</b> {{paintings in the}} Encyclopædia Britannica, despite having no formal art training.|$|R
5|$|The book's general {{method is}} to present {{a wide range of}} {{examples}} from across the animal kingdom of each type of coloration, including marine invertebrates and fishes as well as terrestrial insects, amphibians, reptiles, <b>birds</b> <b>and</b> <b>mammals.</b> The examples are supported by a large number of Cott's own drawings, diagrams, and photographs. This essentially descriptive natural history treatment is supplemented with accounts of experiments by Cott and others. The book had few precedents, but to some extent follows (and criticises) Abbott Handerson Thayer's 1909 Concealing-Coloration in the Animal Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|The {{house sparrow}} is {{strongly}} associated with human habitations, and can live in urban or rural settings. Though found in widely varied habitats and climates, it typically avoids extensive woodlands, grasslands, and deserts away from human development. It feeds mostly on the seeds of grains and weeds, {{but it is an}} opportunistic eater and commonly eats insects and many other foods. Its predators include domestic cats, hawks, owls, and many other predatory <b>birds</b> <b>and</b> <b>mammals.</b>|$|E
5|$|Therian mammals {{took over}} the medium- to large-sized {{ecological}} niches in the Cenozoic, after the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event approximately 66 million years ago emptied ecological space once filled by non-avian dinosaurs and other groups of reptiles, as well as various other mammal groups, and underwent an exponential increase in body size (megafauna). Then mammals diversified very quickly; both <b>birds</b> <b>and</b> <b>mammals</b> show an exponential rise in diversity. For example, the earliest known bat dates from about 50 million years ago, only 16 million years after the extinction of the dinosaurs.|$|E
5000|$|Echidnophaga gallinacea, {{commonly}} known as the hen flea, stickfast flea and sticktight flea, occurs {{on a wide range of}} <b>bird</b> <b>and</b> <b>mammal</b> hosts. If uncontrolled it causes anaemia, loss of condition, severe skin irritation and sometimes death.|$|R
50|$|They prey on <b>birds</b> <b>and</b> small <b>mammals.</b>|$|R
25|$|Dense swarms can {{elicit a}} feeding frenzy among fish, <b>birds</b> <b>and</b> <b>mammal</b> predators, {{especially}} near the surface. When disturbed, a swarm scatters, and some individuals have even been observed to moult instantaneously, leaving the exuvia behind as a decoy.|$|R
5|$|Vision is an {{important}} sensory system for most species of fish. Fish eyes {{are similar to those}} of terrestrial vertebrates like <b>birds</b> <b>and</b> <b>mammals,</b> but have a more spherical lens. Their retinas generally have both rods and cones (for scotopic and photopic vision), and most species have colour vision. Some fish can see ultraviolet and some can see polarized light. Amongst jawless fish, the lamprey has well-developed eyes, while the hagfish has only primitive eyespots. Fish vision shows adaptation to their visual environment, for example deep sea fishes have eyes suited to the dark environment.|$|E
5|$|Albany {{has been}} a center of {{transportation}} for much of its history. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, Albany saw development of the turnpike and by 1815, Albany was the turnpike center of the state. Simeon De Witt developed a grid block system in 1794, and renamed streets for <b>birds</b> <b>and</b> <b>mammals</b> that had honored British royalty. This grid was intersected by the major arterials coming out of Albany, which cut through the city at unexpected angles. The construction of the turnpike across the state, in conjunction with canal and railroad systems, made Albany the hub of transportation for pioneers going to Buffalo and the Michigan Territory in the early- and mid-19th century.|$|E
5|$|American {{alligators}} are apex {{predators and}} consume fish, amphibians, reptiles, <b>birds,</b> <b>and</b> <b>mammals.</b> Hatchlings feed mostly on invertebrates. They {{play an important}} role as ecosystem engineers in wetland ecosystems through the creation of alligator holes, which provide both wet and dry habitats for other organisms. Throughout the year, but particularly during the breeding season, American alligators bellow to declare territory and locate suitable mates. Male American alligators use infrasound to attract females. Eggs are laid in a nest of vegetation, sticks, leaves, and mud in a sheltered spot in or near the water. Young are born with yellow bands around their bodies and are protected by their mother for up to one year.|$|E
50|$|In the United States, ferrets were {{relatively}} rare pets until the 1980s. A government {{study by the}} California State <b>Bird</b> <b>and</b> <b>Mammal</b> Conservation Program estimated that by 1996 about 800,000 domestic ferrets were being kept as pets in the United States.|$|R
40|$|The maximum {{likelihood}} model estimated significantly positive slopes {{for the relationship}} between l (support interval, 0. 0076 to 0. 0117), m (support interval, 0. 0046 to 0. 0135), and latitude for the combined data set of <b>bird</b> <b>and</b> <b>mammal</b> sister species (Fig. 2). Results were similar when maximum haplotype or oldest phylogroup splits were used to correct for lag times, and only the correction with haplotypes is reported here. Estimated speciation and extinction rates were lowest at the equator and increased significantly toward the poles (Fig. 2). The same trends were obtained when excluding sister-species pairs with combined latitudinal ranges greater than 40 ° <b>and</b> when <b>bird</b> <b>and</b> <b>mammal</b> data sets were fit separately...|$|R

5|$|As {{a center}} for trade and travel between the U.S., the Caribbean, and South America, South Florida is {{especially}} vulnerable to invasive species, or species {{of plants and animals}} that adapt aggressively to conditions in the Everglades, allowing them to reproduce faster and grow larger than they would naturally in their native environments. Approximately 26% of all species of fish, reptiles, <b>birds,</b> <b>and</b> <b>mammals</b> in South Florida are exotic—more than in any other part of the U.S.—and the region hosts one of the highest numbers of exotic plant species in the world. Controlling invasive species in 1,700,000 acres (6,900km2) of infested land in South Florida costs authorities about $500 million a year.|$|E
5|$|Frogs and {{all other}} living {{tetrapods}} have a rod-like bone called the stapes that aids in hearing by transferring vibrations from the ear drum —or homologous tympanum— to the inner ear. Temnospondyls also have a stapes, which projects into the otic cavity. The stapes likely evolved from the hyomandibula of lobe-finned fishes. The positioning of the stapes and {{the shape of the}} otic region suggests that the tympani of temnospondyls and frogs are homologous, but the tympani of these amphibians are no longer considered homologous with the hearing systems of reptiles, <b>birds,</b> <b>and</b> <b>mammals.</b> Therefore, ear structures in temnospondyls were not ancestral to those of all other tetrapods.|$|E
5|$|Historically, insects {{have been}} the most {{significant}} herbivores, and the evolution of land plants is closely associated with the evolution of insects. While most plant defenses are directed against insects, other defenses have evolved that are aimed at vertebrate herbivores, such as <b>birds</b> <b>and</b> <b>mammals.</b> The study of plant defenses against herbivory is important, not only from an evolutionary view point, but also in the direct impact that these defenses have on agriculture, including human and livestock food sources; as beneficial 'biological control agents' in biological pest control programs; {{as well as in the}} search for plants of medical importance.|$|E
50|$|Donald Ryder Dickey (1887-1932) was an American ornithologist, mammalogist, {{and nature}} photographer. He {{collected}} 50,000 specimens and produced 7,500 photographs and moving images of nature subjects. At his death, {{his collection of}} <b>bird</b> <b>and</b> <b>mammal</b> specimens was the largest private collection in the United States.|$|R
50|$|Galway's Land Bird Sanctuary, {{close to}} Lake Gregory, {{is an area}} of montane forest a few {{kilometers}} east of the town. Covering an area of 0.6 km2 it is home to many <b>bird</b> <b>and</b> <b>mammal</b> species endemic to Sri-Lanka, including wild boar and barking deer.|$|R
40|$|Hunting {{is a major}} {{driver of}} {{biodiversity}} loss, but a systematic large-scale estimate of hunting-induced defaunation is lacking. We synthesized 176 studies to quantify hunting-induced declines of <b>mammal</b> <b>and</b> <b>bird</b> populations across the tropics. <b>Bird</b> <b>and</b> <b>mammal</b> abundances declined by 58 % (25 to 76 %) and by 83 % (72 to 90 %) in hunted compared with unhunted areas. <b>Bird</b> <b>and</b> <b>mammal</b> populations were depleted within 7 and 40 kilometers from hunters' access points (roads and settlements). Additionally, hunting pressure was higher in areas with better accessibility to major towns where wild meat could be traded. Mammal population densities were lower outside protected areas, particularly because of commercial hunting. Strategies to sustainably manage wild meat hunting in both protected and unprotected tropical ecosystems are urgently needed to avoid further defaunation. </p...|$|R
