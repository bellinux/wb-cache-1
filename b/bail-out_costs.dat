40|$|Trading {{pension claims}} would kill many birds with one stone: an {{accurate}} valuation of pension liabilities {{would provide a}} measurable yardstick for plan managers; beneficiaries {{would be able to}} diversify the idiosyncratic risk of their plan sponsors; systematic risk could be reallocated to comply with individual risk/return preferences. The consequence would be an alignment of incentives to fully fund plans, lower agency and governmental <b>bail-out</b> <b>costs,</b> and an increase in general welfare. Underfunded Pension Plans and the Risks on Pensioners It is widely believed nowadays that defined pension plans are underfunded. According to Wilshire Associates Research, only 62 of the 331 corporations contained in the S&P 500 Index that maintain defined benefit plans had pension assets that equaled or exceeded liabilities in 2003, and the median corporate funded ratio of all 331 firms was 82 %. The unfunded portion of a pension plan amounts in many firms to a sizeable fraction of the company’s net worth. Even worse, funded ratios for terminating plans are generally much lower.

40|$|This article aims {{to offer}} a {{contribution}} to the debate on {{the pros and cons of}} higher Þnancial openness with respect to growth. It analyses two closed economies instantaneously open to trade and Þnancial movements. Openness to trade is without frictions and entails a built-in positive shock to capital productivity. Internationalisation of banking may be allowed either under Commer-cial Presence (CP) mode- whereby banks of any origin can establish anywhere but at a higher set up costs- or under the Cross Border (CB) mode, whereby banks offering their services over the phone or other me-dia, can only count on the domestic saving pool to Þnance their activity. The point of view in the paper is that of a benevolent risk-adverse regula-tor who cares for her own costs in terms of recapitalisation of the Þnancial system in case of crisis. Results show that the Þnancially open economy may show a higher growth than the Þnancially autarkic one after a certain capital per capita threshold, depending on the asymmetric impact on Þxed and variable costs in the different modes of operation, but the net regulatory burden, deÞned as the <b>bail-out</b> <b>costs</b> in case of a crisis, always increases. Also a low capital per capita former autarkic country wishing to integrate with a higher capital per capita country should choose the CB mode of operation to reap the beneÞt of a higher growth at earlier stage of development...|$|E
40|$|TR] 2010 yilinin ikinci ceyreginde Yunanistan’da beliren borc krizi kisa surede kamu ve bankacilik kesimlerinde sorun yasayan diger euro bolgesi cevre ekonomilerine yayilmistir. Cevre ulkelerdeki sorunlarin giderilmesi icin gerekli finansmanin onemli bir kisminin merkez ulkelere yuklenmesi, cevre ve merkez ulkeler arasindaki yapisal farkliliklar ve parasal birligin dagilma ihtimali tartismalarini da beraberinde getirmistir. Bu notta, parasal birlikten ayrilma kararinin merkez ve cevre ulkeler acisindan degerlendirmesi yapilmaktadir. Ilk bakista eurodan vazgecmenin cevre ulkeler acisindan rekabet gucu avantaji yaratmak suretiyle uretim artisi saglama potansiyeli tasidigi gorulmekte olsa dahi, derinlemesine yapilan bir inceleme parasal birlikten ayrilma kararinin ekonomik maliyetinin oldukca yuksek oldugunu ortaya koymaktadir. Ote yandan, parasal birlikten ayrilma karari merkez ulkeler acisindan cevre ulkeleri finanse etme yukunden kurtulma imkani saglasa dahi, finansal baglantilarin guclulugu olumsuz etkileri beraberinde getirebilecektir. [EN] The debt crisis, {{emerged in}} Greece {{in the second}} quarter of 2010, has quickly spread among the other {{peripheral}} countries of the euro zone with troubled fiscal and banking sectors. The fact that a significant portion of the <b>bail-out</b> <b>costs</b> of the periphery countries was put on the core countries has given rise to the debate on the structural differences between the cores and the peripheries; and ignited the discussion on the possibility of the disintegration of the monetary union. This note assesses the decision of leaving the euro from the perspective of both periphery and core economies. Although at a first glance the euro break-up seems to have the potential to boost economic growth in peripheries through more competitive currency rates, an in-depth analysis illustrates that the economic cost of leaving the euro is rather high. As for the core countries, while leaving the monetary union presents an opportunity to abate the burden of financing periphery debt in the face of maintaining the common currency, the strength of the financial linkages are likely to bring about negative effects. ...|$|E
