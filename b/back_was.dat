5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1937, after midnight one night, Tesla left the Hotel New Yorker to make his regular commute to the cathedral and the library to feed the pigeons.

His <b>back</b> <b>was</b> severely wrenched and three of his ribs were broken in the accident. The full extent of his injuries were never known; Tesla refused to consult a doctor, an almost lifelong custom, and never fully recovered.|$|E

5|$|Napoleon, {{expecting to}} win the war, delayed too long and lost this opportunity; by December the Allies had {{withdrawn}} the offer. When his <b>back</b> <b>was</b> to the wall in 1814 he tried to reopen peace negotiations {{on the basis of}} accepting the Frankfurt proposals. The Allies now had new, harsher terms that included the retreat of France to its 1791 boundaries, which meant the loss of Belgium. Napoleon would remain Emperor, however he rejected the term. The British wanted Napoleon permanently removed; they prevailed. Napoleon adamantly refused.|$|E
5|$|Several nearby office blocks {{were hit}} {{so badly that}} almost every window, front and <b>back,</b> <b>was</b> blown in as the {{explosion}} ripped through them.

The roof {{of at least one}} house was blown off. Buildings in the vicinity were evacuated by police, {{not only because of the}} smoke and possibility of more explosions, but because of the danger of structural damage making the buildings unstable.|$|E

5|$|The <b>back</b> <b>was</b> also reconstructed {{in a more}} or less {{horizontal}} orientation by Borsuk-Białynicka, which was followed by most subsequent depictions. In a 2007 study, Daniela Schwarz and colleagues suggested that the back dipped towards the rear. According to these researchers, the shoulder blade would have been inclined at a horizontal angle of 55–65°, much steeper than previously thought, resulting in an elevated shoulder region. With the vertebral column of the trunk and neck held in a relatively straight line, this would result in an elevated position of the head.|$|E

5|$|The {{locality}} where Batrachotomus lived was a swampy {{region and}} the name comes from the Greek batrachos/βάτραχος (frog) and tome/τομή (cutting, slicing), which refers to its preying on the large amphibian Mastodonsaurus. In contrast with sprawling reptiles, like crocodiles, this large carnivore was very agile with locomotor superiority due to its erect stance. A remarkable feature seen on its <b>back</b> <b>was</b> a row of paired, flattened bony plates. Batrachotomus was possibly an early relative of Postosuchus, which lived during {{the dawn of the}} dinosaurs.|$|E

5|$|After another knee {{operation}} and rehabilitation period, Sayers attempted a comeback for the 1971 season. He was {{kept out of}} the first three games after carrying the ball only twice in the preseason, as Bears head coach Jim Dooley planned to slowly work him back into the rotation. His first game <b>back</b> <b>was</b> against the New Orleans Saints on October 10, in which he carried eight times for 30 yards. After the game, he told reporters he was satisfied with his performance and that his knee felt fine. The following week, against the 49ers, he carried five times before injuring his ankle in the first quarter, an injury that ultimately caused him to miss the remainder of the season. He was encouraged to retire but decided to give football one last try. Sayers' final game was in the 1972 preseason in which he fumbled twice in three carries; he retired from professional football days later.|$|E
5|$|Australia's success {{came at a}} cost, with Lindwall {{injured and}} unable to bowl in the lead-up to the Second Test, missing the {{intervening}} matches against Northamptonshire and Yorkshire. The heavy workload on Miller caused by Lindwall's breaking down mid-Test generated severe back pain, {{and he was still}} not fully recovered by the start of the Second Test at Lord's. Lindwall was subjected to a thorough fitness test on the first morning of the Lord's Test. Bradman was not convinced of Lindwall's fitness, but the bowler's protestations were sufficient to convince his captain to risk his inclusion. Australia won the toss and elected to bat, allowing Lindwall further time to recover from his injury. Miller also played, but still nursing his <b>back,</b> <b>was</b> unfit to bowl.|$|E

5|$|Early in Tyler's {{final year}} at Washington, {{injuries}} to the Huskies' halfbacks prompted head coach Don James {{to move him}} there from fullback. Washington finished 8–2 in the regular season, earning them {{a trip to the}} 1981 Rose Bowl against the Michigan Wolverines. With the score tied at zero in the first quarter, Tyler fumbled at the one-yard line; Michigan {{went on to win the}} game 23–6. The running <b>back</b> <b>was</b> drafted 222nd overall (first in the ninth round) by the New Orleans Saints in the 1981 NFL Draft. He played two seasons with the Saints, appearing in all 23 games over those two seasons. Before the 1983 NFL season, the Saints cut him in order to meet the limit on how many players a team may have. He then went on to a short stint with the Oakland Invaders, and then tried to make the Minnesota Vikings. He now lives in Kent, Washington, where he works as a juvenile detention officer.|$|E
