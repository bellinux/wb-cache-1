2500|$|IGN writer Matt Fowler {{gave the}} episode a {{complimentary}} review. Like A.V. Club review, Fowler started {{by claiming that}} the episode was [...] "not as tragically serene as the premiere episode" [...] or [...] "as good as the pilot". He noted that [...] "the show has also ramped up the tension between Britten and his partners". Fowler was [...] "happy that the investigation all came together and made sense". He called parts of the episode [...] "dramatic" [...] and [...] "irony". He stated that the ending scene of the episode [...] "introduces a full-on conspiracy into the mix, is risky, but I'm still in", [...] "I fear that some folks might start to drop off from this show now simply <b>because</b> <b>once</b> <b>you</b> start defining something that was previously unexplained, you're going to lose those who had different ideas stubbornly cemented in their heads". Fowler gave the episode a [...] "8.5 out of 10" [...] score, classifying it as [...] "great". TV Fanatic round table team (including Carissa Pavlica, Lindey Kempton, Carla Day and Nick McHatton) were pleased with the episode. Pavlica claimed that it was [...] "much better than [...] anticipated". McHatton simply wrote that the episode did [...] "really well". Kempton though [...] that [...] "Rex's motorcycle was a nice touch, personal and not unrealistic, and it helped start developing his character a little bit".|$|E
2500|$|A {{fourth class}} of racing in BMX which are held at local and {{national}} events are called Opens. Opens are largely exhibition and are a chance to test yourself and practice against better competition without jeopardizing your point standings. You must be registered to race in a points race {{to sign up for}} the Open events. No points are awarded for Opens although trophy places are and the moto qualification rounds are similar to the point races. These are races with more flexible skill level and age requirements. In Opens there are no Novice, Intermediate and Expert divisions. All amateur skill levels are free to participate. The age groupings are generally broader, for example 13-14 open class as opposed to 13 Intermediate and 14 Intermediate being separate groupings for those ages in the points races. Girls may also participate in the male Open class within the proper age ranges. However expert boys are not allowed in these [...] "Mixed" [...] opens. Then an Expert Open is held in that event. The pros are excluded from racing with the amateurs if enough pros are at hand to race that a separate Pro-Open class can be created. If not, then the pros can race in the amateur Open with some restrictions. This is called a Pro-Am event. Except for the Pro-Am exception the Expert racers usually wins the open class. Even if there are Pros in the Open, {{it is not unusual for}} an older Expert-17-18 age class for example-to win since many have the talent and speed to be a pro but have not yet taken the opportunity, partly <b>because</b> <b>once</b> <b>you</b> go Pro, you can go back to amateur only under very strict circumstances.|$|E

I don't know when we may actually be in Europe, but I promise you that as soon as we touch a suitable port I will write to you again, making an appointment for you to see me in London.

[...] Then Mr. Walker,--for Bolivia was in truth Walker,--fetched the wine and ordered the biscuit; and poor Tom was again {{brought back to the}} miserable remedy to which he had before applied himself in his misfortune. There he remained for about an hour, during a part of which he slept; but before he left the house he finished the wine. As he got up to take his departure Mr. Walker scanned his gait and bearing, having a friendly feeling for the young man, and not wishing him to fall again {{into the hands of the}} police. But Tom walked forth apparently as sober as a judge, and as melancholy as a hangman. As far as Mr. Walker could see the liquor had made no impression on him.

50|$|Consistency {{allows us}} to more {{effectively}} make decisions and process information. The concept of consistency states that if a person commits, either orally or in writing, {{he or she is}} more likely to honor that particular commitment. This is especially true for written commitments, as they appear psychologically more concrete and can be backed up with hard proof. Once a person commits to a stance, he or she has a tendency to behave according to that commitment. Commitment is an effective persuasive technique <b>because</b> <b>once</b> <b>you</b> get someone to make a commitment, {{they are more likely to}} engage in self-persuasion, providing themselves and others with reasons and justifications to support his or her commitment in order to avoid dissonance.|$|E

Andy liked the ball early and over the top, rather than worrying about a lot of build-up play. That was fine <b>because,</b> <b>once</b> <b>you</b> got him in behind the opposition defence, he was a fantastic finisher. Off the field he was a great lad.
