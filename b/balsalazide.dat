40|$|OBJECTIVE: <b>Balsalazide</b> {{is a novel}} azo-bonded 5 -aminosal-icylic acid {{treatment}} for mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis. The study objective was to compare symptomatic remission rates with <b>balsalazide</b> and mesalamine while controlling for extent of disease and time since diagnosis in patients with active, mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis. METHODS: A total of 173 patients with sigmoidoscopically verified ulcerative colitis were randomized to 8 wk of dou-ble-blind treatment with <b>balsalazide</b> 6. 75 g/day or me-salamine 2. 4 g/day. Both treatments provided 2. 4 g/day of oral 5 -aminosalicylic acid. Patients maintained symptom diaries throughout the treatment period. RESULTS: Overall, 46 % of balsalazide- and 44 % of me-salamine-treated patients achieved symptomatic remission. Higher response rates were noted in newly diagnosed pa-tients with 40 cm of disease (68 % vs 61 %) than in recently relapsed patients with 40 cm of disease (36 % vs 25 %). The median time to symptomatic remission was 12 days shorter with <b>balsalazide</b> (25 days) than with mesalamine (37 days). Significantly more <b>balsalazide</b> patients showed sig-moidoscopic (p 0. 002), stool frequency (p 0. 006), rectal bleeding (p 0. 006), and physician’s global assess-ment score (p 0. 013) improvement by 14 days than did mesalamine patients. Similar proportions of patients re-ported adverse events (54 % vs 64 %), which were most commonly related to the gastrointestinal and central and peripheral nervous systems. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Balsalazide</b> is an effective and safe treat-ment for mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis. Improvement of symptoms occurs considerably earlier with <b>balsalazide</b> than with mesalamine. (Am J Gastroenterol 2002; 97 : 3078 – 3086. © 2002 by Am. Coll. of Gastroenterology...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND—Balsalazide {{is a new}} 5 -aminosalicylic acid (5 -ASA) {{containing}} prodrug. Its efficacy {{in comparison}} with standard mesalazine therapy and the optimum dose for maintaining remission of ulcerative colitis are still unclear.  AIMS—To compare the relapse preventing effect and safety profile of two doses of <b>balsalazide</b> and a standard dose of Eudragit coated mesalazine.  METHODS—A total of 133  patients with ulcerative colitis in remission were recruited {{to participate in a}} double blind, multicentre, randomised trial: 49  patients received <b>balsalazide</b> 1. 5  g twice daily, 40  received <b>balsalazide</b> 3. 0  g twice daily, and 44  received mesalazine 0. 5  g three times daily. Efficacy assessments were clinical activity index (CAI) and endoscopic score according to Rachmilewitz, and a histological score. In addition, laboratory tests were performed and urinary excretion of 5 -ASA and its metabolite N-Ac- 5 -ASA was analysed. The study lasted for 26  weeks.  RESULTS—Balsalazide 3. 0  g twice daily resulted in a significantly higher clinical remission rate (77. 5 %) than <b>balsalazide</b> 1. 5  g twice daily (43. 8 %) and mesalazine 0. 5  g three times daily (56. 8 %) (p= 0. 006). The respective times to relapse were 161  days, 131  days (p= 0. 003), and 144  days (NS). Accordingly, pairwise contrasts of the final endoscopic score demonstrated a significant difference (p= 0. 005) between the two <b>balsalazide</b> treatment groups while differences between either of these two groups and mesalazine were not statistically significant. Patients treated with <b>balsalazide</b> excreted less 5 -ASA and N-Ac- 5 -ASA than patients receiving mesalazine but these differences were not statistically significant. Discontinuation of the trial because of adverse effects occurred in nine patients: three in the <b>balsalazide</b> 1. 5  g twice daily group, two in the <b>balsalazide</b> 3. 0  g twice daily group, and four in the mesalazine 0. 5  g three times daily group. No clinically important new drug safety related findings were identified in this study.  CONCLUSIONS—High dose <b>balsalazide</b> (3. 0  g twice daily) was superior in maintaining remission in patients with ulcerative colitis compared with a low dose (1. 5  g twice daily) or a standard dose of mesalazine (0. 5  g three times daily). All three treatments were safe and well tolerated.    Keywords: balsalazide; mesalazine; aminosalicylic acid; ulcerative coliti...|$|E

40|$|Intestinal luminal pH in {{inflammatory}} bowel disease: possible determinants {{and implications}} for therapy with aminosalicylates and other drugs Summary Measurements of luminal pH in the normal gastro-intestinal tract have shown a progressive increase in pH from the duodenum to the terminal ileum, {{a decrease in the}} caecum, and then a slow rise along the colon to the rectum. Some data in patients with ulcerative colitis suggest a substantial reduction below normal values in the right colon, while limited results in Crohn’s disease have been contradictory. Determinants of luminal pH in the colon include mucosal bicarbonate and lactate production, bacterial fermentation of carbohydrates and mucosal absorption of short chain fatty acids, and possibly intestinal transit. Alterations in these factors, as a result of mucosal disease and changes in diet, are likely to explain abnormal pH measurements in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). It is conceivable that reduced intracolonic pH in active ulcerative colitis impairs bioavailability of 5 -aminosalicylic acid from pH dependent release formulations (Asacol, Salofalk) and those requiring cleavage by bacterial azo reductase (sulphasalazine, olsalazine, <b>balsalazide),</b> but fur-ther pharmacokinetic studies are needed to confirm this possibility. Reports that <b>balsalazide</b> and olsalazine may be more eYcacious in active and quiescent ulcerative colitis, respectively, than Asacol suggest that low pH may be a more critical factor in patients taking directly pH depend-ent release than azo bonded preparations. Reduced intracolonic pH also needs to be considered in the development of pH dependent colonic release formula-tions of budesonide and azathioprine for use in ulcerative and Crohn’s colitis.

The slow NAT phenotype increases susceptibility to hydralazine and isoniazid toxicity and to occupational bladder cancer. The two polymorphic human NAT loci show linkage disequilibrium. All mammalian Nat genes have an intronless {{open reading frame}} and non-coding exons. The human gene products NAT 1 and NAT 2 have distinct substrate specificities: NAT 2 acetylates hydralazine and human NAT 1 acetylates p-aminosalicylate (p-AS) and the folate catabolite para-aminobenzoylglutamate (p-abaglu). Human NAT 2 is mainly in liver and gut. Human NAT 1 and its murine homologue are in many adult tissues and in early embryos. Human NAT 1 is strongly expressed in oestrogen receptor-positive breast cancer and may contribute to folate and acetyl CoA homeostasis. NAT enzymes act through a catalytic triad of Cys, His and Asp with {{the architecture of the}} active site-modulating specificity. Polymorphisms may cause unfolded protein.

40|$|Radiotherapy {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the treatment of pelvic tumors. The advances in patients’ prognosis come at the expense of radiation-induced toxicity. Progressive cell depletion and inflammation are the leading mechanisms of acute toxicity which is observed during or shortly after treatment. The pathogenetic pathways of late toxicity, developing 90 days after the onset of radiotherapy, are more complex and involve processes such as vascular sclerosis and fibrosis. Since many patients have become long-term survivors, awareness and recognition of treatment-related toxicity has gained in importance and increased efforts are made for its prevention and management. Technical innovations contribute to a reduction in radiotherapy-associated toxicity. The steep dose gradients of highly-conformal radiotherapy techniques allow for an accurate dose delivery with optimal sparing of the normal tissues. Several studies have demonstrated the dosimetrical benefit of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and volumetric modulated radiotherapy (VMAT) compared to conventional radiotherapy techniques. It has been shown that the dosimetrical benefit of IMRT translated into a clinically significant reduction in lower gastrointestinal toxicity compared with three-field conventional radiotherapy. MRI-linacs and proton therapy are likely to broaden the therapeutic window further in the near future. Prone positioning on a bellyboard reduces small bowel toxicity by pushing away the small bowel loops from the high dose region. Image-guided radiotherapy allows for an accurate definition, localization and monitoring of tumor position, size and shape before and during treatment and may help to reduce set-up margins. Small randomized controlled trials have shown that the administration of several agents might have a beneficial effect for the prevention of acute (e. g. intrarectal amifostine, oral sulfasalazine and <b>balsalazide)</b> and/or late-onset radiation-induced toxicity (intrarectal beclomethasone and oral probiotics). Once severe toxicity develops, total replacement of the diet with elemental formula may be appropriate. Probiotics influence the bacterial microflora and seem promising in reducing the incidence and severity of radiation-induced diarrhea. Currently there is insufficient evidence for cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory drugs in the management of radiation-induced toxicity. Future challenges lie in the prediction of treatment-related toxicity, which might be a promising step towards an individualized risk-adapted treatment. status: publishe...|$|E
