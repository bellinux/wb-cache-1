40|$|IEEE Abstract—Thermal growth effects the {{reliability}} and accuracy of a machine tool, especially, {{as it relates to}} the High Speed Machining (HSM) technology. When axis speeds increase, the effect of thermal expansion of ballscrews will create large positional errors of the axes. In this paper, a piezo-integrated actuator and a load sensor are placed on the machine ballscrews, and the feedback from this arrangement becomes an ideal source for compensation of backlash and thermal expansion. This smart unit provides excellent performance of tolerance, the roundness test report reduced from 18. 1 µm to 10. 00 µm, and large cost savings in the manufacture of the machine tool. 1 - 2 <b>Ballbar</b> <b>test</b> This test was done on a Challenger high speed vertical machining center. This machine utilized a linear construction way to meet the higher speed movement application. A <b>ballbar</b> <b>test</b> without thermal compensation is shown in Fig. 1...|$|E
40|$|Za potrebe lesne industrije je potrebno izdelati 3 osni CNC stroj. Namenjen bo izdelavi lesenih izdelkov ter obdelavi mehkejših kovin. Iz zahtev končnega naročnika smo skonstruirali celotni stroj. Stroj je potrebno zagnati in testirati krmilnik, postprocesor ter uporabo CAM programske opreme. Ob končnem testiranju vseh funkciji smo preverili še natančnost stroj. To smo storili z Ballbar testom. S postopnimi iteracijami merjenja in programske kompenzacije pogreškov, ki jih je podal test, smo poskušali čim bolj izboljšati natančnost stroja. Po končanem umerjanju stroja smo CNC preizkusili še na dejanski aplikaciji in odrezali enostavni kos, na katerem smo opravili meritve. Meritve smo primerjali med modelom v CAD okolju in dejanskim izdelkom. For {{the needs}} of the wood industry, it is {{necessary}} to produce 3 axis CNC machines. It is intended for the production of wood products and the processing of softer metals. From the requirements of the final customer, we constructed the entire machine. We need to start the machine and test the controller, postprocessor and the use of CAM software. At the end of testing all the functions, we checked the accuracy of the machine. We did this with the <b>Ballbar</b> <b>test.</b> With the gradual measurement and program compensation errors, we tried to maximize the accuracy of the machine. After the calibration was completed, the CNC was tested on the actual application and cut off the simple piece on which we performed the measurements. The measurements were compared between the CAD model and the actual product model...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the implementation of}} an improved manufacturing information system for production engineering that was carried out {{over a period of}} 30 months within a Knowledge Transfer Partnership (KTP). The Department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Bath collaborated with the Helander Precision Engineering Company in Tewkesbury. The operations, manufacturing processes and information systems used by Helander are described together with a review of the hard metals used for the precise machining of industrial components manufactured from stainless steel, cobalt-based superalloys and nickel-based superalloys. The thesis contains a review of machining of hard alloys, statistical process control of machining and measurement systems analysis and an experimental study of the Inconel 718 superalloy is included which demonstrates how microstructure and mechanical hardness are affected by the machining process. Methods of process control & process verification for manufacture including the use of gauge R&R are described to verify the accuracy of measurement tools. These methods are applied in two case studies which examine the manufacture of a simple part and a complex part. Helander’s manufacturing processes are reviewed and practical methodologies are implemented for avoiding out of specification machined components. Improved accuracy in machining is achieved by the use of the <b>Ballbar</b> <b>test</b> to check accurate machine tool positioning. A future direction for Helander is additive layer manufacturing for net shape components and trials were undertaken by sub-contractors for Helander. The KTP programme has made significant improvements in process control and understanding of hard to machine materials by integrating industrial and academic expertise in the field of precision engineering...|$|E
40|$|Industry is {{currently}} seeking rapid methods {{to verify the}} accuracy of five-axis machine tools (5 A-MTs) throughout their operational life. The ballbar has previously been reported as a tool used to identify position-independent geometric errors within the rotary axes of 5 A-MTs. At present, {{a minimum of two}} separate <b>ballbar</b> <b>testing</b> set-ups are necessary to identify eight error sources inherent to two rotary axes. This paper presents a method to identify the same errors {{with the use of a}} single <b>ballbar</b> <b>testing</b> set-up. By completely removing the need for operator intervention during or between tests, automation leads to significant reductions in process duration. Error identification is first explained mathematically and later evaluated and proven on a commercial 5 A-MT. Finally, compensation of these errors demonstrates significantly improved 5 -axis contouring capability...|$|R
40|$|<b>Ballbar</b> <b>testing</b> of {{rotary axes}} in 5 -axis machine tools can be {{time-consuming}} and requires {{high levels of}} operator expertise; especially in the set-up process. Faster tests reduce down-time and encourage frequent updates to compensation parameters to reflect {{the current state of}} the machine. A virtual machine tool (VMT) is developed to emulate the machine tool, its geometric errors and the testing procedures. This was used to develop a new single set-up testing method to identify all rotary axis locations errors, whilst remaining robust in the presence of set-up error and linear axis squareness errors. New testing and data processing techniques remove the requirement for fine adjustment of the tool-cup and permit full automation of necessary toolpaths, including transitions. Using the VMT, error identification residuals were found to be 2. 7 % or less. Experiments and statistical analysis then showed that all errors can be measured using a single set-up, and values are sufficiently close to the values measured using conventional multi-set-up procedures to be used in error compensation. This method will significantly reduce set-up durations and removes the need for any modified testing hardware...|$|R
