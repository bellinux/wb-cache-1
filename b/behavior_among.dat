The boys are also frequently confused by the contradictory and hypocritical behavior of their parents and other adults, and often perceive them as having distorted views on morality and society.|$|E
5|$|Another {{widespread}} trait among modern birds is {{parental care}} for young after hatching. Jack Horner's 1978 {{discovery of a}} Maiasaura ("good mother lizard") nesting ground in Montana demonstrated that parental care continued long after birth among ornithopods, suggesting this behavior might also have been common to all dinosaurs. There is evidence that other non-theropod dinosaurs, like Patagonian titanosaurian sauropods, also nested in large groups. A specimen of the Mongolian oviraptorid Citipati osmolskae was discovered in a chicken-like brooding position in 1993, which may indicate that they had begun using an insulating layer of feathers to keep the eggs warm. Parental care being a trait common to all dinosaurs is supported by other finds. For example, a dinosaur embryo (pertaining to the prosauropod Massospondylus) was found without teeth, indicating that some parental care was required to feed the young dinosaurs. Trackways have also confirmed parental <b>behavior</b> <b>among</b> ornithopods from the Isle of Skye in northwestern Scotland. Nests and eggs have been found for most major groups of dinosaurs, and it appears likely that all dinosaurs cared for their young to some extent either before or shortly after hatching.|$|E
5|$|Remains of Deinonychus, {{a closely}} related dromaeosaurid, have {{commonly}} {{been found in}} aggregations of several individuals. Deinonychus has also been found in association with a large herbivore, Tenontosaurus, which {{has been seen as}} evidence of cooperative hunting. The only solid evidence for social <b>behavior</b> <b>among</b> dromaeosaurids comes from a Chinese trackway of fossil footprints, which shows six individuals of a large species moving as a group, though no evidence of cooperative hunting was found. Although many isolated fossils of Velociraptor have been found in Mongolia, none were closely associated with any other individuals. Therefore, while Velociraptor is commonly depicted as a pack hunter, as in Jurassic Park, there is only limited fossil evidence to support this theory for dromaeosaurids in general, and none specific to Velociraptor itself. The pack hunting theory was based on a discovery of several specimens of Deinonychus found around the remains of a Tenontosaurus. No other group of dromaeosaurids has been found in close association.|$|E

40|$|BackgroundIn China, {{childhood}} obesity {{is a growing}} health issue. Eating <b>behaviors</b> <b>among</b> children can be influenced by both the family and school environment. We examine the association between these environments and eating habits among children. MethodsA total of 11 270 fourth to sixth grade school children, 11 270 of their fathers or mothers, and 1348 teachers from 48 schools were sampled using a multistage cluster random sampling method. Questionnaires collected information on eating <b>behaviors</b> <b>among</b> children, non-communicable chronic disease (NCD) -related health knowledge and <b>behaviors</b> <b>among</b> teachers, and education levels among parents. Mixed effect logistic regression models were {{used to describe the}} key associations between eating <b>behaviors</b> <b>among</b> children and teacher and parental characteristics. ResultsHealth awareness, positive health attitudes, never-smoking and regular-exercise among teachers was positively associated with healthy eating <b>behaviors</b> <b>among</b> their students (having breakfast, vegetables and dairy products every day; P < 0. 05), and negatively associated with the unhealthy behaviors (daily intake of fried foods and desserts and sugary beverages; P < 0. 05). More than one parent having a high school level or above was positively related to healthy eating <b>behaviors</b> <b>among</b> their children (P < 0. 05), but its associations with high-calorie eating habits were negative in urban and positive in rural areas (P < 0. 05). ConclusionsSchool-based interventions which target health-related awareness, attitude and <b>behaviors</b> <b>among</b> school teachers may help improve school-aged children 2 ̆ 019 s eating behaviors. Parental education levels may help guide efforts to target children at higher risk of unhealthy eating habits.

25|$|Some {{forms of}} sexual violence, such as gang rape, are {{predominantly}} committed by young men. Sexual aggression {{is often a}} defining characteristic of manhood in the group and is {{significantly related to the}} wish to be held in high esteem.

Research also suggests that men with sexually aggressive peers are also much more likely to report coercive or enforced intercourse outside the gang context than men lacking sexually aggressive peers.

The three traditional levels of management [...] lower, middle, upper [...] were utilized to assure simplicity and consistency. The management styles traditionalist/judicial, troubleshooter/negotiator, catalyst and visionary, {{which are based}} on the Myers-Briggs typologies, provided the necessary style classifications. The ten coping behaviors established by Mann (1969) and later refined by Burke and Belcourt (1974) formed the basis of the Coping Behavior Inventory. The socio-demographic variables of sex, age, income level, education level, and seniority were obtained during the survey to determine if they had any affect on the outcome of the results;The null hypotheses for this study were: (1) There is no difference in use/nonuse of coping <b>behaviors</b> <b>among</b> management styles. (2) There is no difference in use/nonuse of coping <b>behaviors</b> <b>among</b> management levels. (3) There is no interaction in use/nonuse of coping <b>behaviors</b> <b>among</b> management styles and management levels.

Notable non-anthropologists, like Robert Yerkes and Jane Goodall thus argued that since chimpanzees have learned behaviors, they have culture. Today, anthropological primatologists are divided, several arguing that non-human primates have culture, others arguing that they do not.|$|E

25|$|LDP is a {{reactive}} programming language. It {{has been}} used to trigger debugging in the earlier research. With the addition of language that enables the programmer to build operations {{in the development of the}} shape of the matrix, it can be used to analyze the distributed local conditions. It can operate on fixed-size, connected groups of modules providing various functions of state configuration. A program that addresses a fixed-size module rather than the entire ensemble allows programmers to operate the claytronic matrix more frequently and efficiently. LDP further provides a means of matching distributed patterns. It enables the programmer to address a larger set of variables with Boolean logic, which enables the program to search for larger patterns of activity and <b>behavior</b> <b>among</b> groups of modules.|$|E
25|$|Although {{one female}} {{typically}} dominates the reproduction on one colony, {{there is strong}} evidence for co-foundress <b>behavior</b> <b>among</b> P. alternata. Occasionally, the founding of new colonies occurs from the cooperation of two or females. The females stay on the nest for {{a good portion of}} the day but rarely interact. Both co-foundresses contribute to the construction of the nest and overall protection of the colony. Though the associated females share many responsibilities equally, there is evidence that female foundresses with larger ovaries spend more time off the nest, indicating some type of hierarchy based on reproductive ability. One advantage in associative nesting is increased offspring. The more foundresses present in a nest, the more cells and eggs are produced. Also, the presence of more than one female improves active defense of the nest.|$|E
