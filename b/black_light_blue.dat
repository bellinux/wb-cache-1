5000|$|A revised {{model of}} the Vita was {{released}} in Japan on October 10, 2013, in Europe on February 7, 2014 and in North America on May 6, 2014. The revised model, officially called the PCH-2000 series and {{commonly referred to as}} the PS Vita Slim, is 20% thinner and 15% lighter compared to the original model. While it largely maintains the original's overall structure and layout, the original's OLED screen has been replaced with a lower-cost LCD display. The model also roughly added about an extra hour of battery life. The newer model also comes with 1 GB of internal storage memory, although {{it is not possible to}} use both the internal memory and memory card concurrently. Upon inserting a PS Vita memory card, the system will offer to copy the existing data from the internal memory to the new card.

50|$|The {{national}} flag of Antigua and Barbuda was adopted on 27 February, 1967 {{to mark the}} achievement of self-government. A competition to design the flag was held {{in which more than}} 600 local people entered. The winning design was put forth by nationally acclaimed artist and sculptor Sir Reginald Samuel. The design is a red field with an inverted isosceles triangle based on the top edge of the field pointed toward the bottom edge of the field bearing the horizontal tricolour of <b>black,</b> <b>light</b> <b>blue</b> (half width) and white with the rising sun centred on top of the black band. The rising sun symbolises the dawning of a new era. The colours have different meanings, the black is for the African ancestry of the people, the blue for hope, the red for energy or dynamism of the people. The successive colouring of yellow, blue, and white (from the sun down) also stands for the sun, sea, and sand. The blue also represents the Caribbean Sea, and the V-shape is the symbol of victory. The state ensign, which is used only by the national coast guard, consists of a white field, a red cross, and the state flag in the canton.|$|E

The contestants, from 1986 onwards, all had their own corresponding colour, either red, green, yellow or blue. They wore their own clothes, apart from the Physical Ability round where the contestants wore track suits which were, in early series, red, burgundy, orange, green, <b>black,</b> <b>light</b> <b>blue</b> and dark blue. From 1986 onwards, the tracksuits were red, green, yellow and blue, and varied in design over the series that followed. The track suits changed to black with a coloured stripe from 1990 to 1993. For their own clothes, the contestants either wore a shirt/blouse, tie or a neckscarf of their corresponding colour. The points contestants earned through the game were not referred to as their score, but as their [...] "Krypton Factor", e.g. [...] "The winner, with a Krypton Factor of 46, is the legal secretary from Kent, Mike Berry".

40|$|Traps {{that use}} {{ultraviolet}} light as an attractant for flies {{are widely used}} in urban situations. To determine the differences in trap efficacy from design and lighting, pairs of traps were compared under laboratory conditions. Comparisons were made between traps with open fronts and with traps with restricted open fronts, black light bulbs, and <b>black</b> <b>light</b> <b>blue</b> bulbs, and glue boards with and without z- 9 -tricosene pheromone. In a windowless laboratory, pairs of traps were placed approximately 90 cm above the floor and 3 m apart. Fifty mixed-sex, 3 - to 5 -day-old house flies (Musca domestica) were released and counts of captured flies were made after 1, 4, 24 hrs. Traps with black light bulbs attracted and captured significantly more flies that those with <b>black</b> <b>light</b> <b>blue</b> bulbs. Black light bulbs increased the catch significantly in traps with open fronts but <b>black</b> <b>light</b> <b>blue</b> bulbs did not. Glue boards with pheromone did not influence fly catch in either housing type when <b>black</b> <b>light</b> <b>blue</b> bulbs were used. In traps with closed fronts and black light bulbs, the fly catch was numerically higher with glue boards with pheromone.

40|$|Fenton chemistry, {{which is}} known to play an {{effective}} role in degrading toxic chemicals, is difficult to apply to disinfection in water treatment, since its reaction is effective only at the acidic pH of 3. The presence of oxalate ions and UV-visible light, {{which is known}} as a photoferrioxalate system, allows the Fe(III) to be dissolved at slightly acidic and near-neutral pHs and maintains the catalytic reaction of iron. This study indicates that the main oxidizing species in the photoferrioxalate system responsible for microorganism inactivation is OH radical. Escherichia coli was used as an indicator microorganism. The CT value (OH radical concentration × contact time; used to indicate the effect of the combination of the concentration of the disinfectant and the contact time on inactivation) for a 2 -log inactivation of E. coli was approximately 1. 5 × 10 − 5 mg/liter/min, which is approximately 2, 700 times lower than that of ozone as estimated by the delayed Chick-Watson model. Since the light emitted by the <b>black</b> <b>light</b> <b>blue</b> lamp is similar to sunlight in the specific wavelength range of 300 to 420 nm, the photoferrioxalate system, which can have a dual function, treating water for both organic pollutants and microorganisms simultaneously, shows promise for the treatment of water or wastewater in remote or rural sites. However, the photoferrioxalate disinfection system is slower in inactivating microorganisms than conventional disinfectants are...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to distinguish the effect of photon flux (i. e., photons per unit time reaching a surface) from that of photon energy (i. e., wavelength) of a photon source on the silica-titania composite (STC) -catalyzed degradation of ethanol in the gas phase. Experiments were conducted in a bench-scale annular reactor packed with STC pellets and irradiated with either a UV-A fluorescent <b>black</b> <b>light</b> <b>blue</b> lamp ((gamma) max= 365 nm) at its maximum light intensity or a UV-C germicidal lamp ((gamma) max= 254 nm) at three levels of light intensity. The STC-catalyzed oxidation of ethanol was found to follow zero-order kinetics with respect to CO 2 production, regardless of the photon source. Increased photon flux led to increased EtOH removal, mineralization, and oxidation rate accompanied by lower intermediate concentration in the effluent. The oxidation rate was higher in the reactor irradiated by UV-C than by UV-A (38. 4 vs. 31. 9 nM/s) at the same photon flux, with similar trends for mineralization (53. 9 vs. 43. 4 %) and reaction quantum efficiency (i. e., photonic efficiency, 63. 3 vs. 50. 1 nmol CO 2 (mu) mol/photons).

Photocatalytic discoloration kinetics of Reactive Black 5 (RB 5), a vinylsulfone dye, has been studied spectrophotomet-rically by following the decrease in dye concentration with time at ambient conditions using a flow loop reactor. UV lump, <b>Black</b> <b>Light</b> <b>Blue</b> (BLB) emitting at maximum wavelength of 365 nm and Ahlstrom Research Service paper con-sistent of TiO 2 P 500 coated on non woven paper was used respectively as source of UV light and photocatalyst. At natural pH, the result shows that photolysis of RB 5 and its adsorption {{in the presence of}} photocatalyst was negligible while the photocatalytic oxidation (PCO) permits 30. 8 % of RB 5 degradation. The degradation of dye was studied under a variety of conditions such as volumetric flow rate, initial pH, photocatalyst reuse, and in the presence of electron ac-ceptor such as sodium persulphate ((Na) 2 S 2 O 8). The degradation rates were found to be strongly influenced by all the above parameters. The circulation flow rate of 108 L/h was the best. The rate constant calculated when the initial pH was varied shows that pH 3 was more favorable for RB 5 removal. Peroxydisulphate ions have the strong effect on RB 5 discoloration even in dark without and with photocatalyst. When UV light was used in the presence of photocatalyst, 50 min was enough for quasi-total removal of RB 5 with 282 S...|$|E
