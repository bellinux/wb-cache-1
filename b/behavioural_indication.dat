40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} in a 55 ‐sow, specific pathogen‐free commercial unit, to observe the behavioural adaptation of newly weaned pigs (7 to 10 kg) to air movement in a typical weaner pen. Direct air currents were generated by a fan placed at 4 positions around the pen. Observations were made of activity, lying position, huddling and orientation. Increased activity was observed when the wind was directed on to the preferred lying area of the pigs. The pigs usually moved out of the region of greatest air movement and indirect currents appeared to be more favourable. Wind inhibited huddling in the pigs when it was directed over the lying area but orientation was unaffected. Social factors were important in the choice of lying position. The percentage of pigs huddling gave a <b>behavioural</b> <b>indication</b> of the suitability of the husbandry environment for production and welfare. Copyrigh...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} an {{approach}} to integrate different applications for a virtual human simulation in a complex environment. We present the design of one system and {{the integration of the}} various features: creation and use of information extracted from the environment and crowd management. 1 INTRODUCTION For several years, we have been working on modelling and simulating realistic virtual humans. All simulations were made using environment without semantic or <b>behavioural</b> <b>indication.</b> This project aims at performing simulations of autonomous agents or crowds within complex scenes including some degree of interaction with the environment. This paper presents different aspects of human and object simulation and their integration in an urban environment using information extracted from a virtual city. To make more realistic simulations the environment must integrate some semantic notion about specific areas. This corresponds to natural human analysis using urban basic knowle [...] ...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Picky or fussy {{eating is}} common in early {{childhood}} and associated with a decreased preference {{for a variety of}} foods. The aim of the current study was to experimentally test which sensory food feature is associated with food acceptance, which, in turn is an indication for fussy eating, in young children (between 32 and 48 months). In a repeated-measures-design, three sensory features were manipulated separately (i. e., colour, texture and taste) while keeping the other two features constant. The baseline measurement consisted of a well-liked yoghurt, which was presented before each manipulation variant. The number of spoons that children (N = 32) consumed from each variant were registered as <b>behavioural</b> <b>indication</b> for food acceptance. Another aim was to evaluate how the behavioural measurement of food acceptance would be related to parental reports of their child's fussy eating behaviour and parental feeding styles. In addition, this study explored if children's body-mass index (BMI) was related to the behavioural measurement of food acceptance and parental reports of fussy eating behaviour. RESULTS: The manipulation of food texture caused a significant decrease in intake. Colour and taste manipulations of the yoghurt did not affect children's intake. Parental reports of children's fussy eating behaviour and parental feeding styles were not related to the behavioural observation of food acceptance. The behavioural measurement of food acceptance and parental accounts of fussy eating were not related to children's BMI. CONCLUSION: Food texture but not taste or colour alternations affected food acceptance, at least when consuming variations of a well-liked yoghurt. This knowledge is important for further research on picky-eating interventions. Parental reports of fussy eating did not concur with the behavioural observation of food acceptance. Further research is warranted to test whether these findings generalize to other food types...|$|E
40|$|The main aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} whether an ERP-based memory assessment procedure (van Hooff et al., 1996) could be used to detect memories for items that (1) did not receive a behavioural recognition response and (2) were not intentionally learned. Participants were first required to study a short list of "neutral," semantically unrelated words that were subsequently tested for recognition. Next, participants studied a second, different word list, which again was tested for recognition (learned targets) in a following test. In this second test, the distractors consisted of the words that were studied prior to - and had to be recognized in - the first test (learned nontargets), words that were used as distractors in the first test (repeated nontargets), and words that had not been learned or presented before (new words). Targets and both types of nontargets were presented less frequently than the new words, so essentially this test had an oddball character. Results showed that learned targets as well as learned nontargets elicited a P 300 component that was largely absent for the new words and for the repeated nontargets. These results seem to imply that successful use of the ERP-based memory assessment procedure did not rely on <b>behavioural</b> <b>indications</b> of recognition, but did depend on the level of contemplation during initial study/presentation...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{research}} suggests that despite the seeming inability of patients in vegetative and minimally conscious states to generate consistent behaviour, some might possess covert awareness detectable with functional neuroimaging. These findings motivate further research into the cognitive mechanisms that might support the existence of consciousness in these states of profound neurological dysfunction. One of the key questions in this regard relates to the nature and capabilities of attention in patients, known {{to be related to}} but distinct from consciousness. Previous assays of the electroencephalographic P 300 marker of attention have demonstrated its presence and potential clinical value. Here we analysed data from 21 patients and 8 healthy volunteers collected during an experimental task designed to engender exogenous or endogenous attention, indexed by the P 3 a and P 3 b components, respectively, in response to a pair of word stimuli presented amongst distractors. Remarkably, we found that the early, bottom-up P 3 a and the late, top-down P 3 b could in fact be dissociated in a patient who fitted the behavioural criteria for the vegetative state. In juxtaposition with healthy volunteers, the patient's responses suggested the presence of a relatively high level of attentional abilities despite the absence of any <b>behavioural</b> <b>indications</b> thereof. Furthermore, we found independent evidence of covert command following in the patient, as measured by functional neuroimaging during tennis imagery. Three other minimally conscious patients evidenced non-discriminatory bottom-up orienting, but no top-down engagement of selective attentional control. Our findings present a persuasive case for dissociable attentional processing in behaviourally unresponsive patients, adding {{to our understanding of the}} possible levels and applications of consequent conscious awareness...|$|R
40|$|Aims and objectives.   To {{explore the}} {{assumption}} that people with ID are unable to communicate effectively about pain by examining {{the extent to which}} they were reported as using language and behaviour that was readily understandable to others to communicate pain as distinct from distress. Background.   The healthcare needs of people with an intellectual disability (ID) are frequently overlooked or dealt with inappropriately. One proposed reason is the difficulty that such individuals have in communicating about their pain. Design.   A postal questionnaire-based mixed method design was used. Methods.   Data from carer reports (n = 29) of the ways people with ID supported expressed pain and distress were categorised and analysed using descriptive statistics and thematic content analysis. Results.   Nineteen of the 22 people who used verbal communication were reported to express pain using words that would be understandable to someone else, often accompanied by <b>behavioural</b> <b>indications</b> of the location of the pain. The language and behaviour that were reported as being used to express distress was more idiosyncratic, and there was little overlap between this and the ways in which pain was expressed. Conclusion.   The results provide some challenges to the view that people with ID are necessarily unable to communicate effectively about their pain and support the view that pain and distress can be conceptually distinguished and differentially communicated by some people with ID. Relevance to clinical practice.   The results suggest that many people with ID can be active participants in describing their experience of pain and that nurses should attempt to obtain this information directly from the individual during the diagnostic process. Nurses should be mindful of the distinction between pain and distress and should not respond to signs of distress in this group as being indicative of pain, without carrying out further assessment...|$|R
40|$|The central {{purpose of}} this study was to gain an {{understanding}} of the body image dissatisfaction experiences of a group of young adult men who were engaged in regular recreational weight training activities. Within this, three primary areas of enquiry were investigated through the completion of twelve semi-structured interviews with men aged between eighteen and thirty who were residing in the city of Hamilton, New Zealand. The first area of investigation focused on gaining a broad appreciation of participants’ body image dissatisfaction experiences. While participants’ reports indicated that for the majority, the experience of dissatisfaction did not have a significantly detrimental effect on their well-being, <b>behavioural</b> <b>indications</b> highlighted a tendency for men to downplay the actual impact of these types of experiences. The second area of enquiry focused on investigating participants’ beliefs about specific factors which they thought were influencing their own and others’ body image dissatisfaction experiences. Reports tended to suggest that media, particularly advertising, entertainment and Internet-based media, as well as peer, family and opposite sex influences were most central to the development and maintenance of dissatisfaction experiences. Coupled with these influences, social comparison and internalisation processes also appeared to act as important mediating processes for participants’ body image dissatisfaction experiences. When considered in their entirety this combination of influences lent support to the sociocultural model as a framework for explaining the development and maintenance of body image dissatisfaction among participants. The third and final area of enquiry was aimed at gaining an understanding of the relationship between weight training and participants’ body image dissatisfaction experiences. While results indicated the existence of a positive relationship between regular recreational weight training engagement, body image satisfaction, and other aspects of well-being, engagement also appeared to have an effect in the opposite direction, influencing the quality of body evaluation in a manner which appeared to also increase the likelihood of experiences of body image dissatisfaction among participants...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Suicides incur in {{all public}} transit systems {{which do not}} {{completely}} impede access to tracks. We conducted two studies to determine if we can reliably identify in stations people at risk of suicide in order to intervene in a timely manner. The first study analysed all CCTV recordings of suicide attempters in Montreal underground stations over 2  years to identify behaviours indicating suicide risk. The second study verified the potential of using those behaviours to discriminate attempters from other passengers in real time. Methods First study: Trained observers watched CCTV video recordings of 60 attempters, with 2 – 3 independent observers coding seven easily observable behaviours and five behaviours requiring interpretation (e. g. “strange behaviours,” “anxious behaviour”). Second study: We randomly mixed 63 five-minute CCTV recordings before an attempt with 56 recordings from the same cameras {{at the same time}} of day, and day of week, but when no suicide attempt was to occur. Thirty-three undergraduate students after only 10  min of instructions watched the recordings and indicated if they observed each of 13 behaviours identified in the First Study. Results First study: Fifty (83 %) of attempters had easily observable behaviours potentially indicative of an impending attempt, and 37 (61 %) had two or more of these behaviours. Forty-five (75 %) had at least one behaviours requiring interpretation. Twenty-two witnesses attempted to intervene to stop the attempt, and 75 % of attempters had behaviours indicating possible ambivalence (e. g. waiting for several trains to pass; {{trying to get out of}} the path of the train). Second study: Two behaviours, leaving an object on the platform and pacing back and forth from the yellow line (just before the edge of the platform), could identify 24 % of attempters with no false positives. The other target behaviours were also present in non-attempters. However, having two or more of these behaviours indicated a likelihood of being at risk of attempting suicide. Conclusions We conclude that real time observations of CCTV monitors, automated computer monitoring of CCTV signals, and/or training of drivers and transit personnel on <b>behavioural</b> <b>indications</b> of suicide risk, may identify attempters with few false positives, and potentially save lives...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe report {{two adults}} who {{received}} gabapentin (GBP) and subsequently developed <b>behavioural</b> side effects. <b>Indications</b> for GBP treatment were newly diagnosed epilepsy in one and painful paraesthesiae in the other. Both had no past history of psychiatric or behavioural disorder. Abnormal behaviour consisted of elevated mood, euphoria, and increased energy in both patients, and pressure {{of speech and}} decreased need for sleep in one of them. These symptoms were transient and fully reversible. One patient had to discontinue GBP. Behavioural changes were not related to seizure activity. They should {{be recognized as a}} possible side effect of GBP treatment in adults...|$|R
40|$|Many {{unpalatable}} butterfly species use coloration {{to signal}} their distastefulness to birds, but motion cues {{may also be}} crucial to ward off predatory attacks. In previous research, captive passion-vine butterflies Heliconius mimetic in colour pattern were also mimetic in motion. Here, I investigate whether wing motion changes with the flight demands of different behaviours. If birds select for wing motion as a warning signal, aposematic butterflies should maintain wing motion independently of behavioural context. Members of one mimicry group (Heliconius cydno and Heliconius sapho) beat their wings more slowly and their wing strokes were more asymmetric than their sister-species (Heliconius melpomene and Heliconius erato, respectively), which were members of another mimicry group having a quick and steady wing motion. Within mimicry groups, wing beat frequency declined as its role in generating lift also declined in different behavioural contexts. In contrast, asymmetry of the stroke {{was not associated with}} wing beat frequency or <b>behavioural</b> context—strong <b>indication</b> that birds process and store the Fourier motion energy of butterfly wings. Although direct evidence that birds respond to subtle differences in butterfly wing motion is lacking, birds appear to generalize a motion pattern as much as they encounter members of a mimicry group in different behavioural contexts...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study an animal model to study tinnitus-related changes in brain {{metabolism}} was established. 2 -deoxy-D-[14 C]-glucose (2 -DG) uptake served to screen metabolic activity in the entire mouse brain two hours and two weeks after unilateral noise trauma. Tinnitus perception was evaluated using {{a modified version of}} the acoustic startle paradigm, in which a short gap was embedded in the constant background noise to inhibit the startle amplitude. An arg 3. 1 conditional knockout mouse line was used to evaluate the influence of neuronal plasticity on the generation of tinnitus. Moreover, social interaction was tested to detect signs of emotional stress due to phantom sound perception, which is very common in tinnitus patients. After unilateral noise trauma, auditory brain stem responses (ABR) revealed a permanent threshold shift on the exposed ear. This particularly affected frequencies above the trauma stimulus frequency. Noise exposed animals exhibited a reduction of 2 -DG uptake along the afferent auditory pathway on the exposed side. In contrast, elevated activity was detected in the striatum, the somatosensory cortex, the cingulate gyrus (CG), orbitofrontal cortex, insula cortex, superior colliculus and the cerebellum. 71 % of noise exposed animals demonstrated indications of phantom sound perception via the startle paradigm. Of these, 28 % showed signs of phantom sound perception within a broad frequency range, 24 % in a narrow frequency range below the trauma frequency and 48 % within a narrow frequency range above the trauma frequency. In 19 % of noise exposed animals, tinnitus perception seemed to occur in more than one frequency band. The group of tinnitus perceiving animals showed a reduction in 2 -DG uptake in the contralateral auditory cortex, whereas animals with signs of phantom sound perception in the narrow frequency bands had an elevated uptake in the ipsilateral auditory cortex. Furthermore, activity changes were detected in the contralateral hippocampus, ipsilateral amygdala, cingulate gyrus, striatum, nucleus accumbens, olfactory bulb, colliculus superior and the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN). When comparing noise exposed animals with and without <b>behavioural</b> <b>indications</b> for tinnitus, I observed differences in the ipsilateral striatum, CG, superior colliculus, globus pallidus, the contralateral TRN and cochlear nucleus. Unfortunately, arg 3. 1 knockout mice showed an altered glucose metabolism in the control state. Hence, a discussion of noise trauma-induced activity changes in these knockout animals is not possible. As 82 % of arg 3. 1 knockout mice exhibited behavioural signs for an auditory phantom perception, a reduced prevalence for tinnitus generation in this group could not be detected. In all noise exposed animals, the social interaction test demonstrated no indications of stress caused by the auditory phantom sound perception. The established model allows for the first time the investigation of tinnitus specific activity patterns in the entire brain of awake mice. The observed changes discussed above comprise a distributed network that consists of auditory, limbic and multimodal brain regions. Moreover, the data demonstrate that tinnitus perception might be triggered by alterations in interhemisperic and corticofugal projections. The presented data is in line with recent human imaging studies and supports the hypothesis that a complex distributed network is responsible for the generation of tinnitus...|$|R
40|$|Dementia is an {{increasing}} health concern for old people, their families, and their social and health care providers. A range of health care services is needed for persons with dementia, ranging from home-based services, respite care (e. g. attending a day-care centre), to residential care at a nursing home. An important goal in dementia care is to provide for and ensure a good quality of life. There is a great need for health promoting activities among persons with dementia, and animal-assisted interventions have become a widespread non-pharmacological alternative. Animal-assisted interventions {{have been found to}} have a positive influence on social behaviour, a beneficial effect on agitation and other <b>behavioural</b> disturbances, and <b>indication</b> of significant improvement in depression. However, the literature show mixed results, and the authors of reviews have called for further research. The first and main aim of the research for this thesis was therefore to investigate animal-assisted activity as a health promoting activity for homedwelling persons with dementia attending day-care centres and persons with dementia admitted to nursing home...|$|R

Central to the provision of lay support is the capability of social networks to recognise and respond effectively to young men’s psychological distress and suicide risk. The aim of this qualitative study was to explore young men’s narratives of peer suicide, in order to identify how they interpreted and responded to <b>behavioural</b> changes and <b>indications</b> of distress from their friend before suicide. In-depth qualitative interviews were conducted with 15 Irish males (aged 19 - 30 years) who had experienced the death by suicide of a male friend in the preceding five years.

Through the analysis of the participants’ stories and experiences, we identified several features of young male friendships and social interactions that could be addressed in order to strengthen the support available to young men in crisis. These included: the reluctance of young men to discuss emotional or personal issues within male friendships; the tendency to reveal worries and emotion only within the context of alcohol consumption; the tendency of friends to respond in a dismissive or disapproving way to communication of suicidal thoughts; the difficulty of knowing how to interpret a friend’s inconsistent or ambiguous behaviour prior to suicide; and beliefs about {{the sort of person who}} takes their own life.
