40|$|Abstract [...] -In {{classical}} {{control of}} <b>brushless</b> <b>dc</b> <b>motors,</b> flux distribution is assumed trapezoidal and fed current is controlled rectangular {{to obtain a}} desired constant torque. However, in reality this assumption may not be correct due to non-uniformity of magnetic materials and design tradeoffs. These factors together with current controller limitation, can lead to an undesirable torque- ripple. Hence torque- ripple has been {{the main issue of}} the servo derive systems, in which the speed fluctuation, vibration and acoustic noise should be minimized. This tor que- ripple also deteriorates the precision of the parameters of <b>brushless</b> <b>dc</b> <b>motors.</b> In this proposed work, different techniques are to be carried out to control the torque- ripple of <b>brushless</b> <b>dc</b> <b>motors.</b> Effectiveness and flexibility of the individual techniques of torque-ripple control method will be thoroughly discussed for merits and demerits and finally verified through simulation (PSIM) and experimental results for comparative analysis...|$|R

However, the use of <b>brushless</b> <b>DC</b> <b>motors</b> and rectifying circuit can cause poor power factor and harmonic value. Power factor value reaches 0, 73 while the current THD at 74 %.

5000|$|DC ceiling fans. These fans use a <b>brushless</b> <b>DC</b> <b>motor</b> {{that offer}} much better {{efficiency}} than traditional fans driven with AC motors. They usually are quieter than AC motor fans {{due to the}} fact they are commutated electronically and use permanent magnet rotors. Among many advantages these fans offer some are higher efficiency, lower noise level, less rotor heat, integration of remote control and other convenience technologies etc. The only drawbacks are the high cost and the presence of complex electronics which {{may be more likely to}} fail, making them not ideal for commercial installs containing a large number of fans. However, with the advent of new technologies and better quality control techniques, the latter is becoming less of a concern.|$|E
50|$|Power {{electronics}} also {{feature in}} a wide range of more exotic uses. They are at the heart of all modern electric and hybrid vehicles—where they are used for both motor control and as part of the <b>brushless</b> <b>DC</b> <b>motor.</b> Power electronics are also found in practically all modern petrol-powered vehicles, this is because the power provided by the car's batteries alone is insufficient to provide ignition, air-conditioning, internal lighting, radio and dashboard displays for the life of the car. So the batteries must be recharged while driving using DC power from the engine—a feat that is typically accomplished using power electronics. Whereas conventional technology would be unsuitable for a modern electric car, commutators can and have been used in petrol-powered cars, the switch to alternators in combination with power electronics has occurred because of the improved durability of brushless machinery.|$|E
