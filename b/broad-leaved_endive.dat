5000|$|Escarole, or <b>broad-leaved</b> <b>endive</b> (var latifolia), has broad, {{pale green}} leaves and is less bitter {{than the other}} varieties. Varieties or names include <b>broad-leaved</b> <b>endive,</b> Bavarian endive, Batavian endive, grumolo, scarola, and scarole. It is eaten like other greens, sauteed, chopped into soups and stews, {{or as part of}} a green salad.|$|E

Biofilms were observed on leaves of all species sampled (spinach, lettuce, Chinese cabbage, celery, leeks, basil, parsley, and <b>broad-leaved</b> <b>endive),</b> although the epifluorescent images were clearest when pale green tissue or cuticle pieces were used. With these techniques, biofilms were observed that were about 20 (mu) m in depth and up to 1 mm in length and that contained copious exopolymeric matrices, diverse morphotypes of microorganisms, and debris. The epifluorescence techniques described here {{can be used to}} rapidly determine the abundance and localization of biofilms on leaves. An additional technique was developed to recover individual biofilms or portions of single biofilms from leaves and to disintegrate them for isolation of the culturable microorganisms they contained. Nineteen biofilms from <b>broad-leaved</b> <b>endive,</b> spinach, parsley, and olive leaves were thus isolated and characterized to illustrate the applications of this technique...|$|E
40|$|The {{discovery}} that biofilms are ubiquitous among the epiphytic microflora of leaves has prompted research {{about the impact}} of biofilms on the ecology of epiphytic microorganisms and on the efficiency of strategies to manage these populations for disease control and to ensure food safety. Biofilms are likely to influence the microenvironment and phenotype of the microorganisms they harbor. However, {{it is also important to}} determine whether there are differences in the types of bacteria within biofilms compared to those outside of biofilms so as to better target microorganisms via disease control strategies. <b>Broad-leaved</b> <b>endive</b> (Cichorium endivia var. latifolia) harbors biofilms containing fluorescent pseudomonads. These bacteria can cause considerable post-harvest losses when this plant is used for manufacturing minimally processed salads. To determine whether the population structure of the fluorescent pseudomonads in biofilms is different from that outside of biofilms on the same leaves, bacteria were isolated quantitatively from the biofilm and solitary components of the epiphytic population on leaves of field-grown <b>broad-leaved</b> <b>endive.</b> Population structure was determined in terms of taxonomic identities of the bacteria isolated, in terms of genotypic profiles, and in terms of phenotypic traits related to surface colonization and biofilm formation. The results illustrate that there are no systematic differences in the composition and structure of biofilm and solitary populations of fluorescent pseudomonads, in terms of either genotypic profiles or phenotypic profiles of the strains. However, Gram-positive bacteria tended to occur more frequently within biofilms than outside of biofilms. We suggest that leaf colonization by fluorescent pseudomonads involves a flux of cells between biofilm and solitary states. This would allow bacteria to exploit the advantages of these two types of existence; biofilms would favor resistance to stressful conditions, whereas solitary cells could foster spread of bacteria to newly colonizable sites on leaves as environmental conditions fluctuate...|$|E
40|$|Total, fluorescent, and pectolytic epiphytic {{bacterial}} population sizes were quantified on leaves of different age groups of <b>broad-leaved</b> <b>endive</b> during field cultivation from leaf emergence until harvest. Greater {{bacterial population}} densities (log(inf 10) CFU per square centimeter) were observed on outer leaves than on inner {{leaves of the}} plants throughout the growing season. These differences were statistically significant for total bacterial populations at all sampling times and were often significant for fluorescent and pectolytic bacterial populations. At harvest, a linear gradient of decreasing densities of epiphytic bacteria from outer (older) to inner (younger) leaves of the head was significant. Leaf age influenced the frequency distribution and variability of bacterial population sizes associated with leaves of <b>broad-leaved</b> <b>endive.</b> Total bacterial population sizes were greater at leaf emergence for leaves emerging {{during the second half}} of the cultivation period than for leaves emerging earlier. The size of fluorescent and pectolytic bacterial populations on newly emerged leaves increased throughout the season as plants aged. To assess the importance of plant age on bacterial immigration at leaf emergence, bacterial densities were quantified on leaves emerging simultaneously on plants of different ages. In two of the three experiments, greater bacterial population sizes were observed on leaves emerging on younger plants. This indicates that factors other than an increase in concentration of airborne bacteria can lead to increases in population sizes at leaf emergence as plants age in the field. Results of leaf pruning experiments suggested that adjacent leaves may act as a barrier for immigration of fluorescent bacteria on newly emerged leaves. Survival of an inoculated strain of Pseudomonas fluorescens on newly emerged leaves generally did not vary with the age of plants. However, these effects were not consistent among experiments, suggesting that interactions among micro- and macroenvironmental conditions, physiological condition of leaves, and accessibility of leaves to airborne bacteria are important in controlling epiphytic bacterial population sizes...|$|E
