50|$|Walleye, brook trout, Roanoke bass, {{and blue}} catfish {{are among the}} 210 known species of {{freshwater}} fish. Running brooks with rocky bottoms are often inhabited by a plentiful amounts of crayfish and salamanders. The Chesapeake Bay is the nation's largest and most biologically diverse estuary and is home to many species, including blue crab, clams, oysters, scallops, Chesapeake ray, eel, bay anchovies, American shad, Atlantic croaker, Atlantic sturgeon, black drum, <b>black</b> <b>seabass,</b> blue fish, hickory shad, longnose gar, red drum, spot, and rockfish (also known as striped bass).|$|E
50|$|Monitor National Marine Sanctuary is {{the site}} of the wreck of the USS Monitor, {{one of the most famous}} shipwrecks in U.S. history. It was {{designated}} as the country's first national marine sanctuary on January 30, 1975, and is one of only two of the thirteen national marine sanctuaries created to protect a cultural resource rather than a natural resource. The sanctuary comprises a column of water 1 nmi km in diameter extending from the ocean’s surface to the seabed around the wreck of the Civil War ironclad, which lies 16 nmi km south-southeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. Average water depth in the sanctuary is 230 ft. Since its sinking in 1862, the Monitor has become an artificial reef attracting numerous fish species, including amberjack, <b>black</b> <b>seabass,</b> oyster toadfish and great barracuda.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} marine {{fish in the}} Sound include porgy, butterfish, winter flounder, summer flounder, {{windowpane}} flounder, fourspot flounder, northern and striped sea robin, little skate, menhaden, Atlantic silversides, <b>black</b> <b>seabass,</b> blackfish (tautog), cunner, bluefish, and smooth dogfish. Frequently Atlantic bonito and false albacore, both members of the tuna family, enter the sound and can be caught by anglers from small boats and shore. Many species have declined rapidly since 1975 due to over fishing. Winter flounder may not be currently present except for rare, small local populations. Tautog and summer flounder are also less numerous. Anadromous fishes include striped bass, white perch, alewives, blueback herring, and American and hickory shad. Although several shark species likely infrequently wander {{in and out of}} the Sound, e.g. blue shark, mako shark, hammerhead shark & thresher shark, there are only four species of sharks which are regularly found in the area. These are the sand tiger shark, the sandbar shark, the spiny dogfish and the smooth dogfish.|$|E
40|$|Thermal {{properties}} of ten different seafood were measured in this research. They included bluefish (Pomatomus saltatrix), croaker (Micropogonias undulatus), spanish mackerel (Scomberomorus maculatus), pink salmon (Oncorhynhus gorbuscha), <b>black</b> <b>seabass</b> (Atractoscion nobilis), spot (Leiostomus xanthurus), shrimp(Pandalus borealis), tilapia (Tilapia aurea), grey sea trout(Cynoscion regalis), and {{yellow fin tuna}} (Thunnus albacares) (Wheaton, et al. 1985). Thermal properties measured were thermal conductivity, thermal diffusivity, and specific heat from 5 to 30 °C. Enthalpy was measured from- 40 to 30 °C. Moisture and fat content were measured. Thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity were measured by a rapid transient technique using a bead thermistor probe. Specific heat and enthalpy were measured using a differential scanning calorimeter. Moisture content and fat content were measured by the AOAC specified oven dry method and ether extraction method, respectively. The measured thermal properties agreed well with the scarcely available literature values. They were then statistically correlated with moisture and fat content. Based on statistical analysis, mathematical models relating thermal properties and composition were proposed and compared with the models available in the literature. Models for thermal conductivity and specific heat wer...|$|E
40|$|The {{contents}} of pellets and boli {{collected from the}} New York Harbor population of Double-crested cormorants, Phalacrocorax auritus, were analyzed for species composition to investigate possible biases associated with use of cormorant pellets for diet studies. During the breeding and chick-rearing seasons, boli and pellet samples were collected from three island colonies, Hoffman, Swinburne and South Brother. Comparison between the two largest colonies, Swinburne and South Brother, generated a Schoener Index value of 0. 337, indicating a medium level of dietary overlap. The most common species found in the boli were <b>black</b> <b>seabass,</b> Centropristis striata (14. 4 %), and scup, Stenotomus chrysops, (12. 9 %). Neither of two local species with conservation concerns (striped bass, Morone saxatilis, and winter flounder Pseudopleuronectes americanus) made up {{a significant portion of}} the diet. The samples were also analyzed to examine a possible bias in pellet production associated with the spininess of prey species. Ninety-five percent of species found in pellets were spiny compared to 63 % in the boli. This and other evidence suggest that spininess of prey species is a factor affecting thei...|$|E
