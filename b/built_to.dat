5000|$|Feick {{had begun}} doing {{construction}} work for Oberlin College while {{in partnership with}} brother Adam. Oberlin remained one of Feick's most significant clients for more than 25 years. By 1912, Feick maintained offices in both Sandusky and Oberlin. [...] In addition to the works constructed in partnership with brother Adam, Feick's further work at Oberlin College includes: Severance Chemical Laboratory, <b>built</b> from 1899 <b>to</b> 1901 {{at a cost of}} $75,000; Warner Gymnasium, <b>built</b> from 1900 <b>to</b> 1901; Finney Memorial Chappel, <b>built</b> from 1907 <b>to</b> 1908 at a cost of $135,000; the college's Carnegie Library, <b>built</b> from 1907 <b>to</b> 1908 at a cost of $155,600; Rice Memorial Hall, <b>built</b> from 1909 <b>to</b> 1910 at a cost of $110,000; the Men's Building, <b>built</b> from 1909 <b>to</b> 1911 at a cost of $460,000; Keep Cottage, <b>built</b> from 1911 <b>to</b> 1913 at a cost of $45,500; and the Jacob Dolson Cox Administration Building, <b>built</b> from 1913 <b>to</b> 1915.|$|R
50|$|As {{they become}} available, all fives and sixes are {{placed at the}} {{foundations}} above the queens. The fives are <b>built</b> down <b>to</b> Aces, then to Kings, while the sixes are <b>built</b> up <b>to</b> Jacks, all regardless of suit.|$|R
5|$|Served by steam {{locomotives}} {{from opening}} {{until the late}} 1950s, passenger services were then taken over by a fleet of diesel-electric multiple units <b>built</b> <b>to</b> the line's loading gauge. Diesel locomotives handled freight, also <b>built</b> <b>to</b> fit the loading gauge. The diesel-electric multiple units served on the line until 1986, when the line was electrified and the most severely affected tunnels were reduced from double track to single.|$|E
5|$|The firebed (grate) {{air inlet}} dampers {{had not been}} <b>built</b> <b>to</b> the drawings; they were too small, {{resulting}} in poor air supply and inefficient combustion.|$|E
5|$|The {{locks on}} the Bow Back Rivers are not <b>built</b> <b>to</b> a single standard, and sizes vary.|$|E
50|$|The {{object of}} the game is to free one Ace and one King of each suit and build each of them by suit; the Aces are <b>built</b> up <b>to</b> Kings while the Kings are <b>built</b> down <b>to</b> Aces.|$|R

5|$|The {{provision}} at Van Wyck Boulevard for {{a future}} line would be completed, and a new two-track line would be <b>built</b> <b>to</b> Rockaway Boulevard.|$|E
5|$|The {{town was}} rebuilt with a {{combination}} of state and private funding. Many new buildings were erected quickly and were not initially <b>built</b> <b>to</b> the original standards.|$|E
5|$|A dam {{was built}} across the Cefni river north of Llangefni {{in the late}} 1940s to {{increase}} the water supply available to the island. The new reservoir, Llyn Cefni, crossed the railway's trackbed, and a bridge was <b>built</b> <b>to</b> support it. A second reservoir, Llyn Alaw, was formed adjacent to the railway north of Llanerchymedd in the 1960s, but did {{not interfere with the}} line's alignment.|$|E

5|$|A racing {{version was}} {{introduced}} at the 1993 Autosport International motor show; given the model name XJ220-C, it was <b>built</b> <b>to</b> compete in FISA GT racing. The XJ220-C driven by Win Percy won its first race, {{a round of}} the BRDC National Sports GT Challenge at Silverstone.|$|E
5|$|A {{school was}} built in Vietnam in memory of Pryce. His colleagues raised enough money to have the school <b>built</b> <b>to</b> leave a lasting legacy in his honour. The primary school opened in 2007. Its cost was met by the Hong Kong office of Pryce's employer, Linklaters.|$|E
50|$|Before {{the game}} starts, all fives and sixes are {{separated}} from the shuffled decks and placed on the table. These sixteen cards are the foundations; the fives are <b>built</b> down <b>to</b> aces, then kings, while the sixes are <b>built</b> up <b>to</b> queens, all by suit.|$|R
50|$|The game is won {{when all}} cards {{end up in}} the foundations. It {{actually}} does not matter where the ace and king foundations of each suit would meet and how many cards the ace and king foundations of each suit will have. At the end of one game for example, the K♠ is the only one on its foundation while the rest of spade cards are built on the A♠; the A♣ remains unbuilt because all club cards are built on the K♣; the A♥ is <b>built</b> up <b>to</b> 4♥ while the K♥ is <b>built</b> down <b>to</b> 5♥; and the A♦ is <b>built</b> up <b>to</b> 8♦ while the K♦ is <b>built</b> down <b>to</b> 9♦. In fact, the ace and king foundation of a suit can meet anywhere.|$|R

5|$|A {{section of}} Ringway 1 {{known as the}} East Cross Route was <b>built</b> <b>to</b> {{motorway}} standards in the late 1960s and early 1970s and designated as the A102(M). A section of the M11 connecting Ringway 2 (now part of the North Circular Road) and Eastern Avenue to Harlow was completed in the late 1970s, opening to traffic in 1977.|$|E
5|$|A spur {{was built}} near Rhosgoch to {{facilitate}} the building of an oil tank farm in the 1970s. This was <b>built</b> <b>to</b> receive oil from tankers moored offshore in the deep waters off Amlwch, before it was pumped to the Stanlow Refinery in Cheshire. The site was decommissioned after a short life, but the short spur remains.|$|E
5|$|A trio {{of small}} Early Classic temples (Temples 29 to 31) stand upon a common {{platform}} {{at the east}} end of the terrace, facing west. It is likely that the platform was purposely <b>built</b> <b>to</b> support the three temples that were built more-or-less simultaneously. Neither the platform nor the temples have been investigated; it is therefore possible that an early version of the central temple (Temple 30) was built first, then decommissioned with the platform being <b>built</b> <b>to</b> cover the early version, followed by {{the construction of a new}} version plus the two additional flanking temples.|$|E
25|$|An {{adjacency}} {{system allows}} certain structures {{to benefit from}} being <b>built</b> directly adjacent <b>to</b> others. Energy-consuming structures will use less energy when <b>built</b> adjacent <b>to</b> power generators and power generators will produce more energy when <b>built</b> adjacent <b>to</b> power storage structures. The same applies to their mass-producing equivalents. Likewise, factories will consume less energy and mass when <b>built</b> adjacent <b>to</b> power generators and mass fabricators/extractors, respectively. However, by placing structures in close proximity, they become more vulnerable to collateral damage if an adjacent structure is destroyed. Furthermore, most resource generation structures can cause chain reactions when destroyed (especially Tier III structures, which produce large amounts of resources but often have large detonations that can wipe out a nearby army).|$|R

5|$|According {{to transit}} {{advocate}} Steve Munro, the SSE will be <b>built</b> <b>to</b> use only automatic train control. This would preclude {{the operation of}} T1 subway cars on the extension {{as it would be}} too expensive to convert T1 cars to ATC.|$|E
5|$|After this, drivers {{refused to}} take no. 224 across the second Tay Bridge (which was <b>built</b> <b>to</b> a new design and opened in 1887). However, on the 29th anniversary of the disaster, 28 December 1908, no. 224 was used on the Sunday evening mail to Dundee via the Tay Bridge.|$|E
5|$|All of the castellations {{around and}} near the bridge were <b>built</b> <b>to</b> protect it, {{including}} Cromwell's Castle, The Salt Battery (Fort Eliza), Fort Falkland and the Martello Tower. However, the guns mounted on these forts {{could be used to}} destroy the bridge if necessary, as well as to bombard attacking forces on the river.|$|E
