It {{produces}} {{a range of}} turntables based on the Pink Triangle philosophy of lightweight, rigid structures with DC motors. A notable innovation common {{to most of the}} range is the symmetrical arrangement of motor <b>pulley</b> and two <b>idler</b> <b>pulleys</b> around the subplatter, which eliminates the unbalanced side-load of the <b>belt</b> <b>tension</b> on the platter. The Funk Firm modifications, ironically, became best known for their improvements to the Linn Sondek LP12, Pink Triangle's largest competitor.|$|R
5000|$|This {{ability to}} bend the belt at the designer's whim allows it to take a complex or [...] "serpentine" [...] path. This can assist {{the design of a}} compact engine layout, where the {{accessories}} are mounted more closely to the engine block and without the need to provide movable tensioning adjustments.

40|$|This thesis {{documents}} {{my personal}} {{contribution to the}} development of a hydraulic-based actuation system for a solar trough collector. The goal of this project was to design the actuation system using hydraulic actuators for a four meter solar collector prototype in Pittsfield, New Hampshire. After considering several hydraulic system architectures and conducting in-depth analysis into two of them, the <b>idler</b> <b>pulley</b> scheme was chosen. This mechanism uses a double rod end hydraulic actuator connected to wire rope wrapped around a capstan drum and an <b>idler</b> <b>pulley.</b> The model was optimized for mechanical performance, and it is expected to be a more cost effective option than the existing actuation system in New Hampshire once the controls equipment required to actuate the hydraulic cylinders for the new design is specified. by Juan Felipe Carrillo.

50|$|A further {{advantage}} of the polygroove belt that makes them popular {{is that they can}} run over pulleys on the ungrooved back of the belt. Though this is sometimes done with V-belts with a single <b>idler</b> <b>pulley</b> for <b>tensioning,</b> a polygroove <b>belt</b> may be wrapped around a pulley on its back tightly enough to change its direction, or even to provide a light driving force.|$|R

As shown in Fig.  7, the motor is fixed to {{the back side of the}} leg base section, and the timing belt is connected to the output axis via an opening provided in the leg base.|$|R

50|$|Another method uses an {{eccentric}} mechanism {{either in the}} bottom bracket or in the rear hub. If neither of these are an option, when working with an existing frame not originally designed for single-speed use for example, some kind of <b>idler</b> <b>pulley,</b> such as the Surly Singleatoror simply a short cage rear derailleur {{can be used to}} take up chain slack. As well, finetuning the combination of chainring, cog, and chain length may suffice until the chain develops significant wear.|$|R
50|$|Power {{transmission}} {{is a function}} of <b>belt</b> <b>tension.</b> However, also increasing with tension is stress (load) on the belt and bearings. The ideal belt is that of the lowest tension that does not slip in high loads. <b>Belt</b> <b>tensions</b> should also be adjusted to belt type, size, speed, and pulley diameters. <b>Belt</b> <b>tension</b> is determined by measuring the force to deflect the belt a given distance per inch of pulley. Timing belts need only adequate tension to keep the belt in contact with the pulley.|$|R

To reproduce very small forces and moments, the mechanism has low friction, inertia and mass, is statically balanced, and has a simple mass matrix.

50|$|In the mid 19th century, British millwrights {{discovered}} that multi-grooved pulleys connected by ropes outperformed flat pulleys connected by leather belts. Wire ropes were occasionally used, but cotton, hemp, manila {{hemp and flax}} rope saw the widest use. Typically, the rope connecting two pulleys with multiple V-grooves was spliced into a single loop that traveled along a helical path before being returned to its starting position by an <b>idler</b> <b>pulley</b> that also served to maintain the tension on the rope. Sometimes, a single rope was used to transfer power from one multiple-groove drive pulley to several single- or multiple-groove driven pulleys in this way.|$|R

50|$|Round belts are a {{circular}} cross section belt designed {{to run in}} a pulley with a 60 degree V-groove. Round grooves are only suitable for <b>idler</b> <b>pulleys</b> that guide the belt, or when (soft) O-ring type belts are used. The V-groove transmits torque through a wedging action, thus increasing friction. Nevertheless, round belts are for use in relatively low torque situations only and may be purchased in various lengths or cut to length and joined, either by a staple, a metallic connector (in the case of hollow plastic), gluing or welding (in the case of polyurethane). Early sewing machines utilized a leather belt, joined either by a metal staple or glued, to great effect.|$|R

50|$|A {{conveyor}} belt is the carrying medium of a belt conveyor system (often shortened to belt conveyor). A belt conveyor system {{is one of}} many types of conveyor systems. A belt conveyor system consists of two or more pulleys (sometimes referred to as drums), with an endless loop of carrying medium—the {{conveyor belt}}—that rotates about them. One or both of the pulleys are powered, moving the belt and the material on the belt forward. The powered pulley is called the drive pulley while the unpowered pulley is called the <b>idler</b> <b>pulley.</b> There are two main industrial classes of belt conveyors; Those in general material handling such as those moving boxes along inside a factory and bulk material handling such as those used to transport large volumes of resources and agricultural materials, such as grain, salt, coal, ore, sand, overburden and more.|$|R
40|$|Mechanical {{tensioners}} {{are widely}} used in belt drive systems of automotive engines. They act to maintain a minimum tension in the slack span and to decrease transverse belt vibrations. They are composed of an <b>idler</b> <b>pulley,</b> an arm lever and a torsional springThe paper deals with the modeling of the dynamic behaviour of a tensioner. First an experimental investigation permits the characterisation of the tensioner: it is subjected to a force-deflection test carried out using a specific experimental set-up equipped with an electrodynamic shaker. The hysteretic loops are measured for several deflection amplitudes and forcing frequencies. Then, the experimental characterization permits identifying the parameters required by the original hysteretic model, and classical models like the Dahl’s model.

5000|$|Active {{seat-belt}} buckle with Pre-Safe {{function for}} rear occupants: the active seat-belt buckle is fully integrated in the vehicle's PRE-SAFE® system. Whenever PRE-SAFE® becomes active in critical driving situations {{or when the}} system detects the vehicle approaching other objects at a critical speed, reversible <b>belt</b> <b>tensioning</b> is also performed in the rear via the active seat-belt buckle function. The restraint system and the passengers are thus better prepared for a possible accident system. In contrast to its extended position to facilitate fastening of the seat belt, the belt buckle is retracted by approx. 40 millimetres instead. This reversible function increases the <b>belt</b> <b>tensioning</b> on the occupant by up to 80 millimetres. In addition, the belt buckle branches off at a lower point at the occupant's hip. This {{reduces the risk of}} the pelvis submarining under the belt. Securing the occupants more effectively in this way can reduce the strain to which they are exposed {{in the event of an}} accident. The active seat-belt buckle complements the pyrotechnic <b>belt</b> <b>tensioning</b> which has featured as standard in Mercedes-Benz vehicles for many years now, and is triggered in the event of an actual impact.|$|R
50|$|All of the 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engines have a {{timing belt}} made of rubber and cord. This belt must be {{replaced}} at 105,000 mi. These engines are interference engines, meaning that if the timing belt breaks or stretches, the pistons will hit the valves, resulting in an engine teardown, and a likely rebuild. Also, if this belt is replaced around 105,000 miles, {{it is a good}} idea to change the water pump, thermostat, belt tensioner and all the <b>idler</b> <b>pulleys</b> for this belt. The water pump and thermostat are behind this belt.In Australia for the Series II (MY06) cars, Subaru changed the recommended service interval for the timing belt replacement from 100,000 kilometers to 125,000 kilometers.The 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engine in the first-generation Foresters featured head gaskets which were prone to premature failure.

40|$|Abstract Background Monitoring of the {{electrocardiogram}} (ECG) in premature {{infants with}} conventional adhesive-backed electrodes can harm their sensitive skin. Use of an electrode belt prevents skin irritation, {{but the effect}} of belt pressure on respiratory function is unknown. A strain gauge sensor is described which measures applied <b>belt</b> <b>tension.</b> Method The device frame was comprised of an aluminum housing and slide to minimize the device weight. Velcro tabs connected housing and slide to opposite tabs located at the electrode belt ends. The slide was connected to a leaf spring, to which were bonded two piezoresistive transducers in a half-bridge circuit configuration. The device was tested for linearity and calibrated. The effect on infant respiratory function of constant <b>belt</b> <b>tension</b> in the normal range (30 g– 90 g) was determined. Results The mechanical response to a step input was second order (f n = 401 Hz, ζ = 0. 08). The relationship between applied tension and output voltage was linear in the range 25 – 225 gm of applied tension (r 2 = 0. 99). Measured device sensitivity was 2. 18 mV/gm tension using a 5 V bridge excitation voltage. When <b>belt</b> <b>tension</b> was increased in the normal range from 30 gm to 90 gm, {{there was no significant}} change in heart rate and most respiratory functions during monitoring. At an intermediate level of tension of 50 gm, pulmonary resistance and work of breathing significantly decreased. Conclusion The mechanical and electrical design of a device for monitoring electrocardiogram electrode <b>belt</b> <b>tension</b> is described. Within the typical range of application tension, cardiovascular and respiratory function are not substantially negatively affected by electrode belt force. </p...|$|R
50|$|A {{belt drive}} for a bicycle was {{patented}} in the United States on April 8, 1890 by Charles D. Rice, Patent # 425,390. No {{evidence has been}} found that it was ever used, but some motorcycles used leather belts in the early 1900s. The Bridgestone Picnica belt-drive bicycle was introduced in the early 1980s. It used a tooth-belt drive like auto timing belts and Harley-Davidson drive belts, along with a novel two-part chainring that increased <b>belt</b> <b>tension</b> with increasing load. The Picnica was a folding bicycle, and part of the appeal of the belt drive was cleanliness. The Picnica was a small-wheel bicycle, so <b>belt</b> <b>tension</b> may have been less than on a bicycle with standard-size wheels. It was apparently successful, but was offered mainly in Japan.|$|R
