5|$|With {{the effects}} of the late-2000s {{recession}} reducing breakfast traffic to the stores, Burger King announced that it was making the first wholesale changes to its breakfast line-up in many years. In early 2010, Burger King tested a new group of breakfast products under its new BK Brunch product line; a reintroduced English muffin sandwich, a sandwich featuring ciabatta bread, a pair of breakfast bowls, and a non-alcoholic mimosa. In September, a slightly modified variation of the menu was taken national during one of the largest menu expansions in the company's history. Chief Marketing Officer Mike Kappitt said breakfast produced 12 percent of the company's income, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> half of what McDonald's made. Part of the expansion was a major advertising campaign that encouraged people to change their minds about skipping breakfast at a time of high unemployment. 3G Capital has continued the expansion of the breakfast program with the introduction of Quaker Oats Company oatmeal to its menu in late 2011. Oatmeal {{has been shown to be}} a popular addition to breakfast menus industry-wide due to its low cost, ease in preparation and perception as a healthy, whole-grain option. Analysts from industry analytic firm Technomic stated that it was a good move for Burger King to add a winning product to its menu, but that it should have tried to be more creative by adding other, similar products such as grits.|$|E

25|$|The 2008–09 season saw the Oilers {{finish with}} a record of 38–35–9, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> good enough for 11th in the West. One bright spot during the season, however, was Oilers goaltender Dwayne Roloson, as he became the oldest goalie to play 60 NHL games in one season. After the season, the Oilers fired Head Coach Craig MacTavish and hired Pat Quinn as his replacement.|$|E

25|$|Federal marshals {{are most}} {{famous for their}} law {{enforcement}} work, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> a minor part of their workload. The largest {{part of the business}} was paper work—serving writs (e.g., subpoenas, summonses, warrants), and other processes issued by the courts, making arrests and handling all federal prisoners. They also disbursed funds as ordered by the courts. Marshals paid the fees and expenses of the court clerks, U.S. Attorneys, jurors, and witnesses. They rented the courtrooms and jail space, and hired the bailiffs, criers, and janitors. They made sure the prisoners were present, the jurors were available, and that the witnesses were on time.|$|E
25|$|Worcestershire's fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar had a {{field day}} despite serving up no balls on the first day at Northampton, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> the first day, and Northamptonshire came back to win the game. The match had started well enough for the hosts Northamptonshire, but a menacing spell from the Pakistani fast bowler reduced them from 150 for 2 to 173 for 8 - Matt Mason helping out with two wickets as well. Shoaib {{finished}} with six for 47, including twenty runs conceded due to no-balls - while Monty Panesar and Jason Brown rescued the hosts to 299 with a last-wicket stand of 62. Young wicket-keeper Steve Davies then made a career-best 95 in his sixth first-class game, which helped lift Worcestershire to 381, a lead of 82.|$|E
25|$|After working {{briefly in}} {{commercial}} aviation, Mantz went to Hollywood, {{attracted by the}} {{large sums of money}} movie stunt pilots were making at the time. A main requirement was Associated Motion Picture Pilots (AMPP) membership <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> gained after employment in the industry. In an effort to gain notoriety, on July 6, 1930 Mantz set a record in flying 46 consecutive outside loops {{as a part of the}} dedication ceremonies of the San Mateo airport. Although he gained recognition as an accomplished pilot, without the AMPP card, he still could not work in Hollywood. However, in 1931, Mantz performed the climactic stunt in The Galloping Ghost which required him to fly down a canyon and just miss a prominent sycamore. Misjudging his approach, Mantz crashed into the tree but the film crew got their shot and he got his AMPP card.|$|E

25|$|Despite all {{the foul}} weather facing the ABA, Mennenga, who {{was said to}} be an eternal optimist, hung on. There was one {{instance}} that was probably responsible for him relinquishing his position and BMX the sport he had help nurture, all together. On January 27, 1985, at the GT Supernationals in Pico Rivera, California, a disgruntled woman hurled a cup of coffee into the face of Mennenga. In all his years involved in BMX he had never been attacked physically, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> the beginning of his humiliation. After ABA security had to physically remove the spectator from the facility, she filed a false police report that Mennenga assaulted her. The Pico Rivera police came down to the track and arrested Mennenga during the event. The true story eventually came up and the charges were dropped and Mennenga released, but very likely the experience forever soured him on the sport he once loved.|$|E

40|$|International audienceQuasi-periodic noise due {{to various}} reasons often corrupts strain maps {{obtained}} with full-field measuring systems. The {{aim of this}} didactic paper is to show how to remove this noise by changing some Fourier coefficients involved in the two-dimensional (2 D) Fourier transform of these strain maps. The basics of the 2 D Fourier transform of images, which is a common tool in image processing <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> scarcely employed in the experimental mechanics community, are first briefly recalled. Several procedures employed for removing undesirable frequencies in strain maps are then discussed. Three different examples illustrate the benefit of this approach...|$|R
2500|$|As the car {{took over}} American life after World War II, the downtown, which already was facing {{problems}} {{due to a}} drop in expendable income, was largely vacated as business moved to suburban shopping malls. The theatres and department stores left, and much smaller enterprises moved in if anything. Many buildings were torn down for parking lots, and many others burned down, and were not replaced. Others had their top floors removed to reduce tax bills and many facades were [...] "modernized" [...] destroying the Victorian character of the downtown. Road widening and other improvements destroyed a row of business next to city hall, {{as well as the}} area that has become the Lord Overpass. The construction of the Lowell Connector around 1960 was surprisingly unintrusive for an urban interstate, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> because plans to extend it to East Merrimack Street by way of Back Central and the Concord Riverfront were cancelled. Talk began on filling in the canals to make more real estate.|$|E
2500|$|Both Kiem and Hong {{claimed the}} plan {{had been to}} mortar Nui Dat to draw a {{reaction}} force into an ambush, not to attack the base. They confirmed the dual military and political aim, emphasising the disruption caused by 1 ATF lodging at Nui Dat and the intention to affect Australian public opinion. The forced evacuation of Long Tan and Long Phuoc had curtailed the Viet Cong who regarded it as a liberated area, and it {{was chosen as the}} ambush site to demonstrate to the local population that they were still able to operate despite the Australian presence. Hong explained the ambush was sprung within range of the artillery at Nui Dat because they correctly assumed no reaction force would move outside the cover it provided, and instead planned on rapidly closing with and destroying it before artillery or air support could be brought in. They planned to occupy prepared positions in the rubber plantation and destroy whatever force was sent to locate the mortars following the attack on Nui Dat. A stop force had been placed to the east, while another was to the south to hold the Australians in place, reasoning that the thick undergrowth to the north would force them between the two. D445 Battalion was then to close the rear of the ambush, attacking from the north-west. A larger ambush would then have been staged outside artillery range along the withdrawal route subsequently used by the 275th Regiment. Meanwhile, the 274th Regiment was positioned north of Binh Ba astride Route 2 to ambush US forces should they try to relieve 1 ATF. Hong later asked: [...] "How can you claim a victory when you allowed yourselves to walk into a trap that we had set? Admittedly we did not finish the job, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> because time beat us and your reinforcements arrived. I mean you did not even attempt to follow us up. How can you claim a significant victory from that sort of behaviour?" ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{looks at}} the {{covariance}} structure of international property share returns. Portfolio models, which are used to generate efficient international asset allocations, require estimates of a covariance structure of asset returns as input. Usually, the realized structure {{is used as a}} proxy, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> valid if this structure is stable. We test for this stability. We find covariances of international property share returns to be unstable, while correlations are stable between some time-periods, and unstable between others. The results cast some doubts on the use of standard portfolio models for the allocation of international real estate portfolios. ...|$|R

40|$|System Certification is a {{regulatory}} concept which {{is intended to}} expand the scope of radioactive material transport regulations by allowing alternative means for proving compliance with the requisite standards of safety set out in transport regulations. In practice it may allow more stringent requirements in {{one aspect of the}} regulations to be substituted for less stringent application in other areas so long as the safety standard provided by regulation is preserved. The concept is widely perceived as the imposition of operational controls in exchange for relaxation of packaging standards, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> one possibility in the spectrum of potential actions under a System Certification provision in IAEA or national regulations...|$|R
2500|$|Nuclear {{reprocessing}} {{technology was}} developed to chemically separate and recover fissionable plutonium from spent nuclear fuel. [...] Originally, reprocessing was used solely to extract plutonium for producing nuclear weapons. With commercialization of nuclear power, the reprocessed plutonium was recycled back into MOX nuclear fuel for thermal reactors. The reprocessed uranium, {{also known as the}} spent fuel material, can in principle also be re-used as fuel, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> economical when uranium supply is low and prices are high. A breeder reactor is not restricted to using recycled plutonium and uranium. It can employ all the actinides, closing the nuclear fuel cycle and potentially multiplying the energy extracted from natural uranium by about 60 times.|$|R
30|$|And secondly, {{uniqueness}} in {{this sense}} should not be absolutized. Even if the Mona Lisa is unrepeatable, just because it was painted by a great artist who died long ago, it does not represent a value <b>that</b> cannot <b>be</b> compared to anything else 31. It is valuable partly because it was painted by Leonardo, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> part of its worth. We make comparions between ‘unique’ things routinely and express the result, among other ways, in our willingness to buy them at a given price, or to sacrifice other valuable things in their favor. There are many outstanding painters, for instance, whose works are in one sense incomparable (uniqueness), but in another sense quite comparable (and expressible in terms of prices).|$|R

30|$|The model we {{described}} above provides excellent performance, yet its main advantage {{is also a}} weakness, and this forms the underlying idea of this paper. It is because acoustic events have specific spectro-temporal shapes <b>that</b> DNNs <b>are</b> capable of characterization and classification with significant levels of robustness. However, these spectro-temporal shapes <b>are</b> global, meaning <b>that</b> the DNN learns to model entire spectrogram patches. <b>That</b> <b>is,</b> the input layer learns weights that describe complete spectrogram patches. In a way, we can say <b>that</b> DNNs <b>are</b> able to learn a “global” characterization of an acoustic event. <b>But</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> {{one side of the}} acoustic scene. While sounds can be defined globally, a more abstract taxonomy can also be defined resulting in properties such as stationarity and transiency, i.e., a “local” characterization.|$|R
