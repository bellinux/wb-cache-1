50|$|It is {{difficult}} to determine the antiquity of <b>brass</b> <b>casting</b> among the Dan, {{but it is clear that}} the practice began at least in the early 19th century if not much earlier. Some scholars believe that the We people to the East may have introduced the practice to the Dan. <b>Brass</b> <b>casting</b> was a practice of Dan blacksmiths. In Dan communities, the blacksmith was always awarded a high status because he was responsible for agricultural tools and weapons. Brass-casting took place at night to protect the object from onlookers. Brass-casters created brass objects using the cire-perdue, or lost wax method.|$|E

50|$|The statue is an {{over-sized}} <b>brass</b> <b>cast</b> of King Kamehameha I, {{the ruler}} credited with unifying the Hawaiian Islands {{in the early}} nineteenth century and establishing the Kingdom of Hawaii in 1810. The surface is two-toned, finished with a dark brown chemical patina with gilded (See gilding) garments. Erected in 1883, it was commissioned as a replacement for Kamehameha the Great (original cast), which had been commissioned to celebrate the centennial of Captain James Cook’s arrival to the Hawaiian Islands. It was placed in front of the Aliiōlani Hale government building in Honolulu, the spot intended for the original cast, and remains there to this day.|$|R
50|$|The {{origins of}} <b>brass</b> <b>casting</b> in Benin are debated. One popular story credits Oba Oguola (enthroned c. 1280) with sending for a master brass caster from Ile Ife, {{the capital city}} of the ancient Ife Kingdom to the northwest, and with later {{establishing}} a royal brass-casting guild. Others suggest <b>brass</b> <b>casting</b> developed independently in Benin and may have mutually benefited from exchange with Ile Ife. Casters in both regions used the lost wax method, in which a precisely detailed wax model is formed over a clay core. When the model is complete, clay is carefully applied over the wax. It is then heated, melting the wax, which exits from a narrow channel. Next, molten metal is poured into the mold. Once cool, the hardened clay is chipped away, leaving behind an image now cast in bronze.|$|E

Originally commissioned to celebrate the centennial of Captain Cook’s arrival to the Hawaiian Islands and to stand in front of the Aliʻiōlani Hale government building in Honolulu, extenuating circumstances during its delivery to Hawaiii delayed its arrival, and resulted in its being placed instead in Kapaau, near Kamehameha I’s birthplace.|$|E
