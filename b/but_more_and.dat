Louis I's Privilegium pro Slavis ("Privilege for the Slavs") from 1381 was the first indication of official bilingualism in a town. It ensured that the Slovaks in Zsolna (present-day Žilina, Slovakia) enjoy the same privileges as the town's German burghers.|$|E

From Central India, Nicotine, an Indore based band, is widely credited of being the pioneer of Metal music in the region.In the recent years the New Wave of Indian Extreme Metal is growing its roots with bands like Brazen Molok, being the flag bearer of this new wave.|$|E

6000|$|She read everything--from the lacy sentimentalism of Myrtle Read to Samuel Butler and {{translations}} of Gorky and Flaubert.

60|$|Colorow itself, once a flaming, tumultuous {{centre of}} miners, gamblers, and social outcasts, is now risen (or declined) {{to the quiet}} of a New England summer resort, {{supported}} partly by two or three big mines (whose white ore is streaked with gold), <b>but</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> more by the growing fame of its mountains and their medicinal springs, for these splendid peaks have their waters, hot and cold and sweet and bitter, whose healing powers are becoming known to an ever-growing number of those Americans who are minded to explore their native land.|$|E

60|$|There were {{years of}} doubt and waiting. He {{was a good}} boy and a bad boy, now brilliant, now touching, now disappointing, now gloriously reassuring, and now heart-rending as only the {{children}} of our blood can be.

More than anything yet it gave him the measure of his companion's subtlety, and thereby of Kate's possible career.

60|$|All this doge-like splendor Una discovered, {{but could}} {{scarcely}} believe, for {{in his own}} office Mr. Ross seemed but {{as the rest of}} us--a small round man, with a clown-like little face and hair cut Dutch-wise across his forehead.

She could not believe that he knew what a gorgeous fraud he was. On the same day, he received an advance in salary, discharged an assistant for requesting an advance in salary, and dictated a magazine filler to the effect that the chief duty of executives was to advance salaries. She could not chart him.... Thus for thousands of years have servants been amazed at the difference between pontiffs in the pulpit and pontiffs in the pantry.|$|E
60|$|Another set of wild {{people used}} to come over in boats across the North Sea and German Ocean. These people had their home {{in the country that}} is called Holstein and Jutland. They were tall men, and had blue eyes and fair hair, and they were very strong, and good-natured in a rough sort of way, though they were fierce to their enemies. There was a great deal more {{fighting}} than any one has told us about; but the end of it all was that the Roman soldiers were wanted at home, and though the great British chief we call King Arthur fought very bravely, he could not drive back the blue-eyed men in the ships; <b>but</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> more came, till, at last, they got all the country, and drove the Britons, some up into the North, some into the mountains that rise along the West of the island, and some into its west point.|$|E

60|$|I {{have been}} wounded myself {{so often that}} I {{have to stop and}} think before I can tell you the exact number of times. I have been hit by musket balls, by pistol bullets, and by {{bursting}} shells, besides being pierced by bayonet, lance, sabre, and finally by a brad-awl, which was the most painful of any. Yet out of all these injuries I have never known the same deadly sickness as came over me when I felt the poor, silent, patient creature, which I had come to love {{more than anything in the}} world except my mother and the Emperor, reel and stagger beneath me. I pulled my second pistol from my holster and fired point-blank between the fellow's broad shoulders. He slashed his horse across the flank with his whip, and for a moment I thought that I had missed him. But then on the green of his chasseur jacket I saw an ever-widening black smudge, and he began to sway in his saddle, very slightly at first, <b>but</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> more with every bound, until at last over he went, with his foot caught in the stirrup, and his shoulders thud-thud-thudding along the road, until the drag was too much for the tired horse, and I closed my hand upon the foam-spattered bridle-chain. As I pulled him up it eased the stirrup leather, and the spurred heel clinked loudly as it fell.|$|E
