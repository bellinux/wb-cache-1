40|$|Abstract. During reading, readers never fixate on all {{words in}} the text; shorter words {{sometimes}} gain zero fixation and skipped by the reader. Relying on E-Z Reader Model, this research hypothesized that a similar skipping effect also exists for a second language. The current study examined word skipping rates in EFL (English as a Foreign Language) with 75 EFL learners <b>by</b> <b>using</b> <b>eye</b> <b>tracking</b> methodology. The results showed that word skipping was affected by EFL reading proficiency significantly and articles (a, an, the) were skipped more than content words. Furthermore, more skilled learners were observed to have less fixation count and skipped more words during reading while less skilled learners employed more fixations and skipped less words. Eye tracking {{as a novel method}} to observe learner development and progress in EFL reading was also discussed...|$|E

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{importance and}} employment of usability testing has heightened {{the need for}} a careful and extensive study of usability evaluation methods and tools available. Usability testing provides a means for understanding the real picture of the product being used in a context. The aim of this Master's thesis is to understand user interaction in a video game <b>by</b> <b>using</b> the two data collection methods, <b>eye</b> <b>tracking</b> and facial expressions analysis. Usability testing in video games is one of the important factors, if carried out consistently and timely it can significantly make the video game more enjoyable, playable and provide a quality user experience to the gamers. Overall, the usability testing efforts contribute to the enhanced effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction in the gaming experience. The eye movements and facial expressions provide data which is useful for researchers to understand the user interaction of players' while playing a video game, as what objects capture their attention, what objects were ignored or didn't get attention, difficulties in progressing through the game and also players emotional state when interacting with video game elements. Total eight participants were recruited including one pilot participant to perform the usability testing. The participants were asked to play Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 and progress through the game by completing the objectives.

40|$|The {{intersection}} {{field of}} view (IFOV) indicates an extent that the visual information can be observed by drivers. It {{has been found that}} further enhancing IFOV can significantly improve emergent collision avoidance performance at intersections, such as faster brake reaction time, smaller deceleration rate, and lower traffic crash involvement risk. However, it is not known how IFOV affects drivers' eye movements, visual attention and the relationship between visual searching and traffic safety. In this study, a driving simulation experiment was conducted to uncover the changes in drivers' visual performance during the collision avoidance process as a function of different {{field of view}}s at an intersection <b>by</b> <b>using</b> an <b>eye</b> <b>tracking</b> system. The experimental results showed that drivers' ability in identifying the potential hazard in terms of visual searching was significantly affected by different IFOV conditions. As the IFOVs increased, drivers had longer gaze duration (GD) and more number of gazes (NG) in the intersection surrounding areas and paid more visual attention to capture critical visual information on the emerging conflict vehicle, thus leading to a better collision avoidance performance and a lower crash risk. It was also found that female drivers had a better visual performance and a lower crash rate than male drivers. From the perspective of drivers' visual performance, the results strengthened the evidence that further increasing intersection sight distance standards should be encouraged for enhancing traffic safety...|$|R
40|$|Neck {{dissection}} is {{a surgical}} intervention at which {{cervical lymph node}} metastases are removed. Accurate surgical planning is of high importance because wrong judgment of the situation causes severe harm for the patient.

40|$|Identifying {{precisely}} what consumers {{are looking at}} (and by implication what they are thinking) when they consider a web page, an image, or a hospitality environment could provide tremendous insights to the hospitality industry. <b>By</b> <b>using</b> <b>eye</b> <b>tracking</b> technology, one can almost literally see {{through the eyes of}} the customer to find out what information is examined at various points during the hotel search process or to assess which property design features attract guests’ attention.

In this paper we explain how eye tracking works and how it could apply to hospitality research. Today’s eye tracking systems are easy for researchers to set up and use and are virtually transparent to the participant during use, making eye tracking a valuable method for examining consumer choice or facility design, or to develop employee training procedures. We argue that eye tracking would provide rich results and deserves to be considered for a wide range of hospitality applications...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Time {{delays and}} errors exist {{which lead to}} delays in patient care and misdiagnosis. Reporting clinicians follow {{guidance}} to form their own search strategy. However, little research has tested these training guides. With the {{use of eye tracking}} technology and expert input we developed a digital training platform to be used in chest image interpretation learning. Methods: Two sections of a digital training platform were planned and developed; A) a search strategy training tool to assist reporters during their interpretation of images, and B) an educational tool to communicate the search strategies of expert viewers to trainees <b>by</b> <b>using</b> <b>eye</b> <b>tracking</b> technology. Results: A digital training platform for use in chest image interpretation was created based on evidence within the literature, expert input and two search strategies previously used in clinical practice. Images and diagrams, aiding translation of the platform content, were incorporated where possible. The platform is structured to allow the chest image interpretation process to be clear, concise and methodical. Conclusion: A search strategy was incorporated within the tool to investigate its use, with the possibility that it could be recommended as an evidence based approach for use by reporting clinicians. Eye tracking, a checklist and voice recordings have been combined to form a multi-dimensional learning tool, which has never been used in chest image interpretation learning before. The training platform for use in chest image interpretation learning has been designed, created and digitised. Future work will establish the efficacy of the developed approaches...|$|E

40|$|Purpose Automated scanpath {{comparison}} metrics should {{deliver an}} objective method {{to evaluate the}} similarity of scanpaths. The aim of this thesis is an evaluation of seven existing scanpath comparison metrics in static and dynamic tasks {{in order to provide}} a guidline that helps to decide which algorithm has to be chosen for a special kind of task. Methods The applicability of the algorithms for a static, visual search task and a dynamic, interactive video game task as well as their constraints and limitations were tested. Therefore, binocular gaze data were recorded <b>by</b> <b>using</b> the <b>eye</b> <b>tracking</b> system The <b>Eye</b> Tribe (The Eye Tribe ApS, Copenhagen/ Denmark). Objective task performance measures from 21 subjects were used in order to create scanpath groupings for which a relevant effect of dissimilarity was to be expected. Objective task performance measures such as task performance time were statistically evaluated and compared to the results gained by the comparison metrics. Results Four of the algorithms being used successfully identified differences for static and dynamic tasks: MultiMatch, iComp, SubsMatch and the Hidden Markov Model. ScanMatch was very sensitive for the static task but not applicable to the dynamic task whereas FuncSim was suitable for dynamic but not for static tasks. Eyenalysis failed to detect any effect. Conclusion The applicability of scanpath comparison metrics depends {{on the state of the}} task, respectively on the kind of experimental set up. In future, the application area for <b>eye</b> <b>tracking</b> will expand and an improvement of automated scanpath comparison metrics is therefore required...|$|R
40|$|There are {{multiple}} theoretical standpoints in Second Language Acquisition {{and the debate}} between them is far from settled. Some theories argue that the acquisition of L 1 and L 2 happen in very different ways, whilst others suggest the exact opposite. The current study attempts {{to shed light on}} this debate <b>by</b> making <b>use</b> of <b>eye</b> <b>tracking.</b> A previous study suggested that infants use selective attention to focus on the mouth to acquire the speech forms of their L 1. This study explores the possibility of a similar process occurring in Dutch L 2 learners of English. Our data suggests that {{there is a difference between}} L 1 and L 2 processing, yet no difference between processing of an L 2 that is not being learned or an L 2 that is being learned was found. Furthermore, the data suggests the possibility that the division of attention in an L 2 that is being learned is affected by the age of the learner in question. Overall, the results seem to suggest the interpretation that there are separate mechanisms for L 1 and L 2 phonological processing. Whether this this effect would also be found for more proficient learners could not be established using our data...|$|R

We are also dealing with attributing meaning to Reading learning Strategies and Use of Reading learning Startegies in correlation with gender, academic achievement, interest for reading and use of textbooks. By using Test for determining which Reading learning startegies Year 6 Primary School Students use with learning from textbooks and <b>by</b> <b>using</b> <b>Eye</b> <b>tracking</b> system on a smaller sample of Students, {{our goal is to}} illustrate Use of Reading learning Strategies with learning from textbooks more specifically. Our results show, that Year 6 Primary School Students attribute more meaning to Reading learning Strategies than actually using them, with female students both, attributing more meaning and using Reading learning Strategies more than male students, especially Strategies that are used during and after reading itself. Female students also have higher interest in reading, comparing to male students. We did not observe any significant differences between students with higher academic achievements and students with lower academic achievements in attributing meaning to Reading learning Strategies. On the other hand, we can conclude, that students with higher academic achievement have a tendency to Use Reading learning Strategies more often than students with lower academic achievements and that they show greater interest in reading itself. Students, who use textbooks for learning more often, attribute more meaning to Reading learning Strategies, Use Reading learning Strategies more often, and also show greater interest in reading. Results, obtained from the experiment, represent some important pedagogical implications. ...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{identify}} and compare key {{stages of the}} visual process in experienced and inexperienced readers and to examine how these processes are used to search a moving three-dimensional (3 D three-dimensional) image {{and their relationship to}} false-negative errors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Institutional review board research ethics approval was granted to use anonymized computed tomographic (CT) colonographic data from previous studies and to obtain eye-tracking data from volunteers. Sixty-five radiologists (27 experienced, 38 inexperienced) interpreted 23 endoluminal 3 D three-dimensional CT colonographic videos. Eye movements were recorded <b>by</b> <b>using</b> <b>eye</b> <b>tracking</b> with a desk-mounted tracker. Readers indicated when they saw a polyp by clicking a computer mouse. Polyp location and boundary on each video frame were quantified and gaze data were related to the polyp boundary for each individual reader and case. Predefined metrics were quantified and used to describe and compare visual search patterns between experienced and inexperienced readers by using multilevel modeling. RESULTS: Time to first pursuit was significantly shorter in experienced readers (hazard ratio, 1. 22 [95 % confidence interval: 1. 04, 1. 44]; P =. 017) but other metrics were not significantly different. Regardless of expertise, metrics such as assessment, identification period, and pursuit times were extended in videos where polyps were visible on screen for longer periods of time. In 97 % (760 of 787) of observations, readers correctly pursued polyps. CONCLUSION: Experienced readers had shorter time to first eye pursuit, but many other characteristics of eye tracking were similar between experienced and inexperienced readers. Readers pursued polyps in 97 % of observations, which indicated that errors during interpretation of 3 D three-dimensional CT colonography in this study occurred in either the discovery or the recognition phase, but rarely in the scanning phase of radiologic image inspection...|$|E
40|$|Dyslexia is a neurodevelopmental reading {{disability}} {{estimated to}} affect 5 - 10 % of the population. While {{there is yet}} no full understanding of the cause of dyslexia, or agreement on its precise definition, {{it is certain that}} many individuals suffer persistent problems in learning to read for no apparent reason. Although it is generally agreed that early intervention is the best form of support for children with dyslexia, there is still a lack of efficient and objective means to help identify those at risk {{during the early years of}} school. Here we show that it is possible to identify 9 - 10 year old individuals at risk of persistent reading difficulties <b>by</b> <b>using</b> <b>eye</b> <b>tracking</b> during reading to probe the processes that underlie reading ability. In contrast to current screening methods, which rely on oral or written tests, eye tracking does not depend on the subject to produce some overt verbal response and thus provides a natural means to objectively assess the reading process as it unfolds in real-time. Our study is based on a sample of 97 high-risk subjects with early identified word decoding difficulties and a control group of 88 low-risk subjects. These subjects were selected from a larger population of 2165 school children attending second grade. Using predictive modeling and statistical resampling techniques, we develop classification models from eye tracking records less than one minute in duration and show that the models are able to differentiate high-risk subjects from low-risk subjects with high accuracy. Although dyslexia is fundamentally a language-based learning disability, our results suggest that eye movements in reading can be highly predictive of individual reading ability and that eye tracking can be an efficient means to identify children at risk of long-term reading difficulties...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability to}} {{manually}} solve a tower building task {{as well as}} the capacity to predict the goal during the observation of the same task was investigated <b>by</b> the <b>use</b> of <b>eye</b> <b>tracking</b> in 12 - and 18 -month-old infants. The Mirror Neuron System is proposed to mediate a mapping of observed actions onto the individual’s own motor system. This specialized system for perceiving actions guides predictive goal-oriented eye movements and is therefore understood as the neural basis for the important social competency of action understanding. The matching of observation and executing of goal-oriented actions is thought to be dependent on the individual’s own motor experience and repertoire, implying that the emergence of such predictive gaze behavior is dependent on action development. The results from this study show that goal anticipation during action observation is dependent on performance on the manual task at a group level. In addition, {{a significant difference between the}} two groups in both their ability to predict the goal for the observed action and solve the manual task was demonstrated (only the older group were effective in both). In suggesting a link between manual ability and the ability to predict the goals of others’ actions in infants, these results add to the direct matching hypothesis and provide support to its suggested developmental course...|$|R

40|$|Using eye {{tracking}} methodology, this thesis investigates if four-month-old infants can perceive short time intervals, as sensitivity to temporal parameters underlies cognitive development. Whilst the thesis draws on theoretical frameworks of understanding how {{animals and humans}} perceive short time intervals, it extends the framework, enabling the application of one developmental model of timing {{to be used with}} much younger children (four-months-old infants, formerly children aged three years old). Six {{eye tracking}} experiments investigated how infants perceive time intervals and the factors that might influence that ability. One hundred and nine typically developing four-month- old infants participated in the experiments, from which six main findings emerged. First, overt behavioural evidence of infants keeping time over several stimulus sequences was obtained <b>by</b> <b>using</b> <b>eye</b> <b>tracking</b> methodology. This {{is the first time that}} this ability has been demonstrated using eye tracking which clearly indicates the focus of the infant's attention. Second, using naturalistic stimulus sequences young infants demonstrated a clear ability to perceive a number of different time intervals within one testing session, indicating the importance of using salient stimuli. Third, various influencing factors were observed to facilitate or hinder time perception such as speed of sequence presentation and the simultaneous presentation of both auditory and visual stimulus respectively. Fourth, the use of different information processing strategies to encode the stimuli revealed further differences in time perception. Fifth, and for the first time in these types of experiments, an infant-adapted temporal generalisation task has revealed similar results to children and animals. Sixth, infants demonstrated continued gaze-following over several stimulus sequences after a period of mutual gaze. Several issues concerning the processes underlying infant cognitive development are discussed together with their implications for later learning.

40|$|Symbol sense {{refers to}} “a complex and {{multifaceted}} “feel ” for symbols. ” (Arcavi, 1994). We are interested {{to find out}} how more skilled and less skilled students read mathematical representations such as formulas, graphs and diagrams by empirically test implications of symbol sense in mathematics <b>by</b> <b>using</b> <b>eye</b> <b>tracking.</b> In addition to acquire skills in manipulating various symbols in order to solve a mathematical problem or to prove a formula, a student in mathematics also needs to gain skills that can help in guiding the problem solving process. Symbol sense is predicted to be such a proficiency skill. While solving a mathematical problem, the student is required to analyze, identify and recognize the relevance of critical areas of a mathematical representation. We aim to operationalize behavioural expressions of symbol sense by looking at predicted eye movement behaviour. Mathematical representations are preferably presented in at least two forms, for example a graph and a formula. This means that a student is faced with multiple external representations. Ainsworth (1999) has shown three functions of a multiple external representations have. They can complement each other, they can constrain each other and they support construction of deeper knowledge (Ainsworth, 2006). However, as Ainsworth (1999; 2006) points out, translating between representations can be difficult. Presenting two forms of mathematical representations such as a graph and a formula, we can test the behavioural expressions of symbol sense because we predict that more skilled students, with well-developed symbol sense, would be more proficient in detecting critical areas of the mathematical representation. We predict that more skilled students compared to less skilled students will: solve more problems, have a larger proportion of attention allocation on the critical areas of interest and have a higher proportion of transitions between the critical areas of interest in the mathematical representations...|$|E
40|$|The {{notion that}} {{exposure}} to the natural environment positively affects human well-being has been validated by studies showing measured cognitive, psychological, and physiological benefit. This research is unique in exploring gaze behaviour on environmental images possessing different levels of saliency <b>by</b> <b>using</b> <b>eye</b> <b>tracking</b> along with traditional data collection techniques for example narratives, connectivity to nature scores and interviews. The majority of existing landscape research has been derived by conducting heuristic evaluations without having empirical insight of real participant visual response. In this research, a modern multimodal measurement approach (using Narratives and Eye tracking) was applied to investigate visual behaviour in perceiving naturalistic and urban environments. Eye behaviour is predominantly attracted by salient locations. The concept of methodology of this research on naturalistic and urban environments is drawn from the approaches in market research. Borrowing methodologies from market research that examine visual responses and qualities provided a critical and hitherto unexplored approach. This {{research has been conducted}} by using mixed methodological quantitative and qualitative approaches. This thesis focuses on two aspects of Human Environment Interaction (HEI). a) The evaluation of existing environmental research and b) The use of eye tracking as a supplementary objective environmental evaluation technique. A combined qualitative and quantitative approach has been used, including a state-of-the-art technique, eye tracking. The eye movement data were complemented by participant-profile data elicited through background questionnaires and participant-perception data as captured through semistructured interviews. This provides an insight into the participant experience that spans behavioural aspects such as visual search behaviour and visual search performance data, and subjective aspects such as participant expectations and preferences. As a result of this study, when Eye tracking data was collected and analysed two types of responses were observed: i. Immediate Involuntary Response ii. Delayed Learned Response In terms of key finding of this research, it is noticed that each participant has an individual unique navigation style, while surfing through different elements of landscape images. This individual navigation style is termed the ‘Visual Signature’, which is an immediate involuntary response. On the whole, the results of this research corroborated existing landscape research findings, but they also identified potential refinements. The research contributes both methodologically and empirically to Human-Environment Interaction (HEI). This research focused on initial impressions of environmental images with the help of eye tracking. Taking under consideration the importance of the image, this research explored the factors that influence initial fixations in relation to expectations and preferences. This research adds the necessary clarity that would complete the picture and bring an insight for future landscape researchers...|$|E

40|$|As the {{packaging}} industry looks {{to join the}} trillion-dollar club in 2018, there is an increased focus and need to innovate in boosting effectiveness of the design and gain competitive advantage by meeting consumer demands. In the cluttered shelves, packages attract, engage and capture value for brands often in the few seconds required for the shopper to make decision. Though {{studies have found that}} around 70 % of consumer decisions are made at point of purchase, there is not much data on the desirable elements that drive consumer decisions. As in most cases, consumers interacting with the packages are not involved in design and development process, it becomes difficult to understand their needs, desires and decision process. Lacking a proper understanding on desirability and its application in packaging, the management team is driven to make decision on packaging investments based on intuition and assumptions about market conditions. This ambiguity lets them view packaging as a necessary cost rather than as investment, pushing packaging and desirability to a secondary role where it is under-utilised as a medium to engage consumers at various points of interaction. With increasing consumer demand and consumer driven market conditions {{there is a need for}} packaging to differentiate the products and better meet consumer desires. By taking a desirabilitydriven approach, the management team can develop packages that satisfy consumer desires and ensure that a positive experience is provided through all the interaction points. In absence of proper understanding in the management team and lacking defined methodologies and processes to implement, measure and evaluate desirability limits designers from maximizing the business potential of packages. Moreover, it leads the designers to develop concepts that appeal to the visual senses, while businesses focus on improving the returns on investments. “That which is not measured is not fully valued” is a popular marketing rule that defines my objective for this research. By using a case study, I explore the desirability-driven design methodology used in HoviRuoka’s ready-meal package redesign to bring accountability to desirability and communicate how desirability acts as a bridge in translating consumer value into business returns. Having been involved in the design and development I bring first-hand information on the design decisions and various development activities. By covering the whole design and development process from brief definition to user testing, I define a methodology for management teams to implement desirability into the package projects, and using Packaging Value Cycle eases the process of tracking the design requirements and the design process. Defining the consumer journey for the ready-meal shoppers, I draw the connection between package and consumer interaction. Exploring the consumer decision process, helps me build a model for including desirability into package design and later evaluate it with consumers to simulate real-shopping behavior. <b>By</b> <b>using</b> <b>Eye</b> <b>tracking,</b> Packaging Value Toolkit, Willingness to pay studies and sensory testing studies the consumer decision process and desirability of packages are evaluated. Plotting the results of the tests enables the management team to translate 2 desirability of packages into business return. Based on the results the brand owner can estimate the returns to direct the development and plan his investments. From pursuing this analysis on the case, it was found that including desirability in design briefs in form of experience goals helped define direction for design team and brand owners. By including consumers into the design process key insights on their decision process, needs and desires were obtained and included in the package. This significantly influenced the package outcome as at one point 92 % of consumers preferred the new package. By taking a desirability-driven approach it was possible to identify design elements and the various activities that implement desirability into the package. Taking the concepts developed for testing it was found that the package was highly desirable among consumers even though the product pricing was higher than the competitors. Evaluating the experience across both moments and the influence of pricing on the products enables me to view the relationship between the different design attributes and how together these different attributes across the two moments influenced consumer purchase decisions. Pursing the tests in real and simulated environments ensured that consumer behavior was natural as possible within the research setting. To conclude this research discusses the implications of the desirability-driven approach brings to business and consumer value. By pursuing this research, I hope to bring accountability to desirability in package design and help brand owners evaluate their returns early in the development process and ensure that the final outcomes are positive. Taking a multidisciplinary perspective enabled me to take a design perspective that caters to strategic objectives. As packaging is a complex discipline by itself with engineers, designers, marketers and strategic decisions being involved I hope this research inspires others to also take a broader view on the influence of various perspectives on package design...|$|E
