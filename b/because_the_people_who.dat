500|$|The Big Lebowski {{was written}} {{around the same}} time as Barton Fink. When the Coen {{brothers}} wanted to make it, John Goodman was filming episodes for the Roseanne television program and Jeff Bridges was making the Walter Hill film Wild Bill. The Coens decided to make Fargo in the meantime. According to Ethan, [...] "the movie was conceived as pivoting around that relationship between the Dude and Walter", which sprang from the scenes between Barton Fink and Charlie Meadows in Barton Fink. They also {{came up with the idea}} of setting the film in contemporary L.A., <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> inspired the story lived in the area. When Pete Exline told them about the homework in a baggie incident, the Coens thought that that was very Raymond Chandler and decided to integrate elements of the author's fiction into their script. Joel Coen cites Robert Altman's The Long Goodbye as a primary influence on their film, in the sense that The Big Lebowski [...] "is just kind of informed by Chandler around the edges". When they started writing the script, the Coens wrote only 40 pages and then let it sit for a while before finishing it. This is a normal writing process for them, because they often [...] "encounter a problem at a certain stage, we pass to another project, then we come back to the first script. That way we've already accumulated pieces for several future movies." [...] In order to liven up a scene that they thought was too heavy on exposition, they added an [...] "effete art-world hanger-on", known as Knox Harrington, late in the screenwriting process. In the original script, the Dude's car was a Chrysler LeBaron, as Dowd had once owned, but that car was not big enough to fit John Goodman so the Coens changed it to a Ford Torino.|$|E

2500|$|Hume said of {{the start}} of his time at Fox that [...] "we made some {{progress}} and developed some audience and the Lewinsky scandal brought a lot of interest and the 2000 election brought a lot of interest, but what really did it was the Florida recount – that was tremendous for us <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> were worried about how that would come out wanted some place where they could trust the coverage, people who were conservatives or Republicans or neither but worried.

Physician and former Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean explained why tort reform {{is not part of}} the bills under consideration: [...] "When you go to pass a really enormous bill like that, the more stuff you put it in it, the more enemies you make, right?...And the reason tort reform is not on the bill is <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> wrote it did not want to take on the trial lawyers in addition to everybody else they were taking on. That is the plain and simple truth." ...|$|E

Fortunately, my readers, the children (and their parents) do, so as long as they love and read my books, I am happy.

And that comradre with everybody, and hearing him singing our music, which was born and raised and produced and recorded in Memphis Tennessee. It was just something I, it's hard to explain the excitement coming from being on stage and that excitement coming out of the audience. It just filled our hearts. Because they really liked us, and they really liked that good old Memphis music, and here's one of the biggest Idols singing that music. It's just pretty much an overwhelming experience that we will probably never ever get over. I hope some way we can do it again." ...|$|E

3000|$|... 14 Note {{that the}} tetrachoric {{correlation}} coefficient is 0.576, {{so that it}} is not the case that the estimates are close just <b>because</b> <b>the</b> same <b>people</b> <b>who</b> committed property crimes also committed violent crimes.

60|$|Mr. Mayor and Gentlemen,--It must be {{a matter}} of sincere {{satisfaction}} to those who, like myself, have for many years past been convinced of the vital importance of technical education to this country to see that that subject is now being taken up by {{some of the most important}} of our manufacturing towns. The evidence which is afforded of the public interest in the matter by such meetings as those at Liverpool and Newcastle, and, last but not least, by that at which I have the honour to be present to-day, may convince us all, I think, that the question has passed out of the region of speculation into that of action. I need hardly say to any one here that the task which our Association contemplates is not only one of primary importance--I may say of vital importance--to the welfare of the country; but that it is one of great extent and of vast difficulty. There is a well-worn adage that those who set out upon a great enterprise would do well to count the cost. I am not sure that this is always true. I think that some of the very greatest enterprises in this world have been carried out successfully simply <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> undertook them did not count the cost; and I am much of opinion that, in this very case, the most instructive consideration for us is the cost of doing nothing. But there is one thing that is perfectly certain, and it is that, in undertaking all enterprises, one of the most important conditions of success is to have a perfectly clear comprehension of what you want to do--to have that before your minds before you set out, and from that point of view to consider carefully the measures which are best adapted to the end.|$|E
