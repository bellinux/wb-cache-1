5|$|Chemical {{compounds}} can <b>bind</b> to troponin C {{to act as}} troponin activators (calcium sensitizers) or troponin inhibitors (calcium desensitizers). There {{are already}} multiple troponin activators that <b>bind</b> to fast skeletal troponin C, of which tirasemtiv has been tested in multiple clinical trials. In contrast, there are no known compounds that <b>bind</b> with high affinity to cardiac troponin C. The calcium sensitizer, levosimendan, is purported to <b>bind</b> to troponin C, but only weak or inconsistent binding has been detected, precluding any structure determination. In contrast, levosimendan inhibits type 3 phosphodiesterase with nanomolar affinity, so its biological target is controversial.|$|E

5|$|Rat Mups <b>bind</b> {{different}} small chemicals. 1-Chlorodecane is {{the most}} common ligand, with 2-methyl-N-phenyl-2-propenamide, hexadecane and 2,6,11-trimethyl decane found to be less prominent. Rat Mups also <b>bind</b> limonene-1,2-epoxide, resulting in a disease of the host's kidney, hyaline-droplet nephropathy, that progresses to cancer. Other species do not develop this disorder because their Mups do not <b>bind</b> that particular chemical. Accordingly, when transgenic mice were engineered to express the rat Mup their kidneys developed the disease.|$|E

5|$|Some {{compounds}} {{have been}} identified to <b>bind</b> cNTnC with low affinity and act as troponin activators: DFBP-O (a structural analog of levosimendan), 4-(4-(2,5-dimethylphenyl)-1-piperazinyl)-3-pyridinamine (NCI147866), and bepridil. The calmodulin antagonist, W7, has also been found to <b>bind</b> to cNTnC {{to act as a}} troponin inhibitor. All of these compounds <b>bind</b> to the hydrophobic patch in the open conformation of cNTnC, with troponin activators promoting interaction with the cTnI switch peptide and troponin inhibitors destabilizing the interaction.|$|E
5|$|All the {{functions}} of DNA depend on interactions with proteins. These protein interactions can be non-specific, or the protein can <b>bind</b> specifically to a single DNA sequence. Enzymes can also <b>bind</b> to DNA and of these, the polymerases that copy the DNA base sequence in transcription and DNA replication are particularly important.|$|E
5|$|An enzyme {{inhibitor}} is a molecule that binds to an enzyme and decreases its activity. Since blocking an enzyme's activity can kill a pathogen or correct a metabolic imbalance, many drugs are {{enzyme inhibitor}}s. They {{are also used}} in pesticides. Not all molecules that <b>bind</b> to enzymes are inhibitors; enzyme activators <b>bind</b> to enzymes and increase their enzymatic activity, while enzyme substrates <b>bind</b> and are converted to products in the normal catalytic cycle of the enzyme.|$|E

5|$|Damage to DNA {{alters the}} spatial {{configuration}} of the helix, and such alterations can be detected by the cell.

5|$|Enzymes must <b>bind</b> their {{substrates}} {{before they}} can catalyse any chemical reaction. Enzymes are usually very specific as to what substrates they <b>bind</b> and then the chemical reaction catalysed. Specificity is achieved by binding pockets with complementary shape, charge and hydrophilic/hydrophobic characteristics to the substrates. Enzymes can therefore distinguish between very similar substrate molecules to be chemoselective, regioselective and stereospecific.|$|E

5|$|In contrast, other {{proteins}} {{have evolved}} to <b>bind</b> to particular DNA sequences. The most intensively studied of these are the various transcription factors, which are proteins that regulate transcription. Each transcription factor binds to one particular set of DNA sequences and activates or inhibits the transcription of genes that have these sequences close to their promoters. The transcription factors do this in two ways. Firstly, they can <b>bind</b> the RNA polymerase responsible for transcription, either directly or through other mediator proteins; this locates the polymerase at the promoter and allows it to begin transcription. Alternatively, transcription factors can <b>bind</b> enzymes that modify the histones at the promoter. This changes the accessibility of the DNA template to the polymerase.|$|E

5|$|Often, once an {{antibody}} and antigen <b>bind,</b> {{they become}} an immune complex, which {{functions as a}} unitary object and can act as an antigen in its own right, being countered by other antibodies. Similarly, haptens are small molecules that provoke no immune response by themselves, but once they <b>bind</b> to proteins, the resulting complex or hapten-carrier adduct is antigenic.|$|E
5|$|Proteins can <b>bind</b> {{to other}} {{proteins}} {{as well as}} to small-molecule substrates. When proteins <b>bind</b> specifically to other copies of the same molecule, they can oligomerize to form fibrils; this process occurs often in structural proteins that consist of globular monomers that self-associate to form rigid fibers. Protein–protein interactions also regulate enzymatic activity, control progression through the cell cycle, and allow the assembly of large protein complexes that carry out many closely related reactions with a common biological function. Proteins can also <b>bind</b> to, or even be integrated into, cell membranes. The ability of binding partners to induce conformational changes in proteins allows the construction of enormously complex signaling networks.|$|E

5|$|To combat {{pathogens}} that replicate outside cells, antibodies <b>bind</b> to pathogens to link them together, {{causing them}} to agglutinate. Since an antibody has at least two paratopes, it can <b>bind</b> more than one antigen by binding identical epitopes carried on the surfaces of these antigens. By coating the pathogen, antibodies stimulate effector functions against the pathogen in cells that recognize their Fc region.|$|E
5|$|A {{competitive}} inhibitor and substrate cannot <b>bind</b> to {{the enzyme}} {{at the same}} time. Often competitive inhibitors strongly resemble the real substrate of the enzyme. For example, the drug methotrexate is a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase, which catalyzes the reduction of dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate. The similarity between the structures of dihydrofolate and this drug are shown in the accompanying figure. This type of inhibition can be overcome with high substrate concentration. In some cases, the inhibitor can <b>bind</b> to a site other than the binding-site of the usual substrate and exert an allosteric effect to change {{the shape of the}} usual binding-site.|$|E

40|$|The {{extent of}} binding of 10 radioactively labeled odorant amino acids to a sedimentable {{fraction}} (fraction P 2) {{derived from the}} olfactory rosettes of the rainbow trout Salmo gairdneri corresponded closely with their reported relative stimulatory effectiveness measured electrophysiologically. L isomers were bound {{to a greater extent}} than their respective D isomers. <b>Binding</b> of L-alanine was strongly and irreversibly inhibited by mercurials but was not affected by sulfhydryl-blocking reagents. <b>Binding</b> was saturable and reversible. Scatchard analyses gave evidence of two types of binding sites for most of the amino acids studied. The Kd values of the higher-affinity binding sites were similar among the amino acids, being in the range of 10 (- 6) M; differences occurred in the relative numbers of sites, n. These results, coupled with those from competition experiments, lead to the postulate that a multiplicity of types of olfactory binding sites exist in the trout: site TSA, which <b>binds</b> L-threonine, L-serine, and L-alanine; site L, which <b>binds</b> L-lysine; and site AB which <b>binds</b> beta-alanine. Tentative assignments are: site V, which <b>binds</b> L-valine; site H, which <b>binds</b> L-histidine; and site AD, which <b>binds</b> D-alanine.
