50|$|When {{the nuclear}} fuel {{increases}} in temperature, the rapid {{motion of the}} atoms in the fuel causes an effect known as Doppler broadening. The fuel then sees {{a wider range of}} relative neutron speeds. Uranium-238, which forms the bulk of the uranium in the reactor, is much more likely to absorb fast or epithermal neutrons at higher temperatures. This reduces the number of neutrons available to cause fission, and reduces the power of the reactor. Doppler <b>broadening</b> <b>therefore</b> creates a negative feedback because as fuel temperature increases, reactor power decreases. All reactors have reactivity feedback mechanisms, but the pebble-bed reactor is designed so that this effect is very strong. Also, it is automatic and does not depend on any kind of machinery or moving parts. If the rate of fission increases, temperature will increase and Doppler broadening will occur, decreasing the rate of fission. This creates passive cooling.|$|E

40|$|Few-cycle pulses offer a {{wide range}} of {{interesting}} applications, for example in time-resolved studies of ultra-fast phenomena in physics, chemistry and biology. Nonlinear spectral broadening in photonic crystal fibers (PCFs) followed by dispersive compression allows for the generation of extremely short optical pulses. By employing this technique pulse durations of only 5. 5 fs (2. 4 optical cycles) have been achieved so far. In this contribution we take advantage of SC generation in all-normal dispersion PCF (ANDi PCF), which features only positive group-velocity dispersion across the spectral region of interest. Spectral <b>broadening</b> <b>therefore</b> is dominated by self-phase modulation and optical wave breaking, leading to smooth and highly coherent SC spectra. We show generation of SC spectra covering more than one optical octave around 810 nm central wavelength. Active phase control and spectral shaping were employed to compress the pulses to 3. 64 fs (1. 3 optical cycles), which is the shortest pulse duration achieved from SC compression in solid core fibers to date. In contrast to other approaches, the presented concept delivers pulses with an excellent temporal pulse quality and can be extended to even larger bandwidths to reach the sub-cycle regime, provided an adequate compressor is employed. © 2012 SPIE...|$|E

40|$|OralWe present {{numerical}} {{simulations of}} angle-resolved reflectivity of bulk ZnO microcavities with SiN/SiO 2 distributed Bragg reflectors. The goal {{of these studies}} {{is to determine the}} conditions for observation of strong exciton-photon coupling at room temperature in such systems, which has been reported very recently. Indeed ZnO microcavities present a very specific hierarchy of interactions compared to GaAs or II-VI microcavities : the awaited Rabi splitting is larger than the Rydberg energy for excitons, which is larger than the splitting between the A,B,C valence bands. In our model the coupling of both fundamental and excited states of the optically active free excitons (XA, XB, XC) with the cavity mode is taken into account. The specific values of oscillator strength and excitonic binding energy in ZnO require that we include the above band gap absorption continuum. We do so by using Elliott's model of the dielectric function. We neglect disorder and inhomogeneous broadening in our calculations. The reflectivity spectra of the microcavity is calculated by a transfer matrix model, where either the ZnO thickness or the angle is varied in order to calculate the dispersion of the polaritonic branches. Those are compared to the dispersions obtained from a quasi-particle model which includes the excitonic continuum. The expansion coefficients of the polaritonic modes upon the photon-exciton basis are determined, as well as their coherence time. We show that the lower polariton branch is a well-defined and well-mixed exciton-photon state for low angles and/or negative detunings. The energy splitting induced by the strong oscillator strength in ZnO can be larger than the exciton binding energy, thus pushing the upper polariton branch into the absorption continuum and leading to a large intrinsic <b>broadening.</b> <b>Therefore</b> experimental evidence of strong coupling regime in bulk ZnO microcavities and its interpretation are difficult.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is concerned}} with the acquisition of three-dimensional image data of chromatography columns in capillary format using confocal laser scanning microscopy {{as well as with the}} reconstruction and analysis of the acquired image data in view of the dispersive properties of the separation column. Key aspect in the characterization are radial heterogeneities because in UHPLC these heterogeneities contribute in large part to dispersive band <b>broadening.</b> <b>Therefore,</b> radial heterogeneities carry a particular significance in the development of chromatography columns of improved separation efficiency. Consecutively, the topics that are covered in the individual chapters of this work are being summarized: - Chapter 1 and 2 deal with the development of a sample setup for the aberration free optical imaging of capillary chromatography columns via confocal laser scanning microscopy. Additionally, image processing methods are presented that enable image restoration, particle detection, and segmentation of acquired image data. The image data were analyzed using chord length distributions and radial porosity profiles. Subsequent chapters are concerned with the application of the presented method. Herein, focus lies on a characterization of local structural density on the length scales used in J. C. Giddings’ eddy dispersion theory. - In Chapter 3 the separation efficiencies of eleven MTMS-hybrid monoliths were correlated with pore size distribution and wall attachment which outlines a fundamental problem that accompanies the preparation of capillary monoliths. - A first study on the influence of packing parameters on separation efficiency and bed morphology of packed beds was performed in Chapter 4. Six capillary columns of varying inner diameter from 10 µm to 75 µm were packed with 1. 7 µm Acquity BEH particles and evaluated for their chromatographic and morphological properties. It was observed that separation efficiency would drop with increasing capillary i. d [...] This could be explained by a lower packing density in the wall region of these capillaries. Furthermore, size segregation of particles was observed. - Chapter 5 discusses morphological differences between capillaries packed with core–shell particles and capillaries packed with fully porous particles. Owed to their differing production process the former do have a particle size distribution that is much narrower than the particle size distribution of fully porous particles, which yields a substantially different ordering of the particles in the wall region of the capillaries. - Chapter 6 compares a silica monolith and a sub- 2 µm packing in 20 µm i. d. capillaries. The study discusses the microstructure of these columns with regard to transchannel, short-range interchannel, and transcolumn dispersion using the already established descriptors and discusses the potential of each kind of bed structure. - Chapter 7 picks up the results of Chapter 4 and shows how bed microstructure is affected by the slurry concentration used in the slurry packing process. The study showed that the previously observed size segregation of particles can be suppressed by increasing the slurry concentration yielding improved separation efficiency. The trade-off with higher slurry concentrations was an increased number of packing gaps, both in fully porous and core–shell packed beds. Once again, the chapter highlights the potential of using microscopic reconstruction and an analysis of macroscopic separation efficiency comprehensively and illustrates that the packing of beds of increasing inner diameter requires higher slurry concentrations. The concentrations should be chosen to suppress particle size segregation while keeping the amount of packing gaps as small as possible...|$|E

The effects of cryocooling on single and multi-domain crystals were compared. The effects of cryocooling on insulin structure were also re-examined. Microgravity crystals were larger, more homogeneous, and more perfect than earth crystals. Several mg crystals contained primarily a single mosaic domain with havg of 0. 005 deg. The earth crystals varied in quality and all contained multiple domains with havg of 0. 031 deg. Cryocooling caused a 43 -fold increase in h for mg crystals (havg= 0. 217 deg) and an %fold increase for earth crystals (havg= 0. 246 deg).

40|$|The {{auditory}} {{system has}} two primary functions: identification and {{localization of sound}} sources. A major cue for determining the location of low-frequency sounds is the interaural time difference (ITD) created by the unequal path lengths that a sound must travel to reach each ear. This dissertation examined how ITDs are coded in the inferior colliculus (IC) of the unanesthetized rabbit. ^ The basic anatomy and physiology of the IC have been well characterized. Counter to physiological and structural evidence for integration, a common assumption is that separate populations of neurons exist to code identification and localization cues. The coding of identification cues and localization cues are often studied separately. Here, amplitude modulation, a representative identification cue, was combined with ITDs. Neurons were able to simultaneously code modulation and ITDs. Modulation had a graded effect on firing rate from extreme enhancement to extreme suppression. Mechanisms to explain these effects were then studied. Physical differences in the modulated and unmodulated signals, including the interaural correlation, energy, and spectrum did not provide clear answers. Subsequently, the convergence of monaural and binaural inputs on single cells was tested by adding modulation to each ear separately. The results were consistent with adaptive mechanisms. The population of ITD-sensitive neurons differentially codes modulation by independently decreasing and increasing their firing rate to modulation while leaving ITD tuning unaffected. ^ Also addressed was the interaction of excitatory and inhibitory projections to the IC. The role of GABAergic inhibition in sharpening ITD tuning curves in the IC was studied using iontophoresis. The most salient effect GABA-antagonists was to substantially increase discharge rate. Blocking GABA caused the ITD tuning curves of many neurons to <b>broaden.</b> <b>Therefore,</b> GABA may keep a neuron at its optimal activity level, improving the signal-to-noise ratio and sharpening ITD tuning curves. Functionally, sharper ITD tuning curves may require fewer neurons to achieve a given level of acuity. ^ In summary, common neural mechanisms used to process a natural environment were explored. The structure of the IC and its place an obligatory stop in the auditory pathway make it an ideal nucleus for transforming the neural code. ...|$|R

Since spectral broadening bandwidth depends on electron density fluctuation and solar wind speed, and latitudinal variation of the former is available from coherence bandwidth measurements, the remote sensing spectral broadening measurements provide the first determination of the latitudinal variation of solar wind speed in the acceleration region.

The ADAAA makes changes to the definition of the term [...] "disability," [...] clarifying and <b>broadening</b> that definition—and <b>therefore</b> the number and types of persons who are protected under the ADA and other Federal disability nondiscrimination laws. It was designed {{to strike a balance between}} employer and employee interests.|$|R
