But this--there is no denying it--is simply impossible. We can only hope to approximate to the conditions; and if we don't succeed in getting you nearly enough <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> were, this venture of ours will fail. If we do succeed--and I am myself hopeful of success--you may at least so far repeat your proceedings on the birthday night, as to satisfy any reasonable person that you are guiltless, morally speaking, of the theft of the Diamond. I believe, Mr. Blake, I have now stated the question, on both sides of it, as fairly as I can, within the limits that I have imposed on myself. If there is anything that I have not made clear to you, tell me what it is--and if I can enlighten you, I will." ...|$|E
60|$|Hundreds of {{men might}} be named, whose works are highly {{instructive}} {{in the management}} of calm water. De Wint is singularly powerful and certain, exquisitely bright and vigorous in color. The late John Varley produced some noble passages. I have seen, some seven years ago, works by J. Holland, which were, I think, as near perfection as water-color can be carried--for bona fide truth, refined and finished to the highest degree. But the power of modern artists is not brought out until they have greater difficulties to struggle with. Stand for half an hour beside the fall of Schaffhausen, on the north side where the rapids are long, and watch how the vault of water first bends, unbroken, in pure, polished velocity, over the arching rocks at the brow of the cataract, covering them with a dome of crystal twenty feet thick--so swift that its motion is unseen except when a foam globe from above darts over it like a falling star; and how the trees are lighted above it under all their leaves, at the instant that it breaks into foam; and how all the hollows of that foam burn with green fire like so much shattering chrysoprase; and how, ever and anon, startling you with its white flash, a jet of spray leaps hissing out of the fall like a rocket, bursting in the wind and driven away in dust, filling the air with light; and how, through the curdling wreaths of the restless, crashing abyss below, the blue of the water, paled by the foam in its body, shows purer than the sky through white rain-cloud; while the shuddering iris stoops in tremulous stillness over all, fading and flushing alternately through the choking spray and shattered sunshine, hiding itself at last among the thick golden leaves which toss to and fro in sympathy with the wild water; their dripping masses lifted at intervals, like sheaves of loaded corn, by some stronger gush from the cataract, and bowed again upon the mossy rocks as its roar dies away; the dew gushing from their thick branches through drooping clusters of emerald herbage, and sparkling in white threads along the dark rocks of the shore, feeding the lichens which chase and checker them with purple and silver. I believe, when you have stood by this for half an hour, you will have discovered that there is something more in nature than has been given by Ruysdael. Probably you will not be much disposed to think of any mortal work at the time; but when you look <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> have seen, and are inclined to compare it with art, you will remember--or ought to remember--Nesfield. He is a man of extraordinary feeling, both for the color and the spirituality of a great waterfall; exquisitely delicate in his management of the changeful veil of spray or mist; just in his curves and contours; and unequalled in color except by Turner. None of our water-color painters can approach him {{in the management of}} the variable hues of clear water over weeded rocks; but his feeling for it often leads him a little too far, and, like Copley Fielding, he loses sight of simplicity and dignity for the sake of delicacy or prettiness. His waterfalls are, however, unequalled in their way; and, if he would remember, that in all such scenes there is much gloom as well as much splendor, and relieve the lustre of his attractive passages of color with more definite and prevalent grays, and give a little more substance to parts of his picture unaffected by spray, his work would be nearly perfect. His seas are also most instructive; a little confused in chiaroscuro, but refined in form and admirable in color.|$|E

5000|$|The band {{brought in}} Youth to produce, having had good {{experiences}} with his production on singles All You Good Good People and Come <b>Back</b> <b>to</b> <b>What</b> <b>You</b> Know {{from their first}} album, The Good Will Out. Most of the band were excited about the effect that bringing new leadership into the studio was having on their music, but Danny McNamara, the band's lead singer, {{had a tough time}} adjusting to Youth's production style: [...] "January, February and March this year were the hardest time of my life. I was getting four hours sleep a night. Every morning I'd get up and have to take a pill just to stay calm that day. The amount of arguments and throwing shit...It was really intense." [...] Youth changed McNamara's song structures, his lyrics, and pushed him to sing with more emotion. Said McNamara: [...] "There were times I hated him. I'd ring our manager and have meetings with the label, where I'd say, 'Look, can you tell him who's boss? 'Cause he's not listening to me.'" [...] Thankfully, the label kept its position that Youth was in charge, because gradually, things started to click between the band and its producer. McNamara eventually changed his tune, saying, [...] "I think I've grown as a person...the idea of relinquishing control and just having a bit of belief and faith in someone else is new to me in my thirty-three years. And it's paid off. I've left my ego at the door." [...] Several songs began to take shape and sound that had previously eluded the band.|$|E

40|$|This article offers {{advice for}} anyone {{preparing}} to interview for a deanship - go <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> are passionate about to really express how you might approach {{serving as a}} law dean. In this case, the passion centers {{on the subject of}} land use planning and sustainable development law. When interviewing for the position of dean of a law school, Academics who rise through the ranks to a deanship have a background in legal scholarship that often marries theory and practice. Faculty spend countless hours, even years, developing theories and concepts to advance the law in a particular discipline. Hopefully, the investment of time indicates a passion for the subject matter. Individual perspective on any subject matter can shine light on attitude and approach to problem-solving, vision, and passion. The recommendation to decanal candidates is skip the 2 ̆ 2 copycat 2 ̆ 2 discussions of boring and rote 2 ̆ 2 role of the law school dean, 2 ̆ 2 and demonstrate the kind of dean you would be through examination of your own area of law teaching and/or scholarship. While analogies to real estate development make sense through the land use and sustainable development law lens, the conversation can flow just as easily through business organizations, family law, alternative dispute resolution and dozens of other fields...|$|E

During his lifetime, Khushwant Singh was keen on burial because he believed that with a burial you give <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the earth <b>what</b> <b>you</b> have taken.

5000|$|... "To the One of Fictive Music" [...] is a poem from Wallace Stevens's {{first book}} of poetry, Harmonium. First {{published}} in 1922, {{it is in}} the public domain. [...] Sister and mother and diviner love, And of the sisterhood of the living dead Most near, most clear, and of the clearest bloom, And of the fragrant mothers the most dear And queen, and of diviner love the day And flame and summer and sweet fire, no thread Of cloudy silver sprinkles in your gown Its venom of renown, and on your head No crown is simpler than the simple hair. Now, of the music summoned by the birth That separates us from the wind and sea, Yet leaves us in them, until earth becomes, By being so much of the things we are, Gross effigy and simulacrum, none Gives motion to perfection more serene Than yours, out of our imperfections wrought, Most rare, or ever of more kindred air In the laborious weaving that you wear. For so retentive of themselves are men That music is intensest which proclaims The near, the clear, and vaunts the clearest bloom, And of all the vigils musing the obscure, That apprehends the most which sees and names, As in your name, an image that is sure, Among the arrant spices of the sun, O bough and bush and scented vine, in whom We give ourselves our likest issuance. Yet not too like, yet not so like to be Too near, too clear, saving a little to endow Our feigning with the strange unlike, whence springs The difference that heavenly pity brings. For this, musician, in your girdle fixed Bear other perfumes. On your pale head wear A band entwining, set with fatal stones. Unreal, give <b>back</b> <b>to</b> us <b>what</b> once <b>you</b> gave: The imagination that we spurned and crave. Stevens, the musical imagist, invokes the muse of poetry for [...] "an image that is sure" [...] in a kind of music that [...] "gives motion to perfection more serene" [...] than other forms of music summoned by the human condition. The poet aims at a kind of simplicity and spurns [...] "the venom of renown." [...] The poet's muse might be compared in these respects to Socrates' philosophical muse. Socrates condemned the sophists and Stevens' queen rejects vices analogous to theirs in poetry. The dim view of renown poetically reinforces the Adagia dictum: [...] "Poetry is, (and should be,) for the poet, a source of pleasure and satisfaction, not a source of honors." ...|$|R
