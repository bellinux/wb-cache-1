The archbishop went to Rome along with Bishop Cyneberht of Winchester, and carried two letters from Coenwulf to the pope. After some discussions, Leo sided with Canterbury and demoted Lichfield <b>back</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> a bishopric. Besides these papal actions, {{there are indications that}} the cathedral clergy of Canterbury never recognised the elevation of Lichfield.|$|E
5|$|Polonium-210 is {{widespread}} in the biosphere, including in human tissues, because of {{its position in the}} uranium-238 decay chain. Natural uranium-238 in the Earth's crust decays through a series of solid radioactive intermediates including radium-226 to the radioactive noble gas radon-222, some of which, during its 3.8-day half-life, diffuses into the atmosphere. There it decays through several more steps to polonium-210, much of which, during its 138-day half-life, is washed <b>back</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the Earth's surface, thus entering the biosphere, before finally decaying to stable lead-206.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of their warming effects when {{relatively}} thin, cirrus clouds have been implicated as a potential partial cause of global warming. Scientists have speculated that global warming could cause high thin cloud cover to increase, thereby increasing temperatures and humidity. This, in turn, would increase the cirrus cloud cover, effectively creating a positive feedback circuit. A prediction of this hypothesis is that the cirrus would move higher as the temperatures rose, increasing the volume of air underneath the clouds and the amount of infrared radiation reflected <b>back</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> earth. In addition, the hypothesis suggests that the increase in temperature would tend to increase the size of the ice crystals in the cirrus cloud, possibly causing the reflection of solar radiation and the reflection of the Earth's infrared radiation to balance out.|$|E

5|$|Brimsek {{started the}} 1938–39 {{season with the}} Reds, {{but he would not}} stay long with them. During an NHL {{exhibition}} game, Thompson got injured and it was unlikely that Thompson would recuperate in time for the beginning of the regular season. Needing a replacement, Brimsek was called up by the Bruins. In his NHL debut, Brimsek helped his team defeat the Toronto Maple Leafs by a score of 3–2. He started in net for one more game, a 4–1 victory against the Red Wings, before being sent <b>back</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the Reds as Thompson recovered. Art Ross, the Bruins' coach and general manager, had seen enough of Brimsek during his two stints in Boston to contemplate promoting Brimsek full-time with the Bruins. Thompson was traded to the Detroit Red Wings for goaltender Normie Smith and $15,000.00 U.S. cash on November 16, 1938, after playing only five games with the Bruins. Ross then proceeded to promote Brimsek as the team's new starting goalie. This did not sit well with Bruins fans as Thompson was a favorite and he was the reigning Vezina Trophy winner.|$|E
5|$|Further east, the strongpoint {{defenses}} were effective. On the Dog Red / Easy Green boundary, {{the defenses}} around the Les Moulins strongpoint took a heavy {{toll on the}} remaining 2nd Battalion, with H/116 and headquarters elements struggling ashore there. The survivors joined the remnants of F/116 behind the shingle, and here the battalion commander was able to organize 50 men for an improvised advance across the shingle. A further advance up the bluffs just east of Les Moulins {{was too weak to}} have any effect and was forced <b>back</b> <b>down.</b> <b>To</b> their left, mainly between the draws on the Easy Green / Easy Red boundary, the 116th RCT's support battalion landed without too much loss, although they did become scattered, and were too disorganized to play any immediate part in an assault on the bluffs.|$|E

Meanwhile, the Canadian national junior team wanted the Rangers to loan him to them for the 2000 World Junior Championships. On December 12, 1999, general manager Neil Smith obliged and assigned Malhotra for the international tournament. He was then sent for a two-week conditioning assignment with the Rangers' American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Hartford Wolf Pack. On March 14, 2000, he was sent <b>back</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the OHL in order to retain his eligibility for later AHL assignment in the season. Malhotra had dressed for only four games in the two months between his return from the World Junior Championships in early-January and his junior reassignment. He was pointless in the 27 games total he played with the Rangers that season.|$|E

5|$|Marriages among ruling dynasties {{and their}} {{subjects}} have at times been common, with the marriages {{such as that}} of Edward the Confessor, King of England with Edith of Wessex and Władysław II Jagiełło, King of Poland with Elizabeth Granowska being far from unheard of in medieval Europe. However, as dynasties approached absolutism and sought to preserve loyalty among competing members of the nobility, most eventually distanced themselves from kinship ties to local nobles by marrying abroad. Marriages with subjects brought the king <b>back</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the level of those he ruled, often stimulating the ambition of his consort's family and evoking jealousy—or disdain—from the nobility. The notion that monarchs should marry into the dynasties of other monarchs to end or prevent war was, at first, a policy driven by pragmatism. During the era of absolutism, this practice contributed to the notion that it was socially, as well as politically, disadvantageous for members of ruling families to intermarry with their subjects and pass over the opportunity for marriage into a foreign dynasty.|$|E
5|$|On August 15, 2005, Tambellini {{signed an}} {{entry-level}} {{contract with the}} Kings, foregoing his senior year with Michigan. In late-September, {{he was assigned to}} their American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Manchester Monarchs, following his training camp with Los Angeles. Two months into the season, Tambellini was called up to the Kings, making his NHL debut on November 30, 2005, against the Chicago Blackhawks. The Kings lost the game 3–2, while Tambellini earned nine minutes of ice time. After four pointless NHL games, he was sent <b>back</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> Manchester. On March 8, 2006, Tambellini was traded by the Kings, along with defenceman Denis Grebeshkov, to the New York Islanders, in exchange for forward Mark Parrish and defenceman Brent Sopel. Upon being dealt, he was called up from the AHL and played the remainder of the season with New York. He left Manchester with 25 goals and 56 points in 56 games, which finished the 2005–06 AHL season ranked as the third-best points-per-game rate among league rookies.|$|E

Up and down all season as the Red Sox made use of his options, he got a call-up—prompted by Bill Mueller having back spasms in batting practice—one August day as he was in Pawtucket's clubhouse before a game. Without changing out of the same white pants that he wore for both Boston and Pawtucket home games, he packed his car, drove the 40 miles to Boston, walked into the Red Sox clubhouse, changed his jersey and cleats, and was ready to play.|$|E

By 0600 UTC on August 29, the storm reached Category 3 intensity with winds of 115 mph (185 km/h)–this {{would be the}} storm's maximum intensity. However, {{the hurricane}} weakened <b>back</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> Category 1 strength before making landfall just after midnight on August 30 near Matagorda and Palacios, Texas. At the time, the storm had maximum sustained winds of 80mph (130km/h), with hurricane-force winds extending out 150mi (240km) from the storm's center of circulation. The hurricane's minimum central pressure at landfall was estimated at 950mbar (hPa; 28.06inHg), though a pressure reading of 952mbar (hPa; 28.16inHg) in Seadrift, Texas marked the lowest recorded pressure. Once inland, the storm quickly weakened, and degenerated to tropical storm strength at 1200UTC on August30 while located near Hallettsville, Texas. Weakening to a tropical depression the following day, it dissipated at 1200UTC on August30 near Sweetwater, Texas.|$|E

The Great White Fleet then began its crossing of the Pacific, with a visit to Hawaii on the way. Stops in the South Pacific included Melbourne, Sydney, and Auckland. After leaving Australia, the fleet turned north for the Philippines, stopping in Manila, before continuing on to Japan where a welcoming ceremony was held in Yokohama. Three weeks of exercises followed in Subic Bay in the Philippines in November. The ships passed Singapore on 6 December and entered the Indian Ocean; they coaled in Colombo before proceeding to the Suez Canal and coaling again at Port Said, Egypt. The fleet called in several Mediterranean ports before stopping in Gibraltar, where an international fleet of British, Russian, French, and Dutch warships greeted the Americans. The ships then crossed the Atlantic to return to Hampton Roads on 22 February 1909. There, they conducted a naval review for President Theodore Roosevelt.|$|E
5|$|The use {{of water}} to {{extinguish}} the fire was also frustrated. In principle, water was available from a system of elm pipes which supplied 30,000 houses via a high water tower at Cornhill, filled from the river at high tide, and also via a reservoir of Hertfordshire spring water in Islington. It was often possible to open a pipe near a burning building and connect it to a hose to play on a fire or fill buckets. Further, Pudding Lane {{was close to the}} river.
