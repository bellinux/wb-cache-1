In {{the space of}} a single <b>business</b> <b>quarter,</b> Iger went from speaking of Frozens [...] "franchise potential" [...] (in February 2014) to saying that it was [...] "probably" [...] one of Disney's [...] "top five franchises" [...] (in May 2014). The film's massive popularity resulted in an unusually severe merchandise shortage in the United States and several other industrialized countries in April 2014, which caused resale prices for higher-quality limited-edition Frozen dolls and costumes to skyrocket past $1,000 on eBay. By the time the merchandise shortage was finally resolved in early November 2014 (nearly a year after the film's release), Disney had sold over three million Frozen costumes in North America alone. Wait times for the meet-and-greets at Disney Parks soon regularly exceeded four hours and forced management in February 2014 to indefinitely extend what was originally intended as a temporary film promotion. Disney Parks later put on a temporary event (Frozen Summer Fun) at Disney's Hollywood Studios, then announced on September 12, 2014, that the Maelstrom ride at Epcot's Norway pavilion would be closed and replaced with a Frozen-based attraction, which opened in early 2016. On May 27, 2016, a live Frozen musical stage show officially opened at the Hyperion Theater in Disney California Adventure, replacing the venue's previous show, [...] By August 2014, the publisher Random House had sold over 8 million Frozen-related books. Tour operators, including Adventures by Disney, added more Norway tours in response to rising demand during 2014.|$|E

However, in 1929, the three-story Taishoya Kimono Shop was constructed, surrounded by shops and movie theaters. It was said that if you went up to the roof, a panoramic view of the city awaited. In 1943 the Kimono Shop was closed and in June 1944, as World War ll intensified and economic controls became increasingly stringent, the building was purchased by the Prefectural Fuel Rationing Union ...|$|E

Renewed plans were released in 2008 for the £150 million redevelopment, promising over 2,800 new jobs in the area due to the new shops and offices which would be created. However, the 2008–2012 global recession also saw these plans fail to materialise. Network Rail and East Midlands Trains started work on a £3.5 million scheme in 2012. Platforms have been resurfaced, toilets and both first and standard class waiting areas refurbished. However, the majority of work {{has taken place in}} the concourse and porte corche area where a new travel centre is being provided, increased retail facilities and separation between cars and people.|$|E

2500|$|A {{report in}} 1920 {{proposed}} {{the demolition of}} nineteen City churches, including St Magnus. A general outcry {{from members of the}} public and parishioners alike prevented the execution of this plan. The members of the City Livery Club passed a resolution that they regarded [...] "with horror and indignation the proposed demolition of 19 City churches" [...] and pledged the club to do everything in its power to prevent such a catastrophe. [...] T. S. Eliot wrote that the threatened churches gave [...] "to the <b>business</b> <b>quarter</b> of London a beauty which its hideous banks and commercial houses have not quite defaced. ... the least precious redeems some vulgar street ... The loss of these towers, to meet the eye down a grimy lane, and of these empty naves, to receive the solitary visitor at noon from the dust and tumult of Lombard Street, will be irreparable and unforgotten." [...] The London County Council published a report concluding that St Magnus was [...] "one of the most beautiful of all Wren's works" [...] and [...] "certainly one of the churches which should not be demolished without specially good reasons and after very full consideration." [...] Due to the uncertainty about the church's future, the patron decided to defer action to fill the vacancy in the benefice and a curate-in-charge temporarily took responsibility for the parish. However, on 23 April 1921 it was announced that the Revd Henry Joy Fynes-Clinton would be the new rector. The Times concluded that the appointment, with the bishop’s approval, meant that the proposed demolition would not be carried out. [...] Fr Fynes-Clinton was inducted on 31 May 1921.|$|E

60|$|Many {{of these}} great and dusty {{galleries}} were silent avenues of machinery, endless raked out ashen furnaces testified to the revolutionary dislocation, but wherever there was work it was being done by slow-moving workers in blue canvas. The only people not in blue canvas were the overlookers of the work-places and the orange-clad Labour Police. And fresh from the flushed faces of the dancing halls, the voluntary vigours of the <b>business</b> <b>quarter,</b> Graham could note the pinched faces, the feeble muscles, and weary eyes {{of many of the}} latter-day workers. Such as he saw at work were noticeably inferior in physique to the few gaily dressed managers and forewomen who were directing their labours. The burly labourers of the Victorian times had followed the dray horse and all such living force producers, to extinction; the place of his costly muscles was taken by some dexterous machine. The latter-day labourer, male as well as female, was essentially a machine-minder and feeder, a servant and attendant, or an artist under direction.|$|E
60|$|Here come {{pouring down}} Park Street on the maidân {{a rush of}} broughams, neat buggies, the lightest of gigs, trim office brownberrys, shining victorias, and a {{sprinkling}} of veritable hansom cabs. In the broughams sit men in top-hats. In the other carts, young men, all very much alike, and all immaculately turned out. A fresh stream from Chowringhi joins the Park Street detachment, and the two together stream away across the maidân toward the <b>business</b> <b>quarter</b> of the city. This is Calcutta going to office--the civilians to the Government Buildings and the young men to their firms and their blocks and their wharves. Here one sees that Calcutta has the best turn-out in the Empire. Horses and traps alike are enviably perfect, and--mark the touchstone of civilization--the lamps are in their sockets! The country-bred is a rare beast here; his place is taken by the Waler,[16] and the Waler, though a ruffian at heart, {{can be made to}} look like a gentleman. It would be indecorous to applaud the winking harness, the perfectly lacquered panels, and the liveried saises. They show well in the outwardly fair roads shadowed by the Palaces.|$|E
60|$|So {{far as we}} {{can judge}} without a close and uncongenial {{scrutiny}} of statistics, that daily journey, that has governed and still to a very considerable extent governs the growth of cities, has had, and probably always will have, a maximum limit of two hours, one hour each way from sleeping place to council chamber, counter, workroom, or office stool. And taking this assumption as sound, we can state precisely the maximum area of various types of town. A pedestrian agglomeration such as we find in China, and such as most of the European towns probably were before the nineteenth century, would be swept entirely by a radius of four miles about the <b>business</b> <b>quarter</b> and industrial centre; and, under these circumstances, where the area of the feeding regions has been very large the massing of human beings has probably reached its extreme limit.[16] Of course, {{in the case of a}} navigable river, for example, the commercial centre might be elongated into a line and the circle of the city modified into an ellipse with a long diameter considerably exceeding eight miles, as, for example, in the case of Hankow.|$|E

60|$|The greater, then, was my {{surprise}} to discover {{his office in}} shabby surroundings, quite away from the <b>business</b> <b>quarter,</b> amongst a lot of hovels. Guided by a black board with white lettering, I climbed a narrow wooden staircase and entered {{a room with a}} bare floor of planks littered with bits of brown paper and wisps of packing straw. A great number of what looked like wine-cases were piled up against one of the walls. A lanky, inky, light-yellow, mulatto youth, miserably long-necked and generally recalling a sick chicken, got off a three-legged stool behind a cheap deal desk and faced me as if gone dumb with fright. I had some difficulty in persuading him to take in my name, though I could not get from him the nature of his objection. He did it at last with an almost agonised reluctance which ceased to be mysterious to me when I heard him being sworn at menacingly with savage, suppressed growls, then audibly cuffed and finally kicked out without any concealment whatever; because he came back flying head foremost through the door with a stifled shriek.|$|E

60|$|From the <b>Business</b> <b>Quarter</b> they {{presently}} {{passed by}} the running ways into a remote quarter of the city, where {{the bulk of the}} manufactures was done. On their way the platforms crossed the Thames twice, and passed in a broad viaduct across one of the great roads that entered the city from the North. In both cases his impression was swift and in both very vivid. The river was a broad wrinkled glitter of black sea water, overarched by buildings, and vanishing either way into a blackness starred with receding lights. A string of black barges passed seaward, manned by blue-clad men. The road was a long and very broad and high tunnel, along which big-wheeled machines drove noiselessly and swiftly. Here, too, the distinctive blue of the Labour Company was in abundance. The smoothness of the double tracks, the largeness and the lightness of the big pneumatic wheels in proportion to the vehicular body, struck Graham most vividly. One lank and very high carriage with longitudinal metallic rods hung with the dripping carcasses of many hundred sheep arrested his attention unduly. Abruptly the edge of the archway cut and blotted out the picture.|$|E
60|$|They {{walked out}} into the moonlit city, up and down streets that seemed very stately and fine, amidst a glitter of {{shop-window}} lights; and then, Less of their own motion than of mere error, they quitted the <b>business</b> <b>quarter,</b> and found themselves in a quiet avenue of handsome residences,--the Beacon Street of Rochester, whatever it was called. They said it was a night and a place for lovers, for none but lovers, for lovers newly plighted, and they made believe to bemoan themselves that, hold each other dear as they would, the exaltation, the thrill, the glory of their younger love was gone. Some of the houses had gardened spaces about them, from which stole, like breaths of sweetest and saddest regret, the perfume of midsummer flowers,--the despair of the rose for the bud. As they passed a certain house, a song fluttered out of the open window and ceased, the piano warbled at the final rush of fingers over its chords, and they saw her with her fingers resting lightly on the keys, and her graceful head lifted to look into his; they saw him with his arm yet stretched across to the leaves of music he had been turning, and his face lowered to meet her gaze.|$|E
60|$|The {{autonomy}} of the household has been reduced far below terrestrial conditions by hotels and clubs, {{and all sorts of}} co-operative expedients. People who do not live in hotels seem usually to live in clubs. The fairly prosperous Utopian belongs, in most cases, to one or two residential clubs of congenial men and women. These clubs usually possess in addition to furnished bedrooms more or less elaborate suites of apartments, and if a man prefers it one of these latter can be taken and furnished according to his personal taste. A pleasant boudoir, a private library and study, a private garden plot, are among the commonest of such luxuries. Devices to secure roof gardens, loggias, verandahs, and such-like open-air privacies to the more sumptuous of these apartments, give interest and variety to Utopian architecture. There are sometimes little cooking corners in these flats--as one would call them on earth--but the ordinary Utopian would no more think of a special private kitchen for his dinners than he would think of a private flour mill or dairy farm. Business, private work, and professional practice go on sometimes in the house apartments, but often in special offices in the great warren of the <b>business</b> <b>quarter.</b> A common garden, an infant school, play rooms, and a playing garden for children, are universal features of the club quadrangles.|$|E
