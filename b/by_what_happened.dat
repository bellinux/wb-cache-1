Stewie reveals to New Brian that [...] they do not like several of his traits, including how he humps the leg of one of their chairs, but New Brian replies by boasting about how he violated Rupert, Stewie's teddy bear. Stewie then brutally kills and chops up New Brian off-screen, throws his remains in the garbage and forges a suicide note. The Griffins then ultimately accept Brian back, while Stewie, traumatized <b>by</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> to Rupert, frantically washes him in the shower while comforting him.|$|E

And the answer was Microsoft BASIC because everybody had copied it and everybody was using it. So we made Microsoft the standard BASIC. National Semiconductor went to Microsoft and bought a license, they were in business that way.

2500|$|As {{customary}} {{during the}} time, any {{winner of the}} Philippine Open was entitled to be seated {{at his or her}} place presidential table while the awards dinner was being held. [...] Montes was temporarily allowed to sit at the presidential table, but was later requested to leave from his seat {{during the middle of the}} awarding ceremony. This was because of the then existing regulation of the golf club that does not allow any caddie to enter the premises of the golf clubhouse. That situation changed when an American member of the golfclub named William [...] "Bill" [...] Shaw [...] formed the Wack Wack Golf & Country Club, after being angered <b>by</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> to Montes during his awarding ceremony in 1929.

2500|$|Australia's cricket ego {{was in no}} way {{deflated}} <b>by</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> at Brisbane. All {{teams have}} their bad days, and that generally was considered sufficient excuse for Australia's collapse for 228 on a plumb pitch: as for the other collapse – Australian cricket thought does not believe in pondering long over national deficiencies on a sticky pitch. The possibility of a wet pitch in Brisbane was suggested by other Tests there and the weather preceding the game. There was too many clouds about in Brisbane for the city to miss rain for a whole week. Old women of both sexes [...] were blaming our weather upsets on the atomic bomb experiment carried out by the Americans on Bikini Atoll, to our north... and so there was no national caterwauling over Australia's loss of face at Brisbane. Few stopped to think that had Australia lost the toss, they would have certainly have lost the Test.|$|E
2500|$|Farmiga later {{withdrew from}} the project as she had become {{pregnant}} with her second child, and Riseborough replaced her. After Farmiga had declined the project, Madonna looked into many actresses, before zeroing on Riseborough, whom she had seen as a young Margaret Thatcher in the BBC film The Long Walk to Finchley. Madonna explained her choice: [...] "I {{was looking for a}} certain quality: something fragile, androgynous and yet feminine in a really old-fashioned way. When I saw Andrea, I knew immediately she was the one." [...] Cornish commented on her role as Winthrop, [...] "Madonna is a strong, independent woman who doesn't need a man to define her– and that's admirable. She's studied every aspect of what happened with Wallis Simpson and Edward VIII. [...] It's a fascinating insight into class and romance. Madonna's created a contemporary woman—who I will play—called Wally, who is fascinated <b>by</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> to Mrs. Simpson." [...] Madonna's daughter Lourdes was offered a part, but Madonna decided against the idea. However, she later allowed Lourdes to appear for a minor role in the film. The part she played was later confirmed by Cornish in an interview in March 2011 as the younger self of her character Wally Winthrop.|$|E

2500|$|On 17 September 2004, radical Chechen guerilla {{commander}} Shamil Basayev, at {{this time}} operating autonomously {{from the rest of}} the North Caucasian rebel movement, issued a statement claiming responsibility for the Beslan school siege, which was strikingly similar to the Chechen raid on Budyonnovsk in 1995 and the Moscow theatre crisis in 2002, incidents in which hundreds of Russian civilians were held hostage by the Chechen rebels led by Basayev. Basayev said his Riyadus-Salikhin [...] "martyr battalion" [...] had carried out the attack and also claimed responsibility for a series of terrorist bombings in Russia in the weeks before Beslan crisis. He said that he originally planned to seize at least one school in either Moscow or Saint Petersburg, but lack of funds forced him to pick North Ossetia, [...] "the Russian garrison in the North Caucasus". Basayev blamed the Russian authorities for [...] "a terrible tragedy" [...] in Beslan. Basayev claimed that he had miscalculated the Kremlin's determination to end the crisis by all means possible. He said he was [...] "cruelly mistaken" [...] and that he was [...] "not delighted <b>by</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> there", but also added to be [...] "planning more Beslan-type operations in the future because we are forced to do so." [...] However, it was the last major act of terrorism in Russia until 2009, as Basayev was soon persuaded to give up indiscriminate attacks by the new rebel leader Abdul-Halim Sadulayev, who made Basayev his second-in-command but banned hostage taking, kidnapping for ransom, and operations specifically targeting civilians.|$|E
