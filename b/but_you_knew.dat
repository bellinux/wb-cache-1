The World Cup was difficult, {{if not more}} difficult, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> it was {{all going to be}} over in a day. This just took turn after turn after turn over the four days' duration, plus your rained out day — it was a real tough game of cricket to play for every body.|$|E
2500|$|Wolverine {{was tough}} for Jackman to portray {{because he had}} few lines, {{but a lot of}} emotion to convey in them. To prepare, he watched Clint Eastwood in the Dirty Harry movies and Mel Gibson in Road Warrior. [...] "Here were guys who had {{relatively}} little dialogue, like Wolverine had, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> and felt everything. I'm not normally one to copy, but I wanted to see how these guys achieved it." [...] Jackman was adamant about doing his own stunts for the movie. [...] "We worked a lot on the movement style of Wolverine, and I studied some martial arts. I watched a lot of Mike Tyson fights, especially his early fights. There's something about his style, the animal rage, that seemed right for Wolverine. I kept saying to the writers, 'Don't give me long, choreographed fights for the sake of it. Don't make the fights pretty." [...] Jackman also had to get used to wearing Wolverine's claws. [...] "Every day in my living room, I'd just walk around with those claws, to get used to them. I've got scars on one leg, punctures straight through the cheek, on my forehead. I'm a bit clumsy. I'm lucky I didn't tell them that when I auditioned." ...|$|E

"Suppose," [...] said Shoeblossom to Barry, as {{they were}} walking over to school on the morning {{following}} the day on which Milton's study had passed through {{the hands of the}} League, [...] "suppose you thought somebody had done something, but you weren't quite certain who, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> it was some one, what would you do?" ...|$|E

She ain't your wife no more than she's mine. You've no {{business}} with her; and that you knew when you took her away from St. Louis. You may, or you mayn't, have been fooled by some one down in Texas when you went back and married her in all that hurry. <b>But</b> <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> {{what you were doing}} well enough when you took her away.

60|$|My dearest Madame Braun,--If {{you have}} not heard from me before, {{it has not been}} that I have not thought of you anxiously and tenderly, but I had the idea that so many must be {{thinking}} of you, and saying to you with sad faces 'they were sorry,' that I kept away, not to be the one too many. It seems so vain when we sympathise with a suffering friend. And yet it is something--oh yes, I have felt that! <b>But</b> <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> I must feel for you, if I teased you with words or not; and I, for my part, hearing of you from others, felt shy, as I say, till I heard you were better, of writing to you myself. And you are feeling better, Mrs. Jameson tells me, and are somewhat more cheerful about your state. I thank God for this good news....|$|E
6000|$|... "The friend only {{lived to}} reach home {{and tell the}} story. It killed the wife, and she died, imploring the old priest to see her child righted and its father's name secured to it. He promised; but he was poor, the child was a frail baby, and he waited. Years passed, and when the child {{was old enough to}} ask for its parents and demand its due, the proofs of the {{marriage}} were lost, and nothing remained but a ring, a bit of writing, and the name. The priest was very old, had neither friends, money, nor proofs to help him; but I was strong and hopeful, and though a mere boy I resolved to do the work. I made my way to England, to Trevlyn Hall, and by various stratagems (among which, I am ashamed to say, were false keys and feigned sleepwalking) I collected many proofs, but nothing which would satisfy a court, for no one <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> where Sir Richard's confession was. I searched every nook and corner of the Hall, but in vain, and began to despair, when news of the death of Father Cosmo recalled me to Italy; for Helen was left to my care then. The old man had faithfully recorded the facts and left witnesses to prove the truth of his story; but for four years I never used it, never made any effort to secure the title or estates." ...|$|E

6000|$|When I {{was a boy}} {{my uncle}} and his big boys hunted with the rifle, the {{youngest}} boy Fred and I with a shotgun--a small single-barrelled shotgun which was properly suited to our size and strength; it was not much heavier than a broom. We carried it turn about, half an hour at a time. I {{was not able to}} hit anything with it, but I liked to try. Fred and I hunted feathered small game, the others hunted deer, squirrels, wild turkeys, and such things. My uncle and the big boys were good shots. They killed hawks and wild geese and such like on the wing; and they didn't wound or kill squirrels, they stunned them. When the dogs treed a squirrel, the squirrel would scamper aloft and run out on a limb and flatten himself along it, hoping to make himself invisible in that way--and not quite succeeding. You could see his wee little ears sticking up. You couldn't see his nose, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> where it was. Then the hunter, despising a [...] "rest" [...] for his rifle, stood up and took offhand aim at the limb and sent a bullet into it immediately under the squirrel's nose, and down tumbled the animal, unwounded, but unconscious; the dogs gave him a shake and he was dead. Sometimes when the distance was great and the wind not accurately allowed for, the bullet would hit the squirrel's head; the dogs could do as they pleased with that one--the hunter's pride was hurt, and he wouldn't allow it to go into the gamebag.|$|E
6000|$|For it had {{now come}} to this, {{that the end of}} each day brought not sleep and dreams, but waking visions. Night by night, from my dry grass bed I beheld Nuflo sitting in his old doubled-up posture, his big brown feet close to the white ashes--sitting silent and miserable. I pitied him; I owed him hospitality; but it seemed {{intolerable}} that he should be there. It was better to shut my eyes; for then Rima's arms would be round my neck; the silky mist of her hair against my face, her flowery breath mixing with my breath. What a luminous face was hers! Even with closeshut eyes I could see it vividly, the translucent skin showing the radiant rose beneath, the lustrous eyes, spiritual and passionate, dark as purple wine under their dark lashes. Then my eyes would open wide. No Rima in my arms! But over there, a little way back from the fire, just beyond where old Nuflo had sat brooding a few minutes ago, Rima would be standing, still and pale and unspeakably sad. Why does she come to me from the outside darkness to stand there talking to me, yet never once lifting her mournful eyes to mine? [...] "Do not believe it, Abel; no, that was only a phantom of your brain, the What-I-was that you remember so well. For do you not see that when I come she fades away and is nothing? Not that--do not ask it. I know that I once refused to look into your eyes, and afterwards, in the cave at Riolama, I looked long and was happy--unspeakably happy! But now--oh, you do not know what you ask; you do not know the sorrow that has come into mine; that if you once beheld it, for very sorrow you would die. And you must live. But I will wait patiently, and we shall be together in the end, and see each other without disguise. Nothing shall divide us. Only wish not for it soon; think not that death will ease your pain, and seek it not. Austerities? Good works? Prayers? They are not seen; they are not heard, they are less-than nothing, and there is no intercession. I did not know it then, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> it. Your life was your own; you are not saved nor judged! acquit yourself--undo that which you have done, which Heaven cannot undo--and Heaven will say no word nor will I. You cannot, Abel, you cannot. That which you have done is done, and yours must be the penalty and the sorrow--yours and mine--yours and mine--yours and mine." ...|$|E
