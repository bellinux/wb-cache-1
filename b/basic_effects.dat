This paper reviews research on one well documented group motivation gain phenomenon, where group members are more highly motivated than comparable individual performers – the Köhler motivation gain <b>effect.</b> The <b>basic</b> <b>effect</b> is attributed to two psychological mechanisms, one involving upward social comparisons and a second involving the indispensability of group members’ efforts. In addition to summarizing research on the discovery and causes of the <b>basic</b> <b>effect,</b> this review identifies probable moderators of each contributing causal mechanism.

However, what the other party feels might be just as important, as group emotions are known to affect processes both at the group and the personal levels.When it comes to negotiations, trust in the other party is a necessary condition for its emotion to affect, and visibility enhances the effect.Emotions contribute to negotiation processes by signaling what one feels and thinks and can thus prevent the other party from engaging in destructive behaviors and to indicate what steps should be taken next: PA signals to keep in the same way, while NA points that mental or behavioral adjustments are needed.Partner's emotions can have two <b>basic</b> <b>effects</b> on negotiator's emotions and behavior: mimetic/ reciprocal or complementary.

5000|$|When more sulfur {{containing}} amino acids, methionine and cystine, {{are consumed}} than {{the body can}} use for growth and repair, they are broken down yielding sulfate, or sulfuric acid among other products. Animal foods such as meat, dairy, and eggs are high in protein and “dietary animal protein intake is highly correlated with renal net acid excretion”. Research {{dating back to the}} early 1900s has shown correlations between high protein diets and increased acid excretion. One measure of the acidic or <b>basic</b> <b>effects</b> foods have in the body is Potential Renal Acid Load (PRAL). Cheeses with protein content of 15 g protein/100g or higher have a high PRAL value of 23.6 mEq/100 g edible portion. Meats, fish, other cheeses and flour or noodles all have a PRAL around 8.0 mEq/100 g edible portion, where fruits and vegetables actually have a negative PRAL. [...] In healthy adults, bone is undergoing constant repair and renewal. New bone is deposited by osteoblast cells and resorbed or destroyed by osteoclast cells. This addition and subtraction of bone usually yields no net change in the overall mass of the skeleton, but the turnover process can be significantly affected by pH.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We define an enriched effect {{calculus}} {{by extending}} a type theory for computational effects with primitives from linear logic. The new calculus provides a formalism for expressing linear aspects of computational effects; for example, the linear usage of imperative {{features such as}} state and/or continuations. Our main syntactic result is the conservativity of the enriched effect calculus over a <b>basic</b> <b>effect</b> calculus without linear primitives (closely related to Moggi’s computational metalanguage, Filinski’s effect PCF and Levy’s call-by-push-value). The proof of this syntactic theorem makes essential use of a category-theoretic semantics, whose study forms {{the second half of}} the paper. Our semantic results include soundness, completeness, the initiality of a syntactic model, and an embedding theorem: every model of the <b>basic</b> <b>effect</b> calculus fully embeds in a model of the enriched calculus. The latter means that our enriched effect calculus is applicable to arbitrary computational effects, answering in the positive a question of Benton and Wadler (LICS 1996). ...|$|R
