40|$|The {{non-contacting}} finger seal is {{an advanced}} seal concept with potential to reduce {{specific fuel consumption}} in gas turbine engines by 2 to 3 with little to no wear of the seal or rotor. Static performance tests and <b>bind-up</b> tests of eight different non-contacting finger seal configurations were conducted in air at pressure differentials up to 689. 4 kPa and temperatures up to 922 K. Four of the seals tested were designed to have lift pads concentric to a herringbone-grooved rotor which generates hydrodynamic lift when rotating. The remaining seals were tested with a smooth rotor; one seal had a circumferential taper and one had an axial taper on the lift pad inner diameter to create hydrodynamic lift during rotation. The effects of the aft finger axial thickness and of the forward finger inner diameter on leakage performance were investigated as well and compared to analytical predictions...|$|E
