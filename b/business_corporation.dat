25|$|It is {{interesting}} to note that, depending on your political point of view, such government payments for offsetting the housing charge could be considered a subsidy of the low-income members, or a contractual business arrangement {{between the government and the}} co-op, which helps to stabilize revenue to the co-op in exchange for accomplishing a social goal for the government for a specific period. This dichotomy is typical of the fact that a housing co-op is somewhere between a private <b>business</b> <b>corporation</b> and a social agency, and where one places it depends on one's viewpoint—and the collective viewpoint of each housing co-op. Some observers would now simply categorize these co-op as a form of social enterprise.|$|E

Also {{established}} in 1903, the Briarcliff Manor Fire Department was founded on February 10 by Frederick C. Messinger from Briarcliff Manor's first fire company, the 1901 Briarcliff Steamer Company No. 1. The department's first fire engine was white, which Messinger thought more visible than the conventional red in a village without street lights, and the village's engines remain white. The first twenty-nine street lights, all electric, were installed in 1904, and Scarborough was incorporated into Briarcliff Manor in 1906. Law largely developed his land as a <b>business</b> <b>corporation</b> until 1907, when Briarcliff Farms moved to Pine Plains, New York, and Law began developing Briarcliff Manor as a municipal corporation instead.|$|E

The group's self-belief that they could do anything {{led to the formation of}} a new multimedia <b>business</b> <b>corporation</b> Apple Corps, an enterprise that drained the group financially with a series of unsuccessful projects. The open-ended studio time led to a new way of working out songs. Instead of tightly rehearsing a backing track, as had happened in previous sessions, the group would simply record all the rehearsals and jamming, then add overdubs to the best take. Harrison's song [...] "Not Guilty" [...] was left off the album despite recording 102 takes.|$|E

It had no judicial powers and could not issue binding regulations but had to establish its legitimacy through its reports and recommendations. It soon gained a reputation for even handedness, criticising all sides in often trenchant terms. The rivalry between the ANC and IFP was blamed for being [...] "the primary cause" [...] of violence and Goldstone urged both sides to [...] "abandon violence and intimidation as political weapons". The government's security forces {{were found to have}} been involved in numerous abuses of human rights, though Goldstone rejected Nelson Mandela's claims that President de Klerk was personally involved and described such suggestions as [...] "unwise, unfair and dangerous". One of Goldstone's most important findings was the revelation in November 1992 that a secret military intelligence unit of the South African Defence Force was working to sabotage the ANC while posing as a legitimate <b>business</b> <b>corporation.</b> The ensuing scandal led to De Klerk purging the army and intelligence services.|$|E

He also built Dysart House as a guest house in 1897, named after Dysart House in Scotland. By 1902, Law had invested $2.5million ($ in [...] ) in the village. In 1906, he replaced Briarcliff Manor's railroad station with the present-day public library. His employees at Briarcliff Farms moved into the village in its early years, and Law held some of their mortgages. At the time, New York State required a population density of at least 300 per square mile for incorporation as a village. A proposition {{was presented to the}} supervisors of Mount Pleasant and Ossining on October 8, 1902; it requested that the area, which had 640 acres with a population of 381, be incorporated as the Village of Briarcliff Manor. The village was incorporated on November 21, 1902. At the time, Law owned all but two small parcels of the village, and he employed 100 of its residents. Law largely developed his Briarcliff Manor property as a <b>business</b> <b>corporation</b> until 1907, when he purchased [...] for Briarcliff Farms in Pine Plains, New York; he then began developing his properties for houses, churches, and schools instead. In 1909, Law formed the Briarcliff Lodge Association to run the hotel, and the Briarcliff Realty Company to sell the original Briarcliff Farms property. His son, Henry, presided over the realty company until 1936. In 1908, during the Briarcliff Manor-sponsored First American International Road Race, Law donated and presented the Briarcliff Trophy, valued at over $10,000 ($ in [...] ). In 1918, Walter Law sold his Briarcliff Farms land in Pine Plains.|$|E
