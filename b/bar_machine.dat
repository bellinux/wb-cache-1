Bersten describes the device as [...] "the first Italian <b>bar</b> <b>machine</b> that controlled the supply of steam and water separately through the coffee" [...] and Moriondo as [...] "one of the earliest discoverers of the expresso sic machine."

5000|$|Armament {{was fairly}} heavy for this {{lightweight}} vehicle, giving the T-13 tank destroyer, a very nasty bite. Main armament was the 47 mm Model 1931 anti-tank gun, which fired 1.52 kg armor-piercing shells and could penetrate 47 mm of armor plating {{from a distance}} of 300 m, for its time an impressive performance. The maximum firing range of the gun was 2000 m, and, as both armor-piercing and high-explosive rounds were available, the gun had a useful anti-infantry capability as well. The secondary armament consisted of a single turret-mounted light FN built M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle, in essence a Belgian license-built Browning <b>BAR</b> <b>machine</b> gun in a special 7.65x53mm [...] "Belgian Mauser calibre" [...] instead of the American [...]30. The machine gun could fire 500-650 rounds per minute.|$|E
5000|$|Angelo Moriondo's Italian {{patent for}} a steam-driven [...] "instantaneous" [...] coffee {{beverage}} making device, which was registered in Turin in 1884 (No. 33/256), is notable. Author Ian Bersten, whose history of coffee brewers is cited below, {{claims to have}} been the first to discover Moriondo's patent. Bersten describes the device as [...] "almost certainly the first Italian <b>bar</b> <b>machine</b> that controlled the supply of steam and water separately through the coffee" [...] and Moriondo as [...] "certainly one of the earliest discoverers of the expresso [...] machine, if not the earliest." [...] Unlike true espresso machines, it was a bulk brewer, and did not brew coffee for the individual customer. Seventeen years later, in 1901, Luigi Bezzera, from Milan, came up with a number of improvements to the espresso machine. He patented a number of these, the first of which was applied for on the 19th of December 1901. It was titled [...] "Innovations in the machinery to prepare and immediately serve coffee beverage" [...] (Patent No. 153/94, 61707, granted on the 5 June 1902). In 1905, the patent was bought by Desiderio Pavoni, who founded the La Pavoni company and began to produce the machine industrially (one a day) in a small workshop in Via Parini in Milan.|$|E

5000|$|After the Polish-Bolshevik War, in 1923 a {{competition}} was opened for a new, standard {{light machine gun}} for the Polish army that was to replace all previously used types of LMG. The competition ended without a winner and the following year the Polish Ministry of War purchased 12 specimens of the M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle, Lewis gun ("Lewis wz. 1923") and Hotchkiss M1909 Benét-Mercié each. Testing proved {{the superiority of the}} American construction, and during the 1925 competition a Belgian FN-made Browning was chosen. Although extensive tests were continued, the Polish army ordered a series of Belgian-made <b>BAR</b> <b>machine</b> guns, modified to better suit the Polish needs. The modifications included changing the round from [...]30-06 Springfield to standard Polish 7.92×57mm Mauser), the construction of a bipod and mounting and the iron sights (peephole changed to v-notch type). The barrel was lengthened for greater accuracy and a pistol grip was added for easier aiming. Apart from the 10,000 pieces ordered from Fabrique Nationale, Poland also bought a licence to construct the weapon at home. The first wz.28 LMGs were officially commissioned in 1927 and were officially named 7,92 mm rkm Browning wz. 1928, which is a Polish designation for 7.92 mm hand-held machine gun of Browning mark 1928.|$|E
5000|$|The battle {{begins with}} 5 relaxed French Foreign Legionnaires milling about at their campsite. Not far away, {{a squad of}} 5 Gurkhas are {{preparing}} an ambush. A legionnaire sentry relieves his fellow guardsman as the lead Gurkha cuts {{a hole in the}} legion's barbed wire fence using wire snips. The sentry watches along the perimeter of the camp site, unaware of the Gurkhas' position. A Gurkha takes aim with his Lee-Enfield No. 4 and fires, alerting the rest of the legion. The legion immediately scramble for defensive positions, firing their MAS-36 rifles and <b>BAR</b> <b>machine</b> guns while the Gurkhas fire back with their Lee-Enfields and Bren machine guns. As his position begins to crumble, the sentry attempts to leave his sandbag cover, but is shot down in the crossfire. An African legionnaire quickly re-cocks his bolt action MAS and fires, killing a Gurkha. He quickly fires off one more shot before running back for cover behind sandbags. As the rest of the small legion falls back, the Gurkhas start to advance, taking position in front of the sandbags and continuing to lay down covering fire as two Gurkhas run up through the camp, dodging small artillery fire and jumping over the barbed wire barricade. A Gurkha jumps out of cover and briefly stops to clear a jam in his Bren machine gun, but is shot by a legionnaire who gets up from his position and fires his BAR at the Gurkha. As soon as he's visible, a Gurkha behind a nearby tree shoots him in the head with his Lee-Enfield rifle. While the other Gurkhas inspect the tents for any other legionnaires, the African legionnaire pops out of cover behind sandbags and shoots one of the wandering Gurkhas in the head. The other Gurkha sniper quickly retaliates by shooting him in the head while he's still standing. As the Gurkhas draw closer to the 2 remaining legionnaires, the lead legionnaire jumps out of cover and fires his MAS at the lead Gurkha. The Gurkha takes cover behind a tent as the 2 legionnaires unload the rest of their ammo at the retreating Gurkhas. As they retreat, the lead Gurkha gestures to his partner to split up as the 2 legionnaires come charging at them. Nearby, the other legionnaire cautiously searches for his prey, aiming his rifle. The lead Gurkha sneaks up behind him and brings his kukri blade down, cutting through the legionnaire's kepi and into his skull. The other Gurkha, armed with his kukri, is also brought down from behind as the lead legionnaire grabs him from behind and stabs him in the neck with his Callimus knife. The two leaders soon confront each other near a hillside, knives in hand as a knife fight showdown ensues. Both leaders step to each other, daring the other to attack. As soon as they come closer to each other, they begin to swing at each other, with the Gurkha scoring the first strike with a backhanded cut across the left cheek. The Gurkha goes in for a follow-up strike, but the legionnaire counters with a strike across the right cheek that causes the Gurkha to stumble down the hillside. As soon as he regains his balance, the legionnaire goes in for a strike and follows up with a thrust. The Gurkha recovers and moves out of the way, causing the legionnaire's Callimus to get stuck in a log that was behind the Gurkha. As the legionnaire tries to free his knife, the Gurkha takes the opportunity to slash his opponent diagonally across the back and kick him. The legionnaire frees his knife and swings his knife 180 degrees, causing the Gurkha to jump back. The Gurkha slashes the legionnaire twice across the face. The legionnaire goes in for a thrust attack in desperation, but the Gurkha grabs his arm and stops him. He then swings his knife, slashing through the legionnaire's throat. As the legionnaire lies on the ground drawing his last breath, the Gurkha raises his arms and bloodied kukri into the air, shouting [...] "Ayo Gurkhali!" [...] (The Gurkhas are here!) in victory.|$|E

40|$|Espresso {{coffee is}} the most popular choice for Italian coffee consumers. It has been {{estimated}} that every day, in the world, over of 50 million of Espresso cups are taken. As a consequence of this success, a large number of devices to make Espresso have been developed. In this scenario, a new device has been recently developed and patented (Eu. Patent 06 023 798. 9; US 2010 / 0034942 A 1). This brew method, named “Caffè Firenze”, uses a sealed extraction chamber, where water and gas provides pressure higher than the other extraction methods. Three main parts compose the apparatus: the gas source, the extraction chamber and the heat exchanger. The gas source provides the pressured gas required to raise the pressure of the system. The extraction chamber is made with chrome-brass and accessorized with two heating glow plugs. Many are the factors affecting Espresso quality: it is known that, coffee type, roasting conditions and degree, grinding and storage strongly affect the obtained brew. Also, several studies have been carried out on the effect of the setting parameters on quality, for example water pressure, water temperature, and brew time. Among the characteristics that determine Espresso quality, the main attribute for the visual analysis is, without doubts, the foam, also called “crema”. Indeed, height, aspect, and persistency of foam are features much appreciates by consumers. Two distinguish Espresso foam parameters are the persistency and foam index. Equipping a commercial <b>bar</b> <b>machine</b> with the new designed extraction chamber makes feasible the comparison between the traditional way to brew Espresso and the new device. The comparison was made holding the previous mentioned conditions, and differences were evaluated in terms of physical parameters and aromatic profiles. Caffè Firenze shows pronounced differences compared with traditional Espresso in term of foam-related parameters. Also, the new extraction device produces coffees with higher values of body-related parameters, such density and viscosity. The two kinds of Espressos are perceived different at visual analysis and taste by a panel test...|$|E

The {{focus of the}} in vitro study is to identify a jointing procedure for InCeram which {{may be used for}} producing full-ceramic fixed-partial-denture frameworks. METHODS. Six groups (n= 15) of machined and jointed InCeram-Alumina (T 1 -T 5) and InCeram-Zirconia (T 6) bars (3 x 4 x 13 mm(3)), respectively, were examined using a 3 -point-bending test. InCeram-Alumina joint-free controls were: machined (C 1), slip cast (C 2, C 3) and cut from the block (C 4) <b>bars.</b> <b>Machined</b> joint-free InCeram-Zirconia <b>bars</b> were used as controls (C 5). InCeram-Alumina slip was used for jointing T 1 -T 5 and InCeram-Zirconia slip for bars T 6. Bars were jointed in groups T 1 and T 2 using butt joint (S 1), in T 3 and T 4 oblique (S 2, S 3) and in T 5 and T 6 rounded (S 4) joint shapes. RESULTS. Two-way analysis of variance showed significant differences between materials (p 0. 05) were found between machined/jointed InCeram-Zirconia (475 (54) MPa, T 6), joint-free InCeram-Alumina slip cast (498 (125) MPa, C 2) and joint-free InCeram-Alumina <b>machined</b> <b>bars</b> (511 (59) MPa, C 1).

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{focuses on}} {{comparing}} the results using different wavelets {{for the detection}} of broken rotor <b>bars</b> in induction <b>machines,</b> operating under transient conditions. In Fourier analysis the basis functions are complex exponentials producing the same results for a particular waveform being analyzed. However in wavelet analysis the basis functions could be any permissible wavelets and the results produced are unique to the selected wavelet. Some wavelets are more efficient at encoding, denoising, compressing, decomposing and reconstructing signals than others. It is therefore desirable to select a wavelet that produces the best results for the signal being analyzed. The results show that using higher order wavelets improve the ability to detect broken rotor <b>bars</b> in induction <b>machines</b> operating under transient conditions. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{fracture}} strength of silicon carbide (SiC) plate deposits produced by Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) was determined from room-temperature to 1500 C using a standard 4 -point flexural test method (ASTM Cl 161). CVD SiC materials produced by two different manufacturers are {{shown to have}} only slightly different flexural strength values, which appear to result from differences in microstructure. Although CVD deposition of SiC results in a textured grain structure, the flexural strength was shown to be independent of the CVD growth direction. The orientation of machining marks was shown {{to have the most}} significant influence on flexural strength, as expected. The {{fracture strength}} of tubular forms of SiC produced by CVD deposition directly onto a mandrel was comparable to flexural <b>bars</b> <b>machined</b> from a plate deposit. The tubular (o-ring) specimens were much smaller in volume than the flexural bars, and higher strength values are predicted based on Weibull statistical theory for the o-ring specimens. Differences in microstructure between the plate deposits and deposits made on a mandrel result in different flaw distributions and comparable strength values for the flexural bar and o-ring specimens. These results indicate that compression testing of o-rings provides a more accurate strength measurement for tubular product forms of SiC due to more representative flaw distributions...|$|R
