40|$|Bunched <b>beam</b> <b>signals</b> from button-style Beam-Position Monitor (BMP) {{electrodes}} {{can have}} spectral content up to 20 - 30 GHz {{and structure of}} narrow impulsive trains in time-domain. Multi-bunch feedback systems require receivers <b>to</b> process such <b>beam</b> <b>signals</b> and generate X, Y, and Z <b>beam</b> motion <b>signals.</b> <b>To</b> realistically test these receivers, we have developed a 4 -bunch programmable impulse generator, which mimics the signals from a multi-bunch beam. Based on step-recovery diode techniques, this simulator produces modulated 100 -ps impulse signals. The programmable nature of the system allows us to mimic Betatron and Synchrotron signals from 4 independent bunches with adjustable beam spacing from 1 to 8 ns. Moreover, we can observe nonlinear effects and study the noise floor and {{the resolution of the}} receiver. This paper presents the design of the system and shows typical achieved results...|$|R

5000|$|The {{design is}} {{most widely used}} for small {{parabolic}} antennas or [...] "mini-dishes", such as common [...] home satellite television dishes, where the feed structure is large enough {{in relation to the}} dish to block a significant proportion of the signal. Another application is on satellites, particularly the direct broadcast satellites which use parabolic dishes <b>to</b> <b>beam</b> television <b>signals</b> <b>to</b> homes on Earth. Because of the limited transmitter power provided by their solar cells, satellite antennas must function as efficiently as possible. The offset design is also widely used in radar antennas. These must collect as much signal as possible in order to detect faint return signals from faraway targets.|$|R

40|$|Animal {{subjects}} Male Long-Evans rats weighing 350 - 450 g at {{the time}} of surgery were used for the present study. Rats were housed in a 12 -hour reversed dark-light cycle and tested during the dark period.

The SINR feedback is quantized with a different number of bits, and the performance in terms of throughput achieved with a score-based scheduler is evaluated.

50|$|The Utah State Legislature {{formally}} established UEN in 1989, but {{the statewide}} collaboration {{of public education}} and higher education started {{more than two decades}} earlier when KUED-Channel 7 signed on the air in 1958. The station built translator towers <b>to</b> <b>beam</b> its <b>signal</b> <b>to</b> remote communities, and eventually the station placed analog microwave equipment on some of those towers enabling two-way teleconferencing for education and government. The system was initially named SETOC (State Educational Technical Operations Center), renamed as EDNET and is now UEN IVC (Interactive Video Conferencing). In December 1986, KULC-Channel 9 (now UEN-TV) started broadcasting as Utah’s Learning Channel, and in 1994 UEN started UtahLINK, the Internet component of the Network.

UEN-TV and sister station KUED were broadcasting digitally by June 2012, but experiments in statewide digital broadcasting were underway as early as 2004.|$|R
40|$|Emission at the Na D lines has {{previously}} been observed from the intersection of crossed effusive beams of K and NaCl irradiated by a dye laser at wavelengths form 590 nm to 735 nm. The three <b>beam</b> <b>signal</b> is attributed <b>to</b> direct photoexcitation of KClNa transition region species. Further interpretation of these experiments is hampered, however, by broad translational and internal energy distributions of reacting partners. Supersonic beams of K and NaCl, both seeded in argon, were developed {{in order to reduce}} the distribution of translational and internal energies. It was hoped that insight into the reaction dynamics of the K+NaCl system would be revealed by the difference in collision energy between crossed effusive beams and crossed seeded beams. In addition, the rotational broadening of the K 2 B 1 Π u-X 1 Σ g+ spectrum collapses on cooling and therefore "artifact-clean" frequencies could be probed by the laser. Extensive characterization studies of the seeded beam sources were carried out. Mean velocities of K and NaCl were measured to be 1. 3 × 105 and 1. 1 × 105 cm/sec, respectively. Measurements of the rotational and vibrational energy distributions of K 2 present in the potassium beam reveal a rotational temperature of 12 ± 1 ∘K and vibrational temperature of 77 ± 13 ∘K. Time of flight experiments demonstrate a translational temperature for NaCl and K beams of 170 ∘K and 12 ∘K, respectively. Significant three beam emission at the 589. 0 nm Na D line is observed at the intersection of crossed seeded reagent beams of K and NaCl irradiated by a dye laser from 610 nm to 750 nm. This three <b>beam</b> <b>signal</b> is comparable <b>to</b> that previously observed with effusive sources. However, contrary to expectations the photoluminescence of the K beam at 589. 0 nm when laser excited in the region 610 - 750 nm was much larger than for an effusive source. The seeded source potassium photoluminescence at 589. 0 nm is an order of magnitude larger than the seeded source three <b>beam</b> <b>signal.</b> In contrast, the three <b>beam</b> <b>signal</b> with an effusive K beam is substantially the largest signal in that system. Nevertheless, the narrow energy distribution of these supersonic sources and their ability to change the collision energy makes them very useful for further probing of the KClNa transition region species...|$|R

40|$|Terrain-scattered {{interference}} (TSI), that is, jammer signals {{reflected on}} the earth's surface, is a significant problem to military airborne radar. In auxiliary beam TSI suppression, the TSI in the main radar beam is estimated by a single or several auxiliary beams and is subtracted from the main <b>beam</b> channel. The <b>signal</b> <b>to</b> subtract is the auxiliary <b>beam</b> <b>signals</b> fed through {{an estimate of the}} ‘reflection system’, which describes scattering on the surface. The authors first present results on the structure of this TSI suppression, on the estimation of the reflection system and {{on the quality of the}} estimate. Then the authors derive theoretical expressions for the signal-to-interference plus noise ratio (SINR) and the remaining TSI power for a single auxiliary beam. Since the SINR is directly connected to the radar performance, it can be seen what factors affect the performance and how. It was noted that when the estimated reflection system is missing one or more delays of the true system, the TSI filter cannot suppress the TSI signal completely. This phenomenon, which is called ‘TSI leakage’, has a very large impact on the performance. The SINR cannot be kept constant. Instead, an ‘SINR improvement’ can be defined...|$|R

40|$|There {{are three}} {{goals in the}} {{accurate}} nonlinear diagnosis of a storage ring. First, the beam must be moved to am-plitudes many times the natural beam size. Second, strong and long lasting signals must be generated. Third, the mea-surement technique should be non-destructive. Conventionally, a single turn kick moves the beam to large amplitudes, and turn–by–turn data are recorded from multiple beam position monitors (BPMs) [1 - 6]. Unfortu-nately, tune spread across the beam causes the center of charge <b>beam</b> <b>signal</b> <b>to</b> “decohere ” on a time scale often less than 100 turns. Filamentation also permanently destroys the beam emittance (in a hadron ring). Thus, the “strong single turn kick ” technique successfully achieves {{only one out of}} the three goals. AC dipole techniques can achieve all three. Adiabatically excited AC dipoles slowly move the beam out to large amplitudes. The coherent signals then recorded last arbitrarily long. The beam maintains its orig-inal emittance if the AC dipoles are also turned off adiabat-ically, ready for further use. The AGS already uses an RF dipole to accelerate polar-ized proton beams through depolarizing resonances with minimal polarization loss [7]. Similar AC dipoles will be installed in the horizontal and vertical planes of both rings in RHIC [8]. The RHIC AC dipoles will also be used as spin flippers, and to measure linear optical functions [9]. 1 LINEAR MOTION Horizontal motion is described using complex phasors z x 0 + i x = a ei (1) so that the unperturbed one turn motion is just zt+ 1 = R zt (2) where R = exp(i 2 QX). Here QX is the betatron tune, and the normalized coordinates x and x 0 both have the di-mensions of length. An AC dipole just after the reference point gives a real normalized angular kick on turn t of zt = x 0 = cos(2 QDt + 0) (3) where QD is the drive tune and 0 is the initial phase. The AC dipole strength is = (BL=(B)) D, where BL is the integrated field amplitude, (B) is the rigidity, and D is the Twiss function at the dipole. If z = z 0 just before the first dipole kick, then the net displacement phasor on turn T is zT = RT z 0 +(RT z 0 +RT− 1 z 1 +R 1 zT− 1) (4) Work supported by the DoE...|$|R
