50|$|I hate Valentino! All men hate Valentino. I hate his oriental optics; I hate {{his classic}} nose; I hate his Roman face; I hate his smile; I hate his glistening teeth; I hate his patent leather hair; I hate his Svengali glare; I hate him <b>because</b> <b>he</b> dances too well; I hate him <b>because</b> <b>he's</b> a slicker; I hate him <b>because</b> <b>he's</b> the great lover of the screen; I hate him <b>because</b> <b>he's</b> an embezzeler of hearts; I hate him <b>because</b> <b>he's</b> too apt {{in the art}} of osculation; I hate him <b>because</b> <b>he's</b> leading man for Gloria Swanson; I hate him <b>because</b> <b>he's</b> too good looking.|$|R
60|$|They {{looked upon}} him, as {{painters}} often do writers, with contempt <b>because</b> <b>he</b> was a layman, with tolerance <b>because</b> <b>he</b> practised an art, and with awe <b>because</b> <b>he</b> used a medium in which themselves felt ill-at-ease.|$|R
60|$|Why? <b>Because</b> <b>he</b> {{is looking}} on, not to torment, but to help. <b>Because</b> <b>he</b> loves us {{better than we}} love ourselves. <b>Because</b> <b>he</b> is more anxious {{for us to get}} safely through this world than we are ourselves.|$|R
50|$|<b>He</b> managed <b>C.A.</b> Pe√±arol in 1980.|$|R
60|$|<b>Because</b> <b>he</b> had {{forgotten}} and <b>because</b> <b>he</b> {{remembered that he}} had reminded himself twice not to forget.|$|R
50|$|In September 2015, <b>he</b> joined <b>CA</b> Bastia.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> is {{interesting}} <b>because</b> <b>he</b> is not pleasing; <b>because</b> <b>he</b> has bad habits; <b>because</b> <b>he</b> does wrong; <b>because,</b> under present influences, {{he is always}} likely to do wrong. <b>He</b> {{is interesting}} <b>because</b> <b>he</b> has become what he is now {{by means of the}} very temperament which often makes the noblest virtue. It is feeling, acuteness of feeling, which has given that countenance its expression, that character its moroseness.|$|R
60|$|I love {{to quote}} from Grimes, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> is so dramatic. And <b>because</b> <b>he</b> is so romantic. And <b>because</b> <b>he</b> seems to care but little whether {{he tells the}} truth or not, so he scares the reader or excites his envy or his admiration.|$|R
50|$|He {{was imprisoned}} in Rome <b>because</b> <b>he</b> disobeyed the Pope Paul VI, {{probably}} <b>because</b> <b>he</b> accepted some Protestantism theories.|$|R
5000|$|... "My {{respect for}} Rabindranath is not <b>because</b> <b>he</b> is a {{so-called}} superman, but <b>because</b> <b>he</b> {{is a complete}} human being." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And {{the claims}} to the honour are so opposite,' said Lucian Gay; 'one, {{on account of his}} large estate; another, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> has none; one, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> has a well-grown family to {{perpetuate}} the title; another, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> has no heir, and no power of ever obtaining one.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Why, no,' says Ogden; 'they say nobody {{got a good}} {{sight of}} him <b>because</b> <b>he</b> wore a mask. But they {{know it was a}} train-robber called Black Bill, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> always works alone and <b>because</b> <b>he</b> dropped a {{handkerchief}} in the express-car that had his name on it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "3. He {{could not}} have {{intended}} to kill his master, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> had no passport in his pocket, and no clothes; and <b>because</b> <b>he</b> must have been detained at the frontier until morning; and <b>because</b> <b>he</b> {{would have had to}} drive two carriages, in order to avoid suspicion.|$|R
60|$|Grand, heroic was the notion: Yet {{the picture}} failed entirely: Failed, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> moved a little, Moved, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> couldn't help it.|$|R
6000|$|Uneasy <b>because</b> <b>he</b> {{was away}} from the office, displeased <b>because</b> <b>he</b> had to leave his beloved letters to the Southern trade, angry <b>because</b> <b>he</b> had had {{difficulty}} in getting a pass to the wharf, and furious, finally, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> hadn't slept, Mr. Wrenn nursed all these cumulative emotions attentively {{and waited for the}} coming of the Hesperida. He was wondering if he'd want to see Istra at all. He couldn't remember just how she looked. Would he like her? ...|$|R
60|$|Now the Jains officially {{recognize}} all the Gods of the Hindu creed, {{as well as}} the Lingam and the Snake. They {{wear the}} Brahminical thread; they adhere to every claim of Hindu caste-law. But, because they knew and loved the lama, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> was an old man, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> sought the Way, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> was their guest, and <b>because</b> <b>he</b> collogued long of nights with the head-priest--as free-thinking a metaphysician as ever split one hair into seventy--they murmured assent.|$|R
50|$|According to Clancy Lyall, Dike stopped <b>because</b> <b>he</b> {{had been}} {{wounded in the}} right {{shoulder}} (which Lyall saw), not <b>because</b> <b>he</b> had panicked.|$|R
60|$|There {{they were}} {{for all the world}} like two little heaps of snow. Jumper didn't move so much as a hair. Whitey didn't move so much as a feather. Both were waiting and watching. Jumper didn't move <b>because</b> <b>he</b> knew that Whitey was there. Whitey didn't move <b>because</b> <b>he</b> didn't want any one to know he was there, and didn't know that Jumper was there. Jumper was sitting still <b>because</b> <b>he</b> was afraid. Whitey was sitting still <b>because</b> <b>he</b> was hungry.|$|R
5000|$|... "To {{every little}} girl {{her father is}} a hero. It's taken some getting used to, that my father {{actually}} is one. And {{not just in the}} obvious ways. <b>Because</b> <b>he</b> likes to listen as much as he likes to talk; <b>because</b> <b>he's</b> studious in the way someone is when everything in the whole world interests them; <b>because</b> <b>he</b> leads by example; <b>because</b> <b>he</b> trusts people with the truth and doesn't pander or play to our baser instincts." [...] - Alexandra Kerry ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't want Mumps," [...] {{answered}} Dick. [...] "Not <b>because</b> <b>he</b> {{ran against}} me, but <b>because</b> <b>he</b> was Baxter's toady {{and is a}} regular sneak." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "James is {{not really}} cynical," [...] she told herself. [...] "He says things, not <b>because</b> <b>he</b> means them, but <b>because</b> <b>he</b> likes to startle people." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{is but one}} answer, and I {{am sorry}} if you don't like it. If Innocent is happy, it is <b>because</b> <b>he</b> IS innocent. If he can defy the conventions, it is just <b>because</b> <b>he</b> can keep the commandments. It is just <b>because</b> <b>he</b> {{does not want to}} kill but to excite to life that a pistol is still as {{exciting}} to him as it is to a schoolboy. It is just <b>because</b> <b>he</b> does not want to steal, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> does not covet his neighbour's goods, that he has captured the trick (oh, how we all long for it!), the trick of coveting his own goods. It is just <b>because</b> <b>he</b> does not want to commit adultery that he achieves the romance of sex; it is just <b>because</b> <b>he</b> loves one wife that he has a hundred honeymoons. If he had really murdered a man, if he had really deserted a woman, {{he would not be able}} to feel that a pistol or a love-letter was like a song-- at least, not a comic song." ...|$|R
60|$|The station passed, the {{brakeman}} did not return, perhaps <b>because</b> <b>he</b> {{found some}} other listener, perhaps <b>because</b> <b>he</b> {{was afraid of}} boring this pleasant young fellow.|$|R
5000|$|They {{told him}} about Cronshaw."Have you ever read any of his work?""No," [...] said Philip."It came out in The Yellow Book."They looked upon him, as {{painters}} often do writers, with contempt <b>because</b> <b>he</b> was a layman, with tolerance <b>because</b> <b>he</b> practised an art, and with awe <b>because</b> <b>he</b> used a medium in which themselves felt ill-at-ease.|$|R
25|$|Siproites is a boy, who, either <b>because</b> <b>he</b> accidentally sees Artemis bathing or <b>because</b> <b>he</b> {{attempts}} to rape her, is {{turned into a}} girl by the goddess.|$|R
50|$|He is {{considered}} a cult figure in Basel, mainly <b>because</b> <b>he</b> stayed loyal to the club for 25 years but also <b>because</b> <b>he</b> never scored a goal.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Because</b> <b>he</b> {{admitted}} to changing the size 32 to size 31 {{of all his}} jeans <b>because</b> <b>he</b> [...] "doesn't {{want to be a}} 32" [...] ("The Sponge").|$|R
50|$|Sprite is a boy, who, either <b>because</b> <b>he</b> accidentally sees Artemis bathing or <b>because</b> <b>he</b> {{attempts}} to rape her, is {{turned into a}} girl by the goddess.|$|R
5000|$|Richard {{gave the}} album this title <b>because</b> <b>he</b> doesn't like the term [...] "greatest hits" [...] <b>because</b> <b>he</b> {{felt it was}} [...] "an {{overused}} thing". He continues: ...|$|R
6000|$|... (4.) <b>Because</b> <b>he</b> is the Son of man. He [...] "hath {{given him}} {{authority}} to execute judgment also, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> is the Son of man" [...] (John 5:27).|$|R
5000|$|Johan was {{automatically}} {{nominated by}} Big Brother. He also {{was not allowed}} to nominate <b>because</b> <b>he</b> was immune from being nominated last week <b>because</b> <b>he</b> was in Africa.|$|R
60|$|I {{think now}} {{we may see}} that I was right when I said--Perhaps the history of Joseph is in the Bible because it IS a family history. For see, it {{is the history of}} a man who loved his family, who felt that family life was holy and God-appointed; whom God rewarded with honour and wealth, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> honoured family ties; <b>because</b> <b>he</b> refused his master's wife; <b>because</b> <b>he</b> rewarded his {{brothers}} good for evil; <b>because</b> <b>he</b> was not ashamed of his father, but succoured him in his old age.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, now you've {{answered}} {{your own}} question," [...] grunted Grandfather Frog. [...] "Flitter flies at night <b>because</b> <b>he</b> is safest then, and <b>because</b> <b>he</b> can find plenty to eat." ...|$|R
