50|$|With roots tracing back to 1963, NTN Bearing Corporation of America of Mount Prospect, Illinois {{produces}} and distributes roller and <b>ball</b> <b>bearings</b> to the United States industrial, automotive {{and recreational}} clientele. Products manufactured {{by the company}} include agricultural and farm implement <b>bearings,</b> angular contact <b>ball</b> <b>bearings,</b> automotive <b>bearings,</b> <b>ball</b> and roller <b>bearing</b> mounted units, cylindrical roller bearings, electrical motor bearings, heavy industrial bearings, machine tool bearings, micro and miniature <b>ball</b> <b>bearings,</b> needle roller <b>bearings,</b> radial <b>ball</b> <b>bearings,</b> spherical roller bearings, tapered roller bearings and ultra-class bearing units.|$|R
5000|$|Wheel bearings: Most caster {{applications}} {{require the}} wheel to function with a bearing. There are numerous bearing options depending on the wheel design and the application being considered. Common bearings used for caster wheels include: roller bearings, tapered roller <b>bearings,</b> <b>ball</b> <b>bearings,</b> precision <b>ball</b> <b>bearings,</b> Delrin and self-lubricating sleeves.|$|R

25|$|The {{balls are}} then hard ground. They are {{ground in the}} same type of machine as used before, but either an {{abrasive}} is introduced into coolant or the rotating plate is replaced with a very hard fine-grain grinding wheel. This step can get the balls within ±. If the balls need more precision then they are lapped, again in {{the same type of}} machine. However, this time the rill plates are made of a softer material, usually cast iron, less pressure is applied, the plate is rotated slowly. This step is what gives <b>bearing</b> <b>balls</b> their shiny appearance and can bring the balls between grades 10 and 48.|$|E
500|$|Since 1990, {{the cost}} {{has been reduced}} {{substantially}} as production volume has increased. Although [...] bearings are still 2–5 times {{more expensive than the}} best steel bearings, their superior performance and life are justifying rapid adoption. Around 15–20million [...] <b>bearing</b> <b>balls</b> were produced in the U.S. in 1996 for machine tools and many other applications. Growth is estimated at 40% per year, but could be even higher if ceramic bearings are selected for consumer applications such as in-line skates and computer disk drives.|$|E
50|$|Honda straight-twin engines, {{which began}} {{appearing}} in the late 1950s, had four main bearings. Subsequent engines had four or occasionally three main <b>bearings,</b> <b>ball</b> <b>bearings</b> being better than shell bearings for this engine configuration.|$|R
