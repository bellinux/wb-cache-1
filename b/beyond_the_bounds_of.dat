5|$|Wild men or savages—usually {{depicted}} carrying staves or clubs, living <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> <b>bounds</b> <b>of</b> civilization without shelter or fire, lacking {{feelings and}} souls—were then {{a metaphor for}} man without God. Common superstition held that long-haired wild men, known as lutins, who danced to firelight either to conjure demons {{or as part of}} fertility rituals, lived in mountainous areas such as the Pyrenees. In some village charivaris at harvest or planting time dancers dressed as wild men, to represent demons, were ceremonially captured and then an effigy of them was symbolically burnt to appease evil spirits. The church, however, considered these rituals pagan and demonic.|$|E
5|$|Beginning around 1238, {{the castle}} was {{expanded}} to the east, north, and north-west. The work lasted through {{the reign of}} HenryIII and into that of EdwardI, interrupted occasionally by civil unrest. New creations included a new defensive perimeter, studded with towers, while on the west, north, and east sides, where the wall was not defended by the river, a defensive ditch was dug. The eastern extension took the castle <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> <b>bounds</b> <b>of</b> the old Roman settlement, marked by the city wall which had been incorporated into the castle's defences. The Tower had long been a symbol of oppression, despised by Londoners, and Henry's building programme was unpopular. So when the gatehouse collapsed in 1240, the locals celebrated the setback. The expansion caused disruption locally and £166 was paid to St Katherine's Hospital and the prior of Holy Trinity in compensation.|$|E

25|$|After the schism in the Congregational Churches {{resulting}} in {{the foundation of the}} American Unitarian Association, some of those churches remained within the Congregational fold and became member congregations of the Congregational organization (later the United Church of Christ), while others voted to become Unitarian.

Universalist churches in contrast followed a different path, having begun as independent congregations <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> <b>bounds</b> <b>of</b> the established Puritan churches entirely.

25|$|An {{increasing}} number of economists and international commerce theorists have suggested that economic discrimination goes far <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> <b>bounds</b> <b>of</b> individuals or businesses. The largest scale forms of economic discrimination, and the widest ranging, affect entire nations or global regions. Many consider that an open world economic system (globalization), which includes world bodies such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank, and International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), places countries at risk by practicing explicitly discriminatory techniques such as bilateral and regional bargaining, as well as asymmetrical trade balances and the maintaining of cheap force labor. Trade policies like the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) are often regarded as financial measures serving to economically oppress third world nations.|$|E
25|$|Penthouse, {{started by}} Bob Guccione in England in 1965, took a {{different}} approach. Women looked indirectly at the camera, {{as if they were}} going about their private idylls. This change of emphasis was influential in erotic depictions of women. Penthouse was also the first magazine to publish pictures that included pubic hair and , both of which were considered <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> <b>bounds</b> <b>of</b> the erotic and in the realm of pornography at the time. In the late 1960s, magazines began to move into more explicit displays often focusing on the buttocks as standards of what could be legally depicted and what readers wanted to see changed. By the 1970s, they were focusing on the pubic area and eventually, by the 1990s, featured sexual penetration, lesbianism and homosexuality, group sex, masturbation, and fetishes in the more hard-core magazines such as Hustler.|$|E

However, McWilliam cites the monumental study by Douglas Woodruff (1957), {{in which the}} author posits that the Claimant could just possibly have been Roger Tichborne. Woodruff's principal argument is the sheer improbability that anyone could conceive such an imposture from scratch, at such a distance, and then implement it: [...] "t was carrying effrontery <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> <b>bounds</b> <b>of</b> sanity if Arthur Orton embarked with a wife and retinue and crossed the world, knowing that {{they would all be}} destitute if he did not succeed in convincing a woman he had never met and knew nothing about first-hand, that he was her son".|$|E

In 2014, Solo was one of the victims of the iCloud leaks of celebrity photos, during which several nude pictures of her were leaked online.

500|$|In 1783, Austen and {{her sister}} Cassandra were sent to Oxford to be educated by Mrs Ann Cawley who took them with her to Southampton when she moved there later in the year. In the autumn both girls were sent home when they caught typhus and Austen nearly died. Austen was from then home educated, until she {{attended}} boarding school in Reading with her sister from early in 1785 at the Abbey School House, ruled by Mrs La Tournelle, who possessed a cork leg and a passion for theatre. The school curriculum probably included some French, spelling, needlework, dancing and music and, perhaps, drama. The sisters returned home before December 1786 because the school fees for the two girls were too high for the Austen family. [...] After 1786, Austen [...] "never again lived anywhere <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> <b>bounds</b> <b>of</b> her immediate family environment".|$|E
500|$|In Public Prosecutor v. Ong Kian Cheong (2009), the District Court {{said that}} the above statement, which {{referred}} to opinions on race, applied with equal force to insensitive and denigrating opinions about religious beliefs. The case involved two accused persons who were convicted under the Sedition Act and the Undesirable Publications Act for distributing religious literature that was considered seditious and objectionable to Muslims. Section 3(1)(e) of the Sedition Act defines a seditious tendency as including a tendency to [...] "promote feelings of ill-will and hostility between different races or classes {{of the population of}} Singapore". In the course of spreading their own faith, the accused persons had offended public order by distributing religious materials that were objectionable to Muslims, and the Court regarded this to be <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> <b>bounds</b> <b>of</b> the constitutional right to propagate religion. The Court was of the view that although a person is free to choose his or her own religion and to practise it, religious fervour to spread faith must be constrained by considerations of sensitivity, tolerance and mutual respect for the faith and religious beliefs of another. Individuals cannot claim to be ignorant of the sensitivity of race and religion in Singapore's multi-racial and multi-religious society.|$|E
