40|$|Eurocode 8 {{represents}} {{a new generation}} of structural design codes in Europe and defines requirements for the design of buildings against earthquake action. In Central and Western Europe, the new earthquake zones in connection with the corresponding design ground acceleration values will show in many cases earthquake actions which are remarkably higher than defined by the design codes used in Central Europe up to now. In many cases, the weak point of masonry structures is the corner points of walls during an earthquake. Loading of masonry walls in most cases leads to a high exploitation of the shear capacity. Since the bending moments increase with shear forces, the eccentricity of the normal force in the critical cross section becomes significant. This in turn leads to a reduction {{of the size of the}} compression zone in unreinforced walls with a high concentration of normal stresses and shear stresses. Corner-Gap-Elements, consisting of a <b>bearing</b> <b>beam</b> made of a sufficiently strong material (such as reinforced concrete), ensure a limitation of eccentricity of the normal force and thus, restrict the pinching of the compression zone. The deformation can be concentrated in the joint below the <b>bearing</b> <b>beam.</b> According to the principles of the capacity design philosophy, the masonry itself is protected from high stresses as a potential cause of brittle failure. Shaking-table tests at NTU-Athens have proven the effectiveness of the Corner-Gap- Element. The presentation covers the evaluations of experimental results with numerical calculations.

The interlocking brick system investigated in this study was a load bearing brick system relied on U-shaped hollow bricks in the bed row and hollow voids in the beam that allowed the addition of reinforced concrete grout stiffeners in vertical and horizontal directions to enhance the stability and integrity of the beams. Both Normal Concrete (NC) and Self Compacting Concrete (SCC) were and concrete, grout, and mortar used as infill material. Generally, in this research, twelve specimens are prepared for full scale testing with different parameters. The size of hollow brick was 250 mm x 1250 x 100 and the number of rebar was 12 mm diameter. The dimensions of beam make with hollow brick and horizontal and vertical rebar was 3000 mm length, 125 mm width, and 300 mm height. It was found that addition of super plasticizer in beam with SCC performed better under flexural loading than NC. This behavior also allows the concrete to have a more homogeneous mix, resulting to better bonding between bricks, grout, and steel reinforcement. Different arrangement of hollow interlocking brick in bed row causes a very ductile behavior because of the horizontal reinforcement surrounded by concrete between two layers of hollow brick which it has better interaction among the rebar, brick, and grout...|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{comprises}} six {{papers with}} the overall theme of measurement, assessment and control of diesel engine noise, with an emphasize on control. The radiation of noise is shown {{to be dominated by}} {{the low end of the}} engine sides and by the engine front. The mode shapes of the crankcase, the oil sump and the timing transmission cover are investigated. The vibrations are measured and analysed through running mode, modal analyses and SEA. The noise radiation is explored in detail with near-field measurements of sound intensity. In the engine front, the noise radiation is shown to have contributions from the timing casing, the oil-sump front and the crankshaft torsion vibration damper. The radiation from the torsion damper is analysed by a regression analysis of measured intensity data and the vibrations of the damper are investigated with a laser-doppler vibrometer. The results show that the damper vibrates in the axial directions with vibration modes that both radiate noise and interfere with the radiation from the engine structure. It is shown that there in the engine front are strong coupled vibration modes between the timing cover and the oil sump front m the frequency range 500 Hz - 1 kHz. The importance of the strong vibration modes in the crankcase and the oil-sump sides is shown. The propagation paths of noise and vibration to the engine front have been examined with an SEA powerflow analysis and by opening the front cover to measure the sound power from the timing gears. The main excitations of the front cover are found to be by engine block vibrations below 1. 25 kHz and by tuning gears noise above 2 kHz. Various constructions to control the noise are tested. Two stiffeners are designed and tested to reduce vibrations m the engine low end, one ladder frame introducing stiffness at the crankcase flange and one <b>bearing</b> <b>beam</b> introducing stiffness at the main bearing caps. The stiffeners have hem evaluated by sound intensity measurements and mobility measurements. The ladder frame gave good noise reductions but the <b>bearing</b> <b>beam</b> merely caused frequency shifts of the bearing modes. A decoupling of the oil sump resulted in significant noise and vibration reductions. The timing cover is modified by increasing the damping and by decrease the radiation efficiency. Various interior panels are tested, like plexiglass and aluminium panels of different thicknesses, a rubber damping layer and a combined rubber/steel-sheet damping layer. A thin plastic sheet has low radiation efficiency and may thereby lower the noise emission. A slightly improved model for calculation of radiation efficiency of small irregularly shaped plates is suggested. The traditional SEA prediction model is shown to be ill-conditioned for engine applications. An improved model using geometric averaging is suggested and evaluated. The results show that the new SEA model is working well for frequencies down to 800 Hz for predictions of damping treatments, decoupling of the oil sump and for power-flow determinations. The concept of equivalent mass is found valuable and validations are made according to the consistency and reciprocity theories. A hemi-anechoic engine laboratory is constructed and evaluated. New efficient low-cost diffusing absorbers have been designed, the performance is evaluated with standard deviation analysis of sound pressure measurements. The performance of the absorbers is found to be compeatable with much more expensive commercial designs. Measured sound intensity in three-dimensional vectors is a powerful tool to identify and illustrate sound fields. When used in near-fields to identify complex noise sources large errors may occur. It is shown that the low relative levels of vector components and the reactivity of the sound field give large errors m repeated measurements. Analyses and comparisons are performed on a simple source and on an engine. A two- and a six-microphone probe were used that were hand-held and robot-controlled. It is concluded dig in point-intensity measurements on engineering noise sources, a 4 - 6 microphone probe and a precision positioner should be used to get reliable measurements.

40|$|Noise {{control and}} sound quality {{analysis}} are important, since noise has been registered to be a predominant factor in stress {{and a source}} of great annoyance. Traffic noise is a problem and a major part of this noise comes from heavy vehicles. The only legislative requirement for heavy-duty trucks regarding noise emissions, is that the noise level does not exceed an Aweighted sound pressure level of 80 dB. The specification of an A-weighted sound pressure level is, however, not an adequate description of psychoacoustic annoyance and therefore work towards defining a better description of loudness is one of the principal fields of acoustics today. Sound radiation from trucks is speed-related. At medium and high speeds, the overall noise level is comprised mainly of the tyre noise, whereas at low speed and during acceleration, exhaust noise and noise from the engine and transmission structure are predominant. In front of the truck, the noise from the engine and especially that from the timing transmission cover, the torsional damper and the oil sump, comprises a greater proportion of the total noise. The aim of sound quality analysis of diesel engines is to find cost-efficient methods of reducing sound radiation and of changing the character of the sound in order to minimise annoyance. This thesis concerns the development of experimental methods for analysing the sound quality of diesel engines, and focuses on measurement of acoustic intensity, multivariate data analysis, structural modification and subjective assessment of engine noise. The applicability of the FFT-based sound intensity method is evaluated. It is found that the intensity measurements may be influenced by high reactivity, interference due to partlycoherent sources, difficulties in performing the spatial average, real-time limitations and engine speed variations. Scanning the intensity probe, preferably by a robot, is necessary when measuring within narrow bands to avoid interference problems. Scanning achieves more reliable estimates of sound power and intensity vectors. Experimental design and the multivariate techniques, principal components analysis (PCA) and partial least squares (PLS) were utilised to facilitate interpretation of intensity measurements. The results show that PCA and PLS enable independent phenomena in the sound field to be extracted and which can thereby be visualised by principal spectra and principal radiating patterns. The characteristics of sound radiation are determined by designed experiments, sound intensity measurements and operational deflection shape estimations. These methods enable the effects on sound radiation of structure modifications to be predicted. An annoyance index for in-line 6 -cylinder diesel engines in stationary running conditions was developed using multivariate statistics. The index is based on engine sounds resulting from structure modifications and changes in fuel. The annoyance level was measured during listening tests of sound stimuli recorded in stereo and reproduced by loudspeakers under anechoic conditions. The different sound stimuli were ranked using paired comparisons or the method of successive intervals. It was found that 94 % of the variance of annoyance can be explained by a model based on loudness (Sone), sharpness (Acum) and harmonic ratio (rumble). Impulsiveness, roughness and tonality were other important criteria used in the study and which were found to have a relationship with specific speed ranges. The annoyance was minimised by an increase in stiffness in {{the lower part of the}} engine achieved by using a ladder frame in combination with a <b>bearing</b> <b>beam.</b> Godkänd; 1996; 20061214 (biem...|$|E

The {{origin of}} the railway systems is {{considerably}} old. In very old times, {{it is known that}} people were carrying heavy freights by the similar way in concept to railway transportation. From history to present day, there have been significant improvements in the rail system. With the industrial revolution and the appearance of motor vehicles together with the rapid population growth, the need of railway transportation gradually increased and that demands resulted in modern railway establishment. Today, maglev trains have been exceeded 500 km/h speed but this type of railway transportation is not in public use yet. Only one line of maglev train in China known in service carrying passengers with high-speed (maximum velocity is 430 km/h).   On the other hand, conventional rapid trains recently have reached over 300 km/h velocity. These rapid trains nowadays have significant share of transportation in the world. Thanks to all these developments, the railway transportation has been taking more important place in human life. To fulfill the increased demands, many types of railway systems have been implementing and more passengers have been benefiting from railway transportation day by day. Therefore, to provide a secure and comfortable transportation system concurrently with favorable cost, railway track design becomes more prominent. In this study, 2 nd chapter explains conventional railway and the layers of the railway track by giving technical properties. The layers that form the track superstructure are the formation, sub-ballast, ballast, geotextile, frost protection layer. Since the topic of this study is a ballastless track design, sub-ballast and ballast layers are not explained here. Add to this, brief information about sub-base soil condition is given. Besides, according to UIC Code, formation layer thickness has been shown by table depending on the different types of soil quality class.   Types of slab track systems used worldwide and their cross-section properties are also briefly shown together with figures of cross section properties. Some of these balastless tracks have been examined more detailed and their advantages are introduced in general. Lots of different balasstless track systems have been classified in a table and the advantages of ballastless track systems are given in general. In the 3 rd chapter, the components of the cast in-situ slab track system which are rail, fasteners, sleepers and concrete plate or plinth beams are examined and the components of these in worldwide use are classified and introduced. Rail types are described as flange rail, double headed rail and Vignol rail. Technical properties of the rail types briefly given and the specification, features that they should have and information about pros and cons of these elements explained. Rail fasteners systems are described as two types, rigid system fasteners and elastic system fasteners. The features of these types of fasteners are shown together with figures. After that sleepers defined under the titles of wooden, steel, concrete and plastic sleepers. Some types of the sleepers that tried and currently being used in the world explained. In concrete sleeper title, post-stressed and pre-stressed concrete sleepers have been described. In this chapter we also give some information about plinth concrete beam and explain the measures must be taken during its construction stage briefly. In the 4 th chapter, a type of slab track systems LVT has been chosen and explained in more detail. Here we also mentioned about ground born noise and vibration mitigation which has an inspiration to choosing LVT slab track. Some measures that should be taken for special buildings such as hospital and theater are given. Besides this, LVT systems features and advantages are explained. In 5 th chapter, design of railway superstructure with an example of LVT system has been explained. At first, we explain how the wheel loads are transferred from top (rail) to sub-base showing modeling of railway superstructure in figure. Slab track modeling has springs between the layers that form the superstructure. From bottom to top, first springs take place under the rigid concrete slab which represents the soil elasticity. Since we examined LVT system here, second spring is between rigid slab and LVT concrete block so called block pad as explained in chapter 4 and the third spring for modeling takes place under the rail representing rail pad stiffness. This type of modeling can also be seen in figure.   In chapter 5 we also introduce the forces which effect railway superstructure. Forces studied under the titles of vertical forces, horizontal forces, temperature stresses and other forces and technical information about these forces are given. Vertical forces investigated under two titles, static and dynamic vertical forces. As for the horizontal forces, they are shown under two titles either as the forces acting parallel to longitudinally direction of railway superstructure and forces acting perpendicular direction to the railway. In temperature stresses section, the calculation of forces emanating from temperature has been given by equation depending on unit length change and temperature change. Railway roadway design is performed assuming that railway is a beam laid on elastic platform, and therefore, determination of soil type and coefficient of soil stiffness or soil spring value is important. Here in chapter 5, we give information about calculation of coefficient of soil stiffness in light of Winkler and Zimmermann’s equations. For obtain one soil coefficient of stiffness when multi-layer case is subject, Eisenmann’s equivalent layers theory has been used and introduced by the help of a figure and the calculation of this method has been explained. Another coefficient used for superstructure static analyses is dynamic impact factor. Today many types of calculation method developed for taking into consideration of the impact of dynamic forces acting on railway. In this study we used Eisenmann’s equations for the speed until 200 km/h.   5 th chapter also explain the analyses and concrete slab design calculation for LVT system under different vehicle loads. The loads chosen here have been taken from UIC and EN 1991 standards. For freight train maximum speed taken as 100 km/h. As for the passenger train and high-speed train maximum speed taken as 120 km/h and 250 km/h respectively. Load Model 71 from UIC is used for freight train. For passenger and high speed train, type- 2 and type- 3 load model from EN 1991 has been used. It should be kept in mind that there is much more different type of load models depending on vehicle style. For analysis, FEA base computer program SAP 2000 has been preferred. This program allows engineers to model almost every type of structure realistically. To model LVT system in the program, modeling technique of which illustration is given by figure in chapter 5 has been used. Rail pad which take place under the rails at joints and rubber boot and LVT block pad represented by springs. Here LVT concrete block pad and the rubber boot which contains the block thought together and their stiffness combined calculating an equivalent spring coefficient.   Soil condition considered as good and class of the subbase soil taken as QS 3 according to soil classification of UIC Code. In the model soil represented with springs either. Slab area that considered here a <b>bearing</b> <b>beam</b> laid on elastic platform divided into small finite elements for analysis. The analysis results are shown in figures as contours diagram and concrete design has been performed using the longitudinally and transverse moment values. There might be lots of soil types and geometrical properties on the route of railway track. Thus, quite a lot different conditions may be needed to take into account. In this study the chosen part is regarded as an alignment and calculation is performed accordingly. In final section we explained our assessments and thoughts about the results of the study.

[...] The result was a car with a traditional “overslung” (“Hochbett”) chassis with the longitudinal chassis members directly above the axles, at a time when newer designs increasingly favored “underslung” (“Tiefbett”) chassis layouts on which the axles sat directly above the load <b>bearing</b> chassis <b>beams.</b> The 1928 Mercedes-Benz W08 therefore looked unfashionably tall even at the time of its launch.|$|R
30|$|A {{freely movable}} roller {{assembly}} (roller-support) and a fixed roller assembly (hinged-support) were provided at the North and South beam ends, respectively. This enabled free rotation and longitudinal {{movement of the}} simply supported beam during test. All the steel bearing plates and rollers were heat-treated to maximum hardness {{in order to minimize}} local deformations. Lead sheets were also used between the load <b>bearing</b> plates and <b>beam</b> surface to help distribute the load evenly.|$|R
40|$|Nanotubes {{are useful}} for not only {{strengthening}} polymer based materials that are of widespread use in aerospace applications, but also for their nondestructive testing. Nanotubes with defects are now routinely manufactured. Their manufacture without defects is still prohibitively expensive. Thus, it becomes important {{to be able to}} identify the defect percentage in the nanotubes, because the defects cause reduction in both strength and stiffness and electrical conductivity. The elastic properties of carbon nanotubes with imperfections are studied using a model based on structural mechanics. The carbon - carbon bonds are modeled as load <b>bearing</b> <b>beams</b> joined together by the carbon atoms. The mechanical properties of a bond are obtained from a relationship between structural mechanics and molecular mechanics. The carbon nanotubes are drawn forming this structure and the stiffness matrix of the nanotube is obtained from the assembly of the stiffness matrix of each bond. The obtained results for carbon nanotubes without imperfections are verified by comparing them to previous works. Furthermore, the number of degrees of freedom of each atom is reduced from six to three by neglecting the moments. This simplifies the model, reduces the computation time and allows the test of larger nanotubes with a low impact on the accuracy of the results. Finally, different percentages of imperfections are introduced in the nanotubes in the form of missing atoms and the evolution of the Young's modulus with randomly imposed imperfection percentage is obtained. This relationship turned out to be almost linear when the imperfections percentage is small. The results obtained allow the prediction of the quality of carbon nanotubes from the elastic properties observed in experimental tests. If the Young's modulus of some nanotubes is found, then it can be directly related to a percentage of imperfections. The minimum number of necessary experimental tests to obtain statistically accurate results is also discussed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract-A {{displacement}} {{finite element}} method for analyzing a beam on continuous elastic foundation is presented. A three-dimensional model which accounts {{for the effects of}} both the Filonenko-Borodich and Pastemak foundation models in a consistent and complete way is used. A variational principle is introduced with the slope field due to bending only and the displacement field approximated by independent quantities ubjected to variation. Numerical examples illustrate the accuracy of the element, the importance of shear, axial and shear-axial interaction effects associated with continuous elastic foundation, and finally the application of the element o a rotor supported by two hydrodynamic journal <b>bearings.</b> NOTATION <b>beam</b> cross sectional area definition in Fig. I beam diameter Young’s modulus of elasticity uniform, elastic foundation spring constants per unit length in y and z direction...|$|R

He saw the nymph on the left as holding a bow, and {{the one on the}} right holding a lily. The trees, however, he identified as more likely to represent larches (larices, singular larix), from which he derives the name Lariscolus ("young larch"), hence embodying the sisters of Phaëton transformed to larches. Alföldi established the currently dominant view that the reverse represented a [...] "triple goddess" [...] statue in a cypress grove, with Diana Nemorensis on the obverse to represent the origin of the gens Accoleia in Aricia. Diana, however, had an affinity with the oak, and had an ancient sanctuary on the Mons Querquetulanus (see below).|$|R
