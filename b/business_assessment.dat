40|$|Despite {{criticisms of}} the use of case studies in assessment, {{especially}} in examination settings, their use is prevalent in business management education, primarily in order to develop critical thinking skills and highlight the complex business problems faced by managers. However, case studies readily available for <b>business</b> <b>assessments</b> typically comprise multi-national, world-leading corporations, which can result in a number of problems, not least the large volume of material available on the web about these organisations. In addition, employers feel that business courses are too focused on large corporations rather than preparing students for working in small-medium enterprises (SMEs). This paper will present the authors approach to developing his own case studies for use in <b>business</b> <b>assessments,</b> based on local SMEs. This approach facilitates a more in-depth assessment analysis and exposes students to a broader range of business scenarios. The use of a ‘live’ case provides a closer fit to reality which in turn, enhances learning. It is intended that the approach presented here will inform and challenge university colleagues to explore the development and use of case-based assessments, particularly how they might apply these practices to their own professional area...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Economic {{analysis}} of knowledge-based processes {{should take the}} interdependencies between a number of social, technical and human factors into account. Most current methods of evaluation are dedicated to one specific objective or only indirectly reflect the underlying structure of causes and effects. This paper discusses some existing methods for economic evaluation and then combines the identified requirements and diverse similar methods to propose the concept of 'evaluation chains'. The structure of the evaluation chains is quite flexible {{and can be used}} from straightforward support of discussions to a sophisticated calculation. The necessary additional rigour is achieved through graph-theoretical constraints. To exemplify the usage of evaluation chains an example is discussed in the area of software reuse. It starts with the <b>business</b> <b>assessment</b> of the benefits of software reuse and then systematically integrates the human and technical aspects of the reuse process. ...|$|E

40|$|Drawing on {{data from}} the Australian <b>Business</b> <b>Assessment</b> of Computer User Security (ABACUS) survey, this paper {{examines}} a range of factors that may influence businesses’ likelihood of being victimised by a computer security incident. It {{has been suggested that}} factors including business size, industry sector, level of outsourcing, expenditure on computer security functions and types of computer security tools and/or policies used may influence the probability of particular businesses experiencing such incidents. This paper uses probability modelling to test whether this is the case for the 4, 000 businesses that responded to the ABACUS survey. It was found that the industry sector that a business belonged to, and business expenditure on computer security, were not related to businesses’ likelihood of detecting computer security incidents. Instead, the number of employees that a business has and whether computer security functions were outsourced were found to be key indicators of businesses’ likelihood of detecting incidents. Some of the implications of these findings are considered in this paper. ...|$|E

The results indicate that no single stock valuation method is applied in isolation. The combination of available approaches is the option in use with respect to the fund objective. The most important factors or indicators when selecting ordinary shares are: the firm’s financial situation, the shareholder value policy, the business climate index, the firm’s expected earnings, the sales development and future demand trends. We also found evidence that qualitative <b>business</b> <b>assessment</b> is essential in corporate stock and firm valuation. Therefore, we argue that more efforts should be directed into this valuation area. ...|$|E

A challenge for practitioners is to help them develop skills and attributes to facilitate lifelong learning. A need for further research into the self-regulation behaviour of this cohort has been identified. The primary research question was: What are the self-regulation behaviours {{of a group of}} 18 - 24 year olds while preparing a <b>business</b> <b>assessment?</b> Specifically: What were their help-seeking behaviours? How did they manage their time and study environment? This phenomenological study was concerned with understanding self-regulation behaviour as it was perceived by eight VET business students and their teachers. Semi-structured interviews were undertaken after submission of a written task. Quality control was achieved through a combination of data from participant and teacher interviews, and the researcher's interpretations. The self-regulatory behaviours of these learners were dependent on a range of factors. Findings provide the basis for further research into personality and self-regulation behaviour; learning difficulties and self-regulation behaviour; and the impact of technology distractions on time and effort.

40|$|Although the {{internationalization}} of curricula {{has increased}} steadily {{over the past}} 30 years, most universities and business schools have concentrated their efforts on program assessment activities, leaving course-level assessment as a gap in most international <b>business</b> <b>assessment</b> portfolios. To address the gap in aligning course-specific designs with course-specific learning outcomes, the current study focuses on a specific course domain. This study (1) assesses how students 2 ̆ 7 subject-specific motivational beliefs and learning behavior affect their perceived learning outcomes, and (2) examines how students 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of the task value of subject-specific assignments strengthen or weaken the effect of motivated learning on learning outcomes. The results highlight the critical roles of group-based term projects and individual-based IT tasks in strengthening the effect of self-efficacy and deep learning behavior on learning outcomes. International business educators are thus advised to manage students 2 ̆ 7 perceived task value with regard to outcome and effort expectancy. Practicable recommendations are provided for building up students 2 ̆ 7 expectations about desirable learning outcomes in relation to project-specific assignments, and fostering students 2 ̆ 7 beliefs about return-on-efforts through project-specific assessment rubrics...|$|E
