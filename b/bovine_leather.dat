40|$|AbstractClimate {{change is}} {{becoming}} a pressing issue for industries worldwide. Pollution, toxic products and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are the main {{issues related to the}} leather industry as perceived by the public. Life cycle assessment (LCA) method is a practical tool used to evaluate the life cycle environmental impacts of a product. The focus of this study is the GHG emissions of finished <b>bovine</b> <b>leather</b> in a cradle to gate scenario. The global warming contributors in the life cycle of finished <b>bovine</b> <b>leather</b> are quantified and expressed as a carbon footprint. The inputs of raw materials including the raw hides are measured by mass, yet the outputs of the finished <b>bovine</b> <b>leather</b> are measured by surface area. Due to this specific nature of leather, the study focuses on the correlation of life cycle GHG emissions with the thickness of finished <b>bovine</b> <b>leather.</b> The final results conclude that the thickness of finished <b>bovine</b> <b>leather</b> has significant impacts to the carbon footprints. This study raises awareness of the tanneries and downstream footwear manufacturers to take thickness into account as an important factor for future life cycle environmental impact studies. In addition, this study also lays the groundwork for further product carbon footprint studies for not only tannery houses but also supply chains of the leather industry in Taiwan or Asia...|$|E

40|$|Leather {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{globally}} spread biomaterial which is obtained by the processing of different animal skins. It encompasses a wide palette of applications, from footwear and clothing to upholsteries and different types of furniture [1], [2], [3]. The main constituent of animal skins is collagen, a supramolecular fibrillar protein in the form of a triple helix. This form endows leather with elasticity, good mechanical properties and softness. A major disadvantage resides in the inapplicability of raw animal hides, due to their microbiological instability and decay through rotting. Microbiological stability is obtained through the tanning process, characterized by protein crosslinking and drying afterwards. After tanning the leather exhibits the required properties for the desired specific applications in terms of aspect, availability and sustainability [4], [5]. The study aims to elucidate the thermal decomposition process of chrome-free tanned bovine hide (wet-white) using a new product based on titanium and aluminium salts compared with the same hide tanned by chromium salts (wet-blue).

The crust leather obtained by the oxidative unhairing process showed good physical-mechanical and technical properties comparable with those obtained by the traditional one, and the leather was technically assessed as satisfactory and suitable according to the market request. The actual reduction of the environmental impact of the novel process, in relation with the traditional one, was evaluated performing a Life Cycle Assesment (LCA) using SimaPro 7. 3, one of the most used software for LCA analysis.

40|$|In today's move to "sustainable production" {{the leather}} industry, {{as well as}} many other {{industries}} is recognized as a polluting one. Traditional chemical operations are polluting because of the levels of inorganic chemical waste. Process chemicals which are not consumed within the reactions necessary to convert collagen to leather are currently discharged to waste. These are usually applied during bulk production, such as inorganic agents from beam house and tanning processes, e. g. lime, sulphide, ammonium salts, sulphuric acid and sodium chloride, mineral tanning agents – mainly Cr(III) and the less common Al(III), Zr(III), Ti(III), Fe(III) salts -, whereas depending on the tanning process and the leather article produced organic chemical waste discharged comprises aldehydic and polyphenolic tanning products, bating enzymes, organic carboxylic acids and excess electrolyte stable synthetic fat liquors. It is rare for chemicals and water to be recovered for re-use from several of these process steps. Moreover, tanners worldwide are required to operate within strict legislative boundaries. Serious drawbacks continuously arise concerning the chrome–tanning process in leather industry and the environmental hazardous consequences of chromium containing effluents.

The tensile strength and specific work of fracture {{of these two}} materials was investigated using uniaxial tensile tests and trouser tear tests respectively. Corium material was observed to be intrinsically stronger and tougher than grain material. The greater resistance of corium material to fracture is attributed to the processes of fibre debonding and pull out. The viscoelastic nature of grain and corium material was investigated by examining differences in strength and toughness over a range of deformation rates. The ultimate tensile properties and the specific work of fracture of both grain and corium material are rate dependent. Energy dissipation during a strain cycle was measured over a range of strain rates and strain levels to determine the bulk hysteresis of grain and corium specimens. The influences of specimen orientation and fatliquor (oil) on strength and toughness are also considered. The notch sensitivity of grain and corium materials has been scrutinised. Corium material is highly notch insensitive, whereas the fracture of grain material is notably sensitive {{to the presence of}} notches. The mechanism of fibre orientation and the phenomenon of fibre independence (or fibre autonomy) are responsible for the notch insensitive fracture behaviour of corium material. Strain distribution was measured in grain and corium single edge notch specimens.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} effect of some {{parameters}} on the breaking strain, strength and {{the shape of the}} stress-strain curve of <b>bovine</b> <b>leather</b> as revealed by uniaxial tensile tests. The parameters explored are fatliquoring, moisture content, strain rate and cyclic stressing. A basic mechanical model of a simple two-dimensional weave is created and used to describe {{the effect of}} such a weave on the shape of the stress-strain curve. It is found that fatliquoring lubricates and opens up the fibre structure and thereby makes the weave more extensible. The increase in the extensibility depends on the direction in which samples are cut and therefore {{the manner in which the}} fibres are orientated. Patliquoring is observed to increase the degree to which fibres pull out at break. There are indications that the strength of fatliquored leather decreases with time of storage, while the extensibility increases. The effect of the strain rate on the breaking strain, the tensile strength and the shape of the stress-strain curve is not very clear. The stressing and releasing leather decreases the strength of leather when the fibres are orientated preferentially along the direction of the applied stresses, but has an insignificant effect in the transverse direction. It is concluded that the degree of lubrication in a weave and the orientation of the fibre bundles significantly influence the performance of leather in a test. Both moisture and fatliquoring lubricate the weave. In both the cases the degree of fibre adhesions in a weave is decreased. A well lubricated weave allows its constituent fibres to slide and align along the direction of the applied stresses, and this tends to occur before the fibres themselves areextended. Cyclic testing, at low strains, ruptures fibre adhesions and as a result induces permanent set and makes a hide softer. Most of the work done in breaking the fibre adhesion is done in the first cycle. ...|$|E

40|$|Type I {{collagen}} {{materials are}} used {{in a wide range}} of industrial applications. Some examples include leather for shoes and upholstery, acellular dermal matrix (ADM) materials for surgical applications, and bovine pericardium for the fabrication of heart valve replacements. The structure of these materials is based on a matrix of collagen fibrils, largely responsible for the physical properties and strength of the materials. How the collagen fibrils themselves contribute to the overall bulk properties of these materials is not fully understood. The first part of this work investigates a collagen structure defect in leather, known as looseness. Looseness occurs in around 5 - 10 % of <b>bovine</b> <b>leather,</b> and is a result of the collagen fibril layers separating during processing from raw skin to leather. A greater understanding of why looseness develops in leather and a method of detecting looseness early in processing is needed to save tanners a significant amount on wasted processing time and costs. In addition, an environmentally safe method of disposing of defect and waste leather is sort after since the current method of disposing to landfill is causing environmental concern due to the possibility of chromium leaching from leather into the soil as it biodegrades. Synchrotron based small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) revealed that loose leather has a more aligned and layered collagen fibril arrangement, meaning there is less fibril overlap, particularly in the grain-corium boundary region. This results in larger gaps in the internal structure of loose leather compared with tight. These gaps could be detected using ultrasonic imaging in partially processed pickle and wet-blue hides as well as leather. Incorporating an ultrasound system into the leather processing line could be a viable method for identifying hides deemed to develop looseness earlier in processing, and these could be diverted down a separate processing line or removed. Disposing of waste leather by first forming biochar prior to land fill proved to be an effective way of reducing chromium from leaching into the environment. XAS revealed that heating leather to temperatures above 600 °C in the absence of oxygen formed a char where chromium was bound in the stable form of chromium carbide. The stability of this structure makes chromium less available to form the toxic hexavalent form in the environment and presents a possible alternative option for environmentally safe disposal of leather. The second part to this work looks at the correlation between collagen fibril structure in a range of biomaterials in relation to material strength. Leather, ADM and pericardium are three type I collagen based materials which rely on sufficient strength to carry out their industrial and medical applications. These three materials were studied to try and identify collagen fibril characteristics that relate to high material strength. SAXS on a range of leather samples from various species revealed that collagen fibril diameter had only a small influence over material strength in <b>bovine</b> <b>leather,</b> and no correlation to strength in leather from other species. Therefore it can be said that the influence of fibril orientation on leather strength takes precedence over that of fibril diameter. Fibril diameter, d-spacing and orientation were studied in pericardium using SAXS while simultaneously applying strain. It was revealed collagen materials undergo two distinct stages of deformation when strain is applied and incrementally increased. The first stage, at low strain, involves a re-orientation of fibrils to become more aligned. When strain is increased further, the fibrils themselves take up the strain, causing fibrils to stretch and decrease in diameter. The Poisson ratio of the collagen fibrils was calculated to be 2. 1 ± 0. 7. This high Poisson's ratio indicates the fibrils decrease in diameter at a faster rate than they elongate with strain, and as a result the volume of the fibrils decreases. This feature of collagen could help explain some of the unique behaviours and strength of collagen based materials and could be useful for optimizing industrial applications of collagen materials. ADM materials, derived from human, porcine and bovine skin was the third collagen material studied. SAXS revealed that each species of ADM material had a slightly different collagen fibril arrangement when viewing the samples perpendicular to the surface. Human ADM was highly isotropic in arrangement, porcine was largely anisotropic, and bovine was somewhere in between the two. Bovine has a more layered fibril arrangement edge on and was the strongest material, followed by human ADM, and porcine was significantly weaker. Bovine was also the most porous material of the three. The discovery of the variations in strength, porosity and fibril arrangement between the three types of ADM materials may help medical professionals select the most suitable material for specific surgical procedures and could lead to a greater number of successful surgeries taking place...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of drying leather at 30 % {{strain on the}} tensile strength and crack resistance of the grain layer of chromium tanned <b>bovine</b> <b>leather</b> was examined. The effect of drying under different strains was also examined. Bovine wet blue splits were stretched (by 30 %) either along one axis (uniaxial) or two perpendicular axes (biaxial) and dried in this stretched condition. The strength and the fracture toughness of the resulting crust leather, was then evaluated. Drying leather under 30 % uniaxial strain resulted {{in an increase in}} the tensile strength for samples cut along the stretch axis. However the variation of tensile strength with angle of cutting the specimen with respect to the stretch axis can be described by the Tsai-Hill theory that is applicable to fibre composite materials. The essential work of fracture approach was applied {{for the first time to}} leather specimens cut both longitudinally and transversally to the stretch axis. For all the samples examined, a strong anisotropy in the fracture behaviour was observed. The fracture resistance for cracks propagating along the stretch direction in uniaxial samples was lower than in the transverse direction, this fracture anisotropy being enhanced at higher applied strains. Drying under uniaxial strains above 15 %, resulted in an increase in the fracture toughness for cracks running transversally to the strain direction, but at the same time, it seriously reduced the fracture resistance for cracks propagating along the strain direction resulting in global yielding, a phenomenon that rendered the evaluation of fracture resistance by use of essential work of fracture approach unattainable. Drying under biaxial strains above 15 % seriously reduced the fracture resistance of leather both perpendicular to and parallel to the backbone. The application of optical microscopy to observe the propagation of cracks through the grain layer led to the conclusion that drying under biaxial strain can cause a reduction in crack resistance due to changes in the size and nature of a highly orientated fibrous zone close to the crack tip. X-ray diffraction studies were made in order to relate the fracture behaviour to leather structure. The X-ray data was correlated with experimental data in order to investigate the {{influence of}} pre-stretching on the strength and hence quality of leather during manufacture and their relationship to the fibrous collagen microstructure...|$|E
