5|$|A vastly {{different}} application {{can be seen}} in the study of cognitive flexibility and video games. Examining the trait under the guise of “,” Dutch researchers observed that players of first-person shooter games (e.g. Call of Duty, Battlefield) exhibited greater “mental flexibility” on a series of measures than did non-gamers. The researchers posit that, while video game play may <b>be</b> <b>controversial</b> due to frequently graphic content, harnessing the effect of such games could lead to similar gains in various populations (e.g. the elderly, who face cognitive decline) and is therefore socially relevant.|$|E
5|$|Henry le Despenser {{continued}} to <b>be</b> <b>controversial</b> after his fighting career was over, {{mainly because of}} the vigorous methods he used to maintain control over the laity in his diocese and his own cathedral church. He defended the orthodoxy of the church against Lollardy as passionately as he defended his episcopal rights and privileges.|$|E
5|$|Offshore oil and {{gas from}} North Sea and Irish Sea, and more {{recently}} offshore wind, are significant components in Northern England's energy mix. Although deep-pit coal mining in the UK ended in 2015 with the closure of Kellingley Colliery, North Yorkshire, there are also several open-pit mines in the area. Shale gas is especially prevalent across Northern England, although plans to extract it through hydraulic fracturing ("fracking") have proven to <b>be</b> <b>controversial.</b>|$|E

5|$|Trollope {{expected}} his {{depiction of}} a fallen woman to <b>be</b> <b>controversial,</b> and unusually for him wrote a preface defending it. But the anticipated controversy never materialised, and contemporary reviewers tended to ignore that subplot, focussing instead on the courtship in the novel. Reviews were generally less than positive; many reviewers and readers who had acquired a taste for Trollope from the 1850s60s Barchester novels were unhappy about the darker tone of later novels such as this one.|$|E
5|$|College {{football}} {{maintained a}} tradition of postseason bowl games. Each bowl game {{would be associated with}} a particular conference, and earning a spot in a bowl game was the reward for winning a conference. This arrangement was profitable, but it tended to prevent the two top-ranked teams from meeting in a true national championship game, as they would normally be committed to the bowl games of their respective conferences. Several systems have been used since 1992 to determine a national champion of college football. The first was the Bowl Coalition, in place from 1992 to 1994. This was replaced in 1995 by the Bowl Alliance, which gave way in 1997 to the Bowl Championship Series (BCS). The BCS arrangement proved to <b>be</b> <b>controversial,</b> and was replaced in 2014 by the College Football Playoff (CFP).|$|E
5|$|In 1840, at {{the urging}} of Garrison and Wendell Phillips, Lucretia Coffin Mott and Elizabeth Cady Stanton {{traveled}} with their husbands and a dozen other American male and female abolitionists to London for the first World's Anti-Slavery Convention, with the expectation that a motion put forward by Phillips to include women's participation in the convention would <b>be</b> <b>controversial.</b> In London, the proposal was rebuffed after a full day of debate; the women were allowed to listen from the gallery but not allowed to speak or vote. Mott and Stanton became friends in London and on the return voyage, and together planned to organize their own convention to further the cause of women's rights, separate from abolition concerns.|$|E
50|$|Illegal sports <b>are</b> <b>controversial</b> {{due to the}} {{dangerous}} aspects attributed to them and the pain they can inflict on humans or animals. They also <b>are</b> <b>controversial</b> due to the perceived nature of some of them-notably dogfighting-as being savage sports.|$|R

5|$|In contrast, French art of {{the period}} often {{depicted}} women with low necklines and slender corsets; however, the mutilation by the French royal family of the Correggio depiction of Leda and the Swan and their apparent destruction of the famous Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo paintings of the same subject, show that nudity could <b>be</b> <b>controversial</b> in France also. In northern Europe it was seen as acceptable to portray artfully draped nudes. Examples include Rubens's Minerva Victrix, of 1622–25, which shows Marie de' Medici with an uncovered breast, and Anthony van Dyck's 1620 painting, The Duke and Duchess of Buckingham as Venus and Adonis.|$|E
5|$|Question Time is an {{opportunity}} for the British public to put questions to politicians of every ideological hue. Politicians from the UK's biggest parties appear most frequently, but from time to time representatives of parties with many fewer supporters – from the Scottish Socialists and Respect to the Green party – also take their seats on the stage. Question Time is the most prominent programme of its kind on British television, and we carefully study the support gained in elections by each of the parties, large and small, before deciding who to invite and how frequently they should appear. It is a straightforward matter of fact that, with some 6% of the vote and the election of two MEPs in this spring's European elections – and with some success in local elections as well – the BNP has demonstrated a level of support that would normally lead to an occasional invitation to join the panel on Question Time. It is for that reason – not for some misguided desire to <b>be</b> <b>controversial,</b> but for that reason alone – that the invitation has been extended.|$|E
5|$|The Singaporean anime {{community}} considered Odex's {{actions to}} <b>be</b> <b>controversial,</b> sudden, and heavy-handed—especially {{when it was}} discovered that the youngest person threatened was nine years old. In response, Odex dropped its pay-or-be-sued letter approach in favour of cease-and-desist emails to downloaders. Odex halted active enforcement after its third subpoena was rejected by the courts and lost a lawsuit when trying to obtain customer data from another ISP. In January 2008, Odex appealed the decision, and the High Court of Singapore ruled that one ISP was required to release data, but only directly to Japanese anime studios. Subsequently, these studios started their own legal actions against Singaporean downloaders. Some observers predicted that the High Court's decision would set a precedent for online privacy in Singapore by making it more difficult for copyright licensees to take legal action against downloading. The case raised issues of individual privacy, intellectual property, and free use of the Internet. Odex's actions attracted widespread criticism in Singapore and international attention and press coverage, which coincided with similar actions against consumer file sharing of music in the United States.|$|E

5000|$|As {{the status}} of Palestine as a {{political}} entity <b>is</b> <b>controversial,</b> {{the use of the}} term President to describe the leader of the Palestinian government <b>is</b> <b>controversial</b> to some, as its use may be seen to imply a recognition of state sovereignty. Until October 2006, Israel refused to use the title [...] "President" [...] for the Head of Palestine. The use of the term [...] "Chairman" [...] <b>is</b> <b>controversial</b> for the opposite reason—its use may be seen to imply denial of Palestinian aspirations for statehood.|$|R

5|$|Following {{the events}} of September 11, Bush issued an {{executive}} order authorizing the President's Surveillance Program which included allowing the NSA to monitor communications between suspected terrorists outside the U.S and parties within the U.S. without obtaining a warrant {{as required by the}} Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. As of 2009, the other provisions of the program remained highly classified. Once the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel questioned its original legal opinion that FISA did not apply in a time of war, the program was subsequently re-authorized by the President on the basis that the warrant requirements of FISA were implicitly superseded by the subsequent passage of the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists. The program proved to <b>be</b> <b>controversial,</b> as critics of the administration, as well as organizations such as the American Bar Association, argued that it was illegal. In August 2006, a U.S. district court judge ruled that the NSA electronic surveillance program was unconstitutional, but on July 6, 2007, that ruling was vacated by the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit {{on the grounds that the}} plaintiffs lacked standing. On January 17, 2007, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales informed U.S. Senate leaders that the program would not be reauthorized by the President, but would be subjected to judicial oversight. Later in 2007, the NSA launched a replacement for the program, referred to as PRISM, that was subject to the oversight of the United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. This program was not publicly revealed until reports by The Washington Post and The Guardian emerged in June 2013.|$|E
