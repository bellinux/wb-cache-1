5|$|In the 2007 book, Currency Wars by Chinese {{economist}} Song Hongbing, {{the term}} is sometimes used in a somewhat contrary sense, to refer to an alleged practice where unscrupulous bankers lend to emerging market countries and then speculate against the emerging state's currency <b>by</b> <b>trying</b> to force it down in value against the wishes of that states' government.|$|E
5|$|On the {{one hand}} he must not enforce {{whatever}} he thinks best; he must leave that to the common will expressed by the government.

5|$|Convinced {{now that}} the Greeks (and {{therefore}} {{the rest of the}} region) would not have peace if left alone, Rome decided to establish its first permanent foothold in the Greek world, and divided the Kingdom of Macedonia into four client republics. Yet, Macedonian agitation continued. The Fourth Macedonian War, 150 to 148 BC, was fought against a Macedonian pretender to the throne who was again destabilizing Greece <b>by</b> <b>trying</b> to re-establish the old kingdom. The Romans swiftly defeated the Macedonians at the Second battle of Pydna.|$|E
5|$|Groza {{lettered}} in football, basketball, {{and baseball}} at Martins Ferry High School. The Purple Riders {{won the state}} basketball championship in 1941, when Groza was its captain.

5|$|Kennedy was {{admitted}} to the Massachusetts Bar in 1959. In 1960, his brother John ran for President of the United States and Ted managed his campaign in the Western states. Ted learned to fly and during the Democratic primary campaign he barnstormed around the western states, meeting with delegates and bonding with them <b>by</b> <b>trying</b> his hand at ski jumping and bronc riding. The seven weeks he spent in Wisconsin helped his brother win the first contested primary of the season there and a similar time spent in Wyoming was rewarded when a unanimous vote from that state's delegates put his brother over the top at the 1960 Democratic National Convention.|$|E
5|$|Modern writers {{also argue}} that Black has certain countervailing advantages. The {{consensus}} that White should try to win can be a psychological burden for the white player, who sometimes loses <b>by</b> <b>trying</b> too hard to win. Some symmetrical openings (i.e. those where both players make the same moves) can lead to situations where moving first is a disadvantage, either for psychological or objective reasons.|$|E
5|$|The Manchester Small-Scale Experimental Machine (SSEM), {{also known}} as the Baby, was {{designed}} as a test-bed for the Williams tube, an early form of computer memory, rather than as a practical computer. Work on the machine began in 1947, and on 21 June 1948 the computer successfully ran its first program, consisting of 17 instructions written to find the highest proper factor of 218 (262,144) <b>by</b> <b>trying</b> every integer from 218 − 1 downwards. The program ran for 52minutes before producing the correct answer of 131,072.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} match pitted The Undertaker against A-Train in {{a standard}} match. In the early stages both competitors wrestled inconclusively before The Undertaker gained the advantage. He attempted to lift A-Train for a Tombstone piledriver. A-Train countered it, in the process knocking the referee down. He attempted {{to take advantage of}} the situation <b>by</b> <b>trying</b> to hit The Undertaker with a steel chair. The Undertaker, however, countered the attack with his boot, causing the chair to hit A-Train in the face. The Undertaker then chokeslammed A-Train and, since the referee had recuperated, covered his opponent for the pinfall.|$|E
5|$|Three {{programs}} were {{written for the}} computer. The first, consisting of 17instructions, was written by Kilburn, and so far as can be ascertained first ran on 21 June 1948. It was designed to find the highest proper factor of 218 (262,144) <b>by</b> <b>trying</b> every integer from 218−1 downwards. The divisions were implemented by repeated subtractions of the divisor. The SSEM took 3.5million operations and 52minutes to produce the answer (131,072). The program used eight words of working storage {{in addition to its}} 17words of instructions, giving a program size of 25words.|$|E

5|$|Awake {{centers on}} Michael Britten (Isaacs), a detective living in two {{separate}} realities after a car crash. In one reality, in which he wears a red wristband, his wife Hannah Britten (Laura Allen) survived the collision, and in another reality, in which he wears a green wristband, his son Rex Britten (Dylan Minnette) survived. In this episode, Michael passes out during a bungee jump while he is at a carnival with Rex and Emma (Daniela Bobadilla). He is unable to switch realities, consistently hallucinates and realizes that Ed Hawkins (Kevin Weisman), a detective who is working with Michael's former partner Bird (Steve Harris), was attempting to kill him in the crash. Meanwhile, Hannah deals with Emma's new baby <b>by</b> <b>trying</b> to convince her parents to let her keep the baby.|$|E
5|$|Bartolomé de las Casas spent 50 {{years of}} his life {{actively}} fighting slavery and the violent colonial abuse of indigenous peoples, especially <b>by</b> <b>trying</b> to convince the Spanish court to adopt a more humane policy of colonization. Unlike the other priests who sought to destroy all of the indigenous peoples native books and writings, he was strictly opposed to this action. Although he failed to save the indigenous peoples of the Western Indies, his efforts resulted in several improvements in the legal status of the natives, and in an increased colonial focus on the ethics of colonialism. Las Casas is often seen {{as one of the first}} advocates for universal conception of human dignity (later human rights).|$|E
5|$|By 1988, Searchlight {{reported}} that the party's membership had declined to around 1,000. Tyndall responded <b>by</b> <b>trying</b> to raise finances, calling for greater sales of their newspaper and increasing the price of membership by 50%. He also promised {{that he would make}} the BNP the largest extreme-right group in the UK and that he would establish a professional headquarters for the party. This was achieved in 1989, as a party headquarters was opened in Welling, Southeast London, an area chosen because it was a recipient of significant 'white flight' from inner London. That year also witnessed the BNP become the most prominent force on the British far-right as the NF collapsed amid internal arguments and schisms.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{top secret}} nature of the work, the Los Alamos Laboratory was isolated. Feynman indulged his curiosity by {{discovering}} the combination locks on cabinets and desks used to secure papers. He found that people tended to leave their safes unlocked, or leave them on the factory settings, or write the combinations down, or use easily guessable combinations like dates. Feynman played jokes on colleagues. In one case he found the combination to a locked filing cabinet <b>by</b> <b>trying</b> the numbers he thought a physicist would use (it proved to be 27–18–28 after the base of natural logarithms, e = 2.71828...), {{and found that the}} three filing cabinets where a colleague kept a set of atomic bomb research notes all had the same combination. He left a series of notes in the cabinets as a prank, which initially spooked his colleague, Frederic de Hoffmann, into thinking a spy or saboteur had gained access to atomic bomb secrets.|$|E
5|$|In 1817, John Wood died in {{the midst}} of a {{financial}} scandal, and Bute decided to appoint two of his rivals to the posts of Constable and Cardiff's Town Clerk. This would have reaffirmed Bute's power to change the appointments and broken the Wood's family hold on local power, but it provoked a storm of local political wrangling. The Wood family turned on Bute, arguing that he should abandon his claims to control local Welsh affairs from Scotland. Bute replied <b>by</b> <b>trying</b> to crush the Wood family's bank and stacking the town council with his appointees in early 1818. The Woods successfully took legal action, challenging Bute's authority to take these actions, and anti-Bute violence flared that summer, resulting in arrests by Special Constables appointed by Bute. The pro-Bute faction in Cardiff rallied and the Woods were defeated at the Parliamentary elections that year, the results reaffirming Bute's authority over the town council.|$|E
5|$|Myrmecia ants deter many {{potential}} predators {{due to their}} sting. The blindsnake Ramphotyphlops nigrescens consumes the larvae and pupae of Myrmecia, while avoiding the potent sting of the adults, which it is vulnerable to. The short-beaked echidna (Tachyglossus aculeatus) also eats the eggs and larvae. Nymphs of the assassin bug species Ptilocnemus lemur lure these ants to themselves <b>by</b> <b>trying</b> to make the ant sting them, by waving its hind legs around to attract a potential prey item. Body remains of Myrmecia {{have been found in}} the stomach contents of the eastern yellow robin (Eopsaltria australis). The Australian magpie (Gymnorhina tibicen), the black currawong (Strepera versicolor), and the white-winged chough (Corcorax melanorhamphos) prey on these ants, but few are successfully taken.|$|E
