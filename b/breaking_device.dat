5000|$|Kénôse {{draws on}} a range of {{theological}} and philosophical themes.The title Kénôse means Kenosis in French, a theological term which describes [...] "the 'self-emptying' of one's own will and becoming entirely receptive to God's divine will." [...] In particular it refers to the notion within Christology that God emptied himself of his divine characteristics in order to be made manifest as a mortal being in the form of Christ. One analysis of this term draws on The Anxiety of Influence by Harold Bloom, which defines the term in two senses:"…a <b>breaking</b> <b>device</b> similar to the defense mechanisms our psyches employ against repetition compulsions; kenosis then is a movement toward discontinuity with the precursor. From St. Paul, who uses the term in regard to Jesus’ empties the divine out of himself to assume human form. Similarly the poet empties out the poetic afflatus of the precursor. The precursor too is emptied out."One of the main themes of the record is a pursuit of the essence or substance of God and Christ in the light of Kenosis. The band ask whether, on Christ's death and return to immortality, God's essence remained as pure as it was before, or indeed whether he has [...] "succumbed to the original malady": death. The lyrics form an argument against the concept of redemption; holding that humanity is irredeemable, and instead invoking plerosis, a blasphemous flowering of humanity's carnal condition in spite of God. The issue of hypostasis and hypostatic union is discussed at length, with the opening track's lyrics asking:"Was there not an inconceivable loss of knowledge at Bethlehem? Christ's abasement, His subjecting Himself to the laws of Human birth and growth and to the lowliness of fallen human nature... Did the Son remain the transcendent Logos, is there not a radical and fatal discontinuity between the consciousness of the transcendent Logos and the secular Jesus?"The opening track's lyrics also quote from Philippians 2:5-8 in defence of this claim. The very first line of the record is a quote from The Great Chain of Being by Arthur Lovejoy which reads [...] "Everything, except GOD, has in itself some measure of privation, thus all individuals may be graded according to {{the degree to which they}} are infected with mere potentiality". Thus the EP seeks to show the debasement of Christ through his incarnation as a fragile mortal. It also references Georges Bataille's Base Materialism, as well as a motet for use during the Adoration of the Cross on Good Friday. The second track, II, quotes Martin Luther that [...] "Therefore God honours the sword" [...] from Whether Soldiers, Too, Can Be Saved (1526) in which Luther defends war on religious grounds and describes soldiers as God's instrument. The full quote is:"Therefore, God honors the sword so highly that He calls it His own ordinance, and will not have men say or imagine that they have invented it or instituted it. For the hand that wields this sword and slays with it is then no more man's hand, but God's, and it is not man but God, who hangs, tortures, beheads, slays and fights. All these are His work and His judgments..." ...|$|E

It directly influences the stubble breading effect, and even the performance of the complete machine. By the 3 D parametric modeling software Pro/Engineer, 3 D solid modeling of the stubble breaking device’s parts was carried out. And the parts were assembled into the assembly with pro/E. Then finite element analysis of the strain and stress on the key part (the ripple disc sickle) has been carried out.

50|$|Referred to as {{assisted}} braking, or incorrectly as 'auto-locking', {{under the}} right conditions these devices use a sudden load on the rope to engage a camming mechanism (known as mechanically assisted <b>breaking</b> <b>devices)</b> or pull the belay carabiner into a pinch point (known as geometrically assisted <b>breaking</b> <b>devices)</b> to prevent the rope from passing through the belay device. Use of such belay devices should never be instructed as self- or auto-locking, but as assisted braking. There do exist rare conditions where these devices' braking functions may not apply correctly, though accident statistics show that these incidents are often user-error. An icy, muddy, worn, too-thin of a rope, or possibly other conditions, such as insufficient training and experience, may affect a device's braking function.|$|R

40|$|The European Emission Trading Scheme (EU-ETS) {{has chosen}} to adopt an {{auctioning}} procedure to initially allocate CO 2 emission permits. Free allocation of permits becomes an exception for the third phase (2013 - 2020) and firms have to buy all their permits on the market or via auctions. The ability of bidders to collude is a key concern about {{the design of the}} auction format. To counter the bidding ring, the auction can be open to bidders without compliance obligations (speculators). This paper aims at studying experimentally speculation as a collusion <b>breaking</b> <b>device</b> in two different auction mechanisms: the uniform price sealed bid auction and the ascending clock auction. Our results suggest that a uniform sealed bid auction open to speculators should be chosen from a revenue maximization point of view. In this mechanism, compliance agents are adopting an outbidding strategy toward speculators. This strategy significantly increases the seller’s revenue, compared to the more collusive clock auction. In this one, on the contrary, bidders accommodate speculators, letting them buy permits in the auction and buying their necessary permits on the secondary market. However, as opening the auction to speculators deteriorates efficiency, the regulator faces a trade-off between these two objectives...|$|E

It is frequently encountered at crime scenes, particularly those involving motor vehicle accidents or burglaries. This study emphasized on the examination of the fracture patterns performed on different types of glass panes after broken by different type of impact objects, analysis of fracture features to determine direction of force and identifying of refractive index of glass as further analysis. Three types of glass panes (float, tempered and laminated) and four levels of <b>breaking</b> <b>devices</b> (hammer, bat, golf ball and stone either by throwing or using catapult) were used in the experiment. The results show that almost the whole float glass panes were shatters into sharp glass pieces after broken by all type of <b>breaking</b> <b>devices.</b> Then, tempered glass pane was broken with the whole glass panes shatters into small pieces of blunt granules when only hammer exerted on the glass, meanwhile, for other <b>breaking</b> <b>devices</b> were caused a scratch marks on glass surface. For laminated glass when broken by bat, throwing a stone and using catapult, almost the whole of glass panes were remains intact on its interlayer film and got some splinters from point of impact were flying out. Meanwhile, fracture patterns on laminated glass pane when broken by hammer produced a cone or crater after striking. However, impact objects used to break those types of glass panes are not really reliable to be distinguished. This is because the fracture patterns on glass panes obviously differ by its types of glass only. When a pane of glass is broken by an impact, majority of the broken fragments will fall in the direction of the force, which is on the side of the glass panes opposite direction of the application of force. A determination of the direction of force in breaking a glass pane can be determined by the direction of the rib marks. As the impact occurs, concentric fractures form around the impact and interconnect with radial cracks to form triangular pieces. The edge of each triangular piece has visible stress lines that describe the direction of the blow. The refractive index of each type of glass was determined by GRIM 3 equipment which produce results of refractive index for float glass panes are about 1. 5200; tempered glass panes are about 1. 5181 and, laminated glass panes are about 1. 5188...|$|R

ROP {{is low in}} drilling these rocks, and drilling cycle is long, which seriously affect the process of exploration and development in the Carboniferous reservoir. Considering the igneous rock formation characteristics and the drilling problems, using PDC impregnated diamond high strength, super abrasion as the main rock <b>breaking</b> <b>device,</b> {{a new type of}} cutting and grinding of diamond impregnated bit was developed. This bit has the following characteristics: Compound cutting structure with blades and cylindrical Impregnated cutters; big nozzle in the center + deep radiation water slot hydraulic structures; Natural diamond and TSP lengthened gauge design; Selection of 40 / 50 mesh diamond grit, mix two kinds of inserts with diamond concentration 70 %. The bit has the combination of impregnated bit and PDC drill bit technical advantages, which improve the bit adaptability to the formations. Hassan 3 Carboniferous igneous formations field test shows that: average ROP is 0. 71 m / h, single bit footage is 86. 5 m, which increased by about 20 % and 302 % respectively compared with high efficient three-roller bits. The success usage of this bit in Hassan 3 provide an effective means for high quality fast drilling in Junggar Basin igneous rock formation...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{informal and}} corruptive activities agents may pursue within organisations. Chapter 1 {{is a brief}} introduction to the general theme and the related literature. Chapter 2 develops a simple theory of non-monetary collusion, where agents collude by exchanging favours. It examines the optimal use of supervisory information in a simple hierarchy under potential collusion. It is shown that when only the supervisor's information about the agent is used, collusion does not arise, since favours can not be exchanged. Secondly, it is analysed whether the agent's information about his superior should be used. In this case collusion is possible, {{and there is an}} interesting trade-off between the benefits of using additional information and the costs of collusion. It is then shown that sometimes the principal may be better off when using less than all available information. Chapter 3 considers task assignment and whistle-blowing as measures a principal may use to break collusion. The principal's response to potential collusion is to allocate less time to monitoring, and he breaks collusion with money. It is shown that the principal may also break collusion by hiring a third worker, and the decision how to break collusion optimally is endogenously determined. Breaking collusion by task assignment is costly, and therefore we consider whistle-blowing as a collusion <b>breaking</b> <b>device.</b> It provides the principal strictly higher welfare than the collusion-proof solution. It is also shown that under reasonable conditions, the collusion-free outcome will be achieved with no further cost. Chapter 4 develops a model of blackmail, where a piece of information an agent prefers to keep private may facilitate blackmail when another agent, namely a blackmailer, threatens to reveal that information. The crucial feature of the blackmail game is the commitment problem from the blackmailer's side. The blackmailer can not commit not to come back in future to demand more despite the payments received in the past. The chapter outlines conditions under which successful extortion may arise, and shows that there is a unique Markov Perfect Equilibrium, which gives a precise prediction how much money the blackmailer is able to extort from the victim. It is also shown that the blackmailer receives a blackmail premium that compensates the blackmailer for not taking money from the victim and revealing information anyway...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{phenomenon}} of arcing {{is the major}} cause of electrical contact degradation in electrical switches. Degradation involves contact erosion and/or welding. The use of special contact material and that of specific material processing may permit contact erosion to be reduced, in particular by shortening the arc duration. A short review of these approaches {{is presented in the}} first part of this paper. In the second part, the development of a new self-blowing contact material is described. This material has been tested under dc voltages from 14 V to 42 V. A reduction of the arc duration by a factor of 4 approximately was obtained as was a concomitant reduction of the extinction gap to less than 2 mm. This material will contribute to achieving better reliability in high current-high voltages <b>breaking</b> <b>devices,</b> and will aid in their miniaturization, e. g. in relays...|$|R
30|$|The {{most common}} {{practice}} in the foam destruction {{is the use of}} antifoam chemicals and mechanical foam <b>breaking</b> <b>devices.</b> However, these steps add to the complexity as well as cost of the downstream process and are insufficient for foam destruction in vigorously foaming biosurfactant systems (Winterburn and Martin 2012). Research efforts regarding biosurfactant production processes have been directed towards development of more effective downstream processes. For this reason, there is an interest in utilizing controlled foaming in biosurfactant fermentation systems through the application of foam separation techniques (Chen et al. 2006 a). One of the emerging technologies applied for this purpose leverages the native partitioning of surface active compounds into foam fractions during fermentation processes and is termed the foam fractionation method. Foam fractionation is a process whereby dissolved or colloidal material is selectively adsorbed on the surface of rising bubbles and then is partially segregated by the foam (Lemlich 1972).|$|R

40|$|The DC-side line faults in {{high-voltage}} direct-current (HVDC) systems utilising voltage-source converters (VSCs) are a {{major concern}} for multi-terminal HVDC systems in which complete isolation of the faulted system is not a viable option. A number of challenges are posed by both pole-to-pole and pole-to-ground faults including the presence of very fast and high amplitude discharge current from the DC-link capacitance, the lack of suitable DC current <b>breaking</b> <b>devices,</b> {{and the lack of}} highly discriminative fault detection techniques. Therefore, faults occurring along the interconnecting DC cables are likely to threaten system operation.

This investigation provides a systematic evaluation of the nature of a DC fault in HVDC systems during a permanent pole- to-pole and pole-to-ground fault taking into consideration a number of inﬂuencing parameters including fault position, fault resistance and other operational conditions. To quantify these dependencies on DC voltage and current characteristics a systematic simulation study is undertaken in which the natural responses of the HVDC networks transients during DC side faults are examined. The outcome of this paper lies the necessary knowledge foundation for developing future DC protection methods...|$|R
