25|$|MSF uses foods {{designed}} specifically for treatment of severe malnutrition. During phase 1, a type of therapeutic milk called F-75 is fed to patients. F-75 is a relatively low energy, low fat/protein milk powder that must be mixed with water and given to patients to prepare their bodies for phase 2. During phase 2, therapeutic milk called F-100, which is higher in energy/fat/protein content than F-75, is given to patients, usually along with a peanut <b>butter</b> <b>mixture</b> called Plumpy'nut. F-100 and Plumpy'nut are designed to quickly provide large amounts of nutrients so that patients can be treated efficiently. Other special food fed to populations in danger of starvation includes enriched flour and porridge, {{as well as a}} high protein biscuit called BP5. BP5 is a popular food for treating populations because it can be distributed easily and sent home with individuals, or it can be crushed and mixed with therapeutic milk for specific treatments.|$|E

40|$|Three {{experiments}} were performed during spring 2004, {{to develop a}} method to elevate the blood plasma level of 11 -ketotestosterone (11 -KT) in male brood stock of spotted wolffish Anarhichas minor, and to {{study the effects of}} 11 -KT on sperm production. Intraperitoneal implantation of silastic capsules containing 11 -KT - coconut <b>butter</b> <b>mixture</b> and 11 -KT - sesame oil mixture and intramuscular injection of 11 -KT – propylene glycol mixture were tested. Blood plasma 11 -KT levels were quantified by radioimmunoassay. Low and medium doses (c. 0. 09 mg/kg and c. 0. 18 mg/kg) of 11 - KT-coconut <b>butter</b> <b>mixture</b> administered in silastic capsules did not elevate the plasma 11 -KT levels. High dose (c. 0. 37 mg/kg) of 11 -KT – coconut <b>butter</b> <b>mixture</b> gave an increase (6. 48 ± 1. 89 ng/ml) of about 3 times pretreatment level (1. 83 ± 0. 36 ng/ml) for one week. 11 -KT- sesame oil mixture (1 mg/kg dose) elevated the plasma 11 -KT levels (22. 58 ± 4. 69 ng/ml) compared to the controls (14. 98 ± 3. 45 ng/ml) for one week. Silastic capsule implants did not maintain the elevation more than one week irrespective of dose or vehicle (coconut butter, sesame oil). Intramuscular injection of 11 -KT dissolved in propylene glycol (1 mg/kg) elevated plasma 11 -KT (99. 16 ± 56. 04 ng/ml) to about 12 times the level of the controls (7. 44 ± 2. 04 ng/ml), and was identified as a more effective method than silastic capsule implantation. Sperm production was studied by examining milt volume, spermatocrit, milt pH and motility of sperm. 11 -KT treatment with intramuscular injection significantly increased milt volume. Mean milt volumes in treatment and control groups were 14. 26 ± 4. 2 ml and 4. 73 ± 2. 8 ml respectively. 11 -KT treatment had no significant effects on spermatocrit, which was very low (2 - 4 %) in both treatment and control fish. Total sperm cell volume in milt was significantly high in treatment group. There {{were no significant differences in}} milt pH and sperm motility between 11 -KT treatment and control groups.

40|$|An {{important}} {{indicator of}} the metabolic capacity of humans {{is the ability to}} regulate plasma triacylglycerol levels and to clear triacylglycerol-rich lipoproteins (TRLs) from the circulation after a meal. This is crucial since most of the day is spent in the postprandial state. High concentrations and long circulation times of TRL remnants may be detrimental since these are considered to be highly atherogenic. Postprandial effects of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) in men and women are poorly characterized. A new ALA-rich oil was produced from rapeseed and linseed oil by enzymatic interesterification. The postprandial effects of 3 meals containing 35 g of this new ALA-rich oil, olive oil, or butter were compared in two randomized crossover studies (26 men and 19 premenopausal women). Blood samples were drawn at regular intervals up to 7 h after the meals. We hypothesized that the postprandial lipid response might be attenuated by a preferential oxidation of ALA compared to other long chain dietary fatty acids. Premenopausal women showed lower postprandial lipemia and were less sensitive to variations in dietary fat than men. Butter resulted in lower postprandial lipemia than the oils in men, whereas no such difference was seen in the women. The ALA oil and olive oil meals induced similar plasma triacylglycerol concentrations. Women showed significantly lower NEFA responses after the olive oil and butter meals than men. The ALA-rich oil had significant effects on the different plasma lipid fractions and decreased the n- 6 :n- 3 ratio in plasma several hours postprandially. ALA levels remained high in plasma triacylglycerols and NEFA even after 5 - 7 h. This late high concentration of ALA in NEFA is indicative of spill-over NEFA and/or preferential release of ALA by the adipose tissue into the circulation. In summary we did thus not find evidence that ALA has a beneficial effect on postprandial lipids by a selective partitioning to oxidation. This does not exclude the possibility that ALA over a longer time period may have health effects not only as precursor of longer chain n- 3 fatty, primarily docosahexaenoic acid, but also because it is sorted out for oxidation. The enzymatic interesterification of triacylglycerols using immobilized Thermomyces lanuginosus lipase (Lipozyme TL IM) as catalyst has also been investigated. Three different reaction systems were studied: rapeseed oil + butter, rapeseed oil + linseed oil (ALA oil), and trilaurin + 1, 3 -palmitin- 2 -olein. The ALA oil (35 % ALA) was the same as that used in the meal studies. All reactions were followed by reversed-phase HPLC and the triacylglycerol peaks were tentatively identified by calculating equivalent carbon numbers. The triacylglycerols in the rapeseed oil + <b>butter</b> <b>mixture</b> and products were also identified by HPLC-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry. In ideal sn- 1, 3 -specific lipase-catalyzed interesterification, the fatty acid composition in the sn- 2 position remains constant. In practice, however, slight changes are observed in the sn- 2 position and, under certain conditions, a completely randomized fatty acid distribution can be obtained. Randomization is slower than interesterification. Uncontrolled hydrolysis should, however, be avoided as it lowers the TAG yield. Different triacylglycerol mixtures, i. e. products originating from 1, 3 -specific interesterification as well as totally or partially randomized products, can be produced by varying the reaction time. Enzymatic interesterification {{could be used as a}} method of designing dietary oils with new properties regarding fatty acid composition, susceptibility to oxidation and effects on blood lipids. The future of enzymatic processes relies on efficient, flexible, and easy-to-use systems that ensure high stability of the enzyme preparation and stable output of high-quality products at a reasonable cost...|$|E

50|$|According to this theory, storage bloom is due {{to phase}} {{separation}} of the triglycerides within the crystalline structure of cocoa butter. This theory {{is based on the}} fact that <b>butter</b> is a <b>mixture</b> of diverse triglycerides and each type of triglyceride has a unique melting temperature. At higher temperatures, the lower melting point triglycerides in cocoa butter will melt and this liquid phase occupies a greater volume than the solid. The liquid phase will then be squeezed out to the surface through fissures or pores in the chocolate. After the liquid phase reaches the surface, the triglycerides will recrystallize into the less stable form (alpha crystals), with bloom occurring.|$|R

25|$|To make hollandaise sauce, {{the eggs}} yolks are {{separated}} {{and added to}} a butter base with small amounts of water, vinegar or lemon juice with pepper, heated together slowly over a double boiler. A stainless steel bowl over a sauce pan {{with a small amount}} of water may also be used. The water should not touch the bowl or boil, just simmer. The key to the recipe is to heat the ingredients without curdling the egg. Add the egg and liquid ingredients first and whisk together with a wire whisk until frothy. Add the egg and liquid froth to the double boiler of the simmering water and whisk quickly and continuously. The mixture will expand a few times. Remove from the heat source and begin adding warm, melted, clarified <b>butter</b> to the <b>mixture.</b> If the sauce cools too much the butter will begin to thicken.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop, produce and optimize new chestnut-based chips. The effect of three ingredients, lipids (x 1), glucose syrup (x 2) and albumin (x 3), was investigated in a mixture experiment. The sum of the component proportions (x 1 + x 2 + x 3) was always equal to one. Experimental design points were determined by the extreme vertices design. The effect of three different lipids (palm oil, <b>butter</b> and a <b>mixture</b> of maize oil and margarine) was also investigated. Quantitative descriptive analysis was performed by eight trained judges who evaluated nine sensory attributes. ANOVA results showed that varying the levels of ingredients does not affect adhesiveness, oily mouth coating or astringency. All the other attributes (colour, crispness, hardness, oiliness, sweetness and chestnut flavour) were used as response variables in regression models built to determine the optimal levels of ingredients. Contour plots for sensory attributes and lipid type were generated and superimposed to determine areas of overlap. Optimal conditions were generated by setting the best sensory performance as a goal for each response. Three optimal formulations were found for each lipid, two of which were used for a consumer test to evaluate chip acceptability...|$|R
40|$|Shea {{butter is}} a plant fat {{extracted}} from kernels of shea nuts, {{the seeds of}} shea trees (Vitellaria paradoxa). The extracted fat, which {{has a long history}} of use in sub-Saharan Africa for medicinal, culinary, and other applications, serves as cocoa butter equivalents (CBEs) in the manufacture of chocolate and is an ingredient for cosmetics in the international market. Since shea butter contains relatively high levels of unsaturated fatty acids (more than 50 %), oxidation can occur during extraction and during post-harvest processing and storage. This study investigated the protective effects of synthetic butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and selected natural antioxidants (rosmarinic acid and gallic acid) on shea butter against oxidation. Each antioxidant (0. 02 %) was added to shea <b>butter</b> and the <b>mixtures</b> were placed at 90 °C for 0, 72, and 144 h to accelerate oxidation. Measures of oxidation indicated the shea butter was protected from oxidation by addition of the antioxidants.

40|$|The {{postprandial}} metabolism {{of dietary}} fats produces triacylglycerol (TG) -rich lipoproteins (TRL) that could interact with circulating cells. We investigated whether {{the ratios of}} oleic:palmitic acid and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) :SFA in the diet affect the ratio of TG:cholesterol (CHOL) in postprandial TRL of healthy men. The ability of postprandial TRL at 3 h (early postprandial period) and 5 h (late postprandial period) to affect cell viability and cycle in the THP- 1 human monocytic cell line was also determined. In a randomized, crossover experiment, 14 healthy volunteers (Caucasian men) ate meals enriched (50 g/m 2 body surface area) in refined olive oil, high-palmitic sunflower oil, <b>butter,</b> and a <b>mixture</b> of vegetable and fish oils, which had ratios of oleic:palmitic acid (MUFA:SFA) of 6. 83 (5. 43), 2. 36 (2. 42), 0. 82 (0. 48), and 13. 81 (7. 08), respectively. The ratio of TG:CHOL in postprandial TRL was inversely correlated (r = 3 D 9 ̆ 60. 89 to 9 ̆ 60. 99) with the ratio of oleic:palmitic acid and with the MUFA:SFA ratio in the dietary fats (P < 0. 05). Postprandial TRL at 3 h preferentially increased the proportion of necrotic cells, whereas postprandial TRL at 5 h increased the proportion of apoptotic cells (P < 0. 05). Cell cycle analysis showed that postprandial TRL blocked the human monocytes in S-phase. Our {{findings suggest that the}} level of TG and CHOL into postprandial TRL is associated with the ratios of oleic:palmitic acid and MUFA:SFA in dietary fats, which determines the ability of postprandial TRL to induce cytotoxicity and disturb the cell cycle in THP- 1 cells...|$|R
40|$|Prescribed burning is an {{important}} tool for maintaining prairies, and it is used with the tall grass prairies on Cooper Farm. There are two categories of this prescribed burning: dormant season burning occurs in late fall or early spring while growing season burning occurs in the late summer. Both types of burning accomplish the same task of reducing the area of woody growth and helping to renew and encourage the further development of nutrients in the area. Small mammals can be indicative of the environment's health, in this study, small mammals were trapped in plots on Cooper Farm where half had been burned during the dormant season {{and the other half}} burned during the growing season {{in order to determine the}} success of these burning strategies. Trapping occurred from September 28 th to November 4 th of 2015 in a total of 11 trapping sessions. Each trapping session consisted of three days during which two prairie plots were set up with fifty Sherman traps placed in a grid pattern in two prairie plots. In addition to these two grids, a transect of 24 Sherman traps was placed in a third prairie plot for each trapping session. In this transect, 12 pairs of traps were strategically placed where one of each pair contained a peanut <b>butter</b> and oatmeal <b>mixture</b> bait and the other trap contained a seed only bait. Two objectives were examined: to determine differences in small mammal capture rates in prairie plots exposed to dormant season burns and prairie plots exposed to growing season burns as well as to determine the bait preference of small mammals. A two-sample t-test showed no difference in capture rates of dormant season and growing season burns. Another two-sample t-test also showed no difference in bait preference.

40|$|International audienceThe use of {{supercritical}} {{carbon dioxide}} technology for lipid processing has recently developed {{at the expense of}} traditional processes. For designing new processes the knowledge of thermophysical properties is a prerequisite. This work is focused on the characterization of physical and thermodynamic properties of CO 2 -cocoa <b>butter</b> (CB) saturated <b>mixture.</b> Measurements of density, volumetric expansion, viscosity and CO 2 solubility were carried out on CB-rich phase at 313 and 353 K and pressures up to 40 MPa. The experimental techniques have previously been compared and validated. Density measurements of CB and CB saturated with CO 2, were performed using the vibrating tube technology at pressures ranging from 0. 1 to 25 MPa. Experimental values correlated well with the modified Tait equation. CO 2 solubility measurements were coupled to those of density in the same pressures ranges. At 25 MPa, the solubility of CO 2 is 31. 4 % and 28. 7 % at 313 and 353 K. Phase behaviour was investigated using a view cell in order to follow the expansion of the CB-rich phase with the rise in pressure. Volumetric expansion up to 47 % was measured and correlated to the CO 2 solubility. Phase inversion was observed at 313 K and 40 MPa. Lastly, we developed an innovative falling ball viscometer for high pressure measurements. Viscosity measurements were carried out up to 25 MPa showing a viscosity reduction up to 90 % upon CO 2 dissolution. These results were correlated with two empirical models. A new model here presented, was favourably compared with the Grunberg and Nissan model. All the experimental results are consistent with the available literature data for the CB-CO 2 mixture and other fat systems. This work is a new contribution to the characterization of physical and thermodynamic behaviour of fats in contact with CO 2 which is necessary to design supercritical fluid processes for fats processing...|$|R
