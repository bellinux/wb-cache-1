50|$|A {{mistake that}} is often made in {{purchasing}} bearings is that spending more translates to more speed. Generally, clean inline skate bearings contribute about 2% of the rolling resistance that the best urethane inline skate wheels produce, so {{there is very little}} opportunity in improving speed by spending more money on bearings. Newer bearings on the market have been offered that use ceramic <b>ball</b> <b>bearings</b> instead of <b>steel,</b> which are more expensive than traditional <b>steel</b> <b>bearings</b> but made of harder material.|$|R

40|$|Most {{low alloy}} steels are {{tempered}} at relatively low temperatures, limiting the opportunities for improving their wear resistance and surface hardness by traditional heat treatment processes. In this work, we use plasma immersion ion implantation (PI 3) to apply a hybrid ion implantation/thermochemical diffusion treatment to <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>steel</b> 100 Cr 6 (1 % C, 1. 5 % Cr). By a judicious choice of implantation voltage, temperature and time, {{it is possible to}} combine the PI 3 treatment with the tempering stage of heat treatment, without compromising the hardness of the alloy. Up to 200 &# 0176;C, the bulk hardness (750 HV tempered) of the material is maintained, and nitrogen implantation increases the surface hardness due to the precipitation of fine Fe 2 N. At 300 &# 0176;C, where enhanced nitrogen and carbon diffusion can occur, the bulk hardness decreases, although in many applications this can be compensated by the increase in surface hardness to around 900 HV 0. 1 due to Fe 3 N and Fe 4 N formation. Wear and corrosion tests reveal significant improvements in comparison with untreated steel...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Experimental {{investigation}} of residual stresses after heat treatment and grinding {{processes in the}} production of ball bearing rings has been carried out. The residual stresses were measured by X-ray diffraction method utilizing chromium radiation, which has an average penetration depth of 5 µm incident on 100 Cr 6 (AISI-E 52100) <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>steel.</b> The process parameters of heat treatment and grinding processes were varied so as to represent the extreme values that can be applied in the respective processes. Hardness and percent retained austenite limit the heat treatment process parameters; while roundness, surface roughness and form the grinding process. Tensile surface residual stresses on the raceway of ball bearing rings changes to compression after grinding in both circumferential and axial directions. In grinding relatively higher compressive stresses were measured in axial direction compared to the circumferential direction. This experimental investigation also showed that the influence of heat treatment process parameters on the magnitude and distribution of residual stresses survived even after grinding process; i. e. heat treatment and grinding processes cannot be evaluated independently in process design for favourable residual stresses...|$|E

40|$|Diamond like carbon (DLC or a-C:H) {{coatings}} {{can help}} to solve friction and wear problems. The improvement of coatings {{can help to}} solve friction and wear problems. The improvement of coatings can be steered {{on the base of}} tribological laboratory tests. An often used method is a gross slip fretting test (cyclic motion) with a ball-on-flat configuration. A meaningful tribological characterisation of coatings at room temperature has to take into account effects of humidity and ball material. The friction and wear behaviour of different carbon based coatings with and without metal doping was investigated at RT in dry, normal and moist air, respectively. Counter bodies were <b>balls</b> of <b>bearing</b> <b>steel</b> and ceramic (Al 2 O 3 and Si 3 N 4). The lowest friction is found for a-C:H and a-C:H:C, metal doped coatings show higher friction and reduced wear resistance.

Four fatigue failures were detected by accelerometers in this test set.

The testing against the same counterpart at higher temperature gave positive effect of the silver addition on the friction coefficient. The testing against 100 Cr 6 <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>steel</b> gave higher friction coefficient than that against alumina while the testing against CuSn 6 -bronze led to much lower μ. When tested at a room temperature, the wear performance of the films was positively affected only {{in the case of the}} CrAg 3 N film developed at 500 °C.

40|$|In {{this study}} samples of AISI 4140 steel were surface treated by plasma {{nitriding}} and {{coated with a}} hydrogen-free hard carbon coating, also known as tetrahedral amorphous carbon coating (ta-C). The specimens were investigated {{with respect to their}} microhardness, residual stress, coating adhesion and dry sliding wear resistance. Wear tests in which duplex-treated specimens were mated to hardened <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>steel</b> were performed under unidirectional and reciprocating sliding. To examine the influence of the nitriding conditions on the performance of duplex-treated steel, the coating was deposited on hardened as well as on plasma nitrided samples, nitrided under two different nitriding conditions. The results show greatly improved sliding wear resistance of plasma-nitrided hard-coated specimens compared with un-coated and pre-hardened ones, observed for both unidirectional and reciprocating sliding. Furthermore, the hydrogen-free hard carbon coating produced a reduction in the coefficient of friction of approximately one order of magnitude.

However, compared with conventional plasma nitriding, pulse plasma nitriding lead to very similar wear properties of the nitrided steel surface. Also, the steel composition has an important effect on the properties and wear resistance of the plasma nitrided steel surface.

WEle fretting in water, experiments revealed that tribochemical reactions, coupled with mild abrasion, {{played a major role}} in the wear behavior of the studied material combinations. ZrO 2 -TiB 2 (70 / 30) /steel wear couple has been found to have the highest fretting wear resistance among the different tribocouples under water lubrication. Under oil lubrication, extensive cracking of the paraffin oil at the fretting contacts, caused by tribodegradation, leads to the deposition of a carbon-rich lubricating layer, which significantly reduced friction and wear of all the investigated tribosystems.

40|$|To {{diminish}} wear in tribological systems it is {{not always}} necessary to provide the entire surface with a wear resistant layer. Depending on the application it is sufficient to harden locally the load carrying areas which are subjected to wear. Such areas can be treated properly by a laser, either totally or partially. This paper describes the effects of laser line hardening on the wear behaviour of carbon steel AISI 1045 against <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>steel</b> AISI 52100. It is shown that the wear resistance of carbon steel AISI 1045 can be improved considerably by line hardening the surface. The wear resistance of the laser line hardened surfaces is comparable with that of carburised steel AISI 1045. However, the properties of the laser line hardened areas determine the wear behaviour of the entire system. Furthermore, the experimental work indicates that the type of heat treatment, carried out prior to line hardening in order to improve the microstructure of the steel, has no significant effect on the wear behaviour of the tribological system...|$|E
40|$|The {{machining}} process 'grinding' is generally critically assessed concerning {{the amounts of}} heat produced during the process operation. Relatively high friction effects in abrasive machining cause heat generation {{which can lead to}} thermal damage in the surface layer of machined parts. Furthermore an inefficient cooling and lubrication system can result in higher tool wear and surface roughness. Therefore the application of cooling lubricants is of utmost importance in grinding. Usually the optimization of the coolant supply system including the selection of the coolant itself is based only upon empirical know-how or practical trial-and-error-tests. Systematic approaches using broader experimental investigations and thus resulting optimized grinding parameters or using fluid mechanical investigations in the coolant supply nozzle or in the grinding gap are not or only rarely applied. This Dr. -Ing. dissertation presents three methods for the investigation and optimization of cooling lubrication in grinding of the <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>steel</b> 100 Cr 6 : 1) modeling and process optimization using experimental data, 2) flow visualization in fluid supply nozzles and 3) grinding fluid pressure measurements in the contact zone...|$|E
40|$|In cutting {{operations}} by multipoint {{cutting tools}} such as bandsawing, the layer of material removed per tooth (5 – 30 ?m) is usually {{less than or equal}} to the cutting edge radius (5 – 15 ?m). Furthermore, the bandsaw tooth is also restricted since it has to accommodate the chip in a gullet of limited size. This situation can lead to inefficient metal removal by a combination of piling up, discontinuous chip formation and ploughing action in contrast to the cutting operations by most of the single point cutting tools (e. g., turning). Specific Cutting Energy (ESP) is a better way of measuring the efficiency of the metal cutting process compared to the other processes such as determining tool wear, cutting forces, chip ratio, etc. This paper reports on the full bandsawing tests of three different workpiece materials (<b>Ball</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>steel,</b> Stainless steel and Ni–Cr–Mo steel). The increase of ESP throughout the life of the bandsaw reflected the degradation of the cutting performance due to the wear of the cutting edge geometry for Ball bearing and Stainless steels. However, there was no increase in ESP when cutting Ni–Cr–Mo steel, which could be explained by the existence of a large protective built-up edge and/or minimal blade wear. The variation of the ESP in different workpiece materials will also provide valuable information for bandsaw manufacturers and end users to estimate machinability characteristics for selected workpieces...|$|E

40|$|Thermal {{spraying}} is {{the name}} of a large group of coating deposition techniques used to deposit thick layers for a variety of applications. The principle is to melt the material, and rapidly propel the droplets towards a substrate where they flatten and solidify. When properly used, the substrate is not significantly heated. Spraying enables deposition of practically any material with a stable molten phase, on any solid material. Sprayed ceramics are used to reduce wear by sliding and by hard particles. However, due to the defect-filled microstructure resulting from spraying, the coatings typically have poor mechanical and tribological properties compared to dense, sintered materials. By varying the spraying parameters, the microstructure of the coatings was influenced, and also the wear rate and cohesion, which is difficult to quantify. Improved tribological properties resulted from spraying with axial particle injection equipment and using narrowly size distributed, spherically shaped powder particles, compared to conventional equipment and powder particles. A new method to seal the open pores of sprayed ceramic coatings by electrolysis is proposed and evaluated. It was found that almost complete sealing could be obtained, in some cases giving a drastically improved wear behaviour. The studied electrolytically deposited sealants were Pb, Sn, Cu and Ni. The latter was found to give the best performance. It also proved possible to apply PVD coatings to the sprayed ceramics, and it was shown that sprayed and Ni-sealed alumina can be superior to <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>steel</b> to support thin, low friction PVD coatings...|$|E

An extensive parameter study including the variation of the power on C- and Al-targets and reactive gas (Ar+N 2) flow was done in order to optimize the Al and N content in the thin films.

The primary reason for studying ceramic balls is because of interest in ball-bearing applications, hence a modified four-ball machine is employed which correctly models ball motions and precisely defines ball load. Experimental and theoretical kinematic analysis of ball motion during modified four ball machine tests is presented. The kinematic analysis reveals that in practice, lower ball tracking exists at high speeds. Test conditions of lubricated contacts under high compressive stress show delamination type failures. Delamination failures are classified in terms of propagation and initiation from scanning electron microscope observations. Residual stresses are measured on delaminated surfaces, which implies plastic deformation of the ceramic. Also, chemical analysis implies that disruption of silicon, nitrogen and oxygen levels may take place on delaminated surfaces. Experiments illustrating various fatigue failure modes using artificially pre-cracked ceramic balls in contact with a steel upper ball are presented...|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} for significant performance increases, using ceramic materials in un-lubricated {{rolling element bearing}} applications, {{has been the subject}} of research over the past two decades. Practical advantages over steel include increased ability to withstand high loads, severe environments and high speeds. However, widespread acceptance has been limited by the inability to predict wear life for ceramic bearing applications. In this thesis, the rolling contact wear of 52100 <b>bearing</b> <b>steel</b> and Over-aged Magnesia-Partially-Stabilised Zirconia (OA-Mg-PSZ) ceramic are examined using a newly developed rolling contact wear test rig. The new wear test rig simulates the system geometry of an un-lubricated hybrid (ceramic and <b>steel)</b> <b>ball</b> <b>bearing.</b> The new wear test rig is versatile in that it allows low cost samples to be utilised resulting in a larger number of samples that can be tested. Wear samples of 52100 <b>bearing</b> <b>steel</b> and OA-Mg-PSZ produced by the new wear test rig were examined for mass loss and wear depth. The wear behavior of both the steel and ceramic material showed a dependence on operating variables time and load. Load was varied between 300 N to 790 N. Typical mass loss after 1 hour of testing 52100 <b>bearing</b> <b>steel</b> at 790 N was 0. 03 grams as compared to OA-Mg-PSZ which was 0. 001 grams. The rolling contact wear of the OA-Mg-PSZ was an order of magnitude lower than that of the 52100 <b>bearing</b> <b>steel.</b> The wear mechanism for 52100 <b>bearing</b> <b>steel</b> was typical of plastic deformation and shearing near and below the surface of rolling contact. Once cracks extend to reach the surface, thin flat like sheets are produced. In OA-Mg-PSZ the wear mechanism initially is that of plastic deformation on the scale of the surface asperities with asperity polishing occurring followed by lateral cracks and fatigue spallation. Results obtained using the new rolling contact wear test rig led to the establishment of a new equation for wear modeling of 52100 <b>bearing</b> <b>steel</b> and OA-Mg-PSZ ceramic materials...|$|R
