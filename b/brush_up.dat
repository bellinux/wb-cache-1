5|$|In 1905, Albert Einstein {{published}} his paper On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies about special relativity. Born was intrigued, and began researching the subject. He was devastated {{to discover that}} Minkowski was also researching special relativity along the same lines, but when he wrote to Minkowski about his results, Minkowski asked {{him to return to}} GÃ¶ttingen and do his habilitation there. Born accepted. Toeplitz helped Born <b>brush</b> <b>up</b> on his matrix algebra so he could work with the four-dimensional Minkowski space matrices used in the latter's project to reconcile relativity with electrodynamics. Born and Minkowski got along well, and their work made good progress, but Minkowski died suddenly of appendicitis on 12 January 1909. The mathematics students had Born speak on their behalf at the funeral.|$|E

25|$|In June 2008, {{researchers}} at the Radboud University in Nijmegen, the Netherlands, who had previously succeeded in hacking the OV-chipkaart (the Dutch public transport chip card), hacked an Oyster card, which is also based on the MIFARE Classic chip. They scanned a card reader to obtain its cryptographic key, then used a wireless antenna attached to a laptop computer to <b>brush</b> <b>up</b> against passengers on the London Underground and extract the information from their cards. With that information {{they were able to}} clone a card, add credit to it, and use it to travel on the Underground for at least a day. The MIFARE chip manufacturers NXP Semiconductor sought a court injunction to prevent the publication of the details of this security breach, but this was overturned on appeal.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the wake}} of the {{incidents}} in April 2008, the Baltimore Police Department made wholesale changes to the leadership of the unit patrolling the city's Inner Harbor. [...] A new lieutenant and sergeant took command of the 12 officers in charge of patrolling the area from the edge of Federal Hill to the Fallsway, near Pier 5. [...] Sterling Clifford, a spokesman for the police department, said: [...] "Given the extreme nature of that incident, we thought it was important for the officers to <b>brush</b> <b>up</b> on their interpersonal skills." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Chinese Shar-Pei is {{a unique}} and {{intelligent}} dog most often recognized for its wrinkles. Initially developed as a Chinese farm and hunting and later fighting dog, the breed does well today in obedience, agility, herding and tracking, with skills {{that would have been}} needed on the farm. Because the name Shar-Pei means [...] "sand coat", harshness is a distinctive feature in its two accepted coat types, either horse (short) or <b>brush</b> (<b>up</b> to an inch long). Other unique qualities include black mouth pigment, a slightly [...] "hippo-like" [...] head shape, small ears, deep-set eyes and rising top-line.|$|E
2500|$|As a {{slow moving}} species S. pacifica feeds on decomposing {{vegetation}} and other detritus, consuming minute diverse particles conveyed by currents to downstream pools. As the water slows, the particles are filtered by the fine network of exposed roots from trees, such as from willows and alders. The California freshwater shrimp merely <b>brush</b> <b>up</b> the food with tufts at {{the tips of}} their small claws, and lift to their mouths the collected morsels. [...] Colonized by algae, bacteria, fungi, and microscopic animals, the particle agglomerates are quite nutritious. Although most species of shrimp walk slowly about the roots as they feed, S. pacitica will undertake short swimming bursts to obtain particularly desirable items.|$|E

2500|$|The lyrics {{focus on}} the men in Dixon's past {{relationships}} and their lazy attitudes. The chorus states her frustration with men not completing everyday housekeeping tasks; [...] "Does he wash up? Never wash up/Does he clean up? No he never cleans up/Does he <b>brush</b> <b>up?</b> He never brushed up". In the final verse the lyrics state, [...] "And if the man can't dance/He gets no second chance"; a reference to her refusal to date men if they cannot dance. In an interview Dixon explained in further detail about the lyric, saying [...] "I have to be honest, I do {{like a man who}} can dance, but it's not a deal-breaker. It's nice if they can dance, but if they can't we'll just have to work on other areas!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Fly-reel drag {{systems have}} two {{purposes}} 1.) They prevent spool overrun when stripping {{line from the}} reel while casting 2.)Tire out running fish by exerting pressure on the line that runs in the opposite direction. There are four main drag systems that are used with the fly reel {{and these are the}} ratchet-and-pawl, caliper drags, disc drags, and center-line drags. [...] The ratchet-and-pawl drag clicks automatically while the spool is spinning. [...] The caliper drag causes the calipers to <b>brush</b> <b>up</b> against the reel spool. [...] A disc drag is when pressure is applied on the plates which then applies pressure on the spool. Center-line drags also known as the best kind of drag because the pressure is directly on the spool close to the axis of rotation.|$|E
