5|$|Pure {{beryllium}} metal did {{not become}} readily available until 1957, {{even though it had}} been used as an alloying metal to harden and toughen copper much earlier. Beryllium could be produced <b>by</b> <b>reducing</b> beryllium compounds such as beryllium chloride with metallic potassium or sodium.

The price on the American market for vacuum-cast beryllium ingots was about $338 per pound ($745 per kilogram) in 2001.|$|E
5|$|Scheele {{and other}} chemists {{were aware that}} {{manganese}} dioxide contained a new element, {{but they were not}} able to isolate it. Johan Gottlieb Gahn was the first to isolate an impure sample of manganese metal in 1774, <b>by</b> <b>reducing</b> the dioxide with carbon.|$|E

5|$|A severe {{regression}} {{would have}} greatly reduced the continental shelf area, {{which is the}} most species-rich part of the sea, and therefore could have been enough to cause a marine mass extinction, however, research concludes that this change would have been insufficient to cause the observed level of ammonite extinction. The regression would also have caused climate changes, partly by disrupting winds and ocean currents and partly <b>by</b> <b>reducing</b> the Earth's albedo and therefore, increasing global temperatures.|$|E
5|$|A {{significant}} {{challenge for}} this series was achieving ground clearance for the wing-mounted engine. This was overcome <b>by</b> <b>reducing</b> the intake fan diameter and relocating the gearbox and other accessories {{from beneath the}} engine to the sides. The resulting flattened nacelle bottom and intake lip yielded the distinctive appearance of the Boeing737 with CFM56 engines.|$|E
5|$|Acamprosate may {{stabilise}} {{the brain}} chemistry that is altered due to alcohol dependence via antagonising {{the actions of}} glutamate, a neurotransmitter which is hyperactive in the post-withdrawal phase. <b>By</b> <b>reducing</b> excessive NMDA activity which occurs {{at the onset of}} alcohol withdrawal, acamprosate can reduce or prevent alcohol withdrawal related neurotoxicity.

5|$|Aspirin is an {{important}} part of the treatment of those who have had a myocardial infarction (heart attack). One trial found that among those likely having an ST-segment elevation MI, aspirin saves the life of 1 in 42 <b>by</b> <b>reducing</b> the 30-day death rate from 11.8% to 9.4%. There was no difference in major bleeding, but there was a small increase in minor bleeding amounting to roughly 1 in every 167 people given aspirin.|$|E
5|$|By the 1970s {{the airport}} was again {{in need of}} {{expansion}} and modernization. In 1973 the newly created Metropolitan Nashville Airport Authority (MNAA) finalized a master plan to coordinate the long-term growth of the airport along projected increases in needed passenger capacity.

5|$|Contraceptive use in {{developing}} countries is estimated to have decreased the number of maternal deaths by 40% (about 270,000 deaths prevented in 2008) and could prevent 70% of deaths if the full demand for birth control were met. These benefits are achieved <b>by</b> <b>reducing</b> the number of unplanned pregnancies that subsequently result in unsafe abortions and by preventing pregnancies in those at high risk.|$|E
5|$|For a few limited {{purposes}} {{when it is}} needed, {{pure iron}} is produced in the laboratory in small quantities <b>by</b> <b>reducing</b> the pure oxide or hydroxide with hydrogen, or forming iron pentacarbonyl and heating it to 250°C so that it decomposes to form pure iron powder.
