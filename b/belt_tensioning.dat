5000|$|Active {{seat-belt}} buckle with Pre-Safe {{function for}} rear occupants: the active seat-belt buckle is fully integrated in the vehicle's PRE-SAFE® system. Whenever PRE-SAFE® becomes active in critical driving situations {{or when the}} system detects the vehicle approaching other objects at a critical speed, reversible <b>belt</b> <b>tensioning</b> is also performed in the rear via the active seat-belt buckle function. The restraint system and the passengers are thus better prepared for a possible accident system. In contrast to its extended position to facilitate fastening of the seat belt, the belt buckle is retracted by approx. 40 millimetres instead. This reversible function increases the <b>belt</b> <b>tensioning</b> on the occupant by up to 80 millimetres. In addition, the belt buckle branches off at a lower point at the occupant's hip. This {{reduces the risk of}} the pelvis submarining under the belt. Securing the occupants more effectively in this way can reduce the strain to which they are exposed {{in the event of an}} accident. The active seat-belt buckle complements the pyrotechnic <b>belt</b> <b>tensioning</b> which has featured as standard in Mercedes-Benz vehicles for many years now, and is triggered in the event of an actual impact.|$|E
50|$|Power {{transmission}} {{is a function}} of <b>belt</b> <b>tension.</b> However, also increasing with tension is stress (load) on the belt and bearings. The ideal belt is that of the lowest tension that does not slip in high loads. <b>Belt</b> <b>tensions</b> should also be adjusted to belt type, size, speed, and pulley diameters. <b>Belt</b> <b>tension</b> is determined by measuring the force to deflect the belt a given distance per inch of pulley. Timing belts need only adequate tension to keep the belt in contact with the pulley.|$|R

40|$|A {{very common}} {{configuration}} of motorcycle V-belt variators {{allows for the}} correction of the <b>belt</b> <b>tensioning</b> in dependence on the resistant torque by a suitable helical shape of the tracks that enable the closure/opening of the driven half-pulleys. The theoretical model for the belt-pulley coupling is just complex for this arrangement, where one half-pulley may run in advance {{and the other is}} slower than the belt, and requires the repeated numerical solution of a strongly non-linear differential system by a sort of shooting technique, until all boundary conditions are fulfilled (angular contact extent, torque, axial force). After solving the full equations, the present study develops closed-form approximations characterized by an excellent fit with the numerical plots and proposes a simple and practical formulary for the axial thrust in dependence on the torque and the tension level. Then, results of a theoretical-experimental comparison are also reported, revealing a very good agreement of the model with the real operation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Monitoring of the {{electrocardiogram}} (ECG) in premature {{infants with}} conventional adhesive-backed electrodes can harm their sensitive skin. Use of an electrode belt prevents skin irritation, {{but the effect}} of belt pressure on respiratory function is unknown. A strain gauge sensor is described which measures applied <b>belt</b> <b>tension.</b> Method The device frame was comprised of an aluminum housing and slide to minimize the device weight. Velcro tabs connected housing and slide to opposite tabs located at the electrode belt ends. The slide was connected to a leaf spring, to which were bonded two piezoresistive transducers in a half-bridge circuit configuration. The device was tested for linearity and calibrated. The effect on infant respiratory function of constant <b>belt</b> <b>tension</b> in the normal range (30 g– 90 g) was determined. Results The mechanical response to a step input was second order (f n = 401 Hz, ζ = 0. 08). The relationship between applied tension and output voltage was linear in the range 25 – 225 gm of applied tension (r 2 = 0. 99). Measured device sensitivity was 2. 18 mV/gm tension using a 5 V bridge excitation voltage. When <b>belt</b> <b>tension</b> was increased in the normal range from 30 gm to 90 gm, {{there was no significant}} change in heart rate and most respiratory functions during monitoring. At an intermediate level of tension of 50 gm, pulmonary resistance and work of breathing significantly decreased. Conclusion The mechanical and electrical design of a device for monitoring electrocardiogram electrode <b>belt</b> <b>tension</b> is described. Within the typical range of application tension, cardiovascular and respiratory function are not substantially negatively affected by electrode belt force. </p...|$|R
50|$|A {{belt drive}} for a bicycle was {{patented}} in the United States on April 8, 1890 by Charles D. Rice, Patent # 425,390. No {{evidence has been}} found that it was ever used, but some motorcycles used leather belts in the early 1900s. The Bridgestone Picnica belt-drive bicycle was introduced in the early 1980s. It used a tooth-belt drive like auto timing belts and Harley-Davidson drive belts, along with a novel two-part chainring that increased <b>belt</b> <b>tension</b> with increasing load. The Picnica was a folding bicycle, and part of the appeal of the belt drive was cleanliness. The Picnica was a small-wheel bicycle, so <b>belt</b> <b>tension</b> may have been less than on a bicycle with standard-size wheels. It was apparently successful, but was offered mainly in Japan.|$|R

40|$|Belt span {{transverse}} vibrations in an automotive {{accessory drive}} system {{are known to be}} significantly amplified when the angular natural frequencies of the system are in close proximity to the transverse natural frequencies. In order to avoid this situation when designing a belt drive it is necessary to be able to mathematically model the angular motion of the system. The objective {{of this study was to}} develop a model which is able to consider both single and multiple belt systems with a pivoted-arm automatic belt tensioner and determine the natural frequencies, mode shapes, forced response and dynamic <b>belt</b> <b>tension.</b> Experiments were conducted on two- and three-pulley systems, with and without an automatic belt tensioner, to investigate the angular vibration characteristics of simplified accessory drives. The results of these experiments were in good agreement with the analytical model. The effect of initial <b>belt</b> <b>tension</b> on the angular natural frequencies was investigated and found to be negligible. Tests were also performed to determine belt span transverse vibration natural frequencies for various span lengths and <b>belt</b> <b>tensions.</b> These results were also in good agreement with an existing theory of belt vibrations.

5000|$|The Bridgestone Picnica (Japanese: Burijisuton Pikunika: ブリヂストン 「ピクニカ」) line of {{collapsible}} bikes, {{some models}} featuring belt-drives, {{were introduced in}} the early 1980s and carried in the Bridgestone Cycle USA catalogs from 1985 through 1990. It weighs 29 pounds, and belt-drive models use a tooth-belt drive like auto timing belts and Harley-Davidson drive belts, along with a novel two-part chainring that increases <b>belt</b> <b>tension</b> with increasing load. In April 1987, Popular Mechanics described Bridgestone's Beltrex system as follows: [...] "Unlike the belt-drive motorcycles, which can slide the rear wheel back to keep the belt taut, the Beltrex uses a floating pulley that's cogged to the drive gear. Tension on the pedal cranks drives the floating pulley forward, taking up belt slack and preventing tooth slippage."The Picnica is a folding bicycle, {{and part of the}} appeal of the belt drive is cleanliness. It is a small wheel bicycle, so <b>belt</b> <b>tension</b> may be less than on a bicycle with standard-size wheels.|$|R
50|$|Power is {{transmitted}} from the engine to the drive system through drive belts. Originally, the R22 used four separate v-belts running on multi-groove sheaves. This system proved problematic, as individual belts would sometimes roll over in their groove and fail. As a temporary measure, in 1982, R22 operators received a kit from Robinson that was installed in the cockpit and on the <b>belt</b> <b>tension</b> actuator, isolating the tensioning circuits and locking the clutch/drive system at take-off tension. The problem was ultimately solved by replacing the four individual v-belts with two dual v-belts. The upper, driven sheave is mounted on the main/tail rotor drive shaft incorporating flexible couplings, and is raised and lowered relative to the engine-mounted, driving sheave {{by means of a}} <b>belt</b> <b>tension</b> actuator. During shutdown, the actuator is used to lower the upper sheave to loosen the drive belts. For startup, the engine is started with the belts loose, allowing the engine to run without spinning the rotor system. Immediately after engine start, the clutch switch located in the cockpit is closed by the pilot, powering the actuator to slowly raise the upper sheave to flight position, which tightens the belts. The actuator is thereafter controlled by pressure-sensing column springs, automatically maintaining proper <b>belt</b> <b>tension</b> during flight as the belts wear and stretch. The shaft on which the upper sheave is mounted drives both the main and tail rotors; the main gear box delivers power to the main rotor shaft through a set of splash-lubricated spiral bevel gears.|$|R
50|$|The exposed drum shafts {{are used}} to install and fix the drum motor into the {{conveyor}} frame and do not rotate. The shaft can be a single “through” shaft where the motor and gearbox are assembled on, and fixed to, the shaft with keys or pins. However, this type of drum motor design has a limited maximum radial load due to the bending stresses caused by the normal <b>belt</b> <b>tension</b> of a conveyor and is therefore used mainly for small light duty conveyors and loads. For heavier loads the most common design is to use two separate shafts, one fixed to the motor housing and one fixed to the gearbox housing where the mass of metal from the motor and gearbox significantly increases {{the strength of the}} drum motor allowing much higher payloads and longer conveyor applications. Typically one shaft is short (stub shaft) with a consistent length and the other increases in length according to the drum shell or belt width. Over certain widths, the shaft can be further reinforced to prevent bending under high <b>belt</b> <b>tension.</b>|$|R
50|$|The V6 {{engine is}} fitted with four {{overhead}} camshafts driven by synchronous tooth belts. It has a single, long, serpentine belt {{at the front}} driving the inlet cams and also the coolant pump. The exhaust cams are driven by short link belts driven from {{the ends of the}} inlet cams {{at the rear of the}} engine. The system was a joint development between Dayco (belt supplier) and Rover.The rear link belts do not incorporate any <b>tensioning</b> device. <b>Belt</b> <b>tension</b> is maintained by very careful control of belt length and the pulley pair is pre-tensioned during fitting. The front <b>belt</b> drive is <b>tensioned</b> by a spring-loaded tensioner pulley incorporating a hydraulic damping element.|$|R
50|$|Belt drives are simple, inexpensive, and do {{not require}} axially aligned shafts. They help protect {{machinery}} from overload and jam, and damp and isolate noise and vibration. Load fluctuations are shock-absorbed (cushioned). They need no lubrication and minimal maintenance. They have high efficiency (90-98%, usually 95%), high tolerance for misalignment, and are of relatively low cost if the shafts are far apart. Clutch action is activated by releasing <b>belt</b> <b>tension.</b> Different speeds {{can be obtained by}} stepped or tapered pulleys.|$|R
