30|$|The {{current study}} showed {{dominance}} of phytoplankton by <b>Bacillariophyceae</b> class (70.83  %). Similar results in marine environment {{have been obtained}} by Saravanakumar et al. (2008), Saifullah et al. (2014) and Moto (2015) who obtained 78.85, 76.40 and 67.69  % of <b>Bacillariophyceae</b> composition, respectively. The high abundance of <b>Bacillariophyceae</b> is due {{to their ability to}} proliferate in the aquatic environment. <b>Bacillariophyceae</b> have been shown to exhibit a boom and bust (or bloom and bust) lifestyle in freshwater and marine environments (Richard and Stickley 2010). They effectively utilize nutrients and light availability to allow them compete and quickly dominate the other phytoplankton species (Buchan et al. 2014). Based on this capability, Furnas (1990) classified them as opportunistic r-strategists (i.e. those organisms whose ecology is defined by a high growth rate, r). This ability make <b>Bacillariophyceae</b> the most abundant and ubiquitous group in terms of ecosystems and water chemistry (Coelho et al. 2013; Desrosiers et al. 2013) making them responsible for approximately 20  % of global aquatic photosynthesis (Rosenwasser et al. 2014). The dominance of <b>Bacillariophyceae</b> in coral reefs as obtained in the present study is likely to contribute to nutrient cycling and gas exchange (Barott et al. 2011) subsequently promoting growth and abundance of corals and algae.|$|E
