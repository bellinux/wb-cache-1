40|$|Physical, structral, and {{electromagnetic}} {{properties and}} interrelating processes in sea ice {{are used to}} develop a composite model for polarimetric backscattering signatures of sea ice. Physical properties of sea ice constituents such as ice, <b>brine,</b> <b>air,</b> and salt are presented {{in terms of their}} effects on electromagnetic wave interactions. Sea ice structure and geometry of scatterers are related to wave propagation, attenuation, and scattering. Temperature and salinity, which are determining factors for the thermodynamic phase distribution in sea ice, are consistently used to derive both effective permittivities and polarimetric scattering coefficients. Polarmetric signatures of sea ice depend on crystal sizes and brine volumes, which are affected by ice growth rates. Desalination by brine expulsion, drainage, or other mechanisms modifies wave penetration and scattering. Sea ice signatures are further complicated by surface conditions such as rough interfaces, hummocks, snow cover, brine skim, or slush layer. Based on the same set of geophysical parameters characterizing sea ice, a composite model is developed to calculate effective permittivities and backscattering covariance matrices at microwave frequencies to interpretation of sea ice polarimetric signatures...|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} modifications {{made to the}} EOSN module (Shan and Pruess, 2003) of the nonisothermal {{multiphase flow}} simulator TOUGH 2 (Pruess, et al., 1999). The EOSN fluid property module simulates transport of water, <b>brine,</b> <b>air,</b> and noble gases or CO 2 in the subsurface. In the standard version of the EOSN module, diffusion coefficients can be specified by the user, {{but there is no}} allowance for liquid-phase diffusion coefficients to change with temperature. Furthermore, users must specify radiogenic sources of heat and helium for each element in data block GENER, which can be a time-consuming task for models with large numbers of elements. Our modifications seek to increase the functionality and efficiency of using TOUGH 2 -EOSN by allowing for mass- and temperature-dependent liquid-phase diffusion coefficients for helium and neon and specification of radiogenic heat and helium production as a property of a material. The modified version is based on TOUGH 2 -EOSN and thus requires familiarity with the capabilities and input formats of the TOUGH 2 code (Pruess, et al., 1999) and the EOSN module (Shan and Pruess, 2003). This report only details our modifications and how to properly utilize them...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{dielectric}} {{response of}} geologic materials {{is related to}} the amount of water-wetted solid surface present. This dependence raises the possibility that dielectric measurements may be used to detect changes {{in the state of the}} solid-fluid interface such as those caused by the sorption of a chemical species. In this study, complex impedance data are collected for systems of clean and oil-bearing sand and kaolinite vacuum-saturated with a 0. 001 M NaCl brine in the frequency range 100 kHz to 10 MHz. The effective dielectric constant k and electrical conductivity s of the samples are calculated from these measurements assuming quasi-static conditions. We define the components in our system as <b>brine,</b> <b>air,</b> and a “wetted ” solid phase. In this way, the contribution of the solid-fluid interface to the bulk dielectric response is included in the last component. We use an inclusion-based effective medium theory to extract the dielectric response of the wetted solid from the experimental data. The presence of sorbed oil is found to have little effect on the dielectric response of the wetted sand matrix, presumably because of the very low surface area (0. 2 m 2 /g) of the solid-fluid interface. In contrast, the kaolinite (5 – 12 m 2 /g) data indicate a decrease of the order of 50 % in the dielectric constant of the wetted matrix phase as the amount of water-wetted surface in the sample decreases. The results from this experimental study show that the presence of sorbed oil leads to a detectable change in the dielectric properties of high surface area geologic materials. 1...|$|E

40|$|As an inhomogeneous {{mixture of}} pure ice, <b>brine,</b> <b>air</b> and solid salts the {{physical}} properties of sea ice depend on its highly temperature-dependent microstructure. Understanding the microstructure {{and the way}} it responds to variations in temperature and salinity is crucial in developing an improved understanding of the interaction between sea ice and the environment. However, measurements monitoring the microstructure of sea ice are difficult to obtain without disturbing its natural state. The brine fraction of sea ice is orders of magnitude more conductive than the solid ice, thus direct current resistivity techniques should yield information on sea ice microstructure. Due to the preferential vertical alignment of brine inclusions, the bulk resistivity of first-year sea ice is anisotropic, complicating interpretation of surface resistivity soundings. However, it can be shown that in a bounded anisotropic medium the resistivity structure may be resolved through in situ cross-borehole measurements. Measurement between borehole pairs, each containing one current and one potential electrode, allows the determination of the horizontal component of the anisotropic bulk resistivity (PH). Using three to four electrodes positioned at approximately the same depth in separate boreholes, provides an under-estimation of the geometric mean resistivity (Pm), and numerical modelling is required to retrieve an estimate of the true Pm. Combining these resistivities allows calculation of the vertical component of the bulk resistivity (PV). This thesis looks at results from measurements made in first year sea ice in April – June 2008 off Barrow, Alaska and in November 2009 off Ross Island, Antarctica. At Barrow, relatively quiescent conditions typically lead to a predominance of columnar ice, while more turbulent conditions and underwater ice formation in McMurdo Sound tend to produce a larger component of frazil or platelet ice. Interpretation of the resistivity measurements, aided by temperature and salinity data, shows that this measurement technique can be used to observe evolution of the ice structure, and distinguish different ice types. Basic two phase structures provide a simple picture of the brine microstructure and how it changes with depth and time. These models indicate the need for vertical connectivity of the brine inclusions even in cool ice, and that PH seems to be mostly due to connections along grain boundaries...|$|E

The similarity of sea ice microstructure to compressed powders is used to theoretically predict pc of about 5 percent.

However, there is an evident lack of standardization of production processes and HACCP systems thus implying the need of establishing decision-making tools allowing their commercialization and shelf-life extension. The present work aims at developing a decision-making scoring system by means of a probabilistic assessment to standardize production process of Aloreña de Málaga table olives based on the identification of potential hazards or deficiencies in hygienic processes for the subsequent implementation of corrective measures. A total of 658 microbiological and physico-chemical data were collected over three consecutive olive campaigns (2014 – 2016) to measure the variability and relative importance of each elaboration step on total hygienic quality and product safety. Three representative companies were visited to collect samples from food-contact surfaces, olive fruits, <b>brines,</b> <b>air</b> environment, olive dressings, water tanks, and finished/packaged products. A probabilistic assessment was done based on the establishment of Performance Hygiene and Safety Scores (PHSS 0 – 100 %) through a standardized system for evaluating product acceptability. The mean value of the global PHSS for the Aloreña de Málaga table olives processing (PHHSFTOT) was 64. 82 % (90 th CI: 52. 78 – 76. 39 %) indicating the high variability among facilities in the evaluated processing steps on final product quality and safety. Washing and cracking, and selection and addition of olive dressings were detected as the most deficient ones in relation to PHSSFi values (p < 0. 05) (mean = 53. 02 and 56. 62 %, respectively). The relative contribution of each processing step was quantified by different experts (n = 25) from the Aloreña de Málaga table olive sector through a weighted PHSS (PHSSw). The mean value of PHSSw was 65. 53 % (90 th CI: 53. 12 – 77. 52 %). The final processing steps obtained higher values for PHSSw being the finished product the most relevant one (mean = 18. 44 %; 90 % CI: 10. 34 – 25. 33 %). Sensitivity analysis concluded that intervention measures focused on reducing the contamination of washing brines could lead to an improvement of PHSSFTOT value to 67. 03 %.

It was found that trapped NW phase saturation decreases with increases in capillary number, average blob size decreases with increases in capillary number, and the number of NW blobs increases with increases in capillary number. In addition, it was found that NW phase trapping is dependent on initial NW phase connectivity within the porous medium; with more negative values of initial NW phase Euler number resulting in less trapping. We suggest that the Euler number-saturation and the capillary number-saturation relationships for a given medium should be taken into consideration when designing a CO₂ sequestration scenario...|$|R

40|$|Arctic and Antarctic sea ice plays a {{critical}} role in the global ocean−climate system, as well as in polar biology. Sea ice is a porous composite of pure ice with <b>brine</b> and <b>air</b> inclusions whose microstructure varies significantly with temperature. The fluid transport properties of sea ice control a broad range of geophysical and biological processes. Yet little is known, for example, about bulk flow of brine or diffusive transport of dissolved substances such as nutrients or pollutants through the porous microstructure, particularly from a theoretical standpoint. Here we give rigorous, mathematical formulations of the two key problems of fluid dynamics in sea ice: estimating the effective fluid permeability tensor k(φ) and its dependence on brine porosity φ, and estimating the trapping constant γ or mean survival time τ for a diffusion process in the pore microstructure which can react with the boundary. We bring together and review a variety of results which lay the foundation for studying fluid transport processes in sea ice from a mathematical perspective, and focus on rigorous bounds on k and γ. Void bounds evaluated by Torquato and Pham (2004) for classical coated cylinder geometries yield pipe bounds for the permeability k of sea ice in the vertical direction. By incorporating information about average brine inclusion sizes, the void bounds provide a useful benchmark that captures laboratory data taken on k(φ) ...|$|R

Sea ice algae communities are found throughout the column of sea ice.

The result from the investigation shows that the losses for a system with 40 m pipes in total are approximately 300 kWh annually.

However, numerical models for predicting the ice-induced vibrations (IIV) of offshore structures are still lacking in literature. This study aims to develop a mathematical reduced-order model for predicting the two-dimensional IIV of offshore structures with geometric coupling and nonlinearities. A cylindrical structure subject to a moving uniform ice sheet is analysed using the well-known Matlock model which, in the present study, is extended and modified to account for a new empirical nonlinear stress-strain rate relationship determining the maximum compressive stress of the ice. The model is further developed through the incorporation of ice temperature, <b>brine</b> content, <b>air</b> volume, grain size, ice thickness and ice wedge angle effects on the ice compressive strength. These allow the effect of multiple ice properties on the ice-structure interaction to be investigated. A further advancement is the inclusion of an equation allowing the length of failed ice at a point of failure to vary with time. A mixture of existing equations and newly proposed empirical relationships are used. Structural geometric nonlinearities are incorporated into the numerical model {{through the use of}} Duffing oscillators, a technique previously proposed in vortex-induced vibration studies. A one-degree-of-freedom (DOF) model is successfully validated against experimental results from the literature whilst the extended two-degree-of-freedom model produces new insights. Parametric studies highlight the effect of asymmetric geometric nonlinearities and ice velocity on the structural dynamic response. Results were compared to Palmer et al. (2010) which identified quasi-static, random-like or chaotic and locked-in motions.

A novel analysis of micro-CT images of small rock samples {{is combined with}} laboratory measurements to examine the predictive value of imagebased computations of RI. Experimentally measured porosity, formation factor, capillary pressure (Pc) and RI are compared with image-based computations using the same rock sample for both imaging and laboratory measurements. The fluid systems used are 2 wt% NaCl <b>brine</b> and <b>air.</b> The porous plate and centrifuge methods are used to measure Pc and RI at ambient conditions. Two carbonate samples from the Middle East and two outcrop sandstone samples (Fontainebleau and Bentheimer) are investigated. Three of the samples are homogeneous {{and one of the}} carbonate samples is heterogeneous. The effects of injection boundaries on image based computations of single and multiphase flow properties of the rock samples are investigated numerically. The RI of Fontainebleau and Bentheimer sandstone is studied at water saturations as low as 10 %. The laboratory measurements show {{that it is possible to}} conduct reasonable tests on the small rock samples which are used for image analysis. For homogeneous rocks these measurements compare well with measurements made using conventional size cores and the measurements are in reasonable agreement with image-based computations. Simulations are in good agreement with experimental measurements of capillary drainage RI using the porous plate method at water saturations as low as 10 %. However, this agreement is a result of careful treatment of discretisation effects. Fontainebleau sandstone exhibits a percolating network of grain contacts, while the high-porosity Bentheimer sandstone does not. It is shown that this difference in the topological connection of conductive films at low water saturations is responsible for the non- Archie behaviour of Fontainebleau sandstone. It is shown that grain contact conductivity needs to be attributed to the grain contacts in Fontainebleau sandstone in order to reconcile experiments and computations. Conductive films organised as pendular rings around grain contacts are shown to be insufficient to explain this result...|$|R

In the ice floe, concentrations of C 2 H 5 I, 2 -C 3 H 7 I and CH 2 Br 2 showed significant enhancement in the sea ice brine, of average factors of 1. 7, 1. 4 and 2. 5 times respectively, compared to the water underneath and after normalising to brine volume. Concentrations of mono-iodocarbons in air are the highest ever reported, and our calculations suggest increased fluxes of halocarbons to the atmosphere may result from their sea-ice enhancement. Some halocarbons were also measured in ice of the sub-Arctic in Hudson Bay (∼ 55 °N, 77 °W) in early spring, ice that was thicker, colder and less porous than the Arctic ice in summer, and in which the halocarbons were concentrated to values over 10 times larger than in the Arctic ice when normalised to brine volume. Concentrations in the Arctic ice were similar to those in Antarctic sea ice that was similarly warm and porous.

Although porosities (2 %– 14 %) and permeabilities (0 – 74 mD) are relatively low, velocity variations are large. Differences between the highest and lowest P- and S-wave velocities are about 18 % and 27 % for brine-saturated samples at 60 and 10 MPa effective pressure, respectively. S-wave velocities are measured for two orthogonal polarizations; for four of six samples, anisotropy is revealed.

Moreover, when dried, they also show decreasing attenuation with increasing confining pressure. To model this behavior, we examine a pore model made of two pore systems: one constitutes the main and drainable porosity, and the other is made of undrained cracklike pores that can be associated with grain-to-grain contacts. In addition, these dried rock samples are modeled to contain a fluid-filled-pore system of grain-to-grain contacts, potentially causing local fluid flow and attenuation. For the theoretical model, we use an inclusion model based on the T-matrix approach, which also considers effects of pore texture and geometry, and pore fluid, global- and local-fluid flow.

Some of the selected fractured samples were then taken for fractography analysis using field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM). The results revealed that the strength and hardness of the composites were significantly enhanced as a result of quenching heat treatment. Higher strength and hardness was observed for brine quenching followed by liquid nitrogen, oil, polymer and finally air cooling. The betterment of mechanical properties of AMCs after quenching can be accredited to the intensified dislocation density produced due to coefficient of thermal expansion mismatch between the particles and the matrix and also due to the back stress developed due to particles blocking the plastic flow of the Al matrix phase.

The technological and functional characteristics of the starter culture strains Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, and probiotic bacterial strains Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BB 12, Lactobacillus acidophilus LA- 5 and Lactobacillus casei Shirota were investigated. The tests included the milk fermentation, resistance to salt and heat, bile and acid resistance, and growth at a range of temperatures. The probiotic strains differed in their resistance to salt, bile salts and acid. Inhibitory interactions between probiotic bacterial strains {{with each other and with}} starter culture strains were not detected. The probiotic bacteria and starter culture strains used have an ability to grow together on homofermentative and heterofermentative differential agar and fermentation of fructose in different levels. Non-starter cheese (NSC), cheese with starter strains (SCS), and cheese with starter and probiotic strains (PSC) were manufactured. The levels of mesophilic aerobic and lactic acid bacteria, moulds and yeasts, and Enterobacteriaceae were evaluated in all cheeses. Their contents of fat, total solids, salt and pH value were tested during 21 days of storage at 2 - 5 °C. Starter culture strains contributed to maintaining the quality of all cheeses, through decreasing the viable count of some undesirable microbes. Cheeses differed in the intensity of the crumbliness attribute, and in preference and intensity of colour attribute. The colour of starter soft cheese, which was tested using a colorimeter, was closer to the colour of probiotic soft cheese than those cheeses which were manufactured without starter culture. The microbial status, storage conditions, rancidity, and the sensory characteristics of unripened soft cheese, which was manufactured with starter culture strains only, were determined during the storage for 50 days at 2 - 5 °C, as well as during their shelf life for the product. Modified Atmosphere Packaging (MAP) contributed to slowing the growth of unwanted microbes, and decreased the values of TBA, TVB-N and TMA in soft cheese. Consequently, delaying the undesirable changes and maintaining the quality of the product and extending its shelf life, when compared with vacuum, <b>brine,</b> and <b>air</b> packaging methods, under the same storage conditions. Potential effects of inulin on the cheese quality and sensory characteristics of probiotic soft cheese were investigated. The cheeses differed in their loads of lactic acid bacteria, in addition to the total solids and water activity. The levels of probiotic bacterial strains were higher in probiotic soft cheese that manufactured with inulin than in cheese without inulin, with a potential in the formation synbiotic between the probiotic strains LA- 5 and BB 12 and inulin. Both cheeses were recorded to have high acceptance in the cheese attributes, in terms of appearance, aroma, colour texture and the overall acceptance. The presence of inulin increased the hardness of cheese under vacuum packaging, after storage for 14 days at 2 - 5 °C. Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research of Ira...|$|R
40|$|Geopressured {{resources}} are geothermal reservoirs containing dissolved methane in hot brine at pressures well {{in excess of}} their in situ hydrostatic pressure. In the US, geopressured {{resources are}} primarily located in the Gulf (of Mexico) Coast. The wells {{in this area are}} characterized by typical bottomhole temperatures of 120 - 180 C (250 - 360 F) (Negus-de Wys, 1991 a) and bottomhole pressures of 675 - 1275 bar (9, 800 - 18, 500 psia) (Negus-de Wys, 1991 b). Supercritical water oxidation (SCWO) is an emerging technology for the destruction of hazardous organic waste in which oxidation is carried out in a water medium above the critical point of pure water (374 C/ 705 F, 221 bar/ 3208 psia) (Tester et al., 1992). Geopressured resources are particularly suitable as an input stream to a SCWO waste treatment process due to the near critical conditions of their hot brine. By using a Rankine-type power cycle, electric power can be generated by capturing the available thermal and hydraulic energy from the geothermal resource and the chemical energy of the dissolved methane released by the oxidation process. In addition to oxidizing the methane to convert the chemical energy to thermal energy, auxiliary fuel {{in the form of an}} organic waste can be co-oxidized to increase the energy output to commercially sustainable levels. Coupling the treatment of geopressured brine with an organic waste in a SCWO process synergistically improves power production while providing a means for treating hazardous waste. The objective of this study is to assess the feasibility of using geopressured resources to simultaneously detoxify hazardous waste and generate electric power. Our ultimate aim is to develop conceptual process designs for above-ground and fully or modified in situ approaches to co-processing organic waste with geopressured brine in supercritical water. As a preparatory step for investigating in situ approaches, a realistic above-ground conceptual design was developed in this study. In that concept, the waste, <b>brine</b> and oxidant (<b>air</b> or oxygen) are introduced into the SCWO reactor at the system pressure of 234 bar (3400 psia). The heat of oxidation raises the temperature of the system to about 600 C (1100 F). Due to the low solubility of inorganic salts in supercritical water (about 200 ppm or less) (Armellini and Tester, 1990, 1991 a, 1991 b), solid salt forms and falls to the lower section of the reactor, where it is cooled and quenched with water, creating a concentrated (organic-free) brine that would be mixed with brackish water and reinjected back to the geopressured well. Power is generated by the expansion of the products of the SCWO process through a series of multi-stage turboexpanden. A processing capacity of 100, 000 gallons per day (gpd) was initially taken as the design basis, following some investigations carried out at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory (Propp et al., 1990). The process was modeled using the ASPEN PLUS{trademark} process flowsheet simulator and material and energy balances were determined. Both the cases of using air and oxygen as oxidant were investigated. Toluene was chosen as the model compound to represent the organic waste. Turbine design calculations based on the volumetric flowrates obtained for a 100, 000 gpd capacity resulted in unrealistically high rotor rotational speeds and small wheel pitch diameters to achieve optimum efficiencies. Higher SCWO effluent flowrates would lower rotor rotational speeds and increase wheel pitch diameters to more practical levels. Thus, a 42 -fold larger design capacity of 100, 000 barrels per day (bpd) was adopted as the basis for an above-ground base case. The results for the material and energy balances for a processing capacity of 100, 000 bpd using air and oxygen as oxidant scale up linearly from the results for the 100, 000 gpd case. The best case flowsheet corresponding to a 100, 000 bpi case using oxygen as oxidant is given in Figure 1. Our conceptual design study suggests that simultaneous detoxification of hazardous waste and production of power is possible by co-processing organic waste with geopressured brine. Net power outputs of about 140 MWe and 160 MWe have been estimated for a processing capacity of 100, 000 bpd using air and oxygen as oxidant, respectively...|$|R
