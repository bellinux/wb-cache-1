Effects of TRD on two cultivars of Medicago sativa (Hamedani and Yazdi) were investigated. The in vitro grown plantlets in MS medium were cultured in TRD at concentration 1. 0, 2. 0 and 4. 0 mg/l combined with 0, 100 and 140 mM NaCl respectively. The changes in growth parameters, photosynthetic pigment, carbohydrate, α-tochopherol, glycine <b>betain,</b> proline and proline dehydrogenase (PDH) activity as well as its expression were measured after four weeks post treatment. NaCl treatment decreased overall plant growth and reduced the total chlorophyll, carbohydrate content, PDH activity and increased α-tochopherol, glycine <b>betain</b> content and proline content. The level of PDH transcript was changed in different combinations of NaCl and TRD, however, at 140 mM NaCl and 2 mg/l TRD expression was decreased. When plants were subjected to salt stress, TRD minimized the inhibitory effects of NaCl on plant growth by increasing, total chlorophyll, carbohydrate, α-tochopherol, glycine betaine content...|$|E

Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats, ages 7 and 21 months, were used in this study. The older rats were fed betaine. To elucidate the effect of betaine on oxidative stress-induced NF-jB and its signaling pathway at molecular levels, YPEN- 1 cells were used. Results showed that betaine suppressed NF-jB and its related gene expressions of cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX- 2), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), vascular cell adhesion molecule- 1 (VCAM- 1), and intracellular cell adhesion molecule- 1 (ICAM- 1) in aged kidney. Furthermore, betaine attenuated oxidative stress-induced NF-jB via nuclear factor-inducing kinase/IjB kinase (NIK/IKK) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) in the YPEN- 1 cells. On {{the basis of these}} results, we concluded that betaine suppressed the age-related NF-jB activities associated with upregulated NIK/IKK and MAPKs that were induced by oxidative stress.

Production of Cr in a body is closely connected to methionine cycle where guanidinoacetate (GAA) is in a final step methylated from S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). Increased availability of SAM for phosphatidylcholine (PC) and sarcosine synthesis can potentially stimulate endogenous production of <b>betain</b> a thus methylation of homocysteine (HCy) to form methionine. Our subject who was methylentetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) 677 TT homozygote lowered plasma HCy from 33. 3 µmol/L to 17. 1 µmol/L following 1 -month Cr supplementation (5 g/day) opposite to 677 CC and CT genotypes whose HCy levels tended to increase (but still in normal ranges). We suppose that Cr supplementation stimulates pathways leading to production of sarcosine which can serve to regenerate tetrahydrofolate (THF) to form 5, 10 -methylene-THF. This could potentially increase MTHFR enzyme activity which may later result in increased HCy methylation.

Hcy serum was measured with ELISA, and profile lipid by method of CHOD-PAP. The data were analized with wilcoxom test and coupled t-test. Result: The elevation of glucose level at group X 1 : 207 mh/dl, X 2 : 5 mg/dl, X 3 : 109 mg/dl. No significant difference of Hcy level at 2 ppm and 4 ppm. Significant difference of Hcy level of 8 ppm folate (p= 0, 043). No significant difference of trigliseride, cholesterol, LDL level at each group.
