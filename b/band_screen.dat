Disc filters filter the water further, removing material larger than 0.1 mm (100 micron). Ultra-filtration membranes then remove material larger than 0.04 micron, including bacteria and most viruses.|$|R

50|$|AfroPunk {{traces the}} {{experiences}} {{of a variety of}} black punks throughout the United States. In the DIY tradition, Spooner toured the film across the country like a <b>band,</b> <b>screening</b> it over 300 times at college campuses and at international festivals, garnering many awards. He amassed a devoted cult following, largely among minority punks who were active on a message board within his website afropunk.com. Through continued collected interest and participation from the film's followers, the film was a catalyst for a cultural black movement that lead to the AfroPunk Festivals (2005 to present). He discontinued participation in the festival after repeated conflicts with his partner.|$|R

40|$|In {{this work}} we include electron-electron {{interaction}} beyond Hartree-Fock level in our non-equilibrium Green's function approach by a crude form of GW through the Single Plasmon Pole Approximation. This {{is achieved by}} treating all conduction band electrons as a single effective <b>band</b> <b>screening</b> the Coulomb potential. We describe the corresponding self-energies in this scheme for a multi-subband system. In order to apply the formalism to heterostructures we discuss the screening and plasmon dispersion in both 2 D and 3 D systems. Results are shown for a four well quantum cascade laser with different doping concentration where comparisons to experimental findings can be made.

5000|$|In January 1994, {{the band}} {{released}} [...] "A Street Scene" [...] as a single. Although plans for live concerts had initially been {{upset by the}} departure of John Ling, the band carried out a five-date promotional tour with guest musicians (including Daniel Gish, who {{had been invited to}} rejoin the lineup as a guest musician rather than full band member). The <b>band</b> <b>screened</b> the animated Bolex Brothers film The Secret Adventures of Tom Thumb rather than use a support act. Hex itself was released on 14 February 1994. It was licensed to Circa Records (a division of Virgin Records) and released worldwide through EMI. In the US, the album was released on Caroline Records.|$|R

50|$|On 30 April, {{the band}} played the Pontiac Silverdome, their first {{headlining}} stadium show in the United States. While the show's reviews were positive, they said that a video screen is necessary for people at the back. U2 production manager, Willie Williams, recalls the debate within the band {{about the use of}} screens and whether they would divide the audience's attention between the stage and the screen. A video screen was installed behind the lighting tower at the 20 September show at the RFK Stadium in Washington, D.C. so the back half of the stadium could better see the <b>band,</b> and <b>screens</b> were used at most stadium shows {{for the rest of the}} tour.|$|R
500|$|In {{the wake}} of the new wave of British heavy metal and Judas Priest's {{breakthrough}} British Steel (1980), heavy metal became increasingly popular in the early 1980s. Many metal artists benefited from the exposure they received on MTV, which began airing in 1981—sales often soared if a <b>band's</b> videos <b>screened</b> on the channel. Def Leppard's videos for Pyromania (1983) made them superstars in America and Quiet Riot became the first domestic heavy metal band to top the Billboard chart with Metal Health (1983). One of the seminal events in metal's growing popularity was the 1983 US Festival in California, where the [...] "heavy metal day" [...] featuring Ozzy Osbourne, Van Halen, Scorpions, Mötley Crüe, Judas Priest, and others drew the largest audiences of the three-day event.|$|R
5000|$|In 2002, Safran {{launched}} his documentary series John Safran's Music Jamboree. He at times raised {{the ire of}} his former high school principal.

He was also able to gain entry into an exclusive Melbourne night club by dressing up nine men as the <b>band</b> Slipknot. <b>Screened</b> on SBS on Saturday nights, it opened Safran's work to youth 12 to 20 years old, who {{had not seen the}} original Race Around the World material.

40|$|To {{facilitate}} {{reliable and}} accurate modeling {{of the late}} transition metal oxides from first principles, we present detailed and systematic calculations of the dynamical screened Coulomb interactions (Hubbard U) of MnO, FeO, CoO, and NiO within the constrained random-phase approximation. The matrix elements of the screened interactions are calculated in maximally localized Wannier functions. We consider the screened interactions not only for conventional models that include only the d-like bands but also for models that include both the transition metal d bands and the oxygen p <b>bands.</b> The <b>screened</b> interaction {{is found to be}} sensitive to the screening channels subtracted from the polarization function. The frequency dependence of the screened interactions of these oxides is characterized by the two sharp peaks in low-energy region that may be called "subplasmons," which arise from the particle-hole transitions between d and oxygen p states.

Moreover, the diffusivity decreases due to the inclusion of quantum <b>screening,</b> <b>band</b> nonparabolocity and scatterings.
