5|$|From 1915, both boats {{conducted}} reconnaissance cruises out {{of either}} Trieste or Pola. In January 1918, the <b>boats</b> <b>were</b> declared obsolete, but remained in service as training boats at the submarine base at Brioni, {{but at the}} war's end both <b>boats</b> <b>were</b> in Pola, After the war, both <b>boats</b> <b>were</b> ceded to Italy as war reparations and scrapped. Neither boat sank any ships during the war.|$|E
5|$|After the Austro-Hungarian Navy {{had filled}} its most urgent needs for {{submarines}} after {{the outbreak of}} World War I, they selected the German Type UB II design for its next group of submarines in mid 1915. Orders {{for the first six}} <b>boats</b> <b>were</b> placed in October 1915 with the Austrian firm of Cantiere Navale Triestino and the Hungarian firm of Ganz Danubius. Two more <b>boats</b> <b>were</b> ordered in 1916, bringing the class total to eight.|$|E
5|$|From 1749, iron from Pentyrch was {{initially}} {{transported to the}} works using pack-horses, then tub <b>boats</b> <b>were</b> used on the Taff passing onto the feeder via a lock at Radyr Weir. Parts of this lock can still be seen beside the feeder sluice. In 1815 the tub <b>boats</b> <b>were</b> discontinued and a tramway built along the Taff. There is a public picnic site by the Radyr weir.|$|E
50|$|The <b>boat</b> <b>was</b> {{built in}} 1920 in Kiel, Germany at the Friedrich Krupp Germaniawerft shipyard. The <b>boat</b> <b>was</b> once {{run as a}} two-master and was almost 30 meters long. Later the <b>boat</b> <b>was</b> {{converted}} to diesel power and in the Baltic Sea used as a freighter for cement. In 1970 the <b>boat</b> <b>was</b> decommissioned.|$|R
50|$|The <b>boats</b> <b>are</b> called shōrōbune (精霊船). The <b>boats</b> <b>are</b> said {{to carry}} {{the souls of the}} {{deceased}} on them. The <b>boats</b> <b>are</b> mainly built by people who have lost a family member in the last year, though they are also built by others.|$|R
50|$|There {{are also}} two other Stämpfli fours, most other <b>boats</b> <b>are</b> Janousek. The {{majority}} of <b>boats</b> <b>are</b> built for scull and sweep rigging for versatility, also necessary {{due to the}} limited boat racking space, meaning {{the total number of}} <b>boats</b> <b>is</b> limited.|$|R
5|$|Sources do {{not report}} when {{any of the}} Havmanden <b>boats</b> <b>were</b> commissioned, but all <b>boats</b> <b>were</b> active for neutral Denmark during World War I. Havmanden had a narrow escape in September 1914 when a British {{submarine}} mistook her for a German U-boat and launched an unsuccessful torpedo attack on her.|$|E
5|$|The {{first six}} <b>boats</b> <b>were</b> all laid down between late 1915 and early 1916. Later in 1916, the seventh boat of the class, , was laid down, {{after having been}} {{presented}} to the Navy as a gift by the Österreichischen Flottenverein, and an eighth, , {{as a replacement for}} , which had been lost in May. The seventh and eighth <b>boats</b> <b>were</b> constructed by CNT at the Pola Navy Yard. Shortages of labor and materials plagued subcontractors and, consequently, the delivery dates for the <b>boats</b> <b>were</b> not met. However, the first six boats had all entered service by the middle of 1917.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the Italian Armistice in September 1943, two <b>boats</b> <b>were</b> scuttled by their crews. The four {{surviving}} Italian <b>boats</b> <b>were</b> taken over by German forces and commissioned in the Kriegsmarine (German Navy), serving largely in the Aegean Sea until they were finally scuttled in October 1944 as the Germans withdrew from Greece. The two boats that had escaped to the Allies in 1941 returned to Yugoslavia after the war. They were commissioned in the new Yugoslav Navy and remained in service until the early 1960s.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{navigation}} being closed, {{a guide to}} Midhurst published in 1895 advertised that skiffs could be hired, and fishing could be enjoyed. The <b>boats</b> <b>were</b> hired out by a plumber called William Port, and his business continued to prosper until 1912, when his boathouse burned down. Rowing <b>boats</b> <b>were</b> also available for hire at Coultershaw and Fittleworth. Another book called A New Oarsman's Guide, published in 1896, suggested that the river could be canoed from Iping to the Arun, a distance of , when there was sufficient water. By that time, none of the locks were workable, and boats had to be carried around them.|$|E
5|$|Each {{submarine}} {{was built}} by Vickers at their Barrow-in-Furness shipyard. B1 was originally ordered as A14 in the 1903–04 Naval Programme, but it was cancelled and reordered as the first boat of the new class. The remaining 10 <b>boats</b> <b>were</b> ordered {{as part of the}} 1904–05 Programme.|$|E

5|$|On the eastern-most beach, Fox Green, {{elements}} of five different companies had become entangled, {{and the situation}} was little improved by the equally disorganized landings of the second wave. Two more companies of the 3rd Battalion joined the melee, and, having drifted east in the first wave, I/16 finally made their traumatic landing on Fox Green, at 08:00. Two of their six <b>boats</b> <b>were</b> swamped on their detour to the east, and as they came in under fire, {{three of the four}} remaining <b>boats</b> <b>were</b> damaged by artillery or mines, and the fourth was hung up on an obstacle. A captain from this company found himself senior officer, and in charge of the badly out of shape 3rd Battalion.|$|E
5|$|Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino (STT) of Trieste was {{selected}} for the contract to build eight vessels, ahead of one other tenderer. Despite the specifications of the contract being {{very close to the}} requirements for the coastal torpedo boat, the STT <b>boats</b> <b>were</b> classified as sea-going. The STT boats used Parsons turbines driving two propeller shafts. Another tender was requested for four more boats, but when Ganz & Danubius reduced their price by ten percent, a total of sixteen <b>boats</b> <b>were</b> ordered from them. These <b>boats</b> <b>were</b> powered by AEG-Curtiss turbines, and had two funnels rather than the single funnel of the STT boats. The third contract went to Cantiere Navale Triestino (CNT), who used Melms-Pfenniger turbines, and their boats also had two funnels. The boats of all three groups used steam generated by two Yarrow water-tube boilers, one of which burned fuel oil and the other coal.|$|E

25|$|The new <b>boat</b> <b>was</b> {{launched}} on Saturday, January 7, 1882. On January 9, 1882, the <b>boat</b> <b>was</b> towed to Portland by the steamer Favorite {{to have the}} machinery installed at the Willamette Iron Works.

5|$|The storm sank three {{merchant}} ships, and {{two other}} vessels. On one ship, the Sinaloa, 21 of 38 hands went down. On another, the El Caribe, all hands were lost. As many as 150 total <b>boats</b> <b>were</b> sunk.|$|E
5|$|All six <b>boats</b> <b>were</b> {{completed}} from 1985 to 1989 at the Brodogradilište Specijalnih Objekata (BSO) in Split, SR Croatia {{and named}} after rivers in SFR Yugoslavia: Tisa (P-911), Una (P-912), Zeta (P-913), Soča (P-914), Kupa (P-915) and Vardar (P-916). Further planned improvements included {{the addition of}} a Stirling engine, either by refitting the existing boats or building a new, seventh one, but the imminent breakup of Yugoslavia happened before anything was realized.|$|E

5|$|As a {{tropical}} low, Erica brought strong winds to northern Queensland. Several large trees were uprooted, {{one of which}} fell on a car in Cape Tribulation and another on a house in Port Douglas. Numerous trees were defoliated and some <b>boats</b> <b>were</b> reported to have been pulling their moorings due to the wind. Power lines were also damaged by the low.|$|E

5|$|From {{at least}} the 16th century, boats from {{mainland}} Scotland and the Netherlands dominated the local herring fishery. There is little evidence of an Orcadian fleet until the 19th century but it grew rapidly and 700 <b>boats</b> <b>were</b> involved by the 1840s with Stronsay and later Stromness becoming leading centres of development. White fish never became as dominant as in other Scottish ports.|$|E
