40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} a notation that highlights necessary {{elements in a}} practice-centered design process and {{which can be used}} to describe a set of common errors committed by design organizations leading to computer-based systems that create new burdens for practitioners. These common design errors result from an organizational tendency to underinvest in modeling error and expertise and using prototypes to discover requirements. The former underinvestment can lead to designs based on uninformed, underspecified, and unexamined models of the relationship between technology and human performance. The latter can lead to commitment to a design concept before hlly exploring the range of possible solutions. We suggest ways to avoid these problems by setting forth a <b>balanced</b> organizational <b>investment</b> <b>strategy</b> that would enhance the possibilities for the development of useful systems...|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} the modal choices, key activities and motivations of non-dominant information technology and electronics firms from Taiwan Province of China in the United Kingdom, {{against the backdrop of}} recent trends in the global economy. Its main findings include the limited prospects of the sample firms' evolution into manufacturing activity in the United Kingdom and the increasing importance of inter-firm logistics collaboration. Among the key policy implications discussed in the article are: the need for appropriate measures to support the United Kingdom's positioning as a gateway to, and a preferred base for intelligence gathering on, other European markets; the need for "high-wage" advanced economies to capitalize upon their not-easily-replicable location-specific advantages (e. g. reputable research-anddevelopment clusters; substantial domestic market) in targeting foreign direct investment in the research and development, design and sales-related areas; and the importance of a more <b>balanced</b> <b>investment</b> attraction <b>strategy</b> that actively targets major global players (and their capacity to attract secondary inward investment) without compromising support for indigenous growth companies.

This research examines the diversification benefits of direct and listed property in a mixed asset portfolio using nine different asset allocation models, including the industry superannuation fund conventional strategic investment approach.

40|$|Purpose of the article: Nowadays, investors use many <b>investment</b> <b>strategies.</b> They can realize {{different}} profits {{using different}} strategies because of different principles of strategies. Author assesses two <b>investment</b> <b>strategies.</b> Calculating different financial indicators leads to comparison of yield {{and risk of}} indexes related to these strategies. Presented results could be important for investors within their investment decision {{in order to create}} investment portfolio. Methodology/methods: Growth and value <b>investment</b> <b>strategies</b> are theoretically described and applied in real data within 2008 – 2012. Using the CAPM model, author divides stocks of the NYSE included in the base of the DJIA into growth stocks and value stocks. Author compares index trends in charts, interpolates individual index charts by trend line and calculates financial indicators. Scientific aim: The aim of the article is to assess growth and value <b>investment</b> <b>strategies</b> which are applied to chosen stocks traded on the NYSE within 2008 – 2012. Author compares yield and risk of growth index with yield and risk of value index and DJIA index. Findings: Author applies growth and value <b>investment</b> <b>strategies</b> to chosen stocks. Sharpe ratio of indexes within whole period 2008 – 2012 is negative, whereas Jensen’s alpha is positive. Information ratio is positive only within 2008. Value <b>investment</b> <b>strategy</b> has lead to higher yield than growth <b>investment</b> <b>strategy</b> since October 2010, whereas before this month values had not been so different, but rather similar.

Conclusions: Similarly to results of empirical studies cited in this article, results of author indicate that value stock yields are higher than growth stock yields.
