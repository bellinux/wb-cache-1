30|$|The sketch in Figure  10 {{can also}} be used to {{visualize}} how EW asymmetry manifests itself in swoopers and off-great-circle paths in TEP experiments. In the case of a short baseline (e.g., Davies and Chang 1968), we can treat the monostatic rays as those transmitted from one location, that encounter side reflections, but still reach the receiver at the other end of the <b>bistatic</b> <b>path.</b> This conversion is relatively simple because plasma structures are all expected to be elongated along B lines. In the case of long baselines, which are aligned more or less with the magnetic meridian, the simplest interpretation would be in terms of rays that follow a great-circle path in a direction away from the magnetic meridian, up to the vicinity of the dip equator. The one-hop path that is envisioned to straddle the dip equator is essentially the one just described for a short baseline. After side reflections have occurred, the remaining distance is envisioned to follow a great-circle path to the receiver (this is the geometry used by Rӧttger (1973) to interpret his TEP results).|$|E

Their characteristics are of considerable interest to the geology, geophysics, geochemistry, and underwater acoustics communities. For the latter, mud volcanoes are of interest in part because they pose a potential source of clutter for active sonar. Close-range (single-interaction) scattering measurements from a mud volcano in the Straits of Sicily show scattering 10 – 15 dB above the background. Three hypotheses were examined concerning the scattering mechanism: (1) gas entrained in sediment at/near mud volcano, (2) gas bubbles and/or particulates (emitted) in the water column, (3) the carbonate bio-construction covering the mud volcano edifice. The experimental evidence, including visual, acoustic, and nonacoustic sensors, rules out the second hypothesis (at least during the observation time) and suggests that, for this particular mud volcano the dominant mechanism is associated with carbonate chimneys on the mud volcano. In terms of scattering levels, target strengths of 4 – 14 dB were observed from 800 to 3600 Hz for a monostatic geometry with grazing angles of 3 – 5 °. Similar target strengths were measured for vertically <b>bistatic</b> <b>paths</b> with incident and scattered grazing angles of 3 – 5 ° and 33 – 50 °, respectively...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} bistatic scatter from rain was conducted, using a 143 -km scatter path at frequencies of 4. 5 and 7. 7 GHz. The ratio of transmitted to received power (transmission loss) was measured for scattering angles ranging from 6 to 130 deg. Simultaneous weather radar observations {{were made at}} a frequency of 1. 3 GHz. Transmission loss estimates for the <b>bistatic</b> scatter <b>path</b> were computed, using the weather radar data, the bistatic radar equation, and {{a model for the}} scattering cross section per unit volume of rain based upon Rayleigh scattering by an ensemble of water spheres. The measured and estimated transmission loss values were compared to test the use of the scattering model for the estimation of interference. The averaged ratio of measured-to-calculated transmission loss for the 4. 5 GHz data is 1. 2 plus or minus 0. 4 dB. The averaged ratio for the 7. 7 GHz data is - 1. 6 plus or minus 0. 5 dB...|$|R
