5|$|The {{diagnosis}} of hypopituitarism is made on <b>blood</b> <b>tests.</b> Two types of <b>blood</b> <b>tests</b> {{are used to}} confirm {{the presence of a}} hormone deficiency: basal levels, where blood samples are taken–usually in the morning–without any form of stimulation, and dynamic tests, where <b>blood</b> <b>tests</b> are taken after the injection of a stimulating substance. Measurement of ACTH and growth hormone usually requires dynamic testing, whereas the other hormones (LH/FSH, prolactin, TSH) can typically be tested with basal levels. There is no adequate direct test for ADH levels, but ADH deficiency can be confirmed indirectly; oxytocin levels are not routinely measured.|$|E

Adults and children of any age can take an allergy <b>blood</b> <b>test.</b> For babies and very young children, a single needle stick for allergy <b>blood</b> <b>testing</b> is often more gentle than several skin tests.|$|R

5|$|A {{number of}} tests {{that can be used}} to test the {{function}} of the thyroid, for the presence of diseases, and for the success or failure of treatment. <b>Blood</b> <b>tests</b> in general aim to measure thyroid function or determine the cause of thyroid dysfunction. Thyroid function tests include a battery of <b>blood</b> <b>tests</b> including the measurement of the thyroid hormones T3 and T4, as well as the measurement of TSH. They may reveal hyperthyroidism (high T3 and T4), hypothyroidism (low T3, T4), or subclinical hyperthyroidism (normal T3 and T4 with a low TSH).|$|E
5|$|Heart {{disease is}} {{diagnosed}} by {{the taking of}} a medical history, a cardiac examination, and further investigations, including <b>blood</b> <b>tests,</b> echocardiograms, ECGs and imaging. Other invasive procedures such as cardiac catheterisation can also play a role.|$|E
5|$|A {{diagnosis}} of psoriasis is usually {{based on the}} appearance of the skin.

40|$|Current nonendoscopic {{tests for}} Helicobacter pylori include {{antibody}} tests and the urea breath test. After {{the administration of}} 13 C-urea, serum bicarbonate measurement can identify those infected with H. pylori. In this study, our aims were to determine {{the accuracy of the}} urea <b>blood</b> <b>test,</b> and to compare the accuracy of the urea <b>blood</b> <b>test</b> with that of rapid urease testing of gastric biopsies. Methods This was a multicenter trial conducted at five sites within the U. S. Patients scheduled for endoscopy were recruited. During endoscopy, biopsies were obtained from the gastric body and antrum for histology and rapid urease testing. Patients underwent the urea <b>blood</b> <b>test,</b> which required the ingestion of 125 mg of 13 C-urea after endoscopy. Thirty minutes later, a 3 -ml blood sample was obtained and later analyzed by mass spectrometry for 13 C-bicarbonate. Performance characteristics for the urea <b>blood</b> <b>test</b> were calculated using the endoscopic biopsy tests as a gold standard. Results One hundred and twenty-one patients (54 infected) were enrolled. The urea <b>blood</b> <b>test</b> yielded sensitivity of 89 %, specificity of 96 %, positive predictive value of 94 %, negative predictive value of 91 %, and accuracy of 93 % using histology as a gold standard. There was no difference between results obtained with the urea <b>blood</b> <b>test</b> and rapid urease testing of gastric biopsies. Conclusions The urea <b>blood</b> <b>test</b> accurately identified active H. pylori infection. The performance characteristics of this nonendoscopic test were similar to those of endoscopic rapid urease testing...|$|R
5|$|Autoimmune {{disorders}} {{can often}} be traced to antibodies that bind the body's own epitopes; many can be detected through <b>blood</b> <b>tests.</b> Antibodies directed against red blood cell surface antigens in immune mediated hemolytic anemia are detected with the Coombs test. The Coombs test is also used for antibody screening in blood transfusion preparation and also for antibody screening in antenatal women.|$|E
5|$|Croup can {{be caused}} by a number of viruses {{including}} parainfluenza and influenza virus. Rarely is it due to a bacterial infection. Croup is typically diagnosed based on signs and symptoms after potentially more severe causes, such as epiglottitis or an airway foreign body, have been ruled out. Further investigations—such as <b>blood</b> <b>tests,</b> X-rays, and cultures—are usually not needed.|$|E

In addition, an echocardiogram can help to eliminate other possible causes such as congenital heart defects or pulmonary arterial hypertension.|$|E

40|$|Background: Colorectal {{diseases}} specially colorectal carcinoma {{is one of}} {{the major}} health problems throughout the world. Therefore, early diagnosis of these diseases is mandatory. There are various screening methods are used for early diagnosis of colorectal diseases. Among them fecal occult <b>blood</b> <b>test</b> is the most widely used screening test. Objectives: The objectives of the present study were to find out the role of immunological method of fecal occult <b>blood</b> <b>test</b> for screening colorectal diseases. Methods : This was a prospective study consisted of 110 patients suspected to have colorectal diseases of both sexes attending in Gastroenterology and Clinical Pathology department of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University. Stool samples of all the patients were examined by immunological method of fecal occult <b>blood</b> <b>test</b> and then advised for colonoscopy and histopathology for confirmatory diagnosis. The results of immunological method of fecal occult <b>blood</b> <b>test</b> and the colonoscopic findings were compared. Results. Of 110 patients, 87 (79 %) cases were positive and 23 (20. 9 %) cases were negative by immunological method of fecal occult <b>blood</b> <b>test.</b> According to colonoscopy and histopathology, 65 (32. 5 %) cases were found to have colorectal diseases and 45 (22. 5 %) cases had no pathology. Diseases detected by colonoscopy in occult <b>blood</b> <b>test</b> positive patients, 18 (16. 4 %) colorectal polyp, 24 (21. 8 %) colonic ulcer, 8 (7. 3 %) colorectal cancer, 5 (3. 5 %) inflammatory bowel disease, 7 (6. 4 %) haemorrhoids and fissure, 2 (1. 8 %) colonic diverticulum and 1 (0. 9 %) proctitis. Among the 65 (32. 5 %) lesions detected by colonoscopy, 62 (95. 3 %) cases were positive by immunological method of fecal occult <b>blood</b> <b>test</b> where as only three(3) lesions were found in occult <b>blood</b> <b>test</b> negative cases. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of immunological method of fecal occult <b>blood</b> <b>test</b> (IFOBT) for detection of occult bleeding were 95. 4 %, 44. 4 %, 71. 3 % and 87. 0 % respectively. Conclusion: It can apparently be concluded from this study that the role of immunological method of fecal occult <b>blood</b> <b>test</b> for colorectal diseases is promising in Bangladesh.

5|$|Nucleic acid {{amplification}} {{tests and}} adenosine deaminase testing may allow rapid diagnosis of TB.

5|$|Other imaging methods, such as ultrasonography, {{computed}} tomography (CT), and magnetic imaging (MRI), can aid in diagnosis. <b>Blood</b> <b>tests</b> {{can also help}} identify the presence of infection: the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), the C-reactive protein (CRP) level, and chlamydial and gonococcal DNA probes.|$|E
5|$|The {{diagnosis}} is achieved with {{magnetic resonance imaging}} and <b>blood</b> <b>tests.</b> Treatment is by the timely correction of hormone deficiencies, {{and in many cases}} surgical decompression is required. Many people who have had a pituitary apoplexy develop pituitary hormone deficiencies and require long-term hormone supplementation. The first case of the disease was recorded in 1898.|$|E
5|$|There are no {{specific}} <b>blood</b> <b>tests</b> that can diagnose cholangiocarcinoma by themselves.

However, they may be useful in conjunction with imaging methods in supporting a suspected diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma.|$|E
