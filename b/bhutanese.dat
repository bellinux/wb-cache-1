5|$|In 2006 the Indian {{government}} acting for the <b>Bhutanese</b> government, {{conducted a}} feasibility study into {{the viability of}} an international airport near the southern <b>Bhutanese</b> town of Gelephu. In the five-year plan (which covers 2008–2013) the sum of BTN 2,826 million had been allocated by the <b>Bhutanese</b> government for development of the new airport. A preliminary survey was conducted by India in May 2006 and the survey team from the Airports Authority of India was to return and complete the final survey in September 2006. In October 2008 the project was shelved, and the <b>Bhutanese</b> government decided that the airport at Gelephu {{would be used for}} domestic flights only.|$|E
5|$|Airbus {{signed a}} {{memorandum}} of understanding with Drukair in July 2003 for two 114-seat Airbus A319-115, powered by two CFM56-5B engines, for delivery {{in the second half}} of 2004. The purchase of the two jets, valued at 3,534.36 million <b>Bhutanese</b> ngultrum (BTN), was the biggest single purchase ever made by Bhutan, and was largely responsible for a 250 percent increase in the <b>Bhutanese</b> trade deficit over the previous year for the financial year 2004–2005. The <b>Bhutanese</b> government issued BTN 1,767.18 million in government bonds to pay for one aircraft and for only the second time in Bhutan's history intended to seek a commercial loan for the other aircraft. However, in October 2004 it announced it would instead seek a soft loan for this purpose.|$|E
5|$|Western flag books {{until after}} 1970 {{generally}} show the <b>Bhutanese</b> flag closely resembling the 1949 photos.|$|E
5|$|In March 2008, Drukair {{introduced}} a new uniform for its flight attendants, consisting of a contemporary kira and tego. The uniforms were introduced for the centenary celebrations of the monarchy, {{as well as the}} airlines own silver jubilee. The uniform was chosen by way of a competition in which five <b>Bhutanese</b> fashion designers submitted entries, with the winner receiving a BTN 75,000 prize. The textiles used in the new uniform were chosen via a competition which was jointly organised by Drukair and the United Nations Development Programme to promote the <b>Bhutanese</b> textile industry and culture.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Bhutanese</b> {{flag was}} flown abroad beside another nation's flag {{for the first}} time in 1961 during a state visit to India by Jigme Dorji Wangchuck. This visit inaugurated a new level of {{relations}} between the two countries.|$|E
5|$|Under the Vision 2020 Plan, the Royal <b>Bhutanese</b> Government has {{identified}} {{the requirement for}} improved external air links by 2017, {{in an effort to}} increase tourism revenue 100% by 2012 and 150% by 2017. Drukair is conducting feasibility studies into the commencement of operations to either Hong Kong or Singapore by March 2011. The airline's commercial manager has stated that preliminary studies show that <b>Bhutanese</b> traffic to Singapore would consist mainly of official travel, whilst traffic to Hong Kong would be mainly commercial, with good prospects for tourism development.|$|E
5|$|Until {{the mid-19th}} century, {{the area around}} Kalimpong was ruled in {{succession}} by the Sikkimese and <b>Bhutanese</b> kingdoms. Under Sikkimese rule, the area was known as Dalingkot. In 1706, the king of Bhutan won this territory from the Sikkimese monarch and renamed it Kalimpong. Overlooking the Teesta Valley, Kalimpong {{is believed to have}} once been the forward position of the <b>Bhutanese</b> in the 18th century. The area was sparsely populated by the indigenous Lepcha community and migrant Bhutia and Limbu tribes. Later in 1780, the Gurkhas of Nepal invaded and conquered Kalimpong. After the Anglo-Bhutan War in 1864, the Treaty of Sinchula (1865) was signed, in which <b>Bhutanese</b> held territory east of the Teesta River was ceded to the British East India Company. At that time, Kalimpong was a hamlet, with only two or three families known to reside there. The first recorded mention of the town was a fleeting reference made that year by Ashley Eden, a government official with the Bengal Civil Service. Kalimpong was added to district of Darjeeling in 1866. In 1866–1867 an Anglo-Bhutanese commission demarcated the common boundaries between the two, thereby giving shape to the Kalimpong subdivision and the Darjeeling district.|$|E
5|$|Bhutan, {{a country}} in Southern Asia, participated in eight Summer Olympic games between its debut in the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, United States and the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, The highest number of <b>Bhutanese</b> athletes {{participating}} in a summer games is six in both the 1984 Summer Olympics and the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain. , no <b>Bhutanese</b> athlete has ever won a medal at the Olympics. Two athletes from Bhutan qualified for the London games; Sherab Zam in the women's individual archery competition and Kunzang Choden in the women's 10 metre air rifle. Zam qualified after receiving a wild-card place from the Tripartite Commission. Choden also received a wild-card place for her entry. The two athletes were accompanied by their coaches; Tshering Choden for Zam and Dorji Phurba for Choden; {{as well as several}} Bhutan Olympic Committee officials. Bhutan, along with Chad, was one of only two nations with only female athletes at the 2012 games.|$|E
5|$|On 8 June 1972 the National Assembly of Bhutan {{approved}} Resolution 28, bringing {{into effect}} National Flag Rules {{drafted by the}} Cabinet. The rules have eight provisions covering the description and symbolism of the flag's colouring, fields and design elements. Other rules relate {{to the size of}} the flag as well as flag protocol including the appropriate places and occasions for flying the flag and who may display the flag on cars. In general, the flag is given as much respect as the <b>Bhutanese</b> state and the head of state. As in the United States Flag Code, no other flags must be placed higher than the <b>Bhutanese</b> flag, the flag cannot be used as a cover or drape (with some exceptions) and the flag must not touch the ground. Other provisions include prohibitions on including the design in other objects or in a logo. Exceptionally, the flag may be used to drape coffins, but only those of high-ranking state officials such as ministers or military personnel.|$|E
5|$|Since then, the {{construction}} of a domestic airport at Gelephu has been scheduled to commence in late 2010 with the airport proposing to start operations in June 2011. The <b>Bhutanese</b> Department of Civil Aviation (DCA) has indicated that Gelephu's will be an 'all-weather' airport that may be able to accept some international traffic in the future.|$|E
5|$|The dzong was consecrated in {{the name}} of Pungthang Dechen Phodrang. In 1639, a {{commemorative}} chapel was erected to house the arms seized from the Tibetans who were defeated by the <b>Bhutanese</b> on this spot. The Zhabdrung also set up a monastic order with 600 monks (brought from Cheri Gompa of upper Thimphu valley) and he lived here till his death.|$|E
5|$|According to the CBS document, the {{original}} <b>Bhutanese</b> flag was a bicolour square flag divided diagonally {{from the lower}} hoist to the upper fly. The field of yellow extended from the hoist to the upper fly, and the red field extended from the fly end to the lower hoist. In {{the centre of the}} flag, at the convergence of the yellow and red fields, is a green Druk, located parallel to the bottom edge and facing the fly.|$|E
5|$|Bhutan, {{a country}} in Southern Asia, participated in nine Summer Olympic Games between its debut in the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, United States and the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The highest number of <b>Bhutanese</b> athletes {{participating}} in a Summer Games is six in both the 1984 Summer Olympics and the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain. Bhutan competed at the Rio Summer Games from 5 to 21 August 2016. No <b>Bhutanese</b> athlete has ever won a medal at the Olympics. The two athletes who were selected to represent Bhutan at the Rio Games were Karma in the women's individual archery tournament and Kunzang Lenchu in the women's 10 metre air rifle shooting contest. Along with the two athletes, the Secretary General of Bhutan's Olympic Committee, and two coaches, the country's delegation was led by the heir presumptive to the Bhutan throne Jigyel Ugyen Wangchuck. Karma {{was selected as the}} flag bearer for the opening ceremony while Lenchu held it at the closing ceremony.|$|E
5|$|In Tlingit and Haida cultures, raven {{was both}} a trickster and creator god. Related beliefs are {{widespread}} among the peoples of Siberia and northeast Asia. The Kamchatka Peninsula, for example, {{was supposed to have}} been created by the raven god Kutkh. There are several references to common ravens in the Old Testament of the Bible and it is an aspect of Mahakala in <b>Bhutanese</b> mythology.|$|E
5|$|Tawang Monastery, {{located in}} Tawang city of Tawang {{district}} in the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh, is the largest monastery in India and second {{largest in the world}} after the Potala Palace in Lhasa, Tibet. It is situated in the valley of the Tawang River, near the small town of the same name in the northwestern part of Arunachal Pradesh, in close proximity to the Tibetan and <b>Bhutanese</b> border.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Bhutanese</b> {{subsequently}} redesigned their flag {{to match}} the measurements of the flag of India, which they believed fluttered better than their own. Other modifications such as changing the red background color to orange led to the current design, in use since 1969. The National Assembly of Bhutan codified a code of conduct in 1972 to formalize the flag's design and establish protocol regarding acceptable flag sizes and conditions for flying the flag.|$|E
5|$|The CBS {{document}} {{states that}} the first national flag was designed upon the request of Jigme Wangchuk, the second Druk Gyalpo of the 20th-century Kingdom of Bhutan, and was introduced in 1949 during {{the signing of the}} Indo-Bhutan Treaty. While the document does not provide an illustration of the original design, black-and-white photographs taken at this historic event provide images of the first <b>Bhutanese</b> flag at the ceremony.|$|E
5|$|The House of Wangchuck {{currently}} {{rules the}} country. This monarchy {{was established in}} 1907. The same year, Punakha Dzong {{was the site of}} the coronation of Ugyen Wangchuck (or Deb Nagpo) as the first Druk Gyalpo. At that time, Punakha was the capital of Bhutan. Three years later, a treaty was signed at Punakha whereby the British agreed not to interfere in <b>Bhutanese</b> internal affairs and Bhutan allowed Britain to direct its foreign affairs.|$|E
5|$|The {{project has}} been highly commended in the British Archaeological Awards and the fort has {{featured}} both in the BBC series Restoration and in the 2005 film Batman Begins, in which it stood in for a <b>Bhutanese</b> prison {{in the first five}} minutes of the film. The British director Christopher Nolan had seen the TV series and decided that he wanted to set the film's opening scenes in the fort.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 1950s, Dasho Shingkhar Lam, former Secretary to Jigme Dorji Wangchuck and Sixth Speaker of the National Assembly (1971–74), was {{requested}} by the king to make several modifications to the flag; {{he is responsible for}} its current design, which has remained unchanged since 1969. The king was reportedly dissatisfied that the early square <b>Bhutanese</b> flags did not flutter like the rectangular Indian flag displayed on the visit of an Indian official to the country. The standard measurements of the flag of Bhutan were thereafter altered to resemble the flag of India, which was 9 feet by 6 feet.|$|E
5|$|Bhutan competed at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, from 27 July to 12 August 2012. This {{marked the}} nation's eighth {{appearance}} at the Summer Olympics since its debut in the 1984 Summer Olympics, and the first in which the nation competed in a sport other than archery. The <b>Bhutanese</b> delegation included archer Sherab Zam and shooter Kunzang Choden. Zam was the flag bearer for both the opening and closing ceremonies. Neither of Bhutan's athletes progressed beyond {{the first round of}} their events. Bhutan was one of only two countries to have a female-only team at the 2012 Games.|$|E
5|$|Druk Gyalpo Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck on 11 November 2007 {{issued a}} Royal Kasho {{establishing}} Druk Holding and Investments Limited, a holding company which would manage existing and future investments of the Royal <b>Bhutanese</b> government. As a result, seven government-owned companies, including Drukair, had their ownership {{transferred from the}} Ministry of Finance to the newly formed holding company. Incorporated on 13 November 2007, Druk Holding and Investments announced in December 2007 that given Bhutan's tourism industry being reliant on Drukair, {{the head of the}} government agency overseeing tourism development in Bhutan would become the chairperson of Drukair, and would be responsible for improving the performance of the national airline.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1981, the Indian {{government}} set up {{a committee}} to study its own requirements for a light transport aircraft. Based upon this competition, the <b>Bhutanese</b> government ordered one Dornier 228-200 for delivery in January 1983, with the option for a second aircraft for delivery in late 1983. The first 18-seat Dornier 228-200 landed at Paro Airport on 14 January 1983, the exact time of landing, the number of passengers on board and even the direction the aircraft was parked on the airport apron being predetermined by the high lama of Paro Dzong.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{government}} of Bhutan goes {{to great lengths to}} prevent outside influences from intruding on <b>Bhutanese</b> culture, Drukair is not immune to problems which affect the airline industry and the world community at large. In June 2008, citing hikes in the price of oil and the need to contain operational costs, the airline reduced frequencies across its network and announced an increase in airfares to offset the increased costs, whilst taking advantage of the lower cost of jet fuel at Delhi, Kolkata and Bangkok airports. Due to its small network which is reliant on fifth-freedom rights, Drukair regularly leases its aircraft to other airlines, such as Myanmar Airways International, Indian Airlines and Bangkok Airways in order to keep utilisation rates on its aircraft higher than they would under normal circumstances, whilst at the same time earning extra revenue.|$|E
5|$|Indigenous {{ethnic groups}} include the Newars, Bhutia, Sherpas, Limbus, Rais, Magars, Chettris, Bahuns, Thakuris, Gurungs, Tamangs, Yolmos, Bhujels, Sunuwars, Sarkis, Damais and the Kamis. The other {{non-native}} communities are the Bengalis, Marwaris, Anglo-Indian, Chinese, Biharis and Tibetans who escaped to Kalimpong after fleeing the Communist Chinese invasion of Tibet. Kalimpong {{is home to}} Trinley Thaye Dorje—one of the 17th Karmapa incarnations. Kalimpong is the closest Indian town to Bhutan's western border, and has {{a small number of}} <b>Bhutanese</b> nationals residing here. Hinduism is the largest religion followed by Buddhism and Christianity. Islam has a minuscule presence in this region, mostly Tibetan Muslims who fled in 1959 after Chinese invasion of Tibet. The Buddhist monastery Zang Dhok Palri Phodang holds a number of rare Tibetan Buddhist scriptures. There is a mosque in the bazaar area of Kalimpong.|$|E
5|$|The Gateway Protection Programme {{initially}} had a {{quota of}} 500 refugees per year, which was later increased to 750, {{but the actual}} number of refugees resettled in most years has been fewer than the quota permitted. Liberian, Congolese, Sudanese, Burmese, Ethiopian, Mauritanian, Iraqi, <b>Bhutanese,</b> Eritrean, Palestinian and Somali refugees are amongst those who have been resettled under the programme. Refugees have been resettled to a number of locations in England and Scotland. Of the 18 local authorities participating as resettlement locations by 2012, eight are in the North West region of England and three in Yorkshire and Humberside. Evaluations of the programme have praised it as having a positive impact on the reception of refugees by local communities, but have also noted the difficulties these refugees have faced in securing employment.|$|E
5|$|The airlines' only {{aircraft}} was requisitioned by King Jigme Singye on 9 November 1990, {{in order to}} allow the king and his party to travel to Tokyo for the coronation of Akihito as Emperor of Japan. From Japan, the King then travelled to Malé in the Maldives for the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation summit between 21–23 November, and returned to Bhutan in order for the aircraft to re-enter service with the airline on 25 November. Due to a requirement stipulated by the <b>Bhutanese</b> government that all foreign tourists, with the exception of Indian nationals, enter and leave Bhutan by air, the country's tourism industry was brought to a halt, which saw the airline paying hefty penalties to disgruntled tour operators. This problem was somewhat alleviated when a second BAe 146 entered service in 1992, and on 11 November 1993, the airline introduced a 10 Executive Class on the aircraft. On 13 May 1991, Drukair was registered under the Companies Act of Bhutan. Service to Yangon, the capital of Myanmar, began on 6 January 1997.|$|E
5|$|The win {{continued}} Kiprop's meteoric rise of 2010 – a year {{in which}} he had gone from a low-profile circuit runner to the 10,000 metres Kenyan and African champion, with a sub-60 minute half marathon best after wins in Paris and Lille. Silver medallist Zersenay received some consolation as he was given the AIMS/Citizen World's Fastest Time Award days after the competition in respect of his position as world record holder, becoming only the second half marathon athlete to be selected for the accolade after Lornah Kiplagat. There were no surprise breakthroughs in the men's race as all the top performers were those predicted to make an impact before the race. However, there were some other achievements of note including: Kitwara's first individual medal for Kenya, personal bests for Birhanu Bekele and Tomoya Onishi in eighth and ninth place respectively, and (much further back in the field) a national record for <b>Bhutanese</b> racer Passang Passang.|$|E
25|$|Other notable {{symbols of}} <b>Bhutanese</b> culture and {{national}} identity are the distinctive <b>Bhutanese</b> dress, the <b>Bhutanese</b> monarchy, and Dzongkha, the national language.|$|E
25|$|KLO {{had also}} been {{allegedly}} involved in establishing links between Nepalese Maoists and Bhutan Tiger Force, a <b>Bhutanese</b> militant organization. This strengthened the <b>Bhutanese</b> government's resolve to launch the operation.|$|E
25|$|An {{explanation}} popularly {{given by}} <b>Bhutanese</b> {{in the days}} leading up to the election for the lack of support for the People's Democratic Party was that it would encourage corruption and be contrary to the King's request for the <b>Bhutanese</b> to form a popular government to elect leadership having (as was popularly believed about the PDP) strong personal ties to both the King and <b>Bhutanese</b> business.|$|E
25|$|The National Textile Museum in Thimphu {{displays}} various <b>Bhutanese</b> textiles {{that are}} extensive and rich in traditional culture. It also exhibits colourful and rare kiras and ghos (traditional <b>Bhutanese</b> dress, kira {{for women and}} gho for men).|$|E
25|$|In 1990, inter-ethnic {{tensions}} escalated in Bhutan, {{resulting in}} the flight of many Lhotshampa, or ethnic Nepalis, from Bhutan to Nepal, {{many of whom were}} expelled by the <b>Bhutanese</b> military. By 1996, over 100,000 <b>Bhutanese</b> refugees were living in refugee camps in Nepal. Many have since been resettled in Western nations. One reason for this expulsion was the desire of the <b>Bhutanese</b> government to remove a largely Hindu population and preserve its Buddhist culture and identity.|$|E
25|$|As the <b>Bhutanese</b> {{government}} {{was unwilling to}} take them into their country many developed nations offered the refugees {{to allow them to}} settle in their own countries which included USA and Australia. As many as 20,000 <b>Bhutanese</b> refugees have been resettled in these countries.|$|E
25|$|In a {{follow-up}} action to the operation, 22 <b>Bhutanese</b> civilians {{were found guilty}} of aiding the separatists with charges ranging from supplying the militants with food to providing services in exchange for money. Another 123 <b>Bhutanese</b> citizens were facing trial on similar charges as of July 2004.|$|E
25|$|A 2014 {{study found}} T-PH110 in one ethnic <b>Bhutanese</b> male, {{out of a}} sample of 21, {{possibly}} implying a rate of 4.8% in Bhutan. Also {{have been found in}} a German individual and another two from Caucasus. The <b>Bhutanese</b> and the German haplotypes seems to cluster together.|$|E
