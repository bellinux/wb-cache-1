50|$|The term <b>back</b> <b>electromotive</b> <b>force,</b> or just back-EMF, is also {{commonly}} {{used to refer to}} the voltage that occurs in electric motors where there is relative motion between the armature and the magnetic field from the motor's field magnets, or windings, thus also acting as a generator while running as a motor.

5000|$|The counter-{{electromotive}} force (abbreviated counter EMF, or CEMF), {{also known}} as the <b>back</b> <b>electromotive</b> <b>force,</b> is the voltage, or electromotive force, that opposes the change in current which induced it. CEMF is the voltage caused by magnetic induction (see Faraday's law of induction, electromagnetic induction, Lenz's Law). For example, the voltage appearing across an inductor is due to a change in current which causes a change in the magnetic field inside the coil and, therefore, this self-induced voltage. [...] The voltage's polarity at every moment opposes that of the change of applied voltage to keep current constant.|$|E

For their robustness quality, a high order sliding mode observer is used to observe the non-sinusoidal BEMF which allows to determine magnetic field angular relative position leading to a so-called extended Park’s transformation.

50|$|Perepiteia's {{process begins}} by {{overloading}} the generator {{to get a}} current, which typically causes the wire coil {{to build up a}} large electromagnetic field. Usually, this kind of electromagnetic field creates an effect called the <b>back</b> <b>electromotive</b> <b>force</b> (back EMF) due to Lenz's law. The effect should repel the spinning magnets on the rotor, and slow them down until the motor stops completely, in accordance with the law of conservation. However, instead of stopping, the rotor accelerates - i.e. the magnetic friction did not repel the magnets and wire coil. Heins states that the steel rotor and driveshaft had conducted the magnetic resistance away from the coil and back into the electric motor. In effect, the back EMF was boosting the magnetic fields used by the motor to generate electrical energy and cause acceleration. The faster the motor accelerated, the stronger the electromagnetic field it would create on the wire coil, which in turn would make the motor go even faster. Heins seemed to have created a positive feedback loop. To confirm the theory, Heins replaced part of the driveshaft with plastic pipe that wouldn't conduct the magnetic field. There was no acceleration.|$|E

40|$|Torque ripple {{has been}} a major problem for the {{permanent}} magnet (PM) machine. It is discussed focusing on the magnetic circuit of the PM machine. Since it is known the relationship between the torque ripple and the magnetic energy that is stored in the magnetic field along the air gap of the PM machine, fluctuation in the magnetic energy was initially revealed. New tooth geometry was obtained by drilling holes into stator tooth to modify this variation in the magnetic energy and the fluctuation in torque. Thus, a new stator tooth design in outer rotor surface-mounted permanent magnet (OR-SPM) machine was proposed to minimizing the torque ripple in this study. Improvement in torque ripple value was performed in excess of 50 % thanks to new stator tooth design.

40|$|The {{performance}} of {{permanent magnet motor}} is directly influenced by the PM structure of rotor and the slot type of stator. An emerging rotor magnetization type of PM motor is Halbach structure, which has obvious advantages in comparison to ordinary permanent structures and in application, especially {{in the design of}} propeller integration system. Commonly, Halbach array is used in discrete permanent magnet structure on the rotor of machine.

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. This thesis deals with the modeling and control of induction machine under indirect vector control with parameter estimation in order to get better field oriented performance. Because of its excellent decoupled control, wide flux weakening region and operation at low speed, indirect vector control is becoming popular. But as the rotor time constant varies the detuning of the control system occurs. Without exact rotor time constant the slip frequency calculation becomes inexact. In this thesis most of the existing methods of determining rotor time constant are discussed, and a novel approach for estimating the parameter using direct measurement is recommended. Instead of injecting high frequency disturbance in the inverter, an extended zero crossing period for a smaller amount of time is created. A complete model of the inverter and the machine is developed to assist the approach. Hysteresis and space vector modulation switching schemes have been compared. The new switching scheme requires the measurement of the <b>back</b> emf (<b>electromotive</b> <b>force)</b> through a transducer. Simulated results validate the claim...|$|R

40|$|Electric {{machines}} are indispensable part in modern industry {{and they are}} widely used in many applications such as power generation, vehicles, elevator, robot, and so on. Owing to {{the diversity of the}} application occasions, different requirements have been proposed. In the applications, such as wind power generation, low-speed, high-torque and high-efficiency electric {{machines are}} required to match with the low-speed load. Currently, this problem is handled by either adopting a speed-boost mechanical gear, or using low-speed machine design. The former one causes mechanical wear and tear, audible noise and low efficiency, whereas the latter one increases the generator size and weight as well as raw material cost. In recent years, another option, namely integrating a coaxial magnetic gear into a permanent-magnet (PM) machine has been proposed. This option allows for directly mounting the outer, low-speed shaft with the load while enables the electric machine coupled with the high-speed inner gear to operate at high speeds. However, this magnetic-geared electric machine desires a complex structure, involving two rotating bodies and three air-gaps, which increases manufacture difficulty and cost. The research work of this thesis attempts to solve the speed-matching problem by developing a new electric machine. The incorporation of vernier concept with PM machine gives birth to the permanent-magnet verier (PMV) machine. Different from traditional synchronous machine, the rotor of the PMV machine rotates at a definite fraction of the synchronous speed, as if it were geared down from the high rotating field set up by the stator. The PMV machine, therefore, can be regarded as a combination of a gear with fixed gear ratio and an electric machine. This kind of machine is attractive in applications which require low speed and high torque, and mechanical gearing is undesirable. The main objective of this thesis is to present the design, analysis and control of the proposed PMV machine. After the introduction on mechanical gears, magnetic gears, and low-speed machines, the design details of the proposed outer-rotor PMV machine are provided. Moreover, the working principle, stable torque generation mechanism and structural features are presented. Due to the introduced vernier effect, it is important to perform the finite element analysis (FEA) for the proposed PMV machine. The electric circuit equation and the motion equation are coupled with the Maxwell’s equation to calculate the key parameters of the proposed machine. The analysis results of the magnetic field distributions, air-gap flux density distributions, flux linkages, winding inductances, <b>back</b> <b>electromotive</b> <b>forces</b> (EMFs), cogging torque and static torque are presented in detail. The performances of PMV machine are compared with other machines to show its advantages and disadvantages. The control strategy of the PMV machine as a brushless DC machine is also presented. The conventional 120 -degree conducting, dual-closed-loop control strategy is used for speed and torque control and the experimental setup are given. The results are obtained and compared with the simulation results, thus verify the validity of the design. Finally, the potential applications for the proposed PMV machine are suggested. published_or_final_versionElectrical and Electronic EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R

50|$|As the DC motor {{starts to}} turn, {{interaction}} of the magnetic fields inside causes it to generate a voltage internally. This <b>back</b> EMF (<b>electromotive</b> <b>force)</b> opposes the applied voltage and the current that flows is governed by {{the difference between the}} two. As the motor speeds up, the internally generated voltage rises, the resultant EMF falls, less current passes through the motor and the torque drops. The motor naturally stops accelerating when the drag of the train matches the torque produced by the motors. To continue accelerating the train, series resistors are switched out step by step, each step increasing the effective voltage and thus the current and torque for a little bit longer until the motor catches up. This can be heard and felt in older DC trains as a series of clunks under the floor, each accompanied by a jerk of acceleration as the torque suddenly increases in response to the new surge of current. When no resistors are left in the circuit, full line voltage is applied directly to the motor. The train's speed remains constant {{at the point where the}} torque of the motor, governed by the effective voltage, equals the drag - sometimes referred to as balancing speed. If the train starts to climb an incline, the speed reduces because drag is greater than torque and the reduction in speed causes the back-EMF to fall and thus the effective voltage to rise - until the current through the motor produces enough torque to match the new drag. The use of series resistance was wasteful because a lot of energy was lost as heat. To reduce these losses, electric locomotives and trains (before the advent of power electronics) were normally equipped for series-parallel control as well.|$|R
