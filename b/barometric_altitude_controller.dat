40|$|The {{accuracy}} {{was analyzed}} of the barometric altimeters onboard {{the space shuttle}} orbiter. Altitude estimates from the air data systems including the operational instrumentation and the developmental flight instrumentation were obtained {{for each of the}} approach and landing test flights. By comparing the <b>barometric</b> <b>altitude</b> estimates to altitudes derived from radar tracking data filtered through a Kalman filter and fully corrected for atmospheric refraction, the errors in the <b>barometric</b> <b>altitudes</b> were shown to be 4 to 5 percent of the Kalman altitudes. By comparing the altitude determined from the true atmosphere derived from weather balloon data to the altitude determined from the U. S. Standard Atmosphere of 1962, it was determined that the assumption of the Standard Atmosphere equations contributes roughly 75 percent of the total error in the baro estimates. After correcting the <b>barometric</b> <b>altitude</b> estimates using an average summer model atmosphere computed for the average latitude of the space shuttle landing sites, the residual error in the altitude estimates was reduced to less than 373 feet.

40|$|The use of {{barometric}} altimetry is to {{some extent}} a limiting factor on safety, predictability and efficiency of aircraft operations, and reduces {{the potential of the}} trajectory based operations capabilities. However, geometric altimetry could be used to improve all of these aspects. Nowadays aircraft altitude is estimated by applying the International Standard Atmosphere which differs from real altitude. At different temperatures for an assigned <b>barometric</b> <b>altitude,</b> aerodynamic forces are different and this has a direct relationship with time, fuel consumption and range of the flight. The study explores the feasibility of using sensors providing geometric reference altitude, in particular, to supply capabilities for the optimization of vertical profiles and also, their impact on the vertical Air Traffic Management separation assurance processes. One of the aims of the thesis is to assess if geometric altitude fulfils the aeronautical requirements through existing sensors. Also the thesis will elaborate on the advantages of geometric <b>altitude</b> over the <b>barometric</b> <b>altitude</b> in terms of efficiency for vertical navigation. The evidence that geometric altitude is the best choice to improve the efficiency in vertical profile and aircraft capacity by reducing vertical uncertainties will also be shown.

40|$|This master thesis {{presents}} a new software system for developing control systems on the REMUS 100 {{autonomous underwater vehicle}} (AUV). Software written to control autonomous vehicles generally involve many components, and issues such as communication, synchronization, and modularity will arise. Many software frameworks have been written to address these issues. To ease the development, we have implemented an interface between the REMUS vehicle and the open source DUNE framework, leveraging its field-tested software for AUVs. To be able to simulate software written in DUNE, we have implemented an interface to an AUV simulator, AUVSim. We have used DUNE to control the heading and the altitude of the vehicle. Two <b>altitude</b> <b>controllers</b> have been presented that use range measurements from a Doppler velocity log (DVL) as control input. The auto <b>altitude</b> <b>controller</b> uses the ranges to estimate the altitude of the vehicle. The highpass <b>altitude</b> <b>controller</b> uses an additional estimate of the seabed slope, resulting in a reduced altitude error on large bathymetric variations. Both <b>altitude</b> <b>controllers</b> have been implemented in DUNE and simulated in AUVSim with good results. A field test {{was carried out in}} Hopavågen April 20 - 23, 2015 to test the two <b>altitude</b> <b>controllers</b> and the heading control via DUNE. The field test showed good result for the auto <b>altitude</b> <b>controller.</b> However, the highpass controller proved to be sensitive to noise in the range measurements from the DVL and did therefore give a noisy control output. Control of heading was not conducted due to an error in the REMUS API. This error was fixed after the field test was complete. The field tests proved that DUNE was a good fit for controlling the REMUS 100 AUV. The NTNU REMUS 100 can now use DUNE as a development platform, allowing reuse of code from related research activities...|$|R

40|$|In {{the age of}} {{information}} the ability to navigate persons and equipment has become increasingly important. A rising number of applications and services depend on the precise positioning that is provided by global satellite positioning systems such as the GPS. However, most people using satellite-based positioning services {{are living in the}} most challenging surroundings for the satellite positioning systems - densely populated cities. Fundamentally, satellite navigation is based on distance measurements from the receiver to satellite vehicles in orbit of the Earth. The receiver determines its location - latitude, longitude, and elevation - and the system time using the satellite positioning system. The determined location is only an estimate: residual errors induce inaccuracies to the determination process. At worst, the receiver {{may not be able to}} determine its position if not enough signals could be acquired. The performance of the receiver could be greatly improved if one or more of the geographic coordinates or the precise time could be obtained from another source with smaller error. One such source is Earth's atmospheric pressure which is relative to the altitude and from which a receiver can deduce its altitude if a reference pressure level is known. To address the problem of unavailability and inaccuracy of positioning in urban environment, a barometric assistance service was designed and a respective software application was implemented. The implemented assistance service generates continuously time and location-dependent reference pressure data from high resolution weather forecasts that are calculated by the Finnish Meteorological Institute. Receivers with the barometric sensor can download the assistance data from the service and utilize it to determine the current <b>barometric</b> <b>altitude</b> consistently and more accurately than a conventional receiver. <b>Barometric</b> <b>altitude</b> measurements improve the availability of the positioning service and reduce the time required for the first position estimate by decreasing the number of required satellite measurements...|$|R

40|$|The {{article is}} {{dedicated}} to flight testing phase of unmanned air vehicle "Pegas", designed for large-scale aerial photographs, but the technique {{can be used for}} testing and other aircraft. Flight tests {{are an important part of}} the process of developing new types of the aircraft. According to the results, the accuracy of the selected parameters of the aircraft and the congruence of the real machine parameters to the mathematical model calculation were checked. To verify the flight characteristics of the results of the tests it was necessary to obtain the true values of flight parameters, but their measurement was complicated by the presence of errors and other factors that affect to results. In this article the method of processing the objective data was considered to determine the aerodynamic flight characteristics of the aircraft, the magnitude of errors of onboard measuring devices, the direction and the speed of the wind at the <b>altitude.</b> The <b>barometric</b> <b>altitude</b> and speed sensors and GPS sensor were used for noting the flight parameters. The accuracy of data sensors was unknown. The barometric altimeter data and GPS altitude were compared and analyzed to determine the true altitude. Despite the specific of characteristics of GPS sensor, some data were excluded from proceedings. The schedule of the difference between <b>barometric</b> and GPS <b>altitude</b> depending on the <b>barometric</b> relative <b>altitude</b> was constructed and totally analyzed. From these data specifying factor to determine the true relative <b>altitude</b> according to <b>barometric</b> sensor was derived. The next step was to define the true speed. This analysis was consisted on the dependence of the difference between the barometric and GPS speed according to the course of flight. The schedule had the sinusoidal dependence. Midline shift corresponded the accuracy level of the barometric speed sensor. The dimension of half amplitude of the schedule corresponded to the force of wind and the position of the largest difference corresponded to the rate of wind. Therefore, using this schedule the direction and the speed of the wind and accuracy of barometric airspeed sensor were quickly determined. In real example there were defined the true flight options and derived qualifying ratios. We have proved the feasibility and validity of the developed method. ?????? ????????? ????? ?????? ????????? ???????????? ???????????? ????????. ? ?????? ??????????????? ???????? ????????? ?????????? ??????????? ?????????? ? ????? ??????????? ???????????????? ?????? ????????????? ????????, ??????????? ??????? ???????????? ???????? ????????????? ?????????, ??????????? ??????????? ? ???????? ????? ?? ???????. ??????????? ? ????????????????? ??????????? ???????? ????????????? ???????? ? ??????? ????????????? ???? ????????????. ?? ???????? ??????? ????????? ???????? ???????? ? ????????????? ?????? ??????, ??????????? ? ???????? ?????, ??????????? ????????, ??????? ??????????????...|$|R
