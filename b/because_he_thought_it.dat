5|$|In 1880 Nansen {{passed his}} {{university}} entrance examination, the examen artium. He decided to study zoology, claiming {{later that he}} chose the subject <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> offered {{the chance of a}} life in the open air. He began his studies at the Royal Frederick University in Christiania early in 1881.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the emperor Lebna Dengel and the Portuguese had {{established}} diplomatic {{contact with each other}} in 1520, Prester John was the name by which Europeans knew the Emperor of Ethiopia. The Ethiopians, though, had never called their emperor that. When ambassadors from Emperor Zara Yaqob attended the Council of Florence in 1441, they were confused when council prelates insisted on referring to their monarch as Prester John. They tried to explain that nowhere in Zara Yaqob's list of regnal names did that title occur. However, their admonitions did little to stop Europeans from calling the King of Ethiopia Prester John. Some writers who used the title did understand it was not an indigenous honorific; for instance Jordanus seems to use it simply because his readers would have been familiar with it, not <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> authentic.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} 1821 paper he co-authored with Henry De la Beche on {{ichthyosaur}} anatomy, William Conybeare named {{and described the}} genus Plesiosaurus (near lizard), called so <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> more like modern reptiles than the ichthyosaur had been. The description {{was based on a}} number of fossils, the most complete of them specimen OUMNH J.50146, a paddle and vertebral column that had been obtained by Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas James Birch. Christopher McGowan has hypothesised that this specimen had originally been much more complete and had been collected by Anning, during the winter of 1820/1821. If so, it would have been Anning's next major discovery, providing essential information about the newly recognised type of marine reptile. No records by Anning of the find are known. The paper thanked Birch for giving Conybeare access to it, but does not mention who discovered and prepared it.|$|E

5000|$|Guitarist and {{saxophone}} player Kirk Pengilly {{stated in}} an interview that he did not like the music video for [...] "Devil Inside," [...] <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>it</b> was [...] "too American." ...|$|R

5|$|Takumi {{felt that}} the best way to write a mystery with a good climax is to reveal various clues, and then pull them {{together}} into one conclusion, and not have multiple possible endings. He said that the biggest challenge with that was to make the gameplay and story work together; the goal was to make the player feel like they have driven the story forward themselves, with their own choices, even though the game is linear. He only spent little time on writing a backstory for Phoenix before writing the first game's story, and instead made up dialogue and developed Phoenix's personality as he went along. He came up with the partner character Maya <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> would be more fun for players to have another character with them, giving them advice, than investigating on their own.|$|E
5|$|Chief Justice William Rehnquist noted {{early in}} the oral {{argument}} that the case presented two questions. First, whether the Ninth Circuit's ruling was consistent with Supreme Court precedent. Second, whether the state courts' ruling was objectively unreasonable according to AEDPA. California Deputy Attorney General Deborah Chuang argued that the Ninth Circuit's ruling was not consistent with precedent because the Supreme Court had never addressed using age {{as a factor in}} custody analysis. Associate Justice Stephen Breyer remarked that he thought a Supreme Court precedent was not necessary <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> obvious that age affects whether a reasonable person would feel free to leave. John P. Elwood, at the time assistant to the Solicitor General, argued that age doesn't make a legal difference for Miranda purposes because it is a rule uniformly applied to all people and that police officers should not be required to get inside the head of each suspect.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} {{response to}} the strike and riot became a political football between the Republican leadership of Indianapolis, and the Democratic leadership of the state. The refusal by the city police to battle the strikers was met with approval by Mayor of Indianapolis, Republican Samuel Shank. Shank informed Governor Samuel Ralston that the strike was growing beyond what he could control and insisted the Governor should take responsibility {{for dealing with the}} situation. Shank asked Ralston to call a special session of the Indiana General Assembly to end the strike through a compulsory arbitration law, but Ralston refused <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> unlikely that the General Assembly could agree to such legislation in a timely manner. Ralston believed Shank was undermining the police effort and told him to order the city police back into action, but Shank refused. Ralston then bypassed the mayor and requested that County Sheriff, Democrat Theodore Porttens, bring in county police to reestablish order.|$|E
5000|$|Ivanov's most {{significant}} purchase was the 1902 Fabergé egg made as an engagement gift to Baron Édouard de Rothschild. Ivanov bought it at Christie's in London on Nov. 28, 2007, for 9 million pounds ($18.5 {{million at the}} time), <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>it</b> is Fabergé’s “finest ever.” ...|$|R
50|$|Black told Billboard that Joe Galante, {{then the}} {{chairman}} of RCA Records, suggested that he record a duet, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>it</b> {{would be a good}} time in Black's career for him to release one.

25|$|In 1925, Lou Dubois of Kingston, {{across the}} Hudson River from Red Hook, bought a popular Silk City Diner from the Paterson Vehicle Company, {{one of the}} leading diner manufacturers. He chose to install it first in an area along {{recently}} designated Route 9, the Albany Post Road, just north of nearby Rhinebeck called Astor Flats. They called it the Halfway Diner <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was about halfway along Route 9 between New York City and Albany. Dubois's wife managed the diner while her husband continued to drive trucks for a beer distributor.|$|E
25|$|In 1982, he met {{his second}} wife, Hadassah Freilich Tucker, while {{he was running for}} Attorney General of Connecticut. Hadassah Tucker's parents were Holocaust survivors. According to Washington Jewish Week, Lieberman called her for a date <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> would be {{interesting}} to go out with someone named Hadassah. (Hadassah {{is the name of the}} Women's Zionist Organization of America). Since March 2005, Hadassah Lieberman has worked for Hill & Knowlton, a lobbying firm based in New York City, as a senior counselor in its health and pharmaceuticals practice. She has held senior positions at the Hospital of Saint Raphael in New Haven, the American Committee for Shaare Zedek Medical Center in Jerusalem, Association of Public-Safety Communications Officials-International (APCO), Pfizer, National Research Council, Hoffmann-La Roche, and Lehman Brothers.|$|E

5000|$|In 2010, Allan Caswell {{initiated}} {{a lawsuit against}} ATV/Sony, who published both his song, [...] "On The Inside" [...] and the Alabama song [...] "Christmas In Dixie", <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>it</b> plagiarized the theme song he wrote for Prisoner, On the Inside. This action was based on ATV Sony commissioning a copyright expert to provide advice as to whether a plagiarism had taken place.|$|R

25|$|For 14 days in 1901, Rusk {{assisted}} Harry Fielding Reid in mapping Mount Adams. Before they began, they ascended Adams {{with two}} others, Nelson B. Brooks and Dr. H. S. Goddard, and then circled the mountain with Rusk leading. As they {{came around the}} mountain, Rusk suggested names for several of the glaciers. He wanted to name Adams Glacier as Reid Glacier in honor of Reid; however, Reid insisted {{that it should be}} named something else <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> improper to place his own name on the map that he was making and the Mazamas were trying to name a glacier on Mount Hood after him. This eventually persuaded Rusk, but years later when he wrote Tales, Rusk repeated his wish that the glacier be known as Reid Glacier. Rusk also recommended that the Lyman Glacier be named as such in honor of William Denison Lyman, who had done some to the first research into Adams. Reid officially named Rusk Glacier after him.|$|E
25|$|To hear Edward's voice, Bella {{attempts}} cliff-diving {{and nearly}} drowns, {{but she is}} saved by Jacob. Edward, after mistakenly being informed that Bella has committed suicide, travels to Volterra, Italy, to request the Volturi to destroy him. Alice returns to Forks and discovers Bella is alive; she and Bella pursue Edward to Italy and successfully prevent him from showing himself in daylight to humans, an act {{that would result in}} his execution. The trio are taken to the Volturi. Because Bella knows about vampires, the Volturi want to kill her, but Alice claims she has foreseen Bella becoming a vampire. Because most humans are unaware that vampires exist, the Volturi threaten to kill Bella if this does not happen soon. Upon returning home, Edward tells Bella that he never stopped loving her, and he only left Forks <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> would protect her. He apologizes for his misguided action and asks for her forgiveness, which Bella quickly grants. Bella, intent on becoming a vampire, decides that Edward's family should vote on her fate. All but Rosalie and Edward vote for her to be changed, but Edward agrees to change her himself if she will marry him.|$|E
25|$|On the May 20 {{edition of}} Impact! Joe was ranked number {{ten in the}} first ever TNA Championship Committee rankings for a World Heavyweight Championship title shot. He began his climb up the rankings by {{defeating}} Hernandez on June 17, number four ranked A.J. Styles on July 1 and by wrestling number two ranked Jeff Hardy to a ten-minute time limit draw on the July 22 edition of Impact!. After the match with Hardy, Joe was upset with the production crew for starting a countdown to the time limit draw, when Joe specifically requested not to start one <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> would reveal {{the ending of the}} match early. Because of his outburst, Joe was suspended from TNA indefinitely. Joe returned from his suspension on August 23 at the tapings of the August 26 edition of Impact! to defeat Orlando Jordan. The following week on Impact!, Joe aligned himself with Jeff Jarrett and Hulk Hogan in their war with Sting and Kevin Nash. At No Surrender Joe and Jarrett defeated Sting and Nash in a tag team match, when Joe choked out Sting, after Jarrett had hit him with his baseball bat behind Joe's back. At Bound for Glory Joe and Jarrett faced Sting, Nash and their newest ally D'Angelo Dinero in a handicap match, after Hulk Hogan, who was scheduled to team with Joe and Jarrett, was forced to pull out due to a back surgery. At the end of the match Jarrett abandoned Joe and left him to be pinned by Nash. Later in the night it was revealed that Hogan was in fact in the building as he helped Jeff Hardy win the TNA World Heavyweight Championship and formed a new heel alliance with Hardy, Eric Bischoff, Jeff Jarrett and Abyss.|$|E

5000|$|I {{believe that}} was a Glenn title. I think he was {{ambivalent}} about <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>it</b> was a bit too obvious or {{too much of a}} cliché because of the drink that was so popular then. I said, 'No-Look at it from a different point of view. You've been drinking straight tequila all night and the sun is coming up!' It {{turned out to be a}} really great song.|$|R
5000|$|In October 1996, Dean told Billboard {{magazine}} that {{he chose to}} cut the song <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>it</b> {{was different from the}} material that he had cut before; he called it a [...] "one-on-one, man-to-woman song". He recorded the vocals in one take. He also said that he had heard Mike Reid, the original co-writer, sing it and it [...] "knocked him out". Richard Murray directed the video for Dean's version.|$|R

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Dan Greaney, and {{directed}} by Mark Kirkland. It was Greaney's second episode on The Simpsons. The staff of the show {{wanted to do a}} summer episode because there was [...] "so much stuff" [...] about summer vacations that they felt had to be covered in an episode.

500|$|The Whopper {{was created}} in 1957 by Burger King co-founder James McLamore and {{originally}} sold for 37¢ (equivalent to US$3.26 in 2017).

Believing {{that the success of}} the rival product was its size, he devised the Whopper, naming it so <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> conveyed [...] "imagery of something big". Major fast food chains did not release a similar product, until the McDonald's Quarter Pounder and the Burger Chef Big Shef in the early 1970s.|$|E
500|$|Stephen James Walker, {{a writer}} of {{reference}} works on Doctor Who, included an extensive analysis and review of the episode in his [...] "unauthorised guide to Doctor Who's fourth series", Monsters Within.

He was surprised that the format of a [...] "companion-lite" [...] episode followed by a [...] "Doctor-lite" [...] episode had not been attempted before <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was an [...] "ideal compromise".|$|E
