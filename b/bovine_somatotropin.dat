The rbST has increased milk production in dairy animals, including cow, sheep and goats. There are management factors including dosage of rbST, injection interval, genetic potential and environmental conditions which affect {{the magnitude of}} the animal-response to rbST. For dairy cows, the optimal dose of rbST treatment is between 25 and 50 mg/day. Daily injection of rbST may produce better response, but sustained-release formulations of rbST are more practical. The magnitude of milk production response to rbST range from 10 to 35 % in dairy cows. The rbST has no or little effects on the milk composition, processing properties and taste. The rbST did not affect digestion of feeds or the efficiency of utilizing absorbed nutrients for milk synthesis, and it has no or little effect on rumen fermentation, flow of nutrients to the small intestine and total tract digestibility, but it improves the feed efficiency in dairy cows. The rbST induced significant increase in serum bST. It has a galactopoietic effect, since it increase the metabolic activity of mammary cells or slow their involution, thereby allowing more secretory cells to persist over time and contribute to increasing milk synthesis and yield.

As direct detection of rbST in serum is problematic, methods based on the detection of changes in multiple rbST-dependent biomarkers have high potential for monitoring rbST abuse. In this study immunoassays were developed for total {{insulin-like growth factor 1}} (IGF- 1) in cow sera. Ultimately aiming at combination with other rbST-dependent biomarker assays two multiplex formats were studied and compared critically, a multi-channel surface plasmon resonance (SPR) -based biosensor and flow cytometry combined with color encoded microbeads. Moreover, a new dedicated sample pretreatment was developed for the dissociation of complexed IGF- 1 in serum, while keeping other biomarkers in solution. Compared to the SPR biosensor immunoassay, the flow cytometric immunoassay (FCIA) was more sensitive, less antibody-consuming and less vulnerable to necessary but interfering reagents from the sample treatment. In an initial in-house validation study the developed FCIA showed to be fast, specific, robust, and a high repeatability and reliability, and generated realistic IGF- 1 values for bovine serum, without compromising the potential for simultaneous detection of other biomarkers. Due to the xMAP technology, in which 100 different bead sets can be measured simultaneously, the total IGF- 1 assay can easily be extended with other immunoassays for candidate biomarkers.

None of the fractions contained immunoreactive prolactin and all were equally lipolytic. Although fraction A contained a small quantity of immunoreactive growth hormone it had no growth-promoting or diabetogenic activities. Both fractions B and C were diabetogenic and contained high concentrations of immunoreactive growth hormone, consistent with their growth-promoting activity. Although the growth-promoting activity of fraction D was higher than that of the other three fractions, it was not diabetogenic and was only weakly immunoreactive. These results for bovine growth hormone support the contention that growth hormone, as commonly extracted, is a mixture of different molecular forms and that these different metabolic properties of the hormone might be explained in terms of this heterogeneity...|$|R
40|$|The somatotropic axis is {{important}} in the regulation of growth and development. In beef cattle, manipulation of the somatotropic axis through the use of <b>bovine</b> (b) <b>somatotropin</b> (ST) has been reported to increase growth rate, and improve feed efficiency and carcass quality. We have reported an age-related response to bST treatment in growing calves, which may be associated with changes in insulin-like growth factor (IGF) binding proteins (BP) - 2 and - 3. Changes in components of the somatotropic axis, ST, IGF-I, IGFBP- 2, and IGFBP- 3, have been examined in cattle, however samples analyzed for IGFBP have been collected at infrequent intervals and in response to different physiological states. Therefore, the first objective of this dissertation was to examine the ontogeny of the somatotropic axis every week, from birth to one year of age, in growing Hereford calves. The second objective was to examine the response of the somatotropic axis to bST, every 50 d, from birth to one year of age. In experiment one, males began to grow faster than females at about 110 d of age. At this same time point, concentrations of ST began to decline in the males and concentrations of IGF-I began to plateau in males and females. Average concentrations of IGFBP- 3 were greater in males, and concentrations of IGFBP- 2 were greater in females. In experiment two, all calves were responsive to bST treatment beginning at birth, with an increase in ST, IGF-I, and IGFBP- 3. Similar to experiment one, age-related changes were observed, however increased growth rate and greater concentrations of IGFBP- 3 in males were not observed. Similar to our previous work, in which growth rate was increased in bST treated calves older than 250 d of age, concentrations of IGFBP- 3 increased following bST treatment at 250 d of age. This indicates the importance of IGFBP- 3 in the growth response to bST treatment in calves. Therefore, we conclude that calves are more responsive to bST at about 250 d of age due to the greater magnitude of response in concentrations of IGFBP- 3. ...|$|R

J. 146, 141 – 155]. After periodic additions, there were increases (compared with values for non-hormone-treated suspensions) in the concurrent absolute syntheses of α 1 (acute-phase) glycoprotein and of albumin. Trends were detectable after 24 h, and significant increases were demonstrated after 48 h of incubation (219 and 119 % respectively of control values). Manipulation of hormones, by omission from the mixture or by addition of {{only one or two}} hormones in various combinations, indicated that for α 1 (acute-phase) glycoprotein (which may be representative of some other acute-phase proteins), cortisol {{was one of the most}} important hormones involved in the stimulation of synthesis, with glucagon enhancing the effect of cortisol but not being stimulatory by itself. Addition of actinomycin D inhibited this stimulation, suggesting that cortisol might have acted through promotion of RNA synthesis. For albumin, cortisol alone did not stimulate synthesis, but its absence from a hormone mixture significantly decreased synthesis compared with that observed with the complete hormone mixture. Our findings support the possibility that following tissue injury, synthesis of α 1 (acute-phase) glycoprotein may be stimulated by the hormonal response to this injury (which response includes elevated blood concentrations of cortisol and glucagon) ...|$|R
40|$|Biotechnology, {{especially}} genetic engineering, is {{a revolutionary}} tool in life-science research. When it came, {{people thought it}} would have the greatest impact both on pharmaceutical and agriculture industries, because both are directly based on knowledge of life-science. As a matter of fact, a lot of knowledge of life at molecular level has been produced using the technology and it is giving big impacts to various industries. With respect to agriculture, to accumulate knowledge on plant physiology {{at the molecular level}} is important not just for plant genetic engineering, but to develop a future agricultural system that will be sustainable, environmentally safe and/or productive enough to satisfy expanding global population. Though the benefit is considered to be enormous in the long run, investment in the basic plant science is not enough and consequently plant biotechnology is still underdeveloped compared with pharmaceutical. In 1981 genetic engineering was expected to generate $ 3 billion market in the field of agriculture by 1990. This expected market size was four times larger than that of biotechnology pharmaceuticals. However, as of August, 1991, there is no commercially available products of genetic engineering in agricultural field except for some veterinary vaccines. On the other hand, several recombinant pharmaceuticals have already been commercialized and attained a big market. For example, Genentech's tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) has $ 200 million market, and Amgen's erythropoietin (EPO) has also $ 200 million market in the U. S. A. in 1990. There is a significant lag in of agricultural biotechnology. A typical example is Monsanto's case. Monsanto which is a U. S. large chemical and a leading agricultural biotechnology firm as well, has invested $ 1 billion to develop such products as <b>bovine</b> and swine <b>somatotropins</b> and genetically engineered plants since 1981, but it has no product commercialized yet. With respect to plant biotechnology field, in 1984 not only Monsanto but everyplant biotech firm expected that the tomato would be the first commercialized product of genetically engineering and Monsanto expected that the earliest date of commercialization would be 1993. At that time, however, there was no specific product to develop for commercialization yet. In 1988 the Monsant's virus-resistant tomato was expected to be commercialized in 1992., but this was premature. According to a recent Business Week article, the earliest expected data of commercialization of the Monsant's virus-resistant tomato is 1997 and its estimated market is just $ 30 million. Instead, an insect-resistant cotton is expected to be commercialized earlier and to have a larger market. The expected date is 1996 and the estimated market size is $ 100 million. R&D of genetically engineered plants, in general, are taking longer time than expected in earlier stage.

50|$|By using cows {{that produce}} {{offspring}} within a {{one to two}} week period, pre-synchronized breeding allows dairy farmers to artificially inseminate cows for maximum pregnancy rates with minimal effort. <b>Bovine</b> <b>somatotropin</b> is a placental lactogen (PL) hormone and falls under the class of growth hormone, or somatotropin. It is relevant {{to the practice of}} artificially expediting placental development in farm mammals, specifically dairy cattle. The mechanism through which the hormones of this somatotropin exert their effects can be observed at the cellular and molecular level in placental tissue. For mammals exposed to the hormone, <b>Bovine</b> <b>Somatotropin</b> associates with N-glycosylated proteins that are heavily involved in placental gestation. Knowledge of this and how BT works in conjunction with growth hormones allows for agricultural researchers to experiment on the effects of pre-synchronization in farm animals. Pre-synchronization involves treating cattle with a dose of BsT before artificially inseminating them, according to a fixed interval schedule. Pre-synchronization and bST treatment may be used to increase first-service pregnancy rates while following this timed artificial insemination protocol. This would therefore allow agricultural researchers to observe the effects of hormones in relation to natural menstrual cycles. Studies have shown that dairy cattle experienced increased rates of pregnancy during pre-synchronization when exposed to BsT. The effects of BsT on this treatment are dependent on the step in the menstrual cycle, seeing how BsT has a stimulatory effect of Progesterone on the corpus luteum.|$|E
