5|$|Prior to the {{dominance}} of the Gelug sect of Buddhism in Tawang, the Nyingmapa or the Black Hat sect of Buddhism was dominant and this resulted in their hegemony and even hostile approach towards the founder, Merek Lama. This problem was compounded by the Drukpas of Bhutan, who also belonged to the Nyingmapa sect, who even tried to invade and take control of Tawang. Hence, when the Tawang monastery was <b>built</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> fort structure, a strategic location was chosen from the defense point of view.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time Japan's 10th Army was {{storming}} Yuhuatai, a rugged plateau situated {{directly in front of}} Zhonghua Gate on Nanking's southern side. The 10th Army's progress was slow and casualties were heavy as Yuhuatai was <b>built</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> fortress of interlocking pillboxes and trenches manned by three Chinese divisions, including the German-trained 88th Division, though the Chinese were also apt to counterattack and some Japanese units were forced to spend more time defending than attacking. Close to every single man that the 88th Division had deployed on Yuhuatai was killed in action, including three of its four regimental commanders and both of its brigade commanders, but in the process the Japanese were made to suffer 2,240 casualties including 566 dead. Yuhuatai was finally overrun at noon on December 12.|$|E

It originally held the athletics department as well as the military-science classes it now holds.|$|E
25|$|Years later, Mantell had {{acquired}} enough fossil {{evidence to show}} that the dinosaur's forelimbs were much shorter than its hind legs, therefore proving they were not <b>built</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> mammal as claimed by Sir Richard Owen. Mantell went on to demonstrate that fossil vertebrae, which Owen had attributed to a variety of different species, all belonged to Iguanodon. He also named a new genus of dinosaur called Hylaeosaurus and as a result became an authority on prehistoric reptiles.|$|E

25|$|Like most early tanks, the Schneider was <b>built</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> simple {{armoured}} box, without compartmentalisation of {{the inner}} space. It lacked a turret, with the main armament, a short 75mm cannon, in a sponson on the right side. By later standards it would therefore have been an assault gun instead of a tank. The vehicle was considered a very imperfect design, because of a poor layout, insufficient fire-power, a cramped interior and inferior mobility due to an overhanging nose section, which had been designed to crush through the belts of barbed wire but in practice caused the tank to get stuck. Improved designs were almost immediately initiated but the production of these, the Schneider CA 2, CA 3 and CA 4, was eventually cancelled.|$|E
25|$|The urban {{expansion}} {{has seen a}} structured development plan for 2027. The buildings {{will continue to be}} built to retain ancient Bhutanese culture and architectural styles but with a measured and modulated blend of modern development, meeting requirements of national and civic administration and all basic civic amenities such as roads, water supply and drainage, hospitals, schools and colleges, electricity, media centres and so forth. The monuments or buildings of note are the sprawling Tashichho Dzong, <b>built</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> fortress, which is the centre of Bhutanese administration as well as monastic centre, the Memorial Chorten, Thimphu and the National Assembly of the newly formed parliamentary democracy within the Monarchic rule. The Palace of the King located {{to the north of the}} city, called the Dechencholing Palace, the official residence of the King, is an impressive structure that provides a grand aerial view of the city.|$|E
25|$|It {{required}} 6 {{years to}} complete the first post-war metro line (a 6.4km section of the Ring Line). These stations were dedicated to Victory. No more Comintern (Comintern metro station was renamed Kalininskaya in December 1946), no more World revolution, but a statement of victorious, nationalist Stalinism. Oktyabrskaya station by Leonid Polyakov was <b>built</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> Classicist temple, with a shiny white-blue altar behind iron gates – a complete departure from prewar atheism. To see this altar, a rider had to pass a long row of plaster banners, bronze candlesticks and assorted military imagery. Park Kultury (2) featured true Gothic chandelliers, another departure. Metrostroy operated its own marble and carpentry factories, producing 150 solid, whole block marble columns for this short section. The second section of Ring line was a tribute to Heroic Labor (with the exception of Shchusev's Komsomolskaya, set up as a retelling of Stalin's speech of November 7, 1941).|$|E
5|$|The Safdarjung tomb, {{the last}} monumental tomb {{garden of the}} Mughals, was planned and <b>built</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> {{enclosed}} garden tomb {{in line with the}} style of the Humayun tomb.

50|$|Eltville lies on Bundesstraße 42, which {{towards the}} east is <b>built</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> Autobahn and near Walluf {{seamlessly}} joins the A 66. Eltville station also {{lies on the}} East Rhine Railway, which connects Frankfurt and Wiesbaden to Koblenz and Cologne and belongs to the Rhein-Main-Verkehrsverbund. On the Rhine's bank are several landing stages for, among others, the Köln-Düsseldorfer Deutsche Rheinschiffahrt, a well known Rhine passenger ship operator.|$|R
25|$|The {{anterior}} median eyes (AME) {{have very}} good vision. This pair of eyes is <b>built</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> telescopic tube with a corneal lens {{in the front and}} a second lens in the back that focus images onto a four-layered retina, a narrow boomerang-shaped strip oriented vertically. Physiological experiments have shown they may have up to four different kinds of receptor cells, with different absorption spectra, giving them the possibility of up to tetrachromatic color vision, with sensitivity extending into the ultraviolet range. As the eyes are too close together to allow depth perception, and the animals do not make use of motion parallax, they have evolved a method called image defocus instead. Of the four photoreceptor layers in the retina, the first two closest to the surface contain ultraviolet-sensitive pigments while the two deepest contain green-sensitive pigments. The incoming green light is only focused on the deepest layer, while the other one receives defocused or fuzzy images. By measuring the amount of defocus from the fuzzy layer, it is possible to calculate the distance to the objects in front of them. In addition to receptor cells, also red filters have been detected, located in front of the cells that normally register green light. It seems that all salticids, regardless of whether they have two, three, or four kinds of color receptors, are highly sensitive to UV light. Some species (for example, Cosmophasis umbratica) are highly dimorphic in the UV spectrum, suggesting a role in sexual signaling (Lim & Li, 2005). Color discrimination has been demonstrated in behavioral experiments.|$|E

500|$|The fossil aroused much controversy. Less {{than ten}} years after 1891, almost eighty books or {{articles}} had been published on Dubois's finds. Despite Dubois's argument, few accepted that Java Man was a transitional form between apes and humans. Some dismissed the fossils as apes and others as modern humans, whereas many scientists considered Java Man as a primitive side branch of evolution not related to modern humans at all. In the 1930s Dubois made the claim that Pithecanthropus was <b>built</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> [...] "giant gibbon", a much misinterpreted attempt by Dubois {{to prove that it}} was the [...] "missing link".|$|E

500|$|Bertuzzi's playing {{style as}} a power forward {{resulted}} in comparisons to former Islander Clark Gillies. As a result, the club hired Gillies to personally mentor Bertuzzi. Failing to meet lofty expectations from the club, Gillies once said of Bertuzzi, [...] "If you're <b>built</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> freight train, you can't drive around like a Volkswagen." [...] Feeling burdened with the pressure of playing up to the club's expectations while his offensive production diminished, he requested to be traded away {{at one point during}} the 1996–97 season. In response, Milbury, who had also taken over general manager duties the previous season, demoted Bertuzzi to the Islanders' minor league affiliate, the Utah Grizzlies of the International Hockey League (IHL). Playing 13 games in the minors, he registered 10 points before being called back up to the NHL. During the 1997–98 campaign, he continued to score below his pace as a rookie. On February 6, 1998, he was traded along with defenceman Bryan McCabe and a third-round selection in the 1998 NHL Entry Draft (Jarkko Ruutu) to the Vancouver Canucks in exchange for veteran forward Trevor Linden. The deal was made prior to the NHL's roster freeze in preparation for the 1998 Winter Olympics.|$|E
500|$|In The Fountain, the Tree of Life was {{a central}} design {{and part of the}} film's three periods. The tree was based on Kabbalah's Sefirot, which depicts a [...] "map" [...] of {{creation}} {{to understand the nature of}} God and how he created the world ex nihilo (out of nothing). The Sefirot Tree, being two to three hundred feet tall in lore, had to be resized for The Fountain to fit in the camera's frame. Pieces of driftwood and pieces from real trees in Canada were collected for the tree's branches and roots, and sculpted molds of the pieces were applied to a steel frame to create the tree's body. According to production designer James Chinlund, the tree, part of an enormous set surrounded by green screens, and other sets presented difficult logistical problems because of the small budget given to the resurrected project. The tree set itself had been a collaboration between Chinlund, Aronofsky, and cinematographer Matthew Libatique to create the appropriate design, particularly the palette in comparison to the biospheric ship that carries the tree in the astronaut period. Aronofsky described the astronaut period as a homage to David Bowie's [...] "Space Oddity"; the protagonist's name [...] "Tom" [...] originating from the Major Tom of the popular song. Co-writer Ari Handel researched biospherics, such as the Biosphere 2, to help design the ship that carried the protagonist and the tree through space. With respect to the glass-sphered ship's design, Aronofsky argued, [...] "There is no reason a spaceship would be <b>built</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> giant truck in space." ...|$|E
