5|$|The elder Hindman {{frequently}} made <b>business</b> <b>trips</b> to Alabama {{and even}} moved {{the family to}} Jacksonville after buying several lots of land there. He {{took advantage of the}} many local business opportunities and was able to provide his family with whatever they needed. He also gained a reputation for honesty with his business associates, which included Cherokee Indian tribes in the area. Hindman became trusted by the Cherokee Nation and was appointed as the sub-agent to the Cherokees by President James Monroe. After Andrew Jackson became President, Hindman, Sr. was appointed to the post of United States Agent for the Cherokee Nation. The elder Hindman frequently traveled to Washington D.C. to discuss the interests of the Cherokee Nation, and in 1841 was assigned by Acting Secretary of War Albert M. Lea to determine why the Cherokees in North Carolina had rejected the government's suggestion to join other parts of the tribe in Indian Territory. Hindman spent almost two months unsuccessfully trying to persuade the North Carolina Cherokees to rejoin the rest of their nation further West.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1938, the Kingdom of Hungary, {{under the}} regency of Miklós Horthy, passed {{a series of}} anti-Jewish {{measures}} modeled on the so-called Nuremberg Race Laws enacted in Germany by the Nazis in 1935. Like their German counterparts, the Hungarian laws focused heavily on restricting Jews from certain professions, {{reducing the number of}} Jews in government and public service jobs, and prohibiting intermarriage. Because of this, Wallenberg's business associate, Kalman Lauer, found it increasingly difficult to travel to his native Hungary, which was moving still deeper into the German orbit, becoming a member of the Axis powers in November 1940 and later joining the Nazi-led invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941. Out of necessity Wallenberg became Lauer's personal representative, traveling to Hungary to conduct business on Lauer's behalf and also to look in on members of Lauer's extended family who remained in Budapest. He soon learned to speak Hungarian, and from 1941 made increasingly frequent travels to Budapest. Within a year, Wallenberg was a joint owner and the International Director of the company. In this capacity Wallenberg also made several <b>business</b> <b>trips</b> to Germany and Occupied-France {{during the early years of}} World War II. It was during these trips that Wallenberg was able to closely observe the Nazis' bureaucratic and administrative methods, knowledge which would prove quite valuable to him later.|$|E
40|$|The {{main reason}} for {{the choice of the}} topic "business trip" and the focus of that {{particular}} sector of labour-law is, that most of us will actually enter an employment relationship one day. The concept of a <b>business</b> <b>trip</b> is well known by the public, yet the specific legal regulations of the conditions of sending employees for a <b>business</b> <b>trip</b> and providing travel cost reimbursement, contained in the Labour Code, are not known as well. The general concept of the <b>business</b> <b>trip</b> and its kinds (domestic and foreign <b>business</b> <b>trip)</b> and the closely related terms such as the place of work and regular place of work are the main concern of the first part of my thesis. The focus then shifts onto the conditions of sending employees for <b>business</b> <b>trip,</b> specifically onto the agreement with the employee and its historical development, duration of a <b>business</b> <b>trip</b> and other conditions like the start time and the end of a <b>business</b> <b>trip</b> or means of transport and accommodation.

25|$|In 1835, Mason had {{initiated}} {{an ambitious}} internal improvements program, which included development of three railroads and two canals (one {{of which was}} the Clinton-Kalamazoo Canal). Mason was re-elected in 1837, but the state’s economy soon began to suffer from the effects of the Panic of 1837. Earlier in 1837, Mason had negotiated to fund the internal improvements program through the sale of $5,000,000 in bonds. This arrangement fell apart in 1837 and following bankruptcies by both the company building the canal and the bank backing the loans, the state was left with over $2,000,000 in bad debt. During his <b>business</b> <b>trips</b> to New York to finance his internal improvements program, Mason became acquainted with Julia Phelps and the two married on November 1, 1838.|$|E

25|$|Every year humans add 25 {{billion tons}} of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, and over half of it comes from their {{domestic}} activity. Attenborough introduces the Carbons, a fictional family occupying an average Western suburban house near a city. Their electrical requirements are supplied via fossil fuels. As Attenborough points out, the Carbons are not bad people, but as Westerners, they {{have one of the}} most energy-hungry lifestyles on the planet. They are a two-car household, and each vehicle emits 10 tons of CO2 {{over the course of a}} year. The power used to run the Carbons' home and all its comforts translates into a similar amount. Much of the family's plentiful food supply will have crossed continents by the time it reaches their kitchen, and will have added a tenth to their annual emissions. Yet more are produced by their refuse: buried in a landfill, it heats up as it decomposes and releases greenhouse gases. Mr Carbon's <b>business</b> <b>trips</b> by air contribute to the fastest growing source of CO2. The combined total of the Carbons' yearly air pollution is 45 tons.|$|E
25|$|At the inquest into Voss's {{death at}} least one witness, his estranged brother, {{accused him of being}} culpable, {{claiming}} that Voss's <b>business</b> <b>trips</b> to the continent to buy anaesthetics masked a lucrative sideline in drug smuggling. This rumour had followed Voss for some time before his death and was alleged to {{have been the subject of}} investigations by the Metropolitan Police. Voss, according to his brother, was travelling aboard the aircraft together with his niece, and they were aware that the authorities were on to them. Voss sought to escape from the authorities by destroying the aircraft using various flammable substances to which his work gave him easy access and then bailing out in the confused circumstances, hoping that in the aftermath no one would notice one less body than there should be. An autopsy showed that, other than some minor burns, Voss was unharmed before he exited the aircraft. The inquest jury eventually returned an open verdict – indicating that they believed his death may not have been accidental, but that they were unable, on the evidence before them, to come to a definite conclusion – rather than the verdict of accidental death the coroner attempted to direct them towards.|$|E
