40|$|BACKGROUND: One of {{the major}} {{determinants}} of von Willebrand factor (VWF) plasma levels is ABO <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> status, and individuals with <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> O have ~ 25 % lower plasma levels. The exact mechanism behind this relationship remains unknown, although effects on clearance have been postulated. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether clearance of VWF is directly dependent {{on the presence of}} ABH antigens on VWF. METHODS: Three type 3 von Willebrand disease (VWD) patients were infused with Haemate-P, and the relative loading of VWF with ABH antigens at different time points was measured. VWF-deficient mice were injected with purified plasma-derived human VWF obtained from donors with either <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> A, <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> B, or <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> O. RESULTS: In mice, we found no difference in clearance rate between plasma-derived <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> A, <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> B and <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> O VWF. Faster clearance of the <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> O VWF present in Haemate-P infused in type 3 VWD patients would have resulted in a relative increase in the loading of VWF with A and B antigens over time. However, we observed a two-fold decrease in the loading with A and B antigens in two out of three patients, and stable loading in the third patient. CONCLUSION: There is no direct effect of ABH antigens on VWF in VWF clearance. We demonstrate that, in a direct comparison within one individual, <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> O VWF is not cleared faster than <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> A or <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> B VWF. Clearance differences between <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> O and non-blood group O individuals may therefore be related to the <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> status of the individual rather than the ABH antigen loading on VWF itself...|$|R
40|$|Herein we {{describe}} an assay {{that was developed}} to quantitate the binding of normal red blood cells (RBC), labeled with carboxy fluorescein diacetate (C-FDA), to rosetting Plasmodium falciparum- infected RBC. The binding of RBC obtained from various animal species or humans to different strains or clones of rosetting P. falciparum- infected RBC was studied. A strain-specific preference of rosetting was observed for either <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> A/AB or B/AB RBC for all parasites tested. The higher affinity of rosette binding of <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> A, B, or AB vs. O RBC was reflected in larger rosettes when a given parasite was grown in RBC of the preferred <b>blood</b> <b>group.</b> The small size of the rosettes formed when P. falciparum was grown in <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> O RBC may be the in vitro correlate of the relative protection against cerebral malaria afforded by belonging to <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> O rather than to <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> A or B. Rosettes of a <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> A-preferring parasite could be completely disrupted by heparin only when grown in <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> O or B RBC, but not when grown in <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> A RBC. Similarly, the rosettes of a <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> B-preferring parasite could be more easily disrupted by heparin when grown in <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> O or A RBC than when grown in <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> B RBC. Several different saccharides inhibited rosetting of group O RBC, including two monosaccharides that are basic components of heparin. The rosetting of the same parasites grown in <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> A or B RBC was less sensitive to heparin and was specifically inhibited only by the terminal mono- and trisaccharides of the A and the B <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> antigens, the H disaccharide, and fucose. Our results suggest that rosetting is mediated by multiple lectin-like interactions, the usage of which rely on the parasite phenotype and whether the receptors are present on the host cell or not...|$|R

40|$|A {{transfusion}} of donor {{red blood}} cells can be life saving In individuals with massive blood loss due to an accident or surgery or in individuals with constitutive anemia due to a defect in erythropoiesis. Donor blood can, however, not be simply transfused to every patient. When a recipient of a red blood cell transfusion has an antibody to a <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> antigen present {{on the surface of}} the transfused donor {{red blood cells}}, the recipient’s immune system can destroy all donor red blood cells resulting in a sometimes fatal transfusion reaction. Consequently, it is very important to transfuse compatible donor red blood cells. At this moment <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> antigen status is determined via serology, but serology is sometimes inconvenient or not possible. Genotyping of <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> antigens can replace serology. To correctly genotype <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> antigen status the genetic basis of a <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> and the effect of genetic variation in <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> alleles must be known.

Finally, the developed <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> genotyping assay can correctly determine the status of almost all <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> antigens. In conclusion, when genotyping of <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> antigens replaces serology blood transfusions can be better adjusted between donor and recipient and the amount of (fatal) transfusion reactions will be further diminished...|$|R
