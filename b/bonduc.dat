Total phenol and flavonoids contents in the said extract were measured biochemically as per standard methods. Results were compared with butylated hydroxyl toluene and α-tocopherol. Results indicated that hydro-methanolic extract has strong scavenging activity on 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl radical with IC 50 value 157. 4 μg/ml, hydroxyl radical with IC 50 value 61. 9 μg/ml and hydrogen peroxide with IC 50 value 64. 32 μg/ml.
