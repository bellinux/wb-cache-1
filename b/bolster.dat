In 2001, the company put forth a plan to float approximately 20 percent of BKC on the NYSE. Burger King's franchises representation group, The National Franchise Association (NFA), sought to block this because it believed that any money raised from the issue would not be put into helping <b>bolster</b> the then flagging BK, but would instead end up being used to help Diageo <b>bolster</b> its liquor brands.|$|E

3000|$|<b>Bolstered</b> {{estimation}} {{was proposed}} in [27]. It has shown promising performance for small sample sizes {{in terms of}} root mean square error. While it is comparable to bootstrap methods in many cases, <b>bolstered</b> estimators are typically much more computationally efficient than the bootstrap. The main idea of <b>bolstering</b> is to put a kernel {{at each of the}} sample point, called [...] "bolstering kernel" [...] to smooth the variance of counting-based estimation methods (in this paper, we adopt Gaussian <b>bolstering</b> kernels). When the classifiers are overfitted, and hence, resubstitution estimates are optimistically biased, then <b>bolstering</b> at a misclassified point will increase this bias. Semibolstering is suggested for correcting this, by conducting no <b>bolstering</b> at misclassified points. We refer the reader to [27] for the full details (in this paper, we employ the <b>bolstered</b> and semibolstered resubstitution estimators of [27]).|$|R
40|$|The {{authors would}} like to thank Michel Wedel, Carolyn Yoon, and the faculty and {{students}} of the University of Michigan Marketing Seminar for their expertise. <b>Bolstering,</b> p. 2 Bolstering: How Does Choice Distort Product Evaluations? We resolve competing explanations for <b>bolstering</b> (dissonance, endowment, pre-choice distortion) in an experiment directly manipulating whether or not a subject freely chooses the evaluated item. We then separately model the effects of pre-choice distortions on selection and on <b>bolstering</b> of an item given that it is chosen, while accounting for endogeneity present in the data. Our results generally support the notion that <b>bolstering</b> is rooted in pre-choice distortion processes. <b>Bolstering,</b> p. 3 Bolstering: How Does Choice Distort Product Evaluations? <b>Bolstering</b> is the “propping up of what cannot stand of itself ” (Oxford English Dictionary, 1989).

50|$|Span <b>bolsters</b> {{have been}} used for some {{high-capacity}} freight cars. The most common use is for large flatcars to haul large, heavy loads. These cars need many axles to distribute the weight. Specialized Schnabel cars with up to 72 wheels have been built for carrying large heavy items. Often the span <b>bolsters</b> connecting the trucks are connected by additional span <b>bolsters</b> to the car. The use of span-bolster-connected trucks is essential to allow the load to be transported through curves.|$|R

40|$|Counterarguing (<b>bolstering)</b> mindsets {{increase}} (decrease) consumer {{resistance to}} persuasive appeals (Xu & Wyer, 2012). To date, research has neither replicated these mindsets nor examined their boundary conditions. Six experiments {{were conducted to}} (a) address these issues and (b) {{to contribute to the}} scarce literature of consumer resistance mindsets. This research extends the work of Xu and Wyer (2012) in a number of ways. First, it examined whether approach (avoidance) motivation moderates the perceptual, behavioural and cognitive effects of <b>bolstering</b> (counterarguing) mindsets. Second, it tested the hypothesis that <b>bolstering</b> (counterarguing) mindsets attenuate (accentuate) an individual’s ability to detect deceptive marketing tactics (Study 2 and Study 3). Third, it investigated whether an individual’s chronic persuasion knowledge moderates the effect of a <b>bolstering</b> mindset (Study 3). Finally, the research tested the hypothesis that <b>bolstering</b> (counterarguing) mindsets may be activated via episodic recall (Studies, 3, 4 and 6). Study 1 failed to replicate the counterarguing mindset. However, the study does tender methodological contributions to the mindset priming literature. Study 2 and Study 3 successfully replicated the effects of a <b>bolstering</b> mindset and provide evidence that both strong approach motivation (Study 2) and weak approach motivation (Study 3) can increase an individual 2 ̆ 7 s willingness to pay. The <b>bolstering</b> mindset is also found to increase non-monetary, behavioural intentions (i. e. petition signing) and can favourably influence perceptual responses (i. e. product attractiveness). The research also demonstrates that <b>bolstering</b> (counterarguing) mindsets can inhibit the generation of incongruent thoughts and regulate the activation of Persuasion Knowledge. Importantly, both mindsets are found to strongly influence an individual’s willingness to pay which has important implications for both consumers and marketers. The research also suggests that the counterarguing mindset may be activated via episodic recall. While the observed mindset priming effects are weak they are generally consistent with the results reported by Xu and Wyer (2012) ...|$|R
