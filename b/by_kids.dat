The studio made the design rather abstract: the design consists of random shapes on different-colored backgrounds. A ceremony inaugurating the design was held in 2001.|$|E

25|$|There {{was a time}} in my {{life when}} I wasn't popular and {{accepted}} <b>by</b> <b>kids</b> in school. I was made fun of with braces and kinky hair, and being from a multicultural family, etcetera... And it really hurts when you're that age, but later when you get something of your own or you get involved in activities like a sport, you begin to be accepted for what you do, and your personality and who you are, instead of your clothes and how you look and the name designer brands you have on.|$|E
25|$|Tom Petersson and Jol Dantzig of Hamer Guitars {{created the}} idea for a twelve-string bass. Tom Petersson {{previously}} had used an Alembic and Hagstrom 8-string basses, and asked Dantzig to make a 12-string bass. The company initially made him a 10-string bass. Following the successful trial use of that bass, the prototype 12-string bass, The Hamer 'Quad', was produced. Petersson later used 12-string basses made <b>by</b> <b>Kids</b> (a Japanese guitar maker), Chandler, and signature models from Waterstone and from The Electrical Guitar Company. During 2015 and 2016, his primary 12-string bass was one of a pair of prototype Gretsch White Falcon basses in all white and also cream / green finishes. They have been said to be envisaged as a future 'signature' production model. His primary choice of 4-string bass is a Gibson Thunderbird, though he also owns a very impressive array of 4, 5 and 8 stringed basses from other guitar makers. He is also an endorser of Hofner basses.|$|E

500|$|In a 1988 {{interview}} with Ebony and Jet magazines, Jackson {{said that he}} had gotten the idea for the song from a true story that he had read about in Time or Newsweek magazine.

He added that the student's friends' jealousy resulted in them killing the student; Jackson stated that the student's death {{was not included in the}} music video.

500|$|Yours Truly is {{the result}} of three years of work. The project {{underwent}} significant conceptual and sonic changes throughout that time. Grande began working on the album in August 2010 while she was filming Victorious and formally started to work on it with a record label after she was signed to Republic Records on August 10, 2011. By September 10 of that year, Grande already had twenty songs prepared and was going through the process of narrowing it down to thirteen. The first single, a bubblegum pop song called [...] "Put Your Hearts Up", was released on December 12, 2011. The single was aimed at young audiences, perhaps intending to cater to Grande's core audience, which at that time was almost entirely made up <b>by</b> <b>kids</b> who knew her from Victorious. During an interview in June 2012, Grande described everything on the album as being [...] "50s, 60s doo-wop-inspired" [...] and revealed that two new singles were going to be released before the album, one of which was called [...] "Do You Love Me?" [...] and featured SkyBlu. Other songs that Grande had rights to, named and later leaked as being part of the album included [...] "Honeymoon Avenue", [...] "Voodoo Love", [...] "Pink Champagne", [...] "Boyfriend Material", [...] "Tattooed Heart", [...] "Daydreamin'" [...] and [...] "You're My Only Shawty". The latter never made it onto Yours Truly and was eventually given to Demi Lovato to record and include on her 2011 R album Unbroken. as [...] "You're My Only Shorty".|$|E

[...] In April 2002, O'Donnell released Find Me, a combination of memoir, mystery and detective story with an underlying interest in reuniting birth mothers with their children.

The book reached number two on The New York Times bestseller list.|$|E

2500|$|The {{show has}} seen renewed acclaim. Brahna Siegelberg of Slate {{said that the}} aspect that was most {{compelling}} was that the show had [...] "a really poignant critique of the materialist demands of American life". She added that she [...] "realized that Rocko was really a show about how to navigate the adult world; one that could be appreciated <b>by</b> <b>kids</b> for its slapstick humor and absurdity, but had even more to say to young adults—like me". IGN called the show {{a prime example of}} the [...] "sophisticated, intelligent brand of children's programming" [...] during Nickelodeon's golden age. The A.V. Club also called the show [...] "one of the best series" [...] from that era, praising the show's [...] "impressive commitment to expressive character acting, well-drawn sight gags, and cartoony jokes that play with the form's slapstick strengths." [...] New York compared the series' humor, in retrospect, to that of Office Space (1999) and praised the subversive, anti-corporate stories.|$|E
2500|$|As emo pop coalesced, the Fueled by Ramen label {{became a}} center of the {{movement}} and signed Fall Out Boy, Panic! at the Disco, and Paramore (all {{of whom had been}} successful).

Cash Cash released Take It to the Floor (2008); according to AllMusic, it could be [...] "the definitive statement of airheaded, glittery, and content-free emo-pop ... the transformation of emo from the expression of intensely felt, ripped-from-the-throat feelings played by bands directly influenced by post-punk and hardcore to mall-friendly Day-Glo pop played <b>by</b> <b>kids</b> who look about as authentic as the [...] "punks" [...] on an old episode of Quincy did back in the '70s was made pretty much complete". You Me at Six released their 2008 debut album, Take Off Your Colours, described by AllMusic's Jon O'Brien as [...] "follow the 'emo-pop for dummies' handbook word-for-word." [...] The album was certified gold in the UK.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} years, Santa Claus {{presented}} a popular attraction and featured a U.S. {{post office and}} Christmas related buildings.

The post office was widely used in December <b>by</b> <b>kids</b> sending letters to the town addressed to Santa and by adults wanting their letters postmarked from [...] "Santa Claus."
