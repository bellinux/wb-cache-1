50|$|<b>Brown</b> <b>spider</b> monkeys mainly forage in the {{canopies}} {{of forests}} and rely mostly on their senses of sight, smell, taste, and touch to find food. <b>Brown</b> <b>spider</b> monkeys are mainly herbivores and frugivores. A main {{component of the}} <b>brown</b> <b>spider</b> monkey’s diet is ripe fruit. 83% of their diet is lipid rich fruits. However, in drier seasons where fruit is less abundant, <b>brown</b> <b>spider</b> monkeys feed on leaves, seeds, flowers, bark, honey, decaying wood, and occasionally insects such as termites and caterpillars. <b>Brown</b> <b>spider</b> monkeys feed on different species of figs year around. Scientists have observed spider monkeys eating soil and clay, and hypothesized that {{the reasons for this}} behavior could be to obtain minerals from the soil, for phosphorus, or in order to maintain a pH-balance in their digestive system. <b>Brown</b> <b>spider</b> monkeys find water to drink on the forest floor at “salado sites.” Competition for food occurs between spider monkeys and other frugivorous primates.|$|R

40|$|Background: <b>Brown</b> recluse <b>spider</b> bites cause {{significant}} trauma via their tissue toxic venom. Diagnosis {{of these}} injuries and envenomation {{is difficult and}} many times presumptive. Treatment is varied and dependent upon presentation and course of injury. Materials and Methods: We present {{a case of a}} previously unreported incidence of osteomyelitis of the mandible {{as a result of a}} <b>brown</b> recluse <b>spider</b> bite. A review of the literature and discussion of diagnosis and treatment of <b>brown</b> recluse <b>spider</b> bites are presented. Results: Osteomyelitis of the mandible causing a chronic wound was the presenting finding of a patient with a history of spider bite and exposure to <b>brown</b> recluse <b>spiders.</b> Operative debridement and wound closure resulted in successful treatment. <b>Brown</b> recluse <b>spider</b> envenomation varies in its presentation and treatment is based on the presenting clinical picture. Conclusion: Treatment regimens for <b>brown</b> recluse <b>spider</b> bite envenomation should include the basics of wound care. Systemic antibiotics, topical antimicrobials, dapsone, and surgical debridement are valuable adjuncts of treatment, as indicated, based on the clinical course. <b>Brown</b> recluse <b>spider</b> bite envenomation can be a significant traumatic injury.
