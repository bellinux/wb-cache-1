5|$|Plans {{to build}} a railway to connect Norway's two largest cities, Oslo and <b>Bergen,</b> were {{launched}} by Andreas Tanberg Gløersen in 1871. He proposed that the line run via Hallingdal and Voss and include two short branch lines which would connect to the two major fjord systems in the area, Sognefjord and Hardangerfjord. The narrow gauge Voss Line from <b>Bergen</b> to Voss opened in 1883, and the <b>Bergen</b> Line was completed as standard gauge in 1909. During {{the construction of the}} <b>Bergen</b> Line, the path that ran up Flåmsdalen was upgraded by NSB to allow access to the area around Myrdal. The Hardanger Line, which connected the <b>Bergen</b> Line to Hardangerfjord, opened in 1935, and was the country's first railway to open with electric traction.|$|E

5000|$|A {{destructive}} tornado {{first began}} at about 2:40 p.m. CST in southeast Walker County, Alabama, though its actual genesis {{may have occurred}} earlier. It first touched down somewhere southwest of Dora and moved northeast, whence it was seen to merge with a [...] "black cloud," [...] possibly another tornado which was then moving east and dissipating. Quickly intensifying and widening to about 1000 yd, the tornado grew to F4 intensity and struck the nearby village of <b>Bergens.</b> According to reports, the damage swath {{on the west side}} of the tornado briefly shrunk as it neared <b>Bergens,</b> causing nearby residents of Dora to believe that a row of hills had deflected the winds from their town. In <b>Bergens,</b> the tornado completely destroyed most of the homes and [...] "leveled" [...] the village church and the store. Of the 42 homes in <b>Bergens,</b> only one remained undamaged, and almost 65% of them were destroyed. A nearby depot in <b>Bergens</b> was also destroyed and three of 10 boxcars sitting empty on the railroad were overturned; heavy boxcar parts were reportedly carried 100 ft away. Six people in <b>Bergens</b> died instantly and two more later expired of their injuries; of the 16 remaining injured, at least four more died to make the final death toll 12 at <b>Bergens.</b>|$|R

5|$|The railway opened from <b>Bergen</b> to Voss in 1883 as {{the narrow}} gauge Voss Line. In 1909 the route was {{continued}} {{over the mountain}} to Oslo and the whole route converted to standard gauge, and the Voss Line {{became part of the}} <b>Bergen</b> Line. The line is single track, and was electrified in 1954-64. The <b>Bergen</b> Line is owned and maintained by Bane NOR, and served with passenger trains by Norwegian State Railways (NSB) and freight trains by CargoNet. The Flåm Line remains as the only branch line, after the closure of the Hardanger Line. The western section from <b>Bergen</b> to Voss is also served by the <b>Bergen</b> Commuter Rail, and was shortened following the 1966 opening of the Ulriken Tunnel.|$|E
5|$|After World War II, the 1950 Census showed {{growth in}} Teaneck (33.6%) pacing <b>Bergen</b> County overall (31.6%). Starting in 1960, a {{substantial}} {{decline in the}} rate of growth compared to <b>Bergen</b> County occurred as Teaneck reached the limits of developable land, and the township neared its peak population. Population growth in the 1970 Census was small, but positive, with Teaneck reaching its historical maximum of 42,355. Absolute declines in population followed in both the 1980 (−7.9%) and 1990 (−3.0%) data. The 2000 Census showed recovery in Teaneck's population to 39,260, though growth (3.8%) was smaller than in <b>Bergen</b> County overall (7.1%).|$|E
5|$|Although {{the later}} saga {{literature}} narrates stereotypical accounts {{about the two}} kings, Eystein {{is known to have}} improved the infrastructure and raised buildings and churches, particularly across the coast in Western Norway and Trøndelag, from <b>Bergen</b> to the fishing centre of Lofoten in the north. Eystein's activities were especially centered in <b>Bergen,</b> which became an important international trade hub for fish at the time, helped by his construction projects. His activities in <b>Bergen</b> included moving the royal seat to a more central location in the city and building a new royal palace, as well as constructing churches and the Munkeliv Abbey.|$|E

5|$|<b>Bergen</b> Air Transport AS is {{an airline}} based at <b>Bergen</b> Airport, Flesland in Norway. In {{addition}} to charter aviation and an aviation workshop, {{it offers a}} scheduled service between <b>Bergen</b> and Notodden Airport, Tuven. The airline operates two Beechcraft B200 King Air aircraft and one Cessna Citation CJ2. The airline was established in 1998, offering seaplane charter flights using Cessna 421 aircraft. The service to Notodden started in 2000; a Cessna 441 was acquired in 2003, and from 2006 the company has used two Beechcraft. The company is owned by Geir Hellsten and Håkon Lie-Nielsen.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bergen</b> Aviation was {{established}} in 1984. Fifty percent of <b>Bergen</b> Aviation was owned by the insurance company Vesta, twenty percent was owned by Vestlandreiser, and the rest was owned by various companies based in <b>Bergen.</b> The airline's first contract was with charter tour operator Vestlandsreiser, which was scheduled to begin on 1 May 1986. The contract was secured after Vestlandsreiser on 30 January 1986 had announced that they would terminate their agreement with Swedish airline Transwede, citing the latter's repeated delays and cancellations. The contract consisted of services from Stavanger Airport, Sola; <b>Bergen</b> Airport, Flesland; Haugesund Airport, Karmøy; and Sandefjord Airport, Torp to Palma de Mallorca Airport, Spain and Crete, Greece. To operate the charter routes, <b>Bergen</b> Aviation bought a 99-seat Sud Aviation SE-210 Caravelle from Hispania Líneas Aéreas in January 1986, financed with a loan from Nevi.|$|E

5|$|In 1955 the <b>Bergen</b> businessperson Fritz Rieber {{launched}} {{an idea for}} the shortening of Bergensbanen; the Ulriken Tunnel through the <b>Bergen</b> mountains, electrification from Voss to <b>Bergen,</b> {{and the construction of}} the Ringerike Line. Private financing would be provided through a dedicated limited company taking a surcharge on tickets, equal to the reduction in fare induced by the shorter line; within twenty years the debt would be covered. Passed by parliament in 1955, a year later they had changed their minds and only the investments around <b>Bergen</b> were supported; removing the support for Ringerike. Prime Minister Trygve Bratteli commented that private debt financing would have to compete with the debt taken up by the government on other railway projects, since politicians had to see the national economy as a whole, and that private financing would not allow more lines to be built. The cost was estimated at NOK 100 million.|$|E

5|$|It {{had been}} {{decided that the}} <b>Bergen</b> Line, unlike the Voss Line, was to be built with {{standard}} gauge. So the newly laid line from <b>Bergen</b> to Voss had to be converted {{in time for the}} opening of the <b>Bergen</b> Line. This was especially challenging because of the continuous traffic on the line, with 36 departures per day to Nesttun, six to Garnes and four to Voss. In preparation a few curves had to be straightened, the tunnels widened and the bridges strengthened. On the night of 10/11 August 1904 all the track was changed and in the morning the trains could operate on standard gauge to Voss.|$|E

5|$|On 28 June, the Scandinavian Airlines {{route from}} Molde to <b>Bergen</b> {{was taken over}} by Widerøe. However, while Scandinavian Airlines {{previously}} flew from Molde at 06:45, Widerøe's first flight departed at 08:55. Krohn Air stated that it saw this as a market opportunity to provide a business service from Molde to <b>Bergen.</b> Krohn Air had just bought a Jetstream 32 from Sun-Air, which it planned to use on a new route from Kristiansund Airport, Kvernberget to Trondheim. However, after Widerøe stated that it would start that route in 2011, Krohn Air changed their plans and announced that the aircraft would instead be used on the route from Molde to <b>Bergen.</b> The <b>Bergen</b> service was started on 31 August. On 7 September, the airline announced it would start services from Molde to Stavanger Airport, Sola on 13 August. Because there were few passengers, the services to <b>Bergen</b> and Stavanger were terminated from 19 November 2010.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Bergen</b> Arches Expressway was {{proposed}} in 1989 by Governor Thomas Kean {{to connect the}} Jersey City waterfront with a new railroad line, which would provide access to the Meadowlands Sports Complex. This four-lane road was to follow an abandoned railroad line known as the <b>Bergen</b> Arches. This proposed highway was strongly supported by Jersey City Mayor Bret Schundler, who felt that the road could bring further development, {{as well as provide}} traffic relief to the four-lane Route139. In 1998, this project was allocated $26million in the federal Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century. Both Jersey City mayor candidates in 2001 supported a transit line instead of a highway along the <b>Bergen</b> Arches. Plans for a highway along the <b>Bergen</b> Arches were dropped in 2002 as leaders of Jersey City, including Mayor Glenn Dale Cunningham, favored mass transit.|$|E
