Elliott raps her opening verse {{from the top of}} a pile of large tires while Ciara makes her debut in a gray jumpsuit with square aviator sunglasses.

The dancers wear white tops, torn <b>blue</b> <b>jeans,</b> construction belts and goggles. The second verse features an intense dance and switches halfway through to Ciara in a turquoise PVC dress and black strap stilettos, dancing in front of a pile of tires.

Strauss was a German Immigrant who immigrated to San Francisco during the California Gold Rush in 1853.

The {{material}} was used because it did not cause chafing, unlike the typical canvas pants that were worn during the time by workers.|$|R

5000|$|When dealing {{and trading}} Dior Homme, the {{reference}} code {{is often used}} to place the item within the season it was produced. Here we decipher a typical/standard code: 5EH1015678 E47 B6A8 (SS'05 <b>blue</b> glitter <b>jeans).</b> '5' refers to the year, that is, 2005. 'EH' refers to the season, that is, Eté (Summer). HH refers to 'Hiver' (Winter). '101' refers to the item group, in this case, trousers (Pantalon). Other examples: 102 refers to blazers (Veste), 105 to shirts (Chemise) and so forth. The next 4 numbers '5678' should refer to the specific item, with jeans it will reveal the type of cut as the entire 16 digit reference code will only differ by the first 2 digits in this set of 4 numbers for the differing cut. As noted earlier, the # for this item is 5EH1015678 E47 B6A8, referring to the 21 cm cut. The # for the 19 cm variant is 5EH1011678 E47 B6A8. 'E47',is the fabric code. [...] The last 4, 'B6A8', is the colour code. In this particular case, 'B' refers to Bleu (blue), as in indigo blue, the main colour of the jean. 'A' refers to Argent (silver), the colour of the glitter. Another example would be B6N0 - the colour code for the SS'03 released classic <b>blue</b> distressed clawmark <b>jeans</b> painted over in matte black paint. The B6 again refers to the base colour bleu whilst the N0 refers to the black paint ('N' for Noir - black).|$|R
