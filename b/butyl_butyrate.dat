The release of most odor compounds was decreased in the hydrocolloid solutions compared to control, with the amounts of 2 -propanol, 3 -methyl- 1 -butanol, and 2, 3 -butanedione released into the headspace being less than those of any other odor compound in the hydrocolloid model systems. However, there was no considerable difference between original cellulose-containing and carboxylated-cellulose containing systems in the release of most compounds, except for relatively long-chain esters such as ethyl caprylate and ethyl nonanoate.

40|$|Fossil based energy {{resources}} are dominating the world’s {{primary energy consumption}} for the last century. However, with decreasing crude oil reservoirs and the role they play in global warming by emitting greenhouse gases, the focus has been turned towards improved utilization of renewable resources {{and the need for}} new, sustainable fuels and chemicals is more urgent than ever. Biomass is a carbon neutral resource {{that can be used to}} produce biofuels and other useful chemicals. One such chemical is 1 -butanol (or simply butanol), which has great potential as a gasoline substitute because of its favorable fuel properties. Butanol can be produced from acetone, butanol and ethanol (ABE) fermentation using e. g. Clostridium acetobutylicum. However, the concentration of butanol in fermentation in the resulting broth is limited to ca. 20 g/L due to its toxicity for microorganisms. Butyric acid is a precursor to butanol, which is produced prior to butanol in ABE fermentation. Butyric acid is an important industrial chemical, which can be further converted into a number of commercial compounds e. g. acetate <b>butyrate,</b> <b>butyl</b> acetate and butanol. Arginine is a semi-essential amino acid that has vast applications in the field of pharmaceutical and food industry. In addition, arginine can replace inorganic nitrogen as nitrogen source in fertilizers. It can be produced via fermentation of sugars using engineered microorganism like E. Coli, but like butanol its concentration is restricted to approximately 12 g/L. Due to low concentration of these useful chemicals in the resulting fermentation broths recovery of these chemicals remain challenging with today’s options and therefore  novel recovery process should be developed. In this study, zeolite adsorbents were used to recover butanol, butyric acid and arginine from model and real fermentation broths. Zeolite MFI adsorbent efficiently adsorbed butanol from model solutions with a saturation loading of 0. 11 g/g- zeolite. On the other hand, adsorption of butyric acid was found to be strongly pH dependent, with high adsorption below and little adsorption above the pKa value of the acid. A structured adsorbent in the form of steel monolith coated with a silicalite- 1 film was also used and performance was evaluated by performing breakthrough experiments at room temperature using model ABE fermentation broths and the results were compared with those obtained using traditional adsorbent sin the form of beads. Desorption studies showed that a high quality butanol product with purity up to 95. 2 % for butanol-water system and 88. 5 % for the ABE system can be recovered with the structured silicalite- 1 adsorbent. Further, zeolite X adsorbents in the form of powder and extrudates was used to recover arginine from a real fermentation broth and also from aqueous model solutions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time recovery of arginine from real fermentation broths using any type of adsorbent is reported. Arginine loading of 0. 15 g/g was observed at pH 11 using zeolite X powder. The selectivity for arginine over ammonia and alanine from the fermentation broth at pH 11 was 1. 9 and 8. 3, respectively, for powder and 1. 0 and 4. 1, respectively, for extrudates. Synthesis gas (CO + H 2) can be produced e. g. by gasification of lignocellulose biomass. This synthesis gas can be used to produce methanol, which subsequently may be converted into gasoline using zeolite ZSM- 5 catalyst. However, during Methanol to Gasoline (MTG) process, undesirable carbon residue (coke) is formed that gradually reduces the activity of catalyst. It was hypothesized that intracrystalline defects in the zeolite formed during conventional synthesis may accelerate the deactivation rate by coke formation. In this work, a novel ZSM- 5 zeolite catalyst essentially free of intracrystalline defects was synthesized and evaluated in the  MTG reaction,. The novel catalyst showed significantly higher resistance towards deactivation by coke formation as compared to a reference catalyst containing defects. ...|$|R

Two different process designs was evaluated. In the first design, there were two separate fermentation networks, and the outlet flows were mixed and fed to the esterification reactor. In the second design, butanol was produced separately by fermentation. The outlet flow consisted of both substrate and butanol.

This is due to that butyric acid is reacting with the butanol to form <b>butyl</b> <b>butyrate,</b> hence, the concentration of butyric acid is maintained at low values. In addition, the feed concentration of butanol to the reactor producing butanol was higher in the second process design.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{synthesis}} of <b>butyl</b> <b>butyrate</b> (used as a pineapple flavor) by green chemistry is of immense {{importance to the}} food industry. This study investigated the enzymatic esterification of butanol and butyric acid to <b>butyl</b> <b>butyrate</b> and transesterification of ethyl butyrate to <b>butyl</b> <b>butyrate</b> in supercritical carbon dioxide (ScCO_ 2) with a lipase, Novozym 435. RESULTS: The effect of various parameters, such as temperature and enzyme, loading was investigated. The initial rate increased sharply up to 3 % (w/w) and 7 % (w/w) of enzyme loading for esterification and transesterification, respectively while further addition of enzyme did not increase the initial rate significantly. The optimum temperature for the reaction was between 45 - 50 ^ 0 C.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{heterologous}} expression of alcohol acetyltransferase (AATase) genes in Escherichia coli and Clostridium acetobutylicum {{for the production of}} the esters isoamyl acetate, butyl acetate and <b>butyl</b> <b>butyrate.</b> Isoamyl acetate, butyl acetate and <b>butyl</b> <b>butyrate</b> are esters that confer a fruity aroma and taste to the materials in which they are found. AATases are a class of enzymes that have been found to enzymatically catalyze the reaction between alcohols and acyl-CoAs to produce the corresponding ester. Butanol, acetyl-CoA, and butyryl-CoA, the substrates necessary for butyl acetate and <b>butyl</b> <b>butyrate</b> production, are produced in high concentrations by C. acetobutylicum, making it an ideal host for the expression of genes for AATases. Previous studies have characterized AATases in yeast, and expressed them in E. coli, {{but this is the first}} report of ester production by AATase activity in C. acetobutylicum. The genes ATF 1 and ATF 2, encoding AATase I and AATase II from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and SAAT encoding a strawberry alcohol acetyltransferase, Saatp, have previously been sequenced. Biochemical studies have shown them to possess AATase activity. For this thesis, ATF 1, ATF 2, and SAAT were subcloned and expressed in E. coli. Ester production was determined by head-space gas analysis on a gas chromatagraph. AATase I in E. coli cultures and cell-free extracts produced more ester than AATase II did with each alcohol substrate that was investigated. Saatp produced less ester than AATase I, but more than AATase II. The ester <b>butyl</b> <b>butyrate</b> was detected in cell-free extracts of E. coli expressing SAAT, but not in cell-free extracts expressing ATF 1 or ATF 2. ATF 2 was also expressed in C. acetobutylicum for the production of isoamyl acetate and butyl acetate.

Figure 2 : a) Experimental and theoretical concentration as a function of time; b) Evolution of the concentration of the active and inactive species of catalyst as a function of timeMore than 200 catalytic tests with various catalytic system or temperature were modeled using the model developed. By plotting the experimental concentration versus the predicted values, a parity plot is obtained below. According to the parity plot and the statistical/residuals analysis, we have found that the kinetic model was able to properly describe experimental results. The rate constant predicted for the second step is much higher than the one for the first step (480 000 versus 12 000 h- 1) reacts quickly to give the <b>butyl</b> <b>butyrate.</b> A study on the impeller rotation rate (300 rpm up to 1800 rpm) has shown an effect on apparent kinetics due to his effect on the initial value of kLa (0. 008 versus 0. 6 s- 1).

40|$|Subsegmental {{patterns}} in 85 human livers {{have been studied}} after preparing corrosion casts of the hepatic duct, hepatic artery and portal vein by injecting coloured <b>butyl</b> <b>butyrate</b> solution. A subsegment was identified by the independence of its vessels and ducts from those of its neighbours. In the present study nine hepatic subsegments have been observed: (1) posterior superior, (2) posterior inferior, (3) anterior superior, (4) anterior inferior, (5) medial superior, (6) medial inferior, (7) lateral superior, (8) lateral inferior, (9) caudate (the caudate lobe and process form a spearate subsegment {{on the basis of}} the pattern of their blood supply and biliary drainage). The sizes of the subsegments were very similar in 41 cases (48. 23 %). In the others, some increase or decrease in the size of one or more subsegments at the expense of neighbouring subsegments was observed. These variations are illustrated...|$|E
40|$|A new {{strawberry}} spread formulated with fructose and isomaltulose (replacing sucrose partially or totally) and a {{high percentage}} of fruit was developed in line with the new trend of healthier products. This work studies the influence of some process variables (percentage of sugar, pectin and citric acid, and time of thermal treatment) on the volatile profile of these spreads with different formulations. The ripeness of the raw strawberries influences the concentrations of some of the compounds in the spreads, such as isobutyl acetate, <b>butyl</b> <b>butyrate,</b> 3 -hexen- 1 -yl acetate or propan- 2 -ol. The process conditions have an important effect on the volatile profiles. Most of the esters and alcohols decreased whereas 13 new compounds appear, mostly furans (furfural, 2 -acetylfurane, 5 -methyl furfural, mesifurane) and aldehydes (octanal, nonanal, decanal and benzaldeyhde). In general, the spreads formulated with sucrose-isomaltulose that contained higher levels of pectin and citric acid gave better results in the preservation of the original aromatic compounds in raw strawberrie...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTwo immobilized {{preparations}} from Thermomyces lanuginosus lipase (TLL) {{were compared}} in {{the synthesis of}} <b>butyl</b> <b>butyrate.</b> The commercial Lipozyme TL-IM, and TLL immobilized on styrene–divinylbenzene beads (MCI-TLL) were tested in the esterification reaction using n-hexane as solvent. The variables temperature (30 – 60 °C), substrate molar ratio (1 : 1 to 5 : 1), added water (0 – 1 %), and biocatalyst content (3 – 40 %) were evaluated in terms of initial reaction rate for each biocatalyst. SDS–PAGE analysis revealed that MCI-TLL had an immobilized enzymatic load {{twice as high as}} Lipozyme TL-IM, but with an activity 3 -fold higher. MCI-TLL presented high initial reaction rates up to 1. 0 M butyric acid, while Lipozyme TL-IM showed a decrease in its activity above 0. 5 M. Moreover, MCI-TLL allowed a productivity of 14. 5 mmolg− 1 h− 1, while Lipozyme TL-IM 3. 2 mmolg− 1 h− 1, both by mass of biocatalyst...|$|E
40|$|Enzymatic Reactive Distillation (ERD) is a bioreactive process, {{in which}} enzymes are immobilized on column {{internal}} surface, {{and helps to}} overcome chemical reaction and phase equilibrium limitations. The activation of enzymes by ultrasound (US) leads to ultrasound-assisted ERD (US-ERD) which might display more eco-efficiency than standard processing of valuable chemicals. Reaction rate improvements of more than 50 % could be achieved by the assistance of US. An US-ERD process for the synthesis of <b>butyl</b> <b>butyrate</b> (10  kilotons per year, 99 wt% purity) was designed. A techno-economic evaluation via process optimization was carried out to minimize the annual costs, by using an evolutionary algorithm. The techno-economic evaluation shows that the US-ERD process and the ERD share nearly equal costs. Installation costs of the US equipment are high but they are compensated by a 12 % lower reactive section height and a 7 % lower total height of the US-ERD column in comparison to ERD...|$|E
40|$|The {{advent of}} more {{conservative}} methods, practiced in modern urinary surgery, necessitated a perfect and precise {{knowledge of the}} renal arterial supply. The main objective {{of the study was}} to observe the pattern of renal apical segmental artery in human kidneys and its variations by corrosion cast method. Corrosion casting is a very useful method which allows three dimensional visualization of micro vessels. Sixty (thirty pairs) human kidneys were obtained from the cadavers in Anatomy Department of Subharti Medical College, Meerut after ethical clearance from ethical committee and corrosion casts were prepared by infusing red colored <b>butyl</b> <b>butyrate</b> solution in renal arteries through abdominal aorta. Variations in the apical arterial supply of hum an kidneys have been frequently observed. The present study is a modest venture to further elucidate the renal apical arterial supply by corrosion cast technique. Most frequent origin of apical artery observed was from posterior division of renal artery (4 3...|$|E
40|$|A growing {{interest}} towards {{new sources of}} energy has led {{in recent years to}} the development of a new generation of catalysts for alcohol dehydrogenative coupling (ADC). This green, atom-efficient reaction is capable of turning alcohol derivatives into higher value and chemically more attractive ester molecules, and it finds interesting applications in the transformation of the large variety of products deriving from biomass. In the present work, a new series of ruthenium-PNP pincer complexes are investigated for the transformation of 1 -butanol, one of the most challenging substrates for this type of reactions, into <b>butyl</b> <b>butyrate,</b> a short-chain symmetrical ester widely used in flavor industries. Since the reaction kinetics depends on hydrogen diffusion, the study aimed at identifying proper reactor type and right catalyst concentration to avoid mass transfer interferences and to get dependable data. A comparison between catalytic activities and productivities has been made to establish the role of the different ligands bonded both to the PNP binder and to the ruthenium metal center, and hence to find the best catalyst for this type of reaction...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Esterases with {{excellent}} merits suitable for commercial use in ester production field are still insufficient. The {{aim of this}} research is to advance our understanding by seeking for more unusual esterases and revealing their characterizations for ester synthesis. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A novel esterase-encoding gene from Rhizomucor miehei (RmEstA) was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. Sequence analysis revealed a 975 -bp ORF encoding a 324 -amino-acid polypeptide belonging to the hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) family IV and showing highest similarity (44 %) to the Paenibacillus mucilaginosus esterase/lipase. Recombinant RmEstA was purified to homogeneity: it was 34 kDa by SDS-PAGE and showed optimal pH and temperature of 6. 5 and 45 °C, respectively. The enzyme was stable to 50 °C, under a broad pH range (5. 0 - 10. 6). RmEstA exhibited broad substrate specificity toward p-nitrophenol esters and short-acyl-chain triglycerols, with highest activities (1, 480 U mg(- 1) and 228 U mg(- 1)) for p-nitrophenyl hexanoate and tributyrin, respectively. RmEstA efficiently synthesized <b>butyl</b> <b>butyrate</b> (92 % conversion yield) when immobilized on AOT-based organogel. CONCLUSION: RmEstA has great potential for industrial applications. RmEstA is the first reported esterase from Rhizomucor miehei...|$|E
40|$|Candida rugosa lipase was immobilized by {{covalent}} binding on hybrid matrix of polysiloxane-polyvinyl alcohol chemically modified with different activating agents as glutaraldehyde, sodium metaperiodate and carbonyldiimidazole. The experimental results suggested that functional activating agents render different interactions between enzyme and support, producing consequently alterations in the optimal reaction conditions. Properties of the immobilized systems were assessed and their performance on hydrolytic and synthetic reactions were evaluated and {{compared with the}} free enzyme. In hydrolytic reactions using p-nitrophenyl palmitate as substrate all immobilized systems showed higher thermal stability and optima pH and temperature values {{in relation to the}} free lipase. Among the activating compounds, carbonyldiimidazole resulted in a total recovery of activity on the support and the highest thermal stability. For the <b>butyl</b> <b>butyrate</b> synthesis, the best performance (molar conversion of 95 % and volumetric productivity of 2. 33 g L- 1 h(- 1)) was attained with the lipase immobilized on POS-PVA activated with sodium metaperiodate. The properties of the support and immobilized derivatives were also evaluated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopies and chemical composition (FTIR).
