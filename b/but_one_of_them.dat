5|$|The Melbourne Storm has {{a strong}} rivalry with Brisbane, built {{in large part on}} the large number of finals games played between the teams, {{including}} one final in each year from 2004 to 2009; the Storm winning all <b>but</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> The move of Brisbane assistant coach Craig Bellamy to Melbourne has also been attributed to fueling the rivalry, as well as the wide spread of Queensland Origin players across their squads in {{the better part of the}} past decade.|$|E
5|$|Over the 1956/57 new year, McCool {{was one of}} a {{party of}} 12 cricketers, all <b>but</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> Test players, who made a brief trip to India to play two {{first-class}} matches in celebration of the silver jubilee of the Bengal Cricket Association in a side raised by the Lancashire secretary Geoffrey Howard. McCool did not play in the first match and in the second, he replaced Jock Livingston, the team's only wicketkeeper, who had been taken ill during the first game. McCool made only 23 and 1 with the bat, but he stumped Vinoo Mankad off the bowling of Dooland, one of only two stumpings in his career as a very occasional wicketkeeper.|$|E
5|$|In a later period, the two central {{cells of}} the rear wall have been {{combined}} by breaking the partition in between to house the Ganesha image. The old entrance was also widened during the conversion to the Ganesha temple. There are two other smaller entrances to the hall. All entrances bear marks of sockets for fixing wooden doors, added during the conversion, and still have doors. The hall also has traces of plaster and paintings, both added during the conversion and renewed in later times - possibly {{as late as the}} 19th century. The Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency (1882) records that the hall was plastered and white-washed. The paintings depicted Ganesha's childhood, marriage preparations, battle with demons and so forth, along with scenes of other Hindu deities like Devi, Krishna, Vishnu and Shiva. Some of the cells fitted with wooden doors were used for storage. Nine Sati memorials were added on the left wall during the conversion, each is {{in the shape of a}} long pillar with an arched top, and to the right of each pillar a hand raised above the elbow, with an open palm, signifies Sati's blessing. While three panels were plain, the other memorials were sculpted. All of them are worn out, <b>but</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> hints that its subject may be the immolation of Sati on her husband's funeral pyre.|$|E

25|$|The United Principalities era saw Pogor's {{activity}} blending {{into the}} cultural projects of Junimea literary society. Founded in stages ca. 1863, that club was originally focused on literary debates and popular education. Its founders were five young graduates, all <b>but</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> boyars. Pogor and Theodor Rosetti were French-trained; Petre P. Carp and Iacob Negruzzi (Costache's son) had {{studied in the}} German Confederation. The fifth was Titu Maiorescu, an upper-middle-class intellectual trained in both French and German schools, generally seen as the leading voice of Junimism, the cultural and political concept.|$|E
25|$|Paroxetine is a {{constrained}} structural analogue of fluoxetine {{where the}} linear phenylpropylamine group of fluoxetine has been folded into a piperidine ring (figure 5). The compound has {{the possibility of}} four stereoisomers because it contains two chiral centers, <b>but</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> the (3S,4R)-isomer, is marketed as paroxetine. Research has shown that stereochemical factors affect affinity of the molecule for SERT where substitution into the 2-ortho-position of either aromatic rings decreases affinity for rat SERT {{by as much as}} 10–100 times, where the greatest loss occurs in the phenoxy ring.|$|E

He rejected Beleg's advice to return to Doriath, and the Elf then departed to Menegroth. Later Túrin's band captured Mîm the Petty-dwarf; his two sons escaped, <b>but</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> Khîm, was mortally wounded by an outlaw Andróg. In order to save his own life, Mîm was forced to share his dwellings upon the hill of Amon Rûdh with the band.|$|E

25|$|On 2 May 1945, the {{squadron}} escorted the aircraft that returned Queen Wilhelmina to The Netherlands {{after three years}} in exile. This was No. 453 Squadron's last mission of the war; it moved between several bases in Britain in the months immediately {{following the end of}} hostilities before deploying to Germany in September. After the war it was planned that {{the squadron}} would form a long-term Australian presence among the occupation forces but sufficient volunteers could not be found to make this a viable proposition. Thus, on 21 January 1946 the squadron disbanded. During the war the squadron suffered 29 fatalities, all <b>but</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> Australian.|$|E
25|$|This {{method of}} diving is {{commonly}} used in Philippines waters for pa-aling fishing, which is fishing with big nets on coral reef areas where a surface-dragged net would snag on coral; the compressor air hoses are also {{used to make a}} curtain of bubbles to corral and herd the fish into the nets, since muro-ami fishing was stopped in the area. At least one pa-aling fishing fleet has been found and arrested in a protected fishery area. Compressor diving was shown, and so called, used for pa-aling fishing, in episode 1 (Oceans: Into the Blue) of the BBC television series Human Planet. The cameramen used ordinary scuba gear, <b>but</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> had a trial-dive with the crew's compressor-diving gear.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the need}} to clear both the large number of naval mines which had been laid around Tarakan and the {{extensive}} beach obstacles at Lingkas, the Allies did not attempt a surprise landing. A group of United States Navy minesweepers and destroyers arrived off Tarakan on 27 April and began clearing mines, most of which had been originally laid by Allied aircraft. This operation was completed by 1 May at a cost of two small minesweepers damaged. USN PT boats also arrived off Tarakan on 28 April and illuminated and strafed the invasion beaches at night to prevent the Japanese from repairing their beach defences. The PT boats also attacked seven small Japanese freighters and luggers which were found anchored at Lingkas, sinking or damaging all <b>but</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
