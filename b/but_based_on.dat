5|$|The D-7 {{was another}} ground attack {{aircraft}} based on D-1 airframes upgraded to D-5 standard (armour, wing cannons, extended wing panels), while the D-8 {{was similar to}} the D-7 <b>but</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> D-3 airframes. The D-7 and D-8 were both were fitted with flame dampers, and could conduct night operations.|$|E
5|$|Billiard balls {{have been}} made from many {{different}} materials {{throughout the history of}} the game, including clay, wood, ivory, plastics (including celluloid, Bakelite, crystalate, and phenolic resin, polyester and acrylic) and even steel. The dominant material from 1627 until the early- to mid-20th century was ivory. The search for a substitute for ivory use was not for environmental concerns <b>but</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> economic motivation and fear of danger for elephant hunters. It was in part spurred on by a New York billiard table manufacturer who announced a prize of $10,000 for a substitute material. The first viable substitute was celluloid billiard balls, invented by John Wesley Hyatt in 1868, but the material was volatile and highly inflammable, sometimes exploding during manufacture.|$|E

5|$|The Platanistidae were {{originally}} thought to hold only one species (the South Asian river dolphin), <b>but</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> differences in skull structure, vertebrae and lipid composition, scientists declared the two populations as separate {{species in the}} early 1970s. In 1998, {{the results of these}} studies were questioned and the classification reverted to the pre-1970 consensus. Thus, at present, two subspecies are recognized in the genus Platanista, P. gangetica minor (the Indus river dolphin) and P. g. gangetica (the Ganges river dolphin).|$|E
5|$|The {{relative}} ages of {{the different}} surface units on Callisto can be determined from the density of impact craters on them. The older the surface, the denser the crater population. Absolute dating has not been carried out, <b>but</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> theoretical considerations, the cratered plains {{are thought to be}} ~4.5billion years old, dating back almost to the formation of the Solar System. The ages of multi-ring structures and impact craters depend on chosen background cratering rates and are estimated by different authors to vary between 1 and 4billion years.|$|E
5|$|Another {{reason for}} DNA testing was to {{determine}} the rates of hybridization between pallid and shovelnose sturgeon. The southern populations have more hybrids than are found in the middle sections of the Missouri River basin, while the northernmost populations have had few reports of hybrids. Hybrids are most common in the Atchafalaya River in Louisiana, and DNA sequencing in these hybrids showed a genetic distinction from pallid sturgeon, <b>but</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> the genetic markers assessed, they were genetically indistinguishable from shovelnose sturgeon. Because of this ability of two species to hybridize, some biologists have expressed concern that it is a violation of the Endangered Species Act to protect one species that may not be genetically isolated from another. It is not known if the hybrids are able to reproduce or not, although they appear {{to be the result of}} pallid sturgeon eggs being fertilized by shovelnose sturgeon males.|$|E

5|$|Eshiro {{said that}} they could have set the game in a {{courtroom}} {{similar to that of the}} main series and made a few additions, but that it would not have been very interesting; instead they moved the game to crime scenes, and added several new gameplay elements. Yamazaki was the one who came up with the idea of making a game about deductive reasoning and crime scene investigation. Because of this theme, it made sense to them to include the Ace Attorney character Ema Skye in the game, as she is portrayed as wanting to be a forensic scientist. Yamazaki originally suggested that Ema should be the main character, <b>but</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> fan feedback, they decided to use the more popular character Miles Edgeworth instead. Figuring out how to move the game from the courtroom to the crime scene was a challenge for the development team. The team also thought that it was difficult to make the game feel new while also making sure it felt similar to the game series. Because of the new gameplay systems that all had to be created from scratch, Ace Attorney Investigations took longer to develop than previous Ace Attorney games had.|$|E
5|$|French {{casualties}} in the engagement are uncertain due to the circumstances of Confiantes destruction, <b>but</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> Acklom's report from the boarding party they {{were believed to be}} heavy. British losses were negligible, with not one man killed or seriously wounded and only minor damage inflicted on Hydra and none on the smaller vessels. The conduct of Lieutenant Lecolier was the subject of much criticism in France after the battle; in the French history Victories et Conquêtes, Lecolier was accused of failing to support Pevrieux and grounding his ship while the outcome of the battle was still undecided. British historian William James is less critical of Lecolier, focusing much of the blame for the French defeat on the more senior Pevrieux. The restriction of French movement along their own coastline had serious effects {{for the development of the}} French forces in the region and played a significant role in the failure of the French to pose a realistic invasion threat to Britain.|$|E
5|$|In September 1919, Quisling {{departed}} Norway {{to become}} an intelligence officer with the Norwegian delegation in Helsinki, a post that combined diplomacy and politics. In the autumn of 1921, Quisling left Norway once again, this time {{at the request of}} explorer and humanitarian Fridtjof Nansen, and in January 1922 arrived in the Ukrainian capital Kharkov to help with the League of Nations humanitarian relief effort there. Highlighting the massive mismanagement of the area and the death toll of approximately ten thousand a day, Quisling produced a report that attracted aid and demonstrated his administrative skills, as well as his dogged determination to get what he wanted. On 21August, he married the Russian Alexandra Andreevna ("Asja") Voronina, the daughter of a peddler. Alexandra wrote in her memoirs that Quisling declared his love for her, <b>but</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> his letters home and investigations undertaken by his cousins, it appears that there was never any question of romantic involvement between the two. Quisling merely seemed to have wanted to lift the girl out of poverty by providing her with a Norwegian passport and financial security.|$|E

5|$|Meat ants {{are among}} the very few native species of Australia that are not harmed by the toxins of the cane toad, an {{invasive}} species. Most of the time, foraging workers target metamorph toads. Observations show that workers would forage around ponds and seize any toadlet. This normally starts with a single worker making contact with an individual and tracing its movements, followed by three or four workers capturing it. All the participating ants would grab a limb and sever the legs, returning the prey item back to their nest. Most of the time these tactics do not work. For example, most toadlets are able to escape the ants by displaying aversion-like behaviour; an individual may escape by struggling erratically or forcing the ants to release their grip by returning to the water. This aversion behaviour leads to most toadlets remaining in the water or staying on objects such as water lilies, pieces of bark that the ants cannot access, or moving around on moist substrates. It is unknown if meat ant predation on the toadlets affected the population, <b>but</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> the population density of the toadlets within the studied site and the foraging time and efficiency, approximately 2,700 toadlets could be removed per day. As the toadlet population density is extremely high, the impact of meat ant predation is minor. However, the survivability of the toadlets may be affected if the ants prevent the toadlets from foraging into many areas of moist substrate.|$|E
5|$|Most colonies are monogyne, {{meaning that}} a colony {{only has a}} single queen, <b>but</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> observations, some nests contain {{more than a single}} queen. Some nests are known to contain two queens, with some even having as many as four in a single colony, making them polygynous; a high {{proportion}} of queens living in polygynous nests are unrelated to one another. Some colonies are oligogynous, which means that multiple queens are present in a colony, but they are tolerated by all workers birthed from different queens and treated equally. Tolerance still occurs even when new reproductive females and males are born, but recognition based on kin from queens and workers is known, hinting brood discrimination when the larvae are fed or groomed; queens will only take care of their own brood and neglect to look after broods laid by other queens. The queens, on the other hand, will only cooperate with each other during nest founding, but will be antagonistic once there are workers present in the colony. Queens become more intolerant of each other as the colony grows, and eventually separate within the nest, resulting in the queen laying more eggs. Such cases usually happen when pleometrotic founding occurs, or if a queen ant is adopted by a colony, setting up aggressive relationships. Physical fights between queens in the same colony are rare.|$|E
5|$|On October10, Hazel slowed in {{the central}} Caribbean and turned sharply to the {{north-northeast}} toward Hispaniola, steered by an upper-level low. At 09:00UTC on October12, the hurricane made landfall near Chardonnières along the Tiburon Peninsula of Haiti as a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale. There were no strong wind readings at landfall, <b>but</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> previous radar and aircraft observations the sustained winds were officially estimated at 120mph (195km/h). After moving through the Gulf of Gonâve, Hazel struck northwestern Haiti near Baie-de-Henne at 00:00UTC on October13, as a Category 2 hurricane with winds estimated at 100mph (160km/h). Around that time, the hurricane curved more {{to the north and}} northwest due to an approaching trough, and the Hurricane Hunters resumed entering the center of Hazel, reporting an eye and hurricane force winds. At 14:00UTC on October13, Hazel struck Inagua in the Bahamas with winds of 100mph (160km/h).|$|E

5|$|The {{writing of}} Wheelwright's Brief and Plain Apology may have {{commenced}} {{as early as}} 1644 when Short Story was published, <b>but</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> datable events the last part was written after his vindication by the Massachusetts court in 1654. In {{the first half of}} this work, Wheelwright refers to the author of Short Story as a singular person, clearly thinking that Thomas Weld had written the entire piece. Later in his Apology, however, Wheelwright refers to the authors (plural) of Short Story, realizing that Weld was not alone in writing the material. Though Wheelwright mentions no author of Short Story by name other than Thomas Weld, he certainly had come to realize that the other author was John Winthrop, since the 1648 books by both Cotton and Rutherford mentioned this fact as an aside. Winthrop had died in 1649 with a reputation as an effective colonial leader, respected in both England and the colonies, and there was no rational reason for Wheelwright to impugn his good name.|$|E
