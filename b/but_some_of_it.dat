This unit {{is very similar to}} intercrater plains material, and cannot be distinguished from it anywhere else in the Victoria quadrangle. Most of the cratered plains material is probably volcanic in origin, <b>but</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> may consist of impact breccias.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{cancellation}} of the inter-island ferries, and at the instigation of the Harbour Board, the District Engineer requested authorisation from the Chief Civil Engineer {{for the removal of}} the redundant veranda on 30 September 1976 and was granted such permission on 26 October. On 17 May 1979 it was reported that part of the veranda had been removed <b>but</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> remained as the area beneath it was being used as a car park. It was suggested that the remainder of the veranda be offered for sale to the Harbour Board or removed by the Department. The Harbour Board agreed to purchase the veranda and informed the Department of its intention to eventually demolish it as part of wharf reconstruction works. The Department later agreed on 14 August to transfer responsibility for the veranda to the Harbour Board at no cost.|$|E

2500|$|In {{as little}} as 15 minutes, glucose can stimulate GCK {{transcription}} and [...] glucokinase synthesis by way of insulin. Insulin is produced by the beta cells, <b>but</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> acts on beta cell B-type insulin receptors, providing an autocrine positive-feedback amplification of glucokinase activity. Further amplification occurs by insulin action (via A-type receptors) to stimulate its own transcription.|$|E
2500|$|The {{effectiveness}} of Barbour's tort reform efforts has been questioned. According to conservative journalist Timothy Carney, he [...] "touts job growth down in Mississippi under his governing, {{and some of}} that is due to tort reform, <b>but</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> is due to rank favoritism and special-interest deals more akin to Obama than Reagan — for instance, subsidies for a biofuels plant." ...|$|E

2500|$|Antibiotic {{resistance}} {{is a growing}} problem. Some of {{this is due to}} overuse of antibiotics in humans, <b>but</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> is probably due to the use of antibiotics as growth promoters in animal feeds. A study published in the journal Science in August 2007 found the rate of adaptative mutations in E. coli is [...] "on the order of 10−5 per genome per generation, which is 1,000 times as high as previous estimates," [...] a finding which may have significance for the study and management of bacterial antibiotic resistance.|$|E

2500|$|When a {{neurotransmitter}} {{is released}} at a synapse, it reaches its highest concentration inside the narrow {{space of the}} synaptic cleft, <b>but</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> is certain to diffuse away before being reabsorbed or broken down. [...] If it diffuses away, {{it has the potential}} to activate receptors that are located either at other synapses or on the membrane away from any synapse. [...] The extrasynaptic activity of a neurotransmitter is known as volume transmission. [...] It is well established that such effects occur to some degree, but their functional importance has long been a matter of controversy.|$|E

2500|$|Manna is from Heaven, {{according}} to the Hebrew Bible [...] and to Jesus in the New Testament, but the various identifications of manna are naturalistic. In the Mishnah, manna is treated as a natural but unique substance, [...] "created during the twilight of the sixth day of Creation", and ensured to be clean, before it arrives, by the sweeping of the ground by a northern wind and subsequent rains. According to classical rabbinical literature, manna was ground in a heavenly mill {{for the use of}} the righteous, <b>but</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> was allocated to the wicked and left for them to grind themselves.|$|E
2500|$|The Marrow of a Bone is, {{like most}} other Dir En Grey albums, self-produced. Work began on the album as early as 2005, while the {{majority}} of songs were written while touring throughout 2006 between shows in Japan, Europe, and America during the Family Values Tour. The band members noted that touring in the United States on a major festival tour influenced and inspired them in the production process, and several songs, including [...] "Lie Buried with a Vengeance", [...] "Agitated Screams of Maggots", and [...] "The Pledge". Guitarist Kaoru has said about the production process, [...] "...some of it went really well, <b>but</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> went really badly." [...] The entirety of the album's final recording was completed following their 2006 tour in December, with only the month of January to finalize production to meet the February release date. Even though the formal process was rapid, it has been described as their cleanest production and heaviest album to date. The production on the supporting singles and the album showed a noted difference, with two of the singles, [...] "Ryōjoku no Ame" [...] and [...] "Clever Sleazoid", being rerecorded entirely for the album, as Dir En Grey hired a new sound engineer. [...] "Ryōjoku no Ame" [...] received a strong change instrumentally, as well as removing the falsetto vocals.|$|E
