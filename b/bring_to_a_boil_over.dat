40|$|Written {{on the eve}} of the 2004 American presidential election, this {{political}} narrative offers a critical reading of two models of democracy: Instant-Mix imperial democracy (<b>bring</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>boil,</b> add oil, then bomb), criticized by Arundhati Roy, and Garrison Keillor’s Homegrown Democrat. Keillor’s pastoral view of democracy is anchored in LakeWobegon, his imaginary utopian community. His homegrown democracy is narrow, provincial, and White.

5000|$|There {{are several}} {{theories}} {{as to the}} proper technique of hard-boiling an egg. One method is <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> water <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>boil</b> and cook for ten minutes. [...] Another method is <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> the water <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>boil,</b> but then remove the pan {{from the heat and}} allow eggs to cook in the gradually cooling water. Over-cooking eggs will typically result in a thin green iron(II) sulfide coating on the yolk. This reaction occurs more rapidly in older eggs as the whites are more alkaline.Immersing the egg in cold water after <b>boiling</b> is <b>a</b> common method of halting the cooking process to prevent this effect. It also causes a slight shrinking of the contents of the egg.|$|R
50|$|A {{familiar}} everyday {{example is}} <b>bringing</b> water <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>boil</b> in the shortest time, which {{is achieved by}} applying full heat, then turning it off when the water reaches <b>a</b> <b>boil.</b> <b>A</b> closed-loop household example is most thermostats, wherein the heating element or air conditioning compressor is either running or not, depending upon whether the measured temperature is above or below the setpoint.|$|R
50|$|The {{reaction}} is highly exothermic, and may <b>bring</b> the solution <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>boil.</b> Upon crystallization, the resulting microcrystals should be white, though a blue tinge is common, indicating {{the presence of}} a Cu2+ species.|$|R
50|$|Simmering is a food {{preparation}} technique in which foods are cooked in hot liquids kept {{just below the}} boiling point of water (which is 100 °C or 212 °F at average sea level air pressure), but higher than poaching temperature. <b>To</b> keep <b>a</b> pot simmering, one <b>brings</b> it <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>boil</b> and then reduces the heat <b>to</b> <b>a</b> point where the formation of bubbles has almost ceased, typically a water temperature of about 94 °C (200 °F) at sea level.|$|R
50|$|In Tuscany, the mezzadria peasants were {{involved}} in wine production, {{but most of the}} wine produced went <b>to</b> the landlord. <b>As</b> they were left with little to drink, they would make a kind of wine by mixing the stems, seeds, and pomace left over from the wine production with large quantities of water, <b>bringing</b> it <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>boil,</b> hermetically sealing it in a terracotta vase, and letting it ferment for several days. This resulted in a slightly effervescent drink, which was consumed as it was.|$|R

5000|$|Harry (Danny Glover), {{an enigmatic}} old {{friend from the}} South, comes to visit Gideon (Paul Butler) and his wife Suzie (Mary Alice), who haven't seen him for many years, who are delighted to see him again, and who insist that he stay with them {{for as long as}} he would like. Gideon and Suzie live in South Central Los Angeles, though they retain some of their rural {{southern}} ways, including raising chickens in the backyard. Harry has a charming, down-home manner, but his presence <b>brings</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> crisis the simmering trouble that is already in the family—especially as regards the younger son, Samuel or [...] "Baby Brother" [...] (Richard Brooks), and his relation to his parents, wife, and older brother, Junior (Carl Lumbly). His disruptive presence is dangerous (his influence threatens to break up Samuel's marriage and seems to be related to the illness that puts Gideon in bed in serious condition for a couple weeks), but ultimately purgative: Gideon's extended family is much more cohesive as a result of Harry's visit. The storm accompanying the wound Suzie suffers when she grasps the knife that Samuel and Junior are struggling over during their climactic fight clears while the two brothers quietly reconcile (during a long wait in an emergency room) and, similarly, the simmering anger that Harry seemed <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>boil</b> is also dissipated. Harry's death just before the end of the film suggests, ambiguously, that he has been <b>to</b> <b>a</b> degree a self-sacrificing savior of the family.|$|R

5000|$|Akpeteshie is {{distilled}} from {{palm wine}} or sugarcane juice. This sweetened liquid or wine is first fermented {{in a large}} barrels, sometimes {{with the help of}} yeast.

The boiled juice then undergoes a second stage of fermentation. [...] The resulting spirit is between 40 and 50% alcohol by volume.|$|R
5000|$|Their {{construction}} {{technique is}} known as SST or [...] "Superior Shell Technology." [...] All Pearl drums feature this construction. Each ply is placed into a cylinder, and pressure is applied from both sides. While in the press, the shell is heated <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> the glue <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>boil,</b> thus forcing it through the wood grain and fusing the shells very tightly. The individual plies are scarf jointed, and all the seams are offset, resulting in a [...] "seamless" [...] drum (Pearl demonstrates the strength by parking a Humvee with its tire on a tom shell). This creates a drum shell of incredible strength.|$|R

50|$|First, cut a {{piece of}} old ginger into small pieces and grind the ginger to fine. Then, squeeze the juice out by {{pressing}} the ginger through a sieve. Put the juice into a bowl. Next, <b>bring</b> the milk <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>boil</b> and dissolve sugar in milk. Take off heat and allow it <b>to</b> cool <b>a</b> little. If you have a kitchen thermometer, place your kitchen thermometer into the milk. The optimum curdling temperature is 70 C. In the mean time, stir the ginger juice thoroughly. When milk temperature decreases to around 75-70°C, pour the milk quickly {{into the middle of}} the ginger juice. Wait for two to three minutes. The milk will then be curdled, and may be eaten with a spoon.|$|R
50|$|If a {{large part}} of the cooking time is spent at {{temperatures}} lower than 60 °C (as when the contents of the cooker are slowly cooling over a long period), a danger of food poisoning due to bacterial infection, or toxins produced by multiplying bacteria, arises. It is essential to heat food sufficiently at the outset of vacuum cooking; 60 °C throughout the dish for 10 minutes is sufficient to kill most pathogens of interest, effectively pasteurizing the dish. Some foods, such as kidney beans, fava beans, and many other varieties of beans contain a toxin, phytohaemagglutinin, that requires boiling at 100 °C for at least 10 minutes to break down to safe levels. The best practice is <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> briefly <b>to</b> <b>a</b> rolling <b>boil</b> then put the pot in the flask. This keeps it hottest longest. With big chunks of food, <b>boil</b> <b>a</b> little longer before putting into the flask.|$|R
50|$|As {{the name}} suggests, the pastry {{is made by}} heating water, melting the fat in it, <b>bringing</b> the mixture <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>boil,</b> and finally {{incorporating}} the flour. This {{can be done by}} beating the flour into the mixture in the pan, or by kneading on a pastry board. Either way, the result is a hot and rather sticky paste {{that can be used for}} hand-raising: shaping by hand, sometimes using a dish or bowl as an inner mould. The molded crust retains its shape as it cools, and is prepared for baking with a filling and additional layer of pastry crust on top. Hand-raised hot water crust pastry does not produce a neat and uniform finish, as there will be sagging during the cooking of the filled pie. This is generally accepted as the mark of a hand-made pie. It is possible, however, to bake the pastry in a mould, as with other pies.|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} are {{to demonstrate the}} change in mechanical properties of a thermoplastic polymer when the polymer is heated above the glass transition temperature. The instructor or student can perform this demonstration. In preparation for the demonstration, fill the flask or beaker 3 / 4 full with water and <b>bring</b> the water <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>boil.</b> First observe the initial stiffness of the toothbrush by slightly flexing it. Note that it is fairly stiff and retains its initial shape when the forces are removed. If you were to apply enough force, the toothbrush would break in a somewhat brittle fashion. Now place the toothbrush in the boiling water for 2 minutes. After the 2 minutes are up, remove the toothbrush from the boiling water with the washcloth. At this time, {{you will be able}} to bend the toothbrush easily. When it cools it will retain this bent shape. You've just demonstrated heating the polymer above the glass transition temperature, demonstrating thermoplastic softening. Instructor notes are provided...|$|R
