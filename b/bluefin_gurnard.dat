5000|$|The <b>bluefin</b> <b>gurnard</b> or Pacific red gurnard, Chelidonichthys kumu, is {{a species}} of fish in the family Triglidae, the sea robins and gunards.

40|$|Fish {{vocalisation}} {{is often}} {{a major component of}} underwater soundscapes. Therefore, interpretation of these soundscapes requires an understanding of the vocalisation characteristics of common soniferous fish species. This study of captive female <b>bluefin</b> <b>gurnard,</b> Chelidonichthys kumu, aims to formally characterise their vocalisation sounds and daily pattern of sound production. Four types of sound were produced and characterised, twice as many as previously reported in this species. These sounds fit two aural categories; grunt and growl, the mean peak frequencies for which ranged between 129 to 215 Hz. This species vocalized throughout the 24 hour period at an average rate of (18. 5 ± 2. 0 sounds fish- 1 h- 1) with an increase in vocalization rate at dawn and dusk. Competitive feeding did not elevate vocalisation as has been found in other gurnard species. <b>Bluefin</b> <b>gurnard</b> are common in coastal waters of New Zealand, Australia and Japan and, given their vocalization rate, are likely to be significant contributors to ambient underwater soundscape in these areas...|$|E
