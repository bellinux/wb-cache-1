Cast members said that although the film was aimed at children, they considered it had important lessons for the parents as well.|$|E
40|$|The author {{explored}} {{the meaning of}} the <b>Black</b> <b>community</b> according to a purposeful sample of 60 Black adults in the mid-Atlantic United States. Purposeful stratified sampling resulted in equal numbers of participants along the lines of locale (Brooklyn, New York; Wilmington, Delaware; and Washington, D. C.), gender, and generational affiliation (older adults, middle-aged adults, and young adults). Content analysis of responses to a single open-ended survey question resulted in 11 emergent themes around {{the meaning of the}} Black community: the <b>Black</b> <b>community</b> as cultural, the <b>Black</b> <b>community</b> as residential, the <b>Black</b> <b>community</b> as global, the <b>Black</b> <b>community</b> as supportive, the <b>Black</b> <b>community</b> as visibly distinctive, the <b>Black</b> <b>community</b> as socioeconomic, the <b>Black</b> <b>community</b> as nonactualized, the <b>Black</b> <b>community</b> as nondifferential, the <b>Black</b> <b>community</b> as nihilistic, the <b>Black</b> <b>community</b> as nondefinable, and the <b>Black</b> <b>community</b> as other. Gender and generational variations in thematic endorsement were analyzed, and implications of these findings as they pertain to research, mental health programs, and policies for Blacks are discussed...|$|R

50|$|In Black American Sign Language (Black ASL), {{there is}} {{linguistic}} variation which helps define individuals {{as members of}} both the <b>Black</b> <b>community</b> and Deaf community. However, issues arise out of this double immersion in the two communities. Speakers, dependent on their language background, will identify themselves more strongly with either the ethnic or Deaf identity. The primary identity of <b>Black</b> Deaf <b>community</b> is the <b>Black</b> <b>community,</b> but those born deaf in deaf families identify with the Deaf community. It {{is important to note}} that the <b>Black</b> Deaf <b>community</b> is distinct from both the <b>black</b> and deaf <b>communities.</b> <b>Black</b> ASL as a sociolinguistic variant of ASL is distinctly Black. Speakers of Black ASL do code-switch to ASL when speaking with people outside the <b>Black</b> <b>community.</b> This sociolinguistic variation is what defines the <b>Black</b> Deaf <b>community.</b>|$|R
5|$|The British Empire {{had been}} in {{transition}} since the 1920s, and the pace accelerated {{in the wake of}} the Second World War. More and more member states demanded independence, and a series of crises erupted during the 1950s, including the 1952 Mau Mau Uprising in Kenya and the Suez Crisis of 1956. During the same period immigration into Britain from the Indian subcontinent and the Caribbean was on the increase, causing some resentment among elements of the native population. At the time Kneale was working on his scripts <b>black</b> <b>communities</b> in Nottingham and London came under attack from mobs of white Britons; Kneale became keen to develop the serial as an allegory for the emerging racial tensions that culminated in the Notting Hill race riots of August and September 1958.|$|E
5|$|Controversies {{regarding}} the siting of the Green Line continued. In May 1980, {{a group of}} business owners near the former proposed terminus at Branch Avenue and Auth Road near Marlow Heights sued Metro {{on the grounds that}} the decision to change the course of the Green Line was illegal because it had been undertaken without a public hearing (in violation of Metro's rules). In February 1981, Judge Norman Park Ramsey of the U.S. District for Maryland held that Metro did not correctly advertise the hearings at which the change would be discussed. Metro appealed the ruling, and Judge Ramsey did not enjoin Metro from proceeding with construction until the appeal was resolved. The Prince George's County government, however, reaffirmed in April 1981 its support for the Rosecroft Raceway terminus, and Metro promised to hold a public hearing on the issue in June 1981. Shortly thereafter, the civil rights office in the U.S. Department of Transportation sent a letter to Metro warning that the Rosecroft Raceway route could negatively impact two historically <b>black</b> <b>communities</b> nearby. In May 1981, Metro changed its estimate for the opening of the Green Line to Anacostia to early 1988.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to analyze usage of language, which may be {{perceived}} as “profane”, in the <b>Black</b> <b>community</b> today. This was done by surveying members of the <b>Black</b> <b>community</b> about usage of the term ‘shit’ and its meaning in hip hop lyrics. The information from this survey was analyzed and ‘shit’ was determined to be polysemous. The many meanings of the term were demonstrative of both positive and negative connotations in the contexts of the hip hop lyrics which were analyzed. These findings combined with other findings on language usage within the <b>Black</b> <b>community</b> suggests that semantic inversion of pejorative and profane language is a common trend in the oral tradition of the <b>Black</b> <b>community.</b> ...|$|R
