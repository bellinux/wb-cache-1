40|$|We {{developed}} an automated miniature constant-head tension infiltrometer that measures very small infiltration rates at millimetre resolution with minimal {{demands on the}} operator. The infiltrometer is made of 2. 9 mm internal radius glass tube, with an integrated <b>bubbling</b> <b>tower</b> to maintain constant negative head and a porous mesh tip to avoid air-entry. In the <b>bubbling</b> <b>tower,</b> <b>bubble</b> formation and release changes the electrical resistance between two electrodes at the air-inlet. Tests were conducted on repacked sieved sands, sandy loam soil and clay loam soil, packed to a soil bulk density ρd of 1200 kg m- 3 or 1400 kg m- 3 and tested either air-dried or at a water potential ψ of - 50 kPa. The change in water volume in the infiltrometer had a linear relationship {{with the number of}} bubbles, allowing bubble rate to be converted to infiltration rate. Sorptivity measured with the infiltrometer was similar between replicates and showed expected differences from soil texture and ρd, varying from 0. 15 ± 0. 01 (s. e.) mm s- 1 / 2 for 1400 kg m- 3 clay loam at ψ = - 50 kPa to 0. 65 ± 0. 06 mm s- 1 / 2 for 1200 kg m- 3 air dry sandy loam soil.

40|$|The tension {{infiltrometer}} is {{a device}} for measuring unsaturated hydraulic conductivity [KC'!') ] {{in the larger}} soil pores. By regulating the supply pressure head during infiltration {{with the help of}} a <b>bubble</b> <b>tower,</b> it is possible to control the size range of soil pores that transmit water. This technique was used in the characterization of infiltration in two rainfed hillsides (north and south exposure) of the central zone of Chile. The results showed smaller K(Ψ) values for the north exposure, with accentuated differences close to saturation (zero pressure head). These differences may have been attributed to differences in texture and organic matter contents observed for the two exposures. Furthermore, K(Ψ) presented a tendency to increase with increasing slope. This tendency, observed also in complementary laboratory works was to a part explained by the deviation from requirements of measurements on level ground. A way of adjusting for slope influence is proposed. In the field study, after adjustment, the differences in K(Ψ) were attributed to the differences in the vertical and lateral hydraulic conductivity and to the development of surface sealing occurring in low slope plots. Finally, a stepwise regression analysis showed that K(Ψ) parameters were explained by the slope of the hillside and the proportion of textural separates in the soil surface...|$|E
40|$|Flue gas {{desulphurization}} (FGD) {{materials are}} produced in abundant quantities by coal burning utilities. Due to environmental restrains, flue gases must be ''cleaned'' prior to release to the atmosphere. They are two general methods to ''scrub'' flue gas: wet and dry. The choice of scrubbing material is often {{defined by the}} type of coal being burned, i. e. its composition. Scrubbing is traditionally carried out using a slurry of calcium containing material (slaked lime or calcium carbonate) that is made to contact exiting flue gas as either a spay injected into the gas or in a <b>bubble</b> <b>tower.</b> The calcium combined with the SO{sub 2 } in the gas to form insoluble precipitates. Some plants have been using dry injection of these same materials or their own Class C fly ash to scrub. In either case the end product contains primarily hannebachite (CaSO{sub 3 } {center_dot} 1 / 2 H{sub 2 }O) with smaller amounts of gypsum (CaSO{sub 4 } {center_dot} 2 H{sub 2 }O). These materials have little commercial use. Experiments were carried out that were meant to explore the feasibility of using blends of hannebachite and fly ash mixed with concentrated sodium hydroxide to make masonry products. The results suggest that some of these mixtures could be used in place of conventional Portland cement based products such as retaining wall bricks and pavers...|$|E

40|$|An {{automated}} tension infiltrometer {{useful for}} a range of water tensions from 0. 02 to 0. 50 m and for infiltration rates of 1 x 10 [superscript]- 8 to 5 x 10 [superscript]- 4 m s[superscript]- 1 is described. Infiltration rates are calculated from the change in water height in a Mariotte column. Water height is automatically measured by using the difference in tension between two pressure transducers, one installed at the top, and the other at the bottom, of the Mariotte column. Using two transducers increased precision of water height measurement as compared to measurements made with only one transducer. This occurred because tension fluctuations or 2 ̆ 7 noise 2 ̆ 7 caused by bubbling in the Mariotte column is part of measurement error when only one transducer is used. The new design incorporates several features used or suggested by other workers, including a <b>bubble</b> <b>tower</b> for tension regulation and interchangeable Mariotte columns with different diameters. The latter enables users to match column volume with expected cumulative infiltration. Advantages of the new device include (i) quick and accurate tension control at low tensions, (ii) improved measurement precision at low flow rates, and (iii) automatic measurement and data collection, which increases measurement speed and eliminates bubbling-induced variability. The tension infiltrometer was used in the field to measure unconfined steady-state infiltration rates at three tensions (30 -, 60 -, and 150 -mm water tension) into no-till and chisel-plow tillage systems. Measurements were made on trafficked and untrafficked interrows for each system. The saturated unconfined infiltration rate was determined by using an infiltrometer designed for ponding water on the surface. The infiltrometers accurately measured steady-state infiltration rates from 2 to 300 [mu]m s[superscript]- 1. Increasing tension resulted in decreasing infiltration rates for both tillage and traffic treatments. Wheel traffic caused large decreases in infiltration rates for both tillage systems, especially at low tensions. This implies that compaction destroyed more large macropores than small ones. The tension infiltrometer was also used on restructured cores in the laboratory to unsaturated infiltration. The Philip and Swartzendruber infiltration equations were evaluated for their ability to estimate sorptivity and hydraulic conductivity. The Swartzendruber infiltration equation yielded estimates of unsaturated hydraulic conductivity similar to directly measured values of conductivity, while the Philip equation did not...|$|E

40|$|Hydrogen {{combustion}} {{may represent}} a threat to containment integrity in a VVER- 440 / 213 plant owing to the combination of high pressure and high temperature. A study {{has been carried out}} using the GASFLOW 2. 1 three-dimensional CFD code to evaluate the hydrogen distribution in the containment during a beyond design basis accident. The VVER- 440 / 213 containment input model consists of two 3 D blocks connected via one-dimensional (1 D) ducts. One 3 D block contains the reactor building and the accident localization tower with the suppression pools. Another 3 D block models the air traps. 1 D ducts represent the check valves connecting the accident localization tower with the air traps. The VVER pressure suppression system, called ''bubbler condenser,'' was modeled as a distributed heat sink with water thermodynamic properties. This model accounts for the energy balance. However, it is not currently possible to model dynamic phenomena associated with the water pools (e. g., vent clearing, level change). The GASFLOW 2. 1 calculation gave detailed results for the spatial distribution of thermal-hydraulic parameters and gas concentrations. The range and trend of the parameters are reasonable and valuable. There are particularly interesting circulation patterns around the steam generators, in the <b>bubbler</b> <b>tower</b> and other primary system compartments. In case of the <b>bubbler</b> <b>tower,</b> concentration and temperature contour plots show an inhomogeneous distribution along the height and width, changing during the accident. Hydrogen concentrations also vary within primary system compartments displaying lower as well as higher (up to 13 - 20 % and higher) values in some nodes. Prediction of such concentration distributions was not previously possible with lumped parameter codes. GASFLOW 2. 1 calculations were compared with CONTAIN 1. 2 (lumped parameter code) results. Apart from the qualitatively similar trends, there are, for the time being, quantitative differences between the results concerning, for example, pressure histories, or the total amount of steam available in the containment. The results confirm the importance of detailed modeling of the containment, {{as well as of the}} bubbler condenser and sump water pools. The study showed that modeling of hydrogen distribution in the VVER- 440 / 213 containment was possible using the GASFLOW 2. 1 code with reasonable results and remarkable physical insights...|$|R

40|$|Extraction and {{recovery}} of gold(I) with extremely low concentration in cyanide wastewater were conducted {{as an example}} aimed to develop a feasible method based upon the experimental kinetic data for calculating the required mass transfer height of a new bubbling organic liquid membrane extraction tower. The kinetic extraction equation based on curve lain fitting the experimental c(t) similar to t data from single column extraction could be established to describe the quantitative relationship of the concentration change of gold(I) in flowing-out aqueous solution from the tower with the reaction time in the tower, so that the required tower height involved in the axial gas mixing effect could be calculated from the residence time of the aqueous solution passing through the tower to achieve a target equilibrating concentration.

60|$|Clouds, {{it is to}} be remembered, are not so much local vapor, as vapor {{rendered}} locally visible by a fall of temperature. Thus a cloud, whose {{parts are}} in constant motion, will hover on a snowy mountain, pursuing constantly the same track upon its flanks, and yet remaining of the same size, the same form, and in the same place, for half a day together. No matter how violent or how capricious the wind may be, the instant it approaches the spot where the chilly influence of the snow extends, the moisture it carries becomes visible, and then and there the cloud forms on the instant, apparently maintaining its form against the wind, though the careful and keen eye can see all its parts in the most rapid motion across the mountain. The outlines of such a cloud are of course not determined by the irregular impulses of the wind, but by the fixed lines of radiant heat which regulate the temperature of the atmosphere of the mountain. It is terminated, therefore, not by changing curves, but by steady right lines of more or less decision, often exactly correspondent with the outline of the mountain on which it is formed, and falling therefore into grotesque peaks and precipices. I have seen the marked and angular outline of the Grandes Jorasses, at Chamounix, mimicked in its every jag by a line of clouds above it. Another resultant phenomenon is the formation of cloud in the calm air to leeward of a steep summit; cloud whose edges are in rapid motion, where they are affected by the current of the wind above, and stream from the peak like the smoke of a volcano, yet always vanish at a certain distance from it as steam issuing from a chimney. When wet weather of some duration is approaching, a small white spot of cloud will sometimes appear low on the hill flanks; it will not move, but will increase gradually for some little time, then diminish, still without moving; disappear altogether, reappear ten minutes afterwards, exactly in the same spot; increase {{to a greater extent than}} before, again disappear, again return, and at last permanently; other similar spots of cloud forming simultaneously, with various fluctuations, each in its own spot, and at the same level on the hill-side, until all expand, join together, and form an unbroken veil of threatening gray, which darkens gradually into storm. What in such cases takes place palpably and remarkably, is more or less a law of formation in all clouds whatsoever; they being bounded rather by lines expressive of changes of temperature in the atmosphere, than by the impulses of the currents of wind in which those changes take place. Even when in rapid and visible motion across the sky, the variations which take place in their outlines are not so much alterations of position and arrangement of parts, as they are the alternate formation and disappearance of parts. There is, therefore, usually a parallelism and consistency in their great outlines, which give system to the smaller curves of which they are composed; and if these great lines be taken, rejecting the minutiæ of variation, the resultant form will almost always be angular, and full of character and decision. In the flock-like fields of equal masses, each individual mass has the effect, not of an ellipse or circle, but of a rhomboid; the sky is crossed and checkered, not honeycombed; in the lower cumuli, even though the most rounded of all clouds, the groups are not like balloons or <b>bubbles,</b> but like <b>towers</b> or mountains. And the result of this arrangement in masses more or less angular, varied with, and chiefly constructed of, curves of the utmost freedom and beauty, is that appearance of exhaustless and fantastic energy which gives every cloud a marked character of its own, suggesting resemblances to the specific outlines of organic objects. I do not say that such accidental resemblances are a character to be imitated; but merely that they bear witness to the originality and vigor of separate conception in cloud forms, which give to the scenery of the sky a force and variety no less delightful than that of the changes of mountain outline in a hill district of great elevation; and that there is added to this a spirit-like feeling, a capricious, mocking imagery of passion and life, totally different from any effects of inanimate form that the earth can show.|$|R
