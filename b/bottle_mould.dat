40|$|AbstractThe use of {{plastics}} for packaging {{has been increasing}} steadily over the years. Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) dominates the carbonated soft drinks (CSDs) market as the main material used in this application due to its toughness, clarity and superior barrier properties. Currently, the CSD bottles constitute 40 % of the global PET consumption. PET bottles demonstrate favourable life cycle inventories compared to alternative packaging materials such as aluminium and glass. Manufacturing of the bottles starts with the production of PET resin from petrochemicals. The PET resin is then melted and injected into a preform mould which has {{the shape of a}} test tube with a threaded neck. Subsequently, the preform is heated to a certain temperature, and stretched and blown simultaneously to take up the shape of the <b>bottle</b> <b>mould.</b> Each of these steps requires energy. In this study, we will focus on the environmental footprint of CSD bottles and demonstrate that light-weighting of CSD bottles through a new bottle/preform design brings about energy reduction and greenhouse gas savings...|$|E
40|$|<b>Bottle</b> <b>mould</b> making {{technology}} {{has become one}} of the most important industries nowadays. However, the bottle necks mould making process is given less attention and special tooling is needed in order to shape the mould. Bottle neck tool making process involves features consideration of its complex geometry. This project is aim to design and manufacture the bottle neck tool. This tool will be use to form a shape the workpiece to become bottle neck mould. For that, the tool design was done using Solidworks and Cimatron. The FEA method was used in electrostatic current and voltage analysis on the tool. Finally, the DFM Concurrent Costing was applied to estimate the machining cost before it proceeds into the machining stages. The results show that after FEA analysis, the values of the electrical current magnitude were stated as 1 936. 07 A/m 2 (highest) and 11. 1 649 A/m 2 (lowest) respectively. Meanwhile, the estimated machining cost generated from DFM software was RM 867. 19. A prototype of the neck finish electrode was fabricated at the end of this project. As a conclusion, the electrode design, analysis and fabrication have achieved by using tools such as Solidworks, Cimairon, ALGOR, DFM Concurrent Costing and MasterCAM...|$|E
40|$|Injection stretch {{blow moulded}} PET bottles {{are the most}} widely used {{container}} type for carbonated soft drinks. PET offers excellent clarity, good mechanical and barrier properties, and ease of processing. Typically, these bottles have a petaloid-shaped base, which gives good stability to the bottle and it is the most appropriate one for beverage storage. However, the base is prone to environmentally induced stress cracking and this a major concern to bottle manufacturers. The object {{of this study is to}} explain the occurrence of stress cracking, and to prevent it by optimising both the geometry of the petaloid base and the processing parameters during bottle moulding. A finite element model of the petaloid shape is developed in CATIA V 5 R 14, and used to predict the von Mises stress in the bottle base for different combinations of three key dimensions of the base: foot length, valley width, and clearance. The combination of dimensions giving the minimum stress is found by a statistical analysis approach using an optimisation and design of experiments software package ECHIP- 7. A <b>bottle</b> <b>mould</b> was manufactured according to the optimum base geometry and PET bottles are produced by injection stretch blow moulding (ISBM). In order to minimise the stresses at the bottom of the bottle, the ISBM process parameters were reviewed and the effects of both the stretch rod movement and the temperature profile of the preform were studied by means of the process simulation software package (Blow View version 8. 2). Simulated values of the wall thickness, stress, crystallinity, molecular orientation and biaxial ratio in the bottle base were obtained. The process parameters, which result in low stress and uniform material in the bottle base, are regarded as optimum operating conditions. In the evaluation process of the optimum bottle base, bottles with standard (current) and optimized (new) base were produced under the same process conditions via a two-stage ISBM machine. In order to compare both the bottles, environmental stress crack resistance, top load strength, burst pressure strength, thermal stability test as well as crystallinity studies ¬¬¬via modulated differential scanning calorimetry (MDSC) and morphology studies via environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) and optical microscopy were conducted. In this study carried out, the new PET bottle with the optimised base significantly decreased the environmental stress cracking occurrence in the bottom of the bottle. It is found that the bottle with optimised base is stronger than the bottle with standard base against environmental stress cracking. The resistance time against environmental stress cracking are increased by about % 90 under the same operating process conditions used for standard (current) bottles; and by % 170 under the optimised process conditions where the preform re-heating temperature is set to 105 oC...|$|E
5000|$|As Three Legs Cooling Water became {{increasingly}} {{popular in the}} 1980s, other competitors began putting out imitations and forgeries of the product {{on the market in}} a bid to capitalise on its sales.

50|$|MarkingsModern <b>bottles,</b> when <b>moulded,</b> will {{be given}} marks on the heel (bottom) of the bottle. These marks serve a variety of purposes, such as {{identifying}} the machine used {{in the production of}} the bottle (for quality control purposes), showing the manufacturer of the bottle, how much to fill the bottle to, the date the bottle was manufactured, as well as other information. Embossing on a bottle consists of raised lettering, numbers, and/or designs which were intended to inform the purchaser in some way of the contents or to establish ownership of the bottle.ClosuresGlass bottles have a variety of closures to seal up the bottle and prevent the contents escape. Early bottles were sealed with wax, and later stoppered with a cork. More common today are screw caps and stoppers.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an investigation on injection stretch blow moulding (ISBM) of PET bottles which are heated using microwave (MW) ovens instead of infrared lamps. Comparative simulation studies {{are carried out}} on structural strength of PET bottles obtained from three performs heated with different power outputs of microwave along with a preform heated conventionally under different process conditions. The comparisons between microwave and infrared heating were carried out to study the structural strength of the bottle under top loading and pressure conditions using ANSYS simulation software.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the influence of processing parameters on the quality of the pinch-off welding of an ethylene-vinyl alcohol/polypropylene (EVOH/PP) six-layer bottle for tomato ketchup, evaluated in terms of its structure and properties imparted to the corresponding bottles. The pinch-off welding process was studied on coextruded blow <b>moulded</b> <b>bottles</b> by varying the mould temperature, the mould closing speed and the hold time according to a L 9 -Taguchi experiment design. It was observed that the mould closing speed is the more influential parameter, determining the layered structure at the pinch-off and the mechanical performance of the bottle. Better properties were obtained when the mould closing speed was set to the highest value allowed by the blow moulding equipment...|$|R
40|$|The APULOT test, or bottle test, is a {{cheap and}} simple {{alternative}} to cylindrical specimens {{that can be}} applied in those regions where conventional quality control is difficult to introduce {{due to the lack of}} apropriate means. Specimens for this test are produced by casting concrete into an empty plastic <b>bottle</b> (the <b>mould)</b> with a reinforcing bar longitudinally centered, so that the result is a bottle-shaped concrete specimen with an embedded rebar. At the desired age, the rebar is simply pulled out of the concrete specimen, and the maximum pulling force achieved is the parameter used for quality control. A considerable number of bottle specimens and cylindrical specimens have been produced and tested according to a statistically designed experiment. It has been investigated how different parameters affect the bottle test results and their relation to compressive strength of concrete in order to compare the reliability of the bottle test with the conventional assessment of compressive strength by means of cylindrical specimens for quality control. All results have been analyzed by means of analysis of variance, multiple linear regression and logistic regression. These analyses have made possible: the identification of the best configuration of the parameters considered to be taken into account for an eventual standardization of the test, and finding expressions showing how the test results are to be translated in terms of concrete compressive strength...|$|R
40|$|In this work, a new Computer Aided Engineering {{method was}} {{developed}} to predict optimal design and process conditions for stretch blow <b>moulded</b> <b>bottles,</b> minimizing the cost associated with {{the design of a}} new container. The proposed approach evaluates final product characteristics by process numerical simulations in a user friendly environment. The implemented algorithm seeks for the optimal conditions in terms of preform geometry and operating parameters, subjected to process and design constraints. Special attention was devoted to material characterization, obtained by simple and inexpensive instruments, and to the material model implementation, in order to improve results accuracy. For the process simulations commercial general purpose numerical codes were used. With reference to an industrial case study, the predicted optimization results were compared to the experimental outcomes to assess the validity and the robustness of the proposed approach...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an experimental research dealing with bond strength as a parameter for concrete quality control. To this end, a low-cost testing technique has been developed: the Bottle Bond Test (BBT). Specimens for the BBT are produced by casting concrete into empty plastic <b>bottles</b> (used as <b>moulds)</b> with a reinforcing bar longitudinally centred. The result is a bottle-shaped concrete specimen with an embedded rebar, which is pulled out to determine bond strength. Different parameters related to this test setup modify bond strength: their effect has been analyzed. An equation to relate the obtained bond strength values to concrete compressive strength is presented. This equation has been validated with real production data from a readymix concrete plant. Its accuracy and therefore the feasibility of BBT for concrete quality control have been verified. Therefore, the BBT can be an alternative to conventional concrete quality based on uniaxial compression tests...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the research of}} packaging beer into plastic bottles and the design and manufacture of a low pressure <b>bottle</b> blow <b>moulding</b> machine for demonstration purposes. The machine {{will be used for}} the production of plastic bottles suitable for bottling brewed beer at the microbrewery at Massey University Palmerston North. Premanufactured PET preforms have proven to be the most convenient and promising choice for the fabrication of blown bottles. Basic tests to understand the behaviour of the preforms and the challenges of the blowing process have been carried out. A special focus has been placed on the different circumstances at University in contrast to industrial bottle production in particular the needed air pressure to form the bottles. The following step was to find the ideal method and principle to handle the preforms and to transform them in the desired shape. Finally the design, drawing of the parts and assemblies were carried out with the 3 -D CAD software Solidworks. The designed parts for the bottle blower have been manufactured at the mechanical Workshop at Massey University. To control the bottle blower, the National Instruments USB interface was selected which required the design and manufacture of an additional driver interface card to protect the USB interface and convert the TTL levels into higher voltage. The final assembly and testing of the blower then concluded the practical work for this master project. A suitable design for the bottle production was found and the assembled Bottle Blower can now be used for the production of PET bottles...|$|R
