25|$|Under South African law living trusts are {{considered}} tax payers. Two types of tax apply to living trusts, namely income tax and {{capital gains tax}} (CGT). A trust pays income tax at a flat rate of 40% (individuals pay according to income scales, usually less than 20%). The trust's income can, however, be taxed {{in the hands of}} either the trust or the <b>beneficiary.</b> <b>A</b> trust pays CGT at the rate of 20% (individuals pay 10%). Trusts do not pay deceased estate tax (although trusts may be required to pay back outstanding loans to a deceased estate, in which the loan amounts are taxable with deceased estate tax).|$|E
25|$|On April 5, 2010, a {{court ruled}} that Duffy could {{continue}} living on Hopper's property, and that he must pay US$12,000 per month spousal and child support for their daughter Galen. Hopper {{did not attend the}} hearing. On May 12, 2010, a hearing was held before Judge Amy Pellman in downtown Los Angeles Superior Court. Though Hopper died two weeks later, Duffy insisted at the hearing that he was well enough to be deposed. The hearing also dealt with who to designate on Hopper's life insurance policy, which listed his wife as a <b>beneficiary.</b> <b>A</b> very ill Hopper did not appear in court though his estranged wife did – case BD518046. Despite Duffy's bid to be named the sole beneficiary of Hopper's million-dollar policy, the judge ruled against her and limited her claim to one-quarter of the policy. The remaining US$750,000 was to go to his estate.|$|E
500|$|Trusts {{have been}} used as a way around the {{original}} doctrine of privity. A trust is an arrangement where the owner of property gives it to a second party (a trustee) to manage on behalf of a third party (a beneficiary). In this situation the House of Lords decided (in Les Affréteurs v Walford [...] AC 801) that the trustee's ability to sue the owner of the property is to be exercised on behalf of the <b>beneficiary,</b> <b>a</b> third party. This is known as a [...] "trust of the promise", and, while artificial, it bypassed the doctrine of privity. The trust exception has been heavily undermined by the decision in Re Schebsman [...] Ch 83, which requires a court to find evidence of an intent to create a trust of the promise rather than simply using the requirement as an intention as a fiction to allow the courts to enact the trust exception.|$|E

500|$|Two further {{problems}} are apparent {{when considering the}} fraud theory {{in the context of}} half-secret trusts. Since the will mentions the trust, it is impossible for the trustee to deny the existence of the trust. Whether or not the intended beneficiaries can be ascertained, in case of inter vivo transaction, the trust-beneficiary cannot benefit personally and any meaning of fraud seems apparent because fraud requires an intention to act dishonestly. It appears to create an alternative route: the trustee may bring false oral testimony in favour of a third party who was not the intended <b>beneficiary,</b> <b>a</b> party that cannot benefit if the law did not uphold half-secret trusts in conclusion but it could operate without court's interference. Secondly, a half-secret trust ought to fail for uncertainty, being a trust with no terms, with a resulting trust to the residuary legatee. Under the rule of three uncertainties in private trust, half or fully secretly trust ought to fail because of lack of intentional element. Those in favour of its enforcement must therefore observe the imposition of resulting trust as required under three certainties rule, and the [...] "fraud" [...] theory seems insufficient to do so, since there is no sublet and significant impact for dishonest act and if otherwise fraud can be upheld; and therefore no conduct {{on the part of the}} trustee to warrant it. The deceased's intended disposition remains imperfectly constituted and the intended beneficiary's claim is thus weaker than the residuary legatee's. Whilst one response has been to suggest that whether a resulting trust or enforcement of the secret trust is most appropriate remedy is a question for the courts, subsequent cases have typically defined the automatic resulting trust, as in this case, as operating as a matter of law and not a question for the courts, and this should be settled by parliament legislation.|$|E
2500|$|In a debated passage, {{the author}} of the Cogad reports Ivar instigating his ally Donnubán mac Cathail (Donovan, the son of Cathal) to meet in his house (commonly said to be hosting a conference or feast) and betray Mathgamain up to Máel Muad mac Brain in 976. Said by the author to be after the confederates, with the {{addition}} of Ivar's son Dubcenn, had gone into revolt against Mathgamain, the Dalcassian prince was regardless in a precarious situation, and according to Alice Stopford Green this act of going into an enemy's house was [...] "the formal sign of submission and renouncing supremacy", from where he soon might have proceeded to submit to Máel Muad, although Mathgamain alternatively may have been attempting to detach Donnubán from the alliance. But it has also been argued that this was entirely the product of Ivar's interference with Donnubán and that Máel Muad, a considerably distance away at the time, was in essence the natural and convenient <b>beneficiary,</b> <b>a</b> theory supported by the account in the Cogad. The annals make no mention of Ivar's involvement, simply reporting Mathgamain's seizure in treachery by Donnubán and the killing of the live prisoner by Máel Muad, {{but at the same time}} do not exclude it.|$|E

50|$|Only one RDSP account may {{be set up}} per {{qualifying}} individual, {{and only}} that beneficiary is entitled to any payments.

A disabled adult with mental capacity who wished to benefit from an RDSP must establish the plan himself or herself, however, family members, friends or others could contribute to a plan established by the disabled person, with his or her permission.|$|E

50|$|Life {{insurance}} (or life assurance, {{especially in}} the Commonwealth of Nations), is a contract between an insurance policy holder and an insurer or assurer, where the insurer promises to pay a designated <b>beneficiary</b> <b>a</b> sum of money (the benefit) {{in exchange for a}} premium, upon the death of an insured person (often the policy holder). Depending on the contract, other events such as terminal illness or critical illness can also trigger payment. The policy holder typically pays a premium, either regularly or as one lump sum. Other expenses (such as funeral expenses) can also be included in the benefits.|$|E
50|$|The legitime {{is usually}} a {{statutory}} fraction of the decedent's gross estate and passes as joint property to the decedent's next-of-kin in equal undivided shares. The legitime cannot be infringed {{in order to give}} a spouse or other <b>beneficiary</b> <b>a</b> greater share of the estate. Therefore, when a decedent has children and leaves a will, it is unlawful for the testator to override the legitime by special gift which exhausts the estate or by designating his spouse or other person as sole beneficiary. This is known as preterition when arising by omission and disinheritance when heirs are expressly deprived.|$|E
50|$|In contested matters, the {{probate court}} {{examines}} {{the authenticity of}} a will and decides who is to receive the deceased person's property. In a case of an intestacy, the court determines who is to receive the deceased's property under the law of its jurisdiction. The probate court will then oversee the process of distributing the deceased's assets to the proper <b>beneficiaries.</b> <b>A</b> probate court can be petitioned by interested parties in an estate, such as when <b>a</b> <b>beneficiary</b> feels that <b>an</b> estate is being mishandled. The court {{has the authority to}} compel an executor to give an account of their actions.|$|R

5000|$|Trustees are {{required}} to keep beneficiaries reasonably informed about {{the administration of the}} trust and of the material facts necessary for them to protect their interests. [...] If a beneficiary asks for information, the trustee is charged to give it (unless the request is somehow unreasonable under the circumstances). [...] This includes providing the <b>beneficiary</b> <b>a</b> copy of the trust agreement, notice of the acceptance or change of trustee and the contact information for the trustee, notice that a trust has become irrevocable due to the grantor's death, and any changes in the trustee's rate of compensation.|$|E

50|$|James Lansing {{was noted}} as an {{innovative}} engineer, but a poor businessman. For {{the next three}} years, Lansing struggled to pay invoices and ship product. As a result of deteriorating business conditions and personal issues, he committed suicide on September 4, 1949. The company then passed {{into the hands of}} Bill Thomas, JBL's then vice-president. Lansing had taken out a $10,000 life insurance policy, naming the company as the <b>beneficiary,</b> <b>a</b> decision that allowed Thomas to continue the company after Lansing's death. Soon after, Thomas purchased Mrs. Lansing's one-third interest in the company and became the sole owner of the company. Thomas is credited with revitalizing the company and spearheading a period of strong growth for the two decades following the founding of JBL.|$|E
50|$|In {{practice}} {{these problems}} are solved by people assigning their policies or placing them in trust with named <b>beneficiaries.</b> If <b>a</b> person obtains an insurance policy on their own life, it is presumed that the person would only name <b>a</b> <b>beneficiary</b> who wants the insured to be alive and healthy. There is no requirement that the <b>beneficiary</b> have <b>a</b> proven insurable interest {{in the life of}} the insured when the insured has purchased the insurance.|$|R
