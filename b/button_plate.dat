Using the fact that compressive stress is directly proportional to area and load, the calculated <b>button</b> to <b>plate</b> stress ratio {{is equal to the}} <b>plate</b> to <b>button</b> area ratio for a constant load. The loads that caused the <b>button</b> and <b>plate</b> to yield were estimated from a load test cell graph obtained from the materials testing facility. The button was simply compressed, but the plate was compressed with a steel cylinder of the same diameter as the aluminum button. The experimental and calculated stress ratios for the <b>button</b> and <b>plate</b> are the same within experimental error. The equation for the plate bearing area is therefore correct...|$|R

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{built-up}} columns {{has been under}} investigation {{since the collapse of}} the Quebec Bridge in 1907, which occurred due to the failure of the lower chords. It was reported that these elements were not designed as latticed columns. It is widely accepted that built-up columns exhibit reduced shear stiffness resulting in an increase in lateral deflection. This reduction in shear stiffness leads to a reduction in the strength of the column, which may be accounted for by increasing the slenderness ratio of the built-up member to an equivalent slenderness ratio. One of the questions addressed by this research was to determine the appropriate value of this equivalent slenderness ratio. A differentiation was made between the action of a battened and a buttoned column. The second problem tackled was the need to limit the slenderness ratio of the individual members between interconnectors to something less than the slenderness ratio of the integral member. It was found that increasing this slenderness ratio decreased the strength of the column, but this could be accounted for by using the equivalent slenderness ratio. The second concern with increasing the slenderness ratio of the individual members between interconnectors was the occurrence of simultaneous local and global buckling. This interaction could also lead to a decrease in the strength of the column resulting from imperfection sensitivity. An experimental program was designed to investigate these problems. Three groups of specimens were tested. The first two groups were composed of channel sections, interconnected by batten plates, placed toe-to-toe forming a box-like section. The ends were hinged about the axis passing through the web, the X axis, and fixed about the other axis, the Y axis. The specimens with one and two interconnectors buckled about the Y axis, whereas, the specimens with more interconnectors buckled about the X axis. The third group was composed of channel sections, placed back-to-back, interconnected by batten or <b>button</b> <b>plates.</b> These specimens were hinged about the Y axis and fixed about the X axis, and buckled about the Y axis.

40|$|Background: Distalisation of {{the upper}} molars {{can be used to}} treat a dental Class II deep bite {{malocclusion}} with a flat facial profile. It is a useful procedure when extraction treatment has been refused and providing distalisation is an appropriate solution to the patient’s problem. Aims: To describe distalisation {{of the upper}} buccal segments using a modified distal jet appliance and miniscrew. Methods: Two case reports are presented. The first case was treated with a distal screw appliance: a modified distal jet appliance with a palatal miniscrew and without the premolar arms. The Nance button was anchored to the palatal bone by a miniscrew inserted through a posterior locating plate. Locating holes in the plate ensured that the miniscrew was inserted into a site with optimal bone in the posterior part of the palate. The second case was treated with a similar distal screw appliance, but in this case the locating plate was embedded in the acrylic button. The miniscrew was inserted through a prepared hole in the <b>button</b> and <b>plate.</b> The locating hole(s) ensured that a screw could be inserted into an optimal site {{to one side of the}} median palatal suture. Conclusions: The distal screw appliance can be used to distalise upper teeth with minimal or no anchorage loss...|$|R

50|$|Thomas Boulsover needed {{financial}} assistance {{to set up a}} business in fused plate and it came from Mr Strelley Pegge of Beauchief Hall who loaned him the necessary capital. He went into partnership with Joseph Wilson whose father was a scythe smith at Sharrow, setting up a workshop on Baker's Hill in Sheffield. The main product of the business was to make <b>buttons</b> from fused <b>plate</b> which would cost {{only a fraction of the}} cost of solid silver buttons. Boulsover's buttons were stamped from a die on a fused metal sheet, then cut out, polished and burnished until they were hardly distinguishable from genuine silver. The business also made buckles, spurs and small snuff boxes. Joseph Wilson left the partnership in the mid 1740s, setting up his own business at Sharrow Mills making Sheffield plate items before diversifying into manufacturing snuff for which the Wilsons became World famous. In 1749 Boulsover rented a lease of land in Beeley Wood to build a grinding wheel, but an alteration to the original lease allowed it to be converted into a tilt forge known as the Nova Scotia Tilts.|$|R

40|$|Automotive {{infotainment}} {{systems are}} automotive equipment manufactured with narrow tolerances. Besides the hardware itself, the components that {{interact with the}} user and {{with the rest of}} the car have to fulfil strict requirements. These components are the <b>buttons</b> face <b>plate</b> and the pins connector. The buttons must fulfil haptics requirements of force and stroke in order that the feeling of pressing them would be the same as the rest car buttons’ feeling. The pins connector must fulfil force requirements in order that ergonomic and resistance characteristics would be achieved. These characteristics must be measured to verify whether the prototypes are within required tolerances in order to produce the infotainment system model. Developing a test device to check the force and stroke characteristics of infotainment systems is the aim of this project. Having its own forcestroke test device in the Panasonic headquarter in Langen would speed up the process of verification and modification of the infotainment systems prototypes and would simplify the design task. To develop the suitable test device required, the characteristics of both kind of test have been taken into account. The button test and the pins connector tests have very different requirements. On one hand, the button test requires high resolution, accuracy and repeatability and its range of force is from 0 N to 10 N. On the other hand, the pins connector tests require applying higher force, from - 125 N to 450 N, being negative for pulling and positive for pushing. Moreover, these kinds of tests do not require sensors resolution and accuracy as high as those for the button test. Taking into account these requirements, a stable and stiff test device with an actuator, two force sensors and a displacement sensor has been developed. The simplicity of the device was a necessity due to the stability and the low cost required. Apart from the design and development of the test device, the application interface has also programmed, using LabVIEW software. The software for controlling and getting the result of the button test has already been developed and is totally functional. However, the software of the pins connector tests will be the next tasks to achieve. Although the repeatability of the test device is acceptable, its accuracy must be tested by a certification company, in order to validate the test device performance. To sum up, this test device has been a good inversion. Panasonic has got a low cost test device with which the company will save money, the infotainment systems will not be tested by an external company, and time, the test device will speed up the verification and modification process of prototypes...|$|R
