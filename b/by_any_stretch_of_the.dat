[...] He continued, [...] "It wasn't perfect <b>by</b> <b>any</b> <b>stretch</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> imagination, and it's not on the same level as the occasional brilliance that South Park reaches on about one occasion per season nowadays, but it's the most fun I've had watching the show that didn't involve a Star Wars parody in many years." [...] McFarland concluded his review by giving the episode a grade of A-. Kate Moon of TV Fanatic also enjoyed the episode, noting, [...] "'Back to the Pilot' was a great meta episode of Family Guy. From poking fun at its own flaws in the original series to acknowledging how silly the cutaway gags can be, Family Guy shone at its layered best tonight." [...] She continued, [...] "Treating its animated characters like real actors was a nice touch as well. [...] Watching the original family showed how much the characters evolved and changed throughout the series' long run." [...] Moon concluded her review by giving the episode a 4.2 out of 5. Tom Eames of entertainment website Digital Spy placed the episode at number two on his listing of the best Family Guy episodes in order of [...] "yukyukyuks" [...] and described the episode as [...] "pure genius". He added, [...] "Not only was the episode hilarious with amazing Brian and Stewie moments, but it was genuinely quite clever in the time-travel stakes, which is impressive on a nerd level." ...|$|E

Moreover, it examines under various aspects if sustainability (truly conceived) - comprising both ecology and social fairness - is incompatible with the worldwide rule of economism. And finally, it suggests ways to leave conventional modernity behind by creating sophisticated but moderate-impact technologies, redirecting relentless accumulation, and appreciating ways of living that are simpler in means, but richer in ends...|$|R

A million dollars: it was a dizzying amount of money that bordered on the ridiculous. I never thought I’d see houses regularly go on sale for a million dollars.

It emphasizes the consolidation of the caste system during the colonial era, intra regional disparities within the two communities, high population densities, very weak economic bases, poverty and international interference {{as some of the}} cardinal dynamics behind the current deadly contentions within the two states. An analysis behind the genocidal tendencies in the two countries is well illustrated, with special emphasis on the Rwandese tragedy of 1994 as well as its parallels and divergences with the Nazi Holocaust. The effects of the conflict in the two countries such as the proliferation of a gigantic refugee problem {{and the role of the}} Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), Globalization, are critically assessed. THE REASON FOR WRITING THIS PAPER was inspired by a question in the African History Affairs Paper at the Advanced School Certificate level by the now defunct East African Examinations Council in 1976, which asked why Rwanda and Burundi had frequently fallen prey to “tribal ” wars. It is quite obvious that the situation in Rwanda and Burundi in 1976 was <b>by</b> <b>any</b> <b>stretch</b> <b>of</b> imagination “more tame ” than the one in 1996.
