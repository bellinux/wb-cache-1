40|$|This {{technical}} note describes factors affecting batch leaching of metals from dredged material. Factors evaluated include time of sediment-water contact, sedi-ment salinity regime, and sediment oxidation status. Background Contaminated dredged material is often placed in confined disposal facilities where movement of contaminants by leachate {{is an important}} environmental con-cern. No laboratory testing protocol has been routinely applied to predict leachate quality and quantity from confined dredged material disposal facilities. In 1984, the US Army Corps of Engineers initiated investigations of confined disposal facility (CDF) leachate by developing a theoretical framework for prediction of leachate quality based on mass transport theory. The theoretical framework in-cluded both <b>batch</b> and column <b>testing</b> in an integrated approach. <b>Batch</b> <b>testing</b> provides a quick, relatively easy method for determining the distribution of con-taminants between dredged material and leachate. Equilibrium distribution (partitioning) coefficients derived from <b>batch</b> <b>tests</b> can then be used to relate leachate contaminant concentrations to solid phase contaminant concentrations. Column testing more closely approximates contaminant losses under field condi-tions in a CDF than do <b>batch</b> <b>tests.</b> Leachate results predicted by <b>batch</b> <b>tests</b> {{can be compared to}} those observed from column leaching experiments by combining column tests results, distribution coefficients from <b>batch</b> <b>tests,</b> and mass transport theory.

The mobile Se oxyanions, Se(IV) and Se(VI), can be adsorbed to mineral phases or reduced biotically or abiotically to Se solid phases, such as Se(0). Microbial analyses and geochemical testing were conducted to determine if Se can be sequestered in anoxic coal waste rock by these mechanisms. Testing was conducted on a waste rock sample collected from the West Line Creek waste rock dump in the Elk Valley and a water sample collected from the rock drain flowing beneath the dump. Microbial analyses included culturing with plate and broth media and 16 S rRNA gene sequencing. The key finding from these analyses was that bacteria capable of reducing Se(VI) to Se(0) were present in the waste rock sample and bacteria capable of reducing Se(IV) to Se(0) were present in the rock drain water sample. Geochemical <b>tests</b> included abiotic <b>batch</b> <b>tests</b> on waste rock and pure minerals, non-sterile <b>batch</b> <b>tests</b> on waste rock, and desorption <b>batch</b> <b>tests</b> on waste rock, as well as several solids analysis techniques, such as X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy and Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy. <b>Batch</b> <b>tests</b> were conducted at circumneutral pH in an anoxic glove box to simulate an anoxic zone of a waste rock dump. <b>Batch</b> <b>testing</b> on pure minerals present in the waste rock sample determined that siderite can reduce Se(VI) to Se(IV) and that siderite, pyrite, and sphalerite can adsorb Se(IV) and reduce Se(IV) to Se(0). Under sterile conditions, waste rock did not reduce Se(VI) but it did adsorb Se(IV) and reduce Se(IV) to Se(0). Under non-sterile conditions, Se(VI) was reduced to Se(IV) much faster than the sterile tests with siderite and Se(IV) was removed from solution by a combination of adsorption, biotic reduction, and abiotic reduction.

40|$|Batch {{tests to}} measure maximum acetate {{utilization}} rates {{were used to}} determine the distribution of acetate utilizers in expanded-bed sand and expanded-bed granular activated carbon (GAC) reactors. The reactors were fed a mixture of acetate and 3 -ethylphenol, and they contained the same predominant aceticlastic methanogen, Methanothrix sp. Batch tests were performed both on the entire reactor contents and with media removed from the reactors. Results indicated that activity was evenly distributed within the GAC reactors, whereas in the sand reactor a sludge blanket on top of the sand bed contained approximately 50 % of the activity. The Monod half-velocity constant (Ks) for the acetate-utilizing methanogens in two expanded-bed GAC reactors was searched for by combining steady-state results with <b>batch</b> <b>test</b> data. All parameters necessary to develop a model with Monod kinetics were experimentally determined except for Ks.
