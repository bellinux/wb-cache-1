Methods: <b>Butorphanol</b> <b>tartrate,</b> ketamine hydrochloride, and droperidol have been examined for compatibility and stability when combined with 0. 9 % sodium chloride injection stored at 4 °C and 25 °C with light protection for a total of 14 days. Concentrations were 0. 067 mg/mL, 1. 33 mg/mL, and 0. 033 mg/mL for <b>butorphanol</b> <b>tartrate,</b> ketamine hydrochloride, and droperidol, respectively. Drug concentrations were determined using high-performance liquid chromatographic analysis. Results: All three drugs were very stable (> 97 %) at 4 °C and 25 °C for 14 days. The ternary admixtures were initially clear and colorless throughout the observation period, and the pH value did not change significantly. Conclusion: The results confirm that the ternary admixture of <b>butorphanol</b> <b>tartrate</b> 0. 067 mg/mL, ketamine hydrochloride 1. 33 mg/mL, and droperidol 0. 033 mg/mL in 0. 9 % sodium chloride injection were stable for 14 days when stored in polyolefin bags at 4 °C and 25 °C and protected from light.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} whether preemptive multimodal analgesia (diclofenac, butorphanol, and lidocaine) was obtained during sagittal split ramus osteotomy (SSRO). Following institutional approval and informed consent, 82 healthy patients (ASA-I) undergoing SSRO were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups, the preemptive multimodal analgesia group (group P, n = 41) and the control group (group C, n = 41). This study was conducted in a double-blind manner. Patients in group P received 50 mg rectal diclofenac sodium, 10 micrograms/kg intravenous 0. 1 % <b>butorphanol</b> <b>tartrate,</b> and 1 % lidocaine solution containing 10 micrograms/mL epinephrine for regional anesthesia and for bilateral inferior alveolar nerve blocks before the start of surgery.

40|$|Objectives: This study {{investigated}} whether pain catastrophizing {{is associated with}} distress and perceived disability in patients with atrial fibrillation, whether pain catastrophizing predicts pain and fear during a medical procedure of atrial cardioversion, and whether pain catastrophizing influences the effects of an opioid analgesic during internal cardioversion. Methods: A secondary analysis is performed upon data from a double-blind placebo-controlled trial during which the effect of intranasal <b>butorphanol</b> <b>tartrate</b> (INB) was evaluated in patients with atrial fibrillation using a step-up internal atrial cardioversion protocol. Before the procedure, patients completed measures of pain catastrophizing, mood, distress and perceived disability. After each shock, patients completed measures of pain and fear. Results: We found that pain catastrophizing predicted the affective pain rating of the first shock, and the fear increase during subsequent shocks. There was no effect of INB. However, when controlling for the differences in pain catastrophizing, INB significantly reduced fear as compared to placebo. This suggests {{that the effects of}} INB during atrial cardioversion were overshadowed by the effects of pain catastrophizing. Conclusions: It is recommended that in future atrial cardioversion trials, stratification based on pain catastrophizing be performed. Reducing catastrophizing thinking about pain through cognitive-behavioral techniques are likely to reduce levels of fear during internal atrial cardioversion and may increase the effectiveness of concomitant analgesics.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} {{analgesic}} efficacy of administration of <b>butorphanol</b> <b>tartrate,</b> phenylbutazone, or both drugs in combination in colts undergoing routine castration. DESIGN: Randomized controlled clinical trial. ANIMALS: 36 client-owned colts. PROCEDURES: Horses received treatment with butorphanol alone (0. 05 mg/kg [0. 023 mg/ lb], IM, prior to surgery and then q 4 h for 24 hours), phenylbutazone alone (4. 4 mg/kg [2. 0 mg/lb], IV, prior to surgery and then 2. 2 mg/kg [1. 0 mg/lb], PO, q 12 h for 3 days), or butorphanol and phenylbutazone at the aforementioned dosages (12 horses/group). For single-drug–treated horses, appropriate placebos {{were administered to}} balance treatment protocols among groups. All horses were anesthetized, and lidocaine hydrochloride was injected into each testis. Physical and physiological variables, plasma cortisol concentration, body weight, and water consumption were assessed before and at intervals after surgery, and induction of and recovery from anesthesia were subjectively characterized. Observers assessed signs of pain by use of a visual analogue scale and a numerical rating scale. RESULTS: Significant changes in gastrointestinal sounds, fecal output, and plasma cortisol concentrations were evident in each treatment group over time, compared with preoperative values. At any time point, assessed variables and signs of pain {{did not differ significantly}} among groups, although the duration of recumbency after surgery was longest for the butorphanol-phenylbutazone–treated horses. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: With intratesticular injections of lidocaine, administration of butorphanol to anesthetized young horses undergoing routine castration had the same apparent analgesic effect as phenylbutazone treatment. Combined butorphanolphenylbutazone treatment was not apparently superior to either drug used alone...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE To {{determine}} {{effects of}} anesthesia on plasma concentrations and pulsatility of ACTH in samples {{obtained from the}} cavernous sinus and jugular vein of horses. ANIMALS 6 clinically normal adult horses. PROCEDURES Catheters were placed in a jugular vein and into the cavernous sinus via a superficial facial vein. The following morning (day 1), cavernous sinus blood samples were collected every 5 minutes for 1 hour (collection of first sample = time 0) and jugular venous blood samples were collected at 0, 30, and 60 minutes. On day 2, horses were sedated with xylazine hydrochloride and anesthesia was induced with propofol mixed with ketamine hydrochloride. Horses were positioned in dorsal recumbency. Anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane in oxygen and a continuous rate infusion of <b>butorphanol</b> <b>tartrate.</b> One hour after anesthesia was induced, the blood sample protocol was repeated. Plasma ACTH concentrations were quantified by use of a commercially available sandwich assay.

Before surgery, {{the animals were}} anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of 0.1  mL/ 100  g of body weight of the above-described mixed anesthetic. They were then placed in the prone position, and an incision was made at {{the middle of the}} spine at the L 4 –L 6 level. The fascia was incised, and the multifidus muscles were moved laterally to expose the facet joint between the left fifth and sixth lumbar vertebrae using an operating microscope. The left L 5 dorsal root ganglion (DRG) was exposed after left L 5 /L 6 facetectomy. By puncturing the 4 / 5 or 5 / 6 coccygeal vertebral discs with forceps after dorsal skin incision, autologous NP was harvested and applied to the left L 5 DRG (Otoshi et al. 2010, 2011; Miyoshi et al. 2011; Sasaki et al. 2011; Sekiguchi et al. 2011). Fascia was closed with 4 – 0 nylon, and the skin was closed with surgical staples. Animals in the sham group underwent the same surgical procedure with the NP harvesting but without NP application to the DRG. All animals were returned to their original cages and monitored visually at the appropriate intervals to confirm recovery from anesthesia and their ability to access food and water by themselves.|$|E
40|$|Orofacial pain is {{associated}} with various pathologies such as headache, dental pain and ophthalmic pain. The trigeminal system innervates a large section of the head, including the nasal and oral cavities, the cornea and facial skin, and {{is responsible for the}} transmission of pain signals from the orofacial regions to the brain. These investigations were undertaken to study the effect of intranasal delivery of analgesics on orofacial pain using an operant testing method in mice. Doses of either lidocaine HCl or <b>butorphanol</b> <b>tartrate</b> were administered to mice, and the analgesic effectiveness was measured using a thermal operant behavior test involving a facial heat stimulus. Two parameters were measured in the operant assay: the number of licks and the duration of facial contact. Pain response was measured at two different temperatures: 37 ºC and 49 ºC. The magnitude of analgesic response was also compared between intranasal and intraperitoneal drug administration at 49 ºC. Mice showed a significant {{decrease in the number of}} licks and duration of facial contact for both treatment and control groups as the temperature was increased from 37 ºC to 49 ºC. A significant difference in the duration of facial contact was observed following either lidocaine or butorphanol by nasal administration. One group of animals receiving intranasal lidocaine did exhibit an increase in the duration of facial contact compared to the control. Two doses of butorphanol were tested and increases in the duration of facial contact were observed at both levels, but no significant difference was observed in the number of licks recorded. No convincing differences were observed in the mice behaviors for intranasal or intraperitoneal dosing of lidocaine or butorphanol. This suggests that nasal administration of these two analgesics at the doses tested did not provide superior pain relief compared to systemic delivery of the agents...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the viability of laparoscopic testicular artery ligation as an alternative to the more conventional castration methods in equids. Twelve intact male donkeys varying in age from 5 months to 13 years were used in this study. Two of these donkeys were castrated by means of an open technique. The remaining donkeys underwent testicular artery ligation under laparoscopic guidance. Ligation of the testicular artery was achieved by application of Filshie clips under laparoscopic visualisation. This was performed with the donkeys standing in stocks and sedated with a combination of detomidine hydrochloride and <b>butorphanol</b> <b>tartrate.</b> The ten donkeys which underwent testicular artery ligation were unilaterally castrated using an acceptable open castration technique on two separate occasions. The first testes were removed at a specific time period after testicular artery ligation, while the second testes were all removed on the same day 9 months after the first group of donkeys underwent laparoscopic assisted testicular artery ligation. The remaining two donkeys which acted as controls underwent a standard open bilateral castration procedure both testes being removed on the same day. All the testes removed, excluding one testis lost to the study, were evaluated histologically. Four testes were used as controls. Thirteen testes showed histological signs of ischaemic necrosis, degeneration and/or atrophy. Three testes showed histological tubular degeneration and atrophy as well as the presence of some normal tissue. The remaining three testes were histologically unchanged. One of the testes was accidentally misplaced at post mortem due to human error. Avascular necrosis of the testicular tissue was not successful in all the subjects.

40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) Treating {{pediatric}} dental patients {{four years}} old and younger can be difficult at times due to patient behavior. Conscious sedation has been employed {{as a means to}} control pediatric dental patients for several years. <b>Butorphanol</b> <b>tartrate</b> has been used safely for pain control in pediatric patients for several years, but has never been used for sedating pediatric dental patients. The {{purpose of this study is}} to compare the behavioral and physiologic effects of conscious sedation on pediatric dental patients using intramuscular meperidine and an equipotent dosage of intramuscular butorphanol. Forty conscious sedations of ASA I pediatric dental patients between the ages of 13 and 60 months were accomplished using either 2. 0 mg/kg of intramuscular meperidine or 0. 03 mg/kg of intramuscular butorphanol. Each sedation was videotaped and three viewers viewed the videotapes rating them with a computer program (ACS) involving a four-code behavior rating scale. The tlrree viewers rated patient behavior for each sedation also with a form with global rating, categorical, and dichotomous scales. Physiologic signs of oxygen saturation, blood pressure, heart rate, and respiration rate were monitored at baseline and every 5 minutes during treatment. The operator also rated the sedation patient behavior with a form that had pre-treatment Frankl, post-treatment Frankl, global rating categorical, dichotomous, and sedation success rating scales. The two groups demographic data, physiologic data, ACS data, the three viewer's behavior rating form, and the operator's behavior rating form were analyzed for any statistically significant differences between the groups. The statistical analysis of the demographic data revealed a statistically significant trend in the butorphanol group toward extractions. The meperidine group had a statistically significant higher mean oxygen saturation during treatment (99. 63 percent) than the butorphanol group (99. 20 percent). The butorphanol group spent significantly more time in the annoyed ACS behavior rating code and showed a trend toward less time spent in the quiet ACS behavior rating code. There were no statistically significant differences in the three viewers ratings of global rating, categorical, and dichotomous scales. The operators' ratings showed the meperidine group had a statistically significant better global rating than the butorphanol group. Overall butorphanol appears to be equal clinically to meperidine in physiologic effects and patient behavior effects. No adverse effects occurred with either medication. Butorphanol may be offered as an alternative sedative agent to other narcotic sedative agents with more side effects...|$|E
