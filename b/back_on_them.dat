25|$|The Progressives {{were founded}} {{during the late}} 1870s {{by a group of}} yangban who fully {{supported}} Westernization of Joseon. However, they wanted immediate Westernization, including a complete cut-off of ties with Qing China. Unaware of their anti-Chinese sentiments, the Queen Consort granted frequent audiences and meetings with them to discuss progressivism and nationalism. They advocated for educational and social reforms, including the equality of the sexes by granting women full rights, issues that were not even acknowledged in their already Westernized neighbor of Japan. The Queen Consort was completely enamored by the Progressives in the beginning, but when she learned that they were deeply anti-Chinese, she quickly turned her <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>them.</b> Cutting ties with China immediately was not in her gradual plan of Westernization. She saw the consequences Joseon would have to face if she did not play China and Japan off by the West gradually, especially since she was a strong advocate of the Sadae faction who were pro-China and pro-gradual Westernization.|$|E

One, there are four other teams in our division who are going to make sure that doesn't happen, and two, has anyone ever heard of plagiarism? [...] That was pretty good, especially coming from him. He's a quiet guy, so it was probably shocking when he said it. Not shocking in a bad way, like 'Wow, I can't believe he said that.' More like, 'Wow, he finally said something because he's a leader on that team and you definitely need to be a vocal leader." ...|$|E
500|$|Eastwood's {{next film}} The Eiger Sanction (1975) {{was based on}} Trevanian's {{critically}} acclaimed spy novel of the same name. Eastwood plays Jonathan Hemlock in a role originally intended for Paul Newman, an assassin turned college art professor who decides {{to return to his}} former profession for one last [...] "sanction" [...] in return for a rare Pissarro painting. In the process he must climb the north face of the Eiger in Switzerland under perilous conditions. Mike Hoover taught Eastwood how to climb during several weeks of preparation at Yosemite in the summer of 1974 before filming commenced in Grindelwald, Switzerland on August 12, 1974. Despite prior warnings about the perils of the Eiger the film crew suffered a number of accidents, including one fatality. Despite the danger, Eastwood insisted on doing all his own climbing and stunts. Upon release in May 1975 The Eiger Sanction was a commercial failure, receiving only $23.8million at the box office, and was poorly received by most critics. Joy Gould Boyum of the Wall Street Journal dismissed the film as [...] "brutal fantasy". Eastwood blamed Universal Studios for the film's poor promotion and turned his <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>them</b> to make an agreement with Warner Brothers, through Frank Wells, that has lasted to the present day.|$|E
50|$|They even {{abandoned}} their heavy {{image and the}} graphics for these works were less extreme. Inexorably, fans turned their <b>backs</b> <b>on</b> <b>them</b> and the sales of the album were a relative fiasco, thus they split up in 1998.|$|R

She {{suggests that it}} would be better for literature to turn their <b>backs</b> <b>on</b> <b>them</b> so it can move forward, for better or worse. While Woolf criticizes the aforementioned three authors, she praises several other authors for their innovation. This group of writers she names spiritualists, and includes James Joyce who Woolf says writes what interests and moves him.|$|R
2500|$|According to Long, Akan or [...] "Coromantee" [...] culture obliterated {{any other}} African customs and {{incoming}} non-Akan Africans had {{to submit to}} the culture of the majority Akan population in Jamaica. Akan deities referred to as Abosom in the Twi language were documented, and enslaved Akans would praise Nyankopong (erroneously written by the British as Accompong); libations would be poured to Asase Yaa (erroneously written as [...] "Assarci") and Epo the sea god. Bonsam was referred to as the god of evil. The John Canoe festival was created in Jamaica and the Caribbean by enslaved Akan that sided with the man known as John Canoe. John Canoe was a man from Axim, Ghana he was an Akan from the Ahanta. He was a soldier for the Germans, until one day he turned his <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>them</b> for his Ahanta people and sided with Nzima and Asante troops, in order to take the area from the Germans and other Europeans. The news of his victory reached Jamaica and he was celebrated ever since that Christmas of 1708 he had first defeated German forces for Axim. Twenty years later his stronghold was broken by neighbouring Fante forces aided by the military might of the British. This resulted in the Ahanta, Nzima and Asante warriors becoming captives and being taken to Jamaica as prisoners of war, numbering some 20,000 men.|$|E

He was backed by Melbourne band The Phantoms on all these recordings. He then recorded two singles with the band Grandmas Tonic as lead vocalist. His last two singles, once again under his own name, were for the Astor label although he was still <b>backed</b> <b>on</b> <b>them</b> by Grandma's Tonic,(ex-members of Tony Worsley's backing band 'The Fabulous Blue Jays').|$|R

He said the Party was in need of a [...] "political audit" [...] and had [...] "moved so far to the right that they might as well be called Republicrats." [...] He told the Amsterdam News, [...] "Black folks need to consider a mass exodus from the Democratic Party and build a new party of their own, because the Democrats have turned their <b>backs</b> <b>on</b> <b>them</b> <b>on</b> too many occasions. We should not give any party blind loyalty and support. Instead, we should really form a grassroots, Black-agenda-based third-party option." ...|$|R
50|$|However, {{critical}} and consumer reaction to Heres the World for Ya went the opposite way. The album {{was not the}} hit the record company was hoping for, especially considering Fosters previous track record of producing massive international hits for artists such as Chicago, John Parr and Barbra Streisand. Many found Fosters richly ornamented production style conflicted with the Payolas previous highly creative, eclectic works. Furthermore, the band lost many loyal fans who felt the Payolas had turned their <b>backs</b> <b>on</b> <b>them</b> with the commercial compromises. As a consequence of all these factors, within weeks of Heres the World for Yas release (and relative commercial failure), the band was dropped by A&M.|$|R

50|$|The {{first major}} Magic: The Gathering tournament was the 1994 World Championship held at Gen Con '94.

However, Dolan was also given {{a large number of}} booster packs from various expansions, Arabian Nights through Ice Age, along with a deck of poker cards with Magic: The Gathering <b>backs</b> <b>on</b> <b>them</b> and a T-shirt. The secondary market value of those packs today would exceed many tournament payoffs, but is still not quite equal to the cash prizes of the current Pro Tour payouts.
