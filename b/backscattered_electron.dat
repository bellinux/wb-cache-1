2500|$|Backscattered {{electrons}} (BSE) {{consist of}} high-energy electrons {{originating in the}} electron beam, that are reflected or back-scattered out of the specimen interaction volume by elastic scattering interactions with specimen atoms. Since heavy elements (high atomic number) backscatter electrons more strongly than light elements (low atomic number), and thus appear brighter in the image, BSE are used to detect contrast between areas with different chemical compositions. The Everhart-Thornley detector, which is normally positioned {{to one side of}} the specimen, is inefficient for the detection of backscattered electrons because few such electrons are emitted in the solid angle subtended by the detector, and because the positively biased detection grid has little ability to attract the higher energy BSE. Dedicated <b>backscattered</b> <b>electron</b> detectors are positioned above the sample in a [...] "doughnut" [...] type arrangement, concentric with the electron beam, maximizing the solid angle of collection. BSE detectors are usually either of scintillator or of semiconductor types. When all parts of the detector are used to collect electrons symmetrically about the beam, atomic number contrast is produced. However, strong topographic contrast is produced by collecting back-scattered electrons from one side above the specimen using an asymmetrical, directional BSE detector; the resulting contrast appears as illumination of the topography from that side. Semiconductor detectors can be made in radial segments that can be switched in or out to control the type of contrast produced and its directionality.|$|E

40|$|When a fixed anode {{x-ray tube}} {{is placed in}} a {{magnetic}} field (B) that {{is parallel to the}} anode-cathode axis, the x-ray exposure increases with increasing B. It was hypothesized that the increase was caused by <b>backscattered</b> <b>electrons</b> which were constrained by B and reaccelerated by the electric field onto the x-ray tube target. We performed computer simulations and physical experiments to study the behavior of the <b>backscattered</b> <b>electrons</b> in a magnetic field, and their effects on the radiation output, x-ray spectrum, and off-focal radiation. A Monte Carlo program (EGS 4) was used to generate the combined energy and angular distribution of the <b>backscattered</b> <b>electrons.</b> The electron trajectories were traced and their landing locations back on the anode were calculated. Radiation emission from each point was modeled with published data (IPEM Report 78), and thus the exposure rate and x-ray spectrum with the contribution of <b>backscattered</b> <b>electrons</b> could be predicted. The point spread function for a pencil beam of electrons was generated and then convolved with the density map of primary electrons incident on the anode as simulated with a finite element program (Opera- 3 d, Vector Fields, UK). The total spatial distribution of x-ray emission could then be calculated. Simulations showed that for an x-ray tube working at 65 kV, about 54 % of the electrons incident on the target were backscattered. In a magnetic field of 0. 5 T, although the exposure would be increased by 33 %, {{only a small fraction of}} the <b>backscattered</b> <b>electrons</b> landed within the focal spot area. The x-ray spectrum was slightly shifted to lower energies and the half value layer (HVL) was reduced by about 6 %. Measurements of the exposure rate, half value layer and focal spot distribution were acquired as functions of B. Good agreement was observed between experimental data and simulation results.

The <b>electron</b> <b>backscatter</b> increases with the increase in thickness of the metal until a saturation level is reached and thereafter no change in scatter enhancement is noticed. AimElectron backscatter effects at metallic interfaces were analysed in this study. High energy electron beams ranging from 6 to 20 MeV were used. Materials/MethodsMeasurements were carried out with a PTW thin-window parallel plate ionization chamber and an RDM- 1 F electrometer. Thin sheets of aluminium, copper and lead were used as inhomogeneities. The chamber was positioned below the inhomogeneities with the gantry maintained under the couch. ResultsThe <b>electron</b> <b>backscatter</b> factor (EBSF) increases with increase in energy for aluminium, copper and lead. With low atomic number materials EBSF increases with increase in scatterer thickness and for lead it attains saturation within a few millimetres.
