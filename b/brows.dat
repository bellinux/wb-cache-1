5|$|Verses 12.23–31 {{state that}} the lingasharira, which is the subtle body that is not visible, glistens in the central region of the body or the heart or the forehead. This shining Shakti (force, energy, power), {{translates}} Bhattacharya, is realised by the knower of Brahman through his concentrated vision. Atman is perceived when the mind located {{in the space between}} the eyebrows, becomes free of all distractions and activities. In this state, the yogin becomes aware of self within, and in the sages, in siddhas and others. If dissolution of the mind in the space between the eye <b>brows</b> does not occur, the yogin should envision absolute bliss, alternatively the full moon inside the mouth. This helps the mind dissolve away distractions and activity, helping it reside in Vishnupada or the Akasha (sky), and brings the yogin closer to moksha or liberation. This is a stage where the feeling of liberation and bliss begins to emerge, the goal of the practice of yoga.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND A {{huge number}} of {{procedures}} for forehead and <b>brow</b> rejuvenation have been described. Nevertheless, the surgical approach of <b>brow</b> aesthetics in terms of correction of <b>brow</b> fullness and symmetry has not been systematically evaluated in the literature. We recently proposed a 20 -degree beveled <b>brow</b> incision technique for direct <b>brow</b> lifting. The aim {{of the present study}} is to evaluate the 20 -degree beveled <b>brow</b> incision technique for <b>brow</b> reduction, reshaping and correction of <b>brow</b> symmetry. MATERIALS AND METHODS Eighteen patients underwent <b>brow</b> reshaping by using the 20 -degree beveled <b>brow</b> incision technique combined or not with other lifting procedure (<b>brow</b> lift, blepharoplasty, face lift). The surgical outcome was evaluated by photographic documentation and a questionnaire on patient satisfaction. Follow-up was at least 6 months. RESULTS The surgical outcome in terms of <b>brow</b> symmetry, fullness and scaring was very good in 14 of 18 patients, good in 2 patients and poor in 2 patients. The last two patients were smokers. Motor or sensibility disorders were not observed. CONCLUSION The 20 -degree beveled <b>brow</b> incision technique seems to be saved and effective as surgical procedure to improve <b>brow</b> aesthetics in terms of symmetry and fullness while a supplement lifting maneuver is easily to perform...|$|R

40|$|Background: <b>Brow</b> {{elevation}} {{is one of}} {{the goals}} of surgical rejuvenation procedures. In this article, the authors reviewed their experience with <b>brow</b> lift, and they compared 4 different techniques: direct <b>brow</b> lift, <b>brow</b> lift with endotine ribbon device, <b>brow</b> lift with temporoparietalis imbrication, and <b>brow</b> lift with Mersilene mesh to provide long-lasting results. Methods: This is a retrospective study of 80 patients (20 for each group), aged between 48 and 75 years undergoing <b>brow</b> lift surgery, between January 2011 and January 2013. In all cases, the <b>brow</b> lift was associated with an upper blepharoplasty. The amount of <b>brow</b> elevation reduced was assessed by comparison of the preoperative and postoperative vertical distances between the superior eyebrow hairline and the midpupil and lateral and medial canthal angle. The average follow-up period was 18 months. Results: No incidences of infection, alopecia, or excessive scarring were noticed. The main complication associated with direct <b>brow</b> lift was visibility of the scar in 2 patients. One patient treated with <b>brow</b> lift with suture had recurrent eyebrow ptosis. Transient frontal paresthesia was noticed in 1 case treated with endotine ribbon device and in 1 case treated with Mersilene mesh, but this sensation returned by 6 – 12 weeks. Conclusions: In our experience, there does not exist a technique better than the other, but the best procedure depends on eyebrow contour, sex and age of the patient, magnitude of desired correction, presence or absence of patient’s hair, and patient’s expectations...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- Previous {{efforts in}} {{automatic}} facial expression recognition {{have been limited}} to posed facial behavior under well-controlled conditions (e. g., frontal pose and minimal out-of-plane head motion). The CMU/Pitt automated facial image analysis system (AFA) accommodates varied pose, moderate out-of-plane head motion, and occlusion. AFA was tested in video of two-person interviews originally collected to answer substantive questions in psychology, and represent a substantial challenge to automatic recognition of facial expression. This report focuses on two action units, <b>brow</b> raising and <b>brow</b> lowering because of their importance to emotion expression and paralinguistic communication. For two-state recognition, AFA achieved 89 % accuracy. For three-state recognition (<b>brow</b> raising, <b>brow</b> lowering, and no <b>brow</b> action), accuracy was 76 %. <b>Brow</b> and head motion were temporally coordinated. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of action unit recognition in spontaneous facial behavior...|$|R

40|$|Endoscopic <b>brow</b> lift {{has become}} widely {{accepted}} as a procedure for restoring a youthful <b>brow,</b> as only three, hardly noticeable incisions of the scalp are needed for this subperiosteal dissection and final repositioning of the <b>brow.</b> It has become an acceptable technique, {{an alternative to the}} conventional technique or transcoronal browpexy. Endoscopic <b>brow</b> lift allows separation and repositioning of the periosteum of the orbital rims and zygomaxilla. In a 7 -year period beginning September 1999, 350 patients underwent endoscopic <b>brow</b> lift. In these patients, we used our fixation approach, which was accomplished with an absorbable suture subperiosteally. Satisfactory forehead rejuvenation was obtained in all patients with correct eyebrow movement. Long-term results over 7 years confirm the strength and durability of our fixation approach. We consider this approach to be a simple, fast, and reliable fixation technique that establishes precise, secure, and direct <b>brow</b> fixation that allows satisfactory and long-lasting cosmetic results...|$|R

25|$|Figure-work {{seems to}} have been universal. To carve a figure/design in wood may be not only more {{difficult}} but also less satisfactory than sculpting with marble, owing to the tendency of wood to crack, to be damaged by insects, or to suffer from changes in the atmosphere. The texture of the material, too, often proves challenging to the expression of features, especially in the classic type of youthful face. On the other hand, magnificent examples exist of the more rugged features of age: the beetling <b>brows,</b> the furrows and lines neutralizing the defects of the grain of the wood. In ancient work the surface may not have been of such consequence, for figures as a rule being painted for protection and especially color.|$|E
40|$|Background: As the ptotic <b>brow</b> {{drops below}} the supraorbital rim, it can {{exacerbate}} dermatochalasis by pushing the adjacent {{skin of the}} upper lid further down. Aim: The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the outcomes associated with a combined pretrichial <b>brow</b> lift and upper lid blepharoplasty in patients with dermatochalasis and mild to moderate <b>brow</b> ptosis. Materials and Methods: A retrospective case series of 46 patients with dermatochalasis and mild to moderate <b>brow</b> ptosis treated with a combined, bilateral pretrichial <b>brow</b> lift and upper lid blepharoplasty from January 2008 to December 2011. Main outcome measures included measurements of <b>brow</b> lift at 3 months post-operatively, complications encountered, patient satisfaction and surgeon satisfaction. Results: Outcomes from 46 patients were evaluated. The mean <b>brow</b> lift was 1. 85 mm at the lateral canthus, 1. 54 mm at the lateral limbus, 1. 31 mm at the mid-pupil, and 1. 07 mm at the medial limbus. <b>Brow</b> lift at the lateral canthus was significantly more elevated than at the medial limbus (P < 0. 001). Minor complications were encountered in seven of 46 patients (15. 2 %). Mean patient satisfaction score was 3. 20 and surgeon satisfaction 3. 24 (max = 4, very satisfied). Conclusions: The modified pretrichial <b>brow</b> lift offered effective lateral lift that complements an upper lid blepharoplasty. This technique was met with a high degree of patient and surgeon satisfaction, and had a minimal complication profile...|$|R

Moai are carved in relatively flat planes, the faces bearing proud but enigmatic expressions. The human figures would be {{outlined in the}} rock wall first, then chipped away until only the image was left. The over-large heads (a three-to-five ratio between the head and the trunk, a sculptural trait that demonstrates the Polynesian belief in {{the sanctity of the}} chiefly head) have heavy <b>brows</b> and elongated noses with a distinctive fish-hook-shaped curl of the nostrils. The lips protrude in a thin pout. Like the nose, the ears are elongated and oblong in form. The jaw lines stand out against the truncated neck. The torsos are heavy, and, sometimes, the clavicles are subtly outlined in stone. The arms are carved in bas relief and rest against the body in various positions, hands and long slender fingers resting along the crests of the hips, meeting at the hami (loincloth), with the thumbs sometimes pointing towards the navel. Generally, the anatomical features of the backs are not detailed, but sometimes bear a ring and girdle motif on the buttocks and lower back.
