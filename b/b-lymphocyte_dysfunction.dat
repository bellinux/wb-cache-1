40|$|For about 17 {{years the}} Friese Staby and Wetterhoun {{association}} has {{been dealing with}} unexplained mortality among Wetterhoun pups. The clinical signs {{and the results of}} the random tests that have been performed over the years show that the affected pups are immune deficient. The syndrome shows great resemblance with the syndrome known as Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). SCID refers to a group of genetic disorders which all lead to a failing immune system and often result in death during infancy. It is characterized by T- and <b>B-lymphocyte</b> <b>dysfunction</b> or absence. In 2002 SCID has been found in the Jack Russell terrier and in this breed it is caused by a mutation in the DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit gene (DNA-PKcs). This mutation leads to a faulty V(D) J recombination [1]. This study shows that the affected Wetterhoun pups are suffering from SCID, but that this is not caused by the same mutation that causes SCID in the Jack Russell terrier. We also show that, of the genes involved in the V(D) J recombination, DNA PKcs, KU 70, KU 80, Artemis, DNA Ligase IV and XRCC 4 are highly unlikely to be involved in SCID in the Wetterhoun. We could however not conclude the same for the genes RAG 1 and RAG 2. A mutation in either of these genes still remains a good possibility of being the cause of SCID in the Wetterhoun...|$|E
40|$|<b>B-lymphocyte</b> <b>dysfunction</b> is a {{characteristic}} {{feature of the}} acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and of the AIDS-related complex. The aim {{of the present study}} was to further examine the influences exercised by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV; formerly called human T-lymphotropic virus type III or lymphadenopathy-associated virus, HTLV-III/LAV) on normal human B lymphocytes. An unfractionated protein preparation, made from HIV purified by density gradient centrifugation, was previously shown to induce differentiation of normal human B lymphocytes into immunoglobulin-secreting cells. In the present analyses, this B-lymphocyte response peaked on day 6 or 7 after culture initiation and was found to be independent of the requirement for monocytes but to require T cells. Responses could also be elicited in cultures of purified B cells by the addition of T cells that had been exposed to HIV antigen. Inhibitors of protein synthesis (puromycin and cycloheximide) abrogated the responses. In contrast to its stimulatory effects, the same virus preparation was previously shown to inhibit polyclonal responses that are normally elicited in peripheral blood lymphocyte cultures by a T-dependent stimulus (pokeweed mitogen) and T-independent stimulus (Epstein-Barr virus). The present studies suggest that the inhibitory effects of the HIV antigen studied herein are targeted primarily at the B lymphocytes. The role of T lymphocytes in the HIV antigen-mediated inhibitory effects, although demonstrated, could not be conclusively established as an essential pathway. These findings elucidate mechanisms by which components of HIV exert stimulatory as well as inhibitory effects on human B lymphocytes and thereby lead to the dysfunction of these cells in HIV infection...|$|E
40|$|Background: Brain injury {{during the}} {{neonatal}} period has potentially lifelong consequences for a child. Perinatal infections and inflammation can induce preterm birth and unfavorable cognitive development, Thus inflammation has received enthusiastic interest for potential therapeutic approaches seeking {{to protect the}} newborn brain. Experimental evidence demonstrates that inflammation induces brain injury succeeding the initial insult. A key cytokine in brain injury is the tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α), with reported detrimental cytotoxic effects on selected neuronal populations. Nonetheless, important functions of TNF-α in cerebral homeostasis and development have also been described. Caffeine is used against apneas of prematurity, with noticeable protection against cognitive delay and cerebral palsy. The main effects of caffeine at clinically relevant doses are mediated through inhibition of adenosine receptors. Adenosine is formed from adenosine triphosphate, the main transporter of chemical energy in the cell, which is readily cleaved to adenosine upon extracellular release or extensive leakage from injured necrotic cells. Hence, adenosine signaling is tightly interrelated with local energy levels and cell injury. In addition, adenosine modulates inflammatory responses in profound ways. Methods: In mouse models of premature excitotoxic lesions and full term hypoxic ischemic brain injury we investigated blockade of TNF-α with and without interleukin IL- 1 or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced systemic inflammation. Furthermore, in the hypoxic ischemic model we developed a flow cytometry based method to investigate temporal distribution of brain infiltrating and splenetic immune cells and their activation. To analyze the data in an unbiased way, we next adapted a data driven gating methodology. Moreover, we used principal component analysis to discriminate between experimentally entangled variables. Utilizing these techniques, we explored the effect of genetic inactivation of adenosine A 1 and A 2 A receptors in the hypoxic ischemic model. We also tested the unselective, competitive adenosine receptor antagonist caffeine and assessed the effect on outcome and immune activation. Results: Blockade of TNF-α protected the brain against excitotoxic lesions in the presence but not absence of systemic inflammation. No protection was observed in the full term hypoxic ischemic model. Persistent lymphocyte activation was found {{three months after the}} lesion. Moreover, spleenocytes harvested five months after neonatal brain damage proliferated when stimulated with brain homogenate in contrast to sham operated counterparts. Adenosine A 1 receptor deficient mice acquired significantly larger infarcts and associated adverse behavioral outcome compared to wild type. There were specific alterations in the immune responses induced after brain injury, including impaired cytotoxic function and dysregulation of regulatory B-lymphocytes. Adenosine A 2 A receptor knockout mice developed increased atrophy compared to wild type after hypoxic ischemia, an effect accompanied by functional deficits in behavioral tests. Furthermore, a compensated functional insufficiency was estimated in the regulatory T- lymphocyte compartment in combination with a seemingly inadequate number of myeloid derived suppressor like cells, accompanied by a reversed, increased response in innate antigen presenting cells in the knockout. Finally, we report neuroprotective properties of 5 mg/kg caffeine given directly after neonatal brain injury. Discussion: TNF-α blockade could potentially protect against preterm excitotoxic brain injury. Only patients with concurrent systemic inflammation would potentially benefit. Moreover, concern about adverse effects exists, why TNF-α blockade for neonatal brain injury is likely not clinically applicable in the near future. Persistent long term cerebral adaptive immune activation, preceded by systemic immune activation in spleen was discovered. Remarkably, spleenocytes from animals subjected to brain injury responded to brain antigen five months after brain damage, whereas spleenocytes from uninjured did not, suggesting formation of immunological memory that might affect long term outcome and provoke autoimmunity later in life. To avoid bias from manual gating of flow cytometry data we developed a data driven approach adapted for brain infiltrating immune cells. Furthermore, we deployed principal component analysis to verify biological relevance in the pattern of immune activation and to discriminate between genotype and injury size effects, since they are experimentally inseparable. Thus we could predict genotype and whether they acquired brain injury or not, from the flow cytometric immune activation pattern alone. Adenosine A 1 receptor deficient mice display signs of regulatory <b>B-lymphocyte</b> <b>dysfunction</b> that imply a novel adenosinergic mechanism of B-lymphocyte regulation. In addition, these animals displayed signs of altered cellular cytotoxic immunity. Thus considerable effects on immune activation were present in the A 1 receptor knockouts compared to wild type, adding another mechanism linked to worse outcome after hypoxic ischemic brain injury in these animals. Deletion of the adenosine A 2 A receptor similarly causes worse outcome, however, the alteration of the immune response is completely different. Fundamental changes were observed in regulatory populations like monocyte derived suppressor like cells and regulatory T-lymphocytes. Extensive activation of cytotoxic populations in the adenosine A 2 A receptor knockout links insufficient regulatory immune function with adverse behavioral and morphological outcome. We also propose a novel hypothesis that short term blockade of adenosine A 2 A receptors offers neuroprotection whereas long term blockade is detrimental by immunological mechanisms. Thus we tested the tentative therapeutic potential of caffeine, an unselective competitive antagonist of adenosine receptors. Caffeine 5 mg/kg given directly after the insult resulted in reduced injury size after neonatal hypoxic ischemia. Since caffeine is a relatively well studied substance with negligible adverse long term effect in technically sound studies absent of significant bias, this approach has a clear clinical relevance.

40|$|AbstractHepatitis C virus (HCV) infects <b>B-lymphocytes,</b> provokes {{cellular}} <b>dysfunction</b> {{and causes}} lymphoproliferative {{diseases such as}} cryoglobulinemia and non-Hodgkin's B-cell lymphoma. In the present study, we investigated the serum levels of kappa and lambda free light chains (FLC) of immunoglobulins and the kappa/lambda FLC ratio in Brazilian patients with chronic HCV infection and cryoglobulinemia. We also analyzed the immunochemical composition of the cryoglobulins in these patients. Twenty-eight cryoglobulinemic HCV patients composed the target group, while 37 HCV patients without cryoglobulinemia were included as controls. The median levels of kappa and lambda FLC were higher in patients with cryoglobulinemia compared to controls (p= 0. 001 and p= 0. 003, respectively), but the kappa/lambda FLC ratio was similar in patients with and without cryoglobulinemia (p> 0. 05). The median FLC ratio was higher in HCV patients presenting with advanced fibrosis of the liver compared to HCV patients without fibrosis (p= 0. 004). Kappa and lambda FLC levels were strongly correlated with the IgA, IgG and IgM levels in the patients with cryoglobulinemia. In patients without cryoglobulinemia, the kappa FLC level was only correlated with the IgG level, whereas the lambda FLC were weakly correlated with the IgA, IgG and IgM levels. An immunochemical pattern of mixed cryoglobulins (MC), predominantly IgM, IgG, IgA and kappa light chain, was verified in these immune complexes. We concluded that HCV-infected patients presenting cryoglobulinemia have vigorous polyclonal B-lymphocyte activation due to chronic HCV infection and persistent immune stimulation...|$|R
