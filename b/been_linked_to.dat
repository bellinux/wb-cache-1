50|$|AP-5 is {{the most}} {{recently}} described complex, and one reason supporting {{the idea that it}} is an authentic adaptor complex is that it is associated with hereditary spastic paraplegia, as is AP-4.

5|$|The {{process of}} deep frying food is {{generally}} detrimental to its nutritional value. The oils that foods absorb in their batter typically contain {{large amounts of}} fats, especially saturated fats and trans fats. Consumption of large amounts of saturated and trans fats has <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> a higher risk for some cancers including prostate cancer.

5|$|Cabbage has <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> {{outbreaks}} of some food-borne illnesses, including Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium botulinum. The latter toxin has been traced to pre-made, packaged coleslaw mixes, while the spores {{were found on}} whole cabbages that were otherwise acceptable in appearance. Shigella species are able to survive in shredded cabbage. Two {{outbreaks of}} E.coli in the United States have <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> cabbage consumption. Biological risk assessments have concluded that there {{is the potential for}} further outbreaks linked to uncooked cabbage, due to contamination at many stages of the growing, harvesting and packaging processes. Contaminants from water, humans, animals and soil have the potential to be transferred to cabbage, and from there to the end consumer.|$|E

5000|$|If rearing with a rider <b>is</b> {{not clearly}} <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> fear, disobedience or aggression, it may <b>be</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> pain.

Another possible cause is the rate of star formation in the Milky Way. The reduced rate in star formation may <b>be</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> diminished glaciations from 1 to 2 Ga.|$|R

5|$|A few ASD {{cases have}} <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> {{exposure}} to teratogens (agents that cause birth defects) {{during the first}} eight weeks from conception. Although this does not exclude the possibility that ASD can be initiated or affected later, it is strong evidence that it arises very early in development. Many environmental factors have been hypothesized to act after birth, but none has been confirmed by scientific investigation.|$|E
5|$|A steepening of the {{subduction}} zone during the Late Miocene has <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> {{an increase in}} volcanic activity and its westward migration, but {{it is unlikely that}} the pattern of activity in the southern Puna next to the Toro fault zone can be explained through this alone. A large low velocity and low seismic attenuation anomaly is found between 20 and 24° latitude south. Some geologic evidence, including geochemistry and geographic indicators, imply that lithospheric detachment did occur beneath the southern Puna.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} of {{a significant relationship between}} systemic markers of renal and vascular function (processes <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> cardiovascular disease and its development) and retinal microvascular function in diabetes and/or cardiovascular disease. Methods: Ocular microcirculatory function was measured in 116 patients with diabetes and/or cardiovascular disease using static and continuous retinal vessel responses to three cycles of flickering light. Endothelial function was evaluated by von Willebrand factor (vWf), endothelial microparticles and soluble E selectin, renal function by serum creatinine, creatinine clearance and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). HbA 1 c was used as a control index. Results: Central retinal vein equivalence and venous maximum dilation <b>to</b> flicker <b>were</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> HbA 1 c (both p< 0. 05). Arterial reaction time <b>was</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> serum creatinine (p= 0. 036) and eGFR (p= 0. 039), venous reaction time <b>was</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> creatinine clearance (p= 0. 018). Creatinine clearance and eGFR <b>were</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> arterial maximum dilatation (p< 0. 001 and p= 0. 003 respectively) and the dilatation amplitude (p= 0. 038 and p= 0. 048 respectively) responses in the third flicker cycle. Of venous responses to the first flicker cycle, HbA 1 c <b>was</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> the maximum dilation response (p= 0. 004) and dilatation amplitude (p= 0. 017), vWf <b>was</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> the maximum constriction response (p= 0. 016), and creatinine clearance to the baseline diameter fluctuation (p= 0. 029). In the second flicker cycle, dilatation amplitude <b>was</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> serum creatinine (p= 0. 022). Conclusions: Several retinal blood vessel responses <b>to</b> flickering light <b>are</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> glycaemia and renal function, but only one index <b>is</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> endothelial function. Renal function must be considered when interpreting retinal vessel responses...|$|R
5|$|Adolf Hitler's {{sexuality}} {{has long}} been a matter of historical and scholarly debate. There is evidence that he had romantic encounters with a number of women during his lifetime, as well as evidence of his antipathy to homosexuality, and no evidence of homosexual encounters. His name has <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> a number of possible female lovers, two of whom committed suicide. Another died of complications eight years after a suicide attempt, and one made a failed suicide attempt.|$|E
5|$|An {{outbreak}} of a gastrointestinal illness in Spain which was causing mortalities in humans has <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> western jackdaws. During a post-mortem on an affected bird, a polyomavirus was {{isolated from the}} spleen. The illness {{appeared to be a}} co-infection of this with Salmonella and the virus has been provisionally named the crow polyomavirus (CPyV). Segmented filamentous bacteria have been isolated from the small intestine of a western jackdaw, although their pathogenicity or role is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Another {{issue is}} the role of {{inherited}} genetic factors in shaping attachments: for example one type of polymorphism of the gene coding for the D2 dopamine receptor has <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> anxious attachment and another in the gene for the 5-HT2A serotonin receptor with avoidant attachment. This suggests that the influence of maternal care on attachment security is not the same for all children. One theoretical basis for this is that it makes biological sense for children to vary in their susceptibility to rearing influence.|$|E
