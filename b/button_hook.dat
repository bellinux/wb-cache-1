40|$|Introduction : Assistive {{devices are}} {{prescribed}} for {{amyotrophic lateral sclerosis}} (ALS) patients with motor deficits, but {{little is known about}} their perceived benefit. Therefore, we assessed ALS patients' satisfaction with commonly prescribed devices. Methods : A telephone survey of 63 ALS patients from a single multidisciplinary clinic was conducted to assess the frequency of use, perceived usefulness, and satisfaction with 33 assistive devices. Results : Of those assistive technologies used “often or always” by ≥ 20 % of respondents, arm rails by the toilet, elevated toilet seat, shower seat, shower bars, and slip-on shoes were ranked very highly for both usefulness and satisfaction. The ankle brace for ambulation, transfer board, speaker phone, and electronic seating controls were also ranked highly. The <b>button</b> <b>hook,</b> dressing stick, and long-handled reaching tool received low ratings for both usefulness and satisfaction. Conclusions : ALS patients reported high usefulness and satisfaction levels with all bathroom adaptive devices and certain low-technology devices. Muscle Nerve, 201...|$|E

50|$|Deep River Manufacturing {{had begun}} in the 1860s as J.A. Smith & Co., a firm which made hooks and other bent-wire objects in a shop in Deep River. In 1885, the firm was bought by Henry Snell and Mathewson Potter, who used its {{equipment}} to manufacture crochet hooks, knitting needles, and <b>button</b> <b>hooks.</b> The partnership operated until 1927, when it was sold {{to one of the}} employees, but went bankrupt within a year; the eclipse of high-button shoes and gloves in fashion had largely destroyed the company's market. Ernest Prann and other local men formed the Deep River Manufacturing Company and bought the firm, but sold the company to another partnership, which included Messerschmidt, Sr., in 1929. Messerschmidt's son, Charles, Jr., who had obtained a bookkeeping certificate from Baypath Institute in 1928, was also brought into the partnership.|$|R
5000|$|In 1983, the {{building}} was purchased by the former town and the former Rural Municipality of Birtle. It officially opened as the Birdtail Country Museum on May 24, 1984, as a joint centennial project of the former town and former rural municipality. Inside are more than 4,000 artifacts related to the area, including such historical items such as the diaries of original settlers (Alfred Morton's, from 1878), <b>button</b> <b>hooks</b> for ladies' boots, and ice-saws and ice-tongs used for harvesting ice from the Birdtail River in the winter. The Museum houses the trophies awarded to Samuel Larcombe, {{one of the early}} settlers of Birtle. In 1917, Larcombe, the [...] "World Wheat King", developed a variety of rust-resistant wheat. The second floor of the Museum is set up to resemble a Victorian home. People often come to the Museum to do genealogy research through the microfilm reader, which contains every edition of the Birtle 'Eye Witness' newspaper, dating back to 1891. Local history books for the community and surrounding districts provide additional sources of information.|$|R

40|$|The United States {{market for}} {{home health care}} {{products}} is rapidly increasing; it is quite possibly the largest and fastest growing segment {{of the health care}} market, and pharmacies more commonly are becoming providers of home health care (HHC) and durable medical equipment (DME) products. Although there is no standard definition for HHC products with product categories such as DME, HME, and HHC frequently overlapping, it is still certain that the market is growing. Pharmacy and home health care sales are a natural fit. Pharmacy is valued as one of America’s most trusted professions and pharmacists, being licensed clinicians of a high educational level, allow for an ideal match of home health care (HHC) products and pharmacy. Pharmacy patrons rely upon the pharmacist’s expert knowledge of prescription and over the counter products to assist with their decision making process. The pharmacist’s knowledge of the patient and the equipment will allow the pharmacist to serve the patient effectively, meeting their health care needs. Medicare patients often rely upon their neighborhood pharmacist for their prescription and durable medical equipment (DME) needs. The combination of simplified billing, convenience of location, one stop shopping and the friendly face and knowledge of the neighborhood pharmacist make for a convenient shopping experience. Many members of the population have some form of disability at one time or another, over 6. 2 million Americans are disabled and receiving Social Security Disability Insurance. 22 Health problems often result in a lack of ability to function independently, including daily functions.

40|$|AbstractAnterior open bite is a {{malocclusion}} {{in which}} one or more teeth do not make contact with its antagonists. The malocclusion occurs in the incisors zone and can spread even to posterior teeth. Molar intrusion {{is one of the}} main treatment mechanisms, but the methods used to achieve it have been ineffective, mainly because they depend on dental structures resulting in anchorage loss. On the other hand, mini-implants are easy to place, remove and a low-cost alternative to treat anterior open bite. They are an efficient tool to provide anchorage without patient cooperation. This article explains how closure of an anterior open bite was achieved using mini-implants in the maxilla (buccal and palate area with an acrylic <b>button</b> with <b>hooks)</b> and mandible (buccal area). It aims to explain that mini-implants are efficient in causing molar intrusion because they provide more options to correct malocclusions without patient’s cooperation...|$|R

Behold! {{there she was}} risen and mounted on a stool near the washstand, with pains and difficulty inclining the ewer (which she could not lift) so as to pour its contents into the basin. It was curious to watch her as she washed and dressed, so small, busy, and noiseless. Evidently she was little accustomed to perform her own toilet; and the <b>buttons,</b> strings, <b>hooks</b> and eyes, offered difficulties which she encountered with a perseverance good to witness. She folded her night-dress, she smoothed the drapery of her couch quite neatly; withdrawing into a corner, where the sweep of the white curtain concealed her, she became still.

50|$|Modern humans started burying their dead, using animal hides to make clothing, {{hunting with}} more {{sophisticated}} techniques (such as using trapping pits or driving animals off cliffs), {{and engaging in}} cave painting. As human culture advanced, different populations of humans introduced novelty to existing technologies: artifacts such as fish <b>hooks,</b> <b>buttons,</b> and bone needles show signs of variation among different populations of humans, something {{that had not been}} seen in human cultures prior to 50,000 BP.

Like most other acoustically coupled modems, the CAT required the user to dial the desired number on a normal telephone, and then press the handset into rubber cups on the modem if a carrier could be heard.

The biggest characteristic of the player's biplane is the hook attached to its rear section.

25|$|Corsets {{are held}} {{together}} by lacing, usually (though not always) at the back. Tightening or loosening the lacing produces corresponding changes in the firmness of the corset. Depending on the desired effect and time period, corsets can be laced from the top down, from the bottom up, or both {{up from the bottom}} and down from the top, using two laces that meet in the middle. In the Victorian heyday of corsets, a well-to-do woman's corset laces would be tightened by her maid, and a gentleman's by his valet. However, Victorian corsets also had a <b>buttoned</b> or <b>hooked</b> front opening called a busk. If the corset was worn loosely, it was possible to leave the lacing as adjusted and take the corset on and off using the front opening. (If the corset is worn snugly, this method will damage the busk if the lacing is not significantly loosened beforehand). Self-lacing is very difficult with tightlacing - also called waist training - which strives for the utmost possible reduction of the waist. The type of corset and bodice lacing became a refined mark of class; women who could not afford servants often wore front-laced bodices.|$|R
