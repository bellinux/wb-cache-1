25|$|Agitational {{trains and}} ships: To expand {{the reach of}} the oral-agitation networks, the Bolsheviks pioneered using modern {{transportation}} to reach deeper into Russia. The trains and ships carried agitators armed with leaflets, posters and other various forms of agitprop. The agitational trains expanded the reach of agitators into Eastern Europe, and allowed for the establishment of agitprop stations, consisting of libraries of propaganda material. The trains were also equipped with radios, and their own printing press, so they could report to Moscow the political climate of the given region, and receive instruction on how to custom print propaganda on the spot to <b>better</b> <b>take</b> advantage of the situation.|$|E
25|$|In addition, to <b>better</b> <b>take</b> {{advantage}} of the region's pool of writers and directors, Tortorici decided to migrate Telemundo's main base of operations – transferring its programming and management divisions – from Hialeah, Florida to a new facility in Santa Monica, California in December of that year, resulting in the hiring or transfer of approximately 45 employees; more than 300 other employees continued to be based at its Hialeah offices. The changes proved to be disastrous as Telemundo's ratings for the overhauled prime time lineup sharply fell by 42% to an 8% audience share among Latino households against the telenovela-dominated lineup programmed by Univision (which held a roughly 91% share) in that slot by the February 1999 sweeps period; the network was even forced to air numerous commercials for free as part of contractual makegoods to advertisers, resulting {{in a loss of}} more than $1 million in potential revenue.|$|E

500|$|Reaction to the film's preview segment was mixed. Kotaku heavily {{praised the}} effects, {{undertone}} and music, {{stating that the}} staff loved it, though lamented that an official film of this kind would join {{a long line of}} [...] "ill-advised live-action adaptations". Game Informer called it [...] "absurd", stating that while it was a possible proof of concept film it was more likely completely fake, and adding [...] "It looks goofy as hell, and Pokéfans are sure to get a couple chuckles out of it if nothing else." [...] ComicsAlliance called it [...] "somewhere in the middle" [...] of presenting a <b>better</b> <b>take</b> on the franchise and a reminder that [...] "some intellectual properties got things right (or inherently wrong) the first time", though called the effect [...] "surprisingly competent" [...] and it both generally fun and funny. Crave Online heavily criticized the film, calling the story formulaic and the production values [...] "threadbare", and further adding that they dreaded the idea of it inspiring an actual live-action film on the series in light of Capcom's [...]|$|E
500|$|One of Young's first actions was to hire Ray Perkins as head coach. Perkins was an {{offensive}} assistant coach on the Dallas Cowboys under Hall of Fame coach Tom Landry. In his first draft, Young drafted quarterback Phil Simms from Morehead State University with the seventh overall draft pick {{to the surprise}} of many. Simms had never played on a winning team at Morehead State, and acknowledged after he was drafted that [...] "ost people have never heard of me." [...] Young was certain of the choice though saying, [...] "nce in a while {{you get a chance to}} get a guy with a great arm and great potential and you'd darn sight <b>better</b> <b>take</b> it." [...] Simms was unhappy with the selection, and had other teams which he favored playing on over the Giants. The Giants lost their first five games of the season with Joe Pisarcik starting at quarterback. Simms came on in relief of Pisarcik in the fifth game and started the next four, all of which the Giants won. They lost five out of their last seven however, finishing 6–10 for the year. They fell to 4–12 in 1980. Simms play was inconsistent, as he combined for 28 touchdowns against 33 interceptions while completing 48.8% of his passes over his first two seasons.|$|E

500|$|The King had a mixed {{relationship}} with Lord Melbourne. Melbourne's government mooted more ideas to introduce greater democracy, {{such as the}} devolution of powers to the Legislative Council of Lower Canada, which greatly alarmed the King, who feared it would eventually lead {{to the loss of}} the colony. At first, the King bitterly opposed these proposals. William exclaimed to Lord Gosford, Governor General-designate of Canada: [...] "Mind what you are about in Canada... mind me, my Lord, the Cabinet is not my Cabinet; they had <b>better</b> <b>take</b> care or by God, I will have them impeached." [...] When William's son Augustus FitzClarence enquired of his father whether the King would be entertaining during Ascot week, William gloomily replied, [...] "I cannot give any dinners without inviting the ministers, and I would rather see the devil than any one of them in my house." [...] Nevertheless, William approved the Cabinet's recommendations for reform. Despite his disagreements with Lord Melbourne, the King wrote warmly to congratulate the Prime Minister when he triumphed in the adultery case brought against him concerning Lady Caroline Norton—he had refused to permit Melbourne to resign when the case was first brought. The King and Prime Minister eventually found a modus vivendi; Melbourne applying tact and firmness when called for; while William realised that his First Minister was far less radical in his politics than the King had feared.|$|E
500|$|Biographer David Buckley wrote, [...] "While {{the music}} {{moved away from}} Murmurs {{slightly}} airless feel, the subject matter was a little darker." [...] Buck noted in a 1988 interview that water imagery was abundant in the album. Buckley interpreted that imagery as representing the change presented by the band's increasing success, {{as well as the}} changing music scene of the group's Athens, Georgia hometown. The song [...] "Camera" [...] addressed the death of a friend from Athens who died in a car crash. Easter said, [...] " [...] vocal was so exposed on that track, and because of that, it could really show any technical imperfections with regard to pitch." [...] The producer tried to get Stipe to sing a <b>better</b> <b>take,</b> but the singer was more intent on getting the feeling of the song across, and at one point refused to record further. While many of the album's songs were new compositions, some had been in R.E.M.'s show setlists for years. In particular, [...] "Pretty Persuasion" [...] and [...] "(Don't Go Back to) Rockville" [...] had been played live as far back as October 1980. The band was reluctant to record [...] "Pretty Persuasion" [...] as the members considered it too old, but Dixon and Easter convinced the group to do so. R.E.M. originally intended to release [...] "(Don't Go Back to) Rockville" [...] as a non-album single between Reckoning and its next release. When the band recorded it for the album, the group rearranged the song from its live incarnation and gave it a country music feel in tribute to its lawyer Bertis Downs, IV, who was a country fan.|$|E

2500|$|To try {{to resolve}} the H-4's {{hydrodynamic}} issues, in 1915 Porte carried {{out a series of}} experiments on four H-4s fitted with a variety of modified hulls, using the results of these tests to design a new [...] hull which was fitted to the wings and tail of an H-4, serial number 3580, with a pair of 150hp (112kW) Hispano-Suiza 8 engines as the Felixstowe F.1. [...] Rather than the lightweight boat-type structure of the Curtiss boats, the F.1's hull was based around a sturdy wooden box-girder similar to that used in contemporary landplanes, to which were attached a single-step planing bottom and side sponsons. [...] Once modified by the fitting of a further two steps, the new hull proved to give much <b>better</b> <b>take</b> off and landing characteristics and was much more seaworthy.|$|E
2500|$|In the mid-1960s, King began {{publicly}} {{criticizing the}} Bureau for giving insufficient {{attention to the}} use of terrorism by white supremacists. [...] Hoover responded by publicly calling King the most [...] "notorious liar" [...] in the United States. [...] In his 1991 memoir, Washington Post journalist Carl Rowan asserted that the FBI had sent at least one anonymous letter to King encouraging him to commit suicide. [...] Historian Taylor Branch documents an anonymous November 21, 1964 [...] "suicide package" [...] sent by the FBI that contained audio recordings of King's sexual indiscretions combined with a letter telling him [...] "There is only one way out for you. [...] You <b>better</b> <b>take</b> it before your filthy, abnormal, fraudulent self is bared to the nation." [...] And even by 1969, as has been noted elsewhere, [...] " [...] efforts to 'expose' Martin Luther King, Jr. had not slackened even though King had been dead for a year. [...] furnished ammunition to conservatives to attack King's memory, and...tried to block efforts to honor the slain leader." ...|$|E

He tells his two other brothers, [...] "You fellows go across and get that tree bark, those green trees over there." [...] He scraped off the bark and then asked X̱i7lánexw [...] if he had a bowl plate and told him to put three rocks in to boil the water. They took the bark of the willow tree, then gave it to the woman to drink. The lead brother told his younger brothers, [...] "You <b>better</b> <b>take</b> your {{grandfather}} outside", which they did while the oldest brother stayed with X̱i7lánexw 's wife. Not long after, they heard a baby's cry. He fixed the baby up and taught the woman how to take care of it, and told him about the medicine. He told the man that when he came him, that he had a baby boy. The first baby was a boy, and the next a girl. These two grew up together and married each other. The next baby was a girl, then a boy, and these did the same. This is where all the Sḵwx̱wú7mesh came from.|$|E
