25|$|When {{initially}} {{faced with}} this realization, President Eisenhower asked ARPA to consider alternative concepts. Their Project Defender studied all sorts of systems, before abandoning most of them to concentrate on Project BAMBI. BAMBI used a series of satellites carrying interceptor missiles that would attack the Soviet ICBMs shortly after launch. This <b>boost</b> <b>phase</b> intercept rendered MIRV impotent; a successful attack would destroy all of the warheads. Unfortunately, the operational cost of such a system would be enormous, and the US Air Force continually rejected such concepts. Development was cancelled in 1963.|$|E

However, the YAL-1 infrared target acquisition system was designed to detect the hot exhaust of TBMs in <b>boost</b> <b>phase.</b> Satellites and other aircraft have a much lower heat signature, making them more difficult to detect.

25|$|The launch {{from the}} {{submarine}} occurs below the sea surface. The missiles are ejected from their tubes by igniting an explosive charge {{in a separate}} container which is separated by seventeen titanium alloy pinnacles activated by a double alloy steam system. The energy from the blast is directed to a water tank, where the water is flash-vaporized to steam. The subsequent pressure spike {{is strong enough to}} eject the missile out of the tube and give it enough momentum to reach and clear the surface of the water. The missile is pressurized with nitrogen to prevent the intrusion of water into any internal spaces, which could damage the missile or add weight, destabilizing the missile. Should the missile fail to breach the surface of the water, there are several safety mechanisms that can either deactivate the missile before launch or guide the missile through an additional phase of launch. Inertial motion sensors are activated upon launch, and when the sensors detect downward acceleration after being blown out of the water, the first-stage motor ignites. The aerospike, a telescoping outward extension that halves aerodynamic drag, is then deployed, and the <b>boost</b> <b>phase</b> begins. When the third-stage motor fires, within two minutes of launch, the missile is traveling faster than 20,000ft/s (6,000m/s), or 13,600mph (21,600km/h).|$|E
40|$|Algorithm for {{identification}} {{of the characteristics of}} a missile and of its trajectory on the basis of radar measurements has been proposed. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm involves the combined use of maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) and parameters estimate as well as the use of an extended Kalman filter (EKF), a real-time method. Calculations involved missile detection from deterministic data and from measures corrupted by noise including four missile fundamental parameters and six state variables. The analytic estimate thus obtained, provided clue for the convergence of a post-processing algorithm based on the MLE method. The EKF was successfully used in the determination of the state vector that determines the trajectory in the ballistic phase. Such a combined use of batch-detection algorithms for the <b>boosted</b> <b>phase</b> and real-time detection algorithms for the ballistic and reentry phases proves to be an effective solution...|$|R

The Burya had a two-stage design - the daring concept for an intercontinental missile was the second stage, which was powered by a ramjet engine at its operational speed of Mach 3. This varied from the original Trommsdorff concept of World War II in that no mother aircraft launch preceded the rocket <b>boosted</b> <b>phase.</b> The first stage was a ballistic-rocket-derived booster, which accelerated the Burya to altitude and the speed necessary to ignite its ramjet engine: a ramjet does not operate below subsonic speeds, and to use a hybrid jet-ramjet to broaden its operating speed {{would have been more}} complex.|$|R

The overall trajectory is divided into the <b>boosted</b> <b>phase,</b> the cruise phase, the gliding phase and the terminal guidance phase. After overall consideration of the constraints and index requirements of all phases, different methods were used to optimize each phase, including the optimal angle of firing design, the design for minimizing energy loss, the optimal glide design and the terminal phase dive method, so as to optimize the overall trajectory.

We find that it outperforms some frontrunners in the field for a large variety of jet definitions and constraints, assuming topocluster-like objects instead of hadrons as seeds. The second search is tasked with identifying boosted W bosons, emitted from high virtuality quarks, thereby measuring the effects of Sudakov logarithmic enhancement under different assumptions of the systematic uncertainty. Finally, we examine the LHC's capability to measure and constrain the strength of the ttH (H->bb) channel in an extensive search of various modestly <b>boosted</b> <b>phase</b> space regions.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{investigates the}} <b>boost</b> <b>phase's</b> {{longitudinal}} autopilot of a ballistic missile equipped with thrust vector control. The existing longitudinal autopilot employs time-invariant passive resistor-inductor-capacitor (RLC) network compensator {{as a control}} strategy, which {{does not take into}} account the time-varying missile dynamics. This may cause the closed-loop system instability in the presence of large disturbance and dynamics uncertainty. Therefore, the existing controller should be redesigned to achieve more stable vehicle response. In this paper, based on gain-scheduling adaptive control strategy, two different types of optimal controllers are proposed. The first controller is gain-scheduled optimal tuning-proportional-integral-derivative (PID) with actuator constraints, which supplies better response but requires a priori knowledge of the system dynamics. Moreover, the controller has oscillatory response in the presence of dynamic uncertainty. Taking this into account, gain-scheduled optimal linear quadratic (LQ) in conjunction with optimal tuning-compensator offers the greatest scope for controller improvement in the presence of dynamic uncertainty and large disturbance. The latter controller is tested through various scenarios for the validated nonlinear dynamic flight model of the real ballistic missile system with autopilot exposed to external disturbances...|$|R

Here, we investigated the immunogenicity and relative efficacy of systemic immunization with two human ALVAC-HIV- 1 recombinant vaccines expressing Gag, Pol, and gp 120 (vCP 250) or Gag, Pol, and gp 160 (vCP 1420) in a prime-boost protocol with their homologous vaccine native Env proteins. The relative efficacy was measured against a high-dose mucosal exposure to the pathogenic neutralization-resistant variant SHIVKU 2 (simian-{{human immunodeficiency virus}}). Systemic immunization with both vaccine regimens decreased viral load levels not only in blood but unexpectedly also in mucosal sites and protected macaques from peripheral CD 4 + T-cell loss.

Inclusion of recombinant Tat protein in the <b>boosting</b> <b>phase</b> along with the Env protein did not contribute further to the preservation of CD 4 + T cells.

High thrust and density are {{appealing}} features for different applications, spanning from <b>boosting</b> <b>phase</b> to other service applications (separation, de-orbiting, orbit insertion). Aluminum is widely used as a fuel in composite solid rocket motors because metal oxidation increases enthalpy release in combustion chamber and grants higher specific impulse. Combustion process of metal particles is complex and involves aggregation, agglomeration and evolution of reacting particulate inside the core flow of the rocket. It is always stated that residence time should be enough in order to grant complete metal oxidation but agglomerate initial size, rocket grain geometry, burning rate, and other factors have to be reconsidered. New space missions may not require large rocket systems and metal combustion efficiency becomes potentially a key issue to understand whether solid propulsion embodies a viable solution or liquid/hybrid systems are better. A simple model for metal combustion is set up in this paper. Metal particles are represented as single drops trailed by the core flow and reacted according to Beckstead's model.
