40|$|International audiencePeripheral {{microvascular}} dysfunction {{has been}} described in many physiological and pathological conditions. Owing to its accessibility, the cutaneous microcirculation provides a unique index of microvascular function. Skin microvascular function has therefore been proposed as a prognostic marker or for evaluating the effect of drugs on the microcirculation. Various <b>reactivity</b> <b>tests,</b> coupled with techniques measuring skin blood flux, are used to non-invasively explore both endothelial and neurovascular microvascular functioning in humans. We review the advantages and limitations of the main <b>reactivity</b> <b>tests,</b> including post-occlusive reactive hyperemia, local thermal hyperemia, pressure-induced vasodilation, and iontophoresis of vasodilators, combined with measurement techniques such as laser Doppler and laser speckle contrast imaging. Recent advances in our comprehension of the physiological pathways underlying these <b>reactivity</b> <b>tests,</b> as well as technological developments in microcirculation imaging, have provided reliable and reproducible tools for studying the microcirculation...|$|R

40|$|Inhibition of {{platelet}} activation, aggregation {{and consequent}} thrombus formation {{is an essential}} target in primary and secondary prevention for secondary cardiovascular events (CVE). Although stronger platelet inhibitory therapy has been developed, there are still individual patients who develop a second CVE, such as stroke and myocardial infarction, while other patients develop bleeding events with the same dose of platelet inhibitors. This argues for tailored treatment strategies. Several platelet <b>reactivity</b> <b>tests</b> {{have been used to}} identify patients with high on treatment platelet reactivity, and therefore increased risk for CVE, however adjusting antiplatelet therapy based on these measurement has not yet been proven effective in large cardiology trials. Possible explanations for the lack of benefit of tailored compared to standard antiplatelet therapy may be the following: 1. The large variety of utilized platelet <b>reactivity</b> <b>tests,</b> 2. The currently available tests are not standardized and hold a poor correlation. This makes the diagnosis of ‘’high on treatment platelet reactivity " dependent of the utilized platelet <b>reactivity</b> <b>test</b> and cut-off values, 3. The present platelet <b>reactivity</b> <b>tests</b> measure the overall capacity of the platelet to form a thrombus but do not provide information about the different platelet activation pathways and -markers. 4. Potentially there is an intra-individual variability in platelet reactivity over time. The decision to continue platelet inhibitors, adjust the dosage or switch to a different antiplatelet therapy is made based on a single measurement. The optimal timing for testing should therefore be investigated. 5. Research on platelet reactivity involves mostly patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The cut-off values of high- and low platelet <b>reactivity</b> per <b>test</b> are determined on measurements of patients undergoing PCI. It remains questionable if these cut-off values can be extrapolated to patients undergoing vascular surgery. 6. Optimal antiplatelet treatment strategies are not known for all forms of vascular disease and should be investigated prior the implementation of tailored antiplatelet therapy. Overall, although the concept of ‘’tailored antiplatelet therapy " is promising, largescale clinical trials investigating this concept in vascular surgery patients are warranted...|$|R
40|$|Heart rate {{variability}} (HRV) is used {{to study}} autonomic effects on the heart. The time domain PNN 50 (percentage of consecutive RR intervals differing by> 50 %) measures high frequency in HRV primarily reflecting parasympathetic activity. The ratio of low to high frequency power (LF/HF) measured by fast Fourier analysis {{is used to}} measure sympathetic to parasympathetic balance. In adults, increased sympathetic tone {{has been found in}} hypertensive individuals. The present study was performed to look for differences in HRV by race and between subjects with high and low blood pressure (BP). Heart rate variability data was analyzed from Holter monitor recordings in 39 healthy male subjects aged 13 to 17 years (50 % white). Half were selected with Korotkoff fourth sound (K 4) DBP> 85 th percentile for height measured twice, 3 to 5 years apart (average 116 / 75 mm Hg). Half had DBP < 15 th percentile for height (average 101 / 57 mm Hg). Subjects underwent a physical examination including BP, height, and weight before cardiovascular <b>reactivity</b> <b>testing</b> including measurements taken while supine and standing, and during 20 % maximal isometric hand grip, Valsalva maneuver, and immersion of the hand in water at 4 °C. The LF/HF ratio was significantly higher and the PNN 50 was significantly lower in whites compared with ratios for blacks during all CV <b>reactivity</b> <b>tests</b> (all P <. 05).

Using transcranial Doppler sonography, we measured the rate of microemboli in 23 patients treated with flow-diverting stents. Patients received preprocedural dual antiplatelet medications and intraprocedural heparinization. Point-of-care platelet <b>reactivity</b> <b>testing</b> was performed before the procedure, and nonresponders (213 P 2 Y 12 /ADP receptor reactivity units) received additional thienopyridine. Transcranial Doppler sonography was performed within 12 – 24 hours. Microemboli were detected in 3 patients (13 %), 2 of whom were initially nonresponders. There was no association between the presence of microemboli and procedural or neurologic complications, aneurysm size, number of stents, or procedure time. Eight procedures (34. 8 %) required additional thienopyridine for inadequate platelet inhibition, and 3 required further treatment for persistent nonresponse to point-of-care platelet <b>reactivity</b> <b>testing.</b> There were 6 technical and 2 postoperative complications; none were associated with inadequate platelet inhibition or microemboli.

40|$|Standardised {{behaviour}} {{tests have}} the potential to improve equine welfare by enabling the selection of horses suitable for a particular role. A range of tests are found in scientific literature which make such claims. However, with notable exceptions, authors have failed to establish the reliability of their tests or the validity of their claims. This study aimed to determine a set of reliable behaviour tests based on those reported in literature; and to test the validity of these as predictors of horses’ suitability as police horses. Reliability of response to a novel object, social isolation and handling tests was established by tests repeated at three week intervals on 33 horses. Behavioural responses were recorded post hoc to enable the full range of responses to be measured. There was some evidence that the horses habituated to static stimuli used in the tests, and the majority of the tests were at best moderately reliable, with only <b>reactivity</b> <b>tests</b> showing good or better reliability. Tests with moderately reliable results or results which could be explained by habituation, were included in the validity testing. This compared the horses’ responses to the behavioural tests with handlers’ ratings of key aspects of police horse performance. These subjective scales of suitability of police horses were developed from interviews with instructors and yard managers. The items were combined to develop a set of specific indices of police horse roles. Spearman’s rank order correlations were used to explore whether any relationships existed between the horses’ behavioural responses to the tests and subjective ratings of their suitability for their use. The results revealed eight moderate associations which were on the whole between horses’ responses to the <b>reactivity</b> <b>tests</b> (unexpected noise and sudden moving object) and the suitability scores. These findings suggest that standardised behavioural tests are not strongly reliable. The validity analysis indicated that either the tests used in this study did not serve as predictors of suitability for use, or that behavioural responses to standardised tests cannot be generalised to the wider challenges faced by these horses in their roles. However the <b>reactivity</b> <b>tests</b> did reveal stronger reliability and they were the only measures to show any association with the suitability scores, suggesting that <b>reactivity</b> <b>tests</b> may have some validity in measuring a horse’s suitability.

40|$|Objective: Restenosis and stent {{thrombosis}} after endovascular {{intervention in}} patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) can potentially be tackled by more intensive antiplatelet therapy, such as dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) consisting of aspirin and P 2 Y 12 inhibitor. Despite clopidogrel treatment, some patients still display high platelet reactivity (HCPR). Tailored antiplatelet therapy, based on platelet <b>reactivity</b> <b>testing,</b> might overcome HCPR. However, more data are warranted regarding the proportion of patients with HCPR in the PAD population, different platelet <b>reactivity</b> <b>tests,</b> their correlation, and the optimal timing for these tests as a stepping stone for a future trial investigating the potential benefit of tailored antiplatelet therapy in PAD patients. Methods: Thirty patients on DAPT after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty underwent platelet <b>reactivity</b> <b>testing</b> by VerifyNow, vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) and platelet activation assay, and CYP 2 C 19 -polymorphism testing. Results: The proportion of patients with HCPR measured by VerifyNow varied between 43. 3 % and 83. 3 %, depending on the cut off values used. Testing within 24 hours of initiation of DAPT gave {{a higher proportion of}} HCPR than testing after more than 24 hours. According to DNA testing, 14. 8 % were CYP 2 C 19 * 2 homozygote, 22. 2 % heterozygote, and 63 % CYP 2 C 19 * 2 negative. VASP assay revealed 24 % HCPR. The highest HCPR rate was found with a VerifyNow cut off of less than 40 % inhibition, whereas the lowest HCPR rate was found with the VASP assay. There was a low correlation between the tests. Conclusion: HCPR is present in PAD patients and research on HCPR is needed in this population; timing of tests is relevant and standardisation of tests is needed.

40|$|In 2006 it was {{estimated}} by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration (SAMHSA, 2007) that 19. 9 million Americans used illicit drugs, computing to roughly 8. 0 % of the United States population. In 2007, there were 2. 1 million active cocaine users, comprising 0. 8 percent of the population. The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) estimates that the total expenditure of drug-related complications is greater than 500 billion dollars when healthcare, legal procedures and job loss are considered. Research has shown that prolonged drug use has {{a profound effect on}} the EEG recordings of drug addicts when compared to controls during cue <b>reactivity</b> <b>tests.</b> Cue <b>reactivity</b> refers to a phenomenon in where individuals with a history of drug abuse exhibit excessive psychophysiological responses to cues associated with their drug of choice. The goal of this research is to develop gamma band EEG indices to determine the effectiveness of neurofeedback therapies which are thought to offer a non-invasive method of mediating EEG abnormalities resulting from prolonged substance abuse. Method: Ten current cocaine abusers were treated using neurofeedback protocol to simultaneously increase SMR and decrease Theta activity, combined with Motivational Interviewing sessions. Eight of them completed all planned pre and post-neurofeedback cue <b>reactivity</b> <b>tests</b> with event-related EEG recording and clinical evaluations. Cue <b>reactivity</b> <b>tests</b> consisted of a visual oddball task with images from the International Affective Picture System and drug-related pictures. Evoked and induced gamma responses to target and non-target drug cues were analyzed using wavelet analysis and coherence protocols via custom algorithms implemented in MatLab. Results: Outpatient subjects with cocaine addiction completed the bio-behavioral intervention and successfully increased SMR while keeping theta practically unchanged in 12 sessions of neurofeedback training. Neurofeedback treatment resulted in a lower EEG gamma reactivity to drug-related images in a post-neurofeedback cue <b>reactivity</b> <b>test.</b> In particular, evoked gamma showed decreases in power to non-target and target drugrelated cues at all topographies (left, right, frontal, parietal, medial, inferior); while induced gamma power decreased globally to both target and non-target drug cues. Also, long range coherence was found to increase in specified electrode pairings post neurofeedback. Our findings supported our hypothesis that gamma band cue reactivity measures are sufficiently sensitive to functional outcomes of neurofeedback treatment. Both evoked and induced gamma measures were found capable of detecting changes in EEG responses to both target and non-target drug cues. Conclusion: Our study emphasizes the utility of cognitive neuroscience methods based on EEG gamma band measures for the assessment of the functional outcomes of neurofeedback-based bio-behavioral interventions for addictive disorders. This approach may have significant potential for identifying both physiological and clinical markers of treatment progress. These methodologies can also be adapted and used in additional pathologies to provide fast and reproducible evidence of treatment outcomes...|$|R
40|$|Fire {{is a major}} {{driver of}} carbon (C) and {{nitrogen}} (N) cycling in forests, releasing significant quantities of greenhouse gases, soot, and aerosols while simultaneously depositing pyrogenic organic matter (PyOM) onto forest soil. PyOM, {{the product of the}} incomplete combustion of biomass, makes up a significant portion of soil organic carbon (SOC) (~ 5 – 45 %), The condensed aromatic structure of PyOM imparts a resistance to weathering and decay thus, PyOM can persist in soil for centuries to millennia -much higher than its unpyrolyzed source material. PyOM is also able to impact the turnover of soil organic C. ^ While many studies have linked PyOM production and source material to its <b>biological</b> <b>reactivity,</b> few studies have been able to determine the stability and reactivity of well-characterized PyOM, its effect on rate of native soil C (NSC) mineralization, or the effect of weathering of PyOM on its <b>biological</b> <b>reactivity</b> in field or laboratory decay studies. Addressing these knowledge gaps are particularly important as fire frequency and intensity are expected to increase in boreal and temperate ecosystems which are vulnerable to vegetation shifts and climate change. ^ This dissertation explored the interactive effects of source taxa and charring temperature on PyOM and NSC turnover as well as the effects of photo-oxidative weathering of PyOM on microbial and fungal response in soil and single – fungal culture laboratory incubation experiments which utilized 13 C enriched wood and PyOM material to track the fate of PyOM through soil and culture medium. The resulting data show that weathered PyOM stimulated fungal respiration, enzymatic activity and increased medium C mineralization in malt – derived growth medium. Photo weathering of PyOM reduced the size of its fast cycling C pool, increased microbial oxidative enzyme activity and induced a decrease in NSC respiration rates. ^ The addition of two chemically and structurally distinct PyOM, produced at 200, 300, 450, and 600 °C, as well as its precursor wood sources, jack pine and red maple to a Northern forest soil, resulted in a net reduction in NSC mineralization, decreased fast cycling C turnover, and resulted in enzyme activities and mineralization rates that reflected the onset of thermochemical transitions (PyOM produced at 300 °C) for both taxa. These effects on the interaction of PyOM and NSC were counteracted by the presence of a labile C source, sucrose, in JP treatments. Physiochemical characteristics, specifically, low molecular weight C and thermal stability were determined to be the strongest predictors of fast cycling PyOM C mineralization and turnover of the more resistant, slow cycling PyOM C pool. These results in general indicate that PyOM physiochemical characteristics are useful predictors in determining the relative stability of PyOM and <b>biological</b> <b>reactivity</b> in soil. ...|$|R
