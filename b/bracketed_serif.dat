25|$|Old Style typefaces are {{influenced}} by early Italian lettering design. Modern fonts often exhibit a <b>bracketed</b> <b>serif</b> and a substantial difference in weight within the strokes. Though some argument exists as to whether Transitional fonts exist as a discrete category among serif fonts, Transitional fonts lie somewhere between Old Style and Modern style typefaces. Transitional fonts exhibit a marked increase in the variation of stroke weight and a more horizontal serif compared to Old Style. Slab serif designs have particularly large serifs, and date to the early nineteenth century. The earliest slab serif font, Antique, later renamed Egyptian, was first shown in 1815 by the English typefounder Vincent Figgins.|$|E
5000|$|Gill {{began work}} on Perpetua in 1925 {{at the request of}} Stanley Morison, {{typographical}} advisor to Monotype; they had met in 1913. Morison sought Gill's talent to design a new typeface for the foundry, asking for a [...] "roman letter suitable for book reading, which while being new, was to be of general utility and in no respect unusual." [...] In his memoir and assessment of Monotype's work, A Tally of Types (1953, after Gill's death), Morison claimed that he had chosen to collaborate with Gill because of an impression that previous artistically inclined typefaces cut as niche products for the private use of fine press printing companies had been too eccentric:it still remained desirable to cut…an original face which required a living artist capable of the work. There was no lack of fine calligraphers or fine printers in Britain and Germany but the possibility was remote of securing from this source a satisfactory set of drawings of a new roman and italic suitable for work of every sort…with the possible exceptions of the Doves and Golden Type, their efforts had been new and peculiar...Morison wrote that he felt that Gill as a sculptor, with a trade of work more akin to the engraving process used to sculpt the master punches traditionally used to make metal type, could succeed where these designers, mostly trained in calligraphy, had not:The finely <b>bracketed</b> <b>serif</b> with which the sculptors of the roman inscriptions dignified their alphabet is symbolic; it signified their sense of the fundamental difference between private and public writing; between script and inscription. Thus the function of the serif must be understood by the artist if his book-type is to have a chance of succeeding. The fine serif is not in origin calligraphic but epigraphic; not written but sculptured. It follows that a set of drawings of a finely serifed type by a contemporary practitioner of lettering could best be made by sculptor and Gill was the obvious man to solve it. He was asked to make drawings of the letters he had long been habitually carving.|$|E
25|$|Times Modern was {{unveiled}} on 20 November 2006, as the successor of Times Classic. Designed for improving legibility in smaller font sizes, it uses 45-degree angled <b>bracket</b> <b>serifs.</b> The font {{was published by}} Elsner + Flake as EF Times Modern; it was designed by Research Studios, led by Ben Preston (deputy editor of The Times) and designer Neville Brody.|$|R
50|$|Baroque and rococo {{aesthetic}} trends, {{use of the}} pointed-pen for writing, {{and steel}} engraving techniques effected a gradual shift in typographic style. Contrast between thick and thin strokes increased. Tilted stressing transformed into vertical stressing; full rounds were compressed. Blunt <b>bracketed</b> <b>serifs</b> grew sharp and delicate until they were fine straight lines. Detail became clean and precise.|$|R

5000|$|Clarendons have a bold, solid {{structure}}, {{similar in}} letter structure to the [...] "modern" [...] serif typefaces {{popular in the}} nineteenth century for body text (for instance showing an 'R' with a curled leg and ball terminals on the 'a' and 'c'), but bolder and with less contrast in stroke weight. Clarendon designs generally have a structure with <b>bracketed</b> <b>serifs,</b> which become larger as they reach the main stroke of the letter. Mitja Miklavčič describes the basic features of Clarendon designs (and ones labelled Ionic, often quite similar) as: [...] "plain and sturdy nature, strong <b>bracketed</b> <b>serifs,</b> vertical stress, large x-height, short ascenders and descenders, typeface with little contrast" [...] and supports Nicolete Gray's description of them as a [...] "cross between the roman body text type and slab serif model". Gray notes that nineteenth-century Ionic and Clarendon faces have [...] "a definite differentiation between the thick and the thin strokes", unlike some other more geometric slab-serifs.|$|R
2500|$|Slab serif fonts vary considerably: {{some such}} as Rockwell have a {{geometric}} design with minimal variation in stroke width: they are sometimes described as sans-serif fonts with added serifs.

50|$|Century Oldstyle was {{released}} {{at a time}} when heavier faces with <b>bracketed</b> <b>serifs</b> were returning to vogue. The faces were issued over a period of six years, all of which were designed by Benton and issued by A.T.F. Despite the name it is not purely an old-style serif font (the type of metal type used before around 1750), but retains many more modern characteristics such as its curling capital Q.|$|R
5000|$|Also called {{mechanical}}, slab serif, or mécanes, {{the name}} of this group evokes the mechanical aspect of these typefaces, which coincide with the Industrial Revolution {{at the beginning of the}} 19th century. The principal characteristics of these typefaces are a very low contrast and rectangular slab serifs. They correspond to the Egyptiennes of Thibaudeau classification. This category includes both typefaces with <b>bracketed</b> <b>serifs</b> (clarendons or ionics) and typefaces with square or unbracketed serifs (...) [...]|$|R
50|$|Slab serifs form a {{large and}} varied genre. Some such as Memphis and Rockwell have a {{geometric}} design with minimal variation in stroke width: they are sometimes described as sans-serif fonts with added serifs. Others {{such as those of}} the Clarendon genre have a structure more like most other serif fonts, though with larger and more obvious serifs. These designs may have <b>bracketed</b> <b>serifs</b> which increase width along their length before merging with the main strokes of the letters, while on geometrics the serifs have a constant width.|$|R

50|$|Humanist, {{humanistic}}, or humanes {{include the}} first Roman typefaces created during the 15th century by Venetian printers, such as Nicolas Jenson (hence {{another name for}} these, Venetian). These typefaces sought to imitate the formal hands found in the humanistic (renaissance) manuscripts of the time. These typefaces, rather round {{in opposition to the}} gothics of the Middle Ages, are characterized by short and thick <b>bracketed</b> <b>serifs,</b> a slanted cross stroke on the lowercase 'e', ascenders with slanted serifs, and a low contrast between horizontals and verticals. These typefaces are inspired in particular by the Carolingian minuscule, imposed by Charlemagne during his reign of the Holy Roman Empire.|$|R
50|$|The {{first major}} figure in English {{typography}} is reckoned by type historians to have ended the monopoly of Dutch type founding almost single-handedly. The gun engraver-turned-punchcutter William Caslon spent 14 years creating the stable of typefaces on the specimen sheet issued in 1734. The complete canon included roman, italic, Greek, Hebrew, Arabic etc. Caslon's Great Primer roman and English roman were retrogressive designs that very closely followed the Fell types {{and the roman}} of Miklós (Nicholas) Kis c. 1685 falsely attributed to Anton Janson. Like the Fells, Caslon's slightly <b>bracketed</b> <b>serifs</b> and old-style irregularity gave it a homely charm - its precise cut and perpendicularity place it firmly in the 18th century however. Caslon's italic structures follow the Fell italics, but at a condensed width and with conventional branching from stems.|$|R
5000|$|Adrian Frutiger's first {{commercial}} typeface was [...] — {{a set of}} titling capital letters with small, <b>bracketed</b> <b>serifs,</b> released in 1954. A calligraphic, informal, script face, [...] ("wave" [...] in French), also was released in 1954. In 1955, , a glyphic, old-style, serif text face was released. The typeface shows inspiration by Nicolas Jenson, and, in the [...] type, Frutiger's ideas of letter construction, unity, and organic form, are first expressed together. Raph Levien described as a [...] "Frutiger trademark" [...] his common use of an [...] "a" [...] where the loop makes a horizontal line at the top on meeting the vertical. It makes use of narrow wedge serifs, a style sometimes known as Latin which Frutiger would often use in his future serif designs. In 1956, he designed his first-of-three, slab-serif typefaces — Egyptienne, on the Clarendon model; after Univers, it was the second, new text face to be commissioned for photo-composition.|$|R
50|$|It {{was cut in}} 1911 for the {{publisher}} J. M. Dent, {{the owner of the}} Everyman's Library. It was based on another foundry-type made for this publisher. Both founts were based on an old Venetian roman type made by Nicolas Jenson. The typeface was launched in 1912 in a collection of the poems of Lorenzo De Medici which was published by Ballantyne Press.This font was also the basis for William Morris and his Golden Type. Dent admired Morris and his Golden type, and the way Morris tried to implement his ideas on printing. Dent however wanted to use machines to produce the type for his trade editions.The font Monotype produced was almost a copy of Golden Type, but with sharper slab serifs, and cleaner lines. A lighter version was produced in 1919 after the First World War, with <b>bracketed</b> <b>serifs,</b> and named Italian Old Style series 108. In 1967 the font was taken out off production and all patterns, designs and punches were destroyed. After this date no new mats could be made anymore. However, several digital fonts based on Veronese are currently available.|$|R
50|$|The roman and italic {{types of}} John Baskerville c. 1772 {{appeared}} later than Fleischman's but are considered transitional and partly retrogressive with {{a return to}} lower contrast, smooth transaxial modeling, finely modeled <b>bracketed</b> <b>serifs,</b> and long stems. The exquisite design and finish of Baskerville's roman however, combining elegance and strength, was modern. His roman design, and especially his italic, were rococo-influenced. His designs did not visibly quote any previous types. They were informed by his prior experience as a writing master and the influences of his time. The types of Joseph Fry, Alexander Wilson, and John Bell closely followed Baskerville, and through his correspondence with European type founders Baskerville's influence penetrated most of western Europe. Baskerville was a meticulous artist who controlled all aspects of his creation, devising more accurate presses, blacker inks and paper sealed with hot rollers to ensure crisp impressions. Of particular note, the lower storey of his lowercase g does not fully close. Derivatives of Baskerville are often identified thus. A modern revival of Baskerville, a font called Mrs Eaves, is named after Baskerville's wife who was the widow of Richard Eaves.|$|R

5000|$|Didone, or modern, serif typefaces, {{which first}} {{emerged in the}} late 18th century, are {{characterized}} by extreme contrast between thick and thin lines. These typefaces have a vertical stress and long and fine <b>serifs,</b> with minimal <b>bracketing</b> (constant width). <b>Serifs</b> {{tend to be very}} thin, and vertical lines very heavy. Many Didone fonts are less readable than transitional or old-style serif typefaces. Period examples include Bodoni, Didot, and Walbaum. Computer Modern is a popular contemporary example. The very popular Century {{can be seen as a}} softened version of the same basic design.|$|R
5000|$|Catherine Dixon, in a 2002 paper, criticized {{both the}} Vox and British Standard {{categories}} for favoring roman typefaces over display typefaces, which derives from {{early twentieth century}} design culture. As an example, Dixon notes that in these classification systems [...] "'humanist' types are formally distinguished from 'garalde', even though the formal differences are very subtle and such a distinction is only appropriate for very few types. But large numbers of slab serif types, clarendons or ionics (that is <b>bracketed</b> slab <b>serifs)</b> and egyptians (that is square-ended, unbracketed slab serifs) are simply grouped together." [...] Dixon challenges the prevalent focus on roman types as being dated, saying [...] "distinctions between text and display are now increasingly irrelevant, with the greater subtlety that has been introduced into sans serifs and slab serif designs, leading to a wider application of such types for text purposes." [...] Dixon's conclusion is that these systems have remained unchanged since 1967, and thus many contemporary typefaces render these systems inadequate.Miguel Catopodis, in the ATypI forum, proposed that the 1962 Vox-AtypI classification needs an upload because the schema is still a easy resource for many students to understand how typefaces could be classificated.|$|R
