40|$|The {{investigation}} {{is concerned with}} liquid radioactive discharges of the atomic power plant {{as a source of}} potential irradiation of the personnel. The aim of the study is to consider regularities of formation of radioactive contamination of water systems and formulate the requirements making it possible to ensure radiation safety of the personnel and population. The main method of {{investigation is}} mathematical simulation of the processes and check-out of the proposed mathematical models {{based on the results of}} full-scale measurements. The full-scale investigations have been performed with the use of the sample method with a subsequent measurement of samples using spectrometric and radiometric apparatus. Theoretical significance of the study consists in creation of the common concept of fixing the addmissible discharge of liquid radioactive substances. The first created concept takes into account interrelation of environmental objects, radiation environmental capacity in relation to discharges and interrelation of a man with environment as a member of the common <b>biosociety.</b> The engineering methods and package of applied programs to calculate radiation capacities and admissible discharges of radioactive substances in the surface water systems have been developed. The norms of discharges of liquid radioactive substances, method of analysis of natural conditions used when designing objects, technique for determination of admissible discharges of radioactive substances in the surface water systems have been introduced. The results of the study are used by scientific institutes in the works on radiation safety, services of radiation safety of objects in the course of the operational work, design organizations when developing projects and providing expertise in radiation safetyAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|E
40|$|The {{focus in}} this chapter is on public {{perceptions}} of science, taking biotechnology and the life sciences as an exemplar. From almost its outset in 1974, with the application to patent recombinant DNA, biotechnology has been understood as having far-reaching implications for the lives of us all. In 1975, scientists agreed at the Asilomar Conference in California to a voluntary moratorium on their research, such was the scale of their concern about the potential and unknown health and safety issues associated with this new technology. But the economic benefits of biotechnology soon became its focal point, and the moratorium was soon lifted. In 1979 a European Community report entitled The <b>Biosociety</b> described biotechnology as central to economic competitiveness in subsequent years. But even at that time, the European public was uneasy and troubled {{by the idea of}} gene technology. As Mark Cantley, then {{a senior member of the}} European Commission, wrote, ‘what the sector ignored above all was public perception... the public were learning to see gene technology, genetic engineering, biotechnology and so on as a single, vague and disquieting phenomenon’ (Cantley 1992). A Eurobarometer survey in 1979 found that 49 per cent of the European public saw genetic research as an unacceptable risk and a similar percentage thought the same about ‘synthetic food’, or what we now call GM food (Gaskell 2004). However, the early warning signals from the public went unheeded. In the 1990 s, the life sciences project, embracing medical, pharmaceutical, industrial and agri-food technologies based on recombinant DNA, took off led by European and North American multinational companies. They based their strategy on the market model of innovation, depicted in Figure 4. 1 (Gaskell 2008). Here success in the process of innovation is contingent on gaining the support of the regulators and the market forces...|$|E

40|$|The rapidly {{evolving}} biosciences increasingly {{rely on the}} analysis, {{manipulation and}} reproduction of the human body. In the health setting, novel biotechnologies offer new methods/avenues for the investigation of wellbeing and the treatment of illness, {{but they do not}} just expand the clinician’s toolbox, they increase the very scope of her work. By offering new (and formerly invisible) measures for health, they have created new categories of illhealth (ie: expanding the ways in which humans can be classified as abnormal, unhealthy, or diseased). In doing so, they contain huge marginalising potential. And they are evolving at a pace that the law cannot match. Given this, important questions arise such as: What institutions are acting in this field and what is guiding them? How is health-related research being encouraged and regulated? How does the human subject figure in the bioeconomy? What values are we claiming and vindicating under existing regulatory regimes? What values ought we be emphasising bearing in mind social needs and individual rights? The body of work that forms this submission represents five years of socio-legal research and evolving thought on the topic of how values inform the law and are operationalised through the law and legal institutions. While the publications relied on are diverse, they all pursue small facets of this value inquiry. The first theme addressed – international values and actors – is composed of three papers which explore broad internationally shared values claimed in legal instruments such as the Universal Declaration on the Human Genome and Human Rights and the Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights, and institutions such as UNESCO and the EPO. A range of values emerge from these. Papers under the second theme – human participation in health research – explore how we access and use the human body in the modern biosociety/bioeconomy, and how we might better encourage subject participation in, and equitable benefit from, the biomedical research setting. Focusing on population biobanking, it assesses who has rights in the body and what those rights are, and how the existing environment interacts with our claimed values. Papers under the third theme – encouraging stem cell research in Argentina – explore governance instruments and their significance for realising claimed or desired values. These papers are informed by original empirical work conducted in Argentina over a 24 -month period during which the Argentine government grappled with the realities of the new <b>biosociety</b> and the (perceived) need to facilitate bioscience research and medical treatment using human tissue. While these papers represent only part of the scholarship deriving from this project, they deploy new evidence on the existing environment and the way forward in that jurisdiction. As argued in the Critical Review, these publications form a broadly coherent and farranging body of interdisciplinary work which persistently questions the link between law and values and how we govern modern bioscience. While there are necessarily descriptive elements, the whole is critically analytical and normatively suggestive. In addition to summarising the aims, objectives, methodology, results and conclusions of these works, and indicating how they form a coherent body of work, the Critical Review goes further. Drawing on evolving thinking and recent scholarship, it argues for a regime less reliant on instruments and more reliant on expert institutions informed by, and charged with protecting, socio-moral values informed by the human rights paradigm...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Since first {{proposed}} in 1971, {{the theory of}} menstrual synchrony has been haunted by doubt while gaining greater public visibility. Based on a study of women living in a dormitory, biopsy-chologist Martha McClintock {{found that there was}} a greater synchronization in the date for the onset of menstruation among close friends and roommates. An analysis of newspapers, magazines and text-books alongside the scientific literature suggests that the tenacity of menstrual synchrony is because of its circulation within many heterogeneous communities where the ambiguous phenomenon acquired multiple meanings. It was simultaneously heralded as offering the first evidence of human pheromones and demonstrating how behavior regulates biological processes. This history offers an untapped lens to explore the fraught relationship between sociobiology and feminism. This relationship has primarily been understood in terms of opposition, but menstrual synchrony’s reception reveals a more complicated and intertwined story about the simultaneous growth of evolutionary and feminist psychology. The history of menstrual synchrony illustrates late twentieth-century debates over ‘the social,’when it could entail both the influence of affect-laden friendships and the biochemicals secreted from the body. <b>BioSocieties</b> advance online publication, 6 October 2014; doi: 10. 1057 /biosoc. 2014. 2...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Invasive {{species are}} the subject of much debate and attention. Social {{scientific}} ana-lyses of alien species have focused on rhetoric about invaders, arguing that the discourse about invasive species reflects how people think about nature, culture and agency. In this article, I argue for a focus not only on discourse, but also on what happens in practice in the encounter between field scientists and invasive animals. Through ethnographic fieldwork on Guadalupe Island in Mexico, I analyze both the place of islands in the Mexican nation and invasive species eradication programs as examples of ‘care of the pest’, that is, projects in which scientists carefully tend to invasive organisms in order to produce knowledge about them. This knowledge is then used against the animals to exterminate them in a ‘biology of betrayal’, and occasionally, animals are enlisted into these projects to aid scientists in eradicating fellow members of their species. This article shows how changing perceptions of the value of island ecologies affected the use of the land and the fates of the animals on Guadalupe Island as the island was variously configured as laboratory, field site and slaughterhouse. <b>BioSocieties</b> advance online publication, 12 May 2014; doi: 10. 1057 /biosoc. 2014. 13 Keywords:Mexico; science studies; ecology; invasive species; multispecies; island...|$|R
40|$|Abstract This {{article focuses}} on both the {{dissemination}} of neuroscientific knowledge and its social implications through the analysis of a television program entitled The Enigmas of the Brain hosted by an Argentinean neuroscientist. My main concern {{in this article is}} to analyze some of the discursive uses of brain talk, that is, the many ways in which brain terminology is engaged in accounts about what the brain does and how some terms are linked together {{in order to create a}} sense of brain causality in a number of heterogeneous processes. The research that led to this article follows a qualitative design. The content of the television show was transcribed and analyzed fol-lowing a content analysis strategy. This data is part of a sociological research project about the cognitive neuroscience field in Argentina. I suggest that brain talk is more about creating new words to explain and make sense of life than about communicating scientific information to a lay audience. As it is explained in the program, the purpose is to educate the public, but I argue that not in the sense of giving new information, but in the sense of producing linguistic resources that encourage the emergence of new self-narratives. <b>BioSocieties</b> advance online publication, 8 September 2014; doi: 10. 1057 /biosoc. 2014. 2...|$|R
40|$|Currently, {{autism is}} a {{widespread}} and diverse neurodevelopmental disorder that includes both severely impaired and institutionalized patients and the fairly geeky but brilliant university professor. Despite its heterogeneity, autism is often presented as a distinct nosological entity with a unifying autism essence. In this article, I {{will argue that the}} common belief about the ontological status of autism is that autism constitutes a natural kind. There are, however, two major problems with a natural kind approach in autism research. First, how can we continue to speak about autism as a distinct disease while the condition is marked by such sheer diversity of symptoms, traits, biological markers and cognitive profiles? And second, recent historical works on autism illustrate that there is something fundamentally social and historical about how autism is defined, diagnosed and treated. I will argue that the dominant natural kind approach in autism research is misguided, as autism can only be understood in relation to ideas about what kind of behavior is deviant and in need of correction or support. Furthermore, locating and maintaining autism within the biological realm of the individual obscures an array of social, cultural and psychological issues in understanding the contemporary phenomenon we call autism. <b>BioSocieties</b> (2012) 7, 410 - 432. doi: 10. 1057 /biosoc. 2012. 23; published online 29 October 201...|$|R

It {{is available from}} [URL] DOI: 10. 1017 /S 1745855208005954 Metadata only entryCurrently influential accounts of research use of human tissue depict biomedical science as operating {{in opposition to the}} norms and values of ‘the public’. Using historical analysis and empirical data from a qualitative study of 79 family members of a child with cancer, this article challenges such accounts of ‘the public’. Families of a child with cancer generally reported that they considered themselves to be members of a community united by a sense of common purpose, in which values and interests are shared and members of the community are to be trusted. The value of tissue for patients and families lay not so much in the way it embodied some essence of the self, as in the way it embedded them within the childhood cancer community. Historical analysis demonstrates that science and its broader ‘public’ are interdependent, mutually constitutive components of a culture, interacting and exchanging rhetoric and imagery relating to research and research materials, as well as the material itself. Rather than separate social worlds of ‘bioscience’ and ‘the public’, our evidence suggests that the childhood cancer community, in respect of the area of tissue banking for research, is much better conceived of as a hybrid. Understanding ‘the public’ and ‘science’ as a multiplicities helps clarify the existence of often competing views of tissue use...|$|R
40|$|One for all, all for one’. This is {{the famous}} motto from the Three Musketeers who stayed in {{solidarity}} with each other through thick and thin. In fact, the motto illustrates a centuries-old reflection on {{the relation between the}} individual and the collective. It is a political problem: how can the whole and its parts result in an act of solidarity? In this paper we will reflect on this relation by exploring the role of genomics in materializing these acts of solidarity. The advent of genomics has enabled the possibilities of increasing personalization, differentiation and risk stratification, showing one’s uniqueness to one another. What kind of solidarity will persist in a society that is obsessed by the singularisation of desires and goals, including one’s health and well-being? At the same time, genomics has enabled the individual to show its relatedness to one another (‘we all have flawed genes’). Here, genomics appeals to a commonness in a generalized humanity where everybody wants to be somebody, as a person similar to others, to be recognized for the human generality one contains (Rosanvallon, 2012). Drawing on case studies from the field of genetic discrimination and insurance in Europe, we will demonstrate how this game of comparison through genomic singularity and similarity plays off in some distinct and often surprising ways, marking out important resources for contemporary acts of solidarity. We thereby articulate the role of national and transnational state, insurance and patient advocacy actors in using genomics as an operator of solidarity - with the desire of safeguarding and/or engineering specific versions of a European polity. Genomics thus provides a unique site for understanding the overarching tension between ‘singularization’ and ‘generalization’ and its related politics of solidarity in contemporary European <b>biosocieties.</b> status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|In {{the past}} two decades, {{prescription}} drug use has grown exponentially. Increased awareness surrounding conditions such as clinical depression and attention deficit disorder {{have led to a}} biomedical response to what was once considered a psychological problem and was therefore treated with talk therapy. Drug prescriptions are now quite common. A more recent occurrence among my generation is the trend of self-medicating. The Millennial generation have started taking “study drugs” in order to work faster and more efficiently, and self medicate by taking other forms of medication for recreational or “self help” purposes. This habit has received national attention with articles appearing in prominent news outlets such as The New York Times and Time, questioning the efficacy of taking psychiatric medications and the rise of a self medicated generation. In this thesis I analyze why this is occurring in the specific context of the University of Colorado Boulder. I conducted interviews with medical professionals, doctors, a clinical psychologist, and a homeopathic specialist, to understand how their professions have engaged with prescription drugs in this generation. Furthermore, I anonymously surveyed University of Colorado Boulder students to ask about their experiences and uses of prescription pharmaceuticals. The side effects of drugs used to treat psychiatric conditions are numerous, and their benefits are touted through inconclusive science. We are entering a new era of what anthropologist Emily Martin calls the “pharmaceutical person”[1] is becoming the new norm, and no one seems to be asking why and what this could mean for our future. In this thesis I argue that students at the University of Colorado Boulder are apart of a privileged demographic that situates and justifies their pharmaceutical usage through building a collective subjectivity as consumers raised in a neoliberal economic environment.
