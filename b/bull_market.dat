5|$|Between 1999 and 2002 Brown sold 60% of the UK's gold {{reserves}} shortly before gold entered a protracted <b>bull</b> <b>market,</b> since nicknamed by dealers as Brown Bottom. The official reason for selling the {{gold reserves}} was {{to reduce the}} portfolio risk of the UK's reserves by diversifying away from gold. The UK eventually sold about 395 tons of gold over 17 auctions from July 1999 to March 2002, at an average price of about US$275 per ounce, raising approximately US$3.5billion. By 2011, that quantity of gold would be worth over $19 billion, leading to Brown's decision to sell the gold being widely criticised.|$|E

40|$|This study investigates how limit orders affect {{liquidity}} in {{a purely}} order-driven futures market. Additionally, the possible asymmetric relationship between market depth and transitory volatility in <b>bull</b> and bear <b>markets</b> {{and the effect}} of institutional trading on liquidity provision behavior are examined as well. The empirical results demonstrate that subsequent market depth increases as transient volatility increases in <b>bull</b> <b>markets.</b> Market depth exhibits significantly positive relationship to subsequent transient volatility in <b>bull</b> <b>markets.</b> Additionally, although trading volume positively influences transient volatility in <b>bull</b> <b>markets,</b> no such relationship exists in bear markets. Liquidity provision decreases when institutional trading activity intensifies during bear markets. Thus, liquidity provision for limit orders differs between <b>bull</b> and bear <b>markets.</b> Copyright (c) 2009 The Authors Journal compilation (c) 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractSince {{the opening}} of China’s {{securities}} market, {{there have been a}} number of bull and bear cycles. This paper discusses how executives use the market timing approach to manage earnings in different cycles to maximize firm value. We find that Chinese listed companies choose to release more earnings during <b>bull</b> <b>markets</b> and this phenomenon is more evident in companies that are more profitable and have higher valuations. We also find that executives who do not release more earnings during <b>bull</b> <b>markets</b> are more likely to be dismissed...|$|R
40|$|Through this research, we {{find that}} the {{asymmetric}} volatility phenomenon is reversed in the Shanghai Stock Exchange during <b>bull</b> <b>markets.</b> That is, volatility increases more with good news than with bad news. This evidence is inconsistent with the US markets. Further examination of this phenomenon reveals that the positive impact of good news on volatility is driven by the return-chasing behaviour of investors during <b>bull</b> <b>markets.</b> We also find that volatility increases after stock price declines in bear markets. After controlling for liquidity shifts, we observe similar patterns in volatility in both <b>bull</b> and bear <b>markets.</b> We posit that institutional and behavioural factors are the major driving forces of observed volatility patterns in the Chinese stock market. 19 page(s...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} effect of {{investor}} sentiment on the London stock market {{on a daily basis}} over the period 1899 to 2010. We use a broad mix of reporting from the Financial Times as our proxy for investor sentiment. The main contribution of this paper is threefold. First, newspaper commentary, which was sentiment-laden, but information-light, in the Financial Times affects returns. Second, we find evidence that sentiment plays a role in propagating price movements, particularly during <b>bull</b> <b>markets.</b> Third, we find little evidence that {{the effect of}} sentiment on the market differs in bear versus <b>bull</b> <b>markets...</b>|$|R
25|$|When {{stocks are}} rising (a <b>bull</b> <b>market),</b> {{the belief that}} further rises are {{probable}} gives investors an incentive to buy (positive feedback—reinforcing the rise, see also stock market bubble and momentum investing); but the increased price of the shares, and the knowledge {{that there must be}} a peak after which the market falls, ends up deterring buyers (negative feedback—stabilizing the rise).|$|E

40|$|There is no {{previous}} research on the dating of bull and bear cycles in the Norwegian stock market. Even for the U.

S. and Norway from 1914 to 2016. <b>Bull</b> and bear <b>markets</b> are identi ed using a formal dating method. We divide our datasets into two sub-periods, {{to account for the}} robustness of our results. We nd that <b>bull</b> <b>markets</b> are longer and bear markets are shorter in the U. S. compared to Norway. We perform a structural break analysis and nd a major break in the growth rate in the U. S. and the Norwegian stock market. We see that the dominance of <b>bull</b> <b>markets</b> are almost identical for the U. S. and Norway post-structural break. Additionally, we test the return di erences between the rst (last) six months and the remaining months of <b>bull</b> and bear <b>market</b> states. These tests reveal evidence that returns are greater (smaller) in the rst (last) six months than the remaining for all <b>bull</b> and bear <b>markets,</b> except Norwegian bear markets. Finally, we test the investor overreaction hypothesis on the <b>bull</b> and bear <b>market</b> amplitude and nd that the dynamics of the U.

Writer Michael Lewis noted that Brooks's outrage at the new speculative excesses of the 1960s marked the end of an era.|$|E
25|$|Corporate {{transactional}} events generally {{fit into}} three categories: distressed securities, risk arbitrage, and special situations. Distressed securities include such events as restructurings, recapitalizations, and bankruptcies. A distressed securities investment strategy involves {{investing in the}} bonds or loans of companies facing bankruptcy or severe financial distress, when these bonds or loans are being traded at a discount to their value. Hedge fund managers pursuing the distressed debt investment strategy aim to capitalize on depressed bond prices. Hedge funds purchasing distressed debt may prevent those companies from going bankrupt, as such an acquisition deters foreclosure by banks. While event-driven investing in general tends to thrive during a <b>bull</b> <b>market,</b> distressed investing works best during a bear market.|$|E

40|$|Testing {{duration}} {{in stock}} markets concerns {{the ability to}} predict the turning points of bull and bear cycles. The Weibull renewal process {{has been used in}} previous studies to analyze duration dependence in economic and financial cycles. A goodness-of-fit test, however, shows that this model does not fit data from U. S. stock market cycles. As a solution, this study fits the modulated power law process that relies on less restrictive assumptions. Moreover, it measures both the long term properties of <b>bull</b> and bear <b>markets,</b> such as the tendency of the cycles to become shorter (or longer), as well as the short term effects, such as duration dependence. The results give evidence of negative duration dependence in all samples of <b>bull</b> <b>markets</b> and evidence of positive duration dependence in complete, peacetime and post WWII samples of bear markets. There is no evidence of any structural change in duration dependence after WWII in either <b>bull</b> or bear <b>markets.</b> The results show that <b>bull</b> and bear <b>markets</b> tend to get progressively shorter, but for <b>bull</b> <b>markets</b> this trend has accelerated since WWII whereas for bear markets this trend has decelerated since WWII. Goodness-of-fit tests suggest that the modulated power is a suitable model for U. S. stock market cycles...|$|R
25|$|A {{private equity}} fund say for example, ABC Capital II, borrows $9bn from a bank (or other lender). To this it adds $2bn of equity – money from its own {{partners}} and from limited partners (pension funds, rich individuals, etc.). With this $11bn it buys all the shares of an underperforming company, XYZ Industrial (after due diligence, i.e. checking the books). It replaces the senior management in XYZ Industrial, and {{they set out to}} streamline it. The workforce is reduced, some assets are sold off, etc. The objective is to increase the value of the company for an early sale. The stock market is experiencing a <b>bull</b> <b>market,</b> and XYZ Industrial is sold two years after the buy-out for $13bn, yielding a profit of $2bn. The original loan can now be paid off with interest of say $0.5bn. The remaining profit of $1.5bn is shared among the partners. Taxation of such gains is at capital gains rates. Note that part of that profit results from turning the company around, and part results from the general increase in share prices in a buoyant stock market, the latter often being the greater component.|$|E
