However, because it is less dense than air, helium is less effective at shielding the weld than argonwhich is denser than air. It also can lead to arc stability and penetration issues, and increased spatter, due to its much more energetic arc plasma. Helium is also substantially more expensive than other shielding gases.

The <b>gases</b> considered were <b>base</b> <b>gases</b> of nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen, helium, neon, argon, carbon dioxide, ammonia, and methane and 22 gas mixtures {{composed of the}} <b>base</b> <b>gases.</b> Enthalpies ranged from 2. 3 to 116. 2 MJ/kg, pressures ranged from 0. 001 to 100 atmospheres, and the wall temperatures were 300 and 1111 K. A general equation for the stagnation-point {{convective heat}} transfer in <b>base</b> <b>gases</b> and gas mixtures was derived and {{is a function of}} the mass fraction, the molecular weight, and a transport parameter of the <b>base</b> <b>gases.</b> The relation compares well with present boundary-layer computer results and with other analytical and experimental results.

40|$|A {{low-cost}} {{chemical sensor}} comprising surface mount {{light emitting diodes}} (LEDs) has been developed for colorimetric <b>based</b> <b>gas</b> detection. The device consists {{of a pair of}} LEDs connected to a simple PIC microcontroller circuit, and in most basic form requires the use of only 2 I/O pins on the chip.

The surface mount diodes employed are more compact than standard LEDs, and are more amenable to coating by solid-state sensor films.
