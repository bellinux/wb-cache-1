5|$|Joyce {{returned}} to Dublin in mid-1909 with George, {{to visit his}} father and work on getting Dubliners published. He visited Nora's family in Galway and liked Nora's mother very much. While preparing to return to Trieste {{he decided to take}} one of his sisters, Eva, back with him to help Nora run the home. He spent a month in Trieste before returning to Dublin, this time as a representative of some cinema owners and businessmen from Trieste. With their backing he launched Ireland's first cinema, the Volta Cinematograph, which was well-received, but fell apart after Joyce left. He {{returned to}} Trieste in January 1910 with another sister, Eileen, in tow. Eva became homesick for Dublin and returned there a few years later, but Eileen spent {{the rest of her life}} on the continent, eventually marrying Czech <b>bank</b> <b>cashier</b> Frantisek Schaurek.|$|E
5|$|The couple {{moved to}} Drumcondra in October 1919, where Thomas {{found a job}} as a <b>bank</b> <b>cashier.</b> The job did not pay well, but the two managed on his meagre wages. In early 1920, they moved to Grove Road in the Rathmines district, and Brendan was born in October. Soon afterwards, Brendan and his mother were nearly killed when caught in the cross-fire between the controversial, mostly British {{temporary}} constables employed by the Royal Irish Constabulary—Black and Tans—and the Irish Republican Army (IRA). In 1921, Brendan's brother Raymond was born, followed by sisters Clare and Monica, and a brother, Kevin. The household was somewhat split over religious and political issues. Their father was a teetotaller and a strict Catholic. Their mother, however, encouraged the elder brothers to adopt a more liberal leaning in life. Brendan was educated at Synge Street and Marlborough Street. At 10, Brendan showed a keen interest in sport, particularly rugby.|$|E

5000|$|In 1694 the Bank of England was established, almost {{immediately}} the Bank started to issue notes {{in return for}} deposits. The crucial feature that made Bank of England notes a means of exchange was the promise to pay the bearer {{the sum of the}} note on demand. This meant that the note could be redeemed at the Bank for gold or coinage by anyone presenting it for payment; if it was not redeemed in full, it was endorsed with the amount withdrawn. These notes were initially handwritten on Bank paper and signed by one of the <b>Bank’s</b> <b>cashiers.</b>|$|R

The Jewish <b>bank</b> <b>cashier</b> Alex Tucholsky had married his cousin Doris Tucholski in 1887 and had three children with her: Kurt, their oldest son, Fritz and Ellen. Tucholsky's relationship with his mother was strained throughout his life; he had a more harmonious relationship with his father, who, however, died in 1905, during Kurt's youth. Alex Tucholsky left a considerable fortune to his wife and children, which enabled his oldest son to go to university without any financial worries.|$|E
25|$|Because Watertown, New York was {{expanding}} in {{the early}} nineteenth century, businessmen there needed greater access to local capital. In 1816, Jabez Foster and others successfully petitioned the legislature to establish the Jefferson County Bank. Foster was chosen to help apportion stock and choose the building location, which was a contentious matter because each community in the area wanted the bank to be located there. The bank ended up being built in Adams, New York, and was initially capitalized with $50,000.00, of which half the amount was paid in. However, the bank did not fare financially well in Adams. Pursuant to an act passed on November 19, 1824, the bank relocated to Watertown and the capital fund was increased to $80,000.00. Foster served as the second bank president (1817–1819). Orville, who often followed the lead of his brother-in-law, served as the <b>bank</b> <b>cashier</b> (1820–1833) and later as president (1834–1845). Throughout the entire nineteenth century, the bank, nationally chartered in 1865, never defaulted on its obligations and from 1824 paid its shareholders regular dividends. To put its growth in perspective: in 1821 it had resources of $91,000.00; by January 1, 1916, it had resources of $3,000,000.00. In 1916, Orville's grandson, Orville E. Hungerford, was vice-president of the bank.|$|E
500|$|Tangled Lives [...] is a 1910 American silent short drama {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The plot focuses on, John Hill, a <b>bank</b> <b>cashier</b> who decides to fakes his death after the manager finds his accounts are short. Before he can go through with the plan, a reporter interviews the wife, May, and decides to suppress the story because he has become infatuated with her.

As he attempts to leave he accidentally falls to his death and the reporter removes his body before he leads May to the altar. The film was described as a variant of Enoch Arden by one reviewer, but it differs in its execution. The cast and credits of the film are unknown, but a surviving film still shows the principal characters. The film was released on September 13, 1910, to positive reviews. The film is presumed lost.|$|E
50|$|Farmers Bank of Fredericksburg, {{also known}} as The National Bank of Fredericksburg, is a {{historic}} bank building located at Fredericksburg, Virginia. It was built in 1819-20, and is a -story, rectangular red-brick building in the Federal style. It features a slate-covered front gable roof with a lunette window in the front pediment, wide cornice, three pairs of brick chimneys, and engaged pedestal columns with full entablature on the front facade.

Another director was James Hurley, who was known by his foundational donations for the city's Hurley Hospital. The bank's first president was Charles T. Bridgman, and Wilder served as the cashier. Mathew Davison later succeeded Wilder as the <b>bank's</b> <b>cashier.</b> Later, George H. Durand and William F. Stewart joined the Board of Directors. Paterson and W. H.

5000|$|On September 7, 1876, Northfield {{experienced}} one of {{its most}} important historical events, when The James-Younger Gang attempted a robbery on the First National Bank of Northfield. Local citizens, recognizing what was happening, armed themselves and resisted the robbers and successfully thwarted the theft. The gang killed the <b>bank's</b> <b>cashier,</b> Joseph Lee Heywood and a Swedish immigrant, Nicholas Gustafson. A couple of members of the gang were killed in the street, while Cole, Bob and Jim Younger were cornered near Madelia, Minnesota. Jesse and Frank James escaped west into the Dakotas, while the remaining gang members were killed or taken into custody. Considering the James gang as related to postwar insurgency, the raid has sometimes been called the last major event of the American Civil War. One of Northfield's slogans is [...] "Jesse James Slipped Here", based on the raid's failure.|$|R

On the day of their wedding, John is attracted to {{the house where the}} ceremony is to take place. Hearing of the many rich gifts which the bride has received, he enters the house, and witnesses a love scene between the young reporter and his (John's) wife. He finds it impossible to escape by the way he entered, and attempts to leave by the floor window, falls to the ground and is killed. Here Hastings finds him, and has the body carried away, and leads May to the altar." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Bank of Avilla was {{the target}} of a {{successful}} armed robbery on May 18, 1932 by members of the notorious [...] "Irish O'Malley Gang", which also resulted in the kidnapping of the cashier. [...] The O'Malley Gang were typical Depression-era outlaws who had merged with another group of thugs known as the [...] "Ozark Mountain Boys". On that Wednesday in 1932, the <b>bank</b> <b>cashier</b> Mr. Ivy E. Russell was robbed at gunpoint inside the bank by two men. [...] He was then kidnapped and driven toward Carthage, Mo, where he was tossed {{out of the car and}} left by the roadside. [...] One of the culprits was a [...] "sawed-off shotgun wielding gangster" [...] named Jack Miller, who drove the getaway car. It is not known if the undisclosed amount was ever recovered, and records do not show if or how bank customers were reimbursed (notes and deposits were not insured at this time). [...] After a lengthy spree of bank hold-ups, store robberies and murders throughout the Midwest, all of the O'Malley Gang were eventually captured. [...] Some gang members were killed or found dead, and [...] one was sentenced to a seventy-five year prison term for the Avilla bank robbery. [...] Additional facts about the crime can be pieced together through various computerized data sources, some of which include: archived editions of the Miami Daily News Record (Oklahoma) dated May 19, 1932, and from The Joplin Globe dated Oct 8, 1939. In 1938 Frank Layton and Jack Miller were pulled over by police in Arkansas, and were charged with violating the 1934 National Firearms Act (because of Jack's sawed-off shotgun). [...] This in turn became part of a famous landmark Second Amendment case known as [...] "The Miller Case" [...] and United States v. Miller. [...] Jack Miller himself was murdered one month prior to the Supreme Court's decision. [...] Jack's bullet-riddled body turned up on the bank of Spencer Creek in Rogers County, Oklahoma.|$|E

2500|$|Contracts between {{companies}} and third parties, however, {{may turn out}} to be unenforceable on ordinary principles of agency law if the director or employee obviously exceeded their authority. As a general rule, third parties need not be concerned with constitutional details conferring power among directors or employees, which may only be found by laboriously searching the register at Companies House. In general, if a third party acts in good faith, then any contract, even one going beyond the constitutional authority of the director or employee with whom they strike a deal, is valid. However, if it would appear to a reasonable person that a company employee would not have the authority to enter an agreement, then the contract is voidable at the company's instance so long as there is no equitable bar to rescission. The third party would have a claim against the (probably less solvent) employee instead. First, an agent may have express actual authority, in which case there is no problem. Her actions will be attributed to the company. Second, an agent may have implied actual authority (also sometimes called [...] "usual" [...] authority), which falls within the usual scope of the employee's office. Third, an agent may have [...] "apparent authority" [...] (also called [...] "ostensible" [...] authority) as it would appear to a reasonable person, creating an estoppel. If the actions of a company employee have authority deriving from a company constitution in none of these ways, a third party will only have recourse for breach of an obligation (a warrant of authority) against the individual agent, and not to the company as the principal. The Companies Act 2006 section 40 makes clear that directors are always deemed to be free of limitations on their authority under the constitution, unless a third party acting in callous bad faith takes advantage of a company whose director acts outside the scope of authority. For employees down the chain of delegation, it becomes less and less likely that a reasonable contracting party would think big transactions will have had authority. For instance, it would be unlikely that a <b>bank</b> <b>cashier</b> would have the authority to sell the bank's Canary Wharf skyscraper.|$|E

60|$|So Martin thought, and {{he thought}} further, till it dawned upon him that the {{difference}} between these lawyers, officers, business men, and <b>bank</b> <b>cashiers</b> he had met {{and the members of the}} working class he had known was on a par with the difference in the food they ate, clothes they wore, neighborhoods in which they lived. Certainly, in all of them was lacking the something more which he found in himself and in the books. The Morses had shown him the best their social position could produce, and he was not impressed by it. A pauper himself, a slave to the money-lender, he knew himself the superior of those he met at the Morses'; and, when his one decent suit of clothes was out of pawn, he moved among them a lord of life, quivering with a sense of outrage akin to what a prince would suffer if condemned to live with goat-herds.|$|R
