40|$|People can {{perceive}} misfortunes as {{caused by}} previous bad deeds (immanent justice reasoning) or resulting in ultimate compensation (ultimate justice reasoning). Across two studies, we investigated {{the relation between}} these types of justice reasoning and identified the processes (perceptions of deservingness) that underlie them for both others (Study 1) and the self (Study 2). Study 1 demonstrated that observers engaged in more ultimate (vs. immanent) justice reasoning for a "good" victim and greater immanent (vs. ultimate) justice reasoning for a "bad" victim. In Study 2, participants' construals of their <b>bad</b> <b>breaks</b> varied {{as a function of}} their self-worth, with greater ultimate (immanent) justice reasoning for participants with higher (lower) self-esteem. Across both studies, perceived deservingness of <b>bad</b> <b>breaks</b> or perceived deservingness of ultimate compensation mediated immanent and ultimate justice reasoning respectively. © 2014 Harvey and Callan...|$|R

40|$|Research on <b>breaking</b> <b>bad</b> {{news has}} {{extensively}} utilized undergraduates medical students, and physicians. No {{studies have examined}} how, or whether, psychologists are trained to <b>break</b> <b>bad</b> news and their current practice of <b>breaking</b> <b>bad</b> news. The purpose of this mixed method {{study was to explore}} the training and practices of psychologists in <b>breaking</b> <b>bad</b> news. Particular attention was paid to whether theory related to the “MUM effect” could explain the findings, and whether psychologists are being taught practical skills related to <b>breaking</b> <b>bad</b> news. ^ Results suggested that psychologists are more reluctant to <b>break</b> <b>bad</b> news than good news and support the existence of the “MUM” effect in a sample of psychologists. Anxiety was shown to moderate the <b>breaking</b> of <b>bad</b> news, with more anxious respondents being more reluctant, due to their concern for self/other and norms. Half the sample broke bad news at least monthly, indicated that they break diverse types of bad news, and that they received little training in <b>breaking</b> <b>bad</b> news. Psychologists also indicated that <b>breaking</b> <b>bad</b> news was an important skill to have and a need for training in this area. ^ The qualitative portion of the study examined the reluctancy of respondents in more detail. Reluctant respondents most frequently cited concern for self/others, context, and norms as the reasons. In contrast, respondents who were not reluctant to <b>break</b> <b>bad</b> news most frequently cited their concern for the recipient and experience as reasons. Both groups were asked about the positive/negative effects of <b>breaking</b> <b>bad</b> news and most indicated that it leads to intervention (+), positive coping (+), emotional distress (+) and it changes the therapeutic relationship (+ and −). Alternatively, the positive/negative effects of not <b>breaking</b> <b>bad</b> news were that the recipient is better off/keeps them safe (+), endangers the recipient/communicator (−), maintains denial (−), maintains unrealistic expectations (−), and changes the therapeutic relationship (−). Implications and suggestions for training and practices for <b>breaking</b> <b>bad</b> news are discussed. ...|$|R

6000|$|The address, [...] "Dear friend," [...] {{was written}} over {{something}} else {{which had been}} rubbed out, but beyond this the letter ran fluently and uninterruptedly along in a hand which had a business-like directness and distinctness. [...] "I don't know," [...] the writer said, [...] "as you expected to hear from me, and I don't know as I expected to let you, but circumstances alter cases, and I just wanted to drop you a line {{and tell you that}} I have been in Pymantoning and seen your mother. She is looking prime, and younger than ever. We had a long talk about old times, and I told her what a mistake I made. Confession is good for the soul, they say, and I took a big dose of it; I guess I confessed pretty much everything; regular Topsey style. Well, your mother didn't spare me any, and I don't know but what she was about right. The fact is, a man on the road don't think as much about his p's and q's as he ought as long as he is young, and if I made a <b>bad</b> <b>break</b> in that little matrimonial venture of mine, I guess it was no more than I deserved to. I told your mother just how I happened to meet you again, and how the sight of you was enough to make another man of me. I was always a little too much afraid of you, or it might have turned out different; but I can appreciate a character like yours, and I want you to know it. I guess your mother sized it up about right when I said all I asked was to worship you at a distance, and she said she guessed you would look out for the distance. I told her you had, up to date. I want you to understand that I don't presume on anything, and if we seemed to have a pretty good time after the theatre, the other night, it was because you didn't want to spoil Mrs. Montgomery's fun, and treated me well just because I was a friend of hers. Well, it's pretty hard to realize that my life is ruined, and that I have got nobody but myself to thank for it, but I guess that's what I've got to come to, sooner or later. It's what your mother said, and I guess she was right; she didn't spare me a bit, and I didn't want her to. I knew she would write to you, as soon as I was gone, and tell you not {{to have anything to do}} with me; and if she has, all I have got to say is, all right. I have been a bad lot, and I don't deny it, and all I can ask now, from this time forward, is to be kept from doing any more mischief. I don't know as I shall ever see you again; I had a kind of presentiment I shouldn't, and I told your mother so. I don't know but I told a little more about how kind you were to me the other evening than what the facts would justify exactly, but as sure as you live I didn't mean to lie about it. If I exaggerated any, it was because it seemed the greatest thing in the world to me, just to talk to you, and be where I could see you smile, and hear you laugh; you've got a laugh that is like a child's, or an angel's, if angels laugh. I've heard of their weeping, and if you knew my whole life, I think you would shed a tear or two over me. But that is not what I am trying to get at; I want to explain that if I appeared to brag of being tolerated by you, and made it seem any thing more than toleration, it was because it was like heaven to me not to have you give me the grand bounce again. And what I want to ask you now, is just to let me write to you, every now and then, and when I am tempted to go wrong, anyways--and a business life is full of temptations--let me put the case before you, and have you set me right. I won't want but a word from you, and most part of the time, I shall just want to free my mind to you on life in general, and won't expect any answer. I feel as if you had got my soul in your hands, and you could save it, or throw it away. That is all. I am writing on the train, and I have to use pencil. I hope you'll excuse the stationery; it's all the porter could get me, and I'm anxious to have a letter go back to you at once. I know your mother has written to you, and I want to corroborate everything she says against me." ...|$|E

40|$|Although {{the human}} {{tendency}} to make self-serving attributions is well-documented, not all behaviors and cognitions are primarily self-serving. Victims blame themselves for uncontrollable circumstances and individuals derogate themselves {{to maintain a}} sense that the world is just. Callan and colleagues (2014) found that random negative outcomes result in lowered self-esteem, increased perceptions that one deserves bad outcomes, and spurred self-detrimental behaviors. How might these self-defeating processes be explained? I examined whether such processes might serve to maintain a broader sense of coherence that allows the experience of life as meaningful. Participants (N = 1199) wrote about past <b>bad</b> or good <b>breaks,</b> or daily activities, and then rated self-esteem, deservingness of bad outcomes, and meaning in life and coherence. I found no support for the prediction that self-esteem would negatively relate (or deservingness of bad outcome beliefs would positively relate) to meaning in life following reminders of <b>bad</b> <b>breaks.</b> Some evidence emerged suggesting that self-esteem was less strongly related to coherence in the good breaks condition compared to controls. Exploratory analyses examined the role of depression in processes involved in the experience of life as meaningful. The manipulation had stronger effects on meaning in life in participants experiencing depressive symptoms compared to those who were not. Furthermore, self-esteem was more strongly related to meaning in life in individuals experiencing some depression compared to the non-depressed participants, especially in the <b>bad</b> <b>breaks</b> condition. Implications for this work regarding the study of meaning in life and future directions regarding this research question are discussed...|$|R
40|$|AIMS: To {{explore the}} {{difficulties}} experienced by nurses and healthcare professionals when {{engaging in the}} process of <b>breaking</b> <b>bad</b> news BACKGROUND: The challenges faced by staff when <b>breaking</b> <b>bad</b> news have previously been researched in relation to particular settings or subjects. This study involved staff from diverse settings and roles to develop broader insights into the range of difficulties experienced in clinical practice. DESIGN: The study used a descriptive survey design involving self-reported written accounts and framework analysis. METHODS: Data were collected using a structured questionnaire containing a free text section that asked participants to describe a difficult experience they had encountered when involved {{in the process of}} <b>breaking</b> <b>bad</b> news. Data were collected from healthcare staff from hospital, community, hospice and care home settings attending training days on <b>breaking</b> <b>bad</b> news between April 2011 - April 2014. FINDINGS: Multiple inter-related factors presented challenges to staff engaging in activities associated with <b>breaking</b> <b>bad</b> news. Traditional subjects such as diagnostic and treatment information were described but additional topics were identified such as the impact of illness and care at the end of life. A descriptive framework was developed that summarises the factors that contribute to creating difficult experiences for staff when <b>breaking</b> <b>bad</b> news. CONCLUSION: The framework provides insights into the scope of the challenges faced by staff when they engage in the process of <b>breaking</b> <b>bad</b> news. This provides the foundation for developing interventions to support staff that more closely matches their experiences in clinical practice. This article is protected by copyright.
