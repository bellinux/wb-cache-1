500|$|In August 2013, after Joss Whedon, {{director}} of , announced that Hank Pym {{would not be}} Ultron's creator, Wright said Ultron was never {{a part of the}} story of Ant-Man, explaining that [...] "just to sort of set up what Ant-Man does is enough for one movie". Wright described Ant-Man as a stand-alone film but said it would fit into to the larger continuity of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, explaining, [...] "I like to make it standalone <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> premise of it needs time. I want to put the crazy premise of it into a real world, which is why I think Iron Man really works because it's a relatively simple universe; it's relatable. I definitely want to go into finding a streamlined format where you use the origin format to introduce the main character and further adventures can bring other people into it." [...] Wright also stated that pre-production for Ant-Man would begin in October and filming would begin in 2014. The next month, Disney moved the film's release date up to July 31, 2015.|$|E
500|$|On December 12, 2007, Keyes {{participated in}} the Des Moines Registers Republican presidential debate, {{televised}} nationwide by PBS and the cable news networks. This {{was the first major}} presidential debate in which Keyes participated during the 2008 election season and the last Republican debate before the Iowa Caucuses. Although Keyes was not listed on the latest national CNN poll leading up to the debate, he registered with at least 1 percent of the Iowa vote in order to participate. During the debate, after the moderator began to ask a question of Texas Congressman Ron Paul, Keyes insisted he was not getting fair treatment. He interrupted the debate moderator at one point, saying that she had not called on him in several rounds and that he had to make an issue of it. He went on the offensive against his opponents during the debate, criticizing Rudy Giuliani's pro-choice position, as well as Mitt Romney's recent change in position on the same subject. In answering a question about global warming, he continued his criticisms of other candidates, saying, [...] "I'm in favor of reducing global warming, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> most important emission we need to control is the hot air emission of politicians who pretend one thing and don't deliver". He also advocated ending the income tax, establishing state-sanctioned prayer in public schools, and abolishing abortion. Toward the end of the debate, Keyes stated he could not support Giuliani if he were to win the nomination due to the former New York mayor's position on abortion.|$|E

2500|$|In a November 2010 {{interview}} with Larry King, Bush {{was asked about}} former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin. Bush remarked, [...] "I {{sat next to her}} once, thought she was beautiful, and I think she's very happy in Alaska, and I hope she'll stay there." [...] Palin responded, [...] "I don't want to, sort of, concede that we {{have to get used to}} this kind of thing, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> majority of Americans don't want to put up with the blue-bloods– and I say it with all due respect, because I love the Bushes– but, the blue-bloods, who want to pick and choose their winners, instead of allowing competition to pick and choose the winners." ...|$|E
2500|$|During a 2011 {{interview}} with London Evening Standard, Monáe {{said that she}} [...] "only dates androids", a reference to her musical alter-ego found in many of her songs. She also said, [...] "I speak about androids <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> android represents the new 'Other'. You can compare it to being a lesbian or being a gay man or being a black woman... what I want is for people who feel oppressed or feel like the 'Other' {{to connect with the}} music and to feel like, 'She represents who I am.'" [...] She added that she would talk about her sexual orientation [...] "in due time". In 2013, Monáe stated that she wants both men and women to [...] "still be attracted to [...] " [...] and expressed support for the LGBTQ community.|$|E
2500|$|Immediately {{after the}} speech MSNBC host Chris Matthews admitted, [...] "I {{have to tell}} you, a little chill in my legs right now. That is an amazing moment in history right there. It is surely an amazing moment. A keynoter like I have never heard." [...] He added later in the night, [...] "...I have seen the first black {{president}} there. And the reason I say that is <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> immigrant experience combined with the African background, combined with the incredible education, combined with his beautiful speech, not every politician gets help with the speech, but that speech {{was a piece of}} work." [...] Commenting the next day, Pat Buchanan, while complimentary towards Obama, was more critical of what he called a centrist speech: [...] "He is hiding what he truly believes. What does Obama believe about this war?" [...] On PBS, columnist David Brooks responded positively, [...] "This is why you go to conventions, to watch a speech like this," [...] while Mark Shields said, [...] "A star is born." ...|$|E
5000|$|When {{asked about}} his {{position}} on Arnold Schoenberg and atonal music, Jersild stated:" ... <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it's kind of putting things upside down to begin with theory and then make music.

I find atonal music hard to follow, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>the</b> results do not {{suggest that it is}} a good approach. [...] " ...|$|R

60|$|DEAR MADAM,--I know I {{ought to}} respect my duty and perform it, but I am weak and faithless where boys are concerned, and I can't help {{secretly}} approving pretty bad and noisy ones, though I do {{object to the}} kind that ring door-bells.

40|$|The pacifism of {{constitution}} Article 9 is {{a constitutional}} fundamental principle, but the interpretation is competed for intensely. In addition, {{it is expected}} in future that constitution Article 9 is revised. Particularly, the biggest focus about the interpretation of constitution Article 9 is whether the right to collective self-defense should be accepted. Therefore, in this article, I survey the interpretation of constitution Article 9 and consider whether we should accept the right to collective self-defense legally. <b>Because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>the</b> right to collective self-defense should not be accepted, I want to prove it legally...|$|R

5|$|I will confess {{up front}} that I love Anonymous, but not <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> they're <b>the</b> heroes. Like Alan Moore's {{character}} V who inspired Anonymous {{to adopt the}} Guy Fawkes mask as an icon and fashion item, you're never quite sure if Anonymous is the hero or antihero. The trickster is attracted to change {{and the need for}} change, and that's where Anonymous goes. But they are not your personal army – that's Rule 44 – yes, there are rules. And when they do something, it never goes quite as planned. The internet has no neat endings.|$|R
60|$|Do {{you think}} that the {{sculpture}} in the British Museum should be in the same building with the pictures in the National Gallery, that is to say, making an application of your principle to that particular case?--Yes, certainly; I think so for several reasons--chiefly <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> taste of the nation can only be rightly directed by having always sculpture and painting visible together. Many of the highest and best points of painting, I think, can only be discerned after some discipline of the eye by sculpture. That is one very essential reason. I think that after looking at sculpture one feels the grace of composition infinitely more, and one also feels how that grace of composition was reached by the painter.|$|E
60|$|To {{all these}} things one must bring a {{personal}} conscience {{and be prepared to}} examine particular cases. The excuses I have made, for example, for a very broad churchman to stay in the Church might very well be twisted into an excuse for taking an oath in something one did not to the slightest extent believe, in order to enter and betray some organization to which one was violently hostile. I admit that there may be every gradation between these two things. The individual must examine his special case and weigh the element of treachery against the possibility of co-operation. I do not see how there can be a general rule. I have already shown why in my own case I hesitate to profess a belief in God, <b>because,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>the</b> misleading element in that profession would outweigh the advantage of sympathy and confidence gained.|$|E
6000|$|... 23. While I myself {{hold this}} professorship, I shall direct you in these {{exercises}} very definitely to natural history, and to landscape; {{not only because}} in these two branches I am probably able to show you truths which might be despised by my successors: but <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> vital and joyful study of natural history quite the principal element requiring introduction, not only into University, but into national, education, from highest to lowest; and I even will risk incurring your ridicule by confessing one of my fondest dreams, that I may succeed in making some of you English youths like better {{to look at a}} bird than to shoot it; and even desire to make wild creatures tame, instead of tame creatures wild. And for the study of landscape, it is, I think, now calculated to be of use in deeper, if not more important modes, than that of natural science, for reasons which I will ask you to let me state at some length.|$|E
2500|$|In May 2003, {{the band}} {{went into a}} studio in Woodstock, New York with Rob Schnapf again on production. While Craig Nicholls had talked of having a highly {{produced}} album, he told the Australian edition of Rolling Stone in March 2004 that they decided to stick to a less-is-more philosophy. [...] "I {{wanted it to be}} – in my head – something grand, with big ideas and that vision sort of thing.

50|$|Another key finding {{concerned}} {{the dominance of}} institutional over market determinants of wage differentiation, strongly supportive of the traditional, though largely forgotten, argument of industrial relations specialists against labor economists and, in a similar vein, of the inability of labor economics to explain the domestic division of paid and unpaid labor. For me, as a one-time economist, these are among our most satisfying findings <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>the</b> principal responsibility {{of the social sciences}} today is to challenge and undermine the scientific pretensions of neoclassical economics, to show it up as the vacuous and pernicious ideology that it is.|$|R
6000|$|... 164. Mr. Kinnaird. In your experience, in {{the last}} few years, have you not seen a very marked {{improvement}} in the working classes in this country in every respect to which you have alluded; take the last twenty years, or since you have turned your attention that way?--I have no evidence before me in England of that improvement, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>the</b> struggle for existence becomes every day more severe, and that, while greater efforts are made to help the workman, the principles on which our commerce is conducted are every day oppressing him, and sinking him deeper.|$|R
60|$|I {{have just}} {{received}} your letter, Ma, from Carson--the {{one in which}} you doubt my veracity about the statements I made {{in a letter to}} you. That's right. I don't recollect what the statements were, but I suppose they were mining statistics. I have just finished writing up my report for the morning paper, and giving the Unreliable a column of advice about how to conduct himself in church, and now I will tell you a few more lies, while my hand is in. For instance, some of the boys made me a present of fifty feet in the East India G. and S. M. Company ten days ago. I was offered ninety-five dollars a foot for it, yesterday, in gold. I refused it--not <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> claim is worth a cent for I don't but because I had a curiosity to see how high it would go, before people find out how worthless it is. Besides, what if one mining claim does fool me? I have got plenty more. I am not in a particular hurry to get rich. I suppose I couldn't well help getting rich here some time or other, whether I wanted to or not. You folks do not believe in Nevada, and I am glad you don't. Just keep on thinking so.|$|E
60|$|I have {{therefore}} ventured, at {{the risk}} of giving to some passages the appearance of irreverence, to take the higher line of argument wherever it appeared clearly traceable: and this, I would ask the reader especially to observe, not merely because I think it the best mode of reaching ultimate truth, still less <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> subject of more importance than many others; but because every subject should surely, at a period like the present, be taken up in this spirit, or not at all. The aspect of the years that approach us is as solemn as it is full of mystery; and the weight of evil against which we have to contend, is increasing like the letting out of water. It is no time for the idleness of metaphysics, or the entertainment of the arts. The blasphemies of the earth are sounding louder, and its miseries heaped heavier every day; and if, {{in the midst of the}} exertion which every good man is called upon to put forth for their repression or relief, it is lawful to ask for a thought, for a moment, for a lifting of the finger, in any direction but that of the immediate and overwhelming need, it is at least incumbent upon us to approach the questions in which we would engage him, in the spirit which has become the habit of his mind, and in the hope that neither his zeal nor his usefulness may be checked by the withdrawal of an hour which has shown him how even those things which seemed mechanical, indifferent, or contemptible, depend for their perfection upon the acknowledgment of the sacred principles of faith, truth, and obedience, for which it has become the occupation of his life to contend.|$|E
60|$|Now I take it we retain enough {{realism and}} common sense not to wish to {{transfer}} these complicated conventions and compromises to a land of such ruthless logic and such rending divisions. We may hope to reproduce our laws, {{we do not want}} to reproduce our legal fictions. We do not want to insist on everybody referring to Mr. Peter or Mr. Paul, as the honourable member for Waddy Walleh; because a retiring Parliamentarian has to become Steward of the Chiltern Hundreds, we shall not insist on a retiring Palestinian official becoming Steward of the Moabitic Hundreds. But yet in much more subtle and more dangerous ways we are making that very mistake. We are transferring the fictions and even the hypocrisies of our own insular institutions from a place where they can be tolerated to a place where they will be torn in pieces. I have confined myself hitherto to descriptions and not to criticisms, to stating the elements of the problem rather than attempting as yet to solve it; <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> danger is rather that we shall underrate the difficulties than overdo the description; that we shall too easily deny the problem rather than that we shall too severely criticise the solution. But I would conclude this chapter with one practical criticism which seems to me to follow directly from all that is said here of our legal fictions and local anomalies. One thing at least has been done by our own Government, which is entirely according to the ritual or routine of our own Parliament. It is a parliament of Pooh Bah, where anybody may be Lord High Everything Else. It is a parliament of Alice in Wonderland, where the name of a thing is different from what it is called, and even from what its name is called. It is death and destruction to send out these fictions into a foreign daylight, where they will be seen as things and not theories. And knowing all this, I cannot conceive the reason, or even the meaning, of sending out Sir Herbert Samuel as the British representative in Palestine.|$|E

3000|$|Finally, {{learners}} {{understood the}} need to make assumptions and approximations because estimation does not require precision, but speed, and that the assumptions and approximations should be reasonable so that they do not cause large errors in the estimate.
