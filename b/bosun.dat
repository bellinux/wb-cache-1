5|$|The Sea Wolf, {{released}} in 1941, {{was based on}} Jack London's novel. Although the film had a strong cast and production, Rossen's re-draft of the script may be the greatest influence on the film. While the character of Captain Larsen remained both victim and oppressed in a capitalist hierarchy, he {{became a symbol of}} fascism. He split the novel's idealist hero into an intellectual <b>bosun</b> and a rebellious seaman. Warner Bros. cut many political points during production.|$|E
5|$|The Tortoise Club {{is open to}} the 1st Summer VIII and 1st Torpid (as well {{as their}} {{respective}} coxwains), but does not extend to the Boat Club committee's <b>Bosun</b> (boatswain), Secretary, or Treasurer unless they are also 1st VIII, 1st Torpid, or coxwains to those boats. The unique emblem of the Tortoise Club is the tortoise badge. The College of Arms' narrative should not be misunderstood to imply use of the Tortoise emblem by the general Oriel College Boat Club membership or members of the Oriel Society – these have their own appropriate emblematic devices.|$|E
5|$|The {{crew members}} on the fore-mast {{initially}} reached {{an agreement with the}} Malagasy: the crew's lives were to be spared on condition that they sailed Meermin back to Madagascar; but this truce broke down, as a result of which most of those crew members were also killed, and all were thrown overboard. The crew in the gunroom were short of food and drink; Muller decided that they should attempt to regain control of Meermin. Neither Muller nor Gulik took part in the attack, as both were wounded. It was led by <b>bosun</b> Laurens Pieters; twelve crewmen left the gunroom, shooting as they went. Pieters and another of the attack party were killed on deck; the rest retreated back to the gunroom, where another crewman, who had been severely wounded, later died.|$|E

25|$|The Tupolev Tu-14 (NATO {{reporting}} name: <b>Bosun)</b> (USAF/DOD reporting name: Type 35), was a Soviet twin-turbojet light bomber {{derived from}} the Tupolev Tu-73, the failed competitor to the Ilyushin Il-28 'Beagle'.

25|$|The {{largest group}} of seven {{military}} and civilian reconnaissance pilots on Polikarpov R-5 biplanes, based in Primorsky Krai, was led by Kamanin (he later grounded one of the pilots for insubordination). The group sailed from Vladivostok 2 March 1934, disembarked at Olyutorka and landed at Vankarem airfield 1 April. Kamanin and Vasily Molokov flew from a temporary base in Vankarem settlement to the ice camp, saving 34 and 39 survivors. On their first flight from the ice camp, R-5 (designed as a two-seater) carried a crew of two, plus two men from Chelyuskin in the hull. The next flights added makeshift wing gondolas, carrying two more men per mission. Other pilots from the Kamanin team hauled them from Vankarem to Providence Bay seaport. The ice camp was completely evacuated 13 April 1934; Kamanin returned with the ship's <b>bosun</b> and eight riding dogs.|$|E
60|$|It {{was plain}} {{to me that}} the pair of them, spineless and spunkless, were afraid of the men they were {{supposed}} to boss. And the men! Dore could never have conjured a more delectable hell's broth. For the first time I saw them all, and I could not blame the two <b>bosuns</b> for being afraid of them. They did not walk. They slouched and shambled, some even tottered, as from weakness or drink.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh dear, oh dear," [...] Mr. Pike lamented. [...] "How can one {{drive with}} <b>bosuns</b> {{like that and}} a crew like that? Just the same, if I was captain of this ship I'd drive 'em.

It'll be both watches all the time, which will weaken them just that much the faster." ...|$|R
50|$|The Sea Cadets {{have three}} classes of {{offshore}} vessels, {{all of which}} are capable of coastal/offshore passage making. Sea Cadet voyages normally last for 1 week, with cadets gaining RYA qualifications for their voyage. Individual Sea Cadet units also have various boats including MOD motor boats such as Vikings, Champs, Dories, dinghies called the ASC (Admiralty Sailing Craft) and <b>Bosuns,</b> in addition to vessels designed specifically for the SCC such as the Trinity 500 rowing boat and RS Quest dinghy. Also on loan from the MOD, canoes, kayaks and windsurfing equipment.|$|R
25|$|The {{island is}} {{a focal point}} for seabirds of various species. Eight species or {{subspecies}} of seabirds nest on it. The most numerous is the red-footed booby, which nests in colonies, using trees on many parts of the shore terrace. The widespread brown booby nests on the ground {{near the edge of the}} seacliff and inland cliffs. Abbott's booby (listed as endangered) nests on tall emergent trees of the western, northern and southern plateau rainforest, the only remaining nesting habitat for this bird in the world. Another endangered and endemic bird, the Christmas frigatebird, has nesting areas on the northeastern shore terraces. The more widespread great frigatebirds nest in semi-deciduous trees on the shore terrace, with the greatest concentrations being in the North West and South Point areas. The common noddy and two species of <b>bosun</b> or tropicbirds, with their brilliant gold or silver plumage and distinctive streamer tail feathers, also nest on the island.|$|E
500|$|Little {{is known}} about the ship's career other than that she was laid up each winter when the Gulf of Finland froze. On 21 July 1875, the monitor [...] ran aground and Strelets was sent to aid her the {{following}} day. While assisting with the rigging of a hawser between Admiral Chichagov and the armored frigate , it unexpectedly slid across Streletss deck, injuring the ship's executive officer and a <b>bosun,</b> who later died of his wounds. Coal and equipment from Admiral Chichagov was transferred to Strelets to lighten the former, but it was not enough to refloat her.|$|E
500|$|Hayward {{was born}} in New York City on November 15, 1908 one of eight {{children}} of Charles Brian and Rosa Hayward, née Valdetaro. As a youngster, he was a batboy for the New York Yankees. In May 1925, {{he dropped out of}} high school at Loyola School and enlisted in the United States Navy by lying about his age, which at the time he believed to be only 15, and forging his father's signature on the papers. He soon acquired the nickname [...] "Chick" [...] from a <b>bosun</b> who asked [...] "And how in did a little chick like you get in here amongst all these grown men?" [...] The nickname would remain with him for the rest of his naval career.|$|E
60|$|Certainly, {{from what}} I had read, no ship {{of the old}} days ever {{proceeded}} so sadly and blunderingly to sea. Ere long Mr. Mellaire joined Mr. Pike in the struggle of directing the men. It was not yet eight in the evening, and all hands were at work. They {{did not seem to}} know the ropes. Time and again, when the half-hearted suggestions of the <b>bosuns</b> had been of no avail, I saw {{one or the other of}} the mates leap to the rail and put the right rope in the hands of the men.|$|R
5000|$|The ships {{overall length}} is 55 m and its beam 9 m. The hull is welded steel with a teak deck. The main mast is 33 m tall and, when fully rigged, the ship carries over 810 m2 of sails. A full crew {{consists}} of 55 people, consisting of 5 permanent crew, up to 10 volunteers (including four watch leaders, a <b>bosuns</b> mate, cooks mate and purser), and 40 trainees. The watch leaders {{take control of}} the four watch groups and lead the trainees through activities and ship duties on voyages of five days and more.|$|R
60|$|A {{considerable}} body of men {{was walking}} around with the windlass or variously engaged on the forecastle-head. Of the crew proper were two watches of fifteen men each. In addition were sailmakers, boys, <b>bosuns,</b> and the carpenter. Nearly forty men were they, but such men! They were sad and lifeless. There was no vim, no go, no activity. Every step and movement was an effort, {{as if they were}} dead men raised out of coffins or sick men dragged from hospital beds. Sick they were--whiskey-poisoned. Starved they were, and weak from poor nutrition. And worst of all, they were imbecile and lunatic.|$|R
500|$|On 20 July 1870, Admiral Chichagov {{struck a}} {{sandbank}} near Koivisto at full speed. While not damaged in the incident, {{she was very}} firmly stuck and, {{an attempt by the}} armored frigate [...] pull her off failed two days later when the hawser snapped. The Russians started to off-load coal and equipment onto the low deck of the [...] in preparation for another attempt. While rigging another hawser aboard Strelets, it moved unexpectedly, badly injuring the ship's executive officer and a <b>bosun,</b> who later died of his injuries. The subsequent attempt by Sevastopol also failed, so several barges and a floating crane were summoned from Kronstadt the next day. As much weight as possible was transferred to the barges, including her forward guns, and she was successfully pulled free on 25 July. Admiral Chichagov was not damaged in the incident.|$|E
2500|$|The {{boatswain}} {{works in}} a ship's deck department as the foreman of the unlicensed (crew members without a mate's licence) deck crew. [...] Sometimes, the boatswain is also a third or fourth mate. A <b>bosun</b> must be highly skilled in all matters of marlinespike seamanship required for working on deck of a seagoing vessel.

They made me anchor in the outer roads and told me to heave out my dead. There was some tall buryin' about that time, Mr. Pathurst, and they went overboard without canvas, coal, or iron. They had to. I had nobody to help me, and the Chinks below wouldn't lift a hand.|$|R
50|$|During a heavy {{snowstorm}} on 20 April, at 2:30am she {{ran into}} a reef two miles to the northwest of Banff. Her crew threw shot overboard and fired guns of distress. However, there was a heavy swell and she filled with water within 10 minutes. Although she soon was bilged, her crew took to the boats and were saved. The subsequent court martial on her loss sentenced Widgeons pilot, Alexander Layell, to six months incarceration in the Marshalsea Prison and to be fined all pay due to him. Elliot had ordered Layell to remain at least four miles from shore throughout the night. Instead, Layell had gone below, leaving a <b>bosuns</b> mate in charge, who had let Widgeon drift towards the shore.|$|R
40|$|Using a large, individual-level wage data set, {{we examine}} the impact of a major {{technological}} innovation — the development of powerful and economical steam engines — on skill demand and the wage structure among the merchant marine. Our data reveal a complex range of responses to the new technology. The new technology created a new demand for skilled workers, the engineers, while destroying other skills relevant only to sail. There were also contradictory effects among the less skilled. On the one hand, technological innovation may have been deskilling for production work since many experienced able-bodied seamen were replaced by laborers in the engine room. On the other hand, able-bodied seamen employed on steam earned a premium relative to their counterparts on sail. Our data allow us to identify this steam premium as a skill premium rather than a compensating differential. At the managerial level, we identify a skill premium on steam for mates, whose job became more complex on the larger vessels, but not for <b>bosuns</b> whose job did not. In aggregate, there is little change traditional measures of the skill premium, but such measures are too crude to illuminate the rich wage dynamics induced by a major technical innovation. steam power, wage inequality, skill premium, technical change, merchant marine, Canada...|$|R

2500|$|The word {{boatswain}} {{has been}} in the English language since approximately 1450. It is derived from late Old English batswegen, from bat (boat) concatenated with Old Norse sveinn (...) , meaning a young man, apprentice, a follower, retainer or servant.
