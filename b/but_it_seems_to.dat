5|$|Abnormalities in the ARH gene, {{also known}} as LDLRAP1, were first {{reported}} in a family in 1973. In contrast to the other causes, two abnormal copies of the gene are required for FH to develop (autosomal recessive). The mutations in the protein tend to cause {{the production of a}} shortened protein. Its real function is unclear, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> {{play a role in the}} relation between the LDL receptor and clathrin-coated pits. People with autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia tend to have more severe disease than LDLR-heterozygotes but less severe than LDLR-homozygotes.|$|E
5|$|Grissom may not ask {{to take on}} {{the role}} of mentor, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> happen naturally, going {{all the way back to}} Sara Sidle when they first met in San Francisco, then Nick Stokes and Greg Sanders in Vegas. Although he can be annoyed with his protégés at times, he is visibly proud when they succeed, as Greg did by passing his field test and {{becoming}} a CSI. He is also protective of his staff and defends them as much as he can, as seen in episode 521 ("Rashomama") for example.|$|E
5|$|As the {{electrons}} pass through this complex, four protons are pumped from the matrix into the intermembrane space. Exactly how this occurs is unclear, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> involve conformational changes in complex I {{that cause the}} protein to bind protons on the N-side of the membrane and release them on the P-side of the membrane. Finally, {{the electrons}} are transferred from the chain of iron–sulfur clusters to a ubiquinone molecule in the membrane. Reduction of ubiquinone also contributes to the generation of a proton gradient, as two protons are taken up from the matrix as it is reduced to ubiquinol (QH2).|$|E

5|$|Early in 1940, Steinbeck and Ricketts hired a Monterey Bay sardine fishing boat, the Western Flyer, with a four-man crew, {{and spent}} six weeks {{travelling}} {{the coast of}} the Gulf of California collecting biological specimens. Along with Ricketts and the four crew members mentioned in the book, Steinbeck was accompanied by his wife, Carol. Steinbeck hoped that the trip would help rescue their failing marriage, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have had the opposite effect: the marriage ended soon after they returned. Steinbeck's lawyer and friend, Toby Street, was also on board as far as San Diego.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} {{on the history}} of bughouse, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have {{developed}} in the early 1960s. It is now quite popular as a diversion of regular chess in local chess clubs throughout Europe and the US. Grandmasters such as Joel Benjamin, Yasser Seirawan, Andy Soltis, John Nunn, Jon Speelman, Sergey Karjakin, Michael Adams, Emil Sutovsky and Michael Rohde have been known to play the game. One of the strongest matches on record took place following the 2014 Sinquefield Cup, with Magnus Carlsen and Maxime Vachier-Lagrave teaming up against Fabiano Caruana and Levon Aronian – all four being among the top ten chess players in the world at the time.|$|E
5|$|Tensions {{between the}} Welsh and the English persisted and spilled over in 1400 with the {{outbreak}} of the Glyndŵr Rising. It is uncertain what part the castle played in the conflict, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have survived intact. In 1416, the castle passed through Isabel le Despenser in marriage to her first husband Richard de Beauchamp, the earl of Worcester, and then to her second husband, Richard Beauchamp, the earl of Warwick. Isabel and her second husband invested heavily in the castle, conducting repairs and making it suitable for use as their main residence in the region. The castle passed to Richard Neville in 1449 and to Jasper Tudor, the earl of Pembroke, in 1486.|$|E

5|$|There is no {{consensus}} about how effectively the edict was enforced. Supposedly, inflation, speculation, and monetary instability continued, and a black market arose to trade in goods forced out of official markets. The edict's penalties were applied unevenly across the empire (some scholars believe they were applied only in Diocletian's domains), widely resisted, and eventually dropped, perhaps {{within a year of}} the edict's issue. Lactantius has written of the perverse accompaniments to the edict; of goods withdrawn from the market, of brawls over minute variations in price, of the deaths that came when its provisions were enforced. His account may be true, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> modern historians exaggerated and hyperbolic, and the impact of the law is recorded in no other ancient source.|$|E
5|$|Another form of {{acoustic}} communication is the headslap. This typically starts with an {{animal in the}} water elevating its snout and remaining stationary. After some time, the jaws are opened sharply then clamped shut with a biting motion that makes a loud slapping sound, and this is immediately followed by a loud splash, after which the head may be submerged and copious bubbles produced. Some species then roar, while others slap the water with their tails. Episodes of headslapping spread through the group. The purpose varies, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> be associated with maintaining social relationships, and is also used in courtship. Dominant individuals may also display their body size while swimming at the water surface, and a subordinate will submit by holding its head at an acute angle with the jaws open before retreating underwater.|$|E
25|$|The (1,2) and (3,4) bonds {{can also}} be formed from N-substituted α-aminoketones and formamide with heat. The product will be a 1,4-disubstituted {{imidazole}}, but here since R1 = R2 = hydrogen, imidazole itself is the product. The yield of this reaction is moderate, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> {{be the most effective}} method of making the 1,4 substitution.|$|E

25|$|The {{mechanism}} behind increasing HDL is {{not totally}} understood <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> {{be done in}} various ways. Niacin increases apolipoprotein A1 levels due to anti catabolic effects resulting in higher reverse cholesterol transport. It also inhibits HDL hepatic uptake, down-regulating production of the cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP) gene. Finally, it stimulates the ABCA1 transporter in monocytes and macrophages and up-regulates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ results in reverse cholesterol transport.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the theft from his worksite, he also stole from other tombs. He stole from the tomb of a workman {{by the name of}} Nakhtmin and stole his bed, possibly a stele, and other unnamed objects. He also stole a (mummified or model) goose from the funeral of the daughter of Ramesses II and later swore that he had not. In fact, he had a propensity towards exploring tombs in general, as Amennakht accuses him of entering three tombs, presumably to steal goods, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have had an element of rebelliousness to it, as he also sat on the sarcophagus of Seti II, a great sign of disrespect to both Seti II and the institution of kingship in Egypt.|$|E
25|$|No {{sooner had}} he {{published}} his theological lectures (the Theologia Summi Boni) than his adversaries {{picked up on}} his rationalistic interpretation of the Trinitarian dogma. Two pupils of Anselm of Laon, Alberic of Rheims and Lotulf of Lombardy, instigated proceedings against Abelard, charging him with the heresy of Sabellius in a provincial synod held at Soissons in 1121. They obtained through irregular procedures an official condemnation of his teaching, and Abelard was made to burn the Theologia himself. He was then sentenced to perpetual confinement in a monastery other than his own, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have been agreed in advance that this sentence would be revoked almost immediately, because {{after a few days}} in the convent of St. Medard at Soissons, Abelard returned to St. Denis.|$|E

25|$|The {{first attempt}} to model the {{distribution}} of galaxies with a fractal pattern was made by Luciano Pietronero and his team in 1987, and a more detailed view of the universe’s large-scale structure emerged over the following decade, {{as the number of}} cataloged galaxies grew larger. Pietronero argues that the universe shows a definite fractal aspect over a fairly wide range of scale, with a fractal dimension of about 2. The fractal dimension of a homogeneous 3D object would be 3, and 2 for a homogeneous surface, whilst the fractal dimension for a fractal surface is between 2 and 3. The ultimate significance of this result is not immediately apparent, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> indicate that both randomness and hierarchal structuring are at work on the scale of galaxy clusters and larger.|$|E
25|$|Opinions differ {{about exactly}} {{how and where}} Combined Action originated, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have started in August 1965 as a unit drawn from 3rd Battalion, 4th Marines, under LtCol William W. Taylor in the Phu Bai(3/4) area. 3/4’s TAOR {{included}} six villages and an airfield in a ten square mile area. The unit was overextended, and Taylor's executive officer, suggested that they incorporate local militia units into 3/4's operations. Taylor sent the plan to COL E. B. Wheeler, Commanding Officer (CO) of the 4th Marine Regiment, who forwarded it to the III Marine Amphibious Force (IIIMAF) and Fleet Marine Forces Pacific (FMFPAC). Major General Lew Walt and Lieutenant General Victor Krulak, both of whom had fought in the Banana War, saw the potential value and agreed to the proposal. GEN Nguyen Van Chuan, the local Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) CO, gave Walt control of the Vietnamese platoons near Phu Bai.|$|E
25|$|A Gin Pennant {{means that}} the wardroom is {{inviting}} officers from ships in company to drinks. The origins of the Gin Pennant are uncertain, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have been used since the 1940s and probably earlier. Originally {{it was a small}} green triangular pennant measuring approximately , defaced with a white wine glass, nowadays the gin pennant is a Starboard pennant defaced with a wine or cocktail glass. Its colour, size and position when hoisted were all significant as the aim was for the pennant to be as inconspicuous as possible, thereby having fewer ships sight it and subsequently accept the invitation for drinks. The Gin Pennant is still in regular use by Commonwealth Navies, such as the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). Within the RAN it is common practice, whilst in port, for junior officers of one ship to attempt to raise the Gin Pennant on the halyard of another ship, thereby forcing that ship to put on free drinks for the officers of the ship that managed to raise the pennant. If, however the junior officers are caught raising the pennant, then it is their ship that must put on free drinks within their Wardroom. Usually this practice is restricted to Commonwealth Navies; however, prior to increased force protection, RAN officers have successfully raised the Gin Pennant on a number of units in the USN.|$|E

500|$|The Madinat al-Fath (...) was {{intended}} to be a major city furnished with palaces and mosques, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have fallen well short of the ambitions of its founder, the Almohad caliph Abd al-Mu'min, {{by the time it was}} captured by the Kingdom of Castile in 1309 after a short siege. Muslim control was restored in 1333 after another, much longer, siege. The city subsequently underwent a major expansion and refortification. A number of buildings and structures from this period still exist, including the Moorish Castle, parts of the Moorish walls, a bath-house and a subterranean reservoir.|$|E
500|$|She met a young poet, Nikolay Gumilev, on Christmas Eve in 1903. Gumilev, {{encouraged}} her to write and pursued her intensely, making numerous marriage proposals starting in 1905.

[...] She soon became known in St Petersburg's artistic circles, regularly giving public readings.
