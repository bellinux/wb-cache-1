The sphere and anvil are in contact with each other and rest along the straight line joining their centers. When the free-side end of the anvil undergoes the normal collinear impact by travelling around the bar, the impact load transmitted into the sphere adjacent to the anvil is theoretically analyzed by a motion equation and Hertz's contact theory.

The experimental results obtained showed that grease formulation had a very significant influence on friction torque and operating temperature. The friction torque depends on the viscosity of the grease base oil, on its nature (mineral, ester, PAO, etc.), on the coefficient of friction in full film conditions, but also on the interaction between grease thickener and base oil, which affected contact replenishment and contact starvation, and thus influenced the friction torque...|$|R

40|$|A {{parachute}} {{swivel mechanism}} (PSM) for planetary entry missions {{such as a}} Mars probe (MARSNET) or return of cometary material samples (ROSETTA mission) has been developed. The purpose of the PSM is to decouple the spin of the probe from the parachute, with low friction torque, during both the deployment and descent phases. Critical requirements are high shock loads, low friction, low temperatures, and several years of storage in the deep space environment (during the cruise phase of the probe, prior to operation). The design uses a main <b>thrust</b> <b>ball</b> bearing {{to cope with the}} load requirement and a smaller <b>thrust</b> <b>ball</b> bearing for guiding of the shaft. Except for use on the Viking and Galileo swivels, it appears that this type of bearing has very rarely been employed in space mechanisms, so that little is known of its friction behavior with dry lubrication. A slip ring assembly allows the transfer of electrical power for post-reefing of the parachute. A test program has been conducted covering the environmental conditions of Mars entry and Earth reentry.
