Now, {{if you had}} wanted a <b>bad</b> <b>cap,</b> not worth the price asked for it; a cap good for nothing but to clean windows with, I could have found you the very thing. But a good cap--no; we don't keep them. But wait a minute," [...] he continued,--on seeing the {{disappointment}} that spread over George's expressive countenance, [...] "don't be in a hurry. I have a cap here"--he went to a drawer and opened it--"it {{is not a good}} cap, but it is not so bad as most of the caps I sell." ...|$|E
40|$|In the {{semiconductor}} industry, electroless processes have been researched for various applications {{over the last}} decade. Examples of these applications include electroless CoWP as a copper-capping layer, electroless NiP/Au or NiP/Pd as bond <b>bad</b> <b>capping</b> layers, and electroless nickel and copper fill for through-silicon vias (TSVs) [1, 2, 3]. This paper discusses the use of NiP/Pd as bond pad copper-capping layers. Because the electroless process is relatively new to this application, it has a steep learning curve. One issue with copper and nickel films is corrosion during electroless processes, which {{is not only a}} yield detractor but also a reliability concern. Two types of corrosion mechanisms have been identified during electroless processes: (1) corrosion of copper substrate and (2) corrosion of electroless nickel. Fig. 1 shows the copper film corrosion while nickel film is intact. Fig 2 shows the electroless nickel corrosion while copper substrate is intact. In both cases, corrosion byproducts accumulate at the top of bond pad surface, as shown in Fig. 3. The corrosion residue causes wire bond no-stick fails in subsequent processes. Fig. 4 shows a wafer map of die that failed wire bonding. This paper discusses film surface analysis, mechanisms of both corrosion types and impact on wire bonding...|$|R

40|$|Limiting {{liability}} {{by establishing}} an arbitrary cap on civil damages is <b>bad</b> public policy. <b>Caps</b> are {{antithetical to the}} interests of consumers and at odds with the national interest in creating incentives for better and safer products. Whether the caps are on non-economic loss, punitive damages, or set for specific activity, they undermine the civil justice system, deceiving juries and denying just and reasonable compensation for victims in a broad range of fields. This Article postulates that capped liability on damages for offshore oil spills may well have been an instrumental factor contributing to the recent Deepwater Horizon catastrophe in the Gulf of Mexico. More broadly, it argues that caps on damages undermine the deterrent effect of tort liability and fail to achieve economically efficient and socially just results...|$|R
50|$|In {{defiance}} of all geographic reality, the Caps assumed the Oaks' {{place in the}} Western Division despite their move to the Eastern Seaboard. This kept them constantly on the road at faraway venues (their nearest divisional rivals, the New Orleans Buccaneers, were over 1,000 miles away) and the travel and time differential took its toll on their play. Playing at Washington Coliseum their average attendance was 2,992 fans per game. In a case of exceptionally <b>bad</b> timing, the <b>Caps</b> arrived {{at a time when}} the surrounding Near Northeast neighborhood was still recovering from the 1968 race riots. Fears that the neighborhood wasn't safe dragged down attendance. Due to the long travel distances involved in divisional play, the Caps played some home games in places like Wichita, Kansas and even Mexico City, Mexico but did not fare well in those supposed home games.|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} the reliability and {{the validity of the}} Dutch CAP Inventory, a screening instrument that measures parents' potential for child physical abuse (Milner, The Child Abuse Potential Inventory: Manual (2 nd ed.), Psytec, Webster, NC, 1986). The CAP Inventory and measures on parenting stress and parents' emotions and attributions with regard to childrearing were administered in a nonclinical sample of randomly selected mothers (N= 362) with a 4 -to- 11 -year-old child. The CAP Inventory Abuse scale showed high internal consistency and split-half reliability. Twenty-four CAP Inventories (6. 6 %) were invalid, because mothers tended to present themselves either as too good or too <b>bad.</b> Sixteen valid <b>CAP</b> Inventories (4. 4 %) were indicative of high potential for abuse. Scores on the Abuse scale were significantly predicted by an external locus of control with regard to childrearing and by high levels of parenting stress. Results supported the cross-cultural generalizability of the CAP Inventory Abuse scale. status: publishe...|$|R
5000|$|I {{may appear}} to be dreaming and talking like Shaikh Chilli, but we aim to turn this MAO College into a University similar to that of Oxford or Cambridge. Like the churches of Oxford and Cambridge, there will be mosques {{attached}} to each College... The College will have a dispensary with a Doctor and a compounder, besides a Unani Hakim. It will be mandatory on boys in residence to join the congregational prayers (namaz) at all the five times. Students of other religions will be exempted from this religious observance. Muslim students will have a uniform consisting of a black alpaca, half-sleeved chugha and a red Fez <b>cap...</b> <b>Bad</b> and abusive words which boys generally pick up and get used to, will be strictly prohibited. Even such a word as a [...] "liar" [...] will be treated as an abuse to be prohibited. They will have food either on tables of European style or on chaukis in the manner of the Arabs... Smoking of cigarette or huqqa and the chewing of betels shall be strictly prohibited. No corporal punishment or any such punishment as is likely to injure a student's self-respect will be permissible... It will be strictly enforced that Shia and Sunni boys shall not discuss their religious differences in the College or in the boarding house. At present it is like a day dream. I pray to God that this dream may come true." ...|$|R
