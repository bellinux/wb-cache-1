40|$|Outbreaks of acid-resistant {{foodborne}} pathogens in acid {{foods with}} pH values below 4. 0, including apple cider and orange juice, have {{raised concerns about}} the safety of <b>acidified</b> vegetable products. <b>For</b> <b>acidified</b> vegetable products with pH values between 3. 3 and 4. 6, previous research has demonstrated that thermal treatments are needed to achieve a 5 -log reduction in the numbers of Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7, Listeria monocytogenes, or Salmonella enterica. <b>For</b> some <b>acidified</b> vegetable products with a pH of 3. 3 or below, heat processing can result in unacceptable product quality. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the holding times needed to achieve a 5 -log reduction in E. coli O 157 :H 7, L. monocytogenes, and S. enterica strains in acidified vegetable products with acetic acid as the primary acidulant, a pH of 3. 3 or below, and a minimum equilibrated temperature of 10 �C. We found E. coli O 157 :H 7 to be the most acid-resistant microorganism for the conditions tested, with a predicted time to achieve a 5 -log reduction in cell numbers at 10 �C of 5. 7 days, compared with 2. 1 days (51 h) for Salmonella or 0. 5 days (11. 2 h) for Listeria. At 25 �C, the E. coli O 157 :H 7 population achieved a 5 -log reduction in 1. 4 days (34. 3 h). Acidified foods are defined as low-acid food products to which acid or acid food ingredients have been added. The final pH value <b>for</b> <b>acidified</b> foods must be at or belo...|$|R
