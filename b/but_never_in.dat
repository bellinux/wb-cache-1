5|$|The {{two teams}} had {{previously}} played {{six times in}} UEFA club competitions, <b>but</b> <b>never</b> <b>in</b> a final. In their previous UEFA club competition meetings, Barcelona won 2–1 on aggregate in the 1985–86 European Cup quarter-finals and 3–2 on aggregate in the 1990–91 European Cup Winners' Cup semi-finals, while Juventus won 3–2 on aggregate in the 2002–03 UEFA Champions League quarter-finals. They also played in the 1952 Latin Cup semi-finals, won by Barcelona 4–2, and the 1970–71 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup second round, won by Juventus 4–2 on aggregate.|$|E
5|$|He {{continued}} to dominate sumo in 2005, {{becoming the first}} wrestler ever to win all six honbasho (sumo tournaments) in the same year. The great yokozuna Taihō achieved the feat of six consecutive tournament victories twice, <b>but</b> <b>never</b> <b>in</b> a calendar year. Asashōryū lost only six bouts all year (0–1–0–2–2–1). One of those rare losses came on 11 September 2005, {{at the start of}} the Aki Basho when he dropped his first Shonichi (Day 1) bout during his tenure as yokozuna. On 26 November 2005, a visibly emotional Asashōryū wept after winning his eighty-third bout of the year, (surpassing Kitanoumi's record set in 1978) and clinching the tournament at the same time. The six championships of 2005 (including two more 15–0 wins in January and May) combined with his victory from the final tournament of 2004, meant Asashōryū became the first man in sumo history to win seven consecutive tournament championships.|$|E
5|$|The {{morphology}} of Proto-Central-Semitic shows {{significant changes}} compared with Proto-Semitic, especially in its verbs, and {{is much like}} in Classical Arabic. Nouns in the singular were usually declined in three cases: /-u/ (nominative), /-a/ (accusative) or /-i/ (genitive). In some circumstances (<b>but</b> <b>never</b> <b>in</b> the construct state), nouns also took a final nasal after the case ending: nunation (final /-n/) occurred in some languages, mimation (final /-m/) in others. The original meaning of this marker is uncertain. In Classical Arabic, final /-n/ on nouns indicates indefiniteness and disappears when the noun is preceded by a definite article or otherwise becomes definite in meaning. In other languages, final /-n/ may be present whenever a noun {{is not in the}} construct state. Old Canaanite had mimation, of uncertain meaning, in an occurrence of the word urušalemim (Jerusalem) as given in an Egyptian transcription.|$|E

25|$|Another type of three-level converter, {{used in some}} adjustable-speed drives <b>but</b> <b>never</b> <b>in</b> HVDC, {{replaces the}} {{clamping}} diode valves by a separate, isolated, flying capacitor connected between the one-quarter and three-quarter points. The operating principle {{is similar to that}} of the diode-clamped converter. Both the diode-clamped and flying capacitor variants of three-level converter can be extended to higher numbers of output levels (for example, five), but the complexity of the circuit increases disproportionately and such circuits have not been considered practical for HVDC applications.|$|E

25|$|Compton {{also played}} football, {{beginning}} {{his career at}} non-league Nunhead during the 1934–35 season before joining Arsenal. Whilst playing as a winger, he made his debut in 1936, taking up the number 11 jersey at the club. Compton was eventually successful at Highbury, winning the League title in 1948 and the FA Cup in 1950. With Arsenal Compton also won the old First Division in 1937–38, making seven league appearances in all that season. However, {{the latter part of}} his sporting career was dogged by knee trouble when his right knee was damaged in a collision with the goalkeeper of club Charlton Athletic. He was thus limited to 60 official i.e. non-wartime appearances, scoring 16 goals altogether. He represented England in wartime games on 12 occasions, <b>but</b> <b>never</b> <b>in</b> a full official match.|$|E
25|$|A bonnethead, a type {{of small}} hammerhead shark, {{was found to have}} {{produced}} a pup, born live on 14 December 2001 at Henry Doorly Zoo in Nebraska, in a tank containing three female hammerheads, but no males. The pup was thought to have been conceived through parthenogenic means. The shark pup was apparently killed by a stingray within days of birth. The investigation of the birth was conducted by the research team from Queen's University Belfast, Southeastern University in Florida, and Henry Doorly Zoo itself, and it was concluded after DNA testing that the reproduction was parthenogenic. The testing showed the female pup's DNA matched only one female who lived in the tank, and that no male DNA was present in the pup. The pup was not a twin or clone of her mother, but rather, contained only half of her mother's DNA ("automictic parthenogenesis"). This type of reproduction had been seen before in bony fish, <b>but</b> <b>never</b> <b>in</b> cartilaginous fish such as sharks, until this documentation.|$|E

25|$|Also {{associated}} with the granite batholith {{was the creation of}} mineral veins in parts of the Lake District. The richest known lead vein of all was found crossing the south-east shoulder of Green Side. This, the Greenside Lead Vein runs in a north-south direction and dips steeply to the east at 70°. It was up to 59 feet (18m) wide in the highest workings of the Greenside Mine, but averaged about 8 feet (2.5m) wide in deeper workings. The vein contained galena in a mixture of quartz and smashed rock. Galena (lead sulphide) is an ore of lead. The ore from Greenside also yielded 10oz of silver per ton of lead. Higher levels of the vein also contained quantities of baryte (barium sulphate), although at the time this had no commercial value. Very small amounts of blende (zinc sulphide) and chalcopyrite (copper-iron sulphide) were found in the deeper levels, <b>but</b> <b>never</b> <b>in</b> recoverable quantities.|$|E
25|$|Before the Falklands War, Defence Secretary John Nott had {{advocated}} {{and initiated}} {{a series of}} cutbacks to the Navy. The Falklands War though, provided a reprieve in Nott-proposed cutbacks, and proved a need for the Royal Navy to regain an expeditionary and littoral capability which, with its resources and structure at the time, would prove difficult. At {{the beginning of the}} 1980s, the Royal Navy was a force focused on blue-water anti-submarine warfare. Its purpose was to search for and destroy Soviet submarines in the North Atlantic, and to operate the nuclear deterrent submarine force. For a time Hermes was retained, along with all three of the Invincible-class light aircraft carriers. More Sea Harriers were ordered; not just to replace losses, but to also increase the size of the Fleet Air Arm. New and more capable ships were built; notably the Sheffield-class destroyers, the Type 21, Type 22, and Type 23 frigates, and new LPDs of the Albion class, and , <b>but</b> <b>never</b> <b>in</b> the numbers of the ships that they replaced. As a result, the RN surface fleet continues to reduce in size. A 2013 report found that the current RN was already too small, and that Britain would have to depend on her allies if her territories were attacked.|$|E
500|$|Davidson Seamount {{is among}} the best biologically {{described}} seamounts worldwide. Six major expeditions to the volcano have yielded over 60,000 species observations. [...] scientists have observed and recorded 168 species of megafauna on the seamount. Of these, about 7% of the species at Davidson are endemic, meaning they live only at Davidson. 71% of the species can be confidently classified as cosmopolitan (widespread), and sufficient data exists for 22% of the observed species to strongly suggest that their range {{is not limited to}} seamounts. The remaining 7% have only been seen in video footage. Interestingly, 13 species have been identified in other areas, <b>but</b> <b>never</b> <b>in</b> other seamounts.|$|E

No one led the meeting, and all men had the right to speak. According to Steel (1988), [...] "Discussion frequently spread discord, <b>but</b> <b>never</b> <b>in</b> recorded history were feuds so bitter as to bring about a permanent division in the community". This notion of a free society influenced Enric Miralles' vision for the new Scottish Parliament Building, opened in October 2004.|$|E
500|$|A pure goal-scorer, Richard did {{not play}} with finesse, nor was he known for his passing. One of his {{teammates}} remarked that [...] "Maurice wouldn't even pass you the salt". Richard led the NHL in goals five times, <b>but</b> <b>never</b> <b>in</b> points. He was best known for dashing toward the net from the blue line and was equally adept at scoring from his forehand or backhand. His exploits revived a Montreal Canadiens franchise that had struggled to draw fans in the 1930s. In addition to his 14 appearances on a post-season all-star team (eight on the first team, six on the second), Richard played in 13 consecutive NHL All-Star Games between 1947 and 1959.|$|E

500|$|She {{was known}} for having a dynamic vocal range, and was {{described}} as having an emotional awareness during her performances. She occasionally danced during her shows, and was described as having a sensuous presence on stage. She was able to vary her voice considerably: an obituary remarked that she [...] "could soar like an opera singer, but she could also whisper, roar, hiss, growl and shout. She could sing while making the epiglottal clicks of the Xhosa language." [...] She sang in English and several African languages, <b>but</b> <b>never</b> <b>in</b> Afrikaans, {{the language of the}} apartheid government in South Africa. She once stated [...] "When Afrikaaners sing in my language, then I will sing theirs." [...] English was seen as the language of political resistance by black South Africans due to the educational barriers they faced under apartheid; the Manhattan Brothers, with whom Makeba had sung in Sophiatown, had been prohibited from recording in English. Her songs in African languages have been described as reaffirming black pride.|$|E
500|$|Throughout the season, O'Ree faced blatant racism from opponents, {{remarking}} [...] "people {{just wanted}} a piece of me, maybe because they thought I was different, so I had to defend myself. [...] I wasn't going to be run out of any rink." [...] He endured racial slurs from fans in each of Chicago, Detroit and New York, though the taunts were largely absent in Montreal and Toronto. [...] O'Ree was supported by his teammates and Boston fans. He stated [...] "they were mean to me in places like Detroit and New York, too. [...] <b>But</b> <b>never</b> <b>in</b> Boston. [...] I'll never forget how my teammates there took care of me — men like Johnny Bucyk, Doug Mohns, Charlie Burns and Don McKenney. [...] They accepted me totally. [...] All of them had class." [...] In 1961, O'Ree was traded to Montreal {{but was unable to}} crack the Canadiens' line-up. [...] Playing over 20 minor league seasons, O'Ree twice won the Western Hockey League's scoring title: in 1964, with the Los Angeles Blades, and in 1969, with the San Diego Gulls.|$|E

A review in The Moving Picture News was contained detailed praise of the film's relevance and success in portraying the subject. The reviewer states, [...] "This film strikes home. ... The situation has been lived in New York City. The strike and its miseries are not forgotten. Whoever arranged the story had a big, tender heart and knew what appeals to the masses. The glee with which the superintendent's discomfiture was hailed by the audience spoke volumes. We wish {{some of the pictures}} were not quite so vividly black and white. Mayhap the tenseness of the situation hit the cameraman. Be that as it may, one thing is certain - there is no melodrama, but scenes out of real life." [...] While the reviewer in this case refers to the scenario being drawn from real life, the happy ending is termed as a fantasy by reviewer in The Moving Picture World who states, [...] " [...] of those pictures which thrill one despite their improbability. It may go in stories <b>but</b> <b>never</b> <b>in</b> fact, that an owner of a factory marries one of his girl employees, and a strike leader at that..." ...|$|E
