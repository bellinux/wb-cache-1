Matched pair of ramped washers is placed on plug and bayonet inserted. Inner slot of one washer matches contour of plug; this washer is stationary. Inner slot of second washer is circular. When second washer is rotated, washers push against <b>bayonet</b> <b>plug,</b> locking it in place. Retaining wire secures plug...|$|E
40|$|A {{penetration}} apparatus, {{for very}} high temperature applications {{in which a}} base plug is inserted into an opening through a bulkhead is described. The base plug has a head shape and is seated against the highest temperature surface of the bulkhead, {{which may be the}} skin of the nose cone or other part of a space vehicle intended for nondestructive atmospheric reentry. From the second side of the bulkhead at which the less severe environment is extant, a <b>bayonet</b> <b>plug</b> is inserted into the base plug and engages an internal shoulder at about 90 deg rotation. The <b>bayonet</b> <b>plug</b> has an integral flanged portion and a pair of ramping washers which are located between the flange and the second bulkhead surface with a spacing washer as necessary...|$|E
40|$|During {{the early}} {{development}} stage of balloon deployment systems for missions, nichrome wire cable cutters were {{often used in}} place of pyro-actuated cutters. Typically, a nichrome wire is wrapped around a bundle of polymer cables with a low melting point and connected to a relay-actuated electric circuit. The heat from the nichrome reduces {{the strength of the}} cable bundle, which quickly breaks under a mechanical load and can thus be used as a release mechanism for a deployment system. However, the use of hand-made heated nichrome wire for cutters is not very reliable. Often, the wrapped nichrome wire does not cut through the cable because it either pulls away from its power source or does not stay in contact with the cable being cut. Because nichrome is not readily soldered to copper wire, unreliable mechanical crimps are often made to connect the nichrome to an electric circuit. A self-contained device that is reusable and reliable was developed to sever cables for device release or deployment. The nichrome wire in this new device is housed within an enclosure to prevent it from being damaged by handling. The electric power leads are internally connected within the unit to the nichrome wire using a screw terminal connection. A <b>bayonet</b> <b>plug,</b> a quick and secure method of connecting the cutter to the power source, is used to connect the cutter to the power leads similar to those used in pyro-cutter devices. A small ceramic tube [0. 25 -in. wide 0. 5 -in. long (. 6. 4 -mm wide 13 -mm long) ] houses a spiraled nichrome wire that is heated when a cable release action is required. The wire is formed into a spiral coil by wrapping it around a mandrel. It is then laid inside the ceramic tube so that it fits closely to the inner surface of the tube. The ceramic tube provides some thermal and electrical insulation so that most of the heat generated by the wire is directed toward the cable bundle {{in the center of the}} spiral. The ceramic tube is cemented into an aluminum block, which holds it in position. The leads of the nichrome wire are attached to screw terminals that connect them to power leads. A <b>bayonet</b> <b>plug</b> mounted at the bottom of the rectangular block connects the power leads to a relay circuit. A thin aluminum shell encloses the entire structure, leaving access points to attach to the <b>bayonet</b> <b>plug</b> and to feed a cable into the cylinder. The access holes for the deployment cable are a smaller diameter than the nichrome coil to prevent the cable from coming in direct contact with the nichrome when loaded. It uses the same general method of severing a cable with a heated wire as was used previously, but implements it in such a way that it is more reliable and less prone to failure. It creates a mechanism to create repeatability that was nonexistent in the previous method...|$|E

50|$|Mackay was the {{inventor}} of the socket bayonet which soon came into general use, the idea being suggested to him by the failure of the <b>plug</b> <b>bayonet</b> to stop the rush of the Highlanders at the Battle of Killiecrankie.|$|R
25|$|Bayonets {{were used}} in {{conjunction}} with the musket for close range fighting– the bayonet was fitted into the socket the musket barrel, allowing it to be fired while the bayonet was fixed (unlike earlier screw or <b>plug</b> <b>bayonets)</b> and effectively turned the musket into a pike-like instrument.|$|R
50|$|For {{long-range}} weapons, {{the nest}} of bees was tested against the flintlock musket. Of the 32 rockets that were fired against a small battalion of dummy targets by the nest of bees, only {{six of them}} hit with three of them being kill shots while the flintlock musket fired off three shots and inflicted one kill and two wounds on a gel torso. The edge {{was given to the}} musket for its accuracy, heavy caliber, and option to mount a <b>plug</b> <b>bayonet.</b>|$|R
50|$|Beginning {{with the}} 17th century, {{another form of}} dagger—the <b>plug</b> <b>bayonet</b> and later the socket bayonet—was used to convert muskets and other longarms into spears by {{mounting}} them on the barrel. They were periodically used for eating; the arm was also used {{for a variety of}} other tasks such as mending boots, house repairs and farm jobs. The final function of the dagger was as an obvious and ostentatious means of enhancing a man's personal apparel, conforming to fashion which dictated that all men carried them.|$|R
5000|$|A common weapon {{among the}} clansmen during the Jacobite rebellions {{of the late}} 17th and early 18th centuries was the Scottish Basket Hilted Broadsword, {{commonly}} known as claidheamh beag or [...] "claybeg" [...] - meaning [...] "small sword" [...] in Scottish Gaelic. In close quarters, the claybeg was the ideal weapon of choice for combating British soldiers armed with long, unwieldy, muskets with <b>plug</b> <b>bayonets.</b> When paired with a [...] "targe", or light buckler a highlander was provided with a staunch defense, allowing him to block a bayonet with the targe and then deliver a thrust with the sword into his opponent's torso.|$|R
5000|$|Early bayonets {{were of the}} [...] "plug" [...] type. This allowed light {{infantry}} to {{be converted}} to heavy infantry and hold off cavalry charges. The bayonet had a round handle that slid directly into the musket barrel. This naturally prevented the gun from being fired. In 1671, <b>plug</b> <b>bayonets</b> were issued to the French regiment of fusiliers then raised. They were issued to part of an English dragoon regiment raised in 1672 and disbanded in 1674, and to the Royal Fusiliers when raised in 1685. The danger incurred {{by the use of}} this bayonet (which put a stop to all fire) was felt so early that the younger Puységur invented a socket bayonet in 1678 that fitted over the muzzle using a circular band of metal, allowing the musket to be loaded and fired. However, it was not widely adopted at the time.|$|R
5000|$|At seven o'clock, Dundee {{gave the}} order to advance, {{at which point the}} Highlanders dropped their gear, fired what muskets they had and charged. Mackay's forces, {{realising}} the battle was on, stepped up their rate of fire; however, due to a shallow terrace on the hillside shielding the advancing Jacobites, this fire was partly masked. Eventually the lines met, and Mackay's men in the centre were [...] "swept away by the furious onset of the Camerons". Killiecrankie is the first recorded use of the <b>plug</b> <b>bayonet</b> by British troops in battle; it increased firepower by converting every man into a musketeer and eliminating the need for pikemen but required training and confidence in its use. Since the bayonet fitted into the barrel of the musket and prevented further reloading or firing, fixing them was delayed until the last possible moment; inexperience in this relatively new weapon and the speed of the Jacobite charge meant Mackay's force were effectively defenseless once the Highlanders came to close quarters and their retreat quickly turned into a rout in which 2,000 were killed.|$|R
50|$|The {{introduction}} of the bayonet turned all musketeers into pikemen. Generally, in battles, two sides lined up and fired a few volleys at each other before one side charged with bayonets fixed. Due to {{the high cost of}} professional armies, a typical battle-line consisted of two or three lines of musketeers. These basic principles dominated warfare in the 18th Century. The drilling of soldiers, introduced by Prince Maurice of Nassau, was precisely exercised and documented, each movement involved in loading a musket practised repeatedly, which proved a great advantage on the battlefield. Later, Gustav II perfected the infantry formations and made good use of the power of volley fire, by adopting (more reliable) wheel-locks, taking away their armor to make them more mobile, and increasing the numbers of musketeers (which the wheellock enabled him to do) by having them do double duty as pikemen (by way of the <b>plug</b> <b>bayonet),</b> well as by adopting the paper cartridge (with a consequent sharp increase in rate and volume of fire) and streamlining the musket reloading procedure.|$|R
25|$|The major {{advancement}} in weapon {{technology in the}} 1690s was {{the introduction of the}} flintlock musket. The flintlock firing mechanism provided superior rates of fire and accuracy over the cumbersome matchlocks. But the adoption of the flintlock was not initially universal. Until 1697 for every three Allied soldiers that were equipped with the new flintlocks, two soldiers were still handicapped by matchlocks: French second-line troops were issued matchlocks as late as 1703. These weapons were further enhanced with the development of the socket-bayonet. Its predecessor, the <b>plug</b> <b>bayonet</b> – jammed down the firearm's barrel – not only prevented the musket from firing but was also a clumsy weapon that took time to fix properly, and even more time to unfix. In contrast, the socket-bayonet could be drawn over the musket's muzzle and locked into place by a lug, converting the musket into a short pike yet leaving it capable of fire. The disadvantage of the pike came to be widely recognised: at the Battle of Fleurus in 1690, German battalions armed only with the musket repulsed French cavalry attacks more effectively than units conventionally armed with the pike, while Catinat had abandoned his pikes altogether before undertaking his Alpine campaign against Savoy.|$|R
40|$|The {{transfer}} {{line for the}} solenoid currently has a dead branch on it. Issues regarding the solenoid {{transfer line}} also apply to the VLPC transfer line. Issues {{that need to be}} addressed are: (1) What is the heat load on the branch? (2) Would it be a good idea to run the LN 2 radiation shield on the branch? (3) What are the thermal acoustic oscillation parameters of a dead headed branch? A simple remedy, although not analyzed was to install a jumper with a flow restriction at the end of the helium piping to allow a small flow to pass from supply to return. Thus eliminating a stagnant gas volume in which pressure pulses would develop. (4) Do we need to have a vapor trap to keep liquid from sloshing back and forth from the cold end to the warm end? (5) Comment: The tee that passes the 2 -phase return into the nested LHe supply/return pipe should be pointed up so that the volume of transfer line acts sort of like a phase separator full of liquid. It is very difficult to predict the behavior of the dead ended branch. Therefore the conservative thing to do is to keep the Branch cold as in option A. Use a valve inside the bayonet box for the LHe. Due to space constraints, use a valve and u-tube arrangement for the LN 2. The additional heat leak from keeping the section cold is very reasonable. The heat load to LHe is 0. 8 W or 2. 3 W and to LN 2 is 13 W or 71 W when the detector is run in the collision hall or assembly hall respectively. To prevent thermal acoustic oscillation from occurring in the dead ended female bayonets, we can install male <b>bayonet</b> vacuum <b>plugs.</b> The heat load to the system and behavior of such an arrangement will not provide any surprises, unlike a dead ended branch. It also allows flexibility's such as running the helium refrigeration plant without the detector for tests or for precooling the return lines during cooldown, just to name a few. The LHe control valves should have actuators and be able to be remotely controlled. The LN 2 valves can be simple manual valves that will probably not be adjusted after their initial setting...|$|R
5000|$|The {{concept of}} the bayonet, which is {{essentially}} the idea of improvising a firearm as a spear, probably evolved from the early concept of spears having firearms being attached to them, also known as [...] "Fire lances". Various forms of fire lances were recorded in the 14th century Chinese gunpowder military treatise Huolongjing including the Fire lance and the Pear Flower Lance. These examples demonstrated a clear need for a form of hybrid weapon as such weapons only have a firing range of 3 meters or less, meaning reloading is almost impossible during an encounter with enemy forces and an immediate melee backup weapon is necessary. The first clearly recorded instance of a bayonet proper {{is found in the}} Chinese military treatise Binglu published in 1606, {{in the form of the}} Son-and-mother gun, a breech-loading musket that was issued with a <b>plug</b> <b>bayonet</b> that was roughly 57.6 centimetres in length and have an overall length of 1.92 meters with the bayonet attached. It was labelled as a [...] "gun-blade" [...] with it being described as a [...] "short sword that can be inserted into the barrel and secured by twisting it slightly" [...] that it is to be used [...] "when the battle have depleted both gunpowder and bullets as well as fighting against rebels/bandits, forces closing into melee or encountering an ambush" [...] and if one [...] "cannot load the gun within the time it takes to cover two bu (3.2 meters) of ground they are to attach the bayonet and hold it like a spear".|$|R
