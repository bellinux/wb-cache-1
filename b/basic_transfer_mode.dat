40|$|A 'Benefit Briefing Notebook' was {{prepared}} for the NASA Technology Utilization Office to provide accurate, convenient, and integrated resource information on the transfer of aerospace technology to other sectors of the U. S. economy. The contents are divided into three sections: (1) transfer overview, (2) benefit cases, and (3) indexes. The transfer overview section provides a general perspective for technology transfer from NASA to other organizations. In addition to {{a description of the}} <b>basic</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>modes,</b> the selection criteria for notebook examples and the kinds of benefit data they contain are also presented. The benefits section is subdivided into nineteen subject areas. Each subsection presents one or more key issues of current interest, with discrete transfer cases related to each key issue. Additional transfer examples relevant to each subject area are then presented. Pertinent transfer data are given {{at the end of each}} example...|$|R
50|$|The most <b>basic</b> fax <b>mode</b> <b>transfers</b> {{in black}} and white only. The {{original}} page is scanned in a resolution of 1728 pixels/line and 1145 lines/page (for A4). The resulting raw data is compressed using a modified Huffman code optimized for written text, achieving average compression factors of around 20. Typically a page needs 10 s for transmission, instead of about 3 minutes for the same uncompressed raw data of 1728×1145 bits at a speed of 9600 bit/s. The compression method uses a Huffman codebook for run lengths of black and white runs in a single scanned line, and it can also use the fact that two adjacent scanlines are usually quite similar, saving bandwidth by encoding only the differences.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Experimental {{measurements}} {{have been}} made to investigate meaning of the change in voltage for the pulse gas metal arc welding (GMAW-P) process operating under different drop <b>transfer</b> <b>modes.</b> Design/methodology/approach: Welding experiments with different values of pulsing parameter and simultaneous recording of high speed camera pictures and welding signals (such as current and voltage) were used to identify different drop <b>transfer</b> <b>modes</b> in GMAW-P. The investigation is based on the synchronization of welding signals and high speed camera to study the behaviour of voltage signal under different drop <b>transfer</b> <b>modes.</b> Findings: The results reveal that the welding arc is significantly affected by the molten droplet detachment. In fact, results indicate that sudden increase and drop in voltage just before and after the drop detachment can be used to characterize the voltage behaviour of different drop <b>transfer</b> <b>mode</b> in GMAW-P. Research limitations/implications: The results show that voltage signal carry rich information about different drop transfer occurring in GMAW-P. Hence it’s possible to detect different drop <b>transfer</b> <b>modes.</b> Future work should concentrate on development of filters for detection of different drop <b>transfer</b> <b>modes.</b> Originality/value: Determination of drop <b>transfer</b> <b>mode</b> with GMAW-P is crucial for the appropriate selection of pulse welding parameters. As change in drop <b>transfer</b> <b>mode</b> results in poor weld quality in GMAW-P, so in order to estimate the working parameters and ensure stable GMAW-P understanding the voltage behaviour of different drop <b>transfer</b> <b>modes</b> in GMAW-P will be useful. However, in case of GMAW-P hardly any attempt is made to analyse the behaviour of voltage signal for different drop <b>transfer</b> <b>modes.</b> This paper analyses the voltage signal behaviour of different drop <b>transfer</b> <b>modes</b> for GMAW-P...|$|R

In this study, the effects of various pulsing parameters on metal <b>transfer</b> <b>mode</b> in thin aluminium sheets welded by GMAW-P have been investigated. The pulsing variables namely peak current, base current, peak time, and base time were chosen as variable parameters. The metal <b>transfer</b> <b>mode</b> investigation was based on the synchronization of welding signals and high speed camera to characterize and identify conditions under which different types of metal <b>transfer</b> <b>modes</b> are observed in GMAW-P system.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we showhow {{it might be}} {{possible}} to adapt asynchronous <b>transfer</b> <b>mode</b> technology to satellite links. Asynchronous <b>transfer</b> <b>mode</b> is a high-speed protocol designed with optic fiber as the intended transmission media. Several problems arise when satellite channels are used. We propose to move the error recovery and detection from one layer of the asynchronous <b>transfer</b> <b>mode</b> protocol to a higher layer. Academic Part Time, email: murphy@systems. caltech. edu y Member of Technical Staff, email: edward chow@isd. jpl. nasa. gov z Technical Manager, email: markley@isd. jpl. nasa. gov 1 We base the retransmission straegy on the service carried, which utilises the ability of asynchronous <b>transfer</b> <b>mode</b> protocol to differentiate services. Our simulation results show that we not only increase the raw data throughput for satellite channels to almost the theoretical limit, but wehave improved the data transfer efficiency of the asynchronous <b>transfer</b> <b>mode</b> protocol by 7. 5 percent. Our results also show that it is possible to guarantee data services with no loss of data under certain conditions...|$|R

40|$|Among the {{aluminum}} welding processes, the GMAW (Gas Metal Arc Welding) {{process can be}} easily made automatic, has high productivity and great versatility regarding the type and thickness of material used in welding. The possibility of changing the <b>transfer</b> <b>mode</b> to adapt to different thickness, joint types, among other aspects, is another important and attractive feature. However, {{little is known about}} the <b>transfer</b> <b>modes</b> in aluminum GMAW process. For this reason, in this study an analysis of the metal <b>transfer</b> <b>modes</b> in {{the aluminum}} welding was made, and the objective was to generate maps that could identify the metal <b>transfer</b> <b>modes</b> and their regions in relation to the shielding gas and the wire diameter. The experimental procedure was the execution of weld on aluminum plate in a flat position with a constant voltage power source. The methodology used was laser Shadowgraphy combined with a high-speed movie camera. Therefore, it was possible to design the maps in which four metal <b>transfer</b> <b>modes</b> and their respective transition zones were determined. The maps also permit determination of the transition current zone between the globular and the spray mode, and modeling of the melting rate...|$|R

Arc {{stability is}} influenced by parameters such as arc power, metal <b>transfer</b> <b>mode,</b> and the regularity of the metal <b>transfer</b> <b>mode</b> (Ghosh et al. 2006). The emission of spatter during welding is the main negative result of poor arc stability; spatter creates material losses, extends cleaning time, and decreases weld bead quality (Suban and Tusek 2003).|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{nature of}} the applied {{shielding}} gas has a strong inﬂuence on arc stability and <b>transfer</b> metal <b>mode</b> of the welding process. In particular, increase {{of the percentage of}} carbon dioxide in argon induces the increase of the transition current value from the globular to spray metal <b>transfer</b> <b>mode.</b> This work shows that these effects are linked to the chemical and microstructural modiﬁcations of the anode tip during the gas metal arc welding process. The microstructure of the anode is investigated for various experimental conditions. Transition between the two <b>transfer</b> <b>modes</b> is linked to the existence and disappearance of a rather insulating oxide "gangue" at the wire extremity whose nature depends of the shielding gas. Chemical reactions at high temperature such as oxidation-reduction reactions between shielding gas and melted metal govern the transition of the spray-arc to globular <b>transfer</b> <b>mode...</b>|$|R
