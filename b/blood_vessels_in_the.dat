5|$|Alexander Kellner {{suggested}} that the large crests of the pterosaur Tapejara, {{as well as other}} species, might be used for heat exchange, allowing these pterosaurs to absorb or shed heat and regulate body temperature, which also would account for the correlation between crest size and body size. There is no evidence of extra <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> crest for this purpose, however, and the large, membranous wings filled with blood vessels would have served that purpose much more effectively.|$|E
5|$|Another rare {{complication}} {{that may}} occur early during warfarin treatment (usually within 3 to 8 weeks of commencement) is purple toe syndrome. This condition is thought to result from small deposits of cholesterol breaking loose and causing embolisms in <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> skin of the feet, which causes a blueish purple colour and may be painful.|$|E

5|$|Swelling of damaged muscle {{occasionally}} {{leads to}} compartment syndrome—compression of surrounding tissues, such as nerves and <b>blood</b> <b>vessels,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same fascial compartment—leading {{to the loss}} of blood supply and damage or loss of function in the part(s) of the body supplied by these structures. Symptoms of this complication include pain or reduced sensation in the affected limb. A second recognized complication is disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), a severe disruption in blood clotting that may lead to uncontrollable bleeding.|$|E
5|$|Hepatitis C is an {{infectious}} disease {{caused by the}} hepatitis C virus (HCV) that primarily affects the liver. During the initial infection people often have mild or no symptoms. Occasionally a fever, dark urine, abdominal pain, and yellow tinged skin occurs. The virus persists in the liver in about 75% to 85% of those initially infected. Early on chronic infection typically has no symptoms. Over many years however, it often leads to liver disease and occasionally cirrhosis. In some cases, those with cirrhosis will develop complications such as liver failure, liver cancer, or dilated <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> esophagus and stomach.|$|E
5|$|Low oxygen levels lead to hypoxic {{pulmonary}} vasoconstriction, the {{tightening of}} small <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lung {{to create an}} optimal distribution of blood through the lung. Persistently low oxygen levels causing chronic vasoconstriction leads to increased pressure on the pulmonary artery (pulmonary hypertension), which in turn puts strain on the right ventricle, {{the part of the}} heart that pumps blood to the lungs. The right ventricle undergoes remodeling, becomes distended and is less able to remove blood from the veins. When this is the case, raised hydrostatic pressure leads to accumulation of fluid in the skin (edema), and in more severe cases the liver and the abdominal cavity.|$|E

5|$|In 15–20 {{percent of}} cases of {{spontaneous}} SAH, no aneurysm is detected on the first angiogram. About half of these are attributed to non-aneurysmal perimesencephalic hemorrhage, in which the blood {{is limited to the}} subarachnoid spaces around the midbrain (i.e. mesencephalon). In these, the origin of the blood is uncertain. The remainder are due to other disorders affecting the blood vessels (such as cerebral arteriovenous malformations), disorders of the <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> spinal cord, and bleeding into various tumors. Cocaine abuse and sickle cell anemia (usually in children) and, rarely, anticoagulant therapy, problems with blood clotting and pituitary apoplexy can also result in SAH. Dissection of the vertebral artery, usually caused by trauma, can lead to subarachnoid hemorrhage if the dissection involves the part of the vessel inside the skull.|$|E
5|$|Liver {{disease may}} present itself as tiredness, {{increased}} bleeding tendency or confusion (due to hepatic encephalopathy) and portal hypertension. The latter, {{a condition in}} which the pressure in the portal vein is markedly increased, leads to esophageal varices, <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> esophagus that may bleed in a life-threatening fashion, as well as enlargement of the spleen (splenomegaly) and accumulation of fluid in the abdominal cavity (ascites). On examination, signs of chronic liver disease such as spider angiomata (small distended blood vessels, usually on the chest) may be observed. Chronic active hepatitis has caused cirrhosis of the liver in most by the time they develop symptoms. While most people with cirrhosis have an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer), this risk is relatively very low in Wilson's disease.|$|E
5|$|The {{functions}} of the frills and three distinctive facial horns on its head have long inspired debate. Traditionally, these have been viewed as defensive weapons against predators. More recent theories, noting the presence of <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> skull bones of ceratopsids, find it more probable that these features were primarily used in identification, courtship and dominance displays, much like the antlers and horns of modern reindeer, mountain goats, or rhinoceros beetles. The theory would find additional support if Torosaurus {{was found to be}} the mature form of Triceratops, as this would mean the frill also developed holes (fenestrae) as individuals reached maturity, rendering the structure more useful for display than defense.|$|E

50|$|<b>In</b> anatomy, <b>the</b> {{gastroduodenal}} artery {{is a small}} <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> abdomen.

5|$|Quinton, {{a student}} at the school {{mentioned}} before, calls his father after he sees the legless beggar man in his room at night. His father tells him that it was his imagination, goes back downstairs, but then screams. Quinton rushes down to find his father dead and his eyes turned red with blood. Doggett and Scully investigate this latest death after the police tell them about the strange man the boy saw. While discussing the lack of any damage to the body except the broken <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> eyes, Scully comes {{to the conclusion that the}} man is still inside the latest victim. She rushes to the morgue and finds the boy’s father with a distended belly. She cuts into him and then sees a hand emerge from the scalpel incision. After being temporarily knocked over, she follows a bloody trail, opens a door at the end of the trail, and finds no one there. Unbeknownst to her, however, the beggar is watching her.|$|E
5|$|The larger arteries {{throughout}} the brain supply blood to smaller capillaries. These smallest of <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> brain, {{are lined with}} cells joined by tight junctions and so fluids do not seep in or leak out {{to the same degree}} as they do in other capillaries, thereby creating the blood-brain barrier. Pericytes {{play a major role in}} the formation of the tight junctions. The barrier is less permeable to larger molecules, but is still permeable to water, carbon dioxide, oxygen, and most fat-soluble substances (including anaesthetics and alcohol). The blood-brain barrier is not present in areas of the brain that may need to respond to changes in body fluids, such as the pineal gland, area postrema, and some areas of the hypothalamus. There is a similar blood–cerebrospinal fluid barrier, which serves the same purpose as the blood–brain barrier, but facilitates the transport of different substances into the brain due to the distinct structural characteristics between the two barrier systems.|$|E
5|$|The {{mammalian}} {{heart has}} four chambers, two upper atria, the receiving chambers, and two lower ventricles, the discharging chambers. The heart has four valves, which separate its chambers and ensures blood flows {{in the correct}} direction through the heart (preventing backflow). After gas exchange in the pulmonary capillaries (<b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lungs), oxygen-rich blood returns to the left atrium via {{one of the four}} pulmonary veins. Blood flows nearly continuously back into the atrium, which acts as the receiving chamber, and from here through an opening into the left ventricle. Most blood flows passively into the heart while both the atria and ventricles are relaxed, but {{toward the end of the}} ventricular relaxation period, the left atrium will contract, pumping blood into the ventricle. The heart also requires nutrients and oxygen found in blood like other muscles, and is supplied via coronary arteries.|$|E
5000|$|The {{gastroduodenal}} artery {{is a small}} <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> abdomen. It supplies blood to the pylorus, a distal part of the stomach, and the proximal part of the duodenum. It arises from the common hepatic artery and terminates in a , when it splits into the right gastro-omental artery and the anterior superior pancreaticoduodenal artery.|$|R
5000|$|A venule is a {{very small}} <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> microcirculation that allows blood to return from the {{capillary}} beds to drain into the larger <b>blood</b> <b>vessels,</b> the veins. Venules range from 7 to 50μm in diameter. Veins contain approximately 70% of total blood volume, 25% of which is contained <b>in</b> <b>the</b> venules. [...] Many venules unite to form a vein.|$|R
50|$|Ischemic stroke,the {{most common}} {{is caused by}} a {{blockage}} of a <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> brain, usually caused by thrombosis or emboli from a proximal arterial source or the heart, that leads to the brain being starved of oxygen. The neurologic signs and symptoms must last longer than 24 hours or the brain infarction is demonstrated, mainly by imaging techniques.|$|R
5|$|It soars high while {{searching for}} food, holding its wings {{horizontally}} when gliding. It flaps in short bursts which {{are followed by}} short periods of gliding. Its flight is less efficient than that of other vultures, as the wings are not as long, forming a smaller wing area. In comparison with the turkey vulture, the black vulture flaps its wings more frequently during flight. It is known to regurgitate when approached or disturbed, which assists in predator deterrence and taking flight by decreasing its takeoff weight. Like all New World vultures, the black vulture often defecates on its own legs, using the evaporation {{of the water in}} the feces and/or urine to cool itself, a process known as urohidrosis. It cools the <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> unfeathered tarsi and feet, and causes white uric acid to streak the legs. Because it lacks a syrinx, the black vulture, like other New World vultures, has very few vocalization capabilities. It is generally silent, but can make hisses and grunts when agitated or while feeding. The black vulture is , and roosts in large groups. In areas where their ranges overlap, the black vulture will roost on the bare branches of dead trees alongside groups of turkey vultures. The black vulture generally forages in groups; a flock of black vultures can easily drive a rival turkey vulture, which is generally solitary while foraging, from a carcass.|$|E

50|$|Silver nitrate sticks {{are often}} used for minor {{hemostasis}} where patients are not under general anesthesia, and where electrocautery would be painful and inconvenient. One common use of silver nitrate sticks is in Emergency Medicine, to control epistaxis (nosebleed). The stick is rolled on the affected mucous membrane or visible <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nares (nostril) where the chemical cauterization stops the minor bleeding.|$|R
50|$|A {{resistance}} artery {{is small}} diameter <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> microcirculation that contributes {{significantly to the}} creation of the resistance to flow and regulation of the blood flow.Resistance arteries are usually arterioles or end-points of arteries. Having thick muscular walls and narrow lumen they contribute the most to the resistance to blood flow. Degree of the contraction of muscles <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wall of a resistance artery is directly connected to the size of the lumen.|$|R
