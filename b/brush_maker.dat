50|$|Because badgers are a {{protected}} species in North America {{and most of}} Europe, virtually all commercial badger hair comes from mainland China, which supplies knots of hair in various grades to <b>brush</b> <b>makers</b> in both China and Europe. In rural Northern China, badgers multiply {{to the point of}} becoming a crop nuisance, and village cooperatives are licensed by the national government to hunt badgers and sell the hair to processors.|$|R
50|$|During the ban the Daily Worker {{offices at}} Cayton Street were totally {{destroyed}} by fire during The Blitz on 16 April 1941. The paper moved temporarily in 1942 {{to the former}} Caledonian Press offices in Swinton Street (from where the old Communist Party Sunday Worker edited by William Paul had been printed from 15 March 1925 until 1929). In 1945 new offices were acquired at a former <b>brush</b> <b>makers</b> warehouse at 75 Farringdon Road, London EC1 for the sum of £48,000. A Scottish edition of the Daily Worker was produced from its plant in Glasgow from 11 November 1940.|$|R

5000|$|Etz Chaim Yeshiva was {{originally}} a Talmud Torah that {{was established in}} 1841 by the Chief Rabbi of Jerusalem, Shmuel Salant. For {{the first two years}} classes were held in various rooms throughout the Old City. In 1857, the yeshiva consolidated into a group of buildings adjacent to the Hurva Synagogue, sharing the premises with the Beth Din of Jerusalem. It was at this stage that the institution was renamed [...] "Etz Chaim Yeshiva." [...] The first permanent home of the yeshiva was financed by Rabbi Tzvi Zeev Fiszbejn (Fishbein in English), a wealthy <b>brush</b> <b>maker</b> originally from Miedzyrzec Podlaski in what is today Poland, who donated a thousand rubles in silver to Rabbi Salant for that purpose in 1863.|$|E
50|$|Abraham was {{the second}} son of John Bartlett and Jane Dunster. John Bartlett had apprenticed under William Turner, father of J. M. W. Turner, the famous artist and was a hairdresser and <b>brush</b> <b>maker.</b> Abraham became {{interested}} in animals a child and was allowed by his father's friend, Edward Cross, owner of the menagerie Exeter Exchange in the Strand, to make regular visits. This interest led to Cross introducing him to taxidermy. He however began to work as an apprentice to his father in the hairdressing business before he shifted to taxidermy in 1834. His taxidermy business near the British Museum was so successful {{that he was able}} to move to bigger home and towards the end of his life he owned three houses. He married Lydia Norvall and had four daughters and two sons.|$|E
50|$|Badgers {{have been}} trapped commercially for their pelts, {{which have been}} used for centuries to make shaving brushes, a purpose to which it is {{particularly}} suited owing to its high water retention. Virtually all commercially available badger hair now comes from mainland China, though, which has farms for the purpose. The Chinese supply three grades of hair to domestic and foreign <b>brush</b> <b>makers.</b> Village cooperatives are also licensed by the national government to hunt and process badgers to avoid their becoming a crop nuisance in rural northern China. The European badger is also used as trim for some traditional Scottish clothing. The American badger is also used for paintbrushes and as trim for some Native American garments. It has also been occasionally used for doll hair.|$|R
5000|$|The brand {{was first}} created by <b>brush</b> pen <b>maker</b> Dai Yuexuan (...) in Beijing in Late-Qing Dynasty. Dai Yuexuan was a {{professional}} craftsman of making ink brushes, and he was originally from Zhejiang Province. Dai learned the techniques from Huzhou, also a city in Zhejiang. Huzhou is very famous of its ink brush-making, and was the largest center of ink brush manufacture and production during that time. Ink brushes made in Huzhou are finely names as Hubi (Huzhou ink brushes).|$|R
5000|$|Other {{than the}} form and the duanwen of the qin, the qin player may marvel at the {{inscriptions}} {{at the back of}} the qin. These will be names, poems, dates of manufacture, seals and other artistic inscriptions. Of course, some qins have 'no name' on them, or are plain. Some think that there is no need to adorn the qin with written words, the sound should speak for itself. Most would just write the name and date inside the qin. However, carving inscriptions into the back of the qin is an art form in itself. It is a point of admiration to the qin, and collectors may add their own inscriptions on the qin, much like they would do to a piece of Chinese painting that they praise highly. Inscriptions can be used to date the qin as well, since most <b>makers</b> <b>brush</b> in their names and years of manufacture, mostly inside the soundhole, on the sound absorber or next to it. A calligrapher may be called in to compose a piece and that will be copied onto the qin.|$|R
