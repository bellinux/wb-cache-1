50|$|While {{the most}} common is fat <b>bloom,</b> sugar <b>bloom</b> also occurs and is not {{necessarily}} distinguishable from the fat <b>bloom</b> by appearance.

40|$|Abstract The North Atlantic Ocean {{contains}} diverse {{patterns of}} seasonal phytoplankton <b>blooms</b> with distinct internal dynamics. We analyzed <b>blooms</b> using remotely-sensed chlorophyll a concentration data and change point statistics. The first <b>bloom</b> {{of the year}} began during spring at low latitudes and later in summer at higher latitudes. In regions where spring <b>blooms</b> occurred at high frequency (i. e., proportion of years that a <b>bloom</b> was detected), there was a negative correlation between <b>bloom</b> timing and duration, indicating that early <b>blooms</b> last longer. In much of the Northeast Atlantic, <b>bloom</b> development extended over multiple seasons resulting in peak chlorophyll concentrations in summer. Spring <b>bloom</b> start day {{was found to be}} positively correlated with a spring phenology index and showed both positive and negative correlations to sea surface temperature and the North Atlantic Oscillation in different regions. Based on the characteristics of spring and summer <b>blooms,</b> the North Atlantic can be classified into two regions: a seasonal <b>bloom</b> region, with a well-defined <b>bloom</b> limited to a single season; and a multi-seasonal <b>bloom</b> region, with <b>blooms</b> extending over multiple seasons. These regions differed in the correlation between <b>bloom</b> start and duration with only the seasonal <b>bloom</b> region showing a significant, negative correlation. We tested the hypothesis that the near-surface springtime distribution of copepods that undergo diapause (Calanus finmarchicus, C. helgolandicus, C. glacialis, and C. hyperboreus) may contribute to the contrast in <b>bloom</b> development between the two regions. Peak near-surface spring abundance of the late stages of these Calanoid copepods was generally associated with areas having a well-defined seasonal <b>bloom,</b> implying a link between <b>bloom</b> shape and their abundance. We suggest that either grazing is a factor in shaping the seasonal <b>bloom</b> or <b>bloom</b> shape determines whether a habitat is conducive to diapause, while recognizing that both factors can re-enforce each other...|$|R

40|$|Almonds {{are one of}} {{the first}} {{commercial}} nut trees to <b>bloom</b> in early spring and thus are susceptible to temperature patterns prior to and during <b>bloom</b> which affect <b>bloom</b> timing, <b>bloom</b> length, pollination and nut set. Data used in this project include yearly dates of 90 % <b>bloom</b> from 1996 - 2006, <b>bloom</b> length in days and final crop yields in pounds per tree for Nonpareil and Mission varieties. Data were collected from the University of California Cooperative Extension reports on the 1993 - 2006 Regional Almond Variety Trials in Butte, San Joaquin and Kern Counties. Temperature pattern models in the form of Chill Hours (Chill Hour Model), Chill Units (Chill Unit Model), Chill Portions (Chill Portion Model) and Growing Degree Hours (GDH°) (Heat Model) prior to <b>bloom</b> were used to predict the date of 90 % <b>bloom</b> for each variety, site and year. Temperature model results were compared to averaged actual dates of 90 % <b>bloom</b> by site and variety used to predict <b>bloom</b> timing (Calendar Model). The relationship between <b>bloom</b> length in days and GDH° during <b>bloom</b> and the relationship between <b>bloom</b> length, GDH° during <b>bloom</b> and final crop yields were also evaluated. The average error in predicting the 90 % <b>bloom</b> date for both Nonpareil and Mission was smaller using the Calendar Model compared to the four temperature pattern models. The Chill Portion model did not have significantly higher average error in predicting the date of 90 % <b>bloom</b> than the Calendar model in Nonpareil. The Chill Unit and Chill Portion models had smaller errors in predicting 90 % <b>bloom</b> date than the Chill Hour or GDH° model in Mission. GDH° during <b>bloom</b> was positively correlated with <b>bloom</b> length. GDH° during the first four days of Nonpareil <b>bloom</b> was significantly correlated with crop yields, with each additional GDH° during <b>bloom</b> correlated with a 0. 4 lbs. /tree increase in crop yield. Further research is needed on specific temperature thresholds and their relationship to physiological changes during almond <b>bloom</b> and pollination. The practice of monitoring chilling and heat accumulation will allow growers to anticipate <b>bloom,</b> prepare to optimize bee activity during <b>bloom,</b> and plan for possible crop yield variations due to adverse weather conditions during <b>bloom</b> in almonds...|$|R

5|$|In Europe, {{pyrethroids}} and neonicotinoids {{have been}} used against B. rufimanus. Because of the faba bean crop biology and its attraction to pollinators at flowering stage, restrictions on pesticides uses have been introduced in Europe. It is particularly advised to spray in absence of pollinators {{in the early morning}} and evening. In addition, due to B. rufimanus biology, a temperature threshold combined with crop development stage can be used to increase the success of chemical treatments. Adult B. rufimanus activity increases with temperature, so that treatment efficiency might increase when maximum day temperatures are over 20°C during four consecutive days after treatment (Arvalis, 2016). Adult B. rufimanus activity increases with temperature, so that treatment efficiency might increase when maximum day temperatures are over 20°C during four consecutive days after treatment. The end of <b>blooming</b> indicates the end of adult activity in the field.

40|$|Phytoplankton spring <b>bloom</b> {{phenology}} {{was derived}} from a 15 -year time series (2000 – 2014) of ship-of-opportunity chlorophyll  a fluorescence observations collected in the Baltic Sea through the Alg@line network. Decadal trends were analysed against inter-annual variability in <b>bloom</b> timing and intensity, and environmental drivers (nutrient concentration, temperature, radiation level, wind speed). Spring <b>blooms</b> developed from the south to the north, with the first <b>blooms</b> peaking mid-March in the Bay of Mecklenburg and the latest <b>bloom</b> peaks occurring mid-April in the Gulf of Finland. <b>Bloom</b> duration was similar between sea areas (43 [*]±[*] 2 day), except for shorter <b>bloom</b> duration in the Bay of Mecklenburg (36 [*]±[*] 11 day). Variability in <b>bloom</b> timing increased towards the south. <b>Bloom</b> peak chlorophyll  a concentrations were highest (and most variable) in the Gulf of Finland (20. 2 [*]±[*] 5. 7  mg m − 3) and the Bay of Mecklenburg (12. 3 [*]±[*] 5. 2  mg m − 3). <b>Bloom</b> peak chlorophyll  a concentration showed a negative trend of − 0. 31 [*]±[*] 0. 10  mg m − 3  yr − 1.

40|$|Abstract: A <b>Bloom</b> filter is {{a compact}} data {{structure}} that supports membership queries on a set, allowing false positives. The simplicity and the excellent {{performance of a}} <b>Bloom</b> filter make it a standard data structure of great use in many network applications. In reducing the false positive rate of a <b>Bloom</b> filter, {{it is well known}} that the size of a <b>Bloom</b> filter and accordingly the number of hash indices should be increased. In this paper, we propose a new architecture reducing the false positive rate of a <b>Bloom</b> filter more efficiently. The proposed architecture uses cross-checking <b>Bloom</b> filters that are queried in case of positives of a main <b>Bloom</b> filter to cross-check the results. If every cross-checking <b>Bloom</b> filters produce negatives, the positive of the main <b>Bloom</b> filter can be determined as a false positive. The main <b>Bloom</b> filter is not necessarily large to reduce the false positive rate, since more numbers of the false positives of the main <b>Bloom</b> filter are identified by cross-checking <b>Bloom</b> filters.

It came out with an introductory note, in which Bogdan-Pitești favorably compared Macedonski with arch-rival Mihai Eminescu. In more general terms, the preface showed Bogdan-Pitești as an unyielding Francophile, who reported with alarm that Romania risked being seduced and then engulfed by German culture. Himself a disciple of Macedonski, T.

5|$|As per Tulsidas, the Nirguna Brahman (quality-less impersonal absolute) and Saguna Brahman (personal God with qualities) {{are one and}} the same. Both, Saguna (qualified Brahman) and Aguna (or Nirguna - {{unqualified}} Brahman) are Akath (unspeakable), Agaadh (unfathomable), Anaadi (without beginning, {{in existence}} since eternity) and Anupa (without parallel) (अगुन सगुन दुइ ब्रह्म सरूपा। अकथ अगाध अनादि अनूपा॥). It is the devotion (Bhakti) of the devotee that forces the Nirguna Brahman which is quality-less, formless, invisible and unborn, to become Saguna Brahman with qualities. Tulsidas gives the example of water, snow and hail to explain this – the substance is the same in all three, but the same formless water solidifies to become hail or a mountain of snow – both of which have a form. Tulsidas also gives the simile of a lake – the Nirguna Brahman is like the lake with just water, while the Saguna Brahman is a lake resplendent with <b>blooming</b> lotuses. In the Uttar Kand of Ramcharitmanas, Tulsidas describes in detail a debate between Kakbhushundi and Lomasa about whether God is Nirguna (as argued by Lomasa adhering to monism) or Saguna (as argued by Kakbhushundi adhering to dualism). Kakbhushundi repeatedly refutes all the arguments of Lomasa, to the point when Lomasa becomes angry and curses Kakbhushundi to be a crow. Lomasa repents later when Kakbhushundi happily accepts the curse but refuses to give up the Bhakti of Rama, the Saguna Brahman. Though Tulsidas holds both aspects of God to be equal, he favours the qualified Saguna aspect and the devotees of the highest category in the Ramcharitmanas repeatedly ask for the qualified Saguna aspect of Rama to dwell in their mind. Some authors contend from a few couplets in Ramcharitmanas and Vinay Patrika that Tulsidas has vigorously contradicted the denial of Avatar by Kabir. In several of his works, Kabir had said that the actual Rama is not the son of Dasharatha. In the Balkand of Ramcharitmanas, Shiva tells Parvati – those who say that the Rama whom the Vedas sing of and whom the sages contemplate on is different from the Rama of Raghu's race are possessed by the devil of delusion and do not know the difference between truth and falsehood. However, such allusions are based on interpretations of the text and do not hold much water when considered in the context of Ramcharitmanas. Tulsidas, in none of his works, has ever mentioned Kabir.|$|E
