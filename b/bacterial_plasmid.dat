25|$|The {{construction}} of a transgene requires the assembly of a few main parts. The transgene must contain a promoter, which is a regulatory sequence that will determine where and when the transgene is active, an exon, a protein coding sequence (usually derived from the cDNA for the protein of interest), and a stop sequence. These are typically combined in a <b>bacterial</b> <b>plasmid</b> and the coding sequences are typically chosen from transgenes with previously known functions.|$|E
25|$|Specialized {{applications}} {{may call}} for specialized host-vector systems. For example, if the experimentalists wish to harvest a particular protein from the recombinant organism, then an expression vector is chosen that contains appropriate signals for transcription and translation in the desired host organism. Alternatively, if replication of the DNA in different species is desired (for example, transfer of DNA from bacteria to plants), then a multiple host range vector (also termed shuttle vector) may be selected. In practice, however, specialized molecular cloning experiments usually begin with cloning into a <b>bacterial</b> <b>plasmid,</b> followed by subcloning into a specialized vector.|$|E
25|$|Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated {{transformation}} is another common technique. Agrobacteria are natural plant parasites, and their natural ability to transfer genes provides another engineering method. To create a suitable environment for themselves, these Agrobacteria insert their genes into plant hosts, {{resulting in a}} proliferation of modified plant cells near the soil level (crown gall). The genetic information for tumor growth is encoded on a mobile, circular DNA fragment (plasmid). When Agrobacterium infects a plant, it transfers this T-DNA to a random site in the plant genome. When used in genetic engineering the bacterial T-DNA {{is removed from the}} <b>bacterial</b> <b>plasmid</b> and replaced with the desired foreign gene. The bacterium is a vector, enabling transportation of foreign genes into plants. This method works especially well for dicotyledonous plants like potatoes, tomatoes, and tobacco. Agrobacteria infection is less successful in crops like wheat and maize.|$|E

40|$|Bacterial cells {{commonly}} {{serve as}} hosts for plasmids and bacteriophages. Since both plasmids and bacteriophages are {{not capable of}} proliferation without the machinery of the bacterial host, their stable coexistence with the host {{would be expected to}} be symbiotic. However, this is not always the case. Bacteriophages are good examples of parasites since often the killing and the lysis of their host is part of their life cycle. In contrast, <b>bacterial</b> <b>plasmids</b> are generally thought of as stable extra-chromosomal elements (Nordstrom & Austin, 1989). During the course of co-evolution of bacteria and plasmids, many non-essential genes were concentrated on plasmids from which they could be utilized by the host bacterium. Thus, <b>bacterial</b> <b>plasmids</b> could be considered as temporary endosymbionts (Sonea, 1991) ...|$|R

50|$|Site {{directed}} mutagenesis {{is a valuable}} technique that allows for the replacement of a single base in an oligonucleotide or gene. The basics of this technique involve the preparation of a primer {{that will be a}} complementary strand to a wild type <b>bacterial</b> <b>plasmid.</b> This primer will have a base pair mismatch at the site where the replacement is desired. The primer must also be long enough such that the primer will anneal to the wild type plasmid. After the primer anneals, a DNA polymerase will complete the primer. When the <b>bacterial</b> <b>plasmid</b> is replicated, the mutated strand will be replicated as well. The same technique can be used to create a gene insertion or deletion. Often, an antibiotic resistant gene is inserted along with the modification of interest and the bacteria are cultured on an antibiotic medium. The bacteria that were not successfully mutated will not survive on this medium, and the mutated bacteria can easily be cultured.|$|E
50|$|In {{recombinant}} DNA technology specific restriction endonucleases {{are used}} that will isolate a particular gene and cleave the sugar phosphate backbones {{at different points}} (retaining symmetry), so that the double stranded restriction fragments have single stranded ends.

5000|$|Although prokaryotic organisms do {{not possess}} a {{membrane}} bound nucleus like the eukaryotes, they do contain a nucleoid region in which the main chromosome is found. Extrachromosomal DNA exists in prokaryotes outside of the nucleoid region as circular or linear <b>plasmids.</b> <b>Bacterial</b> <b>plasmids</b> are typically short sequences, consisting of 1 kilobase (kb) to a few hundred kb segments, and contain an origin of replication which allows the plasmid to replicate independently of the bacterial chromosome.

40|$|Plasmids are mosaic in {{composition}} with a maintenance “backbone” {{as well as}} “accessory” genes obtained via horizontal gene transfer. This horizontal gene transfer complicates the study of their genetic relationships. We describe a method for relating {{a large number of}} Gram-negative (GN) <b>bacterial</b> <b>plasmids</b> based on their genetic sequences. Complete coding gene sequences of 527 GN <b>bacterial</b> <b>plasmids</b> were obtained from NCBI. Initial classification of their genetic relationships was accomplished using a computational approach analogous to hybridization of “mixed-genome microarrays. ” Because of this similarity, the phrase “virtual hybridization” is used to describe this approach. Protein sequences generated from the gene sequences were randomly chosen to serve as “probes” for the virtual arrays, and virtual hybridization for each GN plasmid was achieved using BLASTp. Each resulting intensity matrix was used to generate a distance matrix from which an initial tree was constructed. Relationships were refined for several clusters by identifying conserved proteins within a cluster. Multiple-sequence alignment was applied to the concatenated conserved proteins, and maximum likelihood was used to generate relationships from the results of the alignment. While {{it is not possible to}} prove that the genetic relationships among the 527 GN <b>bacterial</b> <b>plasmids</b> obtained in this study are correct, replication of identical results produced in a separate study for a small group of IncA/C plasmids provides evidence that the approach used can correctly predict genetic relationships. In addition, results obtained for clusters of Borrelia plasmids are consistent with the expected exclusivity for plasmids from this genus. Finally, the 527 -plasmid tree was used to study the distribution of four common antibiotic resistance genes. Post-printZhou, Y., D. R. Call, and S. L.
