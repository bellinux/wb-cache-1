5|$|The {{call of the}} Siberian accentor is a trisyllabic ti-ti-ti. The male's song, given {{from the}} top of a <b>bush</b> <b>or</b> tree, is a loud, high chirichiriri, {{variously}} described as {{similar to that of the}} Japanese accentor, the dunnock or the black-throated accentor. Breeding birds sing most vigorously early in the season, particularly at dawn, and some individuals may also sing on migration.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{breeding}} biology of the black catbird. Its breeding season appears to run from spring through summer; nest building was observed in Belize in early May, and small young were found in a nest in Mexico in mid-August. The nest, an open cup of twigs lined with rootlets and other fine material, is placed low in a dense <b>bush</b> <b>or</b> small tree. The female lays two greenish-blue eggs. However, details of nest-building, incubation times, parental care, fledging periods and number of broods are unknown.|$|E
5|$|These ants live in nests {{in sandy}} soil which {{sometimes}} have a mound, which resembles a molehill. M. nigrocincta ants labor to conceal their nests using twigs and leaves. Depending {{on the type}} of habitat in which the colony is located, they decorate the nest with plant material and gravel. Other materials that are used to camouflage M. nigrocincta colonies include dry leaves, rocks, vegetation, and twigs. Nests are beside a clump of grass or <b>bush</b> <b>or</b> {{at the base of a}} tree.|$|E

5|$|Both species {{walk with}} a high-stepping action, and can run swiftly through grass {{with the body}} held {{horizontal}} and laterally flattened. When disturbed, they typically fly less than , frequently landing behind a <b>bush</b> <b>or</b> thicket, and then go into a crouch. In short grass, they can escape from a dog using their speed and maneuverability, running with the body held almost horizontal. The typical flight is weak and fluttering, especially that of the African crake, but for longer flights, such as migration, the corn crake has a steadier, stronger action with its legs drawn up. Flocks of up to 40 corn crakes may form on migration, sometimes associating with common quails. Migration takes place at night, and flocks resting during the day may aggregate to hundreds of birds at favoured sites. The ability to migrate is innate, not learned from adults; chicks raised from birds kept in captivity for ten generations were able to migrate to Africa and return with similar success to wild-bred young.|$|E
5|$|The corn crake is a {{difficult}} bird to see in its breeding sites, usually being hidden by vegetation, but will sometimes emerge into the open. Occasionally, individuals may become very trusting; for five consecutive summers, an individual crake on the Scottish island of Tiree entered a kitchen to feed on scraps, and, in 1999, a wintering Barra bird would come for poultry feed once the chickens had finished. In Africa, it is more secretive than the African crake, and, unlike its relative, it is rarely seen in the open, although it occasionally feeds on tracks or road sides. The corn crake is most active early and late in the day, after heavy rain and during light rain. Its typical flight is weak and fluttering, although less so {{than that of the}} African crake. For longer flights, such as migration, it has a steadier, stronger action with legs drawn up. It walks with a high-stepping action, and can run swiftly through grass with its body held horizontal and laterally flattened. It will swim if essential. When flushed by a dog, it will fly less than , frequently landing behind a <b>bush</b> <b>or</b> thicket, and then crouch on landing. If disturbed in the open, this crake will often run in a crouch for a short distance, with its neck stretched forward, then stand upright to watch the intruder. When captured it may feign death, recovering at once if it sees a way out.|$|E
5|$|The female may {{be offered}} food by the male during {{courtship}}. He has a brief courtship display {{in which the}} neck is extended and the head held down, the tail is fanned, and the wings are spread with the tips touching the ground. He will then attempt to approach the female from behind, and then leap on her back to copulate. The nest is typically in grassland, sometimes in safer sites along a hedge, or near an isolated tree or <b>bush,</b> <b>or</b> in overgrown vegetation. Where grass is not tall enough {{at the start of}} the season, the first nest may be constructed in herby or marsh vegetation, with the second brood in hay. The second nest may also be at a higher altitude that the first, to take advantage of the later-developing grasses further up a hill. The nest, well hidden in the grass, is built in a scrape or hollow in the ground. It is made of woven coarse dry grass and other plants, and lined with finer grasses. Although nest construction is usually described as undertaken by the female, a recent aviary study found that in the captive population the male always built the nest.|$|E

Compared to the European enemies they were to face in their later history, the weapons of the Ashanti were poor. The Ashanti fighting man also wore a buckskin belt, carrying several knives of various lengths. The belt also held a machete for cutting through <b>bush,</b> <b>or</b> hand-to-hand combat.|$|E
25|$|Spiral-horned antelopes are browsers {{that are}} found {{in a wide variety}} of habitats, from arid environments to humid environments, {{spanning}} from semi-deserts, savannas, rainforests and mountains.

25|$|By comparison, Bill Clinton {{only had}} one {{outstanding}} Cabinet confirmation {{at the end of}} his first day in office and George W. Bush had all but one approved before February 1, 2001. Ronald Reagan had twelve of thirteen Cabinet members confirmed before February 1, and Jimmy Carter had all eleven of his confirmed. George H. W. Bush only had seven of thirteen confirmed by this time. Whereas his predecessors had to trade favours for contentious approvals such as Zoe Baird (Clinton), John Tower (G.H.W. <b>Bush),</b> <b>or</b> John Ashcroft (G.W. Bush), Obama has largely focused on the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, a proposed economic stimulus package totalling nearly $1 trillion.|$|E
25|$|By mid-2010, Clinton and Obama {{had clearly}} forged a good working {{relationship}} without power struggles; {{she was a}} team player within the administration and a defender {{of it to the}} outside, and was careful to make sure that neither she nor her husband would upstage him. He in turn was accommodating to her viewpoints and in some cases adopted some of her more hawkish approaches. She met with him weekly, but did not have the close, daily relationship that some of her predecessors had had with their presidents, such as Condoleezza Rice with George W. Bush, James Baker with George H. W. <b>Bush,</b> <b>or</b> Henry Kissinger with Richard Nixon. Nevertheless, he had trust in her actions.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes the rufous-tailed scrub robin {{is found}} in {{association}} with a woodchat shrike (Lanius senator), perhaps nesting in a neighbouring tree. The woodchat shrike perches {{near the top of}} a tree, ever alert to sparrowhawks, buzzards and other aerial predators while the scrub robin perches on a <b>bush</b> <b>or</b> lower branch, scanning the ground for the approach of snakes, cats, weasels, foxes, genets, ocellated lizards and other predators. Both birds are adept at luring away predators by flying towards them to attract their attention and then flitting away from the nest site through the undergrowth. The rufous-tailed scrub robin can recognise the warning cries of other species of bird and take appropriate action.|$|E

25|$|He {{instituted a}} series of {{socio-economic}} reforms that produced mixed results. Though he was a Jamaican from an elite family, Manley's successful trade union background helped him to maintain {{a close relationship with}} the country's poor majority, and he was a dynamic, popular leader. Unlike his father, who had a reputation for being formal and businesslike, the younger Manley moved easily among people of all strata and made Parliament accessible to the people by abolishing the requirement for men to wear jackets and ties to its sittings. In this regard he started a fashion revolution, often preferring the Kariba suit, a type of formal <b>bush</b> <b>or</b> safari jacket with trousers and worn without a shirt and tie.|$|E
25|$|Feeney {{first came}} to {{national}} prominence in 2000, shortly after his election as Speaker, when he led efforts to certify the state's Republican presidential electors {{even though it was}} still unclear whether George W. <b>Bush</b> <b>or</b> Al Gore had won the state's electoral votes. Feeney and his colleagues claimed that Florida's electoral votes were in imminent danger of being removed from consideration if the results of the popular vote in the state could not be determined with legal certainty. While Article 2 of the United States Constitution places this power in the legislature, many Democrats insisted that recounts needed to be completed, and that by doing so, a clear legal victor would emerge.|$|E
25|$|A {{special case}} of {{geographical}} names were those {{derived from a}} building or landmark, e.g. a Busch (<b>bush)</b> <b>or</b> Springborn (spring/well). Before the advent of street names and numbers, even for long times afterwards, many important buildings like inns, mills and farmsteads were given names (see also Der Lachs zu Danzig). Such a place was often better known than {{the people living in}} it; the people would get their 'family' name from the building. This name could be combined with a profession: Rosenbauer (rose-farmer, from a farmstead called 'the rose'); Kindlmüller (child's miller, from a mill named 'the Christmas child', 'the prodigal child' or 'the king's child'). The name of the building could also be used as is: Bär (Bear); Engels (from Engel, angel).|$|E
