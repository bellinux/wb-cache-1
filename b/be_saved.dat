5|$|Augustine {{believed}} that a physical Hell exists, but that physical punishment is secondary to the punishment of being separated from God. He proposed two reasons for this: Firstly, humans have free will, and only those who choose to follow God will be forgiven and able to avoid Hell. Secondly, he {{believed that}} Adam and Eve's choice to sin affected our free choice, and that humans are left unable to resist sin. Augustine proposed that the grace of Jesus Christ freed humans from original sin, but he maintained that humans can only <b>be</b> <b>saved</b> {{if they choose to}} receive grace, and that this choice is formed by the character of individual humans. Accepting that even those who will <b>be</b> <b>saved</b> continue to sin, Augustine proposed that those who choose God's grace will still go to Hell for a time to purge them of their sin, before going to Heaven.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, the Washington State Legislature {{ordered a}} $500,000 study to {{investigate}} the benefits of extending SR18 north to Everett through the Snoqualmie Valley. The plan was dropped as {{the study found that}} on average only five minutes would <b>be</b> <b>saved</b> over current routes. In 2002, Bellevue Square owner Kemper Freeman, Jr. made his support known for a new freeway linking Snohomish County via the Snoqualmie Valley.|$|E

5|$|She {{was opened}} to the public on Trafalgar Day, 21 October 1971. The date was significant, as Belfast was the first naval vessel to <b>be</b> <b>saved</b> for the nation since , Lord Nelson's {{flagship}} at the Battle of Trafalgar. Though no longer part of the Royal Navy, HMS Belfast was granted a special dispensation to allow her to continue to fly the White Ensign.|$|E
5|$|Anderson {{scored the}} first penalty in sudden death. Kalou then sent Van der Sar {{the wrong way}} to make it 5–5. Giggs was next up and he was also successful. Van der Sar then pulled off the crucial save for United; he pointed to his left to {{indicate}} to Nicolas Anelka that he thought he would kick to that side, as had the six players who had kicked before him, only to correctly dive to his right to deny Anelka, whose kick was at a good height to <b>be</b> <b>saved,</b> securing European football's top prize for United {{for the third time in}} their history.|$|E
5|$|Between June and September 1944, the Wehrmacht {{had lost}} {{more than a million}} men, and it lacked the fuel and armaments needed to operate effectively. On 12 April 1945, Hitler, who had earlier decided to remain in the city against the wishes of his advisers, heard the news that the American President Franklin D. Roosevelt had died. This briefly raised false hopes in the Führerbunker that there might yet be a falling out among the Allies and that Berlin would <b>be</b> <b>saved</b> at the last moment, as had {{happened}} once before when Berlin was threatened (see the Miracle of the House of Brandenburg).|$|E
50|$|In {{response}} to a telegram, Lorna Gary returns to San Diego and visits {{her husband in the}} hospital; their marriage <b>is</b> <b>saved.</b> She explains what happened between her and Drake; his reputation <b>is</b> <b>saved.</b> And Drake's resignation is refused because he is too junior to leave the Navy; his career with the squadron <b>is</b> <b>saved.</b> All <b>is</b> well.|$|R

The contestants not on probation sang in duets.|$|R
5|$|By May 1997, Republican {{congressional leaders}} reached a {{compromise}} with Democrats and President Clinton {{on the federal}} budget. The agreement called for a federal spending plan designed to reduce the federal deficit and achieve a balanced budget by 2002. The plan included a total of $152billion in bipartisan tax cuts over five years. Other major parts of the spending plan called for $115billion to <b>be</b> <b>saved</b> through a restructuring of Medicare, $24billion set aside to extend health insurance to children of the working poor, tax credits for college tuition, and a $2billion welfare-to-work jobs initiative.|$|E
5|$|Elevators, which operate {{differently}} {{depending on}} the hotel, enable the player to go between the five floors of the stage. The faster a stage is cleared, the more points {{will be given to}} the player. Every stage has its own title screen via which the game can <b>be</b> <b>saved.</b> The screens are also used to enter previously played hotel stages and the map of the Mushroom Kingdom, which allows the player to access any visited hotel.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, Guy Caron {{left the}} company due to artistic {{differences}} {{over what to do}} with the money generated by Cirque du Soleil's first financially successful tour. Laliberté wanted to use it to expand and start a second show while Caron wanted the money to <b>be</b> <b>saved,</b> with a portion going back to the National Circus School. An agreement was never met and Caron, along with a large number of artists loyal to him, departed. This stalled plans that year to start a new touring show.|$|E
50|$|The Sunday {{night after}} the 3rd Expulsion Night came the 4th Probation Night wherein Kristoff, Oona, Davey and Yeng were named the {{probationary}} contestants.

Ianto wants to turn her into a human again, but by doing so her Cyberman influence takes control, and the rest of the team must stop her before she could become a threat to Earth. However, Ianto still believes she can <b>be</b> <b>saved.</b>|$|E
5|$|Men {{spent their}} free time doing crafts such as woodworking, rugmaking, {{leatherwork}} and photography. Outdoor activities included hiking and swimming. Men formed choirs and music ensembles, performing in neighboring towns when relations were good. The men earned two days of furlough for each month of service. These days could <b>be</b> <b>saved</b> to allow enough time to travel several hundred miles home {{or in some cases}} traded to other men in exchange for cash.|$|E
5|$|Messages now {{allows users}} to send {{handwritten}} notes. This is done by turning the device to landscape mode for iPhones (landscape or portrait for iPad users) and then tapping the handwriting squiggle. The Messages app automatically saves recently used notes, {{to make it easier}} to send them again. A handwritten message can be deleted in the same way an app is deleted; by holding down on the message and pressing Delete. The message can also <b>be</b> <b>saved</b> as a picture file.|$|E

5|$|Müller {{started in}} all six matches that Germany {{played at the}} Euro 2016 finals. In the quarter-final match against Italy, Müller's shot {{was the first one}} to <b>be</b> <b>saved</b> in the penalty {{shoot-out}} during the tournament. This was the first time Germany failed to score in a shoot out since Uli Stielike missed in the 1982 World Cup. Germany ended up winning the shootout 6–5. Müller's poor run of form throughout the tournament hurt Germany's chances. Eventually, Müller finished the tournament without adding a goal to his name at the Euros.|$|E
5|$|Sonic the Hedgehog 3 was {{released}} for the Wii Virtual Console in September 2007 and Xbox Live Arcade on June 10, 2009.

A PC version {{was released}} via Steam in January 2011, as Sonic 3 & Knuckles.|$|E
5|$|Studios {{found their}} way around the {{restrictions}} and published increasingly racy imagery. Ultimately this backfired in 1934 when a billboard in Philadelphia was placed outside the home of Cardinal Dennis Dougherty. Severely offended, Dougherty took his revenge by helping to launch the motion-picture boycott which would later facilitate enforcement of the Code. A commonly repeated theme by those supporting censorship, and one mentioned in the Code itself was {{the notion that the}} common people needed to <b>be</b> <b>saved</b> from themselves by the more refined cultural elite.Massey, pg. 71.|$|E
50|$|This article {{deals with}} those 1,500,000 {{children}} who {{were killed by the}} Nazis. A much smaller number <b>were</b> <b>saved.</b> Some simply survived, often in a ghetto, occasionally in a concentration camp. Some <b>were</b> <b>saved</b> in various programs like the Kindertransport and the One Thousand Children in which children fled their homeland. Other children <b>were</b> <b>saved</b> by becoming Hidden Children. During and even before the war many vulnerable children were rescued by Œuvre de Secours aux Enfants (OSE).|$|R

5|$|The A. sp. was {{discovered}} in 2007. It {{was found in the}} course of the construction of a high-speed rail track connecting Madrid with Valencia, in a fossil site that many animals were found in, in the Villalba de la Sierra Formation. The site was at a locality named “Lo Hueco,” near the village of Fuentes, Castile-La Mancha, Spain. Over the course of several months, a large-scale emergency excavation by over 60 paleontologists and 100 manual workers allowed thousands of specimens of plants, invertebrates, and vertebrates of late Campanian-early Maastrichtian age to <b>be</b> <b>saved,</b> including A. sp.|$|E
5|$|The Hotel Polen fire {{occurred}} on 9 May 1977 in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. The conflagration destroyed the Hotel Polen (Hotel Poland), a five-story {{hotel in the}} centre of the city which had been built in 1891, as well as the furniture store on the ground level and a nearby bookstore. Many of the tourists who stayed at the hotel (of whom the majority were Swedes) jumped to their deaths trying to escape the flames. Upon their arrival, the fire department used a life net to help people escape, but not everyone could <b>be</b> <b>saved.</b> The incident resulted in 33 deaths and 21 severe injuries. The cause of the fire is unknown.|$|E
5|$|The {{design process}} {{involves}} trading-off different factors, including colour, contrast and overall disruptive effect. A failure {{to consider all}} elements of pattern design tends to result in poor results. The US Army's Universal Camouflage Pattern (UCP), for example, adopted after limited testing in 2003–4, performed poorly because of low pattern contrast ("isoluminance"—beyond very close range, the design looks like a field of solid light grey, failing to disrupt an object's outlines) and arbitrary colour selection, neither of which could <b>be</b> <b>saved</b> by quantizing (digitizing) the pattern geometry. The design was replaced from 2015 with Operational Camouflage Pattern, a non-pixellated pattern.|$|E
