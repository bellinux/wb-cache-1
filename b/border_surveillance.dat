From Lang Vei, U.S Special Forces personnel worked jointly with a 14-man South Vietnamese special forces contingent and six interpreters; they were responsible for <b>border</b> <b>surveillance,</b> interdiction of enemy infiltration and assistance in the Revolutionary Development Program. To accomplish those tasks Willoughby had one Montagnard company, three South Vietnamese rifle companies and three combat reconnaissance platoons at his disposal. Early in January 1968, Detachment A-101 received reinforcements {{in the form of a}} Mobile Strike Force Company, consisting of 161 Hre tribesmen, along with six U.S. Special Forces advisors. Elements of this Mobile Strike Force Company operated from a fortified bunker about 800 meters west of the camp, which served as an observation post. During the day the Hre tribesmen of the Mobile Strike Force conducted patrols; at night they took up ambush positions in the vicinity of the camp.|$|E

25|$|The 5th Special Forces Group (Airborne) {{added to}} its combat history during Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. In August 1990 {{the group was}} called upon to conduct {{operations}} in Southwest Asia {{in response to the}} Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. During this crisis the Army's First Special Operations Task Force consisting of elements of the 5th Special Forces Group (Airborne), comprising 106 special operations teams, performed a wide variety of missions. These spanned a wide scope of operations, including support to coalition warfare; conducting foreign internal defense missions with the Saudi Arabian Army; performing special reconnaissance, <b>border</b> <b>surveillance,</b> direct action, combat search and rescue missions; and advising and assisting a pan-Arab equivalent force larger than six U.S. divisions; as well as conducting civil-military operations training and liaison with the Kuwaitis. The <b>border</b> <b>surveillance</b> mission assigned the 5th Special Forces was key to providing actionable intelligence to the US and Pan-Arab Forces. New military relationships were forged between the US and the Arab dictatorships.|$|E

In the early 90s, the units stationed north have gained importance, since Morocco embarked on the fight against illegal immigration and drug trafficking. Personnel posted to monitor the border is risen from 3000 in 1992 to 4,500 in 2004. Morocco is {{under a lot of pressure}} from the European Union to combat drug trafficking. In 2001, Spanish television showed a member of the Auxiliary Forces helping load their drug cargo and then to push their boat to the sea.|$|E

25|$|The border {{was also}} patrolled in the British sector by the British Frontier Service (BFS), the {{smallest}} of the Western <b>border</b> <b>surveillance</b> organisations. The BFS had been established (as the Frontier Control Service) in 1946 to take over control of border crossing points from the British Army. Its personnel manned frontier control posts along all of the international and interzonal borders of the British sector, including the Danish and Dutch borders as well as the inner German border. The German customs service was re-established under BFS supervision and manned crossing points on the borders of the British zone of occupation along with BFS personnel. When German sovereignty was re-established in 1955, customs responsibilities were handed over to the Germans. A heavily reduced BFS remained in operation to serve as a liaison between British military and political interests and the German agencies on the border. One curiosity of the BFS was that despite being entirely land-based, its founding Director was a Royal Navy captain. He instituted the highly distinctive uniform of the BFS, designed in a quasi-naval style with silver rank badges. The BFS was finally disbanded in 1990 following Germany's reunification.|$|E
500|$|According to U.S. <b>border</b> <b>surveillance,</b> a white Mercury Grand Marquis with Mexican {{license plates}} 821-THE7 crossed at Brownsville border entry at 6:39p.m. CT on March 2. This car had crossed to Brownsville from Matamoros {{eighteen}} times between August 1992 and March 1993. When police {{went to the}} motel to check the register, they discovered that at 8:26p.m. CT that evening, Puentes Pizaña and Ramón Palomares, another hitman of the Cuellar organization, checked in with the receptionist. She registered the car in her notebook as a white Grand Marquis, but it was unclear if she wrote 821-WEX or 821-THE7 as the license plate number. Other evidence showed that several calls were made from Puentes Pizaña's and Garza's rooms to an identical Dallas number {{on the day of}} the murder. The police were never able to connect the number with the investigation, or identify the Dallas contact. Other evidence showed that Garza, along with Cuellar and Moya, visited a gun shop in Dallas to purchase a [...]38 Super pistol. After Fischer was killed, Garza said that the gun was stolen from his house in San Antonio after someone broke into it. The weapon was never recovered.|$|E

30|$|In 2003, Morocco {{passed its}} first {{immigration}} law since independence in 1956. Law 02 – 03 regulated foreigners’ entry {{and stay in}} Morocco, and criminalized irregular immigration and emigration. It also created the Direction of Migrations and <b>Borders</b> <b>Surveillance</b> within the Ministry of Interior, {{and led to the}} elaboration of a National Strategy on Combating Illegal Migration. The restrictive policy was overwhelmingly interpreted as a result of European pressure to control irregular migration. Yet, it first and foremost benefited Moroccan authorities’ domestic priorities and geopolitical standing (Natter, 2014 b). Indeed, shifting the focus away from Moroccan irregular migrants and towards sub-Saharan ‘transit’ migrants appeased popular concerns, and provided Morocco with a new bargaining tool in their diplomatic relations with Europe. As a consequence, the 2003 – 2013 decade was characterized by an arbitrary, violent and security-driven state approach to immigration, forcing sub-Saharan migrants without legal status into miserable living conditions and constant fear of crackdowns or expulsion by Moroccan police forces (CMSM & GADEM, 2012).|$|R
