5000|$|A <b>break</b> <b>junction</b> is an {{electronic}} device {{which consists of}} two metal wires separated by a very thin gap, {{on the order of}} the inter-atomic spacing (less than a nanometer). This can be done by physically pulling the wires apart or through chemical etching or electromigration. [...] As the wire breaks, the separation between the electrodes can be indirectly controlled by monitoring the electrical resistance of the junction.|$|E
5000|$|A typical {{conductance}} versus time trace {{during the}} breaking process (conductance is simply current divided by applied voltage bias) shows two regimes. First is a regime where the <b>break</b> <b>junction</b> comprises a quantum point contact. In this regime conductance decreases in steps {{equal to the}} conductance quantum [...] which is expressed through the electron charge (−e) and Planck's constant [...] The conductance quantum has a value of 7.74×10−5 siemens, corresponding to a resistance increase of roughly 12.9 kΩ. These step decreases are interpreted {{as the result of}} a decrease, as the electrodes are pulled apart, in the number of single-atom-wide metal strands bridging between the two electrodes, each strand having a conductance equal to the quantum of conductance. As the wire is pulled, the neck becomes thinner with fewer atomic strands in it. Each time the neck reconfigures, which happens abruptly, a step-like decrease of the conductance can be observed. This picture inferred from the current measurement has been confirmed by [...] "in-situ" [...] TEM imaging of the breaking process combined with current measurement.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{measurement}} of the conductance of a single molecule was realised in 1994 by C. Joachim and J. K. Gimzewski and published in 1995 (see the corresponding Phys. Rev. Lett. paper). This was the conclusion of 10 years of research started at IBM TJ Watson, using the scanning tunnelling microscope tip apex to switch a single molecule as already explored by A. Aviram, C. Joachim and M. Pomerantz {{at the end of}} the 80's (see their seminal Chem. Phys. Lett. paper during this period). The trick was to use an UHV Scanning Tunneling microscope to allow the tip apex to gently touch the top of a single [...] molecule adsorbed on an Au(110) surface. A resistance of 55 MOhms was recorded along with a low voltage linear I-V. The contact was certified by recording the I-z current distance property, which allows {{measurement of the}} deformation of the [...] cage under contact. This first experiment was followed by the reported result using a mechanical <b>break</b> <b>junction</b> method to connect two gold electrodes to a sulfur-terminated molecular wire by Mark Reed and James Tour in 1997.|$|E

40|$|We have {{investigated}} electrical transport through the molecular model systems benzenedithiol, benzenediamine, hexanedithiol and hexanediamine. Conductance histograms under different experimental conditions indicate that measurements using mechanically controllable <b>break</b> <b>junctions</b> in vacuum {{are limited by}} the surface density of molecules at the contact. Hexanedithiol histograms typically exhibit a broad peak around 7 * 10 ^{- 4 } G_ 0. In contrast to recent results on STM-based <b>break</b> <b>junctions</b> in solution {{we find that the}} spread in single-molecule conductance is not reduced by amino anchoring groups. Histograms of hexanediamine exhibit a very wide peak around 4 * 10 ^{- 4 } G_ 0. For both benzenedithiol and benzenediamine we observe a large variability in low-bias conductance. We attribute these features to the slow breaking of the lithographic mechanically controllable <b>break</b> <b>junctions</b> and the absence of a solvent that may enable molecular readsorption after bond breaking. Nevertheless, {{we have been able to}} acquire reproducible current-voltage characteristics of benzenediamine and benzenedithiol using a statistical measurement approach. Benzenedithiol measurements yield a conductance gap of about 0. 9 V at room temperature and 0. 6 V at 77 K.

40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} electronic transport {{measurements of}} single molecules in a liquid environment {{with the ultimate}} goal of demonstrating a molecular transistor addressed by a liquid gate. A mechanical controllable <b>break</b> <b>junction</b> with an integrated liquid cell is used as the measurement tool. We first studied the influence of different solvents on the conductance of gold junctions in the regime of tunneling and true metallic contacts. These measurements served as control experiment for the electrical characterization of single molecules. We then measured the conductance traces of thiolated C 60 molecules while varying the electrode separation. The shape of the curves was found to be strongly influenced by the solvent. By using a resonant tunneling model, the electronic tunneling rates could be extracted. Finally, the effect of a liquid gate was tested on several tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) compounds. This thesis is organized in the following way. • The first chapter presents two different approaches for producing nanogaps in order to contact single molecules. One is based on electrochemical wires grown in pores, whereas the other method concerns the electrochemical narrowing of lithographically defined gaps. • The second chapter introduces the <b>break</b> <b>junction</b> and gives a short overview over its research field. Discussed are the geometry and the mechanical properties of the <b>break</b> <b>junction</b> and finally the conductance of atomic contacts. • Chapter 3 is dedicated to the fabrication of <b>break</b> <b>junction</b> samples and the measurement setup. • Electric conductance measurements of atomic contacts in liquid environments are presented in the forth chapter.

40|$|Common to {{molecular}} electronics studies, nanoscale <b>break</b> <b>junctions</b> created through electromigration naturally produce electroluminescent arrays of individual gold nanoclusters spanning the electrodes. The arrival time stamping of detected photons from these electrically driven, room-temperature nanoclusters demonstrates that charge injection to the clusters is directly modulated by dynamic coupling to individual electrodes. These several-atom nanoclusters electroluminesce due to inelastic electron tunneling into cluster electronic energy levels. ac electrical excitation (similar to 200 MHz) with time-stamping of photon arrival times enables fast and local tracking of electrode-nanocluster coupling dynamics. The electrode-nanocluster coupling rate fluctuates by nearly {{an order of}} magnitude, and due to the asymmetry of the electromigration process, exhibits preferential charge injection from the anode.
