5|$|After Flower was {{released}} to critical praise and awards, Chen and Thatgamecompany {{moved on to}} their next game, Journey. Journey was intended by Chen {{to focus on the}} element of communication and social interaction in video games. Since in most games the communication between players is focused on specific goals, in Journey Chen intended for the player to be able to either play alone or to come across other players, but not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>communicate</b> with them directly. Instead, players have to build relationships with each other through their actions, helping each other or leaving as they choose. Journey {{was released}} on the PlayStation Network on March 13, 2012, and has received critical acclaim.|$|E

5|$|The {{appearance}} of zduhaći {{was not much}} different from that of ordinary people, but they had some traits that set them apart. They were deep sleepers, very hard to wake up, often drowsy, pensive, thoughtful, and solemn. Their faces were often puffy, eyes shadowy. They were wise and shrewd, successful in whatever they were doing and resourceful in dealing with problems; their households were prosperous. In Semberija, zduhaći were said to be good scapulimantic diviners, and to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>communicate</b> with domestic animals. The clan of Paštrovići from Montenegrin Littoral claimed that the zduhaći could hear any doings anywhere in the world; if someone stepped on a zduhać's foot, they could hear that too. The clan of Kuči held that the zduhaći were outstanding long jumpers.|$|E
5|$|The {{walkie-talkie}} {{interaction in}} Firewatch {{is inspired by}} the relationship in BioShock between the player character and Atlas, {{as well as the}} dialog system from The Walking Dead. At one point in the development, it was intended that the protagonist would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>communicate</b> with multiple characters, such as hikers, but the idea was discarded due to its expense and the schedule requirements with which the team were working. The team hoped to avoid lip syncing and minimize the amount of animation needed due to the limited team size and resources. The developers cast Cissy Jones, who appeared in The Walking Dead, as the voice of Delilah in 2014. It took longer to find a voice actor for Henry who the developers felt jibed with Jones; they ultimately cast Rich Sommer. Jones and Sommer recorded their lines in separate studios, but while on conference calls with each other to achieve a more natural rapport. The actors made a decision not to meet during production to maintain the distance between their characters.|$|E

25|$|An amateur radio {{repeater}} is a specialty amateur radio station that extends {{the range of}} communications for other stations. A repeater uses a receiver tuned to one radio frequency and a transmitter tuned to another radio frequency. Other stations using a repeater station transmit on one frequency but listen for signals on the other frequency. If a repeater station is in a favorable location, such as on a tall tower, {{the top of a}} tall building, or on a mountaintop, stations that otherwise would not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>communicate</b> with each other can each use the repeater and establish two-way communications.|$|E

Such devices would also offer the opportunity for users to remotely control their devices, or centrally manage them via a cloud-based interface, and enable advanced functions like scheduling (e.g., remotely powering on or off heating systems, controlling ovens, changing lighting conditions etc.).|$|E

Radagast is shown to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>communicate</b> with birds, some of which nest in his hair. In the film, Radagast is the first wizard to visit Dol Guldur after he realizes that an evil power has infected the wood he lives in.

In Dol Guldur he encounters the spirit of the Witch-king of Angmar, as well as the shadow of the Necromancer himself, and escapes with the Morgul blade taken from the Witch-king.|$|E

Bud volunteers to use an experimental diving suit equipped with a liquid breathing apparatus to survive to that depth, though he will only <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>communicate</b> through a keypad on the suit. Bud begins his dive, assisted by Lindsey's voice keeping him coherent against {{the effects of the}} mounting pressure, and reaches the warhead. The SEAL guides him in successfully disarming it. With nearly no oxygen left in the system, Bud types out that he knew this was a one-way trip, and tells Lindsey he loves her. As he waits for death, an NTI approaches Bud and takes his hand. He is guided to an alien ship deeper in the trench. Deep inside, the NTI creates an atmospheric pocket for Bud, allowing him to breathe normally. The NTI plays back Bud's message to his wife, and the two look at each other with understanding.|$|E

[...] In response, on April 6, 1830 the Mexican government enacted a series of laws restricting immigration from the United States. [...] The laws also called {{for the establishment of}} customs houses within Texas to begin enforcing customs duties. [...] On October 4, 1830, Bradburn was ordered to create the first customs post, to be located at Galveston Bay. [...] He was chosen for the assignment partly because he was bilingual and would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>communicate</b> with both the immigrants from the United States and the native Mexicans and partly due to his knowledge of the area and its terrain.|$|E

500|$|In April 1935, Air Traffic Control in the United Kingdom was {{improved}} by {{the introduction of}} a new control zone system. Heston was added as a control zone, relieving Croydon of some traffic. As a result of these changes the wavelength used by Lympne for radiotelegraphy changed from 862 metres to 825 metres. Six new direction finding stations were installed as part of these improvements, including one at Lympne. The improvement meant that Croydon would now <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>communicate</b> by radio with two aircraft at the same time. In August Henri Mignet flew his Mignet HM.14 [...] "Flying Flea" [...] across the Channel to Lympne, where the aircraft was demonstrated in front of large crowds.
