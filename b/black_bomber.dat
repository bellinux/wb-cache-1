During this time the war was winding down and the struggle to integrate the United States military heated up. Virtually all commanders submitted reports claiming that blacks took longer to train and performed more poorly than whites. Parrish {{was one of the few}} who did not do so. Parrish pointed out instances that showed blatant discrimination occurred against black airmen during the war, such as when there was a shortage of bomber pilots in Europe, white fighter pilots were sent to replace them despite the fact that fully trained <b>black</b> <b>bomber</b> pilots were available, even though flying fighter planes requires skills quite different from flying a bomber. Parrish also commented: [...] "It is a discouraging fact that officers of the Army Air Force, whose scientific achievements are unsurpassed, and whose scientific skill is unquestioned in mechanical matters and in many personnel matters, should generally approach the problem of races and minorities with the most unscientific dogmatic and arbitrary attitudes.... Whether we like or dislike Negroes ... they are citizens of the United States having the same rights and privileges of other citizens...." ...|$|E
