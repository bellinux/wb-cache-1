50|$|<b>Benomyl</b> (also {{marketed as}} Benlate) is a {{fungicide}} introduced in 1968 by DuPont. It is a systemic benzimidazole fungicide that is selectively toxic to microorganisms and invertebrates, especially earthworms. <b>Benomyl</b> binds to microtubules, interfering with cell functions, such as meiosis and intracellular transportation. The selective toxicity of <b>benomyl</b> as a fungicide is possibly {{due to its}} heightened effect on fungal rather than mammalian microtubules.|$|E

5000|$|Botrytis allii’s main agronomic host is {{the onion}} (Allium cepa). In order to control this disease, most agriculturalists utilize the {{fungicide}} <b>benomyl</b> [...] <b>Benomyl</b> is applied {{directly to the}} seed, as a pretreatment, before planting. However, the pretreatment must be used in addition to correct farming practices to further minimize the spread of Botrytis allii spores. For instance, <b>benomyl</b> works best if you dry the onions in a 30 °C environment after harvest. Lower drying temperatures, such as 18 °C, during the post harvest period {{have been known to}} increase disease presence. In addition, removal of the onions from the field in the first 48 hours after mechanical removal of the top has also shown to lower post harvest disease. [...] Moreover, it is important to pay attention to your fertilization schedule. High levels of nitrogen fertilizer during the growing season may cause delayed maturity. This is an issue because the onions that have the best chance of avoiding disease are the ones that have reached full maturity by the time they are harvested. [...] Crop rotations can also help control disease outbreak. [...] The rotation should take place over at least two years and crops not related to onions should be planted. Onion fields should be separated from each other because the spores of Botrytis allii are able to travel far distances.|$|E

5000|$|When planting, growers should select {{locations}} {{which have}} {{a large amount of}} direct sunlight such as a south facing slope. Proper pruning should also be completed {{to increase the amount of}} sunlight penetration and air circulation through the canopy. Any practice that increases the faster drying of leaves will help reduce the risk of infection. Growers may also consider making an after harvest fungicide application using a combination of <b>Benomyl</b> (50% WP)and Captan (50% WP) at rates of 1/4 Tablespoon and 2 Tablespoons respectively per gallon of water. This will help reduce the rate at which pathogens may develop resistance to <b>Benomyl</b> products. Prior to shuck split, the recommended fungicide for cherry leaf spot is chlorothalonil (Bravo and generics). [...] This fungicide is a multi-site protectant and is excellent for leaf spot control and is not at risk for fungicide resistance development. At least two applications of chlorothalonil should be made before shuck split with the goal to minimize the potential of infection at this early stage.|$|E
50|$|Due to the {{development}} and worldwide prevalence of resistance of parasitic fungi to <b>benomyl,</b> it and similar pesticide compounds became largely ineffective. High legal costs associated with it caused DuPont to cease its production in 2001 after 33 years on the market, and voluntarily requested cancellation for its registration.

50|$|The use of select {{fungicides}} {{to control}} L. fungicola {{can be effective}} by {{reducing the amount of}} present inoculum, but there are many issues with this approach. First, few chemicals can be used because all mushroom hosts are naturally sensitive to fungicides. Second, the pathogen has developed resistance to many fungicides over time and they are found to be increasingly less effective. The capability of the fungicide to kill the pathogen has been greatly diminished to a point where fungicide is almost ineffective. For example, L. fungicola has become resistant to <b>benomyl,</b> a common fungicide that is toxic to microorganisms. Third, the use of fungicides to combat L. fungicola may be banned in the near future and not be available to control the pathogen. Legislative involvement is restricting the type of chemical controls {{that can be used to}} fight this particular pathogen. The only effective and currently legal chemical control for dry bubble disease is Sporgon (active ingredient: Prochlorax-Manganese). Sensitivity of L. Fungicola to Sporgon has decreased, so increasing concentrations of Sporgon must be used to combat dry bubble disease.|$|E

Using the hydrophobic fluorescent probe 1 -anilinonaphthalene- 8 -sulfonic acid, <b>benomyl</b> was found to bind to brain tubulin with a dissociation constant of 11. 9 +/- 1. 2 muM. Further, <b>benomyl</b> bound to at a novel site, distinct from the well-characterized colchicine and vinblastine binding sites. <b>Benomyl</b> altered the far-UV circular dichroism spectrum of tubulin and reduced the accessibility of its cysteine residues to modification by 5, 5 '-dithiobis- 2 -nitrobenzoic acid, indicating that <b>benomyl</b> binding to tubulin induces a conformational change in the tubulin. <b>Benomyl</b> inhibited the polymerization of brain tubulin into microtubules, with 50 % inhibition occurring at a concentration of 70 - 75 muM.

However, recent mutational studies in yeast and fluorescence studies involving competitive binding of <b>benomyl</b> and colchicine on goat brain tubulin suggested that <b>benomyl</b> may bind to tubulin at a site distinct from the colchicine-binding site. We set out to examine whether colchicine and <b>benomyl</b> bind to tubulin at distinct sites using a human cervical cancer (HeLa) cell line with the thinking that these agents should exert either additive or synergistic activity on cell proliferation if their binding sites on tubulin are different.

The synergistic activity of <b>benomyl</b> and colchicine was also apparent from their strong depolymerizing effects on both the spindle and interphase microtubules when used in combinations, providing further evidence that these agents bind to tubulin at different sites. Using NMR spectroscopy, we finally demonstrated that <b>benomyl</b> and colchicine bind to tubulin at different sites and that the binding of colchicine seems to positively influence the binding of <b>benomyl</b> to tubulin and vice versa.
