5|$|The square itself held {{an array}} of coal mining offices, privately owned business, grocery and {{department}} stores, pharmacies and bars. During {{the closing of the}} coal mining era, most of the businesses left the square and moved to the main drag of Rt. 45, constructed in 1926. The courthouse built by John W. Gaddis was replaced with a modern, more efficient building in 1967 after the older building was condemned. Over the years, the architecture that graced Harrisburg square has slowly turned to rotting older structures mixed in with a hodge-podge of newer updated <b>buildings.</b> <b>Currently</b> there are a few privately owned downtown renovation projects in progress on and around the square.|$|E
5|$|Terminal 1 {{opened on}} March 15, 1963, and was {{expanded}} between 1970 and 1974 {{with the current}} A and B Gates <b>buildings.</b> <b>Currently,</b> Terminal 1 has four concourses, {{each of which is}} connected to a central pre-security area. Ticketing and baggage claim are located on Level 1 of this area. Level 2 houses the three security checkpoints, an esplanade with several retail outlets, and a USO lounge for military service members. West of the pre-security area are the A Gates and the B Gates, two Y-shaped concourses with circular ends. To the south are the C Gates, which can be accessed by the Green Line of the tram system. The satellite D Gates concourse, which opened in 1998, lies to the east and contains three lounges: the Centurion lounge for American Express card holders; the Club at LAS, which is available to all passengers at a fee; and the United Club. The Blue Line of the tram system links the D Gates with the pre-security area.|$|E
25|$|Yale and New Haven {{are working}} to build a medical and {{biotechnology}} research hub {{in the city and}} Greater New Haven region, and are succeeding to some extent. The city, state and Yale together run Science Park, a large site three blocks northwest of Yale's Science Hill campus. This multi-block site, approximately bordered by Mansfield Street, Division Street, and Shelton Avenue, is the former home of Winchester's and Olin Corporation's 45 large-scale factory <b>buildings.</b> <b>Currently,</b> sections of the site are large-scale parking lots or abandoned structures, {{but there is also a}} large remodeled and functioning area of buildings (leased primarily by a private developer) with numerous Yale employees, financial service and biotech companies.|$|E

25|$|Since 2005, {{there has}} been an ongoing debate {{pertaining}} to plans to relocate trackage off the streets of Michigan City. In July 2009, NICTD announced its intention to relocate the Michigan City track south of its current location in order to smooth out the curves, cut down the number of grade crossings, increase speed and reduce maintenance costs. The plan also calls for the replacement of both current stations with a single new station located a block west of the current 11th Street boarding location (between Franklin and Washington streets) with a modern, high-level platform and parking lot. The plan would require a demolition of residential and retail <b>buildings</b> <b>currently</b> located {{on the south side of}} 11th Street.|$|E
500|$|Summer Hill Public School, {{located in}} Moonbie Street, {{is a primary}} school that caters for {{students}} from Kindergarten to Year 6. It offers a selective program, known as Opportunity Classes, for Year 5 and 6 students under the New South Wales Government's Opportunity Class program. The school was established in 1883 in a wooden shed on [...] of land that had been resumed from James Bartlett. The older <b>buildings</b> <b>currently</b> used at the school date back to 1913 while more modern buildings were constructed in 1977, 1998 and 2010. The school, designed in the Victorian Classical style, is listed on the Register of the National Estate.|$|E
500|$|Two {{major public}} {{buildings}} are readily visible at {{the centre of}} the cityâ€“ the basilica and the Capitoline Temple. The basilica was used for the administration of justice and the governance of the city. Completed during the reign of Macrinus in the early 3rd century, {{it is one of the}} finest Roman basilicas in Africa and is probably modelled on the one at Leptis Magna in Libya. The building is [...] long by [...] wide and originally had two storeys. Its interior is dominated by two rows of columns framing the apses at each end of the building where the magistrates sat. The outer wall of the basilica, which is faced with columns, overlooks the forum where markets were held. Small temples and public offices also lined the [...] forum, which would have been full of statues of emperors and local dignitaries, of which only the pedestals now remain. Not much is known about the public buildings which existed in Volubilis prior to the start of the 3rd century, as the <b>buildings</b> <b>currently</b> visible were built on the foundations of earlier structures.|$|E

2500|$|Agassiz was the {{president}} of the newly incorporated company, a position he held until his death in 1910. [...] The company prospered under his leadership; in particular it underwent substantial growth between 1880 and 1910, when most of these <b>buildings</b> <b>currently</b> standing in the district were built. [...] However, after a 1913 mining strike, the company gradually declined, and was weakened further by the onset of the Great Depression. Finally, in 1968, the company was purchased by Universal Oil Products, who closed the Keweenaw mines for good.|$|E
2500|$|In 1971, Phoenix {{adopted the}} Central Phoenix Plan, {{allowing}} unlimited building heights along Central Avenue, {{but the plan}} did not sustain long-term development of the [...] "Central Corridor." [...] While a few office towers were constructed along North Central during the 1970s, none approached the scope of construction during the previous decade. Instead, the downtown area experienced a resurgence, {{with a level of}} construction activity not seen again until the urban real estate boom of the 2000s, when several high rise buildings were erected, including the <b>buildings</b> <b>currently</b> named Wells Fargo Plaza, the Chase Tower (at 483 feet, the tallest building in both Phoenix and Arizona) and the U.S.Bank Center. [...] By the end of the decade, Phoenix adopted the Phoenix Concept 2000 plan which split the city into urban villages, each with its own village core where greater height and density was permitted, further shaping the free-market development culture (see Cityscape, below). This officially turned Phoenix into a city of many nodes, which would later be connected by freeways. [...] 1972 would see the opening of the Phoenix Symphony Hall, ...|$|E
