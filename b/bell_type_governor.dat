In this article we consider a tripartite system with two measurements in each side and two outputs for each measurement. Then we will introduce a new <b>bell</b> <b>type</b> inequality for this system and we show that this inequality is violated by quantum theory with a violation factor and amount of violation of 3. 5 and 2. 5 respectively, which exceed those of available inequalities in both cases.

The generic Bell function is defined to generate the combinations of all the possible correlations whose local realistic bound can be obtained from the series of the constraint equations. The application of the constraints converts the optimization problem into the counting problems whose complexity is dramatically reduced.

40|$|The {{connection}} between quantum optical nonclassicality and {{the violation of}} Bell's inequalities is explored. <b>Bell</b> <b>type</b> inequalities for the electromagnetic field are formulated for general states of quantised radiation and their violation is connected to other nonclassical properties of the field. This is achieved by considering states with an arbitrary number of photons and carefully identifying the hermitian operators whose expectation values do not admit any local hidden variable description. We relate the violation of these multi-photon inequalities to properties of phase space distribution functions such as the diagonal coherent state distribution function and the Wigner function. Finally, the family of 4 -mode states with Gaussian Wigner distributions is analysed, bringing out {{in this case the}} connection of violation of <b>Bell</b> <b>type</b> inequalities with the nonclassical property of squeezing.

40|$|Abstract: The main aim of {{this report}} is to inform the quantum {{information}} community about investigations {{on the problem of}} probabilistic compatibility of a family of random variables: a possibility to realize such a family {{on the basis of a}} single probability measure (to construct a single Kolmogorov probability space). These investigations were started hundred of years ago by J. Boole (who invented Boolean algebras). The complete solution of the problem was obtained by Soviet mathematician Vorobjev in 60 th. Surprisingly probabilists and statisti-cians obtained inequalities for probabilities and correlations among which one can find the famous Bell’s inequality and its generalizations. Such inequalities appeared simply as con-straints for probabilistic compatibility. In this framework one can not see a priori any link to such problems as nonlocality and “death of reality ” which are typically linked to <b>Bell’s</b> <b>type</b> inequalities in physical literature. We analyze the difference between positions of math-ematicians and quantum physicists. In particular, we found that one of the most reasonable explanations of probabilistic incompatibility is mixing in <b>Bell’s</b> <b>type</b> inequalities statistical data from a number of experiments performed under different experimental contexts...|$|R
