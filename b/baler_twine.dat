5000|$|Baling twine or <b>baler</b> <b>twine</b> {{is a small}} {{diameter}} sisal or synthetic twine used to bind {{a quantity}} of fibrous material (notably hay or straw) into a more compact and easily stacked form. Tensile strengths of single-ply baling twine range from [...] to [...]|$|E
50|$|Traditionally, sisal {{has been}} the leading {{material}} for agricultural twine (binder twine and <b>baler</b> <b>twine)</b> because of its strength, durability, ability to stretch, affinity for certain dyestuffs, and resistance to deterioration in saltwater. The importance of this traditional use is diminishing with competition from polypropylene {{and the development of}} other haymaking techniques, while new higher-valued sisal products have been developed.|$|E
50|$|Founded on March 10, 1914, MFA (which {{once stood}} for Missouri Farmers Association) traces its {{beginnings}} to a one-room schoolhouse near Brunswick, Mo. In Newcomer School on March 10, 1914, seven farmers met to discuss {{an article by}} William Hirth. Hirth owned a magazine called the Missouri Farmer and Breeder. In his magazine, Hirth called for formation of farm clubs. Seven Brunswick-area farmers (Aaron Bachtel, Tom Penick, Will Heisel, George Heisel, Earl Smutz, John Kohl and Will Armstrong) met to discuss Hirth's article and soon placed the first cooperative order for 1,150 pounds of <b>baler</b> <b>twine.</b>|$|E
50|$|Apart from ropes, twines, {{and general}} cordage, sisal {{is used in}} {{low-cost}} and specialty paper, dartboards, buffing cloth, filters, geotextiles, mattresses, carpets, handicrafts, wire rope cores, and Macramé. Sisal has been utilized as an environmentally friendly strengthening agent to replace asbestos and fibreglass in composite materials in various uses including the automobile industry. The lower-grade fibre is processed by the paper industry because of its high content of cellulose and hemicelluloses. The medium-grade fibre {{is used in the}} cordage industry for making ropes, <b>baler</b> and binder <b>twine.</b> Ropes and twines are widely employed for marine, agricultural, and general industrial use. The higher-grade fibre after treatment is converted into yarns and used by the carpet industry.|$|R

He also sired Comestar Stormatic, who already has 2 sons within the American TPI (As of August 2008) Gen-Mark Stormatic Sanchez and Golden-Oaks St Alexander. He is also the sire of 2 other red carrier bulls: Granduc Tribute and Ladino Park Talent. In the US, he has Canyon-Breeze Storm Atom, another Storm son. His most famous daughter, Braedale <b>Baler</b> <b>Twine,</b> was chosen Global Cow of the Year 2008 by the Holstein International, dam of the {{successful}} second-crop sire Braedale Goldwyn. He has also other grandsons such as Braedale Bambam and Magor Bolivia Allen in Hungary.|$|E
5000|$|Darwin, Minnesota, is {{the home}} of a ball of <b>baler</b> <b>twine</b> rolled by Francis A. Johnson. It is 12 ft in {{diameter}} and weighs 17,400 lb. Johnson began rolling the twine in March 1950, and wrapped four hours every day for 29 years. It is currently housed in an enclosed gazebo across from the town park on Main Street at (...) to prevent the public from touching it. The town celebrates [...] "Twine Ball Day" [...] on the second Saturday in August every year. An adjacent volunteer-run, free to visit museum and gift shop has information {{on the history of the}} ball, as well as selling a variety of souvenirs. [...] It was the long-standing holder of the [...] "biggest ball of twine" [...] title in the Guinness Book of World Records, holding the title from its completion in 1979 until 1994, and was referenced by [...] "Weird Al" [...] Yankovic in his 1989 song [...] "The Biggest Ball of Twine in Minnesota." ...|$|E
40|$|The {{large amount}} of used {{polypropylene}} <b>baler</b> <b>twine</b> generated from the agricultural community may provide a low-cost, environmentally friendly source of fibre reinforcement {{that can be used}} to improve the properties of concrete. However, the performance of such fibres for the application has not yet been explored. The effectiveness of using small amounts of chopped <b>baler</b> <b>twine</b> to control the restrained plastic shrinkage cracking of portland cement mortar was investigated in this study. To determine the influence of <b>baler</b> <b>twine</b> fibre type, length and volume fraction on their performance, two types of <b>baler</b> <b>twine</b> (one composed of strands with circular cross section, the other composed of flat band shape strands) in two lengths (19 mm and 38 mm) and three volume fractions (0. 05 %, 0. 1 %, and 0. 3 %) were evaluated. To compare the performance of <b>baler</b> <b>twine</b> fibre with that of other commercially available synthetic fibres, fibrillated polypropylene fibres at equal lengths and volume fractions was investigated. The restrained plastic shrinkage tests were carried out by subjecting the fibre-reinforced mortar specimens, cast on rough substrate bases, to a wind speed of 2. 6 m/s, and relative humidity less than 3 % at 35 °C for 22 hours. To evaluate the effectiveness of the fibres, the crack numbers were recorded, and the maximum crack width and total crack area on the surface of each specimen were measured using an image analysis technique. Unrestrained plastic shrinkage tests were also conducted in which fibre-reinforced mortar specimens without the substrate bases were tested under the same environmental conditions. Test results indicate that both types of <b>baler</b> <b>twine</b> are capable of controlling restrained plastic shrinkage cracking to some extent, but are not as effective as fibrillated polypropylene. The <b>baler</b> <b>twine</b> composed of band shape strands performed better than the one composed of strands with circular cross section. Compared with plain specimens, the total crack area was reduced by 95. 3, 77. 5 and 38. 7 % when 0. 3 % volume fraction of 38 mm fibrillated polypropylene, band shape <b>baler</b> <b>twine</b> and circular <b>baler</b> <b>twine</b> fibres, respectively, were added. Similar reductions in maximum crack width were observed. Fibre length did not significantly influence cracking behaviour. Free plastic shrinkage was significantly reduced only when long fibre lengths (38 mm) and high volume fractions (0. 3 %) were used...|$|E
40|$|By early 1985, the {{prolonged}} drought in the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen {{had not only}} caused serious livestock losses, but had also put many further animals at risk, {{due to the lack}} of adequate feed. Project TCP/PDY/ 4505 was intended to directly increase production of feed by supplying fertilizers and pasture and fodder seeds. It was coordinated with project TCP/PDY/ 4403, which provided breeding assistance to the goat husbandry and fodder production programme; and it was intended that it should be the initial step toward a national intensive fodder production programmeFertilizers for a total value of $US 66 639, 2 000 kg of forage seeds, worth $US 11 650, and <b>baler</b> <b>twine</b> and spare parts for a hay baler, worth $US 22 300, were provided and distributed to state farms and over 100 cooperative farmers in the country. They were used to produce high-yielding tropical pasture forage species as well as irrigated sorgum. Improved agronomic practices were extended to both state farms and small-scale farmers, in collaboration with project PDY/ 81 / 014, `Assistance to Goat Husbandry and Fodder Production Development'. The baling supplies were used on state farms to store forageFodder production on the farms which had received fertilizers rose by 50 to 70 percent, and this resulted in a surplus that was sold by the farmers at reasonable prices through the local markets; this was greatly appreciated as fodder production from the rangelands was very poor, due to subnormal rainfall. The sale of surplus forage also provided additional income for farmers. Furthermore, the project clearly showed small-scale farmers the beneficial association of high-yielding perennial grasses with the right kinds and amounts of fertilizerIt was therefore recommended that improved agronomic practices, and on-farm demonstration using high-yielding perennial grasses and fertilizers, should continue under the follow-up project PDY/ 86 / 012, when this was approvedFinally, I should like to note that a number of difficulties occurred in clearing imported supplies through port authorities. During this project, clearance procedures accounted for between 10 and 20 percent of the cost of the imported products. It was therefore recommended that, for future emergency assistance, the Government provide adequate funds for port clearance formalitie...|$|E
