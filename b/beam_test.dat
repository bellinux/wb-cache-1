5000|$|Double {{cantilever}} <b>beam</b> <b>test,</b> {{also referred}} to as crack opening or razor blade method, is a method to define the strength of the bond. This is achieved by determining the energy of the bonded surfaces. A blade of a specific thickness is inserted between the bonded wafer pair. This leads to a split-up of the bond connection. The crack length [...] equals the distance between the blade tip and the crack tip and is determined using IR transmitted light. The IR light is able to illuminate the crack, when using materials transparent to IR or visible light. Is the fracture surface toughness very high, {{it is very difficult to}} insert the blade and the wafers are endangered to break at the slide in of the blade.|$|E

5000|$|Neutral-beam {{injection}} {{involves the}} introduction of high energy (rapidly moving) atoms (molecules) into an ohmically heated, magnetically confined plasma within the tokamak. The high energy atoms (molecules) originate as ions in an arc chamber before being extracted through a high voltage grid set. The term [...] "ion source" [...] is used to generally mean the assembly consisting {{of a set of}} electron emitting filaments, an arc chamber volume, and a set of extraction grids. The extracted ions travel through a neutralizer section of the beamline where they gain enough electrons to become neutral atoms (molecules) but retain the high velocity imparted to them from the ion source. Once the neutral beam enters the tokamak, interactions with the main plasma ions occur which significantly heat the bulk plasma and bring it closer to fusion-relevant temperatures. Ion source extraction voltages are typically of the order 50-100 kV, and high voltage, negative ion sources (-1 MV) are being developed for ITER. The ITER Neutral <b>Beam</b> <b>Test</b> Facility in Padova will be the first ITER facility to start operation. While neutral beam injection is used primarily for plasma heating, it can also be used as a diagnostic tool and in feedback control by making a pulsed beam consisting of a string of brief 2-10 ms beam blips. Deuterium is a primary fuel for neutral beam heating systems and hydrogen and helium are sometimes used for selected experiments.|$|E

40|$|In {{the course}} of this Master's thesis "Simulation of Particle Fluxes at the DESY-II Test <b>Beam</b> Facility'' the <b>test</b> <b>beam</b> {{generation}} for the DESY <b>test</b> <b>beam</b> line was studied in detail and simulated with the simulation software SLIC. SLIC uses the Geant 4 toolkit for realistic Monte Carlo simulations of particles passing through detector material. After discussing the physics processes relevant for the <b>test</b> <b>beam</b> generation and the principles of the beam generation itself, the software used is introduced together with a description of the functionality of the Geant 4 Monte Carlo simulation. The simulation of the <b>test</b> <b>beam</b> line follows the sequence of the <b>test</b> <b>beam</b> generation. Therefore, it starts with the simulation of the beam bunch of the synchrotron accelerator DESY-II, and proceeds step by step with the single <b>test</b> <b>beam</b> line components. An additional benefit of this thesis is the provision of particle flux and trajectory maps, which make fluxes directly visible by following the particle tracks through the simulated beam line. These maps allow us to see each of the <b>test</b> <b>beam</b> line components, because flux rates and directions change rapidly at these points. They will also guide the decision for placements of future <b>test</b> <b>beam</b> line components and measurement equipment. In the end, the beam energy and its spread, and the beam rate of the final <b>test</b> <b>beam</b> in the <b>test</b> <b>beam</b> area were studied in the simulation, so that the results can be compared to the measured <b>beam</b> parameters. The <b>test</b> <b>beam</b> simulation of this Master's thesis will serve as a key input for future <b>test</b> <b>beam</b> line improvements...|$|R
