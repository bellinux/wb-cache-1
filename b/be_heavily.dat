Its low, hipped roof and overhanging eaves are reminiscent of Wright's Prairie Houses. This early work also demonstrates his interest in Czech Cubism and the work of Auguste Perret.|$|E
5|$|The {{facilities}} on Morotai {{continued to}} <b>be</b> <b>heavily</b> {{used by the}} Allies {{in the months after}} the war. The Australian force responsible for the occupation and military administration of the eastern NEI was headquartered at Morotai until April 1946, when the Dutch colonial government was reestablished. The island {{was also one of the}} sites where the Australian and NEI militaries conducted war crimes trials of Japanese personnel.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the Pacific War, remnants of the United States Asiatic Fleet fled to Australia, on orders from Washington. The S-boats from the Philippines were organized into a fighting force at Brisbane, and Admiral Ernest King ordered S-boats from the Atlantic Fleet to supplement the force in Australia. Christie went along, arriving in April 1942, {{just in time for the}} Battle of the Coral Sea. During the Solomon Islands campaign, he ordered his boats to patrol around harbors which, while being key points for shipping, also tended to <b>be</b> <b>heavily</b> patrolled by aircraft and anti-submarine craft. In step with then-current U.S. Navy submarine doctrine, he made capital ships the prime targets, rather than have his boats focus on merchant shipping.|$|E

Police and military forces had partially or completely destroyed thousands of Albanian villages in Kosovo by burning or shelling them. According to a UNHCR survey, nearly 40% of all residential houses in Kosovo <b>were</b> <b>heavily</b> damaged or completely destroyed {{by the end of}} the war. Out of a total of 237,842 houses, 45,768 <b>were</b> <b>heavily</b> damaged and 46,414 were destroyed. In particular, residences in the city of Peć <b>was</b> <b>heavily</b> damaged.

5|$|Aware of the {{military}} importance of Jersey, the British government had ordered that the island <b>be</b> <b>heavily</b> fortified. On 6 January 1781, a French invasion force of 2,000 men set out {{to take over the}} island, but only half of the force arrived and landed. The Battle of Jersey lasted about half an hour, with Britain successfully defending the island. There were about thirty casualties on each side, and the British took 600 French prisoners whom were subsequently sent to England. Both British and French commanders were slain.|$|E
5|$|Early on {{the morning}} of September 11, 2001, 19 hijackers took control of four {{commercial}} airliners (two Boeing 757 and two Boeing 767) en route to California (three headed to LAX in Los Angeles, and one to SFO in San Francisco) after takeoffs from Logan International Airport in Boston, Massachusetts; Newark Liberty International Airport in Newark, New Jersey; and Washington Dulles International Airport in Loudoun and Fairfax counties in Virginia. Large planes with long flights were selected for hijacking because they would <b>be</b> <b>heavily</b> fueled.|$|E
5|$|On 16 October 2015, amid {{a wave of}} {{violence}} between Palestinians and Israelis, dozens of Palestinians overran the tomb {{and a group of}} them set it on fire with petrol bombs. Palestinian security forces dispersed them and extinguished the flames; and although the tomb itself was not apparently damaged, the women's section was reported to <b>be</b> <b>heavily</b> damaged. Israeli security forces later arrived at the scene. According to a Palestinian official, the Palestinians had attempted to set up barricades in the area to prevent home demolitions by the Israeli Army, but a group of them proceeded to attack the tomb.|$|E

5|$|Seeds do {{not require}} any {{treatment}} prior to planting, and take 26 to 40 days to germinate. Seeds that grow into yellow-flowered plants are pale and unpigmented, while future bronze- and red-flowered plants are dark greyish and black respectively. It generally takes about {{five to seven years}} to flower from seed. The plant favours sandy well-drained soils and a sunny position and can <b>be</b> <b>heavily</b> pruned if necessary, as new growth can arise from the lignotuber. Although it is readily propagated by seed, experiments with in vitro propagation found Banksia menziesii to be more difficult than other species trialled.|$|E
5|$|The {{advance on}} Finschhafen {{continued}} on 26 September. Since the Salankaua Plantation was still reported to <b>be</b> <b>heavily</b> defended, Windeyer attempted {{to force the}} defenders to withdraw. He started with attacks on two hills to the south west of the plantation. B and D Companies of the 2/15th Infantry Battalion attacked {{what came to be}} called Snell's Hill. It was captured in hand-to-hand combat using bayonets. The Australians captured three 13mm heavy machine guns and seven light machine guns, and buried the bodies of 52 dead Japanese defenders. The other feature, which came to be called Starvation Hill, was taken by C Company. However, their capture did not prompt the Japanese to leave the Salankaua Plantation.|$|E
5|$|The {{black bean}} aphid {{is a major}} pest of sugar beet, bean and celery crops {{with large numbers of}} aphids cause {{stunting}} of the plants. Beans suffer damage to flowers and pods which may not develop properly. Early-sown crops may avoid significant damage if they have already flowered before the number of aphids builds up in the spring. Celery can <b>be</b> <b>heavily</b> infested. The plants are stunted by the removal of sap, the stems are distorted, harmful viruses are transmitted, and aphid residues may contaminate the crop.|$|E

5|$|The {{island of}} Hispaniola was also {{predicted}} to <b>be</b> <b>heavily</b> {{affected by the}} storm. Workers from World Vision supplied food, clean water, medicines and emergency generators in the southern provinces of the Dominican Republic, and in the southern departments of Haiti where hurricane warnings had been issued. In low-lying areas, 1,580residents of the Dominican Republic and more than 1,000Haitians were evacuated as the storm approached. Small craft were advised to stay in port, while Haiti's Toussaint Louverture International Airport was closed.|$|E
5|$|The series {{includes}} a homosexual character, Guillermo Almada (Juan Gil Navarro), {{who came out}} in the early episodes and later married his partner in a ceremony featuring guest appearances by Evangelina Salazar and Luis Brandoni. This was the first fictional same-sex marriage on Argentine television since it was legalized in 2010, reflected the growing acceptance of sexual freedom in Argentina. Another character, Patricia Longo, was an obese girl who was a victim of school bullying. Isabel Macedo had to <b>be</b> <b>heavily</b> made up to appear obese for the flashbacks. Patricia was initially the telenovela's villain, with the bullying her motivation for inflicting revenge on her former classmates. The episode in which she reveals her true identity was well received.|$|E
5|$|While later {{reviews of}} the album saw It Was Written in a {{different}} light than previous reviews had, the subject matter was still seen as a major flaw of the album. Music critics perceived Nas' violent, fantastical mafioso stories as lacking the emotion and truthfulness of his debut album. While Illmatic is often held as Nas's magnum opus, It Was Written was not only perceived by critics as part of a sophomore jinx, but was also the first of Nas's subsequent work to <b>be</b> <b>heavily</b> judged and compared to the former. However, It Was Written has been noted as his commercial breakthrough by critics, as it boosted the rapper's image in the mainstream and helped attract a much larger fan-base.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} the New Kingdom, Egypt {{had entered}} a long period of {{political}} and economic decline. The priests at Thebes grew more powerful, and they effectively administered Upper Egypt, while kings ruling from Tanis controlled Lower Egypt. Some attempt at using the open tombs was made {{at the start of the}} Twenty-first Dynasty, with the High Priest of Amun, Pinedjem I, adding his cartouche to KV4. The Valley began to <b>be</b> <b>heavily</b> plundered, so during the Twenty-first Dynasty the priests of Amun opened most of the tombs and moved the mummies into three tombs in order to better protect them. They removed most of the treasure in order to further protect the bodies from robbers. Most of these were later moved to a single cache near Deir el-Bari (known as TT320). Located in the cliffs overlooking Hatshepsut's famous temple, this mass reburial contained a large number of royal mummies. They were found in a great state of disorder, many placed in other's coffins, and several are still unidentified. Other mummies were moved to the tomb of Amenhotep II, where over a dozen mummies, many of them royal, were later relocated.|$|E
5|$|Despite their {{previous}} failures, the Chinese launched another series of attacks from 11:30 and these attacks continued {{for the next}} two hours, again targeting 12 Platoon under the command of Lieutenant John Ward. Failing to break through again, the Chinese suffered heavy casualties before the assault ended. From 13:30 there was another lull in the fighting {{for an hour and a}} half, although D Company continued to endure Chinese mortar, machine-gun and rifle fire. Believing that the battle may continue into the night, Gravener made the decision to pull 12 Platoon back in order to adopt a tighter company perimeter, lest his forward platoon be overrun and destroyed. The movement was completed without incident and, shortly after, the newly vacated position was assaulted by a large Chinese force which had failed to detect the withdrawal. The Chinese moved quickly as they attempted to establish their position on the northern end of the ridge, only to <b>be</b> <b>heavily</b> engaged by Australian machine-gun and rifle fire, and artillery.|$|E
5|$|Han {{farmers in}} the Yangzi River region of {{southern}} China often maintained paddy fields for growing rice. Every year, they would burn the weeds in the paddy field, drench it in water, sow rice by hand, and around harvest time cut the surviving weeds and drown them a second time. In this system, the field lays fallow {{for much of the}} year and thus did not remain very fertile. However, Han rice farmers to the north around the Huai River practiced the more advanced system of transplantation. In this system, individual plants were given intensive care (perhaps in the same location as the paddy field), their offshoots separated so that more water could be conserved, and the field could <b>be</b> <b>heavily</b> fertilized since winter crops were grown while the rice seedlings were situated nearby in a plant nursery.|$|E

5|$|In the centre, {{the main}} attack along the Buin Road began at 08:30 on 20 May after 20 minutes of {{strafing}} by New Zealand Corsairs had prepared the ground. Advancing under a creeping barrage, and with mortar and machine gun support, the 24th Infantry Battalion moved forward with three companies {{up front and}} one held back in reserve, along with two troops of Matilda tanks. Mostly the forward companies reached their objectives, {{but one of the}} companies was halted just short of their objective and was forced to dig-in overnight after coming under heavy small arms and artillery fire and losing four killed and five wounded. The attack was resumed the following day, and the Australians were able to advance to the Pororei ford; however, they were prevented from moving any further as the Japanese were still concentrated in large numbers further to the west where an Australian patrol encountered 70 Japanese and were forced to go to ground. Finally, a company from the 24th Infantry Battalion was able {{to move on to the}} high ground on Egan's Ridge, which they found to <b>be</b> <b>heavily</b> mined and booby trapped. Engineers and assault pioneers were called up to clear the feature.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1920s and early 1930s, German tank theory was pioneered by two figures: General Oswald Lutz and {{his chief of}} staff, Lieutenant Colonel Heinz Guderian. Guderian became the more {{influential}} of the two and his ideas were widely publicized. Like his contemporary, Sir Percy Hobart, Guderian initially envisioned an armored corps (panzerkorps) composed of several types of tanks. This included a slow infantry tank, armed with a small-caliber cannon and several machine guns. The infantry tank, according to Guderian, was to <b>be</b> <b>heavily</b> armored to defend against enemy anti-tank guns and artillery. He also envisioned a fast breakthrough tank, similar to the British cruiser tank, {{which was to be}} armoured against enemy anti-tank weapons and have a large, 75-millimeter (2.95in) main gun. Lastly, Germany needed a heavy tank, armed with a 150-millimeter (5.9in) cannon to defeat enemy fortifications, and even stronger armor. Such a tank required a weight of 70 to 100tonnes and was completely impractical given the manufacturing capabilities of the day.|$|E
5|$|Often {{people try}} to avoid or outrun a tornado in a vehicle. Although cars can travel faster than the average tornado, the {{directive}} from the National Weather Service is for house-dwellers {{in the path of}} a tornado to take shelter at home rather than risk an escape by vehicle. This is a result of several factors and statistics. An interior room inside a well-built frame house (especially one with a basement) provides a reasonable degree of protection from all but the most violent tornadoes. Underground or above-ground tornado shelters, as well as extremely strong structures such as bank vaults, offer almost complete protection. Cars, on the other hand, can <b>be</b> <b>heavily</b> damaged by even weak tornadoes, and in violent tornadoes they can be thrown large distances, even into buildings. High-profile vehicles such as buses and tractor trailers are even more vulnerable to high winds.|$|E
