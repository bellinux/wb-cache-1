The CJEU has substantially mitigated the scope of this rule.

5000|$|A {{progressive}} tax {{is a tax}} in which the tax rate increases as the <b>taxable</b> <b>amount</b> increases. The term [...] "progressive" [...] refers {{to the way the}} tax rate progresses from low to high, with the result that a taxpayer's average tax rate is less than the person's marginal tax rate. The term can be applied to individual taxes or to a tax system as a whole; a year, multi-year, or lifetime. Progressive taxes are imposed in an attempt to reduce the tax incidence of people with a lower , as such taxes shift the incidence increasingly to those with a higher ability-to-pay. The opposite of a {{progressive tax}} is a regressive tax, where the relative tax rate or burden decreases as an individual's ability to pay increases.|$|R
40|$|Value added tax (VAT) is a {{key part}} of the fiscal revenue of many countries. Yet this broad-based tax on {{consumer}} spending exempts financial services. This seems puzzling to many, particularly given the significance of that sector and the size of its value-added in today's world economy. The fact that the European Commission is currently reviewing the tax treatment of financial activities in the EU underscores the importance of addressing the issue. Conventional wisdom holds that taxing financial services under a transaction-based VAT system entails difficulties that render it impossible to tax the services. The thesis investigates where the difficulties lie. The research is undertaken using benchmarks, namely the character of European VAT as an indirect tax on consumption expenditure and the specific features of financial activities, namely that they turn around money and the functions of money. The various key VAT concepts (e. g., taxable person, <b>taxable</b> transactions, <b>taxable</b> <b>amount)</b> are researched in order to establish whether the inclusion of financial activities in the European VAT system entails specific difficulties both from a practical, legal point of view and from a theoretical point of view (in the light of the benchmarks). The thesis contains an extensive investigation of the law inter alia as regards the scope of the exemption for financial services and the scope of the European VAT system. It is found that, particularly with regard to defining the scope of European VAT, what constitutes a taxable transaction, the <b>taxable</b> <b>amount</b> and calculating a deductible proportion, clear practical and theoretical difficulties exists. Finally, the thesis describes and evaluates alternative treatments to an exemption of financial services such as using both additive and cash-flow methods. The current review of financial services is also discussed. It is found that no clear best practice can be established. However, based on both theoretical and practical considerations, a preferred treatment is presented...|$|R

This applies to private car usage too if the car is owned by a company or a self-employed individual. In the case of cars, this is based on either a log-book method or a flat-rate method, which depends on the gross-list-price of a car rounded down to the next 100 EUR. This means the original list-price without any reduction or discount at the time of first original use, whether or not the car is used or some years old.

50|$|Opponents of VAT claim VAT is {{regressive}} and is paid by all consumers {{whether they}} be rich or poor, young or old.

Similarly, the poorest 20% spent 9.7% of their disposable income on VAT, whereas the richest 20% spent only 5.2% of their disposable income on VAT.
