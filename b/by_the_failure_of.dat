5|$|As I sifted the {{evidence}} this became {{less and less}} convincing to me until I concluded that the opposite was closer to the truth: that the Métis grievances were at least partly of their own making; {{that the government was}} on the verge of resolving them when the Rebellion broke out; That Riel's resort to arms could not be explained <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> constitutional agitation and that he received a surprisingly fair trial.|$|E
5|$|By early 1943, {{the ship}} had been {{sufficiently}} repaired to begin the conversion process, but Hitler, angered <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> German surface raiders at the Battle of the Barents Sea in December 1942 ordered the cessation of all work. Gneisenau was disarmed and her 28cm and 15cm gun turrets were used in shore batteries. Turret Caesar was installed in a coastal fortress in Trondheim as the coastal battery Orlandet.|$|E
5|$|Civilian deaths {{caused by}} allied {{operations}} had increased sympathy among Waygal residents for the Taliban, who {{were allowed to}} move into the Quam. The residents may have been further dismayed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> the Afghan president, Hamid Karzai, to address the concerns of a delegation of elders and maliks in Kabul two days previously.|$|E

5000|$|The main {{thesis is}} reiterated: [...] "The {{professionals}} of power, {{in or out}} of government, were consistently caught off-guard <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>failures</b> <b>of</b> superior force and the successes of nonviolence" [...] (p. 216). Contemporary political theory could 'neither foresee nor explain' the successes of non-violent people power.|$|R
5000|$|Brett H. McGurk, {{the special}} envoy with {{responsibility}} over the US-led military coalition, {{claimed that the}} fighting in the city would be accelerated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>failures</b> <b>of</b> ISIL in <b>the</b> Battle of Mosul, and claimed that the forces were prepared for a [...] "difficult and very long-term battle".|$|R
5|$|Edinburgh Zoo {{was created}} by Thomas Haining Gillespie, a {{solicitor}} from Dumfries who dreamed of establishing a zoological park in Scotland. At first {{he was told that}} tropical animals {{would never be able to}} live in a cold climate like Edinburgh's—a view that had to some extent been borne out <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> the Royal Zoological Gardens. In 1908, though, he was encouraged to read of the pioneering methods employed by Carl Hagenbeck, which were allowing tropical animals to thrive in the recently opened Tierpark Hagenbeck in Hamburg, Germany.|$|E
5|$|In August 1878, Walker {{represented}} the United States {{at the third}} International Monetary Conference in Paris while also attending the 1878 Exposition. Not only were the attempts by the United States to re-establish an international silver standard defeated, but Walker also had to scramble to complete the report on the Exposition in only four days. Although {{he returned to the}} U.S. in October disheartened <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> the conference and exhausted by his obligations at the Exposition, the trip had secured Walker a commanding national and international reputation.|$|E
5|$|It {{was also}} {{intended}} to develop reconnaissance and bomber versions, but these plans were disrupted by the German invasion in June 1941. The project was stymied <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> its intended inline engine, the Mikulin AM-37, and its performance was disappointing when a second prototype was built later with M-82 radial engines. It was cancelled in 1943 after {{at least two}} prototypes were built.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} Poland, Hungary, the UK and the US {{the most}} surprising cases of populist reaction. It argues that the social polarization caused <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>failures</b> <b>of</b> hyper-liberal reforms to the state, and the association of Social Democratic parties with those reforms, has provoked alienation from liberal democratic politics...|$|R
50|$|The {{financial}} problems brought in <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>failures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bayshore and Montreal stores were soon catching {{on the rest}} of the chain. La fondation Les Ailes and its programs were terminated. Projects to open new stores in Fairview Pointe-Claire, Marché Central and Lac-Mirabel were cancelled. Plans to expand in Toronto, Vancouver and the United States were also cancelled.|$|R

5|$|The initial {{rendezvous}} of the Kvant-1 module with Mir on 5 April 1987 {{was troubled}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> the onboard control system. After {{the failure of}} the second attempt to dock, the resident cosmonauts, Yuri Romanenko and Aleksandr Laveykin, conducted an EVA to fix the problem. They found a trash bag which had been left in orbit after the departure of one of the previous cargo ships and was now located between the module and the station, which prevented the docking. After removing the bag, docking was completed on 12 April.|$|E
5|$|Undaunted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> {{the bond}} issue, Fields {{returned}} to the 1926 General Assembly with more proposals, including another increase in the gasoline tax to provide the funds needed to construct the state highway system. The 1926 Assembly passed more legislation than any previous legislature, including the increased gas tax and several bills to reorganize state government. The state purchasing commission and the Department of Bus Transportation were among the entities created in the reorganization. Under Fields, the state implemented {{the first phase of}} desegregation busing.|$|E
5|$|After decades, the Oneida became {{frustrated}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> {{the case}} to settle. Instead, they began to purchase land within the claim area in fee simple, asserting sovereignty over the re-acquired parcels and refusing to pay property tax. In City of Sherrill v. Oneida Indian Nation of New York (2005), the Supreme Court held that laches barred the re-assertion of sovereignty over ancestral land re-acquired in fee simple; the Court did not consider whether the original aboriginal title over the disputed parcels was validly extinguished, and thus did not disturb its holding in Oneida II.|$|E
5000|$|The panic {{was caused}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Reading Railroad, a major eastern line, {{going out of}} business. It was soon {{magnified}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>failures</b> <b>of</b> hundreds of banks and business that were dependent upon the railroads. The United States Treasury experienced a drain on its gold reserves, which developed into a full-fledged panic in 1893. The Rockbridge Company's stock and land values plummeted, and the company failed. The stock market reacted with a dramatic plunge and European investors started pulling their funds from United States Stocks. With {{the end of the}} Rockbridge Company, plans for Glasgow's development ended ...|$|R

He created alliances to protect his people and prepare for a future which he thought depended on a closer relationship with the United States. He was willing to exchange land for the promise of protection for his people but was often disappointed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>failures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> US government.|$|R
5000|$|Wisden called fast bowler Geoff Lawson [...] "the {{outstanding}} Australian... {{his spirit}} was undaunted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>failures</b> <b>of</b> his fellow players, and he remained the one bowler to trouble the Pakistanis in all conditions throughout the series." [...] Australia's spinners only took six test wickets between them, although Australia did drop fifteen catches throughout the series. [...] "It all {{amounted to a}} tour to rank among the most dismal ever made by an Australian side," [...] said Wisden.|$|R
5|$|At the 20th century's end, Gaddafi—frustrated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> his Pan-Arab ideals—increasingly {{rejected}} Arab {{nationalism in}} favour of Pan-Africanism, emphasising Libya's African identity. From 1997 to 2000, Libya initiated cooperative agreements or bilateral aid arrangements with 10 African states, and in 1999 joined the Community of Sahel-Saharan States. In June 1999, Gaddafi visited Mandela in South Africa, and the following month attended the OAU summit in Algiers, calling for greater political and economic integration across the continent and advocating {{the foundation of a}} United States of Africa. He became {{one of the founders of}} the African Union (AU), initiated in July 2002 to replace the OAU; at the opening ceremonies, he called for African states to reject conditional aid from the developed world, a direct contrast to the message of South African President Thabo Mbeki.|$|E
5|$|Because male-female {{relationships}} are inherently unequal in her society, Wollstonecraft endeavours {{to formulate a}} new kind of friendship in The Wrongs of Woman: motherhood and sisterhood. It is Maria's pathetic story regarding the kidnapping of her child that first interests Jemima in her plight. The novel fragments also suggest that the tale might not end with a marriage, but rather with the creation of {{a new kind of}} family, one constituted by two mothers for Maria's child. With Jemima's rescue of Maria, Wollstonecraft appears to reject the traditional romantic plot and invent a new one, necessitated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> society to grant women their natural rights.|$|E
5|$|Bolstered <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> the English Short Parliament, the Scottish Parliament {{declared}} itself {{capable of}} governing without the king's consent, and in August 1640 the Covenanter army {{moved into the}} English county of Northumberland. Following the illness of the earl of Northumberland, who was the king's commander-in-chief, Charles and Strafford went north to command the English forces, despite Strafford being ill himself {{with a combination of}} gout and dysentery. The Scottish soldiery, many of whom were veterans of the Thirty Years' War, had far greater morale and training compared to their English counterparts. They met virtually no resistance until reaching Newcastle upon Tyne, where they defeated the English forces at the Battle of Newburn and occupied the city, as well as the neighbouring county of Durham.|$|E

But Jack was a genius {{as well as a}} sailor, and profited <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>failures</b> <b>of</b> his comrades. Instead of making futile efforts to break his bonds like them, he lowered his hairy head, and, with a howl and a tremendous rush, like a fish-torpedo, launched himself, or, as it were, took [...] "a header," [...] into the fiery man! ...|$|R

5000|$|A {{society may}} require {{contributions}} from its members {{in order for}} them to benefit from <b>the</b> services provided <b>by</b> <b>the</b> society. <b>The</b> <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> individuals to make such required contributions could be considered a reason to deny those benefits to them, although a society could elect to consider hardship situations in determining how much should be contributed.|$|R
5|$|Going into 2015, the Football League {{made public}} their {{concerns}} over Yeung's attempts to impose {{his choice of}} directors on the BIHL board despite his conviction disqualifying him from exerting influence over a club. Relationships became increasingly factional, as illustrated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> three directors, including the club's de facto chief executive Panos Pavlakis, to gain re-election, followed the next day by their reinstatement. On 17 February, the board voluntarily appointed receivers from accountants Ernst & Young to take over management of the company. Their statement stressed that no winding-up petition had been issued and the company was not in liquidation.|$|E
5|$|Implementation of the Bland–Allison Act {{did not end}} {{calls for}} free silver. The 1880s saw a steep decline in the prices of grain and other {{agricultural}} commodities. Silver advocates argued that this dropoff, which caused the price of grain to fall below its cost of production, was caused <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> the government to adequately increase the money supply, which had remained steady on a per capita basis. Advocates of the gold standard attributed the decline to advances in production and transportation. The late 19th century saw divergent views in economics as the laissez-faire orthodoxy was questioned by younger economists, and both sides found ample support for their views from theorists.|$|E
5|$|Since a {{proposal}} by Butinov and Knorozov in the 1950s, {{the majority of}} philologists, linguists and cultural historians have taken the line that rongorongo was not true writing but proto-writing, that is, an ideographic- and rebus-based mnemonic device, such as the Dongba script of the Nakhi people, which would in all likelihood {{make it impossible to}} decipher. This skepticism is justified not only <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> the numerous attempts at decipherment, but by the extreme rarity of independent writing systems around the world. Of those who have attempted to decipher rongorongo as a true writing system, the vast majority have assumed it was logographic, a few that it was syllabic or mixed. Statistically it appears to have been compatible with neither a pure logography nor a pure syllabary. The topic of the texts is unknown; various investigators have speculated they cover genealogy, navigation, astronomy, or agriculture. Oral history suggests that only a small elite were ever literate, and that the tablets were considered sacred.|$|E
50|$|Sweet Thursday is the self-titled debut, and only, album <b>by</b> <b>the</b> late 1960s British {{rock band}} Sweet Thursday. Its {{chance of success}} was cut short <b>by</b> <b>the</b> almost-immediate <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> record label.|$|R

5|$|The hydroid Hydractinia angusta has a mutualistic {{relationship}} with the scallop. A study showed that its larvae preferentially settled {{in the vicinity of}} other epibionts, usually on scallop shells, and that the scallop larvae were deterred from settling in the vicinity of colonies of the hydroid. It is surmised that the hydroid benefits from a solid substrate on which to live, and although the scallop benefits from the protection from predators provided by the stinging cells of the hydroid, it is disadvantaged <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> its larvae to establish themselves in their preferred location, on the shells of mature scallops.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, Iranian {{students}} {{seized the}} American embassy in Tehran {{and held the}} embassy staff hostage; the first rescue operation, code-named Eagle Claw ended in failure due to equipment and coordination problems, culminating in the crash of a RH-53D Sea Stallion helicopter into a parked C-130 Hercules in the Iranian desert, killing eight servicemen. A second rescue attempt, Operation Credible Sport, was ordered, and Brown was involved in planning and preparation. The follow-up rescue included U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy and Army assets. The Army units involved were the battalions {{that made up the}} 101st Aviation Group: the 158th Aviation Battalion, the 229th Aviation Battalion and the 159th Aviation Battalion. All three battalions formed Task Force 158. President Carter meanwhile appointed the former Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral James L. Holloway, III, to head a commission to study the deficiencies revealed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> Eagle Claw. Among the presented findings {{was the fact that the}} military lacked aircraft and crews who were trained and prepared to perform these mission types.|$|E
5|$|Julius, humiliated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> the Imperial invasion, {{turned to}} Louis XII of France (who, having {{been left in}} {{possession}} of Milan after the Second Italian War, was interested in further expansion into Italy) with an offer of alliance. In mid-March, the Republic provided a pretext for an attack on itself by appointing her own candidate to the vacant bishopric of Vicenza (an act in keeping with prevailing custom, though Julius considered it a personal provocation); the Pope called for all Christian nations {{to join him in}} an expedition to subdue Venice. On 10 December 1508, representatives of the Papacy, France, the Holy Roman Empire and Ferdinand I of Spain concluded the League of Cambrai against the Republic. The agreement provided for the complete dismemberment of Venice's territory in Italy and for its partition among the signatories: Maximilian, in addition to regaining Istria, would receive Verona, Vicenza, Padua and the Friuli; France would annex Brescia, Crema, Bergamo and Cremona to its Milanese possessions; Ferdinand would seize Otranto; and the remainder, including Rimini and Ravenna, would be added to the Papal States.|$|E
