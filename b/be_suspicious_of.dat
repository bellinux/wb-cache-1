5|$|In {{the wake}} of a world {{financial}} crisis, the King encouraged the formation of a National Government in 1931 led by MacDonald and Baldwin, and volunteered to reduce the civil list to help balance the budget. He was concerned by the rise to power in Germany of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party. In 1934, the King bluntly told the German ambassador Leopold von Hoesch that Germany was now the peril of the world, and that there was bound to be a war within ten years if she went on at the present rate; he warned the British ambassador in Berlin Eric Phipps to <b>be</b> <b>suspicious</b> <b>of</b> the Nazis.|$|E

25|$|In {{accordance}} with his father's wishes, Luther enrolled {{in law school}} at the same university that year but dropped out almost immediately, believing that law represented uncertainty. Luther sought assurances about life and was drawn to theology and philosophy, expressing particular interest in Aristotle, William of Ockham, and Gabriel Biel. He was deeply influenced by two tutors, Bartholomaeus Arnoldi von Usingen and Jodocus Trutfetter, who taught him to <b>be</b> <b>suspicious</b> <b>of</b> even the greatest thinkers and to test everything himself by experience.|$|E

Alan Code wrote that Williams had never been [...] "impressed by the display of mere dialectical cleverness, least of all in moral philosophy": ...|$|R

25|$|Meanwhile, Brother Mouzone captures Dante, {{and forces}} him to reveal Omar's hiding place. Dante gives in, in {{contrast}} with Brandon, who never cracked. Mouzone suggests an alliance against Stringer. Together, Omar and Mouzone ambush Stringer during a meeting with Andy Krawczyk and murder him. Brother Mouzone sets Dante free and returns to New York, while Omar is tasked with disposing of Mouzone's gun, {{as well as the}} shotgun that killed Stringer. Both weapons are later thrown into the harbor. Omar is shown to <b>be</b> <b>suspicious</b> <b>of</b> the severity of Dante's injuries and his release by Mouzone is the last time he is seen; it is implied that Omar left him for giving him up so easily.|$|E
25|$|Discussion of {{the racial}} {{elements}} of the case continued long after the trial's end. Some polls and some commentators have concluded that many blacks, while having their doubts as to Simpson's innocence, were more inclined to <b>be</b> <b>suspicious</b> <b>of</b> the credibility and fairness of {{the police and the}} courts, and thus more likely to question the evidence. The LAPD had a history of abusing African Americans in the city, which was emphasized in the Rodney King case. After the civil trial verdict against Simpson, most whites surveyed said they believed justice had been served. Most blacks (75%) disagreed with the verdict and believed that it was racially motivated. An NBC poll taken in 2004 reported that, although 77% of 1,186 people sampled thought Simpson was guilty, only 27% of blacks in the sample believed so, compared to 87% of whites. The Simpson case continues to be assessed through the lens of race. In 2016, FiveThirtyEight reported that most black people now think O.J. was guilty.|$|E
25|$|Sailors {{had lost}} their trust in their {{officers}}, who tended to <b>be</b> <b>suspicious</b> <b>of</b> each other as well. Navy officers from the French Royal Navy of the Ancien Régime, the officiers rouges, openly despised the new social order {{brought about by the}} French First Republic, and were particularly frustrated by the lack of discipline generated by the philosophy of égalité, as highly detrimental to the organisation of the Navy. Nevertheless, some of these officers, the first of them Morard de Galles, were actually dedicated to the Republic and its egalitarian principles – all the more, in fact, since they hoped that the advent of the Republic would fill the authority void caused by the collapse of the monarchy. Others, such as Kerguelen or Lemarant-Boissauveur, had suffered humiliations from the naval establishment of the Ancien Régime, doubling the republican loyalty of their political convictions with personal resentment against the old order. Rear-admiral Landais would carry revolutionary fervour and suspicion to the point of denouncing Lelarge and Morard de Galles as suspect, and be considered as paranoid by Jeanbon Saint-André.|$|E

500|$|In Present-day Boston, Emma Swan (Morrison) lives {{a lonely}} {{existence}} {{working as a}} bail bondsman and bounty hunter. She is approached by a ten-year-old boy, Henry (Jared S. Gilmore), who identifies himself as her son, whom she had given up for adoption as a teenager. Not wanting a relationship with him, Emma agrees to drive {{him back to his}} home in Storybrooke, Maine. Along the way, Henry shows her a large book of fairy tales he has, insisting that all of the stories in it are real. When they arrive in Storybrooke, Henry informs her that everyone in town is in reality a fairy tale character, exiled by the curse and with no memory of their real identities. This includes his therapist Archie Hopper (Raphael Sbarge), who is really Jiminy Cricket, and his teacher Mary Margaret Blanchard (Goodwin), who is really Snow White. Henry claims that time is frozen in Storybrooke and the people are unable to leave, but that the curse will be broken by Emma. A skeptical Emma returns Henry to his adopted mother, the town Mayor, Regina (Parrilla), who is really the Evil Queen. Emma attempts to leave but after having drunk apple cider given to her by the Mayor and nearly hitting a wolf she has a car accident where she is knocked out. She is arrested and taken to Storybrooke Jail. When Henry runs away again, Emma makes a deal with the Mayor and Sheriff Graham (Jamie Dornan): if they release her, she will find him. After exhausting all possibilities she speaks with Mary Margaret, who tells Emma to [...] "Check his castle." [...] After finding Henry at a wooden jungle gym (which bears a resemblance to Prince Charming's castle), they talk and Emma decides to stay in Storybrooke temporarily, especially after Regina warns her to leave town. This leads Emma to <b>be</b> <b>suspicious</b> <b>of</b> the mayor's motives.|$|E

2500|$|Former {{legislative}} colleague Ron Gomez described Gunter {{as having}} what urban people call [...] "street smarts, that innate ability, also common to many rural folk, to smell a phony an acre away, to <b>be</b> <b>suspicious</b> <b>of</b> everyone who didn't dress or talk {{like him and}} to cut {{to the heart of}} a matter with cold precision. His politics were populist in nature. He was regularly graded high by organized labor and low by business and professional associations", such as the Louisiana Association of Business and Industry. Gomez said that he and Gunter did not become friends but [...] "shared a mutual respect. Whether I shared Carl's beliefs or he disliked the way I talked, we realized that we both got to the House the same way and for the same reason: we were there to represent the people of our respective districts. I hoped that all {{the other members of the}} House practiced that philosophy." ...|$|E
2500|$|Peter David writes Captain America: The Winter Soldier Infinite Comic, {{with art}} by Rock-He Kim. The comic was {{published}} on January 28, 2014, and sees David set up key themes for Captain America: The Winter Soldier: [...] "Black Widow and Rumlow...They're okay with doing what they're told. Cap, however, is way more suspicious and wants a clearer idea of what's going on, and is annoyed that S.H.I.E.L.D. isn't big on being forthcoming." [...] On Cap's relationships with new partners Black Widow and Brock Rumlow, [...] "I think {{he sees her}} as a valued ally, but [...] tends to <b>be</b> <b>suspicious</b> <b>of</b> the outfit that she works for. He trusts her as someone to have his back in a fight, but I think also believes that if S.H.I.E.L.D. told her to put a knife in his back, she would do so without hesitation, {{and that can be}} problematic. Rumlow, meantime, is an eager partner, but Cap doesn't trust him at all. First, there's the suspicion aspect. And second, I think Cap is still gun-shy because {{the last time he had}} a partner. Bucky wound up dying—or at least so he believes—and he's not anxious for history to repeat itself." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{president}} of the WCTU, the crux of Willard's argument for female suffrage {{was based on the}} platform of [...] "Home Protection," [...] which she described as [...] "the movement … the object of which is to secure for all women above the age of twenty-one years the ballot as one means for the protection of their homes from the devastation caused by the legalized traffic in strong drink." [...] The [...] "devastation" [...] she was referencing was the prevalence of violent acts against women committed by intoxicated men, both in and outside the home. Willard argued that it was too easy for men to get away with their crimes without women's suffrage. [...] The [...] "Home Protection" [...] argument was used to garner the support of the [...] "average woman," [...] who was told to <b>be</b> <b>suspicious</b> <b>of</b> female suffragists by the patriarchal press, religious authorities, and society as a whole. The desire for home protection gave the average woman a socially appropriate avenue to seek enfranchisement. Willard insisted that women must forgo the notion that they were the [...] "weaker" [...] sex and that they must embrace their natural dependence on men. She encouraged women to join the movement to improve society: [...] "Politics is the place for woman." [...] The goal of the suffrage movement for Willard was to construct an [...] "ideal of womanhood" [...] that allowed women to fulfill their potential as the companions and counselors of men, as opposed to the [...] "incumbrance and toy of man." ...|$|E

2500|$|Guerrero teachers, {{including}} the students from Ayotzinapa, {{are known for}} their [...] "militant and radical protests that often involve hijacking buses and delivery trucks." [...] The appropriation of the vehicles was, according to the students, routine and temporary. Most of the buses are usually returned after the protests conclude. This tactic has largely been tolerated by law enforcement even though it is inconvenient for other users of public transport. Though federal agents tend not to actively confront students when they [...] "borrow" [...] buses, the practice puts students and teachers at odds with local officials. Other protest tactics used by the students include throwing rocks at police officers, blocking roads, and stealing property. Students claim those tactics are {{the only way to get}} attention and earn funds from the government. Local authorities in Guerrero tend to <b>be</b> <b>suspicious</b> <b>of</b> student protests because they suspect them of having ties with leftist guerrillas or rival political groups. In 1995, the Guerrero state police killed 17 farmers and injured 21 others when they were carrying out a protest. The massacre led to the creation of the Popular Revolutionary Army (Spanish: Ejército Popular Revolucionario), which is believed by some state officials to retain some political influence in Guerrero. Students claim to have no ties with such groups, and that the only thing they have in common with them is their socialist ideology. In addition, in places like Guerrero, where the bus companies are assumed to pay protection money, the student campaigns are seen as threatening to organized crime.|$|E
