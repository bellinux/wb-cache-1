40|$|<b>Breathing</b> <b>Time</b> Buckets and Time Warp are two {{different}} approaches to optimistic parallel discrete event simulation. To explore their relative performance we ran two simple simulations using transputer-based implementations of the two algorithms. To exercise the two implementations thoroughly, we varied {{the value of the}} following parameters for one of the simulations, a queuing network: the number of objects involved; the granularity of events; and the distance into the future that the new events are scheduled. Both simulators provide speedup. The <b>Breathing</b> <b>Time</b> Buckets algorithm can perform better than the Time Warp based simulator for most cases. However, this latter behaves more consistently as it is not affected by either the distance into the future that new events are scheduled, nor by the network topology used. On the other hand, the performance of <b>Breathing</b> <b>Time</b> Buckets is sensitive to both of these parameters. INTRODUCTION The most important principle that is encountered in [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Synchronous Parallel Environment for Emulation and Discrete-Event Simulation (SPEEDES) is {{a unified}} {{parallel}} simulation environment. It supports multiple-synchronization protocols without requiring users to recompile their code. When a SPEEDES simulation runs on one node, all the extra parallel overhead is removed automatically at run time. When the same executable runs in parallel, the user preselects the synchronization algorithm {{from a list}} of options. SPEEDES currently runs on UNIX networks and on the California Institute of Technology/Jet Propulsion Laboratory Mark III Hypercube. SPEEDES also supports interactive simulations. Featured in the SPEEDES environment is a new parallel synchronization approach called <b>Breathing</b> <b>Time</b> Buckets. This algorithm uses some of the conservative techniques found in Time Bucket synchronization, along with the optimism that characterizes the Time Warp approach. A mathematical model derived from first principles predicts the performance of <b>Breathing</b> <b>Time</b> Buckets. Along with the <b>Breathing</b> <b>Time</b> Buckets algorithm, this paper discusses the rules for processing events in SPEEDES, describes the implementation of various other synchronization protocols supported by SPEEDES, describes some new ones for the future, discusses interactive simulations, and then gives some performance results...|$|R

40|$|Abstract:The {{study was}} {{proposed}} {{to examine the}} effect of fartlek training on cardiorespiratory endurance, <b>breathe</b> holding <b>time,</b> and pulse rate. To achieve this purpose of the study, thirty male students of SMSS Government Boys Higher Secondary School, Shengottai, were randomly selected, in the age group of fourteen to sixteen years. The selected subjects were divided into two groups. Group I underwent fartlek training programme for twelve weeks and they designated as experimental group. Group II is the control group, which does not undergo any type of systematic training programme during the period of study. The study was restricted to the appraisal of cardiorespiratory endurance, <b>breathe</b> holding <b>time,</b> and resting pulse rate prior to and after experimentation. The pre and post test data of both the groups thus collected were statistically examined by applying analysis of covariance. The outcome of the study demonstrates that statistically significant improvement on cardiorespiratory endurance, while <b>breathe</b> holding <b>time</b> and resting pulse rate were not evolved. It implies that undergoing fartlek training programme confined to this study is worthy enough to enhance cardiorespiratory endurance, but not on <b>breathe</b> holding <b>time</b> and resting pulse rate...|$|R

The second-half to first-half split <b>time</b> <b>quotient</b> was calculated as a crude assessment {{of the degree of}} positive or negative pacing, and repeated measures of 2 -km split time intervals were used to locate onset and extent of performance fatigability. For a clearer graphical presentation, dynamics in perceived fatigability were further indicated by the percentage increase in split times during ITT compared to CTT and accordingly assessed via one-way repeated measures ANOVA.|$|R
