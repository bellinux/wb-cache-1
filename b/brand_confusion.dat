40|$|This study investigates {{consumer}} ethnocentrism, brand equity, <b>brand</b> origin <b>confusion</b> {{and customer}} involvement’s impact on purchase intentions between domestic and import shampoo brands amongst Chinese and Greek consumers. It seeks to validate a new measurement scale–CEESCALE and test political event’s influence on consumer ethnocentrism. Street surveys {{were conducted in}} Guangzhou and Athens {{with a total of}} 257 and 211 questionnaires collected respectively. Regression analysis and structural equation modeling were employed for the data analysis. The findings validate the CEESCALE as a reliable multidimensional scale to measure consumer ethnocentrism in China and Greece. The sub-dimensional impact of consumer ethnocentrism on purchase intentions varied between Chinese and Greek consumers. Compare to consumer ethnocentrism, product involvement and <b>brand</b> origin <b>confusions,</b> <b>brand</b> equity’s effect on purchase intentions are more consistent. Political event only strengthened Chinese consumers’ ethnocentric beliefs...|$|R

My Family's Got GUTS eventually premiered on Nickelodeon in September 2008. On August 17, 2009, Nick at Nite debuted a new stop-motion claymation series called Glenn Martin DDS, which ran for two seasons. Scripted programming returned to Nick at Nite in 2012, with the June 11 debut of the telenovela-based Hollywood Heights, followed on October 6 with the premiere of See Dad Run, though the former re-located to TeenNick midway through its run due to low ratings and <b>branding</b> <b>confusion.</b>|$|R

5000|$|The {{benefits}} of unit pricing {{have been widely}} reported in the literature. It {{has been argued that}} unit pricing reduces time spent comparing <b>brands,</b> eliminates <b>confusion</b> relating to price calculations and ultimately allows shoppers to save money at the register. Unit pricing enables the consumers to rationally evaluate the most economic package size and brand. Accordingly, the time spent determining the most economic purchase is condensed substantially, errors in product price comparisons are significantly reduced, and importantly, lower grocery shopping expenditure is attained. [...] In Australia, despite having unit pricing legislation, there were no adequate education programs to enable consumers to take advantage of unit pricing.|$|R
5000|$|This {{particular}} {{method of}} <b>branding</b> can cause <b>confusion</b> amongst Canadians.

Whilst correct, technically the name [...] "Radio-Canada" [...] refers to the television, radio and internet operations in the French-language, not just [...] "la télévision de Radio-Canada". This same confusion however can extend to CBC Television, where on-air it is branded [...] "CBC".|$|R

40|$|In China foreign brands {{are faced}} with <b>brand</b> origin <b>confusion,</b> which creates {{benefits}} for local brands. Therefore, marketers should provide information related to the COO by using not only products and promotions, but also distribution. In particular, stores could be an important starting point to communicate the brand origin and image, as they represent evidence of the brand world and a powerful setting for storytelling. In order to analyse how the COO {{has been used by}} foreign (Italian) brands in the Chinese market, we examined 45 points of sale in China to check whether Italy is somehow recalled in their hard elements or during the shopping experience by using the mystery shopping research technique. The results highlight a relatively traditional, marginal, and iconic use of the COO in a market that is new, important, and highly dynamic. Some managerial implications will be discussed...|$|R

40|$|<b>Brand</b> Image <b>Confusion</b> (BIC) {{could occur}} {{in the mind of}} the {{consumer}} when a new brand is launched with a similar brand name to that of an established brand. Brand Concept Mapping (BCM) is used to capture these changes in the established brand perception due to the launch of a new brand: the dilution of attributes and the creation of unattractive associations. The authors used a 2 x 2 between-subject analyses with 867 students, to study the effect of a new brand with product category similarity (versus dissimilarity) and attribute similarity (versus dissimilarity) on the perception of Xbox. Finally they studied two moderators: brand and category expertise. The results suggest that, except when the new brand has the same category and attributes than the established brand, there is an immediate risk of BIC, which is moderated by the brand expertise. This study presents a new application of BCM and provides a new way of measuring and legally proving BIC...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effects of <b>brand</b> origin <b>confusion</b> (BOC) on consumers preference and consumers purchase likelihood of local versus foreign brands in Indonesia. Come up from country-of-origin (COO) literatures and brand origin recognition accuracy, this study would like to confirm whether there are significant effects of BOC to brand preference and purchase likelihood. It intended to describe whether BOC really affected brand preference and purchase likelihood in developing markets, such as Indonesia. Pilot study was conducted and 24 brands (12 local and 12 foreign) which exist in Indonesia were selected. One hundred and fifty respondents evaluated some variables such as brand origin, brand knowledge, brand preference, and brand purchase likelihood. For the data analysis, simple and multiple regressions were conducted. The result of this study mostly supported the hypotheses. Specifically, {{the results showed that}} in a high level of BOC, local brands are likely to have advantage and foreign brands are likely to have disadvantage. Meanwhile, brand knowledge was not found to have moderating role of BOC effect to brand preference...|$|R

40|$|This study {{specifically}} {{addresses the}} question of how associative networks contribute to brand image perception measurement to segment the market more effectively, as well as to demonstrate brand image impairment. Carried out using surveys and experimental designs, this dissertation is positioned as part of the research stream on the use of associative networks in marketing, and particularly consumer mapping. Firstly, this study provides clear arguments for using brand concept maps (BCM) as highly suitable method to capture the complete brand image and segment the market based on brand perception. Secondly, thanks to BCM, the present research provide empirical evidences on the likelihood of <b>brand</b> image <b>confusion,</b> namely the dilution of attributes and the creation of unattractive associations, {{as a result of the}} introduction of a new brand. Thirdly, BCM captures the effect of exposure to negative user-generated content on the likelihood of doppelganger brand image, namely the appearance, or reinforcement, of negative associations at the brand reputation level. This work reveals that BCM is a superior approach to measure brand image and brand reputation, compared to dyadic methods. In addition, it broadens the applications of associative networks in marketing. Moreover this research shows how consumers and competitors may influence the brand image. Besides this scientific output, this research aims in providing brand mangers with an effective method to monitor and capture brand image and brand reputation...|$|R
40|$|It is {{important}} for islands to discover their genuine competencies and capabilities {{in order to find}} their place in an evolving global economy. Economic self‐discovery, however, is difficult because exploitative mechanisms (investing in old ideas) tend to naturally dominate economic behaviour when compared to exploration mechanisms (investing in new ideas). In this paper, a brand diagnostic tool is used to distinguish islands with unique brand images from islands with relatively common brand images. Through a simulation of the mutual learning processes within the social networks of these islands, this paper shows that economic self‐discovery is facilitated in islands with strong and unique branding strategy, as a strong holistic brand frame exploration activities by reducing ambiguity and confusion. Islands with common brand images fail to strengthen their brands because of the predominance of exploitative mechanisms in their economies and as a result enter a vicious circle where increasing <b>brand</b> dilution and <b>confusion</b> blocks the exploration and discovery of new ideas...|$|R

This study examines the brand-building efforts of nine nonprofit organizations through semi-structured interviews with nonprofit employees and through the grounded theory method. Questions focused on the efforts made by nonprofit organizations to build their brands, the way nonprofit employees articulate their brand identities and images and the way nonprofit organizational culture supports or hinders brand development. Results show that one great problem facing nonprofit <b>brands</b> is public <b>confusion</b> or misunderstanding of what organizations do. It is posited that, {{in order to build}} their brands, organizations need to communicate not only who they are and what they stand for, but also what they do. This study builds on research that shows the importance of nonprofits' effectiveness and differentiation for public support and provides insight into ways in which organizations can communicate to the public what they do...|$|R

They targeted a huge section of consumers who were inexperienced using computers. Frog design gave the look of quality and utilized innovations such as color-coding cable connectors (first seen on the IBM PS/2), while Navigator provided the ability for users to launch installed programs by clicking on-screen buttons, and then later a house metaphor. During this phase, returns dropped from 19% to 10%, and sales grew exponentially.|$|E
