Constructed wetlands {{have the potential to}} remove arsenic and heavy metals, but little is known about pollutant removal efficiency and reliability of wetlands for this task. This lab-scale study investigated the use of vertical subsurface flow constructed wetlands for removing arsenic, boron, copper, zinc, iron and manganese from synthetic wastewater.

Conventional gravel media only <b>showed</b> <b>limited</b> <b>capability</b> in removing arsenic, iron, copper and zinc; and it showed virtually no capability in removing manganese and boron. In contrast, alternative wetland media: cocopeat, zeolite and limestone, demonstrated significant efficiencies – in terms of percentage removal and mass rate per m 3 of wetland volume – for removing arsenic, iron, manganese, copper and zinc; their ability to remove boron, in terms of mass removal rate, was also higher than that of the gravel media.

40|$|Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a condition, which {{develops}} {{when the}} reflux of stomach contents causes troublesome symptoms and/or complications. In patients with alarm symptoms or signs or in those refractory to antiacid therapy, it is indicated to perform instrumental tests to correctly diagnose GERD presence. Esophageal manometry is currently considered {{the gold standard}} test for the diagnosis of esophageal dysmotility. However, it has <b>shown</b> <b>limited</b> <b>capability</b> in diagnosing GERD. With the advent of high resolution manometry (HRM), more accurate evaluations of esophageal motility are now possible. Furthermore, new metrics {{have been developed to}} investigate esophagogastric junction (EGJ) morphology and function. In particular, the antireflux barrier function of EGJ can now be assessed evaluating the contraction integral of the junction. Also, transient lower esophageal relaxations can be defined more precisely with HRM. Provocative tests with multiple swallows can give additional information on peristaltic reserve. Finally, adding impedance measurement to HRM allows to detect retrograde movements (e. g. reflux) in the esophagus and to measure the baseline impedance, a novel promising metric associated to esophageal mucosal integrity.

40|$|The {{response}} to molybdenum (Mo) was {{studied in the}} metal-tolerant hydrophyte Trapa natans L. Previously, it was shown that the plant accumulates Mn in the floating lamina by means of phenolic compounds and responded with acclimation responses of the chloroplast. Since the involvement of phenolics has been proposed also in Mo resistance, we tested the response of T. natans to increasing doses (5, 50, 150, 600 μM) of Mo using the photosynthetic apparatus {{as an indicator of}} cellular stress. Only 5 μM Mo did not cause evident modifications with respect to controls. Conversely, 50 to 600 μM Mo induced progressively marked alterations of the lamina morphology. The chloroplast ultrastructure showed disorganisation of the thylakoid system, and correspondingly, the photosynthetic pigment pattern was altered with a fall-down in photosynthesis. Microspectrofluorimetry indicated alterations of photosystem II, with differences among the three cell layers (first and second palisade and spongy tissues). While the highest dose caused plant death, 50 and 150 μM Mo-treated plants underwent partial recovery, and the plant survived up {{to the end of the}} vegetative season. However, reproduction was unsuccessful. Mo treatment did not induce increase in total phenolics, but only in anthocyanin. In contrast to Mn, detoxification of Mo by chelation inside vacuoles, possibly by anthocyanins, is suggested to be an insufficient mechanism to reduce Mo toxicity, which probably includes an impairement of nitrogen metabolism. However, the metal was accumulated in the lamina. On the whole, T. natans <b>showed</b> <b>limited</b> <b>capabilities</b> to survive Mo excess as compared with Mn...|$|R

We recently developed a second generation of stable TazMan, but the anti-adhesive effect was lower than the first.

Consequently, we developed NeoTazMan homologated with a methylene group for low-pH and mannosidase stability with a conserved NH group and bearing various heterocyclic aglycones.

The kinetics of solvent diffusion were determined by weight uptake and NMR imaging, the effect of absorbed solvent on thermal behaviour was investigated by dynamic mechanical analysis and differential scanning calorimetry and the morphology of TPI exposed to solvent was determined by wide-angle X-ray scattering. The tensile properties of amorphous and crystalline TPI were measured before and after exposure to solvent. Amorphous TPI absorbed significant quantities of some solvents that lowered the T-g, but none were sufficiently plasticising to induce crystallisation at room temperature. There was a direct correlation between the extent of solvent ingress and the environmental stress cracking behaviour of amorphous TPI. Crystalline TPI absorbed only small quantities of all the solvents used, <b>but</b> <b>showed</b> <b>limited</b> environmental stress cracking resistance. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.
