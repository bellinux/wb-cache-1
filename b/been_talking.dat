5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{psychological}} profile, the Garda broadcast an appeal for information on the RTÉ television programme Crimeline with a request for people whose houses had been broken into in the Grangegorman area to contact them. After interviewing a number of people involved in burglary, they discovered that Dean Lyons had <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> about the killings. Lyons matched the facial composite released by the gardaí and he was questioned on 26 July 1997.|$|E
5|$|Michael Scott (Steve Carell) {{is waiting}} {{in a hotel}} bar for his {{replacement}} Deangelo Vickers (Will Ferrell) to show up. While waiting, he meets {{a man at the}} bar and the two instantly hit it off. When Michael calls Vickers to see where he is, it is revealed that the man Michael has <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> to is actually Deangelo, though it takes the two some time to actually realize this.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the episode, Jack has <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> to Rose Nadler (L. Scott Caldwell). Rose's husband, Bernard Nadler (Sam Anderson), was in {{the tail}} section of the plane in the bathroom. He, {{along with the rest}} of the tail section's passengers, is {{believed}} by the survivors to be dead, but Rose is convinced that he is alive and that the tail section of the plane thinks that the middle section is dead.|$|E
30|$|The Poisson model {{indicates}} {{that the number of}} segments when students <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>is</b> not different for CoP instructors while controlling for other factors (p =. 52). However, CoP instructors were less likely to have no segments where students <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> (p =. 01). Instructor rank was not related to the number of segments when students <b>were</b> <b>talking.</b> The number of segments when students <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>was</b> 1.6 [1.1, 2.2] times lower for assistant professors (p <. 01); however, there was no difference for associate or full professors (p =. 33). The number of segments when students <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>is</b> not different for foundational courses (p =. 07). Course size was not related to the number of segments when students <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> (p =. 52).|$|R

5000|$|During a Frontline {{interview}} {{describing the}} former president's ascendance {{into the national}} political arena, McKinnon said, [...] "Governor Bush was doing some things that really got my attention. He <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> about education reform. He <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> about immigration reform. He <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> about issues that had typically been Democratic issues. He <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> about them in a really compassionate way." [...] McKinnon {{said that he was}} particularly [...] "impressed with how he'd gotten ahead of the Republican Party".|$|R
5|$|Michael {{is trying}} to juggle his lives in the two realities, and wears a red {{wristband}} on his wrist in the reality where Hannah is alive and a green one in the reality where Rex is alive. In the Rex, or green, reality, Michael has noticed that Rex has focused a lot on tennis lately, as it was his mother's sport. Rex's tennis coach Tara (Michaela McManus) has <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> with Rex lately about his feelings. In the Hannah, or red, reality, Hannah {{is trying to}} write the late Rex out of their lives, wanting to move and try for another child.|$|E
5|$|The {{group had}} been rehearsing regularly, overseen by McLaren's friend Bernard Rhodes, and had {{performed}} publicly {{for the first}} time. Soon after McLaren's return, Nightingale {{was kicked out of}} the band and Jones, uncomfortable as frontman, took over guitar duties. According to journalist and former McLaren employee Phil Strongman, around this time the band adopted the name QT Jones and the Sex Pistols (or QT Jones & His Sex Pistols, as one Rhodes-designed T-shirt put it). McLaren had <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> with the New York Dolls' Sylvain Sylvain about coming over to England to front the group.|$|E
5|$|The sheriff {{finds the}} wolf in the woods, {{and when he}} whistles, the wolf goes to him. As he pets the wolf's head, he sees himself holding a knife, about to hurt the woman he only knows as Mary Margaret. Graham pays a visit to her classroom, telling her that he {{believes}} they know each other from another life, before Storybrooke. Mary Margaret assumes that the sheriff has <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> to Henry, and while {{this is not the}} case, this gives Graham the idea to consult Henry about his book. Meanwhile, at the sheriff's office, Regina shows up and warns Emma to stay away from Graham, apparently jealous of his connection with Emma.|$|E

5|$|Animals {{eventually}} follow Evan to Congress. When Long discovers this, {{he allows}} Evan latitude at first, but warns {{him that he}} will no longer tolerate it if it happens again in the future. Meanwhile, Evan's staffers are outraged by his change of appearance and behavior. When Evan returns to the ark during construction, God presents him with a robe, and later tells Evan that the flood will likely come at mid-day on September 22. When Joan becomes suspicious of his behavior, Evan tells her the truth: God has <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> to him and is responsible for his new look and recent actions, although Joan does not believe Evan and is convinced that he is beginning to lose his mind. After wearing the robe for some time, Evan finds it comfortable, but he soon realizes that God will not allow him {{to take it off}} and wear anything else after two failed attempts to change his clothes later. The next time Evan arrives at Congress for work, animals follow him once again and he is mysteriously changed into his robe halfway through the session. Evan reluctantly explains his divine mission, although Long does not take him seriously, and Evan is fired from Congress and later removed his name from the Public Land Act bill. Evan deduces that God purposely had him fired from Congress, so that he would have more time to build the ark. In continued skepticism, Joan leaves Evan alone after believing that he was going insane.|$|E
5|$|Rhys treats Susan {{when she}} has an MS relapse and he tries {{to make sure she}} is {{prepared}} in case her condition becomes worse. He later looks after Vanessa Villante (Alin Sumarwata) when she is brought in with severe morning sickness. Vanessa learns Rhys has <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> about her with his friends and she tells him to stay out of her business. Rhys later helps Vanessa carry some boxes and he spends the day baking a cake with her. He buys her a new mixer and Vanessa invites him to dinner. Rhys gives the cake to Elaine and when he tells her about Vanessa, she warns him to think about what he is doing before letting it go any further. Rhys thinks about cancelling on Vanessa, but he later arrives with dessert. Rhys asks Vanessa to bid on him at a charity bachelor auction, so he can raise more money than Karl. Vanessa wins and she chooses a couples massage for them to enjoy together. Rhys learns Susan has befriended Elaine and he angrily tells her to stay away from his mother. Vanessa witnesses the scene and becomes cold towards him. Rhys apologises to Susan and opens up to Vanessa about why he did it.|$|E
5|$|Sources {{indicate}} that executive producer Steve Jobs lacked {{confidence in the}} film during its production, and he had <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> to various companies, ranging from Hallmark to Microsoft, about selling Pixar. However, as the film progressed, Jobs became ever more excited about it, feeling {{that he might be}} on the verge of transforming the movie industry. As scenes from the movie were finished, he watched them repeatedly and had friends come by his home to share his new passion. Jobs decided that the release of Toy Story that November would be the occasion to take Pixar public. A test audience near Anaheim in late July 1995 indicated the need for last-minute tweaks, which added further pressure to the already frenetic final weeks. Response cards from the audience were encouraging, but were not top of the scale, adding further question as to how audiences would respond. The film ended with a shot of Andy's house and the sound of a new puppy. Michael Eisner, who attended the screening, told Lasseter afterward that the film needed to end with a shot of Woody and Buzz together, reacting to the news of the puppy.|$|E

60|$|Yet this {{universal}} language has not succeeded, {{at a moment}} of crisis, in imposing itself on the whole world. Nay, it has not, at the moment of crisis, succeeded in imposing itself on its own principal champions. Herve <b>is</b> not <b>talking</b> Economic Esperanto; he <b>is</b> <b>talking</b> French. Bebel <b>is</b> not <b>talking</b> Economic Esperanto; he <b>is</b> <b>talking</b> German. Blatchford <b>is</b> not <b>talking</b> Economic Esperanto; he <b>is</b> <b>talking</b> English, and jolly good English, too. I do not know whether French or Flemish was Vandervelde's nursery speech, but I am quite certain he will know more of it after this struggle than he knew before. In short, whether or no there be a new union of hearts, there has really and truly been a new division of tongues.|$|R
25|$|Before {{starting}} The Hackensaw Boys, Sickmen and Peloso had <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> {{about other}} possible music projects. The four founding members decided {{to form an}} old-time music group — infused with the energy and spirit of punk rock — while attending an early performance of Old Crow Medicine Show at the much-storied Miller's Restaurant in Charlottesville.|$|E
25|$|But Bob Johnson's health {{prevented}} him from playing live shortly before the 2002 comeback tour, and he was replaced at the eleventh hour on guitar by Ken Nicol, formerly of the Albion Band.

25|$|The {{case had}} first been brought by Cheryl Churchill, {{a nurse in}} the {{obstetrics}} ward at McDonough District Hospital, operated {{by the city of}} Macomb, Illinois. During a dinner break one night in early 1987, she had <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> with another nurse who was considering transferring to obstetrics. In that conversation she made statements critical of cross-training practices recently implemented by the hospital's nursing supervisor, Cindy Waters, and referred to personal issues between the two. Another nurse who overheard the conversation believed Churchill's comments about Waters had dissuaded her interlocutor from the transfer, and reported it to Waters. After an investigation in which Churchill alleged she was never asked about what she had said, she was fired.|$|E
25|$|The latter {{incident}} proved counter-productive to the Argentine sovereignty push, as Lord Chalfont had <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> to {{a public}} meeting {{at the time of}} the plane's arrival. The islanders made it plain to Lord Chalfont that they rejected a Memorandum of Agreement negotiated between Britain and Argentina that August which stated that Britain was prepared to discuss sovereignty provided the islanders' wishes were respected. This spurred the formation of the Falkland Islands Committee by London barrister Bill Hunter-Christie and others. The Emergency Committee, as it became known, proved to be an effective lobbying organisation, constantly undermining Foreign Office initiatives on sovereignty negotiations. In December 1968, the lobbying effort managed to force the British Government to state that the islanders' wishes would be paramount.|$|E
25|$|In the 2007–08 season, Kidd {{became the}} third player {{to get a}} triple-double in three {{straight}} games since 1989. He did so after he logged his 97th career triple-double in a 115–99 loss to the Charlotte Bobcats. Kidd was voted by the fans to start in the 2008 All-Star game in New Orleans as a guard along with Dwyane Wade. During that season Kidd had been mentioned in trade rumors, notably to the Los Angeles Lakers, but the deal fell through when the Lakers {{refused to give up}} their young center Andrew Bynum. On January 28, 2008, Kidd revealed that his agent had <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> to the Nets' front office about a trade. On February 19, 2008, Kidd was traded to the Dallas Mavericks, the team that originally drafted him.|$|E
