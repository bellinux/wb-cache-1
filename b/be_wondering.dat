500|$|StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty {{has been}} met with {{critical}} acclaim since its release. It received an aggregated score of 92.39% at GameRankings and 93/100 at Metacritic. The game was particularly praised for retaining the popular RTS gameplay from StarCraft, while introducing new features and improved storytelling. GamesRadar felt that [...] "in many ways, StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty feels like StarCraft 2.0 – and that’s a good thing", stating that it [...] "delivers on all fronts". NZGamer.com said {{the game was}} [...] "the best RTS game released in years {{and one of the}} best games on PC". In relation to its story, GameTrailers stated, [...] "If there's anything immediately apparent from Wings of Liberty's story, it's that the series' narrative structure has evolved well beyond the original's sparse between-sortie intermissions," [...] calling it [...] "an epic and entertainingly told yarn", while Eurogamer criticized the dialogue as being [...] "flat" [...] and the characters as being [...] "either clichéd, banal or both". Giant Bomb echoed this view while also noting the Hyperion portion between missions, finding it to have [...] "more depth of character, more believable pathos, more surprise twists—than I honestly expected out of the story". IGN however noted that [...] "no doubt franchise fans will eat it up, but newcomers may <b>be</b> <b>wondering</b> what all the fuss is about while going through the early missions that lack the kind of urgency you would hope when the fate of civilization is in peril." ...|$|E
500|$|IGN {{contributor}} Robert Canning {{called it}} a [...] "fantastic episode" [...] and rated it 8 out of 10.

TV Guides Matt Mitovich was favorable to the guest appearances of Reubens, Rossellini, and Will Forte, but said that Reubens's role [...] "served up a memorable majesty on a very strong, very laugh-out-loud funny installment" [...] of this episode. Mitovich was impressed with how [...] "Black Tie" [...] handled Liz's [...] "date" [...] with Jack, citing that lesser shows would have [...] "gone there" [...] in the final scene, [...] "and really jacked up the 'tension' between its two leads, but Tina Fey and her crack writing staff didn't. They kept it 99.44 percent light, meaning we now won't... <b>be</b> <b>wondering,</b> 'What if...?'" [...] {{in regard to the}} episode itself, Mitovich said it was an [...] "awesome episode, an immeasurably enjoyable, laugh-inducing series." [...] Seattle Post-Intelligencer contributor Melanie McFarland said that Reubens was [...] "perfectly cast as such a freak", though in regard to Rossellini's appearance [...] "he glides in playing the class act we're used to, but when Rossellini dissolves into a shocking mess, she yields one of the series' most absurd scenes yet." [...] It was rated the 28th greatest TV episode of all time on TV Guide's list.|$|E
