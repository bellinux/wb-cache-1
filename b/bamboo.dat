5|$|Classifications in {{the first}} half of the 20th century divided lemurs into three families: Daubentoniidae, Indriidae, and Lemuridae, with the latter {{including}} the current Cheirogaleidae and Lepilemuridae. Because of concerns that Lemuridae might not be monophyletic, the family was later split; in 1982 Tattersall separated the Cheirogaleidae for the dwarf lemurs, mouse lemurs and relatives, and the Lepilemuridae for the sportive lemurs and <b>bamboo</b> lemurs (including the greater <b>bamboo</b> lemur). This classification is still used, except that the <b>bamboo</b> lemurs were moved back to Lemuridae.|$|E
5|$|Fu: Fu were Chinese tally sticks made of <b>bamboo,</b> wood, metal (gold, silver, bronze) or jade {{and used}} as a proof of authorization. Most commonly, fu were made of wood or <b>bamboo</b> in sizes of wooden slips or <b>bamboo</b> chopsticks. Although fu {{have been made in}} various shapes (such as tiger, dragon, turtle, snake, fish or human), most of them come {{in the shape of a}} tiger. Classical {{description}} of tallies is found in the Zhou li, which refers to the tallies of jade and horn, and mentions the shapes of tiger, human, dragon, seal, and banner.|$|E

The woody <b>bamboos</b> do not form a monophyletic group; instead, the tropical woody and herbaceous <b>bamboos</b> are sister to the temperate woody <b>bamboos.</b> Altogether, more than 1,400 species {{are placed in}} 115 genera.|$|R
40|$|The {{fact that}} <b>bamboo’s</b> construction, with the {{advantage}} it’s tensile {{strength in the}} fiber direction, is reliable when the earthquake occurs increased the use <b>bamboo’s</b> in earthquake-resistant construction. <b>Bamboo’s</b> construction has a weakness in the connection system caused by the dimentional variations. Researches {{on the design of}} the connection system produce various <b>bamboo’s</b> connection system designs, but the lack of literature on mechanical properties (tensile strength, bending, shear, fracture and dynamics) of <b>bamboo’s</b> connection system went hard with the designer. The analysis of construction strength shows that dynamics load is more dangerous than statics load. The design of mechanical system of dynamics model tester for the connection system of <b>bamboo’s</b> construction intended to obtain the dynamic characteristics of the connection system of the <b>bamboo’s</b> construction. Dynamic load will be very dangerous if it vibrates at the same frequency / close to the natural frequency of connection system of <b>bamboo’s</b> construction. So the test should be conducted in the natural frequency of connection system of <b>bamboo’s</b> construction. Dynamics load is resulted from the centrifugal force of the unbalance mass on the two twin gears...|$|R

5|$|In the 1st {{millennium}} BC, typical ancient Chinese writing {{materials were}} bronzewares, animal bones, and <b>bamboo</b> slips or wooden boards.

5|$|Lemurs {{have either}} {{presently}} or formerly filled the ecological niches normally occupied by monkeys, squirrels, woodpeckers, and grazing ungulates. With {{the diversity of}} adaptations for specific ecological niches, habitat selections among lemur families and some genera are often very distinct, thus minimizing competition. In nocturnal lemurs from the more seasonal forests in the west, up to five species can coexist during the wet season due to high food abundance. However, to endure the extreme dry season, {{three of the five}} species utilize different dietary patterns and their underlying physiological traits to allow them to coexist: fork-marked lemurs feed on tree gum, sportive lemurs feed on leaves, and giant mouse lemurs sometimes feed on insect secretions. The other two species, the gray mouse lemur and the fat-tailed dwarf lemur (Cheirogaleus medius), avoid competition through reduced activity. The gray mouse lemur uses bouts of torpor, while the fat-tailed dwarf lemur hibernates completely. Similarly, on the east coast entire genera focus on specific food to avoid too much niche overlap. True lemurs and ruffed lemurs are frugivorous, indriids are folivorous, and <b>bamboo</b> lemurs specialize in <b>bamboo</b> and other grasses. Once again, seasonal dietary differences as well as subtle differences in substrate preferences, forest strata used, activity cycle, and social organization enable lemur species to coexist, although this time the species are more closely related and have similar niches. A classic example involves resource partitioning between three species of <b>bamboo</b> lemur that live in close proximity in small forested areas: the golden <b>bamboo</b> lemur, the greater <b>bamboo</b> lemur, and the eastern lesser <b>bamboo</b> lemur (Hapalemur griseus). Each utilizes either different species of <b>bamboo,</b> different parts of the plant, or different layers in the forest. Nutrient and toxin content (such as cyanide) help regulate food selection, though seasonal food preferences are also known to play a role.|$|E

50|$|The {{two main}} types of <b>bamboos</b> are clumpers and running <b>bamboos.</b> Clumping <b>bamboos,</b> {{such as the}} B. chungii, are noninvasive <b>bamboos</b> (sympodial or pachymorph). They have short roots and form {{discrete}} clumps. Some types of clumping <b>bamboos</b> clump more tightly than others-meaning, the culms (canes) grow closely together, omitting light from being seen through {{the other side of}} a mature species. Each new culm that shoots up is larger than the last. Growth rates vary since they depend on soil, water, nutrient, weather conditions, climate, etc. It has been successful growing in Central Florida, some areas of California, and Hawaii.|$|R
