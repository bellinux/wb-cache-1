[...] "We'd go to parties, we'd go to the clubs and we'd go to the <b>Ball</b> <b>Pump,</b> and there would be any number of these same 50 people, so it was a very tight circle of friends." [...] Peter Buck holds a similar interpretation. However, Stipe has denied that that is the topic of the song; rather, Stipe says the song is about a [...] "kind of an innocence that's either kind of desperately clung onto or obviously lost." [...] Stipe said there are autobiographical elements to the song, but insists most of it is [...] "made up." ...|$|E

50|$|For the 1965 model year, Wheel Horse Products, Inc., of South Bend, Indiana, USA, {{introduced}} the first garden tractors {{equipped with an}} hydraulic CVT. The models 875 and 1075 included an Eaton-manufactured variable-displacement swash-plate pump and fixed-displacement gear-type hydraulic motor combined into a single compact package, which attached directly to the patented Wheel Horse Unidrive™ transaxle. Reverse was produced by reversing {{the flow of the}} pump through over-centering of the swash plate. Acceleration was limited and smoothed through use of pressure accumulator and relief valves located between the pump and motor, to prevent the sudden changes in speed possible with a direct hydraulic coupling. Subsequent versions included fixed swash plate motors, and <b>ball</b> <b>pumps</b> and were sourced from both Eaton and Sundstrand Corp.|$|R
40|$|NASA has {{recently}} {{developed a new}} piezoelectric actuator, the Radial Field Diaphragm or RFD. This actuator uses a radially-directed electric field to generate concentric out-of-plane (Z-axis) motion that allows this packaged device {{to be used as}} a pump or valve diaphragm. In order to efficiently use this new active device, experimental determination of pressure, flow rate, mechanical work, power consumption and overall efficiency needs to be determined by actually building a pump. However, without an optimized pump design, it is difficult to assess the quality of the data, as these results are inherent to the actual pump. Hence, separate experiments must be conducted in order to generate independent results to help guide the design criteria and pump quality. This paper focuses on the experiments used to generate the RFD’s operational parameters and then compares these results to the experimentally determined results of several types of <b>ball</b> <b>pumps.</b> Also discussed are how errors are inherently introduced into the experiments, the pump design, experimental hardware and their effects on the overall system efficiency...|$|R

This abolishes the so-called [...] "tuck rule" [...] which was adopted prior to the [...] season.

40|$|Abstract: The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} are to measure the ball recovery rate of cleaning apparatus for plate heat exchanger. Ceramic ball is used for plate heat exchanger cleaning. The main components of cleaning apparatus are comprised of ball collector, <b>ball</b> trap, ejector, <b>pump</b> and plate heat exchanger. The ball recovery rate are obtained with change in recovery time and velocity of water. The results show that the ball recovery rate is slightly increased with increase in the recovery time and the velocity of water over 0. 4 m/s in the straight flow. In the case of reverse flow, the ball recovery rate more increased than straight flow. The maximum ball recovery rate of the straight flow and reverse flow reach 83. 97 % an...|$|R
5000|$|New {{features}} were implemented for Microsoft Windows, Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions. Pitching had been simplified from 2K8 to [...] "2-step pitching", with [...] "hold and gesture", eliminating the third [...] "Release Timing" [...] step of 2K8, simplifying the motion while retaining the style. [...] "Meatballs" [...] (mistake pitches) {{have been removed}} - instead, badly released pitches will be less effective (fastballs will be straighter, curveballs will hang, and so forth.) The AI's pitch selection was also improved. (Players may elect to use the third step as an option, and users may also still use the older Precision Pitching from 2K7.) [...] "Influence hitting" [...] allowed users to control fly and ground balls, and bunt with improved precision. The developers added a zone hitting feature, improved hit distribution, and improved fielding realism and AI. Also added {{is the ability to}} cancel a throw and hold the <b>ball,</b> or <b>pump</b> fake during a rundown. A player can also attempt a [...] "Quick Throw" [...] which gets the ball to a base faster but also increases the chance of an error. Baserunning control has been simplified; a player only needs to hold down the trigger until it vibrates, for instance, then release it when ready to attempt a steal. There are also separate [...] "Steal" [...] and [...] "Speed" [...] ratings for runners.|$|R
5000|$|The {{patented}} process uses sponge rubber balls which are {{injected into the}} cooling water flow (1) before it enters into the condenser. The diameter of the cleaning balls is only slightly bigger than the nominal diameter of the condenser tubing. Due to their elasticity they generate a contact pressure on {{their way through the}} condenser tubes by which fouling is removed from the inner tube walls. At the condenser outlet a strainer (2) is installed in the connecting pipe which separates the balls from the water flow and feeds them into a DN 80 pipe. From there the <b>balls</b> are <b>pumped</b> back to their starting point by a 4 kW impeller pump via a DN 80 pipe. To inject the balls into the cycle, a pressure vessel with detachable cover is installed downstream of the pump. This so-called collector (3b) is equipped with a screen and a [...] At open flap, the balls can pass and with closed flap they remain in the collector and can be replenished or exchanged. The process works continuously and the tubes remain free of mud, algae, bacteria and scaling. The operation of the system is ed via sight glasses and electronic measuring instruments. The screen surfaces are arranged on shafts with pivoted bearings and can be turned on demand to have fouling removed by the water flow. In this process the balls are caught in the collector. This time-consuming procedure is automatized (3c), gear motors (M) operate the relevant actuators. The minal diameters of the screens have been adjusted to respond to the developments in power station technology and are produced in sizes from nominal diameter 150 mm to 3600 mm. The cleaning ball diameters range from 14 to 30 mm and filling one collector normally requires several hundred of them. However, some cleaning systems can require well over a thousand cleaning balls. The lifetime of the cleaning balls which are produced of biodegradable natural rubber is around 4 weeks.|$|R
5|$|Raising the Mary Rose meant {{overcoming}} {{a number}} of delicate problems {{that had never been}} encountered before. The raising of the Swedish warship Vasa 1959–61 was the only comparable precedent, but it had been a relatively straightforward operation since the hull was completely intact and rested upright on the seabed. It had been raised with basically the same methods as were in use in Tudor England: cables were slung under the hull and attached to two pontoons {{on either side of the}} ship which was then gradually raised and towed into shallower waters. Only one third of the Mary Rose was intact and she lay deeply embedded in mud. If the hull were raised in the traditional way, there was no guarantee that it would have enough structural strength to hold together out of water. Many suggestions for raising the ship were discarded, including the construction of a cofferdam around the wreck site, filling the ship with small buoyant objects (such as ping pong <b>balls)</b> or even <b>pumping</b> brine into the seabed and freezing it so that it would float and take the hull with it. After lengthy discussions it was decided in February 1980 that the hull would first be emptied of all its contents and strengthened with steel braces and frames. It would then be lifted to the surface with floating sheerlegs attached to nylon strops passing under the hull and transferred to a cradle. It was also decided that the ship would be recovered before the end of the diving season in 1982. If the wreck stayed uncovered any longer it risked irreversible damage from biological decay and tidal scouring.|$|R
