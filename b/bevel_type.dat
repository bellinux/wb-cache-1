40|$|A non-traction pericyclic {{continuously}} variable transmission system technology is described. Pericyclic motion involves oscillation, nutation and stepless circular pitch indexing. A kinetic prototype has been designed, fabricated and experimentally tested confirming stepless/smooth variable speed ratio capability under electro-mechanical control. This paper presents experimental results and compares key features of state-of-the-art traction (i. e., friction) based and gear/traction combination systems with proposed conceptual architectures for pericyclic {{continuously variable}} transmission systems (P-CVTs). Preferred non-traction pericyclic CVT conceptual designs are (i) high power density gearless roller/cam systems or (ii) advanced <b>bevel</b> <b>type</b> face gear systems. P-CVTs have a control system and three main components: a reaction control rotor; a pericyclic motion converter; an output rotor. Pericyclic CVTs predictably have very high operating efficiencies (i. e., 98 % or more) at fixed speed ratios, provide direct ratio reductions of at least 50 : 1 in a single stage, an...|$|E

Research completed at the Dept. of Aerospace Engineering, College of EngineeringThe results of an experimental investigationof the crush behavior, failure modes and rate sensitivity of axially compressed flat specimen made from Newport Nb 321 / 7781 composite prepregare presented in this paper. Single <b>bevel</b> <b>type</b> trigger mechanismswere used to initiate the progressive failure mechanism. Quasi-static tests and dynamic tests were conducted at load rates ranging from 10 ⁻³ in/s to 10 in/s. The influence of 45 ° bevel angle, stacking sequence and failure modes were analyzed, to examine the brittle failure mechanisms related to crash energy absorption during compression of the flat plate specimens. Results indicate that energy absorption is highly influenced by the trigger bevel angle, load rate and stacking sequence. The peak load decreased {{with an increase in}} load rate and the failure modes varied with the stacking sequence...|$|E
40|$|Background: Marginal leakage is the {{important}} factor influencing the maintenance of dental esthetic. Aim: The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the relationship between the preparation techniques and type of polymerization techniques on microleakage of composite laminate veneers. Materials and Methods: Ninety-one same sized, caries-free human maxillary central incisors were randomly assigned to 13 groups (n = 7) and were designed with four different preparation techniques (window type, feather type, <b>bevel</b> <b>type,</b> and incisal overlap type). One group determined as control group and any preparation was applied. Nanohybrid resin composite was used for restoration. Composite laminate veneers polymerized with three different techniques (direct light curing, indirect polymerization with a combination of pressure, light and heat using a light cup and heat cup, direct polymerization, and additionally heat cured in an oven). The specimens were thermocycled, and then immersed in 5 % basic fuchsine solution. Following 24 h, all specimens were immersed in 65 % nitric acid solutions for volumetric dye extraction test. Samples diluted with distilled water and centrifuged and microleakage determined by a spectrophotometer. Statistical Analysis Used: Data were analyzed with two-way ANOVA and Tukey honest significant difference post hoc multiple comparisons test (P < 0. 05). Results: For comparing the microleakage value of preparation and polymerization techniques, Window type preparation showed a significant difference in direct polymerization + additional cured group (P < 0. 05). Control group was statistically different from the other groups (P < 0. 05). Conclusions: Window type laminate preparation can be preferred in indirect polymerization technique because it caused less leakage in this present study...|$|E

40|$|Abstract- Two {{experiments}} {{were performed to}} determine the effects of friction and needle geometry during robotic needle insertion into soft tissues. In Experiment I, friction forces along the instrument axis were characterized during needle insertion into bovine liver under CT fluoroscopic imaging. Because the relative velocity of the tissue and needle affect viscous and Coulomb friction, the needle insertion process was segmented into several phases of relative motion: none, partial and complete. During the complete relative motion phase, it was found that Coulomb friction accounts for the majority of needle force. In Experiment II, insertion forces along and orthogonal to the needle axis were measured during insertion into a silicone rubber phantom with a consistency similar to liver. The effects of needle diameter and tip <b>type</b> (<b>bevel,</b> cone, and triangle) on insertion force were characterized. A bevel tip causes more needle bending and is more easily affected by tissue density variations. Forces for larger diameter needles are higher due to increased cutting and friction forces. These results may be used in the control of needle insertion for robot-assisted percutaneous therapies. I...|$|R

It means that all information for design and production could be extracted and reused at the other useful fields which need cost considerable time and efforts. The typical example is the field of welding material quantity evaluation which is demanded during the construction of ship or offshore structures. The proper evaluation of welding material to be used and the usage of them at the stage of schedule planning are mostly important to achieve the seamless process of production and costing in advance.
