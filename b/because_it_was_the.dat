The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds bought its Coombes Valley nature reserve in Staffordshire <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> only Eurasian sparrowhawk breeding site left in the English Midlands.|$|E
5|$|The Chinese dragon, {{which has}} symbolised unity of Chinese people {{since it was}} the first {{national}} emblem of unified China, is painted in multicolour on Block 15's south and north facing walls <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> 500th public housing building in Hong Kong. Block 15's distinctive imagery made it a recognisable symbol of Lam Tin and the district's unity. After demolition and reconstruction, Block 15 became part of Ping Tin Estate.|$|E
5|$|This article {{showed that}} the {{statistics}} of absorption and emission of light would only be consistent with Planck's distribution law if the emission of light into a mode with n photons would be enhanced statistically compared to the emission of light into an empty mode. This paper was enormously influential in the later development of quantum mechanics, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> first paper {{to show that the}} statistics of atomic transitions had simple laws.|$|E
50|$|For example, 5 is a {{congruent}} number <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{area of a}} 20/3, 3/2, 41/6 triangle. Similarly, 6 is a congruent number <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> area of a 3,4,5 triangle. 3 is not a congruent number.|$|R

50|$|Sachs {{explains}} {{the convergence of}} energeia and entelecheia as follows, and uses the word actuality to describe the overlap between them:Just as energeia extends to entelecheia <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> activity which makes a thing what <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> entelecheia extends to energeia <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> end or perfection which has being only in, through, and during activity.|$|R
5|$|Traversing a {{crossroads}} at night was considered dangerous <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> {{place and time}} of the ala’s supper; the unfortunate person who stepped on an “ala’s table” could become blind, deaf, or lame. Ale gather at night on the eves of greater holidays, divert men from their ways into gullies, and torture them there by riding them like horses.|$|E
5|$|After Stuart Urban {{left the}} {{production}} and the decision {{had been made to}} re-shoot some of the material that he had completed with Pedr James directing, producer Charles Pattinson suggested to Peter Flannery that the first episode should not simply be remade, but also rewritten. Flannery took the opportunity to completely change the opening storyline, introducing the love story element between Nicky and Mary earlier. This was introduced in later episodes of the television version, but had not been part of the original play. Other storyline and character changes were made with the new version of the first episode <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> script that had most closely resembled the original stage play. Michael Wearing felt that the story could be expanded to a greater degree for television.|$|E
5|$|Although Kilinochchi {{is not a}} {{strategically}} important {{location in}} terms of military operations, it bears a symbolic importance because of the LTTE using it as the de facto capital of Tamil Eelam, the separate state that the LTTE is fighting for. Vinayagamoorthy Muralitharan alias Colonel Karuna, a former commander of the LTTE, claimed that the town of Kilinochchi was important for the LTTE <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> showcase of the organization According to government claims, all civil administrative affairs were handled by government authorities despite the LTTE being {{in control of the}} town.|$|E

It was made available through EchoStar's Dish Network that June. The BabyFirst network is based in Los Angeles and was initially funded by Regency Enterprises (a Hollywood movie studio), Kardan (a holding company) and Bellco Capital (a private fund). BabyFirst was controversial when it was introduced, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> first 24-hour channel for children six months {{to three years in}} age. However, the channel was popular among parents and grew quickly.|$|E
5|$|Concorde is an {{ogival delta}} winged {{aircraft}} with four Olympus engines {{based on those}} employed in the RAF's Avro Vulcan strategic bomber. It {{is one of the}} few commercial aircraft to employ a tailless design (the Tupolev Tu-144 being another). Concorde was the first airliner to have a (in this case, analogue) fly-by-wire flight-control system; the avionics system Concorde used was unique <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> first commercial aircraft to employ hybrid circuits. The principal designer for the project was Pierre Satre, with Sir Archibald Russell as his deputy.|$|E
5|$|Early {{use of the}} NS-10 among {{engineers}} include Bob Clearmountain, Rhett Davies, and Bill Scheniman in the US, and Nigel Jopson in the UK. Clearmountain, then {{a rising}} star in record production, is often credited for {{the popularity of the}} NS-10; Phil Ward, writing in Sound on Sound, suggested that Clearmountain was probably not the earliest, but was certainly the most influential early adopter. It became a legend that Clearmountain had chosen it <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> worst speaker he could find. He was one of a new breed of creative freelance recording engineers and producers who would travel from studio to studio equipped with their own gear that included microphones, and a pair of Yamaha NS-10, as a reference.|$|E

5|$|From 1992 to 1995 Reinfeldt was the {{chairman}} of the Moderate Youth League. He ousted the former chairman Ulf Kristersson at the controversial congress known as the Battle of Lycksele, securing 58 of the delegates' votes where Kristersson gained only 55. The congress was controversial <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> culmination of a long ideological battle within the Moderate Youth League between the conservatives and the libertarians; Reinfeldt represented the conservatives and Kristersson the libertarians. Reinfeldt later stated that although the effects of that deep ideological division and battle in the party lingered on within the Moderate Youth League, he also felt that it was a defining moment in his life. Had he lost the battle he would most likely not be in politics today. From 1995 to 1997 he was chairman of the Democrat Youth Community of Europe.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, Innovation Norway criticized Nordland County Municipality, who {{administrated}} the DA-funds, {{stating that}} both the grant and load to Glimt were illegal. Therefore, both were converted to an interest-bearing loan and were issued to Aspmyra Stadion instead of the club. The club is required to have positive equity to keep its license {{to play in the}} top two tiers. <b>Because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> majority shareholder of the stadium company, it filed consolidated accounts which also include the equity of Aspmyra Stadion AS. Thus, the consequence of Innovation Norway's proceedings was that the club risked ending up with a negative equity and could be relegated to the third tier. To secure it retained a positive equity, Glimt proposed selling the venue to the municipality.|$|E
5|$|Kepler-4b {{was named}} <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> first planet {{discovered}} in the orbit of its star, Kepler-4. The star was, in turn, named for the Kepler Mission, a NASA satellite whose purpose is to discover Earth-like planets in {{a section of the}} sky between constellations Cygnus and Lyra using the transit method. Using this method, Kepler notes small and steady decreases in a star's brightness that are measured as a planet crosses in front of it. Initially, Kepler-4b was detected as a transit event by the Kepler telescope and considered a Kepler Object of Interest with the designation KOI 7.01.|$|E

5|$|Kepler-5 {{is named}} so <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> fifth planet-bearing star {{discovered}} {{during the course}} of the Kepler Mission, a NASA operation that seeks to discover Earth-like planets that transit, or cross in front of, their host stars with respect to Earth. The star's planet, Kepler-5b, was the second of the first five planets to be discovered by the Kepler spacecraft; the first three planets found by Kepler were used as tests, and had already been discovered. Kepler-5b was presented to the public on January 4, 2010 at the 215th meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Washington, D.C., along with planets around Kepler-4, Kepler-6, Kepler-7, and Kepler-8.|$|E

5|$|Located to {{the right}} of the cathedral's sacristy is the side chapel of Our Lord's Passion. Given by J.J. Braga, a parishioner from Portugal, it was rededicated to the Chinese Martyrs after the 1997–2002 renovation. The chapel was chosen out of the four to commemorate the then-newly canonised saints <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> most thematically similar, in that the martyrs gave up their lives for the faith, emulating Jesus' {{sacrifice}} to save mankind. New stained glass windows were installed depicting the saints.|$|E

5|$|Mussolini sent a warship {{to shell}} the Greek island of Corfu, and Italian forces {{occupied}} the island on 31 August 1923. This contravened the League's covenant, so Greece {{appealed to the}} League {{to deal with the}} situation. The Allies agreed (at Mussolini's insistence) that the Conference of Ambassadors should be responsible for resolving the dispute <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> conference that had appointed General Tellini. The League Council examined the dispute, but then passed on their findings to the Conference of Ambassadors to make the final decision. The conference accepted most of the League's recommendations, forcing Greece to pay fifty million lire to Italy, even though those who committed the crime were never discovered. Italian forces then withdrew from Corfu.|$|E
5|$|Operating {{through a}} cell structure, MK planned {{to carry out}} acts of {{sabotage}} that would exert maximum pressure on the government with minimum casualties; they sought to bomb military installations, power plants, telephone lines, and transport links at night, when civilians were not present. Mandela stated that they chose sabotage <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> least harmful action, did not involve killing, and offered {{the best hope for}} racial reconciliation afterwards; he nevertheless acknowledged that should this have failed then guerrilla warfare might have been necessary. Soon after ANC leader Luthuli was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, MK publicly announced its existence with 57 bombings on Dingane's Day (16 December) 1961, followed by further attacks on New Year's Eve.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> lead cruiser in the U.S. formation, Atlanta was {{the target}} of fire and torpedoes from several Japanese ships—probably {{including}} Nagara, Inazuma, and Ikazuchi—in addition to Akatsuki. The gunfire caused heavy damage to Atlanta, and a type 93 torpedo strike cut all of her engineering power. The disabled cruiser drifted into the line of fire of SanFrancisco, which accidentally fired on her, causing even greater damage. Admiral Scott and many of the bridge crew were killed. Without power and unable to fire her guns, Atlanta drifted out of control and out of the battle as the Japanese ships passed her by. The lead U.S. destroyer, Cushing, was also caught in a crossfire between several Japanese destroyers and perhaps Nagara. She too was hit heavily and stopped dead in the water.|$|E
