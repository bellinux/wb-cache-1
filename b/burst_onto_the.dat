A bright spot of the 2014 season was rookie Odell Beckham Jr., who <b>burst</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> scene {{catching}} 91 passes	on 132 targets, for 1,305 yards and 12 touchdowns, {{and in doing so}} winning Offensive Rookie of the Year.|$|E
5|$|During the night, he {{was joined}} by his relatives, {{including}} Domitian. The armies of Mucianus were nearing Rome but the besieged Flavian party did not hold out for longer than a day. On 19 December, Vitellianists <b>burst</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> Capitol and in a skirmish, Sabinus was captured and executed. Domitian managed to escape by disguising himself as a worshipper of Isis and {{spent the night in}} safety with one of his father's supporters, Cornelius Primus.|$|E
5|$|In Rome meanwhile, Domitian {{was placed}} {{under house arrest}} by Vitellius, as a {{safeguard}} against future Flavian aggression. Support for the old emperor was waning however, as more legions throughout the empire pledged their allegiance to Vespasian. On 24 October 69 the forces of Vitellius and Vespasian clashed at the Second Battle of Bedriacum, which ended in a crushing defeat for the armies of Vitellius. In despair, he attempted to negotiate a surrender. Terms of peace, including a voluntary abdication, were agreed upon with Titus Flavius Sabinus II, but the soldiers of the Praetorian Guardthe imperial bodyguardconsidered such a resignation disgraceful, and prevented Vitellius from carrying out the treaty. On the morning of 18 December, the emperor appeared to deposit the imperial insignia at the Temple of Concord, {{but at the last}} minute retraced his steps to the imperial palace. In the confusion, the leading men of the state gathered at Sabinus' house, proclaiming Vespasian Emperor, but the multitude dispersed when Vitellian cohorts clashed with the armed escort of Sabinus, who was forced to retreat to the Capitoline Hill. During the night, he was joined by his relatives, including Domitian. The armies of Mucianus were nearing Rome, but the besieged Flavian party did not hold out for longer than a day. On 19 December, Vitellianists <b>burst</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> Capitol, and in the resulting skirmish, Sabinus was captured and executed. Domitian himself managed to escape by disguising himself as a worshipper of Isis, and spent the night in safety with one of his father's supporters. By the afternoon of 20 December Vitellius was dead, his armies having been defeated by the Flavian legions. With nothing more to be feared from the enemy, Domitian came forward to meet the invading forces; he was universally saluted by the title of Caesar, and the mass of troops conducted him to his father's house. The following day, 21 December, the Senate proclaimed Vespasian emperor of the Roman Empire.|$|E

As BC 610A retreated, the Communists turned captured howitzers on Skyline Ridge despite being struck by four flights of tactical air.|$|E
25|$|Austin was {{a member}} of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives.

Austin received 5,116 votes to Democrat incumbent George Miscevich's 2,428. Austin went on to win the November 1978 general election with 12,055 votes to his Republican opponent's 3,196, in one of the largest pluralities in state legislative races that year. The Austin campaign emphasized door-to-door campaigning, local volunteers, and creative media advertising. Austin was an effective campaigner and <b>burst</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> Pittsburgh political scene quickly. He was the first full-time legislator in the 39th District and the first to open and staff a legislative office in the Mon Valley district.|$|E

25|$|He {{developed}} into Sri Lanka's fastest Test bowler {{and a regular}} member of both their Test and One Day International sides. He has earned a reputation for troubling batsmen with his lively pace and well-directed bouncer. He regularly bowls at speeds between 140 and 150km/h (87 to 93mph) and sometimes slightly faster. As time went by he started to lose pace clocking around 130 to 140km/h. His slower off cutter was also menacing. He <b>burst</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> test scene after ripping through the New Zealand top order, helping Sri Lanka draw the test series on their 2006/07 tour of New Zealand. He announced his retirement from Test cricket on 22 April 2011 in order to prolong his career in ODI and T20 cricket.|$|E

25|$|The Philadelphians again took King and his {{teammates}} to England in 1903. On this tour, the team rarely found itself outmatched. By {{the end of the}} tour, some English observers were comparing the Philadelphian team to some of the Australian sides that they had seen. One of the highlights of the tour was the win over Gloucestershire by an innings and 26 runs. This was the worst defeat ever by an American side over an English county side. The Americans back home believed that this was the country's chance to <b>burst</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> world cricket stage. Unfortunately, this was followed by a relatively poor showing in 1908. The only bright spot of this tour was Bart King's capture of the season bowling record. His record of 11.01 was not bettered until 1958 when Les Jackson of Derbyshire posted an average of 10.99.|$|E

25|$|McCollum's junior {{season in}} 1999–2000 saw him <b>burst</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> {{national}} scene {{as he finished}} third in the country in scoring at 23.8ppg. He finished 11th in three-pointers made per game (3.3) and scored 30 or more points in a game five times. He was named to the All-Independent First Team and was the Independent Conference Player of the Year runner-up. McCollum also hit back-to-back game-winning three-point shots against Southwest Texas State and Texas A. The following year—his senior season—he continued to score in high numbers and finished as the nation's leading scorer with a 29.1ppg average, which was 5.3points per game more than the second highest scorer (Eastern Illinois' Kyle Hill averaged 23.8). McCollum was an Honorable Mention All-America selection and named to the All-Independent Conference First Team. He set a school single season record with 787points, and he was selected as the 2001 Louisiana Player of the Year by the Louisiana Sports Writers Association.|$|E
25|$|The {{team that}} had been so {{successful}} in the 1990s began to break up {{at the start of}} the 2000s. Since winning their last trophy in 1998, the team has lost eight semi-finals and two finals. In 2008 Lancashire managed to finish second in the County Championship. The competition was divided into two divisions for the 2000 season, with Lancashire in the first division. Lancashire's one day form began to fluctuate in 2000, losing to Gloucestershire in the semi-finals of both the B Cup and the NatWest Trophy, and being relegated in the National League. In 2001, Lancashire avoided relegation by just 5 points and were not promoted in the National League. The end of the season saw the retirement of Ian Austin from first-class cricket and of Mike Atherton from all forms of cricket. John Crawley left the club in the winter after not being retained as captain. Between 2001 and 2002 saw the squad change significantly, with players recruited from Essex, Northamptonshire, Worcestershire, and Yorkshire; the most notable additions to the squad were Stuart Law and David Byas– the Yorkshire captain of the previous season. After a quiet 2001 season– finishing mid-table in the county championship and again failing to secure promotion in the National League– 2002 was far more encouraging. Mike Watkinson was appointed cricket manager, and Stuart Law and Alec Swann both scored over 1,000 first-class runs and Peter Martin and Glen Chapple both took more than 50wickets; the find of the season was that of James Anderson, who <b>burst</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> scene with 50wickets in the second half of the season, earning him a promotion to the England side. At the end of the season, Lancashire stalwarts Neil Fairbrother and Graham Lloyd retired.|$|E

Simon, then 25, felt he had finally [...] "made it" [...] into an upper echelon of rock and roll, while most importantly retaining artistic integrity ("making him spiritually closer to Bob Dylan than to, say, Bobby Darin", wrote biographer Marc Eliot).

It’s time for that to end. At its best, Grey’s {{has been among the}} very best shows on TV, and at its worst, it’s been at least fascinating to watch. To write it off is to unnecessarily narrow the definition of what good TV can be, to limit what the medium is capable of. TV is at its best when it emotionally connects, and even when it seems to be otherwise merrily hurtling off a cliff, Grey’s Anatomy is nothing but emotional connection, which is more than other, more consistently better shows can say." ...|$|E

[...] She argues that Dissenters deserve the same rights as any other men: [...] "We claim it as men, we claim it as citizens, we claim it as good subjects." [...] Moreover, she contends that it is precisely the isolation forced on Dissenters by others that marks them out, not anything inherent in their form of worship. Finally, appealing to British patriotism, she maintains that the French cannot be allowed to outstrip the English in liberty.|$|E
