25|$|On 27 August 1918, {{at about}} 4:10 pm, a gun battle erupted unintentionally when a {{civilian}} Mexican carpenter named Zeferino Gil Lamadrid attempted {{to pass through}} the border back to Mexico, without having the <b>bulky</b> <b>parcel</b> he was carrying with him inspected at the United States Customs house. As Gil Lamadrid passed the customs office, Customs Inspector Arthur G. Barber ordered him to halt, suspecting that Gil Lamadrid was smuggling weapons. Only a few feet away, Mexican customs officers led by Francisco Gallegos directed him to ignore the summons and stay put in Mexico. Gil Lamadrid became confused and hesitated as the two groups of customs agents shouted instructions to him. At this point Pvt. William Klint of the US 35th Infantry raised his Springfield rifle in an effort to force Gil Lamadrid to return to the US. In the midst of the ensuing commotion, a shot was fired, although by whom remains unclear, and the battle of Ambos Nogales commenced.|$|E

6000|$|The {{party were}} {{surprised}} to see the <b>bulky</b> <b>parcels</b> brought in. One of the men handed a letter addressed to Sir Ralph. [...] "Go with my retainers, my good fellows," [...] the latter said, [...] "and remain until I see what your master says. Here, Albert, my scholarship is rusty; read what the Fleming says; it may tell us what are in those crates." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{door bell}} rang again, and the waiter brought in another <b>bulky</b> <b>parcel,</b> and {{deposited}} {{it on the}} marble-topped centre table.|$|E
60|$|At {{the noted}} {{establishment}} of Messrs. Aminadab, theatrical costumiers, Barton stopped, went in, was engaged {{some time with}} the Messrs. Aminadab, and finally had a cab called for him, and drove home with a pretty <b>bulky</b> <b>parcel.</b>|$|E
60|$|Tournefort {{was after}} {{him in a}} trice. When he reached {{the corner of the}} street he saw Rateau, at the further end of it, take a sudden sharp turn to the right. But not before he had very {{obviously}} spied his pursuer, for at that moment his entire demeanour changed. An air of furtive anxiety was expressed in his whole attitude. Even at that distance Tournefort could see him clutching his <b>bulky</b> <b>parcel</b> close to his chest.|$|E
6000|$|... "He is {{a really}} good fellow," [...] went on Marlow. [...] "And his {{capacity}} for astonishment is quickly exhausted, it seems. It was in the most matter-of-fact manner that he said, `Come on board of me, then; I have here enough supper for two.' He was holding a <b>bulky</b> <b>parcel</b> in the crook of his arm. I did not wait to be asked twice, as you may guess. His cutter has a very neat little cabin, quite big enough for two men not only to sleep but to sit and smoke in. We left the scuttle wide open, of course. As to his provisions for supper, they were not of a luxurious kind. He complained that the shops in the village were miserable. There was a big village within a mile and a half. It struck me he had been very long doing his shopping; but naturally I made no remark. I didn't want to talk at all except for the purpose of setting him going." ...|$|E
6000|$|The six unhappy detectives flung {{themselves}} into cabs {{and followed the}} elephant sharing the terror which he spread through the long stretch of the streets. This time Sunday did not turn round, but offered them the solid stretch of his unconscious back, which maddened them, if possible, more than his previous mockeries. Just before they came to Baker Street, however, he was seen to throw something far up into the air, as a boy does a ball meaning to catch it again. But at their rate of racing it fell far behind, just by the cab containing Gogol; and in faint hope of a clue or for some impulse unexplainable, he stopped his cab so as to pick it up. It was addressed to himself, and was quite a <b>bulky</b> <b>parcel.</b> On examination, however, its bulk was found to consist of thirty-three pieces of paper of no value wrapped one round the other. When the last covering was torn away it reduced itself to a small slip of paper, on which was written:-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I owe {{my life to}} you, Sir Gervaise," [...] he said, {{stretching}} out his thin, white hand {{to him as he}} entered. [...] "You stood by me nobly till I fell, for, though unable to stand, I was not unconscious, and saw how you stood above me and kept the swarming Moslems at bay. No knight throughout the siege has rendered such great service as you have done. Since I have been lying unable to move, I have thought of many things; among them, that I had forgotten to give you the letters and presents that came for you after you sailed away. They are in that cabinet; please bring them to me. There," [...] he said, as Gervaise brought a <b>bulky</b> <b>parcel</b> which the grand master opened, [...] "this letter is from the Holy Father himself. That, as you may see from the arms on the seal, is from Florence. The others are from Pisa, Leghorn, and Naples. Rarely, Sir Gervaise, has any potentate or knight earned the thanks of so many great cities. These caskets accompanied them. Sit down and read your letters. They must be copied in our records." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't think, gentlemen," [...] {{he began}} with a {{pleasant}} smile, [...] "that any man of us here {{would like to be}} called a coward; but in fighting with an enemy who never attacks, or even appears, except with a deliberately prepared advantage on his side, it is my opinion that a man is not only justified in avoiding an unequal encounter with him, but in circumventing by every means the object of his attack. You have all been frank in telling your methods. I will be equally so in telling mine, even if I have perhaps to confess to a little more than you have; for I have not only availed myself of a well-known rule of the robbers who infest these mountains, to exempt all women and children from their spoliation,--a rule which, of course, they perfectly understand gives them a sentimental consideration with all Californians,--but I have, I confess, also availed myself of the innocent kindness of one of that charming and justly exempted sex." [...] He paused and bowed courteously to the fair unknown. [...] "When I entered this coach I had with me a <b>bulky</b> <b>parcel</b> which was manifestly too large for my pockets, yet as evidently too small and too valuable to be intrusted to the ordinary luggage. Seeing my difficulty, our charming companion opposite, out of the very kindness and innocence of her heart, offered to make a place for it in her satchel, which was not full. I accepted the offer joyfully. When I state to you, gentlemen, that that package contained valuable government bonds to a considerable amount, I do so, not to claim your praise for any originality of my own, but to make this public avowal to our fair fellow passenger for securing to me this most perfect security and immunity from the road agent that has been yet recorded." ...|$|E
