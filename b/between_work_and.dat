5|$|Weber {{began his}} {{studies of the}} subject in The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism, in which {{he argued that the}} {{redefinition}} of the connection <b>between</b> <b>work</b> <b>and</b> piety in Protestantism and especially in ascetic Protestant denominations, particularly Calvinism, shifted human effort towards rational efforts aimed at achieving economic gain. In Protestant religion, Christian piety towards God was expressed through one's secular vocation (secularisation of calling). The rational roots of this doctrine, he argued, soon grew incompatible with and larger than the religious and so the latter were eventually discarded.|$|E
5|$|There {{are some}} {{unresolved}} {{questions concerning the}} definition of work: in particular, whether unpaid endeavors, such as volunteering or studying, are work. Non-work time should not be equated with free time, as it comprises not only free time, dedicated to leisure, but also time dedicated to certain obligatory activities, such as housework. Dividing activities into free and dedicated time is not easy. For example, brushing one's teeth is neither work nor leisure; scholars differ in their classifications of activities such as eating a meal, shopping, repairing a car, attending a religious ceremony, or showering (various individuals {{may or may not}} classify such activities as leisure). The relation <b>between</b> <b>work</b> <b>and</b> leisure can also be unclear: research indicates that some individuals find skills that they have acquired at work useful to their hobbies (and vice versa), and some individuals have used leisure activities to advance their work careers. Sociologists also disagree as to whether political or spiritual activities should be included in studies of leisure. Further, among some occupational communities, such as police officers or miners, it is common for work colleagues to be off-time friends and to share similar, work-based leisure activities.|$|E

2500|$|Work–life {{balance is}} a concept {{including}} the proper prioritization <b>between</b> <b>work</b> (career <b>and</b> ambition) and lifestyle (health, pleasure, leisure, family). The work–leisure dichotomy was invented in the mid-1800s. Paul Krassner, an American journalist, observed that anthropologists define happiness as having as little separation as possible <b>between</b> your <b>work</b> <b>and</b> your play. The expression [...] "work–life balance" [...] was first used in the United Kingdom in the late 1970s to describe the balance <b>between</b> an individual's <b>work</b> <b>and</b> personal life. In the United States, this phrase was first used in 1986.|$|R
40|$|The {{current study}} sought to explain a largely {{overlooked}} theme in psychological contract literature, that is, how individual factors are related to formation of psychological contract. It investigated the relationship <b>between</b> people’s <b>work</b> centrality, psychological contracts, and job attitudes. It was expected that people with higher work centrality {{would be less likely}} to have a transactional contract and more likely to have a relational contract with the employer. Furthermore, it was expected that psychological contract (transactional and relational) would mediate the relations <b>between</b> <b>work</b> centrality <b>and</b> job attitudes. Finally, we expected age to moderate the relations <b>between</b> <b>work</b> centrality <b>and</b> the psychological contract. The study was conducted among 465 employees in a Dutch health care organization. Structural equation models supported the mediating effect of psychological contract types in the relations <b>between</b> <b>work</b> centrality <b>and</b> three job attitudes (work engagement, job satisfaction, and turnover intention). Moreover, it was found that the relations <b>between</b> <b>work</b> centrality <b>and</b> psychological contract were stronger for older workers than for younger workers...|$|R

In the conviction that work is a right and a duty and that every form of occupation deserves respect, the brothers and sisters should commit themselves to collaborate so that all persons may have the possibility to work and so that working conditions may always be more humane. Leisure and recreation have their own value and are necessary for personal development.

25|$|Most {{schools of}} Hindu {{philosophy}} accept {{the existence of}} a creator god (Brahma), while some do not. The school of Vedanta argues that one of the proofs of the existence of God is the law of karma. In a commentary to Brahma Sutras (III, 2, 38, and 41), a Vedantic text, Adi Sankara, an Indian philosopher who consolidated the doctrine of Advaita Vedanta, a sub-school of Vedanta, argues that the original karmic actions themselves cannot bring about the proper results at some future time; neither can super sensuous, non-intelligent qualities like adrsta—an unseen force being the metaphysical link <b>between</b> <b>work</b> <b>and</b> its result—by themselves mediate the appropriate, justly deserved pleasure and pain. The fruits, according to him, then, must be administered through the action of a conscious agent, namely, a supreme being (Ishvara).|$|E

[...] "Artisans, be they potters, weavers, metal-smiths, or cooks, control the process of their own work from beginning to finish." [...] Artisans may specialize in {{a particular kind of}} product, but they are always in total control of the process of production and each thing they make or create is unique. Prescriptive technologies, on the other hand, break work down into a series of discrete, standardized steps. [...] "Each step is carried out by a separate worker, or group of workers, who need to be familiar only with the skills of performing that one step." ...|$|E

500|$|The double {{burden is}} usually {{view as a}} primary problem for single women or married women. However, it is often less {{recognized}} that men can and often do {{go through the same}} trials and hard times as a parent trying to balance work and the family. Within the book The Canadian Family in Crisis, Conway addresses this issue with an argument from Eichler. Eichler says, [...] "Social science fails to understand men" [...] by tending [...] "to downplay or ignore a potential conflict <b>between</b> <b>work</b> <b>and</b> home for men." [...] Married men can avoid the full impact of the double burden, but single fathers are totally incapable of avoiding the double burden of family and work. Though single fathers face the same number of problems that single mothers face, they have two advantages that play in their favor. Men usually have a higher income and have a shorter time of being single than women. However, until they are remarried or have a woman to help them out around the house, men still must deal with the sexual and emotional frustration as a woman does. They must deal with the balancing of work, childcare, and domestic responsibilities. Single fathers are usually doubtful about their ability be a parent, and they are challenged psychologically. [...] "The problems faced by the working single father are more than merely the logistical problems shared by all working parents. He has to change the way he feels about himself as man." [...] A man being a single parent and feelings the effects of the double burden can and will interfere with his career just as it does with a single mother that has a career. A study showed that five percent of single fathers were fired form their jobs due to the double burden and another eight percent quit because the double burden became too much of a burden for them to balance both work and the family. With that being said, single fathers feel the same, if not more, of the effect of the double burden as women do.|$|E
