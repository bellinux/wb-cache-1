5|$|Quenya {{allows for}} a very {{flexible}} word order {{because it is an}} inflectional language like Latin. Nevertheless, it has word order rules. The usual syntax structure is subject-verb-object. The adjective can be placed <b>before</b> <b>or</b> <b>after</b> the noun that it modifies.|$|E

5|$|A jonline {{can also}} be used to tether the diver's {{equipment}} to the dive boat <b>before</b> <b>or</b> <b>after</b> the dive. This helps the diver to put on or take off the equipment while in the water without drifting away from the boat. It is similar to a buddy line, which is used to tether two divers together during a dive.|$|E

5|$|After about 10 days (1–3 weeks {{depending}} on temperatures), larvae hatch and bore directly throughout the pod walls and develop within the seed. Larvae are thus protected from {{biological and chemical}} control. Larval development lasts two to three months. Before entering its pupal stage, the larva cuts a circular cap. After around ten days of pupal stage, the adult emerges from the seeds. Because mating and oviposition are spread over a few weeks, adults can emerge <b>before</b> <b>or</b> <b>after</b> harvest.|$|E
5|$|Atmospheric {{pressure}} changes due {{to change}} of altitude <b>before</b> <b>or</b> <b>after</b> diving {{can have a}} significant influence on decompression risk. Diving at high altitude requires special consideration in decompression planning. Such variations in ambient pressure caused by flying or surface travel involving changes in altitude will affect decompression and should be considered during dive planning and therefore may influence a planned dive profile.|$|E

Many women have normal thyroid function but have immunological evidence of thyroid autoimmunity (as evidenced by autoantibodies) or are iodine deficient, and develop evidence of hypothyroidism <b>before</b> <b>or</b> <b>after</b> giving birth.|$|E

5|$|Christian doctrines {{include the}} beliefs that Jesus was {{conceived}} by the Holy Spirit, {{was born of}} a virgin named Mary, performed miracles, founded the Church, died by crucifixion as a sacrifice to achieve atonement, rose from the dead, and ascended into Heaven, from where he will return. Most Christians believe Jesus enables humans to be reconciled to God. The Nicene Creed asserts that Jesus will judge {{the living and the}} dead either <b>before</b> <b>or</b> <b>after</b> their bodily resurrection, an event tied to the Second Coming of Jesus in Christian eschatology. The great majority of Christians worship Jesus as the incarnation of God the Son, the second of three persons of a Divine Trinity. A minority of Christian denominations reject Trinitarianism, wholly or partly, as non-scriptural.|$|E
5|$|German ethnologist Thomas Barthel, {{who first}} {{published}} the rongorongo corpus, identified three {{lines on the}} recto (side a) of tablet C, also known as Mamari, as a lunar calendar. Guy proposed {{that it was more}} precisely an astronomical rule for whether one or two intercalary nights should be inserted into the 28-night Rapanui month to keep it in sync with the phases of the moon, and if one night, whether this should come <b>before</b> <b>or</b> <b>after</b> the full moon. Berthin and Berthin propose that it is the text which follows the identified calendar which shows where the intercalary nights should appear. The Mamari calendar is the only example of rongorongo whose function is currently accepted as being understood, though it cannot actually be read.|$|E
5|$|In 1961, the FNLA and the MPLA, {{based in}} {{neighbouring}} countries, began a guerrilla campaign against Portuguese rule on several fronts. The Portuguese Colonial War, {{which included the}} Angolan War of Independence, lasted until the Portuguese regime's overthrow in 1974 through a leftist military coup in Lisbon. When the timeline for independence became known, most of the roughly 500,000 ethnic Portuguese Angolans fled the territory during the weeks <b>before</b> <b>or</b> <b>after</b> that deadline. Portugal left behind a newly independent country whose population was mainly composed by Ambundu, Ovimbundu, and Bakongo peoples. The Portuguese that lived in Angola accounted {{for the majority of}} the skilled workers in public administration, agriculture, and industry; once they fled the country, the national economy began to sink into depression.|$|E

5|$|In general, {{the list}} follows the {{sequence}} {{in which the}} operas were written. There is uncertainty about whether La finta semplice was written <b>before</b> <b>or</b> <b>after</b> Bastien und Bastienne, and in some listings the former is given priority. Thamos was written in two segments, the earlier in 1774, but is listed in accordance with its completion in 177980. Die Zauberflöte and La clemenza di Tito were written concurrently. Die Zauberflote was started earlier and put aside for the Tito commission, which was completed and performed first and is usually listed as the earlier work despite having a higher Köchel catalogue number.|$|E
5|$|It is safe {{to observe}} the total phase of a solar eclipse {{directly}} only when the Sun's photosphere is completely covered by the Moon, and not <b>before</b> <b>or</b> <b>after</b> totality. During this period, the Sun is too dim to be seen through filters. The Sun's faint corona will be visible, and the chromosphere, solar prominences, and possibly even a solar flare may be seen. At the end of totality, the same effects will occur in reverse order, and {{on the opposite side}} of the Moon.|$|E
5|$|Main and Hesse {{found that}} most of the mothers of these {{children}} had suffered major losses or other trauma shortly <b>before</b> <b>or</b> <b>after</b> the birth of the infant and had reacted by becoming severely depressed. In fact, 56% of mothers who had lost a parent by death before they completed high school subsequently had children with disorganized attachments. Subsequent studies, whilst emphasising the potential importance of unresolved loss, have qualified these findings. For example, Solomon and George found that unresolved loss in the mother tended to be associated with disorganized attachment in their infant primarily when they had also experienced an unresolved trauma in their life prior to the loss.|$|E

5|$|The {{application}} of phosphite inhibits growth of P.cinnamomi in B.sessilis, {{but does not}} kill the pathogen. In one study, a foliar spray containing phosphite inhibited the growth of P.cinnamomi by over 90% in plants infected with B.sessilis two weeks after spraying, and by 66% in plants infected one year after spraying; yet most plants infected shortly <b>before</b> <b>or</b> <b>after</b> spraying were dead 100 days later, while nearly all plants infected seven months later spraying survived a further 100 days. Phosphite is not known to affect plant growth, but {{has been shown to}} reduce pollen fertility: one study recorded fertility reductions of up to 50%, and, in a separate experiment, fertility reductions that persisted for more than a year.|$|E
5|$|To {{the naked}} eye, Venus {{appears as a}} white point of light {{brighter}} than any other planet or star (apart from the Sun). Its brightest apparent magnitude, −4.9, occurs during crescent phase, only 36 days <b>before</b> <b>or</b> <b>after</b> inferior conjunction. Venus will be brightest on 30 April 2017, then grow dimmer for nearly a year. Venus fades to about magnitude −3 when it is backlit by the Sun. The planet is bright enough {{to be seen in}} a clear midday sky and is more easily visible when the Sun is low on the horizon or setting. As an inferior planet, it always lies within about 47° of the Sun.|$|E

Six inductees—Summitt, Yow, Auriemma, Van Chancellor, VanDerveer, and Alexeeva—have led a women's national {{team to a}} top-three finish in the Olympics. Alexeeva led the Soviet Union to two golds, while all the others led the USA to golds (Auriemma after his induction, the others before being inducted).|$|E
