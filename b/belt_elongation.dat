"Head Injury {{is one of}} {{the main}} reasons causing {{fatalities}} in air crashes. In the year 2005, of the total 3448 accidents reported in U. S. general and civil aviation, 655 have been fatal with a total of 1150 on-board fatalities. Head Injury being the most important component contributing to these statistics. One of the main obstructions which causes head impacts are the bulkheads dividing the cabin interiors. Bulkheads in an aircraft or a ship are usually the partitions mounted using the seat tracks and upper mountings that divide different classes or sections of an aircraft. But the actual function of the Bulkhead is to provide structural stability to the aircraft or the ship. When installed by the aircraft door, it protects passengers against the cold winds blowing from the airfield. The passengers sitting on the first row behind the bulkhead in the aircraft are less than three feet away from the bulkhead. Hence in the event of an air crash or an emergency landing the front row passengers seated directly behind bulkheads or cabin class dividers have the tendency to have a head and upper torso impact with the bulkhead making it important to study this criteria in order to reduce the HIC value or the Head Injury Criteria. There are other obstructions in the head paths during a crash inside the cabin interiors of an aircraft. These may cause severe head injuries and in many cases can even cause fatalities. A comprehensive study of the head path can prevent these injuries. This thesis presents a parametric study conducted on the head paths and head trajectories during a crash using Federal Aviation Regulations Part 25 and Part 23. This thesis also presents a parametric study of the properties of the bulkhead, the seat belt, the friction and the seat pitch, and how its variation affects the HIC (Head Injury Criteria) value and the trajectory of the head paths. The attempt is to find the ideal set of properties so as to minimize the HIC value. For example the stiffness of the bulkhead directly affects the structural stability of the aircraft. The more stiff the bulkhead the more strength it imparts to the fuselage and vice versa. But as the bulkhead used gets more stiff the higher is the corresponding value of HIC. The attempt of this experiment is to arrive at the best possible stiffness so as to avoid human fatalities at the same time impart the highest structural stability to the aircraft fuselage. For this purpose, front facing impact tests are simulated using S 2 50 th percentile Hybrid II human dummy model with a regular two point restraint system as is common in aircraft seating systems. Tests are conducted for a single seated occupant. Sets of parametric studies are conducted by varying the stiffness of the bulkhead, the coefficient of friction between the human dummy and the seat pan & backrest, the seat <b>belt</b> <b>elongation</b> properties and the seat pitch, so as to find the best, most safe combination of material properties for the an allowable HIC value and maximum structural stability...|$|E

The current practice used to comply with Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR’s) related to aircraft seats and cabin interiors is to conduct full-scale system sled tests. This approach can be expensive and the test results are sensitive to changes in test conditions, such as the sled pulse, dummy calibration, seat <b>belt</b> <b>elongation,</b> etc., resulting in scatter in the results. With {{the development of the}} more robust codes for the analytical tools, {{it should be possible to}} successfully capture the test conditions by one of these tools and to obtain results which compare favorably with the actual tests results. For Part 25 category of transport aircrafts, 14 CFR 25. 562 states: “Each seat type design which approved for crew or passenger occupancy during takeoff and landing must successfully complete dynamic tests or be demonstrated by rational analysis based on dynamic tests of a similar type seat, in accordance with each of the following emergency landing conditions” and then the conditions are stated. When these federal regulations were enacted, the ability of analytical tools was limited and there did not exist enough data to show that certification could be performed using analysis. The objectives of this research are to identify the conditions under which a Part 25 type aircraft could be certified by analysis for compliance with the 14 CFR 25. 562 regulation, and also to identify the validation criteria when using analytical tools. The validation criteria for the analytical model have been developed based on the scatter that is seen in actual testing. The underlying premise is that the analytical modeling of the testing should be allowed to predict the injury criteria within the same band of scatter as the actual tests. The study develops a validated model and this model is shown to be robust in predicting the protection/injury criteria that the tested configurations offer. Using these validated models, a full factorial design of experiment (DOE) analysis was performed to determine the effect the factors have on the dynamic response of the seat-dummy-restraint-cabin systems. In this study, the factors chosen were the seat cushion type, thickness of the cushion and the rigidity of the seat for the 14 CFR 25. 562 Test - 1 condition (up test) and the studied response was the resulting lumbar load. For 14 CFR 25. 562 Test - 2 condition (down test), the studied factors were the seat set back distance, seat belt type, type of bulkhead and the coefficient of friction of the impact surface, while the studied response was the resulting Head injury criteria (HIC) based on the impact of the dummy head with the frontal structure. Guidelines were developed in this study pertaining to the circumstance under which analytical tools could be considered as a valid replacement for the certification testing. Based on the sensitivity study, a new integrated analytical system methodology has been developed that would help the aerospace cabin interior designers in developing crashworthy cabin interiors. A graphical user interface was developed which would help the cabin interior designers to optimize their design by selecting component that would help in minimizing the injury criteria studied. This would reduce the time it takes to design these configurations and would reduce the cost of certification while improving the safety of the flying public...|$|E

"Includes bibliographic {{references}} (leaves 66 - 69) There {{has been}} enormous {{boom in the}} air travel in recent times. There is increasing demand for the technological advancement nowadays towards {{the safety of the}} onboard passengers. Certification of aircrafts requires engineers to demonstrate that a head contact with any aircraft interior complies with the Head injury criteria (HIC) threshold of 1000 units specified in 14 CFR 23. 562, 25. 562, 27. 562. Analyzing injuries {{to the head of the}} occupant when it comes to contact with any aircraft cabin interiors is of serious issue. HIC compliance is a major concern for all the segments of the aircraft industry due to high cost involved in the certification. This research is an attempt to find a cost effective and yet valid approach to solve the HIC problem for the front row bulkhead seats in transport aircrafts. Previous experience, Quasi static testing, Finite element modeling and Madymo biodynamic simulations are utilized for the HIC compliant bulkheads. Madymo (Mathematical Dynamical Model) is a software package which can be used to simulate the dynamic behavior of Mechanical systems. It has a unique combination of fully integrated multibody and finite element techniques. Quasi static testing on various cell size honeycomb core configurations was carried out. Finite element modeling of honeycomb core was done using Msc Patran software package. Comprehensive parametric study has been carried out on different boundary conditions in which the bulkhead may be fixed. Variable thicknesses of the bulkhead which can be used has been looked upon in this study. Different restraint systems and varied seat setback distances have been used for the parametric study. Nylon belt and the Polyester belt are the two different types of <b>belts</b> with different <b>elongation</b> characteristics which are used in this study. The validated madymo models are then used to conduct a parametric study on the effect of the stiffness and strength of the bulkhead on HIC attenuation below the injury levels...|$|R
