5|$|Biographies of Kerr {{have been}} {{published}} by Eric Braun and, in 2010, by the entertainment journalist Michelangelo Capua, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> yet to receive an in-depth study of her filmography, artistry or life.|$|E
5|$|After 2 {{years of}} college, McDougal {{moved to a}} Detroit suburb where she taught pre-kindergarten, before being persuaded {{to try out for}} a {{swimsuit}} competition. One of her professional goals has always been to open a learning center for children, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> put those plans on hold to focus on pursuing roles in acting and modelling.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, an annoyed Kersh tells Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{that he is}} {{lifting the}} {{quarantine}} of the oil platform. Scully opposes the idea <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> no choice other than to obey. Scully then realizes that de la Cruz is immune to the black oil, and because of it, he suffered from radiation burns instead of infection. After talking to Garza, Doggett leaves to find Mulder but is attacked by Taylor. Mulder arrives and overpowers Taylor, and Mulder and Doggett barricade themselves in the communication room, and try to relay a message while the platform's crew attack the door.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Poyser {{had thought}} of Dinah several times since Adam <b>had</b> come in, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> had [...] "no heart" [...] to mention the bad news.|$|R
60|$|Soames was startled, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> underrated his {{caution and}} tenacity.|$|R
60|$|Cissie's {{eyes were}} critical, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> nothing ready to say.|$|R
5|$|Mulder, still {{restrained}} {{in his bed}} at the hospital, {{sees the}} silhouette of the monster at the window. He screams for the nurse, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> already been bitten and opens the window to let the monster in. Scully tries to visit Mulder but the nurse refuses access. Suddenly Scully sees the nurse as a corpse, realizes that Mulder is in danger, and runs into Mulder's room. There she sees the monster {{on the wall and}} shoots at it. It leaps through the partially open window, breaking the glass and wooden frame.|$|E
5|$|Though {{she rarely}} talks, she {{frequently}} makes a characteristic sucking noise with her pacifier, {{which has become}} synonymous with the character. Her pacifier sucking noises are provided by the show's creator, Matt Groening and early producer Gabor Csupo. Maggie's occasional speaking parts and other vocalisations are currently provided by Nancy Cartwright, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> also been voiced by guest stars James Earl Jones, Elizabeth Taylor and Jodie Foster, and by series regulars Yeardley Smith and Harry Shearer. Maggie has appeared in various media relating to The Simpsons– including video games, The Simpsons Movie, The Simpsons Ride, commercials and comic books– and has inspired an entire line of merchandise.|$|E
5|$|After {{seeing a}} vision of Stoller being stabbed in her car, Black warns her that she may be in danger, which she rebukes. However, she is {{approached}} by another patient, Purdue (Michael Massee), who insists that Edward is stealing dreams, but will not steal his. Watts researches the facility's inmates to find who has committed stabbings in the victims' cars, concluding that Purdue is the one this profile fits. Black attempts to warn Stoller, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> already driven away from the hospital. Black gives chase, scaring her, and she out-paces him before pulling into a filling station. However, the attendant alerts Stoller that someone is hiding {{in the back seat}} of her car, and manages to bring her to the safety of his office. Black arrives and finds the car empty. He drives Stoller back to the hospital while the attendant attempts to call the police. However, he is killed before making the call.|$|E
60|$|Josie scented ignominous defeat, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> {{one more}} shot to fire.|$|R
60|$|This was satisfactory, for it {{suggested}} that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been undeceived about Gladwyne; <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> not finished.|$|R
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> {{to speak}} {{again and again}} before Silas could answer her.|$|R
5|$|George {{wakes up}} the next morning on the river bank, and finds a treehouse {{belonging}} to a Christian missionary named Father Hubert. Hubert has been nursing Nico back to health, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> suffered a snakebite and requires special medicine. He takes George to the local Mayan village, as he believes the village Shaman will be able to help. George shows his Mayan stone to the shaman, who explains that, hundreds of years ago, Mayan shamans had trapped the god Tezcatlipoca inside a mirror. However, he was so powerful that he would inevitably escape, so they created three stones that contained the power to keep him imprisoned. Before they could be put in place, they were stolen by explorers: one by a Spanish pirate named Captain Ketch, who hid it in the Caribbean; one by an English ship, which took it to England; and one by Spanish explorers, who took it back to Spain. The third of these stones was in Nico's and George's possession. George returns to the treehouse and cures Nico with medicine from the shaman. Shortly thereafter, the two separate to find the two remaining stones.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Mulder's mother Teena {{is found}} dead in her home. It is found she overdosed on {{sleeping}} pills after she burned all her pictures of Samantha and placed tape around her baseboards and turned the gas in the oven on. Mulder believes she was murdered and has Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) do an autopsy. Later, Mulder visits the mother who was convicted twelve years prior. She tells him that Samantha is a walk-in, a kind spirit who takes children {{so that they may}} be shielded from potential harm in their life. The mother tells Mulder that the children are safe, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> no idea where they are. After hearing this, Mulder believes his mother probably also wrote a note after his sister's disappearance. He begins to think that the alien abduction never happened, and that his mother figured this out, which is why she was murdered. However, after performing the autopsy, Scully tells Mulder that it was definitely suicide, because she was ill with Paget's carcinoma.|$|E
5|$|One week later, Mrs. Mallard {{leads the}} ducklings ashore and {{straight}} to the highway in hopes of crossing to reach the Garden, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> trouble crossing as the cars will not yield to her. Michael, the policeman who the Mallards visited, stops traffic for the family to cross. Michael calls police headquarters and instructs them to send a police car to stop traffic along the route for the ducks. The ducks cross the highway, Embankment Road (Storrow Drive {{had yet to be}} constructed when the book was written), then proceed down Mount Vernon Street to Charles Street where they head south to the Garden. The people on the streets admire the family of ducks. When the family must cross Beacon Street to enter the Garden, there are four policemen standing in the intersection stopping traffic {{to make way for the}} ducklings. Mr. Mallard is waiting in the Public Garden for the rest of the family. Finally, the family decides to stay in the Garden and lives happily ever after. They end each day searching for peanuts and food, and when night falls, they swim to their little island and go to sleep.|$|E
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> vanished, and {{a mother}} of forbidding aspect afforded no explanations.|$|R
60|$|She {{knew she}} would never be much of a success as an {{elementary}} school teacher. <b>But</b> neither <b>had</b> <b>she</b> failed. <b>She</b> hated it, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> managed it.|$|R
60|$|He {{lifted his}} eyes to hers with a sudden flush. <b>But</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> fled.|$|R
5|$|At the palace, Charming {{struggles with}} his {{feelings}} for Snow. The King (Alan Dale) commands him to forget her because the marriage to Abigail is worth great wealth to the kingdom. Charming sends a letter by carrier pigeon to Snow begging {{her to come}} and see him so they can be together. The letter reaches her just before she can take the potion. Snow makes it to the palace but she is seized by the guards and thrown into the dungeon. There she meets a dwarf named Grumpy (Lee Arenberg), who was falsely imprisoned for stealing a diamond that he wanted to give to his girlfriend. Another dwarf, Stealthy (Geoff Gustafson), shows up to rescue Grumpy, who asks Stealthy to free Snow as well. The guards kill Stealthy as they try to escape and try to recapture Grumpy. Snow threatens to burn down the palace unless they let Grumpy go and take her in his place. The King tells Snow he will not let her interfere with the wedding. She must tell Charming she does not love him, or the King will kill him. Snow obeys because she loves Charming too much to let him die, but both are left heartbroken. Snow leaves and is soon joined by Grumpy and six other dwarfs, who offer her a place to stay. She considers the potion but Grumpy warns her that those feelings however painful, are part of her. Charming calls off the wedding to look for Snow and the dwarves hear about it from Red Riding Hood. Grumpy joyfully tells Snow the good news, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> forgotten about Charming. The pain was too great to bear and she drank the potion.|$|E
5|$|Buffy {{died at the}} end of {{the fifth}} season ("The Gift"), sacrificing herself in place of her younger sister Dawn (Michelle Trachtenberg) in order to save the world. In the first episode of the sixth season, Willow, believing Buffy to be in Hell, used magic to bring her back from the grave. Buffy was in fact at peace, in what she thinks was heaven, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> kept this a secret from her friends. Since her resurrection, Buffy has been lost and without {{inspiration}} to perform her duties as a Slayer. Willow is romantically involved with Tara Maclay (Amber Benson), a powerful but ethical witch. Tara has previously expressed concern at Willow's use of her emergent magical powers for trivial or personal matters. In the preceding episode ("All the Way"), Willow cast a spell to make Tara forget an argument about her abuse of magic. In the same episode, Dawn, who has been stealing from stores, including Anya's magic shop, lies to Buffy and goes on a clandestine and almost deadly date. Left to take care of Dawn after the death of their mother Joyce Summers (Kristine Sutherland) in the fifth season ("The Body"), Buffy has come to depend more heavily on Giles. Following Dawn's date, Buffy asks Giles to shoulder responsibility for disciplining her, much to his discomfort.|$|E

25|$|The Churel {{is mostly}} {{described}} as extremely ugly and hideous <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> {{the power to}} shape-shift and disguise herself as a beautiful woman to lure men to the mountains where she either kills them or sucks up their virility, turning them into old men.|$|E

Willmore has described his love and temptation to get her forever (she has never loved anyone before). She agrees, despite the warnings of her maidservant Moretta.|$|E
25|$|After 2382's failed mission, Rachel Cortez {{is placed}} {{in command of the}} Excelsior and is ostensibly tasked with a {{diplomatic}} mission to the planet Valandria, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> a covert mission.
