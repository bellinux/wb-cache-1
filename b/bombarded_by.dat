5|$|Bratislava was <b>bombarded</b> <b>by</b> the Allies, {{occupied}} by German troops in 1944, and eventually taken by {{troops of the}} Soviet 2nd Ukrainian Front on 4 April 1945. At the end of World War II, most of Bratislava's ethnic Germans were helped to evacuate by the German authorities. A few returned after the war, but were soon expelled without their properties under the Beneš decrees, part of a widespread expulsion of ethnic Germans from eastern Europe.|$|E
5|$|On 14 June 1945 British {{aircraft}} {{conducted a}} series of raids against Japanese positions at Truk. The next morning, several islands were <b>bombarded</b> <b>by</b> British and Canadian cruisers, though only one of the four warships involved achieved any success. Further air strikes took place in the afternoon and night of 15 June before the Allied force returned to its base.|$|E
5|$|On 16 April the Red Army {{started the}} Battle of Berlin and by 19 April {{they started to}} {{encircle}} the city. On 20 April, his 56th birthday, Hitler made his last trip to the surface. In the ruined garden of the Reich Chancellery, he awarded the Iron Cross to boy soldiers of the Hitler Youth. That afternoon, Berlin was <b>bombarded</b> <b>by</b> Soviet artillery for the first time.|$|E

5|$|By early 1945, Germany's {{military}} {{situation was}} on the verge of total collapse. Hitler, presiding over a rapidly disintegrating Third Reich, retreated to his Führerbunker in Berlin on 16 January 1945. To the Nazi leadership, it was clear that the battle for Berlin would be the final battle of the war. Berlin was <b>bombarded</b> <b>by</b> Soviet artillery for the first time on 20 April 1945 (Hitler's birthday). By the evening of 21 April, Red Army tanks reached the outskirts of the city. By 27 April, Berlin was cut off from the rest of Germany.|$|E
5|$|General Adib Shishakli {{seized power}} in 1951, {{establishing}} a military-backed autocracy. Atrash participated in anti-Shishakli activity, including throwing explosives at Shishakli's residence in 1952, an action {{which resulted in}} Atrash's arrest. In 1953 Shishakli launched a crackdown on the Druze community, claiming they were being funded by Hashemite-ruled Jordan and Iraq to establish a Hashemite government in Syria. Jabal al-Druze was <b>bombarded</b> <b>by</b> government forces and Atrash's father Sultan was put under house arrest for his vocal criticism of Shishakli.|$|E
5|$|German {{infantry}} {{were spotted}} advancing towards the brigade box and were <b>bombarded</b> <b>by</b> heavy artillery, which repulsed the attack. Around 09:00, more infantry attacked {{the box and}} came too close for artillery fire. Hand-to-hand fighting began and a British platoon was overrun before a tank-infantry counter-attack repulsed the German infantry and restored the position. The Germans resorted to harassing fire, sniping, mortar bombardments and heavy artillery fire. After a long artillery bombardment, simultaneous attacks by tanks and infantry were made at 19:00, {{from the north and}} south, which broke into the box and closed on the brigade headquarters, before being driven back around 22:30.|$|E

5|$|Lithium deuteride was {{the fusion}} fuel {{of choice in}} early {{versions}} of the hydrogen bomb. When <b>bombarded</b> <b>by</b> neutrons, both 6Li and 7Li produce tritium — this reaction, which was not fully understood when hydrogen bombs were first tested, {{was responsible for the}} runaway yield of the Castle Bravo nuclear test. Tritium fuses with deuterium in a fusion reaction that is relatively easy to achieve. Although details remain secret, lithium-6 deuteride apparently still plays a role in modern nuclear weapons as a fusion material.|$|E
5|$|On 23 January 1943, Saratoga {{launched}} 18 Wildcats of VF-3, 24 Dauntlesses of VB-3 and VS-3, and 17 Avengers of VT-3 for Henderson Field, retaining 16 Wildcats and 15 Dauntlesses for self-defense. The {{next day}} they attacked the Japanese airfield at Vila, Solomon Islands after it had been <b>bombarded</b> <b>by</b> four Allied light cruisers. The aircraft returned to the carrier without loss later that afternoon. Captain Bogan slipped and badly injured himself on 29 March so Captain Henry M. Mullinnix assumed command on 7 April.|$|E

War comes to Afghanistan, and Kabul is <b>bombarded</b> <b>by</b> rocket attacks. Tariq's family decides to leave the city, and the emotional farewell between Laila and Tariq culminates with them making love. Laila's family also decides to leave Kabul, but as they are packing a rocket destroys the house, killing her parents and severely injuring Laila. Laila is subsequently taken in by Rasheed and Mariam.|$|E

50|$|The Pumhart von Steyr is {{a medieval}} supergun from Styria, Austria, {{and the largest}} known wrought-iron <b>bombard</b> <b>by</b> caliber. It weighs around 8 tons and has a length of more than 2.5 meters. It was {{produced}} in the early 15th century and could fire, according to modern calculations, an 80 cm stone ball weighing 690 kg to a distance of roughly 600 m after being loaded with 15 kg of gunpowder and set at an elevation of 10°.|$|R
5|$|While {{the lightest}} (252Lr to 254Lr) and {{heaviest}} (266Lr) lawrencium isotopes are produced only as alpha decay products of dubnium (Z=105) isotopes, the middle isotopes (255Lr to 262Lr) {{can all be}} produced <b>by</b> <b>bombarding</b> actinide (americium to einsteinium) targets with light ions (from boron to neon). The two most important isotopes, 256Lr and 260Lr, are both in this range. 256Lr can be produced <b>by</b> <b>bombarding</b> californium-249 with 70MeV boron-11 ions (producing lawrencium-256 and four neutrons), while 260Lr can be produced <b>by</b> <b>bombarding</b> berkelium-249 with oxygen-18 (producing lawrencium-260, an alpha particle, and three neutrons).|$|R
5|$|The Dayton Project {{developed}} {{techniques for}} extracting polonium-210 from the lead dioxide ore {{in which it}} occurs naturally, and from bismuth targets that had been <b>bombarded</b> <b>by</b> neutrons in a nuclear reactor. Ultimately, polonium-based neutron initiators were used in both the gun-type Little Boy and the implosion-type Fat Man used in the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki respectively. The fact that polonium {{was used as an}} initiator was classified until the 1960s, but George Koval, a technician with the Manhattan Project's Special Engineer Detachment, penetrated the Dayton Project as a spy for the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|The {{damage to}} the citadel, {{especially}} to its northern and western walls, was only repaired in 1407. In 1414, governor of Damascus Nawruz al-Hafizi, sought refuge in the citadel against the army of Sultan Al-Mu'ayyad Shaykh. The citadel was <b>bombarded</b> <b>by</b> trebuchet and cannon. The siege ended when a treaty of surrender was signed. In 1461, the southwest tower collapsed in a fire when missiles were fired from it to force the rebellious governor of Damascus to leave the city. This tower and four others were rebuilt in the late 15th and early 16th centuries, indicating that the repairs of 1407 had been carried out in haste.|$|E
5|$|The {{first report}} of {{discovery}} of element 105 {{came from the}} Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in Dubna, Moscow Oblast, Russian SFSR, Soviet Union, in 1968. A target of 243Am was <b>bombarded</b> <b>by</b> a beam of 22Ne ions. The scientists at Dubna reported 9.4MeV (with the reported half-life of 0.1–3 seconds) and 9.7MeV (t1/2>0.05s) alpha activities followed by alpha activities {{similar to those of}} either 256103 or 257103. The two activity lines were, based on prior theoretical predictions, assigned to 261105 and 260105, accordingly.|$|E

50|$|The Tsar Cannon (Царь-пушка, Tsar'-pushka) {{is a large}} medieval {{artillery}} piece (known as a bombarda in Russian) {{on display}} {{on the grounds of}} the Moscow Kremlin. It is a monument of Russian artillery casting art, cast in bronze in 1586 in Moscow, by the Russian master bronze caster Andrey Chokhov. Mostly of symbolic impact, it was never used in a war. However, the cannon bears traces of at least one firing. Per the Guinness Book of Records it is the largest <b>bombard</b> <b>by</b> caliber in the world, and it is a major tourist attraction in the ensemble of the Moscow Kremlin.|$|R
5|$|The {{scientists}} at Columbia {{decided that they}} should try to detect the energy released in the nuclear fission of uranium when <b>bombarded</b> <b>by</b> neutrons. On 25 January 1939, {{in the basement of}} Pupin Hall at Columbia, an experimental team including Fermi conducted the first nuclear fission experiment in the United States. The other members of the team were Herbert L. Anderson, Eugene T. Booth, John R. Dunning, G. Norris Glasoe, and Francis G. Slack. The next day, the Fifth Washington Conference on Theoretical Physics began in Washington, D.C. under the joint auspices of George Washington University and the Carnegie Institution of Washington. There, the news on nuclear fission was spread even further, which fostered many more experimental demonstrations.|$|E
5|$|The {{second line}} of {{development}} {{pursued by the}} Manhattan Project used the fissile element plutonium. Although small amounts of plutonium exist in nature, {{the best way to}} obtain large quantities of the element is in a nuclear reactor, in which natural uranium is <b>bombarded</b> <b>by</b> neutrons. The uranium-238 is transmuted into uranium-239, which rapidly decays, first into neptunium-239 and then into plutonium-239. Only a small amount of the uranium-238 will be transformed, so the plutonium must be chemically separated from the remaining uranium, from any initial impurities, and from fission products.|$|E
5|$|During {{the course}} of the game, the player must acquire twelve Artifacts, which are prizes that are awarded after {{completing}} objectives such as winning minigames or beating bosses. Once having acquired twelve Artifacts, the player is granted access to a table called the Artifact Temple, which places six balls on the table at the same time. To complete the table, twelve different targets must be hit with the balls while they are <b>bombarded</b> <b>by</b> attacks from Meta Ridley, one of the antagonists of the Metroid Prime series. If all of the balls are lost, the table ends; the player does not lose any of the twelve Artifacts already collected but is forced to revisit another table and complete it before being allowed a second attempt at the Artifact Temple. Upon completing the Artifact Temple, access is granted to the final table, Impact Crater. After the player defeats the Metroid Prime creature on the Impact Crater table, the game unlocks a higher difficulty level, Expert mode.|$|E

5|$|Hitler {{transferred}} {{his headquarters}} to the Führerbunker ("Leader's bunker") in Berlin on 16 January 1945, where he (along with Bormann, his secretary Else Krüger, and others) remained {{until the end}} of April. The Führerbunker was located under the Reich Chancellery garden in the government district in the centre of the city. The Battle of Berlin, the final major Soviet offensive of the war, began on 16 April 1945. By 19 April the Red Army started to encircle the city. On 20 April, his 56th birthday, Hitler made his last trip to the surface. In the ruined garden of the Reich Chancellery, he awarded Iron Crosses to boy soldiers of the Hitler Youth. That afternoon, Berlin was <b>bombarded</b> <b>by</b> Soviet artillery for the first time. On 23 April, Albert Bormann left the bunker complex and flew to the Obersalzberg. He and several others had been ordered by Hitler to leave Berlin.|$|E
5|$|She {{was struck}} from the Naval Vessel Register on 22 November 1920 and loaned to the War Department, then {{used as a}} target ship for {{experimental}} artillery. She was scuttled in shallow water off Pensacola in January 1921 and <b>bombarded</b> <b>by</b> the coastal batteries of Fort Pickens and by railway artillery. She was returned on 20 February 1925 to the navy, which offered her for scrap, but no acceptable bids were received. Another attempt to scrap her was made in 1956, but the state prevented this. Eventually the ship was declared {{the property of the}} State of Florida by the Supreme Court of Florida. On 10 June 1993—the centennial anniversary of her launching—the site became the fourth Florida Underwater Archaeological Preserve. In 2001 the wreck was also added to the National Register of Historic Places, and it still serves as an artificial reef and diving spot. The Massachusetts figurehead is on display in Dahlgren Hall at the United States Naval Academy.|$|E
5|$|The {{crews of}} the torpedo boats {{remained}} {{loyal to the}} government, and army troops moved to the presidential palace and the coastline, but neither group could stop the mutineers. The fact that many who manned Rio de Janeiro's harbor defenses were sympathetic to the mutineers' cause, coupled with chance that the capital might be <b>bombarded</b> <b>by</b> the mutinous ships, forced the National Congress of Brazil {{to give in to}} the rebels' demands. These included the abolition of flogging, improved living conditions, and the granting of amnesty to all mutineers. The government also issued official pardons and a statement of regret; its submission resulted in the rebellion's end on 26November, when control of the four ships was handed back to the navy.|$|E
