5|$|Sheila {{continued}} with her secretarial course, then {{trained as a}} hairdresser, and briefly found work as a model with the Lucie Clayton agency, which included two months' work in Tokyo. She got pregnant again, and she and Colin married at Chelmsford Registry Office in May 1977 when Sheila was 20, but she lost the <b>baby</b> <b>at</b> six months. The Bambers bought the couple a garden flat in Carlingford Road, Hampstead, to help Sheila recuperate. She suffered another miscarriage, then on 22 June 1979, after four months of bed rest in hospital, {{she gave birth to}} the twins. At around this time, Colin began an affair, one that led to his leaving Sheila five months after the birth. Sheila became increasingly upset; on one occasion, when Colin left a party with another woman, she required hospital treatment after breaking a window with her fist. The couple divorced in May 1982.|$|E
5|$|The {{protective}} effect {{does not begin}} immediately, and people visiting areas where malaria exists usually start taking the drugs one to two weeks before arriving and continue taking them for four weeks after leaving (except for atovaquone/proguanil, which only needs to be started two days before and continued for seven days afterward). The use of preventative drugs is often not practical for {{those who live in}} areas where malaria exists, and their use is usually only in pregnant women and short-term visitors. This is due to the cost of the drugs, side effects from long-term use, and the difficulty in obtaining anti-malarial drugs outside of wealthy nations. During pregnancy, medication to prevent malaria has been found to improve the weight of the <b>baby</b> <b>at</b> birth and decrease the risk of anemia in the mother. The use of preventative drugs where malaria-bearing mosquitoes are present may encourage the development of partial resistance.|$|E
5|$|A popular legend imbues {{the birth}} of Ralambo with a mystical character. The legend relates that his mother, who was known in her youth as Ramaitsoanala ("Green Forest"), was the {{daughter}} of the Vazimba water goddess Ivorombe ("Great Bird"). With the assistance of her celestial mother, Ramaitsoanala confronted and overcame numerous obstacles. After her marriage to Andriamanelo (whereupon she assumed the name Queen Randapavola), one of these obstacles took the form of reproductive difficulties: six consecutive times Randapavola miscarried or lost her children in infancy. When she was pregnant with her seventh child, the queen was especially afraid for her unborn child because the number seven was traditionally associated with death. This time, Randapavola sought the guidance of an astrologer to protect the unborn child from an evil fate. On his advice she chose to defy the tradition of delivering the <b>baby</b> <b>at</b> her parents' home village of Ambohidrabiby, rather choosing the village of Alasora, to the north of Antananarivo, because this cardinal direction embodied great power. According to the tale, the queen gave birth in a house built to resemble a boat (called a kisambosambo) evocative of the transoceanic origins of the Malagasy people. There, Randapavola took the name Rasolobe upon delivering a healthy son, Ralambo, {{on the first day of}} the first month of the year (Alahamady), the most auspicious date for {{the birth of}} a sovereign.|$|E
40|$|Midwives {{working in}} labour wards usually have the {{pleasure}} of delivering a live baby and rejoicing with the mother. However, the delivery could become tragic for the mothers and midwives when the <b>baby</b> dies <b>at</b> birth due to pregnancy related complications. The result is that midwives have to render care and support to mothers {{who have lost their}} <b>babies</b> <b>at</b> birth. The objectives of this study were to explore and describe the experiences of midwives caring for mothers who have lost their <b>babies</b> <b>at</b> birth. A qualitative explorative, descriptive and contextual design was used to conduct this research study to gain an understanding of how the midwives experienced caring for mothers who have lost their <b>babies</b> <b>at</b> birth. A purposive criterion based non-probability sampling method was used. Ten semi-structured face-to-face interviews were conducted to collect data. Ethical considerations were observed throughout the research study. Measures of trustworthiness were ensured by using credibility, transferability, dependability and conformability. Data analysis was done using Tesch’s method to make sense out of text and data. Four themes were identified, namely, Midwives shared their diverse experiences relating to caring for mothers who have lost their <b>babies</b> <b>at</b> birth; Midwives expressed how their personal values and beliefs influenced the ways they dealt with <b>babies</b> dying <b>at</b> birth; Midwives described the organizational values and beliefs related to death and dying and how this influences their own experiences and lastly Midwives provided suggestions regarding how they can be assisted in caring for mothers who have lost their <b>babies</b> <b>at</b> birth. Two main guidelines were developed based on the research findings and literature. The study concludes with recommendations made with regard to areas of nursing practice, education and research...|$|R

40|$|Aim: To {{establish}} {{the levels of}} docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and arachidonic acid (AA) in both plasma and erythrocytes of maternal and cord blood {{as well as in}} breast milk of mothers delivering <b>babies</b> <b>at</b> term. Methods: A total of 148 mothers delivering <b>babies</b> <b>at</b> term were recruited from Bharati Medical Hospital, Pune, India. Results: Levels of DHA and AA in both plasma and erythrocyte were higher in cord blood compared to levels in maternal blood (P&# 60; 0. 001). Maternal plasma and erythrocyte DHA levels had a positive association with the respective levels in cord blood (P&# 60; 0. 001). However, such an association was not seen for AA levels. Maternal plasma omega 3 and omega 6 fatty acids were positively associated with the respective milk fatty acids (P&# 60; 0. 01). Conclusions: Our results indicate that milk long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) status reflects the concentrations of maternal LCPUFA in women delivering <b>babies</b> <b>at</b> term. Improving the maternal LCPUFA status throughout pregnancy and lactation may improve the milk LCPUFA status and ultimately benefit the infant. Peer Reviewe...|$|R

25|$|Roman {{women were}} present at most festivals and cult observances. Some rituals {{specifically}} required {{the presence of}} women, but their active participation was limited. As a rule women did not perform animal sacrifice, the central rite of most major public ceremonies. In addition to the public priesthood of the Vestals, some cult practices were reserved for women only. The rites of the Bona Dea excluded men entirely. Because women enter the public record less frequently than men, their religious practices are less known, and even family cults were headed by the paterfamilias. A host of deities, however, are associated with motherhood. Juno, Diana, Lucina, and specialized divine attendants presided over the life-threatening act of giving birth and the perils of caring for a <b>baby</b> <b>at</b> {{a time when the}} infant mortality rate was as high as 40 percent.|$|E

25|$|The {{second season}} {{dealt with the}} practice's {{financial}} troubles. Naomi reveals to Addison {{that they are in}} danger of losing the practice due to unpaid debt causing Addison to tell Sam. This in turn causes a shift within the practice making Addison the new boss. Adding to the drama was the competition of a new practice, Pacific Wellcare. This new practice, located within the same building as Oceanside Wellness, was run by Charlotte causing turmoil for her and Cooper. Another happening within this season is the dynamic between Sam and Naomi who by the finale realize they can no longer be friends as well as the deepening romantic relationship of Cooper and Charlotte. Addison was romantically linked with Kevin Nelson (played by David Sutcliffe), a police officer, but later realized their relationship was going nowhere. Towards the end of the season, Addison falls in love with cardiovascular surgeon Noah Barnes, who as it turns out, is married and is expecting his first child. Matters become more complicated when Addison realizes that Noah's wife is one of her patients. Archer Montgomery (Grant Show), Addison's playboy brother, also made sporadic appearances causing trouble for her and Naomi. Archer was found to be with an aggressive brain tumor which was later diagnosed as parasites. Addison sought the professional help of her ex-husband, neurosurgeon Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey). After Derek successfully saved Archer, Addison discovered Archer was back to his old tricks cheating on Naomi. Violet stirred some of her own drama when she began dating Sheldon (Brian Benben), who works for Pacific Wellcare, and Pete. During {{the latter half of the}} season, Violet was found to be pregnant although she did not know who the father of her baby was. Furthermore, Violet found herself and her unborn <b>baby</b> <b>at</b> the mercy of a psychotic patient bent on taking Violet's baby by any means necessary in the closing moments of the season finale. Meanwhile, Dell struggled with his own issues caused by his former girlfriend's drug habits and the fight for custody of his daughter Betsey. Some of the medical cases that caused a stir and tension among the doctors at Private Practice was the issue of abortion (a first for the practice), the sex reassignment of a newborn, the sexual activity of a 12-year-old, the switching of embryos for two mothers-to-be and a young couple who later discovered they were siblings.|$|E
