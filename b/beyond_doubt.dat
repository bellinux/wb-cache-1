5|$|It has {{recently}} been argued that a '12th century renaissance' occurred in Byzantium.

5|$|During the 19th century, strombid {{gastropods}} {{were believed}} to be carnivores. This erroneous conception was based on the writings of French naturalist Jean Baptiste Lamarck, whose classification scheme grouped strombids with carnivorous sea snails. Subsequent studies have refuted the concept, proving <b>beyond</b> <b>doubt</b> that strombid gastropods are herbivorous animals. In common with other Strombidae, Laevistrombus canarium is known to be a herbivore, feeding on algae and occasionally detritus.|$|E

5|$|His {{practice}} of dividing {{his time between}} Britain and America caused Wodehouse difficulties with the tax authorities of both countries. Both the UK Inland Revenue and the US Internal Revenue Service sought to tax him as a resident. After lengthy negotiations the matter was settled, but the Wodehouses decided to change their residential status <b>beyond</b> <b>doubt</b> by moving to France, where they bought a house near Le Touquet in northern France.|$|E

On December 21, 2008, Cassini passed directly over Ontario Lacus and observed specular reflection in radar. The strength of the reflection saturated the probe's receiver, indicating that the lake level did not vary by more than 3mm (implying either that surface winds were minimal, or the lake's hydrocarbon fluid is viscous).|$|E
5|$|Leuthen was {{the last}} battle at which Prince Charles {{commanded}} the Austrian Army, before his sister-in-law, Empress Maria Theresa, appointed him as governor of the Habsburg Netherlands and placed Leopold Joseph von Daun {{in command of the}} army.

After Rossbach (5 November), the French had refused to participate further in Austria's war with Prussia; after Leuthen (5 December), Austria could not.|$|E

5|$|Unable to {{definitely}} {{prove to}} the court where their money had come from, Daniel and Wilson were eventually found guilty, and sentenced to 14 years' hard labour. However, the maximum term the Magistrate could legally impose was three months, and in 1896 they were released at {{the order of the}} High Commissioner for Southern Africa, Sir Henry Brougham Loch. The High Commissioner's legal team subsequently quashed the convictions altogether, saying that the evidence against Daniel and Wilson was not sufficiently conclusive. The existence of Lobengula's box of sovereigns was never proven either way, and the incident never explained <b>beyond</b> <b>doubt.</b>|$|E
5|$|Strombid {{gastropods}} {{were widely}} accepted as carnivores by several authors in the 19th century, {{a concept that}} persisted until {{the first half of}} the 20th century. This erroneous idea originated in the writings of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, who classified strombids with other supposedly carnivorous snails. This idea was subsequently repeated by other authors, but were not supported by observation. Subsequent studies have refuted the concept, proving <b>beyond</b> <b>doubt</b> that strombid gastropods are herbivorous animals. In common with other Strombidae, Lobatus gigas is a specialized herbivore, that feeds on macroalgae (including red algae, such as species of Gracilaria and Hypnea), seagrass and unicellular algae, intermittently also feeding on algal detritus. The green macroalgae Batophora oerstedii is one of its preferred foods.|$|E
5|$|Carte, Gilbert and Sullivan now had the {{financial}} resources to produce shows themselves, without outside backers. Carte persuaded the author and composer that a business partnership among the three would be to their advantage, and they hatched a plan to separate themselves from {{the directors of the}} Comedy Opera Company. The contract between Gilbert and Sullivan and the Comedy Opera Company gave the latter the right to present Pinafore {{for the duration of the}} initial run. The Opera Comique was obliged to close for drain and sewer repairs, and it was renovated by E. W. Bradwell, from Christmas 1878 to the end of January 1879. Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte believed that this break ended the initial run, and, therefore, ended the company's rights. Carte put the matter <b>beyond</b> <b>doubt</b> by taking a six-month personal lease of the theatre beginning on 1 February 1879, the date of its re-opening, when Pinafore resumed. At the end of the six months, Carte planned to give notice to the Comedy Opera Company that its rights in the show and the theatre had ended.|$|E

40|$|Whatever {{is thought}} to be the {{purposes}} of criminal punishment, one fundamental principle seems to have evolved in the jurisprudence of the common law legal tradition; that, before an accused person can be convicted of a crime, his guilt must be proved <b>beyond</b> reasonable <b>doubt.</b> One may be tempted to conclude that the principle of proof <b>beyond</b> reasonable <b>doubt</b> is alive and well and little more need be said of it. Unfortunately, this is not so and the principle has been severely eroded and is in danger of being crippled beyond recognition. The makers and interpreters of our law seem bent on the creation of exceptions to the principle of proof <b>beyond</b> reasonable <b>doubt</b> for a host of insubstantial and unsubstantiated reasons...|$|R

5|$|Chelsea {{were drawn}} to play at home against Birmingham City in the Fifth Round, with Birmingham {{dominating}} the first half through a David Murphy goal. Daniel Sturridge scored {{in the second half}} to force a replay, which was played on 6 March at Birmingham, just two days after André Villas-Boas was relieved of his duties as Chelsea manager. Birmingham held Chelsea throughout the first half, and looked the stronger side at times, but after Mata and Raul Meireles scored twice in five minutes, Chelsea dominated the remainder of the game until the final whistle. In the Sixth Round, Chelsea overcame Leicester City at home in a 5–2 thriller. Gary Cahill scored his first FA Cup goal for Chelsea from a corner in the 12th minute, with Salomon Kalou following up five minutes later. In the second half, Fernando Torres ended a goal drought of over 25 hours to score, before Jermaine Beckford gave Leicester a late lifeline. Torres scored again in the 85th minute to put the result <b>beyond</b> <b>doubt,</b> although Ben Marshall grabbed one back three minutes later, before Meireles scored in the 90th minute to send Chelsea through to the semi-final.|$|E
