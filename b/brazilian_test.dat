40|$|Knowing the {{strength}} properties of rocks {{is essential for}} calculating the stability of natural slopes, constructions in and on rock, excavations, blasting geometry, crushing, and drilling. When rock and rock masses are subjected to either dynamic or static loads, the tensile strength is determined by tests appropriate to the load type. Static tests include both indirect tests, such as the <b>Brazilian</b> <b>test,</b> and direct tests like the dumbbell-shaped direct pull. Conventional dynamic tests are the Hopkinson pressure bar and ultrasonic methods. This work has two objectives: (1) to characterize diverse rocks in terms of dynamic and static tensile failure behavior, and (2) to conduct problem-based research for minimizing the generation of fines by-product in rock fragmentation and comminution. Two major processes of aggregate production are blasting and crushing operations. The rock is subjected mainly to tensile stresses and failure in both processes. A method for measuring the quantity of rock fines was suggested for the <b>Brazilian</b> <b>test.</b> A working hypothesis for {{reducing the amount of}} rock fines in the <b>Brazilian</b> <b>test</b> was examined. Moreover, an analytical solution for discs subjected to the <b>Brazilian</b> <b>test</b> was also presented; this facilitates an accurate analysis of the <b>Brazilian</b> <b>test</b> for anisotropic rocks. Also, a Hopkinson pressure bar was constructed and then modified to measure the dynamic uniaxial tensile strength of rock cores in which rock fails in pure tension. Results showed that, for a specific type of rock, generation of fines depends on the tensile strength of the rock. The higher the tensile strength, the higher is the percentage of fines produced. The working hypothesis that reduction of {{the strength}} of rock through water saturation should reduce fines generation was examined and shown to be true for the rocks tested.

The relationships between uniaxial compressive strength Sc, tensile strength St and water vapor pressure p can be represents by the following equation: long Sc ∝ -Nc log p and long St ∝ -Nt log p, where Nc and Nt are the inclination of lines.

40|$|International audienceImpact {{problems}} on reinforced concrete structures are usually computed with models coupling plasticity and isotropic damage. The induced damage anisotropy observed for quasi-brittle {{materials such as}} concrete is often reproduced considering different variables for tension and compression (not consistent with the thermodynamic framework). Introducing viscosity for both damage and plasticity evolutions enables to reproduce the strength enhancement due to rate effects. Such kinds of models present the main advantage to describe precisely each phenomenon locally observed (different rate effects in traction and compression, compaction under confined loadings [...] .) but require {{a large number of}} parameters. Anisotropic damage is quite relevant to describe the micro-cracking pattern and the failure conditions of quasi-brittle materials and structures. In concrete, a state of micro-cracks orthogonal to the loading direction in tension and parallel to it in compression is easily described by a second order damage variable. This anisotropic delay-damage model, used in this work, introduces only few parameters (7 including elasticity parameters E and ν) compared to the ones mentioned higher. The efficiency and the validation of such an approach is illustrated with its application on impacted reinforced concrete beams and dynamic <b>Brazilian</b> <b>tests.</b> The test has been performed with the drop-weight tower ORION of the CEA Saclay for two kinds of beam geometries in order to exhibit flexion and shear rupture. 1 INTRODUCTION The challenge of understanding the behavior of civil engineering structures under dynamic loading is usually linked to security issues but also some economic problems. Advances in instrumentation continue to improve our understanding on these subjects, so one continues around the world to develop impact tests on reinforced concrete structures. The civil engineering is one area where the tests are the most numerous. Indeed, it's only repeating the experiments and varying the parameters that we managed to understand the behavior of structures. But few cases where experiments are conducted on real structures with the stresses actually envisaged, are available. Moreover these experiments do not always provide more information than mockup models. Therefore, we find in the literature a large number of tests on simple structures such as slabs or beams. The philosophy of these kind of tests is to demonstrate on simple structures (beams, slabs) a number of local and global phenomena to allow modeling of more complex cases. Tests developed in the Dynamics Laboratory (DYN) of the CEA Saclay during this work include in this perspective. Two types of tests on a drop-weight tower were made: dynamic <b>Brazilian</b> <b>tests</b> and impact tests on beams. The dynamic <b>Brazilian</b> <b>tests</b> are relatively uncommon in the literature ((Tedesco, Ross, and Kuennen 1993) made the first dynamic <b>Brazilian</b> <b>tests</b> on split Hopkinson bars), but very interesting.

The impact tests on beams were designed to study the transition from a ductile failure mode (flexural) to a brittle fracture mode (shear cone). The two factors influencing this study are the slenderness of the beam and the transverse reinforcement (stirrups).

Raise of Question The tensile strength of rock refers to the tension of a unit area which is caused by Geotechnical {{engineering in}} tension damage [1]. Since the characteristic of the rock material is brittle, so its tensile strength is very difficult to measure directly, thus, the indirect methods are used to measure, mainly with <b>Brazilian</b> <b>test,</b> bending point load test and split method [1], wherein the <b>Brazilian</b> <b>test</b> is commonly used [2].

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to perform <b>Brazilian</b> <b>tests</b> in order to {{identify}} the tensile strength of alumina (Corbit 98). In this kind of test, generally used for brittle material in static field, a cylindrical specimen is diametrical compressed. As widely discussed in the technical literature, starting from a linear elastic hypothesis, the triaxial stress field generated in the disc has an unique positive component perpendicular to the loading diameter. For the materials with compression strength greater of some order of size respect in tension, the positive component, which is known, leads to the disc failure for separation along the loading diameter. The test is been adapted to dynamic conditions using a setup based on the Split Hopkinson Pressure Ba...|$|R
