5|$|Byron took Giraud {{to visit}} Charles Lewis Meryon, an English doctor who recounted the visit {{in his memoirs}} and noted Byron's vivid {{interest}} in the boy. Afterward, rumours were spread by Byron's servant that the consultation concerned an anal rupture. Meryon was a travelling companion with Michael <b>Bruce</b> <b>and</b> Lady Hester Stanhope, one of Byron's friends. Accounts from <b>Bruce</b> <b>and</b> Howe Browne, both witnesses to Byron's interactions with Giraud, provided confirmation of the relationship to Byron's early biographer Thomas Moore, although in disparaging terms. In mid-1810, Giraud acted as Byron's majordomo on their travels to the Peloponnese, {{and took care of}} Byron during his illness while at Patras, eventually becoming ill himself. After recovering, although still weak, the pair continued on their travels, arriving at Athens on 13October. By November they were joined by Lusieri, Louis François Sébastien Fauvel, who was a French consul, and a group of German academics.|$|E

5|$|Two local magistrates, J. <b>Bruce</b> <b>and</b> Anthony Hill, were {{stranded}} in the Castle Inn in Merthyr Tydfil. They swore in around 70 men as special constables, but they were heavily outnumbered by the radical crowds. Bruce wrote an urgent letter to Bute in Cardiff Castle, asking for urgent advice on whether to call in the armed forces, and querying whether the Marquess had readied the Militia for action. Huge crowds marched on the local iron works, stopping production. The messages from Merthyr Tydfil reached Bute that afternoon, who began to assemble the Eastern and Central Yeomanry militia units and transport ready for deployment. Bute paused until the morning, hoping to hear better news, but messengers bought more desperate news from <b>Bruce</b> <b>and</b> Hill, and the Yeomanry were dispatched. Meanwhile, an 80-man unit of the 93rd Foot {{had arrived in the}} Castle Inn from Brecon. Bute continued to keep Whitehall informed of the events by letter throughout.|$|E

5|$|A common idea in {{the comics}} is that Bruce saw a Zorro film with his parents before they were murdered.

It is for this reason Nolan believes other DC characters do not exist in the universe of his film; otherwise, Wayne's reasons for taking up costumed vigilantism would have been very different.|$|E
