The {{international}} dairy sector {{is one of}} the most heavily protected commodity sectors in agriculture. Following the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade liberalization all nontariff barriers to trade were converted, through the process of tariffication, into tariffs. However, in the dairy sector, the <b>border</b> <b>measure</b> most commonly adopted by developed countries was a system of tariff rate quotas. Tariff rate quotas are two-tiered tariffs which allow a small quantity of the product to be imported at a low or zero tariff, while quantities above the minimum access amount are charged much higher and often prohibitive tariffs. Tariff rate quotas cause the excess supply curve facing an importing country to be discontinuous at the minimum access amount. The objective of this paper is to review key issues related to modeling trade liberalization for the international dairy economy, given the existence of tariff rate quotas and export subsidies.

40|$|This study {{examines}} how domestic price discrimination between fluid and manufacturing milk influences dairy trade. Two types of dairy models {{are used for}} the study. The first one is a stylized mathematical model {{which is used to}} explore the relative trade effects of domestic price discrimination accompanied with revenue pooling mechanism versus <b>border</b> <b>measures</b> in dairy product markets. The second one is a partial equilibrium, multiple-region model of dairy policy and trade, which is used to see the empirical implication of domestic price discrimination for six major dairy producers. The analytical results identify the trading status as the key to determine the relative trade effects. While domestic price discrimination is always less trade distorting than <b>border</b> <b>measures</b> in a net-importer case, the relative trade distortiveness depends on the export volume in a net exporter case. The theoretical possibility that domestic price discrimination is more trade distorting than <b>border</b> <b>measures</b> is found when the ratio of dairy export to domestic manufacturing milk consumption is very high. The results also indicate that while the both support measures increase dairy export, domestic price discrimination may place greater economic burden on fluid milk consumers and less economic burden on tax payers than <b>border</b> <b>measures.</b> In addition, the results imply that domestic price discrimination schemes can be effective trade protective measures for Canada, Japan and the United States, where the schemes are currently being implemented. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. ...|$|R

50|$|Monetary {{compensatory}} amounts (MCAs) were <b>border</b> <b>measures</b> in the EU consisting of taxes and subsidies formerly applicable to intra-EC trade in agricultural and food products for which intervention prices were set. These <b>border</b> <b>measures</b> were made necessary {{by the fact}} that intervention prices were set in ECUs and converted into national currency terms at green rates, set at levels different from commercial market rates. This gave rise to price differentials between member nations (in market ECUs) that would influence intra-EC trade if not offset by the MCAs.

40|$|This paper {{goes beyond}} the {{orthodox}} considerations of <b>border</b> <b>measure</b> effects on trade distortions by highlighting how subsidies affect producer’s ability to cover the fixed cost, and distort aggregate production and prices. The theoretical arguments on trade distortions often hold that border measures are the most trade distorting. A number of empirical studies also hold the same line of argument. The results of these studies reveal that tariff barriers in OECD countries actually inflict more damage than subsidies on developing countries. Therefore, major source of gains for developing countries would arise from removal of tariffs, rather than subsidies in OECD countries. The present paper would like to empirically verify the validity of this argument by highlighting the real nature and dimensions of domestic support provided by the {{major player in the}} world market; i. e. US and its impact on production, cost of production and prices.

40|$|Numerous {{political}} {{statements by}} the world leaders on the urgency of reaching an ambitious climate deal in Copenhagen notwithstanding, the actual discussions at the UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) continue to be shrouded by daunting North-South divide, dimming the hope of sealing a deal in December 2009. The negotiating climate has been further queered by the European Union (EU) and the United States (US), which have, in the recent past, made attempts to include certain unilateral trade measures in their domestic climate change regimes. Among the issues that have fuelled the debates on the climate-trade interface {{in the run-up to}} Copenhagen, perhaps the most contested one is the proposed use by developed countries of border measures on imports from countries (read ‘major-emitting’ developing countries) not implementing comparable GHG (green house gas) emissions reduction policies on the grounds of addressing the risk of what has been coined as ‘carbon leakage’. The issue of carbon leakage has its origin in the purported apprehension in these developed countries that in the energy intensive, trade-exposed sectors, the carbon costs imposed by their domestic climate policies (e. g. carbon tax or cap-and-trade scheme) will put domestic producers at a competitive disadvantage vis-à-vis producers in countries not imposing similarly strict carbon constraints. It is argued that if stringent domestic climate action causes their firms to relocate to other countries with less stringent or no carbon constraint, or to lose market share to firms from countries having low emission standards, then the emission reduction achieved in countries imposing stringent measures will be offset to a great extent by an increase in emissions elsewhere. According to the developed countries, such carbon leakage could end up undermining the environmental integrity of the carbon constraining domestic policy measures. In keeping with the above arguments, law makers in both the US and the EU have proposed introduction of carbon tariffs in order to obviate the disadvantages that their domestic products may face vis-à- vis imports as a result of emission reduction measures being adopted by them. While the inclusion of such onerous proposals in the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009 (the Waxman-Markey Bill), as approved by the US House of Representatives in the end-June 2009, has generated significant furore over the past several months, somewhat similar provisions were already included in the post- 2012 climate change and energy package finalized by the EU in December 2008. It is widely argued by developing countries that such carbon tariffs on imports would be akin to protectionism in the guise of preventing global warming. Concerns have emerged among the so-called ‘major-emitting developing countries’ (such as, China and India), who are the main target of such measures, that these measures could act as a discriminatory market access barrier affecting their exports to the developed countries concerned in energy intensive sectors that may come under the purview of these measures. Hence, it is apprehended by them that the proposals to impose such carbon tariffs may act as an effective threat to induce them to undertake binding emission reduction commitments in the ongoing climate negotiations. It is this tacit protectionist intent allegedly underlying the proposed border measures that has triggered a huge furore among the developing countries. Another controversial issue pertaining to such carbon tariffs is whether they could be compatible with the WTO (World Trade Organization) commitments of the countries introducing such measures. This concern has found reflection not only in the post- 2012 climate-energy package of the EU itself, but also in the debates on the domestic climate legislations in the EU and US. Against this backdrop, this paper makes an attempt to analyze the WTO compatibility or otherwise of the <b>border</b> <b>measure</b> proposed by the EU in its post- 2012 climate- energy package. The analysis focuses on two sets of issues: (i) whether the proposed <b>border</b> <b>measure</b> could conform to the ‘border tax adjustment’ provisions and the Most Favoured Nation (MFN) clause of the GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade), and if not then (ii) whether the EU could justify it under the ‘General Exceptions’ provisions included in Article XX of the GATT that allow WTO Members, subject to certain conditions included in its chapeau, to deviate from their GATT obligations to serve certain legitimate policy objectives, including environmental objectives. The analysis presented in this paper indicates that the EU could face significant difficulties in establishing that the proposed <b>border</b> <b>measure</b> would be WTO-compliant. However, the devil would finally lie in the details. World Trade Organisation, Carbon Leakage, United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change...|$|E
40|$|The {{international}} climate mitigation regime, {{notably the}} Kyoto Protocol, {{has so far}} proven to be largely unsuccessful at slowing down the trend of increasing greenhouse gas emissions. Incomplete participation {{and the lack of}} any enforcing mechanism in IEAs are cited as the reason for the failure climate agreements like Kyoto. Coalition stability literature suggests the use of trade restrictions like border carbon adjustments complementary to climate policy with respect to their potential to generate greater cooperation and serve as enforcement of international environmental agreements. A variety of political, economic and legal reasons have so far prevented any meaningful use of border adjustments in conjunction with IEAs. Therefore, to assess the implications of border adjustments for participation and stability of climate coalitions, I develop a model of multilateral trade extended to climate concerns by way of domestic carbon prices and a border tariff adjustment levied on outsiders to the coalition. The model is solved analytically by allowing players to strategically optimize their carbon pricing decisions with and without the adjustment in a partial cooperation setting. Using the concept of internal and external stability, comparison between scenarios produces the result that a border tariff adjustment levied on imports unambiguously increases participation in the IEA as well as stability of larger coalitions. Further, the imposition of the <b>border</b> <b>measure</b> proves to be both credible and environmentally effective because it increases the welfare of the coalition and {{the world as a whole}} as well as reduces emissions by depressing output...|$|E

40|$|By its title, the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) {{considers}} {{itself a}} trade agreement. The negotiating parties, {{as well as}} its main proponents, emphasise the importance of strong intellectual property (IP) enforcement standards for international trade in IP protected goods. At the same time, the <b>border</b> <b>measure</b> rules in the ACTA draft text carry the potential to create significant barriers to international trade, especially in generic medicines. The controversy over transhipments of generic drugs from India to various developing countries seized while in transit through ports of EU member states demonstrates this potential: Merely on the basis of alleged patent infringements in the transit country, custom authorities seized several shipments of generic drugs - although the drugs did not violate any patents in the country of origin or the country of destination. Against the background of the EU transit seizure cases and the recent initiation of WTO dispute settlement proceedings by India and Brazil against the EU, this article examines the ACTA provisions on border measures. It focuses on the consistency of the ACTA rules with the existing international standards on IP enforcement and free trade under the WTO Agreement on Trade related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). Although primarily perceived as setting a floor of minimum standards only, some TRIPS provisions contain maximum standards or ‘ceilings’ for IP protection and enforcement beyond TRIPS standards. This in turn raises the question how ACTA rules relate to TRIPS standards, in particular those on border measures, as a matter of international law...|$|E

We match data on behind-the-border measures (e. g., bailouts and subsidies) and <b>border</b> <b>measures</b> implemented through April 2010 to monthly HS 4 -digit bilateral trade data. Our estimation strategy relies on a first-differenced gravity equation and timevarying fixed effects to disentangle the impact of new discriminatory measures. Trade in exporterimporter pairs subject to new measures decreased by 5 to 8 percent relative to trade in the same product among pairs not subject to new measures. These product-level results imply global trade declines at the aggregate level of about 0. 2 percent, or $ 30 - 35 billion a year. These aggregate figures would be higher, if one third of measures had not been excluded due to incomplete data.

The former includes tariffs and other <b>border</b> <b>measures,</b> subsidies and non-tariff barriers. The effect on trade flows resulting from issues of transparency is indirect. When the rules of trade are unclear for firms considering investing in trade related activities, the risks associated with those investments increase and investment is inhibited. If there is less investment in trade related activities, trade flows will be reduced. Poor transparency exists in contingent protection measures such as anti-dumping – currently on the agenda of the Rules negotiations at the WTO and – customs and related procedures – on the agenda in the Trade Facilitation negotiations. Increasing transparency can have important trade liberalizing effects. Trade negotiators often focus on achieving a big result from reductions in <b>border</b> <b>measures</b> and subsidies where there may be considerable resistance from protectionist vested interests.
