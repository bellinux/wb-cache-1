5|$|Because of {{the last}} years' massive urban development, in 2005 some areas of Cluj were named as districts (Sopor, Borhanci, Becaș, Făget, Zorilor South), <b>but</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> are still {{construction}} sites. Beside these, {{there are some other}} building areas like Tineretului, Lombului or Oser, which are likely to become districts in the following years.|$|E

They went down the Ems toward the North Sea, but as they reached the sea, a storm struck, sinking many of the boats and killing many men and horses.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the race}} started, 78 riders {{had signed up}} for the race. Eighteen of those did not start the race, so the Tour began with 60 riders, {{including}} former winner Henri Cornet and future winners René Pottier and Lucien Petit-Breton. The riders were not grouped in teams, <b>but</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> rode with an individual sponsor. Two of the cyclists—Catteau and Lootens—were Belgian, all other cyclists were French. Leading up {{to the start of the}} Tour, Wattelier, Trousselier, Pottier and Augereau were all considered the most likely contenders to win the event.|$|E
5|$|Most {{research}} has focused on thrips species that feed on economically significant crops. Some species are predatory, <b>but</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> feed on pollen and the chloroplasts harvested from the outer layer of plant epidermal and mesophyll cells. They prefer tender parts of the plant, such as buds, flowers and new leaves. Besides feeding on plant tissues, the common blossom thrips feeds on pollen grains and on the eggs of mites. When the larva supplements its diet in this way, its development time and mortality is reduced, and adult females that consume mite eggs increase their fecundity and longevity.|$|E
5|$|In {{his first}} {{address to the}} legislature, Morehead {{recommended}} a plan of expanded internal improvements, including improvements along the state's rivers. The legislature responded by creating a state board of internal improvements, and named Morehead the ex-officio president of the board. In this role, he authorized many surveys of Kentucky's rivers and formulated several plans for improvements, <b>but</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> were blocked by the Panic of 1837. One improvement that did proceed was construction of the Lexington and Ohio Railroad, which was completed in 1835. Though education was not {{a high priority for}} Governor Morehead, the Kentucky Common School Society and the Kentucky Association of Professional Teachers were formed during his term.|$|E

5|$|Many other {{inorganic}} thorium compounds with polyatomic anions are known, {{such as the}} perchlorates, sulfates, sulfites, nitrates, carbonates, phosphates, vanadates, molybdates, and chromates, {{and their}} hydrated forms. They are important in thorium purification and the disposal of nuclear waste, <b>but</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> {{have not yet been}} fully characterised, especially regarding their structural properties. For example, thorium nitrate is produced by reacting thorium hydroxide with nitric acid: it is soluble in water and alcohols and is an important intermediate in the purification of thorium and its compounds. Thorium complexes with organic ligands, such as oxalate, citrate, and EDTA, are much stronger and tend to occur naturally in natural thorium-containing waters in concentrations orders of magnitude higher than the inorganic complexes.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Dean, at {{its second}} landfall, dropped 4 to 8in (100 to 200mm) of {{rainfall}} across {{the western states}} of Jalisco and Nayarit. This rainfall trigged a mudslide in Jalisco which fell on 10houses and killed one of the occupants. Landslides in Puebla killed five people, and another was crushed when a wall in his house collapsed. One person in Veracruz was electrocuted after touching a power line while repairing his roof. In Michoacán, as the outer bands of the storm swept over the state, a man sheltering under a tree was struck by lightning. Two women died in Hidalgo when heavy rain collapsed their house's roof. Another man drowned while trying to cross a rain-swollen river in Tlacolula, Oaxaca. The heavy rains caused dozens of smaller landslides throughout the country, particularly in Veracruz and Tabasco, <b>but</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> caused no fatalities. At least 50,000houses were damaged to varying degrees throughout the country. Although Dean's rains caused flooding as far inland as Mexico City, where they closed a portion of Puebla-Mexico highway, the damage was concentrated in the states of Quintana Roo and Veracruz.|$|E
5|$|Martín de Álzaga began a mutiny {{to remove}} Liniers. On January1, 1809, an open cabildo (an {{extraordinary}} meeting of vecinos, prominent {{people of the}} city) chaired by Álzaga demanded the resignation of Liniers and {{the appointment of a}} local junta. The Spanish militia and a group of people summoned by the meeting gathered to support the rebellion. A small number of criollos, notably Mariano Moreno, supported the mutiny, <b>but</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> did not. They felt that Álzaga wanted to remove the Viceroy to avoid his political authority while keeping the social differences between criollos and peninsulars unchanged. The riot was quickly routed when criollo militias led by Cornelio Saavedra surrounded the plaza and dispersed the insurgents. As a result of the failed mutiny, the rebel militias were disarmed. This included all peninsular militias, {{and the power of the}} criollos increased as a result. The leaders of the plot, with the exception of Moreno, were exiled to Carmen de Patagones. Javier de Elío freed them and gave them political asylum at Montevideo.|$|E

5|$|In Gotham City, {{some time}} after {{defeating}} the Penguin, the crime fighter Batman defuses a hostage situation caused by a criminal known as Two-Face, the alter ego of the former district attorney Harvey Dent, but Two-Face escapes and remains at large. Edward Nygma, a researcher at Wayne Enterprises who idolizes Bruce Wayne, has developed a device that can beam television into a person's brain. Bruce offers to let Nygma come up with schematics for the device {{and set up a}} meeting with his assistant. However, after Nygma demands an answer from him immediately, Bruce rejects the invention, believing it to be too close to mind manipulation. After killing his supervisor Fred Stickley, Nygma resigns and seeks retaliation against Bruce for rejecting his invention and begins to send him riddles (Nygma rigs the security cameras to record Stickley committing suicide, as well as a suicide note, which everybody believes but Bruce Wayne doubts this is the truth) A news report reveals how Harvey Dent became Two-Face: when he was prosecuting a mob boss named Sal Maroni, Maroni threw acid on Dent's face, disfiguring half of it. Batman tried to save him, but failed. After the incident, Dent seeks to kill Batman for failing to save him. Bruce meets Chase Meridian, a psychiatrist who is obsessed with Batman, and invites her to come with him to a circus event. After a performance from the circus performers, The Flying Graysons, Two-Face arrives and threatens to blow up the circus unless Batman comes forward and surrenders his life to him. The Flying Graysons attempt to stop Two-Face, <b>but</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> get killed as a result. Only Dick Grayson, the youngest member, survives as he climbs to the roof and throws Two-Face's bomb into a river.|$|E
