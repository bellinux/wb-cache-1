25|$|In 1954, Japan budgeted 230 million yen {{for nuclear}} energy, marking the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>program.</b> The Atomic Energy Basic Law limited {{activities}} to only peaceful purposes. The first nuclear reactor in Japan {{was built by}} the UK's GEC and was commissioned in 1966. In the 1970s, the first light water reactors were built in cooperation with American companies. These plants were bought from U.S. vendors such as General Electric and Westinghouse with contractual work done by Japanese companies, who would later get a license themselves to build similar plant designs. Developments in nuclear power since that time have seen contributions from Japanese companies and research institutes {{on the same level}} as the other big users of nuclear power. Between the early 1970s and today, the Japanese government promoted the siting of nuclear power plants through a variety of policy instruments involving soft social control and financial incentives. By offering large subsidies and public works projects to rural communities and by using educational trips, junkets for local government officials, and OpEds written as news by pro-nuclear supporters, the central government won over the support of depopulating, hard-on-their-luck coastal towns and villages.|$|E
500|$|The current routing of M-15 was {{designated}} after 1926. The southern end was located at US10 in Clarkston running north to M-38 and M-24 in Vassar.

By June 1942, the M-24 concurrency was removed as M-24 was realigned to replace M-85 [...] between Vassar and Caro. By July 1, 1960, the northern end was extended to run concurrently with M-25 and BUSUS23 to US23 {{on the west side}} of Bay City. This M-15/M-25 routing was extended again in the next year to end at the new I-75/US10/US23 freeway. These two northerly extensions were both reversed and scaled back in 1970.

500|$|The Department of Conservation {{has since}} 1993 carried out annual culls and muster of Kaimanawas {{to keep the}} herd {{population}} around a target level of 500 horses. The target will be reduced to 300 horses in stages starting in 2009. These horses are either taken directly to slaughter or are placed at holding farms for later slaughter or adoption by private homes. [...] A main reason for the strict population control {{is to protect the}} habitat in which they live. This habitat includes 16 plant species listed as endangered, which the Kaimanawa may endanger further through trampling and overgrazing. These plants include herbs, grasses, sedges, flowers and mistletoes; among these are Deschampsia caespitosa (a very rare tussock grass), Peraxilla tetrapetala (a vulnerable mistletoe) and Libertia peregrinans (a possibly locally extinct sand iris). The 2009 culling of the population removed 230 horses from the herd, the largest culling since the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>program,</b> with homes found for 85% of the horses removed. Conservation of these horses is an important matter to the public, and between 1990 and 2003 the New Zealand Minister for Conservation received more public comments on the Kaimanawa horse than on any other subject. In this period, more than 1,400 requests for information and letters were received, with public interest peaking in 1996 and 1997. This was due to a program of population reduction by shooting scheduled to begin implementation in 1996; due to public opposition the shooting was cancelled and a large scale muster and adoption program began in 1997. In 1997, around 1,069 horses were removed from the range and adopted, reducing the main herd to around 500, and reducing their range to around 25,000ha from around 70,000. Since 1993, a total of around 2,800 horses have been removed from the range. Only one injury resulting in the death of a horse is known to have occurred.|$|E

The act authorized expansion to 1,800 airplanes, 1,650 officers, and 15,000 enlisted men, to be reached in regular increments over a five-year period. None of the goals were reached by July 1932. Neither of the relatively modest increases in airplanes or officers was accomplished until 1938 because adequate funds were never appropriated and the coming of the Great Depression forced reductions in pay and modernization across the board in the Army. Organizationally the Air Corps doubled from seven to fifteen groups, but the expansion was meaningless because all were seriously understrength in aircraft and pilots.
