40|$|By the {{advances}} in high frequency communication systems, and particularly Internet, wide bandwidth and high-speed transistors became key devices for the circuits. Especially, optical fibres can transport data at high rates. Therefore, high-speed electronics {{is necessary for}} all kind of data processing. One limitation is the ultra high frequency modulation of the light for data transport. This requires high frequency and high voltage of operation. Second, high linearity of amplification is necessary for analog-to-digital conversion (ADCs). Indium Phosphide based Heterojunction Bipolar Transistors (InP HBTs) {{have the potential to}} provide high speed and high voltage for optoelectronic communication ICs. Moreover, since their energy band gap corresponds to the 1. 3 and 1. 55 µm wavelength, which are the wavelengths providing minimum optical loss in fibres, InP HBTs are the best choices for optical communication circuits. In this work, a process technology is developed for HBTs capable of 80 Gbit/s. The theory and also careful analysis have shown that the main limitations for the device speed are the <b>base-collector</b> <b>capacitances</b> and base resistances. Various designs are proposed to lower RC time constant. The influence of emitter size is observed on RF performance and for optical lithography it is found out that emitters with area of 1 x 15 µm 2 provides the best RF performance. Another important aspect is to lower any additional parasitic effects. Therefore directly contacted emitters are proposed to eliminate parasitic components caused by dummy pads and to dissipate the heat overall the emitter efficiently. Since the contact spacing between base and emitter plays an important role for base resistance, emitter contacts are patterned perpendicular to the major flat for low underetching. In addition to this, emitter mesa wet chemical etching process is optimised and 170 nm of underetching is achieved, which is sufficient to realize 1 µm width emitters. A mask set is designed offering directly contacted emitters and reliable processes. To reduce the base resistance, Pt/Ti/Pt/Au contact metal system providing 4 x 10 ? 7 Ohm. cm 2 contact resistance, is used on the base layer. Moreover, current density is also an important aspect for the RF performance. The well-known Kirk Effect is analysed and the collector layer is doped to improve the maximum current density. 1 x 1017 cm- 3 of collector doping density has doubled the maximum current density in comparison to the HBTs with non-intentionally doped collector layers. For HBTs with an emitter area of 1 x 15 µm 2 on the optimised layer structure, presented maximum oscillation frequency (fmax) of 330 GHz and cut-off frequency (fT) of 170 GHz at 1. 2 mA/µm 2. 1 µm is the minimum width achievable by wet chemical etching. But on the other hand, for ultra high speed HBTs, submicron emitters are dispensable. Therefore, an ICP-RIE process with Cl 2 /N 2 chemistry providing less emitter underetching is optimised. According to this, dry etching processes offering etch rate of 120 nm/min up to 1200 nm/min are optimised. For HBTs lower etch rate, vertical sidewall profile less damage to the surface are important aspects. An etch rate of 120 nm/min is sufficient for emitter mesa etching. Therefore, this process is investigated in details. It is found out that, RMS surface roughness less than 5 nm, ± 5 % uniformity over 2 ” wafer and ± 5 % run-to-run stability can be achieved at this low etch rates. Since the dry etching with this chemistry is not selective for InP and InGaAs, a hybrid etching process is sufficient to complete the emitter mesa etching. With this hybrid etching, the selectivity problem is solved with an emitter underetching of 85 nm. HBTs with an emitter area of 0. 5 x 7. 5 µm 2 processed with hybrid etching, has shown a maximum oscillation frequency of 370 GHz and a cut-off frequency of 165 GHz. Not only the RF performance but also the uniformity of the HBT properties is also an important aspect for circuit applications. Hbyrid etching process offers better homogeneity in terms of etching in comparison to the solely wet chemical etching. The samples etched with wet chemical etching have shown dc current gain 41 with 4 % standard deviation where the solely etched ones have presented dc current gain of 64 with 7 % standard deviation. The yield for both type of processing is more than 90 %.

Envelope elimination and restoration was compared to other efficiency enhancement techniques and determined to likely be the most suitable solution for implementation of multimode, multiband portable RF transmitters. Distortion, stemming from dynamic power-supply modulation of RF transistors in EER RF power amplifiers was identified as one of the key challenges to the development of commercially viable EER transmitters. This dissertation presents a study of phase distortion in RF power amplifiers (PAs) with emphasis on identification of the origins of phase distortion in EER RF power amplifiers. Circuit-level techniques for distortion mitigation are also presented. Memory effects in conventional power amplifiers are investigated through the accurate measurement and analysis of phase asymmetry of out-of-band distortion components. Novel physically-based power amplifier model is developed for attributing measured memory effects to their physical origin. The amount of linearity correction, obtained through pre-distortion for a particular RF power amplifier, is then correlated to the behavior of the memory effects in the corresponding PA. Heterojunction field-effect transistor and heterojunction bipolar transistor amplifiers are used for investigation of voltage-dependent phase distortion in handset EER RF PAs. The distortion is found to stem from vector addition of signals, generated in nonlinear circuit elements of the PA. Specifically, nonlinear <b>base-collector</b> <b>capacitance</b> and downconversion of distortion components from second harmonic frequency are found to be the dominant sources of phase distortion. Shorting of second harmonic is proposed as a way to reduce the distortion contribution of the downconverted signal. Phase distortion is reduced by 50 %, however a slight degradation in the amplitude distortion is observed. Push-pull architecture is proposed for EER RF power amplifiers to cancel distortion components, generated in the nonlinear <b>base-collector</b> <b>capacitance.</b> Push-pull implementation enables a 67 % reduction in phase distortion, accompanied by a 1 - 2 dB reduction in amplitude distortion in EER RF power amplifiers.

40|$|The {{design and}} the {{optimization}} of electronic systems often requires a detailed knowledge of the inherent noise generated within semiconductor active devices, constituting the core of such systems. Examples of applications in which noise is a key issue include receiver front-ends in radiofrequency (RF) and optoelectronic transmission systems, front-end stages in sensors and also oscillators and mixers. The rapid growth of the silicon- (Si-) based RF electronics has triggered increasing interest towards low-noise Si-based devices, such as silicon-germanium (SiGe) heterojunction bipolar transistors (HBT's). In this context, modeling of the high-frequency noise can be considered an essential tool for the optimization of noise performance at both technological level (device design) and circuit level (circuit design). This thesis addresses the problem of high-frequency noise modeling in Si(Ge) bipolar transistors. As remarked throughout the treatise, accurate and reliable noise predictions must rely on a careful analysis of the carrier transport in the intrinsic transistor {{as well as of}} the impact of the parasitics constituting the extrinsic part of the device. The relative impact of the extrinsic and intrinsic part on noise characteristics depends upon bias conditions.

Such analytical results provide a method for the extraction of the base resistance distribution. From Chapter 3 on, the analysis steps into the intrinsic device level, focusing on the transport process of the minority carriers injected into the quasi-neutral base region. Chapter 3 provides a thorough review of selected most seminal contributions to the noise modeling theory of bipolar devices, namely Van der Ziel's collective approach, Polder-Baelde's equivalent network and Van Vliet's analytical approach based on the Green's function approach. Chapter 3 serves as theoretical basis for the subsequent chapters. In Chapter 4 a noise modeling approach is presented based on a lumped network. Such network is the result of a discretization of the partial differential equations governing the transport process of minority carriers injected into the quasi-neutral base region. The proposed approach is first verified based on analytical reasoning and then through the assessment of noise characteristics of a complete industrial SiGe HBT. Chapter 5 presents a comparative analysis of approximated high-frequency noise model formulations for the intrinsic transistor. The analysis includes the approximated transport noise model feasible for compact model implementations and a correlated noise model derived systematically from theoretical results discussed in Chapter 3, along with the non quasi-static theory of bipolar transistors. In the last part of the chapter a discussion over the impact of the high-frequency effects in the emitter region is profiled.
