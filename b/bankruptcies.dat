5|$|The panic of 1907 {{occurred}} during a lengthy economic contraction—measured by the National Bureau of Economic Research as occurring between May 1907 and June 1908. The interrelated contraction, bank panic and falling stock market resulted in significant economic disruption. Industrial production dropped further than after any previous bank run, while 1907 saw the second-highest volume of <b>bankruptcies</b> to that date. Production fell by 11%, imports by 26%, while unemployment rose to 8% from under 3%. Immigration dropped to 750,000 people in 1909, from 1.2 million two years earlier.|$|E
5|$|Elcor was {{a mining}} location, {{built by the}} mining company to house the workers for its mines.

The desolate property changed hands often through acquisitions, mergers and <b>bankruptcies.</b> In 1993 the Inland Steel Company began stripping the overburden from Elcor's former location for what is now the Minorca mine.|$|E
40|$|In {{response}} to {{a gap in the}} corporate <b>bankruptcy</b> literature, this Article offers a new positive theory of corporate <b>bankruptcy</b> law based on virtue ethics. The dominant theory of corporate <b>bankruptcy</b> law—-the creditors’ bargain model-—is necessarily incomplete because it does not account for <b>bankruptcy</b> courts’ equitable and discretionary powers, or for <b>bankruptcy</b> courts’ need to consider decision-making criteria other than economic efficiency. By contrast, virtue ethics offers insights about these features of corporate <b>bankruptcy</b> law for at least three reasons. First, <b>bankruptcy</b> courts appear to give content to <b>bankruptcy</b> laws by using virtue ethical principles. Second, virtue ethics’ decision-making process—-practical wisdom-—provides insights into how <b>bankruptcy</b> judges balance concerns about efficiency, justice, and fairness when reaching decisions. This is particularly true when the <b>bankruptcy</b> court’s equitable jurisdiction or discretionary powers are implicated. Third, virtue ethics’ symbiotic consideration of means and ends parallels the process <b>bankruptcy</b> judges are called on to use when exercising their discretionary or equitable powers under numerous provisions of the <b>Bankruptcy</b> Code...|$|R

5|$|In foreign policy, Grant {{sought to}} {{increase}} trade and influence while remaining at peace with the world. With Secretary of State Hamilton Fish, he successfully resolved the Alabama claims through the Treaty of Washington with Great Britain. Grant and Fish negotiated a peaceful resolution with Spain over the Virginius Affair. Congress rejected Grant's initiative to annex the Dominican Republic, creating a rift among Republicans. His administration implemented a gold standard and sought to strengthen the dollar. Grant's immediate response to the Panic of 1873 failed to halt a severe industrial depression that produced high unemployment, deflation, and <b>bankruptcies.</b> When Grant left office in 1877, he embarked on a two-year world tour that captured favorable global attention for him and the United States.|$|E

Shortly afterwards, federal regulators began an investigation into {{hundreds of millions of}} dollars in missing customer funds. Corzine resigned as CEO on November 4, 2011, after having retained the services of defense attorney Andrew J. Levander. It was reported that Corzine declined a severance package worth $12.1 million.

5|$|As the Cambodian {{economy was}} stagnating due to {{systemic}} corruption, Sihanouk opened two casinosin Phnom Penh and Sihanoukvillein January 1969. While the casinos satisfied his aim of generating state revenues {{of up to}} 700 million riels in that year, it also caused {{a sharp increase in}} the number of <b>bankruptcies</b> and suicides. In August 1969 Lon Nol was reappointed as Prime Minister, with Sisowath Sirik Matak as his deputy. Two months later, Lon Nol left Cambodia to seek medical treatment, leaving Sirik Matak to run the government. Between October and December 1969, Sirik Matak instituted several policy changes that ran contrary to Sihanouk's wishes, such as allowing private banks to re-open in the country and devaluing the riel. He also encouraged ambassadors to write to Lon Nol directly, instead of going through Sihanouk, angering the latter. In early January 1970 Sihanouk left Cambodia for medical treatment in France. Shortly after he left, Sirik Matak took the opportunity to close down the casinos.|$|E

5|$|His {{first great}} coup was when in 1834 he {{successfully}} bought out the Morris Canal and Banking Company, machinations which pushed {{its stock price}} from $10 ($ today) per share in December 1834 to $185 ($ today) a share in January 1835, at which point Little chose to collect his debts. Although theoretically he could have asked for more (he was, after all, in total control of the company), Little chose not to force the issue because he feared the resulting <b>bankruptcies</b> would destabilize the market potentially cause a collapse. He repeated this feat in September of the same year, cornering stocks {{for the construction of}} the Harlem Railroad. Approximately 60,000 shares had been sold short by that time, but only 7,000 shares had yet been issued; needless to say, Little prospered immensely.|$|E
5|$|In 1891 Joyce wrote a poem on {{the death}} of Charles Stewart Parnell. His father was angry at the {{treatment}} of Parnell by the Catholic church, the Irish Home Rule Party and the British Liberal Party and the resulting collaborative failure to secure Home Rule for Ireland. The Irish Party had dropped Parnell from leadership. But the Vatican's role in allying with the British Conservative Party to prevent Home Rule left a lasting impression on the young Joyce. The elder Joyce had the poem printed and even sent a part to the Vatican Library. In November of that same year, John Joyce was entered in Stubbs' Gazette (a publisher of <b>bankruptcies)</b> and suspended from work. In 1893, John Joyce was dismissed with a pension, beginning the family's slide into poverty caused mainly by his drinking and financial mismanagement.|$|E
5|$|Wien Air Alaska, {{which had}} its {{headquarters}} in Fairbanks, was the state's largest private employer until it declared bankruptcy in 1983. The resulting shutdown cost hundreds of jobs in Fairbanks. This was a foretaste of more problems to come. In 1986, Saudi Arabia boosted oil production and oil prices plummeted. Alaska banks failed, construction came to a halt, and <b>bankruptcies</b> and foreclosures were common. A common practice in Fairbanks was for workers to drop their house keys off at local banks before catching a flight out of Alaska, the better to speed the foreclosure process. Although an expansion of Fort Wainwright helped the construction industry during this time, Fairbanks lost about 3,000 jobs between 1986 and 1989. The U.S. Army's 6th Infantry Division was stationed at Fort Wainwright in late 1987, but it {{was reduced to a}} single brigade and renamed in 1993.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the relation between}} prior "Wall Street Journal (WSJ) " announcements of possible <b>bankruptcy</b> filings and price reactions to subsequent <b>bankruptcy</b> filings for 336 firms that filed for <b>bankruptcy</b> between 1980 and 1993. Extant research indicates that price reactions to announcements of economic events are inversely related {{to the amount of}} surprise in the announcements. Prior "WSJ" anouncements of possible <b>bankruptcy</b> filings increase the markets "a priori" assessment of firms' probability of <b>bankruptcy,</b> thereby potentially reducing the surprise in subsequent <b>bankruptcy</b> filings. We hypothesize smaller price reactions to <b>bankruptcy</b> filings for firms where the "WSJ" previously published an article indicating that the firm may file for <b>bankruptcy.</b> Our results are consistent with this hypothesis.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we develop a {{quantitative}} model of entrepreneurial activity (risk-taking) and consumer <b>bankruptcy</b> choices {{and use the}} model to {{study the effects of}} <b>bankruptcy</b> regulations on entrepreneurial activity, <b>bankruptcy</b> rate and welfare. We show that eliminating <b>bankruptcy</b> exemptions leads to a modest increase in the fraction of entrepreneurs, a large decrease in the overall <b>bankruptcy</b> rate and a significant welfare gain. In contrast, eliminating the whole consumer <b>bankruptcy</b> system leads to a large fall in the fraction of entrepreneurs and a substantial welfare loss. These two findings suggest that the consumer <b>bankruptcy</b> system is desirable but it must be well-designed with regard to <b>bankruptcy</b> asset exemptions. In particular, excessive <b>bankruptcy</b> exemptions can be counter-productive. Finally, we argue that entrepreneurial activity is important when studying different <b>bankruptcy</b> rules or regulations.

5|$|Large-scale {{economic}} issues {{played a role}} in the decline of the maritime fur trade and the China trade in general. Before the 19th century, Chinese demand for Western raw materials or manufactured goods was small, but bullion (also known as specie) was accepted, resulting in a general drain of precious metals from the West to China. The situation reversed in the early 19th century for a variety of reasons. Western demand for Chinese goods declined relative to new options (for example, coffee from the West Indies began to replace tea in the United States), while Chinese demand for Western items increased, such as for English manufactures, American cotton goods, and opium which was outlawed but smuggled into China on a large and increasing scale. Before long, China was being drained of specie and saturated with Western goods. At the same time, intense speculation in the China trade by American and British merchant companies began. By the 1820s, too many firms were competing for an overstocked market, resulting in <b>bankruptcies</b> and consolidation. The inevitable commercial crisis struck in 1826–27, after the Panic of 1825. Tea prices plummeted and the China trade's volume collapsed by about a third. By this time, the old maritime fur trade on the Northwest Coast and the Old China Trade itself were dying. The final blow came with the depression of 1841–43, following the Panic of 1837.|$|E
5|$|Philadelphia's major {{industries}} {{of the era}} were the Baldwin Locomotive Works, William Cramp and Sons Ship and Engine Building Company, and the Pennsylvania Railroad. Westward expansion of the Pennsylvania Railroad helped Philadelphia keep up with nearby New York City in domestic commerce, as both cities fought for dominance in transporting iron and coal resources from Pennsylvania. Philadelphia's other local railroad was the Reading Railroad, but {{after a series of}} <b>bankruptcies,</b> it was taken over by New Yorkers. The Panic of 1873, which occurred when the New York City branch of the Philadelphia bank Jay Cooke and Company failed, and another panic in the 1890s hampered Philadelphia's economic growth. While the depressions hurt the city, its diverse array of industries helped it weather difficult times. It had numerous iron and steel-related manufacturers, including Philadelphian-owned iron and steel works outside the city, most notably the Bethlehem Iron Company in the city by that name. The largest industry in Philadelphia was textiles. Philadelphia produced more textiles than any other U.S. city; in 1904 the textile industry employed more than 35 percent of the city's workers. The cigar, sugar, and oil industries also were strong in the city. During this time the major department stores: Wanamaker's, Gimbels, Strawbridge and Clothier, and Lit Brothers, were developed along Market Street.|$|E
