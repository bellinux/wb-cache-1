She said that probably Madonna knew that many in her audience missed the [...] "Madonna of so many Madonnas ago, the one who refused refinement and probably thought Oxford was just an insurance company." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic believed that the documentary served its purpose well. [...] "It will convince anybody {{who is on the}} fence about going out to see the 2006 tour to go ahead and <b>buy</b> <b>those</b> expensive tickets already," [...] he added.|$|E
2500|$|The Wall Street Journal {{commented on}} the {{practical}} impact of this ruling saying that: [...] "Judge Chin's ruling changes little for Google users. About two million books {{that are in the}} public domain, such as works of William Shakespeare, currently can be viewed free on the Google Books site. [...] Google Books users currently can view long previews of another two million books that are in copyright and in print, thanks to agreements between Google {{and tens of thousands of}} publishers that were separate from the legal settlement. Millions more books that are in copyright but out of print are currently available in Google Books in a shorter 'snippet view.' Had the settlement been approved, users would have been able to see longer previews and potentially <b>buy</b> <b>those</b> books." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] she replied, [...] "but it {{has always}} struck me as so strange {{that he should not}} have {{prevented}} Mr. Hartington from <b>buying</b> <b>those</b> shares.

6000|$|... "That {{may have}} been the reason," [...] Cuthbert agreed. [...] "It was one of the points for which Cumming and I, talking it over, could see no motive.

5000|$|Bretz was {{a proponent}} of {{changing}} college baseball's bat rules while at Hartford. In 1996, the Richmond Times-Dispatch quoted him on the minus-5's then in use: [...] "Across the board, {{something needs to be}} done. Somebody is going to get killed of metallic bats. It's going to happen. I guess we'll keep <b>buying</b> <b>those</b> bats until it does." [...] In 1999, the NCAA adopted BESR standards to reduce the exit speed of baseballs off the bat. The NCAA made further reductions in bats' liveliness in the years following these new standards.|$|R

50|$|Energy {{and waste}} in City Life are also {{considered}} {{a kind of}} income. Energy or waste management that the city provides for itself is cheaper than <b>buying</b> <b>those</b> services externally. Any surplus energy can be sold for profit, as can excess waste management. For example, a power station generates 5100 points of energy. If the city uses only 3100 energy, then the remaining 2000 energy will be sold and is counted as monthly profit. Incidentally this makes the power station {{one of the best}} initial industries for a city since it provides work for Blue Collar and profits are much larger than other industrial businesses.|$|R
50|$|One of the more-notable {{areas of}} {{arbitrage}}, called risk arbitrage or merger arbitrage, {{evolved in the}} 1980s. When a company plans to buy another company, often the share price of the buyer falls (because the buyer {{will have to pay}} money to buy the other company) and the share price of the purchased company rises (because the buyer usually <b>buys</b> <b>those</b> shares at a price higher than the current price). When an investment bank believes a buyout is imminent, it often sells short the shares of the buyer (betting that the price will go down) and buys the shares of the company being acquired (betting the price will go up).|$|R

[...] "Frenchmen haven't worn {{things like}} that for thirty years, but the Americans from the Far West <b>buy</b> <b>those</b> clothes and have {{themselves}} photographed the day after they arrive in Paris. That's about as near to art as they ever get. But it doesn't matter to them, they've all got money." ...|$|E
6000|$|A {{spasm of}} pain passed across her face. At that moment her {{thoughts}} were only concerned with his safety. The terrible suggestiveness {{of what he}} had told her had very little real meaning for her then. Her one thought was, could she <b>buy</b> <b>those</b> papers?

6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] exclaimed Florence, [...] "it's a pity it {{has taken}} you so long to learn that truth. I suppose I'm fond of money--at least, I'm fond of the things I used to fancy it could buy, but by degrees I found out that it can't <b>buy</b> <b>those</b> that are really worth the most.

60|$|On February 15 we {{proceeded}} down {{coast to}} inspect the mining-lands of Prince's River valley, east of Axim; {{and this time it}} was resolved to travel by surf-boat, ignoring that lazy rogue the hammock-man. Yet even here difficulties arose. Mast and sail were to be borrowed, and paddles were to be hired at the rate of a shilling a day each.

6000|$|She {{was still}} redder and more uncomfortable a moment after, when a sudden {{turn in the}} {{conversation}} introduced the subject of dress. One of the young ladies asked Jo where she got the pretty drab hat she wore to the picnic and stupid Jo, instead of mentioning {{the place where it}} was bought two years ago, must needs answer with unnecessary frankness, [...] "Oh, Amy painted it. You can't <b>buy</b> <b>those</b> soft shades, so we paint ours any color we like. It's a great comfort to have an artistic sister." ...|$|E
60|$|And now, if {{any people}} should be {{disposed}} to think my history immoral (for I have heard some assert that I {{was a man who}} never deserved that so much prosperity should fall to my share), I will beg those cavillers to do me the favour to read the conclusion of my adventures; when they will see it was no such great prize that I had won, and that wealth, splendour, thirty thousand per annum, and a seat in Parliament, are often purchased at too dear a rate, when one has to <b>buy</b> <b>those</b> enjoyments at the price of personal liberty, and saddled with the charge of a troublesome wife.|$|E
5000|$|Pfaff creates paintings, sculpture, {{prints and}} {{installation}} art. Of {{the creation of}} her work, she says [...] "I’ve always done prints and drawings, always. No one <b>buys</b> <b>those</b> installations, so when you see things that are portable that I’m not attached to, they’re probably two-dimensional. If you get an installation of mine, you inherit assistant Ryan, myself, a crew, the dog, the noise, the dirt. We wreck the house. So if you don’t want that, then you get prints and drawings." [...] Pfaff's work has been describes as [...] "a disaster area almost to the opening day," [...] detailing the lack of coherence between the elements of her work, verging {{on the edge of}} chaos.|$|R
60|$|All {{interchange}} is, {{in substance}} and effect, barter; whoever sells commodities for money, {{and with that}} money buys other goods, really <b>buys</b> <b>those</b> goods with his own commodities. And so of nations: their trade is a mere exchange of exports for imports; and, whether money is employed or not, things are only in their permanent state when the exports and imports exactly pay for each other. When this is the case, equal sums of money are due from each country to the other, the debts are settled by bills, {{and there is no}} balance to be paid in the precious metals. The trade is in a state like that which is called in mechanics a condition of stable equilibrium.|$|R

Amount of used material, ie. mass and dimensions of gear unit influences on gear units price. Mass and dimensions of gear unit, besides output torque, gear unit ratio and efficiency, {{are the most}} important parameters of technical characteristics of gear units and their quality. Centre distance and position of shafts have significant influence on output torque, gear unit ratio and mass of gear unit through overall dimension of gear unit housing. Thus these characteristics are dependent on each other. This paper deals with analyzing of centre distance and shaft position influence on output torque and ratio of universal two stages gear units...|$|R
