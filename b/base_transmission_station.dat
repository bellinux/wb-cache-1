40|$|Abstract — In {{cellular}} systems a large reuse distance reduces cochannel interference while a small reuse distance increases bandwidth {{allocated to}} each cell. The optimal reuse distance is chosen to balance these two factors. Instead of applying a fixed reuse {{distance to the}} entire system, {{in this paper we}} study the effect of adaptive channel reuse based on channel strength. Assuming the traditional single <b>base</b> <b>station</b> <b>transmission,</b> adaptive channel reuse under different propagation models, with or without fading, is analyzed for the Wyner linear cellular model. A new approach where <b>base</b> <b>stations</b> collaborate in <b>transmission</b> is also considered. We observe that adjacent base cooperation does not show much advantage over traditional single <b>base</b> <b>transmission</b> under intracell orthogonal schemes and AWGN channel models. In order to fully exploit the benefit of base station cooperation, more sophisticated transmission schemes need to be investigated. I...|$|R
30|$|The {{joint power}} control and {{scheduling}} problem for unicast transmissions, as presented in [9], {{can be reduced}} to an edge coloring problem, which is NP-hard [18]. Adding in the multicast nature of our problem, which induces further complexity since a single <b>base</b> <b>station</b> <b>transmission</b> has to satisfy the minimum SINR requirement imposed for each one of its multicast clients, implies that the underlying scheduling problem is also NP-hard. We therefore conclude the need for developing heuristic algorithms to provide solution schemes to this adaptive-power scheduling problem that is computationally efficient and scalable, when considering networks that may include a large number of base stations and client nodes.|$|R

We also assume that the base station is located high enough and far from the mobile to ensure 2 D AoAs and to avoid local scattering shadowing. As one example, these conditions are observed in the current GSM and 3 G networks where the base station is usually placed on the building roofs. As in [14, 5, 15, 7], we suppose that the base station antenna-elements are isotropic and that the same mean AoA and AS are seen at all antenna-elements of the base station.|$|R

A further simplification may be introduced, giving a simple iterative waterfilling scheme, at the expense of some performance loss. The performance is illustrated obtaining the achievable rates for different antenna configurations and different kinds of power constraints.

30|$|In LTE systems, {{the usage}} of {{multiple}} antenna systems has been a special focus. In contrast to previous mobile cellular systems, LTE systems have been rolled out from the beginning {{with at least two}} transmit antennas per cell at the base station. In combination with two receive antennas at the UE, this allows to leverage spatial diversity gains by applying MIMO transmission techniques. MIMO (multiple input multiple output) transmission allows the transmission of either multiple information streams (multiple-layer transmission) or a single transmission stream (transmit diversity) by using several transmit antennas at the transmit point and several receive antennas at the point of reception, see also [11]. The main focus has been the DL (<b>base</b> <b>station</b> <b>transmissions</b> towards the mobile user equipment) in the first step, since many applications are asymmetric and require higher data rates on the DL than on the UL.|$|R
40|$|In systems {{employing}} coordinated <b>base</b> <b>station</b> <b>transmission</b> {{and reception}} (also known as network MIMO), information {{needs to be}} shared among clusters of coordinated bases. This information includes coherent channel state information, user data, and baseband received signals. The cost of leasing and maintaining a reliable backhaul to share this information will be the dominant operational expense for cellular systems with network MIMO. In this paper we analyze the bandwidth requirements for sharing information among coordinated bases for network MIMO {{as a function of}} the coordination cluster size and channel characteristics. We find that for moderate Doppler speeds, the channel state information is a negligible fraction of the overall backhaul bandwidth. We also show that sending linearly quantized baseband signals over the backhaul achieves a significant fraction of ideal unquantized sum rate performance for uplink network MIMO based on zero-forcing. 1...|$|R

To reduce <b>transmissions,</b> <b>base</b> <b>stations</b> often maintain caches for erratically changing sensor sources. Stochastic consistency guarantees the cache-source deviation is within a pre-specified bound {{with a certain}} confidence level. We model the erratic sources as Brownian motions, and adaptively predict the next cache update time based on the model. By piggybacking the next update time in each regular data packet, we can dynamically adjust the relaying nodes' duty cycles {{so that they are}} awake before the next update message arrives, and are sleeping otherwise. Through simulations, we show that our approach can achieve very high source-cache fidelity with low power consumption on many real-life sensor data. On average, our approach consumes 4 - 5 times less power than GAF gaf, and achieves 50 % longer network lifetime...|$|R

The architecture considers an adaptive networking framework where the bandwidth of multimedia calls can be dynamically adjusted, and the proposed admission method works by enforcing an upper bound on the cell overload probability. In this paper we consider a similar adaptive framework, and devise call admission control and bandwidth allocation strategies to serve multimedia connections in a CDMA-based 3 G cellular network. The architecture aims at maintaining the session’s quality during both intra-cell and inter-cell user movements by limiting the cell overload probability. A novel aspect of our work is a method for exploiting a priori knowledge of user mobility patterns to estimate the cell overload probability after some prescribed prediction interval. Important properties of the devised method are proved analytically.
