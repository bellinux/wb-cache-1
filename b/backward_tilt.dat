There had been rain and the forest paths were ankle deep in mire. Everywhere, to right and left, soldiers' faces, hard and rough from a year of open air, gazed up at us from their burrows in the ground. Presently an alert, blue-clad figure stood in the path to greet us. It was the Colonel of the sector. He was ridiculously like Cyrano de Bergerac as depicted by the late M. Coquelin, save that his nose was of more moderate proportion. The ruddy colouring, the bristling feline full-ended moustache, the solidity of pose, the <b>backward</b> <b>tilt</b> of the head, the general suggestion of the bantam cock, were all there facing us as he stood amid the leaves in the sunlight. Gauntlets and a long rapier--nothing else was wanting. Something had amused Cyrano. His moustache quivered with suppressed mirth, and his blue eyes were demurely gleaming. Then the joke came out. He had spotted a German working party, his guns had concentrated on it, and afterwards he had seen the stretchers go forward. A grim joke, it may seem. But the French see this war from a different angle to us. If we had the Boche sitting on our heads for two years, and were not yet quite sure whether we could ever get him off again, we should get Cyrano's point of view. Those of us who have had our folk murdered by Zeppelins or tortured in German prisons have probably got it already.|$|E

The efficacy of extra-osseous and intra-osseous devices is evaluated. In this retrospective study, 45 patients treated with an extra-osseous device (EOD) were compared with 43 patients treated with an intra-osseous device (IOD). From a statistical point of view, both patient groups were comparable for age and sex ratio. The IOD group gained more bone height (9. 8 mm) than the EOD group (6. 0 mm). A significantly higher degree of <b>backward</b> <b>tilting</b> of the device was observed in the EOD group (12. 1 degrees), compared with the IOD group (3. 0 degrees). There were also significantly more fractures of the basal bone segment and sensory disturbances of the chin area in the EOD group than in the IOD group. The IOD group scored significantly better on bone height gained, <b>backward</b> <b>tilting</b> of the device, occurrence of fractures, and postoperative sensory disturbances. Despite the fact that the mean preoperative bone height for the IOD group was substantially higher (18. 6 mm) than for the EOD group (11. 9 mm), it may be concluded that for augmentation procedures of the edentulous mandible, the IOD is more favourable...|$|R

They were then beginning very early careers of distinction which have not been wholly divided. Mr. Nicolay could have been about twenty-five, and Mr. Hay nineteen or twenty. No one dreamed as yet of the opportunity opening to them in being so constantly near the man whose life they have written, and with whose fame they have imperishably interwrought their names. I remember the sobered dignity of the one, and the humorous gaiety of the other, and how we had some young men's joking and laughing together, in the anteroom where they received me, with the great soul entering upon its travail beyond the closed door. They asked me if I had ever seen the President, and I said that I had seen him at Columbus, the year before; but I could not say how much I should like to see him again, and thank him for the favor which I had no claim to at his hands, except such as the slight campaign biography I had written could be thought to have given me.

60|$|Before {{reaching}} Knightsbridge, Mr Verloc {{took a turn}} to {{the left}} out of the busy main thoroughfare, uproarious with the traffic of swaying omnibuses and trotting vans, in the almost silent, swift flow of hansoms. Under his hat, worn with a slight <b>backward</b> <b>tilt,</b> his hair had been carefully brushed into respectful sleekness; for his business was with an Embassy. And Mr Verloc, steady like a rock—a soft kind of rock—marched now along a street which could with every propriety be described as private. In its breadth, emptiness, and extent it had the majesty of inorganic nature, of matter that never dies. The only reminder of mortality was a doctor’s brougham arrested in august solitude close to the curbstone. The polished knockers of the doors gleamed {{as far as the eye}} could reach, the clean windows shone with a dark opaque lustre. And all was still. But a milk cart rattled noisily across the distant perspective; a butcher boy, driving with the noble recklessness of a charioteer at Olympic Games, dashed round the corner sitting high above a pair of red wheels. A guilty-looking cat issuing from under the stones ran for a while in front of Mr Verloc, then dived into another basement; and a thick police constable, looking a stranger to every emotion, as if he too were part of inorganic nature, surging apparently out of a lamp-post, took not the slightest notice of Mr Verloc. With a turn to the left Mr Verloc pursued his way along a narrow street by the side of a yellow wall which, for some inscrutable reason, had No. 1 Chesham Square written on it in black letters. Chesham Square was at least sixty yards away, and Mr Verloc, cosmopolitan enough not to be deceived by London’s topographical mysteries, held on steadily, without a sign of surprise or indignation. At last, with business-like persistency, he reached the Square, and made diagonally for the number 10. This belonged to an imposing carriage gate in a high, clean wall between two houses, of which one rationally enough bore the number 9 and the other was numbered 37; but the fact that this last belonged to Porthill Street, a street well known in the neighbourhood, was proclaimed by an inscription placed above the ground-floor windows by whatever highly efficient authority is charged with the duty of keeping track of London’s strayed houses. Why powers are not asked of Parliament (a short act would do) for compelling those edifices to return where they belong is one of the mysteries of municipal administration. Mr Verloc did not trouble his head about it, his mission in life being the protection of the social mechanism, not its perfectionment or even its criticism.|$|E

5000|$|The term {{landslide}} {{refers to}} a variety of mass wasting events (geologic slope failures) that include slumps, slides, falls, and flows. The two major types of slides are rotational slides and translational slides. Rockslides are a type of translational event since the rock mass moves along a roughly planar surface with little rotation or <b>backward</b> <b>tilting.</b> Rock slides are the most dangerous form of mass-wasting because they incorporate a sudden, incredibly fast-paced release of bedrock along a uniform plane of weakness. These uniform weaknesses are key to identifying rock slides because unlike slumps, flows, or falls, the failed material moves in a fairly uniform direction over a layer of solid, pre-existing rock. Rock may break down while falling during rockslides.|$|R

40|$|An {{analysis}} of Euler angle sequences is presented for the scapula. In vivo kinematics were collected with a magnetic tracking device on eight healthy volunteers.

Rotations using all six possible Euler angle sequences were calculated for which each angle was represented only once. The sequence proposed by an International Society of Biomechanics subcommittee on shoulder motion (external rotation, upward rotation, posterior tilting) is consistent with both research- and clinical-based two-dimensional representations of scapular motion.

The wider anterior portion, combined with the narrower and longer posterior portion, allows for a more complete and natural replacement of the lost orbital volume. This shape reduces the risk of superior sulcus deformity and puts more volume within the muscle cone.Muscles can be placed at any location the surgeon desires with these implants. This is advantageous for cases of damaged or lost muscles after trauma, and the remaining muscles are transposed to improve postoperative motility. And in anticipation of future peg placement there is a 6 mm diameter flattened surface, which eliminates the need to shave a flat anterior surface prior to peg placement.|$|E
40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVE: We {{hypothesised}} that backward disequilibrium (BD), {{defined by}} a posterior position of the centre of mass {{with respect to the}} base of support, could be caused by a <b>backward</b> <b>tilt</b> in the perception of verticality. METHODS: The relationship between BD, the perception of verticality, and the history of falls in 25 subjects aged 84. 5 +/- 7. 4 years was analysed. An original ordinal scale, the BD scale (BDS), was used to quantify BD. Postural (PV) and haptic verticals (HV) were measured in sagittal plane. RESULTS: BDS scores closely correlated with the number of falls (r = 0. 81, p = 10 (- 5)). The more the PV was tilted backward, the greater the BDS scores (r = - 0. 95, p< 10 (- 6)), with a huge <b>backward</b> <b>tilt</b> of about 15 degrees in 4 subjects with severe BD. In these subjects, the tilt in perception of verticality was transmodal since a severe backward HV tilt was also found. CONCLUSIONS: This transmodality suggested high-order cognitive disruption {{in the construction of the}} subjective vertical used in postural control by subjects showing BD, which confirmed our hypothesis. SIGNIFICANCE: This study clearly shows that perception and action with respect to gravity are closely related and brings a new insight about fall mechanisms in the elderly...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} (1) the relative contribution of the egocentric reference as well as body orientation perception to visual horizon percept during tilt or during increased gravito-inertial acceleration (GiA, hypergravity environment) conditions and (2) the role of vestibular signals in the inter-individual differences observed in these perceptual modalities. Perceptual estimates analysis showed that <b>backward</b> <b>tilt</b> induced (1) an elevation of the visual horizon, (2) an elevation of the egocentric estimation (visual straight ahead) and (3) an overestimation of body tilt. The increase in the magnitude of GiA induced (1) a lowering of the apparent horizon, (2) a lowering of the straight ahead and (3) a perception of <b>backward</b> <b>tilt.</b> Overall, visual horizon percept can be expressed as the combination of body orientation perception and egocentric estimation. When assessing otolith reactivity using off-vertical axis rotation (OVAR), only visual egocentric estimation was significantly correlated with horizontal OVAR performance. On the one hand, we found a correlation between a low modulation amplitude of the otolith responses and straight ahead accuracy when the head axis was tilted relative to gravity. On the other hand, the bias of otolith responses was significantly correlated with straight ahead accuracy when subjects were submitted to an increase in the GiA. Thus, straight ahead sense would be dependent to some extent to otolith function. These results are discussed in terms of the contribution of otolith inputs in the overall multimodal integration subtending spatial constancy...|$|E

This study presents three examples of failures of limestone cliffs with sub-horizontal bedding in the southwestern calcareous area of China. Field observations and numerical modeling of Yudong Escarpment, Zengzi Cliff, and Wangxia Cliff showed that pre-existing vertical joints passing through thick limestone and the alternation of competent and incompetent layers are the most significant features for rockslides. A "hard on soft" cliff made of hard rocks superimposed of soft rocks is prone to rock slump, characterized by shearing through the underlying weak strata along a curved surface and <b>backward</b> <b>tilting.</b> When a slope contains weak interlayers rather than a soft basal layers, a rock collapse could occur from the compression fracture and tensile split of the rock mass near the interfaces.

40|$|Background and Purpose Because it is {{debatable}} whether seat surface inclination improves motor function {{in children with}} cerebral palsy (CP), the effect of seat surface tilting on postural control and quality of reaching was studied.

Methods During the task of reaching movements, surface electromyographic and kinematic data were recorded for posture and reaching with the dominant arm in 3 sitting conditions: horizontal seat surface, seat surface tilted forward 15 degrees, and seat surface tilted back-ward 15 degrees. Results In the children with unilateral spastic CP, forward tilting improved postural efficiency and quality of reaching. In the children with bilateral spastic CP, both forward and <b>backward</b> <b>tilting</b> of the seat surface was associated with more postural instability and {{did not affect the}} quality of reaching.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} a cognitive aspect upon spatial perception, namely {{the impact of}} a true or false verbal feedback (FB) about the magnitude of body tilt on Subjective Proprioceptive Horizon (SPH) estimates. Subjects were asked to set their extended arm normal to gravity for different pitch body tilts up to 9 degrees. True FB were provided at all body tilt angles, whereas false FB were provided only at 6 degrees backward and 6 degrees forward body tilts for half of the trials. Our data confirmed previous results about the egocentric influence of body tilt itself upon SPH: estimates were linearly lowered with forward tilts and elevated with <b>backward</b> <b>tilts.</b> In addition, results showed a significant effect {{of the nature of the}} external FB provided to the subjects. When subjects received a false FB inducing a 3 degrees forward bias relative to physical body tilt, they set their SPH consequently higher than when they received a false FB inducing a 3 degrees backward bias. These findings clearly indicated that false cognitive information about body tilt might significantly modify the judgement of a geocentric direction of space, such as the SPH. This may have deleterious repercussions in aeronautics when pilots have to localize external objects relative to earth-based directions in darkened environments...|$|R
40|$|For magnetic-bearing-supported {{high-speed}} rotating {{machines with}} significant gyroscopic effects, {{it is necessary}} to stabilize forward and <b>backward</b> <b>tilt</b> whirling modes.

Furthermore, at high shaft speeds, where system phase lags degrade the stability of the forward-whirl mode, a phasor advance of the control signal can partially counteract the phase lag. In some range of high shaft speed, the derivative gain for the tilt modes (essential for stability for slowly rotating shafts) can be removed entirely.

This type of fracture was first described by Jeffery in 1950 in a retrospective review of radial head fractures in children. 1 The suggested mechanism of the fracture-dislocation consists of two stages. First, the radius is dislocated backwards and the epiphysis is separated from the metaphysis by impaction of the capi-tellum.

40|$|An {{analysis}} of the gravitational and inertial forces which act during aircraft flight upon the vestibular systems of the aircraft occupants reveals that {{in the absence of}} a visual horizon, certain illusory sensations are predictable for various acceleration environments. Horizontal forward applied acceleration results in a climbing (<b>backward</b> <b>tilting)</b> sensation; conversely, horizontal rearward applied acceleration results in a diving (forward tilting) sensation. During any attempt to achieve weightlessness in aircraft parabolic flight, special care has to be taken to avoid unintended longitudinal (x -axis) accelerations. Recent flight tests established that the ‘rotation sensation’ (Dzendolet, 1971; Gerathewohl, 1956) during entry into parabolic flight can be attributed to the existence of unintended longitudinal accelerations. However, the ‘inversion illusion’ (Graybiel and Kellogg, 1966) felt by some human subjects at 0 g seems to be different from the rotation sensation and could be caused by the diminished pressure forces of the otoliths on the maculae. The ‘inversion illusion’ of man correlates well with the blind fish diving behavior observed during aircraft parabolic flight (von Baumgarten et al., 1969, 1972). It is suggested that the fish low g diving response and the human inversion illusion are due to the substitution of a predominately shearing force of low magnitude as a vestibular reference in place of a normal, predominately pressure force. This hypothesis indicates that vestibular senses alone cannot provide meaningful postural orientation to simulated or actual gravity of a magnitude below that of Earth's gravity...|$|R

40|$|Full-face masks, worn by skilled {{actors in}} the Noh tradition, can induce a variety of {{perceived}} expressions with changes in head orientation. Out-of-plane rotation of the head changes the two-dimensional image characteristics of the face which viewers may misinterpret as non-rigid changes due to muscle action.
