40|$|Three {{pathogenic}} variants (i. e. pathotypes) {{have been}} described within Xanthomonas citri pv. citri, the causal agent of Asiatic citrus canker. Pathotype A strains naturally infect {{a wide range of}} Citrus species and members of some related genera. In contrast, pathotypes A* and Aw have narrow host ranges within the genus Citrus and have been isolated from Mexican lime (Citrus aurantifolia L.) and from Mexican lime and alemow (Citrus macrophylla L.), respectively. We used amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) based on four partial housekeeping gene sequences (atpD, dnaK, efp and gyrB) for the genotypic classification of Xanthomonas citri pv. citri and the poorly characterized citrus pathogen Xanthomonas campestris pv. <b>bilvae.</b> A Mantel test showed that genetic distances derived from AFLP and MLSA were highly correlated. X. campestris pv. <b>bilvae</b> showed a close relatedness to the type strain of X. citri, indicating that this pathovar should be reclassified as X. citri pv. <b>bilvae.</b> All pathotype A* and Aw strains were most closely related to X. citri pv. citri strains with a wide host range (pathotype A), confirming previous DNA¿DNA hybridization data. Pathotype Aw should be considered a junior synonym of pathotype A* on the basis of pathogenicity tests, AFLP, MLSA and PCR using pathovar-specific primers. Evolutionary genome divergences computed from AFLP data suggested that pathotype A* (including Aw strains) is a group of strains that shows a wider genetic diversity than pathotype A.

40|$|Asiatic {{citrus canker}} disease, caused by Xanthomonas citri pv. citri, seriously impacts citrus {{production}} worldwide. Two pathogenic variants, A and A*/Aw, {{have been described}} within this pathovar. Two additional pathovars of X. citri with a limited geographic distribution and reduced pathogenicity, namely X. citri pvs. aurantifolii and <b>bilvae,</b> are also pathogenic to citrus and some rutaceous species. Rapid and reliable identification is required for these citrus pathogens, which are classified as a quarantine organism in citrus-producing countries. The specificity of nine polymerase chain reaction primers previously designed for the identification of X. citri pv. citri or citrus bacterial canker strains (both pvs. citri and aurantifolii) was assayed on a large strain collection (n = 87), including the two pathotypes of X. citri pv. citri, other genetic related or unrelated pathogenic xanthomonads, and saprophytic xanthomonads. This study gave congruent results with the original articles when testing the same strains or pathovars {{but the use of}} a broad inclusivity and exclusivity panel of strains highlighted new findings. Particularly, primers 2 / 3, 4 / 7, and KingF/R failed to provide amplification for three strains from the pathotype A*/Aw. Moreover, all pairs of primers detected at least one non-target strain. These data were supported by in silico analysis of the DNA sequences available from National Center for Biotechnology Information databases. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

Based on a collection of 55 strains representative of Xci worldwide diversity assessed by amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP), we investigated the distribution of type III effectors (T 3 Es) in relation to host range. We examined the presence of 66 T 3 Es from xanthomonads in Xci and identified a repertoire of 28 effectors, 26 of which were shared by all Xci strains, whereas two (xopAG and xopC 1) were present only in some A*/AW strains. We found that xopAG (=avrGf 1) was present in all AW strains, but also in three A* strains genetically distant from AW, and that all xopAG-containing strains induced the hypersensitive response (HR) on grapefruit and sweet orange.

40|$|Background The {{identification}} of factors {{involved in the}} host range definition and evolution is a pivotal challenge in the goal to predict and prevent the emergence of plant bacterial disease. To trace the evolution and find molecular differences between three pathotypes of Xanthomonas citri pv. citri that may explain their distinctive host ranges, 42 strains of X. citri pv. citri and one outgroup strain, Xanthomonas citri pv. <b>bilvae</b> were sequenced and compared. Results The strains from each pathotype form monophyletic clades, with a short branch shared by the Aw and A pathotypes. Pathotype-specific recombination was detected in seven regions of the alignment. Using Ancestral Character Estimation, 426 SNPs were mapped to the four branches {{at the base of}} the A, A*, Aw and A/Aw clades. Several genes containing pathotype-specific nonsynonymous mutations have functions related to pathogenicity. The A pathotype is enriched for SNP-containing genes involved in defense mechanisms, while A* is significantly depleted for genes that are involved in transcription. The pathotypes differ by four gene islands that largely coincide with regions of recombination and include genes with a role in virulence. Both A* and Aw are missing genes involved in defense mechanisms. In contrast to a recent study, we find that there are an extremely small number of pathotype-specific gene presences and absences. Conclusions The three pathotypes of X. citri pv. citri that differ in their host ranges largely show genomic differences related to recombination, horizontal gene transfer and single nucleotide polymorphism. We detail the phylogenetic relationship of the pathotypes and provide a set of candidate genes involved in pathotype-specific evolutionary events that could explain to the differences in host range and pathogenicity between them.
