500|$|Oswald's {{head was}} interred in Durham Cathedral {{together}} with the remains of Cuthbert of Lindisfarne (a saint with whom Oswald became posthumously associated, although the two were not associated in life; Cuthbert became bishop of Lindisfarne {{more than forty years}} after Oswald's death) and other valuables in a quickly made coffin, where it is generally believed to remain, although there are at least four other claimed heads of Oswald in continental Europe. One of his arms is said to have ended up in Peterborough Abbey later in the Middle Ages. The story is that a small group of monks from Peterborough made their way to Bamburgh where Oswald's uncorrupted arm was kept and stole it under the cover of darkness. They returned with it to Peterborough and in due time a chapel was created for the arm - Oswald's Chapel. This - minus the arm - can be seen to this day in the south transept of the cathedral. When creating this chapel the monks of Peterborough had thought of how they had acquired it and built into the chapel a narrow tower - just <b>big</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> monk to climb to the top by an internal stair and stand guard over Oswald's Arm 24 hours a day, every day of the year. [...] The monk had to stand because the tower is not large enough for him to sit - sitting could lull him to sleep - and they knew what could happen when no-one was watching.|$|E

2500|$|Who, exactly, was {{responsible}} for saving the artwork took many years to determine, and was finally unravelled in the 1980s by Austrian historian Ernst Kubin. The plan was devised by Dr. Emmerich Pöchmüller, the general director of the mine, Eberhard Mayerhoffer, the technical director, and Otto Högler, the mine's foreman. It was sanctioned by Ernst Kaltenbrunner, an SS officer of high rank in the Gestapo {{who had grown up}} in the area, and was later convicted of mass-murder and hanged. [...] The plan was carried out by the miners, with the tacit approval of Eigruber's guards, several of whom had been persuaded by Karl Sieber, an art restorer who had worked on paintings stored in the mine, that destroying the artwork and the mine was not a good idea. The entire operation took three weeks to implement. [...] On 5 May the signal was given, and six tons of explosives with 386 detonators and 502 timing switches were activated, causing 66 blasts which closed off 137 tunnels.

40|$|After placement, each stays {{for some}} random {{time and then}} departs, freeing up the space it was occupying. This is a {{mathematical}} model of a storage unit (the interval [0; 1]) whose size is normalized to 1 and whose discrete structure {{has been replaced by}} a continuous relaxation. The subintervals are files that are stored <b>for</b> random times. <b>A</b> file of length x is placed left-justified, if possible at its time of arrival in the leftmost vacant interval (gap) at least x in length. This is called the First Fit (FF) rule. If there is no gap <b>big</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> arriving file, it is turned away (lost). The question is: For given probability laws describing the arrival and residence times of files, what is the long-run fraction of the arrivals that have to be turned away? (Note: Once a file is placed in storage, it can not be moved prior to departure.) To mount a simulation study, you must first decide on <b>a</b> data structure <b>for</b> representing the state of the storage unit [0; 1], which at any given time consists of an alternating sequence of gaps and strings of adjacent files. There are two operations that the data structure must accommodate efficiently: adding a new file to the state by the FF rule, and removing a randomly chosen file from the state. Design a tree data structure in which both of these operations take O(log N) time on average, where N is the known maximum number of files that will ever be stored.
