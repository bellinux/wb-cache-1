5|$|Around 1947, Hollywood agent Paul Kohner and German filmmaker Ernst Matray also {{planned a}} Caligari sequel; Matray {{and his wife}} Maria Solveg wrote a {{screenplay}} called The Return of Caligari.

5|$|The James Dean biopic began {{development}} at Warner Bros. {{in the early}} 1990s. At one point, Michael Mann was contracted to direct with Leonardo DiCaprio starring in the lead role. After Mann's departure, Des McAnuff, Dennis Hopper and Milčo Mančevski were considered as directors.

5|$|The film {{may have}} been {{inspired}} by the real 1909 strike of the New York City shirtwaist makers, but the strike ended without settlement.

50|$|Dui Duari film music {{directed}} by Moksud Jamil Mintu. And lyrics by these film director Humayun Ahmed. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>films</b> use a song as Lilabali Lilabali collected from Bangladeshi old cultures.|$|R
5000|$|Because of {{the success}} of Edwards' {{previous}} films Breakfast at Tiffany's, The Pink Panther and A Shot in <b>the</b> Dark, <b>the</b> <b>film's</b> budget started out at a generous $6 million. Mirisch Productions initially financed <b>the</b> <b>film</b> for United Artists, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>film's</b> escalating costs led UA to drop <b>the</b> <b>film</b> <b>but</b> <b>the</b> project was picked up by Warners.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>film</b> {{received}} a mixed critical reception. Prem Panicker of Rediff praised Victor Banerjee's acting, <b>but</b> said <b>the</b> <b>film</b> was too cliché and unoriginal. Planet Bollywood also positively reviewed Bannerjee's performance, <b>but</b> criticised <b>the</b> <b>film</b> {{for having a}} [...] "lack of tautness that makes it drag in patches".|$|R
5|$|The film premiered on 25 March 2010 at the London Lesbian and Gay Film Festival {{held in the}} BFI Southbank {{in central}} London.

5|$|Although Batman Returns was a {{financial}} success, Warner Bros. felt the film {{should have made}} more money. The studio decided to change {{the direction of the}} Batman film series to be more mainstream. Joel Schumacher replaced Tim Burton as director, while Burton decided to stay on as producer. However, Michael Keaton did not like the new direction the film series was heading in, and was replaced by Val Kilmer as Batman. Chris O'Donnell was introduced as Robin, Jim Carrey starred as The Riddler, while Tommy Lee Jones starred as Two-Face. Filming started in September 1994, and Schumacher encountered problems communicating with Kilmer and Jones. Batman Forever was released on June 16, 1995 with financial success, earning over $350 million worldwide and three Academy Award nominations, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>film</b> was met with mixed reviews from critics.|$|E
5|$|Development of A.I. {{originally}} {{began with}} producer-director Stanley Kubrick, after he acquired {{the rights to}} Aldiss' story in the early 1970s. Kubrick hired a series of writers until the mid-1990s, including Brian Aldiss, Bob Shaw, Ian Watson, and Sara Maitland. The film languished in protracted development for years, partly because Kubrick felt computer-generated imagery was not advanced enough to create the David character, whom he believed no child actor would convincingly portray. In 1995, Kubrick handed A.I. to Spielberg, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>film</b> did not gain momentum until Kubrick's death in 1999. Spielberg remained close to Watson's film treatment for the screenplay.|$|E

50|$|Michel's death {{scene is}} one of the most iconic scenes in <b>the</b> <b>film,</b> <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>film's</b> final lines of {{dialogue}} are the source of some confusion for English-speaking audiences. In some translations, it is unclear whether Michel is condemning Patricia, or alternatively condemning the world in general.|$|R
50|$|Mane 'n Tail is {{featured}} prominently in <b>the</b> <b>film,</b> <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>film's</b> end titles disclose {{that they did}} not pay for the promotion. Instead, Mane 'n Tail provided free products {{to be used in the}} production of <b>the</b> <b>film.</b> Many other brands only provided products or contributed to the promotion of the movie.|$|R
5|$|In the 1990s, McClory {{announced}} plans to make another adaptation of the Thunderball story starring Timothy Dalton entitled Warhead 2000 AD, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>film</b> was eventually scrapped. In 1997 Sony Pictures acquired McClory's rights for an undisclosed amount, and subsequently announced that it intended to make a series of Bond films, as the company also held the rights to Casino Royale. This move prompted a round of litigation from MGM, which was settled out-of-court, forcing Sony to give up all claims on Bond; McClory still claimed he would proceed with another Bond film, and continued his case against MGM and Danjaq; On 27 August 2001 the court rejected McClory's suit. McClory died in 2006.|$|E
5|$|Kurosawa's next film, for Shochiku, was The Idiot, an {{adaptation}} of the novel by the director's favorite writer, Fyodor Dostoyevsky. The filmmaker relocated the story from Russia to Hokkaido, but it is otherwise very faithful to the original, a fact seen by many critics as detrimental to the work. A studio-mandated edit shortened it from Kurosawa's original cut of 265 minutes (nearly four-and-a-half hours) to just 166 minutes, making the resulting narrative exceedingly difficult to follow. It is widely considered today {{to be one of}} the director's least successful works. Contemporary reviews were very negative, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>film</b> was a moderate success at the box office, largely because of the popularity of one of its stars, Setsuko Hara.|$|E
5|$|Moore did {{not make}} any screen {{appearances}} in 2003, but returned in 2004 with three films. There was no success in her first two ventures of the year: Marie and Bruce, a dark comedy co-starring Matthew Broderick, {{did not get a}} cinematic release; Laws of Attraction followed, where she played opposite Pierce Brosnan in a courtroom-based romantic comedy, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>film</b> was panned by critics. Commercial success returned to Moore with The Forgotten, a psychological thriller in which she played a mother who is told her dead son never existed. Although the film was unpopular with critics, it opened as the US box office number one.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>film</b> {{was first}} {{announced}} in 2009 {{and was released}} in North America on August 3, 2012, grossing over $198 million worldwide. <b>The</b> <b>film</b> received generally mixed reviews from critics. It received praise for its action sequences and acting <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>film's</b> lack of humor, emotional subtlety, and character development drew some criticism.|$|R
50|$|In 2016 Peterhead Prison saw gunmen on {{the roof}} tops again - not this time an SAS raid <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>filming</b> of a Zombie action Movie called REDCON-1 which was due to be {{released}} in early 2017.|$|R
25|$|Its greatness is blunted by {{its length}} and one-sided point of view, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>film's</b> {{weaknesses}} are overpowered by Michael Cimino's sympathetic direction {{and a series}} of heartbreaking performances from Robert De Niro, Meryl Streep, and Christopher Walken.|$|R
5|$|Saw {{was first}} {{screened}} on January 19, 2004. Lionsgate {{picked up the}} rights and released the film in the United States and Canada on October 29, 2004. Critical responses were generally mixed and divided, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>film</b> gained a cult following. Compared to its low budget, Saw performed very well at the box office, grossing more than $100 million worldwide and becoming, at the time, {{one of the most}} profitable horror films since 1996's Scream. The success of the film prompted a green-light of a sequel soon after Saw opening weekend, which was released the following October.|$|E
5|$|Steve Jobs premiered at the 2015 Telluride Film Festival on September 5, 2015, {{and began}} a limited release in New York City and Los Angeles on October 9, 2015.

Individuals close to Jobs such as Steve Wozniak and John Sculley would praise the film's performances, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>film</b> also received criticisms for its inaccuracy in some of its scenes. Winslet won a Golden Globe and a BAFTA Award for Best Supporting Actress and Sorkin won the Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay at the 73rd Golden Globes, while Fassbender and Winslet received nominations for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actress, respectively, at the 88th Academy Awards.|$|E
