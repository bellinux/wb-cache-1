5|$|A privately {{organised}} British team, {{which later}} became the British and Irish Lions, toured New Zealand in 1888. No test matches were played, and the side only played provincial sides. The British players were drawn mainly from Northern England, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> representatives from Wales and Scotland.|$|E
5|$|By 1945, {{due to a}} {{shrinking}} number of operational units and stepped up production, equipment shortages were {{a thing of the}} past. Indeed, the Army had more equipment that it actually needed. For example, a total of 368 25pounders were required for combat and 38 for training <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> a total of 1,516 on hand. Additionally, a total of 530 2pounder and 6pounder anti-tank guns were required, but the Army had 1,941, while 68 3.7inch anti-aircraft guns were needed for combat and five for training, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> 640 pieces available. Similar surpluses existed with small arms such as the Bren, of which 9,438 were required, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> 21,139 in the system. The situation in relation to Bren gun carriers was even more marked with only 123 of the 3,767 vehicles actually being required, due to the decreased requirements for mobility vehicles in jungle warfare.|$|E
5|$|In all, Cyprien {{destroyed}} 841homes in {{the towns}} of Morombe and Morondava. Damage {{in the towns}} was estimated at $180,000, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> no deaths.|$|E

60|$|For as to {{this world}} in which we live, so to the God who created that world, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a terrible aspect. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> calm: <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> storm also. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> {{fertilizing}} sunshine: <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> also the destroying thunderbolt. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> the solid and fruitful earth, where man can till and build; <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> the earthquake and the flood likewise, which destroy in a moment the works of man. So <b>there</b> <b>is</b> in God boundless love, and boundless mercy: <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>is,</b> too, a wrath of God, and a fire of God which burns eternally against all evil and falsehood. And woe to those who fall under that wrath; who are even scorched for a moment by that fire.|$|R
5|$|On September 29, Washington {{moved the}} army closer to Yorktown and British gunners {{opened fire on}} the infantry. Throughout the day several British cannon fired on the Americans <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> few casualties. Fire was also {{exchanged}} between American riflemen and Hessian JÃ¤gers.|$|E
5|$|Overall, cavalry {{represented}} about 20% (including {{the small}} contingents of legionary cavalry) {{of the total}} army effectives. <b>But</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> variations: in Mauretania the cavalry proportion was 28%.|$|E
5|$|Records of {{tropical}} cyclones in the East Pacific before 1950 are sparse, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> still several storms that produced rainfall over Arizona in this period.|$|E
60|$|When {{we came to}} the Canal Engineer's Rest House the Major {{called for}} The Boy's servant; <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no answer. Then we went up to the house, calling for The Boy by name; <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no answer.|$|R

5|$|The {{consequences}} of the Chicxulub impact were of global extent. Some of these phenomena were brief occurrences that immediately followed the impact, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> also long-term geochemical and climatic disruptions that were catastrophic to the ecology.|$|E
5|$|The typhoon also {{affected}} the Russian Far East. On Sakhalin island, Rusa's remnants dropped heavy rainfall, the equivalence of two months average precipitation. The rains flooded 350houses, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> no {{deaths in the}} region.|$|E
5|$|A design {{competition}} {{was announced in}} July 1911, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> not many contenders. The Naval Ministry favored the design from the Russud Works and gave preliminary orders for three ships on 2 September, even before the competition was concluded in November. Russud's design was unsurprisingly selected and the government transferred designers from the government-owned Baltic Works {{as well as a}} complete set of drawings for the Gangut-class to speed up the detailed design process.|$|E

50|$|Nearly all {{the homes}} and {{buildings}} are constructed on piles driven into the lake bed. Residents travel around by canoe, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> also numerous bamboo walkways and bridges over the canals running throughout. As such, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no main street or square, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> pagoda complexes and monasteries on built-up areas.|$|R
5|$|After Betsy, {{two other}} hurricanes {{came close to}} being seeded. Hurricane Faith was {{considered}} a likely candidate, but it stayed {{out of range of}} the seeding planes. That same year, recon flights were conducted into Hurricane Inez, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> no seedings. Both the 1967 and 1968 seasons were inactive. Because of that, there were no suitable seeding targets in either of those two seasons.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the most}} {{damaging}} tornado of the outbreak sequence occurred in Greensburg on the 4th, twenty-five tornadoes were confirmed that day. That number exploded to 84 the following day (May 5th), with many tornadoes near the affected area from the previous night. Most were in open country, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> injuries {{in at least two}} spots in Kansas, and one death reported near a county lake in Ottawa County. 14 more tornadoes were confirmed on May 6th in the region before the outbreak finally ended.|$|E
5|$|As {{it became}} {{apparent}} that, not only were conditions in the ghettos terrible (hunger, diseases, etc.), but that the Jews were being singled out for extermination at Nazi concentration camps, they increasingly tried to escape and hide {{in order to survive}} the war. Many Polish Gentiles concealed hundreds of thousands of their Jewish neighbors. Many of these efforts arose spontaneously from individual initiatives, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> also organized networks dedicated to aiding the Jews.|$|E
50|$|<b>There</b> <b>are</b> no interstate Highways in the Florida Heartland.

5|$|At Gosport, five {{aircraft}} {{were lost}} and five damaged. Several buildings were wrecked and two hangars damaged. <b>But</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> no casualties. The Ju 87 attack had been accurate, and no bombs fell outside the military compounds. In the Gosport area, 10 barrage balloons {{were shot down}} and two damaged.|$|E
5|$|DAN later {{proposed}} a simpler 24-hour wait after {{any and all}} recreational diving, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> objections {{on the grounds that}} such a long delay would result in lost business for island diving resorts and the risks of DCS when flying after diving were too low to warrant this blanket restraint.|$|E
5|$|Drifting {{near the}} northeastern Caribbean for several days, Otto and its {{precursor}} disturbance brought prolonged rainfall to the Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico, triggering widespread flooding and numerous mudslides. Damage from the stormin particular to roads, property and infrastructureexceeded $22 million (2010 USD), <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> no fatalities. After recurving toward the northeast, Otto proceeded {{across the open}} Atlantic without affecting any other landmasses.|$|E

5|$|England {{started their}} second innings with {{a deficit of}} 337 runs and reached 1/54 by the {{premature}} {{end of the second}} day due to bad light. The following morning, they made slow and steady progress as Johnston bowled his finger spin from around the wicket with a well-protected off side. The four men in the off side ring had much work to do as Hutton hit the ball there repeatedly. The English batsmen progressed and Johnston had one confident appeal for lbw against Compton, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> few scares.|$|E
5|$|In 1936 the Belgian, Romain Maes, {{appeared}} to win but judges declared Frenchman Georges Speicher the winner and Maes second.

A Belgian may not have won <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> seven Belgians in the first ten.|$|E
5|$|In 1976, the BWB decided after {{a meeting}} with local councils that the Forth and Clyde Canal, {{fragmented}} by various developments, was to have its remaining navigability preserved by building new bridges with sufficient headroom for boats and continuing to maintain the existing locks. Restoration of sea-to-sea navigation was deemed too expensive at the time, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> to be no further restrictions on its use. A 1979 survey report documented 69 obstructions to navigation, and sought the opinions of twenty interested parties to present the Forth and Clyde Local (Subject) Plan in 1980.|$|E
