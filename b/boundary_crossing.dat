Inside it, the AT roughly parallels its northern <b>boundary,</b> <b>crossing</b> back outside it after [...] The trail proceeds northward through the Housatonic River valley and hills to its west, veering northwesterly and, at Salisbury, ascending the southern Taconic mountains, at Lion's Head affording a view northeasterly towards Mt. Greylock and other points in Massachusetts, and at Bear Mountain, reaching over [...] in elevation {{for the first time}} since Pennsylvania and yielding views across the Hudson River valley to the Catskills and across the broad expanse of the Housatonic valley and the Berkshire and Litchfield Hills to the east. Just north of Bear, the trail, as it crosses into Massachusetts, descends into Sages Ravine, a deep gorge in the eastern Taconic ridgeline which is home to a fragile old growth forest. As the trail crosses the brook in the ravine, it leaves the area maintained by the Connecticut section of the Appalachian Mountain Club.|$|E
500|$|US-89 enters Utah {{from the}} south inside the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area, about 7 miles (11km) north of the Glen Canyon Dam, where it crosses the Colorado River near Page, Arizona. After leaving the {{recreation}} area and passing {{the small town of}} Big Water, the highway curves west through the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument. US-89 stays near the monument's southern <b>boundary,</b> <b>crossing</b> the East Clark Bench and The Cockscomb and passing south of the Vermilion Cliffs of the Grand Staircase. At the city of Kanab, US-89 meets the north end of US-89A, an alternate route south into Arizona, and abruptly turns north and begins climbing the staircase. Here the Mount Carmel Scenic Byway begins; one of the Utah Scenic Byways, it stretches north to SR-12 at Bryce Canyon Junction. The Vermilion Cliffs are ascended via the canyon carved by Kanab Creek. Near the White Cliffs, US-89 meets SR-9 at Mt. Carmel Junction, where travelers can turn to reach Zion National Park. The final [...] "step" [...] is the Pink Cliffs, where the highway follows alongside the Virgin River to the highest point on US-89 in southern Utah and the east end of SR-14, a summit at Long Valley Junction (elevation 7450 feet/2300 m).|$|E
