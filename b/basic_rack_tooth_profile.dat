40|$|Purpose: The paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the influence of design features of the flexspline in a harmonic drive, such as the relative radial deformation, the relative coating thickness and the design features of the <b>basic</b> <b>rack</b> <b>tooth</b> <b>profile,</b> on stress values in the bottom lands of a toothed ring. Design/methodology/approach: In numerical calculations, the software developed at the Faculty of Transport of the Silesian University of Technology was used. The program automatically generates a profile of the flexspline and a boundary elements mesh {{on the grounds of the}} flexspline and working tool assigned parameters. In the analysis of the state of stress, the boundary element method (BEM) was applied. Findings: A decreased value of the curve radius of the head of the <b>basic</b> <b>rack</b> <b>tooth</b> <b>profile</b> results in a change in the width of the tooth bottom land, shortening of the transition curve in the tooth base and a reduction of the tooth thickness at its base, which in turn leads to increased values of stress. Yet, the influence of the relative curve radius of the head of the <b>basic</b> <b>rack</b> <b>tooth</b> <b>profile</b> on the stress value is insignificant. The increase of the torque and relative coating thickness for different value of the curve radius of the head of the <b>basic</b> <b>rack</b> <b>tooth</b> <b>profile</b> cause an increase of stress in the bottom lands of the toothed ring. Research limitations/implications: The paper presents strength calculations for the teeth in toothed ring of a flexspline of a double harmonic drive by means of boundary elements method (BEM). The results of numerical calculations correspond in terms of their quality to the results presented in the literature, which were calculated by finite element method (FEM). Originality/value: In the analysis of the state of stress of toothed ring of flexspline, the boundary element method (BEM) was applied...|$|E

40|$|Abstract − A {{counter gear}} transmits the {{rotation}} angle, so the angular velocity {{ratio of the}} gear does not nec-essarily need to be constant in the meshing process. As a pinion has {{a small number of}} teeth when combined with an internal gear for counters, tooth interference can occur with the use of an involute curve. This paper introduces circular arcs that represent a <b>tooth</b> <b>profile</b> and fillet for the profile design of a pinion through the combination of arcs with lines. The straight line of a <b>rack</b> <b>tooth</b> represents the <b>profile</b> of a mating inter-nal gear. Thus, the circular arc and line maintain contact during the rotation of the counter gear. This paper presents an analysis of the meshing of the circular arc <b>tooth</b> and <b>rack</b> <b>tooth</b> along with the properties of the counter gear, such as the change in rotational velocity and amount of backlash. The contact ratio of the counter gear is 1 because the tooth contact occurs between circular arcs and line. The initial position of tooth contact, which denotes the simultaneous contact of two teeth, is found. As the rotation of the pinion, only one tooth keeps the contact situation. This meshing property is analyzed by the geometrical constraints of the <b>tooth</b> <b>profile</b> in contact and the results are presented as graphical diagrams in which tooth-arc move-ments are superimposed...|$|R

40|$|After an {{extensive}} {{research on the}} fundamental theory, the theoretical basis for the Logix gearing will be presented in this paper. This includes the theory for gear meshing with high degree of contact. In comparison to previous studies, the theory {{of this paper is}} more restricted going beyond third order parameters into the fourth order, the <b>teeth</b> <b>profile</b> had one order of contact higher than that of the Logix gearing. So that further improved the contact strength of <b>tooth</b> <b>profile.</b> A large category of gearings with high order of contact was presented, while the Logix gear is only one of them, or the special example in realization of my theory. In the Logix gearing, the zigzag curvature center curve of media rack does not always lay about the pitch line and does not extend along the pitch line continuously and steadily. It goes forward and returns. So that, in terms of properties of the transverse engagement, the Logix gearing has not much improvement over the traditional Novikov gearing (in which the transverse engagement is temporally). In my gearing the curvature center of <b>basic</b> <b>rack</b> extend along the pitch line continuously and steadily. The transverse engagement factor is larger than that of Logix gearing...|$|R

This paper proposes {{a new form}} of line gear with a couple of concave convex arc <b>tooth</b> <b>profiles.</b> It has four characteristics. First, contact curve of the driving line gear is a cylindrical spiral curve. Second, two axes of a pair of line gears are located in the same plane with an arbitrary angle.

50|$|As {{mentioned}} {{near the}} beginning of the article, the attainment of a nonfluctuating velocity ratio is dependent on the profile of the teeth.Friction and wear between two gears is also dependent on the <b>tooth</b> <b>profile.</b> There are a great many <b>tooth</b> <b>profiles</b> that provides a constant velocity ratio. In many cases, given an arbitrary tooth shape, it is possible to develop a <b>tooth</b> <b>profile</b> for the mating gear that provides a constant velocity ratio. However, two constant velocity <b>tooth</b> <b>profiles</b> are the most commonly used in modern times: the cycloid and the involute. The cycloid was more common until the late 1800s. Since then, the involute has largely superseded it, particularly in drive train applications. The cycloid is in some ways the more interesting and flexible shape; however the involute has two advantages: it is easier to manufacture, and it permits the center-to-center spacing of the gears to vary over some range without ruining the constancy of the velocity ratio. Cycloidal gears only work properly if the center spacing is exactly right. Cycloidal gears are still used in mechanical clocks.|$|R
