40|$|Traditional payment {{methods in}} the {{construction}} industry create risk of payment delays and losses. The issue has been persistent since the early 1960 ’s, with constructions parties suffering dire consequences. Many legislative & contractual, and administrative solutions are in use but these measures have not adequately addressed the payment losses experienced by lower tier parties due to the insolvency of upper tiers, especially losses to contractors due to client insolvency. This paper reviews some of the solutions {{that could be used to}} protect against client insolvency. It is revealed that legal provisions in security of payment Acts cater for losses due to deferred payments but not for insolvency payment losses. Acts provide adjudication for non-payment which is not effective in cases of insolvency when a company goes into liquidation because claimants may not be able to recover monies due. Some of the Acts have abolished contingent payment provisions’ while some have counter clauses with similar objectives. However as a contractual solution, the conditions of contract in New Zealand (NZS 3910 : 2003) enables contractors to obtain payment bonds from clients as security. If a client fails to provide the <b>bond,</b> <b>contractors</b> could terminate the contract at inception. Other security mechanisms such as Buildsafe security scheme and direct payments are in practice; while potential solutions like bonds and guarantees, payment default or insolvency insurance; registration and prequalification of upper tiers; are in consideration. Further study is needed to assess these solutions in terms of their costs and benefits as viable solution(s) to payment losses...|$|R

50|$|With the {{authorization}} of the Shoshone Project in 1904, Buffalo Bill Dam {{became one of}} the earliest projects of the new Bureau of Reclamation. The ambitious project involved the construction of one of the first high concrete dams in the United States. Work began immediately, with drilling for geologic investigation starting in July 1904 and continuing for ten months. Work proceeded concurrently on the construction of an access road up the narrow canyon from Cody. The chosen contractor, Prendergast & Clarkson of Chicago, started work in September 1905, building a camp for workers and starting on a diversion dam, which was to divert the river into a wooden flume, through a tunnel and out through another flume to rejoin the river bed. Two men were killed {{in the construction of the}} tunnel. A June 1906 flood destroyed the flume. The delay caused the Bureau of Reclamation to suspend the contractor's contract and to call upon the <b>contractor's</b> <b>bonding</b> company, the U.S. Fidelity and Guaranty Company, to ensure the completion of the work. Little work was done until March 1907. Another flood in July damaged the diversion dam again. Working conditions were harsh, leading to the first strike in Wyoming's history in November, in which workers demanded and received three dollars a day from USF&G.|$|R

A case study was made of a Danish competence agencyand of the contractors within its network. The qualitative part of the studyincluded interviews with five contractors and a questionnaire directed to theorganization. From the conclusions of the qualitative study and relevant theories,a set of hypotheses were formulated. The quantitative part consisted of a surveythat was sent out to the contractors in the network. The survey aimed to test thehypotheses and the results from the survey were analysed in Excel. The conclusions that were drawn from the outcome of the quantitative studywere that contractors join agencies because of the access to big companies thatare granted by agencies, because they do not have time to promote themselvesso they need someone to do it for them and because of the possibility to createnetworks and that contractors join more than one agency because they do notbelieve that one agency alone can supply them with full time occupation. Further on, it was also concluded that certain HRM as well as SHRM activitieshad a positive impact on the relationship, and that employer brandingstrengthened the <b>bonds</b> between the <b>contractors</b> and the competence agency...|$|R
