It prompted a large crowd to erect roadblocks and Kosovan police units came under fire. An Albanian policeman died when his unit was ambushed and another officer was reportedly injured. Nato-led peacekeepers moved into the area to calm the situation and Kosovan police pulled back. The US and EU criticised the Kosovan government for acting without consulting international bodies. Though tensions {{between the two sides}} eased somewhat after the intervention of NATO's KFOR forces, they continued to remain high.|$|R

50|$|The {{other place}} where the it has been battles during the Winter War was on the Änänkäinen and Puuruu lake areas. In the very first war day the Soviet troops tried to capture the Kiviranta <b>border</b> <b>control</b> <b>post</b> just after the 7 o'clock in the morning, but the {{prepared}} and reinforced Finnish border troops succeeded in slower {{the speed of the}} attacking forces and only by the evening the Finnish border troops had withdrawn to Äninkäinen position, where the positions of the 13th separate battalion were. The Finnish counter-attack took place the next day, 1 December 1939. The 13th separate battalion was assisted by the 12th separate battalion, which had come to he place. Both the battalions attacked until the Soviet troops stopped them on the crossroad of Hattuselkonen. Then 12th separate battalion occupied the Änänkäinen position, while the 13th battalion was withdrawing driven by the Soviet troops to the Nurmijärvi of Lieksa. The Laklajoki position was missed almost without the fight. The delay action actually started only 2 December. The Soviet troops started harassing artillery fire 3 December and continued to do so for five days. In the first days of December also in Kuhmo the Sivakka road-crossing was lost in Kuhmo, which made it possible for the Soviet troops to go the Nurmijärvi of Lieksa to {{the back side of the}} Aninkäinen defenders.|$|E

50|$|Negotiations {{with the}} Belgian colonial {{authorities}} produced an agreement for Northern Rhodesia {{to build and}} maintain a 70-km graded laterite road from Mokambo (16 km from the Copperbelt town of Mufulira) to Chembe. Although only used by Northern Rhodesia and with no Congolese settlements except Mokambo on its route, it had <b>border</b> <b>control</b> <b>posts</b> at both ends and traffic drove on the right. By the 1950s the Chembe Ferry had two motorised pontoons {{able to take the}} largest trucks, the border posts worked smoothly and the 174-km drive from Mufulira to Mansa could be completed in four or five hours. By comparison the same journey keeping to roads within the country was 1166 km and took at least two days, going via Kapiri Mposhi, Mpika, Kasama and Luwingu.|$|R
50|$|The {{primary unit}} of the Constabulary, the troop, was {{organized}} on {{the pattern of the}} mechanized cavalry troop used in the war. In view of its tasks of road and border patrolling and its police-type jobs, the Constabulary needed a greater number of hand weapons and light vehicles, such as jeeps and armored cars. Each troop was divided for patrolling purposes into sections or teams, each of which was equipped with three jeeps and one armored car serving as a command vehicle and as support in case of emergency. A mobile reserve of one company equipped with light tanks was established in each Constabulary regiment. Horses were provided for patrolling in difficult terrain along the borders and motorcycles for the control of traffic on the super-highways (Autobahnen). Static <b>border</b> <b>control</b> <b>posts</b> were established at the crossing points.|$|R
50|$|The seventh round was {{scheduled}} for 28 September 2011 (it was initially scheduled for 27 September, but was postponed shortly before due to a flare-up in violence).

50|$|Throughout 1999, the Kyrgyzstani {{government}} did not physically attempt to contest the new <b>border</b> and concomitant <b>control</b> <b>posts</b> that Uzbekistan established. Rather, Kyrgyzstan sought to keep the border open to trade, while insisting on entering into talks to delimit the border. However, Uzbekistan quickly clamped down on crossings {{that it did not}} authorize. The unilateral restrictions massively obstructed the movement of both goods and people. Nevertheless, IMU extremists found ways to operate over the border throughout 1999. Uzbek troops and border guards began excursions into Kyrgyzstan to suppress the extremists. Although Kyrgyz authorities condemned the territorial violations, Uzbekistan continued them and stepped up its threats by mining the border and constructing barriers and watchtowers, sometimes deep within Kyrgyz territory. Uzbek forces entrenched themselves on this territory and refused to leave.|$|R
50|$|In 1943 more United States <b>Border</b> <b>Control</b> Officers were <b>posted</b> along Mexico's {{northern}} border. Pressure from well-connected Mexican {{land and}} farm owners {{frustrated with the}} bracero program prompted the Mexican government to call a meeting in Mexico City with four agencies of the United States government: the Department of Justice, the Department of State, the INS, and the Border Patrol. This meeting resulted in increased border patrol along the United States-Mexico border by the United States, yet illegal immigration persisted. One of the main issues was that increased pressure by the Mexican government produced more deportations, but the deported Mexicans rapidly reentered the United States. To combat this, the Mexican and American governments developed a strategy in 1945 to deport Mexicans deeper into Mexican territory by a system of planes, boats, and trains. However, in 1954, negotiations surrounding the bracero program broke down, prompting the Mexican government to send 5000 troops to its border with the United States. As a result, President Dwight D. Eisenhower appointed Gen. Joseph Swing as INS Commissioner and charged him with resolving <b>border</b> <b>control</b> issues in order to stabilize labor negotiations with Mexico.|$|R
50|$|The Hong Kong government's {{proposed}} implemention of {{this understanding}} would allow mainland Chinese {{law enforcement to}} operate throughout this extended border zone, {{and not just a}} <b>border</b> or immigration <b>control</b> <b>post,</b> including to use weapons. This proposal has been controversial in Hong Kong, as it is seen to be in effect creating extraterritorial jurisdiction for mainland Chinese law enforcement and judiciary. Opposition politicians and some legal commentators are concerned that the arrangement violates the principle enshrined in the Basic Law that general mainland law does not apply in Hong Kong, and that if implemented it would set a dangerous precedent for more parts of Hong Kong to be declared to be under mainland jurisdiction, but defenders of the proposal say that it is consistent with Article 20 of the Basic Law, which permits the central government to empower the Hong Kong government to do that which it is not otherwise permitted to do under the Basic Law. An application for judicial review of the Hong Kong government's decision is in progress.|$|R

40|$|The {{question}} {{raised in}} the article is how the new provisions of the Lisbon Treaty and the Stockholm programme concerning the EU’s asylum and migration policy might consolidate existing trends within the European <b>border</b> <b>control</b> regime. The regime is defined {{by a combination of}} three features: (i) a harmonisation of categories among the EU/Schengen member states, (ii) a growing use of new technology in networked databases and (iii) an increasing sorting of individuals based on security concerns. Although none of these features is new, the combination gives a new impetus to the European <b>border</b> <b>control</b> regime. The article concludes that the Lisbon Treaty and the Stockholm programme consolidate and strengthen existing trends. This implies that policies on <b>border</b> <b>control,</b> asylum, immigration, judicial cooperation and police cooperation are consolidated in a broader approach to <b>border</b> <b>control,</b> {{and that there is a}} strengthening of EU foreign policy within the European <b>border</b> <b>control</b> regime. The boundaries between previously dispersed policy areas are blurred.

40|$|MM - P&DMThis {{research}} report examines institutional change in South Africa, with {{particular attention to}} the vexed issue of <b>border</b> management. <b>Border</b> <b>control</b> in South Africa is the responsibility of a range of government departments and agencies with unique and often overlapping mandates. The status of lead agency in <b>border</b> <b>control</b> has vacillated between main <b>border</b> <b>control</b> agencies over the years. Leadership has been handed from the South African Police Service to the Department of Home Affairs and, in February 2007, to the South African Revenue Service. The lead agent has always been at the mercy of voluntary cooperation from the other departments and agencies responsible for <b>border</b> <b>control.</b> It does not have statutory powers to enforce cooperation, resulting in individual <b>border</b> <b>control</b> departments and agencies retreating to narrow mandates to avoid “interference” from “outside”. Due to strong principal-agent relationships among political and bureaucratic elites {{as a result of the}} ruling party’s cadre deployment strategy, very little real change has been achieved during the last sixteen years. The current stalemate will only be broken through strong leadership at the top. A scan of the various models for integrated <b>border</b> <b>control</b> shows a great diversity in approaches. Consistent with all transformation of border management, is the attempt to make a clean break with the inefficiency and ineffectiveness of a proliferation of agencies or departments responsible for <b>border</b> <b>control.</b> Government must decide on the type of model it intends to follow to transform <b>border</b> <b>control.</b> Critically, a change in legislation to enable the required institutional change might very well be the first step out of this impass...|$|R

50|$|<b>Border</b> <b>control</b> was an {{important}} element in the security of the United States Zone. On 1 July 1946, the Constabulary replaced the troopers of the 1st, 3d, and 9th Infantry Divisions at the many static <b>control</b> <b>posts</b> along the <b>borders.</b> At these border posts, often in isolated locations, Allied soldiers met and exchanged greetings across the red and white barricades as they performed their duties of customs inspection, passport control, and law enforcement. During the second half of 1946, 120 border posts employing 2,800 Constabulary troopers turned back from the border over 26,000 undocumented transients. An additional 22,000 illegal crossers were apprehended by patrols within the ten-mile (16 km) border zone and turned over to military government. As the patrols of the Constabulary increased, illegal crossings showed a downward trend because travelers became aware of the regulations and the effectiveness of the Constabulary in their enforcement.|$|R
