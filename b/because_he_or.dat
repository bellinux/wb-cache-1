5|$|A Non-constituency Member of Parliament ("NCMP") is a {{candidate}} of an opposition political party who, despite having lost in a general election, is declared elected as a Member of the Parliament of Singapore ("MP") by virtue of provisions in the Constitution and the Parliamentary Elections Act enabling the unsuccessful candidates who have performed the best to be accorded the status. The MP is so called <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> she does not represent any constituency (or electoral division) in Parliament.|$|E
5|$|The {{applicant}} for {{an election}} {{to be avoided}} may ask for a declaration that the election is void, that a particular candidate was wrongfully declared to have been elected, and/or that another candidate was duly elected. The applicant may also request for a scrutiny– that is, a re-examination of the ballot papers– {{if he or she}} alleges that an unsuccessful candidate had a majority of lawful votes. When a scrutiny is conducted, the election judge may order a vote to be struck off if the voter was not on the register of electors assigned to the polling station at which the vote was recorded or was not authorized to vote at the station; if the vote was obtained by bribery, treating or undue influence; if the voter committed or induced someone to commit the offence of personation; and if the vote was for a disqualified candidate and the disqualification was either a matter that the voter was aware of or was sufficiently publicized or widely known. During a scrutiny, a tendered vote that is shown to be valid will be added to the poll if any party to the proceedings asks for the vote to be added. On the other hand, a registered elector's vote will not be struck off at a scrutiny just <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> she was not qualified to be on the electoral register, and the returning officer's decision {{as to whether or not}} a ballot paper should be rejected may not be questioned.|$|E

"Our {{newspapers}} do {{not represent}} public interests, but private interests; they {{do not represent}} humanity, but property; they value a man, not <b>because</b> <b>he</b> is great, <b>or</b> good, or wise, <b>or</b> useful, but <b>because</b> <b>he</b> is wealthy, <b>or</b> of service to vested wealth."

25|$|Ontological hermeneutics {{affirms that}} human beings exist in a world around them and that through {{background}} a priori (before experience) foreknowledge, they constantly seek to understand themselves and that world, including other humans and inanimate objects. Heidegger termed human beings as Dasein, the German word for being-there. In other words, an individual is termed Dasein <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> she exists there, being there at some place in the present. Put in more simple terms, an individual is Dasein <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> she literally exists. Heidegger, along with Dilthey, was concerned about understanding human nature, {{what it means to}} exist, to be.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} {{intrinsic}} motivation is when an employee becomes an IT professional <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> {{she wants to}} learn about how computer users interact with computer networks. The employee has the intrinsic motivation to gain more knowledge. Art for art's sake {{is an example of}} intrinsic motivation in the domain of art.|$|E

25|$|The Speaker {{usually comes}} from among MPs of the {{governing}} party. But <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> she cannot vote unless his or her vote would break a tie and by convention must vote {{to maintain the status}} quo (which includes voting confidence in the government), a minority government can slightly weaken the opposition's power by electing an opposition speaker.|$|E
25|$|An {{honour killing}} is the {{practice}} wherein {{an individual is}} killed {{by one or more}} family member(s), <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> she is believed to have brought shame on the family.

25|$|Next, the Court {{found that}} fair {{criticism}} {{should not be}} limited to criticism raised through formal legal avenues, which include court proceedings and the removal of judges under Article 98(3) of the Constitution. This limitation overburdens the right of free speech, and a person should not be prevented from raising rationally supported criticism simply <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> she does not have access to formal avenues.|$|E

25|$|A {{teacher who}} harasses a student {{may be doing}} so <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> she is {{experiencing}} the stress from various personal problems or life traumas, such as marital trouble or divorce, a professional crisis, financial difficulties, medical problems, or {{the death of a}} spouse or child. Even though the behavior is unacceptable, it can be a symptom of the effects of such stresses, and may stop if the situation changes, or the pressures are removed.|$|E
25|$|One {{effect of}} modern patent usage {{is that a}} small-time inventor, who can afford both the {{patenting}} process and {{the defense of the}} patent, can use the exclusive right status to become a licensor. This allows the inventor to accumulate capital from licensing the invention and may allow innovation to occur <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> she may choose not to manage a manufacturing buildup for the invention. Thus the inventor's time and energy can be spent on pure innovation, allowing others to concentrate on manufacturability.|$|E

25|$|The {{hate speech}} laws in France are matters of both civil law and {{criminal}} law. Those laws protect {{individuals and groups}} from being defamed or insulted because they belong or do not belong, in fact or in fancy, to an ethnicity, a nation, a race, a religion, a sex, or a sexual orientation, or {{because they have a}} handicap. The laws forbid any communication which is intended to incite discrimination against, hatred of, or harm to, anyone because of his belonging or not belonging, in fact or in fancy, to an ethnicity, a nation, a race, a religion, a sex, or a sexual orientation, or <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> she has a handicap.|$|E
25|$|Under the melik of Erivan were {{a number}} of other meliks in the khanate, with each maḥall {{inhabited}} by Armenians having its own local melik. The meliks of Erivan themselves, especially the last, Melik Sahak II, were among the most important, influential and respected individuals in the khanate and both Christians and Muslims alike sought their advice, protection and intercession. Second in importance only to the khan himself, they alone among the Armenians of Erivan were allowed to wear the dress of an Iranian of rank. The melik of Erivan had full administrative, legislative and judicial authority over Armenians up to the sentence of the death penalty, which only the khan was allowed to impose. The melik exercised a military function as well, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> his appointee commanded the Armenian infantry contingents in the khan’s army. All the other meliks and village headmen (tanuters) of the khanate were subordinate to the melik of Erivan and all the Armenian villages of the khanate were required to pay him an annual tax.|$|E
500|$|In 1793, {{when the}} British {{government}} {{called on the}} nation to fast in honour of the war, anti-war Dissenters such as Barbauld were left with a moral quandary: [...] "Obey the order and violate their consciences by praying for success in a war they disapproved? observe the Fast, but preach against the war? defy the Proclamation and refuse to take any part in the Fast?" [...] Barbauld took this opportunity to write a sermon, Sins of Government, Sins of the Nation, on the moral responsibility of the individual; for her, each individual {{is responsible for the}} actions of the nation <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> she constitutes part of the nation. The essay attempts to determine what the proper role of the individual is in the state and while she argues that [...] "insubordination" [...] can undermine a government, she does admit that there are lines of [...] "conscience" [...] that one cannot cross in obeying a government. The text is a classic consideration of the idea of an [...] "unjust war." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1965, the {{benefits}} of the National College of Education partnership were less evident and the Administrative Board purchased Avery Coonley from the NCE. Under Malach's leadership, ACS continued to experiment and innovate. Despite widespread skepticism among contemporary educators that kindergartners were ready to read, ACS launched an early reading program in the early 1960s. Malach's stance was that [...] "we don't believe a child should be taught <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> she is now 6 years old or in 1st grade. Our children begin to learn to read when the teacher determines the child is ready. Then the teacher works individually with the child at his or her own pace." [...] By this time, however, the once-radical ideas of progressive education had become [...] "conventional wisdom" [...] and kindergarten was a ubiquitous feature of American public schools. As part of Malach's [...] "bid to reforge the leadership role that Avery Coonley School had played during its early years", ACS joined the Independent Schools Association of the Central States (ISACS) in 1961. ISACS was founded in 1908 to promote best practices in independent schools, and instituted a mandatory accreditation program for member schools in 1961. Avery Coonley served as the headquarters of ISACS from 1970 until the central office was dissolved in 2000.|$|E
