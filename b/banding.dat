5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on September10, with evidence of a low-level circulation and convective <b>banding.</b> It moved west-northwestward, located south of a subtropical ridge. Based on satellite imagery, it is estimated the system organized into Tropical Depression Nine by 1200UTC on September11 to the south of the Cape Verde islands. Upon its formation, the center was poorly defined, with restricted easterly outflow due to easterly wind shear. After about 24hours of remaining somewhat disorganized, the convection became more concentrated on September12 as <b>banding</b> features and outflow improved. Consequently, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Gert, the seventh named storm of the season.|$|E
5|$|Also bird <b>banding.</b> The {{attachment}} of a small, individually numbered {{metal or}} plastic tag to the leg or wing {{of a wild}} bird to enable individual identification. This helps in {{keeping track of the}} movements of the bird and its life history. Upon capture for ringing, it is common to take measurements and examine the conditions of feather , amount of subcutaneous fat, age indications and sex. The subsequent recapture or recovery of the bird can provide information on migration, longevity, mortality, population, territoriality, feeding behaviour and other aspects that are studied by ornithologists. Bird ringing is the term used in the UK and in some other parts of Europe; while the term bird <b>banding</b> is more often used in the U.S. and Australia.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the next}} two days, however, the system became much more organized. Early on August21, the National Hurricane Center had {{initiated}} advisories on Tropical Depression Eight-E. After the existence of <b>banding</b> features was noted, the intensity was increased to 40mph (65km/h), indicating that the system had intensified into a tropical storm, which was named Fausto by the National Hurricane Center (NHC). Although no further strengthening initially occurred, Fausto began to intensify after a burst in convection early on August22. Rapid deepening began to occur thereafter, and the NHC noted that Fausto exhibited a classic-type <b>banding</b> feature and {{also noted that the}} outflow was increasing. The large size and widespread convection closely resembled a system that would become a major hurricane, Category 3 or higher on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale. The associated <b>banding</b> features began to wrap completely around the system, and evidence of a developing eye was seen via weather satellite. Simultaneously, satellite estimates made via the Dvorak technique indicated that intensity of Fausto was 75mph (120km/h), and as a result, the NHC upgraded it to a hurricane.|$|E

5|$|The system {{began as}} a {{tropical}} wave that emerged off {{the west coast of}} Africa on September 21. The wave was not well-organized with only scattered thunderstorm activity and large area of low pressure. As the system tracked westward south of Cape Verde, deep convection gradually increased, curved <b>banding</b> features became defined, and a poorly defined circulation became evident. Early on September 23, Dvorak classification estimates were introduced. Little change in organization took place until the evening of September 24. That evening, the low-level circulation and <b>banding</b> features became better defined as the system tracked west-northwest. Late that evening, the system was declared Tropical Depression Twelve while west-southwest of the Cape Verde islands.|$|E
5|$|Upon being {{classified}} {{a tropical}} depression, the NHC {{noted that the}} center of circulation was difficult to locate and the mid-level circulation was displaced from the low-level circulation. The cyclone tracked slightly north of due west {{in response to a}} small ridge to the north. Moderate wind shear initially displaced convective activity to the west. Several hours after being classified, the NHC upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Fred; this was the first use of the name Fred in the Atlantic basin after it replaced Fabian which was retired in 2003. This followed the development of convective <b>banding</b> features along the periphery of the storm and strong shower and thunderstorm activity forming over the center of Fred. The system continued to organize, with the <b>banding</b> features becoming well-defined within hours and strong outflow developing around the storm.|$|E

50|$|Brass <b>bands</b> {{were very}} popular {{throughout}} the United States {{in the late}} 19th century and {{the early decades of}} the 20th century. Well known <b>bands</b> of virtuoso musicians toured widely, and most towns had their own <b>bands</b> that put on weekend music concerts. One notable example of this was The Ohio State University Marching <b>Band</b> which formed in 1879 and still performs with only brass and percussion instruments. Other groups, ranging from benevolent societies to large factories, would often have a <b>band.</b> The brass <b>band</b> movement has undergone a resurgence in the late twentieth century, led by the North American Brass <b>Band</b> Association. The United States boasts a number of professional brass <b>bands,</b> including the Brass <b>Band</b> of Battle Creek, the River City Brass <b>Band,</b> and the Orchid City Brass <b>Band</b> (West Palm Beach, FL); community brass <b>bands</b> such as the Central Ohio Brass <b>Band,</b> Dublin Silver <b>Band,</b> Motor City Brass <b>Band,</b> Atlantic Brass <b>Band,</b> Brass of the Potomac, Chesapeake Silver Cornet Brass <b>Band</b> (Delaware), Five Lakes Silver <b>Band,</b> Allegheny Brass <b>Band,</b> The Brass <b>Band</b> of Central Florida, the Sheldon Theatre Brass <b>Band</b> (Red Wing, MN), the Lake Wobegon Brass <b>Band</b> (Anoka, MN), the Twin Cities Brass <b>Band</b> (Bloomington, MN), the Fountain City Brass <b>Band,</b> the Triangle Brass <b>Band,</b> the Smoky Mountain Brass <b>Band</b> and the River Brass; several collegiate brass <b>bands,</b> including the James Madison University Brass <b>Band,</b> the Mansfield University Brass <b>Band,</b> the Slippery Rock University Brass Ensemble and the University of Georgia British Brass Band; and various youth brass <b>bands,</b> including the Triangle Youth Brass <b>Band</b> and the Fountain City Youth Brass <b>Bands</b> also exist.|$|R
5|$|A {{relatively}} strong tropical wave {{emerged into}} the Atlantic Ocean {{from the northwest}} coast of Africa on August15. Moving westward, the wave split while well east of the Lesser Antilles, with a portion developing into Tropical Depression Seven on August21, which eventually strengthened into Tropical Storm Chris. The remaining portion of the wave continued westward and reached the Caribbean Sea as a disorganized center of showers. During the night of August 29, some cloud <b>banding</b> developed, followed by {{the formation of a}} low-level center over the Yucatán Peninsula on August30. Shortly after entering the Bay of Campeche on August31, the system was given a T1.5 rating on the Dvorak scale, based on appearance on satellite imagery. As a result, the wave developed into Tropical Depression Eight at 18:00UTC on August31. Cloud <b>banding</b> and outflow patterns became further organized on September1. The depression moved generally west-northwestward, steered by a high pressure area situated over the Eastern United States.|$|E
5|$|A strong {{ridge of}} high {{pressure}} continued {{to push the}} system west, towards the Caribbean Sea. That afternoon, convective <b>banding</b> and increasing upper-level outflow strengthened the storm to a Category2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. The eye disappeared briefly overnight, possibly {{as part of a}} diurnal fluctuation, but returned by the morning of August17.|$|E
5|$|<b>Banding</b> {{features}} and outflow continued to develop as {{a ring of}} convection formed around the center of Fabian, and on August 30, the storm intensified into a hurricane while gradually slowing its motion to the west-northwest. As <b>banding</b> {{features and}} outflow became better defined, an eye developed {{in the center of}} the deepest convection. Fabian quickly strengthened and attained major hurricane status late that day. Deep convection became very concentric around the 11.5mile (18.5km) wide eye, and the hurricane reached winds of 125mph (205km/h) early on August 31. At this time, the deepest convection near the eye degraded in appearance, and Fabian temporarily stopped its strengthening trend. Later that day, the eye became distinct again within a perfectly round area of deep convection. Outflow continued to expand in all directions, and Fabian intensified into a Category 4 hurricane late on August 31. Thunderstorm activity near the eyewall became more intense, and the cloud tops in the eyewall became much cooler; simultaneously, outflow away from the eye became much more symmetrical, both signs of an intensifying tropical cyclone. Fabian reached its peak intensity of 145mph (230km/h) on September 1 while located 345miles (555km) east of the northern Lesser Antilles.|$|E

5|$|During {{the second}} week of May, low {{pressures}} persisted across the Bay of Bengal. An area of convection developed on May 11, and the next day the India Meteorological Department (IMD) classified it as a depression. The system drifted northward, and initially moderate wind shear kept the deep convection {{on the periphery of the}} consolidating low-level circulation center. Gradually, <b>banding</b> features developed along the eastern semicircle, and with decreasing amounts of wind shear the system organized further. By May 13, the pressure had dropped to 1000mbar as wind shear levels dropped significantly. An anticyclone developed over the system, while a mid-latitude trough over northeastern India provided favorable outflow. Convection continued to consolidate around the low-level circulation, and with well-defined <b>banding</b> features and a central dense overcast over the center of circulation, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) upgraded it to Tropical Cyclone 01B at 1121UTC on May 13 while located about 545km (340mi) west-northwest of Yangon, Burma.|$|E

5|$|In {{the second}} week of September, a strong {{tropical}} wave began to emerge off the coast of Africa. It was well-organized from the start, and on September 11, even before it emerged off the coast, the National Hurricane Center predicted that it could quickly develop into a tropical depression. That is indeed what happened, and it became Tropical Depression Eight on the morning of September 12. The enormous size of the depression made it fairly slow to develop, combined with some easterly wind shear in the eastern Atlantic and influence of the Saharan Air Layer to the north as it tracked south of the Cape Verde islands. Convection was also slow to build in, with little <b>banding</b> at first. The initial strengthening was delayed as a result. However, on September 13, the organization improved as <b>banding</b> became better defined, and that evening, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Helene.|$|E

5|$|Land {{interaction}} during Krovanh's {{passage of}} Luzon significantly weakened the cyclone, and upon the system's reemergence into the South China Sea by 2000UTC on August22, Krovanh {{was classified as}} only a tropical storm by the JMA. Redevelopment was rather rapid following emergence, and just four hours later the storm was redesignated as a severe tropical storm. On August24, the storm began to develop tight <b>banding</b> and reformed its prior <b>banding</b> eye feature, which later organized into a well defined eye. Later that day Krovanh clipped the northeastern coast of Hainan before crossing the Leizhou Peninsula on August25. During this time, the JMA upgraded Krovanh back to typhoon intensity and indicated that the storm was reaching a secondary peak in strength. The JTWC indicated a similar development as the typhoon traversed the Gulf of Tonkin. However, according to the JMA, Krovanh waned into a severe tropical storm shortly before the storm made its final landfall on Cẩm Phả, Vietnam at approximately 1500UTC on August25. Over land, Krovanh deteriorated rapidly, and both agencies ceased monitoring the system on August26 while it was well northwest of Hanoi.|$|E
5|$|Late on September 12, while {{approaching}} the northern Lesser Antilles, convection increased and became better organized around {{an area of}} increased cyclonic turning. Environmental conditions became more favorable, allowing {{for the development of}} a low pressure area and for <b>banding</b> features to increase. Late on September 13, with the formation of a broad low-level circulation, it is estimated the system developed into Tropical Depression Eleven about 70mi (110km) east-southeast of Guadeloupe.|$|E
5|$|On July 21, {{the storm}} {{deteriorated}} in organization as it continued northward. The lack of <b>banding</b> features indicated that by early on July 22, Becky was barely a tropical storm.
