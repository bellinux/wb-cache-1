500|$|Higginbotham {{attended}} Lincoln School, {{a segregated}} {{high school in}} Trenton. [...] Prior to Higginbotham, no black student had {{been put on the}} academic track (which was a significant step towards attending college), because Latin, a requirement for the program, was not taught at the black elementary schools. Higginbotham's mother convinced the principal at the junior high school to enroll him in a second-year Latin course, even though he had never studied first year Latin. To ensure {{that he was able to}} pass the required classes, the junior high Latin teacher offered to tutor him at her home during the summer. Higginbotham's family was of modest economic means, so he worked while attending school, mowing lawns, shoveling snow, and working as a <b>bus</b> <b>boy</b> at the Stacy Trent hotel. While in high school, Higginbotham manipulated his birth certificate in order to get working papers at 15, a year before the law allowed, so that he could work in a pottery factory shoveling clay.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{attempts}} {{to shed light}} on the key drivers of consumer tipping behavior and reports the findings from an exploratory study aimed at addressing consumer motivations and their influence on consumers’ willingness to tip. When approaching the research issue, the phenomenon presents an interesting subject for study. In the United States alone, such occupations as servers, bartenders, maitre’d, concierges, hair stylists, <b>bus</b> <b>boys,</b> and bellhops all depend on tips as a primary source of income. Considering that many occupations derive the majority of compensation from tips, “estimated tips in US restaurants alone are about 27 billion annually. ” (Azar, 2007, 252) In an economic sense, tipping is not only a custom throughout numerous countries; for many individuals {{it is a way of}} life. Clearly, the custom of tipping impacts the lives of millions on a daily basis and while there are no definitive answers regarding why consumers tip the way they do, previous research does provide plausible theories on tipping behavior(s). Research suggests that consumers tip for a variety of reasons, such as compliance to social norms and pressures, social approval, equity in exchange relationships, service received and a variety of other environmental factors (Grassman 2 ̆ 6 Lynn, 1990). Against this background, this study has one overriding objective, {{to shed light on}} those motivations driving the consumer’s decision to tip while utilizing exploratory factor analysis...|$|R
40|$|Understanding {{of social}} network {{structure}} and user behavior {{has important implications}} for site design, applications (e. g., ad placement policies), accurate modeling for social studies, and design of next-generation infrastructure and content distribution systems. Currently, characterizations of social networks have been dominated by topological studies in which graph representations are analyzed in terms of connectivity using techniques such as degree distribution, diameter, average degree, clustering coefficient, average path length, and cycles. The problem is that these parameters are not completely satisfactory {{in the sense that they}} cannot account for individual events and have only limited use, since one can produce a set of synthetic graphs that have the exact same metrics or statistics but exhibit fundamentally different connectivity structures. In such an approach, a node drawn as a small circle represents an individual. A small circle reflects a black box model in which the interior of the node is blocked from view. This paper focuses on the node level by considering the structural interiority of a node to provide a more fine-grained understanding of social networks. Node interiors are modeled by use of six generic stages: creation, release, transfer, arrival, acceptance, and processing of the artifacts that flow among and within nodes. The resulting description portrays nodes as comprising mostly creators (e. g., of data), receivers/senders (e. g., <b>bus</b> <b>boys),</b> and processors (re-formatters). Two sample online social networks are analyzed according to these features of nodes. This examination points to the viability of the representational method for characterization of social networks...|$|R
