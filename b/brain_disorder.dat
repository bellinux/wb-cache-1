It is typically treated with anticonvulsants such as phenobarbital or bromide in dogs and phenobarbital in cats. Imepitoin is also used in dogs. While generalized seizures in horses are fairly easy to diagnose, it may be more difficult in non-generalized seizures and EEGs may be useful.|$|E
5|$|Megan {{receives}} backlash from Kate for {{not following}} procedure, but clay found in both Lizzy and Joe's pockets match. Samantha realizes that Joe found {{the crime scene}} of Lizzy's murder; the tennis courts at her school. Kate and Megan study her body and find a hand impression on her back, which matches {{one of her friends}} Heather Clayton (Meg Chambers Steedle). Heather killed Lizzy after she broke her finger during a lacrosse game. Lizzy's body was found elsewhere, meaning Heather had help moving the body, so Megan finds out that Lou helped Heather. Lou also admits killing Joe, as he was getting too close to the truth. After they arrest them, Megan revisits her mother Joan, asking to exhume her father’s body. Joan declines the request, telling Megan to leave him be. Megan and Samantha revisit Helen and Becky, revealing that Joe had an undiagnosed <b>brain</b> <b>disorder,</b> causing the emotional distance from the two, telling them that Joe helped solve the Lizzy Adler case.|$|E

40|$|Mounting {{evidence}} shows that <b>brain</b> <b>disorders</b> involve multiple and different neural dysfunctions, including regional brain damage, change to cell structure, chemical imbalance, and/or connectivity loss among different brain regions. Understanding the complexity of <b>brain</b> <b>disorders</b> can help us map these neural dysfunctions to different symptom clusters as well as understand subcategories of different <b>brain</b> <b>disorders.</b> Here, we discuss data on the mapping of symptom clusters to different neural dysfunctions using examples from <b>brain</b> <b>disorders</b> such as major depressive disorder, Parkinson’s disease, schizophrenia, PTSD and Alzheimer’s disease. In addition, we discuss data on the similarities of symptoms in different disorders.

40|$|BACKGROUND: People with <b>brain</b> <b>{{disorders}}</b> - {{defined as}} both, mental disorders and neurological disorders experience {{a wide range}} of psychosocial difficulties (PSDs) (e. g., concentrating, maintaining energy levels, and maintaining relationships). Research evidence is required to show that these PSDs are common across <b>brain</b> <b>disorders.</b> OBJECTIVES: To explore and gain deeper understanding of the experiences of people with seven <b>brain</b> <b>disorders</b> (alcohol dependency, depression, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, stroke). It examines the common PSDs and their influencing factors. METHODS: Seventy seven qualitative studies identified in a systematic literature review and qualitative data derived from six focus groups are used to generate first-person narratives representing seven <b>brain</b> <b>disorders.</b> A theory-driven thematic analysis of these narratives identifies the PSDs and their influencing factors for comparison between the seven disorders. RESULTS: First-person narratives illustrate realities for people with <b>brain</b> <b>disorders</b> facilitating a deeper understanding of their every-day life experiences. Thematic analysis serves to highlight the commonalities, both of PSDs, such as loneliness, anger, uncertainty about the future and problems with work activities, and their determinants, such as work opportunities, trusting relationships and access to self-help groups. CONCLUSIONS: The strength of the methodology and the narratives is that they provide the opportunity for the reader to empathise with people with <b>brain</b> <b>disorders</b> and facilitate deeper levels of understanding of the complexity of the relationship of PSDs, determinants and facilitators. The latter reflect positive aspects of the lives of people with <b>brain</b> <b>disorders.</b> The result that many PSDs and their influencing factors are common to people with different <b>brain</b> <b>disorders</b> opens up the door to the possibility of using cross-cutting interventions involving different sectors. This strengthens the message that 'a great deal can be done' to improve the lived experience of persons with <b>brain</b> <b>disorders</b> when medical interventions are exhausted. <br/...|$|R

25|$|While {{there is}} some overlap between {{biological}} psychiatry and neurology, the latter generally focuses on disorders where gross or visible pathology {{of the nervous system}} is apparent, such as epilepsy, cerebral palsy, encephalitis, neuritis, Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis. There is some overlap with neuropsychiatry, which typically deals with behavioral disturbances in the context of apparent <b>brain</b> <b>disorder.</b> In contrast biological psychiatry describes the basic principles and then delves deeper into various disorders. It is structured to follow the organisation of the DSM-IV, psychiatry's primary diagnostic and classification guide. The contributions of this field explore functional neuroanatomy, imaging and neuropsychology and pharmacotherapeutic possibilities for depression, anxiety and mood disorders, substance abuse and eating disorders, schizophrenia and psychotic disorders, and cognitive and personality disorders.|$|E
30|$|Many <b>brain</b> <b>disorders</b> are {{characterized}} by ongoing injury that is clinically silent for prolonged periods and irreversible by the time symptoms first present. New approaches for detection of early changes in subclinical periods will afford powerful tools for aiding clinical diagnosis, clarifying underlying mechanisms, and informing neuroprotective interventions to slow or reverse neural injury for {{a broad spectrum of}} <b>brain</b> <b>disorders,</b> including bipolar disorder, HIV infection on brain, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, etc. Early diagnosis has the potential to greatly alleviate the burden of <b>brain</b> <b>disorders</b> and the ever increasing costs to families and society.|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that most <b>brain</b> <b>disorders</b> are complex diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and {{schizophrenia}} (SCZ). In general, brain regions and their interactions can be modeled as complex brain network, which describe highly efficient information transmission in a brain. Therefore, complex brain network analysis {{plays an important role in}} the study of complex brain diseases. With the development of noninvasive neuroimaging and electrophysiological techniques, experimental data can be produced for constructing complex brain networks. In recent years, researchers have found that brain networks constructed by using neuroimaging data and electrophysiological data have many important topological properties, such as small-world property, modularity, and rich club. More importantly, many <b>brain</b> <b>disorders</b> have been found to be associated with the abnormal topological structures of brain networks. These findings provide not only a new perspective to explore the pathological mechanisms of <b>brain</b> <b>disorders,</b> but also guidance for early diagnosis and treatment of <b>brain</b> <b>disorders.</b> The purpose of this survey is to provide a comprehensive overview for complex brain network analysis and its applications to <b>brain</b> <b>disorders...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Brain</b> <b>disorders</b> {{represent}} a high burden in Europe and worldwide. The {{objective of this}} study was to provide specific estimates of the economic costs of <b>brain</b> <b>disorders</b> in Spain, based on published epidemiological and economic evidence. A cost-of-illness study with a societal perspective of 19 <b>brain</b> <b>disorders</b> was carried out. Cost data published between 2004 and 2012 was obtained from a systematic literature review. Direct healthcare, direct non-medical and indirect costs were considered, prioritizing bottom-up information. All costs were converted to Euro and to year 2010. The missing values were imputed with European estimates. Sensitivity analyses based on qualitative assessment of the literature and on a Monte Carlo simulation were performed. The review identified 33 articles with information on costs for 11 disorders (8 neurological, 3 mental). The average per-patient cost ranged from 36, 946 € for multiple sclerosis to 402 € for headache. The societal cost of the 19 <b>brain</b> <b>disorders</b> in Spain in 2010 was estimated in 84 € billion. Societal costs ranged from 15 € billion for dementia to 65 € million for eating disorders. Mental disorders societal cost were 46 € billions (55 % of the total), while neurological disorder added up to 38 € billion. Healthcare costs represented 37 % of the societal costs of <b>brain</b> <b>disorders,</b> whereas direct non-medical constituted 29 % and indirect costs 33 %. <b>Brain</b> <b>disorders</b> have a substantial economic impact in Spain (equivalent to almost 8 % of the country's GDP).

Questions addressing 64 PSDs were first reduced based on statistical considerations, patient’s perspective and clinical expertise. Rasch analyses for polytomous data were also applied. Setting: In and outpatient settings. Results: A valid and reliable metric with 24 items was created. The infit of all questions ranged between 0. 7 and 1. 3. There were no disordered thresholds. The targeting between item thresholds and persons’ abilities was good and the person-separation index was 0. 92. Persons’ abilities were linearly transformed into a more intuitive scale ranging from zero (no PSDs) to 100 (extreme PSDs). Conclusion: The metric, called PARADISE 24, is based on the hypothesis of horizontal epidemiology, which affirms that people with <b>brain</b> <b>disorders</b> commonly experience PSDs.
