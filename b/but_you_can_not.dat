60|$|What {{has been}} said thus far relates {{obviously}} to cases where the mother is at the commencement of her work of training. This {{is the way to}} begin; <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> begin unless you are at the beginning. If your children are partly grown, and you find that they are not under your command, the difficulty is much greater. The principles which should govern the management are the same, but they can not be applied by means so gentle. The prison, it may be, must now be somewhat more real, the terms of imprisonment somewhat longer, and there may be cases of insubordination so decided as to require the offender to be carried to it by force, on account of his refusal to go of his own accord, and perhaps to be held there, or even to be tied. Cases requiring treatment so decisive as this must be very rare with children under ten years of age; and when they occur, the mother has reason to feel great self-condemnation--or at least great self-abasement--at finding that she has failed so entirely in the first great moral duty of the mother, which is to train her children to complete submission to her authority from the beginning.|$|E
60|$|It {{was a funny}} bath. We {{could not}} sink. One could stretch himself at full length on his back, with his arms on his breast, {{and all of his}} body above a line drawn {{from the corner of his}} jaw past the middle of his side, the middle of his leg and through his ancle bone, would remain out of water. He could lift his head clear out, if he chose. No {{position}} can be retained long; you lose your balance and whirl over, first on your back and then on your face, and so on. You can lie comfortably, on your back, with your head out, and your legs out from your knees down, by steadying yourself with your hands. You can sit, with your knees drawn up to your chin and your arms clasped around them, but you are bound to turn over presently, because you are top-heavy in that position. You can stand up straight in water that is over your head, and from the middle of your breast upward you will not be wet. <b>But</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> remain so. The water will soon float your feet to the surface. You can not swim on your back and make any progress of any consequence, because your feet stick away above the surface, and there is nothing to propel yourself with but your heels. If you swim on your face, you kick up the water like a stern-wheel boat. You make no headway. A horse is so top-heavy that he can neither swim nor stand up in the Dead Sea. He turns over on his side at once. Some of us bathed for more than an hour, and then came out coated with salt till we shone like icicles. We scrubbed it off with a coarse towel and rode off with a splendid brand-new smell, though it was one which was not any more disagreeable than those we have been for several weeks enjoying. It was the variegated villainy and novelty of it that charmed us. Salt crystals glitter in the sun about the shores of the lake. In places they coat the ground like a brilliant crust of ice.|$|E

40|$|Virtual Reality (VR) {{has been}} around for more than fifty years but the {{technology}} hasn’t reached practical usability until very recently. With the current head-mounted display (HMD) technology and an abundance of investment in VR startups, we have finally reached at the point where it is possible to simulate complex virtual environments that feel immersive. A major problem with virtual reality is that everything looks real <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> touch and feel virtual objects. We are focusing on developing a device that will allow users to feel what they touch in VR. We developed a hand-held interface and an android app as a test environment. Commercially-available solutions such as the leap motion developer’s kit were used to track the position of a user’s hand. The actual touch sensation was delivered by a broad-band actuator. Informal testing suggests that being able to feel a virtual object, such as a virtual football, in the hands can enhance user immersion, enjoyment and performance in VR. Future work will improve hand tracking accuracy and range of touch sensations for a more realistic user experience...|$|E

40|$|Title of thesis: Influence of intra-abdominal {{pressure}} on {{the stability of the}} lumbar spine Definition of the problem: This thesis addresses the problem of the stabilization mechanism of the lumbar spine and the influence of {{intra-abdominal pressure}} on the stability of the lumbar spine. Objectives: The aim of my thesis is to locate, evaluate and process all available resources and to bring up the issue of IAP and its influence on the lumbar spine. The work should provide the widest possible insight into the problems of IAP effects on the stability of the lumbar spine, summarize differing opinions, and allow easier orientation in the isme. Method: The work is treated as a search, focusing on the processing and retrieval of literature concerning the issue. Studies included range from 1953 to present. To which I will use a variety of sources of literature, internet and consultation with the head of my thesis. Results: The increase in IAP, which is provided by a synchronous contraction of the diaphragm, pelvic floor muscles and m. transversus abdominis, can effectively stabilize the spine. <b>But</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> determine with certainty whether this mechanism to support the stability of the lumbar spine is indeed used or the stability is provided by contraction of muscles, leading to an increase in IAP, and [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Environmental {{issues are}} very {{relevant}} in society today {{and therefore we}} chose to do our thesis on environmental accounting. There is currently no requirement for Swedish municipalities to carry out environmental accounting. Therefore, {{we thought it was}} interesting to study the environmental accounting in Swedish municipalities and the content of environmental accounting. We were in the thesis, intended to examine whether there was any connection between the three municipalities' environmental accounts in 2006 - 2009 and the media's reporting during the same period. The three municipalities that we chose in the thesis were Huddinge, Burlöv and Sandviken. The municipalities were selected because they had the same sort of environmental reporting in the form of environmental accounts and that they all had carried out the environmental accounts in the four years 2006 - 2009. We used a qualitative approach in this paper, where we were able to examine more deeply the selected items. The investigation has been a case study of the municipalities and media press. We based the thesis on relevant theories and then compared them in the analysis of the case study to get a result. The result that we got was that a lot of what was reported in the media were also in the municipal environmental accounts. <b>But</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> with certainty say that there is a connection between media reports and what was reported in the environmental accounts. Each municipality's environmental accounts followed a pattern during the four years. Although the local environmental accounts all were different from each other, there was nonetheless a similarity because they all followed a pattern. It is therefore difficult {{to say that there is}} a connection because they seem to report about the same topics each year. One of the three financial statements stood out as their environmental accounts each year explored a theme, but we still do not see that there is a clear correlation.
