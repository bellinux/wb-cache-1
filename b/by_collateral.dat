They encountered 73 mitochondrial lineages separated by an average of 4% sequence divergence and, as these lineages are supported <b>by</b> <b>collateral</b> ecological information, and, where tested, by independent nuclear markers (28S and ITS1), the authors therefore viewed these lineages as provisional species. Each of the 16 initially apparent generalist species were categorized into one of four patterns: (i) a single generalist species, (ii) a pair of morphologically cryptic generalist species, (iii) a complex of specialist species plus a generalist, or (iv) a complex of specialists with no remaining generalist. In sum, there remained 9 generalist species classified among the 73 mitochondrial lineages analyzed.|$|E

500|$|In Mashpee, the First Circuit {{rejected}} the Mashpee's attempt {{to stay the}} litigation until the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) could adjudicate the tribe's petition for federal recognition. The court noted: [...] "The Department has never formally passed on the tribal status of the Mashpees or, {{so far as the}} record shows, any other group whose status was disputed. Therefore, the Department does not yet have prescribed procedures and has not been called on to develop special expertise in distinguishing tribes from other groups of Indians." [...] Yet, in 1978, the BIA had promulgated regulations establishing the criteria for federal recognition of tribes. In light of these new regulations, and their later use, the Second Circuit has held that the BIA retains [...] "primary jurisdiction" [...] over tribal recognition. In other words, Nonintercourse Act claims by unrecognized tribes must be stayed until the BIA is given a timely opportunity to adjudicate the tribe's petition for recognition. If the BIA rejects a tribe's petition, the tribe's Nonintercourse Act claim may be barred <b>by</b> <b>collateral</b> estoppel.|$|E

60|$|If, indeed, {{reliance}} {{could be}} placed on the conscience of the contributors, or sufficient security taken for the correctness of their statements <b>by</b> <b>collateral</b> precautions, the proper mode of assessing an income-tax would be to tax only the part of income devoted to expenditure, exempting that which is saved. For when saved and invested (and all savings, speaking generally, are invested) it thenceforth pays income-tax on the interest or profit which it brings, notwithstanding that it has already been taxed on the principal. Unless, therefore, savings are exempted from income-tax, the contributors are twice taxed on what they save, and only once on what they spend. To tax the sum invested, and afterward tax also the proceeds of the investment, is to tax the same portion of the contributor’s means twice over.|$|E

60|$|The Anglo-American {{is apt to}} boast, and {{not without}} reason, that his nation may claim a descent more truly honourable than {{that of any other}} people whose history is to be credited. Whatever might have been the {{weaknesses}} of the original colonists, their virtues have rarely been disputed. If they were superstitious, they were sincerely pious, and, consequently, honest. The descendants of these simple and single-minded provincials have been content to reject the ordinary and artificial means by which honours have been perpetuated in families, and have substituted a standard which brings the individual himself to the ordeal of the public estimation, paying as little deference as may be to those who have gone before him. This forbearance, self-denial, or common sense, or by whatever term it may be thought proper to distinguish the measure, has subjected the nation to the imputation of having an ignoble origin. Were it worth the enquiry, it would be found that more than a just proportion of the renowned names of the mother-country are, at this hour, to be found in her ci-devant colonies; and it is a fact well known to the few who have wasted sufficient time to become the masters of so unimportant a subject, that the direct descendants of many a failing line, which the policy of England has seen fit to sustain <b>by</b> <b>collateral</b> supporters, are now discharging the simple duties of citizens in the bosom of this republic. The hive has remained stationary, and they who flutter around the venerable straw are wont to claim the empty distinction of antiquity, regardless alike of the frailty of their tenement and of the enjoyments of the numerous and vigorous swarms that are culling the fresher sweets of a virgin world. But as this is a subject which belongs rather to the politician and historian than to the humble narrator of the homebred incidents we are about to reveal, we must confine our reflections to such matters as have an immediate relation to the subject of the tale.|$|E
6000|$|It {{is plain}} à priori that {{the minds of}} Statesmen and Courtiers are {{unfavourable}} {{to the growth of}} this knowledge. For they are in a situation exclusive and artificial; which has the further disadvantage, that it does not separate men from men <b>by</b> <b>collateral</b> partitions which leave, along with difference, a sense of equality--that they, who are divided, are yet upon the same level; but by a degree of superiority which can scarcely fail to be accompanied with more or less of pride. This situation therefore must be eminently unfavourable for the reception and establishment of that knowledge which is founded not upon things but upon sensations;--sensations which are general, and under general influences (and this it is which makes them what they are, and gives them their importance);--not upon things which may be brought; but upon sensations which must be met. Passing by the kindred and usually accompanying influence of birth in a certain rank--and, where education has been pre-defined from childhood {{for the express purpose of}} future political power, the tendency of such education to warp (and therefore weaken) the intellect;--we may join at once, with the privation which I have been noticing, a delusion equally common. It is this: that practical Statesmen assume too much credit to themselves for their ability to see into the motives and manage the selfish passions of their immediate agents and dependants; and for the skill with which they baffle or resist the aims of their opponents. A promptness in looking through the most superficial part of the characters of those men--who, by the very circumstance of their contending ambitiously for the rewards and honours of government, are separated from the mass of the society to which they belong--is mistaken for a knowledge of human kind. Hence, where higher knowledge is a prime requisite, they not only are unfurnished, but, being unconscious that they are so, they look down contemptuously upon those who endeavour to supply (in some degree) their want.--The instincts of natural and social man; the deeper emotions; the simpler feelings; the spacious range of the disinterested imagination; the pride in country for country's sake, when to serve has not been a formal profession--and the mind is therefore left in a state of dignity only to be surpassed by having served nobly and generously; the instantaneous accomplishment in which they start up who, upon a searching call, stir for the Land which they love--not from personal motives, but for a reward which is undefined and cannot be missed; the solemn fraternity which a great Nation composes--gathered together, in a stormy season, under the shade of ancestral feeling; the delicacy of moral honour which pervades the minds of a people, when despair has been suddenly thrown off and expectations are lofty; the apprehensiveness to a touch unkindly or irreverent, where sympathy is at once exacted as a tribute and welcomed as a gift; the power of injustice and inordinate calamity to transmute, to invigorate, and to govern--to sweep away the barriers of opinion--to reduce under submission passions purely evil--to exalt the nature of indifferent qualities, and to render them fit companions for the absolute virtues with which they are summoned to associate--to consecrate passions which, if not bad in themselves, are of such temper that, in the calm of ordinary life, they are rightly deemed so--to correct and embody these passions--and, without weakening them (nay, with tenfold addition to their strength), to make them worthy of taking their place as the advanced guard of hope, when a sublime movement of deliverance is to be originated;--these arrangements and resources of nature, these ways and means of society, have so little connection with those others upon which a ruling minister of a long-established government is accustomed to depend; these--elements as it were of a universe, functions of a living body--are so opposite, in their mode of action, to the formal machine which it has been his pride to manage;--that he has but a faint perception of their immediate efficacy; knows not the facility with which they assimilate with other powers; nor the property by which such of them--as, from necessity of nature, must change or pass away--will, under wise and fearless management, surely generate lawful successors to fill their place when their appropriate work is performed. Nay, of the majority of men, who are usually found in high stations under old governments, it may without injustice be said; that, when they look about them in times (alas! too rare) which present the glorious product of such agency to their eyes, they have not a right, to say--with a dejected man in the midst of the woods, the rivers, the mountains, the sunshine, and shadows of some transcendant landscape-- ...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{study the}} vasomotor {{response}} (cold pressor/basal flow) in myocardium perfused entirely <b>by</b> <b>collaterals,</b> using the reflex sympathetic stimulation of cold pressor stress. DESIGN: Regional myocardial blood flow {{was measured in}} collateral dependent and in remote myocardium using positron emission tomography with 15 O water at basal and at cold pressor stress. Regional ischaemia was measured with 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). PATIENTS: Nine patients (mean (SD) age 53 (6) years) with an occluded coronary artery supplied entirely <b>by</b> <b>collaterals</b> from other angiographically normal arteries. RESULTS: In remote myocardium, basal and cold pressor flow were 0. 99 (0. 26) and 1. 46 (0. 60) ml/min/g (P < 0. 05), respectively, a myocardial vasomotor response of 1. 46 (0. 45). In collateral dependent myocardium, basal and cold pressor flow were 0. 91 (0. 20) and 0. 87 (0. 35) ml/min/g, respectively (the latter value, P < 0. 05 v remote region), a myocardial vasomotor response of 0. 97 (0. 43) (P < 0. 05 v remote region). The myocardial vascular resistance (mean arterial pressure/flow) during cold pressor was higher in the collateral dependent than in remote myocardium, at 147. 0 (61. 1) and 85. 6 (32. 3) mm Hg. min. g/ml (P < 0. 05), respectively, but with no relative increase in FDG uptake. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to the decrease in myocardial resistance in remote myocardium with cold pressor, an increase was observed in collateral dependent myocardium suggesting a vasoconstrictor response in resistive vessels, without demonstrable myocardial ischaemia...|$|R
