5|$|Kishi {{specifically}} {{requested that}} sound and music director Satoki Iida {{work on the}} project, who also helped with the proofreading of the script due to Maeda's fixation on the music production. Iida was interviewed in the April 2010 issue of Dengeki G's Magazine, where it was stated that Maeda and the group Anant-Garde Eyes received Iida's approval to employ a minimalist approach to the <b>background</b> <b>music</b> (<b>BGM)</b> used throughout the anime. Iida admitted that it was uncustomary to use this music genre in anime {{and that he had}} to go through various trials and errors with Maeda and Anant-Garde Eyes to get the music right. Maeda and Anant-Garde Eyes strove to create individual quality music tracks, while Iida pursued the goal of having music that would be useful as BGM tracks, which caused problems during the creation process. Iida realized that it was important for the music and the visuals to combine together to create a synchronization between the two. Toba first took notice of Angel Beats! character designer and chief animator Katsuzō Hirata during the production of Gurren Lagann (2007) with his skill as an artist and ability to finish work quickly, but thoroughly. It was after Toba saw Hirata's work as chief animator of Strike Witches (2008), however, that he pursued Hirata to join the Angel Beats! staff; Maeda also gave his seal of approval for Hirata.|$|E

40|$|<b>Background</b> <b>music</b> {{is often}} used in {{preschool}} classrooms {{with the belief that}} music makes children smarter and increases attention. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine if <b>background</b> <b>music</b> increased children's focused attention during play activities. Focused attention occurs when children maintain attention to a task regardless of distractions. This quasiexperimental study investigated <b>background</b> <b>music</b> and play in a laboratory setting. I videotaped individual children during play with math manipulatives in a pretest-posttest research design with <b>background</b> <b>music</b> used as the treatment. Forty-three 3 -, 4 -, and 5 -year-olds played for 15 minutes. The first 5 minutes of play had no music (pretest), the second 5 -minute play episode had <b>background</b> <b>music</b> (treatment), and the final 5 -minute play episode had no <b>background</b> <b>music</b> (posttest). Data were analyzed using one-way repeated measures analysis of variance. Findings revealed that the subjects paid less attention to the play task with <b>background</b> <b>music</b> than they did during the pretest, with no music. Another key finding was that children with more musical experiences at home, as reported by the Child's Home Musical Experience Survey (CHIMES), exhibited longer periods of focused attention with <b>background</b> <b>music.</b> This study confirmed previous research that 3 -year-old children have shorter focused attention than 4 - and 5 -year-old children with and without <b>background</b> <b>music.</b> These findings have implications for teachers and parents that <b>background</b> <b>music,</b> instead of increasing attention in children, might indeed decrease children's focused attention during play activities...|$|R

40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{explored}} brain computer interface (BCI) systems based on auditory stimuli, which could help patients with visual impairments. Usability and user satisfaction are important considerations in any BCI. Although <b>background</b> <b>music</b> can influence emotion {{and performance in}} other task environments, and many users may wish {{to listen to music}} while using a BCI, auditory and other BCIs are typically studied without <b>background</b> <b>music.</b> Some work has explored the possibility of using polyphonic music in auditory BCI systems. However, this approach requires users with good musical skills, and has not been explored in online experiments. Our hypothesis was that an auditory BCI with <b>background</b> <b>music</b> would be preferred by subjects over a similar BCI without <b>background</b> <b>music,</b> without any difference in BCI performance. We introduce a simple paradigm (which does not require musical skill) using percussion instrument sound stimuli and <b>background</b> <b>music,</b> and evaluated it in both offline and online experiments. The result showed that subjects preferred the auditory BCI with <b>background</b> <b>music.</b> Different performance measures did not reveal any significant performance effect when comparing <b>background</b> <b>music</b> vs. no <b>background.</b> Since the addition of <b>background</b> <b>music</b> does not impair BCI performance but is preferred by users, auditory (and perhaps other) BCIs should consider including it. Our study also indicates that auditory BCIs can be effective even if the auditory channel is simultaneously otherwise engaged...|$|R
40|$|This study investigates how <b>background</b> <b>music</b> {{influences}} {{learning with}} respect to three different theoretical approaches. Both the Mozart effect {{as well as the}} arousal-mood-hypothesis indicate that <b>background</b> <b>music</b> can potentially benefit learning outcomes. While the Mozart effect assumes a direct influence of <b>background</b> <b>music</b> on cognitive abilities, the arousal-mood-hypothesis assumes a mediation effect over arousal and mood. However, the seductive detail effect indicates that seductive details such as <b>background</b> <b>music</b> worsen learning. Moreover, as working memory capacity has a crucial influence on learning with seductive details, we also included the learner’s working memory capacity as a factor in our study. We tested 81 college students using a between-subject design with half of the sample listening to two pop songs while learning a visual text and the other half learning in silence. We included working memory capacity in the design as a continuous organism variable. Arousal and mood scores before and after learning were collected as potential mediating variables. To measure learning outcomes we tested recall and comprehension. We did not find a mediation effect between <b>background</b> <b>music</b> and arousal or mood on learning outcomes. In addition, for recall performance there were no main effects of <b>background</b> <b>music</b> or working memory capacity, nor an interaction effect of these factors. However, when considering comprehension we did find an interaction between <b>background</b> <b>music</b> and working memory capacity: the higher the learners’ working memory capacity, the better they learned with <b>background</b> <b>music.</b> This is in line with the seductive detail assumption...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} method for {{detecting}} and locating a known music signal in a long audio stream. Unlike existing methods, ours assumes that the music is used as <b>background</b> <b>music</b> (<b>BGM)</b> and overlapped by another sound such as speech and that the interfering sound is typically louder than the target music. The proposed method is based on Time-series Active Search, which is a quick signal search method reported earlier. To realize the BGM search, however, a novel extension is introduced. That is, the music signal is firstly decomposed {{into a number of}} small time-frequency regions, and the search is carried out for each of those com-ponents. The results of the search are then integrated based on a voting scheme to find the target music locations. Ex-periments show that accurate search is possible when SNR is- 5 dB and that the search completes in about 8 s for a 30 -m stored signal. 1...|$|E

Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 55 - 57 This {{study was}} designed to investigate to what extent familiar and unfamiliar <b>background</b> <b>music</b> might affect the reading comprehension performance of Turkish EFL learners in a university preparatory program. The present study also aimed at examining the possible differences in the reading comprehension performance of females and males. The present study was conducted in the Preparatory Department of the Faculty of Engineering and Architecture, Gazi University, Ankara, Turkey. Forty-two (15 female, 27 male) Turkish undergraduate intermediate-level subjects aged from 17 to 21 participated in this study. There were two research questions: (a) the effect of familiar and unfamiliar <b>background</b> <b>music</b> on reading comprehension performance, and (b) the effect of familiar and unfamiliar <b>background</b> <b>music</b> on reading comprehension performance of females and males. In order to investigate these research questions, three groups were formed: two experimental (familiar and unfamiliar <b>background</b> <b>music)</b> groups and one control (no-background music) group. All three groups took a pretest without <b>background</b> <b>music.</b> One week later, the experimental groups took a posttest with <b>background</b> <b>music</b> playing. The familiar <b>background</b> <b>music</b> group was familiarized with the pieces of music before the test began, whereas the unfamiliar <b>background</b> <b>music</b> group was not familiarized with the pieces of music. The control group did not have <b>background</b> <b>music.</b> Reading comprehension performance was measured by a test consisting of three reading passages, followed by 12 multiple-choice questions on the passages. Data were analyzed by one-way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to answer the first research question. Results showed that there was no statistically significant difference between the reading comprehension performance of familiar and unfamiliar <b>background</b> <b>music</b> groups. However, {{the results of this study}} indicate that subjects with <b>background</b> <b>music</b> (familiar or unfamiliar) showed statistically significant gains in their reading comprehension performance over the no-music control group from pretest to posttest, at p<. 01. For the second research question, a two-way analysis of covariance was employed. There was no statistically significant difference between the reading comprehension performance of females and males in the posttest among any of the groups. Gür, CanM. S...|$|R
40|$|As tantalizing as {{the idea}} that <b>background</b> <b>music</b> beneficially affects foreign {{vocabulary}} learning may seem, there is-partly {{due to a lack}} of theory-driven research-no consistent evidence to support this notion. We investigated inter-individual differences in the effects of <b>background</b> <b>music</b> on foreign vocabulary learning. Based on Eysenck's theory of personality we predicted that individuals with a high level of cortical arousal should perform worse when learning with <b>background</b> <b>music</b> compared to silence, whereas individuals with a low level of cortical arousal should be unaffected by <b>background</b> <b>music</b> or benefit from it. Participants were tested in a paired-associate learning paradigm consisting of three immediate word recall tasks, as well as a delayed recall task one week later. Baseline cortical arousal assessed with spontaneous EEG measurement in silence prior to the learning rounds was used for the analyses. Results revealed no interaction between cortical arousal and the learning condition (<b>background</b> <b>music</b> vs. silence). Instead, we found an unexpected main effect of cortical arousal in the beta band on recall, indicating that individuals with high beta power learned more vocabulary than those with low beta power. To substantiate this finding we conducted an exact replication of the experiment. Whereas the main effect of cortical arousal was only present in a subsample of participants, a beneficial main effect of <b>background</b> <b>music</b> appeared. A combined analysis of both experiments suggests that beta power predicts the performance in the word recall task, but that there is no effect of <b>background</b> <b>music</b> on foreign vocabulary learning. In light of these findings, we discuss whether searching for effects of <b>background</b> <b>music</b> on foreign vocabulary learning, independent of factors such as inter-individual differences and task complexity, might be a red herring. Importantly, our findings emphasize the need for sufficiently powered research designs and exact replications of theory-driven experiments when investigating effects of <b>background</b> <b>music</b> and inter-individual variation on task performanc...|$|R

40|$|In {{auditory}} health persuasion, threatening {{information regarding}} health is communicated by voice only. One relevant context of auditory persuasion is {{the addition of}} <b>background</b> <b>music.</b> There are different mechanisms through which <b>background</b> <b>music</b> might influence persuasion, for example through mood (Västfjäll, 2002) or distraction (Doyle & Furnham, 2012). Here, it is reasoned that music {{can be interpreted as}} a way to define one’s self-image (MacDonald, Hargreaves, & Miell, 2002). In the present study, {{the extent to which the}} <b>background</b> <b>music</b> matches the person’s perceived identity is manipulated. Via an online questionnaire four to six weeks prior to the actual experiment, students (N = 106) were asked to name a song they would or would not put on their personal weblog as characterizing them as a person. In addition, health value was assessed. If health is highly valued, respondents will focus on the content information, whereas <b>background</b> <b>music</b> might affect respondents who valued health as relatively low. In the laboratory, they listened to a health message, either accompanied by one of those self-mentioned pieces of music (positive / negative identification) or by no <b>background</b> <b>music.</b> First, <b>background</b> <b>music</b> leads to significantly higher self-reported distraction compared to the control condition. Furthermore, a significant interaction of condition × health value on intention showed that people with a relatively low health value reported a significantly lower intention when <b>background</b> <b>music</b> was added, which might be explained by the process of distraction. It is therefore recommended to apply <b>background</b> <b>music</b> carefully in auditory health education. ...|$|R
