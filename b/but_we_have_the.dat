25|$|In March 2014, {{the members}} of the Italian {{commission}} on human rights unanimously adopted a resolution calling for the immediate release of Falun Gong practitioners and other prisoners of conscience in China, and urging Italian hospitals to reconsider collaborations with China in the area of organ transplants. In 2015, the Italian Senate adopted a bill which makes it a crime to traffic in organs from living donors. Individuals found guilty of this offence could face 3–12 years in prison and fines of up to 300,000 Euros ($350,000 USD). Senator Maurizio Romani, one of the bill’s sponsors, noted that China performs the second highest number of transplants in the world, all without established procedures for organ donation or a national organ allocation system, and said that Falun Gong practitioners account for a significant portion of transplant organs. “We in Italy can’t stop these violations, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> duty to make any effort in order not to be accomplices to this,” he said.|$|E
500|$|After Alberta's {{two most}} {{prominent}} Liberals, Peter Talbot and Frank Oliver, {{made it clear}} that they were not interested, DeVeber considered himself as a possible candidate. [...] Less than two months before Alberta's formal creation, he wrote to his colleague in the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories, Alexander Cameron Rutherford, that the possibilities [...] "practically came to you and I, both of us weak enough God knows <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> sense to see it." [...] DeVeber's belief that he may be appointed premier does not appear to have been well-founded: his opposition to the introduction of party lines earned him the enmity of some Liberals, not least because it aligned him with Haultain, a Conservative. [...] In the estimation of historian L. G. Thomas, DeVeber's fellow Liberals [...] "were not inclined to take him too seriously" [...] as a potential premier.|$|E
2500|$|Few details remain {{regarding}} his life, {{aside from his}} published work, due {{to the destruction of}} El-Zahra during later Castillian-Andalusian conflicts. [...] His name first appears in the writings of Abu Muhammad bin Hazm (993 – 1064), who listed him among the greatest physicians of Moorish Spain. <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> first detailed biography of al-Zahrawī from al-Ḥumaydī's Jadhwat al-Muqtabis (On Andalusian Savants), completed six decades after al-Zahrawi's death.|$|E

2500|$|On {{his return}} to London, Froude announced, [...] "If anybody had told me {{two years ago that}} I should be leading an {{agitation}} within Cape Colony, I should have thought my informant delirious. The (Cape) Ministers have the appearance of victory, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> substance." [...] Froude's observations on Africa were presented in a Report to the Secretary of State and a series of lectures for the Philosophical Society of Edinburgh, both of which were adapted into essays for inclusion in Froude's essay collection Short Studies on Great Subjects.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{within the}} LDS Church, {{particularly}} Smith's contemporaries, have expressed {{the view that}} the endowment was given anciently by God in its original form at the Temple of Solomon, but that the form of the ritual degenerated into the form used by Freemasons. Heber C. Kimball clearly supported this position: [...] "We have the true Masonry. The Masonry of today is received from the apostasy which took place in the days of Solomon and David. They have now and then a thing that is correct, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> real thing" ...|$|E
2500|$|On 16 August 2015, Inter manager Roberto Mancini {{confirmed}} that the club was forced to sell Kovačić to Real Madrid due to Financial Fair Play regulations. Speaking during a press conference after a friendly against Greek club AEK Athens, Mancini stated, [...] "There are rules {{that have to be}} respected. I don't think anyone wanted this to happen <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> Financial Fair Play regulations to follow. We're all sorry about it: myself, the president, the management and the players themselves." [...] Real Madrid also confirmed the transfer two days later, announcing that Kovačić had signed a six-year deal with the club. The transfer fee was €29 million, according to the financial filing of Inter Milan, in the section Management Report (...) [...] On 19 August, Kovačić was unveiled as a new player by Real Madrid at the Santiago Bernabéu, where it was revealed he would wear the number 16 shirt for the club. Kovačić became the fifth Croatian player, after Robert Prosinečki, Davor Šuker, Robert Jarni and Luka Modrić, to join Real Madrid.|$|E
