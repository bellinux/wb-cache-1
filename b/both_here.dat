There are some kings that are not buried within the valley or whose tomb has not been located: Thutmose II may have been buried in Dra' Abu el-Naga' (although his mummy was in the Deir el-Bahri tomb cache), Smenkhkare's burial has never been located, and Ramesses VIII seems to have been buried elsewhere.|$|E

As the water began flowing, Halprin waded into the water, dressed in a jacket and tie.

He's the antithesis of Ramsay. They're almost a yin and a yang. They both come from such a similar place yet they're so different. And even though they're enemies, they've both risen so far as bastards, which is almost incomprehensible, and now they're <b>both</b> <b>here</b> facing each other. They couldn't be any more different, yet more similar." [...] In an interview, Harington talked about the fight scene with Rheon: [...] "I actually did punch Iwan in the face twice by accident, which he took really well. He was really nice about it." [...] According to Rheon, [...] "The way I see it, if you don't get hit a couple of times doing that, you're not doing it properly." ...|$|E

[...] "She had an apartment here and I had been seeking out some theater here in New York {{and would have been}} spending time <b>both</b> <b>here</b> and in L.A. So after we made the decision to go ahead with that game plan, this offer (Dimitri) came on the table and when we worked out all the figures moneywise it was a great opportunity." [...] Despite Nader's prime time success as Dynasty's Dex Dexter, he did not look down on daytime television. [...] "The {{fact of the matter is}} we're in a different era," [...] he said. [...] "And if you look at the cutbacks in Hollywood, being on a soap is not of any less or more value than being in any other medium at this time." [...] Another factor that contributed to his decision to join All My Children was the actors strike. He intended to stay on All My Children for a year. That year turned into more because the actor fell in love with New York.|$|E

2500|$|Giotto used {{tonality}} {{to create}} form. Taddeo Gaddi in his nocturnal {{scene in the}} Baroncelli Chapel demonstrated how light {{could be used to}} create drama. Paolo Uccello, a hundred years later, experimented with the dramatic effect of light in some of his almost monochrome frescoes.

The best known is his equestrian portrait of John Hawkwood on the wall of Florence Cathedral. <b>Both</b> <b>here</b> and on the four heads of prophets that he painted around the inner clockface in the cathedral, he used strongly contrasting tones, suggesting that each figure was being lit by a natural light source, as if the source was an actual window in the cathedral.|$|E

Georgescu had more ambitious goals: He wanted to overturn and replace the existing, but flawed, mainstream paradigm of neoclassical economics with his own 'bioeconomics' (see below); to downscale (degrow) the economy as soon as possible (see below); and not merely be relegated to some arcane and insignificant — so he believed — economics subdiscipline such as ecological economics.|$|E

For his part, Laarbi Maateis denied any involvement with fundamentalist movements, indicating that no member of Tablig had ever been arrested or identified as a suspect in connection with jihadism.

2500|$|Mr. Max Harris {{and other}} Angry Penguins writers {{represent}} an Australian outcrop {{of a literary}} fashion which has become prominent in England and America. The distinctive feature of the fashion, it seemed to us, was that it rendered its devotees insensible of absurdity and incapable of ordinary discrimination.

[...] However, {{it was possible that}} we had simply failed to penetrate to the inward substance of these productions. The only way of settling the matter was by way of experiment.
