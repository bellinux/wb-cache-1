5000|$|People have {{identified}} several dispositional and contextual factors {{that would affect}} team adaptive performance. The most obvious and natural predictor of team adaptive performance is characteristics of team members, or team composition. Team composition with respect to members' cognitive ability is positively associated with team adaptive performance, with a moderation effect of team goals. Teams with difficult goals and staffed with high-performance orientation members are especially unlikely to adapt. Teams with difficult goals and staffed with high-learning orientation members are especially likely to adapt. [...] Moreover, team members' self-leadership, conscientiousness, and attitudes could also influence team adaptive performance.Other factors are more related to interactions between team members and team environment, like team learning climate). [...] Among them coordination of team members has been {{proved to be a}} most influential factor. Teams' ability to adapt their coordination activities to changing situational demands is crucial to team performance. A stronger increase in the teams' adaptive coordination was found to be related to better performance. [...] Researchers have posited that the maintenance of coordinated effort and activities ("coordination maintenance") is necessary for high team adaptive performance. This is because even with well-adapted individual performance, workflow at the team level often becomes disrupted, [...] "overflowing" [...] in particular directions. Overflow may create excessive work demands for some team members, while encouraging social loafing among those who are in the ebb of the workflow (see social loafing). [...] This suggests that, although team members may have their own task <b>boundaries,</b> <b>and</b> <b>individual</b> adaptive performance may depend on each member's individual capabilities, however to the team, each employee's adaptive performance may result in successful completion of the team task only if all activities are coordinated and synchronized in a holistic fashion. Team learning climate also displays a significant, positive relationship with team adaptive performance.|$|E

Transition temperatures correlated well with phase <b>boundaries</b> <b>and</b> <b>individual</b> measurements published previously. Microstructural and diffraction analysis of melted specimens confirmed that ZrC existed in the liquid phase and resolidified to ZrC or a ZrC+graphite eutectic. Transition temperatures were insensitive to laser pulse timescale and repeated melting, and microstructures of melted surfaces {{were consistent with the}} phase diagram, indicating the local attainment of thermodynamic equilibrium. Subsurface nonequilibrium microstructures were attributed to thermal gradients with depth and solute partitioning during freezing. The present work indicates that pulsed laser heating is a viable technique for producing equilibrium microstructures in ZrC as a prerequisite for precision measurement of phase transition temperatures. The main source of uncertainty in reported temperatures was the estimation of ZrC emittance. A consistently observed discontinuous temperature decrease upon the solid–liquid phase transition indicated a decrease in the emittance of liquid ZrC with respect to solid ZrC. Based on an estimated emittance of solid ZrC of 0. 6, emittance of liquid ZrC was estimated at 0. 44 – 0. 58. JRC. E. 3 -Materials researc...|$|E

40|$|The {{findings}} of the current dissertation show that emotional displays in particular negative emotional displays bring individuals together when they share group membership, but drive individuals apart {{when they do not}} share group membership.

This book examines the role played by digital technology in both the exercise and suppression of human rights. The global digital environment has allowed us to reinterpret the concept of universal human rights. Discourse on human rights need no longer be limited by national or cultural <b>boundaries</b> <b>and</b> <b>individuals</b> have the ability to create new forms in which to exercise their rights or even to bypass national limitations to rights.

This book gathers together an international group of experts working within this rapidly developing area of law and technology and focuses their attantion on the specific interaction between human rights and digital technology. This is the first work to explore the challenges brought about by digital technology to fundamental freedoms such as privacy, freedom of expression, access, assembly and dignity.

40|$|CSIRO 2004 The recent {{proposal}} for {{a new system of}} biological taxonomy based primarily on DNA sequences from one or a few chosen ('standard') genes sequenced across all taxa appears inadvisable for both practical and theoretical reasons. While nucleotide sequences are more objective than traditional (e. g. morphological) data in some respects (character choice, character delineation, character state identity), in other respects both are inherently subjective (homology/alignment, divergence metrics). Sequence divergence in standard gene(s) is an extremely crude method for determining species limits; more appropriate markers (potentially directly linked to species criteria such as reproductive isolation) should be and often are used. It is thus worth persisting with the plurality of genetic, anatomical and ethological criteria currently used to hypothesise ('identify') <b>and</b> test species <b>boundaries.</b> However, once species boundaries have been thus discerned, use of sequences from standard genes to diagnose those <b>boundaries</b> (<b>and</b> place <b>individuals</b> with respect to those boundaries) is highly feasible, though subject to error like any single type of marker.

40|$|A {{central theme}} in Pauline Melville’s novel, The Ventriloquist’s Tale, is the {{question}} of endogamy and exogamy, with the opposing alternatives embodied in Melville’s characters. This theme has received much attention in the critical commentaries generated by the novel, with a prevailing number of critics claiming that Melville proposes endogamy as the only option for indigenous communities to remain intact. However, such an argument overlooks the significant fact that Melville’s characters are always already the offspring of exogamous encounters, through which a multiplicity of boundaries have been permeated. Furthermore, the spatial motifs developed in the novel can be seen to undermine commonly accepted delimitations of supposedly homogenous groups, the nation-state constituting the prime example, and this in turn profoundly alters the notion of mixing. Consequently, contending that Melville even enters a debate on endogamy and exogamy stems from a predisposition to see the world in other terms than those Melville sets out in her novel. The nature of <b>boundaries</b> <b>and</b> borders in Melville’s fictitious world are therefore explored using Benedict Anderson’s Imagined Communities as a framework. This examination shows that the novel undermines the notion of the nation-state as a homogenous entity and reveals a global structure that dictates and drives interaction on a global scale. Consequently, instead of a debate on exogamy, we see in the novel an exploration and dismantling of notions of borders, <b>boundaries</b> <b>and</b> barriers between <b>individuals</b> <b>and</b> groups of people...|$|R

These behaviours are probably related to the competition necessary to find enough food in the snow voles' challenging environment, and is in contrast to some other vole species living in more temperate climates.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the portrayal of}} outsiders in Michael Psellos's Chronographia, Anna Komnene's Alexiad, and Niketas Choniates's Narrative - using sociological theories of deviancy. The twofold aim is to "treat texts seriously", localized in Jakobson's speech-event nexus of addresser, context, content, contact, code and addressee; and secondly to understand the texts as statements of {{the ideology of the}} dominant elite. Outsiders are defined (using the labelling orientation) as people successfully defined as deviants; deviant behaviour is whatever they do. The dominant elite creates cultural <b>boundaries,</b> <b>and</b> places <b>individuals</b> in outsider roles {{on the other side of}} those boundaries. Outsiders can be understood only in terms of who defines them as deviant; there is no material reality to deviancy. Stereotypes, which identify social categories of people by evaluative trait-characteristics, are necessary elements of human cognition; they become prejudice only when they are over-generalized, based on too limited data, applied too widely and maintained in the face of contrary empirical evidence. The analysis of the three texts in depth allows the identification of those groups labelled as outsiders by these expositors of the dominant ideology. My conclusion is that these authors portray a picture of the Byzantine outsider, which is coherent between this limited sample group, allowing for individual variation. These authors used stereotypes to conceptualize and encode in the linguistic and lexicographical complexities of their texts the outsiders they identified in their societies. Their presentation uses stereotypes, but does not descend to prejudice...|$|R

5000|$|When {{calculating the}} size of any object type, the {{compiler}} {{must take into account}} any required data structure alignment to meet efficiency or architectural constraints. Many computer architectures do not support multiple-byte access starting at any byte address that is not a multiple of the word size, and even when the architecture allows it, usually the processor can fetch a word-aligned object faster than it can fetch an object that straddles multiple words in memory. [...] Therefore, compilers usually align data structures to at least a word <b>boundary,</b> <b>and</b> also align <b>individual</b> members to their respective boundaries. In the following example, the structure student is likely to be aligned on a word boundary, which is also where the member grade begins, and the member age is likely to start at the next word address. The compiler accomplishes the latter by inserting padding bytes between members as needed to satisfy the alignment requirements. There may also be padding {{at the end of a}} structure to ensure proper alignment in case the structure is used as an element of an array.|$|R
