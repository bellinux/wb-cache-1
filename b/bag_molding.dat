50|$|This {{process is}} related to vacuum <b>bag</b> <b>molding</b> {{in exactly the same}} way as it sounds. A solid female mold is used along with a {{flexible}} male mold. The reinforcement is placed inside the female mold with just enough resin to allow the fabric to stick in place (wet lay up). A measured amount of resin is then liberally brushed indiscriminately into the mold and the mold is then clamped to a machine that contains the male flexible mold. The flexible male membrane is then inflated with heated compressed air or possibly steam. The female mold can also be heated. Excess resin is forced out along with trapped air. This process is extensively used in the production of composite helmets due to the lower cost of unskilled labor. Cycle times for a helmet bag moulding machine vary from 20 to 45 minutes, but the finished shells require no further curing if the molds are heated.|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} about the {{mechanical}} design of structures for a small satellite of the CubeSat type. CubeSat frames are usually made of aluminum alloys, this study looks into the possibilities of using polymers and polymer based composites in a custom structural design for the NTNU test satellite (NUTS). This is done for the potential weight reductions of the structural framework and supporting structures. This can be beneficial also in other CubeSat project that has a thigh weight budget. The satellite will use backplane circuit board layout in contrast to common stacking using spacers. The design integrates these parts in the structural support. At {{the same time it}} aims to make a frame that is flexible and compatible with different layouts and internal components. The study also covers the component layout, general mechanical concept development and materials selection of the satellite primary and secondary structures. This includes integration of components like magnetorquers, solar cells, batterypack, antenna structures and small required components like launch deployment - switches and ?springs. The environment parameters and loads of the launch and orbit stages combined with requirements to CubeSats and spacecraft structures are reviewed. This entails the effect the environment has on polymers and polymer composite materials. In the launch phase this includes thermal changes, wear and friction and also quasi-static loads, vibrations and shocks. In the orbit environment it includes thermal changes, radiation, erosion, micrometeorites, outgassing and surface charging. These effects are considered in the further design and sizing of the structures. Relevant materials are suggested based on listed requirements, collected material properties recorded in space experiments and recommendations from standards. Issues with using composite and polymer materials in design of small structures are discussed. Structural analyses are researched and applied using FEM based analyses. Some advanced analysis methods were researched as tools to run response analysis in relation to shock and vibration loads and also orbit thermal loads. Work is also done looking at relevant production, prototyping and testing methods for the different structures. This has included vacuum <b>bagging,</b> press <b>molding</b> and milling of aerospace carbon/epoxy prepreg. The results of the study presents new design concepts for parts in the assembly, and some candidate materials like glass and carbon fiber reinforced epoxy, cyanate and bismaleimide resins. A detailed CAD model of the CubeSat concept assembly is produced along with drawings and prototypes of parts of the concept. The results of the FEM analysis show that the structure should support the defined loads using the current geometry and materials, some higher stressed areas were also identified. An advanced thermal model was built and its function is explained along with how to attain better results. The functions of setting up dynamic response analyses are also explained, to get satisfying results from these models more knowledge of the damping characteristics of the materials are needed. Modal analyses show responses of some parts, and how their natural frequencies can be increased. The main findings in designing with composites are challenges with fasteners and combinations with mixed material assemblies due to thermal expansion and galvanic corrosion. Issues in using polymer materials in a CubeSat is related to surface properties and wear effects during launch, and also the materials reaction to the space environment related effects.

40|$|Acoustic {{emission}} (AE) can be {{used for}} in situ structural health monitoring of composite laminates. One of the main issues of AE is to characterize the different damage mechanisms from the detected signals. With these aim, glass/epoxy cross-ply laminates, fabricated using vacuum <b>bag</b> <b>molding,</b> were subjected to uni-axial tensile test under AE monitoring. Matrix cracking, delamination and fiber failure were discerned by AE {{on the basis of their}} peak frequency content, these being between 90 and 110 kHz, 130 and 200 kHz and 250 and 280 kHz respectively: the overwhelming majority of signals appeared to be attributed to matrix cracking. To investigate further the strength of the single failure modes, a couple of signals (a “weak ” and a “strong ” one) with the same peak frequency have been selected for each damage mode. On these, multi-parameter analysis, FFT, Short Time FFT and Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) have been applied. The results showed that a considerable part of AE energy from signals associated with fiber fracture lies above 300 kHz and that matrix cracking can be associated with a much slower energy release than the other events...|$|E
40|$|Inkjet {{printing}} of electrode using copper nanoparticle ink is presented. Electrode was printed on a flexible glass epoxy composite substrate using drop on demand piezoelectric dispenser and was sintered at 200 °C in N 2 gas condition. The printed electrodes {{were made with}} various widths and thicknesses. Surface morphology of electrode was analyzed using scanning electron microscope (SEM) and atomic force microscope (AFM). Reliable dimensions for printed electronics were found from this study. 	Single-crystalline silicon solar cells were tested under four-point bending to find the feasibility of directly integrating them onto a carbon fiber/epoxy composite laminate. These solar cells {{were not able to}} withstand 0. 2 % strain. On the other hand, thin-film amorphous silicon solar cells were subjected to flexural fatigue loadings. The current density-voltage curves were analyzed at different cycles, and there was no noticeable degradation on its performance up to 100 cycles. A multifunctional composite laminate which can harvest and store solar energy was fabricated using printed electrodes. The integrated printed circuit board (PCB) was co-cured with a carbon/epoxy composite laminate by the vacuum <b>bag</b> <b>molding</b> process in an autoclave; an amorphous silicon solar cell and a thin-film solid state lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery were adhesively joined and electrically connected to a thin flexible PCB; and then the passive components such as resistors and diodes were electrically connected to the printed circuit board by silver pasting. Since a thin-film solid state Li-ion battery was not able to withstand tensile strain above 0. 4 %, thin Li-ion polymer batteries were tested under various mechanical loadings and environmental conditions to find the feasibility of using the polymer batteries for our multifunctional purpose. It was found that the Li-ion polymer batteries were stable under pressure and tensile loading without any noticeable degradation on its charge and discharge performances. Also, the active materials did not decompose at 80 °C, and the battery was performing well under low temperature of - 27 °C. Lastly, the batteries were embedded inside a carbon fiber/epoxy composite laminate to characterize their performance under fatigue loading. Finally, an intense pulsed light (IPL) was used to sinter printed silver nanoink patterns. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to find grain size of printed silver nanoink patterns. From these analyses it was confirmed that IPL is able to adequately sinter silver nanoink patterns for printed electronics without degradation of the substrates in less than 30 ms...|$|E
40|$|The work {{presented}} in this report summarizes the current state-of-the-art in on-board storage on compressed gaseous hydrogen {{as well as the}} development of analysis tools, methods, and theoretical data for devising high performance design configurations for hydrogen storage. The state-of-the-art in the area of compressed hydrogen storage reveals that the current configuration of the hydrogen storage tank is a seamless cylindrical part with two end domes. The tank is composed of an aluminum liner overwrapped with carbon fibers. Such a configuration was proved to sustain internal pressures up to 350 bars (5, 000 psi). Finite-element stress analyses were performed on filament-wound hydrogen storage cylindrical tanks under the effect of internal pressure of 700 bars (10, 000 psi). Tank deformations, stress fields, and intensities induced at the tank wall were examined. The results indicated that the aluminum liner can not sustain such a high pressure and initiate the tank failure. Thus, hydrogen tanks ought to be built entirely out of composite materials based on carbon fibers or other innovative composite materials. A spherical hydrogen storage tank was suggested within the scope of this project. A stress reduction was achieved by this change of the tank geometry, which allows for increasing the amount of the stored hydrogen and storage energy density. The finite element modeling of both cylindrical and spherical tank design configurations indicate that the formation of stress concentration zones {{in the vicinity of the}} valve inlet as well as the presence of high shear stresses in this area. Therefore, it is highly recommended to tailor the tank wall design to be thicker in this region and tapered to the required thickness in the rest of the tank shell. Innovative layout configurations of multiple tanks for enhanced conformability in limited space have been proposed and theoretically modeled using 3 D finite element analysis. Optimum tailoring of fiber orientations and lay-ups are needed to relieve the high stress in regions of high stress concentrations between intersecting tanks/ tank sections. Filament winding process is the most suitable way for producing both cylindrical and spherical hydrogen storage tanks with high industrial quality. However, due to the unavailability of such equipment at West Virginia University and limited funding, the composite structures within this work were produced by hand layup and <b>bag</b> <b>molding</b> techniques. More advanced manufacturing processes can significantly increase the structural strength of the tank and enhances its performance and also further increase weight saving capabilities. The concept of using a carbon composite liner seems to be promising in overcoming the low strength of the aluminum liner at internal high pressures. This could be further enhanced by using MetPreg filament winding to produce such a liner. Innovative designs for the polar boss of the storage tanks and the valve connections are still needed to reduce the high stress formed in these zones to allow for the tank to accommodate higher internal pressures. The Continuum Damage Mechanics (CDM) approach was applied for fault-tolerant design and efficient maintenance of lightweight automotive structures made of composite materials. Potential effects of damage initiation and accumulation are formulated for various design configurations, with emphasis on lightweight fiber-reinforced composites. The CDM model considers damage associated with plasticity and fatigue...|$|E
