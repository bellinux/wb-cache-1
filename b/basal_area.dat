5|$|Because its {{coloration}} {{is similar}} to Bendire's thrasher, the two birds are easily mistaken for one another. The bill of the curve-billed is all black, while that of Bendire's is paler down to the lower mandible, showing a dark grey with a <b>basal</b> <b>area</b> that does not feature a stark contrast. The upper and lower mandibles of the curve-billed are curved, while the upper is curved and lower is essentially straight for the Bendires'. Although geographic variances for the curve-billed can make discerning breast patterns difficult, the curve-billed {{has a tendency to}} display larger and rounder spots overall on its breast, in contrast to the Bendires' smaller, more pronounced markings shaped like arrowheads. However, curve-billed thrashers can also present this feature. Bendires' typically have yellow eyes while curve-billed eyes are typically orange, but Bendires' can have variations that appear yellow-orange while some curve-billed eyes are red-orange, yellow-orange, or yellow. The curve-billed is heavier and is more likely to inhabit suburban regions; Bendires' are likely to avoid dense vegetation such as mesquite and prefers open grassland with scattered yucca or around hedgegrows in agricultural areas. The song call of Bendire's is said to be more melodic and continuous with a chuck, while the curve-billed is known for its whit-wheet calls.|$|E
25|$|Methods used {{to measure}} forest {{productivity}} are more diverse than those of grasslands. Biomass increment based on stand specific allometry plus litterfall is considered a suitable although incomplete accounting of above-ground net primary production (ANPP). Field measurements used {{as a proxy for}} ANPP include annual litterfall, diameter or <b>basal</b> <b>area</b> increment (DBH or BAI), and volume increment.|$|E
25|$|At {{the highest}} {{elevations}} is dwarf forest, a dense forest {{as short as}} , on saturated soils.

Ascending the Luquillo Mountains through these forest types, the average tree height and diameter, number of tree species, and <b>basal</b> <b>area</b> (cross sectional area of tree stems) tend to decrease, while stem density increases.|$|E
30|$|We {{acknowledge}} {{differences in}} the original <b>basal</b> <b>areas</b> {{of the three groups}} of plots selected for this study (old-growth, HRBA and LRBA). However, to reach the expected residual <b>basal</b> <b>areas</b> proposed by Donoso (2002) for uneven-aged silviculture in Chilean forests, within legal restrictions, we had to choose these partially cut stands that are common in the landscape. From there, rather than from pristine old-growth forests, we sought to find out how selection stands do, or do not, maintain old-growth attributes.|$|R
5|$|The P. rebeli {{are noted}} for their large blue wings, with the males {{displaying}} a violet blue shade and the females displaying blue <b>basal</b> <b>areas</b> interspersed with brown spots, {{similar to other}} butterflies in its genus. The undersides of the butterfly are a dark brown with small black spots that are circled in white. It can be distinguished from its close relative, the P. alcon, by the broader black margins of the upperside male and the extensive blue <b>basal</b> <b>areas</b> in the females. It has a wingspan of approximately 32–36mm.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 21.5 mm. The ground colour of the forewings is brownish cream, suffused with brown in the dorsal and <b>basal</b> <b>areas.</b> The hindwings are brownish cream.|$|R
25|$|Upperside black, densely irrorated {{with green}} scales. Forewing: an {{outwardly}} oblique, slightly concave subbasal band and a narrow terminal edging jet-black {{due to the}} ground colour there being devoid of the green scaling; beyond the subbasal band the irroration of scales a much brighter green, especially along {{the outer edge of}} the subbasal band itself; but along obscure, broad and convergent discal and postdiscal transverse bands and along a subterminal much narrower band, the green scaling thins out and the black ground colour of the wing shows through; in some specimens, owing to the transparency of the wings, the rich ochraceous-brown colour of the underside gives the black on these bands a reddish tint. Hindwing: <b>basal</b> <b>area</b> margined outwardly by a narrow irregularly sinuous band devoid of green scaling, succeeded by an upper discal bright chrome-yellow patch that spreads from base of interspace 3 across the apex of the cell and bases of interspaces 4 and 5 to the costa; this patch is bluntly angulated outwards in interspace 5, stained with orange anteriorly and bordered outwardly by black which is widest above; below the patch a white line extends to the dorsum; the postdiscal area is deep dark green, margined inwardly by diffuse dark grey and followed outwardly by a subterminal series of lunular markings, the tornal and upper two or three of which are yellow, the rest bright green; tail tipped with yellow. Underside: <b>basal</b> <b>area</b> of both forewings and hindwings densely covered with green scales. Forewing: terminal two-thirds rich ochraceous brown, the green of the <b>basal</b> <b>area</b> bordered by black; discal and postdiscal bands also black, widened and diffusely coalescent posteriorly; an incomplete, very slender subterminal black line and broader black terminal edging, neither of which reaches to the apex. Hindwing much as on the upperside, but the yellow marking broader. Antennae dark red; head, thorax and abdomen black, covered somewhat densely with green hairs and scales.|$|E
25|$|Growth and yield- Pignut hickory often grows 24 to 27 m (80 to 90ft) {{tall and}} {{occasionally}} reaches 37m (120ft), with d.b.h. of 91 to 122cm (36 to 48 in). The bole is often forked. Height and diameter by age {{are shown in}} table 1 for selected locations. Diameter growth of pignut hickory (along with chestnut oak, white oak, sweet birch (Betula lenta), and American beech is rated slow. Since hickories constitute 15 percent or less of the <b>basal</b> <b>area</b> of oak-hickory forest types, most growth and yield information is written in terms of oak rather than oak-hickory. Yields of mixed oak stands (5,7,19) and of hickory stands (2) have been reported. Tree volume tables are available (2,19).|$|E
25|$|Hickories are {{consistently}} {{present in the}} broad eastern upland climax forest association commonly called oak-hickory, {{but they are not}} generally abundant (18). Locally, hickories may make up to 20 to 30 percent of stand <b>basal</b> <b>area,</b> particularly in slope and cove forests below the escarpment of the Cumberland Plateau (23) and in second-growth forests in the Cumberland Mountains, especially on benches (14). It has been hypothesized that hickory will replace chestnut (Castanea dentata) killed by the blight (Cryphonectria parasitica) in the Appalachian Highlands (10,12). On Beanfield Mountain in Giles County, Virginia, the former chestnut-oak complex has changed to an oak-hickory association over a period of 50 years. This association is dominated by pignut hickory with an importance value of 41.0 (maximum value = 300), northern red oak (36.0), and chestnut oak (25.0). White oak, red maple (Acer rubrum), and sugar maple are subdominant species.|$|E
50|$|The {{length of}} the {{forewings}} is 26-28 mm. The forewings are dark, with a pattern of wavy dark stripes. The <b>basal</b> <b>areas</b> are uniform grey. The hindwings are dark grey.|$|R

30|$|In particular, {{very large}} and {{emergent}} trees were far less numerous in the managed plots. Similarly, numerous other {{studies have found that}} stands managed through selection cutting have less large trees than comparable old-growth stands (e.g. Torras and Saura 2008; Rüger et al. 2007; Keeton 2006; Angers et al. 2005; Crow et al. 2002). Furthermore, stands with lower residual <b>basal</b> <b>areas</b> were found to present less large trees than stands with higher residual <b>basal</b> <b>areas</b> (Gronewold et al. 2010; Rüger et al. 2007). This is partly consistent with {{the findings of this study}} where only LRBA plots presented significantly lower numbers of large and very large diameter trees than the control plots.|$|R
25|$|The various {{movements}} of the wings, especially in insects that flex their wings horizontally over their backs when at rest, demand a more complicated articular structure at the wing base than a mere hinge of the wing with the body. Each wing {{is attached to the}} body by a membranous <b>basal</b> <b>area,</b> but the articular membrane contains a number of small articular sclerites, collectively known as the pteralia. The pteralia include an anterior humeral plate {{at the base of the}} costal vein, a group of axillaries (Ax) associated with the subcostal, radial, and vannal veins, and two less definite median plates (m, m') at the base of the mediocubital area. The axillaries are specifically developed only in the wing-flexing insects, where they constitute the flexor mechanism of the wing operated by the flexor muscle arising on the pleuron. Characteristic of the wing base is also a small lobe on the anterior margin of the articular area proximal to the humeral plate, which, in the forewing of some insects, is developed into a large, flat, scale-like flap, the tegula, overlapping the base of the wing. Posteriorly, the articular membrane often forms an ample lobe between the wing and the body, and its margin is generally thickened and corrugated, giving the appearance of a ligament, the so-called axillary cord, continuous mesally with the posterior marginal scutellar fold of the tergal plate bearing the wing.|$|E

The understory showed greater species richness in the forest interior, but greater diversity and equitability in the intermediate environment. Understory environments close to the forest edge demonstrated larger stem diameters than in the forest interior, although at lesser densities and with smaller total <b>basal</b> <b>areas.</b> Our results indicated the existence of distinct patterns in canopy and understory that most likely reflect differences in the response times of these two vegetation layers, with the understory being more sensitive to alterations in environmental structure...|$|R
