40|$|Context and Motivation] Business {{modeling}} is nowadays {{a common}} approach in huge enterprise software developments. It notably allows to align business processes and supporting IT solutions at best, {{to produce a}} documentation of the company’s "savoir-faire" and to look for possible optimizations. The business modeling discipline of the Rational Unified Process (RUP) has enriched the semantic of the Unified Modeling Language’s (UML) <b>use</b> <b>case</b> diagrams for the special purpose of representing the organization’s processes with accurate elements. [Question/Problem] RUP/UML <b>business</b> <b>use</b> <b>case</b> scemantics are nevetheless only intended to further stereotype <b>use</b> <b>case</b> models {{and not to be}} used for reasoning. In parallel and in line with artificial intelligence concepts, researchers have developed the i* framework enabling the evaluation and decomposition of multiple design opportunities. RUP/UML <b>business</b> <b>use</b> <b>case</b> semantics could be used more efficiently to integrate the latter benefits. [Principal ideas/results] Through a systematic mapping of elements from i* on the one side and of the RUP/UML <b>business</b> <b>use</b> <b>case</b> model on the other, we have set up a RUP/UML graphical notation for i* elements. Applicability has been shown on an illustrative example. [Contribution] The main contribution of the framework is allowing to model in an i* fashion using CASE-tools meant for RUP/UML and proposing an interface for forward engineering the produced model in a classical UML requirements model. Future work is required to fully validate the proposal, notably to measure the method’s efficacy. status: publishe...|$|R

But despite the apparent advantages of mobile information delivery, mobile BI is still in the ‘early adopter’ phase.

40|$|Context and Motivation: The <b>Business</b> <b>Use</b> <b>Case</b> Model (BUCM) formalized in the Rational Unified Process (RUP) defines {{stereotypes}} of elements refining the UML <b>Use</b> <b>Case</b> Model for coarse-grained business processes modeling (BPM). The Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) Business Process Diagram (BPD) {{is designed for}} workflow based (i. e. fine-grained) BPM. These are frameworks that can possibly be complementary for enterprise modeling. Question/Problem: The semantically richer BPMN BPD can be used instead of UML activity diagrams for operational BPM when the BUCM is used for tactical BPM. Principal ideas/results: The common use of the BUCM and BPMN BPD requires anchoring of elements in between the frameworks to ensure traceability. Traceable models increase their overall consistency.

Automatic service discovery, dynamic service composition and process adaptability will bring SOA to its full potential. The integrated research project “Adaptive Services Grid ” realizes a platform providing such automation functionalities based on semantics. Enhancing SOA with semantics has a massive impact on the development methodology for the overall system. In this paper a <b>business</b> <b>use</b> <b>case</b> for dynamic supply chains demonstrates how to disentangle the interdependencies between service identification, WSDL interface descriptions and their semantic specifications. The paper shows a step-by-step approach for developing such applications on top of adaptive service-oriented architectures.

In Natural Language Processing, {{more complex}} <b>business</b> <b>use</b> <b>cases</b> and shorter {{delivery}} times drive a growing need of smoother, more flexible and faster implementations.

In a previous work we presented the Information and Knowledge Management Framework (MGIC), a methodology {{for building a}} model to serve as basis {{for the implementation of}} integrated information {{and knowledge}} systems that support business intelligence in public organizations. The first step of this methodology consists on building an integrated model, based in well-known modeling techniques, such as <b>Business</b> <b>Use</b> <b>Case</b> models and class models, which focus on the representation of the main business requirements and services provided by the organization. In this paper we discuss how such model is used to guide the requirements specification and development of new IT systems or the evolution of legacy systems...|$|R

40|$|Organizing vision {{theory is}} an {{institutional}} {{alternative to the}} economic-rationality view of IT innovation diffusion. Institutional theorists have called for more attention to cognitive processes and structures {{in order to understand}} institutional mechanisms. Our objective was to unpack the cognitive structure of an organizing vision to understand its role in the diffusion of IT innovations. We focus on the know-why component of organizing visions and on social media as an IT innovation. In a two-stage study, Stage I leveraged schema theory, the “orders of worth ” framework’s six justificatory principles, and relational class analysis to discover the hierarchical structure of the social media organizing vision. This resulted in a view of the organizing vision as comprised of four schemas, which we conceptualized as visions-in-use, and ten nested <b>business</b> <b>use</b> <b>cases,</b> each comprised of different combinations of the six principles. Based on this understanding, Stage II explored how community appropriations of visions-in-use and <b>business</b> <b>use</b> <b>cases</b> from the repertoire provided by an organizing vision shape four facets of an organizing vision—coherence, continuity, clarity, and diversity—and how these facets influence diffusion of the IT innovation. We found that the two vision facets we surfaced— clarity and diversity—are essential to understanding diffusion and how and why coherence and continuity matter to diffusion. Much as the “vision ” of a musical jam session emerges from players ’ multivocal performances, an organizing vision emerges from community members ’ multivocal discourse about an I...|$|E

40|$|A {{scenario}} {{can be used}} {{to describe}} a possible instantiation of a given <b>business</b> <b>use</b> <b>case</b> and can be expressed for example as a list of steps written in natural language, or by an interaction diagram. This paper discusses how a collection of scenarios, all expressed as UML 2 sequence diagrams, can be described for validation purposes by a single model, written in the Coloured Petri Nets (CPN) modelling language. Due to the support for parallelism given by the CPN language, the obtained CPN model can: (1) simultaneously execute several scenarios; and (2) elegantly represent the parallel activities inside a scenario. This two-level parallelism is crucial during validation, since it allows one to detect problems that are only evident when several scenarios are in simultaneous execution and may affect each other. We exemplify our approach in a system that has a rich set of interactions with its users.

It also suggests how forums can be fun for both students and the tutor and identifies the pleasures and pitfalls especially when dealing with international students. Many international students come into mainstream programmes in New Zealand with little or no experience of <b>business.</b> <b>Using</b> <b>case</b> studies with focussed questions enables the students to see how communication functions in a business. The benefits to all students include the need to make decisions about communication and to justify those decisions. For this reason case studies are commonly used in education. During class discussions, international students tend to be reluctant speakers because of their lack of experience or language skills. Online forums give students time to think before responding and also move control of the discussion to the students. The effectiveness of this learning method has been well established in distance learning and can be successfully implemented in blended delivery of classes. Online forums also encourage a social interaction between international and domestic students which helps to create a positive class culture. The success or failure of online forums depends on many factors including set up, tutor presence and perceived value of the experience.
