5|$|As the Britannia Restaurant {{takes up}} the full width of the ship on two decks, a 'tween deck, called Deck 3L, was devised to allow {{passengers}} to walk from the Grand Lobby to the Queen's Room without traversing the dining room mid-meal. The deck consists of two corridors that run beneath the upper <b>balcony</b> <b>of</b> the restaurant on Deck 3, and above the main dining area on Deck 2. This is why the <b>balcony</b> <b>of</b> the Britannia has tiers that step up towards the hull. This arrangement is illustrated on the hull {{where there is a}} stack of three rows of windows in the area where the main restaurant sits, the two upper and lower most rows illuminate the dining room, while the centre row serves Deck 3L. There is a similar arrangement through the Royal Court Theatre. As well, the passages that run on either side of Illuminations on Deck 3 ramp upwards to compensate for the change in deck elevation between the entrance to Illuminations and an elevator bank forward of the room.|$|E

The fan was arrested, served 15days in jail, and fined fifty dollars for damaging the fire extinguisher. The hip injury left Costello unable to wrestle, and The Fabulous Kangaroos split up once again. Costello had a full hip replacement and was forced to retire from active competition.|$|E
5|$|The {{essential}} elements of the coronation have remained largely unchanged for the past thousand years. The sovereign is first presented to, and acclaimed by, the people. He or she then swears an oath to uphold {{the law and the}} Church. Following that, the monarch is anointed with holy oil, invested with regalia, and crowned, before receiving the homage of his or her subjects. Wives of kings are then anointed and crowned as queen consort. The service ends with a closing procession, and since the 20th century it has been traditional for the royal family to appear later on the <b>balcony</b> <b>of</b> Buckingham Palace, before attending a banquet there.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} {{afternoon}} of 3 May, the niece {{of the woman who}} lived directly above the McCanns was sitting on her aunt's balcony, when she saw a man leave through the gate below, as though he had come out of a ground-floor apartment. What caught her attention was that he looked around before shutting the gate quietly, with both hands. At 14:30 two blonde-haired men were seen on the <b>balcony</b> <b>of</b> 5C, an empty apartment two doors from 5A. At 16:00–17:00 a blonde-haired man was seen near 5A. At 18:00 the same or another blonde-haired man was seen in the stairwell of the McCanns' block. At 23:00, after the disappearance, two blonde-haired men were seen in a nearby street speaking in raised voices. When they realized they had been noticed, they reportedly lowered their voices and walked away.|$|E
5|$|SS-Untersturmführer (second lieutenant) Amon Göth {{arrives in}} Kraków to oversee {{construction}} of Płaszów concentration camp. When {{the camp is}} completed, he orders the ghetto liquidated. Many people are shot and killed {{in the process of}} emptying the ghetto. Schindler witnesses the massacre and is profoundly affected. He particularly notices a tiny girl in a red coat – one of the few splashes of color in the black-and-white film – as she hides from the Nazis, and later sees her body (identifiable by the red coat) among those on a wagon load of corpses. Schindler is careful to maintain his friendship with Göth and, through bribery and lavish gifts, continues to enjoy SS support. Göth brutally mistreats his Jewish maid Helen Hirsch and randomly shoots people from the <b>balcony</b> <b>of</b> his villa, and the prisoners are in constant fear for their lives. As time passes, Schindler's focus shifts from making money to trying to save as many lives as possible. To better protect his workers, Schindler bribes Göth into allowing him to build a sub-camp.|$|E

40|$|In case of fire in an atrium, smoke {{produced}} {{is recognized}} as one of the major hazards for the occupants because of open spaces present in an atrium. The effect of varying the down stand depth at fire compartment on smoke contamination in upper <b>balconies</b> <b>of</b> an atrium has been investigated in this paper. Correlation to predict the smoke contamination in upper <b>balconies</b> <b>of</b> an atrium in the presence of 0. 5 m deep down stand structure has also been developed. This correlation is compared with correlations developed for 1 m deep down stand and without down stand structure by past research. The comparison results showed that when the depth of down stand structure increase, smoke contamination in upper <b>balconies</b> <b>of</b> an atrium also increases. The results also showed that smoke contamination in upper <b>balconies</b> <b>of</b> an atrium decreases when the ratio of w/d increases. The comparison of correlations from 1 m and 0. 5 m deep down stand showed that the difference in smoke contamination increases when w/d < 3. By comparing the correlations from 0. 5 m deep down stand and no down stand, there is very small difference in smoke contamination from both case but it is applicable for w/d < 3...|$|R
