40|$|Purpose: To {{describe}} {{the use of}} a new, frosted Jones Pyrex tube in the treatment of obstructed canaliculi of the upper lacrimal system. The frosted Jones tube retains the advantages of the traditional smooth Pyrex tube yet appears to improve the positional stability in the surgically created fistula. Methods: Ten patients of a single surgeon who had previously undergone external conjunctivodacryocystorhinostomy and placement of a Jones Pyrex tube, with subse-quent Pyrex tube extrusion, were included in the study. All had previous success with Pyrex tubes, with follow-up ranging from 1 month to 14 years. In each case, when the patient presented with <b>an</b> <b>extruded</b> <b>tube,</b> it was replaced with a frosted Jones tube (Weiss Scientific Glass Blowing Company, Portland, OR, U. S. A.). Results: In this preliminary study, none of the 10 patients fitted with a frosted Jones Pyrex tube had a recurrence of extrusion. All patients reported proper function-ing of the tubes, with no complaints of epiphora or discomfort. Conclusions: Compared with a standard Jones Pyrex tube, a frosted tube functions equally well and reduces the possibility of extrusion, which is the main complicatio...|$|R

40|$|Mild {{detonating fuse}} is <b>an</b> <b>extruded</b> {{aluminum}} <b>tube</b> that contains explosive material. Fuse prepared {{by a new}} supplier (Company B) exhibited a formability problem and was analyzed to determine the source of that formability problem. The formability problem was associated with cracking of the aluminum tube when it was bent around a small radius. Mild detonating fuse prepared by the existing supplier of product (Company A) did not exhibit a formability problem. The two fuses were prepared using different aluminum alloys. The microstructure and chemical composition of the two aluminum alloys were compared. It {{was found that the}} microstructure of the Company A aluminum exhibited clear signs of dynamic recrystallization while the Company B aluminum did not. Recrystallization results in the removal of dislocations associated with work hardening and will dramatically improve formability. Comparison of the chemical composition of the two aluminum alloys revealed that the Company A aluminum contained significantly lower levels of impurity elements (specifically Fe and Si) than the COMPANY B aluminum. It has been concluded that the formability problem exhibited by the COMPANY B material will be solved by using an aluminum alloy with low impurity content such as 1190 -H 18 or 1199 - 0...|$|R
40|$|Background: The authors {{previously}} reported {{a new technique}} with which to delineate the lymphatic vessels, using hydrogen peroxide to identify them and a lead oxide suspension to demonstrate them on radiographs. This technique provided excellent studies of the lymph vessels in human cadavers, {{but there was still}} room for improvement. Methods: Lymph collecting vessels run superficially in some regions, where they may be damaged while the surgeon is attempting to find them. Vessels smaller than 0. 3 mm in diameter could not be cannulated with a 30 -gauge needle, which was the smallest the authors had available, and the lead oxide suspension often blocked this cannula. The authors also encountered problems holding the cannula steady. Results: The authors solved these problems by using a mixture of hydrogen peroxide and ink to better identify the lymphatics, <b>an</b> <b>extruded</b> glass <b>tube</b> instead of a metal needle to cannulate them, an agate pestle and mortar to grind the lead oxide into finer particles, powdered milk to suspend the lead oxide, and a micromanipulator to facilitate accurate and steady cannulation of the vessels. Conclusion: This study developed these modifications to focus on tributaries of the collecting lymphatic channels that are smaller than 0. 3 mm in diameter. 7 page(s...|$|R
40|$|We {{discuss the}} pulling force f {{required}} to <b>extrude</b> <b>a</b> lipid <b>tube</b> from a living cell {{as a function}} of the extrusion velocity L̇. The main feature is membrane friction on the cytoskeleton. As recently observed for neutrophils, the tether force exhibits a “shear thinning” response over a large range of pulling velocities, which was previously interpreted by assuming viscoelastic flows of the sliding membrane. Here, we propose an alternative explanation based on purely Newtonian flow: The diameter of the tether decreases concomitantly with the increase of the membrane tension in the lipid tube. The pulling force is found to vary as L̇ 13, which is consistent with reported experimental data for various types of cells...|$|R
40|$|Very little {{experimental}} {{information is}} available in the open literature about condensation inside minichannels. Most of the experimental work has been carried out by using the Wilson plot technique. This method is simple to implement because it does not require the direct measurement of the tube wall temperature. However it becomes inaccurate when a small thermal resistance is present on the test side as compared to the opposite (cooling) side, which is actually the case with a multichannel tube at high values of the internal heat transfer coefficient. In fact, in a multi-port tube internal webs work as fins, and their efficiency is close to unity; thus the internal heat transfer area is higher than the external one. In this paper a new technique to measure the heat transfer coefficient during condensation inside <b>a</b> multi-port <b>extruded</b> minichannel <b>tube</b> is presented.

50|$|In {{most cases}} an optical {{triangulation}} sensor is mounted {{near the top}} of the swinging door frame, inside <b>a</b> long <b>extruded</b> aluminum <b>tube</b> with <b>an</b> optical window facing the floor. An 880 nm LED light source emits a collimated light beam that is emitted from the sensor, bounces off the floor and is received by a photodiode positioned adjacent to the LED source. A second photodiode (or a linear array of photodiodes) is positioned farther along the length of the sensor. When the emitted beam bounces off the floor, the reflected energy is almost exclusively concentrated on the first adjacent photodiode. When a human or object moves into the optical path, the reflected beam bounces back from the object. Since the beam is no longer traveling the full optical path length to the floor, its reflected angle changes. One of the adjacent photodiodes then receives the optical energy and the sensor responds by sending a signal to the automatic door controller. At that point the door stops, slows or reverses, hence averting a collision and providing safety.|$|R
