5|$|Shay {{was found}} dead in a Kansas City hotel room on December 1, 1927. He was found with a gunshot wound to the head. Police {{officials}} initially said that the manner of death could have been either suicide or murder. Shay stayed in his room on the day that he died. A porter went to check on him that evening and found him on the floor with a pistol a few inches from his right hand. When physicians examined Shay's body, they found that a bullet had entered the right ear and exited the back of the head. Shay had lost the use of his right arm and hand after a stroke. Police said that if Shay were holding the gun in his left hand, it would not have <b>been</b> <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> him to shoot himself in {{the right side of the}} head.|$|E

25|$|The {{direct cause}} of the {{accident}} is presumed to be {{the collapse of the}} vertical stabilizer. There are two alternative explanations for how the crash may have happened. The first explanation is that the lack of vertical control caused by the broken elevator torque tube stalled the aircraft. Be{{cause of the}} lack of pitch control, it would have <b>been</b> <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> the aircraft to fall back into a stall repeatedly, each time losing altitude. The aircraft would thus eventually have fallen into the sea. The vertical fin and rudder would have broken off on impact. This theory does not explain why the vertical stabilizer was found at such a distance from the aircraft.|$|E

25|$|At {{the end of}} the 109th Congress, the Gang of 14 deal expired. On November 7, 2006, the Democrats retook {{control in}} the 110th Congress. Starting in January 2007, they possessed a 51-49 {{majority}} in the Senate. As the new Senate majority, the Democrats easily blocked several conservative appellate judicial nominees without resorting to the filibuster. Conservative appellate nominees like Peter Keisler, Robert J. Conrad and Steve A. Matthews were blocked in committee and never given a hearing. If a Supreme Court justice had chosen to retire during the 110th Congress, it would have <b>been</b> <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> the Democrats to have blocked his proposed replacement in committee, or even by a party-line vote on the Senate floor, if it somehow came to that. As it developed, no Supreme Court justice retired or died during the 110th Congress.|$|E
25|$|Cicero {{wanted to}} pursue a public career in {{politics}} along {{the steps of the}} Cursus honorum. In 90 BC–88 BC, he served both Gnaeus Pompeius Strabo and Lucius Cornelius Sulla as they campaigned in the Social War, though he had no taste for military life, being an intellectual first and foremost. Cicero started his career as a lawyer around 83–81 BC. His first major case, of which a written record is still extant, was his 80 BC defense of Sextus Roscius on the charge of patricide. Taking this case was a courageous move for Cicero; patricide was considered an appalling crime, and the people whom Cicero accused of the murder, the most notorious being Chrysogonus, were favorites of Sulla. At this time it would have <b>been</b> <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> Sulla to have the unknown Cicero murdered. Cicero's defense was an indirect challenge to the dictator Sulla, and on the strength of his case, Roscius was acquitted.|$|E

500|$|As with {{previous}} Myst games, the visuals and interactivity of Revelation were {{singled out as}} the strongest features. Reviewers praised the use of subtle animations to bring the scenery to life; GameSpot's Greg Kasavin stated that the additions [...] "truly helps make each scene in the game seem like {{more than just a}} panoramic picture, and instead it feels like a real place". Jack Wall's score and the sound design were consistently praised. The addition of the in-game camera and notes system was also positively received.

500|$|Membership {{of the new}} House of Commons was {{overwhelmingly}} made up of pro-coalition MPs, {{and there}} was therefore {{a large number of}} eligible members for the government posts to be filled. In Dutton's phrase, [...] "it would have <b>been</b> <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> Dunglass to have languished indefinitely in backbench obscurity". However, Skelton, appointed as Under-secretary at the Scottish Office, offered Dunglass the unpaid post of unofficial parliamentary aide. This was doubly advantageous to Dunglass. Any MP appointed as official Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) to a government minister was privy to the inner workings of government but was expected to maintain a discreet silence in the House of Commons. Dunglass achieved the first without having to observe the second. He made his maiden speech in February 1932 on the subject of economic policy, advocating a cautiously protectionist approach to cheap imports. He countered Labour's objection that this would raise the cost of living, arguing that a tariff [...] "stimulates employment and gives work [...] increases the purchasing power of the people by substituting wages for unemployment benefit".|$|E
500|$|Television Without Pity {{gave the}} episode an [...] "A". Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club gave a glowing review, stating that [...] "I have to say, {{this is one}} of the most dense and {{interesting}} episodes of Veronica Mars yet, on a number of different levels." [...] He went on to praise the return of Troy, the various subplots, and the episode's ambiguous conclusion. The reviewer summed up by saying, [...] "With all that going on, it could have <b>been</b> <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> this episode to fall apart somewhere... "The Rapes of Graff" [...] really managed to do everything it was trying to do quite well. It may have been missing something special to put it in the absolute top tier of Veronica Mars episodes, but it's still a marvelous episode for pulling all those different strands together. Anais Bordages of BuzzFeed ranked the episode 27th of 64 episodes of Veronica Mars, but nevertheless gave a positive review, calling it [...] "awesome". She elaborated, [...] "The banter is excellent, our main character shoots down every sexist on campus, and Michael Cera has a cameo. Even better: The other part of the episode revolves around Cliff’s sexual misfortunes." [...] On a similar list, TV Line ranked the episode 16th.|$|E

500|$|As {{part of the}} RAAF's {{reorganisation}} {{following the}} outbreak of World War II in September 1939, No.2 Group was formed in Sydney on 20November; Charlesworth was appointed its Senior Air Staff Officer (SASO). He continued to serve in this position when the group was re-formed as Central Area in March 1940. Posted to Western Australia to take command of RAAF Station Pearce in August, {{he was promoted to}} temporary group captain on 1September 1940. He became Senior Administration Officer at the newly established Western Area, Perth, in January the following year. In September 1942, Charlesworth took over No.2 Bombing and Gunnery School in Sale, Victoria. He handed over to Group Captain Charles [...] "Moth" [...] Eaton in August 1943, before briefly taking charge of RAAF Headquarters Forward Echelon in Brisbane. Charlesworth was appointed Air Officer Commanding (AOC) Eastern Area, headquartered at Bradfield Park, Sydney, in December 1943. Eastern Area was responsible for maritime patrol and anti-submarine warfare off the coast of New South Wales and southern Queensland. Japanese submarine activity had decreased in the months prior to Charlesworth taking command, and he was concerned that Allied ships were becoming complacent. He observed [...] "a general slackening off in procedure; ships are seldom where they should be, and a minority of merchant ships identify themselves to aircraft". The RAAF's patrols had also settled into a predictable pattern that would have <b>been</b> <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> an observant submarine captain to avoid.|$|E
2500|$|On 28 August, Admiral Story {{returned}} with his squadron to the Vlieter roadstead, where he anchored, because adverse winds {{made it impossible}} to attack the British. Enervated by the sight of the Orangist flags on the forts and church steeples of Den Helder, the crews of several of the ships then started to mutiny. Van Braam's ship Leyden was one of those. He later admitted that it would have <b>been</b> <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> him to quell the revolt, but he intentionally did nothing. Instead, he informed his commanding officer, Admiral Story (who himself had to counter an incipient mutiny on the flagship Washington) of the [...] "precarious situation" [...] aboard the other ships of the fleet.|$|E

2500|$|Marais accused Maeterlinck {{of having}} used {{his concept of}} the [...] "organic unity" [...] of the termitary in his book. Marais had {{published}} his ideas on the termitary in the South African Afrikaans-language press, both in Die Burger in January 1923 and in Huisgenoot, which featured {{a series of articles}} on termites under the title [...] "Die Siel van die Mier" [...] (The Soul of the (White) Ant) from 1925 to 1926. Maeterlinck's book, with almost identical content, was published in 1926. It is alleged that Maeterlinck had come across Eugene Marais' series of articles, and that it would have <b>been</b> <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> Maeterlinck to translate from Afrikaans to French, since Maeterlinck knew Dutch and had already made several translations from Dutch into French before. It was common at the time for worthy articles published in Afrikaans to be reproduced in Flemish and Dutch magazines and journals.|$|E
2500|$|This art {{produced}} {{for commercial purposes}} has provided an important, sustainable {{source of income for}} the Huichols. Even though new materials are being used, traditional symbols are maintained and transmitted to younger generations. [...] However, the production of goods for commercial markets has caused a certain amount of controversy. One question concerns the “authenticity” of the yarn and bead art given the current forms’ modern origins. One person to do this was Fernando Benítez, who was particularly disturbed by the depiction of the dead as floating heads in yarn paintings; something he said was not traditionally Huichol. (origensbarnett) Much of the “authenticity” of the modern works {{has to do with the}} continued use of traditional symbols and designs. However, some items of Huichol items can be deemed non-traditional or borderline traditional, such as the production of Christmas tree decorations, masks of the sun and moon, the use of the jaguar (a Mesoamerican symbol) and the incorporation of modern images such as airplanes and modern buildings into designs. Selling of the items has not <b>been</b> <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> the Huichol either, with limited outlets such as tourist venues, especially Puerto Vallarta, Guadalajara and San Miguel de Allende as well as sales to middlemen who can earn much more from the works than they can.(CRUruibe) ...|$|E

2500|$|Trump {{was listed}} on the initial Forbes List of wealthy {{individuals}} in 1982 as having an estimated $200million fortune, including a share of his father's estimated $200million net worth. After several years on the list, Trump's financial losses in the 1980s caused him to be dropped from 1990 to 1995, and reportedly obliged him to borrow from his siblings' trusts in 1993; in 2005, The New York Times referred to Trump's [...] "verbal billions" [...] in a skeptical article about Trump's self-reported wealth. At the time, three individuals with direct knowledge of Trump's finances told reporter Timothy L. O'Brien that Trump's actual net worth was between $150 and $250million, though Trump then publicly claimed a net worth of $5 to $6billion. Claiming libel, Trump sued the reporter (and his book publisher) for $5billion, lost the case, and then lost again on appeal; Trump refused to turn over his unredacted tax returns despite his assertion they supported his case. In a sworn deposition, Trump testified that he once borrowed $9.6million from his father, calling it [...] "a very small amount of money", but could not recall when he did so; Trump has since told campaign audiences {{he began his career}} with [...] "a small loan of one million dollars" [...] from his father, which he paid back with interest: [...] "it has not <b>been</b> <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> me", Trump told one New Hampshire crowd.|$|E

Entertainment Weeklys Chancellor Agard awarded The Flash episode an [...] "A-", stating, [...] "Based on tonight's episode alone, this year's crossover is looking like it'll be the best one yet. The first crossovers were two relatively standalone episodes, and last year's was burdened with setting up Legends of Tomorrow.

That being said, the episode did drag a bit whenever it focused too much on the ongoing Team Flash drama... my biggest problems were with the Wally stuff. However, I understand that was here for viewers who might only watch The Flash, and the episode does a good job of appeasing both kinds of fans. Luckily, though, the nonsense doesn't drag the episode too much: For every anxious scene, there was a funny aside to lighten the mood." ...|$|E
