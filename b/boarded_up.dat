5|$|Since {{the site}} was sold to Onni in 2013, a series of {{incidents}} with squatters and vandals have drawn attention to security issues at the vacant building. In October 2014, the city of Seattle began exploring legal action over Onni's failure to secure the site; KIRO-TV reported that at least 10 squatters occupied the building, whose first floor had been <b>boarded</b> <b>up.</b>|$|E
5|$|The SS {{transfer}} the Jews {{to one of}} two ghettos, each with its own council or Judenrat. Eliezer's house on a corner of Serpent Street was in the larger ghetto in the town centre, so his family was able to stay at home, though the windows on the non-ghetto side had to be <b>boarded</b> <b>up.</b>|$|E
5|$|The building's {{restoration}} {{work was}} scheduled for 2002, however the operators of the polyclinic were reluctant to leave, having occupied the building for over 40 years. In order to force the occupants out of the building, the workers <b>boarded</b> <b>up</b> all of the windows and threatened {{to do the same}} to the doors if the polyclinic did not vacate the premises. Only the president's involvement in the matter forced the polyclinic to move out completely.|$|E

5|$|The oil {{industry}} would ultimately {{prove to be}} a resource curse to Wichita Falls, and the Texas Oil Boom ended only a few years later. The building was vacated, <b>boarded</b> <b>up,</b> and virtually forgotten in 1929 as the Great Depression struck North Texas and office space became relatively inexpensive to lease or purchase. A fire gutted the building in 1931, rendering it unusable for a number of years.|$|E
5|$|A {{statement}} {{issued by the}} National Weather Service advised people in nine Florida counties to complete hurricane preparations, which included securing loose objects and moving watercraft to safety. Homes along the coast were <b>boarded</b> <b>up</b> by their owners, while offshore, workers were removed from oil platforms. A spokesman for Royal Dutch Shell reported that 800 workers were to be evacuated. In New Orleans, emergency equipment was readied and inspected. The New Orleans Levee Board went into a second-stage alert on September 21, and cleared debris from floodwall openings.|$|E
5|$|Between 06:00 and 12:00 UTC on September10, the United States Weather Bureau issued storm signals, {{equivalent}} to a tropical storm warning in , from Cedar Key, Florida, to Charleston, South Carolina. These were later upgraded to hurricane warnings in South Florida. Due to inclement weather conditions in West Palm Beach, which had been newly incorporated as a town just days earlier, businesses suspended their normal operations and people <b>boarded</b> <b>up</b> buildings, even as the strongest winds arrived. As the cyclone moved into the Gulf of Mexico, reports from September 12 through September 14 helped ships prepare for the storm.|$|E

5|$|Due to Lane's {{projected}} path {{near the}} western coast of Mexico, authorities closed ports to small {{boats in the}} cities of Acapulco. Just weeks after Hurricane John took a similar path through the area, several tourists voluntarily left their vacations to fly home. Many residents <b>boarded</b> <b>up</b> buildings and bought hurricane supplies {{in preparation for the}} storm. Officials also closed schools across the state of Guerrero. In all, 40,400tourists were evacuated from the Mexican coastline. According to the Secretaría de Gobernación, under which the Mexican Civil Protection Service operates, there were 5.5million homes and 21million people in 21states threatened by the system in all of Mexico. As a result, authorities evacuated about 2,000people to emergency shelters.|$|E
5|$|During the Cultural Revolution, Red Guards {{attacked}} the Jokhang in 1966 {{and for a}} decade there was no worship in Tibetan monasteries. Renovation of the Jokhang began in 1972, and was mostly complete by 1980. After this {{and the end of}} persecution, the temple was re-consecrated. It is now visited by a large number of Tibetans, who come to worship Jowo in the temple's inner sanctum. During the Revolution, the temple was spared destruction and was reportedly <b>boarded</b> <b>up</b> until 1979. At that time, portions of the Jokhang reportedly housed pigs, a slaughterhouse and Chinese army barracks. Soldiers burned historic Tibetan scriptures. For a time, it was a hotel.|$|E
5|$|During {{the days}} before the storm's arrival in Florida, the Weather Bureau issued 40tropical cyclone-related advisories. Extensive {{preparations}} that resulted in a low loss of life and property were attributed to the warnings. In southern Florida, residents <b>boarded</b> <b>up</b> homes and businesses, and sought shelter in large structures. Hurricane parties took place in bars and hotel rooms, while some residents sat in hotel lobbies, listening to radio broadcasts. In Miami, stores sold out of various essentials—including bread and butter—as people prepared for the storm.|$|E

5|$|On December30, just a {{day before}} Waka passed through Tonga, {{warnings}} were issued for numerous islands, including parts of Fiji and Samoa. Forecasts showed the storm passing directly over the low-lying Tongan capital of Nuku'alofa as a Category3 cyclone. Owing to warnings from local media, all New Year's Eve celebrations were canceled as residents and tourists <b>boarded</b> <b>up</b> their homes. All airports in the region were shut down and ferry service was suspended. Many residents on the small island of Niuafo'ou, about 35km2 (13.5mi2) in size, evacuated to other islands prior to Waka's arrival.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the ensuing}} decades, the Erie Railroad fell into debt {{along with its}} competitor, the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad. On September 16, 1960, the Interstate Commerce Commission {{approved}} the railroads {{to go forward with}} a merger, creating the new Erie-Lackawanna Railroad on October 15, 1960. The new railroad lasted only 16 years. In 1976, the Erie Lackawanna and several other large railroad companies were merged into the newly formed federal Consolidated Rail Corporation (Conrail). At this point, stations had to fight for survival. The station depot at Harriman has been closed and <b>boarded</b> <b>up</b> since at least 1970. Passenger train service, however, remained intact through the early 1980s.|$|E
5|$|Violence peaked {{the next}} evening, {{the night of}} September 10–11. Businesses were better prepared. Some had <b>boarded</b> <b>up</b> and others stayed open all night with armed guards visible to {{discourage}} thieves {{taking advantage of the}} strike. Gamblers played dice in open view, and women had their handbags snatched. But the Guard's inexperience at handling crowds resulted in dangerous attempts to assert control. Gunfire in South Boston left two dead and others wounded. One person died in a riot at Scollay Square, a center of amusement halls and theaters. Whether the crowds were threatening property or making trouble because they were in sympathy with the strikers is unknown. The death total ultimately reached nine.|$|E

5|$|Advisories, {{along with}} {{coordination}} between the National Observatory at Havana and U.S. Weather Bureau, were credited for the reduced deaths in Cuba. Weather observations were also readily available from Cuban meteorological stations. On October 25, the cyclone's hurricane force winds {{were expected to}} remain off the Florida east coast, although gale-force winds were anticipated from the Florida Keys to Palm Beach, Florida. Accordingly, storm warnings were issued from Key West, Florida to Vero Beach, Florida. Military aircraft were transported to safer locations, while watercraft were stored in harbors and rivers. Hotels and resorts were <b>boarded</b> <b>up</b> on the barrier islands. The Bahamas received warnings {{well in advance of}} the hurricane. The hurricane turned quickly to the east, which reduced the threat to Bimini, Cat Cay, Grand Bahama, and the Abaco Islands.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the storm}} {{affected}} several Caribbean islands, the Turks and Caicos, and the Bahamas, preparations there, if any, were unclear. Residents across Puerto Rico <b>boarded</b> <b>up</b> windows and secured roofs {{in anticipation of}} damaging winds. Governor Robert Hayes Gore placed the Hurricane Relief Organization and Red Cross on standby. As the storm neared Florida, the United States Weather Bureau—later the National Weather Service—posted storm warnings between Miami and Titusville. These were later extended to include {{the west coast of}} the state from Punta Rassa to Tarpon Springs. At the time, forecasters were unaware that the storm was of hurricane status; this unawareness extended to the storm's passage over the Gulf of Mexico. Forecasters only issued storm warnings for part of the Texas coast, including the cities of Brownsville and Freeport.|$|E
5|$|Beginning on November27 and {{continuing}} through December3, the National Emergency Management Office in Palau issued {{more than ten}} detailed public announcements warning residents of the approaching storm and how to prepare. In response, numerous families <b>boarded</b> <b>up</b> their homes and sought refuge in the 45 public shelters opened across the republic. On December1, a United States Navy vessel arrived in Palau in case requests for assistance were made after the storm. As a precautionary measure, the nations electric grid was shut down at 6:00p.m. local time on December2. All flights to and from Roman Tmetuchl International Airport were suspended during the morning of December3. A strict curfew {{was put in place}} for the city of Koror {{for the duration of the}} typhoon.|$|E

5|$|Emergency centers were prepped {{across the}} {{northern}} Cook Islands on February8. The Cook Islands Chapter of the Red Cross took early action with Cyclone Pat and began stockpiling relief supplies on February9. Volunteers {{from the organization}} assisted elderly residents with preparation and evacuation on Aitutaki. Anticipating high winds, residents tied down homes with rope and wire and <b>boarded</b> <b>up</b> windows with shutters. Similar preparations took place on Rarotonga, though the main concern there was storm surge. Government offices and schools there were closed on February11. Most residents and all tourists along the coast in Aitutaki evacuated inland to designated shelters. Authorities later announced that they were under-prepared for Cyclone Pat. The lack of an official process during an emergency was cited as a core issue.|$|E
5|$|In {{advance of}} the storm, {{preparations}} were extensive; residents <b>boarded</b> <b>up</b> homes and businesses, while evacuations were recommended in some coastal areas. In the Bahamas, where winds reached , the storm killed three people. The city of Nassau was struck particularly hard. In Florida, damage was relatively severe, and included the deaths of several people. High winds brought down trees and power lines, though the storm was characterized by highly unusual rainfall patterns. In the Everglades region, a storm surge flooded local streets. As the storm progressed northward, the city of Tallahassee suffered widespread power outages and damage to numerous vehicles. Throughout the state, the hurricane inflicted $675,000 USD ($ 2011 USD) in damage. The cyclone later killed one person in Georgia.|$|E

The city of Nassau was struck particularly hard, though damage elsewhere in the islands was also severe, with many homes reported destroyed. In Florida, damage was relatively severe, and included the deaths of several people. High winds brought down trees and power lines, and wind-driven salt water damaged vegetation well inland across Dade County, though the storm was characterized by unusually light rainfall. Storm surge in the Everglades region flooded local streets, particularly at Everglades City.
