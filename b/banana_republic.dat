5|$|Following the Spanish–American War in 1898, this {{aggressive}} interpretation {{was used}} to create a U.S. economic empire across the Caribbean, such as with the 1903 treaty with Cuba that was heavily tilted in the U.S.' favor. U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt believed that the U.S. should be the main beneficiary of production in Central America. The U.S. enforced this hegemony with armed interventions in Nicaragua (1912–33), and Haiti (1915–34). The U.S. did not need to use its military might in Guatemala, where a series of dictators were willing to accommodate the economic interests of the U.S. in return for its support for their regimes. Guatemala was among the Central American countries of the period known as a <b>banana</b> <b>republic.</b> From 1890 to 1920, control of Guatemala's resources and its economy shifted away from Britain and Germany to the U.S., which became Guatemala's dominant trade partner. The Monroe Doctrine continued to be seen as relevant to Guatemala, and {{was used to}} justify the coup in 1954.|$|E

5000|$|On 7 October 2009, Professor Joseph Stiglitz, {{winner of}} the Nobel Prize in {{economics}} and former chief economist of the World Bank, speaking at Trinity College Dublin criticised NAMA.

The US has let 100 banks go this year alone, as did Sweden and Norway in their crises." [...] As well as commenting that in Ireland, [...] "this bank bailout is a simple transfer from taxpayers to bondholders, and it will saddle generations to come. The only thing that might give you solace is that, as chief economist of the World Bank, we see {{this type of thing}} happening in <b>banana</b> <b>republics</b> all over the world. Whenever a banking crisis happens, the financial sector uses the turmoil as a mechanism to transfer wealth from the general population to themselves. I’ve been very disappointed to see that it has happened, not only in <b>banana</b> <b>republics,</b> but in advanced industrialised countries." ...|$|R
500|$|The script—initially called Licence Revoked—was {{written with}} Dalton's {{characterisation}} of Bond in mind, and the obsession with which Bond pursues Sanchez {{on behalf of}} Leiter and his dead wife is seen as being because [...] "of his own brutally cut-short marriage." [...] Dalton's darker portrayal of Bond led to the violence being increased and more graphic. Wilson compared the script to Akira Kurosawa's Yojimbo, where a samurai [...] "without any attacking of the villain or its cohorts, only sowing the seeds of distrust, he manages to have the villain bring himself down". Wilson freely admitted {{that the idea of}} the destruction-from-within aspect of the plot came more from the cinema versions of the Japanese Rōnin tales by Kurosawa or Sergio Leone than from Fleming's use of that plot device from The Man with the Golden Gun. For the location Wilson created the Republic of Isthmus, a <b>banana</b> <b>republic</b> based on Panama, with the pock-marked Sanchez bearing similarities to General Manuel Noriega. The parallels between the two figures were based on Noriega's political use of drug trafficking and money laundering to provide revenues for Panama. Robert Davi suggested the line [...] "loyalty is more important than money", which he felt was fitting to the character of Franz Sanchez, whose actions were noticed by Davi to be concerned with betrayal and retaliation.|$|E

In April 2005, Mills had announced a lease commitment with WBBM-Channel 2 for about 100,000square feet(10,000m²) of space for offices and a showcase television studio.

Hergé's notes also reveal that Alcazar's wife was on the board of a company that kept him supplied with arms; a fact that may explain his marriage. To counter the rebels, Alcazar's enemy Tapioca struck a deal with Loch Lomond whisky and parachuted large amounts of their brand into the jungle, making the rebels too drunk to stage a coup. Loch Lomond also sponsored the local carnival.|$|R
50|$|The United Fruit Company was an American {{corporation}} that traded in tropical fruit (primarily bananas), grown on Central and South American plantations, {{and sold in}} the United States and Europe. The company was formed in 1899, from the merger of Minor C. Keith's banana-trading concerns with Andrew W. Preston's Boston Fruit Company. It flourished in the early and mid-20th century, and it came to control vast territories and transportation networks in Central America, the Caribbean coast of Colombia, Ecuador, and the West Indies. Though it competed with the Standard Fruit Company (later Dole Food Company) for dominance in the international banana trade, it maintained a virtual monopoly in certain regions, some of which {{came to be called}} <b>banana</b> <b>republics,</b> such as Costa Rica, Honduras, and Guatemala.|$|R
50|$|The {{struggle}} for {{natural resources and}} the US defense of its commercial interests has not ceased since the zenith period of the <b>banana</b> <b>republics</b> supported by the US.

Thus, the Bolivian Gas War in 2003-04 was sparked after projects by the Pacific LNG consortium to export natural gas - Bolivia possessing the second largest natural gas reserves in South America after Venezuela - to California (Baja California and US California) via Chile, resented in Bolivia since the War of the Pacific (1879-1884) which deprived it of an access to the Pacific Ocean. The ALCA was also opposed during the demonstrations, headed by the Bolivian Workers' Center and Felipe Quispe's Indigenous Pachakuti Movement (MIP).|$|R
