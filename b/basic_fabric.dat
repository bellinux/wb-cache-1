40|$|International audienceThe {{effective}} use of Run Time Reconfiguration (RTR) in modern FPGAs opens up new avenues to design area and power efficient high performance architectures. However the current design flow for exploiting RTR in designs, leads {{to the problem of}} silicon Defragmentation. We propose a silicon compaction/defragmentation technique which works on already placed and routed modules to generate partial bitstreams (programming files) for the device. We have outlined a method which generates these partial bitstreams very fast taking into account the size and position of the "free" silicon when the device is in operation. The other advantage of this method is that the changes in the <b>basic</b> FPGA <b>fabric</b> needed to implement this defragmentation strategy are (almost) trivial...|$|R

50|$|There {{are five}} {{varieties}} of human worlds: Agri-worlds are highly rich in fertile land with farming and animal husbandry being the main ways of life. These worlds are usually pre-industrial {{in nature and}} are havens of idyllic lifestyles for retiring members of the military; they supply food and <b>basic</b> <b>fabrics</b> to whole sectors. Death worlds feature wild, often extremely hazardous, landscapes with numerous dangerous flora and fauna species. The few human inhabitants of these worlds are usually rugged survivalists with unflinching natures, ideal recruitment centers for the military. Shrine worlds are the final resting places of extensively decorated or martyred holy individuals, also serving as vast memorial sites and grand monuments for epic events in the imperial history. Though the local populations are minimal, millions of people engage in pilgrimages to shrine worlds {{from every corner of}} the Imperium each year. Hive worlds, also known as Imperial Worlds, are extensively developed planets with towering city structures that stretch for many hundreds of kilometers in every direction; tens of billions of citizens live in basic hab-blocks with often substandard living conditions while the local aristocracy and ranking officials wallow in extreme luxury and decadence. These worlds form the fortified capital planets of the Imperium where millions of citizens are recruited as hard laborers or soldiers in the Imperial Guard and other military organizations. Finally, Forge worlds are the exclusive planets of the Adeptus Mechanicus; highly industrialized worlds with colossal factory structures blanketing over most of their landmasses. Thick toxic smog and corrosive chemical fumes permeate the atmosphere where only cybernetically altered individuals can survive without protective clothing. These Mechanicus worlds supply the Imperium with vast building materials and of course its innumerable war machines and weapons.|$|R

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 6 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, South Africa, 30 June - 2 July, 2008.

The fabric porosity is a function of construction parameters such as yarn fineness and set of weft and warp. The ideal volume porosity can be computed from <b>basic</b> <b>fabric</b> parameters and the structure of elementary cell.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new micromechanical model to predict biaxial tensile moduli of {{plain weave fabric}} (PWF) composites by considering {{the interaction between the}} orthogonal interlacing strands. The two orthogonal yarns in micromechanical unit cell (UC) were idealized as curved beams with a path depicted by using sinusoidal shape functions. The biaxial tensile moduli of PWF composites were derived by means of the minimum total complementary potential energy principle founded on micromechanics. Biaxial tensile tests were conducted on the RTM-made EW 220 / 5284 PWF composites at five biaxial loading ratios of 0, 1, 2, 3 and ∞ to validate the new model. Predictions from the new model were compared with experimental data. Good correlation was achieved between the predictions and actual experiments, demonstrating the practical and effective use of the proposed model. Using the new model, the biaxial tensile moduli of plain weave fabric (PWF) composites can be predicted based only on the properties of <b>basic</b> woven <b>fabric...</b>|$|R
