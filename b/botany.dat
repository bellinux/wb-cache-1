5|$|During the 18th century <b>botany</b> {{was one of}} the few {{sciences}} considered {{appropriate for}} genteel educated women. Around 1760, with the popularization of the Linnaean system, <b>botany</b> became much more widespread among educated women who painted plants, attended classes on plant classification, and collected herbarium specimens although emphasis was on the healing properties of plants rather than plant reproduction which had overtones of sexuality. Women began publishing on botanical topics and children's books on <b>botany</b> appeared by authors like Charlotte Turner Smith. Cultural authorities argued that education through <b>botany</b> created culturally and scientifically aware citizens, part of the thrust for 'improvement' that characterised the Enlightenment. However, in the early 19th century with the recognition of <b>botany</b> as an official science women were again excluded from the discipline.|$|E
5|$|As {{a popular}} and {{acceptable}} activity, <b>botany</b> {{had been taken}} up by many middle class ladies, and Darwin included these <b>botany</b> enthusiasts in his correspondence. On the recommendation of John Lindley, Darwin wrote to Lady Dorothy Nevill, who responded generously by sending numerous exotic orchids, and requested a signed photograph of him to hang in her sitting room next to portraits of her other notable friends, including Hooker.|$|E
5|$|Augustin Pyramus de Candolle also spelled Augustin Pyrame de Candolle (4 February 1778 – 9 September 1841) was a Swiss botanist. René Louiche Desfontaines {{launched}} de Candolle's botanical {{career by}} recommending him at an herbarium. Within {{a couple of}} years de Candolle had established a new genus, and he went on to document hundreds of plant families and create a new natural plant classification system. Although de Candolle's main focus was <b>botany,</b> he also contributed to related fields such as phytogeography, agronomy, paleontology, medical <b>botany,</b> and economic <b>botany.</b>|$|E
5|$|Dacey {{campaigned for}} the {{district}} of <b>Botany</b> in 1894 and lost to the free trade supporter William Stephen. Dacey was successful in the 1895 election, defeating Stephen for the seat. In the 1904 state election, Dacey {{was elected to the}} new seat of Alexandria following an electoral redistribution. He was succeeded in the district of <b>Botany</b> by Rowland Anderson from the Liberal Reform Party.|$|E
5|$|Harvard had so {{much trouble}} finding a {{replacement}} for Gray that they considered hiring a European, but they found an American and hired George Lincoln Goodale in late 1872. Goodale had a medical degree from Harvard and a solid knowledge of <b>botany.</b> By late June 1873 Goodale had enough experience that Gray was exalted to pronounce he had taught his last class. William Gilson Farlow also had a medical degree from Harvard and had studied <b>botany.</b> He became Gray's assistant in 1870 after obtaining his medical degree and then studied in Europe for a few years. He returned to Harvard in 1874 and became a <b>botany</b> professor. Sereno Watson began helping Gray with taxonomy in 1872 and became the herbarium curator. The reorganization of <b>botany</b> at Harvard in the early 1870s was a major accomplishment of Gray's.|$|E
5|$|Harvard {{was able}} to secure {{substantial}} new funding for its botanical programs {{in the years after}} the war, but Gray encountered significant trouble finding a suitable replacement for his professorial duties. The American university system had failed to train replacements for its professors. Only Harvard and Yale had <b>botany</b> programs, and in the war and pre-war years there had been few <b>botany</b> students. However, after the war there was an upswing in the numbers of <b>botany</b> students. Gray was grooming Horace Mann Jr. as his replacement, but he died of tuberculosis at the age of 24 in November 1868.|$|E
5|$|He {{is remembered}} {{in the plant}} genera Candollea and Candolleodendron, several plant species like Eugenia candolleana or Diospyros candolleana and the {{mushroom}} Psathyrella candolleana. Candollea, a scientific journal that publishes papers on systematic <b>botany</b> and phylotaxonomy, was named after de Candolle and his descendants in honor of their contribution {{to the field of}} <b>botany.</b> He was a mentor to the French-Mexican botanist Jean-Louis Berlandier.|$|E

5|$|Herbals {{contributed to}} <b>botany</b> by setting in train {{the science of}} plant description, classification, and botanical illustration. Up to the 17th century <b>botany</b> and {{medicine}} were {{one and the same}} but those books emphasising medicinal aspects eventually omitted the plant lore to become modern pharmacopoeias; those that omitted the medicine became more botanical and evolved into the modern compilations of plant descriptions we call Floras. These were often backed by specimens deposited in a herbarium which was a collection of dried plants that verified the plant descriptions given in the Floras. The transition from herbal to Flora marked the final separation of <b>botany</b> from medicine.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, back at <b>Botany</b> Bay, Captain John Hunter of HMS Sirius {{made contact}} with the French ships, and he and the commander, Captain de Clonard, {{exchanged}} greetings. Clonard advised Hunter that the fleet commander was Jean-François de Galaup, comte de Lapérouse. Sirius successfully cleared <b>Botany</b> Bay, but the other ships were in great difficulty. Charlotte was blown dangerously close to rocks; Friendship and Prince of Wales became entangled, both ships losing booms or sails; Charlotte and the Friendship actually collided; and Lady Penrhyn nearly ran aground. Despite these difficulties, all the remaining ships finally managed to clear <b>Botany</b> Bay and sail to Sydney Cove on 26 January. The last ship anchored there at about 3pm.|$|E

5|$|Stearn {{attended}} evening {{lectures on}} paleobotany given by Albert Seward (chair of <b>botany</b> at Cambridge University 1906–1936), and Harry Godwin. Seward {{was impressed by}} the young Stearn, giving him access to the herbarium of the <b>Botany</b> School (now Department of Plant Sciences – see 1904 photograph) and allowing him to work there as a part-time research assistant. Later, Seward also gave Stearn access to the Cambridge University Library to pursue his research.|$|E
5|$|Stearn was {{appointed}} Sandars Reader in Bibliography, University of Cambridge in 1965 and from 1977 to 1983 he was {{visiting professor at}} Cambridge University's Department of <b>Botany,</b> and also Visiting Professor in <b>Botany</b> at Reading University 1977–1983, and then Honorary Research Fellow (1983–). He was also {{a fellow of the}} Institute of Biology (1967) and honorary fellow, Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge.|$|E
5|$|The Elements of <b>Botany</b> (1836), an {{introductory}} textbook, {{was the first}} of Gray's many works. In this book Gray espoused the idea that <b>botany</b> was useful not only to medicine, but also to farmers. Gray and Torrey published the Flora of North America together in 1838. By the mid-1850s the demands of teaching, research, gardening, collecting, and corresponding had become so great, and he had become so influential, that Gray wrote two high school-level texts in the late 1850s: First Lessons in <b>Botany</b> and Vegetable Physiology (1857) and How Plants Grow: A Simple Introduction to Structural <b>Botany</b> (1858). The publishers pressured Gray to make these two books non-technical enough so that high school students and non-scientists could understand them. As with most scientists in American academic institutions, Gray found it difficult to concentrate purely on research.|$|E
5|$|The {{expedition}} inferred {{the position}} of the South Magnetic Pole, and made substantial observations of the zoology and <b>botany</b> of the region, resulting in a monograph on the zoology, and a series of four detailed monographs by Hooker on the <b>botany,</b> collectively called Flora Antarctica and published in parts between 1843 and 1859. The expedition was the last major voyage of exploration made wholly under sail.|$|E
5|$|They {{returned}} to <b>Botany</b> Bay {{on the evening}} of 23 January, when Phillip gave orders to move the fleet to Sydney Cove the next morning, 24 January. That day, there was a huge gale blowing, making it impossible to leave <b>Botany</b> Bay, so they decided to wait till the next day, 25 January. However, during 24 January, they spotted the ships Astrolabe and Boussole, flying the French flag, at the entrance to <b>Botany</b> Bay; they were having as much trouble getting into the bay as the First Fleet was having getting out.|$|E
5|$|Two {{years after}} his {{tutoring}} had begun, {{he was sent to}} the Lower Grammar School at Växjö in 1717. Linnaeus rarely studied, often going to the countryside to look for plants. He reached the last year of the Lower School when he was fifteen, which was taught by the headmaster, Daniel Lannerus, who was interested in <b>botany.</b> Lannerus noticed Linnaeus' interest in <b>botany</b> and gave him the run of his garden.|$|E
5|$|Another {{work from}} Ancient Greece that made an early impact on <b>botany</b> is De Materia Medica, a five-volume {{encyclopedia}} about herbal medicine {{written in the}} middle of the first century by Greek physician and pharmacologist Pedanius Dioscorides. De Materia Medica was widely read for more than 1,500 years. Important contributions from the medieval Muslim world include Ibn Wahshiyya's Nabatean Agriculture, Abū Ḥanīfa Dīnawarī's (828–896) the Book of Plants, and Ibn Bassal's The Classification of Soils. In the early 13th century, Abu al-Abbas al-Nabati, and Ibn al-Baitar (d. 1248) wrote on <b>botany</b> in a systematic and scientific manner.|$|E
5|$|<b>Botany</b> {{originated}} as herbalism, {{the study}} and use of plants for their medicinal properties. Many records of the Holocene period date early botanical knowledge {{as far back as}} 10,000 years ago. This early unrecorded knowledge of plants was discovered in ancient sites of human occupation within Tennessee, which make up much of the Cherokee land today. The early recorded history of <b>botany</b> includes many ancient writings and plant classifications. Examples of early botanical works have been found in ancient texts from India dating back to before 1100 BC, in archaic Avestan writings, and in works from China before it was unified in 221 BC.|$|E
5|$|By mid-December the ship's {{supply of}} flour and butter for the voyage had been {{exhausted}} and Philip authorised Mason to broach the stores {{set aside for}} the future colony in order to continue to feed the convicts. A month later, on 20 January 1788, Prince of Wales reached Australia's <b>Botany</b> Bay. Six days later she sailed for Sydney Cove as part of the relocation of the convict settlement to Port Jackson. Leaving <b>Botany</b> Bay she collided with Friendship, losing her mainmast staysail and topsail, but the damage was swiftly repaired and she was able to enter Port Jackson in line with her fellow transports. There she landed 49 convicts, 31 marines and 23 civilians.|$|E
5|$|During Stearn's initial {{four years}} in Cambridge (1929–1933), he {{published}} twenty-four papers, predominantly in the Gardeners' Chronicle and Gardening Illustrated and the Journal of <b>Botany,</b> his first in 1929. While working as a gardener's boy during school holidays he had observed a specimen of Campanula pusilla (Campanula cochleariifolia) with a distorted corolla. He then described and published the first appearance of the causative agent, the mould Peronospora corollaea, in Britain, using the facilities of the <b>Botany</b> library.|$|E

5|$|Having {{confirmed}} his Lang credentials, Heffron stood as the endorsed Labor party {{candidate for the}} seat of <b>Botany</b> at the 1927 election, which was held by Thomas Mutch, who had split from party after a stoush with Lang and stood as an 'Independent Labor' candidate after being denied preselection. A contest marked by clashes and accusations of rorting, Heffron was ultimately unsuccessful, gaining only 45% of the vote. He was eventually successful at the next election in 1930, defeating Mutch, and would hold <b>Botany</b> until its abolition in 1950.|$|E
5|$|In 1804, de Candolle {{published}} his Essai sur les propriétés médicales des plantes and {{was granted a}} doctor of medicine degree by the medical faculty of Paris. Two years later, he published Synopsis plantarum in flora Gallica descriptarum. de Candolle then spent the next six summers making a botanical and agricultural survey of France {{at the request of}} the French government, which was published in 1813. In 1807 he was appointed professor of <b>botany</b> in the medical faculty of the University of Montpellier, where he would later become the first chair of <b>botany</b> in 1810. While in Montpellier, de Candolle {{published his}} Théorie élémentaire de la botanique (Elementary Theory of <b>Botany,</b> 1813), which introduced a new classification system and the word taxonomy. Candolle moved back to Geneva in 1816 and in the following year was invited by the government of the Canton of Geneva to fill the newly created chair of natural history.|$|E
5|$|In the 1760s and 1770s, <b>botany</b> became {{increasingly}} popular in Britain {{because of the}} translation of Linnaeus's works into English. One {{of the most prominent}} books about <b>botany</b> was William Withering's Botanical Arrangement of all the Vegetables Naturally Growing in Great Britain (1776), which used Linnaeus's system for classifying plants. Withering's book went through multiple editions and became the standard text on British plants for a generation. The book delighted and intrigued experts, amateurs, and children alike.|$|E
5|$|In the 17th century, {{botanical gardens}} began their {{contribution}} to a deeper scientific curiosity about plants. If a botanical garden is defined by its scientific or academic connection, then the first true botanical gardens were established with the revival of learning {{that occurred in the}} European Renaissance. These were secular gardens attached to universities and medical schools, used as resources for teaching and research. The superintendents of these gardens were often professors of <b>botany</b> with international reputations, a factor that probably contributed to the creation of <b>botany</b> as an independent discipline rather than a descriptive adjunct to medicine.|$|E
5|$|In the British Who's Who, Osman Hill named field ornithology, <b>botany,</b> photography, {{and travel}} as his recreations. Other casual {{interests}} included drugstore ice cream, good eating, old buildings, and gardening with his wife.|$|E
5|$|On 13 May 1787 a {{fleet of}} 11 ships, which {{came to be known}} as the First Fleet, was sent by the British Admiralty from England to New Holland. Under the command of Captain Arthur Phillip, the fleet sought to {{establish}} a penal colony at <b>Botany</b> Bay on the coast of New South Wales, which had been explored and claimed by Lieutenant James Cook in 1770. The settlement was seen as necessary because of the loss of the Thirteen Colonies in North America. The Fleet arrived between 18 and 20 January 1788, but it was immediately apparent that <b>Botany</b> Bay was unsuitable.|$|E

5|$|Polymath {{figures such}} as the statesmen Shen Kuo and Su Song (1020–1101) {{embodied}} advancements in all fields of study, including biology, <b>botany,</b> zoology, geology, mineralogy, mechanics, horology, astronomy, pharmaceutical medicine, archeology, mathematics, cartography, optics, art criticism, and more.|$|E
5|$|Stearn {{was largely}} self-educated and his widowed mother {{worked hard to}} support him while at school but could not afford a {{university}} education for him, there being no grants available then. When not at the <b>Botany</b> School, he attended evening classes to develop linguistic and bibliographic skills. His classes there included German and the classics. He obtained his first employment {{at the age of}} 18 in 1929, a time of high unemployment, to support himself and his family. He worked as an apprentice antiquarian bookseller and cataloguer in the second-hand section at Bowes & Bowes bookshop, 1 Trinity Street (now Cambridge University Press), between 1929 and 1933 where he was able to pursue his passion for bibliography. During his employment there, he spent much of his lunchtimes, evenings and weekends, at the <b>Botany</b> School and Botanic Garden. This was at a time when <b>botany</b> was thriving at Cambridge under the leadership of Seward and Humphrey Gilbert-Carter.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} botanical gardens is {{closely linked to}} the history of <b>botany</b> itself. The botanical gardens of the 16th and 17th centuries were {{medicinal}} gardens, but the idea of a botanical garden changed to encompass displays of the beautiful, strange, new and sometimes economically important plant trophies being returned from the European colonies and other distant lands. Later, in the 18th century, they became more educational in function, demonstrating the latest plant classification systems devised by botanists working in the associated herbaria as they tried to order these new treasures. Then, in the 19th and 20th centuries, the trend was towards a combination of specialist and eclectic collections demonstrating many aspects of both horticulture and <b>botany.</b>|$|E
