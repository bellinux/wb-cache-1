40|$|Drinking and Wastewater Applications II sessionPerfluorinated {{compounds}} (PFCs), emerging contaminants, are globally distributed due {{to their}} persistent and <b>bioaccumulative</b> <b>characteristics.</b> The static adsorption behavior of PFCs on BW 30, NF 90, and NF 270 membranes {{and the effect of}} the physico-chemical properties of the membranes and structure of Perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) on interactions between them have been thoroughly investigated. Two classes of PFCs were evaluated: perfluorosulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluoroalkanoic acid with 5, 7, 9, and 11 carbon atoms. Adsorption of PFCs increased with increasing ionic strength, and decreasing pH due to decreased electrostatic repulsion between membrane surfaces and PFCs. The extent of PFOS adsorption on each membrane was higher than the extent of comparable perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) adsorption. This is attributed to the easy migration of PFOS to the membrane surface from aqueous solution compared with PFNA. The adsorption of PFCs on thin-film composite membranes strongly depended on the material composing the active layer of the membranes. NF 270 membranes (a piperazine based membrane) showed higher adsorption of PFOS and PFNA compounds compared with BW 30 and NF 90 membranes (polyamide based membranes). The BW 30 polyamide membrane, which has a coating layer with aliphatic carbon and hydroxyl groups, had less interaction with PFOS and PFNA than the NF 90 polyamide membrane. Increased chain length of PFCs increased adsorption. This research shows that the adsorption behavior of PFCs on commercial thin-film composite membranes depends on the electrostatic interaction of both membranes and PFCs {{as a function of the}} applied solution chemistry, the active layer material of the membranes, and the chain length/functional group of PFC...|$|E
40|$|The {{extensive}} use of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) as surfactants in, for example textiles,cookware and aqueous firefighting foams (AFFFs) during the last decades has resulted in widespread environmental contamination. Due to the persistent and <b>bioaccumulative</b> <b>characteristics</b> of PFASs, they are ubiquitously found in the environment, wildlife and humans. Currently, the knowledge of remediation techniques for environments contaminated with PFASs is limited. Therefore, this study aims at evaluating the potential of plant uptake of 26 different PFASs from contaminated soils and groundwater. Arlanda airport, Sweden’s biggest airport, has a fire training facility that is suffering from severe PFAS contamination due to former regular practices with PFAS-containing AFFFs for safety purposes. Samples from different plant species, namely silver birch (Betula pendula), Norway spruce (Picea abies), bird cherry (Prunus padus), mountain ash (Sorbus aucuparia), ground elder (Aegopodium podagraria), long beechfern (Phegopteris connectilis) and wild strawberry (Fragaria vesca), surface soil and groundwater were taken near the fire training site to assess the accumulation potential and eligibility of selected plants for phytoremediation. In comparison to typical background levels, elevated ΣPFAS levels were detected in soil and groundwater ranging from 16 - 156 ng g⁻¹ dry weight (dw) and 1, 200 and 34, 000 ng L⁻¹, respectively. The plants showed a high variability of concentrations with highest ΣPFAS concentrations in vegetative compartments, particularly the foliage. Birch leaves exceeded all other sampled tissues and species with a maximum of ΣPFAS 327 ng g⁻¹ dw, followed by spruce needles with 222 ng g⁻¹ dw. The leaves and twigs of mountain ash were generally the least contaminated (< 10 ng g⁻¹ dw, while the other twigs had concentrations of up to 76 ng g⁻¹ dw (birch). Interestingly, the annual ground cover plants were highly contaminated and accumulated high amounts of PFASs. The bioconcentration factors (BCFs; plant/soil ratios) {{were found to be}} as high as 143, 700 for 6 : 2 FTSA (birch leaves), which turned out to have the highest accumulation potential in plants. Moreover, the BCFs were highest for short-chained C 3 -C 5 perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs; median ~ 0. 9) and decreased for the longer chained C 7 -C 9 PFCAs (~ 0. 4), while being lowest for the long-chained C 6 -C 8 perfluoroalkane sulfonic acids (PFSAs; ~ 0. 2). In conclusion, silver birch, Norway spruce, bird cherry and long beechfern seem promising candidates for phytoremediation of PFASs...|$|E
40|$|Running header: Learning {{lessons from}} {{hexachlorocyclohexane}} The {{use of chemicals}} by society has many benefits but {{contamination of the environment}} is an unintended consequence. One example is the organochlorine compound hexachlorocyclohexane. During the 1980 s, when hexachlorocyclohexane was banned in many countries, the brominated flame retardant, hexabromocyclododecane, found increasing use. The persistent, <b>bioaccumulative</b> and toxic <b>characteristics</b> of hexabromocyclododecane are, 30 years later, likely to warrant global action on production and use under the Stockholm Convention on POPs. Historical lessons have taught us that we need to control the use of chemicals and programmes are in place worldwide in an attempt to do so. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{association}} between genetic {{variations in the}} cytochrome P 450 (CYP) family genes and pathological conditions related to long-term exposure to organochlorine compounds (OCs) deserves further elucidation. OCs are persistent organic pollutants with <b>bioaccumulative</b> and lipophilic <b>characteristics.</b> They can act as endocrine disruptors and perturb cellular mechanisms. Prolonged exposure to OCs {{has been associated with}} different pathological manifestations. CYP genes are responsible for transcribing enzymes essential in xenobiotic metabolism. Therefore, polymorphisms in these genetic sequences a. alter the metabolic pathways, b. induce false cellular responses, and c. may provoke pathological conditions. The main aim of this review is to define the interaction between parameters a, b and c at a mechanistic/molecular level, with references in clinical cases.
