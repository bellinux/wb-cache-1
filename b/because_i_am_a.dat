But my conviction is that I have suffered for things that I am guilty of. I am suffering <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>a</b> radical and indeed I am a radical; I have suffered because I am an Italian and indeed I am an Italian...if you could execute me two times, and if I could be reborn two other times, I would live again to do what I have done already.|$|E

500|$|Sitti Nurbaya {{inspired}} numerous authors, including Nur Sutan Iskandar, who {{stated that}} he wrote Apa Dayaku Karena Aku Perempuan (What Am I to Do <b>Because</b> <b>I</b> <b>Am</b> <b>a</b> Girl, 1924) {{as a direct result}} of reading it; Iskandar later wrote Cinta yang Membawa Maut (Love that Brings Death, 1926), which deals with the same themes. The Sitti Nurbaya storyline has often been reused, to the point that Balfas has referred to similar plots as following [...] "the Sitti Nurbaya formula".|$|E
500|$|Alongside {{her acting}} career, Pinto has been {{actively}} involved with several humanitarian causes and is vocal about the uplifting {{of women and}} underprivileged children. She has cited Angelina Jolie and Malala Yousafzai as [...] "massive" [...] inspirations in this regard. In 2010, Pinto joined Andre Agassi and Steffi Graf in support of their philanthropic organisation, the Agassi Foundation. She raised $75,000 for their annual fund raiser—"The 15th Grand Slam for Children"—which was aimed at providing education for underprivileged children. Two years later, she was appointed as the global ambassador of Plan International's <b>Because</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>a</b> Girl, a campaign that promotes gender equality {{with the aim of}} lifting millions of girls out of poverty.|$|E
500|$|In 2002, Hill collaboratively {{wrote an}} autobiography, , with mountaineer and writer Greg Child, {{published}} by W.W. Norton & Company. As {{she describes the}} process, [...] "He would take my writings and organize them, and he encouraged me to elaborate on certain elements. He emphasized that telling the story is what's important, so he really helped me think about what I wanted to say, and figure out who my audience was." [...] Hill explained {{in an interview that}} writing about past events was easier because she had had time to reflect on them. She wanted to [...] "convey the history and culture of free climbing", specifically how it became as specialized as it is today. She felt that she had a unique perspective to offer, both as someone who climbed at a particular moment in climbing history and as a woman: [...] "And I wonder if a male writer would have presented that information differently. I think the book is important from that stand point , <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>a</b> woman, and there are not many female viewpoints on climbing, or the history of climbing, out there." [...] Writing about climbing in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s was dominated by men. As accomplished American climber and writer Rachel de Silva explains, the six major American climbing magazines published fewer than 12 articles a year by or about women during the 1980s despite women comprising 40% of climbers. It was not until 1990 that the first women-centric climbing books appeared.|$|E
6000|$|So it <b>was</b> not <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> fighter, but <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> thinker, that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> enraged by the motion-wastage of the loom-rooms and was persecuted by {{the guards}} into {{becoming}} an [...] "incorrigible."

500|$|Before the 1966–67 season, Celtics coach Red Auerbach retired. Initially, he {{had wanted}} his old player Frank Ramsey as coach, but Ramsey was too {{occupied}} running his three lucrative nursing homes. His second choice Bob Cousy declined, stating {{he did not want}} to coach his former teammates, and the third choice Tom Heinsohn also said no, because he did not think he could handle the often surly Russell. However, Heinsohn proposed Russell himself as a player-coach, and when Auerbach asked his center, he said yes. On April 16, 1966 Bill Russell agreed to become head coach of the Boston Celtics followed by a public announcement two days later. Russell thus became the first African American head coach in NBA history, and commented to journalists: [...] "I wasn't offered the job <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>a</b> Negro, I was offered it because Red figured I could do it." [...] The Celtics' championship streak ended in his first full season as head coach at eight, however, as Wilt Chamberlain's Philadelphia 76ers won a record-breaking 68 regular season games and overcame the Celtics 4–1 in the 1967 Eastern Finals. The Sixers simply outpaced the Celtics, shredding the famous Boston defense by scoring 140 points in the clinching Game 5 win. Russell acknowledged his first real loss in his career (he had been injured in 1958 when the Celtics lost the NBA Finals) by visiting Chamberlain in the locker room, shaking his hand and saying, [...] "Great". However, the game still ended on a high note for Russell. After the loss, he led his grandfather through the Celtics locker rooms, and the two saw white Celtics player John Havlicek taking a shower next to his black teammate Sam Jones and discussing the game. Suddenly, Jake Russell broke down crying. Asked by his grandson what was wrong, his grandfather replied how proud he was of him, being coach of an organization in which blacks and whites coexisted in harmony.|$|E
2500|$|Yugoslav Partisan Milovan Djilas {{described}} himself as a Montenegrin Serb and described Montenegro as the spiritual homeland of Serbs, saying [...] "I am not a Montenegrin <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>a</b> Serb, but a Serb <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>a</b> Montenegrin. We Montenegrins are the salt of the Serbs. All the strength of the Serbs is not here [...] but their soul is." [...] Djilas also has said [...] "The Montenegrins are, despite provincial and historical differences, quintessentially Serbs, and Montenegro the cradle of Serbian myths and of aspirations for the unification of Serbs.".|$|E

2500|$|Brahms {{has been}} {{described}} as an agnostic and a humanist. The devout Catholic Antonín Dvořák wrote in a letter: [...] "Such a man, such a fine soul – and he believes in nothing!

[...] When asked by conductor Karl Reinthaler to add additional sectarian text to his German Requiem, Brahms is reported to have responded, [...] "As far as the text is concerned, I confess that I would gladly omit even the word German and instead use Human; also with my best knowledge and will I would dispense with passages like [...] On the other hand, I have chosen one thing or another <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>a</b> musician, because I needed it, and because with my venerable authors I can't delete or dispute anything.

2500|$|In July 2013, a {{petition}} organized by historian Merna Foster and addressed to Stephen Poloz and Jim Flaherty campaigned {{to have the}} Bank of Canada feature [...] "significant Canadian women" [...] on banknotes. It drew support from famous Canadian women, including Margaret Atwood, Kim Cattrall and Cynthia Dale, and from several Members of Parliament, including Bruce Hyer, Peggy Nash, and Murray Rankin. It was also supported by the <b>Because</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>a</b> Girl campaign. The petition was started because of the exclusion of women from the banknote designs, and stated that earlier banknotes included women, such as the fifty-dollar banknote of the Canadian Journey Series which featured The Famous Five and Thérèse Casgrain on the reverse. The petition was delivered to Poloz, who stated that the Bank of Canada was [...] "absolutely open to the idea" [...] of incorporating portraits of famous Canadian women in future banknote series. Poloz sent a reply letter to Forster on 4 November 2013.|$|E
