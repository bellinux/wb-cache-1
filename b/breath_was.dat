5|$|The nuckelavee's <b>breath</b> <b>was</b> {{thought to}} wilt crops and sicken livestock, {{and it was}} {{considered}} responsible for epidemics and drought. Seaweed burning to create what was known {{at the time as}} kelp began on Stronsay in 1722. The product– soda ash– was an alkali mainly used to treat acidic soil, although as time went on its commercial importance in soap and glass manufacture increased. The pungent smoke emitted during the process was believed to enrage the nuckelavee, resulting in a wild rampage of plague, the deaths of cattle and the destruction of crops. The nuckelavee was said to have infected horses on Stronsay with the deadly disease known as mortasheen, to demonstrate its fury and exact its revenge against the islanders for burning seaweed; the infection subsequently spread to all the other islands involved in the industry. The creature was also blamed for prolonged periods of abnormally low rainfall, leading to water shortages and poor harvests.|$|E
25|$|The House of <b>Breath</b> <b>was</b> {{received}} with critical {{success and}} puzzlement. Critics appreciated Goyen’s lyric and evocative prose {{but at the}} same time did not think it always worked in the author’s favor. Goyen’s family and the people in Trinity, Texas were troubled by what appeared to be the book’s disturbing autobiographical look at a “fictional” family in a “fictional” East Texas town.|$|E
500|$|The nuckelavee (...) or nuckalavee is a horse-like demon from Orcadian mythology that {{combines}} equine and human elements. It has {{its origins in}} Norse mythology, and is the most horrible of all the demons of Scotland's Northern Isles. The nuck component of its name may be cognate with Nick in Old Nick, {{a name for the}} Christian Devil. The nuckelavee's <b>breath</b> <b>was</b> thought to wilt crops and sicken livestock, and the creature was held responsible for droughts and epidemics on land despite its being predominantly a sea-dweller.|$|E
50|$|A {{traditional}} method {{given by}} the Buddha in the Satipatthana Sutta is {{to go into the}} forest and sit beneath a tree and then to simply watch the breath, if the <b>breath</b> <b>is</b> long, to notice that the <b>breath</b> <b>is</b> long, if the <b>breath</b> <b>is</b> short, to notice that the <b>breath</b> <b>is</b> short.|$|R

25|$|<b>Breaths</b> <b>are</b> {{classified}} as spontaneous or mandatory based {{on both the}} trigger and cycle events. A spontaneous <b>breath</b> <b>is</b> a <b>breath</b> for which the patient both triggers and cycles the breath. A spontaneous breath may occur during a mandatory breath (e.g. Airway Pressure Release Ventilation). A spontaneous <b>breath</b> may <b>be</b> assisted or unassisted. A mandatory <b>breath</b> <b>is</b> a <b>breath</b> for which the machine triggers and/or cycles the breath. A mandatory breath can occur during a spontaneous breath (e.g., High Frequency Jet Ventilation). A mandatory <b>breath</b> <b>is,</b> by definition, assisted.|$|R
500|$|... "Give It Up to Me" [...] {{was written}} by Shakira, Amanda Ghost, Lil Wayne, and Timbaland, and was {{produced}} by the latter. Timbaland, who produced [...] "Give It Up to Me", initially planned to include the song on his third studio album Shock Value II (2009). He originally served as the featured vocalist, though his verse was replaced by Flo Rida, who himself was later substituted by Lil Wayne. Amanda Ghost, the president of Epic Records, noted that [...] "everyone's <b>breath</b> <b>was</b> blown away" [...] when Lil Wayne expressed interest in appearing on the track. The last-minute collaboration resulted in the delayed release of its parent album She Wolf in the United States. The decision resulted {{in the creation of}} a deluxe version of the album available exclusively in the country.|$|E
500|$|According to folklorist Jennifer Westwood, the stoor worm's {{head was}} [...] "like a great mountain"; its <b>breath</b> <b>was</b> putrid, contaminating plants and {{destroying}} any humans or animals with its blast. Traill Dennison reported the serpent's length was [...] "beyond telling, and reached {{thousands and thousands}} of miles in the sea". Giant sea swells and earthquakes were attributed to the beast yawning, a sign it wanted to be fed rather than of fatigue. Islanders were terrified of the serpent; it was described by Traill Dennison, who transcribed its story, as [...] "the worst of the nine fearful curses that plague mankind". A further tale recorded by Traill Dennison gives a brief mention of another stoor worm, described as the progeny of the Orcadian monster, which is killed when it is severed in two by an oversized mythical ship.|$|E

2500|$|A <b>breath</b> <b>is</b> {{assisted}} if {{the ventilator}} does {{work on the}} patient. An assisted <b>breath</b> <b>is</b> one for which the ventilator does some portion {{of the work of}} breathing. For constant flow inflation, work is defined as inspiratory pressure multiplied by tidal volume. Therefore, an assisted <b>breath</b> <b>is</b> identified as a breath for which airway pressure (displayed on the ventilator) rises above baseline during inspiration. An unassisted <b>breath</b> <b>is</b> one for which the ventilator simply provides the inspiratory flow demanded by the patient and pressure stays constant throughout the breath.|$|R

2500|$|Abba Jose ben Dosetai {{taught that}} Nadab and Abihu died in [...] when two streams of fire came {{forth from the}} Holy of Holies and divided into four streams, of which two flowed into the nose of one and two into {{the nose of the}} other, so that their <b>breath</b> <b>was</b> burned up, but their {{garments}} remained untouched (as implied in [...] ).|$|E
2500|$|Many of {{his books}} {{exemplified}} this spontaneous approach, including [...] On the Road, Visions of Cody, Visions of Gerard, Big Sur, and The Subterraneans. The central features of this writing method were the ideas of breath (borrowed from Jazz and from Buddhist meditation breathing), improvising words over the inherent structures of mind and language, and limited revision. Connected with this idea of <b>breath</b> <b>was</b> {{the elimination of the}} period, substituting instead a long connecting dash. As such, the phrases occurring between dashes might resemble improvisational jazz licks. When spoken, the words take on a certain musical rhythm and tempo.|$|E
2500|$|In 1967 in Britain, Bill Ducie and Tom Parry Jones {{developed}} and marketed the first electronic breathalyser. They established Lion Laboratories in Cardiff. Ducie was a chartered electrical engineer, and Tom Parry Jones was a lecturer at UWIST. [...] The Road Safety Act 1967 introduced the first legally enforceable maximum {{blood alcohol level}} for drivers in the UK, above which it became an offence {{to be in charge}} of a motor vehicle; and introduced the roadside breathalyser, made available to police forces across the country. [...] In 1979, Lion Laboratories' version of the breathalyser, known as the Alcolyser and incorporating crystal-filled tubes that changed colour above a certain level of alcohol in the <b>breath,</b> <b>was</b> approved for police use. Lion Laboratories won the Queen's Award for Technological Achievement for the product in 1980, and it began to be marketed worldwide. The Alcolyser was superseded by the Lion Intoximeter 3000 in 1983, and later by the Lion Alcolmeter and Lion Intoxilyser. [...] These later models used a fuel cell alcohol sensor rather than crystals, providing a more reliable curbside test and removing the need for blood or urine samples to be taken at a police station. [...] In 1991, Lion Laboratories was sold to the American company MPD, Inc.|$|E
40|$|<b>Breath</b> <b>is</b> {{integral}} part of dance and human life.

2500|$|Every <b>breath</b> <b>is</b> volume cycled, {{which is}} a form of machine cycling. Any breath for which {{inspiration}} is machine cycled is classified as a mandatory breath. Hence, the <b>breath</b> sequence <b>is</b> continuous mandatory ventilation.|$|R
50|$|Commonly {{known as}} “Assist/Control”; CMV <b>is</b> a <b>breath</b> {{sequence}} for which spontaneous <b>breaths</b> <b>are</b> not possible between mandatory breaths because every patient trigger signal in the trigger window produces a machine cycled inspiration (i.e., a mandatory breath). Machine triggered mandatory <b>breaths</b> may <b>be</b> delivered at a preset rate. Therefore, {{in contrast to}} IMV, the mandatory <b>breath</b> frequency may <b>be</b> higher than the set frequency but never below it. In some pressure controlled modes on ventilators with an active exhalation valve, spontaneous breaths may occur during mandatory breaths, but the defining characteristic of CMV <b>is</b> that spontaneous <b>breaths</b> <b>are</b> not permitted between mandatory breaths.|$|R
