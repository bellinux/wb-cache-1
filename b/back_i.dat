5|$|Israel entered one artistic gymnast {{into the}} Olympic competition. Two-time Olympian Alexander Shatilov {{qualified}} and claimed his Olympic {{spot in the}} men's apparatus and all-around events via the Olympic Test Event in Rio de Janeiro by participation. Shatilov participated in both the London and Beijing Olympics. He did not advance following the qualification round in the floor and horizontal bar events due to not achieving eighth place or higher in either. Shatilov's loss in the qualification rounds makes Rio his worst Olympic finish ever. In regards to the loss, he said “things didn’t go as I planned, but that happens in sport and there’s nothing I can do about it. You {{need to know how}} to cope with disappointments and life continues. I trained hard and wanted to have a good competition, but you can’t turn the clock <b>back.</b> <b>I</b> started my floor drill well, but a small mistake cost me and I knew I had no chance after that. I never imagined a scenario like this.” He performed poorly in both the floor and bar routines, scoring 13.5 points in the floor routine, and 14.066 points in the bar routine. The floor exercise was riddled with errors and ended with a landing where it appeared as if he was trying to break a fall.|$|E
25|$|Phonemically, Tatar may {{be argued}} {{to have two}} vowel heights, high and low. There are two low vowels, front and back, while there are eight high vowels: front and back, round and unround, long and short. However, phonetically, the short high vowels are reduced: they are mid-centralized. They are {{therefore}} generally transcribed with mid vowel letters such as e and o: high front i ü, high <b>back</b> <b>ı</b> u, reduced (mid) front e ö, reduced (mid) back ë o, and low ä, a. The high back unrounded vowel ı is only found in Russian loans, though the native diphthong ëy, which only occurs word-finally, has been argued to be phonemically ï. Loaned vowels {{are considered to be}} back vowels.|$|E
25|$|I {{think it}} may be taken that we owe the sailors' working song as we now possess it to the Americans. How far do these songs date <b>back?</b> <b>I</b> doubt if the most ancient amongst them is much older than the century. It is {{noteworthy}} that the old voyagers do not hint at the sailors singing out or encouraging their efforts by choruses when at work. In the navy, of course, this sort of song was never permitted. Work proceeded to the strains of a fiddle, to the piping of the boatswain and his mates, or in earlier times yet, to the trumpet. The working song then is peculiar to the Merchant Service, but one may hunt through the old chronicles without encountering a suggestion of its existence prior to American independence and to the establishment of a Yankee marine.|$|E

500|$|After {{staying with}} the show for eight seasons, Gray ran into trouble when she {{requested}} the producers of the show to adjust her contract {{to allow her to}} direct, as did the contracts of male co-stars Duffy and Hagman. The request initially led to producers' firing the actress from the serial, though the decision was later reversed when Dallas star Larry Hagman threatened to quit the show unless Gray were rehired. Gray stated in an interview with TV Guide, [...] "The producers said, 'But you're doing so well.' I thought, 'Oh, look out! I'm on the warpath now.' It was a struggle, though, because it was a man's show. And they fired me. When I finally told Larry, he went with me into the office and said, 'If she doesn't come <b>back,</b> <b>I</b> don't come <b>back.</b> <b>I</b> can't be playing J.R. Ewing without Sue Ellen.'

500|$|Mackin also {{composed}} {{an entire}} string section and conducted an orchestra in the album.

In this interview, Mackin also commented, [...] "composing was getting so frustrating since I wasn’t writing as fast as my mind was thinking, so going <b>back</b> <b>I</b> {{wanted to make sure}} that each of my arrangements for this album and the 12 different songs were completely different".|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to being rife with continuity errors, the film has several plots, subplots and character details whose inconsistencies have been commented on by critics and audiences. The Portland Mercury has stated {{that a number of}} [...] "plot threads are introduced, then instantly abandoned." [...] In an early scene, halfway through a conversation about planning a birthday party for Johnny, Claudette off-handedly tells Lisa: [...] "I got the results of the test <b>back.</b> <b>I</b> definitely have breast cancer." [...] The issue is casually dismissed and never revisited {{during the rest of the}} film. In addition, the audience never learns the details surrounding Denny's drug-related debt to Chris-R or what led to their violent confrontation on the roof.|$|E
500|$|Most protesters {{ran after}} hearing gunshots and a {{helicopter}} chased them. After shooting stopped, protesters regrouped.

According to him he asked [...] "Why do you shoot us? We had our hands up. We are peaceful. What do you want from us?", one soldier replied [...] "I want you to leave. If you do not turn <b>back,</b> <b>I</b> have orders to shoot". Arriving ambulances started evacuating the injured when army opened fire again.|$|E
500|$|Reds catcher Clyde Sukeforth {{asserted}} that Wilson {{should have been}} credited with an additional home run in 1930 as well.

The umpire had a bad angle on it and ruled that it had hit the screen and bounced <b>back.</b> <b>I</b> {{was sitting in the}} Cincinnati bullpen, and of course, we weren't going to say anything.
