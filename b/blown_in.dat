5|$|During the Second World War, the Highfield {{location}} of the College meant it was directly in the war zone itself. With Southampton being attacked, the halls of residence were also under siege: at South Stoneham windows were <b>blown</b> <b>in</b> by bombs. The School of Navigation at the College was relocated to the communal rooms of South Stoneham House {{for the duration of}} the war, and afterwards was moved to Warsash; in 1970 the school became independent of the University (instead it is affiliated to Southampton Solent University) and is known as the Warsash Maritime Academy.|$|E
5|$|Several nearby office blocks {{were hit}} {{so badly that}} almost every window, front and back, was <b>blown</b> <b>in</b> as the {{explosion}} ripped through them. The timing of the explosion before work hours possibly prevented additional casualties. Reports also indicated that cars in nearby streets caught fire. The roof {{of at least one}} house was blown off. Buildings in the vicinity were evacuated by police, {{not only because of the}} smoke and possibility of more explosions, but because of the danger of structural damage making the buildings unstable.|$|E

5|$|The {{first half}} of the video {{features}} Beyoncé and Shakira in separate scenes. It begins with the women's faces masked by smoke. As the video progresses they are featured against several different backgrounds, including dawn (Beyoncé) and dusk (Shakira); sheets <b>blown</b> <b>in</b> the wind; bamboo covered with yellow orchids; a room with blue neon lighting and Avestan writing on the walls; and a background of stormy weather. Slow dance moves and belly dancing, during a breakdown after the bridge, are featured throughout the video. The women wear matching hairstyles and black outfits for the entirety of the video.|$|E
5|$|Afterward, both of {{them leave}} the planetarium, as Yumemi insists on escorting {{him back to his}} vehicle outside the city walls. The protagonist plans to {{transport}} Yumemi out of the city after her battery runs out {{and find a way to}} reactivate her. A machine the protagonist calls a fiddler crab, due to its design, is guarding the entrance to the city in which he came from, and he devises a plan to destroy it armed with only a grenade launcher. After his initial plan fails and he is forced to face the machine front on, Yumemi tries to protect the protagonist, but is <b>blown</b> <b>in</b> half by the war machine's machine guns.|$|E
5|$|Lester becomes {{infatuated}} with Jane's vain cheerleader friend, Angela Hayes, after seeing her perform a half-time dance routine {{at a high}} school basketball game with Jane. He starts having sexual fantasies about Angela, in which red rose petals are a recurring motif. Carolyn begins an affair with her married business rival, Buddy Kane. When Lester's boss and efficiency expert, Brad, tells him that he is to be laid off, Lester instead blackmails him for $60,000 and quits his job. Lester continues his liberation by taking a minimum-wage job at a fast-food restaurant, trading his Toyota Camry for a 1970 Pontiac Firebird, and starts working out after he overhears Angela tell Jane that she would find him sexually attractive if he got in shape. He begins smoking marijuana supplied by Ricky. The girls' friendship wanes after Jane starts a relationship with Ricky. Jane and Ricky bond over what Ricky considers the most beautiful imagery he has filmed: a plastic bag being <b>blown</b> <b>in</b> the wind.|$|E

5|$|The Duke pursues {{the group}} onto the bridge, setting off mines {{as he tries}} to catch up. With Brain {{navigating}} through the minefield, Snake manages to avoid most of the explosives, but the cab hits a mine and is <b>blown</b> <b>in</b> half, killing Cabbie. As the group flees on foot, Brain is killed when he steps on another mine. Maggie refuses to leave him, and {{stands in the middle of}} the road, shooting at the Duke's car until he runs her down, killing her. Snake and the President reach the perimeter wall and the guards raise the President on a rope. The Duke opens fire on the wall, killing the guards and forcing Snake to dive for cover, but the President shoots the Duke dead. Snake is lifted to safety, and the micro-explosives in his neck are neutralized.|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} carrier USS Ticonderoga delivered the Apollo 16 Command Module to the North Island Naval Air Station, near San Diego, California, on Friday, May 5, 1972. On Monday, May 8, 1972, ground service equipment {{being used to}} empty the residual toxic reaction control system fuel in the Command Module tanks exploded in a Naval Air Station hangar. Forty-six people {{were sent to the}} hospital for 24 to 48 hours observation, most suffering from inhalation of toxic fumes. Most seriously injured was a technician who suffered a fractured kneecap when the GSE cart overturned on him. A hole was <b>blown</b> <b>in</b> the hangar roof 250 feet above; about 40 windows in the hangar were shattered. The Command Module suffered a three-inch gash in one panel.|$|E

25|$|Under the {{leadership}} of the Thomases, father and son, Thomas Iron produced record quantities of iron, and was looked upon as an exemplar of the iron industry. New furnaces were built at Hokendauqua: No. 3 was <b>blown</b> <b>in</b> on July 18, 1862 and No. 4 on April 29, 1863. On December 26, 1866, Samuel Thomas and other officials of Thomas Iron chartered the Lock Ridge Iron Company, which began building two furnaces at Alburtis in 1867. The first furnace was placed in blast on March 18, 1868. Lock Ridge Iron was bought by Thomas Iron on May 1, 1869, and the second furnace placed in blast on July 9, 1869. This facility had its own small plant railroad, which connected with the East Pennsylvania Railroad (later the Reading) and the Catasauqua and Fogelsville. Two more furnaces were built at Hokendauqua after the Civil War, No. 5 <b>blown</b> <b>in</b> on September 15, 1873 and No. 6 on January 19, 1874. The two Lock Ridge furnaces were later renumbered No. 7 and No. 8.|$|E
25|$|The Roman leaf beaker {{which is}} now {{on display in the}} J. Paul Getty Museum was <b>blown</b> <b>in</b> a three-part mold {{decorated}} with the foliage relief frieze of four vertical plants. Meanwhile, Taylor and Hill tried to reproduce mold-blown vessels by using three-part molds made of different materials. The result suggested that metal, in particular bronze, molds are more effective in producing high-relief design on glass than plaster molds and wooden molds.|$|E
25|$|Construction of {{the first}} furnace {{commenced}} about August 1, 1839, at Biery's Port, later Catasauqua. The ovens for the hot blast were coal-fired, and the blowing engine was driven by a waterwheel tapping the canal at Lock 36. The furnace was <b>blown</b> <b>in</b> on July 3, 1840 and the first four tons of iron produced July 4, 1840. It remained in blast until flooded by a January freshet in 1841, producing 1,080 tons of iron during that period.|$|E

25|$|Renaissance Europe {{witnessed}} {{the revitalization of}} glass industry in Italy. Glassblowing, in particular the mold-blowing technique, was employed by the Venetian glassworkers from Murano to produce the fine glassware which {{is also known as}} cristallo. The technique of glassblowing, coupled with the cylinder and crown methods, was used to manufacture sheet or flat glass for window panes in the late 17th century. The applicability of glassblowing was so widespread that glass was being <b>blown</b> <b>in</b> many parts of the world, for example, in China, Japan and the Islamic Lands.|$|E
25|$|Although {{attempts}} by three tugs from Cardiff {{to remove the}} largest piece of the wreck were unsuccessful, the next spring tide carried it up the estuary onto Town Bar, opposite the port of Padstow, where it was a hazard to shipping. A miner named Pope {{was called in to}} remove it: he manoeuvred a box filled with gelignite underneath the wreck and detonated it after clearing the area. The resulting explosion was so violent that reports claim every window in the nearby harbour of Padstow was <b>blown</b> <b>in</b> and the smoke could be seen three miles (5 km) away.|$|E
