5|$|Madeleine's {{mother had}} {{intended}} {{to check on the}} children at 21:30, but Matthew Oldfield, one of the Tapas Seven, offered to do it when he checked on his own children in the apartment next door to 5A. He noticed that the McCanns' children's bedroom door was wide open, but after hearing no noise, he left 5A without looking far enough into the <b>bedroom</b> <b>to</b> see whether Madeleine was there. He could not recall whether the bedroom window and its exterior shutter were open at this point. Early on in the investigation, the Polícia Judiciária accused Oldfield of involvement because he had volunteered to do the check, suggesting to him that he had handed Madeleine to someone through the bedroom window.|$|E
5|$|At {{the house}} of her friend, Effy Stonem (Kaya Scodelario), Pandora (Lisa Backwell) tells Effy's mother, Anthea (Morwenna Banks), that she misses Thomas, who {{recently}} returned to his country of origin, the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Later, Effy's father, Jim (Harry Enfield), discovers his wife's infidelity when his boss, Steve (David Baddiel), arrives at the house, declaring his love for Anthea. Effy grows miserable after Jim leaves the family, and Pandora, desperate for some fun, throws a pyjama party. Effy and Katie Fitch (Megan Prescott) arrive with Pandora at her house for the party and meet her neurotic mother, Angela (Sally Phillips). Disappointed {{by the lack of}} boys, drugs and alcohol because of Angela's strict supervision, Katie spikes the brownies that they make with MDMA. As Naomi Campbell (Lily Loveless) and Katie's twin sister, Emily (Kathryn Prescott), arrive together, Naomi urges Emily to admit that she is gay, but Emily denies it. All of the girls indulge in the brownies and Pandora is unhappy to see her mother's behaviour grow increasingly erratic. After Angela is carried into a <b>bedroom</b> <b>to</b> sleep, Pandora locks herself in the bathroom, upset about Thomas's departure and angry with Effy, who she believes spiked the brownies.|$|E
5|$|Lygon's successor, the {{politician}} Rufus Isaacs, the Marquess of Reading, became the Lord Warden in 1934, holding jovial family gatherings there. His wife, Stella, attempted to restore Wellington's old <b>bedroom</b> <b>to</b> its earlier appearance during the Duke's tenure and, {{as part of}} this project, the 4th Duke of Wellington agreed to send the original contents of the room back to the castle, where they still remain. The politician Freeman Freeman-Thomas, the Marquess of Willingdon, became Lord Warden in 1936, followed by Sir Winston Churchill who followed him in 1941 during the Second World War. Churchill noted to the Minister of Works and Buildings that he had told King George V on taking up the position that he doubted that {{he would be able to}} live at Walmer Castle during the war, as it was within range of the German artillery along the French coast, or indeed that he would able to afford to live there afterwards, and for that reason he hoped that the state would maintain the castle and gardens, and decide what use it should be put to after the war.|$|E

5|$|Wollstonecraft {{was born}} on 27 April 1759 in Spitalfields, London. She was {{the second of the}} seven {{children}} of Elizabeth Dixon and Edward John Wollstonecraft. Although her family had a comfortable income when she was a child, her father gradually squandered it on speculative projects. Consequently, the family became financially unstable and they were frequently forced to move during Wollstonecraft's youth. The family's financial situation eventually became so dire that Wollstonecraft's father compelled her to turn over money that she would have inherited at her maturity. Moreover, he was apparently a violent man who would beat his wife in drunken rages. As a teenager, Wollstonecraft used to lie outside the door of her mother's <b>bedroom</b> <b>to</b> protect her. Wollstonecraft played a similar maternal role for her sisters, Everina and Eliza, throughout her life. For example, in a defining moment in 1784, she convinced Eliza, who was suffering from what was probably postpartum depression, to leave her husband and infant; Wollstonecraft made all of the arrangements for Eliza to flee, demonstrating her willingness to challenge social norms. The human costs, however, were severe: her sister suffered social condemnation and, because she could not remarry, was doomed to a life of poverty and hard work.|$|E

25|$|In 1940, a {{back porch}} {{was added to}} the home and a garage was built on the {{northwest}} corner of the lot. A year later, the new owners added a second <b>bedroom</b> <b>to</b> the northwest corner of the house. With that addition, today’s historic structure was complete. Subsequent alterations changed some of the original characteristics. For example, in the 1970s, the original double-hung windows were replaced by aluminum frame windows. The original doors were also replaced during that period.|$|E
25|$|Meucci later {{claimed that}} he {{constructed}} the first electromagnetic telephone, made of an electromagnet with a nucleus {{in the shape of}} a horseshoe bat, a diaphragm of animal skin, stiffened with potassium dichromate and keeping a metal disk stuck in the middle. The instrument was hosted in a cylindrical carton box. He said he constructed this as a way to connect his second-floor <b>bedroom</b> <b>to</b> his basement laboratory, and thus communicate with his wife who was an invalid.|$|E

25|$|SB.TV {{was founded}} in 2006, when a teenage Jamal Edwards MBE (son of The X Factor series 2 {{contestant}} Brenda Edwards) began filming rap freestyles with a handycam, which he would then upload to his YouTube account. For {{the first three years}} Edwards acted alone to provide amateur footage of many British grime artists, such as Dizzee Rascal, Wiley, Chipmunk and Tinchy Stryder, with the first SB.TV video being uploaded in February 2007. A channel 4 documentary series, <b>Bedroom</b> <b>to</b> Boardroom that follows SB.TV was filmed in Edwards first office, Camden Collective. As the channel began to attract more attention, it also began offering lifestyle interviews and event coverage, and a production team of ten people was established as a result.|$|E
25|$|In August 1871, Ruskin {{purchased}} from W. J. Linton the then somewhat dilapidated Brantwood, {{on the shores}} of Coniston Water, in the English Lake District, paying £1500. It remains open to visitors today. It was Ruskin's main home from 1872 until his death. His estate provided a site for more of his practical schemes and experiments: an ice house was built, the gardens were comprehensively rearranged, he oversaw the construction of a larger harbour (from where he rowed his boat, the Jumping Jenny), and altered the house (adding a dining room, turret to his <b>bedroom</b> <b>to</b> give a panoramic view of the lake, and later expanding further to accommodate his relatives). He built a reservoir, and redirected the waterfall down the hills, adding a slate seat that faced the tumbling stream rather than the lake, so that he could closely observe the fauna and flora of the hillside.|$|E
25|$|When Corinna (wife) {{arrives with}} Mervyn {{it is clear}} that when we saw Nan in act 1, Jerome had {{modelled}} her on Corinna. In fact the actress who played Nan (the robot) in act 1 now plays Corinna (the wife) in act 2. Geain doesn't arrive at this point as she has gone to visit a shop first. We first see her on the video screen at the door to the flat. Because of her masculine hair and clothing Jerome initially mistakes her for a local hooligan, and she enters looking surly, unwashed and very unfeminine – in complete contrast to the delightful 9-year-old girl shown on screen in Act 1. This makes Jerome very upset. Nan/Zoe's child-minding programming kicks in and she takes Geain to the kitchen for a drink. When they return shortly afterwards Nan/Zoe has transformed Geain, who is now clean, feminine and wearing a night-dress. She is still uncooperative, but has already developed a degree of respect for Nan/Zoe who takes her to the <b>bedroom</b> <b>to</b> put her to bed.|$|E

500|$|Chesnutt shopped {{the album}} around to record companies, but they mistook {{it for a}} demo and {{rejected}} it.

500|$|More {{significant}} is {{the connection between}} the women in the novel and the women in Balzac's life. Some critics have noted important similarities between Valentin's efforts to win the heart of Foedora and Balzac's infatuation with Olympe Pélissier. A scene in which Valentin hides in Foedora's <b>bedroom</b> <b>to</b> watch her undress is said to come from a similar situation wherein Balzac secretly observed Pélissier. It's probable that Pélissier was not the model for Foedora, however, since she accepted Balzac's advances and wrote him friendly letters; Foedora, by contrast, declares herself outside the reach of any interested lover. Critics agree that the [...] "Woman without a Heart" [...] described in the novel is a composite of other women Balzac knew. The character of Pauline, meanwhile, was likely influenced by another of Balzac's mistresses, Laure de Berny.|$|E
