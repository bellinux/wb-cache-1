5|$|Before {{its release}} on 10 June 2005, one preview {{wondered}} how the film would fare at the box office. Citing comparisons with the 1953 version, the preview suggested that debutant director, Sarkar's inexperience in film-making, the probable inability of debutant actress, <b>Balan</b> to portray Lalita's character appropriately, suitable 1960s depiction by contemporary actors and musician, Shantanu Moitra's until then unimpressive soundtracks, could be impediments to a successful adaptation.|$|E

5|$|Chopra {{said in an}} {{interview}} that Saif Ali Khan and Vidya <b>Balan</b> were not the first choices for the lead roles in Parineeta.

This fact was corroborated by Saif in {{an interview}} when he said that even though Sarkar had faith in his abilities, Chopra was not too keen on having him.|$|E

40|$|The electromyographic {{activity}} of the paraspinal muscles at four levels were examined to investigate the effects of chair sitting on muscle activation patterns and muscle fatigue. The <b>Balans,</b> Nada-Chair Back Up, and Standard Office Chair were studied. Twenty four {{subjects were asked to}} engage in a seated writing task for 10 minutes for each of three chairs. Prior to the first writing period and between each writing period, the subjects were asked to perform a standardized muscle fatigue assessment while standing. The results of the study indicate that the seated writing task differentially effects only the paraspinal muscles at L 3 site. During the writing task, the <b>Balans</b> chair required the largest amount of muscular effort. The standard Office chair showed evidence of fatigue. The Back Up chair yielded the best performance. In 87. 5 % of the comparisons the Nada-Chair Back Up has lower readings of muscular effort compared to the <b>Balans</b> and Office Chair. During the muscle fatigue testing during standing, evidence of increased muscle fatigue was observed as a function of each sit period. The greatest amount of fatigue was noted in those subjects who sat in the Back Up chair last. When the Back Up chair was first or second, the least amount of fatigue was observed. The IEMG results reflect a biomechanical model. The distribution of the <b>Balans</b> chair is unnatural and gives the least amount of support to the pelvis and lower spine, while the Back Up provides the greatest amount of support. The <b>Balans</b> chair overworks the low and mid back muscles, only to spare the cervical sets, while the Nada-Chair Back Up provides the greatest amount of lumbar support. The energy expenditure of the Office chair and <b>Balans</b> chair is significantly higher in the low and mid back area. This higher energy expenditure leads to fatigue while sitting. In conclusion, the level of muscular effort and accompanying fatigue associated with sitting are directly related to poor or inadequate biomechanical support of the chair...|$|R

50|$|In 1979, Hans Christian Mengshoel {{invented the}} {{original}} kneeling chair of modern times, the <b>Balans</b> chair. Three Norwegian designers, Oddvin Rykken, Peter Opsvik, and Professor Svein Gusrud developed chairs {{based on the}} same principle.|$|R

5|$|In March 2012, Sujoy Ghosh {{announced}} {{that he intended to}} develop Kahaani into a series. He was inspired by Satyajit Ray's Feluda detective series and wanted to continue the stories of Vidya Bagchi on similar lines, with Vidya <b>Balan</b> reprising the role. The shooting of Kahaani 2 was scheduled to begin in 2013, but in July 2013 differences arose between Sujoy Ghosh and other co-producers. In February 2014, Vidya {{announced that}} the sequel was not happening due to these differences, but two years later, Ghosh confirmed that the film was in pre-production with Vidya set to reprise her role. The sequel, entitled Kahaani 2, began filming in March 2016 with Vidya and Arjun Rampal in lead roles, and was released on 2 December 2016.|$|E
5|$|Kahaanis first-look poster was {{launched}} on 2 December 2011, {{and the official}} trailer on 5 January 2012.

Vidya appeared in public with a prosthetic belly to promote the film, and mingled with the public in railway stations, bus stands and markets. She often carried a sketch of her on-screen missing husband, and asked people to help in finding him.

Since their split, Kapoor decided to keep his {{personal life}} away from media attention. However, tabloids speculated on his relationship with several other actresses, including Vidya <b>Balan</b> and Priyanka Chopra.|$|E
