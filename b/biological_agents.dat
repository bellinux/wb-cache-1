5|$|Typical {{metalloids}} have {{a metallic}} appearance, {{but they are}} brittle and only fair conductors of electricity. Chemically, they behave mostly as nonmetals. They can form alloys with metals. Most of their other {{physical and chemical properties}} are intermediate in nature. Metalloids are usually too brittle to have any structural uses. They and their compounds are used in alloys, <b>biological</b> <b>agents,</b> catalysts, flame retardants, glasses, optical storage and optoelectronics, pyrotechnics, semiconductors, and electronics.|$|E
5|$|Many {{other species}} have become {{naturalized}} outside the Americas {{after having been}} introduced by people, especially in Australia, Hawaii, and the Mediterranean region. In Australia, species of Opuntia, particularly Opuntia stricta, were introduced in the 19th century for use as natural agricultural fences and {{in an attempt to}} establish a cochineal industry. They rapidly became a major weed problem, but are now controlled by <b>biological</b> <b>agents,</b> particularly the moth Cactoblastis cactorum. The weed potential of Opuntia species in Australia continues however, leading to all opuntioid cacti except O. ficus-indica being declared Weeds of National Significance by the Australian Weeds Committee in April 2012.|$|E

5|$|On December 31, 1999, Moscoso {{oversaw the}} {{handover}} of the Panama Canal from the US to Panama under the Torrijos-Carter Treaties. Her government then faced {{the challenge of}} cleaning up environmental problems in the Canal Zone, where the US Army had long tested bombs, <b>biological</b> <b>agents,</b> and chemical weapons. Remaining issues included lead contamination, unexploded munitions, and stockpiles of depleted uranium. Though Moscoso fired all of PÃ©rez Balladares' appointments from the Panama Canal Authority and appointed supermarket magnate (and future president) Ricardo Martinelli as its head, the Authority retained its autonomy from her administration. At the same time, Panama's economy began to struggle due {{to the loss of}} income from American canal personnel.|$|E
5|$|The commune {{leadership}} {{planned to}} sicken and incapacitate voters in The Dalles, {{where most of}} the voters resided, to sway the election. Approximately twelve people were involved in the plots to employ <b>biological</b> <b>agents,</b> and at least eleven were involved in the planning process. No more than four appear to have been involved in development at the Rajneeshpuram medical laboratory; not all of those were necessarily aware of the objectives their work served. At least eight individuals were involved with the distribution of the bacteria.|$|E
5|$|Plans for the {{invasion}} of Japan incorporated an Alsos Mission. Japanese fire balloon attacks on the United States had aroused fears that the technique might be used in combination with <b>biological</b> <b>agents,</b> which the Japanese Unit 731 {{was known to be}} experimenting with. In March 1945, the physicist and seismologist L. Don Leet was appointed as head of the scientific section of the Alsos Mission to Japan. Leet had previously worked with the Manhattan Project on the Trinity nuclear test. Plans were drawn up to prepare and equip a T-Force {{along the lines of the}} one in Europe, but made up of personnel already in the Pacific. The mission differed from its European counterpart in that it was solely American and consisted of only one intelligence agency. Responsibility for nuclear matters was subsequently handled by a separate Manhattan Project Intelligence Group organized by Groves.|$|E
